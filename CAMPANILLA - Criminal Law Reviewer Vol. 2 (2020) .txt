TREASON
Treason is committed by any Filipino citizen or an alien residing
in th e P h i l i p p i n es, wh o s h al l l e v y w a r a g a i ns t t h e P h i l i p p i n es
o r adhere to he r e n e mies giving t h e m a i d o r c o m fort w i t h i n t h e
Philippines or elsewhere. (Article 114; 1946 Bar Exam)
Treason is a war crime. It is not an all-time offense. It cannot be
committed in peace time. While there is peace, there are no traitors.
(Laurel v. Misa, G.R. No. L-409, January 30, 1947)
F ilipino Ci t i zen an d R e sident A l i e n
Treason is a breach of allegiance and can only be committed by
a person who owes allegiance either perpetual or temporary. (52A m
Jur 796) Allegiance means obligation of fidelity and obedience which
individuals owe to the government under which they live, or to their
sovereign in return for the protection which they receive. (Laurel v.
Misa, supra)
A citizen owes, not a qualified and temporary, but an absolute
and permanent allegiance, which consists in the obligation of fidelity
and obedience to hi s government o r s overeign. Th e absolute and
permanent allegiance of the citizens to their legitim ate government
or sovereign is not abrogated or severed by the enemy [Japanese]
occupation, because the sovereignty of the government or sovereign
de jure is not transferred thereby to the occupier [Japan]. (Laurel v.
Misa, ibid.)
A foreigner owes temporary allegiance to the government of the
place wherein he resides in return for the protection he receives. Such

J9JC9B0M

AND LAW OF NATIONS

temporary allegiance continues during th e period of his residence.
If an alien, while residing in a f or eign country, does an act, which
w ould amount to t r eason if commit ted by a citizen of that countr y ,
he will b e h el d l i a ble for t r e ason. (52 Am J u r 79 7 ) F u r t h e r m o re,
Article 114 of the Revised Penal Code punishes a resident alien for
committing treason. (2012 Bar Exam)

deliberately augmenting the wr ong by being unnecessarily cruel to
captured guerrilla suspects, subjecting them to barbarous forms of
torture and fi n a ll y p u t t i n g t h e m t o d e ath, or t h a t o f i g n ominy by
arresting and maltreating a guerrilla suspect and then stripping his
wife of her clothes and then abusing her together with other Filipin o
girls. (People v. Adlawan, supra; 2012 Bar Exam)

L evying War , an d G i v in g Ai d an d C o m f o r t

Two-wit n ess Rule

L evying of war r e quires an actual assemblage of men for t h e
purpose of executing a treasonable design by force. (52 Am Jur
799) Actual assemblage or g a th ering of m e n t o l ev y w a r a g a i n st
the government or t o fi gh t t h e g overnment f orce in a d h erence to
its enemy consummates the crime of treason. However, actual arm
e ncounter, or gun battle between the government forces and t ait or s
is not required.

No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony
of two witnesses atleast to the same over act or on confession of the
accused in open court. (Article 114 of the Revised Penal Code)

The phr a se "giving ai d a n d c o m f o rt" m e a ns a n a c t w h i c h
strengthens or tends to strengthen the enemy, and weakens or tends
to weaken the power of the tr a i t or's country, in th e conduct of war
between them. (C ramer v. U . S., 65 Sup. Ct. 918) Commandeering
foodstuffsfrom civilian populace for the Japanese soldiers is treason.
Food supplies are indispensable in the conduct of war. Insufficiency
of food supplies tends to weaken th e m i l i t ar y p ower of th e enemy
[Japan]. (see: People v. Ma n g ahas, G.R. Nos. L-5867 and L - 5 8 68,
June 9, 1958) However, commandeering women to satisfy the l us t
o f the Japanese officers is not tr eason. Enemy soldiers can fight i n
a war with or w i t h out sex. Providing sex services to enemy soldiers
did not tend to improve war efforts ofthe Japanese imper'al army
or to weaken the power of th e U n i t ed St ates. (see: People v. Perez,
G.R No. L-856, April 18, 1949) In this case, the crime committed is
trafficking in persons.
Aggravat ing C i r c u m s t a n c es
T reachery and abuse of superior strength are by their n a t u r e ,
inherent in the offense of treason and may not be taken to aggravate
the penalty. (People v. Adl a w a n, G. R. No. L-456, March 29, 1949
)
Evident premeditation is inherent in treason because adherence and
the giving of aid and comfort to the enemy is a long, continuec process
requiring for the successful consummation of the traitor's purpose a
fixed, reflective and persistent determination and planning. (People
v. Racaza, G.R. No. L-865, January 21, 1949) However, the penalty
f or treason may b e a ggravated by th e c i r cumstance of cruelty b y

To meet the t est u n der th e t w o -w i t ness rule, it i s n ecessary
that, at least, two wit nesses should testify as to the perpetration of
the same treasonous overtact. (People v. Agpangan, G.R. No. L-778,
October 10, 1 947) Th r ee w i t n e sses testified t h a t a c c used burne d
different houses on the same day. However, the w i t n esses did not
see the accused burned the same house. Accused was acquitted for
lack of compliance with t h e t w o -wi t n ess rule. (People v. Gonzales,
G.R. No. L-710, March 5, 1948) However, the accused can be held
liable for arson.
I t i s n o t h o w e ver r e q u i re d t h a t t h e t e s t i m on y o f t h e t w o
witnesses must be identical. Although there may not be corroboration
between the two prosecution wit n esses on the points they testified,
yet when the wit nesses are uniform in t h eir t estimony on the overt
act of treason charged, the two-witness rule is complied with. (People
v. Concepcion, G.R. No. L-1558, October 25, 1949) A witness testified
that he heard a gunshot, and saw smoke emitt in g from th e gun of
the accused whil e t h e v i c ti m f e ll . A n o t her w i t n e ss, who i s d e af,
testified that t h e accused raised and pointed th e gun, an d smoke
puffed from it. The testimony of both would certainly be to the same
overt act. (See: Hauft v. U.S., 67 S. Ct. 874; The Revised Penal Code
by CA Justice Luis Reyes)
Testimony of two witnesses is needed to prove overt act of
giving aid and comfort to the enemy but not to establish the element
of adherence to t h e e n e my . T h u s , t h e t e s t i m ony o f on e w i t n e ss
is enough to pr ove that t h e accused is a m e mber of Ma k a pi l i, a n
organization of traitors, to show that he is adhering to the Japanese
Imperial Ar my. (People v. Rosas, G.R. No. L-2958, March 16, 1951)
T wo-witness r u l e

confession. On the other hand, extraj udieial confession is not enough

to convict the accused for treason. (Alarcon, G.R. No. L-407, July 28,
1947) At l east tw o w i t n esses must st il l t e stify on t h e over, act of
treason as a pre-condition for his conviction.
Two-witness rule is not applicable in proving crime other than
treason such as conspiracy or proposal to commit treason, misprision
of treason or conspiracy to commit rebellion. (2018 Bar Exam)
In Pe ople v. C l o r e s, G . R. N o . 8 2 3 6 2, A p r i l 2 6 , 1 9 9 0 , t h e
testimony of only one witness, if credible and positive, is sufficient to
support a criminal conviction for murder. The fact that his testimony
i s uncorroborated will no t d e t r act f rom it s cr edibili ty . Th ere is no
law which requires that the testimony of a single witness h" s to be
corroborated, except where expressly mandated as in tre ason where
t he testimony of a t l e ast t w o w i t n e sses to th e s ame overt ac t i s
needed.

A ppointm e n t
Mere possession of an appointment as officer of the enemy of the
State is not an evidence of a crime. (U.S. v. Manalo, G.R. No. L-2723,
August 9, 1906) Mere acceptance of the commission as officer of the
enemy of the State is not an evidence of treason. But the acceptor can
be held liable for a lesser crime. (U.S. v. Delos Reyes, G.R. No. 1484,
February 28, 1 904) At tending a m e e ting w h e re conspiracy to levy
war against the government was hatched, acceptance of appointment
as officer of the armed forces to be raised for the fur t h erance of the
designs of the conspirators and assumption of obligation as officer
constitute the crime of conspiracy to commit treason by levying war.

M emb er s h i p
Treason by levying war requires actual assemblage of men for
purpose ofexecuting a treasonable design by force. Ifthere is actual
assemblage of men for treasonable purpose, there istreason even
though there is no actual clash of arms. (Crimin al L aw C onspectus
by Justice Florenz Regalado)
In t r e ason by g i v i n g a i d a n d co m f o rt, m e m b e rship i n a n
organization established toadhere to the enemy by giving it aid and
comfort is treason. Being a member of organization of trait ors (e.g.,
Makapili o rg anization) is in i t s elf constituti ve of an overt act. It i s
not necessary, except for the purpose of increasing the punishment,
that th e m e mber a c t u ally w en t t o b a t t l e o r c o m m i t ted n efarious
acts against his country or countrymen. The cri me of t r e ason was
committed if he placed himself at the enemy's call to fight side by side
with him when the opportune time came even though an opportunity
never presented itself. Such membership by its very nature gave the
enemy aid an d comfort. Th e enemy derived psychological comfort
in the knowledge that he had on his side citizens of the State with
which it was at war. It fur ni shed the enemy aid in that his cause was
advanced, his forces augmer ted, and his courage was enhanced by
the knowledge that he could count on men such as the accused and
his kind who were ready to strike at their own people. The practical
effect of it was no different from that of enlisting in the invader's army.
(People v. Adriano, G.R. ¹. L- 4 7 7 , June 30,1947)
In sum, joining the Makapili organization during World War I I
is treason by giving aid a nd c omfort. If u pon receiving information
that the American forces are coming, the members of Makapili sid e
by side with the Japanese soldiers assembled and established a line
of defense in an i s l and, they ar e l i able for t r e ason by levying war
against the government. Ac tual a r m e d b a t t l e w i t h t h e A m e r i c an
forces is not required to consummate the crime of treason by levying
war.

as conspirators are liable for the "crime of treason"; the proponent is
also considered as principal by i n d ucement; the conspirators could

former absorbs the latt er. Conspiracy in t hi s case is just a mode of
incurring collective criminal li ability for tr eason.
Offenders
To be heldliable for conspiracy to commit treason, the offenders
must be in th e position to commit t r e ason. Since treason can onl
be committed by F i l i p in o cit i zen and r esiden: al i en, th e offenders
in conspiracy to commit t r e ason must l i k e w ise be Fi l i p ino citizen
and resident a l i en . I f a F i l i p i n o c i t i zen an d a J a p a n ese touri st

Peacetime and Wartime Crime
According t o C A J u s t ice L u i s R eyes, conspiracy or p r o posal
to commit tr eason is committed in t i me of war. However, according
to Justice Florenz Regalado, the crime of proposal or conspiracy to
commit treason or misprision o f treason can be committed in peacetime
although they are more often wartime offenses. If offenders conspired
to levy wa r a g a i nst t h e P h i l i p p in e G overnment, in a d h erence to

deciding tohelp the rebels by raising funds constitutes conspiracy to
commit rebellion, and not conspiracy to commit tr eason.

in a river of a m u n i cipality constit utes piracy under P.D. No. 582.
(People v. Dela Pena, G.B. No. 219581, January 81, 2018)

No. 582, a pirate is any person including a passenger or member of
the complement of the vessel. Thus, a pir ate can be an outsider or
insider.

Any person, who knowingly and in any manner aids or protects
pirates, or who directly or indirectly abets the commission of piracy,
shall beconsidered as an accomplice of the principal offenders, and
t hus, the p enalty p r escribed by P .D . N o . 58 2 fo r p i r acy sh all b e

Aiding or protecting pir ates includes giving them information
a bout t h e m o v e m en t o f p o l i c e o r ot he r p e a c e officers of the
government, or acquiring or r eceiving property t aken by pi r a tes or
in any manner derives any benefit
therefrom.
It shall be presumed that any person who does any of the acts
o f an accomplice in p i r acy h a s p e r f ormed k n o w i n gly, u n l ess t h e
contrary is proven. (Section 4 of P.D. No. 882)
Piracy under the Revised Penal Code and Piracy under P.D.
No. 582
Similarities and differences between piracy under the Pievised
Penal Code, and piracy under P.D. No. 582 are as follows:
1.
Cr i m i n a l A c t — The criminal act in both piracy under the
Revised Penal Code and piracy under P.D. No.582 is attacking upon
or seizing a vessel, or t a k in g a way or s eizing th e vessel, o" other
properties with in t ent to gain.
2. M o d e of Com m i ssion — In piracy under P.D. No. 532,
the seizure or t a k in g m u s t b e commi t ted by m e ans of vi olence or
intimidation against person, or force upon things (such as destroyin
eying
t he door of a vessel s room). On the other hand, the Revised Penal
Code has no t m e n t i o ned " b y m e a ns of v i o l e nce or i n t i m i dation
against person orforce upon things" as an element of or as a mode of
committing piracy.
In 2006 Bar Ex am, the offenders, who are from a vesse', took
properties from another vessel while the crew were sleeping. There
is no violence or in t i m i d a t ion against person or force upon th i n gs.
Th
he panel organized by UP Law Center suggested that the crime is
piracy under the Revised Penal Code.
Piracy under P .D. No. 582 is simi lar t o r o bbery w h il e p i r acy

under the Revised Penal Code is similar to theft or robbery.

13

4.
V es sel —
Vessel for purposes of piracy under P.D. No. 532
refers to any vessel or watercraft used for t r a n sport of pa ssengers
and cargo from one place to another thr ough Philippine waters. But
it shall i n clude vessels or boats used in fi s h i ng. (1 977 Bar E x a m )
T hus, a s hi p o r v e ssel constitu t in g t h e d w e l l in g o f on e o r m o r e
persons is not a vessel within the meaning of P.D. No. 582.
The Revised Penal Code provides no definition of a vessel for
purposes of piracy. Hence, vesselfor purposes of piracy under the
Code is generic, and it is not confined to passenger, cargo or f ishing
vessel. However, under A r t i cle 301 of the Revised Penal Code, for
purposes of robbery by u s in g f o rce upon t h i n gs, a s hi p o r v e ssel
constituting the dwelling of one or more persons is considered as an
inhabited house.
If the ac "used used force upon thing (e.g., breaking the window)
to enter i n t o a r e s i d ential v e ssel, an d t h e r eafter, t ook p e r sonal
properties therein, the crime committed is piracy under the Code if
the accused is an outsider, or robbery by u sing force upon thing if
he is an insider. Accused is not liable for piracy under P.D. No. 532
since the crime i s not comm i t ted i n a p a ssenger, cargo or fishing
vessel.
5.

Pl a c e o f C o m m i s s ion —In pira cy under P.D. No. 532,

the vessel where the crime is committed must be in Philippine
waters. P.D. No. 582 in defining "Phil i ppine waters" merely copied
the definition of t e r r i t or y u n der t h e 1 973 Constit u t i on. Since th e

1987 Constitution introduces changes in the definition of territory,
Philippine w a t er s u n de r P .D . N o . 5 8 2 m u s t n o w b e u n d e r stood
within th e context of t h e p r esent Constit u t i on. Ph i l i p pine w at er s

archipelagic waters such as those around, between, and connecting
the islands of the Philippine archipelago and the 12-mile territ orial

water such asManila Bay. (1970 Bar Exam) Beyond this point are
high seas forpurposes of piracy.
Before, in p i r acy u n der t h e R e v ised Penal Code, th e v essel
where the crime is commit ted must be on high seas. But R.A. No.

7659 amended Article122 of RPC by punishing piracy not only on

P h i li p p i n e Wa t e r s — I f p i r a c y i s c o m m i t t e d i n
Philippine w at ers such as th e P a sig River (1977 Bar E x a m ;
People v. Dela Pena, G.B. No. 21 9581, January 81, 2018), or
Manila Bay (1970 Bar Exam), the pirates can be prosecuted for
piracy under P.D. No. 582 whether the offenders are outsiders
or insiders provided that t h er e is vi olence or in t i m i d a t ion or
force upon things, or for piracy under the Revised Penal Code
provided that the offenders are outsiders.
If the acts constitute piracy under the Revised Penal Code
and piracy under P.D. No. 582, the accused can be prosecuted
for either of them. In People v. Tulin, G.R. No. 111709, August
3 0, 2001, t h e a c cused a r g ued t h a t R . A . N o . 7 6 5 9 , which
a mended Ar t i cl e 12 2 o f R e v i sed P enal C od e b y p u n i s h i n g
piracy in Ph i l i p p ines waters, impliedly repealed P.D. No. 532
on piracy in P h i l i p p ine w a t ers. The Supreme Court r e jected
s uch ar g u m ent . I t w a s h e l d t h a t R . A . N o . 7 6 5 9 n e i t h e r
superseded nor amended the provisions on piracy under P.D.
No. 532. There is no contradiction between t' he provisions on
piracy under the Revised Penal Code and P.D. No. 582.A:I the
presidentialdecree did was to widen the coverage of thec alaw
w by
punishing piracy committed by a passenger and complement

o f the ship. For this reason, piracy under the Article lo2 f
Revised Penal Code and piracy under P.D. No. 582 exist
harmoniously as separate laws.
While piracy under P.D, No. 532 must be committed
by the principals in Philippines waters, the participation of
accomplice can be made on high seas or in f oreign waters. In
People v. Tulin, supra, the pirates boarded and seized a vessel

by means of violence and intimidation while in the Philippine
waters. They then directed the vessel to proceed to Singapore
w here th e c a r goes w er e u n l o aded, t r a n sferred an d s ol d t o
accused Hiong. Although P.D. No. 532 requires that the attack
and seizure of the vessel and its cargo must be committed in
Philippine waters, the disposition by the pi r ates of the vessel
and its cargo is still deemed part of the act of piracy. Hence, the
participation of Hiong as an accomplice in receiving prope. ties
t aken by t h e p i r a t e s n eed no t b e c o m m i t te d i n P h i l i p p i n e
waters. As to the issue of jurisdiction, piracy is a crime against
the

on t e r r i t o r i a l it y

H i gh S e a s — If piracy is committed on high seas such
800 miles away from Apar ri , Cagayan, the pirates can only be
prosecuted under the Revised Penal Code. (2006and 2016 Bar

Hence, the court has jurisdiction over this crime. But homicide
or murder committed not by a pi r ate but by a passenger, who

took advantage of the calamity brought about by piracy, is
subject to the flag state rule. Thus, the court of the State where
the vessel is registered has jurisdiction over this crime. (2008

The differericesbetween piracy on high seas and robbery
on high seas are as follows: (1) piracy on high seas is committed
by outsiders while robbery on th e h ig h seas is committed by
i nsiders; an d ( 2 ) p i r a c y i s s u b j ect t o e x t r a t e r r i t o r i alit y o r

Bar Exam), th e cr im e commit ted i s q u a lified p i r acy. The nu m b e r
of persons killed on the occasion of piracy is not m at eri al. The law
considers qualifiedpiracy as a special complex crime regardless of
the number of victims. (People v. Siyoh, G.R. ¹. L - 5 7 2 92, February
18, 1986; 2016 Bar Exam)
In the course ofpiracy, A, a passenger, taking advantage of the
confusion to settle an old grudge with B, ki l led him. The pirates are
liable for simple piracy wh ile A i s l i a ble for homicide. The pir ates
are not liable for qualified piracy since there is no direct connection
or intimate relationship between piracy and homicide. A killed B for
personal reason, which is unrelated and foreign to piracy. (1 986 Bar
Exam) However, if A w a s r e s isting t he p i r a t e s, and in t h e c ourse
thereof, he accidentally shot and k i l led B, the pir ates are liable for
qualified piracy while A is exempt from crim i nal li ability due to the
circumstance of accident. In t h i s case, there is a di r ect connection
between piracy and homicide.

Mutiny is committed by a member of complement of a vessel or

commotion or disturbance on board a vessel against the authority of
its commander on the high seas or in Philippine waters. (Article 122)
The differences between piracy and mut i ny a re as follows: (1)
i n piracy, the criminal act is tak in g or seizing property wit h i n t e nt
to gain; in m u t i ny , th e cr i m i nal act i s r e sisting th e au t h ori t ies in

where intent to gain is an element; the concept of mutiny is similar
to coercion where intent to gain is not an element; and (3) in piracy
under the Revised Penal Code, the pirate must not be a passenger
or member of the complement of the vessel; however, in piracy under
P.D. No. 582, the pirate is any person; in muti ny, the mutineer must
be a passenger or a member of the complement of the vessel. (196'8

Terrorism is composed of criminal act and cr i m i nal i n t e n t i on

intention to int i m i d ate the general public, create an atmosphere or

Pedro detonated a time bomb in LRT, and caused death and
serious bodilyinjury to several persons, endangers the lifeof others,
a nd causes extensive damage a critical infrastructure. By its natur e
and context, the bombing inti m i d ated the general public and created
an atmosphere or spread a message offear. This is terrorism. Direct
evidence that t h e p u r p ose of P e dro i s t o i n t i m i d at e t h e g e n eral

t hat th e court ca n d e t er m in e t ha t t h e p u r p ose of th e offender i n
detonating a bomb is to inti m i d ate the general public by taking int o

In terrorism u n der R .A. No. 9872, a pr edicate crime such as
murder must c r eate a condition of w i d espread and ex t r aordinary
fear and panic among the populace. However, under R.A. No.11479,
widespread fear tothe populace is not an element of terrorism since
this crime can be committed although the intention of the terrorists
is merely to inti m i d ate "segment" of the general public.

TERRORISM OR DEALING WITH PROPERTY OF DESIGNATED
PERSON
Conspiracy to commit a c r i m e i s p u n i shable only i n c ases in
which the law specially provides a penalty th erefor. (Article 8 of the
Revised Penal Code) Hence, conspiracy to commit terrorism, financing
of terrorism, ordealing with property or funds of designated persons
is punishable because Section 7 of R .A. No. 11479 or Section 5 of
R.A. No. 10168 specifically provides penalty for this crime.
There is conspiracy to commit terrori sm, financing of terrorism
or dealing with property or funds of designated persons when two (2)
or more persons come to an agreement concerning the commission
of such offense and decided to commit it . The concept of conspiracy
under R.A. No. 11479 and R.A. No. 10168 is the same as that under
the Revised Penal Code.
T he penalty fo r t e r r o r i sm, fi n a n cing of t e r r o r ism o r d e al i n g
with pr operty or f u n d s of designated persons is th e same as th at
prescribed for conspiracy to commit thi s crim e.

ATTEMPT TO CO M M IT FINANCING OF TERR O R ISM OR DEALING
W ITH PROPE RTY OF DESIGNATED PERS O N
Any attempt to commit fi n a n cing of terrorism or dealing with
property or f u n d s of designated persons is a c r im e u n der Section
5 of R.A. No. 10168. Since the word " a t t empt" wa s not defined by
law, the concept of attempted felony under Ar t i cle 6 of the Revised
Penal Code can be used in interpreting this word. Hence, there is an
attempt when the offender commences the commission of financing
of terrorism or dealing with property orfunds of designated persons
directly by overt acts, and does not perform all the acts of execution
which sl;ould produce the felony by reason of some cause or accident
other than his own spontaneous desistance.
The penalty for a t t e mpt t o commi t an y c r im e of fi n ancing of
terrorism or dealing w it h p r o perty cr f u n d s of designated persons
is two degrees lower than that prescribed for consummated crime.
Terrorism under R.A. No. 11479 can be committed regardless of
stage ofexecution. Hence, there is no crime of attempted terrorism.

ACCOMPLICE AND ACCESSORY
Principal, accomplice and accessory can be held iable for
financing terrorism, or conspiracy to commit financing of terrorism.
Principal and accessory can be held liable for terrorism. Section 14 of
R.A. No. 11479 and Sections 6and 7 ofR.A. No. 10168 have adopted
the concept of accomplice and accessory under th e R evised Penal
Code. There i s no provision penalizing an accomplice for the crime
of terrorism since the act of an accomplice will be considered as the
crime of providing material support to terrorists under Section 12 of
R.A. No. 11479.

under R.A. No. 6539,possession of loose firearm un der Section 1 of
P.D. No. 1866 and terrorism under R.A. No. 9372 (Human Security

unlawful activity or predicate crime of money laundering. However,
R.A. No. 10175, R.A. No. 10883, R.A. No. 10591 and RA No. 11479
have repealed Section 33(a) of R.A. No. 8792, R.A. No. 6539, Section
1 of P.D. No. 1866, and R.A. No. 11479 respectively, and these new

money laundering.
Under the implementing ru les of R.A. No. 9160, any unlawful

is liable for importation of dangerous drugs and money laundering.
Under Section 6 ofR.A. No. 9160 as amended, any person may be

and the unlawful activity.

Under Section 6 of R .A. No . 9160 as amended, the prosecution of
money laundering shall p r oceed independently of an y p r oceeding
relating to t h u n l a w f u l a c t i v i ty . U n der th e i m p l emen:ing ru les of
R.A. No. 9160, the elements of money laundering are separate and
distinct from the elements of the unlawful activity. The elements of
the unlawful activity, including the identity of the perpetrators and
the details of the commission of the un l a wful activi ty, need not be
established by proofbeyond reasonable doubt in the case for money

2006 Bar Exam Question: Rudy is jobless but is r p u t ed to be
a jueteng operator. He has never been charged or convicted of any
crime. He m a i n t a in s several bank a ccounts and ha s p u r chased 5
houses and lots for his children from the Luansing Realty Inc. Since
he does not have any visible job, the company reported his purchases
t o the Anti -M oney Laundering Council (AM L C). Thereafter, AM L C

Upon request of th e A M L C , t h e b an k d i sclosed to it R u d y's bank

in court for violation of the Anti -M oney Laundering Law. Can Rudy

Rudy has no criminal record. A crim i nal conviction for an unlawful
activity is not a pr erequisite for the instit u t ion of a criminal action
for money laundering. However, the prosecution must show that the
moneys deposited under several bank accounts, and those used in
buying five houses are derived from the proceeds of illegal gambling,
and that accused has knowledge of the involvement of the moneys in

illegal gambling. His reputation as a jueteng operator is not enough

Mayor is also liable for money laundering for acquiring, possessing
and disposing gambling money, provided tha-. he has knowledge
that the money is involved in il legal gambling. The mayor and Don
Gabito are liable for indirect bribery and corruption of public officer,
respectively, since the money was given by the former to the latte r
by reason of his office.

Attempt to commit money laundering is also punishable. Thus,
a drug lord, who was arrested during an entrapment operation while
attempting to deposit drug money in a bank, is liable for attempted
money laundering. (Section 4 of R.A. No. 916'0)

Amy was apprehended and arrested by Patrolman Bart for
illegal parking. She was detained at the police precinct, underwent
investigation, and released only after 48 hours. Under R.A. No. 4186,
or the Land Transportation and Traffic Code, the general procedure
for dealing with a t r af fic violation is not th e ar r est of the offender,
but the confiscation of th e d r i v er's license of the l a t t er. M oreover,

under the Rules of Court, a warrant of arrest need not be issued if
the information or charge was filed for an offense penalized by a fine
only. Itmay be stated as a corollary that neither can a warrantless

arrest be made for traffic violation involving illegal parking since the
penalty for this crime is fine only. (I uz v. People, G.R. No. 197788,
February 29, 2012) Since the arrest is ill e gal, the crime committed
is not delay in the delivery of detained persons to the proper judicial
authorities under Ar t i cle 125, but arbit r ary detention under Arti cle

An election day or a special holiday, should not be included in

of complaint or information in courts in cases of warrantless arrests,
it being a "no-office day." Thus, the complaint for arbitr ary detention

violation of domicile, a public officer must be acting in hi s official
capacity. (U .S. v. Ma c a spac, G.R. N o. 88 7 8, No vember 16, 1 907)
A police officer entered a d w el l in g a gainst th e w i l l o f t h e o w n er ,
the "eof:o collect debt payment. He is liable for trespass to dwelling,
and not arbitr ary detention since the entry was made in his private
capacity.
A priv ate i n d i v i d u al, wh o c onspires w it h a p u b l i c o f ficer i n
committing violation of domicile, is also liable for this crime. Because
of conspi acy, the act of the public officer in commit t ing violation of
domicile is iinputable to the private individual although they are not
similarly situ ated in r elation to the object of the crime. (see: U.S. v.
Ponte, G.R. No. L-5952, October 24, 1911; 1989 Bar Exam)
V iolation of domicile is "om m i t ted by th e p u b lic officer if h i s

committed is rape with the aggravating circumstance of disregard
of dwelling. Violation of domicile is not commi t ted since the entry
was made to rape the victim in hi s pr i v ate capacity. The entry was
not made in connection with his duty as a police officer.
U nlawful E n t r y
To constitute violation of domicile, the entry by the public officer
must be made against the wil l of th e owner of the dwelling, which
presupposes opposition or p r o h i bi t ion by t h e s aid owner, whether
express or impli ed. If th e pu blic officer's entry i nt o th e dwelling is

If a public officer entered the house and made search thereon
either surreptiti ously or without objection from the owner, the entry
is not a violation of domicile because it was not made against the will

made against the will of the owner; however, the "refusal to leave" is

a violation of domicile. (1989 Bar Exam)
A public officer entered the house wit h consent of th e owner
and, thereafter,refused to leave the premises after being required
to do so. Refusal to leave does constitute th e cr im e of vi olation of

Rebellion and T r e a son
The differences between treason, which is an American concept,
and rebellion, which is a Spanish concept, are as follows:
1.
I n t r e a s on, the offender levies war agair st the government
in adherence to an enemy; while in rebellion, the offenders engage in
civil war against the forces of government wi t h out adherence to the
enemy;
Note: The civil war in rebellion is not within the context of war
under in-.ernational law, the condition of which is an in dispensable
element =f treason.
2.
T r e a s on i n cludes giving aid and comfort, in adherence to
the enen y; while giving aid and comfort in adherence to rebels is not
rebellion unless there is a conspiracy;

its common complexion and i s absorbed in th e c r im e of r ebellion,

Geronimo, G.R. No. L-8936, October 28, 1956; Lagman v. Medialdea,
G.R. No. 281658, July 4, 2017)
Not only common crimes may be absorbed in rebellion but also
"offenses under special laws (such as obstruction of justice or illegal
possession of loose firearm), which are perpetrated in furt h erance of
the political offense." All crimes, whether punishable under a special
law or general l aw, w h ich are me re components or ing redients, or
committed in f u r t h e r ance thereof, become absorbed in the crime of
rebellion and cannot be isolated and charged as separate crimes in
themselves. (Lagman v. Medialdea, supra)

amendment of Article 135 does not affectthe accepted concept of
rebellionand these "overt acts of violence" are deemed "subsumed" in
the provision (Article 1-"4) on public and armed uprising, which is an
element of reb l l i on. Hence, the doctrine of absorption is still good.
It is submitted that the opinion of Regalado is the better view.

of rebellion, it could not be validly said that the rebellion is confined
o nly wi t hi n t h e C o u r t's compound. The possibility t h a t t h er e a r e
other rebels positioned in the nearby buil di ngs or compound of the

kidnapping, mass killing, and beheading among others. In contrast,
the purpose of r ebellion i s p o l i t i c al, i. e ., (a) to re m o ve f r om t h e
allegiance to the Philippine Government or its laws: (i) the territory
of the Philippines or any p ar t t h e r eof; (ii) anybody of land, naval,
or armed fcrces; or(b) to deprive the Chief Executive or Congress,
wholly or partially, of any of their powers and prerogatives. (Lagman
v. Medialdea, supra)

Philippine General Hospital (PGH) or the Manila Science High
School (MSHS) could not be discounted. There is no way of knowing
that all p a r t i c i pants in t h e r e b e llion w e nt a n d s t a y ed i n s ide t h e
Court's compound.
Neither could it b e v a l i dly ar g ued th at t he a r m ed contingent

there is n o p u b l i cit y i n t h e i r a c t s as , i n f a ct , t h e y w er e m e r ely
lurking inside the compound of PGH and M S HS. However, it mu st
be pointed out t ha t fo r t h e c r im e of r ebellion to be consummated,
it is not required that al l ar m e d part ic ipants should congregate in
one place, in this c ase, the Court's compound, and publicly r i se in
arms against th e government for th e a t t a i n m ent of t h eir cu l pable
purpose. It suffices that a po r t i on of t he c oritingent g athered and
formed a mass or acrowd and engaged in an armed public uprising
against the government.
Similarly, it c annot be validly concluded that th e gr ounds on
which the armed public upri sing actually took place should be the
measure of the extent, scope or range, of the actual rebellion. This is
logical since the other rebels positioned in PGH, MSHS, or elsewhere,
whose participation did not involve the publicity aspect of rebellion,
may also beconsidered as engaging in the crime of rebellion.

In determining what crime was committed, the ccurt must look
into the ma=n objective of the malefactors. If it is political, such as for
the purpose of severing the allegiance of Mindanao to the Philippine
Government to establish a wilayat therein, the crime is rebellion. If,
on the other hand, the primary objective is to inti m i d ate the general
public, provoke or influence by intim i d a tion the government, create
an atmosph re or spread a message offear, or seriously destabilize
or destroy trie fundamental political, economic, or social structures

N on- m u t u a l l y e x c l u sive c r i m e s —Rebels can be held
liable of reb ll ion and terrorism. In La g m an v. Media.'dea, G.R. No.
231658, Ju r 4, 2017, the Supreme Court stated that there is nothing
in Article 134 of the Revised Penal Code and RA No. 9372 (now RA
No. 11479) which states that r ebellion and terr orism are mu t u ally
exclusive o ea c h o t h er or t h a t t h e y c a n not c o-exist together. RA
No. 9372 (row RA No. 11479) does not expressly or impliedly repeal
Article 134 of the Code. Terrorism cannot absorbs rebellion as they
have different elements.

encounter between policemen in M a n il a and Constabulary soldiers
resulted i n t h e d e at h o f a c o n s t abulary p r i v a te. T h i s e n counter
engendered a deep feeling ofresentment on the part of the soldiers.
They escaped through th e w i n dow of t h ei r q u a r t ers and a t t a cked
the police force. They fired in the direction of a crossroads, killing a
policeman and a civili an. They also fired at a street car, kill ing one
and wounding other p assengers. They at t acked the L u n et a police
station and the office of the secret service. Seventy-seven members

of the Philippine Constabulary were held guilty of sedition. The
o bject of the public and t u m u l t u ous upr i sing is to in fl ict a n act of
hate or revenge upon the person of police officers.
In U.S. v. Lapus, G.R. No. 1222, January 21, 1905, the accused
were members o f a n i l l e ga l a s sociation, c a lled "S a n ta I g l e sia,"
w hich was organized for th e p u r p ose of performing acts of ha t r ed
and vengeance against t h e a u t h o r i t ies an d t h e w e a l th y p e ople.

with death, and t h ereby fr i g h t ening th em. They performed acts of
violence on the persons of the president and other residents of the
town with political-social purposes. The reason for the uprising was
that the rich people were loaning money at usurious terms to their
f arm laborers, and w hen t h e l a t t e r w er e u n a ble t o pa y t h e l o a n ,
t hey compelled their c h i l d ren t o w or k f o r t h e m a s servants (T h i s

public and tumu l t u ous uprising is to inflict an act of hate or revenge
upon private persons (wealthy landowners).
R ebellion and Sed i t i o n
The differences between rebellion and sedition are as follows:
1.
I n r e b e l l i on, there must be public uprising and taking up
arms against the government; in sedition, there must be public and
t umultuous up r i sing by m e ans of f orce, in t i m i d ati on, or b y o t h e r
means outside of legal methods;
2.
I n r e b e l l i on, the purpose of the rebels is political while in
sedition the purpose of the seditionists is either political or social.

constitute rebellion.
In the Hernandez case, the Supreme Court ruled that the word
rebellion is not m e r ely a c h a l l enge to th e constituted au t h ori t i es,
but it involves civil w ar. Civil war p r esupposes engaging in combat
against the forces of the Government, destroying property or committing
serious violence. In sum, if t he p u b l ic aris ing is equivalent to civil
war, the same shall be considered as public and armed uprising, and
thus, the crime is rebellion. If the public upri sing is not equivalent
to civil war, the same shall be considered as public and tumultuous
uprising, and thus, the crime is sedition.

Under the original version of Article 142, inciting to sedition is

by speeches, proclamations, w ritings, e m b l ems, b a n n e rs . T h e
offender must not be a par t i cipant in sedition; otherwise the crime

extol communism and urge the people to hold a national strike and
paralyze commerce and trade,they can be held liable for ir.citing to
sedition. (2011 Bar Exam) I f t he communists rise publicly and take
up arms to overthrow the government, they are liable for rebellion.
Statement "bukas t uloy a n g we l g a natin h a n g g ang s a
magkagulo na" made in presence of his followers justifies the arrest
of the person, who u t t e red it , on t h e b a sis of th e h onest belief of
the arresting officer that he is commit t in g in cit ing to sedition. The
validity of t h e a r r est w a s s u st ained because in t h e b a l a n cing of
authority and freedom of expression,the scale was tilted in favor of
authority but "o nly for purposes of the arrest." (Espiritu v. Lim, G.A.
No. 85727, October 3, 1991) But for purposes of conviction for inciting
to sedition, whether such statements constitute inciting to sedition
or an exercise offreedom of expression is not clear. Applying the
pro reo doctrine, the scales of justice should be tilted in favor of the
accused. Hence, accused is not l i able for in cit ing to sedi=ion. (2011
Bar Exam)
Inciting to R ise Pu b l i c ly
W hat is the proper charge against a person who, without takin g
arms or being in open hostility against the Government, shall incite
others to deprive Congress of itslegislative powers, by means of
speeches or writi n gs? (2012 Bar Exam)

(deprivation of legislative power) but lik ewise to perform the acts of
rebellion. In sum, the offender must also incite them to rise publicly
and to take up arms to deprive legislative power. Thus, this is not
inciting to rebellion because he did not incite them to r ise publicly
and to take up arms.

of inciting to sedition, the speech or scurr i l ous libels must h ave a
seditious tendency. The phrases "tend to disturb or obstruct," "tend
to instigate others," and "lead or tend to stir up the people" in Article

the controlling r u l e i n d e t er m i n in g i f t h e s p eeches, utterances or

According to Dean An t onio Gregorio, the dangerous tendency
rule and not the clear and present danger rule is generally adopted
i n the Phi l i p p ines regarding sedition cases. It i s e n ough t hat t h e
words used may tend to create the danger of public uprising. It is not
necessary thatthere be a clear and present danger of the substantive
evil which the law aims to prevent.

Se di t i o u s Speech —In People v. Nabong, G.R. No. 36426,
November 3, 1932, at a necrologicalservice on the occasion of the
death of acommunist leader, accused delivered a speech as follows:

To commit i n c i t in g t o s edition of th e fi r s t f o rm , th e offender

attain any of the ends of sedition. (People v. Arrogante, 39 O.G. 1974)
In sum, the offender must incite others not only to prevent Congress
from freely exercising its function but l i k e w ise to rise publicly and
tumultuously. Thus, this is not incit ing to sedition of the first
r s foo r m
b e cause he did not incite them to rise publicly and tum uu,l t ullous

ought to be united to suppress that abuse. Overthrow the present
government and establish our own government, the government
of the poor. Use your whip so that there may be marks on their
sides."

However, this is i n ci t in g t o sedition of th e second form sin ce

P.D. No. 1866 as amended by R.A. No. 10591 is wrong since R.A. Nc.
10591 is not an amendatory law. The proper charge should be illegal
possession of loose firearm u n der R .A. No. 10591.
L oose Fir e a r m
The concept of loose firearm u n d e r R .A . No . 10 591 is br oader
than that of unlicensed firearm under the repealed P.D. No. 1866.

Possession of Loose Firearm
The unlawful acquisit ion and possession of loose firearms an d

ammunition is a crime. (Section 29 of R.A. No. 10591

)

A was sleeping on the fioor. Immediat ely beside him was a clutch

and that he was not in actual possession thereof at the t im e he was
arrested. (2000 Bar Exam) His argument is untenable. The rule
is that ow n er ship i s no t a n e s sential e l em ent of i l l e gal p ossession

s ince the same is under h:s contr ol. Possession wit hi n t h e m e a n i n g
of R.A. No. 10591 includes not onl y a c t ual p h y sical possession but
also constructive possession or th e s u bjection of th e t h i n g t o o ne' s
control and man agement. (People v. De Gracia, supra)
A security agency delivered to X, it s security gu ard, a firear m .
X was arrested forpossession of loose firearm. It turned out that the

agency has no license for said firearm. (1972 Bar Exam) Although
possessicn of loose firearm is malum prohibitum, knowledge that
the firearm is unlicensed is indispensable to make the possessor
criminally i a ble under R.A. No. 10591. The obligation to obtain
l icense for fi r e ar m t o b e u s e d b y s e c u r it y g u a r d s b e l ongs t o t h e

Chowdury, G.R. No.129577-80, February 15, 2000, lack of knowledge
of the failure to register th e accused as an employee of the licensed
recruitment agency wit h —.he POEA was considered as a defense in
illegal recrui t m e nt , w h ich is also classified as malum in se.
Although p o ssessior o f l o o s e fi r e ar m i s m al u m p r o h i b i t u m ,
knowledge that t h e fir e a r m is s u ed by t h e a g e ncy is u n l i c e nsed is

under her custody is detrime ntal to him. In support of this allegation,
he attached a picture depicting M a ri a i n j ecting cocaine in her body.
H owever, the t r u t h i s t h a t M a r i a w a s i n j e ct in g gl u t a t h i one in h e r
body, and that itwas Pedro, who bought that substance. Although
the allegation that " M a r i a is a dr ug" is defamatory, Pedro cannot be
held liable for libel since he has the absolute privil ege to communicate
to the court al l m a t t e r s , w h ic h ar e r e l evant t o t h e c ase. As st at ed
in Choa case, t he pur po se of t he pr i v i l e ged communication r u l e i s

to criminal action for perjury for asserting falsehood in the petition,
then th e r e q u i r e m en t o f v e r i fi c a t ion w i l l b e r e n d e red u s eless. In
sum, while the peti t i oner has an absolute pr i v i l ege to communicate

he has no pri v i l ege to allege unt r u t h f u l m a t t e r s t h e r e in. As st at ed
in the case of Choa, certainly, petitioner (who is charged with perjury)
cannot seek refuge under the absolutely privileged communication rule
since the false statements he made in hi s pe tit ion for n a t u r a l i z a t io n
has instead made a mockery of the admi n i s t r a tion ofj ustice.
Pedro filed a verified complaint for collection of money against
M aria. Pedro a l l eged i n t h e c o m p l a in t t h a t M a r i a , a d r u g a d d i ct ,

this allegation, he attached contract of loan, and a picture depicting

was injecting gl u t a t h i one in h e r b o dy , an d t h a t i t w a s P e d ro, wh o

require a complaint for collection of money to be verifi ed. However,
Pedro is liable for libel since his allegation is defamatory. He cannot '
invoke the pr i n ci ple of absolute pri v i l eged communi cation since the
defamatory statement that Maria is a drug addict is not material

Besides, the balance was deposited in escrow. Even if SE C decides
adversely against X, there is no perjury because the falsehood was

IV. CRIMES AGAINST PUBLIC INTEREST

In People v. Hilvano, G.R. No. L-8583, July 31, 1956, a councilor
d ischarged the du t ies of an a b sent m a yor over th e objection of t h e
vice-mayor. He appointed policemen, solemnized marriages and
c ollected the corresponding salary fo r m a y or . A ccused is not l i a b l e
for usurpation of executive power u n der A r t i cl e 240 of th e Revised
Penal Code because only a j u d ge can commi t t h i s c r i m e . H o w ever,
he is liable for usur p a t ion of function of a person in au t h or it y u n d er
Article 177 thereof.

Usurpation of author it y or official function is commit ted by any
person. Usurpa ti on of legislative power is commi t t e d by a ny p u b l i c
officer. Usurpat ion of executive fun cti ons can only be commi t ted by
a judge. Usurp at ion of j u d i cial f u n c t i ons can only be commi t ted by
an executive off cer.

USURPATION OF JUDICIAL FUNCTIONS
Usurpation of j u d i c ia l f u n c t i ons is commi t t e d by an o ff ic er of
the executive br anch of th e Govern m ent wh o sh all a ssume ju di cial

Mayor is an executive officer. Hence, he can commit usu r p a t i on
of judicialfunction (Munez v.Arino, A.M ¹. MTJ-94-985, February

2008) such as issuing a wa r r an t of ar r est (M u n ez v. Arin o, supra)
A clerk of court is not an officer of the executive branch. Hence,
he cannot be held liable for usurp at ion of judicial function for issuing
the arrest of an accused in a c r i m i n a l c ase. (Albior v. A u g u i s, A. M.

effect of the inclusion in the proposal to amend the phrase j 'ustifiable
grounds."
P reserv a t io n of th e I n t e g r i t y o f t h e C o n fi s c a ted D r u g s
The integrity of the evidence is presumed to be preserved unless
there is a showing of bad faith, ill w i ll , or proof that the evidence has
b een tampered with . To overcome a presumpt ion of regular it y in t h e
handling of exhibits by public officers, the accused has the burden to
show that the evidence has been tampered with. (People v. Miran d a ,

Justifiable Grounds for Not Comply ing wit h th e Th r ee-Wit n ess

The justifiable grounds for n on -compliance must be pr oven as
facts, because the Court cannot pr esume what t h ese ground
roun s a r e, or

oapp Iy,

Purchasing or s e l l i n g a h u m a n b ei n g f o r t h e p ur p o s e o f
enslaving him is slavery. However, the offender can be prosecuted
for traf6cking in p ersons. Giving or receiving of payments or benefits
to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person
is a means to coinmit t r af fi ck in g in p er sons.
Traf6cking in persons may be committed also by means of
taking adva ntage of the persons' vulnerability as mi n o rs ( People v.
De Dios, G.R. ¹ . 28 4 0 1 8,tu n e 6, 2 018) or as a pe rson, who needs
money. Before, human trafficking is punishable as slavery where
lack of consent of the victim i s an element. H ow ever, because of the
d ifficulty of p r o v in g sl av ery s i nce t h er e ar e occasions that v i c t i m s

Acts of tr a f fick in g comm i t t e d for ex pl oit iv e p u r p ose against a
child, or when the adoption is ind uced by any form of consideration,
shall also be considered as 'traffick ing in persons' even if they do not

Since the victims are m i n or , means to commit t r a f f i ck ing such
as threat or use of force, coercion, or f r aud ne ed not be established
by evidence. Even wi t h out th e use of coercive, abusive, or deceptive
means, a minor's consent is not recognized by law, (People v. A guirre,
G.R. No.219952, November 20, 2017) or shall not be considered as
having been given out of his or her own free will. (People v. Ramirez,

of taking adv an t age of the persons' vulnerability as min o rs. Accused

Malfeasance is th e p e r f or m a nce of some act w h i c h o u gh t not

temporary perform a nce of public functi ons is sufficient to constitute
a person a public official. A laborer in the Bure au of Post temporarily
detailed as filer of money orders is a public officer. (Maniego v. People,

Gift s olicited by P u b l i c O ff ic e r
The police officer requested solici,ted or demanded money from

are two possible scenarios in the case, to wit:

T h e c r i m i n a l v o l u n t a r i l y gr a n t e d th e re q uest, a nd g a v e

bribery is aformal crime. The essence of direct bribery of the first

has no attempted stage because there is no such thing as an "attempt
to agree." However, the police officer is liable for violation of Section

It should be clarified that "private practice" =f a profession

requires the application of law, legal procedure, knowledge, training

acts which are characteristics of the profession. Generally, to practice
law is to give notice or r e n der an y k i n d o f ser vice, which device or

malum prohibi t um, meaning that the prohibited act is not inherently

to a public use other than t h a t for w h ich th e fun d was appropri at ed
by law or o r d i n a n ce. T h us , a n a c cused acqui t te d o f m a l v e r sation

In Rabe v. Flo res, Adm. M a t t e r N o . P - 97-1247, May 1 4, 1 997,
the requirement for p u b lic officers, in general, to divest th e m selves
o f business interests upon assumpt ion of a public office is prom t d
y the need to av oi d conflict of i n t e r e sts. H ow ever, in t h e a b sence
of any shoiving t h a t a b u s i n ess in terest w il l r e s ul t i n a c o n f.'ict of
interest, divestment of the same is unnecessary. In the present case, it
seems a bit far -fetched to im a gine that t h er e is a conflict of in-.crest
because an Int er p r eter II I o f th e Regional T r ia l C o ur t ha s a stall in

Thus, she is not liable under Section 9 of R.A. No. 6713 for fail ure to
divest herself of the business interest. However, respondent is liable
under Section 8 of R.A. No. 6713 for fail ur e to disclose such int erest

ABANDONM ENT OF OFFICE OR POSITION
Abandonment of office or position is committed by a public officer
who abandons hi s of fice b efore th e a c ceptance of h i s r e s i g n ati on

c rimes against the law of nat i ons, and certain cr i mes against publi c

T he cri mes m e n t i o ned i n A r t i c l e 2 3 8 w h i c h t h e o f f e n der i n
quali6ed abandonment of office has the duty to prevent, prosecute or
punish pertain to all cr i mes against n a t i onal securit y (e.g., treason)
and law of nati ons (e.g., piracy). But w i t h r e s pect to cri mes against
public disorder, —.hey are only confined to t h ose covered by Chapter

1, Title 8 of Book 2 of the Revised Penal Code such as rebellion, coup
d'ctat, sedition, c onspiracy or p r o p o s al to co m m i t r e b e l l i o n, c oup
d' etat, and conspiracy to commit s e ditio n.
Abandonment of office to evade the duty to prosecute treason is
qualifiedabandonment of office. (2002 Bar Exam) Abandonment of
office to evade the duty to prosecute direct assault is also punishable
under Arti cle 238 since it i s d e t r i m e n ta l t o t h e p u b li c service. But
the crime is not qualified abandonment of office since direct assault
is not a crime against pu b li c disorder covered by Chapter 1, Ti tl e 3
of Book 2 of the Revised Penal Code.
To avoid trying cases for rebellion filed against alleged members

of the Maute group, the judge of the court. where the case is pending
tendered his resignation to the Supreme Court and immediately went
to the United St ates of Am er ica w i t h ou t w a i t i n g for th e acceptance
of his resignation. The crime commi t ted is qualified abandonment of
office because rebellion wh ich th e j u dge has the dut y t o p u n ish is a
crime against pub lic disorder covered bv Ch apter 1, Ti tl e 3 of Book

2 of the Revised Penal Code.
If the pu b li c officer di d no t a b a n don hi s office, but h e evaded
h is duty to pr osecute a cr im e such as r ebellion, he is l i a ble for t h e
crime of tolerance.

W heel Conspi r a c y
Under the wheel or circle conspiracy, there is a single person or
group (the hub) dealing in di v i d u a lly w it h t w o or m ore other persons
or groups (the spokes). (Fernan, Jr. v. People, G.R. No. 145927, August
24, 2007) In w h eel conspiracy i n v olv in g p l u n d er , th e p u b li c officer
(main plunderer or the hub) amasses, accumulates and acquires illg otten wealth i n conn i v ance with o t h er s (the spokes). The rim t h a t
enclosed the spokes was the common goal in th e overall conspiracy,
i.e., t he amassing, accumulati on and acquisition of ill-gotten wealth.
Hypothetical problem: Pedro, the President of the P hi l i p p i n e s,
conspired with A , p r i v a t e i n d i v i d u al , in connection w it h h i s sh ar es
o n the jueteng collections in th e am ount of P40 mi l l i on; and wit h B ,

out of these t r a n sactions. T hi s i s n o t a s i n g l e c onspiracy because
t he conspiracy of th e P r e sident w i t h A i n c o n n e ction w it h j u e t e n g
c ollections is different from his conspiracy with B in connection wit h
h is commission. Thi s i s a w h e e l c onspiracy since th e P r e sident i s

dealing with A and B individually. The President is the hub while A
and B are spokes. Since there is w h eel conspiracy in t h i s case, the
total amount of P80 mil l ion acquired by the President, A and B shall
be considered for p u r p oses of determ i n i n g i f P 5 0 - m i l l ion t h r e shold
amount had been reached. Since the total amount of ill-gotten wealth
acquired by P r e sident, A a n d B i s P 8 0 m i l l i on , t h e y ar e l i a bl e for
p lunder. Al t h o ugh th e P r e sident m e r ely acquired i l l - gotten w ealt h

acquired P40 m i l l i on . S i nce th e P r e sident i s l i a bl e for p l u n d er, A

a n abortion w it h v i o l ence against th e p r e gnant w o m an , or w i t h o u t

causing the same; or (5) by a p h a r m a cist w h o , w i t h ou t t h e p r o p er

Abortion is commit ted by employing violence upon the pregnant

to cause abortion, and as a result th ereof, the fetus dies, either in th e
w omb or after h a v in g been expelled th erefr om; or by k i l l i n g a n o n v iable fetus outside the mat er nal w o mb. Abortion can be committ ed

determining the viabil it y of the fetus, to wit: testimony of expert and
intrauterine life of the fetus.

E x pe r t t e s t i m o n y — R e gardless of t he d u r a t i o n o f i t s

the fetus are already fully developed to sustain an i n d ependent lif e,
t he court can consider the fetus as viable alt h ough hi s i n t r a u t e r i n e

Prior to R.A. No. 8049, good faith is a defense in homicide where
the victim is kil led dur ing hazing. The consent of the victim and lack
of intent to k il l on th e part of th e accused would negate dolo, which
is an import ant element of homicide. Hence, the crime commit ted is
only reckless impru d ence resulting in h o m i cide. (Vill a r e al v. People,
G.R. No. 151258, February 1, 2012) Now, the participants of hazing
with or wi t h out d olo are liable for hazing un der R.A. No. 8049 if the
neophyte died as a consequence thereof.
Instead of amending the Revised Penal Code, which penalizes
intentional f el ony cl assified as m a l a in s e w h e re l a ck of d o l o is a
d efense, th e C o n g r ess cr eated a s p e cial l a w o n h a z i n g , f o u n d ed
upcn the pri n ciple of ma lum pr o h i b i t um wh e re lack of dolo is not a
defense.
T he deliberation of the Senate shows that w hat is i m p or t ant i s
not the intention to kill th e neophyte dur in g hazing but the result of
the act of hazing. Recognizing the m a lum pr o h i b i t u m cha ra cteristic
of hazing, R.A. No. 8049 provides that any person charged with the
said crime shall not be enti t led to th e m i t i g a t in g cir cum st ance that
there was no intent ion to commit so grave a wr on g.

Also, the framers of the law intended that the consent of the
vic:im to be inj u red shall not be a defense in hazing. The very act of

committed is theft wit h t h e qualifying circumstance of abuse of

of "casa habitado" o in h a b i t e d house.(People v. Jarariil l a, L-28547,

The penalty for r o bbery in a n i n h a b i ted h ouse is lesser where

w here none of th e offenders are a r m e d .
(Article 299 of the Revised

The main r eason why th e law p r o v i des a provision on robbery

will use the same in h u r t i n g t h e occupants of th e i n h a b i ted house.
The intention of the law is to discourage arming by i m p osing a high
p enalty i f t h e o f f e r d e r i s a r m e d . O n t h e o t h e r h a n d , i n r o b b e r y

an uninhabited house that can be hurt by th e offender, the law does
not consider being armed as a basis of imposing penalty

Taking in Robbery by Using Force upon Things
Article 293 of the Revised Penal Code uses the wo rd "t a k e" in
definingi'obbery by using force upon things. The concept of "taking"
in theft or robbery by means of violence or int i m i d a t ion is the same
as that inrobbery by using force upon things. Like theft and robbery
by means of v i ol ence or i n t i m i d a t i on , a b i l it y t o f r e el y d i s pose the
p roperty an d a sport a t ion (carr y in g a w ay ) ar e no t e l e m ents of t h i s
robbery by using force upon things. Hence, taking out the property
from the building is not important to consummate robbery by

not presented in court. A f ter a ll , th e pr operty st olen may h ave been
abandoned or thrown away and destroyed by the robber or recovered

to be proven. The motive forrobbery can exist regardless of the exact
amount or value involved. (People v. Ebet, G.R. No. 181 68o, November

victim did not commit a cr ime and he is inti m i d a t ed with a r r e st and
prosecution to deprive him of his personal property; direct briberv is
committed when the victim h as commit t ed a crime and gives money
or gift to avoid arr est or pr osecution.
However, Florenz Regalado argued that the correct basis of the
distinction between robbery and direct bribery iswhether the giver
of bribe did so volunt ar i ly , in w h ich case it is bribery; or that he gave
the sum or gift by r eason of force or int i m i d a t i on, in w h ich case it is
robbery.
It issubmitted that the better view is that of Regalado. In. U.S.

Form ation of Band and Com m i ssion of Robbery

Formation of brigandage on the highway is covered by Article
8 06 of t h e R e v i sed P e na l C o de, bu t n o t b y P . D . N o . 5 8 2 . M e r e
formation of band of brigands is not pu n i shable under P.D. No. 582.

Hence, the brigands by forming a band on the highway shall be
prosecuted for brigandage under the Code.

Actual commission of robbery on th e h i ghway by br igands
or highway robbers is covered by Article 306 of the Code and P.D.
No. 532. However, in People v. Puno, G.R, No. 97471 F b
e ruary 17,
1993 ,t the Supreme Court saidthat P.D. No. 582 has amended the
provision on brigandage by increasing the penalty. Thus, if the acts
o highway robbers violate Article 306 of the Code and P.D. No. 582,
they shallbe prosecuted forhighway robbery/brigandage under P.D.
No. 582 and notbrigandage under the Revised Penal Code.
In summary, formation ofband of brigands or highway robbers
constitutes brigandage under the Revised Penal Code. On the other
and, actual commission of robbery or seizure of person for extortion
on the highway by br i g ands or highway robbers constitute hi ghw ay robbery/brigandage under P.D. No. 532.

Qualified Carnapping
The penalty for carnapping is higher when the owner, driver,
or occupant of the carnapped motor vehicle is killed or raped in the
commission of the carnapping, (Section 3 of R.A. ¹. 108 8 8) The
killing (or rape) merely qualifies the crime of carnapping, which for
lack ofspecificnomenclature may be known as qualified carnapping
or carnapping in an aggravated form. (People v. Mej ia, G.R. Nos.

H owever, qualified car n ap pin g i s a ct u a ll y a s p ecial complex cr i m e
since the law prescribes a single penalty for commi t t i n g tw o cri m es,

CATTLE-RUSTLING UNDER P.D. NO. 533
S tealing l a r g e c a t tl e w a s p u n i s hed a s q u a l i f ied t h ef t u n d e r
Article 210 of the Revised Penal Code. Now this act constitutes cattlerustling under P.D. No. 588. Cattle-rustling is the taking away by any
means, method or scheme, with out th e consent of th e owner/raiser,
of any of the large cattle whether or not for profit or gain, or whether
c ommitted w it h o r w i t h ou t v i o l ence against or i n t i m i d a t ion of a n y
person or force upon th i n gs. It i n cl u des the ki l l in g of large cattle, or
taking its meat or hi ding wi t h out th e consent of the owner/raiser.
Every person h a v in g i n

h i s p o ssession, control or c u s t ody of

large cattle shall, upon demand by competent authorities, present
certificate of ownership, permit t o b u y o r s e l l l a r g e cattle or
clearance for shipment of large cattle. Failure to exhibit the required
documents shall be prim a' facie evidence that the large cattles in his
possession, control orcustody are the fruits of the crime of cattlerustlin g.
L arge Ca t t l e
Large cattle shall i n c l ude th e cow, carabao, horse, mule, ass,

or other domesticated member of the bovine family. The owner
includes the h er d sm an, caretak er, em pl oyee or t e n a nt of a ny f ir m

or entity engaged in the raising of large cattle or other persons in
lawful possession of such large cattle.
Horse isnot considered a cattle because it is a member of Equidae
family, and not of the Bovine family. However, P.D. No. 588 expressly
mentions a "h orse" as l a rge cattle. Th us, h orse shall be t r e ated as
large cattle for p u r p oses of the cr i me of c att l e-rustling because the

law says so.
Stealing goats is simple theft. The crime of cattle rustl ing is not
committed since goats are not l a r g e catt le. The t er m " l a r g e cattl e"

includes carabaos, horses, mules, asses, and all members of the
bovine family. According to the dictionary, the word "bovine family"

Under Section 8 of P.D. No. 538, if a person is seriously injured
or killedas a result or on the occasion of the commission of cattlerustling, the imposable penalty for cattle-rustling is higher. This is
a special complex crime of cattle-rustling with homicide or serious
physical injuries. It can likewise be called qualified cattle-rustling.
However, there is no special complex crime of cattle rustling with
rape. Moreover, i t i s n o t r e q u i r e d t h a t t h e v i c t i m o f h o m i c id e or

ESTAFA BY PRETE N D ING TO HAVE BRIBED A PUBLIC OFFICER
Estafa thr ough false pretense is also commit ted by any person
who shall defraud another by falsely pretending to possess influence

over a public officer (Article 815, par. 2(ag), or to have bribed a
public officer (Ar t i c le 815, par. 2(cj), wh i ch a re e xecuted prior to o r

Filing a case for es-.afa by pretending to have bribed a
government em p l oyee is w i t h ou t p r e j u d ice to th e r i gh t o f o f f ended

In sum, the victim defrauded and such publicofficer defamed by the
representation t h a t h e w a s b r i b e d can su e th e o f f ender for e st af a
and defamation, respectively.
If the accused actually bribed the public officer using the money
of the complainant, he should be acquit ted for estafa t h r o ugh f al se
pretense. However, the accused and complain ant can be prosecuted
in another case for corru p t ion of public officer as prin cipal by di r ect

A rticle 315(2)(a). There m ust b e ev i d ence that t h e p r e t ense of t h e

comply with th e agreement that he w il l convince the judge to acquit
the accused does not justify a conclusion that M a l o has no influ ence
over the judge. (see: People v. Wilson Yee, C.A., 55 O.G. 1228)

Neither is Malo liable for estafa under Article 315(2)(c) since
he did not d e f r au d a n o t her b y f a l s ely p r e t en din g t o h av e br i bed a

Hence, tthe

simple loan and not trust receipt. Failure to perform obligation under
this loan agreement is neither estafa th r ough m i s appropri at ion nor
a violation of th e t r u s t r e ceipt l a w . T o r u l e o t h e r w ise is t o v i ol at e
the constitu t i onal pr ovi sion on non-im p r i sonment by r eason of nonpayment of d e bt. (Ng v. Pe o ple, G.R. N o. 17 8 9 05, Apr il 23 , 2 0 1 0 ;

arrival of the t i r es, Julio sold them bu t di d not del iver th e pr oceeds

to the bank. Julio is liable for estafa through misappropriation in
relation to P.D. No. 115, (1988 and 1995 Bar Exams)
The obligation of the entrustee under the trust receipt agreement
is to turn over the proceeds of sale of the entrusted goods, or return
the unsold goods to the entruster. Violation of this undertaking
constitutes estafa in relation to the trust receipt law. On the other
hand, the obligation of th e entrustee-debtor under the le tter of
credit is to pay the bank the amount owing to it. Violation of this
undertak in g constit u tes a cause of action for collection of money.
T urning over th e p r o ceeds of sale is a d e f ense in v i o l a t ic n of
trust r eceipt law (B a n k of C o m m e rce v. Serrcn o, G.R N o . 15 1 8 95,
February 16; 2005) and in civil c ase for collection of money.
Returning the unsold goods is a compliance with th e obligation
under the trust receipt but not that u n der the letter of credit. Hence,
returning the unsold goods to the bank is a defense in a criminal case
for estafa in relation to the trust receipt law but not in a civil case for
collection of the amount covered by letter of credit. The bank did not
become the real owner of the un sold goods, which were tu r ned over
b y the debtor. The bank merely acquired securitv t i tl e over retu r n e d
g oods for obligation u n der t h e l e t ter of cr edit . Th e debtor r e m a i n s
the owner of the retur ned goods and holds it at his own ri sk. (Vintola

v. Insular Bank of Asia and America, G.R. No. L-78671, March 25,
1 988) The debtor can st il l s ell th e g oods to a cu stomer despite th e
same are already in t he possession of the banl-.
P.D. No. 115 is not in conflict with the constit u t i o nal prohibi t i on
a gainst impr i sonment for non-payment of debt. The criminal liabil i t y
springs from the violation of the tr ust r eceipt, which is separate and

distinct from the loan transaction. (Lee v. Rodil, G.R. No. 80644, July
5, 1989) The Trust Receipts Law punishes the dishonesty and abuse

In Chua-Bu r ce v. CA, ibid., the accused was acquitted of estafa

Deposit involving money without obligation to return the very

Estafa
Complex crime of estafa t h r o ugh f a l sification of documents is
committed when one falsifies certain documents to be able to obtain
money or goods from another person. In other words, the falsification
is a necessary means of commit t in g estafa. However, if falsification
is committed to conceal the misappropri a t i on, two separate offenses
of estafa and falsification are commit t ed. (Patula v. PeopLe, G.R. No.

not violated since the check was not issued for a valid consideration.
Moreover, the exempt in g c i r c u m st ance of u n contr ollable fear of a
greater injury can be considered.
In Ma g no v. C A, G . R. No. 9 6132, June 2 6, 1992, the accused
obtained loan from a lending company to be used as warranty
deposit for leasing equipment f rom a l easing company. The deposit
is refundable upon term i n a t ion of the lease agreement. The accused
i ssued a c h eck t o g u a r a n t e e hi s l o an . T h e l e ase a greement w a s
terminated and th e equi p m ent l e ased was ret u r ned to th e l easing

is an officerof both the lending company and leasing company. The
warranty d eposit should h av e been r ef u n ded to th e accused since
the lease agreement wa s t e r m i n a t ed . Si nce th e w a r r a nt y d e posit
is refundable, it could not be t r e ated as chargeable to the accused.
T hus, th e c h ec k c o v er in g s u c h w a r r a n t y d e p o sit , w h i c h i s n o t

b een issued for a value or to apply on account. Using the ut i l i t a r i a n
doctrine instead of the mala prohib ita pr i n c ip le, the Supreme Court
acquitted the accused.

There are two forms of violation of B.P. Blg. 22. The first for m

Issuance
Issuance means first d e l i v ery, p h y sically or co n structively, of
a check complete in its form to the person who takes it as a holder.
An essential element of "issuance of the check" is that the check
delivered must be complete in its form. To consider a check complete

in its form, it m u s t be im m e dia tely demandable. A postdated check

The physical delivery of a po stdated check, which i s i n complete in

equivalent to issuance thereof.

(People v. Reyes, G.R. No. 1 57 943, September 4, 2018) Issuance of
bouncing check to cover pre-existing obligation is not estafa.

The issuance of present-dated check is the physical delivery of
the said check complete in it s f or m t o th e p erson who t a kes it as a
holder. On the other h a nd, the issuance of a postdated check is the
c onstructive delivery of the said check complete in its form upon it s

i mportant t ha t t h e accused knows the in sufficiency of funds on th e
date of issuance. Hence, the check must be unfu n ded on the date of
issuance thereof. In connection with th e th i rd element of violation of
B.P. Blg. 22, it is import ant t ha t th e fund is insufficient to cover the
check on the date of presentment, and as a consequence, the check
was dishonored by the bank. Hence, thecheck must be unfunded on
the date of presentment th ereof. In sum, in vi olation of B.P. Blg. 22,
t he check must be un f u n ded at th e t i m e of it s i s suance and at t h e
t ime of its presentment for payment or deposit wit h th e bank .
But for pu r p oses of the val i d it y of i n f o r m a t i on, it i s sufficient

2. D a te of Postdating or Maturity — In postdated check,
the date of physical delivery thereof is not the date of issuance since
when the check was physically delivered, it is incomplete in its form
for not being payable upon demand, which is an essential character
of a check. Thus, the date of issuance is the date when the check was
constructively delivered t o the payee upon its matu r i t y .

delivery. Conversely, in estafa th r ough issuance of bouncing h k
c i gc e c ,
thee caccused must have knowledge of the insufficiency of funds at the
time of it s p ostdating or p h y s ical deliv ery, an d not o n t h e d at e of
issuance, matur it y or constructive delivery .

Under Ar t i cl e 815 of th e Revised Penal Code, estafa t h r o u gh

sufhcient to cover the amount of the check. The letters of Article 815
show that th e check has no fund, or in sufficient f un d at th e t im e of
the postdating.
Estafa thr ough issuance of bouncing check, the postdating o r
t e physical delivery o f a check must be the efficient cause of parting
o f money or p r operty of t h e o f f ended par t y .
(People v. Reyes, G.A.
No. 1$7948, September 4, 2018) The essence of this crime is deceit.

623

Hence, it is important t hat at the time that the accused is convincing
the complainant to part hi s pr operty or m oney, the former is awar e
that the check is unfun ded and his int en t ion is to defraud the latt er
by postdating and phy sically delivering th e check. In S a les v. Hon.
Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-47817, August 29, 1988, accused was
acquitted of estafa t h r o ugh i s suance of bouncing check because of
the failure on th e par t of th e p r osecution to show t hat t h e accused
had insufficient funds in the bank to cover the checks at the time she
p ostdated (and physically delivered) them to the complainant .
On January 1, 1990, X physically delivered a check dated
February 1, 1990 in payment of goods sold and delivered tohim by
A. Unfort u n at ely, the check when presented on its mat u r it y d ate or
February 1, 1990 bounced for lack of sufficient fu n ds. X is liable for
violation of B.P. Blg. 22 since postdated check is covered by this law.
Knowledge of insufficiency of funds on the date of issuance (date of
maturity or constructive delivery or Febru ar y 1, 1990 ) is presumed
if X failed to make good of the check wi t hi n f ive bank ing days upon
r eceipt of n o t ice of d i s h onor. H o w ever, X i s n o t l i a b l e fo r e s t a f a
through issuance of bouncing check since there is no showing that on
January 1, 1990 orthe date of postdating or physical delivery of the
check is already unfu n ded, and despite of the unfun ded condition of
the check, X used it t o defr aud A. Since on January 1, 1990, A sold
a nd delivered th e goods to X, i t i s i m p o r t an t t o e s t ablish t ha t t h e
mind of X on t ha t d at e is to defraud A by p o stdating check despite

knowledge ofits unfunded condition. (1990 Bar Exam)
The criminal mind of the offender should be adjudged at the
time of the postdating and physical delivery of the check and not
when the check was pr esented for pa y m e nt . F a i l ur e t o m ak e good
o f the checks at t h e t i m e o f i t s p r e s entm ent f o r p a y m en t i s n o t
evidence that the mind of the accused is criminal when he postdated
them. The crimin a l it y of an act should not depend on a future event.
Unfulfilled promise is not the fraud or deceit contemplated in Ar t i cl e
815 of the Revised Penal Code.
On June 1, 2011, X bought a car from a company and paid

to return t h e c ar, bu t h e r e f u sed. X is not l i a ble for carnapping or

B.P. Blg. 22. (BPI v. Suarez, G.R. No. 167750, March 15, 2010) Like
Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code, B.P. Blg. 22 also speaks only of
insufficiency of funds and does not treat of uncollected deposits. The
law cannot be int er p r eted in such a wa y as to expand its pr ovision
to encompass the situation of uncollected deposits because it would
m ake the la w m o r e on erous on th e p ar t o f t h e a c cused. Cri m i n a l
statutes are strictly construed against the Government and liberally
in favor of the accused. (Dy v. People, G.R. ¹. 15 8 8 1 2,November 14,

notwithst an ding bank p olicy against such pr actice and the specific
instruction from hi s superior to stop givin g D A U D a c commodation
a nd despite her k n o w l edge that p r i o r c h ecks deposited by he r c o accused turned out to be unfu n ded. These circumstances show that
the accused in conspiracy wit h h r c o - accused defrauded the bank .
In fact, there was one check where proceeds of its wi t h d r a wal w ent

of estafa.

D A I F a n d St o p Pa y m e n t —The crime of violation of first

by the accused is subsequently c i sh onored by th e d r a wee bank for
insufficiency of funds or credit or would have been dishonored for the

What is required under the law and jurisprudence so as not
to deprive the accused of his right to avert crim i nal prosecution
for violation of B.P. Blg. 22 is notice of dishonor and not demand
letter. Thus, lack of demand letter is not a defense in violation of
B.P. Blg. 22. (2014 Bar E x a m) H o w e ver, a demand letter m a y

I n estafa, if t h er e i s n o n o t ice of d i shonor, deceit as an
element of estafa, is not presumed. But despite the lack of notice,
the accused can be convicted of estafa since the prosecution can
still prove the existence of deceit. For example, if th e accused
knows that h i s c h ecking account i s c l osed, and d espite such

is still liable for estafa despite lack of notice of dishonor, which
is not an element of t hi s cr i me. (see: Lopez v. People, G.R. No.

only fair t ha t th e letter contain ing the notice of dishonor must

Other than provmg that the accused received the notice of

Exertir g efforts to reach an amicable settlement wit h h er

Payment
Payment is a mode of extinguishing civil liabili t y, but it is not a
mode of criminal exti n ction li sted in A r t i cle 89 of the Revised Penal
Code. But payment may be used as adefense in violation of B.P. Blg.

regardless of the strength of the evidence offered by the prosecution.

v. Cruz, G.R. No. 154128, February 8, 2007)
Payment of a check after the fil in g of Inform a t ion is not a
defense in B.P. Blg. 22. Since there is no showing of int enti on
to mitigate or t ot ally a l l evi ate the il l e f fects of his issuance of
the unfunded check, then th ere is no equitable and compelling
reason to preclude the prosecution of accused. In such a case,
the letter of the law should be applied to its full extent. (Lim v .
People, supra)
2. P a y m e n t in Estafa — In estafa, damage and deceit are
the essential elements, and the check is merely the accused's tool in
committin g deceit that causes damage to the complainant. I n s u ch
a case, paying th e v a lu e of th e d i sh onored check w il l n o t f r e e t h e
a ccused from criminal liabil i ty . It will merely satisfy the civil liabilit y
of the crime but not the crim i nal li abi l i ty . (Li m v. People, supra ) The
l aw puni shes the offended because of the cr i m i n a l it y i n h i s m i n d ,
which had manifested when he defrauded the complainant by using
a n unfu n ded check. Despite th e p a y m en t o f t h e c h eck b efore t h e
filing of inform at i on, the pur pose of the law in p u n i s h in g evil act of
defrauding the victim w il l not be att ai n ed.
The essence of estafa is to punish fr a ud, and not to protect the
i ntegrity of the check. Payment before the fil in g of I n f or m a t ion w i l l
serve the purpose of B.P. Blg. 22, and that is, to protect the integrity

of the check, but not for purposes of penalizing estafa. Thus, such
paymenr. is a defense in B.P. Blg. 22 but not in estafa.
H owever, t h e p r e s u m p t i o n of deceit ma y b e r eb u t t e d b y

S u s p e n s i o n of P a y m e n t — Su s p e nsion of paym ent
order issued by SEC before the check was presented for payment i s
a defense in violation of B.P. Blg. 22. Considering that t h er e was a
lawful order from the SEC, the contract is deemed suspended. When
a contract is suspended, it temporarily ceases to be operative; and it
a gain becomes operative when a condit ion occurs — o r a s i t u a t i o n

b irth t a kes place or its effectivity commences only if an d w hen t h e
event that constit u tes the condition happens or is fulfil l e d. Thus, at
the time complainant pr esented the check for encashment, it had no
right to do so, as there was yet no obligation due from accused. Thus,
accused is not liable for violation of B.P. Blg. 22. (Gidwani v. People,

It is submitted that suspension of payment before the expiration
of the fivebanking days from receipt of notice of dishonor is also a
defense in violation of B.P. Blg. 22 since it w il l d epr ive the accused

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENCY OF FUNDS
The violation of the second paragraph of Section I of B .P. Blg.
22 is committed by a person who makes or draws and issues a check
with sufficient fu nds or credit w it h t h e d r a wee bank, but he fails to
keep sufficient fu nds or credit for 90 d ays from th e d ate appearing
t hereon, w h ic h c h eck i s s u b sequently d i s h onored b y t h e d r a w e e
bank for such insufficiency.
In violation of first p a r a gr aph of Section I o f B .P. Blg. 22, the
drawer kn ows the "in s ufficiency of fund s" t o cover the check at t h e
time of its issuance; while in vi ol ation of the second paragraph, the
drawer has "sufficient funds" at the time of issuance but fails to keep
s ufficient f u n d s o r m a i n t ai n c r e di t w i t h i n 9 0 d a y s f r o m t h e d a t e
appearing on the check.
In sum, in violation of the first paragraph, the check is unfunded
a : the time of issuance; while in v i ol at ion of second paragraph, th e
check isfunded. The act punishable under the first paragraph is the
i ssuance of a bum check; wh il e th e om ission pu ni shable under t h e

thereof. But such presentation w i t h i n t h e said period is required to
apply the presumption of knowledge of insufficient funds, which is an
element of the crime. Thus, there is no presumption of knowledge of
insufficiency of funds if the check was presented beyond the period.
But the prosecution may st il l p r ove such k n owl edge thr ough other
evidence. (Bautista v. C o u rt o f A p p e a ls, G.R. N o. 1 4 8 875, Ju ly 6 ,
2001) On the other hand, under the second paragraph, presentation
of the check wit hi n 9 0 days from it s m a t u r i t y d at e is an element of
the crime. The obligation of the drawer to maint ain the sufficiency of
the funds is confined to 90 days from the date of its issuance. Thus,
presentation of the check beyond the period is a defense.

ESTAFA BY INDUCING ANO T H E R TO SIGN
Estafa by indu cing another to sign is commit t ed by any person
w ho defrauds another by i n d u c in g a n ot her t o s ign a d o cument b y

means of deceit. (Article 815)

another to sign a document by means of deceit.(1949 Bar Exam;

2.
A t t r i b u t i n g a S t a t e m e n t o f S a l e —A mar r i e d couple,
who did not know how to read and write, asked the accused to prepare
a Special Power of At t o r ney to r epresent them i n a s ui t p e n d ing in
a court. Accused made a Deed of Sale of properties in his favor. The
couple signed the document on t h e b e lief t ha t t h e y executed SPA.

A ccording to L u i s R e yes, th e d i s t i n ct ion seems to be t h a t i n
t e case of U.S. v. Berry, the accused induced by means of deceit the
offended party to sign the document; whereas, in the case of U.S. v.
Capule, supra, t here was no inducement, for the offended party was
w illing and r e ady f ro m t h e b egin n in g t o sign th e document i n t h e
belief that it contained statements made by them .

A t tr i b u t in g a S t a t e m ent o f A u t h o r ity t o S ell —In
Intestate Estate of Gonzales v. People, G .R. No. 181409 F b

was already blind and 79 years of age, making her believe that said
document i n v o lved onl y h e r t a x es. H o w ever, th e SP A a u t h o r i z es
t e daughter of the accused to sellthe properties of the offended
party. Accused used the SPA t o sell th e p r operties of th e offended
p arty t o a n o t her p e r s on. Th e c r i m e c o m m i t t e d i s c o m p lex c r i m e
o estafa t h r o ugh f a l sification of p u b l i c d ocument. F a l sification of

execution of the SPA, the consumm a t ion of the estafa occurred only
when the accused later u t i l i zed the SPA t o sell th e pr operti es
and

thereafter pocketed the proceeds ofthe sale. Damage or prejudice to
the offended party was caused not by the falsification of the SPA (as
no damage was yet caused to the pr operty r i g ht s of offended party
when she was m ade to sign th e d ocument) bu t b y t h e s u bsequent
use of the said document. That is wh y th e falsification of the public
document was used to facilit ate and ensure (that is, as a necessary
means for) the commission of the estafa.
If the accused induced the offended party tosign a deed of sale
of the properties either in hi s f avor or i n f a vor of t h ir d p a r t i es, the
damage would have been caused by the execution ofthe document.

accused is liable for falsification of dead of sale for attr i b u t in g to th e

Swindling by Taking
Other form of swindling is also committed by an owner of a
personal property who wrongfully takes it from its lawful possessor
to the prejudice of the latter or a third person. (Article 81 6,par. 8)

To commit this other form of swindling, it is important that the
property unlawfully taken is a personal property. When an offender
wrongfullytakes his real property from itslawful possessor to the
prejudice of the latter, other form of swindling is not committed
s ince th e p r o p ert y w r o n g f u ll y t a k e n i s n o t a p e r s o nal p r o p er t y .
(2012 Bar E x a m) Oc cupation of r e al p r o perty u n d er A r t i c le 8 12 is
n ot commit ted since the offender is th e owner of th e pr operty. Th e
crime committed in t hi s case is un ust vexation .
The lawful possessor of personalproperty can be a lessee or
mortgagee.
The diff'erences between th e ft a n d s w i n d l i ng t h r o u gh t a k i n g
are as follows:
1.
I n t h e f t , the offender must not be the owner of the personal

Arson w i th R e s u l t i ng D e a t h
In U.S. v. Bu r n s, G. R. No. 16648, March 5, 1 921 the accused
was convicted of a complex crime of arson wit h h o m i cide. However,
under Arti cle 320 of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A. No.
7659 and Section 5 of P.D. No. 1613, the penalty is higher if arson is
accompanied with r e sul t in g death. In s um , th e result in g death is a
q ualifying circumstance. Burns prin ciple is not anymore controllin g
since the present laws prescribe a single penalty for ar son if death
results as a c o nsequence of th e c o m m i ssion t h e r eof. In Pe o ple v .
Abayon, G.R. No. 204891, September 14, 2016, it was ruled that
there is no complex crime of arson with h o m i cide because the crime
of arson absorbs the resultant death .
If death resulted as a consequence of arson, the crime can be
described as arson (People v. Dolendo, G.R. No. 223098, June 8,
2019) resulting to death. (People v. Abayon, supra)

every sexual intercourse constitutes a crime. On the other hand, the
commission of concubinage does pose such risk. The essence of this
crime other than violation of mar i tal vow, is the scandal that affects
the family. Regardless of the number sexual intercourses during the
cohabitation, concubinage will produce a single family scandal. That
is the reason why r egardless of the nu m ber of sexual i n t ercourses,
there is only one crime of concubinage.

and (2) rape through sexual assault. However, the Supreme Court in
People v. Tulugan, G.R, No. 227363, March 12, 2019 said that rape
through sexual intercourse should be called as "rape" while rape
through sexual assault should be called as "sexual assault."
RAPE
Rape is committed by a man w ho shall ha ve carnal kn o wle dg
of a woman: (1) through force, threat, or in t i m i d a t i on; (2) when th

accused, taking advant age of th e f act t h a t v i c ti m w a s a sleep, had
carnal knowledge of her. Assuming that th e victim consented to the
sexual act when she woke up, the accused is still li able for rape. The
crime of rape had already been consummated, and thus, consent
given after the consummation of the act is not of the character to be
excluded from the concept of the crime of rape. Such consent will be
considered as a mere. resignation in t h e f ace of an ou t r age already
perpetrated. (People v. Dayo, G.R. No. L-27859, December 1, 1927

also been called "gender-free rape" or "object rape." However, the

Rape, which is commonly denominated as "organ rape" or

man while the victim m ust be a woman .

A ccording to J u s t ice Leonen, Section 4 of R .A . No . 8 353 (t h e
Anti-Rape Law) expressly repealed Ar t i cle 385 of the Revised Code
on rape. Since the circumstances under which acts of lasciviousness
is committed, are sourced from a repealed Article 885 ofthe Code,
Article 836 of the Code on acts of lasciviousness has been rendered
incomplete and ineffective by R.A. No. 8353.

Article 8-'6 of the Code is still a good law despite the enactment of
R.A. No. 8858 for t h er e i s n o i r r e concilable inconsistency between
their provisions. When the lascivious act does not constitute rape or
sexual assaulr, under R.A. No. 8858, then Ar t i cle 386 of the Code on
acts of lasciviousness is applicable.

A cts of Lascivi ou sness, Sexual Assault an d R a p e
The differences and simil a r i t ies between acts of lasciviousness
and rape are as follows:
1.
R a p e a n d sexual assault is a crime against person, which
can be prosecuted de officio. Acts of lasciviousness is a crime against
chastity, a priv ate crime, which cannot be prosecuted de officio.
2. R a pe can only be committed by a man against a woman.
This is a gender crime. On th e other h a nd, sexual assault and acts
of lasciviousness can be committed regardless ofthe gender of the
offender and victim. Both of them are gender-free crimes.
8. R a pe is committed by having carnal knowledge ofa woman.
Sexual assault i s c o m m i t t e d b y i n s e r t in g h i s p e n i s i n t o a n o t h er
person's mouth or anal orifice, or any in st r u m ent or object, into th e
genital o a n a l o r i fi c e of a n o t her p e r son. Acts of l a sciviousness is
committed by having lascivious conduct upon other persons of either
sex, which does not constitute sexual intercou "se or sexual assault.
4.
Ra p e , s e x ua l a s sault a n d a ct s o f l a s civiousness can be
committed t h r o ug h f o r ce, or in t i m i d a t i on o r w h e n t h e o f f e n d ed
party is deprived of reason (e.g.,retarded or demented person) or
otherwise unconscious; and w hen th e w o ma n i s u n de r 1 2 y e ars of
age. However, unlike acts of lasciviousness, rape and sexual assault
can also be committed by means of fraudu l e nt machina t ion or grave
abuse of authority.
5.
U n l i k e a ct s of lasciviousness, the provisions on rape and
sexual assault h av e r u l es on qu a l i f y in g ci r cu m st ances and special
complex crime.
H aving s e x ua l i n t e r c ourse t h r o ug h f o r c e w i t h a ga y , w h o

a woman. Rape isa gender crime. It is committed by a man having
c arnal kn ow ledge of a w o man t h r o ugh f or ce. Neither i s t hi s crim e
instrument or object sexual assault since the offender used his penis,
and not an instr u m ent or object, in commit t in g the crime. Nor is this
crime sexual assault t h r o ugh oral i n t e r course or sodomy since the

the crime committed is acts of lasciviousness. (2016 Bar Exam)
Acts of I ascivi ousriess and Sex ual Assault
Prior to R.A. No. 8353, sexual assault wa s considered as acts
of lasciviousness. However, upon the passage of R.A. No. 8353, some
acts, which were constitut ive of acts of lasciviousness before, are now
treated as sexual assault. H o w ever, th e concept of sexual a ssault
has not acquired some of the characteristic of acts of lasciviousness.

3. E r e ct penis capable of penetration — As a rule, the
touching of the labia of the victim's pudendum that will consummate
rape must be made in the context of the presence or existence of an
erect penis capable ofpenetration. However, there is an exception.
W here th e a c cused f a i led t o a c h i eve a n e r e c ti on, h a d a l i m p o r
f iaccid penis, or a n o v e r s i zed p e ni s w h i c h c o ul d n o t f i t i n t o t h e
victim's vagina, the Supreme Court n onetheless held that r ape was
consummated on the basis of the victim's testimony that the accused
repeatedly tr i ed, but in v a in, to insert his penis into her vagina and
in all likelihood reached the labia of the pudendum as the victim felt
his organ on th e l ip s of her v u l va , or t ha t t h e p e nis of th e accused
touched the m i d dle part of her v a g i na. (People v. Campuha n, G. R

4.
I n se r t i n g i n s t r u m e n t or obj ect into the labia —
Labia,
maj ora and minora, and vaginal orifice are two different parts of the
internal pudendum of a female. The labia are the first l a y ers of the
pudendum, while the vaginal orifice is a layer next to labia. The size
of the opening of the vaginal orifice is smaller than t hat of the labia.
Touching the labia of the pudendum by th e penis consummates the
crime of rape. (People v. Campuhan, supra) I n s um, penetrati ng the
vaginal orifice, the next layer, is not necessary to consummate rape.
(People v. Matuti n a, supra)
In People v. Bonaagua, G.R. No. 188897, June 6, 2011, the
Supreme Court ru led that in the crime of rape whereby the slightest
p enetration of the male organ or even its slightest contact wit h t h e

Acts of Lascivi ou sness
If the offender touches the body of the victim t h r o ugh force, he

but there is no intention to have sexual int ercourse.
In the absence of showing that the erectile penis of the accused

merely to annoy or vex her. That the victim was fully clothed at that

CRIMINAL LAW REVIEWER
VOLUME II

Section 5 of R.A. No. 7610 is broader than acts of lasciviousness. In
acts of lasciviousness, the intent of the accused is to satisfy his lust.
On the other hand, the intent of the offender in sexual abuse is not
only to arouse or gratify sexual desire but it includes intent to abuse,
humiliate, harass or degrade the child.
Embracing, kissing and touching breast of the victim shall only
be considered unjust vexation instead of acts of lasciviousness if the
intention of the accused is only to annoy, or vex the victim. (1994
Bar Exam) However, if the victim is a minor, the crime committed
is sexual abuse under R.A. No. 7610 since lasciviousness includes
touching the breast of the child with i n t ent to degrade, debase, or
humiliate her.
SEXUAL HARASSMENT
R.A. NO. 7877
The elements of the crime of sexual harassment are: (1) that the
offender has authority, influence or moral ascendancy over victim;
( 2) the authority, influence or moral ascendancy exists in a work,
training, or education environment; and (3) the offender demands,
requests or otherwise requires any sexual favor from the victim.
Authority or Ascendency
The offender in sexual h arassment has authority, influence
or moral ascendancy over victim in a w ork, tr aining, or education
environment.

the offender. (Philippine Aeolus Automotive United Corp. v. NLRC,
G.R. No. 12461 7,April 28, 2000)
Sexual harassment in the workplace is not about a man taking
advantage of awoman by reason of sexual desire; it is about power
being exercised by a superior over his women subordinates. That
p ower emanates from th e f act t ha t h e can r emove them i f t h e y
refuse his amorous advances. (Alegria v. Duque, A.M N o. RTJ-062019, April 4, 2007)
In La msis v. Sa les, A.M. N o. P-17-8772, January 1 0, 2018,
complainant is a janitress of a priva-.e company assigned in the Hall
of Justice. While working, respondent, a court process server, showed
his private organ to her. Respondent did not commit the crime of
sexual harassment under R.A. No. 7877 since he as a process server
has no moral ascendancy over complainant, who is an employee of
independent contractor. However, respondent is administratively
liable for committing an immoral act.
If an employee sexually harasses another employee, but the
former has no authority, influence or ascendency over the latter, this
is not sexual harassment under RA No. 7877. But the harassment
constitutes gender-based public spaces or online sexual harassment
under R.A. No. 11313 (Safe Spaces Act) or any other crime. Under
R.A. No. 11818, the crime of gender-based sexual harassment may
also becommitted between peers and those committed to a superior
officerby a subordinate, or to a teacher by a student, or to a trainer
by a trainee.
Work or Training, or Education Environment
Sexual harassment can only be committed in a work, training,
or education e n v i r onment. I f an off e n d er sexually h a r a ssed
his neighbor, th e c r im e c ommitted i s u n j us t v e xation, acts of

In sexual h a r assment, th e c f f ender d emands, requests or
otherwise r equires an y s e x ual f a vo r f r o m t h e v i c t i m . S e xual
harassment is committed regardless of whether or not the demand,
request or requirement for sexual submission is accepted by the
victim. Hence, sweetheart defense cannot be u pheld i n f a vor of
offender in sexual harassment case.

show that he demanded, requested or required any sexual favor

act of grabbing complainant and a t t empting to k iss her w i t h out
her consent was an unmistakable manifestation of his intention to
violate R.A. No. 7877 that specifically prohibited sexual harassment
in the work environment.

Accused demanded from complainant t hat she should expose her

him as a condition for her employment. He was convicted of sexual
harassment.
1.
I m p l i e d De m a n d —R.A. No. 7877 calls for a "demand,
request or requirement of a sexual favor." But it is not necessary that
the demand, request, or requirement of a sexual favor be articulated
in a categorical oral or written statement. It may be discerned, with
equal certitude, from the acts of the offender. (Bacsin v. Wahiman,
G.B. 1Vo. 1460$3, April 30, 2008)
In Bacsin v. Wahiman, supra, even without an express demand
from respondent, a school teacher, his act of mashing the breast of
his student was sufficient to constitute sexual harassment.
In Domingo v. Rayala, supra, demand for sexual favor may
be discerned, with e qual certit ude, from t h e a cts of r e spondent
Atty. Rogelio Rayala, chairman of N L RC, against complainant, a
NLRC stenographic reporter. Holding and squeezing her shoulders,
running his fingers across her neck and t i ckling her ear, having
inappropriate conversations with h er, giving her money allegedly
for school expenses with a promise of future privileges, and making
statements with unmistakable sexual overtones — all these acts of
responded resound with deafening clarity the unspoken request for
a sexual favor.
If the offender has moral ascendency over the victim and the
former committed sexual advances on the latter, implied request or
demand for sexual favor is present. Hence, sexual harassment is
committed.

In Gonzales v. Serrano, G .R. No. 1 75433, March 11 2 0 1 5
A tty. Jacinto Gonzales, direct superior of the complainant, forcibly
kissed her lips in the restaurant in front of her officemates and other
customers. She tried to ward off Atty. Gonzales by pulling her head
a way from him, but he persisted on kissing her against her wi l l .
After releasing her, Atty. Gonzales said: "Ang sarap pala ng labi ni

In Aquino v. Acosta, A.M. No. CTA-01-1, April 2, 2 002, the

or
failure
'
to show that he demanded, requested or required any sexual
favor from complainant in e x c hange for fa vorable compensation
terms, conditions, promotion or p r i v ileges. Thus, it a ppears that
sexual demand, request or requirement is an essential element of
sexual harassment. However, Domingo v. Bayala, G.R. No. 155831,
February 18, 2008, the Supreme Court ruled that it is not essential
that the demand„request or requ'rement be made as a condition for
c ontinued employment or for promotion to a higher position. It i s
enough that the respondent's acts result in creating an intimidating
hostil o r o ffensive environment:"or the employee. In this case, the
intim'dating and h ostile environment for complainant i s clearly
shown by the fact that she reported the matter to an officemate and,
after the lastinc.dent, filed for a leave of absence and requested
transfer to another unit . R e spondent is found to have committed
sexual harassment.

misunderstood his actuations and construed them as work-related
sexual harassment under R.A. No. 7877.

It is not essential that the demand, request or requirement be
made as a condition for continued employment or for promotion to
a higher position. It is enough that the respondent's acts result in

A mere casual buss on the cheek of the complainant dur i n g

festiveor special occasions in front of several persons is not a
sexual advance within t h e p u r v iew of sexual h a rassment under
R.A. No. 7877. (Aquino v. Acosta, supra) But a k i ss on her li ps of
the complainants (Atty. Mona Lisa Buencamino v. Judge Armando
De Asa, Adm. Matter No. MTJ-98-1144, July 22, 1998; Narvasa v.
Sanchez, supra)even in a public place (Gonzales v.Serrano, supra);
o r holding an d s queezing complainant's shoulders, ru n ning h i s
fingers across her neck and tickling her ear, and the inappropriate
comments made in privacy (Domingo v. Rayala, supra) constitute
sexual harassment within the contemplation of R.A. No. 7877.
The case of Aquino is different from Domingo. While in Aquino,
the Court interpreted the acts (of Judge Acosta) as casual gestures of

friendshipand camaraderie,done during festiveor specialoccasions
and with other people present, in th e case of Domingo, Rayala's
a cts of holding and squeezing Domingo's shoulders, running hi s
fingers across her neck and tickling her ear, and the inappropriate
comments, were all made in the confines of Rayala's office when no
other members of his staff were around. More importantly, and a
circumstance absent in Aq u i n o, Rayala's acts produced a hostile
work environment for Domingo, as shown by her having reported
the matter to an officemate and, after the last incident, filing for a
leave of absence and requesting transfer to another unit.
Additional Element of Sexual Ha r assment
Additional element for sexual harassment in a w o r k -related
or employment environment is that: (1) the sexual favor is made as
a condition in the employment or continued employment of victim
or in granting her favorable terms or privileges; (2) the refusal to
grant the sexual favor results in her discrimination or impairment
of her rights or privileges; or (8) the demand for sexual favor would

employee.
Transferring a s u b or dinate t o a p l a c e w i t h ou t t e l ephone
for refusal to submit herself to the sexual desire of her superior,
which impaired her p r i v i lege as an employee, constitutes sexual
harassment. (Philippine Aeolus Automotive United Corp. v. NLRC,

employee. (Domingo v. Rayala, supra)
In D o m i ngo v . R a y a l a , supra, i n t i m i d a ting a n d h o s t i l e
environment fcr complainant is clearly shown by the fact —.hat she
reported the matter to an officemate and, afterthe last incident,
filedfor a leave of absence and requested transfer to another unit.
Addition~i element for sexual harassment in an education or
training envi'onment is that (1) when the sexual favor is made a
condition to the giving of a passing grade, or the granting privileges;
or (2) when tl:e sexual advances result in an intimidating, hostile or
offensive emmonment for the student, trainee or apprentice.
In Bacsin v. 1Vahiman, supra,,complainant testified that she
felt fear at the time respondent touched her. The act of respondent
of fondling onc of his students is against R.A. No. 7877 since such
sexual advances result i n a n i n t i m i d ating, hostile or o f f ensive
environment to her.
Performing Sexual Acts
Mere demand or r equest for sexual favor consummates the
crime of sexual harassment. Actual commission of sexual advances
is not required for the consummation of this crime. However, if the
offender, who has ascendancy over the victim, already pe"formed
sexual acts «pon h er , h e s h al l b e e x posed to cr i m inal l i a bility
for a grave crime such sexual abuse under R.A. No. 7610, acts of
lasciviousness, or rape by means of grave abuse of authority.

swimming instructor was convicted for sexual abuse under R.A. No.

others, orto suffer emotional distress. However, stalking against a

child constitutes child abuse under Section 10 (a) of R.A. No. 7610

Sexual harassment in a private place is not punishable under
the Safe Spaces Act. For example, Pedro inside his house uttered
to Maria, his cousin, "Palaki ng palaki wetpu mo, papisil naman."
Since a private house is not within th e contemplation of the word
"public spaces" under R.A. No. 11313, the crime committed is unjust
vexation, and not ge nder-based streets and pu b lic spaces sexual
harassment.

(Araneta v. People, G.R. No. 174205, June 27, 2008), while stalking
against a woman w'th whom the offender has/had marital, sexual or

cyber unjust vexation,cyber threat, cyber libel or any other crime.
For example, Pedro to annoy hi s arch enemy, Juan, incessantly

Private area of a person means the naked or undergarment
clad genitals,
pubic area, buttocks or female breast of an individual.
Reasonable expectation of privacy
Secretly capturing the image of the private part of a woman
urinating in a public comfort room with the use of a hidden camera
constitutes the crime of photo/video voyeurism. The woman has a
reasonable expectation of privacy since she believed that she could
disrobe in private inside the comfort room, without being concerned
that herprivate area was being captured. (Section 8 ofR .A.N o.9995)
Clandestinely taking a photo of a woman's breast exposed due
to wardrobe malfunction while she was dancing in a public beach
during a town fiesta constitutes the crime of photo/video voyeurism.
Even though she was dancing in a public place, she had a reasonable
expectation of privacy since she believed that her breast would not
be visible to the public. (Section 8 of R.A. No. 9995)
Taking a videocoverage of a drunken woman, who deliberately
removed her shir t a n d br a t o e x pose her breasts while dancing
in a disco pub, is not photo/video voyeurism because she had no
reasonable expectation ofprivacy.
Other crime

Photo/video voyeurism under Section 4 (b) to (d) of R.A. No.
9995 is committed by any person, who shallcopy or reproduce, or
to cause tobe copied or reproduced, sell or distribute, or cause to be
sold ordistributed, publish or broadcast, or cause to be published or
broadcast, such photo or video coverage or recordings of such sexual
act or any similar activity.
Section 4 (a) of R.A. No. 9995 covers photo or video of sexual
act orsimilar activity, and image of the private area of a person. On
the other hand, Section 4 (b), (c) and (d) merely covers photo or video
of sexual act or similar activity. Thus, publishing a picture, through
the internet, depicting a nude body of a woman without her written
consent is not a violation of Section 4 (d).
Consent torecord or take a photo or video coverage of sexual
act or private partsgiven by the person involved is a defense in
crime involving recording or taking photo or video under Section 4
(a) but not involving copying, selling, and publishing under Section

4 (b), (c) and (d). Consent as a defense in crime involving copying,
selling, and publishing must be a wr i t ten consent to copy, sell or

publish.

715

Taking a videocoverage of a nude woman hired to dance in a
stag party is not constitutive of the crime of voyeurism under Section
4 (a) because of the consent given by the woman. But publishing
the video coverage through the internet without the written consent
:"rom the said woman violates Section 4 (d).
QUALIFIED SEDUCTION
Qualified seduction is committed by: (1) person in authority,
priest, house-servant, domestic, guardian, t eacher
r, or a p erson
entrusted in any capacity with her education or custody, who has
carnal knowledge of a virgin and a minor, who is not under 12 years
of age; or (2) a person who has carnal kn owledge of his sister or
descendant, who isnot under 12 years of age. (Article 887)
1.
O f f e n d e r — In q u a l i f ied s eduction, the re is a b u se of
authority, confidence or relationship on th e p art of t h e offender.
(Gonzales v. The Hon. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 108811, May 81,
1994) There are three classes of offenders in the crime of qualified
seduction, to wit: (1) those who abuse their authority in s educing
the woman such as a person in authority, guardian, teacher, or a
person entrusted in an y capacity wit h he r e ducation or custody;
(2) those who abuse the confidence reposed on them by the woman
seduced such as priest, house-servant, or domestic; and (3) those
who abuse their relationship with the woman seduced such as those,
who seduced their sister or descendant. (2007 Bar Exam)
a.
T e a c h e r —A is a g i r l o f 1 7 y e a rs, single and a
high school student whose teacher is B. Teaching in the same
school is C. One afternoon, after class, A and C had sexual
intercourse in the storeroom of the school. A became pregnant.
(1981 Bar Exam) The crime committed is qualified seduction
t hrough abuse of authority. Consent of th e victim w h ich i s
obtained through seducement or abuse of authority i s not a
defense. The fact that A is not the teacher of the girl will not
negate the element of abuse of authority since both b e l ong
to the same school. Even if A i s no t th e teacher of the girl,
qualified seduction is still committed since both belongs to the
same school, and thus, A has moral infiuence as member of the
faculty over the girl. (Santos v. People, 40 O.G., Supp. 6, 28/
Revised Penal Code by Justice Luis Reyes

same roof, pertaining t o t h e s ame house, and constituting,
in thi s sense, a p ar t t h e r eof. (People v. A l v a rez, G.R N o .

(People v. Camatis, G.R. Nos. L-30635-6, January 29, 1976)
Where the accused carnally abused two orphan girls, relatives
of his wife, sheltered in his house, he was convicted of qualified
seduction. He was a domestic in relation to the girls. (U.S. v.
Arlante, G.R. ¹ . L - 3 8 59, January 15, 1908)
c.
A s c e n d an t o r B r o t h e r — I f t h e o f f ender is t h e
brother or ascendant of the victim, elements of minority and
virginity are dispensed with. Parenthetically, the relationship
of the offender and the victim must be by consanguinity but
need not be legitimate. (Revised Penal Code by Luis Reyes) The
essence of seduction qualified by relationship is an incestuous
sexual intercourse between the offender and offended party.
However, one h aving sexual i n t ercourse wit h h i s a d opted
daughter i s l i a b l e f o r q u a l i fied s e duction b ecause under
Section 17 ofR.A. No. 8552, the adoptee shall be considered
the legitimate son/daughter of the adopter(s) for all intents and
purposes.
A, 75 years of age, had sexual intercourse with his sister,
80 years of age. A is liable for qualified seduction.
2.
O ff e n d e d P a r t y — Th e v i c t im i n q u a l if ied s eduction
must be a minor, a v i r g in, and a w o man. However, in seduction
qualified by relationship, minority and virginity is not an element.
But the victim must not be under 12 years of age; otherwise, the
crime committed is statutory rape.
Virginity as a n e ssential i n gredient of th e c r im e of s i mple
abduction should no t b e u n d erstood i n i t s m a t e r ial s ense and
does not exclude the i dea of a b duction of a v i r t u ous woman of
good reputation. The prior sexual intercourse of the accused with
the offended party will not make the latter a non-virgin when th' e
former subsequently had sexual intercourse with her, which is the
subject matter of seduction. (U.S. v. Casten, G.R. No. 11488, August
19, 1916) The concept of virginity as an element of simple abduction
is the same as that of an element of qualified seduction. In sum,
virginity as an element of simple abduction and qualified seduction

717

pertains to legal virginity. As long as the girl is of good reputation,
he is a virgin in the eyes of the law. (1981 Bar Exam)
The word "seduce," as found in the statute, imports not only
illicit sexual intercourse, but it imports also a surrender of chastity;
a surrender of the woman's personal virtue. The statute is for the
protection of the chastity of unmarried women, and the existence of
the virtue at the time of the intercourse is a necessary ingredient of
the offense; for, as has been often said, the woman who has lost her
c hastity, the prostitute, may be the victim of rape, but is not th e
subject of seduction. The fact that th e man may have considered
her a virgin does not seem to change the rule. His ignorance of her
previous immoral and unchaste practices cannot make her a virgin
in the eyes of the law. (U.S. v. Suan, G.R. No. 9201, March 3, 1914)
3.
Se x u a l I n t e r c ourse —Sexual intercourse between the
seducer and seduced is an element of qualified seduction. Consent
of the woman seduced to the sexual intercourse with the offender
i s not a d e f ense i n q u a li fied seduction. Qualified seduction i s
committed even though no deceit int ervenes or even when such
carnal knowledge was voluntary on the part of the virgin. (People v.
Fontanilla,supra; 1981 Bar Exam)
SIMPLE SEDUCTION
Simple seduction is committed by any person, who has carnal
k nowledge of a woman who is single or a widow of good reputation,
and a minor, who is not under 12 years of age by means of deceit.
(Article 338; 1965 Bar Exam)
l.
O ff e n d e d Pa r ty —The offended party in simple seduction
must be a woman, single or a widow of good reputation and minor,
who is not under 12 years ofage. If she is under 12 years of age,
having sexual intercourse with her is statutory rape.
In simple seduction, unlike that in a qualified case, the matter
of virginity of the offended party is not essential; it is only necessary
that the complainant be an unmarried woman and of chaste life and
good reputation. Under the law, simple seduction is not synonymous
with loss of virginity. (People v. Yap, G.R. No. L-251 76, February 27,

1968)
To be considered as a victim of simple seduction, a widow must

be a minor or under 18 years of age. Since the marrying age und
er
tthe
e Family Code is at least 18 years of age, a minor, who has no

capacity to marry, cannot be a widow. Thus, as a general rule, a
widow cannot be a victim of simple seduction simply because she is
not a minor. However, under the Code of Muslim Personal Laws, the
marrying age is at least 15 years of age. In this sense, a minor, who
is married in accordance with the Muslim Law, can become a widow,
and a victim of simple seduction.
A t h r ough p r o mise of m a r r i age wa s a bl e t o h a v e c a r n al
knowledge of B, a girl of 16. A had believed all the time that B wa s
a chaste person but l ater found out t ha t she had i l l i cit r elations
with other men. He refused to marry her and she filed charges of
seduction against him. A is not guilty of the crime of seduction since
the element of good reputation of the woman seduced is not present.
The word "seduce," as found in the statute, imports not only illicit
sexual intercourse, but it imports also a surrender of chastity. The
statute is for the protection of the chastity of un married woman,
and the existence of the virtue at th e t ime of the intercourse is a
necessary ingredient of the offense. The fact that the man may have
considered her aperson of good reputation does not seem to change
the rule. Hi s i g n orance of he r p r e vious i m m oral an d u n c haste
practices cannot make her reputation good in the eyes of the law.
(1971 Bar Exam)
2.
S e x u a l I n t e r c o u r s e — The Information alleged that on
the same occasion,accused by means of deceit and false promise of
marriage seduced and had sexual intercourse several times with a
minor of good reputation. The fact that t h ere should be different
acts of intercourse, consented by the woman in r eliance upon the
same promise of mar r i age would not m ean separate offenses of
seduction. Nowhere in th e I n f ormation does it appear that every
act ofintercourse was the result of a separate act of deceit. (People
v. Yap, G.R. No. L-25176, February 27, 196'8) In sum, despite the
allegationsof several of sexual intercourses, the Information charged
the accused of a single crime of simple seduction.
Lewd design is an indispensable element of rape and. crimes
against chastity. (People v. Gilo, G.R. No. L-18202, April 80, 196'4)
The Information for acts of lasciviousness alleged that accused
while being drunk touches the breast and face of the complainant
by means of violence or intimidation. Since the Information failed
to allege lewd design, which is an indispensable element of acts of
lasciviousness, the acts committed by the accused are converted into
another crime, which in this case is unjust vexation. (People v. Gilo,

supra)

719

In Information for rape,it is not necessary to allege lewd design,
for to require such averment is to demand a patent superfluity. Lewd
desigr, which is inherent in rape, is manifest in the very act itselfthe sexual intercourse with a woman through force or intimidation.
(People v. Obsania, G.R. No. L-24447, tune 29, 1968) By the same
token, lewd design is inherent in the very act itself of having sexual
intercourse with a chaste woman over 12 and under 18 years of age
under a false promise of marriage, which act constitutes the crime of
simple seduction. (Luansing v. People, G.R. No. L-28289, February

28, 1969)
3.
De ce i t —The Information does not allege deceit which
is essential in simple seduction. It is thus clear that the trial court
erred in convicting the accused of simple seduction upon the basis
of the four Information charging rape committed by means of force
and intimidation. (Berba v. People, G.R. Nos. L-82267-70, March 26',

1979)
I, a suitorof M aria who is single and 17 years of age, succeeded
in having carnal knowledge of the latter. After the sexual intercourse
in order to assuage her ruffled feelings K made repeated promises to
marry her. However, E failed to keep his promises. Simple seduction
is not committed since the promise to marry was made after the
sexual intercourse. To commit si mple seduction, the deceit such
as a false promise to marry must be employed by the offender to
seduce the woman in having sexual intercourse with him. In sum,
there must be a causal connection between the deceit or promise to
marry and the sexual intercourse. This cause and effect relationship
canno-. be considered as present if the promise to. marry was made
after the sexual intercourse. (1965 Bar Exam)
Deceit is an essential element of simple seduction. However,
deceit does not need to be proved or established in a charge of
qualified seduction. It is replaced by abuse of confidence, authority,
or relationship. When the offender is apublic officer, a priest or
minister, a servant, domestic, tutor, teacher, or under any ti tle is
in charge of the education or keeping of the offended woman, the
act is punishable although fraud or deceit may not have been used
or, if employed, has not been proved. The law takes into account the
a buse of confidence (authority or r elationship) on the part of t h e
offender, which implies deceit or fraud. (People v. Fontanilla, G.R.
No. L-25854, Jun,e 28, 1968)
In simple seduction, proof of specific acts constituting deceit
c omm tted by the accused to seduce the woman to give in t o h i s
lustfu desire is required. Usually, the deceit is consisting of promise

to marry, which the accused fails to fulfill. If th e accused fulfilled
his promise to marry, the accused is not liable for simple seduction
since thepromise appears not to be deceitful. Moreover, marriage is
a mode of extinguishing criminal liability for seduction.

Consent of a child under coercion or influence is not recognized by
law. The gravamen of seduction and consented acts of lasciviousness
is having sexual intercourse or acts of lasciviousness with consent of
the offended party obtained through seducement.

I n qualified seduction, proof of s p ecific acts committed or
words uttered by the accused to seduce the woman to give in to his
lustful desire is not required. The fact that the accused is a person
in authority or p r i est is a seducing circumstance that causes the
woman to give consent to a sexual intercourse with th e offender.
Abuse of authority, confidence, or r el ationship i m p lies d.eceit or
fraud.

1.
M in o r i t y —In s ta tutory r a pe or acts of lasciviousness
under Articles 266-A and 336, the victim must be under 12 years of
age. In seduction or consented acts of lasciviousness under Articles
337 and 338, the seduced woman must be over 12 years and under
18 years of age.

Deceit may constitute seducement or fraudulent machination.
If the accused seduced his girlfriend, who is a mi nor and of good

reputation, to have sex with him by deceitfully making a promise to
marry her, the crime committed is simple seduction. If the accused
pretended to be the husband of the victim, and by reason of this
pretense, he was able to have sex with h er, the crime committed
is rape t h rough f r a udulent m a chination. Th e essence of simple
seduction is having sexual intercourse by means of seducement in
the form of deceit. On the other hand, the essence of rape through
fraudulent m a c hination i s h a v i n g s e x ua l i n t e r course without
consent. In sum, without fraudulent machination there is no way for
the accused to obtain from the rape victim her consent to have sex.
CONSENTED ACTS OF LASCIVIOUSNESS
Acts of lasciviousness uith th e consent of the offended party
is committed by t h e s ame persons and th e s ame circumstances
as those in qualified seduction and simple seduction. (Article 889)
Seduction and consented acts of lasciviousness are the same except
in the latter the criminal act is sexual intercourse with the offended
party; while in former, the criminal act is having lascivious conduct
with her.
Seduction, Rape and Sexual Abuse
The gravamen of r ape and acts of l asciviousness is having
sexual intercourse or acts of lasciviousness without consent of the
offended party.Consent of a person under 12 years of age, demented
or mentally retarded is not recognized by law. The essence of sexual
abuse under Section 5 of R.A. No. 7610 is having sexual intercourse
or lascivious conduct w it h a c h i l d u n d e r c oercion or i n fl u ence.

If the offended party was seduced by the offender on her 12th
birthday, there is an issue on whether the provision on statutory
rape or that on seduction is applicable since the victim is neither
above nor under 12 years of age. Because there is doubt as to

which of the penal provisions applies, it must be resolved in favor
of the accused. Since the provision on seduction is favorable to the
accused, the words "over 12 years of age" mentioned in Articles 337
and 338 should beinterpreted as "12 years of age or over." Hence,
the provision of seduction is applicable.
In qualified seduction o r c o nsented acts o f l a sciviousness
involving relationship between the seducer and seduced, minority
is not an element. However, the victim must not be under 12 years
of age;otherwise, the crime committed is statutory rape or acts of
lasciviousness.
In sexual abuse, the victim must be a minor. But if the victim is
under 12 years ofage, the accused shall be prosecuted for statutory
rape oracts of lasciviousness.
2.
V i rg i n i t y —In q ualified seduction, the victim must be
a virgin wh ile in s i m ple seduction she must be a person of good
reputation. However, a virgin is equivalent to a person of good
reputation since virginity i n q u a lified seduction pertains to legal
virginity. But in seduction qualified by relationship, rape or sexual
abuse, virginity is not an element.
A minor, who is not a virgin, or a person of good reputation,
may have given her consent to sexual intercourse with the accused
voluntarily, and not by reason that the latter seduced her. Since she
had already experienced sexual intercourse, the accused could have
sex with her without the need of seducing her.
If a professor had sexual intercourse with hi s m i nor female
student, who is not a virgin, qualified seduction is not committed.

However, he i s l i a bl e fo r s e xual a b use i f h e u s e d i n f luence or
psychological coercion on her to consent to have sexual intercourse
with him.
3.
T ea c h e r — A t e a cher courted h is s t u d ent, a 1 4 - yearold virgin, invited her to a motel and had sexual intercourse with
her. The crime committed is qualified seduction through abuse of
authority. Consent of the victim obtained through seducement is not
a defense in qualified seduction. Because of his authority, he was
able to seduce her student in having sexual intercourse with him.
A teacher t h r eatened t o f l u n k h i s s t u d ent, a 1 4 -year o l d
virgin, in her English subject if she will not agree to have sexual
intercourse with him. Because of fear of being flunked, she agreed
to have sexual intercourse with him. While the teacher was having
sexual intercourse with his student, the latter was crying. The crime
committed is rape through grave abuse of authority. Consent by the
student obtained through grave abuse of authority is not recognized
by law.
The essence of qualified seduction through abuse of authority
is having sexual intercourse by means of seducement by abusing
offender's authority. On the other hand, the essence of rape through
grave abuse of a u t h ority is h a v i n g s e x ual i n t e r course wit h out
consent. In sum, without the grave abuse of authority th ere is no
way for the accused to obtain from the rape victim her consent to
have sex.
In People v. Larin, G.R. No. 128777, October 7, 1998, at the
shower room o f t h e u n i v ersity, a ccused, swimming i n s t r uctor,
o rdered his student (14 years of age) to undress to allow him t o
shave her pubic hair since it is visible. His student complied. But
instead of shaving her p u bic h air , accused performed the act of
cunnilingus. She backed away saying "Nandidiri a ho" but accused
kept on saying "H u uiag mong lagyan ng m a l i sya." Accused then
asked her to stand up and told her to simply pretend that he was
her boyfriend and thereupon accused removed the right cap of her
brassiere and licked her right breast while touching her vagina at
the same time. Then accused performed again the act of cunnilingus
on her, and forced her to hold and squeeze his penis. Accused was
convicted ofsexual abuse under R.A. No. 7610 because he employed
moral and psychological coercion on his minor student.
In Ma l to v. Pe ople, G.R. No. 1 64733, September 21, 2 007,
accused, a philosophy professor, invited his student (17 years

723

old! and her gr oup t o w atch pornographic films in a m o t el, and
then suggested to t h e m t o l i e w i t h h i m i n b e d . T h e y r e sisted
until he relented. Accused courted her. Socn, they had a "m u tual
understanding' and became sweethearts. When she protested her
grade of "3," he changed it to "1.5." He brought her to a motel, but
she:efused to have sexual intercourse vrith him. He brought her
again in a mote'. She again refused to have sexual intercourse with
him. He threatened to end the relationship. Pressured, she agreed
to have sexual intercourse with him. The accused was convicted of
sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 committed against
his 17-year old student. It was proven that the accused who was the
minor's professor obtained the minor's consent by taking advantage
of his relationship and moral ascendarey to exert influence on her.
4.
F at h e r —F ather, who had sexual intercourse with h is
daughter with consent of the latter, is liable for seduction qualified
by relationship regardless ofthe virgini-.
y and age of the victim.
But if t h e v i ct''m is a m i nor an d t h e accused took advantage of
his ascendancy as a father (or stepfather). the crime constitutes
sexual abuse against a child under ir fl u enee and psychological or
physical coercion (People v. Optana, G.R. ¹. 18 8 9 22,February 12,
2001) and rape through grave abuse ofauthority and psychological
intimidation. (People v. Mendoza, G.R No. 224295, March 22, 201 7)
In such a case, he shall be prosecuted for the graver crime of rape
insi,ead of sexual abuse. (People v. Pushing,GA. No. 208009,July 11,

2016)

In People v. Optana, supra, the accused committed sexual abuse
on his stepdaughter, using his moral ascendancy in intimidating the
victim to engage in sexual intercourse with him. He was convicted of
sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610.
In People v. Mendoza, supra, the accused stripped his five-year
old daughter naked and asked her to lie facing downwards. He then
inserted his penis into her vagina and anus. The harrowing incident
was interrupted by the arrival of her grandfather, after which she
dressed up, went out of the house anc played with her dog, while
he stayed inside the house. He was "onvicted of rape. According
to tl e Supreme Court, in incestuous "ape of a minor, actual force
or int i mid.ation need no t b e p r e sent. Th e m o ra l a n d p h y sical
dom'nation of the father is sufficient to int midate the victim int o
submission to his carnal desires. The rapist by hi s overpowering
and overbearing moral influence, can easily consummate his bestial
lust with i m p u n i ty. Consequently, proof of force and violence is

unnecessary, unlike when the accused is not an ascendant or a blood
relative of the victim.

W here th e a ccused for t h e p u r p ose of r a p in g t h e v i c t i m
transported her to a house or motel, or a place at an appreciable
distance, ordetained her for an appreciable period and thereafter,

5.
P r o m i s e to Ma rr y —Having sexual intercourse through
deceit(promise to marry or entering into a fake marriage) constitutes

simple seduction or sexual abuse. In Caballo v. People, G.R. No.
198732, June 10, 2013, the Supreme Court considered the assurance
o f love, guarantee that she would not get pr egnant by u sing th e
withdrawal method and the promise of marriage as "psychological
coercion" and "influence" within the purview of Section 5 of R.A. No.
7610. Hence,accused is guilty of sexual abuse.
If th e a ct s committed b y t h e a c cused constitute q u alified
s eduction or s i m pl e s e duction an d s e x ual a b u se, h e s h al l b e
prosecuted for the graver crime of sexual abuse instead of seduction.

(People v. Pusing, G.R. No. 208009, July 11, 2016)
FORCIBLE ABDUCTION
Forcible abduction is committed by any person, who abducts
with lewd designs (1) a woman against her w i ll , or (2) a w oman

below 12years of age. (Article342; 1951 Bar Exam)
Abduction
Where the accused abducted and transported the victim to a
place where he will be killed, and thereafter, the victim was killed,
the crime committed is murder. Kidnapping is not committed since
the deprivation of liberty is just incidental to the crime of murder.
(People v. Estacio, Jr., G.R. No. 171655, July 22, 2009)
W here the accused abducted and t r a nsported the victim t o
a place where she will b e r a ped, and t h ereafter, the victim w a s
raped, the crime committed is r ape. Forcible abduction for being
an indispensable means to commit r a p e i s a b sorbed. (People v.

Almanzor, G.R. No. 124916, July 11, 2002)
Where the accused abducted and transported the victim to a
safe house for the purpose of killing him, and detained him therein
f or an appreciable period of ti me, and th ereafter, the victim w a s
killed, the cr ime committed i s k i d n apping w it h h o m i cide. Since
there is intent to deprive liberty for the victim was detained in a safe
house, and he was killed in the course of detention, kidnapping with
homicide is committed even the original design is to kill the victim.
(People v. Mercado, G.R. No. 116289, November 29, 2000)

725

W here the accused kidnapped and detained the vi ctim n o t
for purpose of ki l l in g hi m o r r a p in g h er , an d subsequently, th e
victim was kill d or raped as an afterthought, the crime committed
is kidnapping with h o micide or k i dnapping with r a pe. (People v.
Mercado, supra)
Lewd Design
Lewd design is an element of forcible abduction and consented
abduction. Lewd design must be present at the precise moment that
the accused abducted the victim.
K issing th e v i c ti m s everal t i m e s w i t h i n t e n tion t o m a r r y
her after abducting her may not establish lewd design; (People v.
Crisostomo, G.R ¹ . L - 1 9 0 84, February17, 1928) but kissing the
victim, touching her thighs, and lifting her skirt i m mediately after
abduction (Peovle v. Jose, G.R. No, L-28282, February 6, 1971); or
forcibly embracing her, kissing her, and handling her against her
will (People v. Castillo, G.R. No. L-125, July 26, 1946) is an evidence
of lewd design.
Aurora, single, 29 years old, on her way back to her house in
Polo, Bulacan,accompanied by her sister, was forcibly abducted by
Ernesto, one of her suitors. Ernesto kissed her several times while
he was holding her in his arms to prevent her from running away.
The abductor took his victim away to another town where they were
o vertaken by A u r c r a's brother. E r nesto released his victim a n d
disappeared. Ernesto was Aurora's suitor for several years. To his
proposals of marriage Aurora has always answered in the negative.
So, he decided to abduct her with no other intention but to marry her.
(1956Bar Exam) Since there is no showing that Ernesto and Aurora
have legal impediments to marry each other, the intention of the
former to marry the latter is not an evidence of lewd design, which is

an element of forcible abduction. Several kissing without commission
of other acts are not sufficient to establish lewd design. Without lewd
design, abducting the victim constitutes illegal detention. (People v.
Crisostomo, G.R No. L-19084, February 17, 1928) Since the victim is

J9JC9B0M

726

VOLUME II

a woman, which is a qualifying circumstance, the crime committed
is kidnapping and serious illegal detention.
In People v. De Lara, G.R. No. 124703, June 27, 2000, Rolando
with co-accused carried his ex-girlfriend, who refused reconciliation,
to force her to marry h i m . T h ereafter, Rolando raped the victim.
To constitute abduction, the taking away of a woman against her
will must be proven to have been made with lewd designs. Hence, it
was incumbent upon the prosecution to prove that the three accused
were actuated bylewd design. The prosecution failed to do so, except
with respect to Rolando. While it is enough that at least one of the
accused entertained lewd design in order to convict all of the three
of forcible abduction, such lewd intent, however, must be known to
all accused who cooperated in the commission of the felony. In the
case bar, it was not proven that other accused had knowledge of the
lewd designs entertained by Rolando. Rolando was convicted of rape
through forcible abduction while his co-accused were convicted of
grave coercion.

Forcible Abduction cannot absorb Rape
Sexual intercourse is not a n e l ement of f o r cible abduction
( .S. v. Ramirez, supra); hence, it follows that rape is not inherent
in forcible abduction. Forcible abduction can be committed without
raping the victim. Thus, forcible abduction cannot absorb rape.
Rape absorbs Forcible Abduct ion
Settled is the rule that if the main objective of the accused is
to rape thevictim, the crime committed is rape. Forcible abduction
is absorbed. The doctrine ofabsorption rather than Article 48 of
the Revised Penal Code is applicable since forcible abduction is an
indispensable means to commit rape. (People v. Mej oraday, G.R. No.
102705, July 80, 1998; People v. Almanzor, G.R. No. 124916; July
11, 2002; People v. Sabadlab, G.R. No. 1 75924, March 14, 2012)
Complex crime of rape through forcible abduction

Against the Will or Un der 12 Years of Age
The element of against the will is present where the abduction
was committed by means of violence or intimidation.
A is charged with t h e f o rcible abduction with l e wd d esigns
of X, agirl, 16 years old and Y, a 20-year old female friend of X.
The evidence shows that the abduction was with consent. Forcible
abduction is not committed because the abduction with lewd design
was not committed against the will of the victims, who are not under
12 years of age. (1961 Bar Exam)
Forcible Abduction absorbs attempted rape
In, case the offender attempted to rape the abducted victim,
forcible abduction absorbs attempted rape (or acts of lasciviousness).
The attempted rape was itself the external manifestation of lewd
design, which is an element of forcible abduction. Hence, the crime
committed isforcible abduction and not complex crime of attempted
rape through forcible abduction. (People v. Egan, G.R. No. 189888,

May 28, 2002)
Forcible abduction could not be committed without lascivious
conduct such as kissing the sensitive part of the victim's body; thus,
forcibleabduction absorbs attempted rape or acts of lasciviousness
because the latter is inherent in former. (U.S. v. Ramirez, G.R. No.

L-18997, March 8, 1919)

Iff orcibleabduction is a necessary means to commit rape, this
is a complex crime proper under Ar t i cle 48 of the Revised Penal
Code. (People v. Jose, G.R. ¹. L - 2 8 2 32, February6, 1971; People
v. Buhos, G.R. No. L-40995, June 25, 1980; People v. Tami, G.R.
Nos. 101801-08, May 2, 1995) Where the victim was abducted with
lewd design and brought t o a h o use (People v. Magdaraog, G.R.
No. L-40988, April ' 5 , 19 8 8;People v. Buhos, G.R. No. L-40995,
June 25, 1980, En Banc; People v. Velasquez, G.R. Nos. 187888-84,
November 28, 2000) in a desolated place (e.g.,uninhabited grassy
upland) (People v. Caraang, G.R. Nos. 14842-27, December 11, 2008)
or forest (People v. De Lara, G.R. No. 124708, June 27, 2000) where
she was raped,forcikle abduction should be treated as a necessary
means to commit rape, and thus, the crime committed is a complex
crime of rape through forcible abduction.
Maita was the object of Solito's avid sexual desires. Solito had
a ttempted many times to entice Maita to a date in bed with h i m
but Maita had consistently refused. Fed up with all her rejections,
Solito abducted Maita an d br ought her t o a h o use situated '
desolated part of the town. There, Solito succeeded in having carnal

knowledge of Maita against her will. (2017 Bar Exam) Solito is liable
for complex crime ofrape through forcible abduction.
CONSENTED ABDUCTION
Consented abduction is committed by any person, who abducts
with lewd designs a virgin and a minor, who is not under 12 years

J9JC9B0M

with her consent. (Article 848) The taking away of th e offended
party must be with her consent,after solicitation or cajolery from
the offender. (Perez v. CA, G.R. No. 80888, November 29, 1988)
Virginity
T here are only tw o c r i mes where vir ginity of t h e v i cti m i s
a n element, and t h ese are, qualified seduction except when t h e
qualifying circumstance is relationship, and consented abduction.
Virginity is presumed if victim is unmarried and of good reputation,
or a virtuous woman of good reputation. (People v. L ee, G.R N o .
189070, May 29, 2002) In simple seduction, good reputation of the
victim is an element.
Virginity as an essential ingredient of the crime of consented
abduction should no t b e u n d er stood i n i t s m a t e r ial s ense and
does not exclude the i dea of a b duction of a v i r t u ous woman of

good reputation (U.S. v. Casten, G.R. No. 11488, August 19, 191 6)
b ecause the essence of the offense is not th e w r ong done to t h e
woman, but the outrage to the family and the alarm produced in it
by the disappearance of one of its members. (Valdepenas v. People,
G.R. No. L-20687, April 80, 1966)
In Valdepenas v. People, supra, the information alleged that
the victim is a minor and accused took her by taking advantage of
the absence of her mother from their dwelling and carried her to a
secluded spot to gain carnal intercourse with her with lewd designs.
This allegation implies that the victim is a minor living under patria
protestas, and hence, single, thus leading to the presumption that she
is a virgin apart from being virtuous and having a good reputation.
The presumption of innocence includes also, that of morality and
decency, and as a consequence, of chastity.
Minority
In forcible abduction under second paragraph of Article 342,
the victim must be under 12 years of age. In consented abduction
under Article 343, the victim must be a minor, who is above 12 years
of age.
If a v i r gi n i s a b ducted wit h l e w d d esign by he r b o yfriend
with her consent on her 12th birthday, there is doubt whether the
crime committed is forcible abduction or consented abduction. The
consenting victim in f orcible abduction must be under 12 years of
age. On the other hand, the victim in consented abduction must be

!

above 12 years of age. Since the woman is exactly 12 years of age
when the abduction was committed, she is neither under nor above
12 years of age. Settiedis the rule in caseof doubt the accusedsho ld
P
s u
be
e convicted of the lesser crime. Since the penalty for c cnsented
abduction is lighter t han t hat for f orcible abduction, the accused
should be held liable for consented abduction. The phrase "above 12
years of age" in A "ticle 343 on consented abduction should be read as
"12 years of age and above."
Lewd Design
In forcible abduction or c onsented abduction, th e erin inal
act must be committed with l ewd design. If the victim regardless
o f age is abduc-.ed without lewd design, but against her wi ll , t h e
crime committed is kidnapping and serious illegal detention since
the victim is a woman. (Article 267) If the victim, who is a minor,
is abducted withcut lewd design but with consent obtained ihrough
solicitation, the "rime committed is inducing a minor to abandon her
parents' home. (Article 271)
Despite the offender knows the she cannot legally consent tc the
marriage because of her minor age and yet he elopes with her, his
intention to marry gives rise to the presumption that the abduction

is committed with l ewd design. Hence, accused is liable for comented
abduction. (People v. Crisostomo, G.R. No. L-19084, February 17 ,

1928)
The accused believes that he can marry a m i nor. because o
such belief, he takes a girl 14 years of age with her consent to a
judge for the purpose of marrying her. He is not liable for ccnsented
abduction unless he performed acts showing lewd design. Intent to
marry accomparied with the belief that he is capable of marrying
the abducted minor does not constitute lewd design. (see: U.S'. v.

Galves, 5 Off. Gaz., 98 cited in U.S. v. Santiago, G.R. ¹.
January 29, 191.5)

T9898,

~

If the offender and the woman forcibly abducted are both of

Solicitation
In forcible abduction, the criminal act i s committed against
the will of the victim. However, the consent of a woman under 12

years of age is not recognized by law. Hence, abduction of a woman
under 12 yearsof age is considered as having been made against her
will. In consented abduction, the criminal act is committed with the
consent of the victim obtained through solicitation or cajolery.
Juan and Petra(girlof 17 years of age) were found by the latter's
parents in a compromising situation. Sometime later, the parents
severely scolded their daughter for having brought dishonor to the
family because they discovered that Juan had filed an application for
marriage with another woman. Immediately after such upbraiding,
Petra left her house, and, together with Juan who was waiting tor
her outside the house, went to and stayed in the latter's house, the
two having sexual intercourse occasionally thereat. (1966 Bar Exam)
Juan is not l i able for consented abduction since there is no
showing that the consent of Petra to stay in his house was obtained
through his solicitation or cajolery. (People v. Palisoc, 6 CA. Rep.
65) Nor is Juan liable for simple seduction since there is no showing
that he employed deceit such as promise to marry to have sexual
intercourse with P etra. N either i s J u a n l i a ble for sexual abuse.
Sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct with a child per se is not
a crime. What is punishable under R.A. No. 7610 is sexual abuse
with a child. Sexual abuse is more than a mere sexual intercourse or
lascivious conduct with a child. (see: People v. Hon. Court of Appeals,

G.Il. No. 171868,August 20, 2008)
A with lewd designs, took a 18-year old girl to a nipa hut i n
his farm and there had sexual intercourse with her. The girl did not
offer any resistance because she was infatuated with the man, v.ho
was good-looking and belonged to a rich and prominent family in the
town. (2002 Bar Exam)
A is notliable for forcible or consented abduction since there is
no showing that abduction was committed against the will of the girl
or her consent to the abduction was obtained through his solicitation
or cajolery. Nor is A l i a ble for simple seduction since there is no
showing that he employed deceit such as promise to marry to have
sexual intercourse with the girl. Neither is A liable for sexua' abuse.

PROSEC UTION OF CRIMES AGAINST CHASTITY
Crimes against chastity, except corruption of minor and white
slavery, are private crimes, which cannot be prosecuted de officio.

prosecution of seduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness; and
(8) mode of extinguishing criminal liability arising from seduction,
abduction, or acts of lasciviousness.
PROSEC UTION OF ADULTERY OR CONC USINAGE
Under Article844, there are three pre-conditions to prosecute
an offender for adultery or concubinage, to wit: (1) the offended spouse
must file a complaint for adultery or concubinage; (2) the offended
spouse cannot i n s t i t ut e c r i m i nal p r osecution w i t h out i n c luding
the guilty parties; and (8) the offended spouse must neither have
consented, expressly or impliedly, to the adultery or concubinage
nor pardoned, expresslyor impliedly, the offenders.
Complaint
Adultery or concubinage, which is a private crime, cannot be
prosecuted unless the offended party filed a complaint against the
offender. The action for crimes against chastity cannot be prosecuted
upon the I nformation of th e fi scal. (People v. Zurbano, G.B. No.

733

Bigamy is not a crime against chastity. It i s a crime against
civil status of a person. Hence, it is a public offense. Thus, the rule
on the inclusion of guilty parties in the complaint for adultery or
concubinage is not applicable to bigamy. The first w ife can file a
criminal case for bigamy against her h u sband who contracted a
second bigamous marriage without including the second wife. (1981

offended parties in bigamy depending on the circumstances. (Garcia

Philippine law does not recognize divorce, Wendy shall be considered
as a married person, and not as a divorcee; hence, despite the foreign
divorce, Wendy is still an "offended spouse" within the contemplation
of Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code for the purpose of filing a
complaint for concubinage.

offended spouse can file a complaint for preliminary investigation
a gainst the offender for bi gamy an d th e f i scal can i n stitute t h e

crime, they are not allowed to intervene in the proceeding through
counsel. Under Section 16, R ul e 11 0 o f t h e R u l es of C r i m i nal

prosecution of the offense.
Express or implied pardon in adultery and concubinage

Charging both guilty part y
In adultery, the offended husband must include his wife and
her paramour. In concubinage, the offended wife must include her
husband and his concubine in the institution of criminal prosecution.
Wendy and Hecky were newly married. While Hecky was away
in a foreign land, Wendy had sexual intercourse with Pedro. In a
preliminary investigationfor adultery, the investigating prosecutor
finds Pedro didnot know that Wendy was a married woman. Hence,
the fiscal filed an adultery charge against Wendy only. (1982 Bar
Exam) T he fiscal committed a mistake. The law requires that the
inclusion of both the wife and her paramour in th e complaint for
adultery, which must be filed by the offended husband in court. The

In case of adultery and concubinage, pardon must be given by
the offended spouse to both offenders to beeffective. (Concepcion
v. Savellano, tr., G.R. No. 131728 March 9, 1998) Pardon as a bar
to criminal action for adultery or concubinage is either express or
implied. (Ligtas v. Hon. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-47498, May 7,

When the offended husband in writing or in an affidavit asserts

that he is pardoning his wife and her paramour for adultery is a

conjugal home afterher arrest for adultery only in order to take care
of their children. (Ligtas v. Hon. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-47498,
May 7, 1987)

In Ligtas v. Hon. Court of Appeals, supra, after the complainant
reported the crime of adultery topolice authorities, he asked the
Chief of Police to hold in abeyance the filing of the case as he had in

mind of giving his wife apology as he took pity on his young children
a nd his w i fe. H owever, he executed an af fi davit w h er e I e w a s
granting forgiveness to his wife and paramour subject to a condition
that she lives separately from her paramour. However, complainant
relented in his plan to grant pardon to his wife and her paramour is
demonstrated bythe fact that after two days he executed a complaint
for adultery. There is neither such express nor implied pardon. It
is obvious that the affidavit t hat th e complainant executed was a
mere declaration of intention to pardon his wife and her paramour.
Subsequent acts of the complainant show that he changed his mind
and decided to continue with the prosecution of the case.
Express or implied Consent in Adultery or Concubinage
Consent as a bar to criminal action for adultery or concubinage
is either express or implied. (People v. Sensano, G.R. ¹. L - 8 7 7 20,
March 27, 1988)
A notarized document wh ere th e h u sband allowed his w i f e
to get anew partner is void. However, it is a competent evidence
t hat the husband. gave consent to the adultery committed by hi s
wife. (People v. Gu in ucud, G.R. No. L - 8 8672, October 27, 1983)
This prior consent of the husband to the infidelity of his wife shall
be a bar to the institution of criminal action for adultery, (People
v. Schneckenburger, G.R, No. L - 4 8188, November 10, 1941) and
disqualify him from the benefit of death or physical injuries under
exceptional circumstance under Article 247. (2018 Bar Exam)
Failure to take any action against the accused for seven years
despite knowledge of her adulterous relations with another person
warrant the inference that he consented to the crime of adultery.

Hecky and Wendy are married. Hecky cohabits with Cathy, the
wife of Hector despite the fact that they know of each other's marital
status. Wendy cohabits with Pedro, who knows her marital status.

Cohabitation has been going on for five years with the knowledge
of Hecky and Wendy of each other's infidelity. What are the crimes

735

committed, and can they be prosecuted for these crimes? (1961 Bar

Exam)
Suggested answer:
Cathy, a married woman, committed as many counts of adultery
as there are sexual intercourses with Hecky, a man other than her
husband, in the course of their cohabitation. Hecky also committed
such crimes of adultery since he is aware of the marital condition of
Cathy. The offended party in t hi s adultery is Hector. They can be
prosecuted for these crimes since Hector did neither pardon Cathy
nor give consent to this crime.
Hecky, a married man, committed concubinage for cohabiting
with Cathy, who is not his wife. Cathy is also liable for concubinage
since she is aware of the marital status of Hecky. The offended party
in concubinage is Wendy. However, they cannot be prosecuted for
this crime since the circumstance that Wendy knows the infidelity of
Hecky for five years is an indication of implied consent to the crime
of concubinage.
Wendy committed as many counts of adultery as t h ere are
s exual intercourses with Pedro, who i s not he r h u sband, in t h e
course of their cohabitation. Pedro also committed such crimes of
adultery since he is aware of the marital condition of Wendy. The
offended party in t his adultery is Hecky. However, they cannot be
prosecuted for this crime since the circumstance that Hecky knows
the infidelity of Wendy for five years is an i n dication of implied
consent to the crime of adultery.

with a mental age of 8 was not considered as incompetent. In People
v. Dela Cruz, G R. No. 135022, July 11, 2002, if a minor under the
Rules of Court can fil e a c omplaint for a c r i m e against chastity
independently of her parents, complainant, then 20 years of age who
was found to have the mentality of an 8-year old girl, could likewise
fil e the complaint independently of her relatives. Her complaint can
be rightfully considered f iled by a minor.

When it is said that the requirement in Ar t i cle 344 regarding
the filing of complaint b y t h e o f fended party or h e r r e l atives is
jurisdictional, what is meant is that it is the complaint that starts
the prosecution proceeding. It i s not th e complaint which confers
jurisdiction on th e court t o t r y t h e c ase. The court's jurisdiction
is vested in it b y t h e J u diciary L aw. (People v. Babasa, G.R. No.

October 26, 2001)
N on-compliance with A r t i cl e 34 4 i s n o t j u r i s dictional. Th e

to the exercise by the proper authorities of the power to prosecute the
guilty parties. (Valdepenas v. People, G.R. No. L-20687, ApriL 80,
1966) And such condition has been imposed out of consideration
for the offended woman and her family who might prefer to suffer
the outrage in silence rather than go through with the scandal of a
public trial. (People v. Castel, G.R. No. 171164, November 28, 2008)
Right to file complaint
The rules pertaining to th e r i ght of th e victim i n seduction,
abduction,or acts of lasciviousness, her relatives and State to fi
le a
complaint against the offender are as follows:
1. V ic t i m is an adult —
If the victim of seduction, abduction,
or acts of lasciviousness is an adult, she has the exclusive right to file
a complaint against the offender.
The parents of an adult v i ctim cannot file a complaint for a
private crime against the offender. If the victim is already of age
and is in complete possession of her mental and physical faculties
no one would dispute her paramount right to avenge the wrong done
to the exclusion of her parents and other relatives. (Benga-Oras v.
Evangelista, G.R. No. L-8558, September 28, 1955)
2.

Vi ct i m i s a m i n o r —A minor has the right to i n i t i a te

the prosecution of the offenses of seduction, abduction and acts of
lasciviousness independently of her parents. (Section 5, Rule 110 of
the Rules of Criminal Procedure)
However, the minor, who is a victim of seduction, abduction,
or acts of lasciviousness, cannot file a criminal complaint against
the offender ifshe is incompetent or incapable of doing so.(Section
5, Rule 110 of the Rules of Criminal P rocedure) But, an i m becile

737

3.
P a r e n t s of the minor victim —
Where the minor, who is
a victim of seduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness, fails to file
the complaint, her parents may file the same. (Section 5, Rule 110 of
the Rules of Criminal Procedure)
The parents of the minor vi ctim i n s eduction, abduction, or
acts of lasciviousness can validly initiate the filing of the complaint
against the offender. (People v. Excija, G.R. No. 119069, July 5 ,
1996) If the minor victim does not want to file the complaint against
her offender, her parents may do so being under obligation to render
protection to t h ose under t h ei r p o wer an d l a w fu l g u a r dianship
and to represent them in the exercise of all the actions which may
redound to their benefit. (Benga-Oras v. Evangelista, supra)
The mother or th e f a ther of th e m i nor v i ctim i n s eduction,
abduction, or acts of lasciviousness alone can validly in i t i ate the
filing of the complaint against the offender. In People v. De la Cruz,
G.R. No. L-28810, March 27, 1974, the father of the offended girl
in crime against chastity did not restrain or prevent his wife from
filing the complaint for crimes against chastity. It is highly probable
that he tacitly approved it. He did not pardon the offender. Being
occupied in the daily task of earning a living for his family, he had no
time to spare for a criminal investigation. Under the circumstances,
the complaint filed by the mother was a sufficient compliance with
the law. The father's passivity should not preclude the mother from
securing redress for the outrage committed against her daughter.
4.
G r an d p a r e nts and guar d ian —Under Section 5, Rule
110 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, where the offended party,
who is a minor, fails to file the complaint (for seduction, abduction
and acts of lasciviousness), her parents, grandparents, or guardian
may file the same. The right to file the action granted to parents,
grandparents,or guardian shall be exclusive ofallother persons and
shall beexercised successively in the order herein provided.
The word "e xclusive" i n t h e r u l e s m e ans t he r i g ht o f t h e
parents of the minor to file complaint for seduction, abduction and

J9JC9B0M

738

CRIMINAL LAW REVIEWER
VOLUME II

XI. CRIMES AGAINST CHASTITY

acts of lasciviousness is exclusive. Hence, the grandparents and
guardian are "excluded" from the entitlement under the rules to file
such complaint. The word "successive" in the rules means that if the
parents of the minor are dead or incompetent, the grandparents will
"succeed "the exclusive right to file such complaint; if the parents and
grandparents of the minor are dead or incompetent, the guardian
will succeed the exclusive right to file such complaint.

If the victim of seduction, abauction, or acts of lasciviousness is
a minor, pardon as a bar to criminal prosecution must be given by
both the minor and her parents.

The word guardian appearing in Article 344 refers to a guardian
legally appointed by the court. I n t h i s p r ovision, the inclusion of
the guardian is only to invest him wit h th e power to sign a sworn
written complaint to initiate the prosecution of three crimes against
chastity. (People v. Flores, G.R. No. 188815, August 25, 2010)
The so-called exclusive an d s u ccessive r ul e i n s e d u ction,
abduction and acts of lasciviousness do not apply to adultery and
concubinage. Only the offended spouse in adultery or concubinage,
and no other, is authorized by law to i n i t i ate the action therefor.
Corollary to such exclusive grant of power to the offended spouse
to institute the action for adultery and concubinage, it necessarily
follows that such initiator must have the status, capacity or legal
representation to do so at the time of the filing of the criminal action.
This is a familiar and express rule in civil actions; in fact, lack of
legal capacity to sue, as a ground for a motion to dismiss in civil
cases, is determined as of the filing of the complaint or petition. A
foreigner, who obtained a divorce in a country, cannot file a complaint
for adultery against his former wife and her paramour since he is
not an offended spouse anymore. (Pilapil v. Ibay-Somera, G.R. No.
80116, June 80, 1989)
5. State — If
the offended party dies or becomes incapacitated
before she can file the complaint, and she has no known parents,
grandparents or g u ar dian, th e S t at e shall i n i t i at e th e c r i m i n al
action in her behalf. (Section 5, Rule 110 of the Rules of Criminal
Procedure)

a ct s of

If the victim of seduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness
is an ad u lt, she has the exclusive right to e xpressly pardon the
offender. The parents of the adult victim cannot pardon the offender.
As the pr i v ate crime essentially an d d i r ectly affects the i nj ur ed
party, she alone can pardon the offender. (U.S. v. Luna, G.R. No.
892, September 11, 1902)

739

Pardon given b y t h e p a r e nt s w i t h out t h e c o ncurrence of
the minor will not effectively bar th e criminal prosecution of the
offender for seduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness (U.S. v.
Luna, supra) unless the minor is dead or incapacitated. (People v.
Arguelles, C.A., G.R. No. 612, March 81, 1987; Revised PenaL Code
by Justice Luis Reyes)
Pardon given by the minor victim without the concurrence of her
parents or guardian will not effectively bar the criminal prosecution
of the offender forseduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness
(People v. Lacson, Jr., C.A., 56 O.G. 9460) unless the minor has no
parent or guardian, orthey are dead or incapacitated. (People v.
Inciong, C.A., 1 O.G. 904, October 26, 1942) The concurrence of the
parents of the minor is required because the latter in her tender age
and lack of sufficient knowledge would hardly know the full impact
and consequences of her acts. In her indifference and inexperience,
the parents are given th e r i gh t a n d p ower t o p r otect her. (T h e
Revised Penal Code by Justice Luis Reyes; 1970 Bar Exam )
Either th e m i nor v i ctim o r p a r ent can fil e a c o mplaint f or
seduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness. But pardoning the
offender in this crime must be given by both the minor victim and
parents to bar the criminal prosecution.
Express pardon
Pardon as a bar t o criminal action for seduction, abduction,
and acts of l a sciviousness must b e ex pressly gi ven. (People v.
Dollano, Jr., G.R. No. 188851, October 19, 2011; Perez v. Court of
AppeaLs, G.R. No. 80888, November 29, 1988) Under Article 344, the
offenses ofseduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness, shall not
be prosecuted x x xifthe offender has been expressly pardoned by
the above-named persons.
The delay of more than nine years in filing the case for qualified
seduction against the accused is not tantamount to pardon by the
offended party. Pardon as a b ar to c r i m i nal a ction for seduction
must be expressly made. Moreover, the length of time it took her to
file the case is of no moment considering that she filed it within the
10-year prescriptive period for qualified seduction. (Perez v. Court of

can bar criminal prosecution of adultery or concubinage.

seduction,abduction, or acts of lasciv ousness because there is as a
general rule only one guilty party.

Seven years of acquiescence on the part of the husband in the
adultery of hi s w if e w a r r ants an i n f erence that h e consented to
the adulterous relations existing between the accused. Because of
this implied consent, husband is not authorized by law to institute
criminal proceeding for adultery. (People v. Sensano, supra)
Consent in seduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness
Consent is no t a b a r t o c r i m i na l p r osecution of se duction,
abduction, o r a c t s o f l a s ci viousness.H o wever, c onsent of t h e
offended party may negate "force or intimidation" as an element of
acts of lasciviousness or "against the will" as an element of forcible
abduction. But consent is not a defense in other cases such as consent
given by theoffended party under 12 years of age or by a demented
or mentally retarded victim in acts of lasciviousness.
Rape is a public crime
Rape was a private crime before for being a crime against
chastity. However, R.A. No. 8353 has reclassified rape from crime
against chastity to crime against person. Hence, rape is not a private
crime anymore. In sum, rape is a public crime, the prosecution of
which can be made de officio (People v. Mariano, G.R. Nos. 13551118, November 17, 2000); or it c an b e p r o secuted even without a
complaint filed by the aggrieved party. Pardon by the offended party
of the offender in the crime of rape will not bar criminal prosecution.
(see: People v. Bonaagua, G.R. No. 188897, June 6; 2011) The parents
of the victim (or any other person) can file the complaint for rape
since this is a public crime. (1987 Bar Exam)
Mode of ba r r in g C r i m i na l P r o secution for C r i m e s Against
Chastity
Crimes against chastity are private crimes; hence, there are
procedural conditionsfor the prosecution of these crimes.
In adultery or concubinage, it i s r e quired that th e offended
party must fi l e a c o mplaint. I n s e duction, abduction, or a cts of
lasciviousness,that offended party or her parents, grandparents,
guardian or State may file a complaint.

741

I n adult r y o r c o ncubinage, the consent or p a r don by t h e
offended party as abar to criminal prosecution is either express or
implied. In seduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness, pardon
by offended party or her parents,grandparents, or guardian as a
bar to criminal prosecution must be express; consent in this crime
may or may not be a defense; but it is not a mode of barring criminal
prosecution.
The term "pardon" in Article 344 pertains to that given after the
commission of crime against chastit; w h ile "consent" refers to that
given before (People v. Schneckenourger, G.R. No. L-48188, November

of criminal action for crimes agair st chastity must be given prior to
the institution thereof. Pardon or consent given after the institution
of criminal action for pr i v ate crime does not extinguish criminal
liability (Peoplev. Miranda, G.R. ¹. 88 1 71,October 6; 1982; People

nor consent a g.ound for the dismissal of the criminal case once the
action has been instituted. The prosecution of the case continues
even ifthe off nded party pardons the offender after the case has
been instituted. (People v. Alcante, supra) The reason for this rule is
that the true aggrieved party in a criminal prosecution is the People
of the Philippines. Once filed, control of the prosecution for a crime
against chastity is removed from rhe offended party's hands. (People

Pardon mentioned in Article 89 of the Revised Penal Code, which is
a mode of extinguishing criminal liability, pertains to that given by
the President in the exercise of pardoning power under Section 19,
Article VII of the 1987 Constitution.
Private pardon as a bar to criminal prosecution applies to
seduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness. Executive pardon as
a mode of criminal extinction applies to any crime.
Private pardon as a bar to criminal prosecution of seduction,
a bduction, or a cts of l a sciviousness must b e m ade p r ior t o t h e

MODES OF C RIMINAL EXTINCTION IN
CHASTITY

C R IMES AGAINST

Under Article 89 of the Revised Penal Code, criminal liability
is totally extinguished by th e m a r r i age of th e offended woman,
as provided i n A r t i c l e 3 4 4 o f t h i s C o de . G i ven p u b li c p o l i cy
c onsiderations of r e spect for t h e s a n ctity o f m a r r i age an d t h e
highest regard for the solidarity of the family, the court must accord
accused, who married the offended party, the full benefits of Article
89. (People v. De Guzman, G.R. No. 185848, March 8, 2010)
Marriage in Seduction, Abduction, or Acts of Lasciviousness
Under Article344, in cases of seduction, abduction, or acts of
lasciviousness, the marriage of the offender with the offended party
shall extinguish the criminal action or r emit th e penalty already
imposed upon him. The provisions of this paragraph shall also be
applicable to the co-principals, accomplices, and accessories after
the fact of the abovementioned crimes.

Marriage in Rape
B efore, rape as a c r i m e a g ainst c h astity w a s i n c l uded i n
Article 344 on marriage as a mode of criminal extinction. Since rape
is now a crime against person, it is deemed deleted in Arti cle 344
according to JusticeRegalado. In case of rape, the applicable rule
is now Article 266-C of the Revised Penal Code as amended by R.A.

743

No. 8353. Under this provision, subsequent marriage between the
offender and offended party shall extinguish the criminal action
or penalty. (2002 Bar Exam) Ho wever, there is no rule in A r t i c le
266-C that such marriage will also extinguish the criminal liability
arising from rape of the co-principal, accomplice, or accessory. It is
the submission of this writer that marriage will not extinguish the
criminal liability arising from rape of the co-principal, accomplice,
or accessory.
The extinguishment of criminal action or penalty under Article
266-C and Article 344 is tantamount to extinguishment of criminal

liability.
Marriage made after the finality of :he conviction for rape will
extinguish the criminal liability of the accused and remit the penalty
imposed by the court upon him. In Peop!e v. De Guzman, G.R. No.
185843, March 8, 2010, the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal of
the accused and affirmed his conviction for rape on March 27, 2008."
Accused filed a motion to absolve him from criminal liability because
he and the pri~ ate complainant contracted marriage on "August 19,
2009." The Supreme Court said marriage to-.ally extinguishes the
criminal liability of accused arising from rape and the corresponding
penalty that may have been imposed upon those found guilty of the
felony.

Valid Marriage
T o extinguish c r i m i na l l i a b i l it y a r i s in g f r o m seduction,
abduction, or acts of lasciviousness in accordance with Article 89 in
relation to Article 344, the marriage must be valid. (U.S. v. Santiago,
G.R. No. L-27972, October 3I, 1927) Under Article 266-C, the crime
of rape shall not be extinguished or the penalty shall not be abated
if the marriage is void ab initio.
Marriage in Bad Faith
T he m a r r i age o f t h e o ffender w i t h t h e o f f e nded p a r t y
e xtinguishes th e c r i m i na l a c t ion f o r r a p e u n l ess t h er e i s an
indication that the marriage was entered in-.o in bad faith. (People
v. Velasco, G.R. No. L-28081, January 21, 1974) Where the marriage
was entered into by the offender and the victim for the former to
escape from the criminal consequences of rape without bona fide
intention of making her his wife, such marriage will not extinguish
his criminal liability. (U.S. v. Santiago, G.R. No. L-27972, October

A seduced B a woman and was subsequently convicted While
serving sentence, A married B but immediately after the ceremony,
he abandoned her. Marriage, which is entered into in bad faith for
the sole purpose of escaping the penal consequence of seduction, will

not extinguish the criminal liability of A. (1975 Bar Exam)
M odes o f B a r r i n g C r i m i n a l P r o s e cution a n d M o d e s o f
Criminal Extinction
T he modes of b a r r in g c r i m i nal p r osecution should no t b e
c onfused with th e m odes of extinguishing criminal l i ability. T h e
first rule is procedural while the second is substantive.
A mode of barring criminal prosecution (e.g.,pardon) must be
present before the institution of criminal case while the modes of
extinguishing criminal liability (marriage) may arise even though
the offender is already serving sentence by final judgment.
In adultery or c oncubinage, pardon or c onsent, express or
implied, by the offended spouse is a bar t o cr i m inal prosecution;
but Article 344 has no provision on mode of extinguishing criminal
liability in this crime.
In seduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness, (1) express
pardon by the victim, or by minor victim and her relative is a bar
to criminal prosecution, and (2) marriage between the offender and
o ffended party is a mode of extinguishing criminal liability of th e
offender, his co-principal, accomplice, or accessory.
In rape, marriage is a mode of extinguishing criminal liability
of the offender. However, pardon is not a mode of barring criminal
prosecution ofrape. But in marital rape, forgiveness (pardon) is a
mode of extinguishing criminal liability.
X seduced 1, a minor. He was prosecuted for seduction. After
pleading for fo rgiveness, Y without e ven consulting her p a rents,
pardoned X. Pardon will not extinguish the pending criminal action
against X. Marriage between X and Y and not a mere pardon can
extinguish the criminal liability of X. (1976' Bar Exam) Pardon as
a bar to criminal prosecution must be made prior to the institution
of the criminal action for seduction. Moreover, such pardon without
the concurrence of the parents of the minor is not a bar to criminal
prosecution.

Death of the offended party
Death of the offended party i n a c ase for adultery is not a
mode of extinguishing criminal l i ability w h ether t otal or p a r t i al .

The participation of the offended party is essential not for the
maintenance of th e c r i m inal a ction bu t s olely for t h e i n i t i a tion
thereof. It is true, the institution of the action in private crimes is at
the option of the aggrieved party. But it is equally true that once the
choice is made manifest, the law will be applied in full force beyond
the control of the offended party, and in spite of his death. (DonioTeves v. Vamenta, G.R. No. L-38308, December 26; 1984)
Pari delicto
Pari delicto is not mentioned in Article 344 of the Revised Penal
Code
o e as a circumstance that will bar criminal prosecution for crimes
against chastity. In Vera-Neri v. People, G.R. No. 96715, November
19, 1991, the accused in an adultery case argued that her husband,
the complainant, i s p r e sently c ohabiting w i t h a n o t her w o m an
(which constitutes concubinage). In sum, the accused is invoking
the principle of pari delicto as a defense. The defense was rejected.
According to the Supreme Court, the concept of pari delicto is not
found in the Revised Penal Code, but only in Article 1411 of the Civil
Code, which relates only to contracts with illegal consideration. The
case for adultery does not involve any illegal contract which either of
the contracting parties is seeking to enforce. (2018 Bar Exam'

CIVIL LIABILITY IN CRIMES AGAINST CHASTITY
Person guilty ofrape, seduction or abduction, shall also be
sentenced: (1) to indemnify the offended woman; (2) to acknowledge

moved down to touch her breast several times. Accused thereafter
told her not to report to anybody what he did to her. This was not the
first time that the incident happened. The court found that there is
I ewd design on the part of the accused. He was convicted of sexual
abuse.
3.
I nt e r v e n t i o n of t h i r d
pe r s o n —The i n t e r vention
by a third person isnot necessary to convict an accused for child
prostitution under Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610. A child exploited in
prostitution may engage in sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct

regardless of whether or not a "bugaw "is present. Child prostitution
is committed even if a child voluntarily submitted himself or herself
to lewd design of the accused for a consideration of monetary or
otherwise, without a third person intervention. (Quimvel v. People,
G.R. No. 214497, April 18, 201 7)
4.
Coe r c i o n o r I n fl u e nce —In sexual abuse, coercion is
either physicalor psychological. Taking advantage of ascendency as
a swimming instructor over student is psychological coercion. (People
v. Larin, G.R. No. 128777, October, 71 998) The assurance of love,
guarantee that she would not get pregnant by using the withdrawal
method and the promise of marriage were classified as psychological
coercion and influence within the purview of Section 5 of R.A. No.
7610 used by the accused to convince his minor girlfriend to have
sex with him. Hence, accused is guilty of sexual abuse. (Caballo v.
People, G.R. No. 198782, June 10, 2018)
With a promise of reward, Robert asked Romy to bring him a
young girl that he can have carnal knowledge with. Romy enticed a
15-year-old lass through cunning and deceit of Romy to voluntarily
go to the house of Robert whe "e the latter subsequently had carnal
knowledge with her. Robert, and Romy on the basis of conspiracy
can be held liable for sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of R.A. No.

adult or group. (2018 Bar Exa n)

by the offender who is liable for sexual abuse or child prostituticn
under this provision. Rather, the "coercion or influence" is exerted
upon the child by " adult" (syndicate, or group), who is l i able for
promoting, facilitating or inducing child prostitution under Secticn

held that Malto is correct that consent is immaterial in cases under

748

5 (a) thereof. In sum, coercion or influence of any adult (e.g., pimp) is
employed againstthe child to become a prostitute. The "coercion or
influence" is not the reason why the child submitted herself to sexual
intercourse,but it was utilized in order for the child to become a
prostitute. (People v. Tulugan, G.R. No. 227868, March 12, 2019)
With due respect to the Supreme Court in the Tu l u gan case,
this writer has a different position on the matter. Since the advent
of R.A. No. 7610, the Supreme Court i n s e veral cases affirmed
the convictions for sexual abuses of the accused, who themselves
e mployed coercion or influence in order for th e m i nor v i ctims t o
submit themselves to lascivious conduct.
In Qu i m v el v. Pe o ple, G . R. N o . 2 1 4 4 97, A p r il 1 8 , 2 0 1 7 ,
participation of a th ir d person is not essential in sexual abuse. It
is immaterial wh ether or no t t h e a ccused himself employed the
coercion or influence to subdue the will of th e child for tne latter
to submit to his sexual advances for him to be convicted of sexual
abuse. Sexual abuse can be committed by "any adult, syndicate or
group" without qualification.
In Rarang v. People, G.R. No. 226760, August 14, 2019, Satur
v. People, G.R. No. 245875, June 19, 2019, People v. Veron, G.R. No.

2019, and De Joan v. People, G.R. No. 282957, September 25, 2019,
the accused were convicted of lascivious conduct (sexual abuse) under
Section 5 (b) although the coercion or influence is not employed by
adults, who promote, facilitate or induce child prostitution, in order
for the child tobecome a prostitute. In these cases, the accused
themselves employed coercion or influence in order for the victims,
who are minors, to submit themselves to lascivious conduct.
6.
Co n s ent of the victim — In Ma l t o v. People, G.R. No.
164738, September 21, 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that child is
presumed by law to be incapable of giving rational consent to any
lascivious conduct or sexual intercourse. Hence, consent of the child
is immaterial in criminal cases involving child prostitution or sexual
abuse.

However, in People v. Tulugan, G.R. No. 227868, Ivlarch:2,
2019, the Supreme Court, En Banc, abandoned this principle. It was

749

R.A. No.7610 where the offended party is below 12 years of age.
However, consent of the child is material and may even be a defense
in child prcstitution or sexual abuse where the child is 12 years of
age or above. Consent of the child to sexual intercourse or lascivious
conduct may be imp ied if the prosecution failed to prove the element
of money, profit or any other consideration, or coercion or influence.
The essence of child prostitution and sexual abuse is having
s exual i n t ercourse of l a scivious conduct w i t h a child w i t h out
consent. If th e prosecution failed to prove the element of money,
profit or any other consideration, or coercion or influence, consent
o f the child t o s exual i n t ercourse or l ascivious conduct may b e
implied. Sexual intercourse "with consent" of the child is not child
prostitutior or sexual abuse. (People v. Tulugan, supra) Conversely,
if the prosecution p"oved the element of money, profit or any other
consideration, or coercion or influence, lack of consent of the child
to sexual irt ercourse or lascivious conduct may be implied. Hence,
sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct "w ithout consent" o f the
child is child prostitution or sexual abuse.
7.
Al l e g a t i ons —
The elements of child prostitution or sexual
abuse must. be alleged in the I nformation. Without allegations of
the specific elements of t h i s c r im e (e.g., coercion or in f lu e nce),
the accused cannot be convicted thereof even if the caption of the
Information charged hi m w i t h s e x ual a b use (People v. Ra yon,

G.R. No. 194286, January 80, 2018) or the body thereof alleged
commission of acts of lasciviousness upon a child exploited in sexual
abuse, which is a conclusion of law. (People v. Pangilinan, G.R. No.
188090, November 14, 2011) However, the accused may be convicted
of acts of lasciviousness under the Revised Penal Code (Pielago v.
People, G.R. No. 202020, March 18, 2 018) if the allegation in th e
Informatior contains the elements of this crime.
The Penalty for Child Prostitution and Sexual Abuse

Under Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610, the penalty of reclusion
temporal in its medium period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed
upon those who commit the act of sexual intercourse of lascivious
conduct wit h a c h i l d e x ploited i n p r o stitution or s e xual a buse;

Provided, That when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age,
the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under the Revised Penal Code,

Under the first proviso, the penalty for rape committed against

Code.
Under the second proviso, the penalty for lascivious conduct
committed against an under-12-year-old victim is reclusion temporal
in its medium period. (second proviso)

751

Prosecution for single crime
If the acts constitute sexual abuse (or child prostitution), and
rape or acts of lasciviousness, the offender cannot be prosecuted for
both crimes because ofthe rule on double jeopardy.
The essence ofsexual abuse and rape or acts of lasciviousness
i s having sexual int ercourse or lascivious conduct wit h a v i c t i m
without her consent, or capacity to give consent. Since these crimes
are identical, the Supreme Court in People v. Abay, G.R. No. 177752,
February 24, 2009 ruled that the offender cannot be accused of both
crimes because his right against double jeopardy will be prejudiced.
Other view: In Pe ople v. Ud ang, G.R. No. 210161, January
10, 2018, the Supreme Court, Third D i vision, ruled that offender
can be liablefor rape and sexual abuse because they are separate
crimes with distinct elements. It seems that Udang case is a stray
decision. The Abay principle is controlling since it was affirmed by
the Supreme Court in several cases such as People v. Dahilig, G.R.
No. 187088, tune 18, 2011; People v. Matias, G.R. No. 186469, June
18, 2012; Alberto v. Hon. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 182130, J'une

Prosecution for the graver crime

rape or acts of lasciviousness, the offender shall be prosecuted

SEXUAL ABUSE AND RAPE OR ACTS OF LASCIVIOUNESS
The poorly written provision in Section 5 (b) of RA No. 7610
has created the most complicated rules in criminal law.
Non-application of Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code
If the acts constitute sexual abuse (or child prostitution), and
rape or actsof lasciviousness, the offender cannot be prosecuted for
a complex crime. Sexual abuse for being an offense under special
law cannot be made a component of a complex crime because Article
48 of the Revised Penal Code speaks of a single act constituting
"grave or less grave felonies." An offense under special law is not a
felony. (People v. Abay, G.R. No. 177752, February 24, 2009; People
v. Tulugan, G.R. No. 227868, March 12, 2019)

either under the Revised Penal Code or R.A. No. 7610 (People v.
Abay, supra),whichever prescribes a graver penalty. (Dimakuta

v. People, G.R. No. 206518, October 20, 2015; People v. Tulugan,
supra) The higher penalty under either law must be applied for the
minor victim's benefit. Imposing a lower penalty for the offender is

undeniably unfair to the child victim. (People v. Pusing, G.R. No.
208009, July 11, 2016).

lasciviousness — If the acts constitute sexual abuse, and sexual
assault or acts of lasciviousness, the perpetrator shall be prosecuted
under R.A. No. 7610. The penalty under R.A. No. 7610 is graver than

that under the Revised Penal Code. In line with the Tulugan case,
the proper nomenclature of the offense is "lascivious conduct" under

R.A. No. 7610. (People v. Molej on, G.R. No. 208091, April 28, 2018;

crime of lascivious conduct. (See: People v. Molejon, supra) The
term "coercion and influence" is broad enough to cover "force and
intimidation," which are alleged in the information. In fact, as these
terms are almost used synonymously, it is then of no moment that
the terminologies employed by R.A. No. 7610 and by the Information
are different. (Quimvel v. People, G.R. No. 214497, April 18, 2017;

There are special rules under Section 5 (b) of R.A. No. 7610 if
the child exploited in prostitution or sexual abuse is under 12 years
of age. A demented person (idiot, imbecile, and feebleminded), whose

Ra pe —Sexual abuse or child prostitution under R.A. No.
7610 isseparate and distinct from statutory rape under the Revised
Penal Code. Aside from being dissimilar in the sense that the former
is an offense under special law, while the latter is a felony under
the Code, they also have different elements. Nevertheless, sexual
intercourse with a victim who is under 12 years of age or is demented
is always statutory rape, as Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 expressly
states that the perpetrator will be prosecuted under Code. (People v.
Tulugan, supra)
E ven if t h e g i r l w h o i s b e low t w e lve (12) years old o r i s
demented consents to the sexual intercourse, it is always a crime
of statutory rape under the Revised Penal Code, and the offender
should no longer be held liable under R.A. No. 7610. For example,
a nine (9)-year-old girl was sold by a pimp to a customer, the crime
committed by the latter if he commits sexual intercourse with the
girl is still statutory rape (and not child prostitution), because even
if the girl consented or is demented, the law presumes that she is
incapable of giving a rational consent. (People v. Tulugan, supra)

rape under the Revised Penal Code, which includes qualifi e sexual
assault. (People v. Pusing, G.R. No. 208009, July 11, 2016)

"force and intimidation" as alleged in the information. Committing
lascivious conduct against an under-12-year-old child is statutory
acts of l ascivi.ousness. Committing l ascivious conduct against a
child under coercion or influence is sexual abuse. Since the elements
of acts of lasciviousness and those of sexual abuse are proven, the
accused is convicted of acts of l asciviousness under the Revised
Penal Code in relation to R.A. No. 7610. (Quimvel v. People, supra)

be prosecuted for sexual assault under the Revised Penal Code with
the penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period under R.A.

the crime is "sexual assault" under Revised Penal Code in relation

lasciviousness and simple sexual assault.
1. Act s of l a s civiousness —
If the accused committed acts

abuse, who is under 12 years of age or demented, the former shall
be prosecuted for acts oflasciviousness under the Revised Penal
Code with the penalty of reclusion temporal in i ts m edium period
under R.A. No. 7610. In l i n e w i t h t h e Tu l u g an case, the proper
nomenclature of this crime is acts of lasciviousness under Revised
Penal Code in relation to R.A. No. 7610. (People v. Molej on, G.R. Vo.
208091, April 28, 2018; Granton v. People, G.R. No. 226'045, October
10, 2018; Francisco v. People, G.R. No. 241452, March 25, 2019;
1998 and 2016 Bar Fxams)
To apply the penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period
pursuant to the second proviso of Section 5 (b) of RA No. 7610, the
requisites of acts of lasciviousness must be met in addition to the
requisitesfor sexual abuse or child prostitution. (Quimvel v. People,
supra; Ramilo v. People, G.R. No. 284841, June 8, 2019; People v.
Basa, G.R. No. 287849, February 27, 2019)

an under-12-year-old child. Th e i n f o rmation a l l eged "f orce end

the Revised Penal Code but it
does not aver "coercion or influence,"
which is an element of sexual abuse under R.A. No. 7610. But it was

755

The accused forcibly inserted his finger into the genital orifice
of a child, who is 10 years old. The victim is a child exploited in
sexual abuse since the element of coercion is present. Since the
victim is under 12 years ofage, the crime committed is statutory
sexual assault. The penalty for sexual assault under the Revised
Penal Code is prision mayor. On t he other hand, the penalty for
lascivious conduct under the second proviso of Section 5 (b), R.A.
N o.
. 7610 is reclusion temporal in its medium period. To impose the
lighter penalty under the Revised Penal Code is unfair to the victim.
To prevent u n f airness, the Supreme Court i m p osed the gr aver
penalty under R.A. No. 7610. In sum, the accused is convicted of
simple sexual assault under the Revised Penal Code in relation of
R.A. No. 7610. (People v. Chingh, G.R. No. 1 78828,March 16, 201 1)
If hthe courts would not opt to impose the higher penalty under
R.A. No. 7610 in cases of sexual assault, wherein the victims are
under 12 years of age, an accused who commits acts of lasciviousness
under Revised Penal Code in relation to R.A. No. 7610, suffers the
more severe penalty of re clusion temporal in i t s m e d ium p eriod,
than the one who commits sexual assault which is punishable by
vrision mayor. (People v. Talibog, G.R. No. 288112, December 05,
2018) Moreover, R.A. No. 7610 is a special law which should clearly
prevail over R.A. No. 8353, which is a mere general law amending
the Revised Penal Code. (G ranton v. Pe ople, G.R. No. 22 6'045,

BIGAMY
Bigamy is c o mmitted by a n y p e r s on w ho s h a ll c o ntract a
second or subsequent marriage before the former marriage has been
legally dissolved,or before the absent spouse has been declared
presumptively dead by means of a judgment rendered in the proper
proceedings. (Article 849)
The elements of bigamy are: (1) the offender has been legally
married; (2) the first marriage has not been legally dissolved, or in
case his or her spouse is absent, the absent spouse has not been
judicially declared presumptively dead; (3) he contracts a subsequent
marriage; (4) the subsequent marriage would have been valid had it
not been for the existence of the first (Marbella-Bobis v. Bobis, G.R.
No. 188509, July 81, 2000); and (5) fraudulent intention. (People v.
Manuel, G.R. No. 165842, November 29, 2005; 2018 Bar Exam)
Events Subsequent to the Consummation of Bigamy
During the pendency of the case for bigamy, the complainant,
the first w if e of t h e accused died. According to th e accused, he
should not be convicted of bigamy since there was no longer any
impediment to marry his second wife. The argument is untenable.
At the time the accused married his second wife, his marriage with
his first wife is still subsisting. Hence, the crime of bigamy is already
consummated. Death of the complainant after the consummation of
the crime of bigamy will not extinguish the criminal liability of the
accused for bigamy since that is not a mode mentioned in Article 89
o f the Revised Penal Code. Lack of legal impediment to marry hi s
second wife after the consummation of the crime of bigamy is not a
defense since what is important is his legal impediment at the time
that he married his second wife. (1981 Bar Exam)
Bigamy is consummated upon contracting the second marriage
d espite th e s u b sistence of t h e fi r s t m a r r i a ge. Once th e c r i m e
consummates, criminal liability will attach to the accused. After the
consummation of bigamy or celebration of the second marriage, the
criminal liability shall not be extinguished by subsequent events not

presumption is that the marriage exists. I'herefore, he who contracts
a second marriage before the judicial declaration of nullity of t h e

However, in La s anas v. People, G.R. No. 1 59031, June 23,

X is liable for bigamy involving the second marriage on the

Declaration of nullity of the first marriage obtained after the

CBP is lega ly married to OEM. Without obtaining a marriage
license, CBP contracted a second marriage to RST. CBP is liable for
bigamy if he fraudulently secured a Certificate of Marriage such as
presenting a falsified affidavit of cohabitation instead of marriage
license. He is not allowed to use the nullity of the second marriage
as a defense. Hov ever, if he did not fraudulently secure a Certificate
of Marriage, and.later used this criminal act as basis for seeking
her exculpation, he is not liable for bigamy. He is allowed to use
the nullity of the second marriage as a defense in bigamy. But he is
liable for illegal marriage. (2004 Bar Exam)
Subsequent Annulment of Second Marriage
If the second marriage was annulled in a civil action due to
force or intimidation committed against the accused in bigamy t o
obtain his consent in entering such marriage, he should be acquitted.
A subsequent mar riage contracted by t h e a ccusedinvoluntarily
cannot be the basis f' or conviction for the crime of bigamy. (Landicho

i th e second marriage was annulled in civil action due to force or
intimidation committed by the accused in a bigamy case to obtain
the consent of the other party in m a r r y ing him, he should not be
acquitted on this ground. Since the accused was the one who used
the force or intin idation, he may not use his oivn malfeasanceto
defeat the action for bigamy based on his criminal act. (People v,

Presumption of Death
I n bigamy, the second marriage must be entered into w i t h
fraudulent i n t ent (intencion fr a udulente) wh ich i s a n e s s ential
element of a felony by dolo. The element of fraudulent intention is
not stated in A r t i cle 349, because it is u n doubtedly incorporated
in the principle antedating all codes, and, constituting cne of the
landmarks of our Penal Code, that, where there is no willfulness
there is no crime. (People v. Manuel, G.R. No. 165842, November 29,

2005)
However, where anabsentee spouse isbelieved to be dead, there
must be a judicial declaration of presumptive death. Before such
declaration,the remarriage of the other spouse is bigamous even
if done in good faith. Article 41 of the Family Code, which requires
judicial declaration of presumptive death, is intended to protect the
p resent spouse from a cr i m i nal p r osecution for bi gamy w it h t i e
judicial declaration that the missing spouse is presumptively dead,
the good faith of the present spouse in contracting a second marriage
is already established. (People v. Manuel, supra)
If the absent spouse has been missing for four ccnsecutive
years, or two consecutive years, if the disappearance occurred where
there is danger of death under the circumstances laid down in Arti cle 391 of the Civil Code, and the present spouse has a well-found d
belief that the absentee is dead, the latter may file a summary proceeding for the declaration of presumptive death of the absentee.
(Republic v. Nolasco, G.R. No. 94058, March 17, 1998; Article 41 of
the Family Code) If there is a jud icial declaration of presumptive
death, the present spouse can remarry without violating the law on
bigamy. The first marr iage having been extinguished by the presumptive death of the first spouse cannot be considered as existing
when the second marriage was contracted.
Divorce Obtained by a Foreign Spouse
Where a marriage between a Filipino citizen and a fcreigner is
validly celebrated and a divorce is thereafter validly obtained abroad
by the alien spouse capacitating him/her to remarry, the Filipino
spouse shall have capacity to remarry under Philippine law. (par. 2

of Article 26 of the Family Code) The capacity of the Filipino spouse
to remarry, however, depends on whether the foreign divorce decree
capacitated the alien spouse to do so. (Corpuz v. Sto. Thomas, GN.

The rule under par. 2 of Article 26 of the Family Code includes
cases involving parties who, at.
the time of the celebration of the
marriage were Filipino citizens, but later on, one of them becomes
naturalized as aforeign citizen and obtairis a divorce decree. The
F ilipino spouse should li k ewise be allowed to r emarry a s i f t h e
other party we "e a foreigner at the time of the solemnization of the
marriage. (Republic v. Orbecido III, G.R. No. 154880, October 5, 2005)
The Orbecido case will not apply if there is no competent evidence
concerning naturalization of the alien spouse and the divorce decree,
which capacitated the alien spouse to remarry. (Sarto v. People, G.R.
¹. 2 0 6284, February 28, 2018)
In a bigamy case, accused alleged that complainant, his wife,
acquired Canadian citizenship, obtained a divorce, and thereafter,
remarried. By "aising divorce, it is incumbent upon the accused to
show that it was validly obtained in accordance with complainant's
n ational law (e.g., Canadian law) p r ior t o t h e celebration of t h e
second marriage. In thiscase, accused presented a certificate of
divorce allegedly issued by the registrar of the Supreme Court of
British Columbia. Th e d efense was r ejected. Fi r s t, th e d i v o rce
decree required toprove the fact of divorce is the judgment itself as
rendered by the foreign court and not a mere certification. Second,
assuming the certificate of divorce may be considered as the divorce
decree, it was not accompanied by a certification issued by the proper
Philippine diplomatic or consular officer stationed in Canada, as
required under Section 24of Rule 132. Lastly, no copy of the alleged
Canadian law was presented by the defense. Thus, it could not be
reasonably determined whether the subject divorce decree was in
accord with complainant's national law. Accused was convicted of
bigamy. (Sarto v. People, supra)
In the recent case of Republic v. Manalo, G.R. No. 221029, April
24, 2018,the Supreme Court, En Banc, extended the application of
Article 26(2) of the Family Code to further cover mixed marriages
where it was the Filipino citizen who divorced his/her foreign spouse.
Thus, pursuant to Ma n a lo case, foreign divorce decrees obtained
to nullify marr ages between a Filipino and an alien citizen may
already be recognized in this jurisdiction, regardless of who between
the spouses initiatedthe divorce: provided, of course, that the party
petitioning for the recognition of such foreign divorce decree must
prove the divorce as afact and demonstrate its conformity to the
foreign law allowing it. (Dela Cruz v. Morisono, July 2, 2018, G.R.

Adultery, Concubinage, and Bigamy
If A, a married man, cohabited with B, a married woman, the
offended wife of A can file a complaint against A and B for concubinage
and the offended husband of B can file a complaint against B and A
for adultery.It is a criminal act partaking of the nature of a double
crime. (Del Prado v. De la F uente, G.R N o . 92 7 4, September 14,
1914) If
A married B, they are also liable for two counts of bigamy in
addition to concubinage (see: Revised Penal Code, Book Ttvo by Luis
Reyes) and adultery. These crimes are distinctive from each other.
A m ar ried p erson can c ohabit w i t h h i s m i s t r ess w i t h out
marrying her; or he can marry his mistress without cohabiting with
her. Hence, bigamy and concubinage are not m u t u ally exclusive
crimes.
B igamy, a d ultery, a n d c o n cubinage ar e d i s t i n guished a s

follows:
1.
Co n c e p t —The e ssence of a dultery is h a v i ng s exual
i ntercourse by a m a r r i e d w o ma n w i t h a m a n o t h e r t h a n h e r
husband with the risk of introducing spurious heirs into the family.
The gist of concubinage is cohabiting or maintaining a mistress by a
married man in violation of his marital vow to the humiliation of his
own wife. Bigamy is committed by the celebration of a subsequent
marriage despitethe subsistence of a valid marriage; this crime is
being punished to preserve and ensure the juridical tie of marriage
established by law.
2.
N um b e r of crimes —
There are as many crimes of adultery
as there are sexual intercourses between the wife and paramour
because every intercourse poses a risk of introducing spurious heirs
into the family. (see: People v. Zapata, G.R. No. L-8047, May 16 ,
1951) On the other hand, cohabiting or scandalously maintaining a
mistress regardless of the number of sexual intercourses constitutes
a single c r im e o f c o ncubinage. Bi gamy ca n b e c o m m i t ted b y
cohabiting for a period of time, which may involve several sexual
i ntercourses. Hence, the number of th e cr ime of bigamy wil l n o t
d epend on th e n u mber of sexual i n t ercourses committed i n t h e
course ofcohabitation.

771

4.
O ff e n d e d P a rty —In adultery, the offended party is the
husband of the offender while in concubinage, the offended party
is the wife of the offender. In th e crime of bigamy, both the first
spouse and second spouse may bethe offended parties depending on
the circumstances, as when the second spouse married the accused
without being aware of his previous marriage.
5.
Se c o n d ary Of f e n d er — In t h e c r i me of b i g a
b th
t he first and second spouses may be the offended parties depending
on the circumstances; but the second spouse can be held liable as
an accomplice to bigamy if h e/she had knowledge of the previous
marriage of principal offender. (Santiago v. People, G.R No. 200288,
July 15, 2015) In adultery, the paramour is also liable as principal
for this crime if he is aware that the woman is already married at the
time of sexual intercourse. (Article 888 of RPC) In concubinage, the
concubine is also liable as principal for concubinage if she is aware
that her man is already married at the time of cohabitation. However
the penalty for the concubine is only destierro and not imprisonment.
(Article 384)
ILLEGAL MARRIAGE
Illegal marriage is committed by any person who shall contract
m arriage knowing t h a t t h e r e q u irements of t h e l a w h a v e n o t
been complied with orthat the marriage is in disregard of a legal
impediment provided that the act is not constitutive of bigamy. The
crime is qualified if either of the contracting parties shall obtain the
consent of the other by means of violence, intimidation, or fraud.
(Article 850; 1958 Bar Exam)
Bigamy is committed by any person who contracted a second
or subsequent m a r r i age before th e f o r mer m a r r i' age

Article 350 on illegal marriage is a catch-all provision, which covers
all illegal marriage except bigamous marriage. (1969Bar Exam)
Tong and Teresa got married before ajudge. Teresa is below
18 years old.Their marriage was contracted because Teresa and
her mother, Petra, at the instigation of Tong, assured the judge who
solemnized the marriage ceremony that Teresa was 19 years old and
that her father was already dead. Upon Tong's prodding too, Petra
gave her consent. The crime committed is il legal marriage. (1993
Bar Exam)
In U.S. v. Hernandez, G.R. No. L-9405, December 24, 1914,
accused who seduced a 15-year-old girl to live with him by procuring
the performance of a fictitious marriage ceremony with the help of
Bautista, who pretended to be a Protestant minister, was held liable
for the complex crime proper of simple seduction through usurpation
of official function. Usurping the function of a priest to solemnize
marriage isa necessary means to seduce a minor. (1955 and 1985
Bar Exams)
The case of Hernandez was decided prior to the effectivity of
the Revised Penal Code. At that t i me, a religious official such as a
bishop is a person in authority within the purview of the Old Penal
Code. (U.S. v. Smith, G.R, No. 14057, January 22, 1919) However,
the Revised Penal Code was passed during the American regime.
T hus, in crafting A r t i cle 152 of t h e R evised Penal Code on t h e
definition of person in a u t hority, th e Code committee considered
American principles such as the doctrine of separation of State and
church and the non-establishment rule. In v iew th ereof, religious
officials were not listed in Article 152 as persons in authority.
Since a priest is not a person in authority anymore, usurping
the function of a priest by solemnizing marriage does not constitute
usurpation of f u n ction u n der A r t i cl e 17 7 o f t h e R e vised Penal
C ode. The crime committed i s i l l egal m a r r i age qualified by t h e
c ircumstance of by m eans of f r a ud. A t p r esent, the facts in t h e
Hernandez case constitute c o mplex c r i me o f s i m p l e s e d uction
through illegal marriage. However, Hernandez principle pertaining
to the complex crime of simple seduction thr ough usurpation of
function is still applicable if the accused usurped the function of a
mayor in solemnizing marriage, which is necessary means for his
co-accused to commit simple seduction.

P ERFOR M A N C E OF ILLEGAL MARRIAGE CEREM O N Y
Performance of i l l egal m a r r i age ceremony is c ommitted by
priests or m i n i sters of a r e l i gious denomination or sect, or civil
authorities who shall p e rform o r a u t h orize an i l l egal m a r r i age
ceremony. (Article 352) The elements of this crime are as follows:
(1) authority of the solemnizing officer; and (2) his performance of
an illegal marriage ceremony. (Ronulo v. People, G.R. No. 182438,

July 2, 2014)
A person who entered into an i l l egal marr iage is li able for
bigamy under Article 249 or illegal marriage under Article 250. On
the other hand, the priest, minister or civil authority who performed
such bigamous marriage (Sermonia v. Hon. Court of Appeals, G.R.
No. 109454, J'une 14, 1994) or illegal marriage such as marriage
without license (Ronulo v. People, G.R. No. 182438, July 2, 2014),
is liable for performance of illegal marriage ceremony under Article
252.
A priest who performed a marriage ceremony despite knowledge
that the couple had no marriage license isliable for performing
illegal marriage ceremony. The non-filing of a criminal complaint
for illegal marriage under Article 250 against the couple does not
negate criminal liability of the priest. Article 352 does not make this
an element of the crime. (Ronulo v. People, supra)
Considering that t his crime is an i nt entional felony, it must

be committed by means of dolo. Hence, good faith is a defense. A
clergyman, who is not aware that one of the contracting parties is
a minor, is not criminally liable for performing an illegal marriage
ceremony. (U.S. v. San Juan, G.R No. 8502, October 10, 1913)
T he la w s e t s t h e m i n i m u m r e q u i r ements constituting a
marriage ceremony, which is an element of performance of illegal
marriage ceremony: first, there should be the personal appearance of
the contractingparties before a solemnizing officer;and second, their
declaration in the presence of not less than two witnesses that they
take each other as husband and wife. For purposes of determining if
a marriage ceremony has been conducted, a marriage certificate is
not included in the requirements. (Ronulo v. People, supra)

the documents to Mayor Abral for hi s signature. In th e mar r iage

Abral. (2015 Bar Exam)
Since the mayor is absent, his chief of staff solemnized the
marriage between two persons, and later turned over the docum nts
to Mayor Abral for his signature. The chief of staff, who performed
the act of solemnizing marr iage, which pertained to th e m a yor,
person in a u thority, w i t h out b eing l awfully en t i t led t o d o so, is
liable for usurpation of function under Ar t i cle 177. The crime of
performance ofillegal marriage ceremony under Article 352 is not
committed because this crime can only be committed by a person
who is authorized to solemnize marriage. (Ronulo v. People, G.R. No.

182488, July 2, 2014; 2019Bar Exam)
Mayor Abral is liable for falsification of public document by a
public officer under Ar t i cle 171. Making an u n t r u t h ful st atement
b y stating i n a m a r r i age contract, a p u b li c document, that t h e

or dissolution or annulment of mar r i age is liable for the crime of
premature marriage. (1987 and 1950 Bar E x ams) However, R.A.
No. 10655 decriminalizes premature marriage by repealing Article
3 51. Premature m a r r i age wa s d ecriminalized since A r t i cle 3 5 1
discriminates women because this provision is not a p plicab e to
men. Moreover, Article 351 sought to prevent a possible confusion
as to whether the father of the child born after the dissolution of the
marriage is the first husband or the second. This preventive measure
is not anymore necessary since paternity and filiation could now be
easily determined through modern technology such as DNA test.

contempt of a natural or juridical person, or to blacken the memory
of one who is dead. (Article 858; 1947 and 1950 Bar Exams) The

word "libel" in the English text of this provision should be read as
"defamation."

If ddefamation is committed by m e ans of w r i t i ng, p r i i i t i i i g,
lithoograp"y, e n graving, radio, phonograph, p ainting, t h eatrical
exhibition, cinematographic exhibition, or any similar means, the
crime is libel. (Article 855; 1965 Bar Exam) If it i s c ommitted by
oral means, the crime is slander or oral defamation. (Article 858)
If it is committed by performance of an act not punished as libel
or slander, which shall cast dishonor, discredit or contempt upon
another person, the crime is slander by deed. (Article 859; 1947and
1961 Bar Exams)
ELEMENTS OF DEFAMATION
To commit th e cr ime of d efamation (libel, oral defamation,
and slander by d eed), the f ollowing r equisites must concur: (a)
the writing, utterance or acts must be defamatory; (b) it must be
malicious; (c) it must be given publicity; and (d) the victim must be

identifiable.

insurance company. The incessant publication of th e defamatory
A rticles attacking the honor and r eputation of complainant i s a
proof of defendant's malicious scheme to malign and defame the
name, honor and reputation of the complainant.

In d.etermining whether a statement is defamatory, the words
used are to be construed in their entirety and should be taken in
their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning as they would naturally
be understood by persons reading them, unless it appears that they
were used and understood in another sense. Moreover, a charge is
sufficient if the words are calculated to induce the hearers to suppose
and understand that the person or persons against whom they were
uttered were guiltyof certain offenses or are sufficient to impeach
the honesty, virtue or reputation or to hold the person or persons
up to public ri dicule. (Manila B u l l e tin P ub lishing Corporation v .
Domingo, G.R. No. 170841, July 6, 2017)

Th
here are two kinds of malice, malice in law and malice in fact.

776

A publisher of the Baguio Daily was sued by Pedro Aguas for
libel for the public publication of his picture with th e notice that:
"This is to inform the public that M r. P edro Aguas whose picture
appears above has ceased to be connected with the Sincere Insurance
Company as underwriter as of December 81, 1987. Any transaction
entered into him af t er said d a te w ill n ot b e honored." (1988 Bar
Exam) The published notice is not defamatory. It merely informed
t he public that Pedro Aguas is not a n ymore connected with t h e
company. Moreover, the publication was not made with dolo since it
is thepractice of companies to make notice to the public regarding
the non-recognition of transaction with a person who is not anymore
connected with the company. This notice is for the protection of the
interest of the company and the public as well.
Malice
Malice is an element of libel or defamation. There is malice in
fact when the author of the imputation is prompted by personal illwill or spite and speaks not in response to duty but merely to injure
the reputation of th e p erson who claims to h ave been defamed.
(Alonzo v. CA, G.R. No. 110088, February 1, 1995)
In Yuchengco v. Alfonso, G.R. No. 184315, November 25, 2009,
in a span of one month, defendants wrote and published and caused
the publication o f s e ven l i b elous A r t i cles against c omplainant

philanthropist, his political inclination, and as an employer in hi s

M al i c e i n L aw — E ve r y d e f a matory i m p u t a t ion i s
presumed to be malicious, even if it be true, if no good intention and
justifiable motive for making it is shown. (Article 864 of the Revised
Penal Code) When the imputation is defamatory, the prosecution
n eed not prove malice on the part of t h e defendant, for th e l aw
already presumes that t h e d efendant's imputation i s m a l i cious.
Presumed malice is called malice in law. The burden is on the side
of tl e accused to show good intention and justifiable motive in order
to overcome the legalinference of malice.

2. M a l i ce in act
F —The following circumstances will negate
the presumption of malice in a defamatory statement: (1) if there is
a good intention and justifiable motive for making it is shown; (2) if
the defamatory statement is a privileged communication.
I f th e d e f amatory i m p u t a tion i s covered by a qualified
priv leged communication, defamatory imputation is not presum d
me
t o be malicious. Hence, actual malice must be established beyond
reasonable doubt to prove the crime of libel or defamation. Actual
malice is also known as "malice in fact."
I f t hh e defamatory i m p u t ation i s covered by a n a b s olute
privileged communication, lack of malice in making a defamatory
imputation is conclusively presumed. Libel or d efamation is not
committed because "malice in law or in fact," which is an element
thereof, is lacking.
Publicity
Writing to a person other than the person defamed is sufficient
t o constitute pu blication, for t h e p e rson t o w h o m t h e l e t ter i s
addressed is a third person in relation to its writer and the person
defamed therein. The wife of the person defamed is, in context, a
third person to whom the publication was made. (Magno v. People,
G.R. No. 188896; January 27, 2006; 1969 Bar Exam)

material isthat a third person has read or heard the libelous
statement, for a man's reputation is the estimate in which others
hold him, not the good opinion which he has of himself. Simply put,
in libel, publication means making the defamatory matter, after it
is written, known to someone other than the person against whom
it has been written. The reason for this is t hat a communication
of the defamatory matter to the person defamed cannot injure his
reputation though it may wound his self-esteem. A man's reputation
is not the good opinion he has of h i mself, but th e estimation in
which others hold him. (Manila Bulletin Publishing Corporation v.

Domingo, G.R. No. 170341, July 5, 2017)
Exposing a letter containing defamatory imputation to a third
person constitutes publication. Thus, sending a defamatory letter
enclosed in asealed envelope by special messenger to the plaintiff
by the defendant is not libel because the element of publication is
not present. On the other hand, sending a defamatory letter, which
is unsealed, or not shown to be sealed, through a messenger is libel
since the element of publicity is present. (People v. Silvela, G.R. No.
L-0610, May 26; 1958; 1969 Bar Exam)
A defamatory lettercontained in a closed envelope addressed
to another constitutes sufficient publication if the offender parted
with its possession in such a way that it can be read by person other
than the offended party. If a s ender of a l i belous communication
knows or has good reasons to believe that itwill be intercepted
before reaching the person defamed, there is sufficient publication.
The publication of a libel, however, should not be presumed from
the fact that th e i m mediate control thereof is parted with u n less
it appears that t h ere i s r e asonable probability t ha t i t i s h e r eby
exposed to be read or seen by third persons. (Belen v. People, G.R.

No. 211120, February 18, 2017)
In Belen v. People, ibid. a r e solution was issued dismissing
a complaint for estafa filed by th e accused. He filed a motion for
reconsideration with th e prosecutor's office and copy furnished to
respondent in the estafa case and Office of the Secretary of Justice.
The motion for reconsideration contains irrelevant and defamatory
statement against the investigating prosecutor. Despite the fact that
the motion was contained in sealed envelopes, it is not unreasonable
to expect that persons other than the one defamed would be able to
read the defamatory statements in it. Hence, the element of publicity
in libel is present.

XIII. CRIMES AGAINST HONQR

779

Identifiable Offended Party
To satisfy th e element of id e n tifiability, it m u s t b e s h o wn
that atleast a third person or a stranger was able to identify the
offended party as the object ofthe defamatory statement. It is
e nough if by i n t r i n sic reference the allusion is apparent or if t h e
publication contains matters of description or reference to facts
and cir"umstances from which others reading the article may know
the person alluded to;or if the latter is pointed out by extraneous
c ircumstances so that t h ose knowing such person could and di d
unders-.and that he was the person referred to. (Manila Bu lletin
Publishing Corporation v. Domingo, supra)
ln Diaz v. People, G.R. No. 159787, May 25, 2007, a libelous
article defaming "Miss S" does not give a suff icient description or
other indications which identify "Miss S." In short, the article fails
to show that "Miss S" and the complainant are one and the same

person. Although the article is libelous, complainant could not have
been the person defamed therein.
Because of a pendency of a labor dispute, two belligerent labor
un:ons had confrontation in a picket line during which the President
and the Secretary of one union shouted to the members and officers
of the r val union composed of men and women, the following: "Mga
supot, mga wa l ang b ayag, mga k a b it n g I n t s i k, m ga t u t a, m ga
segunda mano." The President and the Secretary of said union are
not liable for oral defamation because the element of identifiability
of the prsons defamed is not present. (1998 Bar Exam)
In Ma n i l a B u l l e t in P u b l i s hing C o r poration v. Do mingo,
supra, the accused published an article where he stated that these
national employees should be commended for bringing into the open
this garbage that has piled up in their own backyard. To Joe Con's
successor, the chopping board is ready. All you need is a Muslim kris!

Palakulin mo, Pare ko! This is not libelous. On the first statement,
accused is merely commending the DTI employees who brought into
the open t heir complaints against the private complainant in t h i s
case, a DTI officer. This is a fair remark. The last three sentences

me"ely meant that heads should roll at the DTI office, which does
not ascribe something deprecating against complainant. Moreover

In People v. Aquino, G.R. Nos. L-8777-79, August 14, 1956,
Corazon Aquino uttered in public "You, Merrera lawyers, are stealers,

shameless, impolite." The accused was convicted of oral defamation.
The offended parties are identifiable. They are lawyers belonging to
the Merrera family.
Members of aparticular group can be offended parties in libel.

781

LIBEL OR WRITTEN DEFAMATION
Libel is committed by means of writing, printing, lithography,
engraving, r adio, p h onograph, p a i n t i ng , t h e a t rical e x h i bition,
cinematographic exhibition, or any similar means. (Article 855)

(People v. Aquino, supra) However, if the membership in the group
is so large, the element of identifiability of the offended parties is
not present. Thus, one, who published a st atement "l a h at n a n g
Americano eh maniac," is not liable for libel.
Declarations made about a large class of people cannot be
interpreted to advert to an i dentified or identifiable individual. A
lecture imputing corruption in Bureau of Customs and the Bureau of
Internal Revenue is not actionable absent circumstances specifically
pointing the defamation to particular persons. (2008 Bar Exam)
In MVRS Publications, Inc. v. Islamic Da'wah Council of the
Philippines, Inc., G.R. No. 135308, January 28, 2003, the accused
wrote in a newspaper Bulgar "Na ang mga baboy at kahit anong
uri ng h a yop sa Mi n d a n ao ay hi n d i k i n a k a in n g m g a M u s l i m /
Para sakanila ang mgaito ay isang sagradong bagay. Hindi nilait o
kai langang kainin kahit na sila pa ay magutom at mawalan ng ulam
sa tuwing sila ay kakain. Ginagawa nila itong Diyos at sinasamba
pa nila ito sa tuwing araw ng kanilang pangingilin lalung-lalo na sa
araw na tinatawag nilang Ramadan." The accused was acquitted of
libel because the identifiability of the offended parties, which is an
element of libel, is not present. The Muslim community is too vast
as to readily ascertain who among the Muslims were particularly
defamed. The size of the group renders the reference as indeterminate
and generic as a similar attack on Catholics, Protestants, Buddhists
or Mormons would do.
In Eliseo Soriano v. People, G.R. No. 225010, November 21,
2018, theaccused Soriano, through a religious radio program, "Ang
Dating Daan," uttered and described the members of Jesus Miracle
Crusade as "isang dakot na gago" and "siraulo." The information does
not refer to any specific individual or pastor but merely mentions
"persons comprising th e Je s us M i r a c le C r u s ade, I n t e rnational
Ministry." The defamatory statements do not single out any specific
pastor and they are not sweeping enough as to injure the reputation
of all the members of JMCIM. The accused is acquitted of the charge

of libel.

M eans to com mi t d e f a m a t i o n
Defamatory imputations, which are made not by publication
in the r ewspapers but by broadcast over the radio, constitute libel.
(2002 Bar Exam)
W iting, printing, radio etc., have a common characteristic, and
that is, their permanent nature as a means of publication, and this
explains the graver penaltyfor libel than that prescribed for oral
defamation. Hence, the phrase "anv similar means" in Art icle 355
should be understood in the light of the said common characteristic
of the means to commit libel. Thus, defamation through an amplifier
constitutes oral defamation under Article 358 and not libel under
Article 355 since its nature as means of publication is not permanent,
and thus, it i s not si m ilar t o r a dio or other means mentioned in
Article 355. i'People v. Santiago, G.R N o. L- 17668, May 80, 1962;
1965 Bar Exam)
Article 355 of the Revised Penal Code did not include television
as a means to commit libel since in 1932 when this law took effect,
there were no televisions in the market. Members of the Philippines
Legislature were not be aware that there was a technology called
television. However, although television is not expressly mentioned
in Artie'e 355, it easily qualifies under the general provision "or any
similar means." (People v. Casten, CA-G.R. No. 07924-CR, December
18, 1974; 2005 Bar Exam) Since the nature of television as a means
of publication is permanent, it should be considered as a means to
commit libel.
L ibel is not a constitutionally protected speech and that t h e
government has an obligation to protect private individuals from
defamation. Indeed, cyber libel is actually not a n ew c rime since
Article 353, in relation to Ar t i cle 355 of the Revised Penal Code,
already punishes it. Online defamation constitutes "similar means"

for committing libel. (Disini v. Secretary of Justice, G.R. No. 208885,
February 18, 2014)

782

In Erwin Tul fo v. People, G.R. No. 161032, September 16, 2008,
the claim of editors and president of Remate, the paper on which the
defamatory articlesappeared, that they had no participation does
not shield them from liability. Article 360 does not provide absence
of participation as a d efense, but r a t her p l ai nly an d specifically
statesthe responsibility of those involved in publishing newspapers
a nd other periodicals. It i s no t a m a t t e r o f w h ether or no t t h e y
conspired in preparing and publishing the subject articles, because
the law simply so states that they are liable as they were the author.
N either th e p u b lisher nor t h e e d i t ors can d i sclaim l i a bilit y f o r
libelous articles that appear on their paper by simply saying they
had no participation in th e preparation of the same. They cannot
say that Tulfo was all alone in the publication of Remate, on which
the subject articlesappeared, when they themselves clearly hold
p ositions of authority in th e newspaper or as the president in th e
publishing company. (2016 Bar Exam)
The criminal l i ability of t h e p r esident of th e company th at
published the libelous articles is the same as that of th e author.
T he crime of l ibel w ould not even be consummated without h i s

participation as publisher of the libelous articles. One who furnishes
the means for carrying on t h e p u b l ication of a n e w spaper and
entrusts its management to servants or employees whom he selects
and controls may be said to cause to be published what actually
appears, and should be held responsible therefor, whether he was
i ndividually concerned i n t h e p u b l i cation o r n o t . A l t h ough t h e
participation of each felon in the crime of libel differs in point in time
and in degree, both author and publisher reneged on the private
duties they owe their fellow men or society in a manner contrary to
the accepted and customary rule of right and duty, justice, honesty,
or good morals. (Ty-Delgado v. House of Representatives Electoral
Tribunal, G.R. No. 219608, January 26, 2016)
CYBER LIBEL
Under Section 4(c)(4) of R.A. No. 10175, cybercrime punishable
includes content-related offenses such as such cyber libel, which is
an unlawful or prohibited act of libel as defined in Article 355 of RPC

783

The phrase"actsconstitute the offense of cybercrime punishable
under this Act" in Section 4(c)(4) of R.A. No. 10175 means that libel
defined under Revised Penal Code committed t hr ough computer
system (cyber libel) is punishable under R.A. No. 10175 and not
under the Revised Penal Code. Unfortunately, Section 8 of R .A.
No. 10175, tle penal provision of the law, fails to prov de a penalty
for cyber libel under Section 4(c)(4). Thus, the offender cannot be
prosecuted for.cyber libel under Section 4 in relation to Section 8 of
R.A. No. 10175. For committing libel through the internet, he should
b e prosecuted for cyberlibel under Revised Penal Code with t h e
qualifying circumstance of use of information and communications
technology under Section 6 of R.A. No. 10175. With this qualifying
circumstance, the penalty for l ibel under Ar t i cle 855 of the Code
shall be increased one degree higher. (2019 Bar Exam)

MULTIPLE PUBLICATIONS RULE
Other jurisdictions have adopted the "single publication" rule,
under which any single integrated publication, such as one edition
of a newspaper,book, or magazine, or one brcadcast, is treated as a
unit, giving rise to only one cause of action, regardless of the number
of times itis exposed to different people.
It issettled however that a single defamatory statement, if
published severaltimes, gives rise to as man r offenses as there are
publications. Each and every publication of the same libel constitutes
a distinct offense. This is the "multiple publication rule" which is
followed in o u r j u r i s diction. (S oriano v. In t e rmediate Appellate
Court, G.R. No. 72888, November 9, 1988; Br i l l a n te v. CA, G .R.
Nos. 118757 and 121571, October 19, 2004) In sum, republication
of a defamatory statement constituteslibel,which is separate and

distinct from the previous libel arising from the first publication of
the same defamatory statement.

understood, has been defined as the speaking of base and defamatory
words which t end t o p r ejudice another i n h i s r e p utation, office,
trade, business, or means of livelihood.

Since l i bel a r i s in g f r o m fi r s t p u b l i c ation of defamatory
statement is different from the libel arising from the republication
thereof, libel is not a continuing crime. The concept of continuing
crime is not compatible with the multiple publications rule. Under
t he continuing cr im e r u le , t h er e i s o nl y o n e l i bel a r i sing f r o m
t wo publications of t h e s am e d efamatory s t atements since t h e
republication thereof is just a continuation of the first publication.
L ibel, Not a Continuing Crim e
There is a t h eory t hat l i bel published through the i n t ernet
is a continuing crime as long as th e defamatory statements are
accessible to the public t h r ough th e i n t ernet. The publication of
the libel in the internet is continuing, and thus, the commission of
libel is also continuing. Under this theory, the one-year prescriptive
period for libel shall not run as long as the libelous statements are
still accessible to the public through the internet.
It is submitted however that this continuing publication theory
will go against the essence of the rule on prescription, and that is,
to fix a r easonable period within w h ich a c r i m i nal action can be
instituted. This view will r ender the crime of libel imprescriptible
since it is of public knowledge that defamatory writings posted in the
internet will be accessible to the public even after several years have
elapsed. Moreover, defamatory articlespublished in a newspaper
such as Inquirer several years ago are still accessible to the public
in the National Li br ary or o t her l i b r aries; and yet, the Supreme
Court in People v. Hon. Gines, G.R. No. 88463, May 27, 1991 did not
consider theaccessibility of the defamation in the newspaper as a
factor in determining when the prescriptive period will commence to
run. In this case, it was held that the prescriptive period of one year
for libel shall commence to run f rom th e day the alleged libelous
article was published.

SLANDER OR ORAL DEFAMATION
Oral defamation i f i t i s o f a s e r i o us a nd i n s u lti ng n a t u r e
constitutes grave slander; otherwise, it is slight slander. (Article 85'8
of the Revised Penal Code)
Slander is a defamation committed by oral (spoken) means,
instead of in wr i t i ng. The term oral defamation or slander as now

785

Grave or Simple Slander
There is grave slander when it i s of a serious and insulting
nature. The gravity of t h e oral d efamation depends not only ( 1)
upon the expressions used, but also (2) on the personal relations
of the accused and the offended party, and (8) the circumstances
surrounding thecase. Indeed, itis a doctrine of ancient respectability
that defamatory words will fall under one or the other, depending
not only upon their sense, grammatical significance, and accepted
ordinary meaning judging them separately, but also upon the special
circumstances of the case, antecedents or relationship between the
offended party and th e offender, which mi ght t en d t o p r ove th e
i ntention of th e offender at th e t i m e . (People v. Pader, G.R. ¹ .
189157, February 8, 2000)
Uttering w ords i m p ut in g i m m orality a g ainst a r e spectable
married lady and her young daughters, who are all prominent in the
social circles (U.S. v. Tolosa, G.R. No. L-12696, November 19, 191 7),
or imputing estafa to the offended party (People v. Balite, G.R. No.
L-21475, September 80, 1966) constitutesgrave slander.
T he social standing and position of th e offended party ar e
also taken into account and thus, it was held that the slander was
grave, because the offended party had held previously the Office of
Congressman, Governor, and Senator and was then a candidate for
Vice President, for which no amount of sophistry would take the
statement out of the compass of grave oral defamation. However,
uttering d e famatory w o rd s i n t h e h e a t o f a n g e r , w ith s o m e
provocation on the part of the offended party (Villanueva v. People,
G.R. No. 160851, April 10, 2006) or calling a Judge a hypocrite and
land grabber in the heat of anger (1988 Bar Exam) constitutes slight
slander.
In De Leon v. Peoplo, G.R. No. 212628, January 1 1, 2 616,
complainant, a policeman, pointed his gun at his jogging buddy, the
accused. During the hearing on administrative case, the accused
stated "walang h iy a, m a n gongotong na p u l i s, yabang m o." T h e
statement is defamatory since it imputes to complainant the crime
of robbery. However, since the statement was made a mere product
of an emotional outburst because of the gun-pointing incident, the
crime is only classified as simple slander.

In the case of People v. Arcand, G.R. No. 46336, September
29, 1939, a priest, who called the offended party a gangster in the
middle of the sermon, is liable for slight slander as there was no
imputation of a crime, a vice, or immorality.
Lando and Marco are candidates in the local elections. In his
s peeches, Lando attacked his opponent Marco alleging that he i s
the son of Nanding, a robber and a thief who amassed his wealth

front ofseveral persons, the crime of simple slander is committed.
For example, a n a c cused, who shouted " p u t ang i n a mo Atty.
Escolango. Napaka walanghiya mo!" at the compla'nant, a lawyer
and candidate for vice mayor, while the latter was conversing with
his political leaders, is liable for simple slander. (Pader v. People,
G.R. No. 189157, February 8, 2000) An accused, who pointed a dirty
finger at the vice-mayor in th e m u nicipal hall i n f r ont of several

through shady deals. (1990 Bar Exam) As a rule, defamation in a

persons, is liable for simple slander by deed. A dirty finger ordinarily

political meeting, when feelings are running high and people could
not think clearly, only amounts to simple slander. (People v. Laroga,
40 O.G. 128) However, imputing to the father of Marco the crime of
robbery and theft is seriously insulting. Hence, the crime should be
classified as serious oral defamation.

connote=- the phrase "fuck you," which is similar to th ex p r e ssion
"puta" o" "putang ina mo," in local parlance. Voile such act is an
expression ofanger and displeasure, itcasts dishonor, discredit, or
contempt upon complainant since she is a lady and a vice mayor,
and it was made in front of several persons. (People v. Villanueva,
G.R. No. 160851, April 10, 2006)

Putang Ina Pr i n ciple
The words "putang i n a m o" a re c ommon expression in t h e
dialect that isoften employed, not really to slander but rather
to express anger or displeasure. Itis seldom, if ever, taken in its
literal sense by the hearer, that is, as a reflection on the virtues of a
mother. (Reyesv. People, G.R. Nos. L-21 528 and L-21 529, March 28,
1969) Thus, the statement "Putang ina mo! Limang daan na ba ito?"
made by the accused cannot be considered as slanderous. (Martinez
v. People, G.R. No. 198694, February 18, 2018) Uttering "putangina"
to minors in the heat of anger is not child abuse. (Escolano v. People,
G.R. No. 226991, December 10, 2018)
Same as words "fuck," "son of a bi t ch," or "m otherfucker" in
America, "hijo de puta" in Spain and, "bakero" in Japan, "putang ina"
is an expletive expression of Filipinos, which cannot be considered
as a sourceof criminality at alloccasions. It is not an exaggeration to
state that numerosity of Filipinos, including President Duterte, are
expressing the words 'putang ina" multiple times on a daily basis.
Obviously, the minds of these Filipinos, who are instinctively using
'putang ina" as part of their language, are not criminal.
The statement "yabang" (boastful or a r r o gant) li ke "p u t ang
ina" is a common expression by Filipinos; hence, it is not defamatory.
(Jamilano v. Court of Appeals, G.R No. L-26059, October 81, 1969)
But the words "malandi kang babae ka" is not a m er e profanity
like "Putang ina m o." It is d e famatory since it i m p u tes to a l ad y
immorality. (Revita v. Rimando, A.M No. 1489-MJ, July 22, 1980)
However, if the statement "putang i n a" is m a de not only t o
express hate ordispleasure but also to defame or insult a person in

B ut i f t h e w o r d s "putang i n a " i s accompanied w i th t h e
statement "papatayin k i t a ," t h e c r i me c ommitted is t h r e at. T h e
utterance "putang in a," is n ot a s e parate crime of slander since
it is merely made to make the threat more emphatic. In sum, the
statement "putang in a" shall be considered as part of the th reat.
(Reyes v. People, supra)
In the course of an angry demonstration by a group of some 20
to 30 personsled by X who had been laid offallegedly by Y, several
threats were hurled against the latter. Among the h a r g es Y filed
against X isfor oral defamation because of Y's alleg d utterance of
the words: Y, putang ina mo. Xis not liable of oral defamation since
the statement "putang ina" is just part of the threat. (2976Bar Exam)
If the statement "putang in a, bu llshit" i:- accompanied with
banging a chair and choking complainant, who is a ady, the crime
c ommitted is serious slander by d eed. The cuss words shall b e
considered as partof the crime of serious sland r by deed. (Mari v.
Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 127694, May 81, 2000)
Stating "Putang ina mo ng bata ka n amumurc ka n asa akin
at susunugin ko yong pamilya mo" against a minor is child abuse.
(Jumaquio v. Villarosa, G.R. No. 165924, January 19, 2009).
P ublici t y

Publicity is an element of slander by deed since it s a specie of
the crime of defamation. Without publicity, the crime committed is
unjust vexation or slight physical injuries.

Single Defamatory Statement Against Several Persons
In People v. Aquino, G.R. Nos. L-8777-79, August 14, 1956,
Corazon Aquino uttered a single defamatory statement addressed
to several persons. She said in public "You, Merrera lawyers, are
stealers, shameless, impolite." Even if t h e re a re s everal persons
defamed, there is one count of grave oral defamation. It was l.eld
that: At common law, a libel on two or more persons contained in
one writing and published by a single act constitutes but one o:"fer se
so as to warrant a single indictment therefor. (State v. Hoshins, 60
Minn. 168) The utterance of the defamatory statement, whicn was
made once and referred toa family of lawyers designated by their
common surname, should be regarded as only one offense.
X a n e w s paper o f g e neral c i r culation i n t h e P h i l i p pin=s,
published in its issue of August 1, 1962, a libelous article accusing
A, B, and C of having acted in confederation to smuggle, as they
did smuggle into th e P h i l i ppines, several i t ems of me r c handise

worth P1,000.00. A resides in Manila; B in Quezon City; and C in
Polo, Bulacan. Applying the Aqui no principle, since there is a single
defamatory statement directed against three persons, there isa
single crime of libel. The criminal liability of the author of this libel
cannot be divided into three distinct and separate offenses. They
should be prosecuted under a single Information and be convicted of
a single count of libel. (1 962 Bar Exam)
Two Distinct Defamatory Statements Against Two Persons
In People v. Del R osario, G.R. No. L - 2 254, April 2 0, 1 950,
accused wrote two d i f f erent and d i s t in ct s tatements again t t o
persons. The f ir s t d e f a m atory s t a t e ment a l l e ged t h at M o r e l o s
preferred Chinese in engaging business while the inhabitants of the
Cebu would suffer, he made money out of the copra ordinance and
he has a gang whose members are only serving for their own good.
The second defamatory statement alleged that Espina was merely
appointed as mayor, goafter and dismiss policemen and emp oyees
w ho are without gu i lt , h e i s t o b e t r a n sferred to th e Capitol i n
order to be made Berdugo of the employees whom they wan-. to
be executed, and he was nearly k i l led by hi s t enants because he
grabbed lands. Accused then pleaded to Cebuanos not to ele"t the
t wo. These published defamatory statements were written in t h e
same article entitled "My Plea to Cebuanos."
According to the trial court, this is a complex crime since there is
singlepublication of two different defamatory statements addressed

XIII. CRIMES AGAINST HONOR

789

to two persons. However, the Supreme Court ruled that there are
two separate crimes oflibel. It was held that there are as many
offenses of libel as there are persons libeled, and the computation
of the number is not the publication but the writ ing or composing

of the libel. From this point of view, there are as many defamations
committed as there are persons defamed. The inclusion of several
persons in a libelous news article is not a product of a "single act"
contemplated in Article 48.
In People v. Gil, G.R. No. L-20398, October 31, 1968, slanderous
statements were uttered on the same date, and at the same place,
albeit against two different persons. The decision in People v. Del
Rosario, supra, for libel is controlling. There are as many offenses of
libel asthere were persons defamed.
The principle in Aquino case must not be confused from that
in Del Rosario. In t he case of Aquino, there is single defamatory
statement addressed to several persons. This constitutes a single
crime of o ra l d e f amation. O n t h e o t h e r h a n d , i n De l R o s ario
case, there are two d if ferent and d i s t inct defamatory statements
respectively addressed to two persons. These two defamatory
statements published under one article constitute tw o counts of
libel and not a compound crime. In sum, although there is a single
p ublication, th e S u preme Court c onsidered th e a cts of w r i t i n g
two different defamatory statements as beyond the contemplation
of phrase "single act constituting two or m ore grave or less grave
felonies" in Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code.
Several defamatory statements Against a single person
In Gonzales v. Arcilla, G.R. No. L-27923, November 18, 1991,
accused uttered "Mang-aagaw ng asawang may asawa! Tib ihon!
Putang I n a M o . W a l an g H i y a ! P a t a y G u t o m!" Th e se s everal
defamatory statements areaddressed against a single person. This
is not a complex crime of multiple libels. Regardless of the number
of defamatory utterances,the accused can only be prosecuted for
a single offense. Note: Settled is the rule that t h e re are as many
crimes of libelor oral defamation as there are persons defamed.
Since there is only one person defamed, there is only one crime of
oral defamation.

Qualified P r i v i l e ged Communication
If the
defamatory st atement i s a q u a l i fied p r i v i leged communication,
there is no malice in law. Hence, to prove libel or defamation, malice
in fact must be established beyond reasonable doubt. The privileged
character of t h e c o m munication i s s u bject t o t h e q u a l i fication
that it i s m ade without malice. If th ere is proof of actual malice,
the defamatory communication is no t p r i v i l eged; hence, libel or
defamation is committed.
Private communication and fair and t r ue report are qualified
privileged communications mentioned in Article 354 of the Revised
Penal Code. These privileged communications under A r t i cle 354
are qualified because of Article 362 of the Code which provides that
j(7 ' 7
libelous remarks or comments connected with the matter privileged
under the provisions of Article 854, if m ade with m al ice (in fact),
shall not exempt the author thereof nor the editor or managing editor
of a newspaper from criminal liability."

provision such as "fair commentaries" on matters of public interest.

Qualified privileged communication in Article 354 is a defense
in a libel or defamation case for two r easons: (I) lack of malice;
and (2) element of publicity is not present because the person or
persons with whom the accused have the privilege to communicate
something defamatory is not a third person. That is the reason why
the title of Article 354 is "requirement for publicity."

I n d i scriminately C o mmunicating Complaint

Qualified privileged communication in Article 354 is a defense in a
libel or defamation case for two reasons: (1) lack of malice; and (2)
element of publicity is not present because the person or persons
with whom the accused has the privilege to communicate something
d efamatory is not a th ir d person. That is the reason why the titl e
of Article 354 is "requirement for publicity." If t he communication
is made to a person, who has no duty to address the concern, the
elements of malice and publicity will be considered as present.
The accused wrote a complaint for robbery, and threat to his
life, to burn hi s property and t o accuse him of several concocted
c rimes. This is a p r i v i leged communication if th e complaint w a s
only communicated to proper investigating authorities (e.g., NBI).
However, the privileged character of th e l e tter i s l o st: (1) when
actual malice is proven; or (2) when several provincial and national
g overnment agencies which had no i nt erest, right or d ut y i n t h e
prosecution of said charges were furnished copies thereof. (Pastor v.
Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-48772, May 8, 1992)
A letter reporting corruption ofthe Mayor addressed to the
M unicipal Court, M u n i cipal C ouncil an d C h ief o f P o lice is n o t
privileged communication. None of the persons to whom the letter
was sent, was vested with the power of supervision over the mayor
or the authorityto investigate the charges made against the latter.
(Daez v. Court of AppeaLs, G.R. No. 47971, October 3I, 1990) A letter
involving corruption should have been addressed to the Office of the
Ombudsman or DILG.
An open letter involving a planned assassination of a person
addressed to the President and published in several newspapers of
g eneral circulation is not a privileged communication. Even if th e
interest sought to be protected belongs to the public ingeneral,
certainly, the general public does not have the power to remedy the
alleged dangers sought to be prevented by the accused in publishing
the open letter. His lack of selectivity is in dicative of malice and
is anathema to his claim of pr i v ileged communication. (Brillante

v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 118757 and 121571, October 19,
2004; Buatis v. PeopLe, G.R. No. 142509, March 24, 2006) A letter

in addition to the report of the administrative case, accused made

Even if the reported jubilation of Ganzon is true, the accused should
have stopped at reciting the facts only. By m a k ing r emarks and

P

for the rule that p l eadings in ju dicial proceedings are considered
privileged communication is not only because said pleadings have
become part ofpublic record open to the public to scrutinize, but
also due tothe undeniable fact that said pleadings are presumed
to contain allegations, which is legal in n at ure, and thus, it i s of
general public concern. (Cuenco v. Cuenco, No. L-29560, March 81,

proceeding although the issues have not as yet been joined. Hence,
publication of such complaint w i t h out r emark an d comment is a
privileged communication under Article 354. (Manuel v. Pano, No.

matter lost its character as a privileged communication when a story

journalist can publish a report that complaint for shooting pets was

submitted his report. Asked by news reporter, A stated that he has
found X had malversed public funds and that he has recommended
his prosecution, which is subject to evaluation by the Mayor. (1986
Bar Exam) X has the privilege to communicate this report to t h e
Mayor as directed. In submitting this report to the Mayor, X cannot
be held liable for libel because of the rule on qualified privileged
private communication. X has the privilege to report the same to a
media reporter. As long as the reporting is confined to his finding
with a statement that th e same is subject to the approval of th e
Mayor, X is not l i a ble for l i bel because of the r ule or p r i v i l eged

privilege to communicate this report to the public. If he will publish
this report in the newspaper without comment or remark, he is also
protected by rule on privileged communication of afair and true
report.
Fair Commentaries
Fair commentaries on matters of public interest are qualified
privileged communications, although they are not listed in Ar t i cle
354. These constitute a valid defense in an action for libel or slander.
The doctrine of fair comment means that w h il e i n g eneral every
defamatory and public imputation is deemed false, and every false
imputation is deemed malicious, nevertheless, when the defamatory
imputation is directed against a public person in his public capacity,
it is no t n e cessarily actionable. I n o r der t h a t s u c h d efamatory
imputation to a public official may be actionable, it mus-. either be a
falseallegation offact or a comment based on a false supposition. If

the comment is an expression of opinion, based on established facts,
then it is immaterial that the opinion happens to be mistaken, as
long as it might reasonably be inferred from the facts. (Borj al v. CA,

(1969 Bar Exam) The conduct, moral fitness, and ability of a
public official to discharge his duties are undoubtedly matters
o f public int erest. A n e wspaper, especially one national i n
reach and coverage, should be free to report on events and
developments in w h ich th e p u blic has a l egitimate interest
with minimum fear of being prosecuted in court by one group
or another on criminal or civil charges for libel, so long as the
newspaper respects and keeps within the standards of morality
and civility prevailing within the general community. (Manila
Bulletin Publishing Corporation v. Domingo, G.R. No. 170841,

July 5, 2017)
In defamation, where th e i m p utation is based upon a
matter of r i ght p u blic int erest, the presumption of criminal
intent does not arise from the mere publication of defamatory
matter. A m a t ter o f p u b lic i n t erest is a c ommon pr operty,
and hence, anybody may express his opinion on it. The public
conduct of every public man is a matter of public concern. A

public official must not be too thin-skinned with reference
to comments upon his official acts. (U.S. v. Bustos, G.R. No.

I-12592, March 8, 1918)

if the same does not pertain to his official function or is not
related to his work. In Br i l l a n te v. CA, G.R. Nos. 118757 and
121571, October 19,2004, Brillante implicated Mayor Jejomar
Binay and PUP President Prudente in a planned assassination
of Syjuco as well as election-related terrorism. The doctrine of
fair comment as a defense in libel is not applicable since the
utterances are unrelated to a public officer's performance of his
duties. Obviously, commission of murder and terrorism is not
related tothe performance of their duties as public offi
cers.
The rule is that defamatory remarks and comments on
the conduct or acts of public officers which are related to the
discharge of their official duties will not constitute libel if the
defendant proves the truth of the imputation. But any attack
upon the private character of the public officeron matters
which are not related to the discharge of their official functions
may constitute libel under Article 355. (Sazon v. Hon. Court of
Appeals, G.R. No. 12071 5;March 29, 1996)
A topicor story should not be considered a matter of public
interest by the mere fact that the person involved is a public
officer, unless it r elates to his functions. Assuming a public
office is not tantamount to completely abdicating one's right
to privacy. (Yeschengco v. Alfonso, G.R No. 194815, November

25, 2009)
Under Article 357 of the Revised Penal Code, a reporter,
editor or manager of a newspaper, daily or magazine, who shall
publish facts connected with th e p r i v ate life of another and
offensive to the honor, virtue and reputation of said person,
is liable for the crime of prohibited publication. This crime is
committed even if the offended party is a public officer.

it appears that X acted with actual malice when he imputed

statenient with r eckless disregard of whether it was false or
not. Xas a columnist failed to verify the story before publishing
it pursuant to the standard stated in the case of Tul fo v. People,

supra. X is liable for libel since the Article was libelous and
inconsistent with good faith and r easonable care. (2011 Bar

In his column, Direct Hit, A, a journalist, wrote about X
the head examiner of the BIR-RDO Manila as follows: "Itong si

ay napaka suwapang na buwaya. Ang nickname niya ay si Atty.

(2016 Bar Exam) The crime of libel is committed. Journalists
bear Le b u r den of writ ing responsibly when practicing their
profession, even when writing about public figures or matters
of public interest. The articles are wild accusations. He had
written a n d p u b l i shed t h e s u b ject a r t i cles with r e ckless

"mismanagement" of private complainant as a DTI officer are
matters of public interest as these relate to his moral conduct,
his capacity to lead the DTI em ployees, and to manage and
supervise the affairs. of the office. These statements undoubtedly
make it to the grade of qualified privileged communication and
thus, would require actual malice to be actionable. Failure of
the ieporter to counter-check the status of the complaints by

the Waray employees, which was already dismissed, cannot
be corsidered asenough reason to hold him liable. A reporter
may rely on i n formation given by a l one source although it
reflectsonly one side of the story provided the reporter does
not entertaina high degree ofawareness of its probable falsity.

Pu b l i c F i g u r e —The doctrine in Su l i v an v. New York
Times covers statements concerning public f igures regardless of
whether or not t hey are government officials. (Lopez v. The Hon.
Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-26549, July 81, 1970) A public figure
has been defined as a person who, by his accomplishments, fame,
or mode of living, or by adopting a profession or calling which gives
the public a legitimate interest in hi s doings, his affairs, and his
character, has become a "public personage." He is, in other words, a
celebrity. (Ayer Productions Pty. Ltd. v. Capulong, G.R. Nos. 82880
and 82898, April 29, 1988) Public figures include those, who thrust
themselves to th e f orefront of p a r t i cular p u blic controversies in
order to influence the resolution of the issues involved. In either
event, they invite attention and comment. (Yuchengco v. Alfonso,

2008, Cristy F er min i m p u ted t o A n n abelle Rama Gu ti errez, an

fugitives from the law and of being a wastrel. The doctrine of fair

with the works of Annabelle as an actress.

(2018 Bar E x am) Th e d efamatory p ublication is n ot c o vered by
privileged communication because Gigi was attacking the personal
life of Pablo as a husband and not his public life as a famous singer.
Other view: This is covered by privileged communication since the
column has something to do with circumstance that caused a famous
actor to lose lucrative endorsement.

such comment and criticism should be presumed to have been made

Lando and Marco are candidates in the local elections. In his
speeches Lar.do attacked his opponent Marco stating therein that he
had charged ~ando of estafa through falsification in the Ombudsman
so much so that since his (Lando's] integrity is doubtful he should

a fair comment on the moral fitness of Marco as candidate, which

Fair and True Report and Fair Commentary
The differences between fair and true report under Article 354
of Revised Penal Code, and fair comment under the Sulivan, v. New
York Times doctrine as privileged communications are as follows:
1.
I n f a i r a n d t r u e r eport, the accused makes a report on
o fficial proceedings, which are not confidential i n n a t ur e or t h e
function-related acts p erformed b y p u b li c of ficers w i t h o ut a n y
comments or remarks. (People v. Rico, 8 C.A. Rep. 225,'~

The Sedano doctrine on fair commentary on aspirant of public
position is subject to the New York Times doctrine. (Baguio Midland
Courier v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 107566, November 25, 2004) In
sum, the commentary on aspirant of elective or appointive position
i s a privileged communication even if th e same is un t r u t h fu l a s
long as accused does not know that the comment is false or has not
recklessly disregarded knowing whether it is false or not.

In fair commentaries, the accused is making a comment on the
function-related acts performed by public officers, public figures or
public aspirants.

A w a s n o m i n ated a s D e p a r t m en t S e cretary. W h i l e t h e
Commission on Appointments was considering the nomination, B
caused to be published in the newspapers a statement objecting to
A's appointment with allegation that A was a drug dependent, that
he had several mistresses, and that he was corrupt. As a result of the
publication, the nomination was not confirmed by the Commission
on Appointments. Since A is being considered for confirmation of his
appointment, his moral, mental, and physical fitness for the public
trust is a public concern. Hence, B is not liable for libel unless his
imputation of immorality, corruption, and drug dependency is false
and he recklessly disregarded knowing whether it i s f alse or not.

In f ai r c o m m entary, t h e d e f a m atory i m p u t a tion i n th e
commentary may' be false but the accused has no knowledge that
it is false and has not rccklessly disregarded to knew whether it
is false or not. Only false statements made with the high c.egree of
awareness of their probable falsity demanded by New York Times
may b t h e s u bject of either civil or c r i m i nal sanctions. (Flor v .

defendants, members of the municipal council, publish a resolution
stating that th e p l aintiff, wh o was seeking to be appointed to a
judicial position, is immoral and devoted himself the prosecution
of unjust suits. The libelous publication was inspired by express
malice. The defendants failed to establish the truth of these charges,
and they merely acted based on rumors and hearsay. They did not
exert genuine effort to verify them. They were held civilly liable for
damage.
In Vi l l a v icencio case, defendants r ecklessly dis regarded of
knowing whether the defamatory imputation is false or not.

2. In fair and true report,the report of the proceeding or

G o o d M o t i v e —Publishing defamatory imputation with
good motives and j ustifiable ends is a defense in defamation. Under
Article 354, defamatory imputation is not presumed to be malicious
if it is shown that there is good intention and justifiable motive for
making it. Truthfulness of the imputation is not required to cause
the acquittal of the accused in the crime of defamation.

good motive for publishing his mental condition, the defamatory
imputation, even though it is true, is presumed to be malicious.

In People v. Ch avez, 5 3 O .G. 8886, imputation m a de by a
n urse upon complainant t hat h e ha s contaminated his wife wi t h
venereal disease as a precautionary measure to prevent further
contamination, is in the nature of privileged communication. Since
it was made with good intention and justifiable motive, the nurse
i s not liable for l i bel. I n t h i s case, there is no showing that t h e
complainant is suffering from venereal disease.
In Eliseo Soriano v. People, G.R. No. 225010, November 21,
2018, the accused Soriano, through a religious radio program, "Ang

claimed that his motive was harken to other religious leaders not
to use the institution of r eligion in a m a n ner t hat w ould subject
religion to public distrust and disdain. Such motive does not make
his statements justified. Moreover, the defamatory statement does
not reveal such alleged motive.
2.
Go o d M o t i v e a nd T r u t h f u l n ess —
The defense of good
motive and justifiable in defamation will be further strengthened by
proof of truthfulness of the published defamatory imputation. Under
Article 361 of the Revised Penal Code, in every criminal prosecution
for libel, the truth may be given in evidence to the court and if it
appears thatthe matter charged as libelous is true, and, moreover,
that it was published with good motives and forjustifiable ends, the
defendants shall be acquitted.

805

However, t h er e a r e e x c eptions. P r oof o f t r u t h f u l ness of
imputation.of a crime or a function-related defamatory act against
a public officer is a defense even though he does not prove that the
imputation was pu b l ished with g o od m otives and f or j u s t ifiable
ends. (Vasquez v. CA, G.R No. 118971, September 15, 1999) Under
Article 361, proof of the truth of an imputation of an act or omission
constituting a r i m e , or imputation against government employees
with respect to facts related to the discharge of their official duties
shall be admitted; and in such cases if the defendant proves the
truth of the imputation made by him, he shall be acquitted.
In the crime of libel, truth is not an absolute defense. But such
truthfulness of the defamatory statement can be considered as a
defense in the following circumstances: (1) the publication of the
defamatory but t r u t h ful st atements was made with good motives
and for justifiable ends; or (2) the publication of defamatory but
truthful statements pertains to a cr ime or a f u n ction-related act
made by a public officer. (2009 Bar Exam)
a.
I m pu t a t i on of Crime —
Proof of the truthof an imputation
of an act or omission constituting a crime shall be admitted. In such
case if the defendant proves the truth of the imputation made by

him, he shall be acquitted. (Article 361) This is a defense regardless
of whether the person tc whom the crime was imputed is a public
officer or a private person. For example, A published in a newspaper
that B killed C. In a libel case, A will be allowed to present witnesses
and evidence that B in f act killed C I f t h e re is proof that B re ally
killed C, A v-il: be acquitted. Even if A. is an enemy of B, aiid thus,
the publicatiori was made out of hate, just the same A is not liable
for libel.

8.
T ru t h f u l n ess —
Without good motives and for justifiable
ends in publishing defamatory statements, proof of truthfulness of
the same is not a defense. (Alonzo v. CA, G.R. No. 110088, February
1, 1995) Under Article 361, proof of the tr uth of an i m putation of
an act or omission shall not generally be admitted. Under Arti cle
354, even if a defamatory imputation is true, it is presumed to be
malicious, if there is no showing of good intention and justifiable
motive for making it.

b. I m p u t a t i o n o f F u n c t i on-related Act — P roof of t h e

Whether the person defamed is a p r i v ate individual, public
figure, public aspirant or a public officer, malice as an element of
libel is presumed if the statement published is defamatory. Under
Article 854 of the Revised Penal Code, every defamatory imputation is
presumed to be malicious, even if it be true. The rule on presumption
on the existence of malice appliesregardless of the status of the
person defamed. Article 854 has not m ade a distinction between
defaming a private individual and defaming a public officer or public
figure. Hence, the court must not make a distinction.
However, the defense in libel where the person defamed is a
public officer or public figure is different from that where the one
defamed is a private individual.
Whether the person defamed is a p r i v ate individual, public
officer or public figure, the accused can avail the following defenses:
1 . P r o o f o f g o o d i n t e n t io n a n d j u s t i fi abl e m o t iv e f o r

If the person defamed is a public aspirant or public figure, the
accused can avail ofthe additional defense of fair commentaries,
which is a privilege communication.
Where tne offended party is a public official (or a public figure),
the defense of absence of actual malice in m a k ing a d efamatory
c omment is available even when th e st atement t u n s ou t t o b e
f alse unless the offender makes the defamatory statement w i t h
the knowledge that it is false or with reckless disregard of knowing
whether it was false or not. %'here the offended party is a private
individual, the prosecution need not prove the presence of malice.
The law explicitly presumes its existence (malice in law) from the
defamatory character ofthe assailed statement. For his defense,
t he accused must show t hat h e h a s a j u s t i fiable reason for t h e
defamatory statement even if it was in fact true. (Disini v. Secretary

In Philippine J'ournalists, Inc. v. Thoenen, G.R. No. 148372,
December 18,2005, a reporter published an articleregarding the acts
of a Swiss national in shooting pets in BF Homes and the complaint
against him by BF Homes residents for deportation through lawyer
Atty. Efren Angara. The report is based on the letter of a certain
Atty. Efren Angara. However, it was established by evidence that
the report is not true. Libel is not a protected speech. A newspaper or
broadcaster publishing defamatory falsehoods about an individual,
who is neither a public official nor a public figure, may not claim a

constitutional privilege against liability for injury infiicted, even if
the falsehood arose in a discussion of public interest.

In defensive libel, the means employed by the accused must be
reasonably necessary to restore his ruined reputation or honor and
not just to retaliate by ruining also the reputation of the aggressor.
Example: A, after alighting from a rig, went in front of the home of
B, C, and D, the three defendants, and in the heat of anger, shouted
at them the following words: "You pimp, women of ill repute, thieves,
paramours of my husband."To which B answered back, saying: 'You
are a woman of the street, you smell bad, and your money was stolen
from the PCAU."The other defendant C retorted: "You are shameless,
blackmailer, murderer." And the t h i rd d efendant D re p lied: 'You
have a thick face, you are not legally married, you are the paramour
of Father Baluyut." It was held: The defendants let loose a barrage
of insults upon A, imputing immorality, unchastity, dishonesty and
criminality which were not fair answers to A's lambaste and were
absolutely unrelated to her imputations upon them. Retaliation or
vindictiveness can hardly be a basis of self-defense. The answering
of libel may be justified, if it is adequate; and it is inadequate when
the answer is unnecessarily scurrilous. (People v. Rayo, C.A., 58 O.G.
8618; 2011 Bar Exam) However, A is also liable for oral defamation.

Defensive Libel
In order to justify homicide on the ground of self-defense, it is
essential that the attack upon the defendant be simultaneous with
the killing, or succeeded the latter without appreciable interval of
time. (U.S. v. Ferrer, G.R. No. 60, November 8, 1901) But in defense
of honor, a person libeled may hit back with another libel even if
there is an appreciable interval of time between the aggressive libel
and defensive libel. Once the aspersion is cast upon the good name
of a person, its sting clings and the one defamed may avail himself
of all necessary means to shake it off. He may hit back with another
libel, which, if adequate, will be justified. (People v. Chua Hiong,

fC.A.J 51 O.G. 1982)
X a Senator, filed a f ormal complaint against A, a C abinet
official, with the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee in connection with
A's alleged anomalous acquisitions of p u b li c w o rk s e q uipment,
which complaint was played up in the press. Two days after, a press
release was issued by A , p u b l i shed i n t h e m e t r opolitan dailies,
depicting X as a "consistent li ar," as having prostituted his high
public office for pecuniary gains, and as having committed certain
serious offenses in violation of R.A. No. 3019. Upon complaint of X,
A was charged with libel. (1974 Bar Exam) The defamatory charge
against A regarding an anomalous transaction being investigated
by the Senate is protected by the privileged communication. Hence,
it does neither constitute l i bel no r u n l a wful l i b elous aggression
for purposes of defensive libel. Hence, A cannot invoke justifying
circumstance of defense of honor for making defamatory statement
against X since the element of unlawful libelous aggression is not
present. A's imputations against X were neither made privately nor
officially; hence, they are not qualified privileged communication
under Article 354 of the Revised Penal Code. (Antonino v. Valencia,

G.R. No. L-26526, May 27, 1974)

In Chua Hi o ng supra, the private complainant caused to be
published in t h e M a n il a C h r onicle an a r t i cle entitled "Doubtful
Citizenship." In the said article, the private complainant made to
appear that accused in his petitionfor naturalization obtained a
decision on the basis of questionable pieces of evidence. Thereafter,
accused published a statement to the effect that private complainant
instigated investigations in different government agencies against
the accused because of his prosecution mania and in the spirit of
revenge and t ha t t h e p r i v ate complainant wa s th e m astermind
behind the threatening letter of B.S. sent to the accused. Accused
was acquitted because of the justifying circumstance of defense of
honor. Note: The libelous means employed by accused is reasonably
necessary to neutralizethe effect of the libelous article entitled
" Doubtful C i t i zenship." Th e s u bject st atement wa s i n t ended t o
counteract the impression left in the mind of the public by the article
"Doubtful Citizenship."
Venue for Written Defamation
Before Article 360 of Revised Penal Code was amended, the
rule was that a criminal action for libel may be instituted in any

jurisdiction where the libelous article was published or circulated,
irrespective of where i t

w a s w r i t ten or p r i n t ed. Experience had

J9JC9B0M

shown that under that old rule the offended party could harass the
accused in a libel case by laying the venue of the criminal action in
a remote or distant place. To forestall such harassment, R.A. No.
4368, which amended the Code, lays down specific rules as to the
venue of the criminal action so as to prevent harassment arising
from out-of-town libel suits. (People v. Macasaet, G.R No. 196094,
March 5, 2018)

printed and first published in Iloilo City. The Information failed to
allege the residence of complainant. While the Information alleges
that complainant is a physician in Iloilo City, such allegation did not
clearly and positively indicate that he was actually residing in Iloilo
City at the time of the commission of the offense. It is possible that
the complainant was actually residing in another place. (Foz, Jr. v.
People, supra)

Under Article 360 of th e R evised Penal Code, the criminal
action for "written defamation" may be filed in the province or city
where the libelous article is printed and first published. However,
t here is a second option. Criminal action may be instituted at th e
province or city where offended private individual actually resides
at the time of the commission of the offense; or at the province, city
or at Manila where offended public officer held office at the time of
the commission of the offense. In all cases, the criminal action shall
be filed in the Regional Trial Court.
If theoffended party is a public officer, the place ofhis residence
shall not be considered as a venue for libel. (1966 Bar Exam)
The words "written defamation" in Art i c le 360 is not confined
to libel committed by written means but it includes libel by radio or
other similar means. To interpret otherwise is to defeat the purpose
of the law, and that is, to prevent inconvenience or harassment to
the accused if the complainant can choose a place where he was
defamed as a venue for a libel case anywhere in the Philippines in
case the publication is made nationwide. (Bocobo v. Estanislao, G.R.
No. L-30458, August 81, 1978)
In order to obviate controversies as to the venue of the criminal
action for written defamation, the complaint or information should
contain allegations as t o w h e ther, a t t h e t i m e t h e o f fense was
c ommitted, the offended party w a s a p u b li c officer or a p r i v a t e
individual and where he was actually residing at that time. Whenever
possible, the place where the written defamation was printed and
first published should likewise be alleged. That allegation would be
a sine qua non if the circumstance as to where the libel was printed
and first published is used as the basis of the venue of the action.

T his is a c o m pliance wit h t h e r u l e r e q uir in g a l l egation i n t h e
information ofthe place where the alleged defamatory article was
p rinted and first published. The Information need not parrot th e
provisions of Article 860 of the RPC and expressly use the phrase
"printed and first published." If there is no dispute that the place
of publication indicated in the Information is the place where the
alleged defamatory article was "printed and first published," then
the law is substantially complied with. After all, the filing of the
Information before the Regional Trial C ourt w o uld f orestall any
inclination to h a r ass the accused. (People v. Macasaet, G.R. No.
196094, March 5, 201 8)
The place where libelous article was accessed by the offended
party in the Internet is not equivalent to the place where the libelous
article is printed and first published within th e contemplation of
the rule on venue under Article 860 of the Revised Penal Code. To
rule otherwise is to allow the evil sought to be prevented by th e
amendment to A r t i cl e 860, an d t h a t w a s t h e i n d iscriminate or
arbitrary laying of the venue in l ibel cases in distant, isolated or
far-flung areas, meant to accomplish nothing more than harass or
intimidate an accused. The disparity or unevenness of the situation
becomes even more acute where the offended party is a person of
sufficient means or possesses influence, and is motivated by spite or
the need for revenge. To equate the "first access to the defamatory
article on website" with "printing and first publication of the article"
would spawn the very ills that the amendment to Article 860 of the
Revised Penal Code sought to discourage and prevent. It h a r dly
requires much imagination to see the chaos that would ensue in
situations where the website's author or writer, a blogger or anyone
who posts messages therein could be sued for l ibel anywhere in

PRIVATE LIBEL
Under Ar t i cle 860 of t h e R evised Penal Code, no criminal
action for defamation which consists in the imputation of a crime
which cannot be prosecuted de officio shall be brought except at the
instance of and upon complaint expressly filed by the offended party.
The statement "no criminal a ction for defamation" indicates
that it applies to all kinds of defamation including oral defamation.
(Campita v. Aquilino, G.R. No. L-20228, November 28, 1964)
Under Article 844, the crimes, which cannot be pr o secuted
de officio, are adultery, concubinage, seduc'tion, abduction, or acts
o f lasciviousness. In sum, l i bel or o ra l d efamation involving t h e
imputation of private crime such as adultery is also a private crime,
which cannot be prosecuted de officio. On the other hand, libel or
oral defamation involving imputation of public crime such as rape,
theft or prostitution is also a public crime, which can be prosecuted

de officio. (1958 and 1969 Bar Exams)
A lthough t h e i mp u t a t io n o f p r o s t i t u t io n i n c l u de s t h e
imputation of adultery since the offended party is a married woman,
the criminal action may still be instit uted without her complaint
b ecause public i n t erest, w h ich i s a l w ay s p a r amount t o p r i v a t e
interest, so requires. Oral defamation involving the imputation of
prostitution is a public crime; hence, it can be prosecuted de officio.

ADMINISTRATIVE CIRCULAR NO. 08-2008
Re: Guidelines in the Observance of a Rule of Preference in the

The Supreme Court imposed fine with subsidiary imprisonment
for libel because: (1) accused wrote the libelous article merely to
defend his honor (Sazon v. Court of Appeals, 825 Phil. 1058,~; (2)
the crime was committed in th e h eat of anger (Ma ri v. Co urt o f
Appeals, supra); (8) the crime was committed in the heat of passion

818

2006)
On January 25, 2008, the Supreme Court issued Administrative
Circular No . 0 8-2008, entitled Gu i d elines in t h e O b servance of
a Rule of Preference in the Imposition of Penalties in Libel Cases,
which expresses a preference for the imposition of a fine rather than
imprisonment, given the circumstances attendant in Sa zon case,
Mari case, Brillante case and Buatis case in which only a fine was
imposed by this Court on those convicted of libel. It also states that,
if the penalty imposed is merely a fine but the convict is unable to
pay the same, the Revised Penal Code's provisions on subsidiary
imprisonment should apply. However, the Circular likewise allows
the court, in the exercise of sound discretion, the option to impose
imprisonment as penalty, whenever the imposition of a fine alone
would depreciate the seriousness of the offense, work violence on the
social order, or otherwise be contrary to the imperatives of justice.

(Fermin v. People, G.R. No. 157648, March 28, 2008)
In Punongbayan-Visitacion v. People, G.R. No. 194214, January
10, 2018, pursuant to th e policy in A .C. No. 08-08, the Supreme
Court finds that the imposition of a fine, instead of imprisonment,
is sufficient. It i s n oteworthy that accused is a first-time offender
with no other criminal record under her name. Further, the degree
of publication is not that wi despread considering that the libelous
letter was circulated only to a few individuals.

SLANDER BY DEED
Slander by deed is the performance of an act not punishable
as other crime against honor, which shall cast dishonor, discredit,
or contempt upon another person. (Article 859 of the Revised Penal

Code)
The elements are: (1) that the offender performs any act not
i ncluded in an y o t her c r im e against honor; (2) that s uch act i s
performed in the presence of other person or persons; and (8) that
such act casts dishonor, discredit or contempt upon the offended
party. (Valanueva v. People, G.R. No. 160851, April 10, 2006)

J9JC9B0M

CRIMINAL LAW REVIEWER

XIII. CRIMES AGAINST HONOR

Slander by deed is libelcommitted by actions rather than
words. The most common examples are slapping someone or spitting
on his/her face in front of the public market, in full view of a crowd,
thus casting dishonor, discredit, and contempt u pon th e p erson
of another; pointing a di rt y fi n g er, which ordinarily connotes the
phrase "Fuck You," to a lady-mayor in front of several persons in the
municipal building. (Villanueva v. People, supra)

If there is no showing that t h e m o t ive of th e defendant in
maltreating the teacher and the fact that th e act was committed
publicly, the crime committed is maltreatment and not slander by
deed. (People v. Mendoza, G.R. No. L-89275, December 20, 1988)
H owever, holding the h air o f a s chool teacher and shaking hi m
violently i n t h e p r e sence of school children an d o t her t eachers
constitute slander by deed and not m a l t reatment because of the
nature and effects of the maltreatment inflicted upon him and the
nature of his position. (People v. Velez, G.R. No. 42234, August 81,

Publicity

1984)

Slanderous Actions

Publicity is an element of slander by deed since it is a specie
of libel. Without p u blicity, th e cr ime committed is either u n j u st
vexation, maltreatment or slight physical injuries.
Serious or Simple Slander by Deed
If slander by deed is of serious nature, the penalty is higher.
Whether a certain slanderous act constitutes slander by deed of a
serious nature or not, depends on the social standing of the offended
party, the circumstances under which the act was committed, the
occasion, etc. (Villanueva v. People, supra )

815

If the maltreatment (such hitting her twice on the face with his
raincoat and violently pushing her to the window) is committed while
the teacher is engaged in the actual performance of professional
duty orby reason of past performance of professional duty, the crime
committed is direct assault qualified by the circumstance of laying
of hands. (Sarcepuedes v. People, G.R. No. L-8857, October 22, 1951)
Less Serious Injuries and Slander by Deed

I f two f elonies would otherwise have been covered by t h e
definition of a complex crime under Article 48, but the Code imposes
a single penalty for these crimes, it cannot be punished as a complex
crime ortwo separate crimes. Since there issingle penalty prescribed

shame her before other people (People v. Delfin, 112 Phil. 807), or

by law for these two crimes, it shall be treated as one. Thus, even

slapping a woman during a meeting of corporate officers without
provocation constitutes serious slander by deed. (Teodoro v. Court
of Appeals, G.R. No. 108174, July 11, 1996) Banging of a chair in
front of complainant and choking her i n t h e p r esence of several
persons is serious slander by deed. But in view of the fact that the
offense was done in the heat of anger and in reaction to a perceived
provocation, the Court opted to impose the penalty of fine instead
of imprisonment. (Mari v. Court of Appeals, G.R No. 127694, May
81, 2000) However,"poking of the dirty-finger," triggered by refusal
to sign the application for monetization, constitutes simple slander
by deed even though the offended party is a vice mayor and a lady.
(Villanueva v. People, supra)

where a single act results in less grave felonies of serious physical

P ushing an d

injuries and serious slander by deed, the same shall not be punished
as a complex crime under Ar t i cle 48 but as less serious physical

injuries with ignominy under the second paragraph of Article 265.
Slander by deed shall be considered as ignominy, which is an element

of qualified less serious physical injuries. (People v. Malinao, G.R.

child, or other members of his family.
Offer to prevent publication of libel is committed by offering to
prevent publication of libel concerning him or the parents, spouse,
child, or other members of his family for a compensation or money
consideration, (Article 86'5)
The crime of threatening to publish a libel is punished in the
United States by the law on blackmailing and extortion. Blackmail
may be defined asany unlawful extortion of money by an appeal to
the fears ofthe victim, especially extortion of money by threats of
accusation or exposure. (U.S. v. Eguia, G.R. No. L-18540, October

PROHIBITED PUBLICATION
Prohibited publication is committed by a r e porter, editor, or
manager of a newspaper, daily or magazine, who shall publish facts
connected with the private life of another and offensive to the honor,
virtue, and r e putation of s ai d p erson. Thi s cr ime i s c ommitted

INCRIMINATING AN INNOCENT PERSON
Incriminating a n

i n n ocent person i s committing an a ct n o t

Not Constituting Perjur y

not contemplate th e i dea of m a l i cious prosecution in t h e s ense
of someone prosecuting or instigating a criminal charge in court.
It refers to the acts of "planting evidence" and the like, which do
not in themselves constitute false prosecution but tend directly to
cause false prosecutions. (Campanano v. Datuin, G.R. No. 172142,
October 17, 2007) Filing of criminal complaint against the offended
party without justifiable cause or motive, causing the same to be
prosecuted, and testifying falsely as w i t ness for th e p r osecution
do not constitute incriminating an i n nocent person since the law
expressly excludes perjury as a means of committing incriminating
innocent person. (Ventura v. Bernabe, G.R. No. L-26760, April 80 ,

1971)
Planting Incrim i n atory Evidence
As a g eneral r u le, p l antin g o f e v i dence to i n criminate an
innocent person constitutes the crime of incriminating an innocent
person under Article 364 of the Revised Penal Code. However, if the
incriminatory evidence planted is dangerous drugs or unauthorized
explosives, loose firearm, the crime committed is planting of evidence
under Section 29 of R.A. No. 9165 for the dangerous drug, Section
4-A of P.D. No. 1866 as amended by R.A. No. 9516 for the explosive
arid Section 38of R.A. No. 10591 forloose firearm.
Planting of evidence is the willful act by any person of maliciously
and surreptitiously inserting, placing, adding or attaching directly
or indirectly, th r ough any overt o r c overt act, dangerous drugs,
explosive, or loose firearm or its ammunition in the person, house,
effects or in the immediate vicinity of an innocent individual for the
purpose of implicating, incriminating, or imputing the commission
of crime involving dangerous drugs, explosive, or loose firearm or

its ammunition. (Section 8 of R.A. No. 9165, Section 4-A of P.D. No.
1866, and Section 88 of R.A. ¹. 10 591)
Complex Crime
As a rule, illegally arresting a person, which is not based on
probable cause, by a public officer is arbitrary detention. However,
arbitrary detention can only be committed by a public officer in pursuit
of their duty to arrest. Hence, arbitrary detention is committed if

police officer arrested the victim without probable cause for purposes
of investigating him. (U.S. v. Hawchaiv, G.R. No. L-6909, February

20, 1912) or bringing him to the proper investigating authority (U.S.
v. Gellada, G.R. No. L-5151, January 31, 1910) If the police officer
arrested the victim without probable cause for purposes of planting
incriminatory evidence and to make a judicial delivery, the crime
committed is incriminating an i n nocent person through unlawful
arrest. (People v. Alagao, G.R No. L-20721, April 30, 1966) It is not
the duty ofthe police to arrest a person for purposes of planting
incriminatory evidence. He committed the crime of unlawful arrest
in his private capacity.

intriguing against honor, is a felony under the Revised Penal Code.

If u n l a w fu l a r r es t i s c o m m i t t e d t o p l a n t i n c r i m i n atory
evidence, the crime committed is complex crime of incriminating
innocent person through unlawful ar r est. (People v. Alagao, G.R.
No. L-20721, April 30, 1966) If i n c riminatory evidence is planted
to justify an unlawful arrest, the crime committed is complex crime
of unlawful arrest through incriminating an i nnocent person. But
if the incriminatory evidence are dangerous drugs, explosive or
loose firearm, unlawful arrest and planting of evidence are separate
crimes. Complex crime is not committed since planting of evidence,
which is punishable under special law, cannot be made a component
of acomplex crime.

Pe r s ons wh o c ommitted m a licious prosecution can b e
held liable for perjury, false testimony or offering false testimony. In
incriminating an innocent person, the act committed by the offender
to incriminate an innocent person must not constitute perjury.
3.
U n d e r Ar t i cle 326 of the former Penal Code, the gravamen
of the malicious prosecutior is the imputation itself when made before
an administrative or judicial officer, whereas in Article 363 of the
Revised Penal Code, the gravamen of incriminatory machinations
is performing an act which tends directly to such an imputation.
Article 326 o f t h e o l d P e nal C ode p u ni shes false prosecutions
whereas Article 364 of the Revised Penal Code punishes any act
which may tend directly to cause a false prosecution. (Ventura v.
Bernabe, supra.)
Note: For purposes of a civil case, it is irrelevant that there is
no sucl crime of malicious prosecution in the Revised Penal Code.
A civil action need not be based on the existence of such a crime.
Article 2219 of the Civil Code provides that moral damages may
be recovered in acase involv'ng malicious prosecution. (Ventura v.

(Ventura v. Bernabe, G.R. No. L-26760, April 30, 1971) Incriminatory
machination, which includes incriminating an innocent person and

Gossiping may constitute oral defamation or intriguing against
honor. If the gossiping directly imputes to the offended party a crime
or defamatory condition,the crime committed is oral defamation. If
the gossiping imputes to the offended party a crime or defamatory
condition without knowing the source thereof, the crime committed
is intriguing against honor. (1968 Bar Exam)

accused upon a married woman of having illicit relations with a man
not her husband which in effect constitutes the crime of adultery.
Since the crime alleged in the Information is written defamation, it
cannot beprosecuted de officio.

crime committed is i n t r i guing against honor wit h t h e q u alifying

This is not oral defamation since the offender is not directly imputing

Scheme or Plot
Using scheme or plot by means of trickery to create an intrigue,
which is designed to blemish the reputation of a person, is intriguing
against honor. Intriguing against honor is akin to slander by deed, in
that the offender does not avail directly of written or spoken words,
pictures or caricatures to ridicule his victim but of some ingenious,
crafty and secret plot,producing the same effect. (see: People v.
Fontanilla, C.A., 56 O.G. 1981) If the offender directly imputes to
the offended party by words a crime or defamatory condition, the

crime committed is defamation. (1968 Bar Exam)
Accused said to the companion of the offended party "Why are
you going uith her? Masamang tao iyan * and continued saying: 'All
her neighbors are her enemies. Maraming asunto siya, nagkahagulogulo at nagkakapatong-patong ang mga asunto niya."The crime
committed is oral defamation since the accused directly imputes to
the offended party crimes and bad attitudes. This is not intriguing
against honor because the accused did notresort to scheme or plot

by means of trickery designed to blemish the reputation of a person.
(People v. Fontanilla, C.A., 5'6 O.G. 1981)
If the offender spreads pictures ofthe offended party in the
company of a married man with a statement "ang sweet naman nila,

The phrase "Si Maximina Banguis, aking nakuha" im plying
that the offended party is not a virgin anymore because he had sexual
intercourse with her, constitutes intriguing against honor, and not
oral defamation. (People v. Bao, G.R. ¹. L - 1 2 1 02, September29,

to do a curet(tJage on her." The doctor is not lia ble for intr i g uing
against honor or oral defamation. His statements are clearly not
libelous per s e. Complainant, Dr. A n g eles had admitted that h e
committed a mistake in the management of the case of Mrs. Cruz.
The remarks made by Dr. Francisco were but a harmless expression
of his opinion on what should have been done in t r eating her, if
he were the doctor managing her. Hi s st atements were nothing
more than a comment that complainant committed a mistake in the
diagnosis and management of the patient.

Simple Negligence Resulting in Alarm and Scandal

XIV. CRIMINAL NEGLIGENCE
Imprudence is an act by r e ckless imprudence, which, had it
been intentional, would constitute a grave felony, less grave felony,
or a light felony.
Negligence is an act by simple imprudence or negligence which
would otherwise constitute a grave felony or a less serious felony or
causing wrong by simple imprudence or negligence which, if done
maliciously, would have constituted a light felony. (Article 865)
R eckless i m p r udence consists i n v o l u n t a ry , b u t wi t h o u t
malice, doing or falling to do an act from which material damage
results by reason ofinexcusable lack of precaution on the part of
t he person performing or failing to perform such act, taking in t o
consideration his employment or occupation, degree of intelligence,
physical condition and other circumstances regarding persons, time,

and place.
Simple imprudence consists in the lack of precaution displayed

in those cases in which the damage impending to be caused is not
immediate nor the danger clearly manifests. (1969 Bar Exam)
Failure to lend on the spot to the injured parties such help, as
may be in his hands to give, is a qualifying circumstance.
Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Arson
One night when there was a Meralco brownout, A wanted to
pour gasoline from a container into the gas tank of his car. He got a
candle, lighted it and asked B to hold it but while A was pouring the
gasoline, the gas ignited and the flames immediately enveloped the
ground floor of A's house. The tenants occupying the premises suffered
firstdegree burns and their properties destroyed as a consequence
of the fire. A's mother-in-law, who was then on the upper floor of the
house upon seeing the flames, jumped to the ground and sustained
cranial fracture. The child of A was also caught by the flames and

a sudden, thc. chair was bumped by a ch ild being chased by his
playmates, causing the pistol to fall on the ground and fired. This
created considerate slock and fear among the persons present
thereat, especially the children, who scampered for safety. (1977
Bar Exam) Leaving a loaded firearm on a chair wit h in t he r each
of a child then playing in the place constitutes reckless negligence.

shock and fear among the persons present thereat, G i" l i able for

Discharging Firearm
Firing a gun at a person to scare him constitutes discharge of
firearm. If the bullet hit a wall and bounced back and nit another
person killing him as a consequence, he is responsible far homicide
because of Article 4 of the Revised Penal Code. Since a single act
produces two crimes, I e is liable for complex crime of homicide and
discharge offi
rearm.
Firing a gun in a public place causing people to scamper away
constitutes a arm and scandal. If, as a consequence o: alarm and
scandal, a person was hit by th e bu llet and diec., the offender is
liable for homicide because of Article 4 of the Revised Penal Code.
During a concert of Gary V., and in order to prever t the crowd
from rushing to the stage, Rafael Padilla, a securi-.y guard, pointed
his gun at thc onrush of people. When the crowd still pushed forward,
Rafael fired. However. the bullet hit one of the metal roof supports,
ricocheted and then hi t on e of th e stage crew memb rs, causing
injuries which resulted in the latter's confinement in a hospital for
12 days. (2007 Bar Exam) Pointing a gun and firing it at the unruly
audience is beyond the performance of the duty of a security guard.
Common sense dictates that firing a gun at the audience will cause
them to scamper away and death may result as a coraequence. A
security guard is ought to know that firing at the audience is not a
solution to prevent them from being unruly. The act of the security
guard in this case constitutes at least alarm and scandal. Hence, he

is also liable for the less serious physical injuries because of Article 4

accused, who fired the gun, is not liable for homicide. Article 4 is not
applicable since he is not committing a felony. However, he is liable
for reckless imprudence resulting in homicide if he failed to take
precautions demanded by the circumstances such as the district

824

of the Revised Penal Code.
In People v. Abarca, G.R. No. L-74488, September 14, 1987, the

accused was absolved from criminal liability for killing the paramour
of his wife. It wa s held that accused did not commit a f elony for
the death of the paramour since "it is the proximate result of th e
outrage overwhelming the accused after chancing upon his spouse
in the act of infidelity." However, he was not exempted from criminal
liability w it h r e gard t o th e i n j ur y su stained by t h ir d p ersons. It
was held that: This does not mean, however, that th e accused is
totally free from any responsibility. Granting the fact that he was
not performing an illegal act when he fired shots at the victim, he
cannot be said to be entirely without fault. While it appears that

before firing at the deceased, he uttered warning words ("anwaray
labot kagawas,') that are not enough precaution to absolve him for
the injuries sustained by the victim's negligence that was found on
his part under Article 865.
In People v. Galacgac, C.A. 54 O.G. 1027, the accused has the
lawful right to defend himself against unlawful aggression. However,
he did not aim at his assailant but instead indiscriminately fired his
deadly weapon at the risk of the life and limbs of innocent persons.
His act of indiscriminately firing his gun without due care in a thickly
populated area of Metro Manila constitutes the crime of discharge
of firearm. Hence, he is liable for injury sustained by the victims
as a direct, natural and logical consequence of unlawful discharge
of firearm. Note: In Abarca case, the accused discriminately aimed
and fired the gun at the paramour of his wife.
For firing a warning shot without the least intention of causing
injury to anyone by the policeman in the performance of duty does
n ot constitute alarm an d scandal or d i scharge of firearm. I f t h e
bullet hit a bystander, who died as a consequence, he is not liable for
homicide since he is not committing a felony in firing his gun. Article
4 is not applicable. However, the policeman is liable for reckless
imprudence resulting to homicide if he failed to take the necessary
precaution demanded by the circumstances as to time and place in
firing a warning shot. (People v. Cusi, CA., 68 O.G. 2777)
Firing a gun in the air and at the ground to stop two persons from
having a fistfight is not constitutive of alarm and scandal since there
is no evil intent to cause alarm. If the bullet, when it hit the ground,
ricocheted and hit another person, who died as a consequence, the

was populated, and the likelihood that his bullet would glance over

the hard pavement of the Manila thoroughfare. (People v. Nocum,
' G.R. 1Vo. L-482, February 25, 1947)
Murder
In the course of funeral procession, a young mourner, who was
h had
a
marching, mcmentarily stopped down to tie her shoelaces whic
become untied. The driver of the hearse, who was driving at five
miles an hour, was then looking at the stores by the roadside and
did not see her. He continued to drive on and ran over the girl. When
th e peopI e aro
ar ou n d s h outed and gestured, he backed up and ran over
e
the girl a second time, killing her. (1988 and 2001 Bar Exams)
normal reaction of any person who had accidentally ran over another
would be to immediately alight from the vehicle and render aid to
the victim. (People v. Castillo, Jr., G.R. No. 121768, July 21, 1997)
Backing up and running over the victim for the second time shows
deliberate intent to kill the victim. Hence, he should be charged with
murder.
No Reckless Imprudence Resulting in Frustrated Homicide
Accused cannot be charged with reckless imprudence resulting
in frustra-.ed homicide. (1973 and 1989 Bar E xams) In People v.
Castillo, 42 O.G. 1914, it was held that t h e re can be no reckless

the crime of frustrated homicide cannot exist. (Yapyuco,
120744-46, June 25, 2012) However, if the victim died, he can be
charged v-ith reckless imprudence resulting in homicide.
Doctor
Quack doctor or a person practicing medicine without license is
presumed to be reckless in treating a sick person, (People v. Carmen,
G.R. 1Vo. 137268, March 26, 2001) On the other hand, a licensed
physician is presumed. that he takes the necessary precaution and
e mploys the best of hi s k n owledge and skill i n a t t ending to h i s
clients. (Cruz v. CA, G.R. No. 122445, November 18, 1997) Doctors
are not guarantors of care. They do not even warrant a good result.

They are not insurers against mishaps or unusual consequences.
Furthermore, they are not liable for honest mistake of judgment.

accused was re:klessly imprudent in the exercise of her duties as a
surgeor. Accused was acquitted.

826

However, a doctor could be held liable for culpable felony if
there is a cause-and-effect link between his recklessness in treating
his patient and the injury or death of latter. The Hippocratic Oath
mandates physicians to give primordial consideration to the health
a nd welfare of th eir p a t ients. If a d o ctor fails t o l iv e u p t o t h i s
precept, he is made accountable for his acts. A mi stake, through
gross negligence or incompetence or plain human error, may spell
the difference between life and death. In this sense, the doctor plays
God on his patient's fate. (Ramosv. CA and Delos Santos, G.R. No.
124854, December 29, 1999)
Since death or i n j u r ies i nvolved in m a l p ractice actions are
determinable only in the li ght of scientific knowledge, it has been
recognized that expert testimony is usually necessary to support
t he conclusion as t o c a u se-and-effect r elationship b etween t h e
malpractice committed by th e a t t ending doctor and th e death of
or injury sustained by, his patient. (Cruz v. CA, G.R. ¹. 122 4 4 5,
November 18, 1997) To make a doctor liable for reckless imprudence
r esulting in homicide, it must be shown that he did not t r eat hi s
patient in accordance with the standard of care and skill commonly
p ossessed and e x ercised b y s i m i l a r s p e cialists u n de r s i m i l a r
circumstances. Failure to pr esent specialist as w i t ness to testify
on this standard is fatal to the prosecution of the case. (Solidum v.
People, G.R. No. 192128, March 10, 2014)
In Cr uz v . C A, G . R. N o. 1 2 2445, November 18, 1 997, the
lower court b ewails th e f o l lowing cir cumstances: inadequacy of
the facilities and u n t i diness of the clinic; the lack of pr ovisions;
the failure to conduct pre-operation tests on the patient; and th e
s ubsequent transfer of L y dia t o th e San Pablo Hospital and t h e
reoperation performed on her b y t h e a ccused. Expert t estimony
should have been offered to p r ove t ha t t h e c i r cumstances cited
by the courts below are constitutive of conduct falling below the
standard of care employed by other physicians in good standing
when performing th e s ame operation. A p h y sician i s p r esumed
that he takes the necessary precaution and employs the best of his
knowledge and skill in attending to his clients. This presumption is

rebuttable by expert opinion which is so sadly lacking in the case at
bench. Moreover, above-stated circumstances do not indicate that

In Ja r c ia v. Pe ople, G.R. N o. 1 8 7926. February 1 5, 2 0 12,
Roy, Jr., who was hit by a t axicab, was rushed to the hospital for
emerg ncy medical treatment. The X-ray of h;s ankle result showed
no fracture as read by Dr . J arcia, a ju nior r esident. Tne mother
of victim asked for X-ray of the leg of her son. Dr. Bastan, after
conducting her own examination of the victin , informed the mother
that since it was only the ankle that was hit, th ere was no need
to examine the upper leg.Eleven (11l days later, victim developed
fever, sweiling of the right leg and misalignment of the right foot. It
was later found through X-ray that the victim suffered fractures in
the shaft of the bone. Held: The Court is not convinced with moral
' yt th at t h e r esident doctors are guilty of reckless imprudence
cert air
or simple negligence. The elements thereof were not prove
yt e
prose "ution beyond reasonable doubt. The testimony of a specialist in
pediatric orthopedic, although pointing to some medical procedures
that could have been done by the two accused„as physicians on duty,
was riot clear as to whether the injuries suffered by patient Roy, Jr.
were indeed aggravated by the accused's judgment call and their
diagr osis or appreciation of the condition of tne victim at the time
they assessed him.
To be held liable for reckless impudence resulting in homici e,
t he accused must be an a ctive pl ayer i n t h e c ommission of t h e
reckless act, which is the proximate cause of the death of the victim.
(Nacino v. Ojh'ce of the Ombudsman, G.R, No. 284789-91, October
16, 2019) The doctor, who referred the case of a patient to another
doctor, cannot be considered as an active player in t h e r eckless
treatment of the patient, which is the proximate cause of his death.

In a criminal case involving a motor vehicle accident, the tria

Under the emergency rule, one who suddenly finds himself in

Marnasapano case
In Nacino v. Office of the Ombudsman, G.R. No. 234789-91,
October 16, 2019, President Aquino and SAF Director Napenas were
charged for reckless imprudence resulting in multi p le homicides in

and ordering the increase in the number of troops and coordination
with th e A F P . H o w ever, th ese acts barely qualify A q u ino as an
active player in the entire scheme of the operations, more so point to
any criminal negligence on his part.
Without doubt, Napenas had been negligent in the exaction of
the operation to arrest two terror sts. Lack of prior coordination with
the AFP was the most fatal m i st ake made by N apenas. Napenas
explained that past law enforcement operations against high-value

targets failed because of apparent leak in i nformation. On the
belief that t h e A F P w a s c ompromised, he recommended a t i m eon-target coordination w it h i t . M o r eover, th ere are other factors

our police force. It is not fair to make Napenas criminally responsible
for all factors that contributed to the death of the 44 SAF members
including those, which could not have foreseen during the planning
and execution of Oplan Exodus. There is no perfect law enforcement
operation. There is no guarantee of police officers' safety even in
developed countries possessed of sophisticated crime-fighting
technology.
