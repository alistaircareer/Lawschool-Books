PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
A. Basic Principles
Concept of “evidence"; truth as purpose

The term “evidence” is defined in Sec. 1 of Rule 128
*of the1.Rules
of Court, thus:
"SECTION 1. Evidence defined. — Evidence is the
means, sanctioned by these Rules, of ascertaining in
a judicial proceeding the truth respecting a matter of

fact.”
2. The very tenor of the definition clearly indicates that
not every fact having a conceivable connection to the issue of
a case, or that which provides a reasonable inference as to the
truth or falsity of a matter alleged, is considered evidence.
To be considered (evidence) the same must be “sanctioned” or
allowed by the Rules of Court. It is not evidence, if it is excluded
by law or by the Rules, even if it proves the existence or non¬
existence of a fact in issue. Thus,[hearsay evidence) a coerced
extrajudicial confession of the accused, and evidence obtained
in violation of constitutional rights, even if ultimately shown
to correspond to the truth, do not fall within the definition of
Sec. 1 of Rule 128.

3. The definition, provided for under Sec. 1 of Rule 128,
significantly considers “evidence” not as an end in itself but
merely as a “means” of ascertaining the truth of a matter of
fact. Equally significant is the observation that “evidence,”
as defined in the Rules of Court, is a means of ascertaining
i

rriv

EVIDENCE

CHAPTER I

(The Bar Lectures Series)

CONSIDERATIONS
— PRELIMINARY
A- Basic

3

Principles

the truth, not in all types of proceedings, but specifically, in a
“judicial proceeding.”
4. The purpose of evidence under the Rules of Court is
to ascertain the truth respecting a matter of fact in a judicial
proceeding (Sec. 1, Rule 128, Rules of Court; Atienza v. Board
of Medicine, 642 SCRA 523, 531, February 9, 2011). Evidence
is required because of the presumption that the court is not
aware of the veracity of the facts involved in a case. It is,
therefore, incumbent upon the parties to prove a fact in issue
through the presentation of admissible evidence.

c

One must prove a fact. Hence, a mere charge or allegation
of wrongdoing does not suffice. Accusation is not synonymous
with guilt. There must always be sufficient evidence to support
a charge (Buenviaje v. Magdamo, A.C. No. 11616, August 23,

Scope and applicability of the rules on evidence
1. The rules on evidence in the Rules of Court are
guided by the principle of uniformity. As a general policy, the
rules on evidence shallbe the same in all courts and in all
trials and hearings (Sec. 2, Rule 128, Rules of Court).
2. The rules on evidence, being components of the
Rules of Court, apply only to judicial proceedings (Sec. 1,
ibid.). In relation to this, Sec. 4 of Rule 1 provides for the
non-applicability of the Rules of Court, including necessarily
the rules.on .evidence, to certain specified proceedings. The
provision declares:-

—-—

“SEC. 4. In what cases not applicable. — These
Rules shall not apply to election cases, land registration.
cadastral, naturalization and insolvency proceedings,
and other cases not herein provided for.
by
analogy or In a suppletory character and whenever
practicable and convenient.”

2017).
5. While the purpose of evidence is to know the truth,
the yuth)referred to in the definition is not necessarily the
actuaTtruth but one aptly referred to as the fudiciaTor legaF
truthj The limitations of human judicial systems cannot always
guarantee knowledge of the actual or real truth. Actual truth
may not always be achieved in judicial proceedings because
the findings of the court would depend on the admissible
evidence presented before it.

Under Sec. 34 of Rule 132, courts, as a rule, are not
even authorized to consider evidence which has not been
formally offered. Thus, a supposed piece of evidence that
would undoubtedly show the innocence of the accused will
not be considered in the decision of the court if not formally
offered in evidence. If it is evidence to the contrary that has
been formally offered, it is the latter which the court is bound
to consider or appreciate. For instance, while it may be the
actual truth that it was Mr. X who shot Mr. Y, if the available
evidence presented and admitted in court points to Mr. Z as
the culprit, then the judicial or legal truth is that it was Mr.
Z, not Mr. X, who shot Mr. Y.

।

3. Technical rules of evidence, such as the hearsay
rule, are not to be rigidly applied in the course of preliminary
investigation prnnppdings Since a preliminary investigation
does not finally adjudicate- the rights and obligations of the
parties, probable cause can be established with hearsay
evidence, as long as there is /substantial basis]for crediting
the hearsay (Estrada v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. Nos. 212761-62,
duly 31, 2018).

__

4.

The general rule is that administrative agencies are

(not) bound by the technical rules on evidence. It can accept

documents which cannot be admitted in a judicial proceeding
where the Rules of Court are strictly observed. It can choose
to give weight or disregard such evidence, depending on
its trustworthiness (Sugar Regulatory Administration v.
Tormon, G.R. No. 195640, December 4, 2012). Hence, the
rules on evidence are not strictly applied in proceedings
before administrative bodies such as the Board of Medicine

2011). A disciplinary case against a government officer, like
a judge, is an administrative proceeding. Hence, technical
rules of evidence are not strictly applied and administrative
due process cannot be fully equated with due process in the
strict judicial sense (Anonymous Complaint v. Dagala, A.M.
No. MTJ-16-1886, July 25, 2017).

The Court has consistently held that technical rules
applicable to judicial proceedings are not strictly adhered to in
administrative proceedings. Thus, a party to an administrative
case cannot tenaciously insist on the application of discovery
procedures embodied in the Rules of Court. Such procedures
are 6ot)mandatory in administrative cases (Sibayan v. Alda,
G.RNo. 23395, January 17, 2018).
5_ Technical rules of evidence are not binding on labor
tribunals (Manalo-v. TNS Philippines, Inc., G.R. No. 208567,

November 26,-2014). Thus, the argument that the written
statements of certain employees are hearsay because such
employees were not presented for cross-examination is not
persuasive. The rules on evidence are not strictly observed in
proceedings before the National Labor Relations Commission
(NLRC) which are summary in nature and decisions may be
made on the basis of position papers'(Caslillo v. Prudentialife
Plans, Inc., G.R. No. 196142, March 26, 2014).
6. The Civil Service Commission, for example, conducts
its investigations for the purpose of ascertaining the truth
without necessarily adhering to technical rules of procedure^
applicable in judicial proceedings. It was, therefore, sustained
by the-Supreme- Court when it validly appreciated certain
documents in resolving the formal charge against respondent
in spite of the fact that they were not duly authenticated but
its contents were not disputed by respondent and whose only
objection was that they were not duly authenticated (Civil
Service Commission v. Colanggo, 553 SCRA 640).

_

7. Earlier, in Ong Chia v. Republic, 328 SCRA 749, the
Court emphasized that the rule onlbrmal offer of evidence is
not applicable to a case involving a petition for naturalization.

Here, the Regional Trial Court rendered judgment in
favor of the petitioner’s application for naturalization. On
appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the Regional Trial
Court and denied the application for naturalization on the
basis of documents not earlier formally offered in the trial
court, raised for the first time on appeal and merely attached
to the appellant’s brief for the State. Petitioner contends that,
under Sec. 34, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court, only evidence
that has been formally offered shall be considered by the
court. Brushing aside petitioner’s contention, the Supreme
Court held that the rule on formal offer of evidence is not
applicable to a~case involving a petition for naturalization
unless applied by analogy or in a suppletory character and
whenever practicable and convenient.
8. One case, Sasan, Sr. v. NLRC, 569 SCRA 670,
further illustrates the rule on the non-applicability of the
Rules of Court, including the rules on evidence, to non-judicial

proceedings.

In this case, the respondent, in support of its material
allegations, submitted before the NLRC several documents,
which it did not present before the Labor Arbiter. Largely
on the basis of those documents presented for the first time
on appeal, the NLRC promulgated its decision modifying the
ruling of the Labor Arbiter.
Distressed by the decision, the petitioners sought recourse
with the Court of Appeals by filing a petition for certiorari
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. In its decision, the Court
of Appeals affirmed the findings of the NLRC holding that it
did not commit a grave abuse of discretion.
In the Supreme Court, the petitioners raised, as one of the
issues, the acceptance and consideration by the NLRC of the
evidence presented before it for the first time on appeal. The
Supreme Court ruled that the issue is not a novel procedural
issue, and that Philippine jurisprudence is replete with cases

in labor cases, the NLRC is not precluded
evidence for the first time on appeal.
9. In Sasan, the petitioners, likewise, interposed a
protest against the documentary evidence submitted by the
adverse party because they were mere photocopies.
The Court, in dismissing the objection, stressed once
again that, even assuming that the adverse party submitted
mere photocopies, the proceedings before the NLRC are not
covered by the technical rules on evidence and procedure as
observed in the regular courts. Technical rules on evidence-do
not apply if the decision to grant the petition proceeds from an
examination of its~sufficiency as well asTcTrefi.il look into the
arguments contained in position papers and other documents.
10. The rule that the provisions of the Rules of Court
do not apply to administrative or quasi-judicial proceedings
likewise found expression in the much earlier case of Bantolino
v. Coca Cola Bottlers, Inc., 403 SCRA 699.

Here, the Court reiterated previous rulings that the rules
on evidence are not strictly observed in proceedings before
administrative bodies. The Court disregarded the findings
of the Court of Appeals which, among others, considered
the affidavits of the petitioners as mere hearsay, and, thus,
could not be admitted in evidence against their employers.
The Court unequivocally ruled that in a labor case, it is not
necessary for an affiant to appear and testify, and be crossexamined by counsel for the adverse party on his affidavit.
Administrative bodies are not bound by the technical niceties

law.

11. Similarly, it was declared that the parol evidence
rule, like other rules on evidence, should not be strictly
applied in labor cases. Hence, a labor arbiter is not precluded
from accepting amLevaluating evidence other than, and even
contrary to, what is stated in the CBA (Cirtek Employees
Labor Union-Federation of Free Workers v. Cirtek Electronics,
Inc., 650 SCRA 656, 662-663, June 6, 2011; See also Abosta

When evidence is required; when not required
1. --The basic rule is thatinere allegatio^is<6ot^vidence
and is (not) equivalent to proof? For example, a cnarge based
on mere suspicion and speculation cannot be given credence
(Agdeppa v. Office of the Ombudsman, G.R. No. 146376, April
23, 2014).

Evidence is the means of proving a fact. As the definition
says, it is offered in court to ascertain the truth “respecting a
matter of fact!' Implied from the definition of “evidence” in Sec.
1 of Rule 128 is the need for the introduction of evidence when
the court has to resolve a question of fact. Where no factual
issue exists in a case, there is no need to present evidence
because |where the case presents a question of law, such
question is resolved by the mere application of the relevant
statutes of this jurisdiction to which no evidence is required?]

—

2. In certain instances, evidence is no longer required
-to prove
an assertion, as in the following:
(a) When the pleadings in a civil case do not tender
an issue of fact, a trial need not be conducted since there
is no more reason to present evidence. The case is then
ripe for judicial determination, through a judgment on
the pleadings, pursuant to Rule 34 of the Rules of Court.

(b) Presentation of evidence may, likewise, be
dispensed with by agreement of the parties. The parties
to any action are allowed by the Rules to agree in writing
upon the facts involved in the litigation and to submit the
case for judgment upon the facts agreed upon, without
the introduction of evidence (Sec. 6, Rule 30, Rules of
Court).
(c) Evidence is not required on matters of judicial
notice (Sec. 1, Rule 129, Rules of Court) and on matters
judicially admitted (Sec. 4, ibid.).

8

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

(d) Evidence is not required when the law presumes
the truth of a fact.
When, for instance, an injured passenger sues a
common carrier for breach of contract of carriage, evidence
of the negligence of the defendant carrier is dispensed
with. ThisTsbecause Art'. 1756 of the Civil Code of the
Philippines establishes the presumption that, “In case
of death“bf~br injuries to passengers, common carriers
are presumed to have been at fault or to have acted
negligently x x x.” The same presumption applies under
Art. 1735 of the same Code when the goods on board a
common carrier are lost, destroyed, or deteriorated.

The constitutional presumption of innocence is a
fitting example. The accused has no duty to prove his
innocence because the law presumes that an accused in
a criminal prosecution is innocent until the contrary is
proven. This basic constitutional principle is fleshed out
by procedural rules which place upon the prosecution the
burden of proving that an accused is guilty of the offense
charged by proof beyond reasonable doubt. Whether the
degree of proof has been met is largely left for the trial
courts to determine (See People v. Baraoil, 676 SCRA 24,
31, July 9, 2012). It is on the basis of this constitutional
presumption that case law maintains that the conviction
of the accused must rest, not on the weakness of the
defense, but on the strength of the prosecution (People v.
Ferrer, G.R. No. 213914, June 6, 2018).
(e) Evidence is, likewise, dispensed with when a
rule presumes the truth of a fact. Under Rule 131 of the
Rules of Court, two kinds of presumptions, conclusive
and disputable, have been established.

Thus, the tenant is not permitted to deny the title
of his landlord at the time of the commencement of the
relation of landlord and tenant between them. This
presumption is conclusive against the tenant (Sec.
2[b], Rule 131, Rules of Court). On the other hand, it is

disputably presumed that official duty has been regularly
performed (Sec. 3[m], Rule 131, ibid.).
(f) Evidence is not required when a fact is judicially
admitted by the adverse party. An admission made by
party in the course of the proceedings in the same case,
does not require proof (Sec. 4, Rule 129, ibid.).
Application of the Rules on Electronic Evidence

1. The application of the rules on evidence in the
Rules of Court contrasts with the application of the Rules on
Electronic Evidence. While the definition of “evidence” under
the Rules of Court makes reference only to judicial proceedings,
the provisions of the Rules on Electronic Evidence apply as
well to quasi-judicial and administrative cases. Section 2,
Rule 1 of the Rules on Electronic Evidence provides:
“SEC. 2. Cases covered. — These Rules shall apply
to all civil actions and proceedings, as well as quasijudicial and administrative cases."

2. It was previously held that the provisions of the
Rules on Electronic Evidence do not apply to criminal actions.
They apply only to civil actions, quasi-judicial proceedings,
and administrative proceedings (Ang v. Court of Appeals, G.R
No. 182835, April 20, 2010).

Note: See, however, People v. Enojas, G.R. No. 204894,
March 10, 2014, which applied the Rules on Electronic
Evidence to criminal cases. Here, the RTC admitted text
messages against the accused in conformity with the Court’s
earlier resolution (A.M. No. 01-7-01 SC, September 24, 2002)
expanding the coverage of said rules to criminal cases as well.
No reference to this resolution, amending the coverage of the
Rules on Electronic Evidence, was mentioned in the earlier
case of Ang v. Court of Appeals.
3. Ephemeral communications are now admissible
evidence, subject to certain conditions. Ephemeral electronic
communication refers to telephone conversations, text

messages, chatroom sessions, streaming audio, streaming
video, and other forms of communication the evidence of which
is not recorded or retained (Bartolome v. Maranan, A.M. No.
P-11-2979, November 18, 2014).
Some distinctions between evidence In civil cases and
evidence in criminal cases

Section 2 of Rule 128 declares that the rules on evidence
shall be the same in all trials and hearings, except as otherwise
provided by law or these rules. To declare such is not to say,
however, that there are absolutely no distinctions between
a civil and a criminal proceeding. Indeed, there are certain
evidentiary differences between these proceedings.
(a) In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof
must prove his claim by a preponderance of evidence (Sec. 1,
Bule 133, Rules of Court). In criminal cases, the guilt of the
accused has to be proven beyond reasonable doubt (Sec. 2,

ibid.).
(b) In civil cases, an offer of compromise is not an
admission of any liability, and is not admissible in evidence
against the offeror. In criminal cases, except those involving
quasi-offenses (criminal negligence) or those allowed by law to
be compromised, an offer of compromise by the accused may
be received in evidence as an implied admission of guilt (Sec.
28, Rule 130, Rules of Court).
(c) In civil cases, the concept of presumption of innocence
does not apply and, generally, there is no presumption for or
against a party except in certain cases provided for by law.
Example: A common carrier is presumed to have been at fault
or negligent in case a passenger is injured in the course of
his transportation by the carrier (Art. 1756, Civil Code of
the Philippines). In criminal cases, the accused enjoys the
constitutional presumption of innocence (Sec. 14, Art. Ill,
1987 Constitution).
(d) The concept of "confession” does not apply to civil
cases which use the more appropriate term, “admission.” A

CONSIDERATIONS

Basic Principles

confession is a declaration of an accused acknowledging his
guilt of the offense charged (Sec. 34, Rule 130, Rules of Court).
(e) In civil cases, evidence of the moral character (good
or bad) of a party is admissible as long as it is pertinent to the
issue of character involved in the case (Sec. 54fb], ibid.). In
criminal cases, the prosecution is not allowed to prove the bad
moral character of the accused even if it is pertinent to the
moral trait involved. It can only do so in rebuttal (Sec. 54[a]
[2], Rule 130, ibid.).
(f) The privileged communication rule on patient¬
physician relationship has reference only to a civil case, not to
a criminal case (Sec. 24(c), ibid.).
(g) The rule on admission by a conspirator applies only
to a criminal case, not to a civil case (Sec. 31, Rule 130, ibid.).
(h) The rule on extrajudicial confession applies to the
accused in a criminal case, not to the defendant in a civil case
(Sec. 3, Rule 133, ibid.).

Distinction between proof and evidence
1. “Proof is not the evidence itself. There is proof only
because of evidence. It is merely the probative effect of evidence
and is the conviction or persuasion of the mind resulting from
a consideration of the evidence (29 Am. Jur. 2d, Evidence, §2).

2. Proof is the effect or result of evidence, while evidence
is the medium of proof (Jones on Evidence, Volume I, Fourth
Ed., §4, p. 5).
Factum probandum and factum probans
1.

Evidence signifies a relationship between two facts,

namely:
(a) the fact or proposition to be established (factum
probandum); and
(b) the facts or material evidencing the fact or
proposition to be established (factum probans) (Wigmore,
Principles of Judicial Proof, 5).

12

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

2. Stated another way, the factum probandum is the
fact to be proved; it is the fact which is in issue in a case and
to which the evidence is directed. On the other hand, factum
probans is the probative or evidentiary fact tending to prove
the fact in issue (Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., p. 533).
Thus, if P claims to have been injured by the negligence
of D, who specifically denies having been negligent, the
negligence of D that caused the injuries of P constitutes the
factum probandum of the suit. The evidence offered by P,
whether it be object, documentary or testimonial, constitutes
the materials to prove the liability of D. The totality of the
evidence to prove the liability refers to the factum probans.
3. The factum probandum in a certain case may be
affected by the judicial admissions of a party. For instance,
if the defendant in a suit based on a culpa aquiliana theory
admits his negligence in his answer to the complaint, there is
no more need to prove negligence. Hence, negligence ceases to
be a factum probandum in the case.
If the factum probandum “signifies the fact or proposition
to be established,” then matters of judicial notice, conclusive
presumptions and judicial admissions cannot qualify as parts
of the factum probandum of a particular case because such
matters need not be established or proven.
4. In practical terms, the factum probandum in a civil
case refers to the elements of a cause of action alleged in the
complaint to be proven by the plaintiff where such elements
are denied specifically by the defendant. If the defendant
makes no specific denials of the material averments of a
claim, such averments are deemed admitted. Hence, there is
no factum probandum to speak of.

For instance, in a suit for collection of a sum of money,
in the absence of any admission by the defendant, the factum
probandum of the plaintiff would be:
(i) the existence of the debt of the defendant;
(ii) the maturity of the debt;

CHAPTER I

CONSIDERATIONS
— PRELIMINARY
A Basic Principles

13

(iii) the demand made by the plaintiff upon the
defendant to pay; and
(iv) the failure to pay despite the demand.

If the fact of non-payment is the only matter disputed
in the answer, then it is only the issue of payment or non¬
payment which constitutes the factum probandum in the
case, other allegations having been admitted.

It must be clarified, at this juncture, that the mere filing
of the complaint does not ipso facto give rise to a factum
probandum. When the defendant files his answer and makes
no specific denial of the averments of the complaint, no factum
probandum arises because of the admissions. Where, let us
say, the defendant specifically denies a material allegation in
the complaint, the material matter denied becomes the factum
probandum, the fact to be established.
The same rule applies to a criminal case. The mere filing
of an information does not automatically give rise to a factum
probandum. It only arises when the accused enters a plea of
not guilty.
5. In a criminal case, when the accused pleads not
guilty, the factum probandum refers to the matter that the
prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt in order to
justify a conviction, i.e., the corpus delicti.
Corpus delicti

1. When the accused enters a plea of not guilty, the
State has to prove the corpus delicti of the offense.
Jurisprudence holds that corpus delicti is the body or
substance of the crime. In its primary sense, it refers to the
fact that a crime was committed. As applied to a particular
offense, the term means the actual commission by someone
of the particular crime charged (People v. Calates, G.R. No.
214759, April 4, 2018; People u. Nepomuceno, G.R. No. 216062,
September 19, 2018).

14

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

2. The corpus delicti is a compound fact made up of two
elements, namely: (a) the existence of a certain act or result
forming the basis of the criminal charge, and (b) the existence
of a criminal agency as the cause of the act or result (People
o. Nepomuceno, G.R. No. 216062, September 19, 2018). This
means that before a person can be convicted of a crime, a
crime must be proven to have occurred. For instance, before
a person can be held liable for homicide, it must be shown
that: (a) someone was killed; and that (b) the accused was
responsible for the killing. Before someone can be convicted of
arson of a dwelling, it must be proven that (a) a dwelling was
burned and that (b) it was the accused who is responsible for
the burning.

3. The body of the crime does not necessarily refer to
theactual object or fruit of the crime. It is the fact that a crime
has been committed by a particular perpetrator. In murder or
homicide, for example, corpus delicti does not necessarily refer
to the dead body of the victim. This is a rule long recognized
by jurisprudence.

In its legal sense, it does not refer to the ransom money in
the crime of kidnapping for ransom or to the body of the person
murdered or, to the stolen items in theft. “Since the corpus
delicti is the fact of the commission of the crime, the Court has
ruled that even a single witness’ uncorroborated testimony, if
credible, may suffice to prove the corpus delicti and warrant a
conviction for the offense charged. Corpus delicti may even be
established by circumstantial evidence” (Zapanta v. People,
GJi. No. 170863, March 20, 2013).
In one early case, one point raised by the defense was
the existence of corpus delicti. He argued that there was no
conclusive evidence of the death of the deceased, because
his body was never found. Even the place where the alleged
deceased had been buried was never identified. All these facts,
according to the defense, indicated that the corpus delicti was
not established.
To such argument, the Court did not agree. Accordingly,
in a case of murder of homicide, it is not necessary to recover

CHAPTER I -PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
A. Basic Principles

16

the body or to show where it can be found. There are cases
like death at sea, explained the Court, where the finding or
recovery of the body is impossible. It is enough that the death
and the criminal agency causing it be proven. There are even
cases where said death and the intervention of the criminal
agency that caused it may be presumed or established by
circumstantial evidence. Quoting Wharton in his book on
Criminal Evidence, Vol. 2, Sec. 871, pp. 1505-1506, the Court

held:

..

the rule now established by the weight of
authority is that the element of death in the corpus delicti
may be established by circumstantial evidence. Hence,
in the case of the destruction of the body, or in the case
of its disappearance, as in murder upon the high seas,
where the body is rarely, if ever, found, death may be
proved circumstantially. To establish the corpus delicti
by circumstantial evidence, facts are admissible, to
show the impossibility of rescue, as at sea; to show the
existence and extent of wounds, and deceased’s condition
of health; and to show that the wound was sufficient to
cause death, and that the party was reported dead. Death
is sufficiently shown by the testimony of a witness that he
saw the flash and heard the report, and that the deceased
fell to the ground, declaring he was shot, and that accused
did the shooting” (People u. Sasota, G.R. No. L-3544, April
18, 1952).

In People v. Ansang, 93 Phil. 44, the accused, while riding
on a vinta, ignited homemade bombs and threw them at the
victims in another boat. While the parts of the boat were later
found, the passengers were never seen again. Holding that
the corpus delicti was shown by the facts and that the victims
died, the Court convicted the accused of multiple murder.
It also needs to be emphasized that corpus delicti need
not be proved by an autopsy report of the dead victim’s body
or even by the testimony of the physician who examined
such body. While such report or testimony is useful for
understanding the nature of the injuries the victim suffered,
they are not indispensable proof of such injuries or of the fact

EVIDENCE

16

of death. Even the presentation of the murder weapons is not
indispensable since the physical existence of such weapons is
not an element of the crime of murder (People v. Tuniaco, G.R.

No. 185710, January 19, 2010).
4. In theft, corpus delicti has two elements, namely: (1)
that the property was lost by the owner, and (2) that it was
lost by felonious taking (Zabala v. People, G.R. No. 210760,
January 16, 2015). To be caught in possession of the stolen
property is not an element of corpus delicti in theft (Gan v.
People, G.R. No. 165884, April 23, 2007).
5. The corpus delicti in the crime of illegal possession
of firearms is the accused's lack of license or permit to possess
or carry the firearm, as possession itself is not prohibited by
law. To establish the corpus delicti, the prosecution has the
burden of proving that the firearm exists and that the accused
who owned or possessed it does not have the corresponding
license or permit to possess or carry the same (See Peralta v.
People, G.R. No. 221991, August 30, 2017).
Even if the firearm or explosive is presented in court, the
failure of the prosecution to prove the absence of a permit to
own or possess the firearm or explosive is fatal to its cause.
The essence of the crime penalized is primarily the lack of
license or permit to carry or possess the firearm, ammunition
or explosive since possession, by itself, is not prohibited by
law (People v. Reyes, G.R. No. 194606, February 18, 2015).
The contention that the corpus delicti was not established
for the reason that the firearm used was not presented as
evidence is not persuasive. The existence of the firearm can
be established by testimony, even without its presentation
(People v. Gaborne, G.R. No. 210710, July 27, 2016).

6. In a prosecution for illegal sale of prohibited or
dangerous drugs, what determines if there was a sale of
dangerous drugs is the proof of the concurrence of all the
elements of the offense. Conviction is proper if the following

elements concur;
(a) the identity of the buyer and seller, the object,
and the consideration; and

CHAPTER I

CONSIDERATIONS
— PRELIMINARY
A Baric Principle*

17

(b) the delivery of the thing sold and the payment

therefor (See People v. Sagana, G.R No. 208471, August
2, 201 7; People v. Ceralde, G.R. No. 228894, August 7,
2017; People v. Alvaro, G.R. No. 225596, January 10,
2018; People v. Seguiente, G.R. No. 218253, June 20,
2018; People u. Jimenez, G.R. No. 230721, October 15,
2018). Note that the failure to record the marked money
in the police blotter does not affect the integrity of the
evidence in drug cases. Neither law nor jurisprudence
requires that the buy-bust money be entered in the police
blotter. The recording is not essential since it is not an
element in the illegal sale of dangerous drugs (People
v. Mendoza, G.R. No. 220759, July 24, 2017; People v.
Seneres, G.R. No. 231008, November 5, 2018; See also
People v. Malaria, G.R. No. 233747, December 5, 2018).
When the accused is charged with illegal possession of
dangerous drugs, the prosecution must establish the following
elements to warrant his conviction:
(a) the accused was in possession of an item or
object identified as a prohibited drug;
(b) the possession was not authorized by law; and

(c) the accused freely and consciously possessed the
said drug (See also People v. Sagana, G.R No. 208471,
August 2, 2017; People v. Ceralde, G.R No. 228894, August
7, 2017; People v. Alvaro, G.R. No. 225596, January 10,
2018; People v. Torio, G.R No. 225780, December 3, 2018).

Aside from proving the elements of illegal sale or
possession of prohibited drugs, the drugs confiscated must be
presented as evidence in court (People v. Saunar, G.R. No.
207396, August 9, 2017; People v. Pundugar, G.R. No. 214779,
February 7, 2018). This is because the drug itself constitutes
the very corpus delicti of the offense (See also People v. De
Guzman, G.R. No. 219955, February 5, 2018; See also People
v. Reyes, G.R. No. 2199953, April 23, 2018; People v. Sagana,
G.R. No. 208471, August 2, 2017; People v. Cornel, G.R. No.
229047, April 16, 2018). Consequently, the State does not

comply with the indispensable requirement of proving the

are doubts about the authenticity of the evidence presented in

court (People u. Nepomuceno, G.R. No. 216062, September 19,
2018).

It has been repeatedly ruled that, “In every prosecution
of drug related cases, the presentation of the drug itself
constitutes the corpus delicti of the offense and its existence
is indispensable to a judgment of conviction. It behooves upon
the prosecution to establish beyond reasonable doubt the
identity of the narcotic substance” (People v. Pundugar, G.R.
No. 214779, February 7, 2018; See also People v. Suarez, G.R.
No. 223141, June 6, 2018). Towards this end, the obligation of
the prosecution is to ensure that the illegal drugs offered in
court are the very same items seized from the accused. This
would entail the presentation of the evidence on how the seized
drugs were handled and preserved from the moment they
were confiscated from the accused until their presentation in
court. Non-compliance with this requirement creates doubt
regarding the origin of the dangerous drug (People v. Saunar,
G.R. No. 207396, August 9, 2017; For additional readings, see
also People v. Suarez, G.R. No. 223141, June 6, 2018).

In drug cases, the corpus delicti is established by proof
that the identity and integrity of the prohibited or regulated
drug seized or confiscated from the accused has been preserved.
In short, it must be established by unwavering exactitude that
the dangerous drug presented in court as evidence is the same
as that seized from the accused (See People u. Asjali, G.R. No.
216430, September 3, 2018). Since the dangerous drug itself is
the very corpus delicti of the violation of the law prohibiting
the illegal sale or possession of dangerous drugs, the State does
not comply with the indispensable requirement of proving the
corpus delicti when the drug is missing, or when substantial
gaps occur in the chain of custody of the seized drugs (People
v. Calates, G.R. No. 214769, April 4, 2018).

7. The corpus delicti in the crime of kidnapping for
ransom is the fact that an individual has been, in any manner,

deprived of his liberty for the purpose of extorting ransom
from the victim or any other person (People v. Gonzalez, Jr.,
G.R. No. 192233, February 17, 2016).

Liberal construction of the rules on evidence
1. Like all other provisions under the Rules of Court,
the rules on evidence must be liberally construed (Sec. 6,
Rule 1, Rules of Court). Rules of procedure are mere tools
intended to facilitate rather than frustrate the attainment of
justice. A strict and rigid application of the rules must always
be eschewed if it would subvert their primary objective of
enhancing substantial justice.
Although strict compliance with the rules of procedure is
desired, liberal interpretation is warranted in cases where a
strict compliance of the rules will not serve the ends of justice
(Rubio v. Alabata, G.R. No. 203947, February 26, 2014).
However, the rule on liberal construction is not a license
to disregard the evidence, or lack thereof on record; or to
misapply the laws (Inter Orient Maritime Enterprises, Inc. v.
Creer III, G.R. No. 181921, September 17, 2014).
2. The Rules on Electronic Evidence shall, likewise,
be construed liberally (Sec. 2, Rule 2, Rules on Electronic
Evidence).
Absence of a vested right in the rules on evidence

There is no vested right in the rules on evidence (Ayala
de Roxas v. Case, 8 Phil. 197) because said rules are subject
to change by the Supreme Court pursuant to its powers to
promulgate rules concerning pleading, practice and procedure
(Sec. 5(5], Art. VIII, 1987 Constitution). The change in the
rules on evidence is, however, subject to the constitutional
limitation on the enactment of ex post facto laws (Sec. 22, Art.
Ill, ibid.). An ex post facto law includes that which alters the
rules on evidence and receives less or different testimony than
that required at the time of the commission of the offense in
order to convict the accused (Mekin v. Wolfe, 2 Phil. 74).

CHAPTER I -PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
B. Admissibility of Evidence

(The Bar Lectures Series)

Waiver of the rules on evidence
1, The rules on evidence may be waived. When an
otherwise objectionable evidenceis not objected to, the evidence
becomes admissible because of waiver. The evidence may be
validly considered by the court in arriving at its judgment
(Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Mendoza, G.R. No. 198799,
March 20, 2017). For instance, a court is not precluded to
accept in evidence a mere photocopy of a document when no
objection was raised when it was formally offered (Tapayan u.
Martinez, G.R. No. 207786, January 30, 2017).

For instance, while, as a rule, hearsay evidence is
excluded and carries no probative value, the rule admits of an
exception. Where a party fails to object to hearsay evidence,
then the same becomes admissible (SCC Chemicals Corp. v.
Court of Appeals, 353 SCRA 70). While such evidence may
be admissible, the court will most probably not consider the
same as credible.
2. May the parties stipulate waiving the rules on
evidence?
The Civil Code of the Philippines (Art. 6) provides that,
“rights may be waived, unless the waiver is contrary to
law, public order, public policy, morals, or good customs or
prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law.”
As long as no law or principles of morality, good customs, and
public policy are transgressed or no rights of third persons are
violated, the rules on evidence may be waived by the parties.
B. Admissibility of Evidence
Requisites for the admissibility of evidence

1.

Section 3 of Rule 128, as amended, provides:

—

“SEC. 3. Admissibility of evidence. Evidence is
admissible when it is relevant to the Issue and Is not
excluded by Hie Constitution, the law or these Rules.”

21

Thus, for evidence to be admissible, two elements must
concur, namely:
(a) the evidence is relevant; and
(b) the evidence is not excluded by the Constitution,
the law or the Rules of Court (competent). (See also Tan v.
Hosana, G.R. No. 190846, February 3, 2016; Tabuada u.
Tabuada, G.R. No. 196510, September 12, 2018).
These two elements correspond to Wigmore’s two axioms

of admissibility, namely: (a) that none but facts having
rational probative value are admissible; and (b) that all facts
having rational probative value are admissible unless some
specific rule forbids them (I Wigmore, §§9-10, 289-295). The
first axiom is, in substance, the axiom of relevance while the
second is the axiom of competence.
2. No evidence is admissible unless it is relevant.
However, relevancy alone does not make the evidence
admissible. An item of evidence may be relevant but not
admissible. It is not admissible because, although relevant,
it may be incompetent, i.e., it is excluded by law or by a
particular rule or by both.

Neither is evidence admissible merely because it is
competent. Although evidence is competent, it may still be
inadmissible if it is not relevant. The formula for admissibility
is a simple one. To be admissible, the evidence must be both
relevant and competent.
Illustrations of the requisites for admissibility
1. In a prosecution for homicide, the witness swears
that the accused killed the victim because his ever truthful
boyhood friend told him so. The testimony, although relevant,
is not admissible because the witness was not testifying based
on his personal knowledge of the event. The testimony is
hearsay and this type of evidence is, as a rule, excluded by
the rules (See Sec. 22, Rule 130, Rules of Court). In short, the
testimony offered is relevant but incompetent.

22

EVIDENCE

CHAPTER I - PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
B. Admiwibility of Evidence

(The Bar Lectures Series)

2. In a prosecution for homicide, the wife of the accused
testified that the husband admitted to her in confidence that it
was he who killed their neighbor. If the testimony is offered as
evidence against the husband and is objected to by the latter,
the testimonial evidence will be inadmissible by virtue of a
particular provision of the Rules of Court which excludes it as
a specie of evidence notwithstanding its obvious relevance to
the issue of guilt (See Sec. 24[a], ibid.). Here, the testimony is
also relevant but incompetent.
3. In a civil case for collection of a sum of money,
the testimony of an eyewitness to the transaction between
the creditor and the debtor is competent evidence because
the witness would be testifying on the basis of his personal
knowledge.

However, if the subject of the testimony includes the
alleged frequent bouts of dizziness of the debtor, that portion
of the testimony is made inadmissible by the fact that the
matters testified to are irrelevant to the issue of whether or not
a debt exists. In this case, the testimony becomes irrelevant.
4. If a defense witness testifies having actually seen
the alleged victim fire a gun first at the accused without
the latter’s provocation, the testimony of the eyewitness is
competent and the matters testified to are relevant to the plea
of self-defense. The testimony is, thus, admissible. It is not
only relevant but competent as well.

5. Upon a timely objection, oral evidence will be
excluded to prove a contract of a sale of a parcel of land which
does not conform to the statute of frauds (Art. 1403[2], Civil
Code of the Philippines). Even if the evidence is relevant to
the issue of existence or non-existence of the contract, it is
inadmissible because it isexcluded by law; hence, incompetent.

6. Documents obtained in violation of constitutional
guarantees, although containing relevant matters, are
inadmissible because they are illegally obtained, as
when evidence is illegally seized (Sec. 3(2], Art. Ill, 1987
Constitution). An extrajudicial confession, made during

23

custodial investigation, is inadmissible when made in violation
of a person’s Miranda rights, i.e., he was not informed of his
right to counsel, right to remain silent and other applicable
rights (People v. Bio, G.R. No. 195850, February 16, 2015).
Relevant evidence (Bar 1981)
1. Under Sec. 4 of Rule 128, evidence, to be relevant
must have such a relation to the fact in issue as to induce
belief in its existence or non-existence. The concept of
relevance is clearly one of logic. It deals with the rational
relationship between the evidence and the fact to be proved.
In other words, the evidence adduced should be directed to the
matters in dispute and any evidence which has neither direct
nor indirect relationship to such matters must be set aside as

irrelevant.
2. The matter of relevance under the Rules of Court
requires the existence of a fact in issue. Necessarily, this
fact in issue must be a disputed fact. Since relevant evidence
necessarily relates to a disputed fact, it is obvious that
evidence offered to prove an undisputed fact is irrelevant and,
as such, inadmissible. Where there is no issue as to a matter
of fact, there exists no purpose for an item of evidence.

3. It is the relation to the fact in issue which makes
evidence either relevant or irrelevant. If the evidence induces
belief as to the existence or non-existence of the fact in issue,
the evidence is relevant. If it does not induce such belief, it is

irrelevant.
4. Although competency of the evidence is a necessary
component of admissible evidence, the question that most
often arises in court is the relevance of the evidence. When an
advocate offers a piece of evidence for the court’s consideration,
he offers the evidence to prove a fact. This fact may either be
the immediate fact in issue or the ultimate fact in issue.

Take the case of the standard car accident as example.
Counsel for the plaintiff presents the testimony of another
car driver to testify to the following: that the defendant was

24

B. Admissibility of Evidence

25

driving at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour in a 60-kilometer

limit zone at the time plaintiff was sideswiped and injured
by the defendant. The witness claims he knows whereof he
speaks because he saw everything that transpired. Whether
or not such testimony meets the test of relevance will depend
upon what counsel wants to prove by the testimony. Initially,
of course, counsel would want to prove that, at the time of
the accident, the defendant was driving way beyond the speed
limit. This is the immediate fact sought to be established. Since
there is a traceable connection between the substance of the
testimony and the fact to be proved, the testimony is relevant.
On the other hand, if the testimony is offered to prove that the
defendant is a thief, the testimony has no logical connection
at all to the fact sought to be proved. Certainly, there is
no connection between driving at a very fast pace and the
defendant’s being a thief. The testimony is, hence, irrelevant.

not of law. The test is, therefore, one of logic, common sense,
and experience.
2. The existence of the relationship between the fact
in issue and the offered evidence is one that is perceived
only by the mind without reference to a statute or rule. It is,
therefore, a matter of reasoning. It is a matter of reasoning
because relevance is a matter of logic. The matter of relevance
is one that is addressed to the discretion of the court. The case
of People v. Galleno, 291 SCRA 761, is enlightening:
“There is no precise and universal test of relevancy
provided by law. However, the determination of whether
particular evidence is relevant rests largely at the
discretion of the court, which must be exercised according
to the teachings of logic and everyday experience.”

Relevance further requires that the immediate fact
proved must have a connection to the ultimate issue. In
the car accident case just illustrated, assume that counsel
has established through the witness that the defendant
was driving way beyond the speed limit at the time of the
accident. Establishing such a fact is not, however, sufficient.
This fact must be shown to be related to the ultimate issue in
the case. Now, the usual ultimate issue in every automobile
accident case is whether or not the damage caused to the
plaintiff arose out of the defendant’s negligent operation of
his car. The question that should necessarily be asked is: Is
the immediate fact proved, i.e., defendant’s driving beyond the
speed limit, related to the issue of negligence? If it is, then the
fact proved is relevant evidence. If it is not related to the issue
of negligence, it is irrelevant.

Collateral matters

Test for determining the relevancy of evidence

3. Jurisprudence considers motive as generally
immaterial, not being an element of the offense. However,
motive becomes important when the evidence on the
commission of the crime and the identity of the perpetrator are
purely circumstantial (People v. Manabat, G.R. No. 233199,
November 5, 2018).

1. Because of the definition of relevant evidence under
Sec. 4 of Rule 128, it is obvious that relevance is a matter of
relationship between the evidence and the fact in issue. The
determination of relevance is, thus, a matter of inference and

1. A matter is collateral when it is on a “parallel or
diverging line,” merely “additional” or “auxiliary” (Black’s Law
Dictionary, 5th Ed., p. 237). This term connotes an absence of
a direct connection between the evidence and the matter in
dispute.

2. For instance, the motive of a person and, in some
instances, his reputation are matters that may be considered
collateral to the subject of a controversy. A very strong motive
to kill the victim does not ipso facto make motive relevant
to the issue of guilt or innocence because the person with
absolutely no motive to kill could be the culprit. Evidence of
the bad reputation of the accused for being troublesome and
aggressive does not make the evidence admissible to prove his
guilt. After all, the culprit could have been the person with the
most endearing reputation.

CHAPTER I -PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS

B. Admissibility of Evidence

When collateral matters are allowed

1. As a rule, evidence on a collateral matter is not
allowed (Sec. 4, Rule 128, Rules of Court) because it does

not have direct relevance to the issue of the case. This rule,
however, is not an absolute rule. There exists an occasion
when evidence on a collateral matter may be allowed.

2. Under the Rules of Court, a collateral matter may be
admitted if it tends in any reasonable degree to establish the
probability or improbability of the fact in issue (Ibid.). In other
words, while the collateral evidence may not bear directly on
the issue, it will be admitted if it has the tendency to induce
belief as to the probability or improbability of the issues of
the case as when it would have the effect of corroborating or
supplementing facts previously established by direct evidence.

Illustration:
Although evidence of character is generally
inadmissible (Sec. 54, Rule 130, Rules of Court), the
accused may prove his good moral character which
is pertinent to the moral trait involved in the offense
charged (Sec. 54[a][l], ibid.).

In civil cases, evidence of the moral character of
party
is admissible when pertinent to the issue of
a
character involved in the case (Sec. 54[b], Rule 130,
ibid.). Also, evidence of the good character of a witness is
admissible if hischaracter has been previously impeached
(Sec. 54[c], ibid.).
Relevance of evidence on the credibility of a witness;
determination of credibility
1. Evidence on the credibility of a witness, or the lack
it,
of is always relevant. In every proceeding, the credibility
of the witness is always an issue because it has the inherent
tendency to prove or disprove the truthfulness of his assertion
and, consequently, the probative value of the proffered

evidence.

Every type of evidence sought to be admitted, whether it
be an object or document, requires the testimony of a witness
who shall identify, testify, and affirm or deny the authenticity
of the evidence. Thus, when the credibility of the sponsoring
witness is found wanting, Sec. 11 of Rule 132 authorizes his
impeachment by contradictory evidence, by evidence that,
in the past, he has made statements inconsistent with his
present testimony, or by evidence that his general reputation
for truth, honesty or integrity is bad.
2. In the assessment of the testimonies of witnesses, the
Court is guided by the rule that for evidence to be believed, it
must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness, but
must also be credible in itself such as the common experience
of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances.
There is no test of the truth of human testimony except its
conformity to our knowledge, observation, and experience.
Whatever is repugnant to these belongs to the miraculous,
and is outside of judicial cognizance (People v. Calumpang,
454 SCRA 719; Ubales v. People, 570 SCRA 251; See also
People v. Fieldad, G.R. No. 196005, October 1, 2014; See also
People v. Ungriano, G.R. No. 222337, July 23, 2018).
3. The importance of the credibility of a witness in a
judicial proceeding is highlighted by rules which allow the
adverse party to test such credibility through a process called
“cross-examination.” Hence, under Sec. 6 of Rule 132, as
amended, a witness may be cross-examined by the adverse
party not only on matters taken up in the direct examination,
but also on any relevant matter. It includes questions designed
to grant the cross-examiner sufficient fullness and freedom to
test the accuracy and truthfulness of the witness, his freedom
from interest or bias, or the reverse. It, likewise, covers
inquiries into matters that elicit all important facts bearing
upon the issue.

Since Sec. 6 of Rule 132 affirms the legitimacy of inquiries
into the credibility and biases of a witness, any objection to a
question that intends to demonstrate the lack or absence of
credibility of the witness on the ground that it is irrelevant or
merely collateral does not deserve to be sustained.

28

EVIDENCE

CHAPTER I

— PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS

29

B. Admissibility of Evidence

4. There are, however, instances provided in the rules
where the questions of the cross-examiner are circumscribed
by the matters taken up in the direct examination. Thus,
questions outside the subject matter of the direct examination
are not allowed.

(a) An accused may testify as a witness on his
own behalf “but subject to cross-examination on matters
covered by direct examination” (Sec. l[d], Rule 115, Rules
of Court).
(b) A hostile witness may be impeached and
cross-examined by the adverse party, but such crossexamination "must only be on the subject matter of his
examinaiion-in-chief" (Sec. 13, Rule 132, Rules of Court).

5. Existing jurisprudence has consistently held that
the determination of the credibility of a witness is best left
to the trial court, which had the opportunity to observe
the deportment of the witness while testifying (People if.
De Chavez, G.R. No. 218427, January 31, 2018; People
v. Manzano, Jr., G.R. No. 217974, March 5, 2018; See also
People v. Ungriano, G.R. No. 222337, July 23, 2018). The
trial court’s observations and conclusions on the credibility
of witnesses and their testimonies deserve great respect
and are accorded finality, unless the records show facts or
circumstances of material weight and substance that the
lower court overlooked, misunderstood or misappreciated,
and which, if properly considered, would alter the result of
the case (People v. Lagabala, G.R. No. 221427, July 30, 2018;
People v. Dillalan, Sr., G.R. No. 212191, September 5, 2018;
See also People v. CCC, G.R. No. 231925, November 19, 2018).
Competent evidence (Bar 2004)

1. Competent evidence is one that is not excluded by
law or rules in a particular case (Moran, Comments on the
Rules of Court, Volume 5, 1980, citing Porter v. Valentine,
18 Mise. Rep. 213, 41 N.Y.S. 507; Hart v. Newland, 10 N.C.
122; Ryan v. Town of Brisol, 63 Conn., 26, 27, Atl. 309). “The
admissibility of the evidence depends on its relevance and

competence x x x” (Tating v. Marcella, 519 SCRA 79; Italics
supplied).
2. If the test of relevance is logic and common sense, the
test of competence is the law or rules. If the law or a particular

rule excludes the evidence, it is incompetent. Competence is
primarily, therefore, a matter of law or rule. The question as
to competence is: Is the evidence allowed by the law or rules? If
it is allowed, the evidence is competent. If it is not allowed, it
is incompetent.
Imagine and assume, for the sake of illustration, that
a rule of evidence has just been adopted mandating that
only documentary evidence to which have been attached
a yellow ribbon on the bottom right corner may be marked
and admitted in evidence. If the adverse counsel presents for
identification and marking a document to which had been
attached a red ribbon, the document is to be excluded because
it is not competent. It is incompetent because the rule says so
regardless of its demonstrable logical relation to the fact in
issue.
3. Competence, in relation to evidence in general,
refers to the eligibility of a piece of evidence to be received
as such. However, when applied to a witness, the term
competent refers to the qualifications of the witness. In other
words, competence refers to his eligibility to take the stand
and testify. It is in this context that the term is normally
associated with. Thus, a trial objection employing the ground
incompetent is usually used in relation to the ineligibility of a
witness to testify because of the presence of a disability that
renders him unfit to take the stand.
If evidence offered is objected to on the ground that it is
incompetent, such objection is not an accepted form of objection
because it is a general objection. The objection should specify
the ground for its incompetence such as leading, hearsay, or
parol.
Although evidence is incompetent if excluded by law or
the rules, evidence is not objected to on the ground that it is

30

evidence

(The Bar Lectures Series)

CHAPTER I

incompetent. It is so general a term and cannot be appreciated

in court. Courts neither need nor appreciate generalities.
General objections are viewed with disfavor because specific
objections are required under Sec. 36, Rule 132 of the Rules of
Court. Thus, for purposes of trial objections, evidence is never
incompetent. It is people who are. It is sloppy usage to object
to a testimony or document as incompetent. Such term more
appropriately describes a witness who, under evidentiary
rules, does not possess the qualifications of a witness or suffers
from a disqualification to be one.
Competence of electronic evidence

Electronic evidence is competent evidence and is admis¬
sible if it complies with the rules on admissibility prescribed
by the Rules of Court and related laws, and is authenticated
in the manner prescribed by the Rules on Electronic Evidence
(Sec. 2, Rule 3, Rules on Electronic Evidence).
Admissibility and weight (probative value) of the evidence

1. Admissibility of evidence refers to the question of
whether or not the evidence is to be considered at all. On the
other hand, the probative value of the evidence refers to the
question of whether or not it proves an issue (PNOC Shipping
and Transport Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 297 SCRA 402
as cited in Atienza v. Board of Medicine, 642 SCRA 523, 529,
February 9, 2011).
Thus, a particular item of evidence may be admissible,
but its evidentiary weight depends on judicial evaluation
within the guidelines provided by the rules on evidence
(Heirs of Lourdes Saez Sabanpan v. Cormoposa, 408 SCRA
692). Admissibility is one thing, weight is another. To admit
evidence and not to believe it are not incompatible with each
other (Calamba Steel Center, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, 457 SCRA 482).

2. Stated in another way, the admissibility of evidence
should not be equated with the weight of the evidence.
The admissibility of the evidence depends on its relevance

—

PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
B. Admissibility of Evidence

31'

and competence while the weight of evidence pertains to
its tendency to convince and persuade. A particular item
of evidence may be admissible but its evidentiary weight
depends on judicial evaluation with the guidelines provided
by the rules on evidence (Tating v. Marcella, 519 SCRA 79).
Multiple admissibility (Bar 1984, 1991, 2005)

1. There are times when a proffered evidence is
admissible for two or more purposes. Thus, depending upon

the circumstances, the declaration of a dying person may be
admissible for several purposes. It may be offered as a dying
declaration (Sec. 38, Rule 130, Rules of Court), part of the
res gestae (Sec. 44, Rule 130, Rules of Court), or declaration
against interest (Sec. 40, Rule 130, Rules of Court). The
statement by a bus driver immediately after the collision, that
he dozed off on the wheel while driving, may he admissible as
an admission under Sec. 27 of Rule 130 or as part of the res
gestae pursuant to Sec. 44 of Rule 130.
The Court, in People v. Salafranca, 666 SCRA 501,
511, February 22, 2012, illustrates the principle of multiple
admissibility, thus:
“It appears from the foregoing testimony that
Bolanon had gone to the residence of Estafio, his unde,
to seek help right after being stabbed by Salafranca; that
Estafio had hurriedly dressed up to bring his nephew to the
Philippine General Hospital by taxicab; that on the way to
the hospital, Estafio had asked Bolanon who had stabbed
him, and the latter had told Estafio that his assailant
had been Salafranca; that at the time of the utterance
Bolanon had seemed to be having a hard time breathing,
causing Estafio to advise him not to talk anymore;
and that about ten minutes after his admission at the
emergency ward of the hospital, Bolanon had expired and
had been pronounced dead. Such circumstances qualified
the utterance of Bolanon as both a dying declaration and
as part of the res gestae, considering that the Court has
recognized that the statement of the victim an hour before
his death and right after the hacking incident bore all the

32

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

earmarks either of a dying declaration or part of the res
gestae, either of which was an exception to the hearsay
rule.”
2. Sometimes, evidence is inadmissible for one purpose
but admissible for another or vice versa. For instance, evidence
of a person’s bad general reputation for truth, honesty, or
integrity is objectionable if offered to prove that he committed
the crime charged but it may be admissible to impeach the
credibility of a witness under the authority of Sec. 11 of Rule
132.

3. Evidence may also be admissible against one party
but not against another. An extrajudicial statement of a
robbery suspect is not admissible against his co-accused under
the res inter alios acta rule but may be admissible against the
declarant himself as an admission pursuant to Sec. 27 of Rule
130.
Conditional admissibility (Bar 2011)

It happens frequently enough that the relevance of a
piece of evidence is not apparent at the time it is offered, but
the relevance of which will readily be seen when connected to
other pieces of evidence not yet offered. The proponent of the
evidence may ask the court that the evidence be conditionally
admitted in the meantime, subject to the condition that he is
going to establish its relevancy and competency at a later time.
If the connection is not shown as promised, the court may,
upon motion of the adverse party, strike out from the record
the evidence that was previously conditionally admitted.
Curative admissibility
1. The doctrine of curative admissibility allows a
party to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence to answer
the opposing party’s previous introduction of inadmissible
evidence. Thus, a party who first introduces either irrelevant
or incompetent evidence into the trial cannot complain of the
subsequent admission of similar evidence from the adverse

CHAPTER I

33

B. Admissibility of Evidence

party relating to the same subject matter. Conversely, the
doctrine should not be invoked where evidence was properly
admitted (For further readings, see Werdell v. Turzynski, 128
RI. App. 2d 139).
2. For example, in an action for damages arising from a
accident,
the plaintiff, despite objection by the defendant,
car
was allowed to introduce evidence to show that, on several
occasions, the defendant, in the past, had injured pedestrians
because of his negligence. The evidence was offered to prove
the defendant’s propensity for negligence. Of course, under the
rules, this kind of evidence is inadmissible because evidence
that a person did a certain thing at one time is not admissible
to prove that he did the same or a similar thing at another
time (Sec. 35, Rule 130, Rules of Court). If we were to follow
the concept of curative admissibility, the court may be asked
to give the defendant the chance to contradict or explain
his alleged past acts and to show evidence of his past acts
of diligence to counteract the prejudice which the improperly
admitted evidence may have caused.
Also, if hearsay evidence prejudicial to the defendant is
erroneously admitted despite objection, under the principle
of curative admissibility, the court should allow hearsay
evidence favorable to the same defendant.
Direct and circumstantial evidence (Bar 2011)

1. Direct evidence proves a fact without drawing any
inference (See Planteras, Jr. v. People, G.R. No. 238889,
October 3, 2018) from another fact. Thus, the testimony of
a prosecution witness claiming that he personally saw the
accused when the latter drew and fired his pistol at the victim,
without the latter’s provocation, is direct testimonial evidence.
There is also direct evidence when a witness, in a prosecution
for arson, testifies that he was only a few feet away, behind a
bush, when he saw the accused set the nipa hut of the offended
party on fire. Evidence is, likewise, direct when a witness
affirms in open court that the bus driver rammed a car on
the opposite lane, and that he saw what happened because he

was seated as a passenger right behind the driver. Also, the
original of a deed of sale is direct evidence of the terms of the
agreement of the parties.

Circumstantial or indirect evidence is the exact opposite
of direct evidence. When the evidence is circumstantial, a
fact is established by making an inference from a previously
established fact. In other words, in this type of evidence, the
court uses a fact from which an assumption is drawn. When
the court does not have to make an inference from one fact
to arrive at a conclusion, the evidence is direct (For further
readings, see Bacerra u. People, G.R. No. 204544, July 3, 2017).
For instance, the testimony of the victim that he dreads
the mere presence of the accused is direct evidence that the
statement was made. However, it is also circumstantial
evidence to show that this fear could have prevented the victim
from attacking the accused without provocation. Also, when
the fingerprints of the accused are found in a crime scene of
murder, such prints constitute circumstantial evidence that
he was in the same scene.
2. Circumstantial evidence or indirect evidence is
that evidence which indirectly proves a fact in issue through
an inference which the fact-finder draws from the evidence
established (People v. Ramirez, G.R. No. 218701, February 14,
2018) and indirectly proves a fact in issue (See Planteras, Jr.
v. People, G.R. No. 238889, October 3, 2018).
8. Circumstantial evidence, also known as indirect or
presumptive evidence, refers to proof of collateral facts and
circumstances wherein the existence of the main fact may
be inferred according to reason and common experience (See
People v. Lababo, G.R. No. 234651, June 6, 2018).
4. A legal claim to a property may be proven by means
other than direct evidence of ownership. Thus, it was held that:
“Although tax declarations or realty tax payments of property
are not conclusive evidence of ownership, nevertheless, they
are good indicia of possession in the concept of owner for no
one in his right mind would be paying taxes for a property
that is not in his actual or at least constructive possession.

They constitute at least proof that the holder has a claim of
title over the property. The voluntary declaration of a piece
of property for taxation purposes manifests not only one’s
sincere and honest desire to obtain title to the property and
announces his adverse claim against the State and all other
interested parties x x x. Such an act strengthens one’s bona
fide claim of acquisition of ownership” (Kawayan Corp. u.
Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 203090, September 5, 2018).

Conviction by circumstantial evidence (Bar 1998, 2011)

1. There is no requirement in our jurisdiction that
only direct evidence may convict (Bacerra v. People, GJL
No. 204544, July 3, 2017). The probative value of direct
evidence is generally neither greater than nor superior to
circumstantial evidence. Under the Rules of Court, there is
no distinction between direct evidence of facts and evidence
of circumstances from which the existence of a fact may be
inferred. In fact, a number of circumstantial evidence may be
so credible to establish a fact from which it may be inferred,
beyond reasonable doubt, that the elements of a crime exist
and that the accused is the perpetrator (Planteras, Jr. v.
People, G.R. No. 238889, October 3, 2018).
Direct evidence of the commission of a crime is not the
only matrix wherefrom a trial court may draw its conclusion
on a finding of guilt. Even in the absence of direct evidence,
conviction can be had if the established circumstances
constitute an unbroken chain, consistent with each other and
to the hypothesis that the accused is guilty, to the exclusion
of all other hypotheses that he is not (People v. Lara, G.R. No.
199877, August 13, 2012; See also Zabala v. People. G.R. No.
210760, January 26, 2015; People v. Urzais. G.R. No. 207662,
April 13, 2016). It must be stressed that direct evidence is
not the sole means of establishing the guilt of the accused
beyond reasonable doubt (Chua u. People, G.R. No. 172193,
September 13, 2017). As restated in a more recent case:
“[D]irect evidence of the commission of a crime is not the
only basis from which the court may draw its finding of guilt.
Resort to circumstantial evidence is sanctioned by Rule 133,

3g

EVIDENCE

CHAPTER I

(The Bar Lectures Series)

Section 4, of the Rules of Court” (People v. Ramirez, G.R. No.
218701, February 14, 2018).

2. The commission of a crime, the identity of the

perpetrator, and the finding of guilt may all be established by
circumstantial evidence (Bacerra v. People, G.R. No. 204544,
July 3, 2017). Direct proof, for instance, is not necessary to
prove conspiracy. It may be deduced from the acts of the
accused before, during, and after the commission of the crime
charged (People v. Jesalva, G.R. No. 227306, June 19, 2017).
3. Circumstantial evidence becomes significant when
there is no direct evidence of an act or an omission as when
no one witnessed the commission of a crime. In a criminal
case, circumstantial evidence may be sufficient for conviction
provided the following requisites concur:
(a) There is more than one circumstance;
(b) The facts from which the inferences are derived
are proven; and
(c) The combination of all the circumstances is
such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt
(Sec. 4, Rule 133, Rules of Court; People v. Tanchanco,
670 SCRA 130, 142-143, April 18, 2012; See also People
u. Lamsen, G.R. No. 198338, February 20, 2013; CalloClaridad v. Esteban, G.R. No. 191567, March 20, 2013;
Candelaria v. People, G.R. No. 209386, December 8, 2014;
People u. Ramirez, G.R. No. 218701, February 1 4, 2018). A
judgment of conviction based on circumstantial evidence
can be sustained when the circumstances proved form
an unbroken chain that results in a fair and reasonable
conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of all
others, as the perpetrator (People v. Lababo, G.R. No.
234651, June 6, 2018).

All the circumstances proved must be consistent with one
another, and they are to be taken together as proved. Being
consistent with one another and, taken together, they must
point unerringly to the direction of guilt and mere suspicions,
probabilities, or suppositions do not warrant a conviction

—

PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
B. Admissibility of Evidence

87

(Underhill, Criminal Evidence, 4th Ed., §18; Callo-Claridad v.
Esteban, G.R. No. 191567, March 20, 2013). The Court clarified
that the determination of whether circumstantial evidence
is sufficient to support a finding of guilt is a qualitative test
not a quantitative one. The proven circumstances must be
consistent with each other, consistent with the hypothesis that
the accused is guilty, and at the same time inconsistent with
the hypothesis that he is innocent (Planteras, Jr. v. People,
G.R. No. 238889, October 3, 2018).
Cumulative evidence and corroborative evidence

1. Cumulative evidence refers to evidence of the same
kind and character as that already given which tends to prove
the same proposition (Wynne v. Newman’s Adm’or, 75 Va. 811,
817).

For example, when a witness testifies that he saw the
event testified to and two other witnesses testify having seen
the same event which the first witness claimed he saw, the
subsequent testimonies constitute cumulative evidence.
2. Corroborative evidence is one that is supplementary
to that already given tending to strengthen or confirm it. It is
additional evidence of a different character to the same point
(Edwards v. Edwards, Tenn. App., 501 S.W. 2d 283, 289 as
cited in Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., p. 311).
As commonly used, the term connotes evidence which
tends to confirm, validate, or strengthen evidence already
presented. Thus, if W testifies that the gun marked as Exhibit
“A” was the weapon used by the accused in the shooting of
the victim, the findings of the crime laboratory that the gun
bears only the fingerprints of the accused corroborates the
testimony of W.
Also, the medical findings of the examining physician that
the woman was found to have lacerations in her private parts
consistent with forcible defloration, corroborate the testimony
of the victim that she was raped (People v. De Chavez, G.R.
No. 218427, January 31, 2018).

38

EVIDENCE

(The Bar Lectures Series)

Corroborative evidence is usually of a different type from
that previously offered but which tends to prove the same fact.
For instance, a witness claims that he saw Mr. X sign the
document subject of the action. Mr. X denies the authenticity
of his signature. Evidence by a handwriting expert that the
signature is indeed that of Mr. X is corroborative evidence.
Here, we have testimonial evidence from an eyewitness, and
testimony from an expert who did not personally witness the
signing of the document.

Although traditionally, this type of evidence is of a
different type from the one it corroborates, the meaning of
corroborative evidence has been loosely used in local courts
so as to cover also evidence of the same kind as that already
proffered as long as it affirms the previous evidence. For
instance, the testimony of X that he saw Y hack the victim
with a bolo corroborates the previous testimony of Z that
indeed he saw Y strike the victim with a bladed weapon.
Here, the previous testimony is corroborated by evidence of
the same kind, i.e., testimonial evidence from eyewitnesses.
In this sense, the corroborating evidence is also cumulative
even if it is of the same kind and character.
3. Corroborative testimony is not always required.
For example, in a case, the accused avers that his conviction
for estafa is without legal basis because there was no other
evidence, documentary or testimonial, establishing his
alleged crime except for the uncorroborated testimony of the
prosecution witness.
In clear terms, the Supreme Court, speaking through
Justice Regalado, ordained:
“... it also bears mention that the testimony of a
single prosecution witness, where credible and positive,
is sufficient to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt
of the accused. There is no law which requires that the
testimony of a single witness has to be corroborated,
except where expressly mandated in determining the
value and credibility of evidence. Witnesses are to be
weighed, not numbered” (People v. Pabalan, 262 SCRA
574, 585).

CHAPTER I - PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
B. Admissibility of Evidence

39

4. In People v. Rama, 350 SCRA 266, the defense faults
the trial court for relying on a single eyewitness account in
convicting the accused, Rama. The Supreme Court dismissed
the argument declaring that it has long been held that the
testimony of a sole eyewitness is sufficient to support a
conviction so long as it is clear, straightforward and worthy of
credence.
Corroborative evidence is necessary only when there are
reasons to suspect that the witness falsified the truth or that his
observations are inaccurate (Mangangey v. Sandiganbayan,
546 SCRA 51).
5. Under the Rule on Examination of a Child Witness,
corroboration shall not be required of a testimony of a child.
His or her testimony, if credible by itself, shall be sufficient to
support a finding of fact, conclusion or judgment subject to the
standard of proof required in criminal and non-criminal cases
(Sec. 22, Rule on Examination of a Child Witness).
6. In rape cases, the credibility of the victim is almost
always the single most important issue. If the testimony of
the victim passes the test of credibility, which means it is
credible, natural, convincing, and consistent with human
nature and the normal course of things, the accused may be
convicted solely on that basis (People v. Empuesto, G.R No.
218245, January 17, 2018).
Positive and negative evidence

1. Evidence is said to be positive when a witness
affirms on the stand that a certain state of facts does exist or
that a certain event happened. It is negative when the witness
states that an event did not occur or that the state of facts
alleged to exist does not actually exist.
Thus, the testimony of W that he saw P fire a gun at the
victim is positive evidence. The testimony of W that he could
not have fired the gun because he was not armed during the
incident is negative evidence.

40

EVIDENCE

CHAPTER I

(The Bar Lectures Series)

2. Positive and negative evidence may, likewise, refer
to the presence or absence of something. Thus, the presence
of fingerprints of a person in a particular place is positive
evidence of his having been present in said place although
absence of his fingerprints does not necessarily mean he was
not in the same place.

A negative finding in a paraffin test is not conclusive
evidence that one has not fired a gun because it is possible
for a person to fire a gun and yet bear no traces of nitrates
or gunpowder, as when the culprit washes his hands or
wears gloves (People u. Cerilla, 539 SCRA 251). Paraffin
tests, in general, have been rendered inconclusive by the
Court. Scientific experts concur in the view that a paraffin
test is extremely unreliable for use. It can only establish the
presence or absence of nitrates on the hand. However, the test
alone cannot determine whether the source of the nitrates or
nitrites was the discharge of firearm. The presence of nitrates
should be taken only as an indication of a possibility or even
of a probability but not of infallibility that a person has fired
a gun. Nitrates are also admittedly found in substances other
than gunpowder (Peralta v. People, G.R. No. 221991, August
30,2017).

3. The defense of denial is viewed with disfavor for
being inherently weak. It cannot prevail over the positive and
credible testimony of prosecution witnesses (People u. Reyes,
G.R. No. 194606, February 18, 2015). Greater weight is given
to the positive identification of the accused by the prosecution
witnesses than the accused’s denial (People u. Solina, G.R.
No. 196784, January 13, 2016). Denials are considered with
suspicion and received with caution because they are easily
fabricated and concocted (People u. Salahuddin, G.R. No.
206291, January 18, 2016).
4. Denials, which are essentially negations of a fact,
do not prevail over an affirmative assertion of such fact. Trial
and appellate courts have generally viewed such defense in
criminal cases with considerable caution, if not with outright
rejection. Such judicial attitude comes from the recognition
that denials are inherently weak and unreliable by virtue

—

PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
B. Admissibility of Evidence

41

of their being excuses that are too easy and too convenient
for the guilty to make. To be worthy of consideration at all,
denials should be substantiated by clear and convincing
evidence (Medina u People, G.R. No. 182648, June 17, 2015;
For further readings, see People u. Fabro, G.R. No. 208441,
July 17, 2017).
Between the categorical statements of prosecution
witnesses and the bare denial of the accused, the former must
prevail (People v. Salahuddin, G.R. No. 206291, January 18,
2016; See also People v. De la Rosa, G.R. No. 206419, June 1,
2016; People v. Fabro, G.R. No. 208441, July 1 7, 2017).
5.

Denial, as a defense, can only prosper when

substantiated by clear and convincing evidence (People
v. Colentava, G.R. No. 190348, February 9, 2015). This
pronouncement indicates that a denial is not a totally’ impotent
defense.
Denial may be weak but courts should not at once look
at them with disfavor. There are situations where an accused
may really have no other defenses but denial, which, if
established to be the truth, may tilt the scales of justice in
his favor, especially when the prosecution evidence itself is
weak. The defense of denial assumes significance when the
prosecution’s evidence is such that it does not prove guilt
beyond reasonable doubt (Franco v. People, G.R. No. 191185,
February 1, 2016).

In People v. Agaton, G.R. No. 251631, August 27, 2020,
quoting the case of Lejano v. People, G.R. No. 176389, December
14, 2010, the Court held:
But not all denials and alibis should be regarded as
fabricated. Indeed, if the accused is truly innocent, he can
have no other defense but denial and alibi. So how can
such accused penetrate a mind that has been made cynical
by the rule drilled into his head that a defense of alibi
is a hangman’s noose in the face of a witness positively
swearing, "1 saw him do it.”? Most judges believe that such
assertion automatically dooms an alibi which is so easy
to fabricate. This quick stereotype thinking, however, is

B

B. Admissibility of Evidence

distressing. For how else can the truth that the accused is
really innocent have any chance of prevailing over such a

2. Admissible evidence is not necessarily credible
evidence. Admissibility and credibility must be sharply
contrasted. They are two entirely different matters and
involve different concepts. The term “admissible” means that
the evidence is of such a character that the court, pursuant
to the rules on evidence, is bound to receive it or to allow it
to be introduced at the trial. Admissibility, however, does
not guarantee credibility. Admissibility is one thing and
credibility is another. For instance, the testimony of a person
who has been convicted of perjury may be admitted into the
records owing to the absence of an objection. However, it is
highly doubtful that the court would consider his testimony

stone-cast tenet?

There is only one way. A judge must keep an
open mind. He must guard against slipping into hasty
conclusion, often arising from a desire to quickly finish
the job of deciding a case. A positive declaration from a
witness that he saw the accused commit the crime should
not automatically cancel out the accused's claim that he
did not do it. A lying witness can make as positive an
identification as a truthful witness can. The lying witness
can also say as forthrightly and unequivocally, "He did
itr without blinking an eye.
Thus, if found credible, the defenses of denial
and alibi may, and should, be considered complete and
legitimate defenses. The burden of proof does not shift by
the mere invocation of said defenses; the presumption of
innocence remains in favor of the accused.

Competency of a witness distinguished from his credibility
(Bar 2004)

43

worthy of belief.

3. Jurisprudence adds: “[T]he admissibility of the
evidence should not be confused with its probative value.
Admissibility refers to the question of whether certain pieces
of evidence are to be considered at all, while probative value
refers to the question of whether the admitted evidence proves
an issue” (Tabuada v. Tabuada, G.R. No. 196510, September
12, 2018).

1. The competency of a witness differs from his
credibility. A witness may be competent, and yet give incredible
testimony; he may be incompetent, and yet his evidence, if
received, is perfectly credible (Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th
Ed., p. 257). The term “credibility” refers to worthiness of
belief, that quality which renders a witness worthy of belief
(Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., p. 330).

Inadmissible evidence In relation to arrests, searches, and
seizures (Bar 2000, 2009, 2010)

2. The meaning of credibility in law is exactly what it

1. A 1988 landmark case, People v. Aminnudin, 163
SCRA 402, demonstrates the inadmissibility of evidence due
to the legal infirmity of an arrest for noncompliance with the
requisites of the in flagrante delicto exception.
Here, more than two days before the arrest, constabulary
officers received a tip from an informer that the accused was
on board an identified vessel on a particular date and time
and was carrying marijuana. Acting on the information, they
waited for the accused and approached him as he descended
the gangplank of the ship and arrested him. A subsequent

means in ordinary usage: “believability.” After the competence
of a witness is allowed, the consideration of his credibility
follows.
Admissible evidence and credible evidence; admissibility of
evidence and probative value
1. Evidence is admissible when it is relevant to the
issue and is not excluded by the Constitution, the law or rules
(Sec. 3, Rule 128, Rules of Court).

Many cases decided by the courts raising the issue of
admissibility of evidence have been those connected to searches
as consequences of warrantless arrests by law enforcement

authorities.

44

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

inspection of his bag disclosed the presence of three kilos of
marijuana leaves.

The Court declared as inadmissible in evidence the
marijuana found in the possession of the accused as a product
of an illegal search and not being incident to a lawful arrest.
Emphatically, the Supreme Court ruled that the accused was
not, at the moment of his arrest, committing a crime nor was
it shown that he was about to do so or had just done so. He was
merely descending the gangplank of the ship and there was no
outward indication calling for his arrest. To all appearances, he
was like any of the other passengers innocently disembarking
from the vessel. It was only when the informer pointed to him
as the carrier of the marijuana that he suddenly became a
suspect and so subjected to apprehension.
The Court added that from the information received by
the officers, they could have obtained a warrant since they
had at least two days to apply for the same but the officers
made no efforts to comply with the bill of rights. They chose
to ignore the law. The marijuana is incompetent evidence
because its seizure was illegal. The seizure was not incident
to a valid arrest.
2. In People v. Molina, 352 SCRA 174, the conviction by
the trial court was reversed and set aside when the Supreme
Court declared as invalid an arrest made merely on the basis
of alleged reliable information that the persons arrested were
carrying marijuana. The accused were arrested while inside
a pedicab despite the absence of any outward indication of a
crime being committed.
Similarly, in Malacat v. Court of Appeals, 283 SCRA 159,
the Supreme Court declared that a warrantless arrest cannot
be justified where no crime is being committed at the time
of the arrest because no crime may be inferred from the fact
that the eyes of the person arrested were “moving fast” and
“looking at every person” passing by.
3. Another classic case that illustrates an invalid
arrest and a subsequent illegal search and seizure is People
v. Mengote, 210 SCRA 174. The issue on the legality of the

CHAPTER I

—

PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
B. Admissibility of Evidence

46

arrest, search and seizure stemmed from a telephone call to
the police from an alleged informer that suspicious-looking
men were at a street corner in Tondo shortly before noon. The
police operatives dispatched to the place saw three men, one
of whom turned out to be Mengote who was “looking from side
to side” clutching his abdomen. The operatives approached
the three men and introduced themselves as policemen. Two
of them accordingly tried to run away but the attempt was
foiled. The search yielded a revolver in the possession of
Mengote and a fan knife in the pocket of another. Mengote
contended that the revolver should not have been admitted in
evidence because its seizure was a product of an illegal search
and not made as an incident to a lawful arrest.
The Court ruled that the requirements of a warrantless
arrest were not complied with. There was no offense which
could have been suggested by the acts of Mengote of looking
from side to side while holding his abdomen. Observed the
Court:
“These are certainly not sinister acts, x x x He was
not skulking in the shadows but walking in the clear light
of day. There was nothing clandestine about his being on
that street at that busy hour in the blaze of the noonday
sun. x x x By no stretch of the imagination could it have
been inferred from these acts that an offense had just
been committed, or was at least being attempted in their
presence.”

4. One case, People v. Laguio, Jr., 518 SCRA 393, and
which drew much from the ruling in Aminnudin, likewise,
aptly illustrates the application of the doctrine.

In this case, two men were arrested while they were about
to hand over a bag of shabu to a police officer. Questioned, the
arrested men told police operatives that they were working for
a modeling agency owned by a certain Wang, that they knew
of a scheduled delivery of shabu early the following morning
and that their employer, Wang, could be found at a certain
apartment building in Malate, Manila. The police operatives
looked for Wang to shed light on the illegal drug activities

46

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

of his alleged employees, proceeded to the location of the
apartment and placed the same under surveillance.
When Wang came out of the apartment towards a parked
car, two other police officers approached him, introduced
themselves as police officers, asked his name and, upon hearing
that he was Wang, immediately frisked him and asked him to
open the back compartment of the car. When frisked, there
was found inside the front right pocket of Wang a pistol with
live ammunition which was later verified to be unlicensed. At
the same time, the other members of the operatives searched
the car and found transparent plastic bags with shabu, cash in
the amount of P650,000.00, electronic and mechanical scales,
and another unlicensed pistol with magazine. Then and there,
Wang objected to the warrantless arrest and search.
The Supreme Court, in no uncertain terms, declared
that the facts and circumstances surrounding the case did not
manifest any suspicious behavior on the part of Wang that
would reasonably invite the attention of the police. He was
merely walking from the apartment and was about to enter
a parked car when the police operatives arrested him, frisked
and searched his person and commanded him to open the
compartment of the car. He was not committing any visible
offense then. Therefore, there can be no valid warrantless
arrest in flagrante delicto under paragraph (a) of Sec. 5, Rule
113. It is settled, said the Court, that reliable information
alone, absent any overt act indicative of a felonious enterprise
in the presence and within the view of the arresting officers,
is not sufficient to constitute probable cause that would justify
an in flagrante delicto arrest (Citing People v. Binad Sy Chua,
444 Phil. 757 and People v. Molina, 352 SCRA 174).
In Laguio, Jr., what was clearly established from the
testimonies of the arresting officers, said the Court, was that
Wang was arrested mainly on the information that he was the
employer of the two men who were previously arrested and
charged for illegal transport of shabu. They did not, in fact,
identify Wang to be their source of the shabu when they were
caught in flagrante delicto. Upon their declaration that there

47

will be a delivery of shabu on the early morning of the following
day and that Wang may be found in an apartment building in
Malate, the arresting officers conducted what they termed was
a “surveillance” operation in front of said apartment, hoping
to find a person who will match the description of Wang, the
employer of the arrested men.
The conclusion of the trial court that the warrantless
arrest was illegal and that, ipso jure, the warrantless search
incidental to the illegal arrest was, likewise, unlawful was
sustained by the Supreme Court.
5. In Valdez v. People, 538 SCRA 611, the prosecution’s
evidence indicated that petitioner was arrested without a
warrant. When he alighted from a mini-bus at around 8:30
in the evening, he was accordingly looking around seemingly
searching for something and appeared suspicious. Besides, he
allegedly ran when the tanods approached him. After his arrest
following a chase, dried marijuana leaves were found inside
his bag according to the barangay tanods. His conviction by
the Regional Trial Court was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
The accused prayed for his acquittal on appeal to the Supreme
Court alleging, among other defenses, that this warrantless
arrest was illegal and that the warrantless search of his bag
was likewise contrary to law.
The Court ruled that in order to determine the
admissibility of the seized items in evidence, it is indispensable
to ascertain whether or not the search, which yielded the
alleged contraband, was lawful. The warrantless search would
be justified only if it were incidental to a lawful arrest.
The Court found that even casting aside the petitioner’s
version of the facts including his vehement denial of ownership
and possession of the seized items, the petitioner’s unlawful
arrest stands out just the same. Not one of the circumstances
prevailing under Sec. 5 of Rule 113 authorizing warrantless
arrests applies to the arrest of the petitioner. Petitioner was
not committing a crime at the time he alighted from the
bus, nor did he appear to be committing a crime. The act of

(The Bar Lectures Series)

petitioner of looking around after getting off the bus was but
natural as he was finding his way to his destination. That he
purportedly attempted to run away as he was approached is
irrelevant and cannot, by itself, be construed as adequate for
a tanod to have personal knowledge that petitioner had just
engaged in, was actually engaging in, or was attempting to
engage in criminal activity. It is not unreasonable to expect
the petitioner, after being approached by unknown persons
at night, to attempt to flee at their approach. Flight is not
a reliable indicator of guilt. When petitioner was arrested
without a warrant, he was neither caught in flagrante delicto
committing a crime nor was the arrest effected in hot pursuit.
The Court, in effect, ruled on the inadmissibility of the seized
evidence.

6. In Comerciante v. People (G.R. No. 205926, July 22,
2015), the Court struck down, as illegal, an arrest and the
seizure of drugs because the basis for the arrest was that the
accused was making “improper and unpleasant movements.”

7. However, in De Villa v. People (G.R. No. 224039,
September 11, 2019) and People v. Veloo (G.R. No. 252154,
March 24, 2021), the Court held that where the accused was
caught in flagrante delicto during a mere routine checkpoint
operation, a slight deviation from the requirements under
Sec. 21 of RA No. 9165, as amended, maybe justified and will
not automatically render the seized evidence inadmissible.
8. Under the newly-promulgated Rules on the Use
of Body-Worn Cameras in the Execution of Warrants (A.M.
No. 21-06-08-SC), failure to observe the requirement of using
body-worn cameras or alternative recording devices, without
reasonable grounds, during the execution of a search warrant
shall render the evidence obtained inadmissible for the
prosecution of the offense for which the search warrant was
applied.

and must lie outside judicial cognizance (People v. De Guzman,
676 SCRA 347, 360, July 11, 2012; See also People v. Fieldad,
G.R. No. 196005, October 1, 2014). This is because evidence
to be believed, must proceed not only from the mouth of a
credible witness but must be credible in itself as to hurdle the
test of conformity with the knowledge and common experience
of mankind (See People v. Baytos, G.R. No. 225623, June 7,
2017; People v. Belmonte, G.R. No. 220889, July 5, 2017).
The testimony of a single witness, if credible and positive,
is sufficient to produce a conviction (People v. Opiniano,
G.R. No. 181474, July 26, 2017). In fact, an accused may be
convicted solely on the basis of the testimony of the victim
where such testimony is credible, convincing, and consistent
with human nature and the normal course of things (People v.
Carillo, G.R. No. 212814, July 12, 2017).

“x x x A medical examination of the victim is not indis¬
pensable in a prosecution for rape inasmuch as the victim’s
testimony alone, if credible, is sufficient to convict the accused
of the crime. A doctor’s certificate is merely corroborative in
character and not an indispensable requirement in proving the
commission of rape x x x. In the crime of rape, the testimony of
the victim, and not the findings of the medico-legal officer, is
the most important element to prove that the felony has been
committed. Moreover, the absence of external injuries does
not negate rape. In fact, even the [presence] of spermatozoa
is not an essential element of rape” (People u. Bauit, G.R. No.
223102, February 14, 2018).
2. Findings and conclusions of the trial court on the
credibility of witnesses are entitled to great respect because
the trial courts have the advantage of observing the demeanor
of witnesses as they testify. The determination by the trial
court of the credibility of witnesses, when affirmed by the
appellate court, is accorded full weight and credit as well as
great respect, if not conclusive effect (People v. Solina, G.R.
No. 196784, January 13, 2016; See also People v. Sulayao,
G.R. No. 198952, September 6, 2017), except when facts or

significance of which was misappreciated or misinterpreted
by the lower courts (People u. Dela Pena, G.R. No. 207635,
February 18, 2015; People u. Abella, G.R. No. 195666, January
20, 2016; See also Saraum v. People, G.R. No. 205472, January
25, 2016; People v. Tuballas, G.R. No. 218572, June 19, 2017;
For related readings, see People v. Ladra, G.R. No 221443,
July 17, 2017; See also People v. Francia, G.R. No. 208625,
September 6, 2017).

From its vantage point, the trial court is in the best
position to determine the truthfulness of witnesses (People u.
Macaranas, G.R No. 226846, June 21, 201 7; People v. Reyes,
G.R No. 207946, September 27, 2017). The task of assigning
values to the testimonies of witnesses and weighing their
credibility is best left to the trial judge by virtue of the first¬
hand impressions he derives while the witnesses testify before
him. The demeanor on the witness chair of persons sworn to
tell the truth in judicial proceedings is a significant element
of judicial adjudication because it can draw the line between
fact and fancy. Their forthright answers or hesitant pauses,
their quivering voices or angry tones, their flustered looks
or sincere gazes, their modest blushes or guilty glances
all these can reveal if the witnesses are telling the truth or
lying through their teeth. As the final appellate reviewer in
this case, then, the Court bows to the age-old norm to accord
the utmost respect to the findings and conclusions on the
credibility of witnesses reached by the trial judge on account
of his unmatched opportunity to observe the witnesses and on
account of his personal access to the various indicia available
but not reflected in the record (People u Sabadlab, 668 SCRA
237, 247, March 14, 2012; See also People v. Espejon, G.R.

3. The Court is guided by the following jurisprudence
when confronted with the issue of credibility of witnesses on
appeal:

—

PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
B. Admissibility of Evidence

61

“First, the Court gives the highest respect to the
RTC’s evaluation of the testimony of the witnesses,
considering its unique position in directly observing the
demeanor of a witness on the stand. From its vantage
point, the trial court is in the best position to determine
the truthfulness of witnesses.
Second, absent any substantial reason which
would justify the reversal of the RTC’s assessments and
conclusions, the reviewing court is generally bound by the
lower court's findings, particularly when no significant
facts and circumstances, affecting the outcome of the
case, are shown to have been overlooked or disregarded.
And third, the rule is even more stringently applied
if the CA concurred with the RTC” (People v. Sanchez, 665
SCRA 639, 643, February 8, 2012; For further readings,
see People v. Sapitula, G.R. No. 209212, February 10,

2016).

4. Different people react differently to a given stimulus
or type of situation, and there is no standard form of behavioral
response that can be expected from those who are confronted
with a strange, startling or frightening experience (People v.
Reyes, G.R. No. 207946, September 27, 2017). People react
differently under emotional stress. There is no standard form
of behavior when one is confronted by a shocking incident,
especially if the assailant is physically near. The workings
of the human mind when placed under emotional stress
are unpredictable. In a given situation, some may shout,
others may faint, and still others may be frozen into silence.
Consequently, the failure of complainant to run away or shout
for help at the very first opportunity cannot be construed as
consent to the sexual intercourse (Sison v. People, 666 SCRA
645, 662, February 22, 20 12; See also People v. Court of Appeals,
G.R. No. 183652, February 25, 2015; People u. Gacusan, G.R.
No. 207776, April 26, 2017). In fact, no clear-cut behavior can
be expected even of a person being raped or who has been
raped (People v. Carillo, G.R. No. 212814, July 12, 2017).

5. Inconsistencies on minor details or collateral matters
do not affect the veracity, substance or weight of the testimony

52

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

of a witness (People v. Divinagracia, Sr., G.R. No. 207765, July
26, 2017; See also People v. Espera, G.R. No. 227313, November
21, 2018). Minor inconsistencies in the narration of facts
which pertain only to trivial, collateral and inconsequential
matters, do not affect the credibility of the witness as when the
witness showed inconsistencies on questions as to the number
of officers who chased the accused and whether or not media
men were present in the crime scene. These inconsistencies
are treated as badges of truth rather than indicia of falsehood.
Instead of weakening the evidence of the prosecution, minor
inconsistencies strengthen the theory of the prosecution as
they show that the testimony is not rehearsed (See People v.
Sulayao, G.R. No. 198952, September 6, 2017; See also People
v. Cabilida, Jr., G.R. No. 222964, July 11, 2018). For instance,
inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the testimony of a rape
victim are not unusual considering that the painful experience
is oftentimes not remembered in detail (People v. De Chavez,
G.R No. 218427, January 31, 2018; For further readings, see
also Flores u. People, G.R. No. 222861, April 23, 2018; People
u. Chan, G.R. No. 226836, December 5, 2018).
It is perfectly natural for different witnesses testifying
on the occurrence of a crime to give varying details as there
may be some details which one witness may notice while the
other may not observe or remember. In fact, jurisprudence
even warns against a perfect dovetailing of narration by
different witnesses as it could mean that their testimonies
were fabricated and rehearsed (People v. Cabtalan, 666 SCRA
174, 191, February 15, 2012). Inaccuracies may, in fact,
suggest that the witnesses are telling the truth and have not
been rehearsed (People v. Torres, G.R. No. 189850, September
22, 2014). The rule, therefore, is that if a witness’ testimony
contains inconsistencies or discrepancies, such fact does not
alone, diminish the credibility of such testimony (People v.
Gerola, G.R. No. 217973, July 19, 2017).

C. Miscellaneous Doctrines

Falsus In uno, falsus In omnibus
1. Literally, falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus means
“false in one thing, false in everything” (Dawson v. Bertolini,
70 R.I. 325, 38A.2d 765, 768). It is particularly applied to the
testimony of a witness who may be considered unworthy of
belief as to all the rest of his evidence if he is shown to have
testified falsely in one detail (See Frondarina v. Malazarte,
G.R. No. 148423, December 6, 2006).
2. The maxim falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus is not an
absolute rule of law and is, in fact, rarely applied in modem
jurisprudence (People v. Batin, 539 SCRA 272). It deals only
with the weight of the evidence and is not a positive rule of
law. The rule is not an inflexible one of universal application.
Modem trend in jurisprudence favors more flexibility when
the testimony of a witness may be partly believed and partly
disbelieved depending on the corroborative evidence presented
at the trial (People v. Negosa, 456 Phil. 861).
3. Before this maxim can be applied, the witness must
be shown to have willfully falsified the truth on one or more
material points. The principle presupposes the existence of a
positive testimony on a material point contrary to subsequent
declarations in the testimony (Northwest Airlines, Inc. v.
Chiong, 543 SCRA 308).
For instance, in People v. Letigio, 268 SCRA. 227, the
accused alleged that both prosecution witnesses in certain
aspects of their testimony, had “deliberately and wantonly
lied” in inculpating him, and contended that the maxim
“falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus” should be applied for his
exculpation.
Quoting an earlier pronouncement in People v.
Manalansan, 189 SCRA 619, the Court stressed:
"... The maxim falsus in unus, falsus in omnibus does
not lay down a categorical test of credibility. While the
witnesses may differ in their recollections of an incident.

EVIDENCE

54

(The Bar Lectures Series)

it does not necessarily follow from their disagreements
that all of them should be disbelieved as liars and their
testimonies completely discarded as worthless."

In People u. Pacapac, 248 SCRA 77, the Court added that
the maxim:
"... is not a positive rule of law or of universal
application. It should not be applied to portions of the
testimony corroborated by other evidence, particularly
where the false portions could be innocent mistakes.
Moreover, the rule is not mandatory but merely
sanctions a disregard of the testimony of a witness if the
circumstances so warrant. To completely disregard all the
testimony of a witness on this ground, his testimony must
have been false as to a material point, and the witness
must have a conscious and deliberate intention to falsify
a material point”

CHAPTER I -PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
C. MisceDaneous Doctrines

65

Alibi and denial must be brushed aside when the prosecution
has sufficiently and positively ascertained the identity of
the accused (Etino v. People, G.R. No. 206632, February
14, 2018). Denial is a self-serving negative evidence, which
cannot be given greater weight than that of the declaration of
a credible witness who testifies on affirmative matters (People
v. Damayo, G.R. No. 232361, September 26, 2018; See also
People v. Evasco, G.R. No. 213415, September 26, 2018).
2. Alibi crumbles in the light of positive identification
by truthful witnesses. The positive identification of the
accused, when categorical and consistent, and without any illmotive on the part of the eyewitnesses testifying on the matter,
prevails over alibi and denial (People u Camat, 677 SCRA
640, 658-659, July 30, 2012; See also People v. Cabungan,
G.R. No. 189355, January 23, 2013; People v. Domingo, G.R
No. 211672, June 1, 2016).

Alibi; denial (Bar 1994)

Alibi; not always false

1. It is a settled doctrine that the defense of alibi is
inherently weak and must be rejected when the identity of the
accused is satisfactorily and categorically established by the
eyewitnesses to the offense, especially when such eyewitnesses
have no ill motive to testify falsely (People v. Viojela, G.R.
No. 177140, October 17, 2012; See Ibanez v. People, G.R. No.
190798, January 27, 2016; People v. Fabro, G.R. No. 208441,
July 17, 2017). Positive identification prevails over alibi since
the latter can be easily fabricated and is inherently unreliable
(People v. Dadao, G.R. No. 201860, January 22, 2014; See also
People v. Lagbo, G.R. No. 207535, February 10, 2016; People
v. Carillo, G.R. No. 212814, July 12, 2017; See also People v.
Ronquillo, G.R. No. 214762, September 20, 2017; People u.
Espera, G.R. No. 227313, November 21, 2018).

1. Alibi is not always false and without merit (People
v. Cacayan, 557 SCRA 550). Contrary to the common notion,
alibi is not always a weak defense. Sometimes, the fact that

Also, mere denial, without any strong evidence to
support it, can scarcely overcome the positive declaration by
the victim of the identity and involvement of an accused in
the crime attributed to him. The same is true with the claim
of alibi (People v. Quiapo, G.R. No. 218804, August 6, 2018).

the accused was somewhere else may just be the plain and
unvarnished truth. But to be exonerating, the defense of alibi
must be so airtight that it would admit of no exception. It must
be demonstrated that the person charged with the crime was
not only somewhere else when the offense was committed, but
was so far away that it would be physically impossible to be
at the place of the crime or its immediate vicinity at the time
of its commission. The reason is that no person can be in two
places at the same time (People v. Baro, 383 SCRA 75; People
v. Ubina, 527 SCRA 307).
2. While the defense of alibi is by nature a weak one, it
assumes significance and strength where the evidence for the
prosecution is also intrinsically weak (People u. Canlas, 372
SCRA 401). The rule that alibi is a weak defense has never
been intended to change the burden of proof in criminal cases.
The burden of proof still lies in the prosecution to establish

CHAPTER 1- PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS
C. Miscellaneous Doctrines

EVIDENCE

56

(The Bar Lectures Series)

the guilt of the accused (People v. De Guzman, 676 SCRA 347,
365, July 11,2012; See also Franco v. People, G.R. No. 191185,
February 1, 2016).

3. Alibi may serve as a basis for acquittal if it can really
be shown by clear and convincing evidence that it was indeed
physically impossible for the accused to be at the scene of the
crime at the time of its commission (People v. Cacayan, 557
SCRA 550; People v. De Leon, 580 SCRA 617).
4. For the defense of alibi to prosper, the requirements
of time and place must be strictly met. It is not enough to
prove that the accused was somewhere else when the crime
was committed, but he must also demonstrate by clear and
convincing evidence that it was physically impossible for him
to have been at the scene of the crime at the time the same
was committed (People v. Castro, 668 SCRA 291, 300-301,
March 14, 2012; See also People v. Baraoil, 676 SCRA 24, 35,
July 9, 2012; Ibanez v. People, G.R No. 190798, January 27,
2016).
5.

In People u. Mercado, G.R. No. 213832, December 7,

2015, the Court did not appreciate the defense of alibi because

the place where the accused claimed to be was merely seven
kilometers from where the killings occurred.

In the celebrated case of People v. Larranaga, 463 SCRA
652, the Supreme Court gave no credence to the alibi that
the accused, Larranaga, was in Quezon City on the date and
time the alleged crime was committed because it was not
impossible for him to be in Cebu on said date and time. The
Court ratiocinated, thus:
“During the hearing, it was shown that it takes
only one (1) hour to travel by plane from Manila to Cebu
and that there are four (4) airline companies plying the
route. One of the defense witnesses admitted that there
are several flights from Manila to Cebu each morning,
afternoon and evening . . ."

In a more recent case, the Court ruled that the distance
alone from Meycauayan, Bulacan to Nueva Ecija does not

67

conclusively prove that it was physically impossible for the
accused to go to Nueva Ecija and still return to Bulacan to
commit the crime of rape (People v. Padlan, G.R. No. 214880,
September 6, 2017). The excuse must be so airtight that it
would admit of no exception. Where there is even the least
possibility of the presence of the accused in the crime scene,
alibi will not hold water (People v. Dillatan, Sr., G.R. No.
212191, September 5, 2018).
Frame-up
1. Allegations of frame-up by police officers are
common and standard defenses in most dangerous drugs
cases. For this claim to prosper, the defense must adduce clear
and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption that
government officials have performed their duties in a regular
and proper manner. Thus, in the absence of proof of motive to
falsely impute such a serious crime against the accused, the
presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty
shall prevail (People u. Almodiel, G.R. No. 200951, September
5, 2012; People v. Steve, G.R. No. 204911, August 6, 2014).
2. The defense of frame-up is not looked upon with
favor due to its being conveniently concocted. In one case, the
accused did not assail the integrity of the drug confiscated
from him except by insisting on being framed-up by the
policemen. The Court considered the defense as insincere
because the accused did not bother to formally charge the
policemen for the supposed frame-up and extortion. Such
failure can only be regarded, according to the Court, as his
tacit admission that the evidence had not been tampered or
meddled with. The Court, likewise, observed that the accused
did not even adduce evidence to substantiate his story of being
falsely incriminated (People v. Bautista, 666 SCRA 518, 536,
February 22, 2012; See also People v. Velasquez, 669 SCRA
307, 318, April 11, 2012; People v. Tapugay, G.R. No. 200336,
February 11, 2015).

Delay and initial reluctance In reporting a crime

It is settled that the delay in the filing of a complaint
proper authorities would not impair the credibility
the
before
complainant
if such delay is satisfactorily explained
of the
People,
(Etino v.
G.R. No. 206632, February 14, 2018). For
example, the delay in reporting rape incidents, in the face
of threats of physical violence, cannot be taken against the
victim because the delay is not an indication of a fabricated
charge and does not necessarily cast doubt on the credibility
of the complainant (People v. Quiapo, G.R. No. 218804, August
1.

6, 2018).
2. Thecelebrated double murder and frustrated murder
cases of People v. Teehankee, Jr., 249 SCRA 54, illustrate the
willingness of the Court to take judicial notice of the natural
reticence of witnesses to get involved in the solution of crimes.
The witness, who actually saw the shooting of the victims
by theaccused and had a clear and positive identification of the
plate number of the assailant’s car, denied having witnessed
the crime during the investigation by the police and the NBI.
He refused to volunteer information to anyone as to what he
supposedly witnessed. It was only after consistent prodding
and assurance of protection from NBI officials that he agreed
to cooperate with the authorities. The Court recognized that
the initial reluctance of the fear-gripped witness to reveal to
the authorities what he supposedly witnessed was sufficiently
explained during the trial. His fear was not imaginary. He saw
with his own eyes the senseless violence perpetrated by the
accused. He knew that the accused belonged to an influential
family. In his own words, he testified that his reluctance was
due to his fear for his and his family's safety.

3. Even the victim may choose to keep quiet rather
than expose a defilement to the harsh glare of public scrutiny.
Only when the delay is unreasonable or unexplained may it
work to discredit the complainant (People v. Navarette, Jr.,
666 SCRA 689, 704, February 22, 2012; See also People V.
Pateno, G.R. No. 209040, December 9, 2015).

Flight or non-flight of the accused

1. Flight per se is not synonymous with guilt. However,
when flight is unexplained, it is a circumstance from which
an inference of guilt may be drawn. “Indeed, the wicked flee

when no man pursueth, but the innocent are as bold as a
lion” (People v. Camat, 677 SCRA 610, 667, July 30, 2012;
See also Candelaria v. People, G.R. No. 209386, December
8, 2014). Flight betrays a desire to evade responsibility and
is, therefore, a strong indication of guilt (People v. Adviento,
668 SCRA 486, 500-501, March 20, 2012; People v. Cruz, 726
SCRA 608).
2. Culprits behave differently and even erratically in
externalizing and manifesting their guilt. Some may escape
a circumstance strongly illustrative of guilt
or flee
while others may remain in the same vicinity so as to create
a semblance of regularity, thereby avoiding suspicion from
other members of the community (People v. Dadao, G.R. No.

—

—

201860, January 22, 2014).

The fact that appellants never fled the locality where
the crime was committed is not, by itself, a valid defense
because non-flight does not signify innocence. Non-flight is
simply inaction, which may be due to several factors. It cannot
be singularly considered as evidence or a manifestation
determinative of innocence (People v. Amodia, 571 SCRA
444). There is no law or principle holding that non-flight per
se is proof, let alone conclusive proof, of innocence. Much like
the defense of alibi, the defense of non-flight cannot prevail
against the weight of positive identification of the appellants
(People v. Dacibar, 325 SCRA 725).
Recantation

“A recantation does not necessarily cancel an earlier
declaration. The rule is settled that in cases where the
previous testimony is retracted and a subsequent different,
if not contrary, testimony is made by the same witness, the
test to decide which testimony to believe is one of comparison
coupled with the application of the general rules of evidence.

A testimony solemnly given in court should not be set aside
and disregarded lightly, and before this can be done, both
the previous testimony and the subsequent one should be
carefully compared x x x, the circumstances under which each
was made, carefully and keenly scrutinized, and the reasons,
and motives for the change discriminately analysed.” (Sterling

BURDEN OF PROOF, QUANTUM
OF EVIDENCE AND PRESUMPTIONS
A. Burden of Proof and Burden of Evidence
Burden of proof (Bar 2004)
1. Case law has defined “burden of proof” as the duty
to establish the truth of a given proposition or issue by such
quantum of evidence as the law demands in the case at which
the issue arises (Republic v. De Borja, G.R. No. 187448,
January 9, 2017). The burden of proof or onus probandi
traditionally refers to the obligation of a party to a litigation
to persuade the court that he is.entitled to relief. To persuade
the court, one has to prove what he alleges. It is well-settled
that he who alleges a fact has the burden of proving the same.
As jurisprudence puts it: “A mere allegation is not evidence”
(Tze Sun Wong v. Wong, G.R. No. 180364, December 3, 2014).
The term is defined in Sec. 1, Rule 131 of the Rules of
Court, as amended, thus:
“SECTION 1. Burden of proof and burden of
evidence. — Burden of proof is the duty of a party to
present evidence on the facts in issue necessary to
establish his or her claim or defense by the amount of
evidence required by law. Burden of proof never shifts,

x x x."
2.

It is, thus, inaccurate to state that the burden of

proof rests solely on the shoulders of the plaintiff. The burden
of proof, under the clear terms of Sec. 1 of Rule 131, is the duty

CHAPTER II - BURDEN OF PROOF. QUANTUM
OF EVIDENCE AND PRESUMPTIONS
A. Burdrn of Proof and Burdrn of Evidmrr

(The Bur Izrturw Serios)

of a party to present evidence not only to establish a claim but
also a defense. It will be observed that the rule does not define
burden of proof as the duty of the plaintiff but as the duty of
a “party." For instance, in an action for damages anchored on
a quasi-delict under Art. 2176 of the Civil Code, the plaintiff
has the burden of proving that the fault or negligence of
the defendant was the proximate cause of the injuries he
sustained. On the other hand, the defendant has the burden
to prove hia defense as when he claims that the injuries of the
plaintiff were caused, not by his wrongful conduct, but by a
third person or a caso fortuito.

The concept of “burden of proof may be capsulized by a
very familiar refrain in jurisprudence that, “He who alleges
a fact has the burden of proving it.” A mere allegation is not
evidence (See Lavarez v. Guevara, G.R. No. 206103, March 29,
2017). Hence, the person who alleges payment has the burden
of proving that payment has indeed been made (Edison
[Bataan] Cogeneration Corp. u. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, G.R. No. 201665, August 30, 2017). If the plaintiff,
for example, alleges that the defendant owes him a sum of
money, the plaintiff has the burden to prove the debt.
As aptly described by the Court: “Burden of proof is
the duty of a party to present evidence on the facts in issue
necessary to establish his claim or defense by the amount or
evidence required by law” (BJDC Construction v. Lanuzo,
G.R. No. 161151, March 24, 2014; Bela Cruz v. Octaviano,
G.R. No. 219649, July 26, 2017). If a litigant alleges that
the document, subject of the action, is a forgery, he has the
burden to establish the forgery. Forgery cannot be presumed
(Philippine Trust Company v. Gabincte, G.R. No. 216120,

March 29, 2017).
Jurisprudential pronouncements on burden of proof

1. In drug cases, the State bears the burden of proving
the elements of the illegal sale of dangerous drugs in violation
of Sec. 5 of R.A. No. 9165 and of the illegal possession of
dangerous drugs in violation of Sec. 11 of the same law (People

63

u. Nepomuceno, G.R. No. 216062, September 19. 2018). In civil
cases, it is a basic rule that the party making allegations has

the burden of proving them by preponderance of evidence
(Alano v. Magud-Logmao, G.R No. 175540, April 7, 2014). By
preponderance of evidence is meant that the evidence adduced
by one side is, as a whole, superior to that of the other side
(NFF Industrial Corp. v. G & L Associated Brokerage, G.R. No.
178169, January 12, 2015: See also Dela Cruz v. Octaviano,
G.R. No. 219649, July 26, 2017).
2.

In administrative cases, the complainant bears

the onus in proving the averments of his complaint by
substantial evidence. Pointing out circumstances based on
mere conjectures and suppositions are not sufficient to prove
accusations (Lorcnzana v. Austria, A.M. No. RTJ-09-2200,
April 2, 2014).
3. In cases of illegal dismissal, the employer bears
the burden of proof to prove that the termination was for a
valid and authorized cause (See also Sterling Paper Products
Enterprises, Inc. v. KMM-Katipunan. GJi. No. 221493.
August 2, 2017). Its failure to do so would necessarily lead to
a judgment of illegal dismissal (American Power Conversion
Corp. v. Lim, G.R. No. 214291, January II. 2018).
4. Whoever claims entitlement to the benefits provided
by law should establish his right thereto by substantial

evidence (InterOrient Maritime Enterprises, Inc. v. Creer III,
G.R. No. 181921, September 17, 2014). In claims for disability
benefits, for instance, the onus probandi falls on the claimant
to establish his claim for disability benefits (Bahia Shipping
Services, Inc. v. Hipe, Jr., G.R. No. 204699, November 12,
2014).

5. He who attacks the constitutionality of a law
has the onus probandi to show why the law is repugnant
to the Constitution. Failing to overcome its presumption
of constitutionality, a claim that a law is cruel, unusual or
inhuman, must fail. The reason for the rule is the presumption
that the legislature intended to enact a valid, sensible and
just law which operates no further than may be necessary’ to

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

effectuate the specific purpose of the law. Every statute is,
therefore, presumed to be valid and constitutional (Perez u
People, 544 SCRA 532).
6. The Court has held that one who denies the due
execution of a deed, where one’s signature appears, has the
burden of proving that, contrary to the recital in the jurat, one
never appeared before the notary public and acknowledged
the deed to be a voluntary act (Chua v. Westmont Bank, 667
SCRA 56, 65, February 27, 2012).

7. The burden of proof that a debt was contracted lies
with the creditor-plaintiff. He who asserts, not he who denies,
must prove (Homeowners Savings & Loan Bank v. Dailo, 453
SCRA 283). However, jurisprudence tells us that one who
pleads payment has the burden of proving it; the burden rests
on the defendant to prove payment, rather than on the plaintiff
to prove non-payment (Bognot v. RRI Lending Corp., G.R. No.
180144, September 24, 2014; See also Philippine Commercial
International Bank [now BDO Unibank, Inc.] v. Franco, G.R.
No. 180069, March 5, 2014).
8. In an eminent domain case, the local government
that seeks to expropriate private property has the burden of
proving that the elements for the valid exercise of the right
of eminent domain have been complied with (Jesus is Lord
Christian Foundation, Inc. v. City of Pasig, 466 SCRA 235).
9. In accident insurance cases, the insured’s beneficiary
has the burden of proof in demonstrating that the cause of
death is due to the covered peril. Once that fact is established,
the burden then shifts to the insurer to show any excepted
peril that may have been stipulated by the parties (Vda. de
Gabriel v. Court of Appeals, 264 SCRA 137).
10. The party suing for the attachment of the property
of the adverse party has the burden to justify the attachment
because a general averment will not suffice to support the
issuance of a writ for preliminary attachment. It is necessary
to recite in what particular manner an applicant for the writ of
attachment was defrauded. It is not enough for the complaint

—

65

to ritualistically cite that the defendants are guilty of fraud in
contracting the obligation. Fraud cannot be presumed. Section
1 of Rule 131 instructs that each party must prove his own
affirmative allegations (Allied Banking Corporation v. South
Pacific Sugar Corporation, 543 SCRA 585).
11. In international law, the party who wants to have
a foreign law applied to a dispute or case has the burden of
proving the foreign law. Foreign laws do not prove themselves
in our jurisdiction, and our courts are not authorized to take
judicial notice of them (Del Socorro v. Van Wilsem, G.R. No.
193707, December 10, 2014).
12. In an action for the declaration of the nullity of a
marriage, the burden of proof to show such nullity belongs
to the plaintiff and any doubt should be resolved in favor of
the existence and continuance of the marriage and against
its dissolution and nullity (Republic v. Tobora-Tionglico, G.R.
No. 218630, January 11, 2018).
13. Even the State must prove its affirmative allegations.
If the State alleges that certain lands belong to it, it is not
excused from providing evidence to support its allegations
(Republic v. Noval, G.R. No. 170316, September 18, 2017).

14. Just because one has executed an affidavit of
retraction does not imply that what has been previously said
is false or that the latter is true (Philippine National Bank v.
Gregorio, G.R. No. 194944, September 18, 2017).

Test for determining where burden of proof lies

1. The test for determining where the burden of proof
lies is to ask which party to an action or suit will fail if he
offers no evidence competent to show the facts averred as the
basis for the relief he seeks to obtain. If the defendant has
affirmative defenses, he bears the burden of proof as to those
defenses which he sets up in answer to the plaintiff's cause of
action. Hence, if the defendant sets up the affirmative defense
of prescription, he must prove the date when prescription
began to run (Aznar Brothers Realty Co. v. Aying, 458 SCRA

66

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

496; Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Spouses Royeca, 559
SCRA 207).

2. The burden of proof rests with the party who wants
to establish a legal right in his favor. For instance, one who
asserts a right to a preliminary injunction has the burden to
prove such right. If he claims a right granted by law, he must
prove his claim by competent evidence, relying on the strength
of his own evidence and not upon the weakness of that of his
opponent (China Banking Corp, u Ta Fa Industries, Inc., 553
SCRA 211).
Where burden of proof is fixed

The burden of proof is fixed by the pleadings. The claim
of the plaintiff, which he must prove, is spelled out in his
complaint. The defendant’s defenses, which he must, likewise,
prove, are found in his answer to the complaint. Burden of
proof never shifts during the course of the trial. (Sec. 1, Rule
131, Rules of Court)
For instance, as previously adduced, the burden of proof
to establish that the defendant owes the plaintiff remains with
the plaintiff; the burden of proof to establish that the loan
has been paid remains with the defendant, throughout the
litigation (Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Spouses Royeca,
559 SCRA 207).
Burden of evidence (Bar 2004)

1. Burden of evidence is now defined under Sec. 1, Rule
131 of the Rules of Court, as amended, thus:
“SECTION 1. Burden of proof end burden of
gxltens&. — xxx.

Burden of evidence Is the duty of a party to present
evidence sufficient to establish or rebut a fact In Issue
to establish a Drima facie case. Burden of evidence mav
shift from one party to the other In the course of the
proceedings, depending on the exigencies of the case.”

—

CHAPTER II BURDEN OF PROOF, QUANTUM
OF EVIDENCE AND PRESUMPTIONS
A. Burden of Proof and Burden of Evidence

67

The burden of evidence is the duty of a party to go for¬
ward with the evidence to overthrow the prima facie evidence
against him (Bautista v. Sarmiento, 138 SCRA 587; See also
People v. Court of Appeals, 21st Division, G.R. No. 183652,
February 25, 2015).
As the trial progresses, one party may have presented
evidence that weighs heavily in his favor and sufficient to
convince the court of the justness of his claim. If this occurs,
the other party has the burden to come forward with his own
evidence to counteract whatever positive impression which the
evidence of the other party may have created in the mind of
the court. This duty, also called the burden of coming forward
with the evidence (1 Jones on Evidence, 6th Ed., p. 523), is
what is referred to as burden of evidence.
2. In illegal possession of firearms, the prosecution has
the burden of proving the accused’s lack of authority to have a
firearm. The prosecution having proved that the accused was
not issued a firearms license, the burden of evidence was then
shifted to the accused to prove his authorization to possess a
firearm (People v. Salahuddin, G.R. No. 206291, January 18,
2016).
3. Generally, “the burden lies upon the prosecution to
prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt rather
than upon the accused that he was in fact innocent.” If the
accused, however, admits killing the victim, but pleads self¬
defense, the burden is shifted to him to prove such defense by
clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence that excludes any
vestige of criminal aggression on his part. To escape liability,
it now becomes incumbent upon the accused to prove by clear
and convincing evidence all the elements of that justifying
circumstance (Flores v. People, G.R. No. 181354, February 27,
2013; People v. Cosgafa, G.R. No. 218250, July 10, 2017; See
also People v. Abina, G.R. No. 220146, April 18, 2018). When
the accused invokes self-defense, the burden of proof is shifted
from the prosecution to the defense and it becomes incumbent
upon the accused to prove the elements of self-defense (People
v. Japag, G.R. No. 223155, July 23, 2018).

B. Presumptions

Equipoise rule or equiponderance doctrine (Bar 1995); rule
of “lenity”
1. The equipoise doctrine is based on the principle that
no one shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due
process of law (Sec. 1, Art. HI, 1987 Constitution).
2. The doctrine refers to a situation where the evidence
of the parties is evenly balanced, or there is doubt on which
side the evidence preponderates (or weighs more heavily). In
this case, the decision should be against the party with the
burden of proof.

Hence, in a civil case, where the burden of proof is on
the plaintiff and the evidence does not suggest that the scale
of justice should weigh in his favor, the court should render
a verdict for the defendant (Rivera v. Court of Appeals, 284
SCRA 673; Marubeni Corp. u. Lirag, 362 SCRA 620).

In a criminal case, the equipoise rule provides that
where the evidence is evenly balanced, the constitutional
presumption of innocence tilts the scales in favor of the accused.
Thus, where the inculpatory facts and circumstances are
capable of two or more explanations, one of which is consistent
with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent
with his guilt, then the evidence does not fulfill the test of
moral certainty and is not sufficient to support a conviction
(People v. Satumo, 355 SCRA 578; People v. Ison, G.R. No.
205097, June 8, 2016). In other words, where the evidence
admits of two interpretations, one of which is consistent with
guilt, and the other with innocence, the accused must be given
the benefit of the doubt and should be acquitted (People v.
Rodriguez, G.R. No. 211721, September 20, 2017).
3. The equipoise rule, however, is not applicable where
the evidence presented is not equally weighty, such as where
the evidence of the prosecution is overwhelming (Malana v.
People, 549 SCRA 451).
4. A rule similar to the equipoise rule, but which places
emphasis on the interpretation of a penal statute rather than
on the evidence, is the rule of “lenity.” Under this rule, when

the court is faced with two possible interpretations of a penal
statute, one that is prejudicial to the accused and another
that is favorable to him, the rule calls for the adoption of an
interpretation which is more lenient to the accused (See lent
v. Tullet Prebon [Philippines], Inc., G.R. No. 189158, January
11, 2017).
B. Presumptions
Concept of presumptions

1. A presumption is an assumption of fact resulting
from a rule of law which requires such fact to be assumed from
another fact or group of facts found or otherwise established
in the action (Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., p. 1067, citing
Uniform Rule 13; NJ Evidence Rule 13). A presumption is
an inference of the existence or non-existence of a fact which
courts are permitted to draw from proof of other facts (In the
Matter of the Intestate Estates of Delgado and Rustia, 480
SCRA 334).
2. A presumption is not evidence (California Evidence
Code, cited in Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., p. 1167). They
merely affect the burden of offering evidence (1 Wharton's
Criminal Evidence, Sec. 64; Estate of Honorio Poblador, Jr.
v. Manzano, G.R. No. 192391, June 19, 2017). In a sense,
a presumption is an inference which is mandatory unless
rebutted (29 Am Jur 29, Evidence, §181).

Example: D is the debtor of C, creditor for Pl million
payable in 12 equal monthly installments. If evidence is
introduced that the installment payment for December
has been received by the creditor, a presumption arises
that previous installments have been paid. This is because,
under the law, the receipt of a later installment of a debt,
without reservation as to prior installments, gives rise to
the presumption that such installments have been paid (Art.
1176, Civil Code of the Philippines; Sec. 3[i], Rule 131, Rules
of Court).

70

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

Inference distinguished from a presumption

1. An inference is a factual conclusion that can
rationally be drawn from other facts (29 Am Jur 2d §182 citing
Computer Identics Corp. v. Southern Pacific Co. [CAI Mass]). It
is, in other words, one that is a result of the reasoning process.
It need not have a legal effect because it is not mandated by
law. “The factfinder is free to accept or reject the inference"
(29 Am Jur 2d §182).

A presumption, on the other hand, is a rule of law
directing that if a party proves certain facts (the basic facts) at
a trial or hearing, the factfinder must also accept an additional
fact (the presumed fact) as proven unless sufficient evidence
is introduced tending to rebut the presumed fact. In a sense,
therefore, a presumption is an inference which is mandatory
unless rebutted (29 Am Jur 2d §181).
2. Thus, if X proposes marriage to Y, it may be inferred
that X is in love with Y. This is a mere inference and has in fact
no legal effect. There are no legal relations established by the
mere fact that one is in love. On the other hand, if X enters into
a contract of sale of a car with Y, there arises a presumption
that the contract was entered into with a sufficient cause or
consideration (Sec. 3[r], Rule 131, Rules of Court) and although
the cause is not stated in the contract, it is presumed that it
exists and is lawful, unless the contrary is proven (Art. 1354,
Civil Code of the Philippines). The presumption, involved in
the example, has a definite legal effect.
Kinds of presumptions

Presumptions are classified into presumptions of law and
presumptions of fact. Presumptions of law are, in turn, either
conclusive or disputable (In the Matter of the Intestate Estates
of Delgado and Rustia, 480 SCRA 334).

The presumption that an accused is innocent of the
crime charged until the contrary is proven is a presumption
of law embodied in the Constitution (Sec. 14[2], Art. Ill, 1987
Constitution). Article 1756 of the Civil Code also illustrates
I

71

another presumption mandated by the law. Under the said
provision, in case of death or injuries to passengers, common
carriers are presumed to have been at fault or to have acted
negligently.

A presumption of fact does not arise from any direction of
the law. It arises because reason itself allows a presumption
from the facts. If A attacks B without provocation, the logical
presumption arises that A does not have tender feelings
towards B. A presumption of fact is, in effect, actually a mere
inference because it does not necessarily give rise to a legal

effect.
This must be the reason for the trend to discard the
distinction between a presumption of fact and a presumption
of law (Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., p. 1067).
Effect of presumptions

A party in whose favor the legal presumption exists may
rely on and invoke such legal presumption to establish a fact
in issue. One need not introduce evidence to prove the fact
for a presumption is prima facie proof of the fact presumed
(Diesel Construction Co., Inc. v. UPSI Property Holdings, Inc.,
549 SCRA 12).

In civil cases, a presumption imposes on the party against
whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence
to rebut or meet the presumption. If presumptions are
inconsistent, the presumption that is founded upon weightier
considerations of policy shall apply. If considerations of policy
are of equal weight, neither presumption applies (Sec. 5, Rule
131, Rules of Court).
It is necessary to examine the basis for each presumption
and determine what logical or social basis exists for each
presumption, and then determine which should be regarded
as the more important and entitled to prevail of the other.
Thus, between the presumption that a young Filipina will not
charge a person with rape if it is not true, and the presumption
of innocence, the latter should prevail because it is founded

72

(The Bar Lectures Series)

upon the first principles of justice, and is not a mere form but
a substantial part of the law (People v. Godoy, 250 SCRA 676).

In criminal cases, if a presumed fact that establishes guilt
is an element of the offense charged, or negates a defense, the
existence of the basic fact must be proved beyond reasonable
doubt and the presumed fact follows from the basic fact beyond
reasonable doubt (Sec. 6, Rule 131, Rules of Court).

73

When evidence thatrebuts the presumption is introduced,
the force of the presumption disappears.
Example: While evidence of receipt of payment of a
later installment gives rise to the presumption that previous
installments have been paid, yet when evidence is shown that

prior installments remain unpaid, the presumption falls.

Meaning of conclusive presumptions (Bar 2012)

Conclusive presumptions under the Rules of Court (Bar
2012)

1. As classified in Rule 131 of the Rules of Court, a
presumption may either be:

1. The following are the conclusive presumptions under
Sec. 2, Rule 131 o^ the Rules of Court, as amended:

(a) conclusive (presumptions juris et de jure); or

(b) disputable (presumptions juris tantum).

2. A presumption is conclusive when the presumption
becomes irrebuttable upon the presentation of the evidence
and any evidence tending to rebut the presumption is not
admissible.
Thus, the Supreme Court taught that conclusive
presumptions are “inferences which the law makes so
peremptory that it will not allow them to be overturned by
any contrary proof however strong” (Datalift Movers, Inc. v.
Belgravia Realty & Development Corp., 500 SCRA 1 63).

“A conclusive or irrebuttable presumption is not a
presumption at all; it is a substantive rule of law directing that
proof of certain basic facts conclusively proves an additional
fact which cannot be rebutted. Such presumption rests upon
grounds of expediency or public policy so compelling in
character as to override the requirement of proof’ (29 Am Jur
2d, Evidence, §184: Citations omitted).
3. A presumption is disputable or rebuttable if it may
be contradicted or overcome by other evidence (Sec. 3, Rule
131, Rules of Court). In the language of Sec. 3 of Rule 131,
disputable presumptions “are satisfactory, if uncontradicted,
but may be contradicted and overcome by other evidence.”

"SEC. 2. Conclusive presumptions. — x x x
(a) Whenever a party has, by his or her own
declaration, act, or omission, intentionally ordeliberately
led another to believe a particular thing is true, and to
act upon such belief, he or she cannot, in any litigation
arising out of such declaration, act or omission, be
permitted to falsify it.
(b) The tenant Is not permitted to deny the title of
his or tier landlord at the time of the commencement of
the relation of landlord and tenant between them.”

2. The conclusive presumptions under the Rules
of Court are based on the doctrine of estoppel. Under this
doctrine, the person making the representation cannot claim
benefit from the wrong he himself committed (Phil. Pryce
Assurance Corp. v. Court of Appeals, 230 SCRA 164).
3. The first conclusive presumption is often referred to
as estoppel in pais or estoppel by conduct.

Estoppel

1.

Under the doctrine of estoppel, an admission or

representation is rendered conclusive upon the person making
it, and cannot be denied or disproved as against the person
relying thereon (Spouses Manzanillo v. Waterfields Industries
Corp., G.R. No. 177484, July 18, 2014).

74

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

Example: Persons who assume to be a corporation without
legal authority to act as such shall be considered a corporation
by estoppel and shall be liable as general partners (Sec. 20,
Revised Corporation Code of the Philippines).

2. Under Art. 1431 of the Civil Code, through estoppel,
an admission or representation is rendered conclusive upon
the person making it, and cannot be denied or disproved
as against the person relying on it. Where a party, by his
deed or conduct, has induced another to act in a particular
manner, estoppel effectively bars the former from adopting an
inconsistent position, attitude or course of conduct that causes
loss or injury to the latter. The doctrine of estoppel is based
upon the grounds of public policy, fair dealing, good faith and
justice, and its purpose is to forbid one to speak against his
own act, representations, or commitments, to the injury of
one to whom they were directed and who reasonably relied
thereon (Harold v. Aliba, 534 SCRA 478).
3. “Because of the conclusive presumption under
Section 2(b) of Rule 131, the Rules of Court sufficiently shields
the lessor from being questioned by the lessee, regarding its
title or better right of possession as lessor because having
admitted the existence of a lessor-lessee relationship, the
lessee is barred from assailing the lessor’s title of better right
of possession x x x As long as the lessor-lessee relationship
between the parties exists, the lessee cannot, by any proof,
however strong, overturn the conclusive presumption that the
lessor has valid title to or better right of possession to the
subject leased premises than it has" (Datalift Movers, Inc. v.
Belgravia Realty & Development Corp., 500 SCRA 163). (Bar
2012)

Effect of disputable presumptions

The effect of a presumption upon the burden of proof is to
create the need of presenting evidence to overcome the prima
fade case created by the presumption. If no contrary proof is
offered, the presumption will prevail (Diaz v. People, G.R. No.
208113, December 2, 2015).

B. Presumptions

Disputable presumptions under the Rules of Court
1. A significant example of a disputable presumption
under the Rules of Court is the presumption that “official duty
has been regularly performed” (Sec. 3fm], Rule 131, Rules of
Court). (Bar 2012)

Every government officer or employee is entitled to
the presumption that he or she has regularly performed
his official duty. Hence, a data entry clerk of a government
office is presumed to have regularly and faithfully made the
required entries of office transactions in a regular manner. A
cabinet member, authorized to sign government contracts is,
likewise, presumed to have signed the contract in accordance
with existing government laws, rules and regulations.

This presumption of regularity includes matters related
to court proceedings. In the service of summons, the process
server is presumed to have served the summons in a regular
manner. It is, therefore, incumbent upon the party questioning
the validity of the service to rebut these presumptions with
competent and proper evidence. The return is prima facie proof
of the facts indicated therein (Masagana Concrete Products v.
NLRC, G.R. No. 106916, September 3, 1999).
A later case simplified the rule on how to overturn the
presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty,
thus: “The presumption can be overturned if evidence is
presented to prove either of two things, namely: (1) that the
officers were not properly performing their duty; or (2) that
they were inspired by any improper motive (People v. Barte,
G.R. No. 179749, March 1, 2017). Hence, unless there is clear
and convincing evidence that the police officers were inspired
by any improper motive or did not properly perform their
duty, their testimonies on the police operations deserve full
faith and credit (See People v. Cabiles, G.R. No. 220758, June
7, 2017).

2. The presumption cannot work if the records reveal
severe lapses in complying with the requirements provided for
under the law (People v. Segundo, G.R. No. 205614, July 26,
2017).

CHAPTER n - BURDEN OF PROOF, QUANTUM
OF EVIDENCE AND PRESUMPTIONS
B. Presumptions

(The Bar Lectures Series)

For example, reliance on the presumption of regularity in
the performance of official duties on the part of arresting officers
in the prosecution of drug-related offenses is unwarranted if
the records show that there is an unjustified non-compliance
with the affirmative safeguards prescribed by law to preserve
the chain of custody of the seized drugs. The presumption
applies only when there is no showing of non-compliance (See
Casona u People, G.R. No. 179757, September 13, 2017). This
means that if it is established that the law enforcement officers
failed to comply with the specific procedures to establish the
chain of custody in the handling and seizure of drugs and
the prosecution, likewise, failed to offer a justification for
such non-compliance, the presumption of regularity in the
performance of an official duty will not apply (People v. Asjali,
G.R No. 216430, September 3, 2018). Judicial reliance on
the presumption of regularity in the performance of official
duty despite the lapses in the procedures undertaken by the
agents of the law is fundamentally flawed because the lapses
themselves are affirmative proofs of irregularity (People v.
Sipin, G.R No. 224290, June 11, 2018).
Presumption of regularity cannot overcome presumption of
innocence

I. It must also be emphasized that the presumption
of regularity in the performance of official functions cannot,
by itself, overcome the presumption of innocence. Evidence of
guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and nothing else, is required
to erase all doubts as to the culpability of the accused (Zafra
v. People, 671 SCRA 396, 405, April 25, 2012). Hence, in
case of conflict between the presumption of regularity in the
performance of duty of police officers and the presumption of
innocence of the accused, the latter must prevail as the law
imposes upon the prosecution the highest degree of proof of
evidence to sustain conviction (People v. Guinto, G.R. No.
198314, September 24, 2014). The reason is obvious, “x x x
[I]t would be unconstitutional to place a higher value in the
presumption of regularity in the performance of official duties
—a mere tool of evidence—than in the more substantial

77

—

presumption of innocence favoring x x x an accused a right
enshrined in the Bill of Rights” (Casona v. People, G.R. No.
179757, September 13, 2017).
2. Stated another way, the presumption of regularity
in the performance of official duty does not constitute
proof beyond reasonable doubt. It should be noted that the
presumption is precisely just that a presumption. Once
challenged by evidence^ it cannot be regarded as binding
truth (People v. Caranto, G.R. No. 193768, March 5, 2014).
Hence, reliance on the legal presumption of regularity in
the performance of official duty is inadequate to uphold a
conviction. After all, the burden of proving the guilt of the
accused rests on the prosecution which must rely on the
strength of its own evidence and not on the weakness of the
defense (People u. Enad, G.R. No. 205764, February 3, 2016;
See also People v. Sagana, G.R. No. 208471, August 2, 2017).
Because regularity in the performance of duty is
not sufficient for conviction, the Court, in a subsequent
pronouncement, had the occasion to caution trial courts from
judicially pronouncing an accused as guilty just because he
could not impute any ill motive to arresting officers in arresting
him and from presuming the regularity of the arrest on that
basis alone (Casona v. People, G.R. No. 179757, September 13,

—

2017).

Presumption of regularity in a petition for Writ of Amparo

The presumption of regularity does not apply in a petition
for a Writ of Amparo. Under Sec. 17 of the Rule on the Writ
of Amparo, the “respondent public official or employee cannot
invoke the presumption that official duty has been regularly
performed to evade responsibility or liability.”
Presumption of regularity in custodial investigation

The presumption of regularity of official acts does not
apply during in-custody investigation. It is incumbent upon the
prosecution to prove during the trial that prior to questioning,
the confessant was warned of his constitutionally-protected

EVIDENCE

rights. Trial courts should further keep in mind that even if
the confession of the accused is gospel truth, if it was made

without the assistance of counsel, it is inadmissible in evidence
regardless of the absence of coercion or even if it had been
voluntarily given (People v. Camat, G.R. No. 112262, April 2,
1996).
Examples of disputable presumptions (Bar 2011, 2012)

1. Some significant disputable presumptions under
Sec. 3 of Rule 131 are:
(a) That a person is innocent of a crime or wrong;

(b) That an unlawful act was done with unlawfill
intent;

(c) That a person intendsthe ordinary consequences
of his or her voluntary act; (Bar 2012)
(d) That a person takes ordinary care of his or her
business;
(e) That evidence willfully suppressed would be
adverse if produced;
(f) That money paid by one to another was due to
the latter;
(g) That a thing delivered by one to another
belonged to the latter;
(h) That an obligation delivered up to the debtor
has been paid;
(i) That prior rents or installments had been paid
when a receipt for the later ones is produced;
(j) That a person acting in a public office was
regularly appointed or elected to it;
(k) That official duty has been regularly performed;
(Bar 2012)

(1) That a court, or judge acting as such, whether
in the Philippines or elsewhere, was acting in the lawful
exercise of jurisdiction.

B. Presumptions

Note: Please refer to other disputable presumptions in
Sec. 3 of Rule 131.
2. One of the most significant presumptions, which is,
at the same time, a constitutional right (Sec. 14[2], Art. HI,
1987 Constitution), is the right to be presumed innocent of a
crime or wrong.
3. The constitutional presumption of innocence is
enjoyed by the accused until final conviction and, in this
regard, the prosecution’s case must rise and fall on its own
merits and cannot draw its strength from the weakness of the
defense (People v. Mingming, 573 SCRA 509). The evidence
of the prosecution must stand on its own strength and not
rely on the weakness of the defense (People v. Bontuyan, G.R.
No. 206912, September 10, 2014; People u. Sagana, G.R. No.
208471, August 2, 2017).
4. The presumption that evidence, when willfully
suppressed, would be adverse, if produced, does not apply
if (a) the evidence is at the disposal of both parties; (b) the
suppression was not willful; (c) it is merely corroborative
or cumulative; and (d) the suppression is covered by the
privileged communication between physician and patient
(Blue Cross Health Care, Inc. v. Olivares, 544 SCRA 580).

5. Generally, a notarized document carries the
evidentiary weight conferred upon it with respect to its due
execution, and documents acknowledged before a notary public
have in their favor the presumption of regularity which may
only be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence (Rural Bank
of Cabadbaran, Inc. u. Melecio-Yap, G.R. No. 178451, July 30,
2014; See also Tan v. Hosana, G.R. No. 190846, February 3,
2016; See also Today u. Apoya, Jr., A.C. No. 11981, July 3,
2018).
6. The settled rule is that, in the absence of satisfactory
explanation, one found in possession of and who used a forged
document is the forger and therefore, guilty of falsification.
If a person had in his possession a falsified document and he
made use of it (uttered it), taking advantage of it and profiting

qq

81

B. Presumptions

thereby, the clear presumption is that he is the material
author of the falsification (Maliwat v. Court of Appeals, 256

SCRA 718).
The presumption, that whoever possesses or uses a
spurious document is its forger, applies only in the absence
of a satisfactory explanation (Metrobank v. Tobias III, 664
SCRA 165, 179-180, January 25, 2012). Hence, a satisfactory
explanation would render the presumption ineffective.

7. A judgment or final order against a person, rendered
by a tribunal of a foreign country with jurisdiction to render
said judgment or final order, is presumptive evidence of a
right as between the parties and their successors-in-interest.
If the judgment or final order is upon a specific thing, said
judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the
thing. The presumptions are not, however, irrefutable. In
either case, the judgment or final order may be repelled by
any of the following: (a) want of jurisdiction; (b) want of notice
to the party; (c) collusion; (d) fraud; or (e) clear mistake of law
or fact (Sec. 48, Rule 39, Rules of Court).
8. While the judgment or final order rendered by a
Philippine court, among others, with respect to the probate of
a will or the administration of the estate of a deceased person
is conclusive upon the will or administration, the probate of a
will or granting letters of administration shall only be prima
facie evidence of the death of the testator (Sec. 47, Rule 39,
Rules of Court).

9. The persons mentioned in Art. 2180 of the Civil Code
like employers, and owners or managers of establishment,
among others, are liable for the acts of those persons for
whom they are responsible. Under the same provision, such
responsibility shall cease when the persons mentioned prove
that they observed all the diligence of a good father of a family
to prevent damage. This indicates that there is a presumption
that employers and other persons in Art. 2180 have, likewise,
been negligent in case those under them have caused damage
to another.

I

Whenever an employee’s negligence causes damage or
injury to another, there instantly arises a presumption juris
tantum that the employer failed to exercise diligentissimi
patris familias in the selection (culpa eligiendo) or supervision
(culpa in vigilando) of its employees (Macalinao v. Ong, 477
SCRA 740).
10. It is disputably presumed that a driver was negligent,
if he had been found guilty of reckless driving or violating
traffic regulations at least twice within the next preceding two
months (Art. 2184, Civil Code of the Philippines).
11. There is prima facie presumption of negligence on
part
of the defendant if the death or injury results from
the
his possession of dangerous weapons or substances, such
as firearms and poison, except when the possession or use
thereof is indispensable in his occupation or business (Art.
2188, ibid.).

12. In some cases where negligence is difficult to
prove, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur permits an inference
of negligence on the part of the defendant where the thing
or transaction speaks for itself (Josefa v. Manila Electric
Company, G.R. No. 182705, July 18, 2014). The doctrine of res
ipsa loquitur establishes a presumption of negligence against
the defendant and furnishes a substitute for a specific proof
of negligence. The doctrine can be invoked only when, under

the circumstances, direct evidence is absent and not readily
available. For the doctrine to apply, the following must be
satisfactorily shown:
(a) The accident is of a kind which ordinarily does
not occur in the absence of someone’s negligence;
(b) It is caused by an instrumentality within the
exclusive control of the defendant or defendants; and
(c) The possibility of contributing conduct which
would make the plaintiff responsible is eliminated
(Ramos v. Court of Appeals, 321 SCRA 584; Macalinao
v. Ong, 477 SCRA 740; See Solidum v. People, G.R. No.
192123, March 10, 2014).

82

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

CHAPTER n

13. The legal presumption is that a person takes ordinary
care of his concerns. To this, case law dictates that the natural
presumption is that one does not sign a document without
first informing himself of its contents and consequences (Diaz
v. People, G.R No. 208113, December 2, 2015; Encarnacion
Construction & Industrial Corp. v. Phoenix Ready Mix
Concrete Development & Construction Corp., G.R. No. 225402,
September 4, 2017).
14. The presumption that a person found in possession of
the personal effects belonging to the person robbed and killed
is considered the author of the aggression, the death of the
person, as well as the robbery committed applies where such
possession is unexplained or when the proffered explanation
is inconsistent with the evidence (See People v. Donio, G.R.
No. 212815, March 1, 2017).
C. Quantum of Evidence (Weight and
Sufficiency of Evidence)

Proof beyond reasonable doubt
1. In criminal cases, the burden of proof as to the
guilt of the accused lies with the prosecution because of the
presumption that the accused is presumed innocent until the
contrary is proven (Sec. 14(2], Art. HI, 1987 Constitution).
Jurisprudence reiterates the above rule by declaring
that, “[I]n every criminal prosecution, the State must prove
beyond reasonable doubt, all the elements of the crime charged
and the complicity or participation of the accused” (People v.
Maraorao, 674 SCRA 151, 159, June 20, 2012; See also People
v. Roxas, G.R. No. 218396, February 10, 2016).
Jurisprudence clearly instructs: “Requiring proof beyond
reasonable doubt necessarily means that mere suspicion of the
guilt of the accused, no matter how strong, should not sway
judgment against him. It further means that the court should
duly consider every evidence favoring him, and that, in the
process, the courts should persistently insist that accusation
is not synonymous with guilt; every circumstance favoring his

—

OF EVIDENCE AND PRESUMPTIONS
C. Quantum of Evidence (Weight and Sufficiency of Evidence)

83

innocence should be fully taken into account” (People v. Claro,
G.R. No. 199894, April 5, 2017).

2. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean such
degree of proof, excluding possibility of error. It is the degree
of proof that, after investigation of the whole record, produces
moral certainty in an unprejudiced mind of the accused’s
culpability (Atienza v. People, G.R. No. 188694, February
12, 2014; People v. Gerola, G.R. No. 217973, July 19, 2017;
See also Typoco, Jr. u. People, G.R. No. 221857, August 16,
201 7). In other words, the conscience must be satisfied that
the accused is responsible for the offense charged (People v.
Rodriguez, G.R. No. 211721, September 20, 2017).
“Reasonable doubt does not refer to any doubt or a mere
possible doubt because everything in human experience is
subject to possible doubt. Rather, it is the state of the case
which, after a comparison of all the evidence, does not lead
the judge to have in mind a moral certainty of the truth of
the charge. When there is reasonable doubt as to the guilt of
the accused, there must be an acquittal” (People v. Rodriguez,
G.R. No. 211721, September 20, 2017).
Section 2 of Rule 133 provides for the quantum of evidence
required in criminal cases as follows:
"SEC. 2. Proof beyond reasonable doubt. — In a
criminal case, the accused Is entitled to an acquittal,
unless his or her guilt is shown beyond reasonable
doubt. Proof beyond reasonable doubt does not mean
such a degree of proof as, excluding possibility of
error, produces absolute certainty. Moral certainty only
is required, or that degree of proof which produces
conviction in an unprejudiced mind.”

3. The presumption of innocence of an accused in a
criminal case is a basic constitutional principle fleshed out by
procedural rules which place on the prosecution the burden
of proving that the accused is guilty of the offense charged
by proof beyond reasonable doubt. Corollary thereto, the
evidence of the prosecution must stand on its own strength
and not rely on the weakness of the evidence of the defense

84

EVIDENCE

(The Bar Lectures Series)

(People v. Bontuyan, G.R. No. 206912, September 10, 2014;
Saraum v. People, G.R. No. 205472, January 25, 2016; See
also Franco v. People, G.R. No. 191185, February 1, 2016;
People u. Cadenas, G.R. No. 233199, November 5, 2018).
Stated in another way, the conviction of the accused must rest
not on the weakness of the defense but on the strength of the
prosecution (People v. Rodriguez, G.R. No. 211721, September
20, 2017). The argument, therefore, that the accused deserves
to be convicted because he failed to prove his innocence is
not only procedurally unsound but also totally bereft of a
constitutional basis.

The overriding consideration in criminal cases is not
whether the court doubts the innocence of the accused but
whether it entertains a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. When
there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, he
must be acquitted even though his innocence may be doubted
since the constitutional right to be presumed innocent
until proven guilty can only be overthrown by proof beyond
reasonable doubt (See People u. Rodriguez, G.R. No. 211721,
September 20, 2017).
4. Because an accused can be convicted only when his
guilt is proven beyond reasonable doubt, the Court, sitting as
an appellate court, is mandated to sift the records and search
for every error, though unassigned in the appeal, in order to
ensure that the conviction is warranted, and to correct every
error that the lower court has committed in finding guilt
against the accused (People v. Barte, G.R. No. 179749, March
1,2017).

Preponderance of evidence (Bar 2003, 2011)
1. Section 1 of Rule 133, as amended, provides:
“SECTION 1. Preponderance of evidence; how
determined. — In civil cases, the party having the
burden of proof must establish his or her case by a
preponderance of evidence. In determining where the
preponderance or superior weight of evidence on the
issues Involved Iles, the court may consider all the facts

85

and circumstances of the case, the witnesses' manner of
testifying, thelrintelligence.theirmeans and opportunity
of knowing the facts to which they are testifying, the
nature of the facts to which they testify, the probability
or improbability of their testimony, their interest or
want of interest, and also their personal credibility so
far as the same may legitimately appear upon the trial.
The court may also consider the number of witnesses,
though the preponderance is not necessarily with the
greater number.”

2. In civil cases, the party having the burden of proof
must establish his case by a preponderance of evidence.

Preponderance of evidence is the weight, credit, and value
of the aggregate evidence on either side and is usually
considered to be synonymous with the term “greater weight
of the evidence” or “greater weight of the credible evidence."
Preponderance of evidence is a phrase which, in the last
analysis, means probability of truth. It is evidence which is
more convincing to the court as worthier of belief than that
which is offered in opposition thereto (Chua u. Westmont Bank,
667 SCRA 56, 68, February 27, 2012; BJDC Construction v.
Lanuzo, G.R. No. 161151, March 24, 2014; See also Standard
Insurance Co., Inc. v. Cuaresma, G.R. No. 200055, September
10, 2014; Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Mendoza, G.R. No.
198799, March 20, 2017).
3. In determining whether or not there is preponder¬
ance of evidence, the court may consider the following:
(a) all the facts and circumstances of the case;
(b) the witnesses' manner of testifying, their
intelligence, their means and opportunity of knowing the
facts to which they are testifying, the nature of the facts
to which they testify, the probability or improbability of
their testimony;
(c) the witnesses’ interest or want of interest, and
also their personal credibility so far as the same may
ultimately appear in the trial;

EVIDENCE

(The Bar Lectures Series)

(d) the number of witnesses, although it does mean
that the preponderance is necessarily with the greater
number (Sec. 1, Rule 133, Rules of Court).

Substantial evidence (Bar 2003, 2011)
1. The pertinent rule on substantial evidence is found
in Sec. 6 of Rule 133, as amended. The relevant provision

declares:

—

“SEC. 6. Substantial evidence.
In cases filed
before administrative or quasi -judicial bodies, a fact may
be deemed established If it is supported by substantial
evidence, or that amount of relevant evidence which a
reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a
conclusion."

2. Substantial evidence refers to such relevant evidence
which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support
a conclusion (Fajardo v. Corral, G.R. No. 212641, July 5,
201 7). It is more than a mere imputation of wrongdoing or
violation that would warrant a finding of liability against the
person charged (Mamba v. Bueno, G.R. No. 191416, February
7,2017).

In administrative cases, the quantum of evidence
required is that of substantial evidence. It does not require
evidence that is overwhelming or even preponderant (Astorga
and Repol Law Offices v. Villanueva, A.M. No. P-09-2669,
February 24, 2015; See also Asian International Manpower
Services, Inc. v. Department of Labor and Employment,
G.R. No. 210308, April 6, 2016; See Ignacio v. Alviar, A.C.
No. 11482, July 17, 2017). Further, the complainant has the
burden of proving by substantial evidence the allegations in
his complaint. The basic rule is that allegation is not evidence
and is not equivalent to proof. Likewise, charges based on
mere suspicion and speculation cannot be given credence
(Rico v. Salutan, AC. No. 9257, March 5, 2018).
3. In administrative or quasi-judicial proceedings,
like those conducted before the NLRC, the standard of proof

87

is substantial evidence which is understood to be more than
just a scintilla or such amount of relevant evidence which
a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a
conclusion (Morales v. Harbour CentrePort Terminal, Inc., 664
SCRA 110, 121, January 25, 2012; See also Republic v. Arias,
G.R. No. 188909, September 17, 2014). In labor cases, as in
other administrative and other quasi-judicial proceedings, the
quantum of proof necessary is substantial evidence (Valencia
v. Classique Vinyl Products Corporation, G.R. No. 206390,
January 30, 2017).

In claims for workmen’s compensation, for example,
the degree of proof required is merely substantial evidence.
This means that it suffices that the claims be based on mere
probability, not certainty of causal relations (Leviste v. Social
Security System, 539 SCRA 120). However, the employee has
the burden to present substantial evidence or such relevant
evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to
justify a conclusion, showing a reasonable connection between
the conditions of his work and his illness, or that the risk of
contracting the same was increased by his working conditions
(Masangcay v. Trans-Global Maritime Agency, Inc., 569 SCRA
592).
In agrarian cases, all that is required is mere substantial
evidence (Heirs of E.B. Roxas, Inc. u. Tolentino, 167 SCRA
334).
4. The Court has used different standards in
disbarment proceedings. One case, for instance, held that
in disbarment proceedings, the burden of proof rests on the
complainant to establish respondent attorney’s liability by
clear, convincing and satisfactory evidence (Chu v. Guico, A.C.
No. 10573, January 13, 2015). In another case, the Court held
that: “In administrative cases against lawyers, the quantum
of proof required is preponderance of evidence which the
complainant has the burden to discharge x x x” (HDI Holdings
Philippines, Inc. u. Cruz, A.C. No. 11724, July 31, 2018).
Another decision of the Court, reiterating Reyes u. Nieva, A.C.
No. 8560, September 6, 2016, ruled that “this Court had the
occasion to clarify that the proper evidentiary threshold in

88

EVIDENCE

(The Bar Lectures Series)

disbarment cases is substantial evidence (Arsenio v. Tabuzo,
A.C. No. 8658, April 24, 2017). In Tan v. Alvarico (A.C. No.
10933, November 3, 2020), the court once again stressed that
its pronouncement in Reyes v. Nieva ought to control and quell
any further confusion on the proper evidentiary threshold.
It recognized that the evidentiary threshold of substantial
evidence, as opposed to preponderance of evidence, is more
in keeping with the primordial purpose of and essential
considerations attending disciplinary cases.
Quantum of evidence in a petition for a Writ of Amparo

In a petition for a writ of amparo, the parties shall
establish their claims by substantial evidence (Sec. 17, The
Rule on the Writ of Amparo, effective October 24, 2007; Mamba
v. Bueno, G.R. No. 191416, February 7, 2017; Republic u.
Cayanan, G.R. No. 181796, November 7, 2017).
Effect on the criminal case of the decision in the administra¬
tive case and Wee versa
1. In Paredes u. Court of Appeals, 528 SCRA 577, the
accused argued that as his liability in the administrative case
against him was not established by substantial evidence, so
will his criminal case necessarily fall, demanding as it does, a
heavier quantum of proof, i.e., proof beyond reasonable doubt.
To this argument the Supreme Court declared:
"The petition must fail.

x x x It is indeed a fundamental principle . . . that
administrative cases are independent from criminal
actions for the same act or omission. Thus, an absolution
from a criminal charge is not a bar to an administrative
prosecution, or vice versa. One thing is administrative
liability, quite another thing is the criminal liability for
the same act.
XXX

Criminal and administrative proceedings may
involve similar operative facts; but each requires a
different quantum of evidence.
i

CHAPTER II— BURDEN OF PROOF, QUANTUM
OF EVIDENCE AND PRESUMPTIONS
C. Quantum of Evidence (Weight and Sufficiency of Evidence)

89

XXX

Thus considering the difference in the quantum
of evidence, as well as the procedure followed and the
sanctions imposed in criminal and administrative
proceedings, the findings and conclusions in one should
not necessarily be binding on the other. Notably, the
evidence presented in the administrative case may not
necessarily be the same evidence to be presented in the
criminal cases. The prosecution is certainly not precluded
from, adducing additional evidence to discharge the
burden of proof required in the criminal cases.
XXX

Conversely [th]e [Court] ha[s] also ruled that
the dismissal of the criminal case is not per se a bar to
administrative sanctions
To paraphrase, dismissal of
the criminal case does not foreclose administrative action
involving the same facts" (Paredes v. Court of Appeals,
528 SCRA 577).

...

2. The Court, likewise, had the occasion to rule, in a
case of more recent vintage, that “[A] x x x finding of guilt
in a criminal case will not necessarily result in a finding of
liability in the administrative case. Conversely, the acquittal
does not necessarily exculpate one administratively” (Arsenio
v. Tabuzo, A.C. No. 8658, April 24, 2017).

Clear and convincing evidence (Bar 2011)

1. Evidence is clear and convincing if it produces
in the mind of the trier of fact a firm belief or conviction as
to allegations sought to be established. It is intermediate,
being more than preponderance, but not to the extent of
such certainty as is required beyond reasonable doubt as in
criminal cases (Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., p. 227).
2. The Court, in Government of Hongkong Special
Administrative Region v. Olalia, Jr., 521 SCRA 470, explained
this quantum of evidence, thus:

cases nor the standard of proof of preponderance of
evidence in civil cases. While administrative in character,
the standardofsubstan tial evidence usedin administrative
cases cannot likewise apply given the object of extradition
law which is to prevent the prospective extraditee from
fleeing [Philippine] jurisdiction. In his separate opinion
in Purganan, then Associate Justice, now Chief Justice
Reynato S. Puno, proposed that a new standard which he
termed ‘clear and convincing evidence’ should be used in
granting bail in extradition cases. According to him, this
standard should be lower than proof beyond reasonable
doubt but higher than preponderance of evidence. The
potential extraditee must prove by ‘clear and convincing
evidence' that he is not a flight risk and will abide with all
the orders and processes of the extradition court.”

3. In criminal cases, the accused bears the burden
to prove by clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence the
justifying circumstance that would avoid his criminal liability
(People v. Fontariilla, 664 SCRA 150, 158, January 25, 2012).
4. In Tankeh v. Development Bank of the Philippines,
720 Phil. 641, the Court ruled that “when fraud is alleged
in an ordinary civil case involving contractual relations, an
entirely different standard of proof needs to be satisfied. The
imputation of fraud in a civil case requires the presentation
of clear and convincing evidence. Mere allegations will not
suffice to sustain the existence of fraud.”
5. In Tan-Andal v. Andal (G.R. No. 196359, May 11,
2021), the Court held that in cases for declaration of nullity
of marriage, “the plaintiff-spouse must prove his or her case
with clear and convincing evidence. This is a quantum of proof
that requires more than preponderant evidence but less than
proof beyond reasonable doubt.”
Evidentiary weight of electronic evidence

1. In assessing the evidentiary weight of electronic
evidence, certain factors may be considered, like:
(a) The reliability of the manner in which it was
generated, stored or communicated;

—

OF EVIDENCE AND PRESUMPTIONS

(b) The reliability of the manner in which its
originator was identified;

(c) The integrity of the information and communi¬
cation system;
(d) The familiarity of the witness or the person who
made the entry with the communication and information
system;
(e) The nature and quality of the information which
went into the communication and information system;
and
(f) Other factors which the court may consider.
(Sec. 1, Rule 7, Rules on Electronic Evidence).
2. All matters relating to the admissibility and
evidentiary weight of an electronic document may be
established by an affidavit stating facts of direct personal
knowledge of the affiant or based on authentic records. The
affidavit must affirmatively show the competence of the
affiant to testify on the matters contained therein (Sec. 1, Rule
9, ibid.).
The affiant shall be made to affirm the contents of the
affidavit in open court and may be cross-examined as a matter
of right by the adverse party (Sec. 2, Rule 9, ibid.).

JUDICIAL NOTICE AND JUDICIAL
ADMISSIONS
.
A. Judicial Notice
1. The relevant provisions on judicial notice under
Rule 129, as amended, provides:
"SECTION 1. Judicial notice, when mandatory. — A
court shall take judicial notice, without the introduction
of evidence, of the existence and territorial extent of
states, their political history, forms of government and
symbols of nationality, the law of nations, the admiralty
and maritime courts of the world and their seals, the
political constitution and history of the Philippines,
official acts of the legislative, executive and judicial
departments of the National Government of the
Philippines, the laws of nature, the measure of time, and
the geographical divisions.
SEC. 2. Judicial notice, when discretionary. — A
court may take judicial notice of matters which are of
public knowledge, or are capable of unquestionable
demonstration, or ought to be known to judges because
of their judicial functions.

2. There are matters in a litigation which must be
admitted without need for evidence. For example, when the
complainant in a criminal case alleges that he was assaulted
by the accused in Quezon City, it would be ridiculous to
require the prosecution to prove that a place called Quezon
City exists. Also, if the accused is charged with the violation
of a statute, there is no need to introduce evidence that said
statute exists because the court is charged with knowledge of
the law, it being the product of an official act of the legislative^
department of the Philippines.
There is, likewise, no need to adduce evidence to prove
that there are 24 hours in a day or that the sun rises in the east
and sets in the west. The fact that Cebu lies in the Visayan
region needs no further evidence. To require evidence for such
obvious facts would be totally absurd. Now, all these matters
which the court may take cognizance of without evidence are
called matters of “judicial notice.”
3. Judicial notice is based on the maxim, “what is
known need not be proved”; hence, when the rule is invoked,
the court may dispense with the presentation of evidence on
judicially-cognizable facts (Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on
Evidence, p. 277 cited in Jones, The Law on Evidence in Civil
Cases, Volume I, 3rd Ed.).
4.

The taking of judicial notice is

ajmatter of expediency^/

and[ convenience ]for it fulfills the purpose that the evidence

is intended to achieve, and in this sense, it is equivalent to
proof (Land Bank of the Philippines v. Yatco Agricultural
Enterprises, G.R. No. 172551, January 15, 2014).

—

SEC. 3. Judicial notice, when hearing necessary.
During the pre-trial and the trial, the court, motu proo/io
or upon motion, shall hear the parties on the propriety
of taking judicial notice of any matter.

Before Judgment or on appeal, the court, motu

oroorto or upon motion, may take judicial notice of any

matter and shall hear the parties thereon if such matter
is decisive of a material issue In the case.”
92

Function of judicial notice

Judicial notice takes the place of proof and is of equal
force. It displaces evidence "Slid fulfills the purpose for which
the evidence is designed to fulfill. Hence, it makes evidence
unnecessary (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court,
1980, p. 38 citing Alzua v. Johnson, 21 Phil. 308). When
the court takes judicial notice of a matter, the court accepts
and recognizes the same without necessity of formal proof.

94

— JUDICIALA. NOTICE AND JUDICIAL ADMISSIONS

Judicial Notice

Evidence shall be dispensed with because the matter is so well
known and is of common knowledge not to be disputable.
When Judicial notice Is mandatory
1. A matter of judicial notice may either be mandatory
(Sec. 1, Rule 129, Rules of Court) or discretionary (Sec. 2,
ibid.). When the matter is subject to^n adator^ judicial
notice, no motion or hearing is necessary for the court to take
judiriaTnotice of such matter because it is what it says it is
“mandatory.”

—

2. The following are matters subject to mandatory
judicial notice:
(a) existence and territorial extent of states;

(b) political history, forms of government and
symbols of nationality of states;
(c) law of nations;

(d) admiralty and maritime courts of the world and
their seals;
(e) political constitution and history of the
Philippines;
(f) official acts of the legislative, executive and
judicial departments of the National Government of the
Philippines;
(g) laws of nature;

(h) measure of time; and
(i) geographical divisions.

3. It would be error for a court not to take judicial
notice of an amendment to the Rules of Court. In a case, the
Supreme Court declared that even if petitioners did not raise
or allege the amendment of the Rules of Court in their motion
for reconsideration before it, the Court of Appeals should
have taken mandatory judicial notice of the Supreme Court’s
resolution in A.M. No. 00-02-03-SC amending Sec. 4 of Rule

66, effective September 1, 2000. Under Sec. 1 of Rule 129, a
court shall take judicial notice, among others, of the official
acts not only of the legislative and executive departments but
also of the judicial department (Siena Realty Corp. v. Gallang, 428 SCRA 422).

It is axiomatic that a court has the mandate to apply
relevant statutes and jurisprudence in determining whether
the allegations in a complaint establish a cause of action.
While it focuses on the complaint, a court clearly cannot
disregard decisions material to the proper appreciation of the
questions before it. In resolving the motion to dismiss, the trial
court should have taken cognizance of the official acts of the
legislative, executive, and judicial departments because they
are proper subjects of mandatory judicial notice as provided
by Sec. 1 of Rule 129 of the Rules of Court (DENR v. DENR
Region 12 Employees, 409 SCRA 359).
4. In a case questioning the title of the University of
the Philippines to certain lots, the Court ruled that the lower
courts should take judicial notice of the fact that Congress
and the Supreme Court have both officially recognized the
university’s indefeasible title to its landholdings. The official
acts of the legislative, executive and judicial departments
of the Philippines are matters of mandatory judicial notice
(Republic u. Rosario, G.R. No. 186635, January 27, 2016).
5. Under the amended rule, only the official acts of the
executive, legislative and judicial departments of the National
Government are subject of mandatory judicial notice. Hence,
those of local government units (LGUs) are generally not
subject to mandatory judicial notice. For instance, ordinances
of LGUs are not subject to mandatory judicial notice, even
if the charter of an LGU requires courts sitting in said LGU
to take judicial notice thereof. In Social Justice Society v.
Atienza, G.R. No. 156052, February 13, 2008, the Supreme
Court ruled that such provision in the charter of the City of
Manila cannot be taken to mean that since it has its seat in
said city, it should have taken steps to procure a copy of a
particular Manila ordinance on its own, relieving the party

96

evidence

(The Bar Lectures Series)

of any duty to inform the Supreme Court about it. The party
asking the court to take judicial notice must supply the court
with the full text of the rules the party desires it to have notice
of. Counsel should take the initiative in requesting that a trial
court take judicial notice of an ordinance even where a statute
requires courts to take judicial notice of local ordinances.
When judicial notice is discretionary (Bar 2012)

1. Under the principle of discretionary judicial notice,
“A court may take judicial notice of matters which are of public
knowledge, or are capable of unquestionable demonstration,
or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial
functions” (Sec. 2, Rule 129, Rules of Court).
2. The principal guide in determining what facts may
be assumed to be judicially-known is that of notoriety. Hence,
it can be said that judicial notice is limited to facts evidenced
by public records and facts of general notoriety. Moreover, a
judicially-noticed fact must be one not subject to a reasonable
dispute in that it is either: (1) generally known within the
territorial jurisdiction of the trial court; or (2) capable of
accurate and ready determination by resorting to sources
whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questionable.
“Things of ‘common knowledge,’ of which courts take
judicial notice of, are matters coming to the knowledge of
men generally in the course of the ordinary experiences of
life, or they may be matters which are generally accepted by
mankind as true and are capable of ready and unquestioned
demonstration. Thus, facts which are universally known, and
which may be found in encyclopedias, dictionaries or other
publications, are judicially noticed, provided, they are of such
universal notoriety and so generally understood that they
may be regarded as forming part of the common knowledge
of every person. As the common knowledge of man ranges
far and wide, a wide variety of particular facts have been
judicially noticed as being matters of common knowledge. But
a court cannot take judicial notice of any fact which, in part, is
dependent on the existence or non-existence of a fact of which

CHAPTER III

NOTICE AND JUDICIAL ADMISSIONS
— JUDICIALA. Judicial
Notice

97

the court has no constructive knowledge” (Expertravel and
Tours, Inc. u. Court of Appeals, 459 SCRA 147).
Thus, using the above standards, the mere merger of two
corporations is not of common knowledge since the element
of notoriety as basis for taking judicial notice of the merger is
lacking (See Bank of Commerce v. Heirs of Rodolfo de la Cruz,
G.R. No. 211519, August 14, 2017).
3. The power to take judicial notice is to be exercised
by courts with caution especially in an expropriation case
which involves a vast tract of land. Care must be taken that
the requisite notoriety exists; and every reasonable doubt on
the subject should be promptly resolved in the negative (Land
Bank of the Philippines v. Wycoco, 419 SCRA 67; See Bank
of Commerce v. Heirs of Rodolfo de la Cruz, G.R. No. 211519,
August 14, 2017).

In Wycoco, the trial court, in arriving at the valuation of
the land, took judicial notice of the alleged prevailing market
value of agricultural lands in the place without apprising the
parties of its intention to take judicial notice thereof despite
the requirement of a hearing under Sec. 3, Rule 129 of the
Rules on Evidence.
The Supreme Court, in the same case, held that, inasmuch
as the valuation of the property is the very issue in the case at
bar, the trial court should have allowed the parties to present
evidence thereon instead of practically assuming a valuation
without basis.

Judicial notice and knowledge of the judge (Bar 1980, 2011)

1. Judicial notice may be taken of a fact which judges
ought to know because of their judicial functions (Sec. 2, Rule
129, Rules of Court).

But judicial notice is not judicial knowledge. The mere
personal knowledge of the judge is not the judicial knowledge
of the court, and he is not authorized to make his individual
knowledge of a fact, not generally or professionally known, as
the basis of his action (State Prosecutors u. Muro, 236 SCRA

98

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

505; Land Bank of the Philippines v. Wycoco, supra; See Bank
of Commerce v. Heirs of Rodolfo de la Cruz, G.R. No. 211519,
August 14, 2017).

2. Judicial notice is not limited by the actual knowledge
of the individual judge or court. A judge must take judicial
notice of a fact if it is one which is the proper subject of judicial
cognizance even if it is not within his personal knowledge.
Consequently, a judge may not take judicial notice of a fact
which he personally knows if it is not part of the evidence or
not a fact generally known within its territorial jurisdiction
(29 Am Jur, Evidence, §35; Moore v. Dresden Investment Co.,
162 Wash, 289, 298 Pac. 465, 77 A.L.R. 1258 cited in Jones,
The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases, Vol. 1, §132).
Stage when judicial notice may be taken

The court shall hear the parties on the propriety of taking
judicial notice of a fact during pre-trial and trial pursuant to
the procedure in Sec. 3 of Rule 129 of the Rules of Court, as
follows:
1. Prior to the 2019 amendments, it was optional
for the court during trial to announce its intention to take
judicial notice of any matter and allow the parties to be heard
thereon. The current rule makes it mandatory for the court,
whether motu propria or upon motion, to hear the parties on
the propriety of taking judicial notice of any matter, not only
during trial but as early as the pre-trial stage (Sec. 3, Rule
129, Rules of Court).
2. However, before judgment or on appeal, taking
judicial notice becomes discretionary on the part of the court
only if such matter is decisive on a material issue in the case,
and after having heard the parties thereon (Ibid.).
Judicial notice of foreign laws; doctrine of processual
presumption (Bar 1997, 2005, 2011)

1. It is well-settled in our jurisdiction that our courts
cannot take judicial notice of foreign laws. Like any other
fact, they must be alleged and proved. Australian marital

laws, for example, are not among those matters that judges
are supposed to know by reason of their judicial functions
(Garcia v. Garcia-Recio, 366 SCRA 437; Vda. de Catalan v.
Catalan-Lee, 665 SCRA 487, 496, February 8, 2012). Thus, a
party who wants to have a foreign law applied to a dispute or
case has the burden of proving the foreign law (Del Socorro v.
Van Wilsem, G.R. No. 193707, December 10, 2014).
In general, and in the absence of statutory requirement
to the contrary, the courts of the forum will not take judicial
notice of the law prevailing in another country (29 Am Jur,
Evidence, §116). Foreign laws must be alleged and proved. In
the absence of proof, the foreign law will be presumed to be the
same as the laws of the jurisdiction hearing the case under the
doctrine of processual presumption (Northwest Orient Airlines
v. Court of Appeals, 241 SCRA 192).
For instance, the Court cannot determine whether the
termination of plaintiff is in accordance with Singaporean law
because of the failure to prove the applicable law of Singapore.
Philippine courts do not take judicial notice of foreign laws.
In the absence of evidence of the law of the foreign country,

Philippine laws should be applied under the doctrine of
processual presumption (Laureano v. Court of Appeals, 324
SCRA 414).

2. It was, however, held that where the foreign law is
within the actual knowledge of the court, such as when the
law is generally well-known, had been ruled upon in previous
cases before it, and none of the parties claim otherwise, the
court may take judicial notice of the foreign law (PCIB v.
Escolin, 56 SCRA 266).
Judicial notice of the law of nations

When the foreign law refers to the law of nations, said
law is subject to a mandatory judicial notice under Sec. 1 of
Rule 129. Under the Constitution, the Philippines adopts the
generally-accepted principles of international law as part of
the law of the land (Sec. 2, Art. II, 1987 Constitution). Being
parts of the law of the land, they are, therefore, technically,

in the nature of local laws and, hence, subject to a mandatory
judicial notice under Sec. 1 of Rule 129.

before the same judge (Land Bank of the Philippines v. Yatco
Agricultural Enterprises, G.R. No. 172551, January 15, 2014).

Judicial notice of municipal ordinances (Bar 2005, 2011)
1. Municipal trial courts should take judicial notice of
municipal ordinances in force in the municipality in which
they sit (U.S. v. Blanco, 37 Phil. 126).

2. The following are the exceptions to the rule in the
immediately preceding paragraph: (a) when, in the absence of
any objection and with the knowledge of the opposing party,
the contents of said other case are clearly referred to by title
and number in a pending action and adopted or read into
the record of the latter; or (b) when the original record of the
other case or any part of it is actually withdrawn from the
archives at the court’s discretion upon the request, or with
the consent, of the parties, and admitted as part of the record
of the pending case (Tabuena v. Court of Appeals, 196 SCRA
650; People v. Mendoza, 204 SCRA 288; Jumamil v. Cafe, 470
SCRA 475; Calamba Steel Center, Inc. v. Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, 457 SCRA 482).

2. A Court of First Instance (now RTC) should also
take judicial notice of municipal ordinances in force in the
municipalities within their jurisdiction but only when so
required by law. For example, the charter of the City of Manila
requires all courts sitting therein to take judicial notice of
all ordinances passed by the city council (City of Manila v.
Garcia, 19 SCRA 413). The RTC must take judicial notice
also of municipal ordinances in cases on appeal to it from the
inferior court in which the latter took judicial notice of (U.S.
u Hernandez, 31 Phil. 342; U.S. v. Blanco, supra; Moran,
Comments on the Rules of Court, 1980, p. 42).
3. The Court of Appeals may take judicial notice of
municipal ordinances because nothing in the Rules prohibits
it from taking cognizance of an ordinance which is capable
of unquestionable demonstration (Gallego v. People, 8 SCRA
813).

Judicial notice of a court's own acts and records
A court will take judicial notice of its own acts and records
in the same case (Republic v. Court of Appeals, 277 SCRA
633).
No judicial notice of records of other cases; exceptions
1. While courts may take judicial notice of its own
acts and records in the same case, as a rule, courts are not
authorized to take judicial notice of the contents of the records
of other cases, even when such cases have been tried or are
pending in the same court, and notwithstanding the fact
that both cases may have been heard or are actually pending

Judicial notice of proprietary acts of government-owned
and controlled corporations

A management contract entered into by a governmentowned and controlled corporation like that involving the
Philippine Ports Authority is not among the matters which
the courts can take judicial notice of. It cannot be considered
an official act of the executive department because it was
entered into while performing a proprietary function (Asian
Terminals, Inc. v. Malayan Insurance Co., Inc., 647 SCRA
111, 130-131, April 4, 2011).
Judicial notice of post office practices

That a registered letter when posted is immediately
stamped with the date of its receipt, indicating therein the
number of the registry, both on the covering envelope itself
and on the receipt delivered to the person who delivered the
letter to the office is not a proper subject of judicial notice.
This post office practice is not covered by any of the instances
under the Rules and is not of unquestionable demonstration
(Republic u. Court of Appeals, 107 SCRA 504).

102

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

Judicial notice of banking practices
May judicial notice be taken of the practice of banks in
conducting background checks on borrowers and sureties?
While a court is not mandated to take judicial notice of
this practice under Sec. 1 of Rule 129 of the Rules of Court,
it, nevertheless, may do so under Sec. 2 of the same rule on
discretionary judicial notice. Section 2 of Rule 129 provides
that a court may take judicial notice of “matters which are of
public knowledge, or ought to be known to judges because of
their judicial functions.” Thus, the Court has taken judicial
notice of the practices of banks and other financial institutions.
Precisely, it has noted that it is their uniform practice, before
approving a loan, to investigate, examine and assess would-be
borrowers’ credit standing or real estate offered as security for
the loan applied for (Solidbank Corp. u. Mindanao Ferroalloy
Corporation, 464 SCRA 409).
Judicial notice of the financial condition of the government

Judicial notice could be taken of the fact that the
government is and has for many years been financially
strapped, to the point that even the most essential services
have suffered serious curtailment (La Bugal-Blaan Tribal
Association v. Ramos, 445 SCRA 1).
Judicial notice of presidential powers

The trial court should take judicial notice of R.A. No.
6734, as implemented by E.O. No. 429, as legal basis of the
President’s power to reorganize the executive department.
The official acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial
departments are proper subjects of mandatory judicial notice
(DENR v. DENR Region 12 Employees, 409 SCRA 359).

Judicial notice of other matters
1. Courts cannot take judicial notice of the assessed
value of a realty (Penta Pacific Realty Corp. u. Ley Construction
and Development Corp., 741 SCRA 426).

CHAPTER III

2. It is a matter of judicial notice that an overseas
worker bears a great degree of emotional strain while making
an effort to perform his work well (Fil-Pride Shipping
Company, Inc. u. Balasta, G.R. No. 193047, March 3, 2014;
Magsaysay Mitsui OSK Marine, Inc. v. Bengson, 738 SCRA
184).
3. A court cannot take judicial notice of an administra¬
tive regulation or of a statute that is not yet effective. The
reason is simple. A law which is still inexistent cannot be
of common knowledge capable of ready and unquestionable
demonstration (State Prosecutors v. Muro, 236 SCRA 505).
4. MTC and MCTC judges may act as notaries public
ex officio in the notarization of documents connected only
with the exercise of their official functions and duties (Borre
v. Mayo, Adm. Matter 1765-CFI, 100 SCRA 314; Penera v.
Dalocanog, Adm. Matter 2113-MJ, 104 SCRA 193). They may
not, as notaries public ex officio, undertake the preparation
and acknowledgment of private documents, contracts, and
other acts of conveyances which bear no direct relation to the
performance of their functions as judges.
However, the Court, taking judicial notice of the fact that
there are still municipalities which have neither lawyers nor
notaries public, ruled that MTC and MCTC judges assigned
to municipalities or circuits with no lawyers or notaries public
may, in their capacities as notaries public ex officio, perform
any act within the competency of a regular notary public,
provided that: (1) all notarial fees charged be for the account
of the Government and turned over to the municipal treasurer
(Lapena, Jr. v. Marcos, 114 SCRA 572); and (2) certification
be made in the notarized documents attesting to the lack of
any lawyer or notary public in such municipality or circuit
(Doughlas v. Lopez, 325 SCRA 129).

5. It must be emphasized that the circumstances of
minority and relationship mentioned in the Revised Penal
Code are special qualifying circumstances which must be
alleged in the information and duly proven by the prosecution.
Here, although the minority of the victim was properly alleged

evidence

104

CHAPTER III

(The Bar Lectures Series)

in the information, there is insufficient evidence of private
complainant’s age. The trial court erred when it took judicial
notice of private complainant’s age to be 14. It should have
required competent evidence, such as her birth certificate, as
proof of the victim’s actual age at the time of the commission
of the offense (People u. Metin, 403 SCRA 105 [2003]).

In this age of modern technology, the courts may
take judicial notice that business transactions may be made
by individuals through teleconferencing. Teleconferencing is
interactive group communication (three or more people in two
or more locations) through an electronic medium. In general
terms, teleconferencing can bring people together under one
roof even though they are separated by hundreds of miles.
This type of group communication may be used in a number
of ways, and have three basic types: (1) video conferencing—
television-like communication augmented with sound; (2)
computer conferencing—printed communication through
6.

—

keyboard terminals; and (3) audio-conferencing verbal

communication via the telephone with optional capacity for
telewriting or telecopying. Although judicial notice may be
taken of teleconferencing as a means of making business
transactions, there is no judicial notice that one was conducted
in a particular case (Expertravel and Tours, Inc. u. Court of
Appeals, 459 SCRA 147).

7. It can be judicially noticed that the scene of the rape
is not always nor necessarily isolated or secluded, for lust is
no respecter of time or place. The offense of rape can and has
been committed in places where people congregate, e.g., inside
a house where there are occupants, a five-meter room with
five people inside, or even in the same room which the victim
is sharing with the accused’s sister (People v. Tundag, 342
SCRA 704).
8. The trial court properly took judicial notice that
Talamban, Cebu City is an urban area. Judicial notice is the
cognizance of certain facts which judges may properly take
and act on without proof because they already know them. A
municipal jurisdiction, whether designated as chartered city

NOTICE AND JUDICIAL ADMISSIONS 105
— JUDICIALA. Judicial
Notice

or provincial capital, is considered as urban in its entirety if it
has a population density of at least 1,000 persons per square
kilometer. The City of Cebu was created on October 20, 1934
under Commonwealth Act No. 58. It is a highly urbanized
city classified as entirely urban. Thus, all its barangays,
including Talamban, are considered urban (Chiongbian-Oliva
v. Republic, 522 SCRA 599).
9. It is of judicial notice that the judiciary is beset with
the gargantuan task in unclogging dockets, not to mention
the shortage of judges occupying positions in far-flung areas.
Apart from presiding in the trial of cases, justices and judges
are required to resolve the same within a prescribed period
mandated by law (Government Service Insurance System v.
Vallar, 536 SCRA 620).
10. Judicial notice can be taken of the fact that
testimonies during trial are much more exact and elaborate
than those stated in sworn statements, usually being
incomplete and inaccurate for a variety of reasons, at times
because of partial and innocent suggestions or for want of
specific inquiries (Estioca v. People, 556 SCRA 300). It is of
judicial notice that sworn statements are almost always
incomplete, often inaccurate and generally inferior to the
testimony of witness in open court (People v. Sorila, Jr., 556
SCRA 392).

11. The Supreme Court has taken judicial notice of
scientific findings that drug abuse can damage the mental
faculties of the user. It is beyond question, therefore, that
any employee under the influence of drugs cannot possibly
continue doing his duties without posing a serious threat to
the lives and property of his co-workers and even his employer
(Bughaw, Jr. v. Treasure Island Industrial Corp., 550 SCRA
307).

12. It is a matter of judicial knowledge that persons
have killed or committed serious offenses for no reason at all
(People v. Zeta, 549 SCRA 541).
13. If, counsel moves to another address without
informing the court of that change, such omission or neglect

is inexcusable and will not stay the finality of the decision.
The court cannot be expected to take judicial notice of the new
address of a lawyer who has moved, or ascertain, on its own
whether or not the counsel of record has been changed and
who the new counsel could possibly be or where he probably
resides or holds office (Karen and Khristy Fishing Industry u
Court of Appeals, 536 SCRA 243).
14. Notwithstanding a person’s standing in the business
community, the court cannot take judicial notice of said
person’s home address or office after his departure from
the government as a cabinet member (Garrucho v. Court of
Appeals, 448 SCRA 165).

B. Judicial Admissions
1. Under Sec. 4 of Rule 129, as amended, judicial
admissions are described and defined as follows:
“SEC. 4. Judicial admissions. — An admission,

201 or written, made by the party in the course of the
proceedings in the same case, does not require proof.
The admission may be contradicted only by showing
that It was made through palpable mistake or that the
imBJlted admission was not, in fact made.”

2. A judicial admission made by the parties in a plead¬
ing, or in the course of the trial or other proceedings in the same
case, are conclusive upon the party making the admission and
require no proof (Arcaina v. Ingram, G.R. No. 196444, Febru¬
ary 15, 2017). They are legally binding on the party making
the admission (Eastern Shipping Lines v. BPI/ MS Insurance
Corp., G.R. No. 182864, January 12, 2015). Since the admis¬
sion is legally binding on the party making the admission, it
cannot be contradicted unless previously shown to have been
made through palpable mistake or that no such admission
was made (Arcaina u. Ingram, supra). Thus, an admission by
a party in a pleading that one is an American citizen, is bind-

ing upon him (Heirs of Peter Donton v. Stier, G.R. No. 216491,
August 23, 2017).

3. To be a judicial admission under Sec. 4 of Rule 129,
certain elements must be considered:

First, the same must be made by a party to the case.
Admissions of a non-party do not fall within the definition
of Sec. 4 of Rule 129;
Second, the admission, to be judicial, must be made
in the course of the proceedings in the same case. Thus,
an admission made in another judicial proceeding will
not be deemed a judicial admission in another case
where the admission was not made. Instead, it will be
considered an extrajudicial admission for purposes of the
other proceeding where such admission is offered.

It has been held that "... To be considered as a
judicial admission, the same must be made in the same
case in which it is offered” (Programme Inc. v. Province
of Bataan, 492 SCRA 529; Camitan v. Fidelity Insurance
Corp., 551 SCRA 540; Ocampo v. Ocampo, Sr., G.R. No.
227894, July 5, 2017); and

Third, Sec. 4 of Rule 129 does not require a particular
form for an admission. Form is immaterial because the
provision recognizes either a verbal or written admission.
4. The stipulation of facts at the pre-trial of a case
constitutes judicial admissions. The veracity of judicial
admissions requires no further proof and may be controverted
only upon a clear showing that the admissions were made
through palpable mistake or that no admissions were made.
Thus, the admissions of parties during the pre-trial, as
embodied in the pre-trial order, are binding and conclusive
upon them (Cuenco v. Talisay Tourist Sports Complex, 569
SCRA 616).

In a criminal case, admissions made by an accused during
a pre-trial requires a definite form. Without complying with the
required form, such admissions will not be binding upon him.

10g

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

The rule requires that all agreements or admissions made or
entered during the pre-trial “shall he reduced in writing and
signed by the accused and counsel, otherwise they cannot be
used against the accused" (Sec. 2, Rule 118, Rules of Court).
5. A party may make judicial admissions in (a)
the pleadings, (b) during trial, either by verbal or written
manifestations or stipulations, or (c) in other stages of the
judicial proceedings (Manzanillo u. Waterfields Industries
Corporation, G.R. No. 177484, July 18, 2014; Ocampo v.
Ocampo, Sr., G.R. No. 227894, July 5, 2017).
A duly sworn affidavit, submitted as part of the evidence
in a case, stating therein that the affiant is an American
citizen, is binding upon him as an admission against his own
interest in the absence of palpable mistake. Hence, the lower
court erred in ruling that the affiant’s American citizenship
was not established in the case (Heirs of Peter Donton v. Stier,
G.R. No. 216491, August 23, 2017).
Admissions in pleadings and motions (Bar 2011)

It is settled that admissions made by the parties in the
pleadings, or in the course of the trial or other proceedings
in the same case, are conclusive and do not require further
evidence to prove them (Uy u. Del Castillo, G.R. No. 223610,
July 24, 2017). This is because admissions made in the
pleadings of a party are deemed judicial admissions (Ching
u. Court of Appeals, 331 SCRA 16). The admission includes
those made in the complaint (Delfin v. Billones, 485 SCRA
38). The admissions made in a motion are judicial admissions
which are binding on the party who made them. Such party
is precluded from denying the same (Herrera-Felix v. Court of
Appeals, 436 SCRA 87).
1. An admission in the answer to the complaint takes
on the character of a judicial admission contemplated in
Sec. 4, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court. A judicial admission
conclusively binds the party making it. He cannot thereafter
contradict it. The exception is found only in those rare instances
when the trial court, in the exercise of its discretion and

because of strong reasons to support its stand, may relieve a
party from the consequences of his admission. A party cannot
subsequently take a position contrary to, or inconsistent with,
his pleadings (Heirs of Pedro Clemena v. Heirs of Irene B.
Bien, 501 SCRA 405).
2. An admission made in a pleading may be an actual
admission as when a party categorically admits a material
allegation made by the adverse party. An admission may,
likewise, be inferred from the failure to specifically deny
the material allegations in the other party’s pleadings. The
rules of civil procedure, for example, require a defendant to
specifically deny the material averments of the other party.
“Material averments in the complaint, other than those
as to the amount of unliquidated damages, shall be deemed
admitted when not specifically denied ...” (Sec. 11, Rule 8,
Rules of Court).
3. In one case, the petitioner argued that the lower
courts erred in admitting certain text messages he sent despite
the failure of the offeror to authenticate such messages. The
record, however, discloses his having admitted to having sent
the text messages. The Court ruled that, any question as to
the admissibility of the messages as evidence is rendered
moot and academic if the party raising such issue admits
the authorship of the same (BBB v. AAA, G.R. No. 193225,
February 9, 2015).

4. Admissions, however, made in drafts of pleadings
not yet filed are obviously not judicial admissions because
they are not parts of the records of the case.
Averments in pleadings which are not deemed admissions

There are averments in the pleadings which are not
deemed admitted even if the adverse party fails to make a
specific denial of the same like immaterial allegations (Sec.
11, Rule 8, Rules of Court), conclusions, non-ultimate facts in
the pleading (Sec. 1, Rule 8, ibid.) as well as the amount of
unliquidated damages (Sec. 11, Rule 8, ibid.).

110

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

Implied admissions of actionable documents

1. When an action or defense is founded upon a written
instrument, the genuineness and due execution of the same
instrument shall he deemed admitted unless the adverse
party, under oath, specifically denies them and sets forth
what he claims to be the facts (Sec. 8, Rule 8, Rules of Court;
Philippine National Bank u Refrigeration Industries, Inc.,
479 SCRA 240).
2. Failure to deny the genuineness and due execution
of an actionable document does not preclude a party from
arguing against the document by evidence of fraud, mistake,
compromise, payment, statute of limitations, estoppel, and
want of consideration (Acabal v. Acabal, 454 SCRA 555;
Philippine National Bank v. Refrigeration Industries, Inc.,
479 SCRA 240). He is, however, precluded from arguing that
the document is a forgery because the genuineness of the
document has been impliedly admitted by his failure to deny
the same under oath.
Admissions In the pre-trial of civil cases
1. One of the purposes of a pre-trial in a civil case is for
the court to consider the possibility of obtaining stipulations
or admissions of facts (Sec. 2[c], Rule 18, Rules of Court).
Admissions made during pre-trial, as well as those made
during depositions, interrogatories or requests for admission,
are all deemed judicial admissions because they are made in
the course of the proceedings of the case.
2. Admissions made in a stipulation of facts by the
parties in the pre-trial are treated as judicial admissions
(Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. a BPI/MS Insurance Corp.,
G.R. No. 182684, January 12, 2015). For instance, petitioner’s
admission as to the execution of the promissory note at the
pre-trial sufficed to settle the question of the genuineness of
the signatures therein. The admission, having been made
in a stipulation of facts at pre-trial by the parties, must be
treated as a judicial admission (SCC Chemicals Corp. v. Court
of Appeals, 353 SCRA 70).

CHAPTER in -JUDICIAL NOTICE AND JUDICIAL ADMISSIONS
B. Judicial Admissions

Hl

Admissions in the pre-trial of criminal cases (Bar 2008)
1. Although an admission made during the pre-trial is
deemed to have been made in the course of a judicial proceeding
and is necessarily a judicial admission, an admission made by
the accused in the pre-trial of a criminal case is not necessarily
admissible against him. To be admissible, the conditions
set forth in Sec. 2 of Rule 118 must be complied with. The
pertinent rule provides:
"SEC. 2. Pre-trial agreement — All agreements
or admissions made or entered during the pre-trial
conference shall be reduced in writing and signed by
the accused and counsel, otherwise, they cannot be
used against the accused. The agreements covering
the matters referred to in Section 1 of this Rule shall be
approved by the court.”

2. Does the above rule (requiring an admission made or
entered into during the pre-trial conference to be reduced in
writing and signed by the accused and his counsel before the
same may be used in evidence against the accused), equally
apply to stipulation of facts made during the trial?

In resolving the question in the negative, the Supreme
Court ruled:
“A stipulation of facts entered into by the
prosecution and defense counsel during trial in open
court is automatically reduced in writing and contained
in the official transcript of proceedings had in court. The
conformity of the accused in the form of his signature
affixed thereto is unnecessary in view of the fact ... that
an attorney who is employed to manage a party’s conduct
of a lawsuit ... has prima facie authority to make relevant
admissions by pleadings, by oral or written stipulation ...
which, unless allowed to be withdrawn are conclusive. In
fact, judicial admissions are frequently those of counsel
or of the attorney of record, who is, for the purpose of the
trial, the agent of his client. When such admissions are
made, they bind the client ...” (People v. Hernandez, 206
SCRA 25; Silot u De la Rosa, 543 SCRA 533).

Admissions In amended pleadings (Bar 2011)

When a pleading is amended, the amended pleading
supersedes the pleading that it amends and the admissions
in the superseded pleading may be offered in evidence against
the pleader (Sec. 8, Rule 10, Rules of Court).
Nature of admissions in superseded pleadings

It has been held that the admissions in a superseded
pleading are to be considered as extrajudicial admissions which
must be proven. The Supreme Court declared that pleadings
that have been amended disappear from the record, lose their
status as pleadings, and cease to be judicial admissions, and
to be utilized as extrajudicial admissions, they must, in order
to have such effect, be formally offered in evidence (Torres v.
Court of Appeals, 131 SCRA 24; Ching v. Court of Appeals,
331 SCRA 16).
Admissions in dismissed pleadings
Admissions made in pleadings that have been dismissed
are merely extrajudicial admissions (Servicewide Specialists,
Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 257 SCRA 643).

Sworn statement of a proposed state witness

If the motion to discharge an accused as a state witness is
denied, his sworn statement, submitted to support the motion,
shall be inadmissible in evidence (Sec. 17, Rule 119, Rules of
Court).

Admissions by counsel
Admissions by a counsel are generally conclusive upon
a client (De Garcia u. Court of Appeals, 37 SCRA 129). Even
the negligence of counsel binds the client (Sarraga v. Banco
Filipino Savings & Mortgage Bank, 393 SCRA 566).
This rule is not, however, without exception. In cases
where reckless or gross negligence of counsel deprives the

client of due process of law, or when its application will result
in outright deprivation of the client’s liberty or property, or
when the interests of justice so require, relief is accorded the
client who suffered by reason of the lawyer’s gross or palpable
mistake or negligence (Salazar v. Court of Appeals, 376 SCRA
459; Silot v. De la Rosa, 543 SCRA 533).
Effect of judicial admissions

1. Specifically, under Sec. 4, Rule 129 of the Rules of
Court, the following are the effects of judicial admissions:
(a) They do not require proof; and
(b) They cannot be contradicted because they are
conclusive upon the party making it.

2. Judicial admissions are legally binding on the
party making the admissions (Noynay u. Citihomes Builder
and Development, Inc., 735 SCRA 708). It is an established
principle that judicial admissions cannot be contradicted by
the admitter who is the party himself and binds the person
who makes the same, absent any showing that this was
made through palpable mistake, no amount of rationalization
can offset it (Philippine Charter Insurance Corp. v. Central
Colleges of the Philippines, 666 SCRA 540, 553, February 22,
2012; De la Pena v. Avila, 665 SCRA 553, 567, February 8,
2012; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Manila Electric
Company, G.R. No. 181459, June 9, 2014; Ocampo v. Ocampo,
Sr., G.R. No. 227894, July 5, 2017).

A party who judicially admits a fact cannot later
challenge that fact, as judicial admissions are a waiver of proof;
production of evidence is dispensed with. A judicial admission
removes the admitted fact from the field of controversy.
Consequently, an admission made in the pleadings cannot
be controverted by the party making such admission, and
is conclusive to such party, and all proofs to the contrary or
inconsistent therewith should be ignored, whether objection is
interposed or not. The allegations, statements or admissions
contained in a pleading are conclusive as against the pleader.

A party cannot subsequently take a position contrary to or
inconsistent with what was pleaded (Eastern Shipping Lines,
Inc. v. BPI /MS Insurance Corp., G.R. No. 182864, January
12, 2015).
The reason for the above rulings is found under the
doctrine of estoppel. Under the doctrine, an admission or
representation is rendered conclusive upon the person making
it, and cannot be denied or disproved as against the person
relying thereon (Manzanilla v. Waterfields Industrial Corp.,
G.R. No. 177484, July 18, 2014).
3. The trial court may reject evidence that a party
adduces to contradict a judicial admission he made in
his pleading since such admission is conclusive as to him
(Equitable Cardnetwork, Inc. v. Capistrano, 665 SCRA 454,
465, February 8, 2012). The judicial admission removes an
admitted fact from the field of controversy (Josefa v. Manila
Electric Company, G.R. No. 182705, July 18, 2014).
How judicial admissions may be contradicted

1. Section 4 of Rule 129 provides for either of two ways
to contradict a judicial admission, namely:
(a) by showing that the admission was made
through palpable mistake; or
(b) by showing that no such admission was made.

The mistake that would relieve a party from the effects
of his admission is not any mistake. It must be one that is
“palpable,” a mistake that is “clear to the mind or plain to
see” (New Oxford American Dictionary, 2001 Ed., p. 1232). It
is a mistake that is “readily perceived by the senses or the
mind” (Oxford English Reference, Second Ed., Revised, 2002,
p. 1049).
2. A party may also argue that he made “no such
admission.” This argument may be invoked when the statement
of a party is taken out of context or that his statement was
made not in the sense it is made to appear by the other party.

116

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

Here, the party upon whom the admission is imputed does
not deny making a statement. What he denies is the meaning
attached to his statement, a meaning made to appear by the
adverse party as an admission.

Chapter IV

The Committee on the Revision of the Rules of Court
explained the second exception in this wise:

OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE

"... if a party invokes an ‘admission’ by an adverse
party, but cites the admission ‘out of context,’ then the
one making the ‘admission’ may show that he made no
‘such’ admission, or that his admission was taken out of
context.

... that the party can also show that he made no
‘such admission,’ i.e., not in the sense that the admission
is made to appear.
That is the reason for the modifier ‘such’ because
if the rule simply states that the admission may be
contradicted by showing that ‘no admission was made,’
the rule would not really be providing for a contradiction
of the admission but just a denial.” (Atillo v. Court of
Appeals, 266 SCRA 596; Sicam u. Jorge, 529 SCRA 443).

— —
oOo

Classification of evidence under the Rules of Court

1. As the means of ascertaining in a judicial proceeding
the truth respecting a matter of fact, evidence under the Rules
of Court, may be object, documentary or testimonial (Tabuada
v. Tabuada, G.R. No. 196510, September 12, 2018).
2. Significantly, the rules on evidence do not declare
which among the three major types of evidence is the most
superior or has the most probative value. The better view
is to consider such types as complementing each other. For
instance, both documentary and object evidence being offered
as authentic, before being admitted in evidence, have to
be identified and authenticated. A document or an object,
however, can neither identify nor authenticate itself. A pistol,
for example, cannot speak for and identify itself. Neither
can a document, like a deed of sale. Both identification and
authentication of the evidence need a natural person called a
witness. When a witness is presented in court, his statements
constitute testimonial evidence. For purposes of identification
and authentication, both documentary and object evidence
need to be “sponsored” by a witness.

While testimonial evidence may stand alone even without
a documentary or object evidence, the credibility of, the
testimony may be reinforced and enhanced when consistent
with the document and the object. When the witness testifies
that she was strangled with a rope by the accused and the
physical evidence, as found by a medico-legal officer, matches
with the testimony, the credibility of the testimony is
bolstered. However, common reason suggests that when the
117

u8

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

testimonial evidence conflicts with the documentary or object
evidence, testimonial evidence cannot prevail since it can
easily be fabricated. When the witness asserts, for instance,
that he never sold his land to the plaintiff, but the defendant
offers in evidence a duly notarized deed of sale executed by the
plaintiff, the testimonial evidence loses its credibility. When
the alleged victim testifies that he was shot in the left arm
by the victim, but upon examination, no scar is found, the
testimony will, inevitably, crumble.

3. Since there are several categories of evidence
recognized by the Rules of Court, documentary evidence, is
not the only evidence of a fact.

It is not correct, for instance, to say that legal relationship
can be proven only by documentary evidence. Jurisprudence
holds that competent proof of a legal relationship between
individuals is not limited to documentary evidence. Object and
testimonial evidence may be admitted for the same purpose.
The relationship may be established by all the relevant facts
and circumstances that constitute preponderance of evidence
(Ibid.).
4. Under Sec. 6(c) of Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, as
amended, every pleading stating a party’s claims or defenses
must state the documentary and object evidence in support of
the allegations contained therein.

A. Object Evidence
(Rule 130)
Nature of object evidence

1. Object or real evidence, as defined by Rule 130 of
the Rules of Court, refers to evidence that is addressed to the
senses of the court.
“SECTION 1. Object as evidence. — Objects as
evidence are those addressed to the senses of the court
When an object Is relevant to the fact in issue, it may be
exhibited to, examined or viewed by the court.”

CHAPTER IV

AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
—A.OBJECT Evidence
Object

119

(Rule 130)

2. Object evidence does not refer to the perception of
the witness and a recollection of that perception. It is not a
reconstruction of past events as related by a witness on the
stand. Real or object evidence is not a verbal description of
something. It is not a replica or a mere representation of
something. Object or real evidence is exactly what its name
suggests. It is the real thing itself like the knife used to slash
the victim’s throat, the ring actually stolen by the accused, the
bullet extracted from the victim’s chest, the mangled fender
of a truck that was rear-ended by a bulldozer, or the blood
splattered on the wall of the room where the victim was found.
It consists of tangible things like a gun, a broken glass, a piece
of bloody clothing or the defective ladder that caused the fall
of the plaintiff.
Object or real evidence appeals directly to the senses of the
court. Instead of relying on the recollection of the witness, an
object evidence will enable the court to have its own firsthand
perception of the evidence. If the court wants to know whether
or not the bolo used in the crime is long or short, big or small,
sharp or blunted, the object evidence would be the bolo itself.
3. Object evidence could have a very persuasive effect
on the part of the court. A display of one’s injury is very
powerful. No one can dispute a missing arm or a severed leg.
No other evidence is necessary to establish the injury.
Even a human being may be a form of real evidence.
Where the racial characteristics of a party are at issue, the
court may, at its discretion, view the person concerned. In a
criminal case where the complaining witness avers that he
was stabbed in the arm by the accused, the court may inspect
his arm. The absence of any scar in the spot where the injury
was allegedly inflicted may convince the court that the witness
was untruthful in his testimony.
The court may, likewise, allow the exhibition of the
weapon allegedly used in attacking the victim, the bloody
garment of the victim or the personal effect, like a glove, left
by the supposed assailant in the scene of the crime.

EVIDENCE

120

(The Bar Lectures Series)

4.

Object evidence could provide a dramatic end to

a case. In one sensational American double murder case
committed in 1994 involving the football great, O.J. Simpson,
the court allowed the prosecution to have the accused Simpson
try on a glove which the prosecution claimed to have been left
by the murderer in the crime scene. After a few breathless
moments, gasps from the audience broke the silence in the
courtroom when the glove did not fit the hand of the accused.
During the oral arguments before the jury, the defense
repeatedly chanted an argument that proved powerful and
effective: "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit!" 0.J. Simpson was

acquitted.
5. Object evidence is not visual alone. It covers the
entire range of human senses: hearing, taste, smell, and
touch. In a case where the issue is infringement of a musical
composition, the court may listen to the composition involved.
The court may not only look at but also touch the blade of
a knife to know whether or not it could have produced the
incision characteristic of sharp blades.
6. Physical evidence is a mute but eloquent
manifestation of truth, and it ranks high in our hierarchy

—

of trustworthy evidence where the physical evidence runs
counter to the testimonial evidence, the physical evidence
should prevail (Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Reyes, 544

SCRA 206).
Requisites for admissibility of object evidence
1. The admissibility of object or real evidence, like
any other evidence, requires that the object be both relevant
and competent. To be relevant, the evidence must have a
relationship to the fact in issue. To be competent, it must
not be excluded by the rules or by law. The legal basis of this
requirement is Sec. 3 of Rule 128: "Evidence is admissible
when it is relevant to the issue and is not excluded by the

Constitution, the law or these Rules.”
2. For the object not to be excluded by the Rules, the
same must pass the test of authentication. The threshold

CHAPTER IV

—

OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
A Object Evidence (Rule 130)

121

foundation for real evidence is its being authenticated. Is
it the real thing? In other words, is it the actual object it is
claimed to be?
To authenticate the object, it must be shown that it is
the very thing that is either the subject matter of the lawsuit
or the very one involved to prove an issue in the case. If
the prosecution wants the admission of the gun used in the
murder, it must prove that it was the very same gun used by
the accused. Another gun, although identical with the actual
gun in all respects, would not satisfy the requirements of

authentication.
3. To authenticate the object, there must be someone
who should identify the object to be the actual thing involved
in the litigation. This someone is the witness. Object evidence,
being inanimate, cannot speak for itself. It cannot present
itself to the court as an exhibit. Even a supposedly ancient
document (a private document that is more than 30 years
old produced from a custody in which it would naturally be
found if genuine and is unblemished by any alterations or
circumstances of suspicion) requires a witness to testify on the
characteristics of the document even if it no longer requires
authentication (See Sec. 21, Rule 132, Rules of Court).
4. It must be emphasized that every piece of evidence,
whether it be a document or an object, needs a witness.
Even object evidence requires statements from a witness to
make its way into the realm of admissible evidence. In short,
testimonial evidence provides the foundation for all types
of evidence. This is a very basic rule. In layman’s term, the
evidence must be “sponsored” by a witness. To authenticate
the object, the witness must have capacity to identify the
object as the very thing involved in the litigation. Better still,
he must have actual and personal knowledge of the exhibit
he is presenting for admission. This is because “a witness
can only testify to those facts which he knows of his personal
knowledge; that is, which are derived from his own perception
...” (Sec. 22, Rule 130, ibid.).

5. Object evidence is not taken in isolation. It is weighed
in relation to the testimony of a witness. Also, in giving credence
to a testimony, the court takes into consideration the physical
evidence. If the testimony bears a striking similarity with
the physical evidence, the testimony becomes worthy of belief
(People u Larranaga, 463 SCRA 652). For example, physical
evidence of lacerations in the private parts of an alleged rape
victim may corroborate testimonies that the victim was raped
(People v. Divinagracia, Sr., G.R. No. 207765, July 26, 2017).
6. When the truth or falsity of a fact in issue may be
explained by the presentation of an object, the same may be
exhibited before the court. If the witness wants to show the
condition of a particular article or substance, his testimony
will be enhanced by the presentation of said article or
substance. More often than not, the presentation of object
evidence supplements the credibility of the testimony of a
witness when the object has a clear relevance to the issue of
the case.
Cutting through all the legal foliage, the Court finds the
following as the basic requisites for the admissibility of an
object or real evidence:

—

OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
A. Object Evidence (Rule 130)

123

The requirements of relevance by the testimony of a
competent witness rarely pose a problem. Relevance is a
matter of reasoning and the court will draw an inference
of the relevancy of the evidence from the issues of the case.
Also, almost no party would offer a witness who has no
personal knowledge of the object to be authenticated. The
problem commonly lies in showing that the object sought
to be admitted is, in fact, the real thing and not a mere
substitute or representation of the real thing. This problem of
authentication is commonly called “laying the foundation" for
the evidence.

7. Object evidence, when offered in accordance with
the requisites for its admissibility, becomes evidence of the
highest order and speaks more eloquently than witnesses put
together. The presence of the victim’s ravished body in a deep
ravine with handcuffs on her wrist is a physical evidence that
bolsters the testimony of the witness (People v. Larranaga,
463 SCRA 652). In contrast, in another case, the absence
of external injuries in the body of the alleged victim belies
her claim that she was dragged to the bushes by the accused
(People v. Ganduma, 160 SCRA 799).

(a) The evidence must be relevant',

Object evidence and the right against self-incrimination (Bar

(b) The evidence must be authenticated',

2010)

(c) The authentication must be made by a
competent witness; and

The right against self-incrimination cannot be invoked
against object evidence.

(d) The object must be formally offered in evidence.

In one early case, the accused-appellant argued that the
admission as evidence of the victim’s wallet, together with its
contents, viz., (1) his residence certificate; (2) his identification
card; and (3) bunch of keys, violated his right against self¬
incrimination.
The Court held that the right against self-incrimination,

The authentication of the object by a competent witness
is to comply with the element of competence as an essential
ingredient of admissibility. After its authentication, the object
needs to be offered in evidence at the appropriate time.

As a rule, the formal offer of evidence is particularly a
vital act before the admission of evidence because the court
“shall consider no evidence which has not been formally
offered” (Sec. 34, Rule 132, Rules of Court).

guaranteed under the fundamental law, had no application
in this case because no testimonial compulsion was involved
(People v. Malimit, 264 SCRA 167).

EVIDENCE

(The Bar Lectures Series)

Demonstrative evidence
1. Demonstrative evidence is not the actual thing but
it is referred to as “demonstrative” because it represents or
demonstrates the real thing. It is not strictly “real” evidence
because it is not the very thing involved in the case. A map, a
diagram, a photograph, and a model, fall under this category.
This category of evidence is not separately defined in the
Rules of Court and appears to have been incorporated under
the general term “object” evidence.

2. The admissibility of this type of evidence largely
depends on laying the proper foundation for the evidence.
The rule boils down to one basic question: Does the evidence
sufficiently and accurately represent the object it seeks to
demonstrate or represent? If it does, the evidence would be

admissible.

(ii) Some other person competent to testify
on the accuracy thereof (Sec. 1, Rule 11, Rules on
Electronic Evidence).

The admissibility of photographs is within the discretion
of the trial court, and its ruling in this respect will not be
interfered with, except upon a clear showing of an abuse of
discretion. In determining whether photographs should be
admitted, a trial judge must determine whether they are
relevant, and whether a proper foundation has been laid (29A
Am Jur Evidence, 2d §960).
Example:

Q: Where do you work Mr. Witness?

A: I work in National Bank of the Philippines, Sir.
Q: Where is the bank where you work located?

3. Photographs Photographs of persons, things and
places, when instructive to the understanding of the case, will
be admitted in evidence. For a still photograph to be admitted,
the same must be relevant and competent. It is competent
when it is properly authenticated by a witness who is familiar
with the scene or person portrayed, and who testifies that the
photograph faithfully represents what it depicts.

A: It is located in the comer of Guess and Rado
Sts. in St. Jude Village.

Some courts insist on requiring the photographer to
testify but this view has been eroded by the tendency of
modem courts to admit as a witness one who has familiarity
with the scene portrayed (Sison v. People, 250 SCRA 58, 75).

A: Of course, Sir. This is a picture of the comer of
Guess and Rado Sts. in St. Jude Village.

Under the Rules on Electronic Evidence, photographic
evidence of events, acts or transactions shall be admissible in
evidence provided that:

A: I’ve worked in this area for the past ten years
and I have seen this comer almost every day.

(a) It shall be presented, displayed and shown to
the court; and

(b) It shall be identified, explained or authenticated
by either:

(i) The person who made the recording; or

Q: How long have you worked in that bank?

A: For the past ten years, Sir.
Q: I am showing you a photograph. Could you
identify this photograph?

Q: How do you recognize it?

Q: How accurate is this photograph?
A: It is an exact depiction of the place. Sir.

—

The rules that
4. Motion pictures and recordings
apply to photographs generally apply to motion pictures
and recordings. Because of the possibility of tampering
and distortion, courts have traditionally required a stricter

126

EVIDENCE

CHAPTER IV

(The Bar Lectures Series)

standard for laying the foundation for motion pictures and
tape recordings. Courts then would require detailed testimony
as to the qualifications of the operator, a detailed description
of the equipment used, and the conditions under which the
photograph and the recordings were taken.

Modem courts, however, have taken judicial notice of how
motion cameras and tape recorders work and their general
reliability and prevalent use. Court practices regarding
motion pictures and tape recordings have been liberalized
and the testimony of a person present when the activities of
taking the picture and recording have been held sufficient. He
must testify that the motion picture accurately and faithfully
represents the place or person it purports to portray.

In the case of tape recordings, the witness should identify
the speakers, state how he recognizes their voices and that the
recording was not taken in violation of the Anti-Wiretapping
Law (RA No. 4200).
The modem approach to motion pictures and recordings
is reflected in local rules. Under the Rules on Electronic
Evidence, the authentication process need not involve the
person who actually made the recording. Under the Rules on
Electronic Evidence, audio, photographic and video evidence
of events, acts or transactions shall be admissible provided
it shall be shown, presented or displayed to the court and
shall be identified, explained or authenticated by the person
who made the recording or by some other person competent
to testify on the accuracy thereof. Hence, authentication can
be done by some other person other than by the person who
made the recording or took the photograph as long as he can
testify as to its accuracy (Sec. 1, Rule 11, Rules on Electronic
Evidence).

—

5. Diagrams, models and maps
These types of
demonstrative evidence are presented to indicate the relative
locations or positions of objects and persons. Aside from the
requirement of relevance, a diagram, model or map must be
identified by a witness who is familiar with what the evidence

A. Object Evidence (Rule 130)

127

depicts, and that the same is an accurate representation of
the scene it portrays. Like any other exhibit, the touchstone
for admissibility of maps, diagrams and models is the ability
of the witness to authenticate the exhibit. Some courts may
require that the model, diagram or map be made or drawn to
scale. If not drawn to scale, the court must be so informed. The
question as to the sufficiency of the authentication is a matter
of judicial discretion (29A Am Jut 2d, Evidence, §§989, 990).

—

X-ray pictures, also referred
6. X-ray pictures
to as “skiagraphs” or “radiographs,” are admissible when
shown to have been made under circumstances as to assure
their accuracy and relevancy to a material issue in the case.
Authenticated x-rays are normally involved in personal injury
cases to show the location and extent of the injury. X-rays
are properly authenticated by the x-ray technician or the
physician who testifies to the competence of the person taking
it, the procedure taken and that the x-ray picture shown is
that of the person, the anatomical part or the object involved
in the case (T.C. Young Construction Co. v. Brown [Ky] 372
SW2d 670, 99ALR3d 288). Because the science of taking x-ray
pictures is now well-founded and generally recognized, almost
all courts no longer require testimony as to the reliability of
an x-ray machine (29A Am Jur 2d, Evidence, §§977).

—

7. Scientific tests, demonstrations and experiments
The issue of refusing or granting requests for demonstrations,
experiments and tests in open court is a matter subject to
judicial discretion (Cleary, McCormick On Evidence, 3rd Ed.,
676 citing Spaak v. Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co., 231
F.2d 279 [7th Cir. 1956]).

Text messages are to be proved
by the testimony of a person who was a party to the same
or has personal knowledge of them (People v. Enojas, G.R.
No. 204894, March 10, 2014). This rule applies to telephone
conversations and other ephemeral electronic communication.
In the absence or unavailability of the required witnesses,
other competent evidence may be admitted (Sec. 2, Rule 11,

Rules on Electronic Evidence).

EVIDENCE

128

CHAPTER IV

(The Bar Lectures Series)

View of an object or scene
1. Under Sec. 1 of Rule 130, when an object is relevant
to the fact in issue, it may be exhibited to, examined or viewed
by the court. In this sense, object evidence has been referred
to as “autoptic" evidence.

Courts have recognized that there are times when
a party cannot bring an object to the court for viewing in the
courtroom. In such a situation, the court may take a view
of an object. The court may make an ocular inspection of a
contested parcel of land to resolve questions of fact raised
by the parties. It may inspect a crime scene to clarify itself
with certain matters raised by the litigants. It may view the
conditions of vehicles involved in a civil case for damages.
Going out of the courtroom to observe places and objects is
commonly termed as “view.”
2.

The “view” is expressly authorized by Sec. 1 of Rule 130
but even without this express provision, it is well-recognized
that the court has an inherent power to order a view when
there is a need to do so (See Sec. 5, Rule 135, Rules of Court).

3. The inspection may be made inside or outside the
courtroom. An inspection or view outside the courtroom
should be made in the presence of the parties or at least with
previous notice to them. It is error for the judge, for example,
to go alone to the land in question, or to the place where the
crime was committed and take a view without the previous
knowledge of the parties. Such inspection or view is part of
the trial since evidence is thereby being received (Moran,
Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. 5, pp. 78-79, 1980).
Categories of object evidence

1. For purposes of authentication of an object or for
laying the foundation for the exhibit, object evidence may be
classified into the following (29A Am Jur, §§945-947):
(a) Objects that have readily identifiable marks
(unique objects);

AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
—A.OBJECT
Object Evidence (Rule 130)

129

(b) Objects that are made readily identifiable
(objects made unique); and

(c) Objects with no identifying marks (non-unique
objects).

2. If the object has a unique characteristic, like the
serial number of a caliber .45 pistol, it becomes readily
identifiable. So long as the witness testifies that the object
has a unique characteristic, he saw the object on the relevant
date, remembers its characteristics, asserts that the object
shown to him in court is the same or substantially in the
same condition as when he first saw it and alleges that those
characteristics are those of the object he is identifying in court,
the authentication requirement is satisfied.
3. If the object does not have a unique characteristic,
like the typical kitchen knife that has no serial number, is
commonplace, and identical with a lot of knives of the same
kind and quality, the witness may be able to identify the
same in court if he claims that he made the thing acquire a
unique characteristic like placing identifying marks on it. All
he has to do in court is to testify as to what he did to make
the object identifiable and that the object presented to him for
identification in court has the characteristics he made on the
object.
Chain of custody in general

1. The third category of object evidence refers to those
which are not readily identifiable, were not made identifiable
or cannot be made identifiable like drops of blood or oil, drugs
in powder form, fiber, grains of sand, and similar objects.
These objects are easily tampered, altered or contaminated,
intentionally or unintentionally. Under this situation, the
proponent of the evidence must establish a chain of custody to
authenticate the object in court.
The rule requiring establishing the chain of custody is
not a new rule. It is merely a product of the rule that object
evidence requires authentication. As the Supreme Court puts
it: "[It] is but a variation of the principle that real evidence

Ijq

must be authenticated prior to its admission x x x” (People v.
him, G.R No. 231989, September 4, 2018; See also People u.
Pascua, G.R. No. 227707, October 8, 2018; People v. Jimenez,
G.R. No. 230721, October 15, 2018; People v. Seneres, G.R
No. 231008, November 5, 2018; People v. Malana, G.R. No.
233747, December 5, 2018).
2. In a nutshell, the chain of custody means, that it must
be established that the item subject of the offense is the same
substance offered in court as exhibit (See People v. Pundugar,
G.R No. 214779, February 7, 2018; People v. Alvarado, G.R
No. 234048, April 23, 2018). The evidence exhibited must be
the very same substance recovered from the accused (People u
Cornel, G.R No. 229047, April 16, 2018; People v. Asjali, G.R
No. 216430, September 3, 2018; People v. Cabezudo, G.R No.
232357, November 28, 2018).

In layman’s language, the purpose of the chain of custody
is to prove that the object found or confiscated in the crime
scene is the very same object offered in evidence in court.
Towards this end, the prosecution must show that there was
no planting, adulteration, switching or contamination of the
evidence from the time of its confiscation to its presentation
in court.
In the language of the Court: “The chain of custody rule
takes primary importance to ascertain that the integrity and
identity of the seized item are preserved with moral certainty"
(People v. Del Mundo, G.R. No. 208095, September 20, 2017).
Hence, the prosecution must establish by records or
testimony of the continuous whereabouts of the exhibit, from
the time it came into the possession of the police officers,
until it was tested in the laboratory and all the way to the
time it was offered in evidence in court (People v. Mendoza,
G.R. No. 220759, July 24, 2017). In establishing the chain of
custody, it must be shown that the integrity and evidentiary
value of the seized items are preserved to dispel unnecessary
doubts as to the identity of the evidence (Ibid. See also People
v. De Guzman, G.R. No. 219955, February 5, 2018; People v.
Seneres, G.R No. 231008, November 5, 2018).

AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
—A.OBJECT
Object Evidence (Rule 130)

131

3. In drug cases, the chain of custody also means that
the identity of the dangerous drugs should be established
beyond doubt by showing that the items offered in court
were the same substance involved in the buy-bust operation.
The chain of custody performs the function of ensuring that
unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the evidence
are removed (See People v. Dahil, G.R. No. 212196, January
12, 2015; People v. Suarez, G.R. No. 223141, June 6, 2018;
People v. Tumangong, G.R. No. 227015, November 26, 2018).
4.

Jurisprudence further explains:

“The chain of custody is established by testimony
about every link in the chain, from the moment the item
was picked up to the time it is offered in evidence, in
such a way that every person who touched the exhibit
would be able to describe how and from whom it was
received, where it was and what happened to it while
in the witness’ possession, the condition it was received,
and the condition in which it was delivered to the next
link in the chain. These witnesses would then describe
the precautions taken to ensure that there had been no
change in the condition of the item and no opportunity
for someone not in the chain to have possession” (People
u. Del Mundo, G.R. No. 208095, September 20, 2017; For
further readings, see also People v. Alvarado, G.R. No.
234048, April 23, 2018).

5. It needs to be stressed that establishing the chain of
custody is not necessary at all times. It is not required when
an object possesses distinguishing characteristics that would
enable a witness to readily identify the evidence in court.

Illustrations:
A. The fact situation is a criminal case. The police
investigator is testifying that he found a gun in the crime
scene.
Q: Officer, you said you found a gun on the bed
of the victim in the morning of September 15,
2012 at around 9:00 A.M.?

132

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

A: I did, Sir.
Q: Would you please describe the weapon you saw?
A: It was a .45 ACP, Colt Gold Cup Series, a fiveinch barrel, blue finish, a black handle with
wrap around grooves, and with the initials
“P.M.” on the lower left hand side of its handle.
Q: (After other questions) Would you be able to
recognize the gun if shown to you right now?
A- I would be able to recognize it, Sir.
Q: I would like to show you this gun. Will you
please examine it? (Witness examines the gun.)
What relationship does this gun have to the
gun you said you found on the victim’s bed?

A It is the very same gun, Sir.
Q: How are you able to recognize this as the very
same gun?

A It has the same characteristics as the gun I
found in the crime scene. The initials “P.M.”
are still here. Besides, it has the same serial
number in the barrel as the one I recorded in
my notebook and as I wrote in my official report.

(Counsel now proceeds to have the exhibit
appropriately marked. Note, however, that
exhibits, under current rules, are to be marked
during the pre-trial.)

B. If the object found by the police investigator
was a knife that has no distinguishing features, the
examination would go something like the following:
Q: Officer, you said you saw a knife in the victim’s
bedroom?
A I did, Sir.

CHAPTER IV

AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
—A.OBJECT Evidence

(Rule 130)

133

Q: Would you please describe the knife you saw?

A It was of the kind you normally buy in a wet
market. It had a brown wooden handle and a
four-inch non-stainless blade.
Q: What did you do with the knife you found?
A: With my own Swiss knife, I scratched my
initials on the handle of the knife then placed
it inside the evidence plastic bag I always carry
with me.
(The witness is then shown a knife and
asked to identify it.) The witness answers:

A' It is the same knife, Sir. I can see the initials I
made. You can see them yourself.
(Counsel seeks permission of the court for
the marking of the knife as exhibit.)

In the above examples, showing the chain of custody
is not necessary since the witness could readily identify
the exhibit through its characteristics. However, where
the object is not readily identifiable, a chain of custody
must be shown. To avoid gaps in the chain of custody and
prevent further evidentiary objections, ideally, all the
persons who handled the object should be called to the
stand.
In the next illustration, the prosecution has to
establish the chain of custody since the substance
involved has no identifying characteristics. Assume
then that the fact situation is a murder case committed
allegedly by poisoning the victim. During a judicially
authorized search of the house of the accused, the police
found ten grams of what appears to be a toxic substance
in powder form inside a plastic sachet kept in the closet
of the accused. The police investigator who found the
substance is called first to testify. The following would be
the general thrust of the examination in the absence of a
law or rule providing for the contrary.

i34

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

Q: Officer, after finding the substance you said you
saw in the closet of the accused, what did you
do?

A: I immediately placed the substance inside a
plastic evidence bag then sealed it with a sealer
which our office provides for the purpose. The
evidence bag has in its opening a special nondetachable paper where you can write on after
sealing the bag. I wrote my name on it, the
date, the name of the accused, his address, and
the time I found it. In other words, Sir, I made
the proper markings on the evidence.
Q: Who were present if any, when you made the
markings on the evidence?

A: The accused, Sir and his parents.
Q: What did you do with the evidence after that?

A* Following our internal procedures, I logged the
evidence in our evidence log book and handed it
to the chemist in our crime laboratory. He gave
me a receipt for it.
Q: In what condition was the evidence bag when
you handed it to the chemist?

A It was sealed, Sir.
Ideally, the next witness would be the chemist who
would testify to having personally received the evidence bag
described by the investigator. The chemist would further
testify having removed the powdery substance or a portion
of it from the bag for examination by making an opening in
the bag without disturbing the previously sealed portion of
the bag, that after putting back the remainder in the bag and
sealing the portion of the bag which he had opened, he wrote
thereon the appropriate markings and put the evidence in
a locker safe. The chemist would testify, too, that, from the
time he kept the evidence, it was never handled by anyone

136

else and that, as it is shown in court, there appear no signs of
tampering.
Note: It has been held, however, that the forensic chemist,
if a public officer, need not testify to identify and describe how
the report was made. This is because the chemistry report is a
public document. As such, “it is admissible in evidence without
further proof of its due execution and genuineness” (Kummer
v. People, G.R. No. 174461, September 11, 2013). While the
chemist need not testify as to how his report was made, it would
be better practice to put the chemist on the stand to testify as to
his receipt of the substance, how he handled the evidence and
that the process he followed prevented the tampering of the
same. This practice would avoid any unnecessary evidentiary
objections from the adverse counsel.
Chain of custody in drug cases (Bar 2011)

1. In the Philippines, the confiscation and seizure of
drugs require a stringent specific procedure to establish the
chain of custody. The required procedure is embodied in Sec.
21, Art. II of R.A. No. 9165, as amended by RA. No. 10640.
2. Section 1(b) of the Dangerous Drugs Board
Regulation No. 1, Series of 2002 (in relation to Sec. 81[b] of
R.A. No. 9165), which implements RA. No. 9165, defines
“chain of custody" as follows:
“b. ‘Chain of Custody1 means the duly recorded
authorized movements and custody of seized drugs or
controlled chemicals or plant sources of dangerous drugs
or laboratory equipment of each stage, from the time of
seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic laboratory to
safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction. Such
record of movements and custody of seized item shall
include the identity and signature of the person who held
temporary custody of the seized item, the date and time
when such transfer of custody were made in the course
of safekeeping and use in court as evidence, and the final
disposition” (People u. Gayuso, G.R. No. 206590, March
27, 2017; See also Casona P. People, G.R. No. 179757,

3. Showing compliance with the rule on the chain of
custody involves testimony of every link in the chain from
the confiscation of the illegal drugs to its receipt in the forensic
laboratory up to its presentation in court. It is necessary that
every person who touched the seized items describe how and
from whom he or she received it; where and what happened
to it while in the possession of the witness; its condition when
received and at the time it was delivered to the next link in
the chain (People v. Gajo, G.R. No. 21 7026, January 22, 2018).

Procedure in the handling of seized drugs to establish the
chain of custody
1. The specific procedures to be followed in the custody
and handling of seized dangerous drugs are provided for in
Sec. 21, Art. II of RA No. 9165, as amended by R.A. No. 10640.

In summary form, the procedure requires the following:
(a) The apprehending team having initial custody
and control of the dangerous drugs shall, immediately
after seizure and confiscation, conduct a physical
inventory of the seized items and photograph the same.
(b) The inventory and photograph shall be taken
in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom
such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her
representative or counsel, with an elected public official
and a representative of the National Prosecution Service
or the media who shall be required to sign the copies of
the inventory and be given a copy thereof.
(c) The physical inventory and photograph shall
be conducted at the place where the search warrant is
served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest
office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is
practicable, in case of warrantless seizures.
(d) Within twenty-four (24) hours upon the
confiscation or seizure of the drugs, the same shall

be submitted to the PDEA Forensic Laboratory for a
qualitative and quantitative examination.
(e) The forensic laboratory examiner is required
to issue within twenty-four (24) hours after the receipt
of the drugs, a certification of the forensic laboratory
examination results which shall be done under.
(f) After the filing of the criminal case, the court
shall, within seventy-two (72) hours, conduct an ocular
inspection of the confiscated drugs, and through the
PDEA shall within twenty-four (24) hours proceed with
the destruction of the same in the presence of the accused
or the person from whom such drugs were confiscated,
his representative or counsel, a representative from the
media and the DOJ, civil society groups and any elected
public official.
(g) The Dangerous Drugs Board shall then issue a
sworn certification as to the fact of destruction or burning
of the substances. The certification shall be submitted to
the court. Also to be submitted are the representative
samples of the substances in the custody of the PDEA
Such samples shall be of a minimum quantity as
determined by the Board.
2. Note that the law requires the apprehending team
having initial custody of the drugs to conduct a physical
inventory of the drugs as well as to photograph the same. Such
acts are to be done immediately and in the presence of the
persons enumerated in the law as witnesses. Such persons are
required to sign the copies of the inventory and shall each be
given a copy of the same.
As to when the physical inventory and photography
shall be conducted, the Court made a distinction between
R.A. No. 9165 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations
(IRR). In seizures covered by search warrants, the physical
inventory and photograph must be conducted at the place
where the search warrant was served. On the other hand, in
case of warrantless seizures, such as a buy-bust operation,

138

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

the physical inventory and photography shall be done at the
nearest police station or office of the apprehending officer/
team, whichever is practicable (People v. Ramirez, G.R. No.
225690, January 17, 2018; See also People v. Bobotiok, Jr.,
G.R No. 237804, July 4, 2018; For further readings, see People
u. Jamila, G.R. No. 206398, November 5, 2018);
3. The alleged offender or his/her representative or
counsel shall be allowed to personally observe all of the above
proceedings. His presence shall not constitute an admission of
guilt. However, after having been duly notified in accordance
with law and said alleged offender or accused refuses or
fails to appoint a representative within 72 hours before the
actual burning or destruction of the evidence in question,
the Secretary of Justice shall appoint a member of the public
attorney’s office to represent the former (Sec. 21(6], R.A. No.
9165; See also Valleno v. People, G.R. No. 192050, January
9, 2013; For further readings, see People v. Ceralde, G.R. No.
228894, August 7, 2017; People v. Tomawis, G.R. No. 228890,
April 18, 2018).
Links in the chain of custody
1. Since it is called a chain, there must be links to
the chain. The links are the people who actually handled or
had custody of the object. Each of the links in the chain must
show how he received the object, how he handled it to prevent
substitution, and how it was transferred to another. Each of
the handlers of the evidence is a link in the chain and must
testify to make the foundation complete. This is the ideal way
to show the chain of custody.

2. Jurisprudence identified the links that the
prosecution must establish in the chain of custody in a buy¬
bust situation to be as fofiows:

First, the seizure and marking of the confiscated
drugs recovered from the accused, if practicable, by the
apprehending officer;
Second, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the
apprehending officer to the investigating officer;

CHAPTER IV

AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
—A.OBJECT

139

(Rule 130)

Third, the turnover by the investigating officer of
the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory
examination; and

Fourth, the turnover and submission of the marked
illegal drug by the forensic chemist to the court (See
People v. Kamad, 610 SCRA 295, 307-308 and cited in
People v. Dahil, G.R. No. 212196, January 12, 2015;
People u. Gayuso, G.R. No. 206590, March 27, 2017;
People v. Del Mundo, G.R. No. 208095, September 20,
2017; People v. Gajo, G.R. No. 217026, January 22, 2018;
People v. Suarez, G.R. No. 223141, June 6, 2018; People
v. Asjali, G.R. No. 216430, September 3, 2018; People u.
Tumangong, G.R. No. 227015, November 26, 2018).
Importance of the marking of the evidence

1. It must be noted that “marking” is not found in
R.A. No. 9165, as amended. Marking of the evidence is not
also specifically mentioned in the law’s implementing rules
and regulations. It is different from the inventory-taking and
photography under Sec. 21 of the said law. However, long
before Congress passed R.A. No. 9165, the Supreme Court had
consistently held that failure of the authorities to immediately
mark the seized drugs would cast reasonable doubt on the
authenticity of the corpus delicti (See People v. Dahil, G.R. No.
212196, January 12, 2015; For further readings, see People v.
Reyes, G.R. No. 219953, April 23, 2018).

“Crucial in proving the chain of custody is the marking
of the seized drugs or other related items immediately after
they had been seized from the accused. ‘Marking’ means the
placing by the apprehending officer or the poseur-buyer of
his/her initials and signature on the items seized. Marking
after seizure is the starting point in the custodial link;
hence, it is vital that the seized contraband be immediately
marked because succeeding handlers of the specimens will
use the markings as reference. The marking of the evidence
serves to separate the marked evidence from x x x all other
similar or related evidence from the time they are seized

EVIDENCE

140

CHAPTER IV

(The Bar Lectures Series)

from the accused until they are disposed of at the end of the
criminal proceedings, thus, preventing switching, planting or
contamination of evidence” (People v. Dahil, G.R. No. 212196,
January 12, 2015; People v. Gayuso, G.R. No. 206590, March
27, 2017; See also People v. Ramirez, G.R. No. 225690, January
17, 2018; See also People u. Veedor, Jr., G.R. No. 223525,
June 25, 2018). The marking upon confiscation or recovery of
the dangerous drugs or related items is indispensable in the
preservation of their integrity and evidentiary value (People
v. Asjali, G.R. No. 216430, September 3, 2018; For additional
readings, see People v. Bailes, G.R. No. 226143, November 21,
2018).
2. RA No. 9165 is silent on when marking should be
done. The Court, however, ruled that the marking should be
done in the presence of the apprehended violator immediately
upon confiscation to truly ensure that they are the same items
that enter the chain of custody (People v. Ramirez, G.R. No.
225690, January 17, 2018; For further readings, see also
People v. Torio, G.R. No. 225780, December 3, 2018).
The immediate marking upon confiscation or recovery of
the dangerous drugs or related items is indispensable in the
preservation of their integrity and evidentiary value (People
v. Jamila, G.R. No. 206398, November 5, 2018; For further
readings, see also People v. Veedor, Jr., G.R. No. 223525, June
25, 2018).
Effect of non-compliance with Sec. 21 of R.A. No. 9165, as
amended; prosecution has burden of proof

As a rule, non-compliance with the requirements
of Sec. 21 of RA No. 9165, as amended by RA. No. 10640,
casts doubt on the integrity of the seized items and creates
reasonable doubt on the guilt of the accused (People v.
Binasing, G.R. No. 221439, July 4, 2018). Such circumstance
shall, most likely, lead to the acquittal of the accused.
2. However, non-compliance with the procedures set by
Sec. 21 would not ipso facto render the seizure and custody
over the drugs as void and invalid. The relevant provision
1.

AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
—AOBJECT
Object Evidence (Rule 130)

141

declares that “x x x [N]oncompliance of these requirements
under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the
evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved
by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and
invalid such seizures and custody over said items x x x.”
Case law also holds that the failure to comply with the
required procedures does not necessarily render the arrest
of the accused illegal or the items seized/confiscated from
him inadmissible. What is essential is the preservation of
the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items
(See People v. Pundugar, G.R. No. 214779, February 7, 2018;
See also People v. Lim, G.R. No. 231989, September 4, 2018;
People v. Jamila, G.R. No. 206398, November 5, 2018; People
v. Bailes, G.R. No. 226143, November 21, 2018; See also People
v. Torio, G.R. No. 225780, December 3, 2018).
The prosecution bears the burden of proof to show a valid
cause for non-compliance with the procedure laid down in
Sec. 21 of R.A. No. 9165, as amended. Its failure to follow the
procedure must be adequately explained and must be proven
as a fact (People v. Seneres, G.R. No. 231008, November 5,
2018; People v. Bailes, G.R. No. 226143, November 21, 2018).
3. By way of summary, for the seized items to be
admissible despite non-compliance with the chain of custody
mandated by law, the.law requires the prosecution to establish
the following:
(a) the non-compliance must be because of
justifiable grounds; and
(b) the apprehending officer/team must have
properly preserved the integrity and evidentiary value of
the seized items (See also People v. Flor, G.R. No. 216017,
January 19, 2018; See also People v. Suarez, G.R. No.
223141, June 6, 2018; People v. Bailes, G.R. No. 226143,
November 21, 2018; See also People v. Malana, G.R. No.
233747, December 5, 2018).

The above rule is a result of the recognition that
strict adherence to the chain of custody is not always possible
4.

142

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

and, as such, is not always expected. As the Court put it: “A
testimony about a perfect chain is not always the standard as
it is almost always impossible to obtain an unbroken chain”
(People v. Cutara, G.R No. 224300, June 7, 2017).

For instance, there may be times when the making
of an immediate physical inventory and photograph of the
confiscated items may be justified when (1) their attendance
was impossible because the place of arrest was a remote area;
(2) their safety during the inventory and photograph of the
seized drugs was threatened by an immediate retaliatory
action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/
her behalf; (3) the elected official themselves were involved
in the punishable acts sought to be apprehended; (4) earnest
efforts to secure the presence of the required witnesses within
the period required under Art. 125 of the Revised Penal Code
prove futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who
face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention; or
(5) time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations,
which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the
law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required
witnesses even before the offenders could escape (People
v. Sipin, G.R. No. 224290, June 11, 2018). Common reason
suggests that, in such situations, the seizure and custody
of the dangerous substances should not be rendered void or
invalid by the non-compliance with the legal requirements.
However, for this rule to apply, the State is required, first,
to tender a credible explanation for any non-compliance
of the affirmative safeguards required by Sec. 21 of the
Comprehensive Drugs Act of 2002. “A sheer statement that
representatives were unavailable without so much as an

explanation on whether serious attempts were employed to
look for other representatives, given the circumstances is to
be regarded as a flimsy excuse” (People v. Ramos, G.R. No.
233744, February 28, 2018).

If it does not discharge such obligation, then the evidence
of guilt is necessarily suspect. Proving that the integrity and
evidentiary value of the seized items were preserved by the

CHAPTER IV -OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
A Object Evidence (Rule 130)

143

apprehending officers will not come into play if the seizing
officers did not offer justifications for the lapses committed
(See Casona v. People, G.R. No. 179757, September 13, 2017;
For further readings, see People v. Alvaro, G.R. No. 225596,
January 10, 2018). In which case, the prosecution loses the
benefit of invoking the presumption of regularity (See People
v. Asjali, G.R. No. 216430, September 3, 2018). (Bar 2011)
The lack of any justification tendered by the arresting officers
for any lapses in the documentation of the chain of custody
of confiscated dangerous drugs warrants the acquittal of the
accused on the ground of reasonable doubt (People v. Calates,
G.R. No. 214759, April 4, 2018; For further readings, see People
v. Torio, G.R. No. 225780, December 3, 2018). Judicial reliance
on the presumption of regularity in the performance of official
duty despite the lapses in the procedures undertaken by the
agents of the law is fundamentally flawed because the lapses
themselves are affirmative proofs of irregularity (People v.
Sipin, G.R. No. 224290, June 11, 2018).
5. Jurisprudential pronouncements have emphasized
that, “The State, not the accused, has the heavy burden
of justifying at the trial, the lapses or gaps in the chain of
custody. Without the justification, the chain of custody is not
shown to be unbroken; hence, the integrity of the evidence
of the corpus delicti was not preserved. The acquittal of the
accused should follow" (People v. Geronimo, G.R. No. 180447,
August 23, 2017; People v. Veedor, Jr., G.R. No. 223525, June
25, 2018).

DNA evidence

1. In a case where the admissibility of DNA testing as
a means for determining paternity has become the focal issue
in controversy for the first time, the Supreme Court described
DNA in the following words:
“DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a molecule that
encodes the genetic information in all living organisms.
A person’s DNA is the same in each cell and it does
not change throughout a person’s lifetime; the DNA in

EVIDENCE

144

(The Bar Lectures Series)

CHAPTER IV -OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
A. Object Evidence (Rule 130)

a person’s blood is the same as the DNA found in his
saliva, sweat, bone, the root and shaft of hair, earwax,
mucus, urine, skin tissue and vaginal or rectal cells. Most
importantly, because of polymorphisms in human genetic
structure, no two individuals have the same DNA, with
the notable exception of identical twins" (Agustin u. Court
ofAppeals, 460 SCRA 315).

incriminating acts, verbal and written, by the putative father.
Consistent with the rulings of the era, the Court, as well as
the lower courts, decided against the defendant-father on
the basis of the incriminating letters written by him and not
because of any DNA testing or similar procedure.

2. Agustin has its roots in an action for support filed
by a mother and her son against the latter’s alleged biological
father who denied having sired the child. The plaintiffs then
moved for the issuance of an order directing all the parties
to submit themselves to DNA testing pursuant to Rule 28
(Physical and Mental Examination of Persons) of the Rules
of Court. The defendant opposed the motion by invoking his
constitutional right against self-incrimination. He, likewise,
moved for the dismissal of the complaint for lack of a cause
of action. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and
ordered the parties to submit themselves to DNA paternity
testing. The Court of Appeals later affirmed the trial court.

The Supreme Court, in upholding the order of the trial
court and the Court of Appeals requiring the petitioner to
submit himself for DNA testing, had the occasion to reiterate
its earlier yet novel stand that DNA testing is a valid means of
determining paternity. In Agustin, the Supreme Court briefly
sketched its past decisions on DNA testing which the Court
initially considered as not as accurate and authoritative as the
scientific forms of identification evidence such as fingerprints
(People v. Teehankee, Jr., 249 SCRA 54). The Supreme Court
admitted in Agustin that, in early cases, “[The Court’s] faith
in DNA testing . . was not quite so steadfast in the previous
decade.”
Earlier, in Pe Lim u. Court of Appeals, 270 SCRA 1, also
a case for support filed by the mother in behalf of her child
against the supposed natural father, the Court cautioned
against the use of DNA evidence because, as a relatively new
science, it has not yet been accorded official recognition by
Philippine courts and held that paternity would still have
to be resolved by such conventional evidence as the relevant

.

145

3. In 2001, however, the Supreme Court showed signs
up to DNA evidence, in Tijing v. Court of Appeals,
opening
of
17,
when it recognized the existence of the facility
SCRA
354
(UP-NSRI DNA Analysis Laboratory) and expertise in using
DNA test for identification and parentage testing. Although
acknowledging that the test is still open to challenge being
a novel scientific technique, the Supreme Court, in Tijing,
categorically declared that “eventually, courts should not
hesitate to rule on the admissibility of DNA evidence . . .
courts should apply the results of science when competently
obtained in aid of situations presented, since to reject said
result is to deny progress. Though it is not necessary in this
case to resort to DNA testing, in the future, it would be useful
to all concerned in the prompt resolution of parentage and
identity issues."
4. One year after Tijing, in what could be considered as
a landmark decision, the Supreme Court in People v. Vallejo,
382 SCRA 192 (2002), a rape-slay case of a nine-year old girl,
admitted in evidence the DNA samples of the victim which
were found in the bloodstained garments of the accused.
Vaginal swabs taken from the victim were also admitted and
were found to show the DNA profile of the accused who was
subsequently convicted. Vallejo is considered by the Court
to be the “first real breakthrough of DNA as admissible and
authoritative evidence in Philippine jurisprudence." From
a mere recognition of the existence of DNA testing, Vallejo
moved towards an open use of DNA evidence in deciding cases.
Vallejo adopted the following guidelines to be used by courts
in assessing the probative value of DNA evidence:

(a) How the samples were collected;
(b) How they were handled;

(c) The possibility of contamination of the samples;

EVIDENCE

146

(The Bar Lectures Series)

CHAPTER IV

AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
—AOBJECTEvidence
Object

(d) The procedure followed in analyzing the
samples;
(e) Whether the proper standards and procedure
were followed in conducting the tests; and

(f) The qualification of the analyst who conducted
the test. (Bar 2009, 2010)

In People v. Janson, 400 SCRA 584, the importance of
DNA evidence was, likewise, recognized although the accused,
who was charged with rape, was acquitted because of doubts
as to who the real malefactor was. Here, the Court lamented
the lack of DNA evidence as a means to still the Court’s doubts.
In Tecson v. COMELEC, 424 SCRA 277, the Court
acknowledged the weight of DNA evidence when the Court
was faced with the issue of filiation of Fernando Poe, Jr. Any
doubt as to filiation or paternity, according to the Court,
would have been cleared up by a positive match through DNA
testing.

5. Following the trail blazed by Vallejo, the Supreme
Court in 2004 in People v. Yatar, 428 SCRA 504, May 19, 2004,
relied on evidence, including DNA evidence, in affirming the
conviction of the accused for rape with homicide when the
test showed that a match existed between the DNA profile
of the semen found in the victim and the DNA profile of the
blood sample given by the accused. Yatar also made a lengthy
discussion on DNA, the process of DNA testing and the
reasons for its admissibility. Yatar significantly upheld the
constitutionality of compulsory DNA testing and rejected the
contention that it would infringe on the constitutional right
against self-incrimination. The case significantly and clearly
recognized DNA testing and the admissibility of its results as
evidence.
6. A clear acknowledgment of the importance of DNA
evidence is exemplified in the later case of In re Estate of
Rogelio Ong v. Diaz, 540 SCRA 480. The case originated in
a complaint for compulsory recognition and support filed by
a minor represented by her mother. The defendant, Rogelio

147

(Rule 130)

Ong, died during the pendency of his appeal. Amidst the
protestation of the estate-petitioner for DNA testing because
of the death of the defendant, the Court, invoking the newlypromulgated rules on DNA evidence, held that the test may
provide the definitive key to the resolution of the issue and
even if the defendant had already passed away, biological
samples could be obtained for the testing. . . [E]ven [the]
death of Rogelio cannot bar the conduct of DNA testing." The
Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals
remanding the case to the trial court for DNA testing.
Rules on DNA evidence

1. The Rule on DNA Evidence (referred to in this work
as RDE) was promulgated by the Supreme Court through
A.M. 06-11-05-SC and, in accordance with Sec. 14 thereof
took effect on October 15, 2007, following publication in a
newspaper of general circulation.
2.
apply?

In what situation does the Rule on DNA Evidence

The Rule on DNA Evidence is the primary rule to be
applied whenever DNA evidence is offered, used, or proposed
to be offered or used as evidence in:
(a) criminal actions;
(b) civil actions; and
(c) special proceedings (Sec. 1, RDE).

When a matter is not specifically governed by the Rule
on DNA Evidence, the Rules of Court and other pertinent
provisions of law on evidence shall apply (Sec. 2, RDE).
3.

What is (a) DNA? (b) DNA profile? (c) DNA evidence?
(a) DNA refers to deoxyribonucleic acid which is
the chain of molecules found in every nucleated cell of
the body (Sec. 3[b], RDE).
(b) DNA “profile” is the genetic information derived
from DNA testing of biological samples obtained from a

EVIDENCE

148

(The Bar Lectures Series)

person where such biological sample is clearly identifiable
as originating from that person (Sec. 3[d], RDE).

(c) The totality of the DNA profiles, results and
other genetic information directly generated from
the DNA testing of biological samples is called “DNA
evidence" (Sec. 3[c], RDE).
4. What is the significance of DNA?
The significance lies in the uniqueness of the totality of
of a person. It is a scientific fact that the totality of
DNA
the
an individual’s DNA is unique for the individual, except for
identical twins (Sec. 3[b], RDE).
5.

How may an order for a DNA testing be obtained?

A person who has a legal interest in the litigation may file
an application for DNA testing order before the appropriate
court, at any time (Sec. 4, RDE).
The order for a DNA testing shall not, however, be issued
as a matter of course and from the mere fact that the person
requesting for the testing has a legal interest in the litigation.
For the order to be issued, there must be a further showing

that:
(a) A biological sample exists that has relevance to

the case;
(b) The biological sample (i) was not previously
subjected to the DNA testing requested; or (ii) if it was
previously subjected to DNA testing, the results may
require confirmation for good reasons;
(c) The DNA testing uses a scientifically-valid
technique;

(d) The DNA testing has the scientific potential to
produce new information that is relevant to the proper
resolution of the case; and
(e) The existence of other factors, if any, which the
court may consider as potentially affecting the accuracy
and integrity of the DNA testing (Sec. 4, RDE).

CHAPTER IV -OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
A. Object Evidence (Rule 130)

149

Finding that the above requirements have been complied
with, the court shall now issue an order, if appropriate, to
(a) take biological samples from any person or crime scene
evidence; and (b) impose reasonable conditions on the testing
to protect the integrity of the biological sample and the liability
of the test results (Sec. 5, RDE).

Note: The court may motu proprio order a DNA testing
(Sec. 4, RDE).
6. Is a court order always required before undertaking
a DNA testing?
It is not always required. The last paragraph of Sec. 4 of
the RDE allows a testing without a prior court order if done
before a suit or proceeding is commenced at the request of
any party, including law enforcement agencies. This also
means that a litigation need not exist prior to DNA testing.
Thus, a court order shall be required only if there is a pending
litigation, but not before the litigation.
7. Is the order of the court granting a DNA testing
appealable?

It is not appealable and is immediately executory. Section
5 of the RDE clearly provides that, “An order granting the
DNA testing shall be immediately executory and shall not be
appealable...”
8. What then is the remedy against the court order if it
is not appealable?

The remedy is a petition for certiorari under Rule
65 of the Rules of Court but under Sec. 5 “any petition for
certiorari initiated therefrom shall not, in any way, stay
the implementation thereof, unless a higher court issues an
injunctive order" (Sec. 5, RDE).

9. Is there an automatic admission of the DNA evidence
obtained in the testing?
There is none. By the terms of Sec. 5 of the RDE, the
grant of a DNA testing application shall not be construed

EVIDENCE

150

(The Bar Lectures Series)

as an automatic admission into evidence of any component
of the DNA evidence that may be obtained as a result of the
testing. This necessarily means that the court will still have to
evaluate the probative value of the proposed evidence before
its admission.
The determination of the probative value of the DNA
evidence rests upon sound judicial assessment taking into
consideration the following matters:
(a) The chain of custody, including how the
biological samples were collected, how they were handled,
and the possibility of contamination of the samples;
(b) The DNA testing methodology, including
the procedure followed in analyzing the samples, the
advantages and disadvantages of the procedure, and
compliance with the scientifically-valid standards in
conducting the tests;
(c) The forensic DNA laboratory, including its
accreditation and the qualification of the analyst who
conducted the test; if the laboratory is not accredited,
the court shall consider the relevant experience of the
laboratory in forensic casework and its credibility shall

be properly established; and
(d) The reliability of the testing result (Sec. 7,
RDE).

10. If a person has already been convicted under a final
and executory judgment, may he still avail of DNA testing?
(Bar 2012)

He may still have DNA testing. The test after his conviction
is termed a “post-conviction” DNA testing. Significantly, Sec.
6 of the RDE allows a post-conviction DNA testing. It may be
available to (a) the prosecution, or (b) the person convicted by
a final and executory judgment, provided that the following
requirements are met:
(a) a biological sample exists;
(b) such sample is relevant to the case; and

L

CHAPTER IV

AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
—AOBJECTEvidence
Object

151

(Rule 130)

(c) the testing would probably result in the reversal
or modification of the judgment of conviction (Sec. 6,
RDE).

11. Is a court order required for a post DNA testing?

Section 6 of the RDE is clear. It may be available "without
need of prior court order.”
12. What remedy is available to the convict if the results
of the post DNA testing are favorable to him?

If the results of the DNA testing are favorable to the
convict, he may file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with
the court of origin. The court shall then conduct a hearing and
in case the court finds, after due hearing, that the petition
is meritorious, it shall reverse or modify the judgment of
conviction and order the release of the convict, unless his
detention is justified for a lawful cause (Sec. 10, RDE).
The petition shall be filed with the court of origin as a
rule. However, the rule also allows the petition to be filed
either with the Court of Appeals or with the Supreme Court, or
with any member of said courts. A hearing may be conducted
by the latter courts or by any member thereof or instead of
conducting a hearing, may instead remand the petition to the
court of origin and issue the appropriate orders (Sec. 10, RDE).

Note that under Sec. 10, the petition for a writ of habeas
corpus may also be filed by the prosecution.
13. Are the DNA profiles of a person open to public
scrutiny?
They are not. DNA profiles and all the results or other ’
information obtained from DNA testing are confidential.
Whoever discloses, utilizes or publishes in any form any
information concerning a DNA profile without the proper

The person from whom the biological sample was taken

person designated in his request. This request, however, must
be in writing, verified and filed with the court that allowed the
DNA testing (Sec. 11, RDE).
14. The trial court is mandated to preserve the DNA
evidence in its totality, including all biological samples, DNA
profiles and results or other genetic information obtained from
DNA testing in accordance with Sec. 12 of the RDE.

Paraffin tests
1. Paraffin tests, in general, have been considered as

inconclusive by the Court because scientific experts concur in
the view that paraffin tests have proved extremely unreliable
in use. The tests can only establish the presence or absence
of nitrates or nitrites on the hand, but the tests alone cannot
determine whether the source of the nitrates or nitrites was
the discharge of a firearm.
The presence of nitrates should be taken only as an
indication of a possibility, or even a probability, but not of
infallibility that a person has fired a gun, since nitrates are
also admittedly found in substances other than gunpowder.

CHAPTER IV

AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
—A.OBJECTEvidence

153

(Rule 130)

A person who tests positive may have handed one or more
substances with the same positive reaction for nitrates such
as explosives, fireworks, fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, tobacco
and leguminous plants. The argument that the negative
result of gunpowder nitrates from the paraffin test conducted,
shows an absence of physical evidence that one fired a gun,
is untenable as it is possible for one to fire a gun and yet be
negative for the presence of nitrates as when the hands are
washed before the test (People v. Cajumocan., 430 SCRA 311;
People v. Baconguis, 41 7 SCRA 66).
A person who uses tobacco may alsohave nitrate or nitrite
deposits on his hands since these substances are present in
the products of combustion of tobacco (Revita v. People, 570
SCRA 356).
2. The negative findings of a paraffin test do not
conclusively show that a person did not discharge a gun, if
he fired a gun with a glove on, or if he thoroughly washed
his hands thereafter. Besides, a paraffin test is not conclusive
owing to several factors like wind direction, firing at a hard
object, using a long barrel or a low caliber gun and profuse
perspiration (People v. Baltazar, 352 SCRA 678; People v.
Galvez, 519 SCRA 521; People v. Buduhan, 561 SCRA 337).
Polygraph tests (Lie detector tests)
1. A polygraph test operates on the principle that
stress causes physiological changes in the body which can be
measured to indicate whether the subject of the examination is
telling the truth. During an examination in which a polygraph
is used, sensors are attached to the subject so that the
polygraph can mechanically record the subject’s physiological
responses to a series of questions.

2. Courts, accordingly and uniformly, reject the results
of polygraph tests when offered in evidence for the purpose of
establishing the guilt or innocence of one accused of a crime
because it has not yet attained scientific acceptance as a
reliable and accurate means of ascertaining truth or deception

B. Documentary Evidence
(Rule 130)
Meaning of documentary evidence (document as evidence)

1. Another category of evidence is documentary
evidence. Documents, as evidence, do not exclusively refer to
writings. They may refer to any other material like objects as
long as it contains letters, words, numbers, figures, symbols or
other modes of written expression and offered as proof of their
contents. There are, therefore, two categories of documents as

evidence, namely:
(a) writings; or
(b) any other material containing modes of written
expressions.

The relevant provision provides:
"SEC. 2. Documentary evidence. — Documents as
evidence consist of writings, recordings, photographs
or any material containing letters, words, sounds,
numbers, figures, symbols, or their equivalent, or other
modes of written expression offered as proof of their
contents. Photographs include still pictures, drawings,
stored Images, x-rav films, motion pictures or videos.”

2. Under the first category are those instantly
recognizable documents like written contracts and wills. Under
the second category are those which are not traditionally
considered as writings but are actually objects which contain
modes of written expression.

However, being writings or materials containing modes
of written expression do not ipso facto make such materials
documentary evidence. For such writings or materials to be
deemed documentary evidence, the same must be offered
as proof of their contents. If offered for some other purpose,

—

CHAPTER IV OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
B. Documentary Evidence (Rule 130)

166

the writings or materials would not be deemed documentary
evidence but merely object evidence.
When a contract is presented in court to show that it
exists or simply to establish its condition, it is not offered to
prove its contents. The contract, therefore, is not considered
documentary evidence, but object or real evidence.
3. Under the 2019 amendments, recordings,
photographs, or any material containing sounds or the
equivalent of numbers, figures and or symbols were included
in the enumeration of what is considered to be documentary
evidence. Further, photographs encompass still pictures,
drawings, stored images, x-ray films, motion pictures or
videos, which were traditionally considered as object evidence.
Documents under the Rules on Electronic Evidence (Bar
2009)
1. Section 1(h), Rule 2 of the Rules on Electronic
Evidence defines an ‘electronic document’ as follows:
“(h) ‘Electronic document' refers to information or
the representation of information, data, figures, symbols
or other modes of written expressions, described or
however represented, by which a right is established
or an obligation extinguished, or by which a fact may
be proved and affirmed, which is received, recorded,
transmitted, stored, processed, retrieved or produced
electronically. It includes digitally signed documents
and any print-out or output, readable by sight or other
means, which accurately reflects the electronic data
message or electronic document For purposes of these
Rules, the term ‘electronic document* may be used
interchangeably with ‘electronic data message.' ”

2. An electronic document, also known as electronic
data message (Sec. Ifh], Rule 2, Rules on Electronic Evidence),
does not only refer to the information itself. It also refers to
the representation of that information. Whether it be the
information itself or its representation, for the document
to be deemed ‘electronic,’ it is important that it be received.

recorded, transmitted, stored, processed, retrieved or produced

4. Under Sec. 1, Rule 5 of the Rules on Electronic
Evidence, the person offering the document has the burden to

It is submitted that the rule does not absolutely require
that the electronic document be initially generated or
produced electronically. A contract, for instance, prepared
through the traditional written way, may be converted to
an electronic document if transmitted or received or later
recorded electronically.
The rule also emphasizes that an electronic document is
one that may be used for any of the following purposes:
(a) To establish a right;
(b) To extinguish an obligation; or
(c) To prove or affirm a fact (Sec. l[h], Rule 2, Rules

prove its authenticity. Thus:

on Electronic Evidence).

3.

Electronic documents are the functional equivalents
of paper-based documents. Sec. 1 of Rule 3 of the Rules on
Electronic Evidence provides:
“Whenever a rule of evidence refers to the term of
writing, document, record, instrument, memorandum or
any other form of writing, such term shall be deemed
to include an electronic document as defined in these
Rules.”

Since an electronic document is the functional equivalent
of a paper-based document, whenever a rule of evidence
makes reference to the terms of a writing, document, record,
instrument, memorandum or any other form of writing, such
terms are deemed to include electronic documents (Sec. 1, Rule
3, Rules on Electronic Evidence). It is, therefore, but logical to
consider the rules on evidence in the Rules of Court, including
statutes containing rules on evidence, to be of suppletory
application to the Rules on Electronic Evidence in all matters
not specifically covered by the latter (Sec. 3, Rule 1, Rules on

Electronic Evidence). (Bar 2003, 2010)

—

“SECTION 1. Burden of proving authenticity.
The person seeking to introduce an electronic document
in any legal proceeding has the burden of proving its
authenticity in the manner provided in this Rule.”

5. The manner of authentication of an electronic
document is outlined under Sec. 2, Rule 5 of the Rules on
Electronic Evidence as follows:

—

“SEC. 2. Manner of authentication.
Before any
private electronic document offered as authentic is
received in evidence, its authenticity must be proved by
any of the following means:
(a) by evidence that it had been digitally signed
by the person purported to have signed the same; (Bar
2012)
(b) by evidence that other appropriate security
procedures or devices as may be authorized by the
Supreme Court or by law for authentication of electronic
documents were applied to the document; or
(c) by other evidence showing Its integrity and
reliability to the satisfaction of the Judge.”

Notice that the aforementioned rigorous requirements for
the authentication of an electronic document do not apply to
all electronic documents. Sec. 2 of Rule 5 will obviously apply
only when the document is a private electronic document and
the same is offered as an authentic document.
If the electronic document is offered simply for what it
is or for what it is claimed to be without regard to whether
or not it is authentic, Sec. 2 of Rule 5 finds no relevance. In
such a case, the electronic document has only to be identified
pursuant to the suppletory application of Sec. 20 of Rule 132
of the Rules of Court. Accordingly, under the said provision,

“Any other private document need only be identified as that

It would, therefore, be critical to remember that whenever a

which it is claimed to be.”

documentary evidence is involved, the original document rule,
parol evidence rule, and hearsay rule, or any one of these rules
may come into play. However, where the evidence is offered

6. When, for instance, a document is electronically
notarized, the manner of authentication under Sec. 2 of Rule
5 will not likewise apply. When so notarized, it is transformed
into a public document and is to be proved not in accordance
with the Rules on Electronic Evidence but in accordance with
the Rules of Court. The tenor of Sec. 3, Rule 5 of the Rules on
Electronic Evidence is enlightening:
“SEC. 3. Proofof electronically notarized document.

— A document electronically notarized in accordance

with the Rules promulgated by the Supreme Court shall
be considered as a public document and proved as a
notarial document under the Rules of Court."

Sec. 30 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Court provides for the
manner of proving notarial documents. In distinct terms, the
provision categorically states that, “Every instrument duly
acknowledged or proved and certified as provided by law, may
be presented in evidence without further proof, the certificate
of acknowledgment being prime facie evidence of the execution
of the instrument or document involved” (Italics supplied).
Evidentiary concepts Involved in the presentation of
documentary evidence

To be admissible, documentary evidence, like any other
evidence, must be relevant and competent. It is also subject
to general exclusionary rules such as the rule on hearsay,
original document (formerly best evidence) rule, and parol

evidence rule.
Thus, depending upon the specific purpose for which
the contents of the document is offered, there are certain
inevitable issues which may arise in connection with the
admissibility of the document aside from the issue of relevance.
Has the document been authenticated? Is it relevant? Is it the
original document? Is it a mere parol evidence and so must
be excluded? Is it hearsay and, therefore, must be rejected?

as object evidence, the original document rule, parol evidence
rule, and hearsay rule find no application.
Requisites for admissibility of documentary evidence

The following are the requisites for the admissibility of
documentary evidence:
(a) The document must be relevant;
(b) The evidence must be authenticated;

(c) The document must be authenticated by a
competent witness; and
(d) The document must be formally offered in
evidence.

1. Original Document Rule
(formerly Best Evidence Rule)
Meaning of the Original Document Rule, formerly “Best
Evidence Rule”

1. The original document rule, formerly known as the
“best evidence” rule, as embodied in Sec. 3 of Rule 130 of the
Rules of Court, as amended, provides:
“SEC. 3. Original document must be produced;
exceptions. — When the subject of Inquiry is the
contents of a document, writing, recording, photograph
or other record, no evidence shall be admissible other
than the original document itself, except in the following

cases:
(a) When the original la lost, or destroyed, or
cannot be produced in court, without bad faith on the
part of the offeror;
(b) When the original Is In the custody or under
the control of the party against whom the evidence is

160

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

offered, and the latter fails to produce it after reasonable
notice, or the original cannot be obtained bv local
judicial processes or procedures;

(c) When the original consists of numerous
accounts or other documents which cannot be examined
in court without great loss of time and the fact sought
to be established from them Is only the general result of
the whole; and
(d) When the original is a public record in the
custody of a public officer or is recorded in a public
office.

(e) When the original is not closelv-related to a
controlling issue,"

2. The term “best evidence,” as used prior to the term
“original document,” is a misnomer and has been a source of
misconception. It has often been misunderstood and given
a meaning it does not deserve. Despite the word “best,” the
rule does not proclaim itself as the highest and most reliable
evidence in the hierarchy of evidence. The term “best”
has nothing to do with the degree of its probative value in
relation to other types of evidentiary rules. It is not intended
to mean the “most superior” evidence. The only actual rule
that the “best evidence rule” denotes is the rule requiring the
production of the original writing. More accurately, it is the
“original document” rule or the “primary evidence” rule. In
order to address this misconception, the 2019 Amendments to
the Rules on Evidence have replaced the term “best evidence”
with “original document.”
3. The original document rule does not apply to all types
of evidence. It does not comprehend object and testimonial
evidence. It only applies when the evidence is documentary.
Also, it does not apply just because a document is offered in
evidence. The rule only covers situations in which the subject
of inquiry is the contents of the document. Subject to certain
exceptions, under the original document rule, when the
subject of inquiry relates to the contents of a document, no
evidence shall be admissible other than the original document

—

B. Documentary Evidence (Rule 130)

161

itself. In other words, one who wants to prove the contents of
a document need to present the original document. Where the
purpose of the offeror is one other than to prove the contents
of a document, compliance with the original document rule
is not necessary. The key, therefore, to the understanding of
the original document rule is simply to remember that the
rule cannot be invoked unless the contents of a writing is the
subject of judicial inquiry, in which case, the best evidence is
the original writing itself.
4. An early case ruled:
"x x x the rule-applies only where the content
of the document is the subject of the inquiry. Where
the issue is the execution or existence of the document
or the circumstances surrounding its execution, the
[original document] rule does not apply and testimonial
evidence is admissible.” (Arceo v. People, 495 SCRA 204;
Underscoring supplied).

5. The RTC, in one case, was sustained for admitting
in evidence mere copies of certain deeds. As held, the original
document rule applies only when the content of such
document is the subject of the inquiry. Where the issue is
only as to whether such document was actually executed, or
existed, or on the circumstances relevant to or surrounding its
execution, the original document rule does not apply and even
testimonial evidence is admissible. Any other substitutionary
evidence is, likewise, admissible without need to account for
the original (Chua Gaw v. Chua, 551 SCRA 505).

6. In a prosecution for ill-gotten wealth, the Republic
offered in evidence photocopies of certain documents to
prove the contents thereof which would implicate the
respondents. The Court categorically ruled that such offer
of mere photocopies violate the “best evidence” [now original
document] rule, which mandates that the evidence must be
the original document itself. The Republic, observed the Court,
did not even make an attempt to provide a plausible reason
why the originals were not presented and why the photocopies

162

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

B. Documentary Evidence (Rule 130)

163

should be admitted as secondary evidence (Republic v.
Marcos-Manotoc, 665 SCRA 367, 386, February 8, 2012). In
a similar vein, a mere photocopy of the Kasunduan cannot be
admitted to prove the contents thereof. The original document
rule requires that the highest available degree of proof must
be produced and for a documentary evidence, its contents
are best proved by the production of the evidence itself to the
exclusion of secondary or substitutionary evidence (Berboso u.
Cabral, G.R No. 204617, July 10, 2017).

record.” Paragraph (b) thereof was also amended to include
a situation where the original cannot be obtained by local
judicial processes or procedures, such as through a motion for
the production of a document or for the issuance of a subpoena
duces tecum. Under the new paragraph (e), presentation of
the original may be dispensed with if the same is not closely
related to a controlling issue in the case.

7. In an action against a taxpayer, the best evidence
obtainable under the then Sec. 16 of the 1977 NIRC, as
amended, does not include mere photocopies of records and
documents. The copies presented have no probative weight
and are mere scraps of paper. The copies cannot prove any
deficiency in the taxes of the taxpayer (Commissioner of
Internal Revenue u. Hantex Trading Co., Inc., 454 SCRA 301).
This is because inquiry as to the contents of the documents is
inevitable to prove the deficiency.
8. Where the issue is the contents of the document, such
contents are best proved by the production of the document
itself to the exclusion of secondary or substitutionary evidence
(Berboso v. Cabral, G.R. No. 204617, July 10, 2017).
9. In a disbarment case against a lawyer, where
the main charge depends on the accuracy, completeness
and authenticity of the documents submitted in evidence,
compliance with the original document rule cannot be
dispensed with (Goopio v. Maglalang, A.C. No. 10555, July
31, 2018). Although disciplinary proceedings against lawyers
are sui generis and not, in the strict sense, ordinary actions
where trials are held and the rules of procedure apply, the
rules on evidence cannot be shunted aside considering that
the exercise of one’s profession is at stake (Concepcion v. Atty.
Fandio, Jr., A.C. No. 3677, June 21, 2000).

1. The rationale behind the rule is the avoidance of
dangers of mistransmissions and inaccuracies of the contents
of the document (Goopio u. Maglalang, A.C. No. 10555, July
31, 2018). “The [original document] rule ensures that the
exact contents of a document are brought before the court. In
deeds, wills, and contracts, a slight variation in words may
mean a great deal of difference in the rights and obligations
of the parties. A substantial hazard of inaccuracy exists in
the human process of making a copy by handwriting or
typewriting x x x. The [original document] rule, likewise, acts
as an insurance against fraud. If a party is in the possession
of the best evidence in its place, the presumption naturally
arises that the better evidence is withheld for fraudulent
purposes that its production would expose and defeat. The
rule, likewise, protects against misleading inferences resulting
from the intentional or unintentional introduction of selected
portions of a larger set of writings” (Republic v. Mupas, G.R.
No. 181892, September 8, 2015).

10. Taking into account the revised definition of
documentary evidence, the first paragraph of Sec. 3 of Rule
130 now includes “writing, recording, photograph or other

Purpose of the rule (Bar 1994, 1998)

2. The theory, therefore, is that the copy of the original
is not as reliable as the latter because of possible inaccuracy
in the process of copying and the danger of erroneous
transmission of the original.

The above principle is reiterated, thus: The only actual
rule that the term “best evidence" denotes is the rule requiring
that the original of a writing must, as a general proposition,
be produced (EDSA-Shangri-La Hotel and Resort, Inc. v. BF
Corporation, 556 SCRA 25).

164

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

Waiver of the rule
The original document rule may be waived if not raised
in the trial. In one case, although the marriage certificate, the
marriage license, and other pieces of documentary evidence
were only photocopies, the fact that these have been examined
and admitted by the trial court, with no objections having
been made as to their authenticity and due execution, means
that these documents are deemed sufficient proof of the facts
contained therein (Sy v. Court of Appeals, 330 SCRA 550).
When document is merely collaterally In Issue

1. When a document is involved in the inquiry but the
document is only collaterally in issue or is not closely-related
to a controlling issue, the original document rule does not
apply. A document is collaterally in issue when the purpose
of introducing the document is not to establish its terms, but
to show facts that have no reference to its contents like its
existence, condition, execution or delivery.
2. If a witness testifies that the victim was writing a
letter when he was shot by the accused, the judge would likely
rule against the party who insists on the presentation of the
letter because it is not the subject of an important issue in the
case and, hence, merely collateral.
Also, if a witness testifies that he actually saw the debtor
tender payment of his obligation to the creditor, he need not
be required to produce the original promissory note evidencing
the debt because it is the act of payment which is the focal
point of the testimony, not the document. The document need
not be, likewise, presented when the witness merely testifies
to the delivery of a deed of sale by X to Y because proving
the contents of the document itself is not the purpose of the
testimony.

How to apply the original document rule
1. The first step in applying the original document
rule is to determine the matter inquired into. If the inquiry
involves a document, and its contents are the subject of that

—

CHAPTER IV OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
B. Documentary Evidence (Rule 130)

165

same inquiry, the original document rule applies and must,
therefore, be complied with. The procedural compliance of
the rule requires the presentation of the original document,
and not a copy of that document. So long as the original is
available, no other evidence can be substituted for the original
because the original is the “best evidence” and not the mere
copies or substitutes thereof.
To reiterate, the original document rule applies only
when the contents of the document is the subject of inquiry.
Where the issue is only as to whether such document was
actually executed, or exists, the original document rule does
not apply. In fact, testimonial evidence may be admissible
(Skunac Corp. v. Sylianteng, G.R. No. 205879, April 23, 2014;
Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Mendoza, G.R. No. 198799,
March 20, 2017).

2. Now what is to be done if, for one reason or another,
the original cannot be presented in evidence? If this happens,
the second step now comes into play. This step involves two
stages: (1) finding an adequate legal excuse for the failure to
present the original; and (2) presenting a secondary evidence
allowed by the Rules of Court.
If the rule were to be restated into a simple formula,
the rule would be: "Present the original, except when you can
justify its unavailability in the manner provided for by the
Rules of Court."
Illustrative applications of the original document rule

Illustration No. 1
In a case where counsel wants to show that a
marriage ceremony took place between H and W, the
following questions were asked:

Q: Mr. Witness, where were you on September 26,
2015 at around 7:30 in the evening?

A* I was in the Manila Cathedral attending the
wedding of H and W where I stood as a principal
sponsor.

EVIDENCE

Igg

(The Bar Lectures Series)

Q: Can you tell this Court what happened when
you were there?

A: There was a marriage ceremony officiated by
the parish priest for the marriage of H and W.
Opposing counsel objects at this stage:
“Objection, Your Honor! The original document
is the marriage contract!”

Should the court sustain the objection? No! The original
document rule does not apply. For the original document rule
to apply, two requisites must concur:
(a) The subject matter must involve a document;

and
(b) The subject of the inquiry is the contents of the
document.

The subject of the inquiry and response in the illustration
does not even involve a document. The evidence is purely
testimonial. Where the contents of a document are not in
issue, the original document rule cannot be invoked and
more so when the evidence does not involve a document. The
illustration merely involves an inquiry into an activity that
occurred in the presence of the witness. Thus, a witness may
testify as to an event he perceived. The wedding ceremony is an
event or a fact with an existence independent of any writing.
The ceremony was observed and perceived by the witness,
and one’s perception, if relevant to an issue in the case, is a
legitimate subject of a testimony. Thus, a witness may testify
that Pedro died in his presence without presenting a death
certificate. He may also testify that he traveled to Los Angeles
without necessarily presenting the plane ticket and that his
father gave him a car without presenting a deed of donation.
Illustration No. 2
Q: After the wedding ceremony Mr. Witness, what
happened, if any?
A: The priest asked all sponsors to sign a document.

Q: How about the priest?

A- He signed the document, Sir.
Q: By the way, what document did all of you sign?

A

The marriage contract, Sir.

The opposing counsel objects: “Objection, Your Honor!
The original document is the marriage contract. Counsel
should show the marriage contract.”
Should the objection be sustained? No! As in the first
illustration, the original document rule does not apply. While
it is conceded that a document is involved in the question and
response, the inquiry involved the existence and execution of
the marriage contract. An inquiry into these matters does not
bring the original document rule into operation, there being
no inquiry as to the contents of the document. In the words
of the Rules of Court, the original document rule applies only
when the subject of inquiry is the contents of a document (Sec.
3, Rule 130, Rules of Court). Thus, a witness may be asked
whether or not he sold his land in writing to another, and an
objection that the deed of sale is the best evidence of the sale
is improper because the testimony made no reference to the
contents of the deed.

It is always vital to remember that the original document
rule applies only when the purpose is to establish the contents
of a writing. When the evidence introduced concerns some
external fact about a writing like its existence, execution
or delivery, without reference to its terms, the rule cannot
be invoked (People v. Tandoy, 192 SCRA 28; 4 Wigmore on
Evidence, §1178, 1188; People v. Bago, 330 SCRA 1159 because
the writing is not a documentary evidence but a mere object

Here, counsel is trying to prove some contents in the marriage
contract through oral testimony without producing the
original document.
Meaning of “original” (Bar 1997, 2001)

1. Section 4 of Rule 130 elucidates on the concept of the
term “original,” and was originally worded thus:
“SEC. 4. Original of document. —
(a) The original of a document Is one the contents
of which are the subject of inquiry.

169

2. With the 2019 Amendments to the 1989 Revised
Rules on Evidence, Sec. 4 of Rule 130 now reads:
“SEC. 4. Original of document. —
(a) An "Original" of a document is the document
itself or anv counterpart intended to have the same
effect bv a person executing or issuing it. An "original"
of a photograph includes the negative or anv print
therefrom. If data is stored in a computer or similar
device, anv printout or other output readable bv sight or
other means, shown to reflect the data accurately, is an
“original."

(b) A “duplicate" is a counterpart produced
bv the same impression as the original, or from the
same matrix, or bv means of photography. Including
enlargements and miniatures, or bv mechanical or
electronic re-recording, or bv chemical reproduction,
or bv other equivalent techniques which accurately
reproduce the original.

(c) A duplicate is admissible to the same extent
as an original unless (11 a genuine question is raised
as to the authenticity of the original, or (2) In the
circumstances. It is unlust or inequitable to admit the
duplicate in lieu of the original,"

3. The layman’s concept refers to the original as the first
one written and from which mere copies are made, transcribed
or imitated. Accordingly, from this perspective, there can only
be one original. This is not, however, so under the Rules of
Court where there are instances when subsequent documents

CHAPTER IV— OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
B. Documentary Evidence (Rule 130)

171

are also regarded as originals. Under Section 4(a) of Rule
130, any counterpart intended to have the same effect by a
person executing or issuing it is also an original. For instance,
when a lawyer writes a pleading in two or more copies which
are executed at the same time, with identical contents,
each document is an original So are writings with identical
contents made by printing, mimeographing, lithography and
other similar methods executed at the same time. Thus, each
newspaper sold in the stand is an original in itself.

6. A signed carbon copy or duplicate of a document
executed at the same time as the original is known as a
duplicate original and maybe introduced in evidence without
accounting for the non-production of the original. When a
document is in two or more copies executed at or about the
same time, with identical contents, all such copies are equally
regarded as originals (Skunac Corp. v. Sylianteng, G.R. No.
205879, April 23, 2014).

4. American authorities declare that where a document
is executed in duplicate or multiplicate form, each one of the
parts is primary evidence of the contents of the document, and
the other need not be produced. In such a case, each is deemed
an original (Anglo-American Packing & Provision Co. v.
Cannon, 31 Fed. 313 cited in Jones on Evidence, §209). The rule
observed in the Philippines is the same. Thus, where carbon
sheets are inserted between two or more sheets of writing so
that the writing of a contract upon the outside sheet, including
the signature of the party to be charged thereby, produces a
facsimile upon the sheets beneath, such signature being thus
reproduced by the same stroke of pen which made the surface
or exposed impression, all of the sheets so written on are
regarded as originals and either of them may be introduced
in evidence without accounting for the nonproduction of the
others (Capital Shoes Factory, Ltd. v. Traveller Kids, Inc., 736
SCRA 489).

the company for transmission (Jones on Evidence, §210 citing
Conyers v. Postal Cable Co., 92 Ga. 619, 19 S.E. 253 Am. St.
Rep. 100). If the suit is for damages by the sender against
the telegraph company because of delay in transmission, the
original would be the message as received by the recipient
(Jones on Evidence, §210 citing Collins v. Western Union TeL
Co., 145 Ala. 41241 So. 160, 8ann. Cas. 268).

5. Under the Rules of Court, as amended, “the original
of a document is the document itself or any counterpart
intended to have the same effect by a person executing or
issuing it.” (Sec. 4[a], Rule 130, Rules of Court). Thus, when the
rule speaks of an “original,” it obviously does not refer to the
original of an object evidence but an original of a documentary
evidence. The amended definition of an original under Sec.
4(a) of Rule 130 also provides that the original of a photograph
includes the negative or any print therefrom. Further, if data
is stored in a computer or similar device, any printout or other
output readable by sight or other means, shown to reflect the
data accurately, is an original.

7.

8. The new paragraph (c) is a virtual reproduction
of Sec. 2, Rule 4 of the Rules on Electronic Evidence which
provides when a duplicate cannot be treated to the same
extent in terms of admissibility as an original, i.e„ (1) when
a genuine question is raised as to the authenticity of the
original, or (2) when under the circumstances, it is unjust or
inequitable to admit the duplicate in lieu of the original.
Originals under the Rules on Electronic Evidence (Bar 2003)

1. Under Sec. 1, Rule 4 of the Rules on Electronic
Evidence, the original of the electronic document is its
printout or output readable by sight or other means, provided
it is shown to reflect the data accurately (Sec. 1, Rule 4,
Rules on Electronic Evidence; MCC Industrial Sales Corp. v.
Ssangyong Corp., 536 SCRA 408).

Original printout of facsimile transmissions (Bar 2012)

1. Is a printout of a facsimile transmission an electronic
data message or electronic document?
This question was answered by the Supreme Court in
MCC Industrial Sales Corp. v. Ssangyong Corp., 536 SCRA
408.
The Court, in this case, concluded that the terms
“electronic data message" and “electronic document,” as
defined under the Electronic Commerce Act of 2000, do not
include a facsimile transmission and cannot be considered
as electronic evidence. It is not the functional equivalent
of an original under the original document rule and is not
admissible as electronic evidence.
Accordingly, the congressional deliberations on the
Electronic Commerce Act show that when Congress formulated
the term “electronic data message,” it intended the same
meaning as the term “electronic record” in the Canada law
which excludes telexes or faxes, except computer-generated
faxes from the term, “electronic data message.”
The Court explained that since a facsimile transmission is
not an “electronic data message” or an “electronic document,”
and cannot be considered as electronic evidence by the Court,
with greater reason is a photocopy of such fax transmission
not electronic evidence.
2. In Garvida v. Sales, Jr., 271 SCRA 767, the Court
explained the unacceptability of filing pleadings through fax
machines. In so doing, the Court ruled:

.

“. . A facsimile is not a genuine and authentic
pleading. It is, at best, an exact copy preserving all the
marks of an original. Without the original, there is no way
of determining on its face whether the facsimile pleading
is genuine and authentic and was originally signed by the
party and his counsel. It may, in fact, be a sham pleading”
(Underscoring supplied).

Excuses for not presenting the original document (Bar 1992,
1997)

The excuses for the non-production of the original
document refer to the instances when the original does not
have to be produced even when the contents of the document are
the subjects of inquiry. These instances are those mentioned
in Sec. 3, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, as amended, namely:
(a) When the original is lost or destroyed, or cannot
be produced in court, without bad faith on the part of the
offeror;

CHAPTER IV

—

OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE

175

destroyed or cannot be produced in court without bad faith
on the part of the party offering the secondary evidence. This
exception does not only cover loss or destruction but also other
reasons for the failure to produce the original in court even if
the original is not lost or destroyed, as when the original is
beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the court (Reynolds on
Evidence, 2nd Ed., §61;PNB u. Olila, 98 Phil. 1002).
2. Under Sec. 5 of Rule 130, secondary evidence
may be admitted only by laying the basis for its production.
Specifically, laying such basis requires compliance with the
following:

(b) When the original is in the custody or under
the control of the party against whom the evidence is
offered, and the latter fails to produce it after reasonable
notice, or the original cannot be obtained by local judicial
processes or procedures;
(c) When the original consists of numerous
accounts or other documents which cannot be examined
in court without great loss of time and the fact sought to
be established from them is only the general result of the
whole; and

(d) When the original is a public record in the
custody of a public officer or is recorded in a public office.
(e) When the original is not closely-related to a
controlling issue.

2. Secondary Evidence

(a) The offeror must prove the execution or
existence of the original document;
(b) The offeror must show the cause of its
unavailability such as the loss or destruction of the
original; and
(c) The offeror must show that the unavailability
was not due to his bad faith (See also Republic v. Mupas,
G.R. No. 181892, September 8, 2015; See also Republic v.
Cuenca, G.R. No. 198393, April 4, 2018).
(d) The offeror must show that due diligence had
been exercised in searching for it (Citibank v. Teodoro,

411 SCRA 577).

After complying with the requirements for laying the
basis for the introduction of secondary evidence, the offeror
may now be allowed to prove the contents of the documents by
secondary evidence.

Requisites for the introduction of secondary evidence In
case of loss, destruction, or unavailability of the original

3. Based on the Rules, the presentation of secondary
evidence should be in the following order:

1. Secondary evidence refers to evidence other than
the original instrument or document itself (EDSA Shangri-La
Hotel and Resort, Inc. v. BF Corp., 556 SCRA 25).

(b) a recital of the contents of the document in some
authentic document; or
(c) by the testimony of witnesses (Sec. 5, Rule 130,
Rules of Court).

Secondary evidence, like a copy of the original, is
admissible as an exception if the original writing has been lost,

(a) a copy of the original;

(The Bar Lectures Series)

Accordingly, the correct order of proof is as follows:
existence, execution, loss and contents although, at the sound
discretion of the court, this order may be changed if necessary
(Citibank v. Teodoro, 411 SCRA 577).
4. One case, involving two women who claimed to be
the legal spouse of the same man, is illustrative.
In the case, the respondent filed an action for the
declaration of nullity of the second marriage of her husband to
the petitioner. The respondent alleged in her complaint that
she had married her husband in 1942. The petitioner, on the
other hand, claimed to be the legal wife of the same man on the
basis of her marriage to him in 1979. She alleged, by way of
defense, that the man she married was not the legal husband,
but only the common law husband, of the respondent.
The respondent, who had no original marriage certificate
to prove the marriage, offered in evidence the certifications
from both the civil registrar of the place of marriage and the
National Statistics Office, attesting to the destruction of all
records of marriage during the Second World War. Since
there was no copy of the record of marriage, she submitted the
following secondary evidences: (a) certificate of her marriage
to her husband issued by the parish priest of the place where
the marriage was solemnized; (b) birth certificates of her
children by her husband; (c) certificate of baptism of one child
indicating that he was born to respondent and her husband;
(d) the testimony of respondent herself; and (e) the testimony
of the sister of her husband as to the fact of marriage.
The Court ruled that the pieces of evidence offered
established the fact of marriage of respondent to the man she
claimed to be her husband. The marriage of petitioner to the
same man, was declared null and void (See Macua Vda. de
Avenido u. Avenido, G.R. No. 173540, January 22, 2014).
Citing precedents, the Court, in the same case, declared:
“While a marriage certificate is considered the
primary evidence of a marital union, it is not regarded
as the sole and exclusive evidence of marriage.

—

CHAPTER IV OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
B. Documentary Evidence (Rule 130)

177

Jurisprudence teaches that the fact of marriage may be
proven as relevant evidence other than the marriage
certificate. Hence, even a person’s birth certificate may
be recognized as competent evidence of the marriage
between his parents.”

Requisites for the introduction of secondary evidence
when the original Is In the custody or control of the adverse
party, or cannot be obtained by local judicial processes or
procedures

1. A showing that the original document is in the
custody or under the control of the adverse party does not
ipso facto authorize the introduction of secondary evidence to
prove its contents. The party who seeks to present secondary
evidence must first lay the basis for its introduction. Laying
the basis requires proof of the following:
(a) that the original exists;
(b) that said document is under the custody or
control of the adverse party;

(c) that the proponent of secondary evidence has
given the adverse party reasonable notice to produce the
original document; and
(d) that the adverse party failed to produce the
original document despite the reasonable notice, or

(e) that the original cannot be obtained bv local
judicial processes or procedures,

2. In one case, the Supreme Court emphasized that the
mere fact that the original of the writing is in the custody or
control of the party against whom it is offered does not warrant
the admission of secondary evidence. The offeror must prove
that he has done all in his power to secure the best evidence by
giving notice to the said party to produce the document. The
notice may be in the form of a motion for the production of the
original, or made in open court in the presence of the adverse
party, or via a subpoena duces tecum, provided that the party

EVIDENCE

178

(The Bar Lectures Series)

in custody of the original has sufficient time to produce the
same. When such party has the original of the writing and
does not voluntarily offer to produce it or refuses to produce
it, secondary evidence may be admitted (Magdayao v. People,
436 SCRA 677).

3. After the foundational requirements for the
introduction of secondary evidence have been complied with,
secondary evidence may now be presented as in the case of
loss (Sec. 6, Rule 130, Rules of Court). This means that the
contents of the document may now be proven by a copy of the
document, a recital of its contents in some authentic document,
or by testimony of witnesses in the order stated (Sec. 5, ibid.).
Requisites for the introduction of secondary evidence when
the original consists of numerous accounts
1.

Under this exception, secondary evidence is

admissible:
(a) if the original consists of numerous accounts or
other documents;

(b) such accounts or documents cannot be exa mined
in court without great loss of time; and
(c) the fact sought to be established from them is
only the general result of the whole (Sec. 3[c], ibid.).

2. The main reason for this exception lies in the

determination by the court that production of the original
writings and their examination in court would result in great
loss of time considering that the evidence desired from the
voluminous accounts is only the general result of the whole
like a summary of the accounts. Under this exception, a
witness may be allowed to offer a summary of a number of
documents, or the summary itself may be admitted, if the
underlying documents are so voluminous and intricate as to
make an examination of all of them impracticable. They may
also be presented in the form of charts or calculations (29A
Am Jur, Evidence, §§1059-1060).

—

CHAPTER IV OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
B. Documentary Evidence (Rule 130)

179

3. The trial court may admit a summary of the
voluminous original documents, in lieu of original documents,
if the party has shown that the underlying writings are
numerous and that an in-court examination of these docu¬
ments would be inconvenient. In other words, the rule does
away with the item-by-item court identification of voluminous
exhibits which would only be burdensome and tedious for the
parties and the court (See Republic v. Mupas, G.R. No. 181892,

September 8, 2015).

For example, an accountant’s written summary of some
150,000 sales invoices for goods sold by the plaintiff may
be allowed under this exception despite the objection of the
defendant that the sales invoices constitute the original
documents and should be presented (Compania Maritima u.
Allied Free Workers Union, 77 SCRA 24).
As a condition precedent to the admission of a summary
of numerous documents, the proponent must lay a proper
foundation for the admission of the original documents on
which the summary is based. This means that the source
documents must be shown to be original and not secondary
and must be made accessible to the opposing party so that the
correctness of the summary maybe tested on cross-examination
or may be refuted in pleadings. A proper foundation for
the introduction of a summary may be established through
the testimony of the person responsible for the summary’s
preparation, or the person who supervised the preparation
of the summary (See Republic u. Mupas, G.R. No. 181892,
September 8, 2015).
4. Under Sec. 7 of Rule 130, as amended, the presen¬
tation of the contents of numerous accounts or documents may
be in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation. However,
the originals shall be available for examination or copying,
or both, by the adverse party at a reasonable time and place.
Further, the court may order that they be produced in court.
This provision may be read in connection with Sec. 3(c) of
Rule 130 which states that the production of the original may
be excused when the same consists of numerous accounts or
other documents which cannot be examined in court without

great loss of time and the fact sought to be established from
them is only the general result of the whole.

10 of Rule 130, as amended, provides: “When the terms of an
agreement have been reduced to writing.” Hence, when the
agreement is merely oral, the parol evidence rule should not
be applied.

Requisites for the introduction of secondary evidence when
the original document is a public record

2. A contract is a “meeting of the minds” between
two or more persons. This is how a contract is described
under Art. 1305 of the Civil Code. The Civil Code does not
define a contract as a document, a deed, or an instrument.
The document, deed, or instrument is merely the tangible
evidence of a contract. It is the meeting of the minds between
the parties that constitutes the contract.

There are instances when the original of a document is a
public record or is recorded in a public office (Sec. 3[d], Rule
130, Rules of Court). Public records are generally not to be
removed from the places where they are recorded and kept
(Sec. 26, Rule 132, ibid.). For this reason, the proof of the
contents of a document which forms part of a public record
may be done by secondary evidence. This evidence is a certified
true copy of the original. This certified copy is to be issued by
the public officer in custody of the public records (Sec. 8, Rule
130, ibid.).

3. Before executing a written agreement, the parties
normally engage in preliminary oral negotiations. They may
even exchange letters or notes constituting offers and counter¬
offers which, of course, are not intended to be contracts in
themselves but are merely parts of the negotiation process.
When the minds of the parties finally agree on the object and
cause or consideration, a contract is bom. In legal parlance,
a contract is perfected. The perfected contract may be oral
or written, or partly oral and partly written. The form of
the contract, as a rule, does not matter. As long as there
is a “meeting of the minds,” there is a perfected contract.
Even a purely oral agreement does not negate the existence
of a contract because under this jurisdiction, even an oral
agreement gives rise to a contract. There is a contract because
there is a meeting of the minds (See Arts. 1305and 1315, Civil
Code of the Philippines).

Effect of not offering a document In evidence after calling
for Its production and Inspection

If the party who calls for the production of a document
does not offer the same in evidence, no unfavorable inference
may be drawn from such failure. This is because under Sec. 9
of Rule 130, as amended, a party who calls for the production of
a document is not required to offer it. The pertinent provision
states:
“SEC. 2. Party who calls for document not bound
A party who calls for the production of a
document and inspects the same is not obliged to offer
it as evidence.''

4. The decision of the parties to reduce the agreement
in written form is critical to the application of the parol
evidence rule. When they execute a written contract, the parol
evidence rule ipso facto comes into play. Under Sec. 10 of Rule
130, as amended, “When the terms of an agreement have been
reduced to writing, it is considered as containing all the terms
agreed upon and there can be, as between the parties and
their successors in interest, no evidence of such terms other
than the contents of the written agreement” (Carganillo u.
People, G.R. No. 182424. September 22, 2014).

3. Parol Evidence Rule
(Rule 130)
Contracts and the parol evidence rule
1. Among the various evidentiary rules, it is the
parol evidence rule that has direct application to the law on
contracts. The rule, however, applies only to contracts which
the parties have decided to set forth in writing because Sec.

182

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

Application of the parol evidence rule (Bar 1978, 1981, 1983,
2012)
1. The “parol evidence rule” is embodied in Sec. 10,
Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, as amended, which provides:
"SEC. 12. Evidence of written agreements. — When
the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing,
It Is considered as containing all the terms agreed upon
and there can be, as between the parties and their
successors in interest, no evidence of such terms other
than the contents of the written agreement.
However, a party may present evidence to modify,
explain or add to the terms of the written agreement if he
or she puts In issue in a verified pleading:

(a) An intrinsic ambiguity, mistake or imperfection
In the written agreement;
(b) The failure of the written agreement to express
the true Intent and agreement of the parties thereto;

(c) The validity of the written agreement; or
(d) The existence of other terms agreed to by the
parties or their successors in interest after the execution
of the written agreement

The term “agreement” includes wills."

2. The term “parol” evidence means something “oral”
or verbal but, with reference to contracts, it means extraneous
evidence or evidence aliunde (Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed.,
pp. 1005, 1006).

As used in the Rules of Court, the term refers not only
to oral but also to written evidence which are outside of or
extraneous to the written contract between the parties.
3. The parol evidence rule becomes operative when the
issues in the litigation are the terms of a written agreement.

In clear-cut language, the basic question that would bring
the parol evidence rule into play is: “What have the parties
agreed upon?” The appropriate answer would be: "Look into

CHAPTER IV -OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
B. Documentary Evidence (Rule 130)

183

the written agreement and not elsewhere because only the
contents of the written agreement are admissible in evidence.”
There is no need to look into any other source because such
sources are barred by the rule. They are barred because, as
Sec. 10 of Rule 130 provides, the writing "... is considered as
containing all the terms agreed upon...”
4. Sec. 10 of Rule 130 considers the written agreement
as the embodiment of all the terms agreed upon by the parties,
i.e., a total integration of said agreement. Because the writing
is considered as containing all the terms of said agreement, the
traditional distinction between partial and total integration
observed in traditional American jurisprudence appears
irrelevant to the application of the parol evidence rule in a
Philippine setting. In American jurisprudence (29A Am Jur
2d §§1116-1120), when a writing is on its face incomplete, said
writing is only a partial integration of the agreement of the
parties; hence, parol evidence is not barred to prove matters
not covered by the writing. Parol evidence is, however, barred
when the writing is a total integration of the agreement.
Under the Rules of Court, the written agreement is
already “considered to contain all the things agreed upon.”
If this be so, the written agreement already represents the
final expression of the agreement of the parties on the subject.
Being the final agreement, any extraneous or “parol” evidence
is inadmissible for any of the following purposes: (a) modify,
(b) explain, or (c) add to the terms of the written agreement.
5. The parol evidence rule, therefore, forbids any
addition to, or contradiction of, the terms of a written
agreement by testimony or other evidence purporting to show
that different terms were agreed upon by the parties, varying
the purport of the written contract (Seaoil Petroleum Corp,
v. Autocorp Group, 569 SCRA 387). Whatever is not found in
the writing is understood to have been waived and abandoned
(Edrada v. Ramos, 468 SCRA 597).
6. In general, the parol evidence rule is designed to
give certainty to written transactions, preserve the reliability
and protect the sanctity of written agreements.

184

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

The rationale behind the foregoing rule was explained in
Ortanez v. Court of Appeals, 266 SCRA 561, thus:
“Spoken words could be notoriously undesirable
unlike a written contract which speaks of a uniform
language. Thus, under the general rule in Section 9 [now
Section 10] of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, when the
terms of an agreement were reduced to writing, as in this
case, it is deemed to contain all the terms agreed upon
and no evidence of such terms can be admitted other than
the contents thereof (See also Spouses Paras v. Kimwa
Construction and Development Corporation, G.R. No.
171601, April 8, 2015).

7. Be it noted again that the parol evidence rule does
not apply to oral agreements. For the said rule to apply, there
must be a writing. Not all writings, however, will trigger the
application of the parol evidence rule. That writing must
embody an agreement. The tenor of Sec. 10 clearly uses the
following words: “When the terms of an agreement have been
reduced to writing ..."
There is only one writing which, although not legally
an agreement, is considered to be one for purposes of the
application of the parol evidence rule. This writing is a
will. The last paragraph of Sec. 10 of Rule 130 confirms this
observation, thus: “The term ‘agreement’ includes wills’’
(Italics supplied).
8. Should the "writing" that embodies the agreement of
the parties be in a particular form? Note that Sec. 10 of Rule
130 only makes reference to a “writing," not a public writing
or a private writing.

One case particularly weD illustrates the answer to the
question. In this case, the petitioner contends that since the
promissory note is not a public instrument with the formalities
prescribed by law but a mere commercial paper, parol evidence
may “overcome" the contents of the promissory note.

B. Documentary Evidence (Rule 130)

The Supreme Court did not view the argument with
merit and held that the rule does not specify that the written
agreement be a public document. The Court stated in the case:
“What is required is that the agreement be in writing
as the rule is in fact founded on long experience that
written evidence is so much more certain and accurate
than that which rests in fleeting memory only, that it
would be unsafe, when parties have expressed the terms
of their contract in writing, to admit weaker evidence to
control and vary the stronger and to show that the parties
intended a different contract from that expressed in the
writing signed by them.' Thus, for the parol evidence rule
to apply, a written contract need not be in any particular
form, or be signed by both parties. As a general rule, bills,
notes and other instruments of a similar nature are not
subject to be varied or contradicted by parol or extrinsic
evidence” (Inciong, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No.
96405, June 26, 1996, 247 SCRA 578).
Application of the rule only to parties and their successors
in interest

1. The parol evidence rule does not apply to persons
who are not parties to a deed and do not base their claim on it
(Eagleridge Development Corp. v. Cameron Granville 3 Asset
Management, Inc., 741 SCRA 557).

2. Only the parties and successors in interest are
bound by the parol evidence rule. The rule that the terms
of an agreement are to be proven only by the contents of
the writing itself refers to suits between parties and their
successors in interest” (Sec. 10, Rule 130, Rules of Court). The
rule does not bind suits involving strangers to the contract. It
applies only to the parties to a written agreement and those
who are privy to a party or successors in interest (29A Am
Jur, Evidence, §1096). Thus, a total stranger to the writing is
not bound by its terms and is allowed to introduce extrinsic or
parol evidence against the efficacy of the writing (Lechugas v.
Court of Appeals, 22 Phil. 310, August 6, 1986. citing Horn v.
Hansen, 57 N.W. 315).

EVIDENCE

(The Bur Lectures Series)

Application of the rule to wills

1. The parol evidence rule applies to contractual
obligations. However, by the explicit provision of Sec. 10 of
Rule 130, the term “agreement” includes wills. There can,
therefore, be no evidence of the terms of the will other than
the contents of the will itself.

2. While the parol evidence rule applies to wills, an
express trust concerning an immovable or any interest therein
may not be proved by parol evidence (Art. 1443, Civil Code of
the Philippines).

Illustration:

Mr. Seller and Mr. Buyer entered into a written
contract for the sale of a house and lot. The deed of sale
mentions a purchase price of P25 million, a down payment
of 70%, and the balance payable within one year from the
tender of the down payment although the actual period
agreed upon orally was two years. The oral agreement
between them also considered the air conditioners inside
each room of the house as part of the purchase price, but
this fact was inadvertently not mentioned in the written
agreement.

Under the parol evidence rule, Mr. Buyer would
not be allowed to show that the purchase price included
the air conditioners and that the payment period for the
balance was two years. He would not be allowed to do so
because of the rule that the only evidence of the terms of
the agreement between the parties shall be the contents
of the written agreement itself. Any extrinsic evidence
therefore, that would modify, explain or add to the writing
would be deemed “parol" evidence and hence, barred.
Parol evidence is inadmissible to establish stipulations
other than those contained in the writing. Thus, all other
evidence of the contents of the writing are to be ignored.
This is the general rule.

CHAPTER IV OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
B. Documentary Evidence (Rule 130)

187

When and how to Introduce parol evidence
1. The rule prohibiting parol evidence is not absolute. A
party may present evidence when he desires to modify, explain
or add to the terms of the written agreement (Carganillo v.
People, G.R. No. 182424, September 22, 2014) by putting in
issue in the pleadings any of the following:
(a) An intrinsic ambiguity, mistake or imperfection
in the written agreement;
(b) The failure of the written agreement to express
the true intent and agreement of the parties thereto
(Saberola v. Suarez, 558 SCRA 135);

(c) The validity of the written agreement; or
(d) The existence of other terms agreed to by the
parties or their successors in interest after the execution
of the written agreement (Sec. 10, Rule 130, Rules of
Court).
2. Introducing parol evidence means offering extrinsic
or extraneous evidence that would modify, explain or add to the
terms of the written agreement, but parol evidence may only
be allowed if, any of the matters mentioned above (from “a” to
“d”) is put in issue in the pleadings (Carganillo v. People, G.R.
No. 182424, September 22, 2014; Philippine National Bank
v. Cua, G.R. No. 199161, April 18, 2018). Without complying
with this requirement, i.e., putting in issue in the pleadings,
parol evidence cannot be introduced.

Stated another way, where parol evidence is allowed
by the Rules, parol evidence can serve the purpose of
incorporating into the contract additional contemporaneous
conditions, which are not mentioned at all in the writing (See
Felix Plazo Urban Poor Settlers Community Association, Inc.
v. Lipat, Sr., G.R. No. 182409, March 20. 2017).
Example: Seller sues Buyer for P300.000.00, an amount
representing the unpaid balance of the price of a car bought
by and duly delivered to the latter. Although the deed of sale
stipulated a contract price of P700.000.00, the actual oral

jgg

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

agreement was only for Buyer to pay a price of P400,000.00,
an amount already paid. The amount as written in the deed
of sale was actually a result of mere inadvertence. If Buyer
wants to prove during the trial that the true price as agreed
by the parties is P400,000.00, Buyer must allege in his answer
to the complaint that there was a mistake in the writing and
it does not reflect the true agreement of the parties. Such
allegations would put such matters in issue in the pleading,
opening the door to the introduction of parol evidence.
3. Where it appears that the plaintiff has signed
a promissory note in favor of a bank but the receipt of the
proceeds of the loan has been denied by said plaintiff contrary
to the terms of the note, the presumption that the plaintiff had
received the proceeds of the loan in accordance with the tenor of
the promissory note must be overcome by a parol evidence that
is clear and convincing. The mere uncorroborated testimony
of the plaintiff that he had the practice of pre-signing loan
applications with the bank for the purpose of having a standby
loan or ready money available at any time, is not sufficient to
overcome the terms of the note. A promissory note is a solemn
acknowledgment of a debt and a formal commitment to repay
it according to its terms. A person who signs a promissory note
is bound to honor it as a legitimate obligation duly assumed
by him through the signature he affixes thereto as a token of
his good faith. Indeed, no reasonable and prudent man would
acknowledge a debt if the same does not exist (See Philippine
National Bank v. Cua, G.R. No. 199161, April 18, 2018).
4. To reiterate, the parol evidence rule does not per se
bar the introduction of parol evidence as long as the pleader
puts in issue in the verified pleading any of the matters set
forth in the rule such as the mistake or imperfection of the
writing, its failure to express the true agreement of the parties
or the existence of subsequent agreements. The key words
are “putting in issue" in the pleading. Unless duly pleaded, a
party will be barred from offering extrinsic evidence over the
objection of the adverse party.
Thus, it was clearly declared: “Provided that a party
puts in issue in its [verified] pleading any of the four (4) items

—

CHAPTER IV OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
B. Documentary Evidence (Rule 130)

189

enumerated in the second paragraph of Sec. 9 [now Sec. 10],
Rule 130, a party may present evidence to modify, explain or
add to the terms of the agreement” (Spouses Paras v. Kimwa
Construction and Development Corp., G.R. No. 171601, April
8, 2015).
6. In an action to recover from an insurance policy, the
plaintiff wanted to put forth a witness who would testify as
to the actual terms of the contract of insurance as allegedly
agreed upon despite contrary provisions in said policy. The
testimony was not allowed. The Supreme Court sustained
both the trial court and the Court of Appeals on the basis of
Sec. 9 [now Sec. 10] of Rule 130.
The Court ruled that Sec. 9 [now Sec. 10], Rule 130 of
the Revised Rules of Court expressly requires that for parol
evidence to be admissible to vary the terms of the written
agreement, the mistake or imperfection thereof or its failure to
express the true agreement of the parties should be put in issue
in the pleadings. As correctly noted by the appellate court,
the plaintiff failed to raise the issue of an intrinsic ambiguity,
mistake or imperfection in the terms of the insurance policy,
or the failure of said contract to express the true intent and
agreement of the parties thereto in its complaint There was,
therefore, no error on the part of the appellate court when it
affirmed the RTC’s order disallowing the witness to testify as
to the alleged terms of the contract (Pilipinas Bank v. Court of
Appeals, 341 SCRA 527).
Prior, contemporaneous, and subsequent agreements

1. The traditional rules limit the inadmissibility of
parol evidenceorextrinsicevidencetoprioror contemporaneous
stipulations. Hence, if a written agreement was executed by
the parties on December 22, 2015, agreements before (prior)
that date or even on the same date (contemporaneous)
which modify, alter, or contradict the stipulations written
into the December 22 agreement are not admissible since
these constitute parol evidence. But assuming that the
same parties entered into another agreement on January 5,
2016 which modifies some of the terms of the December 22

I

190

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

agreement, would the January 5 agreement be admissible
without violating the parol evidence rule? Under traditional
rules, the agreement would be admissible because subsequent
agreements are not barred by the parol evidence rule.

Citing American sources, the eminent authority, Moran,
writes: “The parties to a written agreement may show by parol
evidence that, subsequent to the execution of such written
agreement, they have entered into an oral contract tending
to waive, dissolve, or annul the former agreement, or in any
manner to add to, or subtract from or vary or qualify the terms
thereof (Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court 1980, 112).
2. The rule forbidding the admission of evidence aliunde
or extrinsic evidence did not prohibit proof of an agreement
entered into after the written instrument was executed,
notwithstanding that such agreement may have the effect of
adding to, changing or modifying the written agreement of the
parties (Canute v. Mariano, 37 Phil. 840). This is in fact the
rule in American jurisprudence (Jones on Evidence, 6th Ed.,
Vol. 3, §16.10). Parol evidence on subsequent agreements may
be admitted (29a Am Jur, Evidence, §1133). This means that
the existence of another agreement after the execution of the
original written agreement may be introduced without first
complying with the requirement of putting the subsequent
agreement in issue.
3. Since the rules provide that “subsequent agreements”
are among those matters that need to be put in issue, this
signifies that before evidence may be introduced that the
parties entered into another agreement after the execution of
the written agreement, such subsequent agreement has first
to be put in issue in the pleadings. The phraseology of the rule
leads one to conclude that, unlike traditional jurisprudence,
such a subsequent agreement could be invoked only if its
existence is put in issue in the pleading.

Intrinsic ambiguity In the writing
1. An instance when evidence aliunde or parol evidence
may be allowed to modify, explain or even add to the written

—

CHAPTER IV OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
B. Documentary Evidence (Rule 130)

191

agreement is when an intrinsic ambiguity exists in the
written agreement. It must be emphasized, however, that the
mere existence of an intrinsic ambiguity will not authorize
the admission of parol evidence. It is very important that the
intrinsic ambiguity be put in issue in the party’s pleading. It is
the raising of the issue of intrinsic ambiguity in the pleading
which will authorize the introduction of parol evidence.
2. Intrinsic or latent ambiguity is one which is not
apparent on the face of the document but which lies in the
person or thing that is the subject of the document or deed.
In other words, the ambiguity is intrinsic or latent when the
language of the writing is clear and intelligible and suggests
but a single meaning, but some matter extraneous to the
writing creates the ambiguity (Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th
Ed., p. 73 citing Logue v. Von Almen, 379 III. 208, 40 N.E.2d
73, 82).
In this type of ambiguity, the document is clear on its
face but matters outside the agreement create the ambiguity.
Illustration:
The testator’s will bequeaths to Jose Navidad, his
only grandson, a parcel of grazing land with an area of
ten thousand square meters, located in a town called
Magdiwang. It was discovered, after his death, that the
testator owns two parcels of land in the same place which
are of exactly the same area and description. There is
here an intrinsic ambiguity in the writing.
Similarly, if the testator owns only one parcel of land
and bequeaths that land to his grandson, described in
the will as Jose Navidad, but it was discovered later that
he has two grandsons with the same name, there also
exists an intrinsic or latent ambiguity. Parol evidence
may be introduced to prove the grandson intended in the
will provided that the will’s intrinsic ambiguity is put in
issue.
3. Note that the rule allowing parol evidence
particularly refers only to an intrinsic ambiguity in the

192

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

writing. The obvious implication is that where the ambiguity
is patent or extrinsic, parol evidence will not be admitted even
if the same is put in issue in the pleading.

A patent or extrinsic ambiguity is that which appears on
the very face of the instrument, and arises from the defective,
obscure, or insensible language used (Black’s Law Dictionary,
5th Ed., p. 73). Parol evidence is not admissible to explain the
ambiguity; otherwise, the court would be creating, instead of
construing a contract.

For example, a donor writes in the deed of donation that
he is donating to his only son, Jose, one of his cars. Without
describing the specific car, there is a patent ambiguity. The
ambiguity which is apparent on the very face of the document
cannot be clarified or explained by parol evidence.
4. To reiterate, as long as the latent or intrinsic
ambiguity is raised as an issue in the pleadings, the court will
allow evidence aliunde to explain the ambiguity to give effect
to the intention of a party or the parties. HoWever, even if a
pleader raises as an issue the extrinsic or patent ambiguity
in a contract or will, the court will not allow parol evidence
to explain the ambiguity or supply the deficiency. The rule
only allows parol evidence in the case of an intrinsic or latent
ambiguity.

193

v. Kimwa Construction and Development Corp., G.R. No.
171601, Aprils, 2015).
2. The failure of the writing to express the true
agreement of the parties is another ground for admitting parol
evidence as long as the issue is raised in the pleadings. In fact,
mistake or imperfection of the writing may be a reason for the
failure of the instrument or writing to embody the intention of
the parties. This does not mean, however, that the mistake or
imperfection prevented the meeting of the minds between or
among the parties. This only means that, despite the meeting
of the minds, the true agreement of the parties is not reflected
in the instrument.

Aside from mistake, there are some other reasons
enumerated in substantive law for the failure of the
instrument to express the true intention of the parties like
fraud, inequitable conduct or accident (Art. 1359, Civil Code
of the Philippines), ignorance, lack of skill, negligence or bad
faith on the part of the person drafting the instrument (Art.
1364, ibid.).

Mistake or Imperfection in the writing and failure to express
the true agreement of the parties (Bar 2001)

3. If the document appears to be a sale, parol evidence
may be resorted to if the same does not express the true
intent of the parties because it is actually a loan. The owner
of the property may prove that the contract is really a loan
with mortgage by raising as an issue in the pleading the fact
that the document is not really a sale (Madrigal v. Court of
Appeals, 456 SCRA 247).

1. The admission of evidence aliunde may be justified
when there is a mistake or imperfection in the written
agreement. Again, this mistake or imperfection must be put
in issue in the pleading by the party who wants to prove the
defect in the writing.

4. When there is a meeting of the minds between
the parties, but their true intention is not expressed in the
instrument by any of the aforementioned causes, one of the
parties may ask for the reformation of the instrument (Art.
1359, Civil Code of the Philippines).

The pleading does not need to specifically state words
and phrases such as “mistake,” “imperfection” or “failure to
express the true intent of the parties.” When the other party
responds to the allegations by making the proper denial, such
matters have already been put in issue (See Spouses Paras

In an action for reformation of the instrument under
Art. 1359 of the Civil Code, the plaintiff may introduce parol
evidence to show the real intention of the parties. An action
for reformation presupposes that a meeting of the minds
exists between the parties, i.e., there is a contract between

EVIDENCE

—

CHAPTER IV OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
B. Documentary Evidence (Rule 130)

them although the instrument that evidences the contract
does not reflect the true agreement of the parties by reason of,
for instance, fraud or mistake.
5. If there is no meeting of the minds between the
parties because of mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct
or accident, the proper remedy is not reformation of the
instrument but an action for annulment (Art, 1359, Civil Code
of the Philippines) because the contract is rendered voidable
by the vitiation of the consent of one of the parties (Art. 1390,
ibid.).

Waiver of the parol evidence rule
The parol evidence rule can be waived by failure to invoke
the benefits of the rule. This waiver may be made by failure
to object to the introduction of evidence aliunde. Inadmissible
evidence may be rendered admissible by failure to object
(Santiago v. Court of Appeals, 278 SCRA 98; Policarpio v.
Court of Appeals, 194 SCRA 729). Failure to object to the
parol evidence presented by the adverse party operates as
a waiver of the protection of the parol evidence rule (Willex
Plastic Industries Corp. v. Court of Appeals, 256 SCRA 478).

Examples:
(a) The parties have agreed on the area of the land
subject of the sale. By an act of fraud of the seller, who
prepared the deed of sale, a smaller area is indicated in
the deed. There is nothing defective in the contract which
is the meeting of the minds. The defect is in the deed of
sale, which is the instrument. If an action for reformation
is brought, the action must be for the purpose of reforming
the instrument, not for reforming the contract.

(b) An instrument may be reformed if it does not
express the true intention of the parties because of lack
of skill of the person drafting the instrument (Art. 1364,
ibid.).

196

Probative value
Even if parol evidence is admitted, such admission would
not mean that the court would give probative value to the
parol evidence. Admissibility is not the equivalent of probative
value or credibility.
Distinctions between the original document rule and the
parol evidence rule

1. The original document rule establishes a preference
for the original document over a secondary evidence thereof.
The parol evidence rule is not concerned with the primacy of
evidence but presupposes that the original is available.

(c) If the parties agree upon the mortgage or pledge
of property, but the instrument states that the property is
sold absolutely or with a right of repurchase, reformation
of the instrument is proper (Art. 1365, ibid.).

2. The original document rule precludes the admission
of secondary evidence if the original document is available. The
parol evidence rule precludes the admission of other evidence
to prove the terms of a document other than the contents of
the document itself for the purpose of varying the terms of the
writing.

6. Reformation of the instrument cannot be brought to
reform any of the following:
(a) Simple donations inter vivos wherein no

3. The original document rule can be invoked by any
litigant to an action whether or not said litigant is a party to
the document involved. The parol evidence rule can be invoked
only by the parties to the document and their successors-in-

(b) Wills; or
(c) When the real agreement is void (Art. 1366,

interest.
4. The original document rule applies to all forms of
writing. The parol evidence rule applies to written agreements
(contracts) and “wills.”

196

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

Note: If the subjects of inquiry are the terms of the
written agreement between the parties, one must read the
agreement itself and not seek guidance on sources outside the
writing. Sources outside such writing are considered “parol”
evidence and, as a rule, are inadmissible. This is the “parol
evidence” rule. However, one should not look into any writing.
He must look at the original writing. This is the “original
document” rule.

C. Authentication and Proof of Documents
(Rule 132)
Meaning of authentication (Bar 2012)

1. The concept of "authentication” occupies a vital
place in the presentation of evidence. Not only objects but also
documents introduced in evidence need to be authenticated.
It is the preliminary step in showing the admissibility of

evidence.
For example, a .38 revolver, is found in the crime scene.
To be admissible in evidence, it must be authenticated. This
means that it must be shown to the satisfaction of the court
that the weapon is the very same weapon found at the crime
scene. To convince the court, the proponent of the evidence
must call someone to identify the weapon and affirm: “This
is the weapon I found in the crime scene. “This someone could
be the police investigator or someone else who handled the
evidence. When he affirms it is the same weapon, then the
evidence is authenticated.
2. Litigation always involves the authentication of
either object or documentary evidence. Unless a document
is considered self-authenticating, it will not be admitted in
evidence without prior authentication. The requirement for
authentication of evidence discloses the existence, in the legal
system, of a legal presumption that is not, however, directly
written in statutes or procedural rules but is necessarily
implied therein. This presumption is: That objects and
documents presented in evidence are, as a rule, counterfeit. In

—

C. Authentication and Proof of Documenta (Rule 132)

197

short, evidence presented in court is not presumed authentic.
It is, therefore, incumbent upon the proponent of the evidence
to prove its authenticity.

3. Authentication of a private document does not
require a seal. There shall be no difference between sealed
and unsealed private documents insofar as their admissibility
as evidence is concerned (Sec. 32, Rule 132, Rules of Court).
Concept of a document (Bar 2019)

The Supreme Court has defined a document as a “deed,
instrument or other duly authorized paper by which something
is proved, evidenced or set forth” (Bermejo v. Barrios, 31 SCRA
764; People v. Camacho, 44 Phil. 484; U.S. v. Orera, 11 Phil.
596). However, for documents to be considered as documentary
evidence, it must be “offered as proof of their contents” (Sec. 2,
Rule 130, Rules of Court). If the document is not offered for
that purpose, the document is a mere object evidence as when
the purpose is merely to prove its existence. Hence, not every
document is to be received as documentary evidence.
Public and private documents
1. Documents may either be public or private. This
classification is for the purpose of their presentation in
evidence.

2. Section 19 of Rule 132, as amended, enumerates the
public documents, thus:

—

“SEC. 19. Classes of documents. For the purpose
of their presentation in evidence, documents are either
public or private.

Public documents are:
(a) The written official acts, or records of the
official acts of the sovereign authority, official bodies
and tribunals, and public officers, whether of the
Philippines, or of a foreign country;

r

(The Bar Lectures Series)

(b) Documents acknowledged before a notary
public except last wills and testaments;

(c) Documents that are considered public
documents under treaties and conventions which are
In force between the Philippines and the country of
source; and
(d) Public records, kept in the Philippines, of
private documents required by law to be entered therein.

All other writings are private."

The written official acts and records of the official
acts of the sovereign authority do not refer only to those of the
Philippines. They also refer to those of a foreign country.
3.

Documents acknowledged before a notary public are
public documents except last wills and testaments which are
private documents even if notarized (Sec. 19[b], Rule 132,
Rules of Court). Assumed to be included in this class of public
documents are those acknowledged before an officer, other
than a notary public, authorized to administer oaths. In the
case of a public record of a private document required by law
to be entered in a public record, the public document does not
refer to the private document itself but the public record of
that private document. (Bar 2011)
4. The rule does not give a specific definition of a private
document except by providing that “... All other writings are
private" (Sec. 19, ibid.). Private documents are those that
do not fall under any of the enumerations in Sec. 19, Rule
132 of the Rules of Court (Franco v. People, G.R. No. 191185,
February I, 2016).

5. The 2019 Amendments to the Rules on Evidence
added to the enumeration “documents that are considered
public documents under treaties and conventions which are in
force between the Philippines and the country of source.” One
example is the Convention Abolishing the Requirement of
Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents, otherwise known
as the Apostille Convention, which became effective between
the Philippines and other contracting states on May 14, 2019.

199

proof of a private document

1.

Section 20 of Rule 132, as amended, provides:

"SEC. 20. Proof of private documents. — Before
any private document offered as authentic is received
In evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be
proved by anv of the following means:
(a) By anyone who saw the document executed
or written; or
(b) By evidence of the genuineness of the
signature or handwriting of the maker; or

(c) By other evidence showing its due execution
and authenticity.
Any other private document need only be Identified
as that which it is claimed to be.”

When authentication of a private document is required (Bar
2018)

1. Where the private document is offered in evidence
as authentic, there is a need to prove its due execution and
authenticity. If the document or writing is not offered as
authentic, it only needs to be identified as that which it is
claimed to be (Sec. 20, Rule 132, Rules of Court; Franco v.
People, G.R. No. 191185, February 1, 2016).
2. Section 20 recognizes three ways of proving the due
execution and genuineness of a private instrument. One way
is to rely on the personal knowledge of a witness. Here, the
witness attests to the genuineness of the document because
it was executed or signed in his presence, Le., he personally
witnessed the execution or writing of the document. The
second mode does not require that the document be executed
in the presence of the witness. Here, the witness testifies
or shows evidence that the signature or handwriting of the
maker is genuine (Sec. 20, Rule 132, Rules of Court; Ong
v. People, 342 SCRA 372; Bangayan v. Rizal Commercial
Banking Corp., 647 SCRA 8, 26, April 4, 2011; Tan Shuy v.
Maulawin, 665 SCRA 604, 612, February 8, 2012; Cercado-

1

EVIDENCE

200

(The Bar Lectures Series)

Siga u Cercado, Jr., G.R. No. 185374, March 11, 2015). The
third mode is broader than the first two and is akin to Sec. 2,
Rule 5 of the Rules on Electronic Evidence which allows the
authentication of an electronic document “by other evidence
should its integrity and reliability to the satisfaction of the
judge.”

The manner of authenticating a document, required by

Sec. 20 of Rule 132, applies only when a private document
is offered as authentic as when it is offered to prove that the
document was truly executed by the person purported to have
made the same. Where the document is offered in evidence not
as authentic, its genuineness and due execution need not be
proven as when the only purpose is for the offeror to show that
a certain piece of document exists. When a witness says: “I
found this document in the drawer of my table,’’the document
only needs identification and not authentication. But when
the witness wants to show that the deed was indeed executed
by his brother, the process of authentication required by Sec.
20 must be complied with.

Authentication of both the original and a photocopy of the
original

While it is a basic rule of evidence that the original copy
prevails over a mere photocopy, there is no harm if in a case,
both the original and a photocopy thereof are authenticated,
identified and offered in evidence by the party proponent
(Santos v. Alcazar, G.R. No. 183034, March 12, 2014).
When authentication of private documents is not required

The requirement of authentication of a private document
is excused in some instances, specifically:
(a) when the document is an ancient one within the
context of Sec. 21, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court;
(b) when the genuineness and authenticity of an
actionable document have not been specifically denied
under oath by the adverse party under Sec. 8 of Rule 8 of
the Rules of Court;

—

CHAPTER IV OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
C. Authentication and Proof of Documenta (Rule 132)

201

(c) when the genuineness and authenticity of the
document have been admitted under Sec. 4 of Rule 129;
or
(d) when the document is not being offered as
authentic as implied from Sec. 20, Rule 132 of the Rules
of Court, which requires authentication only when the
document is offered as “authentic" (See Patula v. People,
669 SCRA 135, 157, April 11, 2012).

Ancient documents (Bar 1990)

There is an exception to the rule requiring proof of the
genuineness and due execution of a private document. The
exception is in the case of a private “ancient document.” A
private document is considered ancient when it is more than
30 years old, is produced from a custody in which it would
naturally be found if genuine, and is unblemished by any
alteration or circumstance of suspicion (Sec. 21, Rule 132,
Rules of Court; Cercado-Siga u. Cercado, Jr., G.R No. 185374,
March 11, 2015). (Bar 2011)
When a document is ancient pursuant to the description
in Sec. 21 of Rule 132, evidence of its authenticity need not
be given, i.e., there is no need to prove its genuineness and
due execution. This means that there is no necessity for
observance of the authentication process under Sec. 20 such
as the testimony of a person who saw the document executed
or by one who will show evidence of the genuineness of the
handwriting of the maker of the document. It must, however,
be established first that the document is ancient and that it
has the characteristics of a document so provided under Sec.
21. When all these are complied with, no other evidence of its
authenticity need be given.

Section 21 of Rule 132 is clear on this point. To quote:
“SEC. 21. When evidence of authenticity of private
document not necessary. Where a private document

and Is unblemished by any alterations or circumstances
of suspicion, no other evidence of its authenticity need
be given.”

How to prove genuineness of a handwriting

1. Section 22 of Rule 132, as amended, enumerates
how the genuineness of a handwriting may be proved:
“SEC. 22. How genuineness of handwriting proved.
The handwriting of a person may be proved by any
witness who believes it to be the handwriting of such
person because he or she has seen the person write, or
has seen writing purporting to be his or hers upon which
the witness has acted or been charged, and has thus
acquired knowledge of the handwriting of such person.
Evidence respecting the handwriting may also be given
by a comparison, made by the witness or the court, with
writings admitted or treated as genuine by the party
against whom the evidence is offered, or proved to be
genuine to the satisfaction of the judge.”

—

2. Section 22 of Rule 132 does not require expert
testimony to prove the handwriting of a person.

It may be proven by any witness who believes it to be the
handwriting of a person because: (1) he has seen the person
write; or (2) he has seen writing purporting to be his upon
which the witness has acted or been charged, and has thus
acquired knowledge of the handwriting of such person; or
(3) by a comparison made by the witness or the court, with
writings admitted or treated as genuine by the party against
whom the document is offered, or proved to be genuine to the
satisfaction of the judge (Heirs of Amado Celestial v. Heirs of
Editha G. Celestial, 408 SCRA 291; Aguinaldo v. Torres, Jr.,
G.R. No. 225808, September II, 2017).
Section 22, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court explicitly
authorizes the court, by itself, to make a comparison of the
disputed handwriting with writings admitted or treated as
genuine by the party against whom the evidence is offered, or

203

proved to be genuine to the satisfaction of the judge (Almeda
v. Heirs ofPonciano Almeda, G.R. No. 194189, September 14,
201 7). Hence, a finding of forgery does not depend entirely on
the testimony of handwriting experts and that the judge still
exercises independent judgment on the issue of authenticity
of the signatures under scrutiny (Philippine Trust Company
v. Gabinete, G.R. No. 216120, March 29, 2017).

“The opinions of handwriting experts are not necessarily
binding upon the court, the expert’s function being to place
before the court data upon which the court can form its own
opinion. This principle holds true especially when the question
involved is mere handwriting similarity or dissimilarity,
which can be determined by a visual comparison of specimens
of the questioned signatures with those of the currently
existing ones. A finding of forgery does not depend entirely
on the testimonies of handwriting experts, because the judge
must conduct an independent examination of the questioned
signature in order to arrive at a reasonable conclusion as to its
authenticity” (Heirs of Peter Donton u. Stier, G.R. No. 216491,
August 23, 2017).
Importance of knowing whether a document is public or
private; proof of notarial documents

1. The nature of documents as either public or private
determines how they may be presented as evidence in court.
A public document is admissible in evidence without
further proof of its due execution and genuineness and has
in its favor the presumption of regularity (Pen Development
Corp. v. Martinez Leyba, Inc., G.R. No. 211845, August 9,
2017).

For example, under Sec. 30 of Rule 132, every document
duly notarized may be presented in evidence without further
proof, the certificate of acknowledgment being prima facie
evidence of the execution of the instrument or document
involved. Sec. 30 of Rule 132 affirms the above principles,

thus:

204

CHAPTER IV OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE

(The Bar Lectures Series)

—

Every
"SEC. 30. Proof of notarial documents.
Instrument duly acknowledged or proved and certified as
provided by law, may be presented in evidence without
further proof, the certificate of acknowledgement being
prime facte evidence of the execution of the Instrument
or document involved.”

2. The above rule presupposes that the document was
notarized by a person duly authorized to perform notarial
functions. Without such authority, the private document
does not become a public document. It also presupposes that
the document was properly notarized in the presence of the
notary public. Thus, where the parties signed the document in
the USA, the witness in Makati City and the notarization took
place in Cavite City, the document was improperly notarized.
The improper notarization stripped the document of its public
character and reduced it to a private document (See Aguinaldo
v. Torres, Jr., G.R. No. 225808, September 11, 201 7). If the
acknowledgment in the notarized document is defective, such
defect will merely strip the document of its public character
and reduce it to a private document. It remains incumbent
upon a party, who wants to uphold the document, to prove
that the document was not forged (See Almeda v. Heirs of
Ponciano Almeda, G.R. No. 194189, September 14, 2017).
“Acknowledgment" refers to an act in which an individual,
on a single occasion, (a) appears in person before the notary
public and presents an integrally complete instrument or
document; (b) is attested to be personally known to the notary
public or identified by the notary public through competent
evidence of identity as defined by the Rules; and (c) presents
to the notary public that the signature on the instrument or
document was voluntarily affixed by him for the purposes
stated in the instrument or document, declares that he has
executed the instrument or document as his free and voluntary
act and deed, and, if he acts in a representative capacity, that
he has authority to sign in that capacity (Coquia v. Laforteza,
A.C. No. 9364, February 8, 2017).

3. A notarized deed of sale carries the evidentiary
weight conferred upon it with respect to its due execution.

205

It is admissible in evidence without further proof of its
authenticity and is entitled to full faith and credit upon its
face. The burden of proof to overcome the presumption of due
execution of a notarial document lies on the party contesting
the same (Almeda u. Heirs of Ponciano Almeda, G.R. No.
194189, September 14, 2017; See Tujan-Militante v. Nustad,
G.R. No. 209518, June 19, 2017; See also Chambon v. Ruiz,
A.C. No. 11478, September 5, 2017; Today v. Apoya, Jr., A.C.
No. 11981, July 3, 2018).
A notarized document is also entitled to full faith and
credit upon its face. Courts, administrative agencies and the
public at large must be able to rely upon the acknowledgment
executed by a notary public (Fdbay v. Resuena, A.C. No. 8723,
January 26, 2016; Spouses Navarro v. Ygona, A.C. No. 8450,
July 26, 2017). This is because notarization converts a private
document to a public document (Today u. Apoya, Jr., A.C. No.
11981, July 3, 2018).
4. A birth certificate, being a public document, enjoys
the presumption of regularity absent proof to the contrary
(People v. Entrampas, G.R. No. 212161, March 29, 2017).

5. A baptismal certificate is not a public document.
It is a canonical certificate which is simply proof of the act
to which a priest may certify, i.e., the administration of the
sacrament of baptism. It is not proof of the declarations in the
record with respect to the parentage of the child baptized, or
of prior and distinct facts which require separate and distinct
evidence (Heirs of Gilberto Roldan v. Heirs of Silvela Roldan,
G.R. No. 202578, September 27, 2017).

6. The chemistry report of a public officer, for example,
showing a positive result of a paraffin test, is a public
document. As a public document, the rule on authentication
does not apply. It is admissible in evidence without further
proof of its due execution and genuineness. The person who
made the report, need not be presented in court to identify,
describe and testify how the report was conducted. Moreover,
documents consisting of entries in public records made in

206

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

the performance of a duty by a public officer are prima facie
evidence of the facts stated therein (Kummer v. People, G.R.
No. 174461, September 11, 2013).

Also, the picture seat plan, prepared by officers of the
Civil Service Commission in implementing a government
examination, is a public document. The presentation of the
room examiners is not necessary to establish the authenticity
and due execution of the said seat plan. Documents consisting
of entries in public records made in the performance of a duty
by a public officer are prima facie evidence of the facts stated
therein (Civil Service Commission v. Vergel de Dios, G.R. No.
203536, February 4, 2015).

7. In contrast to the rule on public documents, a private
document, because it lacks the official or sovereign character
of a public document, or the solemnities prescribed by law,
requires authentication in the manner allowed by law or
the Rules of Court before its acceptance as evidence in court
(Paiula u. People, 669 SCRA 135, 1 56, April 11, 2012; See also
Spouses Lehner v. Chua, G.R. No. 174240, March 20, 2013).
Before the admission of a private document in evidence
that is offered as authentic, its due execution and authenticity
must be proved (Sec. 20, Rule 132, Rules of Court). This
requirement does not apply to a public document which is
admissible without further proof of its due execution and

—

CHAPTER IV OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE
C. Authentication and Proof of Documenta (Rule 132)

207

Section 23, as quoted, declares:
"SEC. 23. Public documents as evidence. —
Documents consisting of entries In public records made
In the performance of a duty by a public officer are prima
facie evidence of the facts therein stated. All other public
documents are evidence, even against a third person, of
the fact which gave rise to their execution and of the
date of the latter."

However, not all types of public documents are deemed
prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated. When a
document, like a deed of sale, is notarized such document is
transformed into a public document but although classified
as such, the document is not evidence of the facts recited in
the document. In other words, it is not evidence of the truth
of the facts and stipulations in the document. At most the
notarized document is evidence of the facts that gave rise to
the document, like the fact that there was a sale and of the
date of such document (Dadis u. De Guzman, G.R. No. 206008,
June 7, 2017).
In the case of other public documents, the facts stated
therein only constitute evidence of the fact that gave rise to the
execution of such documents and of the date of the execution
of the same.

genuineness.

Proof of official record; attestation of a copy

Public documents as evidence

1. While a public document does not require the
authentication imposed upon a private document, there is
a necessity for showing to the court that indeed a record of
the official acts of official bodies, tribunals or of public officers
exists. How is this effected? Section 24 of Rule 132, as amended,
supplies the answer. The record of a public document may be
evidenced by:
(a) An official publication thereof; or

Under Sec. 23 of Rule 132, when a public officer, in the
performance of his duty, makes an entry in the public record,
the document of such entry is deemed prima facie evidence
of the fact stated in the entry. In Kummer v. People, G.R.
No. 174461, September 11, 2013, for example, the Court
considered the entries made by a government forensic chemist
in a chemistry report as prima facie evidence of the facts
stated therein. This is because such entries were made by a
public officer in the performance of his duty.

(b) A copy of the document attested by the officer
having legal custody of the record or by the attestation
of his or her deputy; if the record is not kept in the

208

EVIDENCE

(The Bar Lectures Series)

Philippines, the attestation must be accompanied with a
certificate that such officer has the custody;
(i) If the office in which the record is kept is
in a foreign country which is a contracting party to
a treaty or convention to which the Philippines is
also a party, or considered a public document under
such treaty or convention pursuant to paragraph (c),
Sec. 19 of Rule 132, the certificate or its equivalent
shall be in the form prescribed by such treaty or
convention subject to reciprocity granted to public
documents originating from the Philippines.
(ii) If the office in which the record is kept is
in a foreign country which is not a contracting party
to a treaty or convention referred to in the previous
sentence, the certificate may be made by a secretary
of the embassy or legation, consul-general, consul,
vice-consul, or consular agent or by any officer in
the foreign service of the Philippines stationed in
the foreign country in which the record is kept, and
authenticated by the seal of his or her office.

It has been held that the certification mentioned above
refers only to official acts of the sovereign authority, official
bodies and tribunals, and public officers of the Philippines, or
of a foreign country, as found in Sec. 19(a) of Rule 132. It does
not include other public documents like one acknowledged
before a notary public abroad. The notarized document need
not be certified by a consular officer because Sec. 24 of Rule
132 refers only to letter “a” of Sec. 19 of Rule 132 (TujanMilitante v. Nustad, G.R. No. 209518, June 19, 2017).
2. The attestation referred to in the preceding number
must “state, in substance, that the copy is a correct copy of
the original, or a specific part thereof, as the case may be.
The attestation must be under the official seal of the attesting
officer, if there be any, or if he be the clerk of a court having
a seal, under the seal of such court” (Sec. 25, Rule 132, Rules
of Court; Government of Hongkong Special Administrative
Region v. Munoz, G.R. No. 207342, November 7, 2017).

CHAPTER IV

—

OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE

3. The certificate and attestation are required because
of the general rule on the “irremovability of public records”
embodied in Sec. 26 of Rule 132, thus:
"SEC. 26. Irremovability of public record. — Any
public record, an official copy of which is admissible
In evidence, must not be removed from the office In
which It Is kept, except upon order of a court where
the inspection of the record Is essential to the just
determination of a pending case.”

4. Considering that the certificate or its equivalent is
prima facie evidence of the due execution and genuineness of
the document involved, a document that is accompanied by
said certificate or its equivalent may be presented in evidence
without further proof. The certificate shall not be required
when a treaty or convention between a foreign country
and the Philippines has abolished the requirement, or has
exempted the document itself from this formality (Sec. 24,
Rule 132, Rules of Court). This is in consonance with Art. 3 of
the Apostille Convention.
Proof of foreign laws; doctrine of processual presumption
(presumed-identity)

To prove a foreign law, the party invoking it must present
copy
thereof and comply with Secs. 24 and 25 of Rule 132 as
a
mentioned in the preceding topic. Where a foreign law is not
pleaded or, even if pleaded, is not proven, the presumption
is that the foreign law is the same as Philippine law (Orion
Savings Bank v. Suzuki, G.R. No. 205487, November 12, 2014),
in accordance with the doctrine of processual presumption.
Special power of attorney executed abroad (Bar 2011)

In one case, a special power of attorney was executed
and acknowledged before a notary public of the state of
Washington, USA, authorizing the son of the principal to file
in the Philippines a suit against certain persons. The power
of attorney did not contain a certificate of authentication

EVIDENCE

210

(The Bar Lectures Series)

by a secretary of the Philippine embassy or legation, consul
general, consul, vice-consul or consular agent or by any officer
in the foreign service of the Philippines stationed in the foreign

country.

The Court held that a notary public in a foreign country
is not one of those who can issue the certificate mentioned
in Sec. 24 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Court. The Court ruled
that non-compliance with said provision will render the
special power of attorney inadmissible in evidence. Not being
duly established in evidence, the special power of attorney
cannot be used by the son to file a suit in representation of
his father. The case filed then is considered as one not filed
by a real party in interest. Not being a real party in interest
and without the authority to pursue the case, the son could
not have validly commenced the case. The argument that the
lack of consular authentication is a mere technicality that can
be brushed aside in order to uphold substantial justice was
also considered as untenable. The failure to have the special
power of attorney authenticated, according to the Court, is
not a mere technicality but a question of jurisdiction. Citing
the previous case of Lopez p. Court of Appeals, 156 SCRA 838,
it was held that jurisdiction over the real party in interest
was never acquired by the courts. As a result, all proceedings
in the lower courts are declared null and void and, thus, set
aside (Heirs of Medina v. Natividad, 572 SCRA 227).
Public record of a private document

A public record of a private document may be proved by
any of the following:

(a) By the original record; or
(b) By a copy thereof attested by the legal custodian
of the record, with an appropriate certificate that such
officer has the custody (Sec. 27, Rule 132, Rules of Court).

CHAPTER IV - OBJECT AND DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE

absence of an official record. How then may the absence of a
record be proven?

Proof of lack of record of a document consists of a written
statement signed by the officer having custody of an official
record or by his deputy. The written statement must contain
the following matters:
(a) there has been a diligent search of the record;
(b) that despite the diligent search, no record of
entry of a specified tenor is found to exist in the records
of his office.

The written statement must be accompanied by a
certificate that such officer has the custody of official records
(Sec. 28, Rule 132, Rules of Court).
Last wills and testaments

Last wills and testaments must undergo an authenti¬
cation process even if they are notarized as required by Art.
806 of the Civil Code of the Philippines. The Rules of Court
(Sec. 19[b], Rule 132), while declaring that the term “public
document” includes one acknowledged before a notary public,
nevertheless, expressly excludes last wills and testaments.
Besides, substantive law provides that no will shall pass
either real or personal property unless proved and allowed in
the proper court (Art. 838, Civil Code of the Philippines). The
same substantive rule is echoed in Sec. 1 of Rule 75 which
provides:
“SECTION 1. Allowance necessary. Conclusive as
to execution. — No will shall pass either real or personal

estate unless It Is proved and allowed In the proper
court. Subject to the right of appeal, such allowance
of the will shall be conclusive as to Its due execution”
(Underscoring supplied).

Proof of lack of record

Explaining alterations in a document

A litigation does not always involve evidence of the
existence of a record. Sometimes, the issue centers on the

any alteration found in a document purported to be genuine.
For such purpose, he may show any of the following:

(a) that the alteration was made by another

without his concurrence; or

(b) that the alteration was made with the consent
of the parties affected by it;
(c) that the alteration was otherwise properly or
innocently made; or

(d) that the alteration did not in any way change
meaning
the
or language of the instrument.

Failure to do any of the above will make the document
inadmissible in evidence (Sec. 31, Rule 132, Rules of Court).

213

Registration of contracts
1. Where a contract is required by law to be registered,
the same must be, as a rule, in a public instrument. For
example, for purposes of registration and convenience,
acts and contracts which have for their object the creation,

transmission, modification or extinguishment of real rights

over immovable property must appear in a public instrument
(Art. 1358, Civil Code of the Philippines).
2. Certain contracts must be in writing or in a public
instrument in order to be valid, Examples: (a) A donation of
an immovable (Art. 749, ibid.); (b) A donation of a movable
with a value exceeding five thousand pesos (Art. 748, ibid.);
(c) A partnership where immovable property or real rights are
contributed (Art. 1771, ibid.).

Proof of documents In an unofficial language

Because the rule provides that a document written in an
unofficial language shall not be admitted as evidence, it must
be accompanied by a translation into English or Filipino. To
avoid interruption of court proceedings, attorneys are required
to have such translation prepared before trial (Sec. 33, ibid.).
Impeachment of judicial record
1. A judicial record refers to the record of judicial
proceedings (Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., p. 762). It does
not only include official entries or files or the official acts of a
judicial officer (Wharton's Criminal Evidence, 11th Ed., §805),
but also the judgment of the court (Black’s Law Dictionary,
p. 762).

2. Section 29 of Rule 132 authorizes the impeachment
of any judicial record if there be evidence of the existence of
any of the following grounds: (a) lack of jurisdiction in the
court or judicial officer; (b) collusion between the parties; or
(c) fraud in the party offering the record, in respect to the
proceedings.

Foreign judgments; divorces

Before a foreign judgment is given presumptive
evidentiary value, the document must first be presented and
admitted in evidence. A divorce obtained abroad is proven
by the divorce decree itself. Indeed, the best evidence of a
judgment is the judgment itself. The decree purports to be a
written act or record of an act of an official body or tribunal of
a foreign country.
Under Secs. 24 and 25 of Rule 132, on the other hand, a
writing or document may be proven as a public or official record
of a foreign country by either (1) an official publication or (2)
a copy thereof attested by the officer having legal custody of
the document. If the record is not kept in the Philippines, such
copy must be (a) accompanied by a certificate issued by the
proper diplomatic or consular officer in the Philippine foreign
service stationed in the foreign country in which the record
is kept, and (b) authenticated by the seal of his office (Vda.
de Catalan u. Catalan-Lee, 665 SCRA 487, 495, February 8,
2012).

Church registries

As early as in the case of U.S. v. Evangelista, 29 Phil. 215,
it has been settled that church registries of births, marriages,
and deaths made subsequent to the promulgation of General
Orders No. 68, promulgated on December 18, 1889, and the
passage of Act No. 190, enacted on August 7, 1901, are no longer
public writings, nor are they kept by duly authorized public
officials. They are private writings and their authenticity
must, therefore, be proved, as are all other private writings
in accordance with the Rules on Evidence (Llemos v. Llemos,
513 SCRA 128; See also Cercado-Siga v. Cercado, Jr., G.R. No.

Chapter V
TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
A. Qualifications of Witnesses
Nature of testimonial or oral evidence
1. Testimonial or oral evidence is evidence elicited
from the mouth of a witness as distinguished from real and
documentary evidence (Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed.,
p. 1323). It is sometimes called viva voce evidence which
literally means “living voice” or by word of mouth. In this kind
of evidence, a human being is called to the stand, is asked
questions, and answers the questions asked of him. The
person who gives the testimony is called a “witness.”
2. Recall that competent evidence means evidence that
is not excluded by the law or rules. It, therefore, means the
eligibility of an evidence to be admitted by the court. When
applied to a witness, competence means that the witness is
qualified to take the stand and testify. It means that he is
fit or eligible to testify on a particular matter in a judicial
proceeding.

If a witness cannot perceive or even if he can perceive but
he cannot remember what he has perceived, he is incompetent
to testify. If he has no personal knowledge of an event the truth
of which he wants to prove, he is also incompetent to testify.
Competence of a witness, therefore, refers to his personal
qualifications to testify. Competence also includes the absence
of any factor that would disqualify him from being a witness.
3. Experience and plain observation will tell us that
the presentation and introduction of every kind of evidence,
whether it be object, demonstrative or documentary evidence,
215

EVIDENCE

216

(The Bar Lectures Series)

need the intervention of a witness. The admission of any
evidence requires its identification by a witness. It is a legal
truth that identification precedes authentication. Without
a witness, no evidence can ever be authenticated. Even the
so-called “self-authenticating documents” need a witness to
identify the document. The reason is simple. Being inanimate,
a document or an object cannot speak for itself.
Presumption in favor of competence of a witness

As a general rule, a person who takes the stand as a
witness is presumed to be qualified to testify. A party who
desires to question the competence of a witness must do so
by making an objection as soon as the facts tending to show
incompetency are apparent (Jones on Evidence, Vol. 3, §796).
Qualifications of a witness

1. As to the qualifications of a witness, Sec. 21, Rule
130 of the Rules of Court, as amended, provides:
“SEC. 21- Witnesses; their qualifications. — Except
as provided in the next succeeding section, all persons
who can perceive, and perceiving, can make known
their perception to others, may be witnesses.
Religious or political belief, interest in the
outcome of the case, or conviction of a crime unless
otherwise provided by law, shall not be a ground for

disqualification."

2. The above provision supplies the basic qualifications
of a witness, namely:
(a) He can perceive; and

(b) He can make known his perception to others
(People v. Corpuz, G.R. No. 208013, July 3, 2017).

To these, we may add the following:
(a) He must take either an oath or an affirmation
(Sec. 1, Rule 132, Rules of Court); and

CHAPTER V - TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
A. Qualifications of Witnesses

217

(b) He must not possess any of the disqualifications
imposed by law or the rules.

Oath or affirmation
1. While the taking of an oath or of an affirmation
is either rarely mentioned and merely glossed over by
commentators in discussing the qualifications of a witness to
take the stand, the rule clearly requires that the examination
of a witness in a trial or hearing shall be done x x x under
oath or affirmation (Ibid.). The willingness to take an oath or
affirmation is an essential qualification of a witness. No court
would and should allow the testimony of someone who desires
to testify but refuses to swear or make an affirmation.
2. A person is not qualified to be a witness if he is
incapable of understanding the duty to tell the truth. An oath
or affirmation is necessary for the witness to recognize the
duty to tell the truth. The oath of a witness signifies that he
is swearing to the Creator “to tell the truth and nothing but
the truth” and that if he does not, he will later on answer for
all the lies he is guilty of. Of course, in the early stages of
legal history, this was concededly the underlying reason for
requiring an oath before a witness testifies. In modern times,
this reason may have been obscured by a universal shift in
moral values but the oath is, nevertheless, required, as a
rule, even if, to many, the oath appears merely to be a pious
incantation or a meaningless ritual which must simply be
done to be allowed to testify.
3. The issue which a judge must resolve before a
witness is allowed to take the stand is whether the witness
understands the nature of an oath, realizes the moral duty to

tell the truth, and understands the prospects of being punished
for a falsehood. This understanding is not necessarily inferred
from the age of the witness. One American case (People v.
Berry [1968], 260 CA2d 649, 67 CR 312) ruled that it is not
required that the understanding of the importance of an oath
be a detailed one. It is enough that the witness understands
and believes that some earthly evil will occur to him for lying.

4. Not all may want to take an oath for reasons of
religion or the lack of it. Thus, the rule in this jurisdiction
affords the courts the flexibility to deal with those who refuse
to being sworn by requiring the witness to make an affirmation
instead. Consider this hypothetical:
Suppose that the prosecution calls a witness and
offers his testimony to prove that it was indeed the
accused who ran over the victim with a car. Here goes the
brief exchange between the bailiff or appropriate court
personnel and the supposed witness:

“Sir, please raise your right hand.”

The supposed witness retorts: “For what?”
The bailiff snaps: “You are going to be sworn before
you testify, Sir.”

“No! I will not!”
“Do you instead want to make an affirmation?”
“I won’t do that either!”
The next most probable scenario is of the court dismissing
the proposed witness. Most likely, that person will not be
allowed to testify. This is because he failed to meet the oath or
affirmation requirement.
Ability to perceive

A witness must beable to perceive an event. Thus, it would
be absurd to ask a blind man what he saw, or a deaf person
what he heard. Corollary to this capacity to perceive is the
requirement that the witness must have personal knowledge
of the facts surrounding the subject matter of his testimony.
Sec. 22 of Rule 130 explicitly requires that a witness testify
only to those facts which he or she knows of his or her personal
knowledge, i.e., those which are derived from his or her own
perception. When the witness takes an oath or an affirmation
to tell the truth, he cannot live up to that oath or affirmation
without his ability to show that his testimony is based on his

—

A. Qualifications of Witnesses

219

personal knowledge. Without this personal knowledge, the
witness lacks the competence to testify. To illustrate:

A witness is called to testify in a defamation suit for
alleged defamatory acts committed against the offended
party on March 27, 2015 at the corner of XYZ and ABC
Sts. in Manila. He willingly took the oath.
Q: Sir, where were you on the 27th of March 2015
at around 7:30 in the evening?

A: I was in Israel, Sir, for a pilgrimage.
Obviously, the witness will be dismissed from the stand.
The court has no use of him. He is incompetent for the purpose
for which he was called. While taking the oath enabled him
to meet the first requirement for competency, he miserably
failed the next test. He did not perceive anything about the
incident and could offer no facts about the incident based on
his personal knowledge.
Ability to make known the perception to others

1. The ability of the witness to make known his
perception to the court involves two factors: (a) ability
to remember what has been perceived; and (b) ability to
communicate the remembered perception. Consider a witness
who has taken the oath and has personal knowledge of the
event on which he is going to testify. Imagine the exchange
that follows in the courtroom:

Q: What incident, if any, occurred... etc... etc....

A: Sorry, sir. I... can’t recall... I don’t remember.

A witness is presented to testify on a matter he has
perceived. If he cannot remember what he perceived, he
cannot be a competent witness.
2. Deaf-mutes are not necessarily incompetent as
witnesses. They are competent where they can: (1) understand
and appreciate the sanctity of an oath; (2) comprehend facts

220

CHAPTER V— TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE

221

A. Qualifications of Witnesses

they are going to testify to; and (3) communicate their ideas
through a qualified interpreter (People v. Tuangco, 345 SCRA

429).
Competency and credibility (Bar 2004)

1. Competence is a matter of law or, in this jurisdiction,
also a matter of rule. Credibility of a witness has nothing
to do with the law or the rules. It refers to the weight and
trustworthiness or reliability of the testimony. In deciding the
competence of a witness, the court will not inquire into the
trustworthiness of a witness.
2. Accordingly, a prevaricating witness or one who has
given contradicting testimonies is still a competent witness
(U.S. v. Cook, 949 F2d 289 [10th Cir. 1991]). Although he may
be competent as a witness, his testimony may not be given
much weight by the court or no weight at all if the court deems
him not worthy of belief. The competence of the witness must,
hence, be sharply distinguished from his credibility.
3. Competency of a witness has reference to the
basic qualifications of a witness as his capacity to perceive
and communicate his perception to others. It also includes
the absence of any of the disqualifications imposed upon a
witness (Secs. 20-24, Rule 130, Rules of Court). Credibility
of a witness refers to the believability of a witness and has
nothing to do with the law or the rules. It refers to the weight
and trustworthiness or reliability of the testimony.
In deciding the competence of a witness, the court will
not inquire into the trustworthiness of a witness. As earlier
mentioned, a witness who has given contradicting testimonies
is still a competent witness (U.S. v. Cook, 949 F2d 289 [10th
Cir. 1991]). Bias is not even a basis for declaring a witness
incompetent to testify (U.S. v. Cervantes-Pacheco, 826 F2d
310 [5th Cir. 1987]).
4. Drug abuse will not render a person incompetent to
testify (U.S. v. Behrens, 689 F.2d 154 [10th Cir. 1982]) (Bar
2011). Drug abuse becomes relevant only if the witness was
under the influence of drugs at the time he is testifying or at

the time the events in question were observed (U.S. u. Novo
Sampol, 636 F.2d 621 [D.C. Cir. 1980]). While bias and drug
abuse may not be grounds for barring a witness from testifying,
they may serve as grounds for attacking the credibility of a
witness.
5. Questions concerning the credibility of a witness are
best addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court as
it is in the best position to observe his demeanor and bodily
movements (Llanto v. Alzona, 450 SCRA 288). The Supreme
Court generally defers to the trial court’s assessment because
it has the singular opportunity to observe the demeanor of
witnesses and their manner of testifying (People v. Bustamante,
533 SCRA 179; People u. Solina, G.R. No. 196784, January 13,
2016).

6.

Findings of the trial court, its calibration of the

testimony of the witnesses, and its assessment of the probative

weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on said
findings are accorded respect if not conclusive effect (Ricalde
v. People, G.R. No. 211002, January 21, 2015).
Findings of the lower courts with respect to the credibility
rape victim, for example, are conclusive (People v.
a
of
Dayapdapan, G.R. No. 209040, December 9, 2015).
Factors that do not affect the competency of a witness (Bar
2011)

1. Under Sec. 21 of Rule 130, as amended, except as
provided by the law and the rules, the following factors do not,
as a general rule, constitute a disqualification of a witness:
(a) religious belief;
(b) political belief;

(c) interest in the outcome of the case; or
(d) conviction of a crime, unless otherwise provided
by law (Example: those who have been convicted of
falsification of a document, perjury or false testimony
are disqualified from being witnesses to a will) (Art.

EVIDENCE

222

(The Bar Lectures Series)

821[2], Civil Code of the Philippines) (Bar 2011). As
a consequence, these persons may not also testify as
witnesses in the probate of a will where the subject of the
testimony is the very fact of execution of the will in their
presence.

2. The relationship of a witness with a party does
ipso
facto render him a biased witness in criminal cases
not
quantum of evidence is proof beyond reasonable
the
where
doubt. There is no reason why the same principle should not
apply to a civil case where the quantum of evidence is only
preponderance of evidence (Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Chiong,
543 SCRA 308). (Bar 1994)
Findings of credibility of a witness by the trial court

The general rule is that the trial court's calibration of the
testimony of the witnesses, its assessment and the probative
weight thereof, as well as its conclusions on the credibility
of the witnesses on which said findings were anchored, are
accorded with great respect. This great respect rests in the
trial court’s first-hand access to the evidence presented during

the trial, and in its direct observation of the witnesses and
their demeanor while they testify on the occurrences and the
events attested to (People v. Santos, G.R. No. 223142, January
17, 2018). From its vantage point, the trial court is in the best
position to determine the truthfulness of witnesses (People v.
Amarela, G.R. Nos. 225642-43, January 17, 2018).
Child witness; meaning (Bar 2012)

1. A “child witness” is any person who, at the time of
giving testimony, is below the age of 18 years (Sec. 4[a], Rule
on Examination of a Child Witness, AM. 004-07-SC).

2. May a person over 18 years old be considered as a
child? In child abuse cases, a child includes one over 18 years
but is found by the court as unable to fully take care of himself
or protect himself from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation,
or discrimination because of a physical or mental disability or

condition (Ibid.).

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
A. Qualifications of Witnesses

223

Competency of a child witness; presumption; competency

examination
1. Every child is presumed qualified to be a witness.
This is the presumption established by Sec. 6 of the Rule on
Examination of a Child Witness and to rebut the presumption
of competence enjoyed by a child, the burden of proof lies
on the party challenging his competence (Sec. 6[b], Rule
on Examination of a Child Witness). In fact, jurisprudence
has consistently given full weight and credence to a child’s
testimony. Youth and immaturity are badges of truth and
sincerity (People v. Entrampas, G.R. No. 212161, March 29,
2017).
2. When the court finds that substantial doubt exists
regarding the ability of the child to perceive, remember,
communicate, distinguish truth from falsehood, or appreciate
the duty to tell the truth in court, the court shall conduct a
competency examination of the child. The court may do so motu
proprio or on motion of a party (Sec. 6, Rule on Examination of
a Child Witness).

A party who seeks a competency examination must
present proof of necessity of a competency examination. Proof
of such necessity must be grounded on reasons other than the
age of the child because such age, in itself, is not a sufficient
basis for a competency examination (Sec. 6[a], ibid.).
3. The competency examination of a child witness is
not open to the public. Only the following are allowed to attend
the examination:
(a) The judge and necessary court personnel;
(b) The counsel for the parties;
(c) The guardian ad litem;
(d) One or more support persons for the child; and
(e) The defendant, unless the court determines
that competence can be fully evaluated in his absence
(Sec. 6[c], ibid.).

EVIDENCE

224

(The Bar Lectures Series)

The competency examination of the child shall be
conducted only by the judge. If the counsels of the parties
desire to ask questions, they cannot do so directly. Instead,
they are allowed to submit questions to the judge which he
may ask the child in his discretion (Sec. 6[d], ibid.).

CHAPTER V — TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
B. Disqualifications of Witnesses

4.

5. The questions asked at the competency examination
shall be appropriate to the age and developmental level of the
child. The questions shall not be related to the issues at the
trial but shall focus on the ability of the child to remember,
communicate, distinguish between truth and falsehood and
appreciate the duty to testify truthfully (Sec. 6[e], ibid.).
6. The assessment of the competency of the child is
designed to be a continuing one. The court has the duty of
continuously assessing the competence of the child throughout
his testimony (Sec. 6[f], ibid.).

7. The court may order that the testimony of the
child be taken by live-link television if there is a substantial
likelihood that the child would suffer trauma from testifying
in the presence of the accused, his counsel or the prosecutor as
the case may be. The trauma must be of a kind which would
impair the completeness or truthfulness of the testimony of
the child (Sec. 25[f], ibid.). (Bar 2005)
B. Disqualifications of Witnesses
Prior to the 2019 amendments to the Rules on Evidence,
Rule 130 of the Rules of Court expressly provided for the
disqualification of a witness on account of mental incapacity
or immaturity. However, this was deleted considering that by
such incapacity, a witness would already be disqualified under
Sec. 21 of Rule 130 because he or she would be incapable of
intelligently making known his or her perception to others. Of
course, if the mental incapacity is not such that would render
one incapable of intelligently making known one’s perception
to others, then such person would still be qualified to be a
witness.

226

The same goes for immaturity in that children whose
mental maturity is such as to render them incapable of

perceiving the facts respecting which they are examined and
of relating them truthfully were expressly disqualified under
Rule 130. This was deleted considering that under the Rule
on Examination of Child Witness, every child is presumed
qualified to be a witness.
Marital disqualification rule (Spousal immunity) (Bar 2000,
2010, 2019)
1. The marital disqualification rule is provided for in
Sec. 23 of Rule 130, as amended, viz.:
“SEC. 23- Disqualification by reason of marriage.
During their marriage, neither the husband or the wife
cannot testify against the other without the consent of
the affected spouse, except in a civil case by one against
the other, or in a criminal case for a crime committed by
one against the other or the latter's direct descendants
or ascendants. (22a)”

—

2. The rule prohibiting testimony by one spouse against
the other is based on society’s intent to preserve the marriage
relations and promote domestic peace. A spouse testifying
against the other creates an ugly sight inimical to society’s
interests. The rule prohibiting testimony in favor of the spouse
is intended to discourage the commission of perjury.

The case of Alvarez v. Ramirez, 473 SCRA 72, gives the
specific reasons for the rule, thus:
(a) There is identity of interests between husband
and wife;

(b) If one were to testify for or against the other,
there is a consequent danger of perjury;
(c) The policy of the law is to guard the security
and confidences of private life, even at the risk of an
occasional failure of justice, and to prevent domestic
disunion and unhappiness; and

226

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

(d) Where there is want of domestic tranquility,
there is danger of punishing one spouse through the
hostile testimony of the other.
3. The marital disqualification rule, under Sec. 23 of
Rule 130, forbids the husband or the wife to testify for or
against the other without the consent of the affected spouse
except in those cases authorized by the rule. The prohibition
extends not only to testimony adverse to the spouse but also
to testimony in favor of the spouse. It also applies to both
criminal and civil cases because the rule does not distinguish.
4. In order that the husband or wife may claim the
privilege, it is essential that they be validly married. If they
are not, there is no privilege (Moran, Comments on the Rules of
Court, Vol. 5, p. 176, citing State v. Hancock, 28 Nev. 300, 32,
Pac. 95). The rule, therefore, does not cover illicit cohabitation.

Section 23 of Rule 130 requires not only a valid marriage
but the existence of that valid marriage at the moment the
witness-spouse gives the testimony.
5. The rule applies whether or not the witness-spouse
party
to the case but the other spouse must be a party.
is a
spouse must be a party is evident from the
the
other
That
phrase "... neither the husband nor the wife may testify for or
against the other..."

6. The prohibited testimony is one that is given or
offered during the existence of the marriage. Section 23
explicitly refers to testimony “fdjuring their marriage..."
Hence, the rule does not prohibit testimony for or against the
other after the marriage is dissolved. When the marriage is
dissolved on the grounds provided for by law like annulment
or declaration of nullity, the rule can no longer be invoked. One
may now testify for or against the other despite an objection
interposed by the latter because there is no more marriage to
speak of.

7. If the testimony for or against the other spouse
is offered during the existence of the marriage, it does not
matter if the facts subject of the testimony occurred or came

CHAPTER V

—

TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
B. Disqualifications of Witnesses

227

to the knowledge of the witness-spouse before the marriage.

The affected spouse may still invoke the rule by objecting to
the testimony as long as it is offered during the marriage.
Nothing in the tenor of the rule allows a contrary view.
To illustrate: Before the marriage of W to H, she
witnessed the murder of X by H but she never reported what
she witnessed to the authorities. A year after the murder,
H and W married. Barely six months after the marriage, W
became a battered wife and to get even with H, she decided to
report the murder to the police, (a) May she testify against H
over the latter’s objection even if the murder took place before
the marriage? Answer: She cannot testify over the objection
of H. The situation is covered by the marital disqualification
rule, (b) Suppose a year after the marriage, the marriage
is annulled, may W now testify despite the objection of H?
Answer: She can now testify after the marriage is annulled.
The prohibition no longer applies since the testimony is to be
offered after, not during the marriage.
8. Be it noted that the testimony is prohibited only
over the objection of the affected spouse or the spouse against
whom the testimony is offered. It is the latter spouse who has
the right to object to the competency of the spouse-witness. It
goes without saying that the testimony is admissible where
no objection is interposed by the spouse who has the right to
invoke the prohibition. In other words, the benefit of the rule
may be waived and it may be done so impliedly or expressly.

Exceptions to the marital disqualification rule
1. In the following instances, a spouse may testify for
or against the other even without the consent of the latter:
(a) in a civil case by one against the other; or
(b) in a criminal case for a crime committed by one
against the other, or the latter’s direct descendants or
ascendants (Sec. 23, Rule 130, Rules of Court).

2. The phrase “or the latter’s direct descendants or
ascendants” did not appear in the old rules. Section 19(c) of

228

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

the then Rule 130 only mentioned two exceptions; (a) in a civil
case by one against the other; or (b) in a criminal case for a
crime committed by one against the other.
The current rule has been harmonized with the Supreme
Court ruling in Ordono u. Daquigan, 62 SCRA 270, allowing
the wife to testify against her husband who was accused of
raping his daughter. Here, the Court concluded that a rape
perpetrated by the father against his daughter is a crime
committed by him against his wife.

In Ordoiio, the Court ruled that the correct rule is the one
laid down in Cargill u. State, 35 ALR 133, 220 Pac 64, 25 Oki.
314, which held that:
“The rule that the injury must amount to a physical
wrong upon the person is too narrow x x x. The better rule
is that, when an offense directly attacks or directly and
vitally impairs the conjugal relations, it comes within the
exception to the statute ...”

3. If the wife sues the husband for fraudulently
embezzling the paraphernal funds of the former, the reason
for the prohibition in the rule ceases. The wife can now testify
against the husband. Also, if the wife is sued for adultery, the
husband cannot be barred from testifying against the wife.
In a suit for annulment of marriage, each spouse can testify
against each other. The same rule applies when the husband
is sued by the wife for bigamy.
4. In order for a spouse to be allowed to testify against
the other in a civil case, the case must be a “civil case by one
against the other.” This contemplates a situation where one
spouse is a plaintiff or petitioner and the other spouse is a
defendant or respondent. Where the civil case is between a
spouse and the direct descendants or ascendants of the other,
the marital disqualification rule still applies. Thus, if the wife
sues the father of her husband for collection of a loan, the
husband may be barred from testifying against the wife upon
the objection of the latter. This is because the civil case is not

—

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
B. Disqualifications of Witnesses

229

by one spouse against the other but between a spouse and the
parent of the other.

5. The rule is different in a criminal case. In a criminal
case, the privilege of one to testify against the other is not
confined to crimes committed by one against the other, but
covers crimes committed by one against the direct descendants
or ascendants of the latter like the latter’s children or parents.
However, crimes committed by the spouse against a spouse’s
collateral relatives like uncles, aunties, cousins or nephews
and nieces are not covered by the exception because they are
neither direct descendants nor ascendants.
Testimony where spouse Is accused with others

May a spouse testify in a trial where the other spouse is
a co-accused? Consider the following:

Illustration:
Accused-appellant and his brothers were jointly
accused with parricide for the alleged killing of their own
father. One of the witnesses presented by the prosecution
against all the accused was the wife of accused-appellant.
May the wife testify in the proceedings against all the
accused?
In People u. Quidato, Jr., 297 SCRA 1, the Court ruled
in the affirmative but, likewise, held that the testimony of
the wife in reference to her husband must be disregarded
since the husband timely objected thereto under the
marital disqualification rule. The Court explained that
the disqualification is between husband and wife, but the
rule does not preclude the wife from testifying when it
involves other parties or accused. Hence, the wife could
testify in the murder case against the brothers who were
jointly tried with her husband. The Court also stressed,
however, that the testimony cannot be used against
accused-appellant directly or through the guise of taking
judicial notice of the proceedings in the murder case
without violating the marital disqualification rule. “What
cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly.”

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
B. Disqualification* of Witneaaaa

Testimony by the estranged spouse (Bar 2006)

1. Section 23 of Rule 130 prohibits testimony by one
spouse against the other without the consent of the latter
“during their marriage.” Literally, this prohibition would
cover testimony by the estranged spouse because a separation
“de facto" does not sever the marriage bonds and the spouses
remain legally married to each other. Testimony under such
a situation would still technically be testimony “during their
marriage.” This literal construction of the rule has, however,
been rejected by the Supreme Court.

2. Whether or not the estranged spouse may testify
against the other is illustrated by the following facts:
Susan Ramirez, the respondent, is the complaining
witness in a criminal case for arson of her house against
the accused Maximo Alvarez, the petitioner, who is the
estranged husband of Esperanza Alvarez, the sister of
the respondent and who also lives in the house allegedly

burned.
During the trial of the case, the private prosecutor
called Esperanza Alvarez to the witness stand as the first
witness against her husband. Petitioner and his counsel
initially raised no objection.

Subsequently, before the continuation of the
testimony of his estranged wife, petitioner, through
counsel, filed a motion to disqualify Esperanza Alvarez
from testifying against him. The trial court issued an
order disqualifying Esperanza Alvarez from further
testifying and deleting her testimony from the records.
The prosecution filed a motion for reconsideration but
was denied.

The denial prompted respondent Susan Ramirez,
the complaining witness, to file with the Court of Appeals
a petition for certiorari with application for preliminary
injunction and temporary restraining order. The Court
of Appeals rendered a decision nullifying and setting
aside the assailed orders issued by the trial court. In a
subsequent petition for review on certiorari, the issue

231

sought to be resolved by the Supreme Court was whether
Esperanza Alvarez can testify against her estranged

husband.

In sustaining the Court of Appeals allowing the testimony
of Esperanza Alvarez, the Court explained:
“x x x like all other general rules, the marital
disqualification rule has its own exceptions, both in civil
actions between the spouses and in criminal cases for
offenses committed by one against the other. Like the
rule itself, the exceptions are backed by sound reasons
which, in the excepted cases, outweigh those in support
of the general rule. For instance, where the marital and
domestic relations are so strained that there is no more
harmony to be preserved nor peace and tranquility which
mav be_disturbed, the reason based upon such harmony
and tranquility fails. In such a case, identity of interests
disappears and the consequent danger of periurv based
on that identity is non-existent. Likewise, in such a
situation, the security and confidences of private life.
which the law aims at protecting, will be nothing but
ideals, which through their absence, merely leave a void
in the unhappy home" (Underscoring supplied).

Obviously, the offense of arson attributed to
petitioner directly impairs the conjugal relation between
him and his wife Esperanza. His act, as embodied in the
Information for arson filed against him, eradicates all the
major aspects of marital life such as trust, confidence,
respect and love by which virtues the conjugal relationship
survives and flourishes.

As correctly observed by the Court of Appeals:
“The act of private respondent in setting fire to the
house of his sister-in-law Susan Ramirez, knowing fully
well that his wife was there, and in fact with the alleged
intent of injuring the latter, is an act totally alien to the
harmony and confidences of marital relation which the
disqualification primarily seeks to protect. The criminal
act complained of had the effect of directly and vitally
impairing the conjugal relation. It underscored the fact
that the marital and domestic relations between her and

EVIDENCE

232

—

(The Bar Lectures Series)

the accused-husband have become so strained that there
is no more harmony, peace or tranquility to be preserved,
“x x x in such a case, identity is non-existent, In such a
situation, the security and confidences of private life
which the law aims to protect are nothing but ideals which
through their absence, merely leave a void in the unhappy
home" (Alvarez u. Ramirez, 473 SCRA 72; Underscoring
supplied). Thus, there is no longer any reason to apply the
marital disqualification rule.

‘It should be stressed that as shown by the records,
prior to the commission of the offense, the relationship
between petitioner and his wife was already strained.
In fact, they were separated de facto almost six months
before the incident. Indeed, the evidence and facts
presented reveal that the preservation of the marriage
between petitioner and Esperanza is no longer an interest
the State aims to protect” (Alvarez v. Ramirez, supra).

Marital privileged communications (Bar 1995, 2004, 2010)
1. There are two independent codal provisions which
cover marital disqualifications. The first is Sec. 23 of Rule
130 (Disqualification by reason of marriage) and the second is
Sec. 24(a) of Rule 130 (Disqualification by reason of privileged
communication).

2. Under Sec. 24 of Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, there
are certain persons who cannot testify as to matters learned
in confidence. Among those subject to the rule are legitimate
spouses. The provision states as follows:
“SEC. 24. Disqualification by reason of privileged

communication. — The following persons cannot testify
as to matters learned in confidence in the following
cases:

(a) The husband or the wife, during or after the
marriage, cannot be examined without the consent of the
other as to any communication received in confidence
by one from the other during the marriage except in a
civil case by one against the other, or in a criminal case
for a crime committed by one against the other or the
latter's direct descendants or ascendants."

Under paragraph (a), the husband or the wife

cannot be examined without the consent of the other as to any
communication received in confidence by one from the other
during the marriage.

The application of the rule requires the presence of the
following elements:
(a) there must be a valid marriage between the
husband and wife;
(b) there is a communication received in confidence
by one from the other; and
(c) the confidential communication was received
during the marriage.

4. “The law insures absolute freedom of communication
between the spouses by making it privileged x x x. Neither
may be examined without the consent of the other as to
any communication received in confidence by one from the
other during the marriage, save for specified exceptions.
But one thing is freedom of communication; quite another
is a compulsion for each one to share what one knows with
the other and this has nothing to do with the duty of fidelity
that each owes to the other” (Zulueta v. Court of Appeals, 253
SCRA 699).
5. Since the application of the rule requires a
confidential information received by one spouse from the
other during the marriage, information acquired by a spouse
before the marriage, even if received confidentially, will not
fall squarely with the provisions of Sec. 24(a) of Rule 130.
However, divulging the same may be objected to under Sec. 22
of Rule 130 upon proper objection as long as the information is
sought to be revealed during the marriage through a testimony
for or against the affected spouse. The tenor of Sec. 22 of Rule
130 does not distinguish as to when the information subject
of the testimony was acquired and, thus, may cover matters
which occurred or to adverse information acquired prior to
the marriage. It is sufficient that the witness-spouse testifies

r
234

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Senes)

during the marriage. It is unlike Sec. 24(a) which explicitly
requires that the confidential information be received during
the marriage.

Note that Sec. 24(a) of Rule 130 also requires that the
information received in confidence during the marriage be
"by one from the other.” The implication is clear: confidential
information received from a third person is not covered by the
privilege.
6. For the information to be confidential, it must be
made during and by reason of the marital relations and
is intended not to be shared with others. Without such
intention, common reason suggests that the information is
not confidential. Thus, in U.S. v. Antipolo, 37 Phil. 726, the
wife was allowed, in a prosecution for murder, to testify as to
her husband’s dying declaration regarding the identity of the
assailant because there was no intent of confidentiality in the
information. The declaration is intended to be communicated
after the husband’s death because it was made in the
furtherance of justice.

7. The marital privilege rule, being a rule of evidence,
may be waived by failure of the claimant to object timely to
its presentation or by any conduct that may be construed as
implied consent (Lacurom v. Jacoba, 484 SCRA 206).
Distinctions between the marital disqualification rule and
the marital privileged communication rule
1. Section 24(a) of Rule 130 has reference to confidential
communications received by one spouse from the other during
the marriage. The marital disqualification rule under Sec.
23 of Rule 130 does not refer to confidential communications
between the spouses. It will not come into play when the
fact pattern in a problem makes reference to confidential
communications between husband and wife during the
marriage. Section 24(a) of Rule 130 will, instead, apply.

However, communications that are not intended to be
confidential because they were uttered in the presence of third

CHAPTER V

—

B. Disqualifications of Witnesses

235

parties are not deemed confidential even when made during
the marriage, but Sec. 23 could apply, instead of Sec. 24(a),
when used as parts of a testimony for or against the party¬

spouse.

The marital privileged communication rule in Sec. 24(a)
applies only to testimonies of a confidential nature received by
one spouse from the other during the marriage and obviously
does not include acts merely observed by the spouse unless
such acts are intended as a means of conveying confidential
communication-ty one to the other.
2. Sec. 23 of Rule 130 includes facts, occurrences or
information even prior to the marriage unlike Sec. 24(a) which
applies only to confidential information received during the
marriage. In this sense, Sec. 23 is broader because it prevents
testimony for or against the spouse on any fact and not merely

a disclosure of confidential information.
3. When the marital privileged communication rule
under Sec. 24(a) applies, the spouse affected by the disclosure
of the information or testimony may object even after the
dissolution of the marriage. The privilege does not cease just
because the marriage has ended. The marital disqualification
rule under Sec. 23, on the other hand, can no longer be invoked
once the marriage is dissolved. It may be asserted only during
the marriage. In this sense, Sec. 24(a) is broader.
4. The marital disqualification rule in Sec. 23 requires
that the spouse for or against whom the testimony is offered
is a party to the action. This is not required in the marital
privileged communication rule in Sec. 24(a) which applies
regardless of whether the spouses are parties or not.

Note: In the marital disqualification rule in Sec. 23,
the prohibition is testimony for or against the other. In Sec.
24(a), what is prohibited is the examination of a spouse as to
matters received in confidence by one from the other during
the marriage.

Attorney-client privilege (Bar 2008)
1.

The following is the applicable provision under Rule
130 involving privileged communications between an attorney
and his or her client:
"SEC. 24. Disqualification by reason of privileged
communications. — The following persons cannot
testify as to matters learned in confidence In the
following cases:

xxx
(b) An attorney or person reasonably believed bv
the client to be licensed to engage in the practice of law
cannot, without the consent of the client, be examined
as to any communication made by the client to him
her, or his or her advice given thereon in the course of,
or with a view to, professional employment, nor can an
attorney’s secretary, stenographer, or clerk, or other
persons assisting the attorney be examined, without the
consent of the client and his or her employer, concerning
any fact the knowledge of which has been acquired in
such capacity, except in the following cases:
(i) Furtherance of crime or fraud. If the
services or advice of the lawver were sought or

obtained to enable or aid anyone to commit or
plan to commit what the client knew or reasonably
should have known to be a crime or fraud;
(ii) Claimants through same deceased
client As to a communication relevant to an
issue between parties who claim through the
same deceased client, regardless of whether the
claims are bv testate or intestate or bv inter vivos

transaction;
(iii) Breach of dutv bv lawyer or client. As to
a communication relevant to an Issue of breach of
dutv by the lawver to his or her client, or bv the
client to his or her lawyer:
(iv) Document attested bv the lawyer. As to
a communication relevant to an issue concerning

an attested document to which the lawyer is an
attesting witness: or
(v) Joint clients. As to a communication
relevant to a matter of common Interest between

two (2) or more clients If the communication
was made by any of them to a lawyer retained or

consulted In common, when offered In an action
between any of the clients, unless they have
expressly agreed otherwise-

xxx"

2. The following requisites must be present for the
privilege to arise:
(a) There must be a communication made by the
client to the attorney, or a person reasonably believed
by the client to be licensed to practice law, or an advice
given by said person to his client;
(b) The communication or advice must be given
either in the course of the professional employment or
with a view to professional employment.
(c) The communication is not relevant to the
following matters or issues:
(i) Seeking or obtaining the services or advice
of a lawyer to enable or aid anyone to commit or plan
to commit what the client knew or reasonably should
have known to be a crime or fraud;
(ii) An issue between parties who claim
through the same deceased client, regardless of
whether the claims are by testate or intestate or by
inter vivos transaction;

(iii) Breach of duty by the lawyer , to his or her
client, or by the client to his or her lawyer;
(iv) An issue concerning an attested document
to which the lawyer is an attesting witness;

238

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

(v) A matter of common interest between two
or more clients if the communication was made by
any of them to a lawyer retained or consulted in
common, when offered in an action between any
of the clients, unless they have expressly agreed
otherwise.

3. The present rules do not require a perfected
attorney-client relationship for the privilege to exist. The
communications between the attorney and the client no longer
need to be in the course of an actual professional employment.
It is enough that the communication or advice be “with a view
to” professional employment (Sec. 24[b], Rule 130, Rules of
Court).

Hence, the privilege is extended to communications
made for the purpose of securing the services of counsel even
if the counsel later refuses the professional relationship. The
insertion of the clause “with a view to” includes preliminary
negotiations within the privilege. Without the clause, it would
seem extremely risky to consult an attorney for the first time
and communicate to him certain sensitive information without
the protection of confidentiality.
4. Accordingly, the privilege is not confined to commu¬
nications regarding actual pending cases. The communications
may refer to anticipated litigations or may not refer to any
litigation at all. It is sufficient that the statements be made in
the course of legitimate professional relationship between the
attorney and the client (Jones on Evidence, Vol. 3, §749).

The communication may be oral or written but is
deemed to extend to other forms of conduct, like physical
demonstration, as long as they are intended to be confidential.
It is, likewise, submitted that the communication between a
client and his lawyer is not deemed lacking in confidentiality
solely because the communication is transmitted by facsimile,
cellular telephone, or other electronic means.

5. It is commonly acknowledged that the privilege does
not extend to communications where the client’s purpose is the

CHAPTER V— TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
B. Disqualifications of Witnesses

239

furtherance of a future intended crime or fraud (8 Wigmore,
Evidence, §§2298, 2299 [McNaughton rev. 1961]; Gardner,
The Crime of Fraud Exception to the Attorney-Client Privilege,
47 A.B.A.J. 708; People u. Sandiganhayan, 341 Phil. 503), or
for the purpose of committing a crime or a tort (U.S. v. Wilson,
798 F.2d 509 [1st Cir. 1986]), or those made in furtherance of
illicit activity (U.S. v. Aucoin, 964 F.2d 1492 [5th Cir. 1992]).
When an attorney’s services are knowingly used to further
crime or fraud, such activity hardly qualifies as “professional
legal services,” an essential element of privilege. Although
communications made when used to further crimes are not
privileged, the discussion of the communications in confidence
with the lawyer after the crime has been committed may still
be privileged even though the earlier ones were not (In re
Federal Grand Jury Proceedings 89-10 [MIA], 938 F.2d 1578
[11th Cir. 1991]).
6. The statements of the client need not be made to the
attorney in person. Those made to the attorney’s secretary,
clerk, stenographer, or other persons assisting the attorney
concerning any fact the knowledge of which has been acquired
by them in such capacity are covered by the privilege. Like the
attorney, their employer, these persons cannot be examined
as to the communication made by the client or the advice
given by the attorney without the client’s consent and also the
employer’s consent (Sec. 24[b], Rule 130, Rules of Court).

7. A lawyer is bound to comply with Canon 21 of the
Code of Professional Responsibility which states that, “a
lawyer shall preserve the confidences and secrets of his client
even after the attorney-client relation is terminated.” The
reason for the prohibition is found in the relation of attorney
and client, which is one of trust and confidence of the highest
degree. A lawyer becomes familiar with all the facts connected
with his client’s case. He learns from his client the weak
points of the action as well as the strong ones. Such knowledge
must be considered sacred and guarded with care (Samala v.
Valencia, 512 SCRA 1; Mercado v. Vitriolo, 459 SCRA 1).

Physician-patient privilege (Bar 1998, 2016, 2018)

The privileged communication between a physician
and his patient is stated as follows in Sec. 24(c) of Rule 130, as
1.

amended:
“SEC. 24. Disqualification by reason of privileged
The following persons cannot
testify as to matters learned In confidence in the
following cases:

communications.

—

XXX

(c) A Physician, psychotherapist or person
reasonably believed bv the patient to be authorized
to__piactice

medicine or psychotherapy cannot In

a civil case, without the consent of the patient,
be examined as to anv confidential communication
made for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment of
the patient’s physical, mental or emotional condition,
including alcohol or drug addiction, between the patient
and his or her physician or psychotherapist. This
Privilege also applies to persons, including members
of the patient’s family, who have participated in the
diagnosis or treatment of the patient under the direction
of the physician or psychotherapist.

A "psychotherapist*’ Is:
(a) A person licensed to practice medicine
engaged in the diagnosis or treatment of a mental

or emotional condition, or
(b) A person licensed as a psychologist bv
the government while similarly engaged,

xxx"

2. This privilege, embodied in Sec. 24(c) of Rule 130,
applies to a civil case, whether the patient is a party or not.
The phraseology of the rule implies that the privilege cannot
be claimed in a criminal case presumably because the interest
of the public in criminal prosecution should be deemed more
important than the secrecy of the communication.

3.

Accordingly, this privilege protects the interest

of the patient. It is designed to promote health, not truth.
It encourages free disclosure in the sickroom by preventing
disclosure in the courtroom. The patient is the person to be
encouraged and he is the holder of the privilege (Metropolitan
Life and Insurance Co. v. Kaufman, 104 Colo. 13, 87 P.2d 758
in McCormick, Evidence, §102).
4. The person against whom the privilege is claimed
is a person duly authorized, or believed by the patient to be
authorized, to practice medicine or psychotherapy. For one to
be considered a psychotherapist, one needs only to be licensed
to practice medicine and does not need to be a psychiatrist,
whereas a psychologist must be licensed by the government.
The privilege also applies to persons, including members
of the patient’s family, who have participated in the diagnosis
or treatment of the patient under the direction of the physician
or psychotherapist.
The information which cannot be disclosed refers to any
confidential communication made for the purpose of diagnosis
or treatment of the patient’s physical, mental or emotional
condition, including alcohol or drug addiction, between the
patient and his or her physician or psychotherapist. Under the
wording of the amended rule, the information need no longer
be one which would blacken the reputation of the patient.
According to the Rules Committee, there is no compelling
reason for such requirement if the physician-patient privilege
is viewed as a good and necessary one and a patient’s physical
condition is considered a private matter.
5. Also, it is opined that the rule does not require that
the relationship between the physician and the patient be a
result of a contractual relationship. It could be the result of a
quasi-contractual relationship as when the patient is seriously
ill and the physician treats him even if he is not in a condition
to give his consent as in the situation described in Art. 2167 of
the Civil Code.
6. The privilege does not apply to shield the commission
of a crime or when the purpose is an unlawful one as to obtain

242

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

narcotics or prohibited drugs in violation of law because there
is no treatment involved. Similarly, where the purpose is to
ask a physician to have one’s appearance disguised by cosmetic
or plastic surgery to escape apprehension, the privilege does
not apply. Common reason suggests that all these cases be
deemed outside the operation of the privilege because the
purpose is not for treatment or prevention of any disease or
injury. (Bar 2018)
7. The privilege survives the death of the patient.
Death does not permit the living to impair the deceased’s
name by disclosing communications held confidential by law.
Thus, in Gonzales v. Court of Appeals, 298 SCRA 322, the
Supreme Court, prevented the disclosure of medical findings
that would tend to blacken the reputation of the patient even
after his death.
8. The privilege may be waived by the patient. The
waiver may be made expressly or impliedly. The waiver
may be by a contract as in medical or life insurance. When
there is disclosure by the patient of the information, there is
necessarily, a waiver. When the patient answers questions on
matters which are supposedly privileged on cross-examination,
the waiver also exists.

There could also be a waiver by operation of law or the
rules. Under Rule 28 of the Rules of Court, the court in which
the action is pending may, in its discretion, order a party to
submit to a physical or mental examination (Sec. 1, Rule 28,
Rules of Court). This happens when the mental or physical
condition of a party is in dispute. The party examined may
request a report of the examination. By doing so, he waives any
privilege he may have in that action regarding the testimony
of every other person who has examined him in respect of the
same examination (Sec. 4, ibid.).
Clergyman-penitent privilege

1. Another privileged communication under the Rules
is as follows:

—

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
B. Disqualifications of Witnesses

243

“SEC. 24. Disqualification by reason of privileged
communications. — The following persons cannot
testify as to matters learned In confidence In the
following cases:

xxx
(d) A minister, priest or person reasonably
believed to be so cannot, without the consent of the
affected person, be examined as to anv communication
or confession made to or anv advice given by him or
her. In his or her professional character. In the coursenf
discipline enjoined bv the church to which the minister
or priest belongs.

xxx”

2. The person making the confession holds the privilege,
and the priest, minister, or person reasonably believed to be so
hearing the confession is prohibited from making a disclosure
of the confession without the consent of the person confessing.
The privilege also extends not only to a confession made
by the penitent but also to any advice given by the minister,
priest, or person reasonably believed to be so. The confession
and the advice must be made or given pursuant to the course
of discipline of the denomination or sect to which the minister
or priest belongs (Sec. 24[d], Rule 130, Rules of Court). Thus,
the minister or priest must be duly ordained or consecrated
by his sect.
The phrase “person making the confession” under the
old rule was changed to “affected person” in order to embrace
non-penitential communications made to a minister or priest
as spiritual advisor, and to remove the impression that the
privilege is limited to clergymen and believers of the Roman
Catholic Church.

3. Not every communication made to a minister
priest
is privileged. The communication must be made
or
pursuant to confessions of sins (Wigmore on Evidence, §848).
As clearly provided in the rule, the advice given as a result ’of

EVIDENCE

244

(The Bar Lectures Series)

the confession must be made in the minister’s “professional
character” (Sec. 24[d], Rule 130, Rules of Court), or in his
“spiritual” capacity. Accordingly, where the penitent discussed
business arrangements with the priest, the privilege does not
apply (U.S. v. Gordon, 493 F. Supp. 822 [7th dr. 1987J).
Privileged communications to public officers

1. As to privileged communications to public officers,
the relevant rule declares:

—

“SEC. 24. Disqualification by reason of privileged
communications.
The following persons cannot
testify as to matters learned in confidence in the
following cases:

xxx
(e) A public officer cannot be examined during or
after his or her tenure, as to communications made to
him or her in official confidence, when the court finds
that the public interest would suffer by the disclosure.

xxx"

2. Under the above rule, communications made to a
public officer in official confidence are privileged when the
court finds that the disclosure would adversely affect the
public interest. It is the interest of the public that is sought
to be protected by the rule. Hence, the disclosure or non¬
disclosure is not dependent on the will of the officer but on
the determination by a competent court. The privilege may be
invoked not only during the term of office of the public officer
but also afterwards (Sec. 24[e], Rule 130, Rules of Court).

3. National security matters and State secrets are, of
course, confidential and a court will most likely uphold the
privilege. A society may not always be able to conduct its
business with total openness and matters affecting national
interest must not be divulged (Guong u. U.S., 860 F.2d 1063
[Fed. dr. 1988J).

Privileged communications In the hands of a third person

Under the last paragraph of Sec. 24, Rule 130 of the Rules
on Evidence, as amended, the communications discussed
above “shall remain privileged, even in the hands of a third
person who may have obtained the information, provided that
the original parties to the communication took reasonable
precaution to protect its confidentiality.” Hence, if the
original parties to the communication did not take reasonable
precaution to protect the same from falling into the hands of
a third person, they may be considered to have waived the
confidentiality thereof.

Executive privilege; Presidential communications privilege

1. The concept of “executive privilege” and its origins
were elucidated in sufficient detail in Senate v. Ermita, 488
SCRA 1. In relation to its American origins, the privilege has
been described as “the power of the government to withhold
information from the public, the courts, and the Congress.”
2. The doctrine of executive privilege found recognition
in Almonte v. Vasquez, 244 SCRA 286. Here, the Court
acknowledged that there are certain types of information
which the government may withhold from the public like
military, diplomatic and national security secrets. Alluding
to foreign jurisprudence, it was ruled that the President and
those who assist him must be free to explore alternatives in
the process of shaping policies and making decisions and to
do so in a way many would be unwilling to express except
privately.

3. Chavez v. Presidential Commission on Good
Government (PCGG), 299 SCRA 744, ruled that there is a
privilege against disclosure on certain matters involving state
secrets regarding the following:
(a) military;
(b) diplomatic; and
(c) other national security matters.

I

346

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lecture* Series)

Again, in Chavez v. Public Estates Authority, 384 SCRA
162, it was similarly held that secrets involving military,
diplomatic, and national security matters, and information on

investigations of crimes by law enforcement agencies before
the prosecution of the accused were exempted from the right to
information. The right to information does not also extend to
presidential conversations, correspondences, and discussions
in closed-door cabinet meetings.
4. However, the ability of the President to prevent
military officers from testifying does not turn on executive
privilege, but on the Chief Executive’s power as commander¬
in-chief to control the actions and speech of members of the
armed forces. The President’s prerogatives as commander-inchief are not hampered by the same limitations as in executive
privilege (Gudani u. Senga, G.R. No. 1 70165, August 15, 2006).

6. The Constitution of the Philippines recognizes the
right of the people to information on matters of public concern
and guarantees access to official records, documents, and
papers pertaining to official acts, transactions, or decisions,
as well as to government research data used as basis for policy
development, subject to such limitations as may be provided
by law (Sec. 7, Art. Ill, 1987 Constitution).
What matters may be disclosed in relation to the right to
information on matters of public concern?

This was actually one of the issues sought to be resolved
in AKBA YAN u. Aquino, 558 SCRA 468. The petitioners in the
case, a tapestry of various personalities like citizens, taxpayers,
congressmen, including non-government organizations,
sought via a petition for mandamus and prohibition to obtain
from respondents in the persons of various government
functionaries, the full text of the Japan-Philippines Economic
Partnership Agreement (JPEPA), information which the
government previously refused to disclose. The petitioners
assert among others, that the refusal of the government
to disclose the documents bearing on the JPEPA violates
their right to information on matters of public concern, and

—

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
B Diaqualiftcatioa* of WitneMe*

347

contravenes other constitutional provisions on transparency,
such as the policy of full disclosure of all transactions involving
public interest. They likewise posit that non-disclosure of the
documents undermines their right to effective and reasonable
participation in all levels of social, political and economic

decision-making.

Respondents do not dispute that the JPEPA, as an
international trade agreement, is a matter of public concern
but they claim that a full disclosure of matters would involve
disclosure of diplomatic negotiations which were then in
progress. They assert that diplomatic negotiations are covered
by the doctrine of executive privilege, thus constituting an
exception to the right to information and the policy of full
public disclosure.
In resolving the conflicting claims of the parties, the
Court first affirmed what it termed “the well-established
jurisprudence that neither the right to information nor the
policy of full disclosure is absolute, there being matters which,
albeit of matters of public concern or public interest, are
recognized as privileged in nature.”
The Court reiterated what it held in previous cases that
the information on inter-government exchanges prior to the
conclusion of treaties and executive agreements may be subject
to reasonable safeguards for the sake of national interest. The
Court held that while the final text of the JPEPA may not be
left perpetually confidential since there is a need to discuss
the same before it is approved, the offers exchanged by the
parties during the negotiations continue to be privileged, even
after the JPEPA is published. Disclosing these exchanges
could impair the ability of the Philippines to deal not only
with Japan but with other foreign governments in future
negotiations. Reminding the parties of what it had declared in
Chavez v. PCGG, 299 SCRA 744, that while the constitutional
right to information includes official information on ongoing
negotiations before a final contract, such information does
not cover recognized exceptions like privileged information,
military and diplomatic secrets and similar matters affecting

248

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

national interest. The matters falling under these exceptions,
according to the Court, cannot be disclosed even if they
constitute definite propositions. Since diplomatic negotiations
enjoy a presumptive privilege against disclosure, petitioners
need to sufficiently show the existence of a public interest
sufficient to overcome the privilege. The court concluded
with a finding that the petitioners have failed to present a
“sufficient showing of need” in their arguments.
An earlier case, Neri u. Senate Committee on Accountability
of Public Officers and Investigations, 435 SCRA 110, 148,
similarly demonstrates the extent of the right to information
on matters alleged to be of public concern. Romulo Neri, the
petitioner in this case, as then director of the NEDA, was
accordingly said to have discussed with the President of the
Philippines regarding the ZTE-NBN deal. The petitioner,
upon invitation of the respondents (Senate Committee on
Accountability of Public Officers and Investigations, Senate
Committee on Trade and Commerce, and Senate Committee
on National Defense and Security), testified on the ZTE-NBN
contract and the bribe offers in connection with the deal.
When asked on the details of the matters he discussed with
the President after he divulged to the latter the bribe offers,
petitioner declined to disclose the details of their conversation
invoking the privileged nature of the conversation on
specifically the following matters:
(a) Whether the President followed up the NBN
project;
(b) Whether Neri was dictated upon to follow up
the project; and
(c) Whether the President said to go ahead and
approve the project after being told of the alleged bribe.

The Court, in deciding the case, started with the premise
recognizing the power of Congress to conduct inquiries in aid
of legislation, a power which extends even to public officials.
The only way for them to be exempted from the compulsory
process of Congressional subpoena is through a valid claim

—

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
B. Disqualifications of Witnesses

249

of executive privilege. The Court declared it was convinced
that the communications elicited by the three questions are
covered by the presidential communication privilege.
The Neri case emphasized the rule that for the claim
of executive privilege to be invoked, there must be a formal
claim of the privilege, lodged by the head of the department
which has control of the matter, and that a formal and proper
claim of the privilege requires a “precise and certain reason”
for preserving confidentiality, but Congress must not require
the executive to state the reasons for the claim with such
particularity as to compel the disclosure of the information
which the privilege is meant to protect. This is a matter of
respect for a coordinate and co-equal department. It was ruled
that the letter of Secretary Ermita to the respondents satisfies
the requirement.
Privileged communications under the Rules on Electronic
Evidence

Privileged communications apply even to electronic
evidence. Under Sec. 3, Rule 3 of the Rules on Electronic
Evidence, the confidential character of a privileged
communication is not lost solely on the ground that it is in the

Parental and filial privilege (Bar 1998, 2019)
1. Two privileges are embodied in Sec. 25 of Rule
130, namely: (a) the parental privilege rule; and (b) the filial
privilege rule.

Under the parental privilege rule, a parent cannot
be compelled to testify against his child or other direct
descendants. Under the filial privilege rule, a child may not
be compelled to testify against his parents or other direct
ascendants.
2. A person, however, may testify against his parents
or children voluntarily but if he refuses to do so, the rule
protects him from any compulsion. Said rule applies to both

criminal and civil cases since the rule makes no distinction
(Sec. 25, Rule 130, Rules of Court). The rule states:

—

"SEC. 25. Parental and filial privilege.
No
person shall be compelled to testify against his or her
parents, other direct ascendants, children or other
direct descendants, except when such testimony Is
Indispensable in a crime against that person or bv one
parent against the other."

3. In criminal cases, the Family Code of the Philippines
lays down, as a general rule, a policy substantially similar to
Sec. 25, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court. Under the Family
Code, no descendant shall be compelled, in a criminal case,
to testify against his parents and grandparents. The Code,
however, specifically provides for an exception which has
been incorporated under the 2019 Amendments to the Rules
on Evidence. The descendant may be compelled to give his
testimony in the following instances:
(a) when such testimony is indispensable in a crime
committed against said descendant, or
(b) in a crime committed by one parent against the
other (Art. 215, Family Code of the Philippines).

The relevant article provides:
"Art 215. No descendant shall be compelled,
in a criminal case, to testify against his parents
and grandparents, except when such testimony is
Indispensable in a crime, against the descendant or by
one parent against the other.”

Privilege relating to trade secrets

1. Although already considered privileged prior to its
addition in the 2019 Amendments on the Rules on Evidence,
trade secrets are now explicitly mentioned in Sec. 26 of Rule
130, which states:
"SEC, 26, Privilege relating to trade secrets, - A
person cannot be compelled to testify about any trade
secret, unless the non-disclosure will conceal fraud or

251

otherwise work Injustice, When disclosure Is directedthe court shall take such protective .measure as the
interest of the owner of the trade secret and of the
parties and the furtherance of lustice mav require"
2. The privileged nature of trade secrets is evident
from various laws and rules that seek to protect them from
disclosure. Under the Rules of Procedure on Corporate
Rehabilitation (A.M. No. 00-8-10-SC), the court may issue an
order to protect trade secrets, while under the 2020 Revised
Rules of Procedure for Intellectual Property Rights Cases
(A.M. No. 10-3-10-SC), the parties may request for closed
door hearings in cases involving trade secrets. Furthermore,
the Revised Penal Code and National Internal Revenue Code
endow a cloak of protection to trade secrets by punishing the
revelation thereof by certain personnel Similarly, Art. 40(f) of
R.A. No. 7394 or the Consumer Act, prohibits the revelation
of any method or process which as a trade secret is entitled
to protection except when relevant in any judicial proceeding
under said Act. However, the privilege may not be invoked
if the non-disclosure will conceal fraud or otherwise work
injustice.
Other privileged communications not found in the Rules of
Court

1. Sec. 24 of Rule 130 deals with the types of
disqualifications by reason of privileged communication,
to wit: (a) communication between husband and wife; (b)
communication between attorney and client; (c) communication
between physician and patient; (d) communication between
priest and penitent; and (e) public officers and public interest

2. There are, however, other privileged matters that
are not mentioned under Rule 130. Among them are the
following: (a) editors may not be compelled to disclose the
source of published news; (b) voters may not be compelled
to disclose for whom they voted; (c) information contained in
tax census returns; and (d) bank deposits (Air Philippines v.
Pennswell, Inc., 540 SCRA 215).

administer oaths (Sec. 14, Rule 23, Rules of Court).

Under Sec. 6 of R.A. No. 9194, amending Sec.
9 of R.A. No. 9160 (Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2001),
institutions covered by the law and its officers and employees
who communicate a suspicious transaction to the Anti-Money

such report, that such report was made, and other related
information.
4.

5. UnderR-A.No. 10173 or the Data Privacy Actof2012,
personal information controllers may invoke the principle of
privileged communication over privileged information that
they lawfully control or process. Subject to existing laws and
regulations, any evidence gathered on privileged information

is inadmissible.

C. Examination of Witnesses
Open-court examination; exceptions

1. Sec. 1 of Rule 132 provides for the examination of
the witness in open court and, unless the question calls for a
different mode, the answer of the witness shall be given orally.
This method allows the court the opportunity to observe the
demeanor of the witness and also allows the adverse party to
cross-examine the witness.
2. There are, however, testimonies which need not
be given orally in open court. Under the Rule on Summary
Procedure, in criminal cases, the affidavits of the parties shall
constitute the direct testimonies of the witnesses who executed
the same (Sec. 15, Rule on Summary Procedure). In civil cases,
the parties are merely required to submit the affidavits of their
witnesses and other pieces of evidence on the factual issues,
together with their position papers, setting forth the law and
the facts relied upon (Sec. 9, Rule on Summary Procedure).

3. Likewise, depositions need not be taken in open
court. They may be taken before a notary public (Sec. 10,

253

4. In a criminal case, either party may utilize the
testimony of a witness who is deceased, out of the country,
unavailable or unable to testify despite the exercise of due
diligence, even if the testimony was one used in another case
or proceeding, judicial or administrative, provided the said
proceeding involved the same parties and subject matter and
the adverse party had the opportunity to cross-examine the
witness (Sec. Iff], Rule 115, Rules of Court).
5. Under the Judicial Affidavit Rule, the judicial
affidavit shall take the place of direct testimonies of witnesses
(Sec. 2, Judicial Affidavit Rule).
Oath or affirmation

1. The witness must take either an oath or an
affirmation (Sec. 1, Rule 132, Rules of Court) and the option to
do so is given to the witness and not to the court.
2. An oath is an outward pledge made under an
immediate sense of responsibility to God or a solemn appeal
to the Supreme Being in attestation of the truth of some
statement (Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., p. 966). An
affirmation is a substitute for an oath, and is a solemn and
formal declaration that the witness will tell the truth (Ibid.,
55).

3. Where the witness refuses to take an oath or give
any affirmation, the testimony may be barred (U.S. v. Fowler,
605F.2d 181 [5th Cir. 1979]).
Examination of witnesses and record of proceedings (Bar
1978)

1. The examination of witnesses presented in a trial
or hearing shall be done in open court and under oath or
affirmation. The answers of the witness shall be given orally
except if: (a) the witness is incapacitated to speak, or (b) the
question calls for a different mode of answer (Sec. 1, Rule 132,
Rules of Court).

EVIDENCE

254

(The Bar Lectures Series)

The questions propounded to a witness and his
answers thereto shall be recorded. Also to be recorded are
the statements made by the judge, any of the parties or any
of the counsels. In fact, the entire proceedings of the trial or
hearing must be recorded. The recording may be by short¬
hand, stenotype or any means of recording found suitable by
the court (See Sec. 2, ibid.).

3. The official stenographer, stenotypist or recorder
shall make a transcript of the record of the proceedings and
shall be certified by him as correct. The transcript so prepared
and certified shall be deemed prima facie a correct statement
of such proceedings (Sec. 2, ibid.).
Rights and obligations of a witness (Bar 1998, 2004, 2005)

1. As a rule, a witness has an obligation to answer
questions, although his answer may tend to establish a claim
against him (Sec. 3, ibid.).

Of course, there are questions which he is not bound
to answer. This is because a witness has certain rights like:
(a) Not to give an answer which will tend to subject him to
a penalty for an offense; (b) To be protected from irrelevant,
improper, or insulting questions, and from harsh or insulting
demeanor; (c) Not to be examined except only as to matters
pertinent to the issue; (d) Not to be detained longer than the
interest of justice requires; and (e) Not to give an answer
which will tend to degrade his or her reputation, unless it be
the very fact at issue or to a fact from which the fact in issue
would be presumed (Sec. 3, ibid.).
2. Foremost among the rights of a witness is the right
not to give an answer that will subject him to a penalty, unless
otherwise provided by law (Sec. 3(4], ibid.). This provision
in the Rules of Court gives meaning to the right of a person
against self-incrimination (Sec. 17, Art. Ill, 1 987 Constitution).
Note, however, that under R.A. No. 6981 (Witness
Protection, Security and Benefit Act), a witness admitted into
the witness protection program cannot refuse to testify or give

evidence or produce books, documents, records or writings
necessary for the prosecution of the offense or offenses for
which he has been admitted on the ground of the right against
self-incrimination (Sec. 14, R.A. No. 6981).

3. Aside from the right against self-incrimination, a
witness likewise has the right not to give an answer that will
tend to degrade his reputation. However, even if the answer
tends to degrade his reputation, he must answer the question
if the degrading answer: (a) is the very fact in issue; or (b)
refers to a fact from which the fact in issue would be presumed
(Sec. 3[5], Rule 132, Rules of Court).
But a witness must answer to the fact of his previous
final conviction for an offense (Ibid.).
4. If the witness is the accused, he may totally refuse
to take the stand. A mere witness cannot altogether refuse to
take the stand. Before he refuses to answer, he must wait for
the incriminating question (Bagadiong v. Gonzales, 94 SCRA
906).

5. Counsel must always come to the aid of his
witness being subjected to intimidation, harassment and
embarrassment. Such acts are objectionable and a timely
objection should be raised.
Examination of a child witness; live-link television (Bar 2006)
1. The examination of a child witness presented in a
hearing or any proceeding shall be done in open court. The
answer of the witness shall be given orally, unless the witness
is incapacitated to speak, or the question calls for a different
mode of answer (Sec. 8, Rule on Examination of a Child
Witness).

The examination in this provision does not refer to the
competency examination of the child pursuant to Sec. 6 of
the same rule, but to a situation where the child is already
testifying in court. Under Sec. 6(c), only specified persons are
allowed to attend the competency examination of the child
and is obviously not an open court examination.

256

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

When the child is testifying, the court may exclude the
public and persons who do not have a direct interest in the
case, including members of the press. The order shall be made
if the court determines on the record that to testify in open
court would cause psychological harm to him, hinder the
ascertainment of truth, or result in his inability to effectively
communicate due to embarrassment, fear or timidity. The
court may also motu proprio exclude the public from the
courtroom if the evidence to be produced during trial is of
such character as to be offensive to decency or public morals.
The court may also, on motion of the accused, exclude the
public from trial, except court personnel and the counsel of
the parties (Sec. 23, ibid.).

The court may also order that persons attending the trial
shall not enter or leave the courtroom during the testimony of
the child (Sec. 24, ibid.).
2. When a child does not understand the English
or Filipino language or is unable to communicate in said
languages due to his developmental level, fear, shyness,
disability, or other similar reason, an interpreter whom the
child can understand and who can understand the child may
be appointed by the court, motu proprio or upon motion, to
interpret for the child (Sec. 9[a], ibid.). Being another witness
in the same case or a member of the family of the child is
not in itself a disqualification. Such a person may be an
interpreter if he is the only one who can serve as interpreter.
If the interpreter is also a witness, he shall testify ahead of
the child (Sec. 9[b], ibid.).

3. If the court determines that the child is unable to
understand or respond to questions asked, the court may,
motu proprio or upon motion, appoint a facilitator. The
facilitator may be a child psychologist, psychiatrist, social
worker, guidance counselor, teacher, religious leader, parent,
or relative (Sec. 10, ibid.).
4. A child testifying at a judicial proceeding or making
a deposition shall have the right to be accompanied by one
or two persons of his own choosing to provide him emotional
support. Said support persons shall remain within the view of

—

267

the child during his testimony. One of the support persons may
even accompany the child to the witness stand and the court
may also allow the support person to hold the hands of the
child or to take other appropriate steps to provide emotional
support to the child in the course of the proceedings but the
court shall instruct the support persons not to prompt, sway,
or influence the child during his testimony (Sec. 11, ibid.).
The support person may be another witness but the court
shall disqualify him if it could be sufficiently established that
the attendance of such support person would pose a substantial
risk of influencing or affecting the content of the testimony
of the child. If the support person who is also a witness is
allowed by the court, he shall testify ahead of the child (Sec.
ll[b] and [c], ibid.).
5. An application may be made for the testimony of
the child to be taken in a room outside the courtroom and
be televised to the courtroom by live-link television. The
application may be made by the prosecutor, counsel or
guardian ad litem at least five days before the trial date (Sec.
25[a], ibid.).

The court may order that the testimony of the child be
taken by live-link television if there is a substantial likelihood
that the child would suffer trauma from testifying in the
presence of the accused, his counsel or the prosecutor as the
case may be. The trauma should be of a kind which would
impair the completeness or truthfulness of the testimony of
the child (Sec. 25[f], ibid.). (Bar 2006)

If the child is testifying by live-link television and it is
necessary to identify the accused at trial, the court may allow
the child to enter the courtroom for the limited purpose of
identifying the accused, or the court may allow the child to
identify the accused by observing his image on a television
monitor (Sec. 25[g][3], ibid.).
6. The testimony of the child shall be preserved on
videotape, digital disc, or other similar devices which shall be
made part of the court record and be subject to a protective
order (Sec. 25[hJ, ibid.).

EVIDENCE

268

(The Bar Lectures Series)

7. To shield the child from the accused, the court may
allow the child to testify in such a manner that the child
cannot see the accused by testifying through one-way mirrors,
and other devices (Sec. 26, ibid.).
8. Records regarding a child shall be confidential and
kept under seal. Except upon written request and order of the
court, a record shall only be released to the following:
(1) Members of the court staff for administrative
use;
(2) The prosecuting attorney;
(3) Defense counsel;
(4) The guardian ad litem;
(5) Agents of investigating law enforcement
agencies; and
(6) Other persons as determined by the court (Sec.
31(a), ibid.).

9.

Whoever publishes or causes to be published in

any format the name, address, telephone number, school, or
other identifying information of a child who is or is alleged to

be a victim or accused of a crime or a witness thereof, or an
immediate family of the child shall be liable to the contempt
power of the court (Sec. 31(d), ibid.).

10. Where a youthful offender has been charged before
any city, or provincial prosecutor or any municipal judge and
the charges have been dropped, all the records of the case shall
be considered as privileged and may not be disclosed directly
or indirectly to anyone for any purpose whatsoever. If he is
charged and acquitted or the case is dismissed, the records are
also privileged, as a rule (Sec. 31(g), ibid.).

11. The youthful offender, who fails to acknowledge
the case against him or to recite any fact related thereto in
response to any inquiry made to him for any purpose, shall
not be held under any provision of law to be guilty of perjury
or of concealment or misrepresentation (Ibid.).

Kinds of examinations

259

—

1. Direct examination
This is the examination-inchief of a witness by the party presenting him on the facts

relevant to the issue (Sec. 5, Rule 132, Rules of Court). It is
actually a procedure for obtaining information from one’s own
witness in an orderly fashion. It is information which counsel
wants the court to hear. The purpose is to elicit facts about
the client's cause of action or defense. This examination is
now subject to the Judicial Affidavit Rule which took effect
on January 1, 2013. The Rule is discussed at the end of this
chapter.

—

2. Cross-examination This is the examination of the
witness by the adverse party after said witness has given his
testimony on direct examination. As a rule, the scope of the
cross-examination is not confined to the matters stated by the
witness in the direct examination. Thus, under the Rules of
Court, an objection that the question in the cross-examination
is on a matter not touched upon by the witness in his testimony
will seldom be sustained provided the question covers matters
allowed to be asked by way of cross-examination. This is
because the rule allows questions designed to test the accuracy
and truthfulness of the witness, his freedom from interest or
bias, or the reverse, and to elicit all important facts bearing
upon the issue (Sec. 6, ibid.).
Although Sec. 6 of Rule 132 allows the cross-examiner a
wide latitude in asking his questions, this provision merely
states a general rule. Where the witness is an unwilling or a
hostile witness as so declared by the court, he may be crossexamined only as to the subject matter of his examination¬
in-chief (Sec. 12, ibid.). The same limited scope of a crossexamination is imposed upon the cross-examiner where the
witness examined is an accused because he is subject to crossexamination on matters covered by the direct examination
(Sec. 1(d), Rule 115, Rules of Court).

Cross-examination has two basic purposes, namely: (a)
To bring out facts favorable to counsel's client not established
by the direct testimony, and (b) To enable counsel to impeach
or to impair the credibility of the witness.

This examination is
3. Re-direct examination
conducted after the cross-examination of the witness. The
party who called the witness on direct examination may
re-examine the same witness to explain or supplement
his answers given during the cross-examination. It is the
examination of a witness by the counsel who conducted the
direct examination after the cross-examination. In re-direct
examination, the counsel may elicit testimony to correct or
repel any wrong impression or inference that may have
been created in the cross-examination. It may also be an
opportunity to rehabilitate a witness whose credibility has
been damaged. In its discretion, the court may even allow
questions on matters not touched in the cross-examination
(Sec. 7, Rule 132, Rules of Court).
This is the examination
4. Re-cross examination
conducted upon the conclusion of the re-direct examination.
Here, the adverse party may question the witness on matters
stated in his re-direct examination and also on such matters
as may be allowed by the court in its discretion (Sec. 8, ibid.).

Death or absence of a witness

1. If the witness dies before his cross-examination

his testimony on the direct may be stricken out
only with respect to the testimony not covered by the crossexamination. The absence of the witness is not enough to
warrant striking out his testimony for failure to appear for
further cross-examination where the witness has already
been sufficiently cross-examined, and the matter on which the
cross-examination is sought is not in controversy (People v.
Seneris, 99 SCRA 92).
2. If the witness was not cross-examined because
of causes attributable to the cross-examining party and
the witness had always made himself available for crossexamination, the direct testimony of the witness shall remain
in the record and cannot be ordered stricken off because the
cross-examiner is deemed to have waived the right to crossexamine the witness (De la Paz v. Intermediate Appellate
Court, 154 SCRA 65).

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE

261

Recalling a witness

If a witness has been examined by both sides, the witness
cannot be recalled without leave of court. Recalling a witness is
a matter of judicial discretion. In the exercise of its discretion,
the court shall be guided by the interests of justice (Sec. 9,
Rule 132, Rules of Court).
Leading questions

1. A leading question is one that is framed in such a
way that the question indicates to the witness the answer
desired by the party asking the question. In the words of Sec.
10 of Rule 132, it is a question “which suggests to the witness

the answer which the examining party desires.”
2. Leading questions are not appropriate in direct
and re-direct examinations particularly when the witness is
asked to testify about a major element of the cause of action
or defense. Leading questions are allowed in cross and re¬
cross examinations. In fact, leading questions are the types
of questions that should be employed in a cross-examination.
Such questions enable the counsel to get the witness to
agree with his client’s version of the facts. Most lawyers will
agree that a “why” question should not be asked in crossexamination. This kind of question allows a witness to explain
his or her position, emphasize key points of harmful testimony
and control the pace and scope of the examination. It invites
the witness to deliver an unwanted “lecture” in the courtroom.
Short and leading questions will help control the witness.
3. Leading questions are, however, allowed in a direct
examination in the following instances: (a) on preliminary
matters; (b) when the witness is ignorant, or a child of tender
years, or is feebleminded or a deaf-mute and there is difficulty
in getting direct and intelligible answers from such witness;
(c) when the witness is a hostile witness; or (d) when the
witness is an adverse party, or an officer, director, or managing
agent of a corporation, partnership or association which is an
adverse party (Sec. 10, Rule 132, Rules of Court).

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
D. Impeachment of a Witness

Leading questions to a child witness

As to a child witness, Sec. 10, Rule 132 of the Rules of
Court should be deemed modified by Sec. 20 of the Rule on
Examination of a Child Witness. Under the said rule, the
court may allow leading questions in all stages of examination
of a child under the condition that the same will further
the interest of justice. Under the Rules of Court, a leading
question may be asked of a child only if there is difficulty of
eliciting from said child a direct and intelligible answer (Sec.
10[c], ibid..).

Illustrations:
The following examples of leading questions in a
direct examination may be illuminating:

263

Q: What were you doing in the park?

A: I was taking a stroll with my two adolescent
children.
Q: While you were in the park with your children,
the police officers arrived to arrest you, is that

true?
The question is leading. It suggests the next event
which the witness should testify to. The attorney could
convert the question into a non-leading one by taking
the suggestive element out of the question. Thus, “What
happened, if any, while you and your children were in the
park?’
Misleading questions

Illustration No. 1:
The case is a collection case. The defendant contends
that the debt has been paid. He calls a witness to testify
to the fact of payment.
Q: While the plaintiff and the defendant were
engaged in a conversation on the date and
time you mentioned, did you see the defendant
deliver P50,000.00 to the plaintiff?
The question is objectionable on the ground that it is
leading. Here, the examiner obviously wants the witness
to directly testify that money was delivered by the
defendant to the plaintiff in his presence. The question
could have been properly framed in this manner: “What
have you observed, if any, while the plaintiff and the
defendant were engaged in a conversation?’

Counsel: “You testified that you and the accused were in
a car bound for Baguio City. How fast were you driving?”

Illustration No. 2:
The fact situation is a robbery case. The accused
claims innocence and that a couple of hours after the
alleged robbery, he is arrested by the police while in the
park with his children. The defense counsel calls the
accused to the stand.

truth.

1. A misleading question is one which assumes as true
a fact not yet testified to by the witness, or contrary to that
which he has previously stated. It is not allowed in any type of
examination (Sec. 10, Rule 132, Rules of Court).
2.

Consider this illustration:

This question is objectionable as misleading where
there was no previous testimony from the witness that he
was driving the car. The question assumes a fact not yet in
evidence.
D. Impeachment of a Witness
1. Impeachment is a technique employed usually
as part of the cross-examination to discredit a witness by
attacking his credibility. Destroying credibility is vital because
it is linked with a witness’ ability and willingness to tell the

2. The rules enumerate certain guideposts in
impeaching a witness:

264

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

(a) The impeachment of a witness is to be done by
the party against whom the witness is called (Sec. 11,
Rule 132, Rules of Court).
(b) Subject to certain exceptions, the party
producing the witness is barred from impeaching his own
witness (Sec. 13, ibid.). Thus, if D calls W as his witness,
D is not allowed to impeach the credibility of W. It is the
adverse party, P, against whom W was called, who is
accorded the privilege of impeaching W.

(c) By way of exception to the immediately
preceding rule, if the witness is unwilling or hostile, the
party calling him may be allowed by the court to impeach
the witness. But it is not for the party calling the witness
to make a determination that the witness is unwilling or
hostile. Whether or not a witness is hostile is addressed
to judicial evaluation and the declaration shall be made
only if the court is satisfied that the witness possesses
an interest adverse to the party calling him or there is
adequate showing that the reluctance of the witness is
unjustified, or that he misled the party into calling him
as a witness (Sec. 13, ibid.).

A party may also be allowed to impeach his own
witness when said witness is an adverse party or is an
officer, director, or managing agent of a corporation,
partnership or association which is an adverse party
(Sec. 13, ibid.).
(d) Evidence of conviction by final judgment
of a crime shall also be admitted for the purpose of
impeaching a witness if (a) the crime was punishable
by a penalty in excess of one (1) year, or (b) the crime
involved moral turpitude, regardless of the penalty. Such
evidence, however, is not admissible if the same has been
the subject of an amnesty or annulment of the conviction
(Sec. 12, ibid.).

(e) It is also improper for the party calling the
witness to present evidence of the good character of his
own witness. The same is allowed only if the character
of the witness has been impeached (Sec. 54, Rule 130,
I

CHAPTER V

— TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE

265

D. Impeachment of a Witness

Rules of Court). Thus, evidence of the good character
of the witness is allowed only to rebut the evidence
offered to impeach the witness’ character. If he has been
impeached, then he can be rehabilitated by evidence of
his good character.
How to impeach a witness (Bar 2018)

1. Section 11 of Rule 132 specifies the manner of
impeaching the witness of the adverse party. It declares:
“SEC. 11. Impeachment of adverse party’s witness.

— K witness may be Impeached by the party against

whom he or she was called, by contradictory evidence,
by evidence that his or her general reputation for truth,
honesty, or integrity is bad, or by evidence that he or
she has made at other times statements inconsistent
with his or her present testimony, but not by evidence
of particular wrongful acts, except that it may be shown
by the examination of the witness, or the record of
the judgment, that he or she has been convicted of an
offense.”

2. Under the above rule, a witness may be impeached
through the following modes:
(a) By contradictory evidence;

(b) By evidence that his or her general reputation
for truth, honesty or integrity is bad; or
(c) By evidence that he or she has made at other
times statements inconsistent with his or her present
testimony (Sec. 11, Rule 132, Rules of Court).

3. A witness cannot be impeached by evidence of •
particular wrongful acts except evidence of his or her conviction
of an offense as disclosed by his examination or the record of
the judgment (Sec. 11, ibid.).
4. An unwilling or hostile witness so declared by
the court or the witness who is an adverse party cannot be
impeached by evidence of his or her bad character (Sec. 12,
ibid.).

CHAPTER V

Impeachment by contradictory evidence

Every ethical trial lawyer will tell us that one basic
rule in impeaching a witness by contradictory evidence
is the observance of fairness. Fairness demands that the
impeaching matter be raised in the cross-examination of the
witness sought to be impeached by allowing him to admit or
deny a matter to be used as the basis for impeachment by
contradictory evidence.
Normally, the basis of this mode of impeachment is a
declaration made by the witness in his direct testimony. The
cross-examiner’s intention is to show to the court that there
were allegations made by the witness that do not correspond
to the real facts of the case.
This mode of impeachment may also be used to contradict
conclusions made by expert witnesses during their testimonies.
Usually, the adverse party may also call another expert to
testify to a contrary conclusion.

Illustration:
Witness A testifies on direct examination that he
was barely five meters away from where the accused,
D, shot the victim, V. The defense counsel has reliable
information that, at the time the shooting took place,
Witness A was standing as a witness in a wedding of his
friend, Witness B, in a place a hundred miles away. The
defense counsel now asks:
Q: You testified that you were present when D
shot V, is that right?

A: Perfectly right, Sir!
Q: Isn’t it true that, at the time of the alleged
shooting of V by D, you were in a wedding of
your friend miles and miles away?
A: That isn’t true. Sir. Absolutely not.

Because Witness A denied his being in a friend’s wedding
at the time of the incident, the defense counsel now has the

—

D. Impeachment of a Witness

267

chance to prove the contrary by a contradictory evidence. He
can do so by calling Witness B or any other witness to testify
on the whereabouts of Witness A on the relevant date and
time.
Impeachment by evidence of conviction of crime
1. Sec. 12, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court is a new
provision which lays down the requisites for impeachment by
evidence of conviction of a crime. It states:
"SEC. 12. Impeachment by evidence of conviction
of crime. - For the purpose of impeaching a witness,
evidence that he or she has been convicted by final
judgment of a crime shall be admitted if (a) the crime
was punishable by a penalty In excess of one (1) year;
or (b) the crime involved moral turpitude, regardless of
the penalty.

However, evidence of a conviction is not
admissible if the conviction has been the subject of an
amnesty or annulment of the conviction."

2. The previous rule did not qualify the nature of the
crime for which the witness was convicted. Under the new rule,
if the crime for which a witness was convicted involved moral
turpitude, the length of the penalty is immaterial for purposes
of impeaching him or her. Otherwise, the penalty should be
greater than one year. The reason is that while conviction of a
light or minor offense may also be used to impeach a witness,
the same would have little “impeachment value,” as noted by
the Rules Committee.
3. The proviso in the second paragraph excludes
evidence of a conviction which has been the subject of an
amnesty or annulment of said conviction. Pardon was not
included because even an absolute pardon does not expunge a
record of conviction.
Impeachment by prior inconsistent statements

1. Prior inconsistent statements are statements made
by a witness on an earlier occasion which contradict the

268

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

statements he later made during the trial. In the words of
Sec. 14 of Rule 132, they are “that he or she has made at other
times statements inconsistent with his present testimony."
These inconsistent statements are admissible to impeach
the credibility of the witness making them. Impeachment by
a prior inconsistent statement is the most commonly used
method because of its simplicity and the impact it makes
when properly used. The relevant rule provides:
“SEC. 14- How witness Impeached by evidence
— Before a witness can be
impeached by evidence that he or she has made at other
times statements inconsistent with his or her present
testimony, the statements must be related to him or her,
with the circumstances of the times and places and the
persons present, and he or she must be asked whether
he or she made such statements, and If so, allowed to
explain them. If the statements be in writing, they must
be shown to the witness before any question is put to
him or her concerning them."
of Inconsistent statements.

2. Effectively impeaching a witness by prior incon¬
sistent statements requires laying the proper foundation for
the impeachment. Laying the foundation, commonly referred
to as "laying the predicate,” is a preliminary requirement be¬
fore the impeachment process prospers. The elements of this
foundation are clearly spelled out in Sec. 14 of Rule 132. These
are:
(a) The alleged statements must be related to the
witness including the circumstances of the times and
places and the persons present. If the statements are in
writing, they must be shown to him; and
(b) He must be asked whether he made such
statements and also to explain them if he admits making
those statements.
3. The mere presentation of the prior declarations of
the witness without the same having been read to him while
testifying in court is insufficient for the desired impeachment

—

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
D. Impeachment of a Witness

269

of his testimony, if he was not given the ample opportunity
to explain the supposed discrepancy. This rule is founded,
not only upon common sense, but is essential to protect the
character of the witness (People v. De Guzman, 288 SCRA
346, 354).

To achieve a dramatic effect, the first step in setting
prior
inconsistent statement would actually be to ask
up the

to
witness
the
The second step would be to relate to the witness his prior
inconsistent statement and, at the same time, "building up”
or highlighting the contradictory utterance by relating to the
witness the circumstances of times, persons and places. Then,
the witness is asked whether or not the statements were made
(See Sec. 14, Rule 132, Rules of Court).
4.

The underlying purpose for laying the predicate is to allow
the witness to admit or deny the prior statement and afford
him an opportunity to explain the same. Non-compliance
with the foundational elements for this mode of impeachment
will be a ground for an objection based on "improper
impeachment.” Over a timely objection, extrinsic evidence of a
prior inconsistent statement without the required foundation
is not admissible.

Illustration No. 1:
The case is a robbery case. The accused has oriental
features and is five feet and three inches tall. The
prosecution witness is one who allegedly saw the culprit
come out of the crime scene.
Q: Mr. A, you testified on direct examination that
the man you saw come out of the burglarized
store had oriental features and was a little over
five feet tall. Is that correct?

A: Yes, Sir.
Q; Are you certain of your description of the man?
A' Very certain, Sir.
Q: And when was this?

EVIDENCE

270

(The Bar Lectures Series)

A- On February 15, 2015, around 9:30 in the
evening. That was the date and time of the
burglary.

Q: Do you recall having seen SPO4 Morales
outside the burglarized store at around 10:00 of
the same day and night?
A I do, Sir. He spoke to me that night and asked
me what I saw.
Q: And that was only thirty minutes from the time
you saw the man. Is that correct?
A- That is correct, Sir.

Q: And at that time, everything was still fresh in
your mind. Right?

A You’re absolutely right, Sir.

Q: Do you recall telling SPO4 Morales that you
cannot give an accurate description of the man
who came out of the burglarized store because
he was wearing a bonnet over his face, had a
pair of gloves on and was wearing dark long
sleeves?

At this point, the witness gets boxed in, and his credibility
starts crumbling no matter how he responds to the question
asking him to affirm or deny the prior inconsistent statement.
If the witness admits the prior inconsistent statement, the
rule requires that he be allowed to explain them. Often, it is
difficult to explain inconsistent statements and would require
a lot of effort. If the witness denies making the statement,
it is imperative for the impeaching party to be prepared to
present another witness who would contradict the witness
being impeached.

It happens sometimes that the prior inconsistent
statement is in writing. The process of laying the predicate is
fundamentally the same as when the prior statement is oral,
but if the statement be in writing, it must be shown to the

witness before any question is put to him concerning it (Sec.
14, Rule 132, Rules of Court).

Illustration No. 2:
The case is one for murder. The witness was
interviewed by the police ten minutes after the incident.
In her signed statement, she claimed that she did not
actually see the accused fire the shot that killed the
victim, but in her direct examination, she testified that
she saw him fire once at the victim.
Q: Did you earlier testify that you saw the accused
fire at the victim?
A" I did, sir.

Q: Are you certain of that?
A Yes, Sir.
Q: Do you recall having made a statement to the
police ten minutes after the incident?
A Yes, Sir. I made it before Detective Rosales.
Q: Your statement was reduced to writing, is that
right?

A Right, Sir.

Q: After your statement was typed, it was shown
to you, right?
A Yes, sir.
Q: He asked you to read the statement very
carefully before you signed it. Am I correct?
A- Yes, sir.
Q: After making sure that the contents of the
written statement were correct, you signed the
statement. Is that correct?
A That is correct, Sir.

Q: I am showing you a three-page statement
entitled “Sinumpaang Salaysay.” Is this the
statement you signed before Detective Rosales?

A* It is, sir.
Q: At the end of the last page is a name and
signature over the name. Is that your name and
signature?

A* They are, Sir.

Counsel will now ask that the statement be marked
as an exhibit including the name and signature of wit¬
ness. Then counsel will call the attention of the witness
to the relevant paragraph of her signed statement. The
reading of the prior inconsistent statement must be ver¬
batim, not a mere summary, as: “In paragraph 13 of this
Sinumpaang Salaysay, you stated, and I quote...”
Impeachment by showing bad reputation

1. When a witness testifies, he puts his credibility at
issue because the weight of his testimony depends upon his
credibility. One way to impair his credibility is by showing a
not so pleasing reputation. Hence, the prevailing rule allows
his impeachment by evidence that he has a bad general
reputation.

2. Not every aspect of a person’s reputation may be the
subject of impeachment. Evidence of bad reputation for the
purpose of impeachment should refer only to the following
specific aspects: (a) for truth; (b) for honesty; or (c) for
integrity (Sec. 11, Rule 132, Rules of Court). These are aspects
of a person’s reputation that are relevant to his credibility.
He cannot be impeached for his reputation on other grounds.
Thus, it would be improper for a witness to be impeached
because of his reputation for being troublesome and abrasive.
Example: Mr. W is called by the prosecution to testify
that it was indeed the accused who picked the pocket of the
victim when the latter accidentally tripped by the sidewalk.

—

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
D. Impeachment of a Witness

273

The defense later presents Mr. D, a neighbor of Mr. W for
thirty (30) years, who testifies that Mr. W has a reputation
in the community for telling lies. The testimony of Mr. D is
an impeaching testimony to discredit Mr. W. Mr. D, who has
testified on the reputation of Mr. W, may be cross-examined
like any witness. He may be asked on cross-examination about
the extent of his familiarity with the witness who is being
impeached, together with any prejudice and biases he may
have against the witness or his stake and interest in the case.
No Impeachment by evidence of bad character but by bad
reputation

1. It should be noted that Sec. 11 does not allow
impeachment by evidence of bad character but by bad
reputation.
2. “Character” is made up of the things an individual
actually is and does, whereas “reputation” is what people
think an individual is and what they say about him (McNaulty
v. State, 138 Tex.Cr.R. 317. 135 S.W.2d 987, 989; James v.
State ex rel. Loser, 24 Tenn. App. 453, 145 S.W.2d 1026, 1033
cited in Black's Law Dictionary, p. 1172). Hence, a person’s
reputation is not necessarily his character and vice versa.
Evidence of good character of the witness

1. Be it noted, too, that the party calling a witness
cannot initiate proof of his good character. Thus, if the plaintiff
in a civil case presents Mr. W to testify on a vehicular collision,
the counsel is not allowed to ask questions tending to show
the good character or reputation of the witness. Any question
to that effect can be validly objected to as "improper character
evidence." Because a witness is presumed to be truthful and
of good character, the party presenting him does not have
to prove he is good because he is presumed to be one. It is
only after his character has been attacked can he prove his
being good. He must first be discredited before his reputation
or character can be bolstered. This basic procedural rule is
supported by Sec. 54 of Rule 130 (formerly Sec. 14 of Rule
132):

—

“SEC. 54- Character evidence not generally

particular occasion, except:

xxx."

2. The rule that bars evidence of the good character of
the witness, who has not yet been impeached, has reference
only to a mere witness. It does not refer to an accused in a
criminal case. In a criminal case, the accused may prove his
good moral character relevant to the offense charged even
before his character is attacked (Sec. 54[a][l], Rule 130, Rules
of Court). However, the prosecution cannot initiate proof of
the bad character of the accused. It can only do so by way of
rebuttal (Sec. 54[a][2], ibid.). This means that the prosecution
can prove the bad character of the accused only if the latter
had first presented evidence of his good character.

275

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
D. Impeachment of a Witness

(The Bar Lectures Series)

Q: Was that incident the first time you came to
know the prosecution witness?

A: No Sir.
Q: Why do you say so?
A: Prior to my being robbed by him, he stole the
carabao of my neighbor.

Is this line of questioning objectionable? Certainly, it
is. A witness cannot be impeached by evidence of particular
wrongful acts (Sec. 11, Rule 132, Rules of Court).
He can, nevertheless, be impeached as to his bad
reputation for truth, honesty or integrity. Thus:
Q:

How long have you known the prosecution
witness?

A: Since childhood, Sir.
Q: How well do you know him?

A- Very well, Sir.
Q: Why do you say so?

A

We studied in the same school since nursery
school until we both graduated from college. We
were also neighbors since childhood.

No impeachment by evidence of particular wrongful acts

Q: What can you say about his reputation?

1. Consider this example: The case is a criminal
prosecution for robbery. The defense is presenting its evidence¬
in-chief and calls its first witness to impeach the primary
witness of the prosecution. The defense counsel asks a series
of questions to show specific instances of misconduct of the
prosecution witness.

A

Q:
A‘
Q:
A:

Do you know the prosecution witness?
I do, Sir.
How did you come to know him?
Two years ago, he robbed me of my wallet at
gunpoint.

Terrible, Sir. He is reputed to be dishonest and

untruthful.
This line of questioning does not violate the rules on
impeachment. This is not an impeachment by evidence of
specific wrongful conduct which is barred, but an impeachment
by evidence of bad reputation.
2. As earlier mentioned, Sec. 11 of Rule 132 disallows
the impeachment of a witness by evidence of his particular
wrongful acts.
There is, however, a particular wrongful act that is
his prior

conviction of an offense. This prior conviction of the witness is
shown through either of two ways: (a) by his examination, i.e.,
by cross-examining him, or (b) by presenting the record of his
prior conviction.

Examining another witness to elicit from his lips
the prior conviction of another witness is not the correct
procedure, unless the witness is one who is competent (like
an official custodian of records) to present in court the record
of conviction. The rule is clear on this. It should be by “the
examination of the witness.” This witness is obviously the one
whose prior conviction is the subject of inquiry.

Exclusion and separation of witnesses
1. The judge, motu proprio or upon motion, shall
exclude witnesses who, at the time of exclusion, are not under
examination so that they may not hear the testimony of
other witnesses (Sec. 15, Rule 132, Rules of Court). However,
under the 2019 Amendments, the following are exempt from
exclusion:
(a) a party who is a natural person;
(b) a duly designated representative of a juridical
entity which is a party to the case;
(c) a person whose presence is essential to the
presentation of the party’s cause;
(d) a person authorized by a statute to be present.

As explained by the Rules Committee, the first category
is in line with the rule that the power of exclusion applies only
to witnesses and not to the parties in a civil case (Muerteguy &
Aboitiz v. Delgado, 22 Phil. 109; Paez v. Berenger, 8 Phil. 457).
The accused is likewise exempt from exclusion because he has
the right to be present and defend himself or herself in person
and by counsel at every stage of the proceedings. The second
category is designed to extend parity of treatment to parties
that are not natural persons. Under the third category, the
judge is given the discretion to determine whose presence
would be considered essential to the presentation of a party’s
cause.

CHAPTER V- TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
277

2. The judge may cause the witnesses to be kept
separate and be prevented from conversing with one another,
whether directly or through intermediaries, until all shall
have been examined (Sec. 15, Rule 132, Rules of Court). Note
that while exclusion under the first paragraph is mandatory,
the separation of witnesses under the second paragraph is
merely discretionary.

When the witness may refer to a memorandum
1. During his testimony, in order to refresh his memory,
a witness may refer to a memorandum or to anything written
or recorded by himself, or written or recorded by someone
acting under his direction. Such memorandum should be
written at the time the fact occurred or immediately thereafter
or at any time when the event or fact was fresh in his memory.
It is necessary too that the witness affirm that the fact was
correctly written or recorded. Also, the memorandum must be
produced and may be inspected by the adverse party (Sec. 16,
ibid.).
2. The witness may testify from the memorandum,
writing or record, although he has no more recollection
of the facts written therein as long as he swears that the
memorandum, writing or record correctly stated the fact
or transaction when the recording was made. This type of
evidence must, however, be received with caution (Ibid.).

Concept of admissions and confessions

1. An admission is an act, declaration or omission of a
party as to a relevant fact (Sec. 27, Rule 130, Rules of Court).
It is a voluntary acknowledgment made by a party of the
existence of the truth of certain facts which are inconsistent
with his claims in an action (Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed.,
p. 44).

In a confession, there is an acknowledgment of guilt; in
an admission, there is merely a statement of fact not directly
involving an acknowledgment of guilt or the criminal intent
to commit the offense with which one is charged (Ladiana v.
People, 393SCRA419).

280

—

EVIDENCE

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
281
E. Admissions, Confessions and the Res Inter Alios Acta Rule (Rule 130)

(The Bar Lectures Series)

2. A confession is the declaration of an accused
acknowledging his guilt of the offense charged, or of any
offense necessarily included therein (Sec. 33, Rule 130, Rules
of Court; Tracy’s Handbook, 62 Ed., 242). It is a statement
by the accused that he engaged in conduct which constitutes
a crime (29A Am Jur 2d, Evidence, §708). Hence, when a
person declares in his counter-affidavit that he performed an
act like shooting the victim but denies that he did so with
criminal intent because the shooting was done in self-defense,
the declaration is merely an admission and not a confession
(Ladiana u. People, 393 SCRA 419).
3. An admission, in a general sense, includes
confessions, the former being a broader term because,
accordingly, a confession is also an “admission by the accused
of the fact charged against him or of some fact essential to
the charge” (4 Wigmore, Sec. 1050). A confession is a specific
type of admission which refers only to an acknowledgment of
guilt. As used, the term admission refers to acknowledgment
of facts which, although may be incriminating, falls short of
an admission of guilt.

...

4. An admission may be implied like an admission
by silence. A confession cannot be implied. It should be a
direct and positive acknowledgment of guilt because Sec. 34
of Rule 130 describes a confession as a “declaration” unlike
an admission which is described not only as a “declaration"
but also as an “act” or “omission” (Sec. 27, Rule 130, Rules of
Court).
Effects of admissions

Under Sec. 27, Rule 130, the act, declaration or omission
of a party as to a relevant fact may be given in evidence
against him or her. This rule is based on the notion that no
man would make any declaration against himself, unless it is
true (Republic v. Bautista, 532 SCRA 598, 606).
Classification of admissions and confessions

1. An admission may be express or implied. An express
admission is a positive statement or act. An implied admission

is one which may be inferred from the declarations or acts of a
person.

A confession cannot be implied. It must be a positive
acknowledgment of guilt and cannot be inferred. Section 34
of Rule 130 refers to a confession as a “declaration" which
connotes an affirmative statement from the person making
the confession.
2. An admission may be judicial or extrajudicial. An
admission is judicial when made in the course of a judicial
proceeding. An admission is extrajudicial when made out
of court or even in a proceeding other than the one under
consideration (Perry v. Simpson, Conn. 313). A confession
may be also judicial or extrajudicial for the same reasons (29A
Am Jur 2d, §711).
3. An admission may also be adoptive. This admission
occurs when a person manifests his assent to the statements
of another person. The admission may be received in evidence
if it can be shown that a party adopted the statements as his
own (Fed. Evid. R. 801fd][2][B]; Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th
Ed., p. 44).

A party may, by his words or conduct, voluntarily
adopt or ratify another’s statement. Where it appears that
a party clearly and unambiguously assented to or adopted
the statements of another, evidence of those statements is
admissible against him. This is the essence of the principle of
adoptive admission.

An adoptive admission is a party’s reaction to a statement
or action by another person when it is reasonable to treat the
party’s reaction as an admission of something stated or implied
by the other person. By adoptive admission, a third person’s
statement becomes the admission of the party embracing or
espousing it. Adoptive admission may occur when a party:
(a) expressly agrees to or concurs in an oral

statement made by another;

EVIDENCE

(b) hears a statement and later on

repeats it;

(c) utters an acceptance or builds upon

(d) replies by way of rebuttal to some specific pointraised by another but ignores further points which he
Or
she has heard the other make; or
(e) reads and subsequently signs a
written
statement made by another (Republic v. Kenrick
Development Corp., 498 SCRA 220, 231).
Examples of adoptive admissions are the alleged
admissions made by President Estrada when his options
dwindled when, according to the Angara Diary, the
Armed
Forces withdrew its support from him as President
and
Commander-in-Chief. Thus, Executive Secretary Angara had
to allegedly ask Senate President Pimentel to advise petitioner
to consider the option of “dignified exit or resignation."
President Estrada did not object to the suggested option but
simply said he could never leave the country. According to the
Court, his silence on this and other related suggestions can be
taken as adoptive admissions by him (Estrada u. Desierto 356
SCRA 108).

Besides, he had several opportunities, according to the
Court, to object to the admissibility of the diary, but did not
do so seasonably. It is too late in the day to raise his objections
in an omnibus motion. The Angara Diary also contains direct
statements of the President which could be categorized as
admissions of a party like; (a) his proposal for a snap election
in which he would not participate; (b) his statement that he
would leave by Monday if the second envelope would be opened
y Monday, and (c) statements
like: ‘Pagod napagod na ako.

go.
(Estrada v. Desierto,

To rebut the argument that the diary of Angara is not the
diary of the former president and, thus could not be admissible

against him, the Court declared:
"... The argument overlooks the doctrine of adoptive
admission. An adoptive admission is a party’s reaction
to a statement or action by another person when it is
reasonable to treat the party’s reaction as an admission of
something stated or implied by the other person” (Estrada
u. Desierto, ibid.).

Effect of extrajudicial confession of guilt
1. While a judicial confession may sustain a conviction,
an extrajudicial confession is not sufficient for conviction. The
rule requires that the confession be corroborated by evidence
of corpus delicti (Sec. 3, Rule 133, Rules of Court).
2. Corpus delicti is the “body of the crime” or the
offense (People v. Strook, 347 RI. 460, 170 N.E. 821). Strictly
speaking, it means the actual commission of the crime and
someone criminally responsible therefor (People v. Stoll,
84 Cal App. 99, 257 Pac. 583 cited by Underhill, Criminal
Evidence, §34). It is the substance of the crime; the fact that a
crime has actually been committed (Zabala v. People, G.R. No.
210760, January 26, 2015; People v. Calates, G.R. No. 214759,
April 4, 2018; See discussion in Chapter 1).
3. The rule on extrajudicial confession in the Rules
of Court must be considered together with applicable
constitutional and substantive laws which must be complied
with for the confession to be admissible. For instance, Sec.
2(d) of R.A. No. 7438 (Act Defining Certain Rights of Persons,
Arrested, Detained or Under Custodial Investigation) provides:
“Any extrajudicial confession made by a person
arrested, detained, or under custodial investigation shall
be in writing and signed by such person in the presence
of his counsel or in the latter’s absence, upon a valid
waiver, and in the presence of any of the parents, older
brothers and sisters, his spouse, the municipal mayor, the
municipal judge, district school supervisor, or priest or

284

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

minister of the gospel as chosen by him; otherwise, such
extrajudicial confession shall be inadmissible as evidence
in any proceeding.” (Bar 2006, 2008)

4. The above rights refer to an extrajudicial confession
of a person arrested, detained or is under custodial investiga¬
tion because a confession made by the accused before he is
placed under custodial investigation need not comply with the
above.

If the accused talks to a person in a private meeting
with, for instance, a municipal mayor spontaneously, fully
and voluntarily confessing to his commission of a crime, the
constitutional requirements in a custodial investigation do not
apply. When the accused talked to the mayor as a confidant and
not as a law enforcement officer, the uncounseled confession
did not violate his constitutional rights. Constitutional
procedures on custodial investigation do not apply to
spontaneous statements, not elicited through questioning by
authorities, but given in an ordinary manner whereby the
accused orally admitted having committed the crime. Hence,
such confession is admissible in evidence against him, even
when he did so without the assistance of counsel (People v.
Cabiles, 284 SCRA 199).
5. Custodial investigation has been described as one
which involves any questioning initiated by law enforcement
officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise
deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way. It is
only after the investigation ceases to be a general inquiry into
an unsolved crime and begins to focus on a particular suspect,
the suspect is taken into custody, and the police carries
out a process of interrogations that lend itself to eliciting
incriminating statements, that the rule begins to operate
(Aquino u. Paiste, 555 SCRA 255).

Note that R.A. No. 7438 (Sec. 2[f]) has extended the
meaning of ‘custodial investigation’ to include the practice
of issuing an invitation to a person who is investigated in
connection with an offense he is suspected to have committed.

CHAPTER V— TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
286
E. Admissions, Confessions and the Res Inter Alios Acta Rule (Rule 130)

6. Voluntary admissions made by the accused such as
his possession of a firearm used in the commission of a crime
and the subsequent surrender of the firearm at a time when he
was already under custodial investigation are not admissible
against the accused. At the time the admissions were made,
the police had already begun to focus on the accused and were
carrying out the process of interrogations that was lending
itself to eliciting incriminating statements and evidence. The
investigation was, thus, no longer a general inquiry into an
unsolved crime as the accused was already being held as a
suspect for the alleged killing of the victims. Consequently,
the rights of a person under custodial investigation, including
the right to counsel, have already attached in his favor. Any
waiver of these rights should be in writing and undertaken
with the assistance of counsel. Admissions under custodial
investigation without the assistance of counsel are barred as
evidence. The records do not disclose any indication that the
accused had waived his right to counsel; hence, his admissions
are inadmissible against him. A suspect’s confession, whether
verbal or non-verbal, when taken without the assistance of
counsel or without a valid waiver of such assistance regardless
of the absence of such coercion, or the fact that it had been
voluntarily given, is inadmissible in evidence, even if such
confession were gospel truth (People v. Adar, 432 SCRA 1).
Admission by silence

1. Admission by silence, as expressed in Sec. 33, Rule
130 of the Rules of Court, provides:
“SEC. 33. Admission by silence. — An act or
declaration made in the presence and within the hearing
or observation of a party who does or says nothing
when the act or declaration Is such as naturally to call
for action or comment if not true, and when proper
and possible for him or her to do so, may be given in
evidence against him or her-’’

2. Admission by silence has been traditionally
received, even in common law, as admissible evidence. The
usual pattern for its admissibility involves a statement by a

286

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

person in the presence of a party to the action, criminal or
civil. The statement contains assertions against the party
which, if untrue, would be sufficient cause for the party to
make a denial. His failure to speak against the statement is
admissible as an admission.
Suppose, upon seeing a policeman, a bystander, in the
presence of other people, points to a man and accuses him
as the killer of another man found dead the night before.
The man pointed to does not respond. He does not deny the
accusation. His failure to respond may be given in evidence
against him. The idea of the rule on admission by silence is
that if an accusation is made, and a reasonable person would
have denied the same if it were false, the failure to deny the
accusation by the person accused may be construed as an
implied admission of the truth of the accusation and may be
given in evidence against him.

3. Not every silence is an implied admission. For
instance, the silence of a person under investigation for
the commission of an offense should not be construed as an
admission by silence because of constitutional reasons (Sec.
2fb], RA. No. 7438).
4. For silence to be deemed an admission, it is necessary
that: (a) he heard and understood the statement; (b) he was
at liberty to make a denial; (c) the statement was about a
matter affecting his rights or in which he was interested and
which naturally calls for a response; (d) the facts were within
his knowledge; and (e) the fact admitted from his silence is
material to the issue (People v. Paragsa, 84 SCRA 105).
Thus, in one case, despite the many opportunities given
to the respondent, he refused to comment and present his
side. The gravity of the charges and weight of the evidence
against him would have prompted an innocent man to come
out and clear his name. However, he opted to maintain his
silence. His silence can easily be interpreted as an admission
of guilt (Ortiz v. De Guzman, 451 SCRA 393; Office of the Court
Administrator v. Bernardino, 450 SCRA 88).

CHAPTER V— TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
287
E. Admissions, Confessions end the Res Inter Alios Acta Rule (Rule 130)

5. In a case, a lawyer, an in-house counsel and corporate
secretary, was administratively charged with misappropriating
millions of corporate funds. However, despite the severity of
the charges against him and the opportunities granted him to
comment on the charges, he refused to do so.
The Court, thus, declared:
“x x x The natural instinct of man impels him to
resist an unfounded claim or imputation and defend
himself. It is totally against our human nature to just
remain reticent and say nothing in the face of false
accusations. Silence in such cases is almost always
construed as implied admission of the truth thereof x x x"
(HDI Holdings Philippines, Inc. v. Cruz, AC. No. 11724,
July 31, 2018).
Res inter alios acta; branches (Bar 2019)
1. The expression if fully expressed reads: res inter
alios acta alteri nocere non debet which literally means that
“things done between strangers ought not to injure those who
are not parties to them” (Black 's Law Dictionary, 5th Ed.,
p. 1178; Dynamic Signmaker Outdoor Advertising Services,
Inc. v. Potongan, 461 SCRA 328).
2. The res inter alios acta rule has two branches,

namely:

(a) The rule that the rights of a party cannot be
prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of another
(Sec. 29, Rule 130, Rules of Court).
(b) The rule that evidence of previous conduct
or similar acts at one time is not admissible to prove
that one did or did not do the same act at another time
(Sec. 35, Rule 132, ibid.).

3.
read:

The provisions on res inter alios acta under Rule 130

—

"SEC. 22- Admission by third party. The rights
of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration or
omission of another, except as hereinafter provided.”

288

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

“SEC. 35. Similar acts as evidence. — Evidence
that one did or did not do a certain thing at one time
is not admissible to prove that he or she did or did not
do the same or a similar thing at another time; but it
may be received to prove a specific intent or knowledge,
identity, plan, system, scheme, habit, custom or usage,
and the like."

4. The first branch is a very simple and logical rule
which holds that whatever one says or does or omits to do
should only affect him but should not affect or prejudice
others. In other words, both common reason and fairness
demand that a man’s actions and declarations should affect
him alone and should not affect others.
Thus, if X makes a statement before the media admitting
his participation in a previous murder, his statement is
admissible against him under Sec. 27 of Rule 130. The rest
of his statement pointing to Y and Z as co-participants in
the murder are not admissible against Y and Z under the
first branch of the res inter alios acta rule in Sec. 29 of Rule
130. Under this rule, the statement of X should not affect or
prejudice Y and Z upon their timely objections.
5. The above rule has reference only to extrajudicial
declarations. Hence, statements made in open court by a
witness implicating persons, aside from his own judicial
admissions, are admissible as declarations from one who has
personal knowledge of the facts testified to.
Thus, the Court, in one case, instructed that “When
several accused are tried together, the confession made by one

—

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE

examine him. A judicial confession is admissible against the
declarant’s co-accused since the latter are afforded opportunity
to cross-examine the former. Section 30 [now Sec. 31] of Rule
130 of the Rules of Court applies only to extrajudicial acta
or admissions and not to testimony at trial where the party
adversely affected has the opportunity to cross-examine the
declarant" (People u. Janjalani, G.R. No. 188314, January 10,
2011).
2. An extrajudicial confession or admission of one
accused is admissible only against said accused, but is
inadmissible against the other accused. But if the declarant
or admitter repeats in court his extrajudicial admission,
and the other accused is accorded the opportunity to crossexamine the admitter, the admission is admissible against
both accused because then, it is transposed into a judicial
admission (Yapyuco v. Sandiganbayan, 674 SCRA 420, 451,
June 25, 2012). (Bar 2003)
Exceptions to the res Inter alios acta rule (first branch)
1. The first branch of the rule admits of certain
exceptions, to wit-.
(a) admission by co-partner or agent (Sec. 30, Rule
130, Rules of Court);
(b) admission by conspirator (Sec. 31, ibid.); and

(c) admission by privies (Sec. 32, ibid.).

Distinctions between extrajudicial and judicial admissions

2. The basis for admitting the above admissions is
that the person making the statement is under the same
circumstances as the person against whom it is offered. Such
circumstances give him substantially the same interest and
the same motive to make a statement about certain matters
(4 Wigmore, Sec. 1080a, 140).

1. A distinction must be made between extrajudicial
and judicial confessions. “An extrajudicial confession may be
given in evidence against the confessant but not against his
co-accused as they are deprived of the opportunity to cross-

Admissions by a co-partner or agent
1. An agent performs some service in representation
of or on behalf of his principal (Art. 1868, Civil Code of the

(1) of them during the trial, implicating the others, is evidence
against the latter” (People v. Lumayag, G.R. No. 181474, July
26, 2017).

EVIDENCE

Philippines). The agent, therefore, is in legal contemplation, a
mere extension of the personality of the principal and unless
the agent acts in his own name, the principal must comply
with all the obligations which the agent may have contracted
within the scope of his authority (Art. 1883; Art. 1910, ibid.).

Hence, whatever is said by an agent to a third person,
during the course of the agency and within the scope of
his actual or apparent authority, relative to the business
contemplated by the agency is, for legal purposes, also the
statement of the principal and is, therefore, admissible
against said principal (29A Am Jur 29, Evidence, §815 citing
Hitchman Coal & Coke Co. v. Mitchell, 245 U.S. 229, 62 L Ed
260, 38 S Ct 65).
2. However, not every declaration or act made or done
by a partner or agent is admissible against the other partners
or the principal. For the admission of a co-partner or agent to
be admissible, the following requisites must concur:
(a) The declaration or act of the partner or agent
must have been made or done within the scope of his

authority;
(b) The declaration or act of the partner or agent
must have been made or done during the existence of
the partnership or agency (while the person making the
declaration was still a partner or an agent); and

(c) The existence of the partnership or agency is
proven by evidence other than the declaration or act of
the partner or agent (Sec. 30, Rule 130, Rules of Court).

3. Any declaration made before the partnership or
agency existed, or those made after, are not admissible against
the other partners or the principal but remains admissible
against the partner or agent making the declaration. It is also
necessary for the application of the exception that the proof of
the agency or partnership be from a source independent of the
declaration made by the partner or agent.

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
291
E. Admissions, Confessions snd the Res Inter Alios Acta Rule (Rule 130)

Thus, if after the partnership is dissolved and liquidated,
AA, a former partner in ABC Partnership, admits before a
police investigator that he and his partners were engaged
in smuggling highly dutiable imported cigarettes while
the partnership was operating a buy and sell business, the
extrajudicial declarations of AA are not admissible against
BB and CC, his former partners. His declarations are,
nevertheless, admissible against him.

4.

The above rules also apply to the declarations or

acts of a joint owner, joint debtor, or other persons jointly

interested with the party (Ibid.).

Admissions by a conspirator
1. A conspiracy exists when two or more persons come
to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and
decide to commit it (Art. 8, Revised Penal Code; People v.
Sabado, G.R. No. 218910, July 5, 2017). Once the conspiracy is
proven, the act of one is the act of all. The statement, therefore,
of one may be admitted against the other co-conspirators as
an exception to the rule on res inter alios acta.
2. Assume that two months after a successful bank
robbery, A was arrested as a direct participant in the crime.
During a television interview, he admitted his participation
in the robbery. He also implicated B and C as his other
companions in planning and executing the robbery. Is his
statement admissible? The statement is admissible as to him
(Sec. 27, Rule 130, Rules of Court) but not as to B and C (Sec.
29, ibid.). (Bar 1991)

To be admissible against B and C, the following must
concur:
(a) The declaration or act be made or done during
the existence of the conspiracy;
(b) The declaration or act must relate to the
conspiracy; and
(c) The conspiracy must be shown by evidence
other than such declaration or act (Sec. 31, ibid.).

292

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

Observe that the declaration of A was made long after
the conspiracy was over. It was then no longer made during
the existence of the conspiracy. In fact, at the time of the
declaration, A was no longer a co-conspirator. Even assuming
that the conspiracy can be proven by independent evidence
and even if his statement was related to the conspiracy, the
declaration is not admissible as an exception to the rule of res
inter alios acta.

The arrest of the declarant is often found to terminate
the declarant’s participation in the conspiracy so that the
declarant’s post arrest statements do not qualify as admissible
co-conspirator statements (29A Am Jur, Evidence, §840). An
extrajudicial confession is binding only upon the confessant
and is not admissible against his co-accused (People v. Raquel,
265 SCRA 248). As against the latter, the confession is hearsay
(People v. Camat, 256 SCRA 52).
3. The rule of res inter alios acta does not apply
when the co-accused takes the witness stand and repeats
his extrajudicial confession as a witness. The declarations
referred to under Sec. 31 of Rule 130 are merely extrajudicial
statements or declarations. When he testifies as a witness, his
statements become judicial and are admissible not only against
him but also against his co-accused. This is also because the
statements by witnesses in open court are admissible as
testimonies of a person based on his personal perceptions and
knowledge pursuant to Sec. 22 of Rule 130, Rules of Court.
It was thus, held that when several persons are tried
together, the confession made by one of them during the
trial implicating the others is evidence against the latter. An
accused is always a competent witness for or against his co¬
accused (People v. Opiniano, G.R. No. 181474, July 26, 2017).
4. Jurisprudence holds that the general rule is that
the extrajudicial confession or admission of one accused is
admissible only against the said accused but inadmissible
against the other accused. However, if the declarant/admitter
repeats in court his extrajudicial confession during trial and
the other accused is accorded the opportunity to cross-examine

—

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
293
E. Admissions, Confessions and the Res Inter Alios Acta Rule (Rule 130)

the admitter, such confession or admission is admissible
against both accused. The erstwhile extrajudicial confession
or admission, when repeated during the trial, is transposed
into judicial admissions (People v. Buntag, 427 SCRA 180).

5. The Supreme Court also held in one case that
a distinction must be made between an extrajudicial and
judicial confession. An extrajudicial confession may be given
in evidence against the confessant but not against his co¬
accused since the latter are not afforded the opportunity to
cross-examine him. A judicial confession is admissible against
the declarant’s co-accused since the latter is afforded the
opportunity to cross-examine the former. Section 30 (now Sec.
31) of Rule 130 applies only to extrajudicial admissions and
not to testimonies at trial where the party adversely affected
has the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant (People v.
Palijon, 343 SCRA 486).
When the extrajudicial admission of a conspirator is
confirmed at the trial, it ceases to be hearsay. It becomes,
instead, a judicial admission, being a testimony of an
eyewitness admissible in evidence against those he implicates.
Here, the extrajudicial confession was affirmed by him in open
court during the trial. Thus, such confession already partook
of judicial admission (Abay, Jr. v. People, 566 SCRA 34).
6. Also, assuming that the statement relating to the
conspiracy was made by a conspirator during the existence
of the conspiracy, for the statement to be admitted, the
extrajudicial statements of the co-conspirator must be proven
by evidence other than such admission (Sec. 31, Rule 1 30, Rules
of Court; U.S. v. Arias-Villanueva [CA9 Or] 998 F2d 1491; 29A
Am Jur 2d, §847). If the only evidence of the conspiracy is the
extrajudicial declaration of the declarant, the statements are
not admissible against the others.

In indicting accused-appellant, the prosecution relied
heavily on the affidavits executed by the two other accused.
The Solicitor General, in advocating the admissibility of the
sworn statements of the brothers, cited Sec. 30 (now Sec.
31), Rule 130 of the Rules of Court which provides that,

294

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

“[t]he act or declaration of a conspirator [in furtherance of] the
conspiracy and during its existence, may be given in evidence
against the co-conspirator after the conspiracy is shown by
evidence other than such act or declaration.”

The Court ruled that the inapplicability of the provision
relied upon was clearly apparent. The confessions were made
after the conspiracy had ended and after the consummation
of the crime. Hence, it cannot be said that the execution of
the affidavits were acts or declarations made during the
conspiracy’s existence (People v. Quidato, Jr., 297 SCRA 1).
7. The res inter alios acta rule provides that the rights
of a party cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or
omission of another. Consequently, an extrajudicial confession
is binding only upon the confessant and is not admissible
against his co-accused. The reason for the rule is that, on a
principle of good faith and mutual convenience, a man’s own
acts are binding upon himself and are evidence against him.
So are his conduct and declarations. Yet, it would not only be
rightly inconvenient, but also manifestly unjust, that a man
should be bound by the acts of mere unauthorized strangers;
and if a party ought not to be bound by the acts of strangers,
neither ought their acts or conduct be used as evidence against
him

The rule on admissions made by a conspirator is
an exception to the foregoing rule but in order for such
admission to be admissible against a co-accused, Sec. 31,
Rule 130 of the Rules of Court requires, among others, that
there be independent evidence aside from the extrajudicial
confession to prove conspiracy. If apart from the extrajudicial
confession of the confessant, no other evidence of the alleged
participation of the accused in the conspiracy was presented
by the prosecution, the culpability of the accused could not be
sufficiently established (People v. Guittap, 403 SCRA 167).

Admission by privies
1. “Privies” are persons who are partakers or have
an interest in any action or thing, or any relation to another

CHAPTER V- TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
295
E. Admissions, Confessions and the Res Inter Alios Acta Rule (Rule 130)

(Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., p. 1077). Examples: (a) A
lessor and his lessee, a grantor and a grantee; an assignor
and an assignee are privies in an estate or a contract; (b) An
executor or an administrator and the estate of the deceased
are privies in representation; or (c) An heir and his ascendant
are privies in blood or succession.
2. Z inherited a house and lot from his father, X.
Assume that X, while alive, sold the property and, thereafter,

openly told his acquaintances that the same lot where his
house stood had already been sold to Y. Is this declaration by
X necessarily admissible against Z?
It is not because the statement was made after X held
his title to the land. For an admission of a predecessor-ininterest to be admissible against the successor-in-interest, the
following requisites must be present:
(a) There must be an act, declaration or omission
by a predecessor-in-interest;
(b) The act, declaration, or omission of the
predecessor must have occurred while he was holding
(not after) the title to the property; and

(c) The act, declaration, or omission must be in
relation to the property (Sec. 32, Rule 130, Rules of Court).

3. Accordingly, when the former owner of the property
made the declaration after he ceased to be the owner of the
property, the rule on admission by privies does not apply.
What applies is the general rule that the rights of a party
cannot be prejudiced by an act, declaration, or omission of
another (Gevero v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 189 SCRA
201).
Offer of compromise in civil cases

In civil cases, an offer of compromise is not an admission
of any liability, and is not admissible in evidence against
the offeror (Sec. 28, Rule 130, Rules of Court). The amended
provision under the 2019 Amendments to the Rules on
Evidence also renders inadmissible any evidence of conduct or

I

296

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

statement made during the compromise negotiations, except
for evidence otherwise discoverable or offered for another
purpose, such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness,
negativing a contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to
obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution (Ibid.).
Offer of compromise in criminal cases (Bar 1989, 2008)

1. An offer of compromise by the accused may be
received in evidence as an implied admission of guilt (Ibid.).
The rule does not make a distinction between an extrajudicial
and a judicial offer of compromise. In either case, the offer of
compromise implies an admission of criminal liability.
2. An offer of compromise made by one not authorized
by the accused does not amount to an implied admission of
guilt. In one case, the Court instructs: “x x x [W]e believe
that the better rule is that for a compromise to amount to an
implied admission of guilt, the accused should be present or
at least had authorized the compromise” (People u. Bangcado,
G.R. No. 132330, November 28, 2000).

3. Even if the offer of compromise is accepted by the
offended party, the criminal liability of the accused is not
extinguished.

Jurisprudence gives a clear reminder: “It needs to be
remembered that a compromise is not one of the grounds
prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for the extinction of
criminal liability” (Team Image Entertainment, Inc. v. Solar
Team Entertainment, Inc., G.R. No. 191652, September 13,
2017; See Article 89 of the Revised Penal Code). Hence, even
if there is a compromise, criminal liability for estafa is not
affected by compromise or novation of contract, for it is a
public offense which must be prosecuted and punished by
the Government on its own motion even though complete
reparation should have been made of the damage suffered
by the offended party. A criminal offense is committed
against the People and the offended party may not waive or
extinguish the criminal liability that the law imposes for the
commission of the offense. The criminal liability for estafa

—

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
297
E. Admissions, Confessions and the Res Inter Alice Acta Rule (Rule 130)

already committed is not affected by the subsequent novation
of the contract (Deganon u. People, G.R. No. 162826, October
14, 2010).

4. A reading of the tenor of Sec. 28 of Rule 130 would
give rise to a reasonable conclusion that there should be
no implied admission of guilt if the offer of compromise is
in relation to: (a) quasi-offenses (criminal negligence); or
(b) cases allowed by law to be compromised. Thus, offenses
committed by imprudence and negligence, described in Art.
365 of the Revised Penal Code on quasi-offenses/criminal
negligence, may be compromised without the adverse effect
of an implied admission of guilt. Thus, the accused should be
allowed to make an offer of compromise in a case of reckless
imprudence resulting in homicide without the offer being
deemed an admission of guilt.

Note, however, in the offenses of seduction, abduction,
acts of lasciviousness and rape enumerated under Art. 344
of the Revised Penal Code, marriage of the offender with
the offended party shall extinguish the criminal action or
remit the penalty already imposed upon him. While Art.
89 of the Revised Penal Code does not mention the term
“compromise” as a mode of extinguishing criminal liability, it
may be reasonably argued that, from a practical standpoint,
the marriage is a consequence of a compromise agreement
between the parties. An offer of marriage, therefore, should
not entail an implied admission of guilt.

It appears that jurisprudence holds otherwise in cases
where no marriage takes place in any of the above offenses
between the offender and the offended party.
One judicial pronouncement instructs: “As a rule in
rape cases, an offer of marriage to the offended party is an
admission of guilt” (People v. Bulos, G.R. No. 123542, June

26, 2001).
Plea of guilty later withdrawn

In case the accused withdraws his guilty plea, that plea
of guilty later withdrawn is not admissible in evidence against

298

(The Bar Lectures Series)

the accused who made the plea. The inadmissibility also
applies to any statement made in the course of plea bargaining
with the prosecution as long as it does not result in a plea of
guilty or results in a plea of guilty later withdrawn. (Sec. 28,
Rule 130, Rules of Court).
Unaccepted plea of guilty to a lesser offense

If the plea of guilty to a lesser offense is not accepted,
the rule does not provide for an adverse consequence of the
unaccepted plea. On the contrary, the rule provides that an
unaccepted plea of guilty to a lesser offense is not admissible
in evidence against the accused who made the plea or offer
(Ibid.).
Offer to pay or the payment of medical, hospital, or other
expenses

An offer to pay or the payment of medical, hospital, or
other expenses occasioned by an injury is not admissible in
evidence as proof of civil or criminal liability for the injury
(Ibid.). In other jurisdictions, this act of rendering aid is
sometimes called the “Good Samaritan rule.” The phrase is
used to refer to the rendering of voluntary aid to a suffering
person.

Subsequent remedial measures

Assume that PP, while negotiating the stairs from the
lobby of a hotel to his third floor room, slipped and fell from
the stairs and sustained head injuries. The hotel owner, upon
learning of the accident, immediately ordered the maintenance
department of the hotel to install a non-slippery material on
every step of the stairway. In an action for damages against
the hotel owner by PP, may the latter introduce evidence of the
subsequent remedial measures taken to prove an admission
by the defendant of the hazardous condition of the stairway at
the time of the incident?

No direct legal provision in this jurisdiction addresses
the question as it is. It is, however, interesting to observe

—

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
299
E. Admissions, Confessions and the Res Inter Alios Acta Rule (Rule 130)

that the U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), in Rule 407
thereof, prohibits the admission of evidence of subsequent
remedial measures when offered to prove the negligence of
the defendant. Evidence of such measures may, however, be
admissible to prove some other purpose like the fact that the
defendant had ownership of the hotel or control over the same
and all the fixtures therein.
Accordingly, the rule is based on the policy of encouraging
potential defendants to remedy hazardous conditions without
fear that their actions will be used as evidence against them
(Pau u. Yosemite Park [CA9 Cal] 928 F2d, 880). To adopt
the contrary rule would discourage owners from improving
the condition causing the injury because of their fear of the
evidential use of such improvement to their disadvantage
(Werner v. Upjohn Co. [CA4 MD] 628 F2d, 848; 29 Am Jur 2d
§463-464).
The rule (FRE 407) provides that:
“When after an event, measures are taken which,
if taken previously, would have made the event less
likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is
not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct
in connection with the event. This rule does not require
the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when
offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership,
control, or feasibility of precautionary measures, if
controverted, or impeachment.”

Evidence of similar conduct (Bar 2011)
1. The general rule is that the law will not consider
evidence that a person has done a certain act at a particular
time as probative of a contention that he has done a similar act
at another time. This is the rule of res inter alios acta found in
Sec. 35, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court, as amended. A similar
conduct which does not even sufficiently establish a plan or
scheme is not admissible (Enriquez v. People, 331 SCRA 538;
Espinosa v. Sandiganbayan, 331 SCRA 538).

r

CHAPTER V- TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
301
E. Admissions, Confessions and the Res Inter Alios Acta Rule (Rule 130)

(The Bar Lectures Series)

2. Assume that Mr. X is accused of physical injuries.
Is evidence that, in the past, he committed several acts
constituting physical injuries admissible to prove his
propensity for committing such acts or that he acted in
conformity with his past acts? Answer: The evidence is not
admissible for the purpose for which it is offered. Section 35 of
Rule 130 clearly provides:

—

“SEC. 35. Similar acts as evidence.
Evidence
that one did or did not do a certain thing at one time
is not admissible to prove that he or she did or did not
do the same or a similar thing at another time; but it
may be received to prove a specific intent or knowledge,
identity, plan, system, scheme, habit, custom or usage,
and the like.”

The above provision constitutes the second branch of
the res inter alios acta rule as previously mentioned.
3.

The rule prohibits the admission of the so-called
“propensity evidence” which is evidence that tends to show
that what a person has done at one time is probative of the
contention that he has done a similar act at another time.
4. Evidence of similar acts or occurrences compels the
defendant to meet allegations that are not mentioned in the
complaint, confuses him in his defense, raises a variety of
relevant issues, and diverts the attention of the court from
the issues immediately before it. Hence, the evidentiary rule
guards the practical inconvenience of trying collateral issues
and protracting the trial and prevents surprise or other
mischief prejudicial to litigants (Cruz v. Court of Appeals, 293
SCRA 239).

Under Sec. 35 of Rule 130, although the accused has
previously been charged with and convicted of similar
offenses, the trial court commits an error if it considers such
circumstance for the purpose of showing that he was likely
to commit the crimes charged in the indictment. Evidence
of collateral offenses must not be received as substantive
evidence of the offenses on trial (People u. Santos, 536 SCRA
489).

5. Under the same rule, in an action to collect a sum
of money, evidence that the debtor had contracted debts with
various persons in the past and had not paid such debts,
despite demand, is not admissible to show that the debtor did
not pay his obligation to the plaintiff in the present case. In
a similar vein, evidence that Jose was cleared of a previous
charge of robbery or that he was never involved in any robbery
in the past is not admissible to prove that he could not have
committed the robbery for which he is presently charged. The
rule enunciated in Sec. 35 of Rule 130 is also founded on plain
common sense. To argue that a person did or did not commit
an act because he did or did not commit a similar thing in the
past is certainly non sequitur.
When evidence of similar acts or previous conduct is

admissible
1. Evidence of similar acts is admissible for any of the
following purposes:
(a) specific intent;
(b) knowledge;
(c) identity;

(d) plan;
(e) system;

(f)

scheme;

(g) habit;
(h) custom;

(i)

usage; and

the like (Sec. 35, Rule 130, Rules of Court).
2. Evidence of similar acts may frequently become
relevant, especially in actions based on fraud and deceit,
because it sheds light on the state of mind or knowledge of a
person, his motive or intent, or they may uncover a scheme,
design or plan (Cruz v. Court of Appeals, 293 SCRA 239).
(j)

r
evidence

302

(The Bar Lectures Series)

3. The admissibility of similar acts or previous conduct
would depend on the purposes for which such acts or conduct
are offered.
For example, evidence of the other similar crimes, acts or
wrongs previously committed by the accused are admissible
to show that the offense for which he is currently charged and
his prior similar acts show the “signature” or “handiwork” of
the accused, or because of identical modus operandi. In other
words, the similar acts may be offered to show that they share
distinctive features as the offense for which the accused is
currently charged with, but the evidence cannot be offered to
show that the accused is likely to be guilty of the charge for
having committed the same or similar acts before his present

indictment. The rule is: The past acts of the accused are
inadmissible to prove that he acted in conformity with such
previous acts.

most courts in cities, given the huge volume of cases filed each
year and the slow cumbersome adversarial system that the
judiciary has in place.” The Rule also recognizes that “about
40% of criminal cases are dismissed annually owing to the
fact that complainants simply give up coming to court after
repeated postponements.”
2. The same “whereas clause” reports that after the
evaluation of a pilot project in Quezon City requiring the
compulsory use of judicial affidavits, “such piloting has quickly
resulted in reducing by about two-thirds the time used for
presenting the testimonies of witnesses, thus speeding up the
hearing and adjudication of cases.”

Thus, in order “to replicate nationwide the success of the
Quezon City experience in the use of judicial affidavits,” the
Supreme Court promulgated the Judicial Affidavit Rule.
I

F. Judicial Affidavit Rule (A.M. No. 12-8-8-SC)
Rationale for the Judicial Affidavit Rule

1. The most basic reason for the adoption of the Rule
is to decongest the courts of cases and to reduce delays in the
disposition of cases. The Rule is designed to expedite court
proceedings and primarily affects the manner by which
evidence is presented in court particularly with regard to
the taking of the testimony of a witness. The Rule is not
devised to supplant or amend existing procedural rules but to
supplement and augment them (See Lara’s Gift and Decors,
Inc. v. PNB General Insurers Co., Inc., G.R. Nos. 230429-30,
January 24, 2018).

Due to these delays, the Supreme Court declares in the
“whereas clause” of the Rule, that “few foreign businessmen
make long-term investments in the Philippines because its
courts are unable to provide ample and speedy protection to
their investments, keeping its people poor.”
The “whereas clause” of the Judicial Affidavit Rule,
likewise, affirms that “case congestion and delays plague

Significance of the use of a judicial affidavit; exhibits

The judicial affidavit shall take the place of the direct
testimonies of witnesses (Sec. 2[a][l], Judicial Affidavit Rule;
See Logon v. Velasco, G.R. No. 208424, February 14, 2018). The
rule, therefore, modifies the existing practice in the conduct of
a trial and reception of evidence by doing away with the usual
oral examination of a witness in a direct examination.
1.

2. To be attached to the judicial affidavit are the
documentary or object, evidence of the parties which shall
be marked as Exhibits A, B, C, and so on in the case of the
complainant or plaintiff. In the case of the respondent or the
defendant, the evidence shall be marked as Exhibits 1, 2, 3
and so on (Sec. 2[a][2], Judicial Affidavit Rule).
3. The original document or object evidence need not
be attached to the judicial affidavit. The party or witness may
keep the same in his possession after the exhibit has been
identified, marked as an exhibit and authenticated. He must,
however, warrant in his judicial affidavit that the copy or
reproduction attached is a faithful copy or reproduction of the
original (Sec. 2[b], ibid.).

—

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
F. Judicial Affidavit Rule (A.M. No. 12-8-8-SQ

Aside from the above requirement, the party or witness is
required to bring the original document or object evidence for
comparison with the attached copy, reproduction or pictures,
during the preliminary conference. In case of failure to bring
the originals for comparison, the attached copy, reproduction
or pictures shall not be admitted (Sec. 2[b], ibid.).
Scope of the Judicial Affidavit Rule

evidence. Remember that the Judicial Affidavit Rule, in Sec.
1 thereof, requires its application to all actions, proceedings,
and incidents requiring the reception of evidence.
2. Note, however, that the Judicial Affidavit Rule
applies to criminal cases where “the maximum of the
imposable penalty does not exceed six years” (Sec. 9(1J, ibid.).
In other cases, the use of judicial affidavits will now depend on
the accused. The Rule will apply, irrespective of the penalty
involved, where the accused agrees to the use of judicial
affidavits (Sec. 9(2], ibid.).

(a) Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial
Courts in Cities, Municipal Trial Courts, Municipal
Circuit Trial Courts and the Shari’a Circuit Courts but

With respect to the civil aspect of the criminal action, the
Judicial Affidavit Rule shall apply, irrespective of the penalty
involved (Sec. 9(3], ibid.). Hence, with respect to the civil
aspect, the penalty for the offense is not to be considered.
It is understood that the civil aspect of the criminal action
refers to the action to recover civil liability “arising from the
offense charged” and which is deemed instituted with the
criminal action as provided in Sec. 1 of Rule 111 of the Rules

(b) Regional Trial Courts and Shari’a District
Courts;

Contents of the Judicial affidavit

2. The Rule, in effect, applies to all courts, other than
the Supreme Court. It also applies to certain non -judicial
bodies. The Rule specifies the following courts and bodies:

(c) Sandiganbayan, Court of Tax Appeals, Court of
Appeals and Shari’a Appellate Courts;

(d) Investigating officers and bodies authorized
by the Supreme Court to receive evidence, including the
Integrated Bar of the Philippines; and

(e) Special courts and quasi-judicial bodies, whose
rules of procedure are subject to disapproval of the
Supreme Court (Sec. 1, ibid.).

Applicability of the Judicial Affidavit Rule to criminal cases

1. The Judicial Affidavit Rule shall apply to criminal
cases (Sec. 9, ibid.).

The reason for the above rule is not difficult to appreciate.
Criminal cases are actions which require the reception of

l

305

of Court.

1. A judicial affidavit shall be prepared in the language
known to the witness. If the affidavit is not in English or
Filipino, it shall be accompanied by a translation in either
language (Sec. 3, ibid.).
2. The judicial affidavit shall contain the name, age,
residence or business address, and occupation of the witness
(Sec. 3[a], ibid.).

There must also be a statement in the affidavit that
the witness is answering the questions asked of him, fully
conscious that he does so under oath, and that he may face
criminal liability for false testimony or perjury (Sec. 3[cJ,
ibid.).

3. The judicial affidavit shall also contain the name
and address of the lawyer. This is because the examination

EVIDENCE

306

of the witness shall be conducted and supervised by a lawyer
(Sec. 3[b], ibid.).

4. The judicial affidavit shall also indicate the place
where the examination is being held (Sec. 3[b], ibid.).
5,

The judicial affidavit shall contain the questions
asked of the witness and his answers to the questions, all
consecutively numbered. The questions and answers shall:
(a) show the circumstances under which the
witness acquired the facts upon which he testifies;
(b) elicit from him those facts which are relevant to
the issues that the case presents; and
(c) identify the attached documentary and object
evidence and establish their authenticity (Sec. 3[d], ibid.).

It is evident that the questions to be asked will determine
whether or not the witness has personal knowledge of the facts
upon which he testifies, and thus, prevent the introduction
into the record of mere hearsay testimonies. The matters
testified to should also be on matters relevant to the issues
of the case. The affidavit also requires that the witness not
merely identify the exhibits but also authenticate the same
for evidentiary purposes.

CHAPTER V - TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
F. Judicial Affidavit Rule (A.M. No. 12-8-8-SC)

307

Effect of non-compliance with the content and attestation
requirements of the Judicial Affidavit Rule

A judicial affidavit which does not conform to the content
and attestation requirements of Sec. 3 and 4 of the Judicial
Affidavit Rule shall not be admitted by the court in evidence
(Sec. 10[c], ibid.).
The relevant provision, however, does not absolutely bar
the submission of a compliant replacement judicial affidavit as
long as the replacement shall be submitted before the hearing
or trial and the following requisites are met:
1.

The submission shall be allowed only once;

2.

The delay is for a valid reason;

3. The delay would not unduly prejudice the
opposing party; and
4. The public or private counsel responsible for
the preparation and submission of the affidavit pays a
fine of not less than Pl,000.00 nor more than P5,000.00,
at the discretion of the court (Sec. 10[c], ibid.).
Sworn attestation of the lawyer

Under the Rules of Court, proof of the due execution and
authenticity of a private document shall be made in case the
document is offered as authentic. If not offered as authentic,
the private document need only be identified as that which it
is claimed to be (Sec. 20, Rule 132, Rules of Court). Nothing
in the provisions of the Judicial Affidavit Rule dispenses with
the application of this principle.

The judicial affidavit, aside from the content requirements
of Sec. 3 of the Judicial Affidavit Rule, shall also contain a
sworn attestation at the end, executed by the lawyer who
conducted and supervised the examination, to the effect that
there was a faithful recording of the questions and answers
in the judicial affidavit and that there was no coaching of the
witness on what to answer. Specifically, the sworn attestation
shall attest to the following:

6. The judicial affidavit shall be signed by the witness
over his printed name (Sec. 3[e], Judicial Affidavit Rule).
7. The judicial affidavit shall contain a jurat, with the
signature of the notary public who administers the oath or
an officer who is authorized to administer the same (Sec. 3[f],
ibid.).

(a) That he faithfully recorded or caused to be
recorded the questions he asked and the corresponding
answers that the witness gave; and
(b) That neither he nor any other person present or
assisting him coached the witness regarding the latter’s
answers (Sec. 4[a], ibid.).

Effect of a false attestation by the lawyer

A false attestation shall subject the lawyer to disciplinary
action, including disbarment (Sec. 4[b], ibid.).

2. The court may allow the late submission of the
judicial affidavit and exhibits provided the following requisites

concur:

Judicial affidavits must be attached to the Complaint and
Answer

(a) A late submission shall be allowed only once;

Under Sec. 6(b) of Rule 7 of the Rules of Civil Procedure,
as amended, the judicial affidavits of witnesses shall already
be attached to every pleading stating a party’s claims or
defenses. Only witnesses whose judicial affidavits are attached
to the pleading shall be presented by the parties during trial.
Except if a party presents meritorious reasons as basis for
the admission of additional witnesses, no other witness or
affidavit shall be heard or admitted by the court.

(c) The late submission will not unduly prejudice
the opposing party; and
(d) The defaulting party pays a fine of not less than
Pl,000.00 nor more than P5, 000.00, at the discretion of
the court (Ibid.; See also Lara’s Gift and Decors, Inc. v.
PNB General Insurers Co., Inc., G.R. Nos. 230429-30,
January 24, 2018).

Effects of failure to submit the judicial affidavits and exhibits
on time

1. A party who fails to submit the required judicial
affidavits and exhibits on time shall be deemed to have waived
their submission (Sec. I0[a], ibid.).
2. The waiver would mean that a party who failed to
submit the judicial affidavit of a particular witness would have
no direct testimony for that witness and the documentary or
object evidence integrated with such affidavit could not be
identified, marked as an exhibit, and authenticated. In effect,
the exhibit could not be offered in evidence.
If the waiver extends to the required affidavits of all the
witnesses of a party because all the judicial affidavits were
not filed and served, then said party is deemed to have not
presented his evidence-in-chief for his case.
Remedy in case of late submission
1, The failure of a party to submit a judicial affidavit
on time does not mean a permanent waiver to submit the
same. He is given another chance to do so. The remedy is to
move that the late submission of the judicial affidavit and its
exhibits be allowed.

(b) The delay is for a valid reason;

Offer of testimony In the Judicial affidavit

Instead of offering the oral testimony of the witness, the
party using the judicial affidavit of his witness in place of a
direct testimony, shall present such affidavit and state the
purpose of the testimony contained therein at the start of the
presentation of the witness (Sec. 6, Judicial Affidavit Rule).
Objections to testimony in the judicial affidavit; ruling of the
court

1. The presentation of the judicial affidavit and the
statement of the purpose of the testimony contained therein
will give the adverse party the opportunity to object to the
testimony.
The adverse party may, on the ground of inadmissibility,
move to (a) disqualify the witness, (b) strike out his affidavit,
or (c) strike out any of the answers found in the judicial
affidavit (Sec. 6, ibid.).
2. The court is required to promptly rule on the motion
of the adverse party. If it grants the motion, any excluded
answer shall be marked by placing the same in brackets under
the initials of an authorized court personnel. The other party
may, however, make a tender of excluded evidence under Sec.
40 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Court (Sec. 6, ibid.).

310

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

3. The provisions of Sec. 6 of the J udicial Affidavit Rule
require the court to promptly rule on the motion of the adverse
party.

The term “promptly," it is submitted, should be taken
in its literal context and akin to the word, “immediately,” as
used in Sec. 38 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Court. Under the
said provision, the ruling of the court in case of an objection,
must be given immediately. The mandate on the giving of an
immediate ruling is, however, qualified by the phrase, “unless
the court desires to take a reasonable time to inform itself
on the question presented.” It is significant to note that such
qualification is not found in the Judicial Affidavit Rule.
Appearance of the witness at the scheduled hearing

1. The submission of the judicial affidavit of the witness
and the attached exhibits does not exempt the witness from
appearing at the scheduled hearing. The rule still requires his
appearance (Sec. 10[b], ibid.).
2. The appearance of the witness is necessary because
the adverse party has the right to cross-examine him. The
cross-examination shall be on his judicial affidavit and on
the attached exhibits. After the cross-examination, the party
presenting the witness may also examine him as on re-direct
(Sec. 7, ibid.).
A postponement of the cross-examination would be
contrary to the spirit of the rule because the judicial affidavits
have been filed and served even before the scheduled hearing.
3. The court, under the Judicial Affidavit Rule, is not
a mere passive entity that merely receives evidence from the
parties. The Rule integrates an element of the inquisitorial
system which allows the court to have an active role in the
proceedings. The Rule clearly mandates the court to take
active part in examining the witness to (a) determine the (i)
credibility of the witness and (ii) truth of his testimony; and
(b) elicit the answers that it needs in resolving the case (Sec.
7, ibid.). The questions of the court shall not, therefore, be
confined to mere clarificatory questions.

CHAPTER V TESTIMONIAL EVIDENCE
F. Judicial Affidavit Rule (AM. No. 12-8-8-SC)

3n

Effect of failure of a witness to appear at the scheduled
hearing; failure of counsel to appear

1. The court shall not consider the affidavit of any
witness who does not appear in the scheduled hearing of
the case as required (Sec. 10[b], ibid.). If the affidavit is not
considered, it is as if no judicial affidavit has been executed by
the absent witness. Such witness, hence, shall be deemed as
not having given a direct testimony in the trial.
2. It is the duty of counsel to appear at the scheduled
hearing because of the adverse effect of his failure to do so on
a basic right of his client.
A counsel who fails to appear without a valid cause
despite notice shall be deemed to have waived his client’s
right to confront by cross-examination, the witnesses present
(Sec. 10[b], ibid.).

When there is a need for the issuance of a subpoena
1. A requesting party may avail himself of the issuance
of a subpoena ad testificandum or duces tecum under Rule 21
of the Rules of Court if a witness unjustifiably declines to (a)
execute a judicial affidavit, or (b) refuses without just cause
to make the relevant books, documents, or other things under
his control available for copying, authentication, and eventual
production in court (Sec. 5, ibid.).

The witness referred to is a government employee or
official, or a requested witness, who is neither the witness of
the adverse party nor a hostile witness (Sec. 5, ibid.).
2. The rules governing the issuance of a subpoena to
the witness shall be the same as when taking his deposition
except that the taking of a judicial affidavit shall be understood
to be ex parte (Sec. 5, ibid.).

Oral offer and objections to exhibits
1. A party shall immediately make an oral offer of
evidence of his documentary or object exhibits, piece by piece,

EVIDENCE

312

(The Bar Lectures Series)

in their chronological order, stating the purpose or purposes
for which he offers the particular exhibit. The offer shall be
made upon the termination of the testimony of his last witness
(Sec. 8[a], ibid.).

It is not necessary to describe each exhibit in the offer of
evidence. It is sufficient that such exhibits are simply cited
by their markings during the offers, the objections, and the
rulings, dispensing with the description of each exhibit since
the documentary or object exhibits form part of the judicial
affidavits that describe and authenticate them (Sec. 8[c],
ibid.).

After each piece of exhibit is offered, the adverse party
shall state the legal ground for his objection, if any, to its
admission, and the court shall immediately make its ruling
respecting that exhibit (Sec. 8[b], ibid.).
2.

Under Sec. 35 of Rule 132 of the Rules of Court,

documentary and object evidence shall be offered after the

presentation of a party’s testimonial evidence. Under the
2019 Amendments to the Rules on Evidence, all evidence
must now be offered orally. The Judicial Affidavit Rule
likewise echoes the same principle, requiring that the offer of
a party’s documentary or object exhibits shall be made upon
the termination of the testimony of his last witness and only
orally.

HEARSAY EVIDENCE, OPINION EVIDENCE,
AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
A. Preliminaries
Hearsay evidence (Bar 2004, 2007, 2011)

The Philippine version of the hearsay rule is embodied in
Sec. 22 and Sec. 37 of Rule 130 which provide:
"SEC. 22- Testimony confined to personal
knowledge. — A witness can testify only to those facts
which he or she knows of his or her personal knowledge;
that Is, which are derived from his or her own perception,
except as otherwise provided In these rules.”
"SEC, 37, Hearsay. — Hearsay is a statement other
than one made bv the declarant while testifying at a
trial or hearing, offered to prove the truth of the facts
asserted therein, A statement Is (1) an oral or written
assertion or (2) a non-verbal conduct of a person, if
it is intended bv him or her as an assertion. Hearsay
evidence Is inadmissible except as otherwise provided
in these Rules.

A statement is not hearsay if the declarant testifies
at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination
concerning the statement, and the statement Is (a)
inconsistent with the declarant's testimony, and was
given under oath subject to the penalty_of oeriurv at a
trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition:
(b) consistent with the declarant's testimony and Is
offered to rebut an express or Implied charge against
the declarant of recent fabrication or improper influence
or motive; or (c) one of identification of a person made

CHAPTER VI HEARSAY EVIDENCE, OPINION
EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
A. Preliminaries

(The Bar Lectures Series)

Hearsay evidence generally not admissible

1. Hearsay evidence, in less technical terms, refers
to evidence offered by a witness in court to prove the truth
of a fact, not based on his personal knowledge, but on the
knowledge of another person who is not on the witness stand.
The witness, in testifying, asserts that the facts are true by
merely repeating in court what someone else has told him
outside the court. Thus, if the witness testifies that it was
indeed Mr. RR who robbed Mr. W because that is what Mr.
WW told him, the testimony of the witness is hearsay.

2. Unless the evidence falls under any of the recognized
exceptions, hearsay evidence is not admissible. A witness can
only testify on the truth of facts within his personal knowledge
(For further readings, see Arjonillo v. Pagulayan, G.R No.
196074, October 4, 2017).
Hearsay may be oral or written

Hearsay is not limited to oral testimony or statements.
The rule that excludes hearsay evidence applies to both
written and oral statement (D.M. Consunji, Inc. v. Court of
Appeals, 357 SCRA 249, cited in Malayan Insurance Co. v.
Alberto, 664 SCRA 791, 799, February 1, 2012).
Basis for excluding hearsay evidence

1. The rule excluding hearsay testimony rests mainly
on the ground that there is no opportunity to cross-examine
the person to whom statements or writings are attributed
(Marina Port Services, Inc. v. American Home Assurance
Corp., G.R. No. 201822, August 12, 2015). Moreover, the court
is without the opportunity to test the credibility of hearsay
statements by observing the demeanor of the person who
made them (People v. Padit, G.R No. 202978, February 1,
2016).

Thus, for instance, the person who makes a private survey
report, must be presented in court to testify on the same. Being
a private document, it cannot be accorded probative value if

315

the party against whom it is presented is deprived of the right
to cross-examine such person (Marina Port Services, Inc. v.
American Home Assurance Corp., G.R. No. 201822, August 12,
2015).
2.

An affidavit is merely hearsay evidence where its

affiant/maker did not take the witness stand (Rosit v. Davao
Doctors Hospital, G.R. No. 210445, December 7, 2015). While
affidavits that have been notarized are public documents if
they are acknowledged before a notary public, these are still
considered hearsay unless the affiants themselves are placed
on the witness stand to testify thereon. The reason for this
rule is that, generally, they are not prepared by the affiants,
but by another one who uses his own language in writing
the statements, parts of which may be either omitted or
misunderstood by the one writing them. Moreover, the adverse
party is deprived of cross-examining the affiants (Republic v.
Marcos-Manotoc, 665 SCRA 367, 388, February 8, 2012; See
also Dantis v. Maghinang, G.R. No. 191696, April 10, 2013;
Atienza u. People, G.R. No. 188694, February 12, 2014).

When evidence is hearsay
1. Although hearsay evidence presupposes lack of
personal knowledge of the truth of the fact asserted by a
witness, the purpose for which the evidence is offered is a vital
element of hearsay evidence. It is the purpose for which the
evidence is offered which would determine whether the same
is hearsay or not.

2. The element of “purpose” had long been recognized
in this jurisdiction, as was done in the early case of Robles
u. Lizarraga Hermanos (42 Phil. 584; also cited by Moran,
Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. 5, p. 289).

Here, the Supreme Court admitted an unsigned
statement of accounts not to prove the truth of its entries
but for the purpose of showing the possessor’s good faith in
making improvements on the property, and to show that such
improvements were made pursuant to a verbal contract that
the leased property will eventually be sold to her.

EVIDENCE

316

(The Bar Lectures Series)

The importance of purpose was also recognized by the
Supreme Court in a much earlier case. In U.S. v. Enriquez, I
Phil. 241, testimony was admitted as to the statements made
by another for the purpose of showing his state of mind, his
physical and mental condition, knowledge, belief, intention,
and other emotions. In the same case, documents and letters
were also admitted as circumstantial evidence of a person’s
physical and mental state.

In a much later case, the Supreme Court acknowledged
that the ban on hearsay does not include statements which
are relevant independently of whether they are true or not,
like statements of a person to show, among others, his state of
mind, mental condition, knowledge, belief, intention, ill-will,
and other emotions (Estrada v. Desierto, 356 SCRA 108).
3. The definition of “hearsay” under the 2019
Amendments to the Rules on Evidence was patterned after
the Federal Rules of Evidence (Rule 801[c]) where “hearsay”
is defined as:
“. . . a statement, other than the one made by the
declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered
in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.”

This definition considers “hearsay” as a statement. But
what is a “statement’? The 2019 Amendments have adopted
Rule 801(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence which defines a
statement as either an oral or written assertion or a nonverbal
conduct intended by the person as an assertion. To constitute
hearsay, therefore, there must be:
(1) an out-of-court statement, oral, written or
nonverbal conduct, made by one other than the one made
by the declarant or witness testifying at the trial; and
(2) the out-of-court statement must be offered to
prove the truth of the matter asserted in the out-of-court
statement (29 Am Jur 2d, 2nd Ed., pp. 704-705; FRE,

801[c]).

Anecdotal illustration:

Let us have Jose, a witness testifying in court as to what
his friend, Juan, wrote him. In a letter dated August 5, his
friend wrote Jose that it was a street bum who shot the cop,
not Jose’s uncle. Jose’s friend, Juan, the eyewitness, is not in
court. It is Jose who is in court but we hear Jose presenting a
statement that is not his own. It is a statement made outside
the court by his friend, Juan. His friend’s statement is an
out-of-court statement because when it was made, the friend
who made it was in Cebu and he is not the witness in court.
We clearly have an out-of-court statement from Jose’s friend
whom we shall call an outside declarant. We have the first
part of our formula: An out-of-court statement from an out-ofcourt declarant.
Is Jose’s testimony, therefore, hearsay? Answer: We still
do not know. We do not know because we do not know the
purpose of the testimony. Is it offered to prove that it was
indeed a bum who shot the cop? Or is it offered to prove
something else? We are not sure. If we are not sure, then we
do not know if it is hearsay. How can we be sure then? To be
sure, we must know what it is the proponent wants to prove.
After knowing what he wants to prove, then we ask whether
or not the matter he wants to prove is relevant to an issue
in the case. This is basic, a matter of logic, and no rules of
evidence need tell us this.
Suppose the judge asks: “Counsel, what is the purpose of
Jose’s testimony that his friend wrote him that it was a street
bum who shot the cop and not Jose’s unde?’ ” Comes the quick
reply: “To prove. Your Honor, that Jose's friend was alive on
August 5 and not to prove that it was a bum who shot the cop.
Had he been dead on that day, he would not have been able to
write Jose.”

Is the testimony of Jose hearsay? Now let us go back to
our formula. Do we have an out-of-court statement? Yes, we
do. The friend’s statement is out-of-court and you know the
reason for this. We have our first element, an out-of-court
statement. To be hearsay, we must have the second. Do we

EVIDENCE

318

(The Bar Lectures Series)

have it this time? Let us repeat what counsel says his purpose
is. He says, “To prove, Your Honor, that Jose’s friend was alive
on August 5 etc.” There you are. We do not have the second
part of our formula. We do not have the second part because
we are told the statement is offered to prove that “Jose’s
friend was alive on August 5.” It is not to prove that it was
"a street bum who shot the cop.” The declaration of Juan is
not, therefore, to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the
statement of Juan. We have the first component but we don’t
have the second. What, then, would the judge rule? Clearly, it
would be, “Objection, overruled. Not hearsay!”

...

Will Jose’s testimony then be admissible? It would be
admissible as long as the fact that Jose’s friend was alive on
August 5.is relevant to an issue of the case. If the evidence is
not allowed, it is not because of the hearsay rule but because
it did not meet the standards of relevance.
Let us repeat the question of the judge: “Counsel, what
is the purpose of Jose’s testimony that his friend wrote him
that ‘it was a street bum who shot the cop and not Jose’s
uncle?1 ” This time counsel emphatically declares: “To prove,
Your Honor, that it was not Jose’s uncle who shot the cop but
a bum!”
Should the judge sustain a hearsay objection? This time,
the judge should sustain the objection. The formula is now
complete. Jose’s testimony is hearsay. It is hearsay because
the out-of-court statement of Jose’s friend that “it was a street
bum who shot the cop and not Jose’s uncle” is offered to prove
the very matter asserted in the statement: that “it was a street
bum who shot the cop... etc... etc... etc...” The first response is
different. It is not hearsay because it was not offered to prove
the truth of the assertion in the letter of Jose’s friend. It was
offered to prove a different purpose.
1. Problems are rarely encountered as to the first
component. It is easy to know whether or not a statement
offered is out of court. When a witness testifies: “A policeman
told me that a car was stolen in Pedro’s driveway,” we can
immediately tell that the policeman’s statement was made out
of court. It is the witness who is in court, not the policeman.

CHAPTER VI -HEARSAY EVIDENCE, OPINION
EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
A. Preliminaries

319

Implied from an out-of-court statement is the fact that
the witness has no personal knowledge of the matter testified
to. It is someone outside the court and who, at the same time,
is not on the stand who has personal knowledge of the facts.
That someone outside the court cannot be questioned. His
perception cannot be tested. His capacity to remember what
he perceived cannot be accurately determined. Neither can his
capacity to communicate his remembered perceptions. Why?
Because he is not in court and, if he is not in court, he cannot
be cross-examined. If he cannot be cross-examined, who, in
his right mind, is willing to take his words at their face value?
Who can you find willing to believe his statements repeated
by the witness inside the courtroom? Remember Sec. 22, Rule
130 of the Rules of Court? Let us have a piece of it once more:
"A witness can .testify only to those facts which he or she knows
of his or her personal knowledge..." And what do the rules say
as to what “personal knowledge” is? Those "which are derived
from his or her own perception...”

2. Why must a witness testify only to matters of his or
her personal knowledge? The answer is clear. The witness’
credibility, accuracy of perception and recollection, can be
tested before the court through cross-examination. Those of
the out-of-court declarant cannot. The latter’s statements are,
therefore, unreliable. In the highfalutin terminology of the
academe, his statements lack the "indicia" of trustworthiness.
It is this lack of reliability which is the reason for the timehonored rule excluding hearsay testimony.
3. The issue often centers on the second component
of the hearsay formula and it is this second one which the
reader must set his sights on. In most hearsay problems,
the first component is always present. It is this part which
the mind easily grasps. Not the second. Sometimes, this
component approximates the abstract hiding itself from the
eyes of common mortals like us. It is concededly the more
controversial part of our supposedly practical rule. When this
part is absent, i.e., the out-of-court statement is not offered
to prove the truth of the matter asserted, it is said that the
statement is offered for a non-hearsay purpose. If it is offered

r
320

EVIDENCE

CHAPTER VI -HEARSAY EVIDENCE, OPINION
EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
A. Preliminaries

(The Bar Lectures Series)

to prove the truth of the statement, it is hearsay because it
is offered to prove a hearsay purpose. Where a statement is
not offered for the truth of the matter asserted but is offered
for an evidentiary purpose, not dependent on the truth of the
matters asserted, the statement is non-hearsay.

4. In a case, the only evidence the petitioners presented
to prove that the price of a round trip ticket between
Manila and Los Angeles at that time was only $856.00 is a
newspaper advertisement for another airline company. The
Court considered the advertisement inadmissible for being
“hearsay evidence, twice removed." It categorically ruled that
newspaper clippings are hearsay if they were offered for the
purpose of proving the truth of the matter alleged.
Quoting Feria v. Court of Appeals, 325 SCRA 525, the
Court explained:
“(N]ewspaper articles amount to “hearsay evidence,
twice removed’ and are therefore not only inadmissible
but without any probative value at all whether objected to
or not, unless offered for a purpose other than proving the
truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the news article
is admissible only as evidence that such publication does
exist with the tenor of the news therein stated” (citations
omitted).

The same rule applies to news articles published via the
broadcast media or the internet communications. They are
admissible only to prove that such broadcast exists with the
tenor of the news therein stated but not as to the truth of
their contents (Ocampo v. Enriquez, G.R. No. 225973, August
8,2017).
Examples of non-hearsay evidence
(a) A “statement having probative worth simply by
virtue of the fact that it was uttered, if relevant to a material

..

fact in issue, is not hearsay and is generally admissible .
Where a statement is not offered for the truth of the contents
of the conversation, but only to show that it was made, then

321

the statement is not hearsay. For example, a statement
that is offered to show its patent falsity, so as to suggest the
defendant’s consciousness of guilt, is not hearsay” (29 Am Jur
2d, 708).
(b) There are other kinds of out-of-court statements that
have been considered admissible because they were offered
for a non-hearsay purpose like statements relating to the state
of mind of the declarant and statements relating to the state
of mind of the listener. Words uttered, in this regard, merely
constitute circumstantial evidence of an assertion and where
the making of the statement is the significant fact because it
either gives rise to the inference about the declarant’s state
of mind or indicates its effect on the hearer. The truth of
the statement is not in issue here. A statement by an out-ofcourt declarant may be offered not for the veracity of what is
asserted but merely to impeach the declarant’s credibility. A
threat against a witness may be offered in evidence to show
its impact on the witness and where the reasonableness of a
person’s conduct is an issue, an out-of-court declaration may
be offered to explain the person’s reactions to the declaration
(U.S. v. Canieso, 470 F2d 1224 2d Cir. 1972; U.S. v. Monroe,
943 F 2d 1007, 9th Cir. 1991; U.S. v. Baird, 29 F.3d 647,
D.C. Cir. 1994; cited in Charles Wagner, FRE Case Law
Commentary, 533-535).
Out-of-court statements offered to prove mental state of the

declarant
1. As long as an out-of-court statement is offered for a
non-hearsay purpose (a purpose other than to prove the truth
of the matter asserted), the statement is admissible if it has
relevance to the matter in issue.

A popular example of an out-of-court statement offered
for a non-hearsay purpose is one which demonstrates by
inference from the tenor of the statement the state of mind
of the speaker or the declarant. Here, the significance of the
statement is not whether its assertion is true or false. Its
significance rests on the mere fact that it was uttered and, by

222

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

extension, on the conclusion which may reasonably be drawn
from the statement.
2. Let us assume we have a special proceeding in court.
Let us say, it is the probate of a testator’s will. Some heirs who
felt aggrieved by the dispositions in the will raised the issue
of the testator’s sanity. The will was purportedly executed on
January 3 of the previous year. A witness for the oppositors is
on the stand to testify on the testator’s alleged incapacity.
Q: How long have you known the testator?
A- For twenty (20) years by the time he died, Sir.
Q: How did you come to know him?
A- I was her nurse for twenty (20) years, Sir.
Q: On January 3, 2015, what did you hear the
testator say, if any?
Objection, Your Honor! Hearsay! (Opposing
counsel objects.)
Court: Not so fast, Panero. Witness may
answer!
A In the morning of January 3, he said, “I am
Joseph Stalin.” At around twelve high noon,
he told me, “I am Theodore Roosevelt.” Right
after the subscribing witnesses to his will left,
he brushed me aside and said. “They had no
idea I am Saddam Hussein.” When I served
him supper, he said, “Those fools! They didn’t
realize they just met Alexander the Great!”
Court: Objection, overruled!
Are the statements of the testator offered to prove the
truth of the assertions therein? Certainly not. Obviously, the
out-of-court statements of the testator are not offered to prove
that he is Joseph Stalin, Theodore Roosevelt, Saddam Hussein
and Alexander the Great rolled into one. They are offered for
a non-hearsay purpose, i.e., to prove by inference through the
statement that the testator, on the day the will was executed,
was incapacitated by reason of a mental condition.

EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE

323

From experience, we know that a person’s state of mind
may be revealed by his actions or statements. The declarant’s
words or conduct constitute circumstantial evidence of his
state of mind. In this case, it is not the truth or falsity of
the conduct or words which matter. It is the fact that the
statement was made which is relevant. A testimony by the
hearer that such statement was made is not hearsay. Why?
The hearer will be testifying as to his personal knowledge
that the statement was uttered. He may, therefore, be crossexamined as to what he heard, when it was heard, how it
was said, and the circumstances surrounding the making of
the statement. The hearer’s veracity and sincerity can well
be tested under a cross-examination because he will not be
testifying as to the veracity of the assertion or its falsity which
are totally irrelevant.
3. Statements relating to the state of mind of the
declarant is one of those admissible out-of-court statements if
offered for non-hearsay purposes (29 Am Jut 2d, 708, 709).

Out-of-court statement offered to prove its effect on the

listener/hearer
1. An out-of-court statement may be offered not only
to prove the state of mind of the declarant. It may also be
used to show the state of mind of the hearer or listener. This
state of mind of the listener is oftentimes described in terms of
the effect of the declarant’s statement on the hearer and why
the listener acted in a particular manner. As in our previous
illustration, the statement here, although out of court, is
presented not to prove the truth of the statement and, hence,
non-hearsay.

When the statement is not offered for the truth of the
matter asserted but is offered to show the mental effect of the
statement on the hearer, the statement is not hearsay (U.S. u.

Norwood, 798 F.2d 1094 [7th dr. I960]).
2. The next example is a prosecution for arbitrary
detention. The accused is a police officer who chanced upon
the crime scene and arrested the complainant after he was

EVIDENCE

fingered by a witness to the felony. He is on the stand to
testify on the circumstances surrounding the arrest. Let us
see whether or not a hearsay objection can be sustained.

Q: Sir, what were you doing on such and such
place?

A- I was on a routine patrol.
Q: What happened on such and such date and on
such and such time?

A I saw people milling around something in the
corner of ABC and XYZ Sts.
Q: What, if any, did you do?
A- I got out of my patrol car to see what was
happening.

Q: What, if any, did you see?

A I saw a man lying face downward on the side of
the street with blood all over his back.
Q: What happened next?

A A man whispered to me, “This happened barely
two minutes ago and that guy sitting there
pretending to be an onlooker is the culprit.”
Counsel: Objection, Your Honor, hearsay!
Court: Objection overruled!
The testimony, “This happened barely two minutes ago
and that guy sitting there pretending to be an onlooker is the
culprit,” is not offered to prove that (a) the incident occurred
two minutes ago, or (b) that the guy sitting and pretending
to be an onlooker was the culprit. The testimony is to prove
that an arrest was made as a consequence of the out-of-court
statement’s effect on the hearer. This effect was the reason for
the arrest. This effect is relevant to justify the apprehension
of the complaining witness.

“Words offered to prove the effect on the hearer are
admissible when they are offered to show their effect on one

whose conduct is at issue” (State v. Hernandez [App] 170
Arizona 301; 29 Am Jur 29, 710).
This is an important category of non-hearsay evidence
worth remembering. The statement offered in evidence is not
hearsay because it is the hearer's reaction to the statement
which is sought to be proved. It is his reaction to the statement
that is relevant, not the truth of the assertion in the statement.
Since the hearer is present in court, he can be cross-examined
on whether or not he heard the statement accurately, believed
the statement to be true, and whether or not he really acted in
conformity with his belief.
Out-of-court statement offered to prove that the statement
was made (Bar 2012)
1. Where the statement is not offered for the truth of
the matter asserted, but merely to show what was said, the
statement is not hearsay (Ries Biological, Inc. v. The Bank of
Santa Fe, 780 F.2d 888 [10th Cir. 1986]).
2. Here is another example. This time, it is a prosecution
for oral defamation where the following exchange took place
between the prosecutor and his witness:

Prosecutor:

What did you hear the accused say?

Defense:

Objection, Your Honor. Question calls for
hearsay testimony!

Court:

Not so fast! Witness may answer.

Witness:

The accused said while pointing to the
victim: “You are a thief! You stole my
money! You are a liar!”

Court:

Objection overruled!

Is the testimony of the witness excludable as hearsay?
It is not. The testimony is not hearsay. It is not offered to
prove that the complaining witness is a “thief’ or a “liar.” It
is offered to prove the tenor of the statement, i.e., that the
statement was made. What is significant is the making of the

r
g26

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

statement. Beyond the mere fact that the words were uttered,
the statement proves nothing as to its averments because
the out-of-court declaration’s relevance is independent of the
truth of its assertions. In a prosecution for defamation, an
important issue is whether or not the words constituting the
offense were uttered. There is no other inference required.
Once there is proof that the words were uttered, then the legal
consequences of the mere making of the statement will follow.
The only question remaining which is a subject matter best
for another story is: Does the accused have a defense?

3. “If an extrajudicial utterance is offered, not as an
assertion to prove the matter asserted but without reference
to the truth of the matter asserted, the hearsay rule does not
apply. For example, in a slander case, if a prosecution witness
testifies that he heard the accused say that the complainant
was a thief, this testimony is admissible not to prove that the
complainant was really a thief, but merely to show that the
accused uttered those words” (Patula v. People, 669 SCRA
135, 153, April 11, 2012).
Independently relevant statements (Bar 2003, 2009, 2011,
2018, 2019)

1. It is doctrinal that a declarant’s statement may have
relevance to an issue in a case from the mere fact that the
words were spoken or written, irrespective of the truth or
falsity of the assertion. This category of a non-hearsay outof-court statement, together with the previously discussed
categories, is commonly known in this jurisdiction under the
general term, “independently relevant statements." They are
called as such because the statements are admissible for some
relevant reason independent of their truth or falsity. They
are relevant because the statement itself is either the very
fact in issue or a circumstantial evidence of a fact in issue.
Some authorities call independent relevant statements as the
“operative acts” which give rise to legal consequences (29 Am
Jut 2d, 709).
2. An independently relevant statement is not hearsay
and is, therefore, not banned under the hearsay evidence rule.

CHAPTER VI -HEARSAY EVIDENCE, OPINION
EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
A. Preliminaries

327

Hence, a witness may be asked questions concerning what
the accused told him that other persons were involved in the
conspiracy if the purpose of the testimony is not to prove that
such persons were really involved in the conspiracy but only
to prove what the accused had mentioned (People v. Cusi, Jr.,
14 SCRA 944). If the purpose of the testimony is merely to
establish the fact that the statement was made, the hearsay
rule does not apply. Evidence as to the making of the statement
is a primary evidence where it is relevant to the existence of a
fact (See Espineli v. People, G.R. No. 179535, June 9, 2014).
If the testimony given by a witness in court regarding a
statement made by another person is offered for the purpose
of establishing the truth of the fact asserted, the testimony is
clearly hearsay. However, if the purpose is merely to establish
the fact that the statement, or the tenor of such statement,
was made, the testimony is not hearsay (People v. Umapas,
G.R. No. 215742, March 22, 2017).
Newspaper accounts of an incident are hearsay if offered
to prove the truth of the accounts but are not hearsay if offered
for a purpose other than the truth of the matter asserted. The
newspaper account is admissible only to prove that there was
a publication and merely the tenor of the news, but not its
truth (Feria v. Court of Appeals, 325 SCRA 525).
3. Independently relevant statements actually come in
various shapes and shades because of the different reasons
for which such statements are offered. They, however, have
a unifying element. That element is: Their relevance to the
matter in issue is not dependent on their truth or falsity.
Their relevance lies in the fact that they were said.
4. An out-of-court statement introduced in court to
impeach a previous witness is another form of independently
relevant statement, and an example of how an out-of-court
declaration may be used for a non-hearsay purpose.

A hypothetical will illustrate the point. Let us say, a
prosecution witness on the stand testified: “I saw with my
own eyes when the accused drew a pistol from his waist and

328

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

aimed it at the victim. I was there when he fired. I was there
when the victim fell to the ground. I was there when blood
flowed out of his blasted chest. I was there when the victim
gasped his last breath! I was there. I saw it all!” The witness,
whom we shall call Mr. A, is testifying not on the basis of what
another person saw. He is testifying on facts which he knows
of his own knowledge just what the Rules of Court says he
should. This is not hearsay and an objection on that ground
will have to be overruled.
However, without the witness knowing it, someone he
did not expect to be in the audience heard everything he said.
That someone could not believe what he just heard straight
from the witness’ mouth! Let us call him Mr. B. Tugging at
the shirt of the guy next to him, he exclaimed, ‘I know the
witness. He is a homegrown kid like me. We grew up together
in the same block. What he just told the court was not what he
told me a day after the killing!”
Our next scene is of Mr. B now sitting on the witness
stand. In the previous cross-examination of Mr. A, he denied
ever talking to Mr. B, who takes his oath, and after all those
predicates for the questions were laid, come the questions
from the defense counsel:
“Did you hear what Mr. A told this court about
what he said he saw on the day the victim was
killed?”
“Yes, sir,” comes the confident reply.
“What can you say about his testimony?”

“The things he said in court were not what he
told me about the incident!”
“What did he tell you?”

“Objection. Hearsay,” barks the prosecutor.

If the judge is awake, and judges are always
awake even if sometimes you think they are not, he
will ask before ruling on the objection, “What is the
purpose of your question, counsel?”

—

CHAPTER VI HEARSAY EVIDENCE, OPINION
EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
A. Preliminaries

329

“To show that Mr. A’s testimony is inconsistent
with what he told Mr. B one day after the incident,

Your Honor.”
“Objection overruled. Witness may answer.”

“Sir, he told me: I did not see with my own eyes
when the accused drew a pistol from his waist and
aimed it at the victim. I was not there when he fired.
I was not there when the victim fell to the ground. I
was not there... I was not there. I was somewhere.”

Of course, Mr. A’s supposedly eyewitness account is
important in the lawsuit. But there is something more
important than the credibility of the testimony. It is the
credibility of the witness himself. From the moment the
witness takes his oath on the stand, even before he utters
his first words on the stand, his credibility is automatically
put in issue. That the credibility of a witness is always an
issue in every litigation is a given. It is basic. Of course, a
testimony that attacks the credibility of the witness is
equally relevant especially when that witness claims to have
personal knowledge of the facts testified to. Prior out-ofcourt declarations of that same witness inconsistent with his
testimony on the stand are admissible not to prove the truth
of what was said.

In the example, the testimony of Mr. B on the declarations
of Mr. A was not introduced to prove that Mr. A did not indeed
witness the killing of the victim by the accused. Whether
or not the statement of Mr. A is true is irrelevant. What is
important is that the statements were uttered. Because they
were uttered, Mr. A had made inconsistent statements and
because he did, it is not now easy to believe Mr. A’s testimony.
He may have witnessed the incident. He may have not. We do
not know. We know one thing for sure: Mr. A’s credibility has
been impaired. In the language of the rules, Mr. A has been
“impeached."
5. The ban on hearsay evidence does not cover

which are relevant independently of whether they are true or
not. The case of Estrada v. Desierto, 356 SCRA 108, classifies
independently relevant statements into two:

The first class includes the following:
(a) statements which are the very facts in issue;
and
(b) statements which are circumstantial evidence
of the fact in issue.
The second class includes the following:

(a) statements of a person showing his state of
mind; that is, his mental condition, knowledge, belief,
intention, ill-will and other emotions;
(b) statements of a person which show his physical
condition, as illness and the like;

(c) statements of a person from which an inference
may be made as to the state of mind of another; that is
knowledge, belief, motive, good or bad faith, etc. of the

latter;
(d) statements which may identify the date, place,
person
and
in question; and

(e) statements showing the lack of credibility of a
witness.
Hearsay evidence in the determination of probable cause

Hearsay evidence is admissible in a preliminary
investigation. In other words, the evidence supporting
probable cause may even be based on hearsay. Citing the
ruling of the US Supreme Court in United States v. Ventresca,
380 U.S. 102, 107-108 (1965), our Supreme Court in Estrada
v. Office of the Ombudsman, G.R. Nos. 212140-41, January 21,
2015, wrote:
“While a warrant may issue only upon a finding of
“probable cause,” this Court has long held that “the term
‘probable cause’. .. means less than evidence which would

justify condemnation,” Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch
339, 11 U.S. 348, and that a finding of “probable cause"
may rest upon evidence which is not legally competent in
a criminal trial. Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307,
358 U.S. 311. As the Court stated in Brinegar v. United
States, 338 U.S. 160, 173, “There is a large difference
between the two things to be proved (guilt and probable
cause), as well as between the tribunals which determine
them, and therefore a like difference in the quanta and
modes of proof required to establish them.” Thus, hearsay
mav be the basis for issuance of the warrant “so long
[is] a substantial basis for crediting the
as there
hearsay.” Jones v. United States, supra, at 362 U.S. 272.
And, in Aguilar, we recognized that “an affidavit may
be based on hearsay information and need not reflect
the direct personal observations of the affiant,” so long
as the magistrate is “informed of some of the underlying
circumstances” supporting the affiant's conclusions and
his belief that any informant involved “whose identity
need not be disclosed .. .” was “credible” or his information
“rehable.” Aguilar v. Texas, supra, at 378 U.S. 114.”

...

That probable cause could be established with hearsay
evidence, as declared in Estrada v. Office of the Ombudsman,
was reiterated by the Court in a case of a more recent vintage.
The Court explained that hearsay evidence is admissible in
determining probable cause in a preliminary investigation
because such investigation is merely preliminary (De Lima
v. Guerrero, G.R. No. 229781, October 10, 2017). In this
connection, in De Lima v. Guerrero, the Court, had also the
occasion to explain that “ x x x the admissibility of evidence,
their evidentiary weight, probative value, and the credibility
of the witnesses are matters that are best left to be resolved
in a full blown trial, not during a preliminary investigation
where the technical rules of evidence are not applied nor at the

stage of the determination of probable cause for the issuance
of a warrant of arrest.”

B. Exceptions to the Hearsay Rule
1. The Rules of Court enumerates the following
exceptions to the hearsay rule:

(a) Dying declarations (Sec. 38, Rule 130);
(b) Statement of decedent or person of unsound
mind (Sec. 39, Rule 130);
(c) Declaration against interest (Sec. 40, Rule 130);

Jur 214). Declaration against interest, act or declaration
about pedigree, entries in the course of business, entries in
official records, commercial lists, and learned treatises are
examples of hearsay evidence where there exist a diminished
risk of untrustworthiness because the motivation to lie is
less. Some statements may be admissible where no other or
better evidence is available to prove an act, such that their
admissibility is predicated on a compelling necessity. A dying
declaration is admissible largely under this rationale.

(d) Act or declaration about pedigree (Sec. 41, Rule
130);

Dying declaration (Bar 2007, 2010, 2017, 2018)

(e) Family reputation or tradition regarding
pedigree (Sec. 42, Rule 130);

called “dying declaration” is described in Sec. 38 of Rule 130,

“SEC. 3S. Dying declaration. The declaration of
a dying person, made under the consciousness of an
Impending death, may be received in any case wherein
his or her death is the subject of inquiry, as evidence
of the cause and surrounding circumstances of such
death.”

(1) Testimony or deposition at a former proceeding

(m) Residual exception (Sec. 50, Rule 130).

2. It is not correct to assert that the exceptions to the
hearsay rule are not hearsay. They are hearsay evidence but
they are deemed admissible hearsay for certain reasons. Under
appropriate circumstances, a hearsay statement may possess
circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness sufficient to
justify non-production of the declarant in person (Advisory
Committee Notes to the Federal Rules of Evidence cited in 29
Am Jur 29, 726). Another justification may be simply dictated
by the necessity to admit an out-of-court statement (29A Am

2. While witnesses can only testify to facts derived
from their own perception, the testimony in open court by a
witness regarding a dying person’s declaration is recognized
as an exception to the rule against hearsay. It is considered
“an evidence of the highest order and is entitled to the utmost
credence since no person aware of his impending death would
make a careless and false accusation” (People v. Macaraig,
G.R. No. 219484, June 7, 201 7). An earlier pronouncement by
the Court declared that at the brink of death, all thoughts on
concocting lies disappear (People v. Cabtalan, 666 SCRA 174,
194-195, February 15, 2012).

3. The reasons for its admissibility are necessity and
trustworthiness. Necessity, because the declarant’s death
renders impossible his taking the witness stand, and it often
happens that there is no other equally satisfactory proof of
the crime; allowing it, therefore, prevents a failure of justice.

384

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

And trustworthiness, because the declaration is made in
extremity, when the party is at the point of death, when every
motive to falsehood is silenced and the mind is induced by
the most powerful considerations to speak the truth. The law
considers the point of death as a situation so solemn and awful
as creating an obligation equal to that which is imposed by an
oath administered in court (People v. Cerilla, 539 SCRA 251).

Why dying declarations are admissible is explained in
People v. Villariez, G.R. No, 211160, September 2, 2015:

“Statements identifying the assailant, if uttered
by a victim on the verge of death, are entitled to the
highest degree of credence and respect. Persons aware
of an impending death have been known to be genuinely
truthful in their words and extremely scrupulous in
their accusations. The dying declaration is given on the
premise that no one who knows of one’s impending death
will make a careless and false accusation x x x."
4. Courts, in the early days, anchored much of their
support for the dying declaration exception on the need to
uphold justice. Courts, at early common law, reasoned out
that the culprit would go free if the victim’s dying declarations
were excluded and it is in homicide cases where the necessity
for admission of a dying declaration is clear and pressing.
Thus, it is not difficult to understand why at common law,
the dying declaration exception was made available only
in homicide cases, a generic term which of course includes
murder and parricide. Nearly all courts, based upon the
theory of necessity, refused to recognize a dying declaration in

civil cases, or even in those criminal cases where homicide is
not an integral part of an offense (Ross v. Cooper, 38 N.D. 173,
164 N.W. 679; Winfrey v. State, 174 Ark. 729, 296 S.W.; Cited
in McCormick, Evidence, 831).
The Federal Rules, however, did not adhere to the
common law limitation on homicide cases. If the declarant
is unavailable as a witness, the statement made under a
consciousness of an impending death was admissible also in

CHAPTER VI -HEARSAY EVIDENCE, OPINION
EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
B. Exceptions to the Hearsay Rule

336

a civil case where there is an issue concerning the cause or
circumstances of such death (FRE, 804b).
5. A similar rule confining admissibility to criminal
cases prevailed in our jurisdiction until the changes in our
Rules on Evidence in 1989 allowed the use of dying declarations
in non-criminal cases.

As presently worded, Sec. 38 of Rule 130 provides that the
declaration of a dying person, made under the consciousness
of an impending death, may be received in any case wherein
his or her death is the subject of inquiry, as evidence of the
cause and surrounding circumstances of such death (See also
Remedial Law Compendium, Volume II, Regalado, 2008 Ed.,
p. 781).

In doing so, the Rules of Court no longer places any
limitation on the type of action in which a dying declaration
may be introduced. As long as the relevance is clear, a dying
declaration may now be introduced in a criminal or a civil
action and the requirement of relevance is satisfied where
the subject of inquiry is the death of the declarant himself. A
dying declaration does not only apply to a criminal case but
to “any case’’ wherein the death of the victim is the subject of
inquiry.
6. Any objection to a dying declaration may be premised
on any of the requisites for its admissibility embodied in Sec.
38 of Rule 130. Thus, counsel who wants a dying declaration
excluded must have to deal with the primary question of
whether or not the evidentiary foundations for the introduction
of a dying declaration were met.

The basic objection to a dying declaration is expressed
in the words, “Objection, Your Honor. There is no foundation
for the declaration.” Some would prefer, “Objection, no basis.”
Others would say, “Objection, predicate not laid.” Whatever
the lawyer’s preference is, the message is the same: The
proponent has not established the essential elements of a
dying declaration; hence, the objection. The objecting counsel
must, however, specify the reason for the lack of a foundation

336

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

requirement. Thus, counsel would say, “Objection. No
foundation. Declarant was not under the consciousness of an
impending death.”

7. When the prosecutor attempts to introduce a dying
declaration, the very first question that the defense should
ask is whether or not the declarant, at the time the statement
was made, knew or believed that he was going to die. When?
Not next week. Not next month. Not next year. But very soon
or now! This constitutes the objector’s first line of defense.
Section 38 of Rule 130 has an eye-catching name for this
knowledge or belief. It calls it “consciousness of an impending
death.”

Under the rules, it is evident that a mere consciousness
of death is not enough because everyone of us, at one time
or another, has become conscious of death. The kind of death
which the declarant should be conscious of is a death that
is impending. The declarant must be conscious that death
is near and certain, that “death is near at hand, and what
is said must have been spoken in the hush of its impending
presence.”

To admit a dying declaration in evidence, it must be
shown that the declarant believed, at the time the statement
was made, that he was in a dying condition and had given up
the hope of surviving (People v. Brioso, 37 SCRA 336; People
v. De Garcia, 18 SCRA 197).
8. A central question that is frequently asked is one
concerning the kind of facts which would lead to an inference
that the declarant was conscious of his impending death.
Do we arrive at this inference solely from the words of the
declarant himself? May it be established by other means?

Authorities are in agreement that, apart from the
statements of the declarant, consciousness of an impending
death may be established by other circumstances, such as the
nature of the injury and the conduct of the declarant. In any
event, it is conceded that the attendant circumstances should
be carefully weighed in determining the consciousness of the

CHAPTER VI

—

EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
B. Exceptions to the Hearsay Rule

337

impending death and the sincerity of such belief (29A Am
Jur 2d 219, 220). The declarant’s belief that he is going to
die soon may be shown circumstantially by the obvious fatal
quality of the wound, by the statements made to the victim by
the physician that his condition is hopeless, or by some other
circumstances (People v. Silang Cruz, 53 Phil. 636; People v.
Chan Lin Watt, 50 Phil. 182).
A witness, for example, testifies:
‘When I arrived at the scene, I saw the victim lying
on his back in the sidewalk. He was lying in a pool of
his own blood. I rushed to pick him up. I told him that
I am calling an ambulance to take him to the hospital.
He asked me to call a priest. “I need... Fr. Ho... need...
extreme unction,” he said in heavily, labored breathing.
Then, with one last breath, he said, “Chito... Chito...
stabbed me!” He expired."

The example speaks clearly of the declarant’s knowledge
of his impending death. The need for a priest to administer
the last rites of a particular religion allows us to infer that
the declarant believed his end is near. Thus, the declarant’s
belief that death is impending may be deduced from all the
surrounding circumstances such as his physical condition,
conduct and statements, and it is not necessary for the
admission of a dying declaration to prove that the declarant
should state that he is giving up the hope of life. It is enough
if, from the circumstances, it can be inferred with certainty
that such must have been his state of mind (People u. Chan
Lin Watt, 50 Phil. 182).
9. The following hypothetical of a testimony by a doctor
responding to a 911 call by the victim himself may indicate a
consciousness that death is certain to come soon:
“I hurriedly went up the stairs. I kicked the door
open. I saw the victim in a dreadful condition. Blood was
all over his chest and stomach area. He was clutching
with his right hand what seemed at first to me were
his intestines. I looked closely and they were! Blood

838

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

was gushing too from his forehead, from his ears, from
his nostrils and from his mouth. He was losing blood as
quickly as a drum of water blasted by a grenade and a
dozen shotguns. What a horrible sight! Then, from his
bloody lips came the words as I knelt down to help him,
‘Chito... he shot... me... he shot me!' A few seconds after,
he died."

10. Now, let us assume that the declaration of the
deceased was made under the consciousness of an impending
death. Let us also assume that the witness died immediately
after uttering his last words and these words were: “I do
not know... I do not know... the one who stabbed me.” The
declarant then expired. May these words be admitted to favor
the accused? Such words may be admitted. There is nothing in
the rules which prohibits the admission of a dying declaration
that is favorable to the accused.
Certainly, the interest of the State in convicting an
accused is as strong as its interest in acquitting a man falsely
and erroneously charged. The Supreme Court had long
recognized the rule that dying declarations, which exculpate
or exonerate an accused, may be introduced by him and are
admissible in his favor.

The early case of U.S. v. Antipolo, 37 Phil. 726, affirms
that dying declarations are admissible in favor of the accused
as well as against him (Citing Mattox v. U.S., 146 U.S. 140).
Thus, a dying declaration which avers that the firearm that
injured the declarant was not discharged on purpose but
only accidentally, is admissible to prove the innocence of the
accused (See U.S. v. Clemente, 22 Phil. 277). All facts relating
to the cause of death are admissible whether the same are
in favor of or against the accused (Regalado, Remedial Law
Compendium, Vol. II, 2004 Ed., p. 741).

Another case which illustrates this principle particularly
well is People v. Martinez, 42 Phil. 85. In this case, two of
the suspects were presented to the declarant before the latter
expired. In the presence of the justice of the peace, the mortally
wounded man declared that they were not the perpetrators

339

and authors of his wound. When, however, the third suspect
was presented to him, he pointed to the accused and said:

“This is the man who wounded me.” The declaration was held
admissible and considered in favor of the first two suspects.

It has been ruled that it would be unfair to restrict the
use of dying declarations by the prosecution. It is well-settled
that it will also be received on behalf of the defendant (Mattox
v. U.S., 146 U.S. 140, 151).
11. The requirement that a dying declaration must
relate to the cause and the circumstances surrounding the
declarant’s death may be a source for counsel’s objection to the
admission of the declaration. This requirement is an essential
part of the evidentiary foundation for a dying declaration
and where the statement sought to be introduced by the
prosecution is on a matter other than the cause of death of
the declarant, the required foundation for its admissibility
cannot be laid. An objection timely interposed will most likely
be sustained.
Suppose that a man collapses on your front door, blood
oozing from his back where a knife is prominently planted.
You rush to help him and you notice the poor, hapless guy is
your next-door neighbor, Candido. You have long wanted to
ask him whether or not he had something to do with the death
of Calixto, another neighbor, six months ago. As he lay dying
in your arms, you ask him the question and, in a weak voice,
he whispers: ‘It was not me... it was Frank Santos." In a couple
of seconds, he dies. Is the decedent’s statement admissible as
a dying declaration in a prosecution against Frank Santos for
the death of another neighbor? Of course, the answer should
be ‘No.’ It should be ‘no’ because the declaration was neither
about the cause nor the circumstances of the declarant’s
death. It is not admissible because the subject of the inquiry
is the death of someone else.
12. Let us take a similar, but slightly different, example
using the same characters. Let us say that before expiring,
Candido declares: “Joaquin stabbed me...!" Haltingly and
between gasps, he states he and Joaquin had been robbing

EVIDENCE

tourists in the area for the past twelve (12) months, that a
couple of hours ago they robbed a tourist of his money worth
$5,000.00, that there was an argument between them while
dividing the loot, and that, as a consequence, Joaquin stabbed
him in the back. Despite his weakened state, he also states
that he and Joaquin were also responsible for robbing the
convenience store at the street comer the day before.

stabbed him. At the time of his statement, the deceased
was conscious of his impending death, having sustained a
stab wound in the chest and experiencing great difficulty in
breathing. The deceased succumbed in the hospital emergency
room a few minutes from admission, which occurred under
three hours after the stabbing. The Court held that there is
ample authority for the view that the declarant’s belief in
the imminence of his death can be shown by the declarant’s
own statements or from circumstantial evidence, such as the
nature of his wounds, statements made in his presence, or by
the opinion of his physician. Besides, the deceased would have
been competent to testify on the subject of the declaration
had he survived (People u. Salafranca, 666 SCRA 501, 512,

Would the other declarations aside from “Joaquin
stabbed me...!” be admissible as a dying declaration? While the
declaration that he was stabbed because of an argument while
dividing the loot may be argued to be part of the circumstances
surrounding the declarant’s death, other portions of the
declaration, like the admission that he and Joaquin had been
robbing tourists in the past and that they recently robbed
a convenience store, do not come within the purview of the
exception. They are distinct matters not related to the killing
of the declarant.
Elements of a dying declaration (Bar 1985, 1991)

1. The Court, in People u. Gatarin, G.R. No. 198022,
April 7, 2014 and People v. Badillos, G.R. No. 215732, June 6,
2018, accurately enumerate the following elements of a dying
declaration, namely:
(a) the declaration concerns the cause and the
surrounding circumstances of the declarants’ death;

(b) it is made when death appears to be imminent
and the declarant is under a consciousness of an
impending death;
(c) the declarant would have been competent to
testify had he or she survived; and
(d) the dying declaration is offered in a case in
which the subject of inquiry involves the declarant’s

death.
2. In a prosecution for murder, the records show that
the deceased communicated his ante mortem statement
to another, identifying the accused as the person who had

341

February 22, 2012).

If the deceased made declarations before his demise, “It
is the belief in impending death and not the rapid succession
of death in point of fact that renders a dying declaration
admissible. The test is whether the declarant has abandoned
all hopes of survival and looked on death as certainly
impending” (People v. Gatarin, G.R. No. 198022. April 7,
2014).

However, even if the utterances of the victim could not be
appreciated as a dying declaration, his statements may still
be appreciated as part of the res gestae (Ibid.), which refers to
spontaneous statements made immediately prior to, while a
startling occurrence is taking place or immediately after such
occurrence. Since the statements are contemporaneous with
the startling event, deliberation and fabrication are ruled out
and, thus, deemed reliable.
Assailing a dying declaration

1. Although jurisprudentialfy considered as evidence
of the highest order, it is submitted that the admissibility of
a dying declaration, like any admissible evidence, does not
create a conclusive presumptkin of credibility of the admitted
declaration. No evidentiary rule grants a dying declaration
a favored status in the hierarchy of evidence. Like any other

342

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

CHAPTER VI

EVIDENCE. AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE

343

B. Exceptions to the Hearsay Rule

evidence, the declaration may be attacked in the same manner
as one would do to a testimony in open court. The declarant
himself may be impeached through the normal methods
provided for under the rules. For instance, the objector may
show that prior to the admitted declaration, the declarant had
previously made a statement inconsistent with his supposedly

“dying declaration.”

When the declarant, for example, stated that he was
attacked while he was lying on the bed but, on another
occasion, declared that he was attacked while lying on the
bench, a disturbing conflict exists between the two statements
specially when the alleged dying declarations are not in
accordance with the actual physical facts (People v. Bingaan,
48Ph.il. 926).

The objecting counsel may also demonstrate that the
declarant has no personal knowledge of the identity of the
assailant. Hence, a declarant's statement that another person
told him who hacked him in the back with a bolo would not
qualify for the dying declaration exception. It would not
qualify because the statement is plain and simple hearsay.
It may also be pointed out that the declarant would not
have been a competent witness even if he had survived. This
competence is vital to the admissibility of a dying declaration.
Competence is affected where the declarant had no opportunity
to see the assailant. The declaration must identify the
assailant; otherwise, it loses its significance (People u. Ador,
432 SCRA I; Geraldo v. People, 571 SCRA 420).
2. The ways by which the credibility of the declaration
and the declarant may be assailed are as varied as the
particular circumstances of the case. Knowing them is largely
a matter of logic and not necessarily of law.

Counsel may, for example, demonstrate that the
declarant, at the time of his declaration, was in an irrational
state because he was under the influence of large doses of
sedatives administered in the hospital. While there are judges
who are influenced by the theory that when a person is at

the point of death, one is induced to speak the truth, these
same judges may be swayed by evidence to the contrary.
So where the objector succeeds in showing that there are
incontrovertible facts that tend to prove that the declarant
could not have been influenced by the desire to tell the truth,
such as when his words show that his motive was vengeance
or revenge, the declaration loses weight.

Courts have to apply to dying declarations the same rules
applied in testing the credibility of testimony of a witness in
court. No law allows them to use a different criterion. One
may even question the competency of the declarant himself
who, like any other witness, may also be impeached. If the
declarant is incompetent under the rules if he were to appear
in court and in person, he would also be incompetent as a dying
declarant. Thus, if a court would adjudge him incompetent
because of his insanity if he were alive, there is no reason
to consider him sane as a dying declarant. It is a matter of
common sense to know that one who is insane does not become
sane because of an utterance made under consciousness of
an impending death. A dying declaration, as an exception to
the hearsay rule, is not meant to confer competency on an
otherwise incompetent witness. Thus, where the declarant
is publicly known to be untruthful in his words and conduct,
the credibility of his declaration at the point of death may
adversely be affected and he does not, by a sudden twist of
circumstance, become immaculate because of his having made
a dying declaration.
The credibility or trustworthiness of those who have
allegedly heard or taken down the dying declaration and the
form and manner by which the declaration was taken are vital
points to be considered by an objector who desires to water
down the effects of a dying declaration. Where it is shown that
the persons from the prosecution were the ones who squeezed
out the dying declaration from the lips of a weakened declarant
through questions calculated to bring out a desired response,
a conscientious counsel may bring this matter up in court.

Statement of decedent or person of unsound mind
1. The old Rules contained what was more popularly
referred to as the Dead Man’s Statute which prohibited
testimony as to any matter of fact occurring before the death
of a deceased person or before such person became of unsound
mind when the witness is a party or assignor of a party to a
suit upon a claim against the estate of said deceased or person
of unsound mind, to wit:

such person of unsound mind, cannot testify as to
any matter of fact occurring before the death of such

However, if the statement was made under circumstances
indicating its lack of trustworthiness, it is inadmissible.

The above provision was deleted and transposed to Sec.

Statute was criticized "because in seeking to avoid injustice
to the dead it may cause injustice to the living. If a survivor
has rendered services, furnished goods or lent money to a man
whom he trusted, without an outside witness or admissible
written evidence, he is helpless if the other dies and the
representative of his estate declines to pay. The survivor’s
mouth may even be closed in an action arising from a fatal
automobile collision, or in a suit upon a note or an account
which the survivor paid in cash without taking a receipt
(McCormick on Evidence, 159-160). xxx Many states have
swept away the disqualification entirely and their evidence
rules now permit the survivor to testify without restriction.
In order, however, to minimize the danger of injustice to the
decedent’s estate, their rules render admissible any writings
of the deceased or evidence of oral statements made by him,
which would ordinarily be excluded as hearsay.”
Part of the res gestae (Bar 2007)

1. The term res gestae is an old word which literally
means, things done, and was originally used by the courts in
the other side of the world in the early 1800s to create hearsay
exceptions whenever it was difficult to justify the admission of
a piece of hearsay evidence at a time when the hearsay theory
was far from being a developed concept in the law of evidence.
2. The term res gestae has been defined as “those
circumstances which are the undesigned incidents of a

particular litigated act and which are admissible when
illustrative of such act. In a general way, res gestae refers
to the circumstances, facts, and declarations that grow out
of the main fact and serve to illustrate its character and are
so spontaneous and contemporaneous with the main fact
as
to exclude the idea of deliberation and fabrication. The rule
on res gestae encompasses the exclamations and
made by either the participants, victims, or spectators to a
crime immediately before, during, or immediately after the
commission of the crime when the circumstances are such
that the statements were made as a spontaneous reaction
or utterance inspired by the excitement of the occasion and
there was no opportunity for the declarant to deliberate
and fabricate a false statement. The test of admissibility of
evidence as a part of the res gestae is, therefore, whether the
act, declaration, exclamation is so intimately interwoven or
connected with the principal fact or event that it characterizes
as to be regarded as a part of the transaction itself, and also
whether it clearly negatives any premeditation or purpose to
manufacture testimony” (People v. Villarico, Sr., 647 SCRA
43, 58, April 4, 2011; People v. Salafranca, 666 SCRA 501,
514, February 22, 2012; People v. Lupac, G.R. No. 182230,

statements

3. Suppose a guy casually strolling in a park was
suddenly clubbed by a man from behind. The hapless guy’s
head was split open by the blow. He died almost instantly. He
didn’t have the chance to speak. An elderly lady, the witness
to the event, let out a high-pitched shriek and while pointing
at a man in a white shirt, screamed, “He did it... he did it... he
hit him! Let us assume that the elderly lady is nowhere to be
found but someone heard her utter those words, her statement
may, nevertheless, be admissible under
the res gestae doctrine
as a description of the event itself speaking through the words
of the lady.
4, The concept of
res gestae is still recognized in the
laws on evidence of many
states but the term itself is no
longer used m many jurisdictions
279).
(29A

Am Jut 29 278,

347

The use of the term has fallen out of favor and acts, formerly
called parts of the res gestae, are now designated by specific
names. The Federal Rules of Evidence, for instance, makes
no reference to res gestae but recognizes as exceptions to
the hearsay rule in Rule 803 thereof, certain evidentiary
rules like ‘excited utterances,’ ‘present sense impression,’
‘statements of then existing mental or emotional physical
condition,’ and ‘statements made for purposes of medical
diagnosis or treatment.’ The Evidence Code of California
makes no mention either of the term and uses, instead,
phrases like ‘spontaneous statements’ and ‘contemporaneous
statements’ (Secs. 1240-1241). All these are concepts derived
from the original res gestae doctrine. These concepts now have
their own designated names and are recognized as distinct
exceptions with identities of their own.
Res gestae under the Rules of Court

1. The res gestae doctrine in our jurisdiction is embodied
in Sec. 44, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court:
“SEC. 44. Part of the res gestae. — Statements
made by a person while a startling occurrence is taking
place or immediately prior or subsequent thereto, under
the stress of excitement caused bv the occurrence with
respect to the circumstances thereof, may be given in
evidence as part of the res gestae. So, also, statements
accompanying an equivocal act material to the issue,
and giving it a legal significance, may be received as
part of the res gestae"

2. It can be observed that the use of res gestae in
the Philippines is limited to two matters: (1) spontaneous
statements and (2) verbal acts. While the term remains in the
rules, its application is restrictive and no other statement, act
or evidence may qualify as part of the res gestae.

It has been held that in spontaneous exclamations or
statements, the res gestae is the startling occurrence, whereas
in verbal acts, the res gestae are the statements accompanying
the equivocal act (Talidano v, Falcom Maritime & Allied
Services, Inc., 558 SCRA 279).

1

EVIDENCE

348

(The Bar Lectures Series)

A. Spontaneous statements
1. Spontaneous statements (spontaneous exclamations
or excited utterances), to be admitted in evidence, must have
the following characteristics:
(a) There is a startling event or occurrence taking
place;
(b) A statement was made while the event is taking
place, or immediately prior to, or subsequent thereto;
(c) The statement was made before the declarant
had the time to contrive or devise a falsehood (Ibid.); and
(d) The statement relates to the circumstances
of the startling event or occurrence (Sec. 44, Rule 130,
Rules of Court), or that the statements must concern
the occurrence in question and its immediate attending
circumstances (Ibid.; People v. Salafranca, 666 SCRA
501, 513, February 22, 2012; People v. Lupac, G.R. No.
182230, September 19, 2012; People v. Calinawan, G.R.
No. 226145, February 13, 2017).

When all these conditions are met, we have a spontaneous
statement constituting an exception to the rule barring
hearsay statements. Even if the declarant is unavailable and,
thus, cannot be cross-examined, the evidence may be received

in evidence.

The requisites were met in one case where the victim
went to her aunt’s house immediately after escaping from
the crime scene and spontaneously, unhesitatingly and
immediately declared to her that the accused had sexually
abused her. Such manner of denunciation of him as her rapist
was confirmed by the aunt’s testimony about the victim’s
panic-stricken demeanor and her use of words sufficiently
indicating her being raped (People v. Lupac, G.R. No. 182230,
September 19, 2012).

In another case, the requisites for admissibility of a
declaration as part of the res gestae were said to be met. When
the deceased gave the identity of his assailant to another, he

CHAPTER VI -HEARSAY EVIDENCE, OPINION
EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
B. Exceptions to the Hearsay Rule

349

was referring to a startling occurrence, i.e., his stabbing by
the accused. The victim was then on board the taxicab that
would bring him to the hospital and, thus, had no time to
contrive his identification of the accused as the assailant. His
utterance about the accused having stabbed him was made in
spontaneity and only in reaction to the startling occurrence.
The statement was relevant because it identified the accused
as the perpetrator (People u. Salafranca, 666 SCRA 501, 513,
February 22, 2012).
Basis of admissibility
1. The admissibility of a spontaneous statement is
anchored on the theory that the statement was uttered under
circumstances where the opportunity to fabricate is absent.
The statement is a reflex action rather than a deliberate act,
instinctive rather than deliberate. Thus, the declaration was
made under conditions suggestive of the truth. Accordingly,
the basis for the excited utterance exception to the hearsay
rule is that the perceived event produces nervous excitement,
making fabrications about that event unlikely (Morgan u
Foretich, Ca 4 Va, 846 F2d 941, cited in 29 Am Jur 29 865).
2. The justification for the excited utterance exception
is that a spontaneous declaration of an individual who has
recently suffered an overpowering and shocking experience
is likely to be truthful (Commonwealth v. Blackwell, 343 Pa

Super 201).

The earlier example of the elderly lady who screamed
while pointing at the man who clubbed the guy in the park
from behind, illustrates a spontaneous statement clearly
well. First, the clubbing of the guy from behind by the culprit
would obviously qualify as a startling event or occurrence.
Second, a statement was made immediately before, during or
immediately subsequent to the startling event or occurrence.
In fact, the lady made a screaming statement at the time
the guy was being clubbed. Third, the statement made must
refer to the circumstances of the event. The lady’s cry, as she
pointed to the culprit, fits this element squarely.

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

3. In the “spontaneous statement” part of the res
gestae, common reason suggests that the statement and
the event cannot be taken separately. The statement alone,
without the event, will not qualify for admission because the
circumstances surrounding the making of the statement make
said statement admissible. The res gestae is the startling event
or occurrence and the statement is a part of that res gestae.
The circumstances stamp on the statement a character of
reliability on the theory that it is almost impossible to lie in an
excited state. It has, thus, been said that the spontaneity of the
utterance is the guaranty of its trustworthiness. The principle
rests upon common experience that utterances made under
such circumstances are devoid of self-interest and are in the
same category as exclamations. The probability of falsehood is
too remote as to be negligible (People u Ricaplaza, 23 SCRA
374; People v. Ner, 28 SCRA 1151; People v. Gondayao, 30
SCRA 226).

CHAPTER VI -HEARSAY EVIDENCE, OPINION

351

EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
B. Exceptions to the Hearsay Rule

becomes apparent that the event is not as startling as that
required by the rules.
But, suppose the court rules that the event can qualify as
startling? Simple. Back off and proceed to the next element of
the foundation. If the excited utterance was made immediately
before or while the startling event was taking place, you may
have a tough time in your hands. It is likely that the statement
will be ruled as admissible.

1. A counsel who intends to object to the presentation
of a spontaneous statement as evidence needs to analyze
the evidence sought to be admitted by strictly weighing
it according to the standards set by Sec. 44 of Rule 130.
Remember that the proponent of the evidence must sustain
the burden of proving the preliminary facts that would support
the foundational elements for the admissibility of the alleged
spontaneous statement. It is the duty of counsel to subject
each foundational element to a very rigid scrutiny.

2. There are times though that a declaration is not
made simultaneously with the event but made sometime
after. This is a break for opposing counsel who must zero in
on the time interval between the event and the making of the
statement. We have to concede that there has been no clear
standard formulated so far as to when a statement made after
the event is one made under the influence of that event. There
is no mathematical formula for this. Everything hinges on
the unique and particular circumstances of each case. Hence,
the determination as to the spontaneity of the utterance is
a matter of judicial discretion. It is, however, this matter of
judicial discretion which presents a window of opportunity to
an analytical, opposing counsel. For example, he may argue
and show that the facts disclose that the statement was made
without the declarant exhibiting any sign of excitement or
spontaneity, that the statement was made in a cool, relaxed
manner coupled with a calm facial expression. If so, then the
guarantee of the statement’s reliability is lost. The statement
may no longer be admissible.

For instance, one initial point which counsel needs to
consider is whether or not the event or occurrence is indeed
a startling one. This is because the res gestae is the startling
event of which the spontaneous statement is only a part of.
Since the declarant is supposed to have made a statement
under the influence of the occurrence, the event must be of
such a nature as to cause an excited reaction in an average
individual. If the event in itself is not sufficient to disturb the
emotional and mental equilibrium of the average, reasonable
person, then raise this issue with the court as soon as it

3. What if the court, however, rules the statement to
have been made while under the influence of the startling
event? What if, after the occurrence, the evidence shows the
declarant to be obviously still in a state of excitement and
perhaps, shock? When this happens, the fight would no longer
be on the ground of admissibility of the declaration. The
battle though has not yet been lost. The battleground has just
shifted. To where? Answer: The matter of credibility! The court
of course knows, as everyone does, that one does not have to
be a psychiatrist or a psychologist to know that perceptions,

Objections to admissibility

observations and statements are clouded by strong emotion
Argue that there is a reason to distrust a statement made
under emotional stress. There may have been no desire to lie on
the declarant’s part but does the statement accurately reflect
what truly and actually happened? What if the excitement
of the declarant impaired his power of observation? Let the
judge rule. Let him weigh the merits of your opposition but do
not surrender an inch of ground without a fight!
4. Now, let us go back to the issue of admissibility
of the statement. So the court ruled there was a startling
occurrence or event, let us say, a car collision. It also declared
that the statement was made simultaneously with the event
and such statement was made spontaneously. The declarant
made the statement at that precise moment when the accident

injuries may be considered the “incident” speaking through
the victim. While it may not qualify as a dying declaration,
it may, nonetheless, be admitted in evidence as part of the
res gestae. A declaration made spontaneously after a startling
occurrence is deemed as part of the res gestae when: (1) the
principal act, the res gestae, is a startling occurrence; (2)
the statements were made before the declarant had time to
contrive or devise a falsehood; and (3) the statements concern
the occurrence in question and its immediately attending
circumstances (People v. Santillan, G.R. No. 227878, August
9, 2017; See People v. Badillos, G.R. No. 215732, June 6, 2018).

(The Bar Lectures Series)

happened. She was very excited and evidently under the spell
of the event. What then? Is the statement now admissible
as an exception to the hearsay rule? Not yet. But why?
The statement is not yet admissible because we still do not
know the tenor and the content of the statement! Not every
statement made under the influence of the startling event is
admissible even if it be spontaneous. This is the rule. It is a
rule that cannot be overlooked by any objecting counsel. The
only spontaneous statement made under stress of excitement
of the startling event that qualifies for admissibility is one that
relates to the circumstances of the event. In short-cut lingo,
the statement must describe the event perceived. Suppose the
declarant was said to have uttered when the collision occurred:
“My Lord, that one looks like my son’s car!” The statement is
not a description of the event. If it is not, it does not qualify
as part of the res gestae. It it does not, it is not admissible as
exception to the hearsay rule. Section 44 of Rule 130 requires
that the statement be with respect to the circumstances of the
startling occurrence. (Bar 2005, 2019)
5. A declaration by a deceased person concerning the
circumstances of his death may not be considered a dying
declaration if it cannot be established that he uttered his
statement while conscious of his impending death but the
utterance of the victim made immediately after sustaining

353

6. If there is no showing in the records that the victim
under
a consciousness of an impending death at the time
was
of his declaration that the accused was the one who shot him,
the same is not admissible as a dying declaration but, because
it was made shortly after a startling occurrence and under the
influence thereof, it is, nonetheless, admissible as part of the
res gestae (People v. Espina, 361 SCRA 701).

B. Verbal acts (Bar 2011)
1. The last sentence of Sec. 44 of Rule 130 defines a
verbal act as “statements accompanying an equivocal act
material to the issue, and giving it a legal significance."A verbal
act presupposes a conduct that is equivocal or ambiguous,
one which, in itself, does not signify anything when taken
separately. It only acquires a meaning, specifically what the
rules call a legal significance, only because of the statements
that accompany the act. It is the statement contemporaneous
with the act that identifies or indicates the character, purpose
or motive of the act.

To be admissible under this category, the following
requisites must be present:
(a) the principal act to be characterized must be
equivocal;
(b) the equivocal act must be material to the issue;
(c) the statement must accompany the equivocal

act; and

364

EVIDENCE

(The Bar Lectures Series)

(d) the statement gives a legal significance to the
equivocal act (Talidano o. Falcom Maritime & Allied
Services, Inc., 558 SCRA 279).

Suppose that a witness testifies on the stand for the
plaintiff in a collection case where defendant denies having
borrowed PIO,000.00 from the plaintiff. The debt is not
evidenced by a promissory note because plaintiff claims that
defendant had orally borrowed money from him in the past
and had always paid. This time, he refuses to pay. The witness
testifies that one year ago, he saw the plaintiff give money
to the defendant. There is no hearsay problem at this point
because the witness is testifying to what he actually saw. He
has a personal knowledge of the transaction, Le., the act of
the plaintiff handing money to the defendant. The act of the
plaintiff, however, taken in itself, has no legal significance
because it is an equivocal act. It is ambiguous. Is the money
intended as a bribe? Is it a payment for a debt? Is it a gift? Or
is it a loan extended by the plaintiff to the defendant? We do
not know. We still do not know what to make of that money
delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant so the attorney asks
the witness:

Illustration:
Q: Mr. Witness, did you testify that you saw the
plaintiff give money to the defendant?
A: I did, Sir.
Q: What, if any, did anybody say at the time the
money was handed over by the plaintiff to the

defendant?

As the plaintiff handed the money, he said
to the defendant: “This is the P10,000 you told
me you were borrowing from me.”
Q: What did the defendant say, if any?

A: The defendant said, “Thank you. I’ll pay you
after a year.”

CHAPTER VI

—

HEARSAY EVIDENCE, OPINION
EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
B. Exceptions to the Hearsay Rule

365

Forget what the defendant said. Focus on what the
plaintiff said instead. What he saidis an out-of-court statement.
There is no doubt about that. The statement is offered to
explain the conduct of the plaintiff. With his statement, the
act of the plaintiff acquires a legal significance. The money is
not intended as a bribe, a gift, or a payment of a debt. It is a
loan by the plaintiff to the defendant.
Now, focus on the statement of the defendant. The
act of receiving money in itself has no definite meaning or
significance. When, however, the defendant answered: "Thank
you. I’ll pay you after a year,” the act of receiving the money
now acquires a legal significance. A contract of loan has just
been perfected. It is now evident, therefore, that the defendant
is the debtor of the plaintiff for P10,000.00. He is a debtor
because this is what the acts of the plaintiff and defendant
point to, as explained by the utterances contemporaneous to
such acts. Now, the witness is testifying to that out-of-court
statement and it is offered to prove the truth of that statement,
that the money handed over is a loan to the defendant. It is
hearsay, but it is an admissible hearsay as part of the res
gestae.
2. Objections to the admissibility of verbal acts depend
upon whether or not the proponent has established the
foundations for admissibility. The objector has to consider the
following questions:
(a) Is there an act that is equivocal or ambiguous?
If the act is clear, it needs no explanation and so there is
no res gestae to speak of. The act of swinging a baseball
bat at the victim in a physical injuries case is not
equivocal and need not be explained by any statement to
understand the nature of the act. The bat was swung to
cause injuries to the victim.

(b) Will the statement accompanying the
ambiguous or equivocal act explain the act or give legal
significance to it? If it will not, then the statement is not
admissible. Thus, the statement, “I will hit you with this”
as he swung the bat at the victim, does not explain the

EVIDENCE

366

(The Bar Lectures Series)

act in the physical injuries case. Because of the nature
of the case, the accompanying words will not add a
new meaning to it. However, where the indictment is
attempted homicide where intent to kill is an element,
the swinging of the bat may be ambiguous as to whether
or not it was swung with or without the intent to kill. The
utterance accompanying the act may explain the nature
of the act. Thus, if the accused, while swinging at the
victim, said "Adios Amigo! See you in hell," the statement
may help explain the purpose of the act of the accused.
(c) Is the equivocal act material to the issue?
Materiality is necessary for relevance. As earlier
mentioned in a previous chapter, it is the matter of
logic and is absolutely necessary for the admissibility
of evidence and the reference to it in the rules is a
redundancy.

(d) Does the statement accompany the equivocal
act? The requirement that the statement accompany
the act is explicit in Sec. 44 of Rule 130. This element
is one distinction between a spontaneous statement and
a verbal act. A spontaneous statement may be prior to,
simultaneous with, or subsequent to the startling event
or occurrence. This is not so in a verbal act. The statement
in the latter must “accompany” the equivocal act which
evidently means that it must be contemporaneous with
the act.

Records of regularly conducted business activity (Business
Records Rule)
1.

This hearsay exception states:

“SEC. 45, Records of reaularlv conducted business

diagnoses, made bv writing, typing, electronic, optical
or other similar means at or near the time of or from

conduct of a business activity, and such was the regular
practice to make the memorandum, report record, or
data compilation bv electronic, optical or similar means,
all of which are shown by the testimony of the custodian
or other qualified witnesses, is excepted from the rule
on hearsay evidence."

2. The exception is commonly encountered in breach of
contract suits and suits for collection of a sum of money.

The plaintiff, let us say, is Technics Corporation. The
complaint alleges that it delivered 100 television sets to MS
Tronics Store, the defendant, and that the latter failed to pay
for the sets delivered. Assume that the defendant filed an
answer denying the plaintiffs allegations. The plaintiff now
wants to introduce a delivery receipt signed by the manager of
the defendant acknowledging the receipt of the sets delivered.
The plaintiff also wants to introduce the company’s accounting
records prepared by a clerk who has knowledge of the fact of
delivery. The witnesses are the delivery man and the clerk, all
employees of the plaintiff. Since their testimony would show
that the delivery receipt and accounting records are kept in
the regular course of the business, and that it was the regular
practice to make such delivery receipt and accounting records,
such records are excepted from the rule on hearsay evidence.
Under the former rule, the person who made the entry
or record must be dead, outside the country, or unable to
testify, and he must have personal knowledge of the matter
recorded. The new provision under the 2019 Amendments to
the 2019 Rules on Evidence dispenses with these stringent
requirements which rendered the exception of little practical
value.
3. The Rules on Electronic Evidence expressly exempt
business records from the application of the hearsay rule
provided the mechanics of record-keeping of such records are
shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified
witnesses. The reliability of business records is, therefore,
presumed (Sec. 1, Rule 8, Rules on Electronic Evidence). The
presumption, however, may be overcome by evidence of the

368

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

CHAPTER VI

untrustworthiness of the source of information or the method
or circumstances of the preparation, transmission, or storage
thereof (Sec. 2, ibid.). The Rules Committee felt that there is no
reason why the aforementioned exception should not be applied
to paper-based or non-electronic documents considering that
such liberalized exception for business records is a practical
necessity in the modem business environment.
Declarations against interest
1.

The rule on declaration against interest provides:

"SEC. 4Q. Declaration against interest. — The
declaration made by a person deceased or unable to
testify, against the interest of the declarant, if the fact
asserted in the declaration was at the time it was made
so far contrary to the declarant’s own interest, that a
reasonable person in his or her position would not have
made the declaration unless he or she believed it to be
true, may be received in evidence against himself or
herself or his or her successors in interest and against
third persons. A statement tending to expose the
declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate
the accused is not admissible unless corroborating
circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of

the statement”

2. This is a well-established exception which finds
confirmation in human nature and experience. People
normally speak freely and even with untruth when the
statement is in their interest, but are usually unwilling to
speak falsely against their interest.

The exception is based on the theory that no man would
declare anything against himself unless such declaration were
true (Sambalilo v. Llarenas, G.R. No. 222685, June 21, 2017).
This exception refers to a declaration made by a
person who, at the time his declaration is presented in evidence,
is already dead or unable to testify. This declaration must be
one which, when made, was known to the declarant himself to
be against his interest, pecuniary or moral, and which would
3.

—

EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
B. Exceptions to the Hearsay Rule

369

not have been made unless he believed it to be true. It is clear
from the rule that it is not enough that a declaration against
interest was made. It is necessary that the declarant knew
that the statement was against his interest and which he
would not have made had it not been true.
Wigmore considers a declaration against interest as
also founded on necessity on account of the impossibility of
obtaining other evidence from the same source, the declarant
being unavailable in person to testify on the stand on account
of death, absence from the jurisdiction or serious illness (5
Wigmore on Evidence, Sec. 1456).
4. A statement by the debtor before he died that he owes
the creditor a sum of money, or an oral acknowledgment by
the principal that he received the money previously entrusted
to his agent, are clear declarations against the interest of the
person making the statement.
5. This exception will not apply where the declarant
is available as a witness. The declarant must be dead or is
unable to testify. Death is easy to explain. But what kind
of unavailability, aside from death, is a sufficient reason to
justify the application of the exception? Being outside the
territorial jurisdiction of the country may be a good reason for
unavailability if his exact whereabouts abroad are unknown.
If known, his deposition may be taken and the exception will
not apply. Serious physical or mental impairments may be
grounds for considering a person “unavailable.”
6. The declaration contemplated under Sec. 40 of Rule
130 is a declaration against interest If the declaration is
favorable to the interest of the declarant, it is a mere self¬
serving statement and does not fall as an exception to the
hearsay rule.
7. As a rule, the interest against which the declaration
may have been made should be either a pecuniary or moral
interest but, in our jurisdiction, the declaration could possibly
be against one’s penal interest because if one admits to a
crime, he is also civilly liable, a liability that is pecuniary (See
for further readings, People v. Toledo, 51 Phil. 826).

8. Note that the declaration against interest made by
the deceased, or by one unable to testify, is admissible even
against the declarant’s successors in interest or even against
third persons (Sec. 40, Rule 130, Rules of Court).

9. The last sentence is a new addition to the rule. It
states that a statement tending to expose the declarant to
criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not
admissible. Only when corroborating circumstances clearly
indicate the trustworthiness of the statement may the same

become admissible.

Declaration about pedigree
1. The exception as provided in Sec. 41 of Rule 130, as
amended, states:
“SEC. 41. Act or declaration about pedigree. —

(2) persons is shown by evidence other than such act or
declaration. The word “pedigree” includes relationship,
family genealogy, birth, marriage, death, the dates when
and the places where these facts occurred, and the
names of the relatives. It embraces also facts of family
history intimately connected with pedigree.”

To be admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule,
it must be shown that:
2.

(a) The declarant is dead, or unable to testify;
(b) The declarant is related by birth, adoption or
marriage to the person whose pedigree is in issue, or, if
not related, is so intimately associated with said person’s
family as to be likely to have accurate information
concerning his or her pedigree;

(c) The

361

declaration was made before, the

controversy; and

(d) The relationship between the two persons is
shown by evidence other than such act or declaration
(Sec. 41, Rule 130, Rules of Court).
3. The declaration of Jose, already dead, prior to his
death and prior to any controversy, that Juan ishis illegitimate
son, is a declaration about pedigree. Similarly, a statement
from a mother while living, that her daughters, Maria and
Petra, were sired by the same father is admissible.
4. Be it noted that the declaration about pedigree may
be received in evidence if the relationship is shown by evidence
other than the declaration (Ibid.).
5.

The word “pedigree” includes relationship, family

genealogy, birth, marriage, death, the dates when and the
places where these facts occurred, and the names of the
relatives. It also embraces facts of family history intimately
connected with pedigree (Ibid.).
6. The amended provision now includes not only
relationship by birth or marriage but also by adoption. It also
contemplates a situation where there is no legal relationship
between the declarant and the person whose pedigree is in
issue, but an association with said person’s family which is so
intimate as to have given him accurate information concerning
his or her pedigree.
Family reputation or tradition regarding pedigree

1.

The exception provides:

“SEC. 42* Family reputation or tradition regarding
pedigree. — The reputation or tradition existing in a
family previous to the controversy, in respect to the
pedigree of any one of its members, may be received
in evidence If the witness testifying thereon be also a
member of the family, either by consanguinity, affinity,
or adoption. Entries In family bibles or other family
books or charts, engraving on rings, family portraits
and the like, may be received as evidence of pedigree."

B. Exception* to the Hearsay Rule

(The Bar Lectures Series)

2. This exception involves: (a) a statement by a member
of the family either by consanguinity, affinity, or adoption;
(b) the statement is about the reputation or tradition of the
family in respect to the pedigree of any member of the family;
and (c) the reputation or tradition is one existing previous to
the controversy (Sec. 42, Rule 130, Rules of Court).
3. Entries in family bibles or other family books or
charts, engravings on rings, family portraits and the like, may
be received as evidence of pedigree aside from family tradition
or reputation (Ibid.).

4. While common reputation in the community may
establish marriage or moral character, it cannot establish
pedigree. This is established by reputation in the family and
not in the community (See Secs. 41 and 42, Rule 130, Rules of

Court).
Entries in official records
1.

The exception, as quoted, declares:

"SEC. 43- Common reputation. — Common
reputation existing previous to the controversy, as to
boundaries of or customs affecting lands In the
community and reputation as to events of general history
important to the community, or respecting marriage or
moral character, may be given in evidence. Monuments
and inscriptions in public places may be received as
evidence of common reputation.”

2. Under the old rule, common reputation is admissible
in evidence where the reputation refers to a matter of public
or general interest which is more than thirty (30) years old,
or respecting marriage or moral character, and said common
reputation existed prior to the controversy. Under the new
rule, facts of public or general interest were replaced with
boundaries of or customs affecting lands in the community
and reputation as to events of general history important to
the community. This common reputation may be established
by monuments and inscriptions in public places (Sec. 43, Rule
130, Rules of Court).

3. Common reputation is hearsay, like any other
exception to the hearsay rule, but is admissible because of
trustworthiness (Reg. v. Bedforshire, 4 E. & B. 535, 82 E.C.L.
535, 542).

The exception is stated as follows:

“SEC. 4£. Entries In official records. — Entries in
official records made in the performance of his or her
duty by a public officer of the Philippines, or by a person
In the performance of a duty specially enjoined by law,
are prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated."

2. The requisites for the admissibility in evidence of
entries in official records, as an exception to the hearsay rule,

are:
(a) The entry was made by a public officer or by
another person specially enjoined by law to do so;

(b) It was made by the public officer, or by such
other person in the performance of a duty specially
enjoined by law; and
(c) The public officer or other person had sufficient
knowledge of the facts by him or her stated, which must
have been acquired by the public officer or other person
personally or through official information (Alvarez v.
PICOP Resources, 606 SCRA 444, as cited in Malayan
Insurance Co., Inc. v. Alberto, 664 SCRA 791, 799,
February 1, 2012; Sabili v. Commission on Elections, 670
SCRA 664, 670, April 24, 2012).

3. In a case, petitioner denies receiving the assessment
notice sent by respondent BIR. The respondent presented the
BIR record book where the name of the taxpayer, the kind
of tax assessed, the registry receipt number and the date of
mailing were noted. The BIR records custodian also testified
that she made the entries therein. Respondent offered the

entry in the BIR record book and the testimony of its record
custodian as entries in official records in accordance with Sec.
44 (now Sec. 46), Rule 130 of the Rules of Court.

In this case, it was not stated in the transcript of
stenographic notes how and from whom the witness obtained
the pertinent information. Moreover, the witness did not
attest to the fact that the report was acquired from persons
under a legal duty to submit the same. Hence, Sec. 46 of Rule
130 finds no application in the present case. The evidence
offered by respondent does not qualify as an exception to the
rule against hearsay evidence (Barcelon Roxas Security, Inc.
v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 498 SCRA 126).
L

The exception declares:

“SEC. 4Z. Commercial lists and the like. — Evidence
of statements of matters of interest to persons engaged
in an occupation contained in a list, register, periodical,
or other published compilation is admissible as tending
to prove the truth of any relevant matter so stated if that
compilation is published for use by persons engaged in
that occupation and is generally used and relied upon
by them therein.”

2. Certain commercial lists and reports of matters of
interest to persons engaged in a particular occupation are
admissible in evidence as exceptions to the hearsay rule,
provided, they are made by persons engaged in that occupation
and are generally used and relied upon by them and those
lists and reports are published (Sec. 47, Rule 130, Rules of
Court).

fall within this exception provided that an expert on the
subject testifies to the expertise of the writer or the court
takes judicial notice of such fact.

or otherwise unable to testify, given in a former case
or proceeding, judicial or administrative, involving
the same parties and subject matter, may be given
in evidence against the adverse party who had the
opportunity to cross-examine him or her.”

2. The testimony contemplated is one given in a former
case or proceeding, judicial or administrative, involving the
same parties and subject matter. The testimony is given by
one who is now deceased or unable to testify’. Said testimony
may be given in evidence against the adverse party provided
the latter had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness
who gave the previous testimony (Sec. 49, Rule 130, Rules of
Court; See also Somalia v. Court of Appeals, 454 SCRA 462,
March 31, 2005).
3. For Sec. 49 of Rule 130 to apply, the following
requisites must be satisfied: (a) the witness is dead or out

therein, or is unavailable or otherwise unable to testify; (b)
his testimony or deposition was given in a former case or
proceeding, judicial or administrative, between the same

case involved the same subject as that in the present case,
although on different causes of action; (d) the issue testified to
by the witness in the former trial is the same issue involved in
the present case; and (e) the adverse party had an opportunity
to cross-examine the witness in the former case (Manliclic v.
Calaunan, 512 SCRA 642).

(b) the statement is more probative on the point
for which it is offered than any other evidence which the
proponent can procure through reasonable efforts;
(c) the general purposes of the Rules and the
interests of justice will be best served by admission of the
statement into evidence; and
(d) the proponent makes known to the adverse
party his or her intention to offer the statement and the
particulars of it, including the name and address of the
declarant, sufficiently in advance of the hearing, or by
the pre-trial stage in the case of a trial of the main case.
The purpose of the last requirement is to remove any
element of surprise and to provide the adverse party with a
fair opportunity to prepare to meet such statement.

(a) the statement is offered as evidence of a material
fact; (b) the statement is more probative on the point

Exception to the hearsay rule in child abuse cases

Residual exception
1. This is a new exception under the 2019 Amendments
to the Rules on Evidence. It provides:

-

"SEC, 50, Residual exception, A statement not
specifically covered bv anv of the foregoing exceptions,
having equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trust¬

for which it is offered than any other evidence which
the proponent can procure throuah reasonable efforts;

and (cl the general purposes of these Rules and the
Interests of justice will be best served bv admission
of the statement into evidence. However, a statement
may not be admitted under this exception unless
the proponent makes known to the adverse party,
sufficiently in advance of the hearing, or by the pre-trial
stage In the case of a trial of the main case, to provide
the adverse party with a fair opportunity to prepare to
meet it the proponent’s intention to offer the statement
and the particulars of it including the name and address
of the declarant"

2. Under this rule, although a statement may not
be specifically covered by any of the other exceptions to
the hearsay rule despite having equivalent circumstantial
guarantees of trustworthiness, the same is admissible if the
court determines that the following requirements are present:
(a) the statement is offered as evidence of a material
fact;

1. Under Sec. 28 of the Rule on Examination of a Child
Witness, a hearsay statement of a child which under the
Rules of Court, is not admissible for being hearsay because
the facts testified to are not within his personal knowledge,
may be admitted in evidence in any criminal or non-criminal
proceeding.
2. The testimony is admissible provided the same be
offered in child abuse cases and the statement made by the
child is one describing any act or attempted act of child abuse.
Aside from the above requirements, the following must
likewise be complied with:
(a) The proponent shall make known to the
adverse party the intention to offer such statement and
its particulars to provide him a fair opportunity to object
before the hearsay statement may be admitted;

(b) If the child is available, the court shall, upon
motion of the adverse party, require the child to be
present at the presentation of the hearsay statement for
cross-examination by the adverse party; and

EVIDENCE

368

(The Bar Lectures Series)

CHAPTER VI

(c) When the child is unavailable (as when the
child is deceased, suffers from physical infirmity, mental
illness, loss of memory, or because the child will be
exposed to severe psychological injury), the fact of such
circumstance must be proved by the proponent and the
hearsay testimony shall be admitted only if corroborated
by other admissible evidence (Sec. 28fa], Rule on
Examination of a Child Witness).
3. In ruling on the admissibility of the hearsay
statement, the court shall consider the (a) time, (b) content,
and (c) circumstances surrounding the making of the
statement which would provide sufficient indicia of reliability

(Sec. 28[b], ibid.).

Certain factors are also to be considered by the court
before deciding to admit the statement like the motive to lie, the
general character of the declarant child, the number of persons
who heard the statement, the spontaneity of the making of
the statement, the timing of the making of the statement, the
relationship between the declarant child and the witness, the
remoteness of the possibility of a faulty recollection and other
circumstances surrounding the statement (ibid.).

C. Opinion Evidence

The rules on opinion evidence under Sec. 130 of the Rules
of Court provide:
“SEC. 51. General rule. — The opinion of a witness
Is not admissible, except as indicated in the following

sections.
SEC. 52- Opinion of expert witness. — The opinion
of a witness on a matter requiring special knowledge,
skill, experience, training or education, which he or she
is shown to possess, may be received in evidence.

—

SEC. 53- Opinion of ordinary witnesses.
The
opinion of a witness for which proper basis is given,
may be received In evidence regarding —
(a) The identity of a person about whom he gr_

5hfi has adequate knowledge;

—

EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
C. Opinion Evidence

369

(b) A handwriting with which he or she has
sufficient familiarity; and
(c) The mental sanity of a person with whom he
or she is sufficiently acquainted.

The witness may also testify on his or her
impressions of the emotion, behavior, condition or
appearance of a person."

Admissibility of opinion evidence (Bar 2011)

As a rule, the opinion of a witness is inadmissible (Sec.
51, Rule 130, Rules of Court). This is because when a witness
testifies, a witness does so only with respect to facts personally
observed by him and it is for the court to draw conclusions
from the facts testified to.
When opinion evidence Is admissible; expert testimony (Bar
2011)

1. When the opinion is that of an expert, i.e., the opinion
of a witness requiring special knowledge, skill, experience,
training or education which he or she is shown to possess, it
may be received in evidence (Sec. 52, ibid.). It is the specialist’s
knowledge of the requisite subject matter, rather than his or
her specialty that determines his or her qualification to testify
(Casumpang u. Cortejo, G.R. No. 171127, March 11, 2015).
2. The court is not, however, bound by the opinion
of an expert such as a handwriting expert. Expert opinion
evidence is to be considered or weighed by the court, like any
other testimony, in the light of its own general knowledge and
experience upon the subject of inquiry. The probative force of
the testimony of an expert does not lie in a mere statement of
his theory or opinion, but rather in the aid that he can render
to the courts in showing the facts which serve as a basis for his
criterion and the reasons upon which the logic of his conclusion
is founded (Dizon v. Tuazon, 557 SCRA 487).

Expert opinions are not ordinarily conclusive. When
faced with conflicting expert opinions, courts give weight

EVIDENCE

370

(The Bar Lectures Series)

CHAPTER VI -HEARSAY EVIDENCE, OPINION
EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
D. Character Evidence

371

and credence to that which is more complete, thorough and
scientific (Bacalso v. Padigos, 552 SCRA 185).

(c) Whether the witness has applied the principles
and methods reliably to the facts of the case; and

The problem of the credibility of the expert witness and
the evaluation of his testimony is left to the discretion of
the trial court whose ruling thereupon is not reviewable in
the absence of abuse of discretion (Tabao v. People, G.R. No.
187246, July 20, 2011).

(d) Such other factors as the court may deem
helpful to make such determination.

3. For instance, in examining forged documents,
the testimonies of handwriting experts are concededly
useful. However, resort to these experts is not mandatory or
indispensable because a finding of forgery does not depend
entirely on their testimonies. Judges must also exercise
independent judgment in determining the authenticity or
genuineness of the signature in question, and not rely merely
on the testimonies of handwriting experts (Mendez v. Court of
Appeals, 672 SCRA 200, 209, June 13, 2012).
A handwriting expert is not indispensable to prove that a
signature was indeed a forgery. The opinion[s] of handwriting
experts are not necessarily binding upon the court, the
expert’s function being to place before the court data upon
which the court can form its own opinion. While these experts
are helpful in the examination of forged documents because of
the technical procedure involved in analyzing them, resort to
them is not mandatory or indispensable to the examination or
comparison of handwriting (Lorzano v. Tabayag, 665 SCRA
38, 47, February 6, 2012).

Section 5 of Rule 133, a new addition under the 2019
Amendments to the Rules on Evidence, provides the following
guidelines which the court may consider in determining the
weight to be given to expert opinion:
4.

(a) Whether the opinion is based upon sufficient
facts or data;
(b) Whether it is the product of reliable principles
and methods;

Opinion of an ordinary witness; when admissible (Bar 2005)
1. When the opinion is that of a witness who is not an
expert (ordinary witness), his testimony may be admitted in
evidence provided that the proper basis of the opinion is given
and the subject of the opinion is any of the following matters:
(a) The identity of a person about whom the witness
has adequate knowledge;
(b) The handwriting of a person with which the
witness has sufficient familiarity;
(c) The mental sanity of a person with whom he or
she is sufficiently acquainted; and
(d) The impressions of the witness of the emotion,
behavior, condition or appearance of a person (Sec. 53,
Rule 130, Rules of Court).
2. In any of the above, the opinion of an ordinary
witness is admissible.

D. Character Evidence
Inadmissibility of character evidence

1. While the Rules on Evidence do not provide a
definition for character, jurisprudence defines it as the
possession by a person of certain qualities of mind and morals,
distinguishing him from others (People v. Lee, 382 SCRA 596).
It is not the same as a man’s reputation because the latter
depends on attributes which others believe one to possess.
Character signifies reality while reputation signifies what
is accepted to be reality at present (Black’s Law Dictionary,
5th Ed., p. 211). In other words, while character is what the

372

EVIDENCE

CHAPTER VI -HEARSAY EVIDENCE, OPINION
EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
D. Character Evidence

(The Bar Lectures Series)

person really is, reputation is what he is supposed to be in
accordance with what people say he is, and is dependent on
how people perceive him to be.

2. Unfortunately, the definition of character provides
little guidance in determining whether certain traits like
alcoholism are traits of character or perhaps of genetics. It
could be debated whether an individual’s sexual preference
should be analyzed as character or something else entirely, or
whether a person’s mental illness could be considered part of
that person’s character. A stroke victim’s propensity to forget,
for instance, would more properly be considered a medical
condition rather than a trait of character.
3. Character evidence is, as a rule, not admissible
(Sec. 54, Rule 130, Rules of Court). Character is generally
irrelevant in determining a controversy because the evidence
of a person’s character or trait is not admissible to prove that
a person acted in conformity with such character or trait on a
particular occasion (29 Am Jur 2d, Evidence, §363).
The rule is that the character or reputation of a party is
regarded as legally irrelevant in determining a controversy,
so that evidence relating thereto is not admissible. Ordinarily,
if the issues in the case were allowed to be influenced by
evidence of the character or reputation of the parties, the trial
would be apt to have the aspects of a popularity contest rather
than a factual inquiry into the merits of the case. After all, the
business of the court is to try the case, and not the man; and a
very bad man may have a righteous cause (People v. Lee, 382
SCRA 596).
Evidence of bad moral character of the accused (Bar 2010,
2019)

1. In a criminal case, the prosecution cannot prove the
bad moral character of the accused in its evidence-in-chief.
It can only do so in rebuttal (Sec. 54[a]f2], Rule 130, Rules
of Court). This means that the prosecution may not offer
evidence of the character of the accused unless the accused

373

himself has offered evidence of his good moral character. The
prosecution, therefore, must wait until the accused puts his
character in issue during the proceedings. Where the accused
proves his good moral character pertinent to the moral trait
involved in the offense charged (Sec. 54[a][l], ibid.), he opens
the door to the prosecution to prove that his moral character
is, in fact, bad. Then and only then may the prosecution prove
the bad moral character of the accused.
The relevant provision provides:
“SEC. 54. Character evidence not generally admis¬
sible; exceptions.
Evidence of a person’s character
or a trait of character is not admissible for the purpose
of proving action In conformity therewith on a particular
occasion, except:

—

(a)

In Criminal Cases:

(1) The character of the offended party may
be proved if it tends to establish In any reasonable
degree the probability or improbability of the

offense charged.
(2) The accused may prove his or her
good moral character, pertinent to the moral trait
involved In the offense charged. However, the
prosecution may not prove his or her bad moral
character unless on rebuttal.” (italics supplied).

2. As mentioned, the prosecution is forbidden by Sec.
54(a)(2) of Rule 130 to initiate evidence of the bad moral
character of the accused. It prevents the government from
opening the doors towards the introduction of character
evidence of the accused. The rule that confines the right of
the prosecution to prove the bad moral character of the
accused only by way of rebuttal is a logical one. It prevents a
pronouncement of guilt on account of his being a “bad” man
and instead anchors a conviction on the basis of the sufficiency
of evidence of his guilt. The rule also prevents the inference
that, being a bad person, the accused is more likely to commit

374

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

a crime. The rule likewise discourages the presentation of the
so-called “propensity evidence,” i,e., evidence that one acts in
accordance with one’s character.
3. The offering of evidence of good moral character is
a privilege of the accused and the prosecution cannot even
comment on his failure to produce such evidence. But once he
raises the issue of his good character, the prosecution may,
in rebuttal, offer evidence of the defendant’s bad character
(People u. Lee, 382 SCRA 596).
Evidence of good moral character of the accused (Bar 2010,
2011, 2018)

1. The accused may prove his good moral character
when pertinent to the moral trait involved in the offense
charged (Sec. 54[a][2], Rule 130, Rules of Court).

2. While the prosecution is forbidden to present
evidence of the bad moral character of the accused unless in
rebuttal, the general rule against “propensity evidence” does
not apply to the accused who is allowed to offer evidence of his
good character. Not all aspects, however, of the character of
the accused may be proven. Only those moral traits involved
in the offense charged are provable. In doing so, an accused
may advance more than one character trait as evidence so
long as each trait is germane to some issue in the case. This
theory is plain from a reading of Sec. 54(a) of Rule 130.
3. The accused may prove his good moral character
which is pertinent to the moral trait involved in the offense
charged. When the accused presents proof of his good moral
character, this strengthens the presumption of innocence
and, where good character and reputation are established, an
inference arises that the accused did not commit the crime
charged. This view proceeds from the theory that a person
of good character and high reputation is not likely to have
committed the act charged against him.

CHAPTER VI -HEARSAY EVIDENCE. OPINION
EVIDENCE, AND CHARACTER EVIDENCE
D. Character Evidence

376

In contrast, the prosecution may not prove the bad moral
character of the accused except only in rebuttal and when
such evidence is pertinent to the moral trait involved in the
offense charged. This is intended to avoid unfair prejudice to
the accused who might otherwise be convicted not because
he is guilty but because he is a person of bad character. The
offering of character evidence on his behalf is a privilege of the
accused, and the prosecution cannot comment on the failure
of the accused to produce such evidence. Once the accused
raises the issue of his good character, the prosecution may,
in rebuttal, offer evidence of his bad character (People v. Lee,
382 SCRA 596).
Evidence of character of the offended party
1. The good or bad moral character of the offended
party may be proved by the accused if it tends to establish in
any reasonable degree the probability or improbability of the
offense charged (Sec. 54[a][l], Rule 130, Rules of Court).
2. Not every good or bad moral character of the offended
party may be proved under this provision but only those
which would establish the probability or improbability of the
offense charged. This means that the character evidence must
be limited to the traits and characteristics involved in the type
of offense charged. Thus, on a charge of rape character for
chastity, on a charge of assault character for peaceableness
or violence, and on a charge of embezzlement character for
honesty (Civil Service Commission v. Belagan, 440 SCRA 578
citing Francisco, Basic Evidence, Second Edition, 1999).

—

—
—

In one rape case, where it was established that the
alleged victim was morally loose and apparently uncaring
about her chastity, the Court found the conviction of the
accused doubtful (Ibid, citing People v. Tempongko, Jr., GJi.
No. 69668, October 2, 1986, 144 SCRA 583.) However, the
present rule is that in rape cases, the moral character of the
victim is immaterial (People v. Bares, G.R. Nos. 137762-65.
March 27, 2001; People v. Espino, Jr., G.R. No. 176742, June
17, 2008; People v. Penilla, G.R. No. 189324. March 20, 2013)

376

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

Sexual abuse shield rule In child sexual abuse cases
The following evidence, however, is not admissible in
any criminal proceeding involving alleged child sexual abuse
under the “sexual abuse shield” rule:
(a) Evidence to prove that the alleged victim
engaged in other sexual behavior; and
(b) Evidence offered to prove the sexual
predisposition of the alleged victim (See Sec. 30, Rule on
Examination of a Child Witness).
Under this rule, the accused is not allowed to prove the
bad moral character of the offended party. However, evidence
of any of the above is admissible to prove that a person other
than the accused was the source of semen, injury, or other
physical evidence.
Character evidence in civil cases

In civil cases, evidence of the moral character of a party
is admissible only when pertinent to the issue of character
involved in the case (Sec. 54[b], Rule 130, Rules of Court).
Thus, evidence of a party’s intemperance may be admitted
when such is pertinent to the issues involved.
Evidence of good character of a witness
Evidence of the good character of a witness is not
admissible until such character has been impeached (Sec.
54[c], ibid.). It is error for counsel to offer evidence of the good
character of his witness who is presented in court for the first
time since he could not have been previously impeached.
Proof of character or trait of character

In all cases in which evidence of character or a trait of
character of a person is admissible, proof may be made by
testimony as to reputation or by testimony in the form of an
opinion, as an exception to the general rule that the opinion of
a witness is not admissible. On cross-examination, inquiry is
allowable into relevant specific instances of conduct.

Chapter VII
OFFER OF EVIDENCE AND
TRIAL OBJECTIONS
(Rule 132)
The provisions relevant to this chapter are reproduced as

follows:
"SEC. 34. Offer of evidence. — The court shall
consider no evidence which has not been formally
offered. The purpose for which the evidence is offered
must be specified.
SEC. 35. When to make offer. — AH evidence must

be offered orally.
The offer of the testimony of a witness In evidence
must be made at the time the witness is called to testify.

The Offer of documentary and object evidence shall
be made after the presentation of a party’s testimonial
evidence.
SEC. 36. Objection. — Objection to offer of evidence
must be made orally immediately after the offer is made.
Objection to the testimony of a witness for lack
of a formal offer must be made as soon as the witness
begins to testify- Objection to a question propounded
in the course of the oral examination of a witness must
be made as soon as the grounds therefor shall become
reasonably apparent

The grounds for the objections must be specified.

SEC. 37- When repetition of objection unnecessary.

— When it becomes reasonably apparent in the course
378

of the examination of a witness that the questions being
propounded are of the same class as those to which
objection has been made, whether such objection was
sustained or overruled, it shall not be necessary to
repeat the objection, It being sufficient for the adverse
party to record his or her continuing objection to such
class of questions.

SEC. 38. Ruling. — The ruling of the court must be
given immediately after the objection is made, unless
the court desires to take a reasonable time to inform
itself on the question presented; but the ruling shall
always be made during the trial and at such time as will
give the party against whom it is made an opportunity to
meet the situation presented by the ruling.
The reason for sustaining or overruling an
objection need not be stated. However, if the objection
is based on two (2) or more grounds, a ruling sustaining
the objection on one (1) or some of them must specify
the ground or grounds relied upon.
SEC. 39. Striking out of answer. — Should a witness
answer the question before the adverse party had the
opportunity to voice fully its objection to the same, or
Where a question is not objectionable, but the answer
is not responsive, or where a witness testifies without
a question being posed or testifies bevond limits set bv
the court, or when the witness does a narration instead
of answering the question, and such objection is found
to be meritorious, the court shall sustain the objection
and order such answer, testimony or narration to be
stricken off the record.

On proper motion, the court may also order
the striking out of answers which are incompetent,
irrelevant, or otherwise improper.

—

SEC. 40. Tender of excluded evidence.
If
documents or things offered in evidence are excluded
by the court, the offeror may have the same attached to
or made part of the record. If the evidence excluded is
oral, the offeror may state for the record the name and
other personal circumstances of the witness and the
substance of the proposed testimony."

(Rule 132)

Importance of offer of evidence (Bar 2003, 2012, 2018)

Marking of a document; not a formal offer

1. An evidence must be formally offered. Under the
Rules of Court, the court shall consider no evidence which has
not been formally offered (Sec. 34, Rule 132, Rules of Court).

1. A document, or any article for that matter, is not
evidence when it is simply marked for identification; it
must be formally offered, and the opposing counsel given an

2. A formal offer is necessary since judges are required
to base their findings of fact and their judgment solely and
strictly upon the evidence offered by the parties at the trial.
To allow parties to attach their documents in their pleadings
and expect the court to consider such as evidence, even
without formal offer and admission, may draw unwarranted
consequences. Opposing parties will be deprived of their chance
to examine the document and to object to its admissibility.
On the other hand, the appellate court will have difficulty
reviewing documents not previously scrutinized by the courts
below (Gotesco Properties, Inc. v. Solidbank Corp., G.R. No.
209452, July 26,2017).
Thus, in Spouses Ong v. Court of Appeals, 301 SCRA 387,
the Court exonerated a common carrier from liability because
the police report finding it liable was not formally offered in
evidence (Also Gotesco Properties, Inc. v. Solidbank Corp., G.R.
No. 209452, July 26, 2017). In Dizon u. Court of Tax Appeals,
553 SCRA 111, it was ruled that no evidentiary value can be
given the pieces of evidence submitted by the BIR, since they
were not formally offered. This is the rule under Sec. 34 of
Rule 132 of the Rules of Court. In Spouses Tan v. Republic,
573 SCRA 89, the Court sustained the Court of Appeals which
refused to consider a document submitted for the first time by
the petitioners when the same was attached to their motion
for reconsideration of the decision of the Court of Appeals. In
sustaining the appellate court, the Supreme Court reiterated
the rule in Sec. 34 of Rule 132 that, “the court shall consider no
evidence which has not been formally offered.” The document
should have been offered during the trial in the Regional Trial
Court.

opportunity to object to it or cross-examine the witness called
upon to prove or identify it. A formal offer is necessary since
judges are required to base their findings of fact and judgment
only, and strictly, upon the evidence offered by the parties at
the trial. The appellate court will have difficulty reviewing
documents not previously scrutinized by the court below. The
pertinent provisions of the Revised Rules of Court, on the
inclusion on appeal of documentary evidence or exhibits in the
records, cannot be stretched as to include such pleadings or
documents not offered at the hearing of the case (Candido v.
Court of Appeals, 253 SCRA 78).
2. There is a distinction between identification of
documentary evidence and its formal offer as an exhibit. The
first is done in the course of the trial and is accompanied by
the marking of the evidence as an exhibit, while the second
is done only when the party rests its case (Dizon v. Court of
Tax Appeals, 553 SCRA 111 citing Vda. de Onate v. Court
of Appeals, 250 SCRA 283, and Interpacific Transit, Inc. v.
Aviles, 186 SCRA 385).
When formal offer of evidence is not required
1. A formal offer of evidence is not required in certain
cases, thus:

(a) In a summary proceeding, because it is a
proceeding where there is no full-blown trial;
(b) Documents judicially admitted or taken judicial

notice of;
(c) Documents, affidavits and depositions used in
rendering a summary judgment;
(d) Documents or affidavits used in deciding quasi¬
judicial or administrative cases (Bantolino v. Coca-Cola
Bottlers, Inc., 403 SCRA 699); or

(Rule 132)

(e) Lost objects previously marked, identified,
described in the record, and testified to by witnesses who
had been subjects of cross-examination in respect to said
objects (Tabuena v. Court of Appeals, 196 SCRA 650;
People v. Napat-a, 179 SCRA 403). (Bar 2012)

documents may be considered by the courts below (Titan
Construction Company v. Uni-field Enterprises, Inc., 517
SCRA 180).

2. There were instances, however, when the Court
allowed the admission of evidence not formally offered as in
People v. Napat-a, supra, citing People v. Mate, 103 SCRA 484,
where evidence not formally offered was held to be allowable
provided certain requirements are present:
(a) The evidence must have been duly identified by
testimony duly recorded; and
(b) The same must have been incorporated in the
records of the case (See also Medina v. People, G.R. No.
182648, June 17, 2015; Bank of Commerce v. Heirs of
Rodolfo de la Cruz, G.R No. 211519, August 14, 2017).
3. In People v. Libnao, 395 SCRA 407, evidence of the
prosecution in a crime involving a violation of the Dangerous
Drugs Act were considered by the Court even without
their having been formally offered because the evidence
were properly identified by testimony duly recorded and
incorporated in the records of the case. The counsel for the
accused also cross-examined the witnesses testifying on the
evidence.

1. As to when the offer of evidence is made depends
upon the nature of the evidence.

When evidence is offered by petitioner but not by respondent

In one case, certain delivery receipts and sales invoices
did not form part of respondent’s formal offer of evidence but
the same formed part of petitioner’s formal offer of evidence.
Petitioner insisted that since the said documents did not form
part of the evidence formally offered by respondent, the trial
court and the Court of Appeals had no legal basis to award
interest and damages in his favor. The Supreme Court held
that no error could be ascribed to the lower courts because
the delivery receipts and sales invoices were, nevertheless,
formally offered by petitioner in evidence. Hence, the

When evidence Is to be offered

(a) As regards the testimony of the witness, the
offer is to be made at the time the witness is called to
testify (Sec. 35, Rule 132, Rules of Court).
(b) As regards documentary and object evidence,
they are to be offered after the presentation of a party’s
testimonial evidence. Whereas under the previous
rule, the court may allow the offer of documentary and
object evidence to be done in writing, under the 2019
Amendments to the Rules on Evidence, such offer must
be made orally (Ibid.). The purpose is to obviate delay
caused by the submission of a written formal offer of
evidence.
2. The provisions of the Rules of Court, as stated above,
give a simple rule as to when an evidence is to be offered.
Hence, the presentation of documentary or object evidence for
marking and identification during the course of the trial is not
the offer contemplated in the Rules. Failure to object to the
evidence at this time should not be construed as a waiver of
the objection to the evidence.
3. A relatively well-known criminal case, Macasiray v.
People, 291 SCRA 154, is instructive as to when an objection
to documentary evidence need be made. It, once and for all,
reinforces what has already been made clear by the Rules
of Court that objections to documentary evidence shall be
made after it is offered and the offer of such evidence shall be
made after the presentation of a party’s testimonial evidence.
The case involves a certain Macasiray and two others
who were accused of murder. During the course of the trial,
the prosecution introduced, among others, two documents.

—

EVIDENCE

384

(The Bar Lectures Series)

One was an extrajudicial confession by one of the accused
admitting his participation in the crime and implicating the
others. The other document was the transcript of stenographic
notes taken during the preliminary investigation of the case.
At the time the documents were introduced for marking and
identification, the accused interposed no objection to the
evidence. When they were, however, offered at the close of the
prosecution’s presentation of evidence, the accused objected
to the admissibility of the documents on the ground that the
documents were made without the assistance of counsel.
The trial court sustained the objections and declared the
documents inadmissible.
However, the Court of Appeals declared the documents
admissible and ordered their admission by the trial court. In
so holding, it considered the failure of the defense to object to
the documents when they were introduced for marking and
identification as a waiver of their objection.

In reversing the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court
ruled that a party is not deemed to have waived objection
to admissibility of documents by his failure to object to the
same when they were marked, identified and then introduced
during the trial. This is because objection to documentary
evidence must be made at the time it is formally offered and
not earlier.
4. Cases prior to Macasiray had similarly held that
an objection to evidence must be made after the evidence is
formally offered and that documentary evidence is offered
after all the witnesses of the party making the offer have

testified.
“Contrary to the ruling of the appellate court, petitioners
did not waive objection to admissibility of the said documents
by their failure to object when these were marked, identified
and then introduced during the trial. That was not the proper
time to make the objection x x x. A document or any article
for that matter, is not evidence when it is simply marked for
identification it must be formally offered” (Candido u. Court
of Appeals, 253 SCRA 78; People v. Santito, Jr., 201 SCRA 87).

—

CHAPTER VII -OFFER OF EVIDENCE
AND TRIAL OBJECTIONS

385

(Rule 132)

It is when the accused fails to object to the admissibility
of certain items during their formal offer, that he is deemed
to have waived his right against their admissibility (People v.
Diaz, 271 SCRA 504).
How an offer of evidence is made
1. When a party makes a formal offer of his evidence,
state the nature or substance of the evidence, and
must
he
the specific purpose for which the evidence is offered (Sec. 34,
Rule 132, Rules of Court). (Bar 1983)
2. The court shall consider the evidence solely for the
purpose for which it is offered, not for any other purpose
(Spouses Ragudo v. Fabella Estate Tenants Association, Inc.,

466 SCRA 136).
Objections; purposes of objections (Bar 2012)
Objections may be made for any of the following purposes:

(a) To keep out inadmissible evidence that would
cause harm to a client’s cause. The rules on evidence are
not self-operating and, hence, must be invoked by way of
an objection;
(b) To protect the record, Le., to present the issue of
inadmissibility of the offered evidence in a way that if the
trial court rules erroneously, the error can be relied upon
as a ground for a future appeal;
(c) To protect a witness from being embarrassed on
the stand or from being harassed by the adverse counsel:

(d) To expose the adversary’s unfair tactics like his
consistently asking obviously leading questions;
(e) To give the trial court an opportunity to correct
its own errors and, at the same time, warn the court that
a ruling adverse to the objector may supply a reason to
invoke a higher court’s appellate jurisdiction; and

(1) To avoid a waiver of the inadmissibility of
otherwise inadmissible evidence.

(The Bar Lectures Series)

CHAPTER VII- OFFER OF EVIDENCE
AND TRIAL OBJECTIONS

General and specific objections (Bar 1997)

(Rule 132)

1. An objection must point out the specific ground of
the objection and, if it does not do so, no error is committed in
overruling it (75 Am Jur 2d, 2nd Ed., §254-256).
2. The last paragraph of Sec. 36, Rule 132, provides:
. the grounds for the objections must be specified.” The
objection, therefore, “must be specific.” Hence, an objector
must be explicit as to the legal ground he invokes. He cannot

simply manifest that he is interposing an objection. He has
to precisely state the exclusionary rule that would justify his
opposition to the proffered evidence.

3. The following examples are considered as general
objections:
(a) “Objection, The evidence is incompetent!”
(b) “Objection! Inadmissible!”
(c) “Objection:

Incompetent,

Irrelevant,

387

and

Immaterial!”
(d) “Objection: Improper!”

They are called “general” for an obvious reason. They
do not clearly indicate to the judge the ground upon which

the objections are predicated. They assign no grounds to
the objection. A general objection, in including everything,
actually specifies nothing.
4. An objection that evidence is “incompetent,”
irrelevant,” or “immaterial” is ordinarily regarded in most
jurisdictions, in the absence of any statutory provision to the
contrary, as not sufficiently definite to present any question
for review (Mills v. Texas Compensation Ins. Co., 75 Am Jur
29 256; People v. Wright, 26 Cal App 2d 197, 79 P2d 102),
because it conveys neither to the court nor counsel any specific
point of objection (75 Am Jur 2d 256).

5. Rule 132 does not tell us how specific an objection
must be. Practical reasons, however, tell us that the objection
must be specific enough to adequately inform the court the

rule on evidence or of substantive law that authorizes the
exclusion of the evidence. Objections such as "question calls
for a hearsay answer,” “witness cannot testify on a privileged
communication," “the question calls for a conclusion," "the
question is beyond the scope of the direct examination," and
"impeachment is improper" are specific enough for anyone to
know the basis of the objection.

6.

While an objection that the evidence is "incompetent,

irrelevant and immaterial”is, by common wisdom, concededly
a general objection, some writers hold that an objection that
the evidence is "irrelevant” may, at times, not be general. This
kind of objection states “a distinct and substantial ground for
exclusion” (Graham, Handbook of Federal Evidence, 13 n. 16,
1981). It is submitted that the opinion is worth considering.
Necessarily, when the evidence clearly is one which does
not prove a fact in issue, with no probative value and with
no relationship to the fact in issue, or inadmissible for any
purpose and no other objection is possible, there is no other
ground for the objection except to say that it is “irrelevant” In
such a situation, this should be deemed as substantially the
equivalent of a specific objection.

7. The rule is that a specific objection is always
preferred over a general objection. This is not to say, however,
that a general objection can never be allowed. The rule on
specificity is dictated largely by the need to allow the court
to intelligently rule on the objection and give the other party
an opportunity to withdraw the evidence or correct an error
in his presentation. The rule, however, does not impose a
general or an absolute ban on general objections. There is
no compelling need to specify the ground, “if the ground for
exclusion should have been obvious to the judge or to counsel”
(Floy v. Hibbard, 227 Iowa 149, 287 N.W. 829). There are cases
where the incompetency of the evidence is so palpable that a
mere general objection is deemed sufficient, and where the
portion of the evidence objected to is clearly pointed out and
its illegality is apparent on its face, then the objection must be
allowed (75 Am Jur 257 citing Scott v. Times-Mirror Co., 181

US 51, 39LEd 343, 15 S. CL 273).
Formal and substantive objections (Bar 1997)

1. Objections may be formal or substantive. A formal
objection is one directed against the alleged defect in the
formulation of the question. Examples: ambiguous questions;
leading and misleading questions; repetitious questions;
multiple questions; argumentative questions.
2. A substantive objection is one made and directed
against the very nature of the evidence, i.e., it is inadmissible
either because it is irrelevant or incompetent or both.
Examples: parol; not the best evidence; hearsay, privileged
communication; not authenticated; opinion; res inter alios
acta.
Objections must be timely

(c) An objection to a question propounded in the
course of the oral examination of the witness must
be made as soon as the grounds therefor shall become
reasonably apparent (Ibid.).
3. The rules, therefore, make the offer of evidence the
frame of reference for a timely objection. Hence, it ia to be
assumed that an objection to the evidence before it is offered
is premature and no adverse inference may be had against a
party who does not object to the evidence before it is offered.
4. Objections to evidence must be made in the trial
court. Objections cannot be made for the first time on appeal
(People v. Tripoli, G.R. No. 207001, June 7, 2017).

5. Recall that the rule requires that an objection to a
question in the course of an oral examination should be made
as soon as the ground for the objection becomes apparent.
Consider this example where the question is asked to prove
the truth of the statement of an outside declarant:

1. Aside from the requirement that an objection must
state the specific ground relied upon, it is also necessary that
the objection be timely.

Question:

Mr. Santos, can you tell this court what Mr.
Cruz told you about the truth of bow the
collision happened?

When a party desires the court to reject the evidence
offered, he must so state in the form of objection. Without
such objection, he cannot raise the question for the first time
on appeal (See People v. Gabuya, G.R. No. 195245, February
16, 2015; People v. Diaz, G.R. No. 197818, February 25, 2015).

Counsel:

Objection. Your Honor. Question calb for a
hearsay answer!

Court:

Sustained.

In order to be timely, therefore, the objection must
be made at the earliest opportunity (88 C.J.S. 236). What the
earliest opportunity is depends upon the manner the evidence
is offered.
(a) Objection to the offer of evidence must be made
orally immediately after the offer is made (Sec. 36, par. 1,
Rule 132, Rules of Court).
(b) An objection to the testimony of a witness for
lack of a formal offer must be made as soon as the witness
begins to testify (Sec. 36, par. 2, ibid.)
2.

By objecting as soon as the question was completed,
counsel has succeeded in preventing the witness, Mr.
Santos, from introducing a hearsay answer into the records
of the case. The nature of the question manifestly required a
hearsay answer, and so the ground for the objection became
apparent as soon as the question was asked. In this situation,
an objection made after the witness has answered would come
too late.
6. There are witnesses who are quick to answer even
before the question ia over. Before the adverse counsel can
react and object to the question the answer comes in rapid-

1

fire fashion preventing counsel from inserting himself neatly
between the question and the answer. What does counsel do in
this case? Counsel must, nevertheless, object, state his reasons,
and move to strike out the answer. This is a technique which
the lawyer avails of when he does not have the opportunity to
object before the witness responds. Should the witness persist
in giving lightning-quick responses, counsel should request
the judge to direct the witness to allow opposing counsel to
object prior to his answer.

The provisions of the Rules of Court are explicit: “Should
a witness answer the question before the adverse party had
the opportunity to voice fully its objection to the same... and
such objection is found to be meritorious, the court shall
sustain the objection and order the answer... to be stricken off
the record” (Sec. 39, Rule 132, Rules of Court).
Striking out an answer, testimony, or narration

1. A motion to strike may be availed of in the following
instances:
(a) when the answer is premature;
(b) when the answer of the witness is irrelevant,
incompetent or otherwise improper;

CHAPTER VII -OFFER OF EVIDENCE
AND TRIAL OBJECTIONS

391

(Rule 132)

2. Sometimes, an apparently unobjectionable question
brings out an objectionable and inadmissible response. But
the infirmity of the response becomes apparent only after it
is completed. If the answer is damaging, then relief may be
obtained by a motion to strike.

3. Consider this example where the grounds for
objection are not manifested by the question. The witness is
examined by the prosecutor. The case is one for homicide and
the information says the crime was committed in Town A.
The witness is presented to testify that he knows that it was
indeed the accused who killed the victim.
Q: Do you know the victim?

A- Yes, Sir.
Q: Do you also know the accused?
A I do, Sir.
(A few more questions are asked)
Q: Where were you on the date and time when
the killing of the victim happened? (There is no
apparent impropriety in this question.)

(d) when the witness testifies without a question
being posed;

I was in Town B, Sir. (Opposing counsel does
not have to react immediately to the answer
because counsel should allow the witness’ lack
of personal knowledge to have an impact on the
listener).

(e) when the witness testifies beyond the limits set
by the court;

Q: How do you know it was the accused who killed
the victim?

(f) when the witness does a narration instead of
answering the question;

A A witness to the killing told me a day after the
incident. (The infirmity of the question is now

(c) when the answer is unresponsive;

party; or
(h) when the testimony was allowed conditionally

A:

Opposing Counsel: I object, your Honor!
Hearsay! I move to strike out the answer and
disqualify the witness from testifying on the
details of the incident. It is obvious that he is
incompetent for lack of personal knowledge.

CHAPTER VII -OFFER OF EVIDENCE
AND TRIAL OBJECTIONS

393

(Rule 132)

4. An objection to a witness’ disqualification in general
must be made as soon as he is called to the stand and before
his examination begins, provided his disqualification is then
known (Wigmore, Evidence, Vol. I, p. 323). A husband accused
of robbery, for instance, can object the moment his wife is
called by the prosecution to testify against him without his
consent on the basis of Sec. 23 or Sec. 24(a) of Rule 130.
Waiver of objections; belated objections (Bar 2004)

1. It is a rule of evidence that any objection against
the admission of any piece of evidence must be made at the
proper time, and that, if not so made, it will be understood to
have been waived. The proper time to make a protest or an
objection is when, from the question addressed to the witness,
or from the answer thereto, or from presentation of the proof,
the inadmissibility of the evidence is, or may be, inferred
(People v. Del Rosario, 642 SCRA 625, 635, February 9, 2011).
The term “waiver” implies the existence of a right, claim,
privilege or something one is entitled to. It is, by its nature, a
unilateral act. It need not, however, be a positive act. A waiver
may result from failure to perform an act. When the claim,
right, or privilege is abandoned, repudiated, renounced or not
asserted, there is a waiver.
Applied to objections, there is a waiver when there is
failure to point out some defect, irregularity or wrong in the
admission or exclusion of evidence. Such failure may take
various forms and may either be expressed or implied. “A
party may by his acts or omissions, waive or be estopped to
make objections to the admission or exclusion of the evidence.
Such waiver or estoppel may arise from failure to object . . .
from acts done or omitted before the evidence is offered, as
by failure to object to previous similar evidence ... or from
some affirmative act done after the ruling on the evidence” (88
C.J.S., 229).
2. Failure to assert an objection promptly and
specifically is a waiver (McCormick, Evidence, 3rd Ed., p. 141).
Unless a timely and sufficient objection is made to an evidence

introduced, the reviewing court will not ordinarily consider
the question of the propriety of the admission of the evidence
(75 Am Jur 2d, 3rd Ed., p. 252). It will not be considered on
appeal because there is deemed to be a waiver.

Failure to object to an offer of evidence is a waiver of the
objection. For instance, even assuming ex gratia argumenti
that certain documents are inadmissible for being hearsay, the
same may be admitted on account of failure to object thereto
(Manliclic v. Calaunan, 512 SCRA 642; People v. Martin, 543
SCRA 143).
3. In one case, no objection was made to the testimony
of the adverse witness from the time the testimony was offered
and up to the time the direct examination was conducted. Any
subsequent attempts to have the testimony of the witness
excluded for being hearsay, held the Court, have no grounds
to stand on but while the testimony is admissible, it does
not necessarily follow that the same should be given weight.
Admissibility of evidence should not be equated with weight
of evidence (Bayani u. People, 530 SCRA 84).
In another case, counsel was deemed to have waived his
objection in failing to object to a hearsay testimony which has
become admissible because of the failure to object (People v.
Martin, 543 SCRA 143).
4. Where a continuing objection had been interposed on
prohibited testimony, the objection is deemed waived where
the objecting counsel cross-examined the witness on the very
matters subject of the prohibition (Abraham v. Kasten, 114
Phil. 239).
Extent of waiver for failure to object
1. When an objection to evidence is deemed waived,
what exactly does the non-objecting party waive? Answer: He
waives objections to its admissibility (88 C.J.S. 230). In plain
language, the evidence becomes admissible but the waiver
involves no admission that the evidence possesses the weight
attributed to it by the offering party.

894

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

2. A waiver should not be construed as an admission
that the evidence is credible. It does not also mean that the
non-objecting party waives his right to present controverting
evidence. It only involves waiver of objection to two matters,
namely, the relevance and the competence of the evidence. Why
is this so? Because these are the components of admissibility
and this is what Sec. 3, Rule 128 of the Rules of Court tells us.
The pertinent provision reads:
“SEC. 3. Admissibility of evidence. — Evidence is
admissible when it is relevant to the issue and is not
excluded by the Constitution, the law or these rules.”

For example, failure to object would involve a waiver
of objections “that the evidence introduced is not the best
evidence, that it is hearsay, that there is a variance between
the evidence and pleadings . . .” (88 C.J.S. 231), or that the
witness is disqualified by reason of marriage or filial relation.
Again, it would be helpful to nag ourselves with the reminder
that the lack of objection merely makes incompetent evidence

admissible.
The Court once held: “. .. admissibility of evidence should
not be equated with weight of evidence” (People v. Valero, 112
SCRA 661; De la Torre v. Court of Appeals, 294 SCRA 196).
3. The rule of waiver by failure to object applies also
to the admission of documentary evidence. Failure to object
waives an objection that there was an irregularity in the
taking of an affidavit or deposition, that the document is not
what it purports to be on its face, or that it is not relevant.
Introducing a note in evidence without objection dispenses
with the necessity of proving the signatures on the note, or of
its execution (88 CJ.S. 234).
4. The admissibility of hearsay evidence, when not
objected to, should not, in any case, be confused with the
credibility or the weight of the admitted evidence. The absence
of an objection makes hearsay evidence admissible because
it has assumed the character of evidence but, other than
becoming evidence, no special characteristic is conferred upon

it by the waiver. Its inherent nature as wanting in the indicia
of trustworthiness required of credible evidence remains.
Thus, on many occasions, the Supreme Court has consistently
ruled that “hearsay evidence whether objected to or not has no
probative value” (People v. Nebreja, 203 SCRA 45), unless the
proponent can show that it falls within the exception to the
hearsay rule (People u. Villauiray, 262 SCRA 13). Although
hearsay evidence may be admitted without objection by the
adverse party’s counsel, it is, nonetheless, without probative
value.
Rulings on objections

1. The ruling of the court must be given immediately
after the objection is made except when the court desires
to take a reasonable time to inform itself on the question
presented. However, the court must give its ruling during the
trial and at such time as will give a party an opportunity to
meet the situation presented by the ruling (Sec. 38, Rule 132,
Rules of Court).
2. As early as Lopez u. Valdez, 32 Phil. 644, the Court
has bewailed the erroneous manner by which courts have
ruled on an objection. Here, counsel for the defendant objected
to certain questions propounded by counsel for the plaintiff
The questions were designed to elicit testimony that would
prove the contents of certain documents without laying a
proper foundation for the questions. Of course, there was a
valid ground to object because the examining counsel was
offering secondary evidence without first establishing the
existence, due execution and eventual loss or destruction of
the originals.

The trial court, in rulingon the objection merely in essence,
said that the objection “will be taken into consideration.'The
court, nevertheless, allowed the witnesses to testify over the
objection of the counsel for thedefendant. U ntil the termination
of the trial, no definitive ruling on the objection was made
even if several objections have been repeatedly made.

396

CHAPTER VH- OFFER OF EVIDENCE
AND TRIAL OBJECTIONS

397

(Rule 132)

The Supreme Court, speaking through Justice More¬
land, held that the words, “the objection will be taken into
consideration,” is prejudicial to the interests of a litigant since
it deprives the party against whom the ruling was made an
opportunity to meet the situation presented by the ruling. The
Court considered the act of the trial court as reversible error
having resulted in serious prejudice to the substantial rights
of the objecting party.
3. If the court fails to rule on the objection, the same
should be brought to the attention of the court. Another case
that could aptly show an improper ruling, although not as
well-known but is likewise as illustrative as Lopez, is People u.
Singh, 45 Phil. 676. Unlike Lopez which is a civil case, Singh
is a criminal case.

Here, Singh was alleged to have extrajudicially confessed
to a friend the killing of the victim. Later, that friend became
a prosecution witness and testified as to what Singh told him.
Singh moved to strike out the testimony on the ground of the
absence of evidence that the alleged confession was made
freely and voluntarily. As in Lopez, the court in Singh did
not rule on the objection and merely took the motion “under
advisement.” In deciding the case against Singh, the objected
testimony was taken “into consideration.” Upon Singh’s
conviction, an appeal was made and one of the assigned errors
of the trial court was its failure to rule on the motion to strike.
Significantly, the Supreme Court ruled: “If as a result of the
failure of the trial court to promptly rule upon a motion to
strike a confession from the record, the accused has been
deprived of the opportunity to present evidence in rebuttal of
such confession, that fact should be brought to the attention of
the trial court through the appropriate motions.”
4. Words like “submitted” or "the objections are noted”
are, by common reason, not appropriate rulings and neither
sustains or overrules the objection. There is no need to
stretch the rules of logic to deduce a ruling that the evidence
is “admitted for whatever they may be worth" or that the
"evidence is admitted subject to the objections" are not rulings
on the admissibility or inadmissibility of the evidence.

5. When a counsel asks a question and the other
objects, the court rules on the objection by either sustaining
or overruling the objection.
Let us assume the judge rules, “Sustained." What does

When the objection is overruled, this means that for the
court, the question is proper and the witness will be allowed
to answer.
6. Let us suppose that our fact pattern involves an
action for breach of contract. The plaintiff wants to prove the
contents of the agreement through an offer of a photocopy of
the same. Without laying the basis for the admissibility of
the copy, counsel seeks to offer the copy in evidence. Let us
assume that the other counsel objects and that the objection
is sustained. What is the significance of the court’s sustaining
of the objection? This means the court considers the document
inadmissible because it is incompetent In our example, the
incompetence is based on the original document rule which
requires the offer of the original document when the subject of
inquiry is the contents of a document (Sec. 3, Rule 130, Rules
of Court).
7. The ruling of the court sustaining or overruling the
objection need not be stated except if the objection is based on
two or more grounds. In such a case, a ruling sustaining the
objection must specify the ground or grounds relied upon (Sec.
38, Rule 132, ibid.).
Repetition of objections

It shall not be necessary to repeat an objection when
it becomes reasonably apparent, while the witness is being
examined, that he is asked questions which are of the same
class as those to which an objection has already been made.

398

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

whether such objection was sustained or overruled. Instead
of repeating the objection, it is sufficient for the objection
to be recorded as a “continuing objection” to such class of
objectionable questions (Sec. 37, ibid..).
Thus, when questions calling for a hearsay answer are
repetitiously asked by the adverse counsel, the recording of a
continuing objection to such questions would be in order after
an initial objection had already been made.
Tender of excluded evidence (offer of proof)
1. Assume that you have called your witness to the
stand. He takes his oath and proceeds to testify. You are
certain your witness will pull through. He is sharp and
responsive. His demeanor projects sincerity. Everything is
going on as planned. Then, from the right end of the table
screams the opposing counsel, “Objection, Your Honor!” The
objection comes unexpectedly. Before you could say a word the
judge rules, “Sustained!” The ruling feels like a laser-guided
missile aimed straight at the heart of your client’s case. You
spring from your chair and move to reconsider the ruling.
“Motion denied,” the judge again rules.
You did not prepare for this scenario. You thought
everything has been planned. You came to court with an
armload of copies of the latest jurisprudence on your case,
bound and carefully tabbed, to reveal to the court the gems of
wisdom you will hurl against the “enemy” seated at the other
end of the table. Your supposedly well-oiled examination is
now sputtering like a badly-tuned engine. Your witness has
been stopped right on his tracks. But you are not rattled.
Instead, you are seething with anger. You want to kick the
table in front of you. You cannot get critical testimony heard
by the judge who just declared with finality that he refuses to
hear from your witness. You are certain the judge is in error.
You are determined to turn it around in case you cannot save
your client from the mistake of the trial court.
A situation like the one just described is not infrequent
and does occur when you least expect it. It happens to all of

(Rule 132)

us. This is not a heartbreaking episode in your legal career. It
is not a reason to throw in the towel. You do not have to feel
the horror of failing to figure out the right remedy. This is not
a problem at all. As we usually say, “This is a piece of cake.
Peanuts. Chicken feed. Child’s play.” Indeed it is. Calm down.
This is not panic time.
So what do you do if you are the victim of an objection

sustained by the trial court or of a motion to strike granted on
a testimony that is crucial to your cause of action or defense?

The answer: make a “tender of excluded evidence.” What do
our rules say on the matter? Clearly, they provide:
“SEC. 40. Tender of excluded evidence. — If
documents or things offered in evidence are excluded
by the court, the offeror may have the same attached to
or made part of the record. If the evidence excluded is
oral, the offeror may state for the record the name and
other personal circumstances of the witness and the
substance of the proposed testimony.”

2. The foregoing rule, called “offer of proof in other
jurisdictions, embodies the procedure for the “tender of
excluded evidence.” Why make a tender of excluded evidence?
You do it for two reasons. First, to allow the coin! to know
the nature of the testimony or the documentary evidence and
convince the trial judge to permit the evidence or testimony.
Second, even if he is not convinced to reverse his earlier ruling,
the tender is made to create and preserve a record for appeal.
3. How is the tender done? The procedure depends upon
the type of evidence excluded. Where the evidence involved is
documentary or object evidence, the tender is made by having
the document or object attached to or made part of the record
(Sec. 40, ibid.).
Even if the rules do not spell out the details on how
this should be done, it is a common practice, in almost all
jurisdictions, for the offering counsel to produce, describe,
identify the object or document, and in case of the latter,
to state the contents of the document that is sought to be

400

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

CHAPTER vn - OFFER OF EVIDENCE
AND TRIAL OBJECTIONS

401

(Rule 132)

admitted where the substance of the same is not apparent
on its face. Reading the substance of the document is an
accepted way of stating its contents for the record in states
which recognize a tender. A disclosure of the contents of the
document is necessary in order to aid the court in determining
its competence and relevance.
The next step is to state the purpose for which the object
or document sought to be attached is offered, and to ask that it
be marked for identification and have it attached to the record.
For example, counsel may state after manifesting to make
a tender of excluded evidence: ‘Your Honor, this document is
a deed of sale executed between the plaintiff and defendant on
such and such date in the presence of both the town mayor and
vice-mayor who signed the deed as witnesses, and notarized
before Notary Public so and so. The document reads: (Counsel
reads the document). With this document, we intend to prove
that the defendant bought the parcel of land herein described
prior to taking possession of the property as owner on such
and such date. We request that this document be marked and
attached to and made part of the records of this case.”
4. If the evidence excluded is testimonial, the offeror
may state for the record the name and other personal
circumstances of the witness and the substance of the proposed
testimony (Ibid.).
Two traditional methods of making the tender

The first traditional method of making the tender is
where the counsel tells the court what the proposed testimony
will be. This is the method prescribed in the Rules of Court.
After stating for the record the name and other personal
circumstances of the witness, counsel, for instance, says:

Counsel: Defendant, Your Honor, makes this tender
of excluded evidence. If permitted to testify, defendant
will affirm that he was allowed by the plaintiff to build a
house in the former’s land; that the witness knows about
this fact because the plaintiff granted this permission to

him personally; that the permission was given on (date),
in (place) at approximately (time), and in the presence
of the plaintiff’s neighbor and wife who interposed no
objection to the grant of permission.
The second method is by using the question and answer
To illustrate:

Counsel: Your Honor, if allowed to ask the question
objected to, the testimony would have been as follows:
Q: Why did you construct a house on the plaintiff’s
land?

A: Because he allowed me to do so, Sir.
Q: When and where was the permission granted?

A: On (date), in (place) at around (time), Sir.
Q: How was the permission granted?
A: It was orally granted.
Q: Who were present, if any, when plaintiff gave
you the permission to build a house on the land?
A: (Witness gives the names of witnesses)
The first method has the advantage of brevity and
efficiency but it does not create as clear a record as the second
method. Whichever method is to be used lies in the discretion
of the trial court. The court may prefer the second method
which, although not described in the rules, is not prohibited.
In fact, the use of the first method is not mandatory. This
is evident from the use of the word may, instead of shall, in
Sec. 40 of Rule 132. Whichever method of tender is used, the
advocate must see to it that the offer must be specific enough
to contain the facts and circumstances of the matter sought to
be proved by the excluded evidence.

The tender is not meant to be a mere manifestation to
the court in mere general terms. It must not be in the form of
conclusions of fact such as, “If permitted to pursue this line of

402

EVIDENCE
(The Bar Lectures Series)

questioning, Your Honor, the witness will testify that he is not
a trespasser.” The offer must make reference to the details of
the excluded testimony or excluded document.

5. An erroneous way of making an offer of excluded
testimony is to make a mere general “offer of proof’ (tender
of excluded evidence) without producing the witness or
stating the evidence whereby the fact in issue is to be proved
(Douillard v. Wood [1942], 20 C2d 670, 128 P2d 6).
6. May an objection be interposed to the manner of
tender of excluded evidence? The rules are silent on the issue.
However, there is no cogent reason to disallow the objection.
If the document tendered is not described or identified, its
substance stated in vague and general terms or when the
purpose for which it is offered is not declared, then the evidence
has to be objected to. If the testimony tendered is in the form of
a conclusion and, thus, fails to disclose sufficient information
to enable the court and the other party to determine its
admissibility, the same may, likewise, be the target of an
objection. To have a contrary rule and confer immunity from
objection to such type of evidence would be to grant a favored
status to evidence initially excluded by the trial court.

Formal offer of evidence and formal offer of proof (Bar 1991)

Formal offer of evidence refers either to the offer of
the testimony of a witness prior to the latter’s testimony,
or the offer of the documentary and object evidence after a
party has presented his testimonial evidence. Loosely, it has
been referred to as formal offer of exhibits where object and
documentary evidences are to be offered.

Offer of proof is the process by which a proponent of an
excluded evidence tenders the same. If what has been excluded
is testimonial evidence, the tender is made by stating for the
record the name and other personal circumstances of the
proposed witness and the substance of his proposed testimony.
If the evidence excluded is documentary or of things, the offer
of proof is made by having the same attached to or made a
part of the record.

Additional evidence after case is rested

The Rules of Court does not prohibit a party from
requesting the court to allow it to present additional evidence
even after it hasrested its case. Any such opportunity, however,
for the ultimate purpose of the admission of additional
evidence is already addressed to the sound discretion of the
court (Republic v. Sandiganbayan [Fourth Division], 662
SCRA 152, 184, December 13, 2011).
Generally, additional evidence is allowed when it is newly
discovered, or where it has been omitted through inadvertence
or mistake, or where the purpose of the evidence is to correct
evidence previously offered (Lopez v. Liboro, 81 Phil. 431,

434).
