PREFACE TO THE FIFTH (2020} EDITION
My practice has been to come up with new editions
every two years. My previous edition, the Fifth Edition, came
out in 2019 so the sixth edition would not have been
published until 2021. I was confident that the 2019 edition
would still serve the bar reviewees in good stead for the 2020
bar since the Proposed 2019 Amendments to the Rules of
Civil Procedure and Evidence, which were approved by the
Supreme Court, would become effective only in 1 May 2020,
well beyond the cut-off date of 30 June 2019.
However at around March of this year, the Supreme
Court issued its bulletin on the remedial law bar exam..
examination which surprisingly included the proposed
2019 amendments in the bar exam coverage. Because
the 2019 amendments virtually revised the Rules of Civil
Procedure and the Rules on Evidence and because of the
dearth of literature on the 2019 amendments due to its
recency, I felt I could be of some help to the bar reviewees
if I updated my book to reflect the 2019 amendments and
explain these amendments and their impact on the Rules
of Civil Procedure and the Rules on Evidence. The
lockdown imposed by the government as a result of the
COVID 19 crisis gave me adequate time to work on the
2020 edition.
The present edition continues the use of the Q&A
format which serves the dual purpose of not only
refreshing the reader's knowledge of legal theory but also
hones and sharpens his or her test-taking skills of factpattern recognition, analogy, and deduction. I have always
maintained that legal rules and case holdings are best
absorbed for deployment in the bar and law examinations
by studying them not in isolation but in the context of their
underlying fact-patterns.

The importance of acquainting oneself with the latest
jurisprudence and developments cannot be gainsaid and
hence salient Supreme Court cases and issuances as well
as pertinent statutes and rules have been surveyed up to
the period ending 30 June 2019. In briefing Supreme Court
cases, I have employed a Q&A format or what I would call
a "micro-digest." My purpose was to present the most
concise summary that I could considering the limited time
available to the reviewee. In so doing, I have on quite a
few occasions taken some liberties with the facts but
without detracting from the essence and integrity of the
case law illustrated.
While written primarily for the bar reviewee and the
lc;1w student preparing for the bar and law school
examinations, this book could also be of some help to
members of the bench and bar who may use it to refresh
and update their knowledge of remedial law.
The writing, revision, and updating of PrimerReviewer would not have been possible without the
support of my publisher Central Books. I thank its
President, Jose Paolo M. Sibal, for his generous support,
as well as the tireless Girlie Gonzales for her guidance and
assistance in the printing and publication process.
Finally, I want to express my deep appreciation for
the unwavering encouragement and support of my wife
and my Muse, Atty. Hazel E. Rebadulla Riguera, and of my
children, Julliard Marie, Svetlana, and Dmitri. They have
been my beacon and inspiration all throughout these years
of writing and revising my book.

INTRODUCTION
Q.

What do you understand by remedial law?

A.

Remedial law is that branch of law which provides for
the jurisdiction of courts and the rules concerning
pleading, practice, and procedure before the courts.

Q.

What are the primary sources of remedial law?

A.

The primary sources of remedial law are the following:
1)

B.P. Big. 129 (Judiciary Reorganization Act of
1981) and other special laws which provide for
the jurisdiction of the courts.

2) The Rules of Court.
3)

Decisions of the Supreme Court.

4)

Circulars, Resolutions, and other administrative
issuances of the Supreme Court.

5)

The Constitution, particularly Article VIII of the
Constitution on the judiciary.

Q.

May Congress repeal, alter, or supplement rules
concerning pleading, practice, and procedure?

A.

No. The power of Congress under the 1933 and
1973 Constitutioris to repeal, alter, or supplement
rules concerning pleading, practice, and procedure
was taken away in the 1987 Constitution.
(Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice, G.R. No.
132601, 19 January 1999; ISAGANI A. CRUZ,
PHILIPPINE POLITICAL LAW 246 [1989 ed.]).

REMEDIAL LAW

Q. The GSIS argued that it is exempt from the
payment of docket and legal fees by virtue of
R.A. No. 8291 which exempts it from "all taxes,
assessments, fees, charges or duties of all
kinds." Is the GSIS correct?

A.

No. In In Re: Petition for Recognition of the
Exemption of the Government Service Insurance
System from Payment of Legal Fees (A.M. No. 082-01-0, February 11, 2010. A.M. No. 08-2-01-0,
February 11, 2010), the Court ruled that the
provision in the Charter of the GSIS, i.e., Section
39 of Republic Act No. 8291, which exempts it from
"all taxes, assessments, fees, charges or duties of
all kinds," cannot operate to exempt it from the
payment of legal fees. This was because, unlike the
1935 and 1973 Constitutions, which empowered
Congress to repeal, alter or supplement the rules of
the Supreme Court concerning pleading, practice
and procedure, the 1987 Constitution removed this
power from Congress. Hence, the Supreme Court
now has the sole authority to promulgate rules
concerning pleading, practice and procedure in all
courts. (GSIS v. Caballero, G.R. No. 158090, 4
October 2010). Under S22 R141, while the
Republic of the Philippines and its agencies and
instrumentalities are exempt from paying legal fees,
local governments and GOCCs with or without
independent charters are not so exempt.

Q. How are actions or proceedings classified?

A.

According to subject matter:
1) Real action.
2) Personal action.
2

J9JC9B0M

INTRODUCTION

According to binding effect
1) Action/proceeding in rem.
2) Action in personam.
3) Action quasi in rem.
Q. Define a real action and a personal action.
A.

A real action is one which affects title to or
possession of real property or interest therein. (S1
R4). A personal action is one which does not affect
title to or possession of real property or interest
therein. (S2 R4).

Q. Give examples of real actions.

A.

1) Action to recover ownership or possession of land.
2) Foreclosure of real estate mortgage.
3) Partition.
4) Ejectment.

Q.

Give examples of personal actions.

A.

1) Action to recover ownership or possession of
personal property.
2) Action for specific performance.
3) Action for collection of sum of money.

Q.

What is the importance or practical significance
of distinguishing between a real action and a
personal action?

A.

The distinction is important for purposes of
determining the venue of the action and the court
having subject matter jurisdiction thereof.
3

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

The venue of real actions is the proper court
which has jurisdiction over the area wherein the
real property involved, or a portion thereof, is
situated. (S1 R4). On the other hand, venue of
personal actions lies in the place where the plaintiff
or any of the principal plaintiffs resides or where the
defendant or any of the principal defendant resides
at the election of the plaintiff. (S2 R4).
Jurisdiction over real actions depends upon
the assessed value of the real property involved.
(See S19[2] BP Big. 129).
Jurisdiction over
personal actions depends upon the amount of the
claim or demand (See S19[3] BP Big. 129)
provided that if the subject of the litigation is
incapable of pecuniary estimation, jurisdiction is
vested in the RTC.
Q. Define an action in rem.

A. An action or proceeding in rem is one which is not
directed against a particular person but on the thing
or res itself and which asks the court to make a
declaration of or to dispose of or deal with the res.
The thing or res may be personal or real property or
it may be a status, right, or particular fact.
Q. Give examples of action or proceedings in rem.

A.
1) Application for original registration of a parcel
of land.
2)

Special proceedings, the object of which
is to
establish the res, i.e., status, right, or
particular fact.

3)

Petition for declaration of insolvency.
4

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

INTRODUCTION

Q.

4)

Escheat proceedings.

5)

Petition for change of name under R103.

What is an action in personam?

A. An action in personam is one which is directed
against particular persons and seeks a relief which
would be binding only upon such particular
persons. Examples are action for a sum of money
or for specific performance.
Q. What is an action quasi in rem?

A. An action quasi in rem is one which is directed against
particular persons but seeks to reach and dispose of
or deal with their property located in the Philippines.
(Midgely v Hon. Fernando, 13 May 1975). It is similar
to an action in rem in that the purpose is to dispose of
or deal with property (res) in the Philippines.
However like an action in personam, it is brought
against particular persons and the judgment therein is
binding only upon the parties thereto. (San Pedro v.
Ong, G.R. No. 177598, 17 October 2008).
Q.

Give examples of actions quasi in rem.

A.

1) Judicial foreclosure of mortgage.
2) Action in personam in which property of the
defendant has been attached. The attachment
converts the action to one quasi in rem.
(Citizen's Surety & Insurance Co. v. MelencioHerrera, 38 SCRA 369).
3) Action for partition and accounting. (Valmonte
v. CA, 252 SCRA 93, 102).

5

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

4)

Action to quiet title and to remove cloud.
(San Pedro v. Ong, G.R. No. 177598, 17
October 2008).

5) Action for partition.
Q.

Is an action for ejectment an action quasi in rem
or in personam?

A.

It is an action in personam since the action is
binding only between the parties. (Domagas v.
Jensen, G.R. 158407, 17 January 2005). It is
submitted that the action is one quasi in rem since
the real object is to exclude the defendant from
possessory interest over the property and hence
extraterritorial service may be availed of. Whether
characterized as in personam or quasi in rem, the
judgment in an ejectment suit is binding only
between the parties.

Q.

Is an action to recover title to or possession of
real property an action in personam or an action
quasi in rem?

A.

It is a real action but an action in personam.
(Republic v. Court of Appeals, 315 SCRA 600). For
the same reasons as stated in the preceding
answer, it is submitted that the action is one quasi
1
in rem. (See de Midgely v. Ferandos, 13 May
1975, where the issue was the applicability of S 17
R14 and where the Court stated that the action for
reconveyance of land was an action quasi in rem).

1

See de Midgely v. Ferandos, 13 May 1975, where the issue was the
applicability of S17 R14 and where the Court staled that the action for reconveyance
of land was an action quasi in rem.

INTRODUCTION

Q.

What is the importance of distinguishing an
action in personam from an action in rem or
quasi in rem?

A.

Extraterritorial service under S17 R14 may be
effected in actions in rem or quasi in rem but not in
an action in personam. (Valmonte v. CA, 252 SCRA
93,100). On the other hand, S16 and S18 of R14
apply to any action, including actions in personam.
In preliminary attachment, the requirement of
prior or contemporaneous service of summons shall
not apply where the action is in rem or quasi in rem.
(S5 R57).

7

JURISDICTION
Q.

Define the term jurisdiction.

A. Jurisdiction may be understood in three senses:
subject-matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, and
jurisdiction over the res.
Subject-matter jurisdiction is the authority and
power of the court to hear and determine cases of
the general class to which the proceeding in
question belongs. (Diocese of Bacolod v. COMELEC,
21 January 2015). For instance the jurisdiction of
the regional trial court over cases where the subject
of the litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation.
Personal jurisdiction is the power of the court
to bind a party or person. Jurisdiction over the
plaintiff or petitioner is acquired by the filing of the
complaint or petition. Jurisdiction over the defendant
is obtained by service of summons or his voluntary
appearance.
Jurisdiction over the res is the power of the
court to try a case which would bind real or personal
property or determine the status of a party.
Q.

What is meant by original and appellate
jurisdiction and exclusive and concurrent
jurisdiction?

A. Original jurisdiction is that exercised by a court or
body in the first instance, as for instance the
jurisdiction of the MTC over ejectment cases.
Appellate jurisdiction is that exercised by a
court or body over a case elevated to it by way of
review. An example is the jurisdiction by the Court
8

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

JURISDICTION

of Appeals over cases decided by the Regional
Trial Court and elevated to the Court of Appeals
for review.
Exclusive jurisdiction is that jurisdiction
exercised by a court or body to the exclusion of all
other courts. An example is the jurisdiction of the
Regional Trial Court over cases incapable of
pecuniary estimation.
Concurrent jurisdiction is that jurisdiction
exercised over a case or subject matter by two or
more courts or bodies. An example is a special civil
action for certiorari jurisdiction over which may be
exercised by the RTC, CA, and Supreme Court.
Q.

Outline the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in

(Note: See Sec. 7 of RA 1125 as amended by
RA 9282 which grants the CTA exclusive appellate
jurisdiction over RTC decisions in local tax cases, tax
crime cases, and tax collection cases).

Q.

Does the Court of Appeals have the power to try
cases and conduct hearings, receive evidence
and perform acts necessary to resolve factual
issues?

A.

Under Section 9 of B.P. Big. 129, the Court of
Appeals has the power to try cases and conduct
hearings, receive evidence, and perform acts
necessary to resolve factual issues in cases falling
14

J9JC9B0M

JURISDICTION

within its original and appellate jurisdiction,
including the power to grant and conduct new trials
or further proceedings.
The Supreme Court however has held that the
CA's power to receive evidence is qualified by the
CA's internal rules. Hence in accordance with such
rules, in appeals in civil cases, the CA may receive
evidence only when it grants a new trial based on
newly discovered evidence. (Crispino v. Tansay, 5
Dec 2016, Leanen, J.).
Q.

An appellant in a civil case pending in the Court
of Appeals filed a motion for the reception of
specified evidence for the purpose of clarifying
facts already in the record in order that the
Court would be better able to resolve relevant
factual issues raised in the appeal. Will the
motion prosper? Why? (87 Bar Q6)

A. At the time the question was asked, the correct
answer was that the motion will not prosper since
Sec. 9 of B.P. Big. 129, as amended by E.O. No.
33, 28 July 1986, provided that the CA may receive
evidence in appealed cases only when a motion for
new trial on the ground of newly discovered
evidence was granted by it.
Sec. 9 was subsequently amended by R.A.
No. 7902 (approved 23 February 1995) and it
provided the Court of Appeals shall have the power
to try cases and conduct hearings, receive
evidence and perform any and all acts necessary to
resolve factual issues raised in cases falling within
its original and appellate jurisdiction, including the
power to grant and conduct new trials or further
proceedings. (S9 of B.P. Big. 129, as amended by
15
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

R.A. No. 7902, approved 23 February 1995). Since
under this rule, the power to receive evidence was
not circumscribed, the answer to the question
would have been that the motion will prosper.
However in Crispino v. Tansay, 5 December
2016, the Supreme Court held that the CA's power
to receive evidence is qualified by the CA's
internal rules. Hence in accordance with such rules,
in appeals in civil cases, the CA may receive
evidence only when it grants a new trial based on
newly-discovered evidence. In effect, Crispino
reverted to the rule under Sec. 9 of B.P. Big. 129,
as amended by E.O. No. 33.
Thus the answer to the question is that the
motion will not prosper.

Q.

Petitioners bought a parcel of land from private
respondent lucky Homes, Inc. Said lot was
specifically denominated in the deed of sale as
Lot 19 and was mortgaged to the SSS as
security for Petitioners' housing loan. Petitioners
started the construction of their house on Lot 18
as the Private Respondent mistakenly identified
Lot 18 as Lot 19. Upon realizing its error, the

J9JC9B0M

JURISDICTION

Petitioners defaulted in their housing loan so
Lot 19 was foreclosed by the SSS and Petitioners'
title over the certificate of title was cancelled and
a new one issued in favor of the SSS. The
Petitioners then offered to swap Lot 18 and Lot 19
and demanded from Private Respondent that the
contract of sale be reformed to indicate Lot 18 as
the subject of the sale. Private Respondent
refused so the Petitioners filed an action for
reformation of contract against the Petitioner with
the RTC. After trial, the RTC rendered a decision
dismissing Petitioners' complaint for lack of merit
and ordering Petitioners to pay moral damages
and attorney's fees to the Private Respondent.
The judgment became final and a writ of
execution was issued. Petitioners opposed the
writ claiming that the RTC did not have
jurisdiction. Subsequently the Petitioners filed a
complaint with the HLURB involving the same
subject matter.
The Petitioners then filed with the Court of
Appeals a petition for annulment of the RTC
judgment under R47. The Petitioners contended
that the RTC did not have jurisdiction since
the subject matter of the case was a subdivision
lot and hence the jurisdiction lies with the
HLURB. May the Court of Appeals annul the
RTC decision?
A.

No. The Petitioners are estopped from challenging
the jurisdiction of the RTC. In the case at bar, it was
Petitioners themselves who invoked the jurisdiction
of the court a quo by instituting an action for
reformation of contract against Private Respondents.
It appears that, in the proceedings before the trial
court, Petitioners vigorously asserted their cause
23

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

from start to finish. Not even once did Petitioners
ever raise the issue of the court's jurisdiction during
the entire proceedings which lasted for two years.
It was only after the trial court rendered its decision
and issued a writ of execution against them
did Petitioners first raise the issue of jurisdiction and it was only because said decision was
unfavorable to them.
Petitioners thus effectively waived their right to
question the court's jurisdiction over the case they
themselves filed. The Court frowns upon the
undesirable practice of a party submitting his case
for decision and then accepting the judgment but
only if favorable, and attacking it for lack of
jurisdiction if not. ( Gonzaga v. Court of Appeals,
G.R. No. 144025, 27 December 2002).
Actions in which the subject of the litigation is
incapable of pecuniary estimation
Q.

Which court has exclusive original jurisdiction
over a civil action in which the subject of the
litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation?

A.

The Regional Trial Court pursuant to Sec. 19(1) of
B.P. Big. 129.

Q.

What is meant by a civil action in which the
subject of the litigation is incapable of
pecuniary estimation?

A.

Before defining an action incapable of pecuniary
estimation, it might be worthwhile to define first an
action which is capable of pecuniary estimation.
An action capable of pecuniary estimation is
one wherein the primary or principal relief sought is
24

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

JURISDICTION

a claim for a sum of money or the assertion of title
to or possession of personal or real property. In
such a case the action is capable of pecuniary
estimation based on the amount of the monetary
claim or the value of the personal or real property.
Conversely an action incapable of pecuniary
estimation is one wherein the primary or principal
relief sought is not a claim for a sum of money or
the assertion of title to or possession of personal or
real property but some other primary or principal
relief which cannot be valued in money terms.
Q.

Give examples of civil actions in which the
subject of the litigation is incapable of

Can a suit for injunction be aptly filed with the

jurisdiction over the same, exclusive
jurisdiction being vested in the RTC.

Q.

Is an action for quasi-delict
pecuniary estimation?

A.

No. An action for quasi-delict is capable of
pecuniary estimation based on the amount of the
damages being claimed. (/niego v. Purganan, G.R.
166876, 24 March 2006).

Q.

Plaintiff laundry company filed an action for
"breach of contract" with the RTC against the
defendants spouses who had entered into a
dealership contract with plaintiff. The plaintiff
averred that defendants failed to comply with the
term in the contract that they should supply to
plaintiff at least 200 kilos of laundry items per
week and that the defendants unilaterally ceased
operations in breach of the contract. The plaintiff
in its complaint sought the recovery of P280,000
damages as an "incidence and consequence" of
the breach of contract. Did the RTC have
jurisdiction over the complaint?

A.

No. An action for "breach of contract" is capable of
pecuniary estimation where damages sought did not
exceed P300,000. An analysis of the complaint
shows that the principal relief sought by the plaintiff is
the enforcement of the penal clause for liquidated
damages. Hence jurisdiction is with MTC. (Pajares v.
Remarkable Laundry, 20 Feb 2017, Del Castillo, J.).

validity and constitutionality of the rule. Does
the CA have jurisdiction over the action?

A.

No. Prohibition is not proper where the rule or
regulation was issued by the government agency
pursuant not to its quasi-judicial but to its quasilegislative power. It is the RTC which has original
and exclusive jurisdiction over the action which is
one for declaratory relief and therefore incapable of
pecuniary estimation. (Chairman PCSD v. Lim, 24
August 2016, Bersamin, J.).

Q.

Is an action for foreclosure of a real estate
mortgage an action incapable of pecuniary
estimation?

A.

No. It is a real action which affects the title to or
possession of the mortgaged realty as the foreclosure
sale would divest the mortgagor and the junior
encumbrancers of their title over the realty. Hence
jurisdiction is not exclusively with the RTC but with
the MTC or RTC depending upon the assessed value
of the realty mortgaged. (See also FERIA & NOCHE,
THE 1997 RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE:
PROVISIONAL REMEDIES AND SPECIAL CIVIL
ACTIONS 244 [2007 ed.]).
Another view is that a foreclosure suit over real
property is incapable of pecuniary estimation and
hence should be filed in the RTC. It is submitted
that the more persuasive view is to consider the
foreclosure suit as a real action with jurisdiction
depending upon the assessed value of the
property. The principal or ultimate relief sought in a
foreclosure suit is to divest the rights in the real
property of the defendants (mortgagors and junior

27

encumbrancers) and to vest their rights in the
purchaser. (S3 & S7 R68).
Q.

Is an action for partition of real property incapable
of pecuniary estimation?

A.

No. It is a real action capable of pecuniary
estimation, that is, the assessed value of the realty.
The ultimate purpose of partition is the distribution
and delivery of a specific portion of the property to
the co-owner. If the main purpose of the action
however is the annulment of a deed of partition and
declaration of heirs, with the partition of the
property merely being incidental to the main action,
the action is incapable of pecuniary estimation and
hence within the RTC's jurisdiction. (Russel v.
Vestil, 364 Phil. 392 [1999]).

Q.

A files an action in the Municipal Trial Court
against B, the natural son of A's father, for the
partition of a parcel of land located in Taytay,
Rizal, with an assessed value of P20,000. B
moves to dismiss the action on the ground that
the case should have been brought in the
Regional Trial Court because the action is one
that is not capable of pecuniary estimation as it
involves primarily a determination of hereditary
rights and not merely the bare right to real
property. Resolve the motion. (00 Bar Q1 Sb).

A.

The motion to dismiss should be denied. The MTC
has jurisdiction over real actions over land with an
assessed value not exceeding P20,000. An action
for partition is a real action; hence the MTC has
jurisdiction since the assessed value does not
exceed P20,000. (See Huguete v. Embudo, G.R.
No. 149554, 1 July 2003).

Q.

Clause 7 of the lease contract between the
Plaintiff lessor and the Defendant lessee granted
the latter, upon the expiration of the 10-year
lease contract, the right to purchase the building
subject of the lease and that should the
Defendant not exercise this right, the lease shall
be automatically renewed and that in case of
said renewal, the rental shall be adjusted by the
parties depending on the prevailing business
condition. The Defendant did not exercise his
right so he contended that the lease was
automatically renewed. On the other hand the_
Plaintiff contended that the lease could only be
automatically renewed upon a new agreement of
the parties. The Plaintiff filed with the municipal
court an action for unlawful detainer against the
Defendant. In his answer the Defendant raised
the issue that the municipal court did not have
jurisdiction since the action is incapable of
pecuniary estimation as the controversy hinges
on the interpretation of clause 7. Does. the
municipal court have jurisdiction?

A.

No. The complaint and the answer show that the
jugular vein of the controversy hinges on the
correct interpretation of clause 7 of the lease
contract. Hence the action was not for unlawful
detainer but one incapable of pecuniary estimation
and beyond the competence of the municipal
court.(Vda. de Murga v. Chan, 25 SCRA 441
[1968]; see however the next case of Union Bank v.
Maun/ad Homes, Inc.).

Q.

Union Bank as the owner of the Maunlad
Shopping Mall entered into a contract to sell
over the mall in favor of Maunlad Homes Inc. The
price was payable in installments and upon full

29
J9JC9B0M

Jl

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

payment Union Bank would execute a deed of
absolute sale in favor of Maunlad Homes. Under
the contract, in event of rescission due to failure
to pay or to violation of the contract, Maunlad
Homes would be immediately required to vacate
the property and turn over possession to Union
Bank. Maunlad Homes failed to pay succeeding
installments and so Union Bank served a notice
of rescission and then a notice to pay and vacate
which Maunlad Homes did not heed. Union Bank
filed an action for unlawful detainer with the
MeTC against Maunland Homes. Maunlad Homes
raised the defense that it was the owner of
the mall since Union Bank did not reserve
ownership in the contract. The MeTC dismissed
the action for lack of jurisdiction. The RTC and
the CA affirmed the MeTC's decision. The CA
ruled that Union Bank's cause of action is
premised on the interpretation of the contract
and the determination of the validity of the
rescission, both of which are matters beyond
the MeTC's jurisdiction. Did the MeTC have
jurisdiction over the case?
A.

Yes. In ejectment cases, the MTC has the
jurisdiction to preliminarily determine the issue of
ownership in order to determine the issue of
possession. The authority granted to the MeTC to
preliminarily resolve the issue of ownership to
determine the issue of possession ultimately allows
it to interpret and enforce the contract or agreement
between the plaintiff and the defendant. To deny
the MeTC jurisdiction over a complaint merely
because the issue of possession requires the
interpretation of a contract will effectively rule out

30

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

JURISDICTION

unlawful detainer as a remedy. In an action for
unlawful detainer, the defendant's right to possess
the property may be by virtue of a contract, express
or implied; corollarily, the termination of the
defendant's right to possess would be governed by
the terms of the same contract. Interpretation of the
contract between the plaintiff and the defendant is
inevitable because it is the contract that initially
granted the defendant the right to possess the
property; it is this same contract that the plaintiff
subsequently claims was violated or extinguished,
terminating the defendant's right to possess. ( Union
Bank v. Maun/ad Homes, Inc., G.R. 190071, 15
August 2012). (Note: The doctrine in Union Bank
overturns that laid down in Vda. de Murga v. Chan,
25 SCRA 441 ).
Q.

Plaintiff Lapitan filed with the CFI a complaint
against Scandia Inc. for rescission of contract
and for damages of PB,735. The complaint
alleges that Plaintiff bought from Defendant a 16horsepower ABC diesel engine for P3,735; that
he bought the same for running a rice and corn
mill; that Defendant had warranted that all spare
parts for said engine are kept in stock in its
stores; that the cam rocker of the engine broke
down due to faulty workmanship; that it took 2
months for Defendant to send him a replacement
part; and that the new part soon broke down
again. Plaintiff prayed for the rescission of the
contract, the reimbursement of the price, and
actual damages of P4,000. After filing its answer
disclaiming liability, the Defendant moved to
dismiss the complaint on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction since the amount claimed, PB,735, is
below the jurisdictional amount of P10,0000 and
31

PRIMER~REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

thus within the jurisdiction of the municipal
court. Should the trial court grant the motion
to dismiss?
A.

No. The subject matter of actions for rescission of
contracts is not capable of pecuniary estimation. If
an action is primarily for the recovery of a sum of
money, it is one capable of pecuniary estimation.
However where the basic issue is something other
than the right to recover a sum of money, or where
the money claim is purely incidental to, or a
consequence of, the principal relief sought, the
action would be one incapable of pecuniary
estimation. No award for damages may be had in
an action for rescission without first conducting an
inquiry into matters which would justify the setting
aside of a contract. (Lapitan v. Scandia, Inc., 24
SCRA 4 79 [1968]). It should be noted that the trial
court had to inquire into specific facts, i.e., whether
sufficient stock of spare parts was kept by
Defendant, in order to determine whether Plaintiff
was entitled to relief.

Q.

In 1969 Ortigas & Company, Ltd. and Samson
entered into an agreement whereby in
consideration of PSS,430 the former agreed to
sell to the latter a land with a condition that
should Samson complete the construction and
painting of his house on the lot within 2 years,
Ortigas & Company would agree to refund to
Samson the amount of P4,820. Upon failure of
Ortigas to pay its obligation, Samson filed a
complaint for sum of money and damages with
the City Court of Manila against Ortigas,
wherein Samson sought the refund of the
P4,820. Ortigas filed a motion to dismiss on the
ground that the City Court has no jurisdiction.

32

J9JC9B0M

JURISDICTION

Samson countered that the amount of
the refund claim is below the jurisdictional
amount of P10,000. Should the City Court
dismiss the complaint?

A. Yes. The action involved is one for specific
performance and not for a sum of money and
therefore incapable of pecuniary estimation. This is
because what Samson seeks is the performance of
Ortigas' obligation under a written contract to make
refund but under certain specific conditions still to
be proved or established. In the case for the
recovery of a sum of money, as the collection of a
debt, the claim is considered capable of pecuniary
estimation because the obligation to pay the debt is
not conditioned upon any specific fact or matter.
But when a party to a contract has agreed to refund
to the other party a sum of money upon compliance
by the latter of certain conditions and only upon
compliance therewith may what is legally due him
under the written contract be demanded, the action
is one not capable of pecuniary estimation. The
payment of a sum of money is only incidental which
can only be ordered after a determination of certain
acts the performance of which being the more basic
issue to be inquired into. ( Ortigas & Company, Ltd.
v. Herrera, 120 SCRA 89 [19831).
Q.

In the preceding question, would your answer
be the same if Ortigas & Company, Ltd. agreed
to refund Samson after 2 years from the
contract date and Samson filed a complaint
against Ortigas & Company for the refund?

A.

No, my answer would not be the same. Here the
refund of P4,820 is not conditioned upon any
specific fact or matter but upon the mere expiration
33

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

of 2 years from the execution of the contract.
Hence the action is capable of pecuniary estimation
and is within the jurisdiction of the City Court.
Q.

Which court has jurisdiction over expropriation
cases?

A. Jurisdiction over eminent domain cases lies with the
RTC. An expropriation case is one whose subject
matter is incapable of pecuniary estimation. The
subject of an expropriation case is the determination
of the government's right to take private property for
public use. (Brgy. San Roque v. Pastor, G.R.
138896, 20 June 2000).
Q.

Petitioners's father was granted a free patent
over land. The land was sold within the
prohibitory 5-year period by the father to
Respondent. Petitioners filed with the RTC of
Davao Oriental an action for repurchase against
Respondent based on Section 119 of the Public
Land Act. Respondent filed a motion to dismiss
on ground of lack of jurisdiction alleging that
the assessed value of the land does not exceed
P20,000. Rule on the motion.

A.

Motion to dismiss denied. The complaint to redeem
a land subject of a free patent is a civil action
incapable of pecuniary estimation. At first blush, it
appears that the action filed by petitioners involves
title to or possession of the lots he sold to
respondents. Since the total selling price is less
than PhP 20,000, then the MTC, not the RTC, has
jurisdiction over the case. This proposition is
incorrect for the re-acquisition of the lots by the
petitioners is but incidental to and an offshoot of the
exercise of the right by the latter to redeem said lots

pursuant to Sec. 119 of CA 141. The reconveyanc~
of the title to petitioners is solely dependent on the
exercise of such right to repurchase the lots in
question and is not the principal or main relief or
remedy sought. Thus, the action of petitioners is, in
reality, incapable of pecuniary estimation, and the
reconveyance of the lot is merely the outcome of
the performance of the obligation to return the
property conformably to the express provision of
CA 141. (Heirs of Bautista v. Lindo, 10 March 2014)

that the action to repurchase is a real action since
the ultimate objective is to obtain title or possession

The Supreme Court has held that even if the
action is one for specific performance but the ultimate
objective of the plaintiff is to obtain title to real
property, the action is a real action and not one
incapable of pecuniary estimation. (Ruby Shelters
Builders v. Formaran, G.R. No. 175914, 10 February
2009; Gochan v. Gochan, 423 Phil. 491 [2001]).
Here the ultimate objective of A was to obtain
title to the land. Hence the action is a real one and
since the assessed value does not exceed
P20,000, the MeTC has jurisdiction.
b) The Motion to Declare Defendant in Default
should be granted.
The Supreme Court has held that the
pendency of certiorari proceedings does not excuse
the defendant from filing an answer unless he has

Q.

Plaintiff filed an action for annulment of deed of
sale over land having an assessed value of
P20,000. A perusal of the complaint shows that
the ultimate objective of the Plaintiff is to obtain
title over the land. Which court would have
jurisdiction?

A. The MTC. A complaint for annulment of deed of sale
is not an action incapable of pecuniary estimation
where the ultimate objective of the Plaintiffs is to
obtain title to rea! property. In such a case it is a real
action and jurisdiction is determined by the assessed
value of the real property, not its market value.
Since the assessed value did not exceed P20,000, it
is the MTC which has jurisdiction. (Barangay Piapi v.
Talip, 7 September 2005).
Q.

A brings an action in the Metropolitan Trial
Court of Manila against B for the annulment of

not yet due. B timely moved to dismiss the case
on the ground that the action should have been
brought in the Regional Trial Court of Laguna.
Decide with reasons. (00 Bar Q 18a).

A.

Insofar as the motion to dismiss is based on lack of
subject-matter jurisdiction - since it argued that the
action should have been brought in the RTC - the
same should be denied.
38

J9JC9B0M

JURISDICTION

The action for annulment of the extrajudicial
foreclosure sale of real property is a real action
since there has been a foreclosure sale and thus
the action affects title to the real property mortgaged.
(See Chua v. Total Office Products & Services, 30
September 2005). Since the real action was brought
in Metro Manila and the assessed value does not
exceed PS0,000, it is the MTC which has jurisdiction.
Q.

0 entrusted the owner's duplicate certificate of
title No. 105602 over her lot to his broker X so as
to subdivide the lot. X subdivided the lot into
several titles. X forged the signature of O in a
deed of sale and sold one of the lots covered by
a title to B. B then sold the lot to C. A new
certificate of title No. 137466 was issued in the
name of C. 0 filed with the RTC an action for
cancellation of TCT No. 137466 of C and the
revival of TCT No. 105602. The complaint alleged
that the land was bought by C for P15,000.
Judgment was rendered in favor of 0. On appeal,
C moved to set aside the judgment on the
ground that the same was a real action and since
the value of the land was only P15,000, then the
RTC did not have jurisdiction. May the RTC's
judgment be set aside for lack of jurisdiction?

A.

Yes. An action for cancellation of TCT is a real action
where the court has two determine which of two
titles over the same lot is valid. In such a case,
jurisdiction depends upon assessed value. Since the
complaint did not allege the assessed value, the
RTC did not acquire jurisdiction. Lack of jurisdiction
may be raised at any stage even on appeal. (Pad/an
v. Dinglasan, 20 March 2013, Peralta, J.).

Q.

Petitioners filed an action for recovery of
possession of land against the Respondents
before the RTC of Baguio City. After trial,
judgment was rendered in favour of the
Petitioners. On appeal, the Respondents raised
for the first time the issue of lack of jurisdiction
contending that the assessed value of the subject
realty was not averred in the complaint. May the
Court of Appeals dismiss the complaint for lack
of jurisdiction?

A.

Yes. Based on Sections 19 and 33 of B.P. Big. 129, it
is clear that in an action for recovery of possession,
the assessed value of the property sought to be
recovered determines the court's jurisdiction.
Here, for the RTC to exercise jurisdiction, the
assessed value of the subject property must
exceed P20,000.00. Since petitioners failed to
allege in their Complaint the assessed value of the
subject property, the CA correctly dismissed the
Complaint as petitioners failed to establish that the
RTC had jurisdiction over it. In fact, since the
assessed value of the property was not alleged, it
cannot be determined which trial court had original
and exclusive jurisdiction over the case.
The fact that lack of jurisdiction was raised for
the first time on appeal is of no moment. The
defense of lack of jurisdiction over the subject
matter may be raised at any stage of the
proceedings, even for the first time on appeal.

JURISDICTION

Q.

The Court of Appeals dismissed, without
prejudice, the complaint for recovery of
possession and damages that the petitioner filed
before the Regional Trial Court of Kabankalan
City, Negros Oriental, because the complaint
failed to allege the assessed value of the
disputed property in the case. Attached to the
complaint however was a copy of a Declaration
of Real Property indicating that the assessed
value of the disputed property is P20, 790.00.
Was the CA's dismissal proper?

A.

No. The factual allegations in a complaint should
be considered in tandem with the statements and
inscriptions on the documents attached to it as
annexes or integral parts. The CA should have
considered the facts contained in the Declaration of
Real Property attached to the complaint in
determining whether the RTC had jurisdiction over
the petitioner's case. A mere reference to the
attached document could facially resolve the
question on jurisdiction and would have rendered
lengthy litigation on this point unnecessary.
(Tumpag v. Tumpag, 29 September 2014).

Q.

In 1998, Respondents filed with the RTC an
action for recovery of a 44-hectare parcel of
land against petitioner. The assessed value of
the land was not indicated in the complaint. The
petitioner filed a motion to dismiss on the
grounds that the action was for ejectment or
that if it was an accion publiciana, the court still
did not have jurisdiction since the assessed
value was not stated in the complaint. The RTC
denied the petitioner's motion to dismiss
holding that it had jurisdiction over the case
because the area of the subject properties was
41

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

44 hectares, more or less, and "it is safe to
presume that the value of the same is more than
P20,000." Was the denial of the motion to
dismiss proper?
A.

No. Jurisdiction is conferred by law. It cannot be
presumed.
When respondents filed the complaint in 1998,
RA 7691 was already in force as it was approved
on March 25, 1994 and took effect on April 15,
1994. As such, it is necessary that the assessed
value of the subject properties, or its adjacent lots
(if the properties are not declared for taxation
purposes ) be alleged to ascertain which court has
jurisdiction over the case.
Despite the fact that the parcel of land was 44
hectares, it was error for the trial court to take
cognizance of the case on a presumption. The
reason is that jurisdiction cannot be presumed or
conferred by the agreement of the parties.
(Regalado v. Dela Rama, 13 December 2017,
Del Castillo, J.).

Q.

Plaintiff filed with the MTC a case for unlawful
detainer against the Defendant. The Plaintiff
averred that he had bought the property from
the seller but had found the Defendant staying
thereon, that he allowed Defendant to stay
provided that Defendant will immediately vacate
the land upon Plaintiff's prior notice that he will
be needing the land, and that Defendant refused
to vacate despite notice to do so. The MTC
rendered judgment dismissing the complaint for
lack of jurisdiction, stating that the proof
showed that the issue of possession cannot be
42

J9JC9B0M

JURISDICTION

properly determined without settling the issue
of possession.
On appeal by the Plaintiff, the RTC agreed
with the MTC that jurisdiction lies with the RTC.
The RTC then took cognizance of the case and
rendered a decision in favor of the Plaintiff
ordering the Defendant to vacate the premises ..
On appeal by Defendant, the CA reversed and
set aside the RTC Decision. The CA held that
the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction over the
case for Plaintiffs failure to allege the assessed
value of the subject property and, as a
consequence, the assailed RTC Decision is null
and void. Was the CA decision correct?
A.

No. In real actions there is a need to allege the
assessed value of the real property subject of the
action, or the interest therein, for purposes of
determining which court (MTG or RTC) has
jurisdiction over the action. However, it must be
clarified that this requirement applies only if these
courts are in the exercise of their original
jurisdiction. Here, the RTC was exercising its
appellate, not original, jurisdiction when it took
cognizance of Plaintiff's appeal and Section 22 of
B.P. Big. 129 does not provide any amount or value
of the subject property which would limit the RTC's
exercise of its appellate jurisdiction over cases
decided by first level courts. Clearly then, in the
instant case, contrary to the ruling of the CA, the
assessed value of the disputed lot is immaterial for
purposes of the RTC's appellate jurisdiction.
Indeed, all cases decided by the MTC are general!~
appealable to the RTC irrespective of the amount
involved. Hence, the CA erred in nullifying the RTC
43

decision for lack of jurisdiction. (Arrienda v. Ka/aw, 6

April 2016, Peralta, J.).
Q.

Plaintiff engaged X to construct a water tank for
him for a price of P1 ,000,000. Plaintiff withheld
delivery of the last payment of P30,000 to X
since X's supplier S had made a claim to the
same. Unable to determine who between X and
S is entitled to the P30,000 payment, Plaintiff
filed with the RTC of Las Pinas City an action
for interpleader against X and S to determine
who between them is entitled to the P30,000. X
filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the
RTC has no jurisdiction over the action. Should
the motion to dismiss be granted?

A.

Yes. The RTC has no jurisdiction over the case
since the amount subject of the interpleader does
not exceed P400,000. Under B.P. Big. 129, the
MTC has exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions
where the value of the personal property, estate, or
amount of the demand does not exceed P400,000.
( See Makati Dev't Corp. v. Tanjuatco, 27 SCRA
4
401 [1969]).

3
lt should be noted that the MTC actually had subject matter jurisdiction
since it is axiomatic in ejectment cases that the court may resolve the issue of
ownership for the limited purpose of determining the issue of possession. (S16
R70). Hence the result reached was correct for the reason that the action in the
MTC was an ejectment suit. The holding however that the requirement of stating
the assessed value does not apply to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction
appears faulty. If the MTC had no subject matter jurisdiction, this defect cannot
be cured by an appeai unless it comes within the terms of S8 R40. Here S8 R40
cannot come into play since the RTC does not have original jurisdiction precisely
because of the failure to allege the assessed value in the complaint.
4
The ruling appears to be faulty. In interpleader, the plaintiff has no
interest in and is not making any demand or asserting any right on the property
but is seeking only to compel the defendants to interplead among themselves. In
essence the suit is among the conflicting claimants, the plaintiff not making any
demand against them. The subject of the litigation is thus incapable of pecuniary
estimation.

P filed with the MTC an action for consignation
seeking to compel D to accept P250,000 in
payment of P's obligation to D. D filed a motion
to dismiss arguing that an action for consignation
is incapable of pecuniary estimation and hence
within the jurisdiction of the RTC. Should the
MTC grant the motion to dismiss?

A.

No, the MTC should not grant the motion to dismiss.
The Supreme Court has held that an action for
consignation is capable of pecuniary estimation as
the amount sought to be consigned determines the
jurisdiction of the court.
Here the amount sought to be consigned is
P250,000 which is within the jurisdictional amount
of the MTC. Hence it is the MTC which has
jurisdiction. (Ascue v. Court of Appeals, 196 SCRA

the motion to dismiss arguing that the complaint
to compel defendant to finish the construction is
one for specific performance and thus an action
incapable of pecuniary estimation.

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

the construction of the house and to pay
him P250,000?

A.
a) Yes. The alternative relief for damages made
the action for specific performance capable of
pecuniary estimation. Hence the jurisdiction lies
with the MTC since the amount of the claim
does not exceed P300,000. (See Cruz v. Tan,
87 Phil. 627).
b) No my answer would not be the same. In that
case the action would be for specific
performance and thus incapable of pecuniary
estimation. The claim for P250,000 is not an
equivalent of the action for specific performance
since it was prayed for as additional rather than
an alternative relief.

of stock is an action for recovery of personal
property rather than one incapable of pecuniary
estimation. (Gochan v. Gochan, G.R. No. 146089,

Sarmiento filed a complaint for annulment of the
REM with the RTC. First Sarmiento paid the
docket fees for actions incapable of pecuniary
estimation. After the complaint had been filed, the
ex-officio sheriff issued the certificate of sale in
PBCOM's favor. PBCOM asserted that the
Regional Trial Court failed to acquire jurisdiction
over First Sarmiento's Complaint because the
action for annulment of mortgage was a real
action; thus, the filing fees filed should have been
based on the fair market value of the mortgaged
properties. The RTC dismissed the complaint for
lack of jurisdiction, holding that First Sarmiento
failed to pay the appropriate filing fees. Was the
dismissal of the action correct?

A.

No. The complaint for annulment or cancellation of
a REM is incapable of pecuniary estimation, even if
the property had already been foreclosed when the
complaint was filed, since the ownership and
possession of the property remained with petitioner.
This is because at the time the complaint was filed,
the certificate of sale was not yet registered with the
Registry of Deeds. (First Sarmiento Holdings, Inc.

Which court or body has jurisdiction over

48

J9JC9B0M

JURISDICTION

While Kananga is a municipality, Ormoc is an
independent component city. Section 118 is thus
inapplicable. Since there is no law providing for the
exclusive jurisdiction of any court or agency over
the settlement of boundary disputes between a
municipality and an independent component city of
the same province, the RTC would have jurisdiction
pursuant to Section 19(6) of B.P. Big. 129.

B.P. Big. 129, the RTC shall exercise exclusive
original jurisdicition "[i]n all cases not within the
exclusive jurisdiction of any court, tribunal, person
or body exercising judicial or quasi-judicial
functions." An examination of Section 19(6) reveals
that the instant complaint for enforcement of a
foreign judgment, even if capable of pecuniary
estimation, would fall under the jurisdiction of the
Regional Trial Courts. This would be so even if the
foreign judgment award did not exceed the
jurisdictional amounts for the MTC. (Mijares v.

over the complaint of P?

A.

The MeTC. In computing the jurisdictional amount,
damages, attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and
costs are excluded. (Sec. 19 & 33, B.P. Big. 129).
Here excluding the moral and exemplary damages
and the attorney's fees, the amount claimed
is P350,000 which is within the jurisdiction of
the MeTC.

amount of P300,000 with interest thereon at 21 %

complaint for collection against Reyes with the

The counsel for Reyes moved to dismiss on
the ground that the court had no jurisdiction over

complaint and the debt of P300,000 represented
the stipulated interest of 21% per annum for the
period from 14 June 2006 to 15 June 2008.

A.

b) The posture of the defendant in filing the motion

The Supreme Court has held that the accrued
interest on a loan is a primary and inseparable
component of the cause of action, not merely
incidental thereto, and must be included in the
computation of the jurisdictional amount, where the
debtor had agreed in writing to pay interest and the
accrued interest is determinable at the time of the
filing of the complaint. (See Gomez v. Montalban,
548 SCRA 693 [2008]).
Here the accrued interest of P126,000 should
be added to the principal amount of P300,000.

J9JC9B0M

Hence the total amount of the demand is P426,000
which is in excess of the jurisdictional amount
of P400,000 and thus
within the jurisdiction
of the RTC.
Q.

In the preceding problem, assume that the RTC
denied the motion to dismiss. After trial, the
RTC found that the accrued interest to which
Danilo Chan is entitled to is only P96,000. The
RTC then rendered judgment dismissing the
case for lack of jurisdiction, stating that the
total amount to which Chan is entitled to is
only P396,000 and thus not exceeding the
jurisdictional amount of P400,000. Was the
RTC's judgment correct?

A.

No. Jurisdiction is determined by the cause of
action as alleged in the complaint and not by the
amount ultimately substantiated and awarded. Here
the amount of the demand as stated in the
complaint was P426,000 which is within the RTC's
jurisdiction. Hence the fact that the amount
ultimately substantiated and awarded was only
P396,000 would not oust the court of the
jurisdiction it had acquired. (Id.).

Q.

P was bumped by D's car which was recklessly
driven by D. P files an action for quasi-delict
against D with the RTC of Makati. P's complaint
prayed for actual damages of P350,000, moral
damages of PS0,000, exemplary damages of
PS0,000, and attorney's fees of P40,000. Does the
RTC of Makati have jurisdiction over the case?

A.

Yes. Under SC Circular 09-94 the exclusion of
"damages of whatever kind" in determining the
jurisdictional amount under R.A. 7691 "applies only

52
J9JC9B0M

JURISDICTION

to cases where the damages are merely incidental
to or a consequence of the main cause of action.
However in cases where the claim for damages is
the main cause of action, or one of the causes of
action, the amount of such claim shall be considered
in determining the jurisdiction of the court."
Here the claim for damages is the main cause
of action since this is a complaint for quasi-delict or
torts. Hence the moral and exemplary damages
should be added to the claim for actual damages of
P350,000 and the total jurisdictional amount is
P450,000 which is thus within the RTC's jurisdiction.
(Note: The wording of Circular 09-94 is imprecise
since a claim for damages is not a cause of action but
a relief sought by the plaintiff. It is suggested that the
Circular be worded as follows: "xxxx However in
cases where the cause of action principally involves a
claim for damages (as in a torts case), the amount of
such claim shall be considered in determining the
jurisdiction of the court.")
Q.

Santos's car was bumped by a truck driven by
Pinion and owned by lniego, the employer of
Pinion. Santos filed an action for quasi-delict
against Pinion and lniego with the RTC of
Manila. In the prayer of his complaint, Santos
asked for P40,000 as actual damages, P300,000
as moral damages, P150,000 as exemplary
damages, and attorney's fees of PS0,000. The
moral damages and exemplary damages were
prayed for because of Defendant's adamantine
refusal to admit liability and to pay the actual
damages. Who has jurisdiction over the action?
The RTC or the MTC?

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

It is the RTC which has jurisdiction. The moral
damages and exemplary damages are included in
computing the jurisdictional amount of P400,000
since said damages arose from the same cause of
action, that is, quasi-delict. The total claim of
P490,000 thus falls within the jurisdiction of the
RTC. (lniego v. Purganan, G.R. 166876, 24 March
2006; See S.C. Circular No. 09-94. Note that the
attorney's fees were excluded in computing the
jurisdictional amount. Another way of looking at it is
that since the action is principally for recovery of
damages, then the damages should be included in
computing the jurisdictional amount).

Q.

Petitioner filed on 22 August 1996 with the MTC
an action "for damages with writ of replevin"
against the Respondent wherein it prayed for
the return of the forklift or in the alternative if
the return cannot be made the payment of its
actual market value of P150,000 and for the
payment of unpaid rentals of P11,000 a month
starting from April 1995 until repossession of
the forklift At the time of the complaint's filing,
the outstanding and unpaid rentals had
amounted to P180,000. Petitioner also prayed
for exemplary damages of P1,000,000 and
attorney's fees of PS0,000. Does the MTC have
jurisdiction over the Petitioner's complaint?

A.

No. The value of the forklift is P150,000. It cannot
be said that the actual damages in the form or
unpaid rentals is just incidental to the action for the
return of the forklift, considering that the Petitioner
had specifically sought not only the seizure of the
forklift but likewise the unpaid and outstanding
rentals. Pursuant to SC Ad. Cir. 09-94 the P180,000
is included in the computation. P150,000 + P180,000
54

= P330,000 which is over the jurisdictional amount of
P200,000. Hence the MTC does not have
jurisdiction. (Movers-Baseco Integrated Port Services,
Inc. v. Cyborg Leasing Corp., GR 131755, 25 Oct
99). Note that the exemplary damages and
attorney's fees are not included in the computation.
Q.

D borrowed P250,000 from C evidenced by a
promissory note which loan was secured by a
chattel mortgage executed by D over his car
worth P450,000. D failed to pay despite demand
so C filed an action with the MeTC of Paranaque
City to collect P250,000 from D and/or to
foreclose upon the chattel mortgage. D filed a
motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

A.

Yes. It is the RTC which has jurisdiction because of
the alternative relief which prays for the foreclosure
of a chattel in the amount exceeding P400,000.
(See Good Dev't Corp. v. Tutaan, L-41641, 30
September 1976).

Q.

Plaintiff bank filed a sum of money case
(P350,000) against an auto loan borrower with
the MTC of Pasay City. The Plaintiff also applied
for a writ of replevin and was able to seize the
car valued at PS00,000. The Defendant filed a
motion to dismiss on the ground that jurisdiction
should be with the RTC. Should the Defendant's
motion to dismiss be granted?

A.

No. The SC held that in a sum of money case,
jurisdiction is determined by the amount of the
claim not by the value of the vehicle seized under
the writ of replevin. (Fernandez v. International
Corporate Bank, 7 October 1999).

Q.

Filomeno brought an action in the MeTC of
Pasay City against Marcelino pleading two
causes of action. The first was a demand for the
recovery of physical possession of a parcel of
land situated in Pasay City with an assessed
value of P40,000; the second was a claim for
damages of P500,000 for Marcelino's unlawful
retention of the property. Marcelino filed a
motion to dismiss on the ground that the total
amount involved, which is P540,000, is beyond
the jurisdiction of the MeTC. Is Marcelino
correct? (08 Bar Q4).

A.

Marcelino is not correct. The MeTC has jurisdiction
over the action.
Under Section 33 of B.P. Big. 129, the MeTC
has jurisdiction over real actions where the assessed
value of the realty does not exceed PS0,000 in Metro
Manila. Said provision also states that damages are
excluded in computing the jurisdictional amount.
Here the claim for damages was merely
incidental to the cause of action involving the claim
for recovery of possession. Hence the MeTC has
jurisdiction over the action for recovery of
possession of land since its assessed value did not
exceed PS0,000.
(Note: There is an imperfection in the drafting of
the question. The claim for recovery of possession
and for damages are not causes of action but simply
the relief sought by Filomena. There is only cause of
action: Marcelino's unlawful retention of the property.
[See discussion of cause of action under Rule 2]).

Special Commercial Court
Q.

Petitioners filed with the RTC of Muntinlupa City
a complaint against Respondent GJH Land Inc.and Respondent officers of GJH Land seeking to
enjoin the sale of GJH Land shares. The
Petitioners alleged that they had fully paid for
GJH Land Inc. shares but the same were still
offered for sale by Respondents to GJH
stockholders. The case was docketed as Civil
Case No. 11-077 and raffled to Branch 276, which
is not a Special Commercial Court. After filing
their respective answers to the complaint,
respondents filed a motion to dismiss on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction over the subject
matter, pointing out that the case involves an
intra-corporate dispute and should, thus, be
heard by the designated Special Commercial
Court of Muntinlupa City. Branch 276 granted the
motion to dismiss filed by respondents. It found
that the case involves an intracorporate dispute
that is within the original and exclusive
jurisdiction of the RTCs designated as Special
Commercial Courts. It pointed out that the RTC
of Muntinlupa City, Branch 256 was specifically
designated by the Court as the Special
Commercial Court; hence, Branch 276 had no
jurisdiction over the case and cannot lawfully
exercise jurisdiction on the matter. Accordinglyr
it dismissed the case. Did RTC Branch 276 ac
correctly in dismissing the case?

A.

No. A court's acquisition of jurisdiction over a
particular case's subject matter is different from
incidents pertaining to the exercise of its
jurisdiction. Jurisdiction over the subject matter of a

57
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

case is conferred by law, whereas a court's
exercise of jurisdiction, unless provided by the
law itself, is governed by the Rules of Court or by
the orders issued from time to time by the Court.
The matter of whether the RTC resolves an
issue in the exercise of its general jurisdiction
or of its limited jurisdiction as a special court is
only a matter of procedure and has nothing to
do with the question of jurisdiction. In such a
scenario, the proper course of action was not for
the commercial case to be dismissed; instead,
Branch 276 should have first referred the case to
the Executive Judge for re-docketing as a
commercial case; thereafter, the Executive
Judge should then assign said case to the only
designated Special Commercial Court in the
station, i.e., Branch 256. (Gonzalez v. GJH Land,
Inc., 10 November 2015, e.b., Perlas-Bernabe, J.).
Note that the procedure would be different
where the RTC acquiring jurisdiction over the
case has multiple special commercial court
branches; in such a scenario, the Executive Judge,
after re-docketing the same as a commercial case,
should proceed to order its re-raffling among the
said special branches. (Id.).

149, an sec, has no subject-matter jurisdiction
over an ordinary civil case. Should the motion

A.

No, the motion to dismiss should not be granted.
Branch 149 may take cognizance of the case. The
designation of Branch 149 as an sec by no means
diminished its power as a court of general
jurisdiction to hear and decide cases of all nature,
whether civil, criminal or special proceedings. The
Makati RTC, Branch 149, erred in dismissing the
petition for injunction with damages, which is clearly
an ordinary civil case. As courts of general
jurisdiction, the designated SCCs and the regular
RTCs are both conferred by law the power to hear
and decide civil cases in which the subject of the
litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation, such
as an action for injunction. Branch 149 therefore
has jurisdiction over the case and should take
cognizance of the same. ( Concorde Condominium

No, the motion to dismiss should not be granted for

cognizance of the case as the same was "wrongly
raffled," that is, erroneously docketed as a

the Executive Judge for re-docketing as an
ordinary civil case; thereafter, the Executive

the RTC of Makati a complaint against RCBC
Securities wherein he prayed for recovery of the
money from unauthorized trades and the
securities diverted to other accounts. The case
was raffled to Branch 63, a non-commerial

A.

No. the case is not an intra-corporate dispute and,
instead, is an ordinary civil action triable by a noncommercial court. There are no intra-corporate
relations between the parties. K is neither a

Special Agrarian Court
Q.

What is the jurisdiction of the RTC, sitting as a
Special Agrarian Court (SAC)?

A.

The SAC shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction
over all petitions for the determination of just
compensation to landowners. (Sec. 57, CARL).

Q.

X was the owner of several lots. For purposes of
placing those lands within the coverage of the
CARL, the Department of Agrarian Reform
Adjudication Board (DARAB) sent to X several
Notices of Land Valuation and Acquisition by
which her lands were valued for acquisition by
the DAR. After X rejected such valuation of
her lands, the DARAB conducted summary
administrative proceedings for the determination
of just compensation. The DARAB issued its
order affirming the valuation of the lands upon
finding the valuation consistent with existing
administrative guidelines on land valuation.
Two months from her receipt of the
DARAB'S order, X filed in the Regional Trial
Court (RTC), sitting as a Special Agrarian Court
(SAC), a complaint for the fixing of just
compensation for her lands, impleading as
defendant the Land Bank of the Philippines
(LBP) and the DAR. The Petitioner prayed that
the DARAB valuation be set aside and declared
null and void, and that in its stead the price of
61

t

PRiMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

her lands be fixed based on the fair market value
thereof. The Defendants filed a motion to
dismiss citing Section 51 of the CARL and
Section 11 of Rule XIII of the 1994 DARAB Rules
of Procedure which provides that the complaint
should have been filed within 15 days from
notice of the assailed order. The RTC as the SAC
granted the respondents' motion to dismiss.
Was the grant of the motion to dismiss proper?
A.

No. The RTC, acting as SAC, had original and
exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the
determination of just compensation. The original
and exclusive jurisdiction of the SAC would be
undermined if the DAR would vest in administrative
officials the original jurisdiction in compensation
cases and make the SAC an appellate court for the
review of administrative decisions.
Since the determination of just compensation
is a judicial function, the Supreme Court
abandoned its ruling in Veterans Bank, Martinez
and Soriano that a petition for determination of just
compensation before the SAC shall be proscribed
and adjudged dismissible if not filed within the 15day period prescribed under the DARAS Rules.
To maintain the rulings would be incompatible
and inconsistent with the legislative intent to vest
the original and exclusive jurisdiction in the
determination of just compensation with the SAC.
Indeed, such rulings judicially reduced the SAC to
merely an appellate court to review the
administrative decisions of the DAR. This was
never the intention of the Congress. (Land Bank v.
Dalauta, 8 August 2017, e.b., Mendoza, J.).

Jurisdiction over labor matters
Q.

P was a sales representative of Georg Grotjahn
GMBH & Co. She obtained loans and cash
advances from the company. Later she was
dismissed and she filed an illegal dismissal
case against the company with the labor arbiter.
The company filed a suit with the RTC to collect
the loans from P. P filed a motion to dismiss for
lack of jurisdiction, contending that it is the
labor arbiter which has jurisdiction over claims
arising from employer-employee relations. The
RTC granted the motion to dismiss. Was the
dismissal proper?

A.

No. The jurisdiction of the labor arbiters and the
NLRC under Art. 217(5) of the Labor Code is limited
to disputes arising from an employer-employee
relationship which can only be resolved by reference
to Labor Laws or the collective bargaining
agreement. Where the claim to the principal relief
sought is to be resolved not by reference to the labor
laws or the CBA but by the general civil law, the
jurisdiction belongs to the regular courts of justice
and not the labor arbiter or the NLRC. Here what is
involved is a simple loan collection case which can
be resolved by the Civil Code provisions on
obligations and contracts. ( Georg Grotjahn GMBH &
Co. v. lsnani, G.R. No. 109272, 10 August 1994).
Otherwise put while the claim is between an
employer and an employee, the same did not arise
from employer-employee relations.

Q.

Employee filed an illegal dismissal case with the
labor arbiter against employer. The employer in
its defense contended that it had dismissed the
employee on the ground that the latter was

selling the products of a competitor, Acme
Corporation. The labor arbiter decided in favor
of the employee and awarded damages and
separation pay. Later the employer filed a
damage suit with the RTC against the employee.
The employer alleged that the employee was
promoting the products of Acme Corporation to
the detriment of the employer and thus it
sustained damages. The employee filed a motion
to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.
Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

A.

Yes. The SC held that the employer's claim against
employee for alleged double dealing is one that
should have been raised as a compulsory
counterclaim in the labor case for illegal dismissal
filed by the employee against the employer; the
RTC has no jurisdiction over the case. (Banez v.
Va/devil/a, GR 128024, 9 May 2000).
Note: Here the ground for the dismissal and
the damage suit involved the same subject, the
alleged double-dealing. Compare with Grotjahn
where there was no showing of a nexus between
the ground for the illegal dismissal and the nonpayment of the loans.

USSI and its employees on one hand and PAL on
the other. The Labor Arbiter did not rule on the
motion to dismiss. Later on the Labor Arbiter
rendered a decision in favor of USSI. The Labor
Arbiter stated that since PAL is an "indirect
employer" under Article 107 of the Labor Code,
there is an employer-employee relationship
between PAL and the security guards. Did the
Labor Arbiter have jurisdiction over the case?
A.

No. The Supreme Court held that while PAL may be
an "indirect employer" under Article 107, a perusal of
Articles 106 and 107 reveals that a company is only
an "indirect employer'' for purposes of liability for
wages but not for any other purpose. There being no
employer-employee relationship between PAL, on
one hand, and the security guards and USSI on the
other, the Labor Arbiter was without jurisdiction.
USSl's complaint should have been filed with the
regular courts. (Philippine Airlines v. NLRC, G.R. No.

A. The RTC. When as here the cause of

based on tort, which has no reasonable causal
connection with any of the claims in Art. 217 of the
Labor Code, the jurisdiction over the action is with
the regular courts. Petitioner does not ask for any
relief under the Labor Code but merely seeks to
recover damages based on the breach of contract.
Such case is within the realm of Civil Law more so
where the stipulation refers to the post-employment
relations of the parties. (Yusen Air & Sea Service,

employer-employee relations. Nevertheless, when
the cause of action has no reasonable connection
with any of the claims provided for in Article 217 of
the Labor Code, jurisdiction over the action is with the
regular courts. Here, since Josephine's cause of

installments while the other 50% would be
shouldered by Malayan. The car plan stipulated
that if Diana was terminated within 3 years from
her hiring, she should pay Malayan's equity and
return the car immediately if she is unable to
pay. Just a year into her hiring, Diana was
terminated on the ground of redundancy. She
was unable to pay her obligation to Malayan
and also refused to surrender the car. Malayan
brought an action for replevin with the RTC to
recover the car (which was valued at PG00,000)

A. Yes. The action involves the parties' relationship as
debtor and creditor, not their "employer-employee"
relationship. Malayan's demand for Diana to pay
the 50% company equity over the car or, to
surrender its possession, is civil in nature. The
issue in the replevin case is separate and distinct
from the illegal dismissal case. (Malayan Insurance

JURISDICTION

A. The Housing and Land Use Regulatory

hear and decide cases of the following nature:

Q.

1)

Unsound real estate business practices.

2)

Claims involving refund and any other claims
filed by subdivision lot or condominium unit
buyer against the project owner, developer,
dealr, broker, or salesman; and

3)

Cases involving specific performance of
contractual and statutory obligations filed by
buyers of subdivision lot or condominium unit
against the owner, developer, dealer, broker or
salesman. (See P.O. No. 1344, E.O. No. 648
and E.O. No. 90).

France! Realty Corp. filed a complaint with the
Regional Trial Court against the Defendant
Sycip for collection of the balance of the price
of house and lot under a contract to sell.
Previously Sycip had filed a complaint with the
HLURB against Francel for "unsound business
practices" involving the sale of the same house
and lot. Defendant filed with the RTC a motion
to dismiss on the ground that the jurisdiction is
with the HLURB rather than the RTC.
a)

Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

b) Would your answer be the same if there was
no prior case filed by Sycip against Francel?
A.

a)

Yes. FRC contends that the case is not
cognizable by the HLURB because it was filed
by the developer rather than by the buyer, as

69

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

provided under P.O. 1344. This contention is
untenable. FRC's complaint should have been
filed with the HLURB as a compulsory
counterclaim pursuant to S7 R6 of the Rules of
Court. (France/ Realty Corp. v. Sycip, G.R.
154684, 8 September 2005).
b)

No. In that case it would be the RTC which
would have jurisdiction. The HLURB has no
jurisdiction to take cognizance of a complaint
filed by the subdivision owner or developer
against the subdivision unit buyer. The
wordings of PD 1344 reveal that it has
jurisdiction over cases filed by the subdivision
or condominium unit buyer against the
subdivision
or
condominium
owner
or
developer but not the other way around. The
only instance when the HLURB would have
jurisdiction over a case filed by the subdivision
or condominium unit owner or developer is if
such case is filed as a compulsory counterclaim
to an existing suit filed by the subdivision or
· condominium unit buyer against the developer
(Delos
as in France/ Realty Corporation.
Santos v. Spouses Sarmiento, G.R. No.

Q.

Which has jurisdiction over an action by a
condominium unit buyer to annul a mortgage
over the condominium unit by the project
owner without the buyer's consent and without
HLURB approval?

A.

The HLURB since it involves an unsound real estate
practice on the part of the project owner. Sec. 18 of

condominium unit or subdivision lot shall be made

Baguio Townsite Reservation?

A.

No. The trial court had no jurisdiction to determine

Q.

Who has exclusive and original jurisdiction over
issues regarding the cancellation of Certificates
of Land Ownership Awards (CLOAs), Emancipation
Patents, and other titles issued under any
agrarian reform program?

A.

The Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary. In
2009, Congress amended the Comprehensive
Agrarian Reform Law through Republic Act No.
9700. Under the new Section 24, all cases involving
the cancellation of registered emancipation patents,
certificates of land ownership awards, and other
titles issued under any agrarian reform program are
now within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the
Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary. He or
she takes jurisdiction over cases involving the
cancellation of titles issued under any agrarian
reform program, whether registered with the Land
Registration Authority or not. ( Secretary of the

Q.

D.M. Consunji, Inc. (DMCI) entered into a contract
with the Metropolitan Manila Development
Authority (MMDA) for the construction of an
interim waste management project for Metro
Manila. However the project was not completed
because of TROs issued by various courts and
because the contract was not signed by then
President Estrada. DMCI thus filed with the RTC

JURISDICTION

incurred in the partial execution of the interim
waste management project. The RTC ruled in
favor of DMCI. May the judgment of the RTC be
set aside?
A.

Yes. A liquidated claim against the government falls
within the primary jurisdiction of the Commission on
Audit (COA). A liquidated claim is one which is
determined or readily determinable from vouchers,
invoices, and such other papers within reach of
accounting officers. This case is one over which the
doctrine of primary jurisdiction clearly held sway for
although DMCl's collection suit was within the
jurisdiction of the RTC, it was the COA which had
primary jurisdiction since the case involved a
liquidated claim. The doctrine of primary jurisdiction
does not warrant a court to arrogate unto itself
authority to resolve a controversy the jurisdiction
over which is initially lodged with an administrative
body of special competence. All the proceedings of
the court in violation of the doctrine and all orders
and decisions rendered thereby are null and void.

National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP)
Q.

Respondents, claiming to be the owners of an
unregistered parcel of land in Talakag,
Bukidnon, filed with the RTC in 2004 a
complaint for accion reivindicatoria against the
Petitioners. The Petitioners filed a motion to
dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction.
The Petitioners alleged that they are members
of the Talaandig tribe and that a Certificate of
Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) over the subject
land was issued in their favor in 2003 by
73

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

President Arroyo. They alleged that pursuant to
Section 66 of the Indigenous Peoples' Rights
Act (IPRA), it is the NCIP not the RTC which has
exclusive and original jurisdiction over the
case, as the $Ubject matter concerns a dispute
and controversy over an ancestral land/domain
of Indigenous Cultural Communities (/CCs)/
Indigenous Peoples (/Ps). Should the motion to
dismiss be granted?
A.

No. Section 66 of the IPRA provides for the NCI P's
jurisdiction as follows:
Sec. 66. Jurisdiction of the NCIP. - The NCIP,
through its regional offices, shall have jurisdiction over
all claims and disputes involving rights of
ICCs/lPs; Provided, however, That no such dispute
shall be brought to the NCIP unless the parties have
exhausted all remedies provided under their
customary laws. For this purpose, a certification shall
be issued by the Council of Elders/Leaders who
participated in the attempt to settle the dispute that
the same has not been resolved, which certification
shall be a condition precedent to the filing of a petition
with the NCIP.

A careful review of Section 66 shows that the
NCIP shall have jurisdiction over claims and disputes
involving rights of ICCs/lPs only when they arise
between or among parties belonging to the same
ICC/IP. This can be gathered from the qualifying
provision that "no such dispute shall be brought to the
NCIP unless the parties have exhausted all remedies
provided under their customary laws. For this
purpose, a certification shall be issued by the Council
of Elders/Leaders who participated in the attempt to
settle the dispute that the same has not been

74
J9JC9B0M

JURISDICTION

resolved, which certification shall be a condition
precedent to the filing of a petition with the NCIP."
Therefore, pursuant to Section 66 of the IPRA,
the NCIP shall have jurisdiction over claims and
disputes involving rights of ICCs/lPs only when they
arise between or among parties belonging to the
same ICC/IP. When such claims and disputes arise
between or among parties who do not belong to the
same ICC/IP, i.e., parties belonging to different
ICC/IPs or where one of the parties is a non-ICC/IP,
the case shall fall under the jurisdiction of the
proper Courts of Justice, instead of the NCIP. In
this case, while most of the petitioners belong to
Talaandig Tribe, respondents do not belong to the
same ICC/IP. Thus, even if the real issue involves a
dispute over land which appear to be located within
the ancestral domain of the Talaandig Tribe, it is
not the NCIP but the RTC which shall have the
power to hear, try and decide this case. ( Unduran
v. Aberasturi, 20 October 2015, e.b., Peralta, J.).
Q.

Does Section 66 of the IPRA confer primary or
exclusive jurisdiction to the NCIP over all
claims and disputes involving rights of ICCs/lPs
to the exclusion of the regular courts?

A.

No. Section 66 does not state that the NCIP has
exclusive jurisdiction over all claims and disputes
involving rights of ICCs/lPs. Despite the language
that the NCIP shall have jurisdiction over all claims
and disputes involving rights of ICCs/lPs, we
cannot deduce primary sole NCIP jurisdiction over
all ICCs/lPs claims and disputes to the exclusion
of the regular courts. If it were the intention of the
legislative that: (1) the NCIP exercise primary
jurisdiction over, and/or (2) the regular courts be

75
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

excluded from taking cognizance of, claims and
disputes involving rights of ICCs/lPs, the legislature
could have easily done so as in other instances
conferring primary, and original and exclusive
jurisdiction to a specific administrative body. At
best, the limited jurisdiction of the NCIP is
concurrent with that of the regular trial courts in the
exercise of the latter's general jurisdiction
extending to all controversies brought before them
within the legal bounds of rights and remedies. (Lim
v. Gamosa, 2 December 2015, Perez, J.).

The phrase "different cities or municipalities" here means a city or
municipality different from where the parties actually reside. This may be gleaned
from the opening sentence wherein "same city or municipality" refers to that
where the parties actually reside. Hence this exception could be more clearly
worded as follows: 'Where the dispute involves [a] real [property] located in a

A, B, C, D, and E are siblings who are the coowners of Lot A in Roxas City. Their father
allowed X to occupy the same provided X will
vacate the property when needed by his
children. X refused to vacate when asked to do
so. Thus A, B, and C (in his own behalf and as
attorney-in-fact of D and E) filed an unlawful
detainer case against X. X moved to dismiss on
the ground of lack of barangay conciliation since
A, B, C and X all reside in Roxas City. A, B, and
C argued that D and E are not residents of Roxas
City. X contended that D and E had already
executed an SPA in favor of C who resides in
Roxas City. May the complaint be dismissed for
failure to undergo barangay conciliation?

A. No. Here, the Complaint specifically alleged that
not all the real parties in interest in the case
actually reside in Roxas City. As such prior referral
of the case for barangay conciliation is not a
precondition to its filing in court.
This is true regardless of the fact that D and E
had already authorized C to act as their attorney-infact in the ejectment proceedings before the MTC.
The residence of the attorney-in-fact of a real party
in interest is irrelevant in so far as the "actual
residence" requirement under the LGC for prior
barangay conciliation is concerned. (Abagatnan v.

the payment of the accrued rentals in the total
amount of P25,000.
a) Is prior referral to the Lupon necessary?
b) Supposing that referral is necessary, but the
complaint is filed without such referral, may
it be dismissed on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction? (91 Bar Q1)

A.

a)

No, prior referral to the Lupon is not necessary.

The Supreme Court has held that the
barangay conciliation procedure applies only to
disputes between natural persons and does not
apply where one party is a juridical entity such as
the estate of a deceased person.
( Vda. de
Borromeo v. Pogoy, 126 SCRA 217).
b)

No. Lack of referral to the Lupon is not
jurisdictional but merely results in the complaint
being dismissible for failure to comply with a
condition precedent. (S 1[j] R 16).

Q.

What are the instances where the parties may
go directly to court without the need of prior
barangay conciliation? (Keyword: PaPaHiD)-

Q.

P filed with the RTC a complaint for damages,
with application for preliminary attachment,

vehicular collision. P and D are both residents
of Las Pinas City. D filed a motion to dismiss on
the ground that there was no prior resort to
barangay conciliation. Should the RTC grant the
motion to dismiss?

A.

No. Since the action was coupled with a provisional
remedy, P may go directly to court. (Sec. 412[b][3],
Local Government Code).

Petitioner filed with the RTC of Davao City a

respondent filed a motion to dismiss on the
ground of failure to comply with a condition
precedent, that is prior barangay conciliation.
The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. It
found that the petitioner's prayer for the
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction is a
mere ploy to avoid the requirement of a
barangay conciliation, as a simple annotation of
a notice of lis pendens would achieve the same
effect without having to undergo trial or post a
bond. Was the dismissal proper?

J9JC9B0M

JURISDICTION

A.

No. Section 412 of the Local Government Code
provides that parties may go directly to cou:rt where
the action is coupled with provisional remedies
such as preliminary injunction. As good faith is
always presumed, in the absence of proof of
improper motive on the part of the petitioner, the
lower court's assumption that petitioner was solely
intent on evading the requirements of the LGC in
applying for a preliminary injunction cannot be
countenanced. A dismissal of an action cannot be
sustained on account of an unproven assertion of
bad faith. (Racpan v. Barroga-Haigh, 6 June 2018,

Hence the MTC also has jurisdiction over an action to enforce a barangay

certificate to file action which was attested by the
Barangay Chairman. No pangkat was constituted.
Mila filed the ejectment suit before the MTC which
rendered a decision in her favor. Fred appealed
to the RTC which directed the parties to go back
to the lupon for further proceedings and to
comply strictly with the conciliation proceedings,
and only upon failure of settlement may the

latter to decide the case anew. Fred appealed to
the Court of Appeals arguing that the RTC should
have dismissed the complaint for being
prematurely instituted instead of just remanding
the records to the MTC. Should the CA dismiss
the complaint?
A.

No. While no Pangkat was constituted pursuant to
Sec. 41 0(b) of the Local Government Code, there
was substantial compliance with the law when the
parties met at the office of the Barangay Chairman
for possible settlement. Under Section 412 the
confrontation either before the Lupon Chairman or
the Pangkat is sufficient compliance with the
pre-condition for filing a case in court. Sec.

A.

No. Article 222 of the Civil Code (now Article 151,

Q.

When is an action deemed commenced? What
is the importance of knowing when an action is
deemed commenced?

A. A civil action is deemed commenced by the filing of
the original complaint in court. If an additional
defendant is impleaded in a later pleading, the
action is deemed commenced with regard to him on
the date of filing of such later pleading, irrespective
of whether the motion for its admission, if
necessary, is denied by the court. (S5 R1). Aside
from the filing, it is also necessary that the requisite
filing fees should have been paid.
87
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

The importance of knowing when an action is
deemed commenced is that such commencement
interrupts or suspends the running of the prescriptive
period of actions. (Article 1155, Civil Code). If the
action is dismissed, then the balance of the
prescriptive period would start to run again. (Board
of Liquidators v. Zu/ueta, 115 SCRA 548 [1982]).
Q.

P filed an action for collection against A. A filed
his answer. P then filed a motion to admit
amended complaint including B as defendant. The
court admitted the amended complaint. When is
the action deemed commenced against B?

A.

From the filing of the amended complaint. (S5 R1).
In fact, even if the motion to admit was denied,
the action was deemed commenced against B and
thus the prescriptive period had already been
interrupted. (Id.). However upon the finality of the
order denying the motion to admit amended
complaint, the prescriptive period would start to run
again. P should now file the action to collect against
B, assuming there is no res judicata, within the
balance of the period.

Q.

May a complaint be filed by registered mail? If
so, when it is deemed commenced.

A.

Yes. It is deemed filed or commenced as of the
date of mailing. (S3 R13). However if the requisite
docket fee was actually paid, either personally or by
mailing, subsequent to the mailing of the complaint,
the date of such payment or mailing thereof shall
be considered as the date of the filing of the
complaint. (Ago Timber Corp. v. Ruiz, L-23887, 26
December 1967).

Docket fees
Q.

Plaintiff filed an action for damages and specific
performance against Defendant. The amount of
damages sought is not specified in the prayer
although the body of the complaint alleges the
total amount of over P78 million as damages
suffered by Plaintiff. The docket fee paid upon
filing of complaint in the amount was computed
at only P410.00, the action being considered to
be merely one for specific performance and
thus incapable of pecuniary estimation.
Although the total amount of damages sought
was not stated in the prayer of the complaint yet
it is spelled out in the body of the complaint
totalling in the amount of P78 million which
should have been the basis for assessing the
filing fee. When the under-assessment of the
filing fee was brought to the attention of the
court, an amended complaint was filed seeking
a reduced amount of P10,000,000. The trial court
admitted the amended complaint upon the
payment of the docket fee based on the
P10,000,000. Was the admission of the amended
complaint proper?

A.

No. All complaints, petitions, answers and other
similar pleadings should specify the amount of
damages being prayed for not only in the body of
the pleading but also in the prayer, and said
damages shall be considered in the assessment of
the filing fees in any case. Any pleading that fails to
comply with this requirement shall not be accepted
nor admitted, or shall otherwise be expunged
from the record.

A court acquires jurisdiction over any case only
upon the payment of the prescribed docket fee. An
amendment of the complaint or similar pleading will
not thereby vest jurisdiction in the Court, much less
the payment of the docket fee based on the
amounts sought in the amended pleading. For all
legal purposes there is no such original complaint
that was duly filed which could be amended.
Consequently, the order admitting the amended
complaint and all subsequent proceedings and
actions taken by the trial court are null and void.

Q.

Private respondent is a holder of letters patent for
his alleged invention, coco-diesel fuel for diesel
engines and its manufacture. In 1983 private
respondent filed a complaint with the RTC for
infringement of patent with prayer for payment of
reasonable compensation and for damages
against petitioner Pilipinas Shell Petroleum
Corporation. There was no mention in the
complaint of the amount of damages being
claimed but private respondent alleged, among
others, that the conservative estimate of the
combined gross sales of petitioner of private
respondent's invention is P934,213,780.00 annually
computed at the rate of 20 million barrels (volume)
being yearly sold by the marketing arm of
petitioner at the price of P2.938 per liter. Private
respondent estimated the yearly royalty due him
from defendant to be P236,572,350.00.

RULE 1
General Provisions

for the dismissal of the complaint for failure of
private respondent to pay the correct filing fee.
In 1985, the RTC issued an order denying
the motion to dismiss but ordering private
respondent to pay the additional docket fee in
the amount of P945,636.90. Private respondent
filed a motion for reconsideration of the order of
the trial court requiring him to pay an additional
docket fee which the trial court granted by
issuing an order allowing private respondent to
pay the required additional docket fee after the
prosecution of the case, to be deducted from
whatever judgment in damages shall be awarded
by the court. Did the trial court act properly in
allowing the docket fee to be constituted as a
first lien on the judgment award?
A.

No. The rules clearly contemplate an initial payment
of the filing fees corresponding to the estimated
amount of the claim subject to adjustment as to
what later may be proved. Conversely, nowhere
can a justification be found to convert such
payment to something akin to a contingent fee
which would depend on the result of the case.
Under the circumstances, the Court would stand to
lose the filing fees should the party be later
adjudged to be not entitled to any claim at all.
Filing fees are intended to take care of court
expenses in the handling of cases in terms of cost

tremendous losses to the government and to the
judiciary in particular.
In the case at bar, only the amount of P252.00
based on the claim of attorney's fees was paid but
such is but a part of his enormous claim for
royalties/reasonable compensation, which was not
estimated and the corresponding filing fees were
left unpaid. (Pilipinas Shell Corp. v. Court of
Appeals, 10 April 1989). (Note: The SC remanded
the case to the trial court with the direction that the
case shall resume only after payment of the
appropriate docket fee or upon proper application
to litigate as an indigent).

A complaint filed for recovery of possession of
real property also prayed for moral and

RULE 1
General Provisions

The Supreme Court has held that where the
docket fees for a real action have been paid but the
docket fees for related claims for damages were
not, the court nonetheless acquired jurisdiction over
the real action and may not dismiss the action for
failure to specify the amount of damages. What the
court should do is to merely expunge the claim for
damages. (Tacay v. RTC of Tagum, G.R. Nos.
88075-77, 20 December 1989).
(b) No, since the trial court acquire jurisdiction over
the real action it may not dismiss the same.
What the trial court should simply do is to
expunge the claim for moral and exemplary
damages which were not specified. (Id.).
2)

No the rule for the payment of docket fees
for damages is not the same as that for criminal
cases.

In criminal cases, docket fees for moral,
exemplary, temperate, and nominal (MENT) damages
are required to be paid only if the complaint or
information filed with the trial court alleges such
damages. (S1 R111).
Q.

P was a former record owner of 100 shares of~
stock in the Manila Golf Club. Upon his return
from the U.S., he discovered that the shares in
his name were cancelled and new shares issued
in favor of the National Steel Corporation. P
filed an action against NSC and MGC to compel
the assignment of shares of stock in his favor.
P paid the docket fee for actions incapable of
pecuniary estimation, which was only about
P600. After trial NSC filed a motion to dismiss
on the ground that P should have paid the

93

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

docket fee based on the value of the stocks
sought to be recovered and since the proper
docket fees were not paid, the trial court
therefore did not acquire jurisdiction.
a) Were the proper docket fees paid?
b) Should the motion to dismiss filed by NSC
be granted?
A.

a) No. An action to compel the assignment of
shares of stock is an action for recovery of
personal property rather than one incapable of
pecuniary estimation. The docket fees should
have been assessed on the value of the stocks
sought to be assigned to P.
b)

Q.

No. The NSC was estopped from raising the
defense of non-payment of the docket fee since
it participated in the trial. The deficiency docket
fee shall be assessed as a lien on the judgment
award. (NSC v. CA, 302 SCRA 522).

Harvest All Investment Ltd., a minority
stockholder of Alliance Corporation, filed an
action with the RTC of Pasig to compel Alliance
to hold the annual stockholder's meeting (ASM).
The complaint alleges that Alliance refused to
hold the ASM because Alliance wanted to hold
first a P1 billion stock rights offering (SRO).
Alliance filed a motion to dismiss alleging that
the proper docket fees corresponding to the P1
billion was not paid. Harvest All argued that the
action is incapable of pecuniary estimation
since the purpose thereof is to compel Alliance
to hold the ASM and hence the payment of

PS,860 docket fee for actions incapable of
pecuniary estimation was in order. Is Harvest
All correct?
A.

Yes. Depending on the nature of the principal action
or remedy sought, an intra-corporate controversy
may involve a subject matter which is either capable
or incapable of pecuniary estimation. Here the
subject matter, which is to compel Alliance to hold
the ASM, is one which is incapable of pecuniary
estimation. That Alliance's reason for not holding the
ASM was to hold first the P1 Billion SRO did not
make the complaint capable of pecuniary estimation.
(Dee v. Harvest All Investment Ltd., 15 Mar 2017,
Perlas-Bernabe, J.).

Q.

Philippine Bank of Communications (PBCOM)
filed a petition for extrajudicial foreclosure of the
real estate mortgage executed in its favor by
First Sarmiento Property Holdings, Inc. (First
Sarmiento). The real estate was auctioned and
sold to PBCOM as the highest bidder. First
Sarmiento filed a complaint for annulment of the
REM with the RTC. First Sarmiento paid the
docket fees for actions incapable of pecuniary
estimation. After the complaint had been filed,
the ex-officio sheriff issued the certificate of sale
in PBCOM's favor. PBCOM asserted that the
Regional Trial Court failed to acquire
jurisdiction over First Sarmiento's Complaint
because the action for annulment of mortgage
was a real action; thus, the filing fees filed
should have been based on the fair market
value of the mortgaged properties. The RTC
dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction,
holding that First Sarmiento failed to pay the
95

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

appropriate filing fees. Was the dismissal of the
action correct?
A.

No. The complaint for annulment or cancellation of
a REM is incapable of pecuniary estimation, even if
the property had already been foreclosed when the
complaint was filed, since the ownership and
possession of the property remained with petitioner.
This is because at the time the complaint was filed,
the certificate of sale was not yet registered with the
Registry of Deeds. (First Sarmiento Holdings, Inc.
v. Phil. Bank of Communications, 19 June 2018,
Leonen, J...) 9

Q.

May the trial court allow the payment by
installment of the docket fee where the plaintiff
pleads financial difficulty?

A.

Yes. The SC gave its imprimatur to a part-payment
scheme of the docket fee for a period of 2 years
which was well within the prescriptive period. The
judge in his discretion may allow this part-payment
of the docket fee especially where the amount of
the docket fee is large. In this case, the judge
allowed an initial payment of P25,000 and then
P20,000 every month until paid. The docket fees
were in fact fully paid in one year. (Sps. Go v. Tong,
G.R. 151942, 27 Nov 03).

RULE 1
General Provisions

The Marcos Estate filed a motion to dismiss for
non-payment of docket fees which it argued
should be based on the amount of the judgment
award sought to be enforced. M et al. countered
that an action to enforce a foreign judgment is
incapable of pecuniary estimation; hence the
rate of PhP 610 is sufficient. Should the docket
fees be computed based on the amount of the
judgment award sought to be enforced?

A.

No. S7(a) R141 relied upon by the RTC judge covers
only money claims against an estate not based on a
judgment. Although the complaint may have been
lodged against an estate, the schedule of fees for
cases incapable of pecuniary estimation does not
apply in the case at bar. Nonetheless, for purposes
of classification under the governing procedural rule,
this foreign judgment may be subsumed under
S7(b)(3) R141, or class of actions not involving
property. (Mijares et al. vs Ranada, 12 April 05)

Q.

In the proceedings for the settlement of the
estate of Alice, a contingent money claim for
commission in the event of the sale of
properties of the estate was filed by Alan with
the probate court. The executrix moved for the
dismissal of the claim on the ground that the
docket fee under S7(a) R141 was not paid. The
RTC dismissed the money claim. Was the
dismissal proper?

A.

No. The trial court has jurisdiction to act on a money
claim even without payment of separate docket
fees because the probate court had already
assumed jurisdiction over the proceeding for
settlement of the estate of the deceased. Nonpayment of the docket fee for a money claim is not
97

a ground for its dismissal. The probate court should
just order the payment of the docket fees within a
reasonable time. (Sheker v. Estate of Sheker, G.R.
No. 157912, 13 December 2007).
Q.

Are docket fees required for a motion to enter
into the records an attorney's lien?
For a
motion to enforce attorney's lien?

A.

No docket fees are required for a motion to enter
into the records an attorney's lien because this is
merely an initial step involving the registration of
the lien. However, a motion for the enforcement of
the lien is in the nature of an action commenced by
a lawyer against his clients for attorney's fees. As
in every action for a sum of money, the attorneymovant must first pay the prescribed docket fees
before the trial court can acquire jurisdiction to
order the payment of attorney's fees. (Navarez v.
Abrogar, 2 September 2015, Brion, J.).

Q.

What are the instances when the docket fees
need not be paid at the commencement of the

suit? (Keyword: ACHITA)
A.
1) If the damages or claims arose 2 fter the filing of

awards damages not prayed for in the

Q.

Defendant obtained loans from Manila Bank
evidenced by promissory notes in the total
principal amount of P6,945,000 with interest.
Defendant failed to pay the loan and was sued
by Manila Bank before the RTC. The complaint
prayed that judgment be rendered ordering the
defendant to pay plaintiff the principal sum
of PG,945,642, plus interests, penalties, and
attorney's fees computed up to the date of
actual payment pursuant to the corresponding
Promissory Notes. Manila Bank paid the docket
fee on the PG,945,642 claim but not on the
interests, penalties, and attorney's fees. Judgment
was rendered in favor of Manila Bank. May the
judgment be set aside for lack of jurisdiction?

A.

Yes. Manila Bank argues that it could not have paid
the docket fee on the interests, penalties, and
attorney's fees since this could not have been
computed yet at the time of the filing of the
99

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

complaint as the date of actual payment could not
be foreseen. While this argument is true as for the
interests, etc. accruing after the filing of the
complaint, it is not so with those which have
accrued as of the time of the filing of the complaint.
Manila Bank could have easily computed the latter
amounts and paid the docket fee thereon. Hence
for failure of Manila Bank to pay the correct docket
fees, the court did not acquire jurisdiction to award
Manila Bank's claims and thus the case should be
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction due to nonpayment of filing fees. (Dragon v. Manila Banking
Corp., 6 March 2019, Leanen, J.). 10

Q.

Plaintiff filed a complaint praying for the
recovery of the sum of P450,000. Later on the
Plaintiff amended its complaint by increasing
the amount sought to be recovered to P600,000.
Does the court have jurisdiction over the
amended complaint?

A.

Yes. The lower court acquired jurisdiction over the
case when the plaintiff paid the docket fee
corresponding to its claim in its original complaint.
Its failure to pay the docket fee corresponding to its
increased claim for damages under the amended
complaint should not be considered as having
curtailed the lower court's jurisdiction. Pursuant to
the ruling in Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. v. Asuncion,
1

°The issue of non-payment of the correct docket fee was raised by the
defendant only after judgment, in its reply to plaintiffs opposition to defendant's
motion for reconsideration. Nonetheless the Supreme Court held that lack of
jurisdiction could be raised at any stage and could not be the subject of estoppel.
Compare with National Steel Corp. v. Court of Appeals, 302 SCRA 522. It is
submitted that the National Steel Corp. doctrine, i.e., that the ground of nonpayment of docket fee is waived if not timely raised, is the controlling one since a
standing doctrine can be overturned only by the Supreme Court en bane. (Sec.
4[3], Article VIII of the Constitution).

the unpaid docket fee should be considered as a

the amount of P600,000.00 as its claim for
damages in its amended complaint. (International
Container Terminal Services Inc v. City of Manila,
17 Oct 2018, Leanen, J.).
Q.

Should the docket fees on a supplemental
complaint be paid at the time of its filing or
should such fees be treated as a first lien on the
judgment award?

A.

The docket fees should be paid at the time of the
filing of the supplemental complaint; otherwise the
supplemental complaint should be expunged. Of
course the original complaint on which docket fees
have already been paid should still stand. (Do-All
Metal Industries, Inc. v. Security Bank Corp., 10

RULE 2. CAUSE OF ACTION
Q.

What is a cause of action?

A.

It is the act or omission by which a party violates a
right of another. (S2 R2). The facts which give rise
to a right of action. STEVEN H. GIFIS, LAW
DICTIONARY 30 (1975). A cause of action implies
that there is some person in existence who can
bring suit and also a person who can lawfully be
sued. (Douglas v. Beasly, 40 Ala. 148). Also, the
formal statement in a pleading of such act or
omission. (Multi-Realty Dev't Corp. v. Makati
Tuscany Condominium Corp., G.R. No. 146726, 16
June 2006). In the latter sense, it is used
interchangeably and synonymously with "claim."
(See S1 & 3 R6, S2[b] R7, S2 R8).

Q.

What is the importance of a cause of action?

A.

Every ordinary civil action must be based on a
cause of action. Otherwise the complaint may be
dismissed for failure to state a cause of action or a
judgment may be rendered against the plaintiff for
lack of cause of action.
Also a party may not institute more than one
suit for a single cause of action. (S3 R2).

Q.

Define the following terms:
1) Right of action,
2) Relief.
3) Remedy.
4) Subject matter.
102

J9JC9B0M

RULE 2

Cause Of Action
A.

1)

Right of action. The remedial right or right to
relief granted by law to a party to institute an
action against a person who has violated his
right; the legal right to sue.

2)

Relief. The redress or other measure which a
plaintiff prays the court to order or adjudicate in
his favor.

3)

Remedy. The form or type of action which the
plaintiff may avail of in order to obtain relief
from the court.

4)

Subject matter.The thing, act, contract, or
property which is directly involved in the action,
concerning which the wrong has been done.

Q.

Illustrate the foregoing terms.

A.

Plaintiff lent P500,000 to Defendant. The loan is
secured by a real estate mortgage executed by X in
favor of the Plaintiff. The Defendant failed to pay the
loan on the due date despite demand from Plaintiff.
Cause of action: The Defendant's non-payment
of the loan on due date.
Right of action: The substantive right on the
part of the Plaintiff to sue for redress.
Remedies: Action for collection of sum of money
against the Defendant. Action for foreclosure of the
real estate mortgage against the mortgagor X.
Relief: Payment of the loan, foreclosure of the
real estate mortgage, and damages and interests
under Article 2209, Civil Code.
103

PRiMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Subject matter. The contract of loan between
the Plaintiff and the Defendant.
Q.

Distinguish a cause of action from a right of action.

A. The term "right of action" is the right to commence
and maintain an action. In the law of pleadings, right
of action is distinguished from cause of action in that
the former is a remedial right belonging to some
persons while the latter is a formal statement of the
operational facts that give rise to such remedial right.
The former is a matter of right and depends on the
substantive law while the latter is a matter of statute
and is governed by the law of procedure. The right of
action springs from the cause of action but does not
accrue until all the facts which constitute the cause
of action have accrued. (Multi-Realty Dev't Corp. v.
Makati Tuscany Condominium Corp., G.R. 146726,
16 June 2006).
Right of action is the legal right to sue while
cause of action is the facts which give rise to a right
of action. STEVEN H. GIFIS, LAW DICTIONARY 30
(1975). Hence in reference to a prescriptive period
to bring an action, it is more precise to say that the
period starts to run from the accrual of the right of
action, not from "the accrual of the cause of action."
(See for instance, Article 1144 of the Civil Code).
Q.

May there be a cause of action without
corresponding right of action?

a

A. Yes. There may be a cause of action but with no
right of action if the latter is barred by prescription.
(1 BOUVIER'S LAW DICTIONARY 436 [1914]). For
instance the maker did not pay a promissory note,
but no action was brought within 10 years from the
time the note became due and demandable.
104

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE2

Cause Of Action
Q.

Is there a cause of action in proceedings for
declaratory relief?

A. Yes because of the expanded concept of cause of
actions in proceedings for declaratory relief. The
concept of cause of actions in declaratory relief is
not, as in ordinary civil action, the wrong or delict by
which the Plaintiff's rights are violated, but is
extended to a mere denial, refusal or challenge
raising at least an uncertainty or insecurity which is
injurious to plaintiff's rights. (Multi-Realty Dev't Corp.
v. Makati Tuscany Condominium Corp., supra). It is
permitted on the theory that courts should be
allowed to act, not only when harm is actually done
and rights jeopardized by physical wrongs or
physical attack upon existing legal relation, but also
when challenge, refusal, dispute, or denial thereof is
made amounting to a live controversy. (Id.).
Q.

What is meant by "splitting a cause of action"?

A.

It is when a party institutes more than one suit for a
single cause of action (S3 R2).

Q.

What is the effect of splitting a cause of action?

A. The filing of one is a ground for the dismissal of the
others (litis pendentia). A judgment upon the merits
in any one is available as a ground for the dismissal
of the others (res judicata).
Q.

SRBI mortgaged several parcels of land to
Metrobank as security for its loan. Then SRBI and
Metrobank entered into a credit line agreement
with the same mortgaged properties as collateral.
SRBI defaulted and Metrobank filed a petition
for extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgage.
Subsequently, Metrobank filed an action for
105

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

collection of money arising from the export bill
purchases under the credit line agreement.
Metrobank bought the properties at the
foreclosure but the bid price was below SRBl's
obligations. SRBI moved to dismiss the action
for collection on the ground that Metrobank is
splitting its cause of action. Should the motion
to dismiss be granted?

A. Yes. Under Act 3135, the mortgage creditor in case
of insufficiency of the proceeds of the foreclosure
sale is entitled to claim the deficiency from the
debtor. However the action filed by Metrobank was
not an action to recover the deficiency but an action
for collection or specific performance which was
barred by the election of the remedy of foreclosure.
The same should thus be dismissed without
prejudice to Metrobank's institution of an action ffi(
recovery of the deficiency. ( Suico Rattan and Buri
v. Court of Appeals, G.R. 138145, 15 June 2006).

Q.

P sued D for specific performance of a contract.
The court decided in favor of D and dismissed
P's complaint. After the dismissal had become
final, P sued D to have the same contract
reformed to make it conform to their true intent
and to recover upon the reformed contract. Is
the second action barred by res judicata?

A. Yes. P only had one cause of action on the
contract, whether as written or as reformed, which
he could have stated in the alternative pursuant to
S2 RS. P thus split a single cause of action.

RULE 2
Cause Of Action

Q.

Petitioner filed with the CFI a complaint against
the Private Respondent in 1969 for quieting of
title with damages, wherein the former seeks to
be declared the owner of the subject land.
In 1970, the Private Respondent dispossessed
Petitioner of the land in question and stayed
there until January 1978. The Private Respondent
won in the CFI but the CA reversed and
declared the Petitioner as the owner of the
subject land and ordered the Private Respondent
to pay Petitioner P56.40 as the latter's share in
the proceeds of the sale of the copra from the
coconuts harvested in the land.
The decision became final and executory in
2 February 1978. In 6 February 1978, Petitioner
filed a second case with the CFI against Private
Respondent seeking to recover from the latter
the incomes from the subject land from 1970 up
to January 1978 when possession of the land
was delivered to the Petitioner. Private
Respondent filed a motion to dismiss the
second case on the ground of res judicata.
Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

A.

Yes. The Petitioner was splitting his cause of action
when he filed the second case for both the first and
the second cases involve the same cause of action.
The Petitioner would draw a distinction between the
land in dispute in the first case and the income from
that land being claimed in the second case. But that
is splitting hairs to split a cause of action. The
subject-matter is essentially the same in both cases
as the income is only a consequence or accessory
of the disputed property. It cannot be said that there
are two causes of action calling for two separate
cases. The claim for the income from the land was
107

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

incidental to, and should have been raised by
Petitioner in his earlier claim for ownership of the
land by filing a supplemental complaint. (Bayang v.
Court of Appeals, 148 SCRA 91).
Otherwise put, such claim is but the result of
the original cause of action, viz., the continuing
refusal by the Private Respondent to recognize
Petitioner's ownership over the property. ( See
Jalandoni v. Martin-Guanzon, 102 Phil. 859). It
should also be noted that under S47(b) R39, a
judgment or final order is conclusive between the
parties "with respect to the matter directly adjudged
or as to any other matter that could have been
raised in relation thereto." (Italics supplied).
Q.

Francisco Entierro died intestate. His surviving
spouse and five of his children executed a deed
of declaration of heirship and sale wherein they
stated that they are the sole heirs of Francisco
and wherein they sold the inherited land to the
Petitioners, the spouses Selga. Claiming that he
is a legitimate child of Francisco and that the
declaration of heirship and sale preterited him,
Respondent filed a complaint against the
Petitioners for annulment of sale and damages
with the RTC (Civil Case No. 276) with respect
to his share in the land sold. Respondent also
prayed therein that he be allowed to exercise
the right of legal redemption with respect to the
share of the other co-heirs sold to the
Petitioners. The RTC granted the annulment of
the sale with respect to Respondent's 1/11
share. However there was nothing in the
decision with respect to the prayer for legal
redemption. Respondent appealed the decision
in CC 276 but later on withdrew his appeal
108

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 2
Cause Of Action

resulting in the decision therein becoming final
and executory. Subsequently Respondent filed
a complaint for legal redemption (Civil Case No.
573) with respect to the 10/11 share of the land
sold to the Petitioners.
Petitioners filed a
motion to dismiss on the ground of res judicata.
a) Should the motion to dismiss be granted?
b) Would your answer be the same if Respondent
had not included a relief for legal
redemption in his complaint?
A.
a)

Yes. S2 R2 defines a cause of action as "the
act or omission by which a party violates a right
of another." The cause of action in Civil Case
No. 276 and Civil Case No. 573 is the sale of
the entire subject property by Basilia, et al., to
petitioners without respondent's knowledge and
consent, hence, depriving respondent of her
rights and interests over her pro-indiviso share
in the subject property as a co-heir and coowner. The annulment of the sale of
respondent's share in the subject property, the
legal redemption by respondent of her co-heirs'
share sold to petitioners, and the claim for
damages should not be mistaken to be the
causes of action, but they were the remedies
and reliefs prayed for by the respondent to
redress the wrong allegedly committed against
her. Hence the withdrawal by respondent of his
appeal from the RTC decision in CC 276 (which
did not grant redemption to respondent), with
the result that the judgment therein became
final and executory, precluded the respondent
109

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

from filing CC 573 for legal redemption since
the latter was barred by res judicata. ( Selga v.
Brar, 21 September 2011 ).
b) Yes my answer would be the same. Res judicata
would apply regardless of whether or not
Respondent had prayed for legal redemption in
his complaint. Under S47(b) R39, a judgment is
conclusive between the parties with respect to
the matter directly adjudged or as to any other
matter that could have been raised in relation
thereto. The relief of legal redemption is a
matter that could have been raised in relation
to the case.

Subsequently, CCA filed a second complaint
against RGC for the expected business profits it
should have derived from the unexpired twoyear term of the agreement but did not because
of the pretermination of the agreement. RGC
filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of res
judicata. CCA opposed the motion on the
grounds that: (a) the two cases involve different
causes of action, and (b) the parties had
stipulated in the "non-waiver" clause that the
compromise agreement was without prejudice
to CCA's cause of action arising from the
pretermination of the Management and Royalty
Agreement. Should the motion to dismiss
be granted?
A.

Yes.
a)

Both the first and the second cases involve the
same cause of action, that is, the breach by
RGC of the Management and Royalty
Agreement. CCA confuses the reliefs sought
(collection of the unpaid management and
royalty fees, and the claim for the expected
profits for the unexpired two-year term) with the
cause of action. A cause of action may give rise
to several reliefs, but only one action can be
filed. A single cause of action or entire claim or
demand cannot be split up or divided into two
or more different actions. Here the single cause
of action gave rise to two reliefs which should
have been sought by CCA in the first complaint.
Hence CCA was splitting its cause of action
when it brought the second complaint.

b) The stipulation is void for it in effect allows the
plaintiff CCA to split its cause of action. The
111

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

provisions on res judicata and against splitting
of cause of action are based on public policy.
Hence the stipulation is repugnant to public
policy and is thus void and unenforceable.

Q.

Nasugatan sued Sagasa for injuries he suffered
when Sagasa drove his car recklessly and
bumped into Nasugatan. Sagasa confessed
judgment and was adjudged to pay PS,000.00.
Nasugatan became blind because of the injuries
he sustained in the accident. He filed another
suit against Sagasa, this time for P100,000.00.
May Sagasa plead the filing of the first
complaint in abatement of the second suit and
contend that the judgment on the merits in the
first case constitutes a bar in the second?
Explain. (86 Bar Q1).

A.

Yes, Sagasa may plead that the judgment in the
first case constitutes a bar in the second.
Under S4 R2, if two suits are instituted on the
basis of the same cause of action, a judgment upon
the merits in any one is available as a ground for
the dismissal of the other.
Here the second suit involves the same cause
of action: Sagasa's reckless driving which violated
the right of Nasugatan. In other words Nasugatan's
blindness resulted from the same reckless act of
Sagasa. Hence the second suit is barred by the
judgment in the first suit.

Q.

P filed with the RTC an accion reivindicatoria
over a parcel of rice land against D, alleging that
the same was sold to him by the rightful owner S
112

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE2
Cause Of Action

and praying that he (P) be declared the owner of
the land and that D deliver possession to him. D
filed an answer in which he also counterclaimed
for moral and exemplary damages for the
unwarranted filing of the suit by P.
During the pendency of the case, P
dispossessed D of the subject land and
proceeded to harvest the rice. Judgment was
rendered by the RTC dismissing P's suit. The
judgment became final. P delivered possession
back to D. D then filed an action before the RTC
against P seeking to recover the value of the ric~
harvested by P. P filed a motion to dismiss on
the ground of res judicata. Should the motion to
dismiss be granted?

A. No. The claim for recovery of the harvested rice need
not be set up in the first case as such claim is not
compulsory having been acquired by D after serving
his answer. Hence the claim is not barred even if not
set up in the first case. (S8 & 9, R11; Namarco v.
Federation of United Namarco Distributors, 49
SCRA 238 [31 Jan 1973]). It could be made subject
(Banco de Oro Universal
of a separate case.
Bank v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 160354, 25
August 2005).

Q.

In 1992, Respondent's father, Rafael, obtained
from the Petitioner a loan of P160,000 with
monthly interest of 5% payable within 6 months
and secured by a real estate mortgage. Rafael
failed to settle his loan upon maturity despite
demands and thus Petitioner filed a complaint
for judicial foreclosure of REM with the RTC.
The RTC issued a 30 January 1998 Decision
reducing the interest rate from 5% per month to
113

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

12% per annum and ordering Rafael to pay the
Petitioner P229,000. Records did not show
whether this decision attained finality. Meanwhile
prior to Rafael's notice of the above decision,
Respondent agreed to pay Rafael's obligation to
Petitioner which was pegged at P689,000. After
making a total payment of P400,000, he executed
a promissory note dated 20 February 1998,
binding himself to pay on or before 31 March
1998 the amount of P289,000.00, "representing
the balance of the agreed financial obligation of
[his] father to [Petitioner]." After learning of the
30 January 1998 Decision, Respondent refused
to pay the amount covered by the PN despite
demands, prompting Petitioner to file a complaint
for sum of money and damages before the court
the RTC in July 1998. Respondent filed a motion
to dismiss the collection case arguing that it
involves the same cause of action as the
foreclosure suit. Should the_motion to dismiss
be granted?
A.

Yes. The Petitioner, as creditor-mortgagee, instituted
an action for judicial foreclosure in order to recover
on Rafael's debt. The availment of such remedy
bars recourse to the subsequent filing of a personal
action for collection of the same debt, in this case,
under the principle of litis pendentia, considering
that the foreclosure case only remains pending as it
was not shown to have attained finality. While the
ensuing collection case was anchored on the
promissory note executed by Respondent who was
not the original debtor, the same does not
constitute a separate and distinct contract of loan
which would have given rise to a separate cause of
action upon breach. The reasons are that: (a) the
114

J9JC9B0M

RULE2

Cause Of Action
consideration for the subject PN was the same
consideration that supported the original loan
obligation of Rafael; and (b) Respondent merely
assumed to pay Rafael's remaining unpaid balance
in the latter's behalf, i.e., as Rafael's agent or
representative. Hence the subject PN did not give
rise to a separate cause of action. (Marilag v.
Martinez, 22 July 2015, Perlas-Bernabe, J.).
Q.

P and D entered into a contract whereby D will
supply P from month to month with gas tar at
the price of P65 per ton. The contract was to run
for 10 years, starting from 1919. D began
delivering but in 1920 "flatly refused to make
any deliveries under the contract." In 1923, P
brought an action for damages against D. P
was awarded damages up to 1923. The judgment
became final and executory. Later P brought an
action to recover damages from 1924 up to
1929. D filed a motion to dismiss this suit on the
ground of res judicata. Should the motion to
dismiss be granted?

A.

Yes. P in bringing the second suit had split his
cause of action. As a general rule, a contract to do
several things at several times is divisible, and a
judgment for a single breach of a continuing
contract is not a bar to a suit for subsequent
breaches. Where however the obligor manifests
refusal to perform not only one prestation but all
the other prestations, the "contract is entire and the
breach total" and constitutes only one cause of
action. (Blossom & Co. v. Manila Gas Corp., 55
Phil. 226). P in 1923 could thus bring an action for
damages up to 1929 under the principle of
anticipatory breach since D in 1920 had made a
115

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

flat or outright refusal to make any delivery
under the contract.
Q.

What is the principle of anticipatory breach?

A.

It is the principle wherein in a divisible contract or
one contemplating divisible prestations over a period
of time and there is a breach of one prestation, the
obligee may bring a suit not only for the current
prestation but even for the future prestations if it is
clear that the obliger can no longer or will no longer
perform the future prestations.

Q.

In the prior problem concerning the gas tar
contract, what if D in 1920 failed to make further
deliveries but without any flat or outright refusal
to make any delivery under the contract.
Should the motion to dismiss by D be granted?

A.

No since the principle of anticipatory breach does
not come into play. Hence each single breach of
the divisible obligation is a separate and distinct
cause of action.

Q.

Plaintiff ordered 2 units frequency converter/
inverter from Defendant to be delivered within 8
to 10 weeks from the opening of the letter of
credit or until 19 November 1997. On 9
November 1997 Defendant informed Plaintiff that
it was
with its supplier
having problems
regarding the delivery of the units, that it was
looking for another supplier, and that at that
moment there was no clear message when
normal production would resume. Due to this
information, the Plaintiff surmised that Defendant
would not be able to deliver the units on time
and hence the
Plaintiff cancelled the order.
Plaintiff filed an action for damages against the

116

J9JC9B0M

RULE2

Cause Of Action

Defendant averring the foregoing facts. The
Defendant filed an answer raising the affirmative
defense of failure to state a cause of action.
Should the affirmative be granted?
A.

Q.

Yes. When Plaintiff sued Defendant for damages,
the latter had not violated any right of Plaintiff from
which a cause of action had arisen. Plaintiff only
surmised that Defendant would not be able to
deliver the
units on time and based on this
apprehension, it cancelled the order. The principle
of anticipatory breach laid down in the textbook
case of Blossom & Co. v. Manila Gas Corp., 55
Phil 226, is not applicable here for the same only
applies to a divisible contract (supply of gas for
10 years) where the obliger had manifested his
refusal to comply with future periodic obligations.
Here the obligation was single and indivisible, to
deliver two units of frequency converter/inverter by
19 November 1997. (Oanfoss, Inc. v. Continental
Cement Corp., 9 Sep 05).

Lessor entered into a lease agreement over
agricultural land with lessee in 2000. The lessee
often made delayed rental payments and even
missed some altogether. On 1 March 2010 lessor
sent a demand letter to lessee to vacate the
premises which lessee did not heed. Lessor thus
filed an unlawful detainer case in the MTC
against lessee. Subsequently lessor also filed
with the RTC a complaint for sum of money to
recover the rentals in arrears from January 2003
to February 2010. Lessee filed a motion to
dismiss the RTC case on the ground of lis
pendens, stating that both cases involve the
same cause of action and hence such rentals in
arrears should be recovered in the unlawful
117

..

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

detainer case. Should the motion to dismiss
be granted?

A.

No. Both cases involve different cause of action. In
unlawful detainer, the recoverable damages are
reckoned from the time the possession of the
property becomes unlawful, since the cause of
action is the lessee's refusal to vacate despite
demand. Here the demand to vacate was made
only on 1 March 2010, thus, it was only after said
demand that lessee's continued possession of the
leased properties became unlawful. Prior to the
lapse of the 15-day period to vacate the property as
stated in the demand letter, the damages sustained
from January 2003 to February 2010 do not have a
direct relation to lessor's loss of material
possession since they do not result from lessee's
refusal to vacate the leased premises. These
damages must be claimed in an ordinary action, as
in the complaint for collection of sum of money.
(Lajave Agricultural Mgt & Devt Corp. v. Javellana,
7 November 2018, Peralta, J.).

SEC. 5. Joinder of causes of action
Q.

What are the rules governing joinder of causes
of action?

A. A party may in one pleading assert, in the
alternative or otherwise, as many causes of action
as he may have against an opposing party, subject
to the following conditions: (Keyword: JISM).
1) The party joining the causes of action must
comply with the rule on joinder of parties
under S6 R3.

118

J9JC9B0M

RULE2
Cause Of Action

2) The joinder must not include special civil
actions or actions governed by special rules.
3)

If the causes of action are between the same
parties but the causes of action pertain to
different venues or jurisdictions, the joinder
may be allowed in the RTC provided that one of
the causes of action falls within its jurisdiction
and the venue lies therein.

4)

If the claims in all the causes of action are
principally for recovery of money, the aggregate
amount claimed shall be the test of jurisdiction.
(S5 R2).

Q.

What is the reason for the requirement under
S5(b) R2 that the joinder of causes of action
must not include special civil actions or actions
governed by special rules?

A.

In order to avoid confusion in the conduct of the
proceedings as well as in the determination of the
presence of the requisite elements of each
particular cause of action. (1 FLORENZ D.
REGALADO, REMEDIAL LAW COMPENDIUM 70
[ih rev. ed., 3rd printing]).

Q.

What is the totality rule?

A.

It is the rule under joinder of causes of action which
states that if the claims in all the causes of action
are principally for recovery of money, the aggregate
amount claimed shall be the test of jurisdiction.
(S5[d] R2).

Q.

When may persons join as plaintiffs or be joined
as defendants in one complaint?

119
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

All persons in whom or against whom any right to
relief in respect to or arising out of the same
transaction or series of transactions is alleged to
exist, whether jointly, severally, or in the alternative,
may, except as otherwise provided in these Rules,
join as plaintiffs or be joined as defendants in one
complaint, where any question of law or fact
common to all such plaintiffs or to all such
defendants may arise in the action. (S6 R3). S6
R3 provides for the rules on joinder of parties.

Q.

Is joinder of parties mandatory or permissive?

A.

It is permissive. The caption of S6 R3 is "[p]ermissive ·
joinder of parties." S6 R3 also states that the
persons may join as plaintiffs or be joined as
defendants.

Q.

What is the meaning of "transaction" as used in

56 R3?
A. "Transaction" as used in S6 R3 means whatever
may be done by one person which affects another's
rights, and out of which a cause of action may
arise, and the term "series of transactions" is
equivalent to "transactions connected with the
same subject of the action. (1 RICARDO J.
FRANCISCO, CIVIL PROCEDURE 102 [2001]).
Hence "transaction" is not limited to agreements or
contracts but also includes acts, omissions, or facts
out of which the cause of action arises.
Q.

Peter, the owner of a parcel of land, files a
complaint for recovery of possession against 30
persons who each occupy a separate and
distinct portion of the land. Is the joinder of
defendants proper?

120
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE2
Cause Of Action

A. Yes. The action arises out of the same transaction,
that is the occupancy by the defendants of Peter's
land. The Supreme Court has implicitly held that
the word "transaction" refers not only to a contract
but to an occurrence. (See Pantranco North
Express v. Standard Insurance, 16 March 2005)
Evidently there is a common question of law:
whether or not the defendants have the right to hold
possession as against Peter.
Q.

P, a Manila resident, filed a complaint against D,
a resident of lloilo City, in the RTC of Manila.
The complaint joins 2 causes of action: one for
collection of PS00,000 and the other for title to
real property in lloilo City with an assessed
value of P20,000, both causes of action being
unrelated to each other. Was there a proper
joinder of causes of action?

A. Yes. Where the causes of action are between the
same parties but pertain to different venues or
jurisdictions, the joinder may be allowed in the RTC
provided one of the causes of action falls within the
jurisdiction of the RTC and the venue lies therein.
(S5[c] R2). Here the sum of money case falls within
the jurisdiction of the RTC of Manila and the venue
lies therein.
The fact that the causes of action are
unrelated to each other does not affect the
propriety of the joinder of causes of action. There is
no need to comply with the rule on joinder of parties
since the causes of action are between the
same parties.

121

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

P filed a complaint in the RTC of Manila. The
complaint joins 2 causes of action: one for
recovery of P350,000 against D and another for
specific performance against E (D's friend)
based on E's undertaking that he will assign
certain shares of stock in favor of P if D defaults
in the payment of the loan. Assume that the
joinder of D and E as defendants complies
with S6 R3. Was there a proper joinder of
causes of action?

A.

No, there was no proper joinder of causes of action.
While one of the causes of action (the one
regarding specific performance which is incapable
of pecuniary estimation) falls within the RTC's
jurisdiction, the other (involving recovery of
P350,000) does not. Hence the latter should be
severed from the complaint.
The rule under S5(c) R2 applies only "where
the causes of action are between the same
parties." Here the causes of action are not between
the same parties since one cause of action is
against D while another is against E. Hence the
joinder is not allowed because one cause of action
falls outside the RTC's jurisdiction.

Q.

P seeks to recover P350,000 from D. P also
entered into a contract for services with D.
However D has breached a material provision of
the contract for services. P filed a complaint
against D before the MTC of Manila wherein he
joins the causes of action for recovery and for
rescission. Should the joinder of causes of
action be allowed?

122
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE2

Cause Of Action
A.

No, the joinder of causes of action should not
be allowed.
While the MTC has jurisdiction over the cause
of action involving recovery, it has no jurisdiction
over the cause of action involving rescission which
is incapable of pecuniary estimation.
Hence the cause of action involving the
rescission should be severed.
Note that the provision allowing joinder of causes
of action which pertains to different jurisdictions under
S5(c) R2 applies only if the joinder is in the RTC.

Q.

P files a complaint against D with the RTC of
Manila wherein he joins two causes of action:
one for collection of a loan in the amount of
P450,000 and another for collection of a loan in
the amount of P350,000. Was there a proper
joinder of causes of action?

A.

No. Under S5(c) R2, the joinder shall not include
actions governed by special rules. Here the action
for collection of P350,000 is governed by the Rules
of Procedure for Small Claims Cases (RSCC) since
it does not exceed P400,000. Hence the joinder of
causes of actions is improper.

Q.

Same facts as in the preceding question except
that the second cause of action is for recovery
of damages amounting to P350,000 arising from
quasi-delict. Was there a proper joinder of causes
of action?

A.

Yes. The second cause of action would not be
covered by the RSCC since claims for damages
arising from fault or negligence have been removed
from the coverage of the RSCC, nor is it covered by
123

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

the Rule on Summary Procedure since the amount
of the claim or demand exceeds P200,000. Hence
there was a proper joinder of causes of action.
Q.

P files a complaint against D with the RTC of
Manila where he joins two causes of action:
one for collection of a loan of P350,000 and
another for collection of another loan in the
amount of P200,000. D files a motion to dismiss
on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. Should the
motion to dismiss be granted?

A.

Yes. Under S5(c) R2, the joinder shall not include
actions governed by special rules. Here both
causes of action are governed by a special rule,
i.e., the Rule of Procedure for Small Claims Cases.
Hence the joinder of causes of action is not proper
and consequently the totality rule cannot come into
play. The RTC would not have jurisdiction since the
claim in each cause of action does not exceed the
jurisdictional amount of P400,000.

Q.

Perry is a resident of Manila, while Ricky and
Marvin are residents of Batangas City. They are
the co-owners of a parcel of residential land
located in Pasay City with an assessed value of
P100,000. Perry borrowed P450,000 from Ricky
which he promised to pay on or before
December 1, 2020. However, Perry failed to pay
his loan. Perry also rejected Ricky and Marvin's
proposal to partition the property.
Ricky filed a complaint against Perry and
Marvin in the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City
for the partition of the property. He also
incorporated in his complaint his action against

124
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 2

CauseOf Action
Perry for the collection of the latter's P450,000
loan plus interests and attorney's fees.
State with reasons whether it was proper for
Ricky to join his causes of action in his complaint
for partition against Perry and Marvin in the
Regional Trial Court of Pasay City. (05 Bar Q3ed).
A.

It was not proper for Ricky to join his causes of
action in his complaint for the following reasons:
(1) Under the Rules of Civil Procedure, the joinder
shall not include special civil actions. (S5(b) R2).
Here one of the actions joined is for partition
which is a special civil action. Hence the joinder
was improper.
(2) Under S5(a) R2 in relation to S6 R3, the joinder
of causes of action must comply with the rule
on joinder of parties. Here the claim against
Perry and Marvin for partition and the collection
claim against Perry did not comply with the rule
on joinder of parties since the claims did not
arise from the same transaction or series of
transactions nor is there any common question
of law or fact. (S5[a] R2, S6 R3).
(3) Finally, the venue of one of the causes of
action, that is the one involving the collection of
P450,000, is misplaced since none of the
parties reside in Pasay City. The exceptive
clause under S5(c) R2 -- which provides that
the joinder of causes of action may be allowed
in the RTC even if they pertain to different
venues or jurisdictions provided that one of the
causes of actions falls within the RTC's
jurisdiction and venue lies therein -- is not
125

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

applicable because the causes of action are not
between the same parties.

Q.

Raphael, a warehouseman, filed a complaint
against V Corporation, X Corporation and Y
Corporation to compel them to interplead. He
alleged therein that the three corporations
claimed title and right of possession over the
goods deposited in his warehouse and that he
was uncertain which of them was entitled to the
goods. After due proceedings, judgment was
rendered by the court declaring
that X
Corporation was entitled to the goods. The
decision became final and executory.

Raphael filed a complaint
against X
Corporation for the payment of P100,000 for
storage charges and other advances for the
goods. X Corporation filed a motion to dismiss
the complaint on the ground of res judicata. X
Corporation alleged that Raphael should have
incorporated in his complaint for interpleader
his claim for storage fees and advances and that
for his failure he was barred from interposing his
claim. Raphael replied that he could not have
claimed storage fees and other advances in his
complaint for interpleader because he was not
yet certain as to who was liable therefor. Resolve
the motion with reasons. (05 Bar Q4).
A.

I would deny the motion to dismiss on the ground of
res judicata.
An interpleader suit is not based on a cause of
action since there is no act or omission by which
the defendants violated the right of the complainant.
The complainant is simply seeking to compel the
126

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE2
Cause Of Action

defendants to interplead among themselves.
Hence the concepts of res judicata and splitting of
cause of action would find no application since the
complaint is not based on a cause of action.
X corporation's argument that Raphael should
have incorporated in his complaint for interpleader
his claim for storage fees and advances is incorrec~
since joinder of causes of action shall not include
special civil actions like interpleader. (S5 R2).
Q.

May an action for injunction be joined in one
complaint together with an action for quieting
of title?

A. No. S5 R2 provides that the joinder of causes of
action shall not include special civil actions. The
joinder of an action for injunction with an action for
quieting of title is not allowed under S5 R2 since
the latter is a special civil action. (Salvador v.
Patricia, Inc., 9 Nov 2016, Bersamin, J.).
Q.

May interpleader be joined
relief in one complaint?

with

declaratory

A. No, since both are special civil actions. Such joinder
would be violative of S5(b) R2. (Belo Medical Group
v. Santos, 30 August 2017, Leanen, J.).
Q.

May a court order a plaintiff to join causes of action?

A.

No, a court may not order the joinder of causes of
action since there is nothing in S6 R2 (misjoinder of
causes of action) which empowers the court to do
so. Compare with S11 R3 (misjoinder and
nonjoinder of parties) which provides that parties
may be dropped or added by order of the court
upon motion or sua sponte. (JOSE FERIA, 1997
RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 6 [1997]).

A.
1)

Q.

The Santos Subdivision Homeowner's Association
(SSHA) filed a suit against the Petitioner seeking
to compel her to provide an open space for
Santos Subdivision. The records are bereft of any
showing that SSHA is an association duly
organized under Philippine law. The Petitioner
filed a motion to dismiss with the HLURB on the
ground of lack of legal personality of SSHA to
sue. The HLRB denied the motion to dismiss
treating the action as a suit by all the parties who
signed and verified the complaint. Should the
HLRB have dismissed the complaint?

11

1n Ventura v. Militante, 316 SCRA 226, and Galindo v. Roxas, 17
January 2005, the Supreme Court stated that an estate of a deceased person
cannot be a party in a court action. Perusal of these rulings reveal however that
the estate was not properly represented by its heirs or by an executor or
administrator.

128

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 3
Parties To Civil Actions

A.

Yes. Article 44 of the Civil Code enumerates the
various classes of juridical persons. Under said
Article, an association is considered a juridical
person if the law grants it a personality separate
and distinct from that of its members. SSHA was
not duly organized under Philippine law. Hence for
failing to show that it is a juridical entity, endowed
by law with capacity to bring suits in its own name,
SSHA is devoid of any legal capacity, whatsoever,
to institute any action. Under S1 R3 only natural or
juridical persons, or entities authorized by law may
be parties in a civil action. Nor is it proper for the
HLRB to treat the complaint as a suit by the signing
members. The members cannot represent their
association without valid legal authority. (Duenas v.

when it issued Minute Resolution No. 12-0859,

parties," and that petitioner Hernandez "is a Tax
Payer and the Lead Convenor of the Association
of Flood Victims. Do petitioners have the legal
capacity to sue?
A.

No. Clearly, petitioner Association of Flood Victims,
which is still in the process of incorporation, cannot
be considered a juridical person or an entity
authorized by law, which can be a party to a
civil action.
Petitioner Association of Flood Victims is an
unincorporated association not endowed with a
distinct personality of its own. An unincorporated
association, in the absence of an enabling law, has
no juridical personality and thus, cannot sue in the
name of the association. Such unincorporated
association is not a legal entity distinct from its
members. If an association, like petitioner Association
of Flood Victims, has no juridical personality, then
all members of the association must be made
parties in the civil action.
In this case, other than his bare allegation that
he is the lead convenor of the Association of Flood
Victims, petitioner Hernandez showed no proof that
he was authorized by said association. Aside from
petitioner Hernandez, no other member was made
signatory to the petition. Only petitioner Hernandez
signed the Verification and Sworn Certification
Against Forum Shopping, stating that he caused
the preparation of the petition. There was no
accompanying document showing that the other
members of the Association of Flood Victims
authorized petitioner Hernandez to represent them
and the association in the petition. (Association

Q.

A petition for certiorari was filed with the
Supreme Court. It was brought in the name of
"Resident Marine Mammals of the Protected
Seascape Tanon Strait, Joined in and Represented
by Human Beings Gloria Entenzo Ramos and
Rose-Liza Eisma Osorio in their capacity as
Stewards of God's Creations." The suit was
brought against the DENR Secretary and Japan
Petroleum Exploration Co. Ltd. and sought to
stop petroleum exploration activities in the
Tanon Strait on the ground that this would
cause environmental damage to the Tanon
Strait and damage the ocean life therein. The
Respondents filed an answer raising the
affirmative defense of failure to state a cause of
action. The Respondents argue that animals
cannot be real parties in interest. May animals
be real parties in interest?

A.

No. Our laws provide that only natural or juridical
persons or entities authorized by law may be parties
in a civil action. However the petition should not be
dismissed on this ground. The need to give the
Resident Marine Mammals legal standing has been
eliminated by our Rules of Procedure for
Environmental Cases, which allow any Filipino
citizen, as a steward of nature, to bring a suit to
enforce our environmental laws.
It is worth noting here that the Stewards are
joined as real parties in the Petition and not just in
representation of the mammals. The Stewards,
Ramos and Eisma-Osorio, having shown in their
petition that there may be possible violations of laws
131

concerning the habitat of the Resident Marine
Mammals, are therefore declared to possess the
legal standing to file this petition by virtue of our
environmental laws allowing the bringing of citizen
suits. (Resident Marine Mammals of Tanon Strait v.
Reyes, 21 April 2015, e.b., Leonardo-De Castro, J.).
Q.

If the plaintiff is not a natural or juridical person
or an entity authorized by law to be a party,
what is the ground of dismissal?

A. That the plaintiff has no legal capacity to sue.
(S1 [d] R16; see Duenas v. Santos Subdivision
Homeowner's Association, supra; Association of
Flood Victims v. COMELEC, supra).
Q.

In whose name must an action be prosecuted or
defended?

A.

Unless otherwise authorized by law or these Rules,
every action must be prosecuted or defended in the
name of the real party in interest. (S2 R3).

Q.

What is the reason for the rule that every action
must be prosecuted or defended in the name of
the real party in interest?

A. The reason for the rule is that if a person does not
stand to benefit or lose by the judgment, it would be
a waste of time for the court to try the case.
Q.

Does the rule require that a civil action be
prosecuted by the real party in interest?

A.

No. What S2 R3 requires is that a civil action be
prosecuted in the name of but not necessarily by
the real party in interest.

132

J9JC9B0M

RULE 3
Parties To Civil Actions

Hence an action is allowed to be prosecuted or
defended by a representative or someone acting in
a fiduciary capacity but the beneficiary shall be
included in the title of the case and shall be
deemed to be the real party in interest. (S3 R3).
Q.

Who is a real party in interest?

A.

The party who stands to be benefited or injured by
the judgment in the suit or entitled to the avails of
the suit. (S2 R3).

Q.

What is the importance of knowing the definition
of a real party in interest?

A.

It is important since the Rules of Court provide that
every action must be prosecuted or defended in the
name of the real party in interest, unless otherwise
authorized by law or the Rules of Court. (S2 R3).

Q.

If an action is prosecuted or defended in the
name of someone who is not the real party in
interest, what is the remedy of the defendant?

A.

The defendant may file an answer raising the
affirmative defense of failure to state a cause of
action. (FLORENZ D. REGALADO, REMEDIAL LAW
rd
COMPENDIUM 76 [ih rev. ed., 3 printing]). Note
that the ground is not lack of legal capacity to sue.

Q.

lsagani drove the car of his father, Pedro, and
left it in the parking area of the Fairview Motel
where he was a guest. lsagani entrusted the key
of the car to a security guard hired by the Prime
Resort Company, the owner/operator of the
motel. Emilio, pretending to be the brother of
lsagani, got the key from the security guard and
drove away with the car. The car was never
recovered. Later, Pedro sued Prime Resorts for
133

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

the value of the carnapped vehicle plus
damages. Prime Resorts sets up the defense
that Pedro has no interest in the case, hence,
has no cause of action, as he was not the guest
of the motel but his son, lsagani. Is the defense
tenable? (89 Bar Q5.1 ).
A.

The defense that Pedro has no interest in the case
is not tenable.
Under S2 R3 a real party in interest is the party
who stands to be benefited by the judgment in the
suit or the party entitled to the avails of the suit.
Here Pedro owns the car; thus it is clear that
he stands to be benefited by the judgment or that
he is entitled to the avails of the suit. Being the real
party in interest, the objection that he has no cause
of action will not lie. (Di/son Enterprises Inc. v. /AC,
G.R. No. 74964, 27 February 1989).
The argument that it was lsagani not Pedro
who was the guest of the motel is without merit.
The right of action of Pedro is not based on
contract but on law, specifically Article 1999 of the
Civil Code which provides that the hotel-keeper is
liable for the vehicles which have been placed in
the annexes of the hotel. Pedro's right of action
could also be based on quasi-delict under Article
2179 of the Civil Code.

RULE3
Parties To Civil Actions

Marvex, sued Meralco before the RTC for
damages with prayer for preliminary mandatory
injunction. After trial, the RTC dismissed the
complaint on the ground, inter alia, that there
was also no contractual relationship between
Nordec and Meralco, since the service contract
was between Meralco and Marvex. Thus, Nordec
had no cause of action against Meralco. Is it
correct to hold that Nordec had no cause of
action against Meralco?
A.

No. The beneficial users of an electric service have
a cause of action against this distribution utiliti fn ··
Manila Electric Company v. Spouses Chua, 637
Phil. 80, it was the beneficial users who were
awarded damages due to the unjust disconnection
of the electric supply, even though the service
contract with Meralco was registered in the name of
another person.
Further, Meralco is deemed to have knowledge
of the fact that Nordec was the beneficial user of
Marvex's service contract with Meralco. It admits that
the inspections of the metering devices were
conducted in the presence of Nordec's maintenance
personnel and with the consent of its manager. It
further admits that it corresponded with Nordec
regarding the differential billing, and entertained
Nordec's demand for an explanation on the finding
of tampering and the recomputation of the amount to
be paid by Nordec. Clearly, Meralco knew that it was
dealing with Nordec as the beneficial user of the
electricity supply. (Mani/a Electric Co. v. Nordec

Q.

Respondents filed a complaint for nullification
of sale and damages against the Petitioner.
The Respondents alleged that they are the
grandchildren and successors-in-interest of
Udiaan and that an impostor sold Udiaan's land
to the Petitioner. The RTC rendered summary
judgment dismissing the complaint since the
Respondents being the grandchildren are not
the real-parties-in-interest as they have no
successional rights. On appeal, the CA upheld
the RTC's findings that the Respondents are not
real parties-in-interest but it also nullified the
deed of sale to Petitioner on the ground that
Udiaan's signature was forged.
a) Are the Respondent's real parties-in-interest?
b) Was it proper for the CA to render judgment
nullifying the deed of sale?

A.
a)

No the Respondents are not real parties-ininterest. As grandchildren, they have no
successional rights to the estate of Udiaan
unless by virtue of the right of representation.
Since the Respondents did not show that their
mother predeceased Udiaan, they have no
successional rights.

b) No. Having established that respondents are not
the real parties in interest to the instant suit, the
proper course of action was for the CA to merely
affirm the RTC's dismissal of their complaint. It
therefore erred in proceeding to resolve the other
substantive issues of the case and granting one
of the principal reliefs sought by respondents,

Q.

The Saludo Agpalo Fernandez and Aquino Law
Office (SAFA Law Office) entered into a lease
contract with the Philippine National Bank.
Subsequently SAFA Law Office vacated the
premises but there were disputes between it
and PNB as to the amount of rentals in arrears.
PNB subsequently sent a demand letter to
SAFA Law Office demanding payment of its
rental obligations in the amount of P25 million.
In 2006, Atty. Saludo, in his capacity as
managing partner of SAFA Law Office, filed a
complaint for accounting and/or recomputation
of unpaid rentals and damages against PNB in
relation to the lease contract. May Atty. Saludo
be ordered to amend his complaint to include
SAFA Law Office as plaintiff?

A.

Yes. The lease contract was entered into between
SAFA Law Office and PNB, hence SAFA Law
Office is the real party-in-interest. A juridical entitiy,
such as a partnership may bring a suit. 82 R3
requires that every action must be prosecuted or
defended in the name of the real party-in-interest.
As the one primarily affected by the outcome of the
suit, SAFA Law Office should have filed the
complaint with the RTC and should be made to
respond to any counterclaims that may be brought
in the course of the proceeding. ( Saluda v. PNB, 20
August 2018, Jardeleza, J.). 13

13
1t's unclear whether the complaint was in the name of Atty. Saluda alone
or in the name of Atty. Saluda as managing partner of SAFA Law Office. In the
latter case, Atty. Saluda is merely a representative party and the real party-ininterest would be SAFA Law Office. (S3 R3).

Q.

Distinguish between a real party in interest and
one having locus standi or legal standing.

A.

A real party in interest is the party who stands to be
benefited or injured by the judgment in the suit.
Unless otherwise authorized by the law or by the
Rules of Court, every action must be prosecuted or
defended in the name of the real party in interest.
(S2 R3).
A party with locus standi or legal standing is
one with a personal and substantial interest in a
case such that the party has sustained or will
sustain direct injury as a result of the governmental
act that is being challenged. The gist of the
question on standing is whether a party alleges
such personal stake in the outcome of the
controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness
which sharpens the presentation of issues as well
as to foster judicial self-restraint. ( Galicto v. Aquino,
28 February 2012, e.b., Brion, J.).
The question of whether one is a real party in
interest turns on the narrow question of whether or
not he will be benefited or injured by the judgment
in the suit while the question of locus standi
requires an analysis of broader policy concerns.
This is why the rule on locus standi may be relaxed
where the case is one of transcendental importance
or of paramount public interest. (Ki/osbayan, Inc. v.
Morato, 246 SCRA 540 [1995]).

Q.

What is the exception to the rule that every
action must be prosecuted or defended in the
name of the real party in interest?

A.

Representative parties under S3 R3. An action is
allowed to be prosecuted or defended by a

138
J9JC9B0M

RULE 3
Parties To Civil Actions

representative or someone acting in a fiduciary
capacity provided that the beneficiary shall be
included in the title of the case and shall be
deemed to be the real party in interest.
Q.

Give examples of representative parties. (GATE)

A.

1) Trustee of an express trust.
2) Guardian.
3) Executor or administrator. (See S2 R87).
4) Party authorized by law or the Rules of Court.

Q.

Give an example of a party authorized by law or
the Rules of Court to sue even if he is not the
real party in interest.

A.

In execution, the court may authorize the judgment
obligee to bring an action against a person alleged
to have property of the judgment obligor or to be
indebted to him, when such person claims an
adverse interest in the property or denies the debt.
(S43 R39; 1 FLORENZ D. REGALADO, REMEDIAL
LAW COMPENDIUM 466 [ih rev. ed., 3rd printing]).
In this case the judgment obligee must include in
the title the name of the judgment obligor who is
deemed to be the real party in interest.

Q. A complaint entitled "A as Attorney-in-Fact for

dismiss the complaint for lack of capacity to
sue. Decide the motion. Explain. (88 Bar Q4a).
A.

The motion to dismiss should be denied.
139

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

The ground of the motion to dismiss is
erroneous.
There is nothing in the problem to
indicate that A has no legal capacity to sue. The
ground that B may have been thinking of is failure
to state a cause of action on the argument that A as
attorney-in-fact is not the real party in interest.
However, even if the ground of the motion to
dismiss is failure to state a cause of action, the
motion would still be denied. Under S3 R3 a
representative may be a party; provided that the
beneficiary is included in the title of the case. In
such a case even if the suit is brought in the name
of the representative, the beneficiary is deemed to
be the real party in interest.
Here although the suit was brought in the name
of the agent, the beneficiary or principal X was
included in the title of the case. Hence X is deemed to
be the real party in interest and the objection that the
suit was not in the name of the real party in interest
14
will not lie.

(Note: The ruling in the case of Arroyo v.
Granada, 18 Phil. 484, is no longer good case
law because of S3 R3 of the 1997 Rules of
Civil Procedure).
Q.

Plaintiff brought an action for reconveyance
over a parcel of land. He brought the action not
against the registered owner Emmanuel but
against his mother Carmencita.Plaintiff'scontention
was that Carmencita was the attorney-in-fact of
Emmanuel. May the action be dismissed?

14
1tmay also be said that the suit is in effect brought in the name of X and
not A. This is because it is indicated that A is acting as the attorney-in-fact or
agent of X. It is axiomatic in the law of agency that an agent is the extension of
the principal's legal personality.

140

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 3
Parties To Civil Actions

A.

Yes. The action for reconveyance should have been
brought against the registered owner Emmanuel
and not his mother Carmencita. The Plaintiff
justified the filing of the action against Carmencita"
on the ground that she was the attorney-in-fact of
Emmanuel. Even assuming that Carmencita was
Em~_anuel's attorney-in-fact, the real party in
interest was still Emmanuel who should have been
impleaded in the complaint pursuant to S3 R3.
Hence the action failed to state a cause of action
and must be dismissed. (Guizano v. Veneracion, 12
September 2012).

Q.

A city mayor signed a contract in behalf of the
city without the prior authorization of the city
council as required by the Local Government
Code. Do the members of the city council have
standing to file a case for the nullification of the
contract?

A.

Yes. The real party in interest which may file a case,
questioning the validity of a contract entered into by
the city mayor, who is alleged to have no authority to
do so, is the city itself. It is the local government unit
which stands to be injured or benefited by any
judgment that may be made in this case. The city
councilors as representatives of the city have the
standing to file the case. (Lao v. Cagayan de Oro
City, 13 September 2017, Leanen, J.).

Q.

Give an exception to the rule requiring the joinder
of the beneficiary.

A.

An agent acting in his own name and for the benefit
of an undisclosed principal may sue or be sued
without joining the principal except when the

•'

141

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

contract involves things belonging to the principal.
(S3 R3).
The reason for this rule is that if an agent acts
in his own name, the principal has no right of action
against the persons with whom the agent has
contracted; neither have such persons against the
principal. In such case the agent is the one directly
bound in favor of the person with whom he
contracted, except when the contract involves things
belonging to the principal. (Art. 1883, Civil Code).

Star Travel & Tours Inc. The tickets that V-Gent
bought were in the name of the airplane
passengers and paid for with their money. VGent, in its own name, filed a suit against
Morning Star for the refund of unused airplane
tickets. Morning Star filed an answer raising the
affirmative defense of failure to state a cause of
action, arguing that V-Gent is not the real partyin-interest. V-Gent argued that it could sue as a
representative party pursuant to S3 R3. Should
the affirmative defense be granted?

A.

Yes. Under S3 R3, the representative must indicate
the name of the beneficiary (here the airplane
passengers) who are deemed to be the real partiesin-interest. This was not done by V-Gent since it
sued under its own name. Nor may V-Gent invoke
the last sentence of S3 R3 which provides that "[a]n
agent acting in his own name and for the benefit of
an undisclosed principal may sue ... without joining
the principal." Here V-Gent disclosed its principals;
in fact, the airplane tickets were in the name of the
airplane passengers. ( V-Gent, Inc. v. Morningstar

SEC. 4. Spouses as parties
Q.

What are the rules regarding spouses as parties
to a suit?

A.

S4 R3 states that husband and wife shall sue or be
sued jointly, except as provided by law. This
provision does not tell us much as it simply begs the
question of what the law provides.
If one spouse is suing as plaintiff, the other
spouse need not be joined even if the suit relates to
community or conjugal property. This is because
the spouses are joint administrators of the
community or conjugal property (Articles 96 and
124, Family Code) and the bringing of a suit is but
an act of administration.
If a spouse is being sued, the other spouse
should be joined if the suit could result in liability
being incurred by the absolute community or the
conjugal property. If the suit would only result in the
separate liability of a spouse, the other spouse
should not be joined. The liabilities of the absolute
community and the conjugal partnership are found
in Articles 94 and 121 of the Family Code.

Q.

Husband and wife lent money to defendants
spouses A and B. A and B did not pay the loan.
Husband alone filed a suit to collect the loan
against A and B. A and B filed a motion to
dismiss on the ground that the wife was not
impleaded as a co-plaintiff in violation of S4 R3.
Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

A.

No. In an action to recover a sum of money, the
failure to join the other spouse is not a jurisdictional
defect. The non-joinder of a spouse does not
143

warrant dismissal as it is merely a formal
requirement which may be cured by amendment.
(Carandang v. Heirs of de Guzman, G.R. No.

Q.

D (wife) and E (husband) were married in 1990. E
works as an employee in a private company
abroad. In 1995, D (without E's knowledge)
borrowed money from C to put up a drugstore
the income of which was intended to defray the
household expenses. The drugstore however
incurred only losses and eventually went under.
C sues D and E to recover the debt. Should the
absolute community be liable for D's debt?

A.

No. Under Art. 94(3) of the Family Code, debts
contracted by either spouse without the consent of
the other shall only be a liability of the absolute
community to the extent that the family may have
been benefited. Actual benefit to the family must
thus be proved. Here since the drugstore incurred
only losses, no benefit was acquired by the
absolute community. It does not matter that the
income of the drugstore was intended to benefit the
family. What matters is actual benefit.

Q.

Would your answer be the same if D was the
designated administrator-spouse?

A.

No. In that case, the absolute community would be
liable. The fact that the debt was contracted for the
benefit of the community (even if no actual benefit
resulted) would suffice to hold liable the absolute
community. (Art. 94(2), Family Code).

Q.

The Philippine Blooming Corporation obtained
a P50-million loan from Ayala Investment. As
security for the loan, the Executive Vice-

144

RULE 3
Parties To Civil Actions

President of PBM, Alfredo Ching, executed a
suretyship agreement binding himself solidarily
in favor of Ayala Investment. Alfredo Ching was
the designated administrator-spouse of the
absolute community. PBM defaulted on the loan
so Ayala Investment sued PBM and Ching. A
final and executory judgment was rendered in
favor of Ayala Investment and it sought to levy
on the conjugal properties of the Spouses
Ching. May the sheriff levy on the absolute
community properties?
A.

No, the sheriff may not levy on the absolute
community properties.
Under Article 94(2) of the Family Code, the
absolute community of property shall be liable for
debts contracted during the marriage by the
designated administrator-spouse for the benefit of
the community.
Here when the husband entered into a
suretyship agreement to secure the debt of a third
person, he does not thereby contract a debt or
obligation for the benefit of the community since the
one benefited by the loan was PBM not the
absolute community. Hence the absolute community
of the Spouses Ching is not liable for the debt of
Ching and the sheriff may not levy upon the
community properties. ( See Ayala Investment &
Dev't Corp. v. CA, 286 SCRA 272).

Q.

Would your answer be the same if it was proved
by Ayala Investment that because of the grant
of the loan, the employment of Ching in PBM
would be prolonged, that the shares in PBM of
the Ching family would rise in value, and that
145

Mr. Ching's prestige in PBM and his career
therein would be enhanced?

Yes. The benefits contemplated under Article 94(2)
of the Family Code must be one directly resulting
from the loan, not a mere by-product or spin-off of
the loan itself. (Id.).

Indispensable and Necessary Parties (S7 & 8 R3)

RULE 3
Parties To Civil Actions

2) AS TO EFFECT OF NOT IMPLEADING
DESPITE COURT ORDER. If an indispensable
party is not impleaded by the plaintiff despite a court
order, the court may dismiss the case for failure to
prosecute. (S3 R17). On the other hand, the failure
by the plaintiff to implead a necessary party despite
court order, will not result in the dismissal of the
case but simply the waiver of the plaintiff's claim
against such necessary party. (S9 R3).
Q.

What is the rule regardingan indispensableparty?

A.

He shall be joined either as plaintiff or as defendant.
(S7 R3).

Q.

Who has the burden to implead or order the
impleading of an indispensable party?

A.

The burden to implead or to order the impleading of
an indispensable party rests on the plaintiff and the
trial court, respectively. (Arcelona v. Court of
Appeals, 345 Phil. 250, 275 [1997]).

Q.

What is the result if an indispensable party is
not impleaded in a suit?

A.

The court cannot proceed without their presence.
However, the Supreme Court has characterized
the failure to implead an indispensable party as a
curable error. Hence the court instead of dismissing
the case should order the plaintiff to amend his
complaint by impleading the indispensable party or
allowing the intervention of the indispensable party.
These measures may be taken even after rendition
of judgment. (Pacana-Contreras v. Ravi/a Water
Supply, Inc., G.R. No. 1689792, 2 December
2013). Amendment or intervention, however, is no

null and void. (Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company

Q.

In a declaratory relief proceeding, what is the
effect of the failure to include as defendant a
party who would be adversely affected by the
declaratory judgment of the court?

A. The non-joinder of persons who claim any interest
which may be affected by a declaratory judgment is
not a jurisdictional defect as S2 R63 provides that
said declaration shall not prejudice their interests.
Since the judgment in a declaratory relief case is
merely declaratory and not executory, the rule
on compulsory joinder of indispensable parties
does not apply.
Q.

What is the test for determining whether a party
is an indispensable party or not?

A.

If the party's interest would be directly affected or
necessarily prejudiced by the judgment which
would be rendered in the case, then he is an
indispensable party ( See China Banking Corp. v.
Oliver, 390 SCRA 263, 370-371 ). Indispensable
parties are those who have such interest in the
controversy that a final adjudication of the case
would certainly affect their rights. (Freedom from
Debt Coalition v. MWSS, G.R. No. 173044, 10
December 2007). The rule requiring joinder of an
indispensable party is thus based on the
Constitutional right to due process.

Appeals, G.R. No. 109910, 5 April 1995).

2)

In an action for recovery of land against

3)

In an action for rescission filed by a creditor to

In an action for annulment of title over a lot, the
registered owner of the lot is an indispensable

granted by the latter to concessionaires
Maynilad Water and Manila Water, the
concessionaires are indispensable parties.

Q.

D obtained a car loan from a car dealer
evidenced by a promissory note and secured by
a chattel mortgage over the car executed by D
in favor of the car dealer. The note and the
chattel mortgage were assigned by the car
dealer to BA Finance.
D defaulted in the
payment of the loan. BA Finance learned later
on that the car was in the possession of F. BA
Finance filed an action for replevin against F to
recover the car. D was not impleaded. Is D an
indispensable party?

A.

Yes. In an action for replevin filed by the mortgagee
to recover the mortgaged chattel in the possession
of a third person, the mortgagor is an indispensable
party even if the chattel is in the possession of a
third person.
In a chattel mortgage, since the mortgagee's
right to possession is conditioned upon the fact of
default, the inclusion of the debtor or the mortgagor
is necessary for a full and conclusive determination
of the case.

Inc. v. Courl of Appeals, G.R. No. 103301, 8

Q. In the preceding problem, assume that BA
Finance filed the replevin action against D without
impleading F. Is Fan indispensable party?

A

Yes. The judgment in the replevin case would directly
affect the rights of F. An adverse possessor, who is
not the mortgagor, cannot just be deprived of his
possession, let alone be bound by the terms of the
chattel mortgage, simply because the mortgagee
brings an action for replevin. (BA Finance Corporation
v. Court of Appeals, G. R. No. 102998, 5 July 1996).

Q.

Eduardo Santiago filed with the RTC an action
for reconveyance of lot against the GSIS. He
died pendente lite and was substituted by his
widow Rosario. A judgment was rendered
granting the action for reconveyance and a writ
of execution was issued as the judgment had
become final and executory.
In the RTC Vilar filed a motion for
substitution claiming that Eduardo had assigned
all his rights to him. The RTC issued an order
merely noting Vilar's motion without any action.
Vilar thus filed a R65 petition with the CA to set
aside the RTC's order which merely noted his
motion. Vilar did not implead Rosario in his R65
petition. The CA granted the petition and
ordered the impleading of Vilar in substitution of
Rosario. The GSIS's motion for reconsideration
and Rosario's motion to intervene and admit
motion for reconsideration was denied. May the
CA's decision be set aside?

A

Yes. Verily, Rosario is an indispensable party in the
petition before the CA as she is the widow of the
original party-plaintiff Eduardo. The determination
151

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

of the propriety of the action of the trial court in
merely noting and not granting Vilar's motion would
necessarily affect her interest in the subject matter
of litigation as the party-plaintiff.
The final determination of the case would pry
into the right of Rosario as party-plaintiff before the
lower court who is entitled to the proceeds of the
judgment award. In ruling for Vilar's substitution, the
right of Rosario as to the proceeds of the judgment
award was thwarted as the CA effectively ordered
that the proceeds pertaining to Rosario be awarded
instead to Vilar. Hence, failure to implead Rosario as
an indispensable party rendered all the proceedings
before the CA null and void for want of authority to
act. (Santiago v. Vilar, 6 March 2018, Tijam, J.).
Q.

Pua filed a complaint for collection of money
against Ang and her mother Deyto, the coowners of JD Grains Center. Summons was
duly served upon Deyto but not upon Ang who
had absconded. May the case proceed without
summons being served upon Ang?

A

No. Until the summons has been served on Ang,
the case cannot proceed since Ang is an
indispensable party to the case; Pua alleged in his
complaint that the respondents are co-owners of JD
Grains Center. A court must acquire jurisdiction
over the person of indispensable parties before it
can validly pronounce judgments personal to the
parties. The absence of an indispensable party
renders all subsequent actions of the court null and
void for want of authority to act, not only as to the
absent parties but even as to those present.
Summons by publication must be effected against
Ang. (Pua v. Deyto, 26 November 2012, Brion, J.).

Q.

Landowner filed an action for reconveyance of
land against the developer Spring Homes,
which had transferred by way of an absolute
deed of sale the land to the spouses Lumbres.
Summons was duly served on the spouses
Lumbres but not on Spring Homes. The trial
court dismissed the action on the ground that
summons was not served on Spring Homes,
which is an indispensable party. Did the trial
court correctly dismiss the case?

A.

No. In action for recovery of possession of land
against Spring Homes (transferor) & Sps. Lumbres
(transferee), the transferor is not an indispensable
party. The reason is that having transferred all its
interest in the land to the spouses Lumbres, Spring
Homes did not stand to be directly affected or
necessarily prejudiced by the judgment that may be
rendered in the case. (Spring Homes v. Tablada,
23 Jan 2017, Peralta, J.)

Q.

0 sold a parcel of land to B. Subsequently 0
sold and delivered the same parcel of land to C,
who filed with the RTC an application for original
registration of the land. The application was
granted and an original certificate of title (OCT)
was issued in the name of C. B filed an action
for reconveyance against C. Judgment was
rendered in favor of B. On appeal, C argued that
B should have impleaded the seller O who is an
indispensable party. Is C's argument correct?

A.

No, C's argument is not correct. The property
owners against whom the action for reconveyance
is filed are indispensable parties. No relief can be
had, and the court cannot render a valid judgment,
without them. However, the seller of the property is
153

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

not an indispensable party. The reason is that when
the seller has sold and delivered the property to the
buyer, he has lost any right or interest over the
property. (Aboitiz v. Po, 5 June 2017, Leanen, J.).
Q. Plaintiff filed an action with the RTC for
cancellation of title of Pedro Santos. The
certificate of title is registered in the name of
"Pedro Santos, married to Susan Santos."
Summons was served by publication since
Pedro Santos was a non-resident. The court
ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The son of Susan
Santos contends that the judgment is null and
void because an indispensable party, Susan
Santos, was not impleaded in the action for
cancellation. Is the son correct?

A.

No. In an action for cancellation of title filed against
the registered owner, his wife is not an
indispensable party if land is registered as
"Husband, married to Wife." In the absence of any
showing that the land was acquired during the
marriage, the presumption is that the land is the
exclusive property of the husband. (See Onstott v.
Upper-Tagpos Neighborhood Assoc., 14 Sep 2016,

Q.

Medical students of St. Luke's College of
Medicine perished in a fire in a community
clinic wherein they were undergoing medical
clerkship. The parents sued St. Luke's for
damages after a showing that the fire was
caused by faulty wiring in the community clinic.
The RTC dismissed the complaint on the
ground that the Municipality of Cabiao, which
owned the community clinic and had a
memorandum of intent with St. Luke's for the
154

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 3
Parties To Civil Actions

construction and operation of the community
clinic, was not impleaded. The RTC held that the
municipality was an indispensable party without
whom no final determination can be had of the
action. Was the dismissal correct?
A.

No. The municipality is not an indispensable party.
Under S? R3, in order to be an indispensable party,
the party should be one without whom no final
determination can be had of an action. Here the
parents premise St. Luke's liability on its contractual
obligation to their students and, certainly, complete
relief and a final judgment can be arrived at by
weighing the claims and defenses of the parents
and St. Luke's, without need of evaluating the
claims and defenses of the Municipality of Cabiao.
If at all, the Municipality of Cabiao is a necessary
party whose non-inclusion in the case at bar shall
not prevent the court from proceeding with the
action. (St. Luke's College of Medicine v. Perez, 28
Sep 2016, Perez, J.)

Q.

Haus Talk Inc. (HTI) as seller, entered into a
contract to sell (CTS) over a realty in favor of
respondents spouses. HTI later assigned its
rights under the CTS to Phil. Veterans Banlc
(PVB). Under the deed of assignment, the
assignee acquired all the rights of the assignor
except for legal title over the properties which
was retained by HTI. PVB served a notarial
cancellation of the CTS upon the respondents
for their failure to pay the consideration under
the CTS. PVB then filed an action for unlawful
detainer against the respondents. The MTC ruled
in favor of PVB and the judgment was affirmed
on appeal by the RTC. However the CA on
appeal set aside the decision and remanded the
155

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

case to the MTC for HTI to be impleaded. The CA
held that HTI is an indispensable party since it
had retained legal title pursuant to the deed of
assignment. Is HTI an indispensable party?

A.

No. That HTI retained ownership over the subject
property pursuant to the Deed of Assignment did
not mean that it is an indispensable party to the
case. An indispensable party is one who has an
interest in the subject matter of the controversy
which is inseparable from the interest of the other
parties, and that a final adjudication cannot be
made without affecting such interest.
Here, the only issue in the instant unlawful
detainer suit is who between the litigating parties
has the better right to possess de facto the subject
property. Thus, HTl's interest in the subject
property, as one holding legal title thereto, is
completely separable from PVB's rights under the
CTS, which include the cancellation or rescission of
such contract and resultantly, the recovery of actual
possession of the subject property. Hence, the
courts can proceed to determine who between PVB
and the respondents have a better right to the
possession of the subject property and complete
relief can be had even without HTl's participation.
(Phil. Veterans Bank v. Sabado, 30 August 2017,
Perlas-Bernabe, J. ).

Q.

In an action for cancellation of a transfer
certificate of title, is the register of deeds an
indispensable party?

A.

No. The RD is merely a nominal party who does not
need to participate in the proceedings to adjudicate
the rights of the plaintiff and defendant. The failure
156

J9JC9B0M

RULE3
Parties To Civil Actions

to implead the RD is not fatal to the case. (De Leon
v. Chu, 2 September 2015).
Q.

Give examples of necessary parties.

A.

1)

A joint obliger in a joint obligation.

2) A transferee pendente lite. (S19 R3). The failure
to implead or include the transferee pendente
lite would not affect the validity of the judgment.
3) In an action to foreclose a real estate mortgage,
the junior mortgagees or lienholders are
necessary parties.
4) In a case of a co-owned property and one of the
co-owners files an ejectment suit, the other coowners are necessary parties insofar as the
filing of the complaint is concerned. Thus there
is no need for the other co-owners to join the
plaintiff. (1 MANUEL V. MORAN, COMMENTS

Q.

A and B brought an action to annul a deed of sale
over a piece of land and to recover the land from
D, in whose favor the deed was executed by X,
father of A and B, already deceased, on the
ground that the deed of sale was forged. In his
answer, D denied that the signature of X was
forged. Finding that the signature of X was
forged, the court ordered the deed of sale
annulled, and the land returned to A and B. On
appeal, D raised the question that the decision is

15
A rule of thumb to determine whether a person is a necessary party is to
ask the question: would not impleading the person in the case leave open the
possibility of future litigation arising out of the transaction or occurrence subject
of the case? If the answer is yes, that person is a necessary party. Thus leaving
out a joint debtor from a suit would leave open the possibility that the plaintiff
would in the future sue the joint debtor for his share of the debt.

157

null and void because the land in question is
owned in common, by succession, by A and 8
and Y and Z as their brothers, who however did
not join in the action as plaintiffs; hence, the
action was not brought by all the parties
in interest and there was non-joinder of
indispensable parties, for which reason the action
should have been dismissed. May the contention
of D be sustained? Reasons. (79 Bar Q1).
A.

No, the contention of D may not be sustained. In an
action to recover co-owned property, one co-owner
alone may bring the action pursuant to Article 487 of
the Civil Code which provides that any one of the
co-owners may bring an action for ejectment. The
Supreme Court has held that Article 487 applies as
well to an accion publiciana and to an accion
reivindicatoria. One co-owner may suffice to file the
suit since it is presumed to have been filed for the
benefit of all the co-owners. ~2 EDGARDO PARAS,
1
CIVIL CODE ANNO. 269 [11 ed., 1984]). Y and Z
are merely necessary parties and thus the judgment
of the court is valid. (Moran, supra). Moreover
nonjoinder of party is not a ground for dismissal.

J9JC9B0M

RULE 3

A.

No. In an action to recover co-owned property, one
co-owner alone may bring the action pursuant to
Article 487 of the Civil Code which provides that any
one of the co-owners may bring an action for
ejectment. The Supreme Court stated that Article 487
applies to actions to recover personal property. One
co-owner may suffice to file the suit since it is
presumed to have been filed for the benefit of all the
co-owners. (Carandang v. Heirs of de Guzman, G.R.
No. 160347, 29 November 2006). Milagros is merely
a necessary party. (Moran, supra). Moreover
nonjoinder of party is not a ground for dismissal.

Q.

D, E, and F are solidarily indebted to P for
P9,000,000. P files a collection case against D
only. Are E and F indispensable parties?

A.

No. In a solidary obligation, a creditor may sue all,
several, or just one of the solidary debtors. ( Cerezo
v. Tuazon, G.R. 141538, 23 Mar 2004).

Q.

In an action to foreclose a real estate mortgage,
is the junior mortgagee an indispensable party?

A.

No, he is merely a necessary party. The mortgage
may be foreclosed without impleading him and
without prejudice to his equity of redemption.

Q.

Is a solidary co-debtor a necessary party?

A.

No, because complete relief is available as to one
co-debtor. (Cerezo v. Tuazon, G.R. 141538, 23
March 2004 ).

Q.

Is a joint debtor a necessary party?

A.

Yes. A creditor may sue one joint debtor for his

complete relief to him. (1 Moran 189).

Q.

D, E, and F are jointly indebted to C in the
amount of P9,000,000. C files a collection suit
against D for the amount of P3,000,000. The
complaint alleges that D, E, and F are jointly
indebted to C but that C is only suing D in order
to avoid additional factual issues which would
just prolong the trial. D files a motion to dismiss
on the ground that C did not implead E and F.
a) Should the motion to dismiss be granted?
Assume that the motion to dismiss was not
granted. The court however ordered C to
implead E and F.
b) Is the order of the court proper?
c) Assume that C did not comply with the court
order, May the court dismiss the case?
Assume that the court continued trying the
case despite C's non-compliance with its order.
The court rendered judgment in favor of C as
against D for P3,000,000. The judgment became
final. Subsequently C filed a case against E for
collection of P3,000,000.
d) If you were E's counsel, what would you do?

A.
a)

No, the motion to dismiss should not be granted.
A joint debtor is not an indispensable party but
only a necessary party. Besides non-inclusion
of a party is not a ground for dismissal of an
action. (S11 R3).

b) Yes. Under S9 R3, if the court finds the reason
for the omission of a necessaryparty unmeritorious,

160
J9JC9B0M

RULE3
Parties To Civil Actions

it may order the inclusion of the omitted
necessary party if jurisdiction over his person
may be obtained.
c) No, the court may not order the dismissal of the
case. Under S9 R3, it is not provided that the
failure to comply with the court's order without
justifiable cause shall be a ground for
dismissal; rather the pleader is deemed to have
waived his claim against the necessary parties
not included.

I would file an answer raising the affirmative
defense that C's claim has been waived.

Q.

A passenger bus collided with a tricycle
resulting in damage to the tricycle and injuries
to its driver. The Plaintiff tricycle driver filed a
case for damages against the bus owner alone
but did not implead the bus driver as defendant.
Judgment was rendered in favor of the Plaintiff.
The defendant bus owner argues that the
judgment was void for failure to implead the
bus driver as an indispensable party. Is the
judgment void?

A.

No, the judgment is not void.
The Supreme Court has held in a similar case
that the liability of the bus owner and the driver is
solidary since they are joint tort-feasors. The
creditor may proceed against all or just one of the
solidary debtors. Where the obligation of the parties
is solidary, neither of the parties is indispensable
and the other is not even a necessary party
because complete relief is available from either.

Filmarco mortgaged its heavy equipment to the
DBP. DBP assigned the mortgage to APT.
Subsequently P filed a suit against Filmarco for
recovery of a parcel of land in which the
mortgaged equipment was located. A final and
executory judgment was rendered in favor of P.
The APT then filed an action to annul the
judgment. It argued that it was an indispensable
party and should have been impleaded in the
suit filed by P against Filmarco. Should the
judgment be annulled?

A.

No. The mere fact that the recovery of the land
would necessarily entail the removal of the
equipment mortgaged to APT does not make the
latter an indispensable party. APT's rights can
easily be resolved in a separate action it can file
against Filmarco. (Republic v. Heirs of Magdato,
340 SCRA 115 [2000]).

Q.

P filed an action with the RTC to nullify the TCT
of A. There was an existing registered mortgage
over the TCT in favor of Metrobank. The bank
was however not impleaded in the cancellation
suit. The court rendered judgment cancelling
the TCT. The judgment became final and
executory. Can the bank file an action to annul
the judgment of the RTC? If so in what court
should the bank file the action?

A. Yes. In a suit to nullify an existing TCT with an
annotated REM, the mortgagee is an indispensable
party, since the mortgagee's rights over the
property would no longer be known and respected
by third parties. The non-joinder of the mortgagee
deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to pass upon
162

RULE 3
Parties To Civil Actions

the controversy. (Metropolitan Bank &

Oliver. Oliver 2 did not implead Oliver 1.
Chinabank filed a motion to dismiss on the
ground of non-joinder of an indispensable
party. The trial court denied the motion to
dismiss. Instead of filing an answer, Chinabank
filed a special civil action with the CA to set
aside the Judge's order denying its motion to
dismiss. Meanwhile for failure of Chinabank to
answer within the reglementary period it was
declared in default by the trial court and Oliver 2
allowed to present evidence ex parte.
a)

Did the trial court properly deny Chinabank's
motion to dismiss?

b) Did the trial court properly declare Chinabank
in default?
A.
a) Yes. The SC held that Oliver 1 is not an
indispensable party as the case can proceed tojudgment so long as Oliver 2 can prove that
she's the real Oliver. Further, a declaration of
the mortgage's nullity will not necessarily
prejudice Oliver 1 as the bank still needs to

initiate proceedings to go after the mortgagor,
who in turn can raise other defenses pertinent
to the two of them. Hence it is not S7 R3
requiring compulsory joinder of parties which
applies but S11 R3, which provides that nonjoinder of parties is not a ground for dismissal.
b) Yes. The filing of a petition for certiorari under
Rule 65 does not suspend the running of the
period within which a defendant should answer
the complaint unless a temporary restraining
order or preliminary injunction was issued.
(China Bank v. Oliver, 390 SCRA 263 [2002]).

a)

In an action to annul an OCT issued in the
name of the registered owners, are the heirs

A.
a) Yes. The cancellation of the OCT would certainly
strip them of their rights over the property.

b) If the dismissal of the petition for relief was

is their employer but they did not implead 7J. CA
ruled that Lotte was the employer not 7J and held
Lotte solidarily liable with 7J. May the CA's
decision be set aside?

A.

Yes. 7J the service contractor is an indispensable
party. It is a party in interest because it will be
affected by the outcome of the case. The CA did
not acquire jurisdiction over 7J. No final ruling can
be had without impleading 7J. (Lotte Phil. Co., Inc.

Q.

Who is an unwilling co-plaintiff?

A.

An unwilling co-plaintiff is any party who should be
joined as plaintiff but whose consent to such joinder
cannot be obtained.

Q.

What is the remedy if there is an unwilling coplaintiff?

A.

He may be made a defendant. The reason for making
him a defendant shall be stated in the complaint.

Q.

Give examples of an unwilling co-plaintiff.

A.

B and C are co-owners of a parcel of land the
possession of which has been seized by X. B wants
to file an action to recover possession against X but
C does not want to join B as he does not want to
bother with the expenses of litigation. B may file an
action for recovery of possession against X and
implead C as defendant for the purpose of
recovering from him his share of the costs of
litigation. (J. ROBERT HARRIS & ELLEN MACKLIN,
THE INVOLUNTARY PLAINTIFF: HANDLING THE
PROBLEM OF THE UNWILLING PLAINTIFF, 17
South Texas Law Journal 399). The reason for
making C a defendant, that is, his unwillingness to
join B and in order to make him share in the costs
of litigation, should be indicated in the complaint.
Where an executor or administrator is unwilling
or refuses to bring a suit for the recovery of the
property or rights of the deceased, the heirs may
bring the suit and implead the executor or
administrator as a co-defendant. (Borromeo v.

Q.

Whose option is it to implead the unwilling coplaintiff?

A.

The original plaintiff. He cannot be compelled on
the mere representation of the defendant to
implead anyone. (Emata v. /AC, G.R. No. L-72714,

SEC. 12. Class suit
Q.

What is a class suit?

A.

A class suit is a suit brought by or defended by a
representative member or members of a large
group of persons on behalf of all the members
of the group.

Q.

What are the requisites of a class suit?

A.

The requisites of a class suit are:
1) The subject matter of the controversy is one
of common or general interest to the members
of a group.
2) The persons who are members of the group are
so numerous that it is impracticable to join all
as parties.

Q.

What shall the court do if it finds that the
requisites of a class suit have been met?

A.

The court shall appoint a number of the group which
it finds sufficiently numerous and representative as
to fully protect the interests of all concerned to sue
or defend for the benefit of the group.

168

RULE 3

Q.

May a group member who was not appointed as
a representative intervene in the class suit?

A. Yes. Any party in interest shall have the right to
intervene to protect his individual interest. (812 R3).
Q.

Newsweek magazine published an article titled,
"An island of fear," which wrote of alleged abuses
committed by sugarcane plantation owners
against their workers. The sugarcane planters filed
a class suit for libel and damages against
Newsweek. Was the filing of a class suit proper?

A.

No. Each sugarcane planter has a separate and
distinct reputation in the community; hence the
subject matter of the controversy is not of common
or general interest. Otherwise put the interest must
be in the "subject matter of the controversy" and not
merely in the legal question involved. (Newsweek,
Inc. v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 142 SCRA
170 [1986]).

Q.

Various persons claiming to be landowners
filed a class suit against Araneta Incorporated
claiming that Araneta had illegally deprived
them of possession of their lands. Was the
filing of a class suit proper?

A. No. Each landowner has a separate and distinct kind
of interest, i.e., the size of the land, how title
acquired, etc. Hence there is no common or general
interest in the subject matter of the controversy.

behalf of the relatives of all those who perished
in the mishap a class suit for damages totaling
P5 Million against the airline. The propriety of
the class suit is questioned by the defendant.

A.

The class suit is not proper.
Under S12 R3, a class suit is proper when the
subject matter of the controversy is of common or
general interest.
Here the subject matter is not of common or
general interest since each plaintiff has a separate
and distinct claim for damages. Othewise put there
must be identity of relief/s sought.

The class suit is not proper.

subject matter of the controversy is of common or
general interest.
Here the subject matter is not of common or
general interest since each plaintiff has a separate

RULE3
Parties To Civil Actions

January 1988, a class suit seeking damages of
P200,000 to P400,000 per victim or a total of
P1.6 billion was filed with the RTC against the
owners of the ships involved by 27 named
plaintiffs in behalf of the class of approximately
4,000 heirs of the passengers who perished.
Was the filing of a class suit proper?
A.

No. One of the requirements of a class suit is that
"[t]he subject matter of the controversy is one of
common or general interest to the members of a
group." This means that there is only one right or
cause of action pertaining to or belonging in
common to many persons, not separately or
severally to distinct individuals. The object of the
suit is to obtain relief for or against numerous
persons as a group or as an integral entity, and not
as separate, distinct individuals whose rights or
liabilities are separate from and independent of
those affecting the others.
On the other hand, if there are many persons
who have distinct, separate rights against the same
party or group of parties, but those rights arise from
the same transaction or series of transactions and
there are common questions of fact or law resulting
therefrom, the former may join as plaintiffs in one
action against the same defendant. This is
authorized by the joinder-of-parties rule in S6 R3.
Hence a class suit is improper is each member
of the group has a separate determinable interest
distinct from that of the others. The relevant rule is
S6 R3. (Re request of the Heirs of the Passengers
of Dona Paz to set aside the Order of Judge B.V.

Q.

If a class suit is not proper, what is the recourse
of the defendant?

A.

The defendant can file an answer raising the
affirmative defensethat the plaintiff has no legal
capacity to sue. The reason is that a class suit not
being proper, the plaintiff or plaintiffs has or have
no right to sue for the benefit of the class. (S16[d]

Q.

Leon, in Manila, sold a quantity of rice for
PS00,000 to Luis in Baguio, and shipped the rice
through Rita Transportation. Luis refused to pay
Leon, claiming that the rice was never delivered
to him. Rita Transportation, on the other hand,
claimed that it had delivered the rice to Luis.
Whom should Leon sue? (80 Bar Q1)

A.

Leon should sue both Luis and Rita Transportation.
Under S13 R3, where the plaintiff is uncertain
against who of several persons he is entitled to
relief, he may join any or all of them as defendants
in the alternative, although a right to relief against
one may be inconsistent with a right to relief
against the other.
Here Leon is uncertain as to who between Luis
and Rita Transportation is liable to him. Hence he
can sue both as alternative defendants.

Q.

May a defendant whose
unknown be sued?

A.

Yes. Whenever the identity or name of a defendant
is unknown, he may be sued as the unknown
owner, heir, devisee, or by such other designation
as the case may require. However when his identity
172

name or identity is

or true name is discovered, the pleading must be
amended accordingly. (S14 R3).
Q.

May an entity without juridical personality sue
as a plaintiff?

A.

No. Under S1 R3 only natural or juridical persons
or entities authorized by law may be parties in a
civil action.

Q.

May an entity without juridical personality be
sued as a defendant?

A. Yes when it has entered into a transaction with the
plaintiff.
Q.

In the complaint is it necessary to state the
names of the persons composing the entity?

A.

No. They may be sued under the name by which
they are generally or commonly known. However in
the answer of such defendant, the names and
addresses of the persons composing said entity
must all be revealed.

SEC. 16. Death of party; duty of counsel
Q.

What is the duty of a party's counsel, in case of
the death of the party?

A.

If a party to a pending action dies and the claim is
not thereby extinguished, it shall be the duty of his
counsel: (1) to inform the court within 30 days after
such death of the fact thereof, and (2) to give the
name and address of his legal representative or
representatives. Failure of counsel to comply with
this duty shall be a ground for disciplinary action.

173

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

When would the death of the party in a pending
action extinguish the claim?

A.

The general rule is that a person's rights and
obligations are transmissible upon his death to his
heirs. However, where the rights and obligations of
a party are intransmissible by law or by stipulation or
are purely personal, the party's death would result in
the extinguishment of the claim. Examples are the
right to hold public office, the right to exercise a
profession or vocation, rights and obligations arising
from agency, and the right of a usufructuary.
The question as to whether an action survives
or not depends on the nature of the action and the
damage sued for. In the causes of action which
survive, the wrong complained [of] affects primarily
and principally property and property rights, the
injuries to the person being merely incidental, while
in the causes of action which do not survive,
the injury complained of is to the person, the
property and rights of property affected being
incidental. (Bonilla v. Barcena, 71 SCRA 491,
495-496 [1976]).

Q.

Pacific Rehaus Corporation (PRC) entered into
a contract to sell over a parcel of land with
Bautista for a consideration of P?,300,000.
However despite receipt of P6,600,000 and
repeated offers to pay the balance in full, Bautista
refused to execute the deed of absolute sale in
favor of PRC; thus PRC filed with the RTC an
action for specific performance against Bautista
to compel the latter to execute the deed of
absolute sale in favor of PRC and to deliver the
certificate of title to it. Prior to the pre-trial,
Bautista died. His counsel informed the court of
174

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 3
Parties To Civil Actions

Bautista's death but could not give the names
of Bautista's heirs and their addresses for lack
of personal knowledge. Thus the RTC ordered
PRC to procure the appointment of an executor
or administrator for the estate of Bautista
pursuant to 516 R3.
On a special civil action for certiorari to the
Court of Appeals, the CA ordered the dismissal
of the action for specific performance. The CA
held that the complaint for specific performance
was an action in personam since its object was
to compel Bautista to perform his obligations
under the contract to sell and hence, rendered
him pecuniarily liable. As such, the obligations
in the contract attached to him alone and did
not burden the subject property. Since the
action was founded on a personal obligation, it
did not survive Bautista's death. Hence, the CA
concluded that the dismissal of the complaint
by reason thereof, and not a resort to 516 R3
was the proper course of action. Was the
dismissal the proper course of action?
A.

No. S 16 R3 allows the substitution of a party-litigant
who dies during the pendency of a case by his
heirs, provided that the claim subject of said case is
not extinguished by his death. If the claim in an
action affects property and property rights, then the
action survives the death of a party-litigant.
Here, although the CA correctly pointed out
that PRC's action is one for specific performance, a
closer perusal of PRC's complaint reveals that it
actually prays for the delivery of ownership of the
subject land through Bautista's execution of a deed
of sale and the turnover of the certificate of title in
175

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

its favor. This shows that the primary objective and
nature of the complaint is to recover the subject
property itself and thus, is deemed to be a real
action, which affects property and property rights
over the subject land. Therefore, the death of a
party-litigant, i.e., Bautista, did not render the case
dismissible on such ground, but rather, calls for the
proper application of S16 R3 on substitution of
party-litigants. (Pacific Rehouse Corp. v. Ngo, 12
April 2016, Perlas~Bernabe, J.). 16
Q.

Pedro filed an action against Dencio, who he
alleges to be his father, to claim the status of
the legitimate child. During the pendency of the
case, Pedro died. May the heirs of Pedro be

A. Yes. Under Article 173 of the Family Code, the
action to claim legitimacy already commenced by
the child shall survive notwithstanding the death of
either or both of the parties. This action is among
those that survive under the Revised Rules of
Court. ALICIA V. SEMPIO-DIY, HANDBOOK ON
THE FAMILY CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES 279
(1995 ed., 1999 reprint).
Q.

Does the duty under 516 R3 apply to death of a
party in cases pending appeal?

A. Yes. (Riviera Filipinas v. CA, G.R. 117355, 5 Apr 02).
Q.

What is the purpose of notifying or informing
the court of the death of a party?

11
'VVhat is actually material is whether the action was purely personal or
not. Since the action involved property rights, it is one which survives, regardless
of whether it was one for specific performance or a real action. The error of the
CA was to confound the concept of action in personam with action which is
purely personal.

So that the court may forthwith order the named
legal representative(s) to appear and be substituted
for the deceased party within a period of 30 days

Q.

Who is the legal representative of the deceased
party?

A.

The executor or administrator appointed by the
probate court, or if none, the heirs of the deceased.
(JOSE Y. FERIA, 1997 RULES OF CIVIL
PROCEDURE 13 [1997], citing Lawas v. Court of
Appeals, 146 SCRA 173)

Q.

What if there is no executor or administrator
appointed by the probate court?

A.

The court has two options:
One. The court may simply allow the heirs of
the deceased to be substituted for the deceased,
without requiring the appointment of an executor or
administrator, and the court may appoint a guardian
ad /item for the minor heirs.
Two. The court may order the opposing party,
within a specified time, to procure the appointment
of an executor 17 or administrator for the estate of
the deceased and the latter shall immediately
appear for and in behalf of the deceased asprovided for in the fourth paragraph of S16 R3.
It is submitted that the second option is only
available where there are pending probate proceedings
as it is the probate court which will issue the letters

17
There is a defect in the phraseology of S16 R3 when it speaks of
"appointment of an executor." An executor is not appointed but is named by the
testator in his will. The more precise terminology would be "issuance of letters
testatmentary or of administration."

177

testamentary or letters of administration. Where
there are no pending probate proceedings, the
court should simply allow the heirs to be substituted
for the deceased. To order the opposing party
to initiate probate proceedings would be unduly
burdensome upon him and would result in
unnecessary delay.
Q.

What if no legal representative is named by
the counsel for the deceased party, or if the one
so named shall fail to appear within the
specified period?

A.

The court may order the opposing party to procure
the appointment of an executor or administrator for
the estate of the deceased and the latter shall
immediately appear for and on behalf of the
deceased. The court charges in procuring such
appointment, if defrayed by the opposing party,
th
may be recovered as cost. (S16 R3, 4 paragraph).

Q.

Loreto San Juan executed a will naming Oscar
Casa as one of the devisees. Upon Loreto's
death a petition for the probate of his will was
filed with the RTC. During the pendency of the
probate proceedings, Oscar died intestate.The
Aquino law firm entered its appearance as
counsel of Federico Casa Jr. who claimed to be
one of the heirs of Oscar Casa and their
representative. The probate court allowed the
appearance of the counsel and the substitution
of Oscar Casa by Federico Casa Jr., who had
been designated by the other heirs as their
representative in the probate court. Epifanio
San Juan Jr. opposed the appearance and the
substitution on the ground that under Lawas v.
Court of Appeals, 146 SCRA 173 (1986), priority
178

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 3
Parties To Civil Actions

is given to the legal representative of the
deceased, (i.e., the executor or administrator)
and that it is only in case of unreasonable delay
in the appointment of an executor or
administrator, or in case where the heirs resort
to an extrajudicial settlement of the estate that
the court may adopt the alternative of allowing
the heirs to be substituted for the deceased.
Was the substitution of the deceased Oscar by
Federico Casa Jr. proper?

A. Yes. The second paragraph of S 16 R3 of the 1997
Rules of Civil Procedure is quite clear that the heirs
of the deceased may be allowed to be substituted
for the deceased without requiring the appointment
of an executor or administrator. Hence the
pronouncement in Lawas that priority should be
given to the deceased's legal representative in
substitution is no longer good case law. ( San Juan
v. Cruz, G.R. No. 167321, 31 July 2006).
Q.

Pedro filed an action to recover possession and
ownership of a parcel of land against the
Petitioners. During the pendency of the case
Pedro died but no substitution by his heirs was
effected. The trial court ruled in favor of the
Plaintiff. Petitioners assert that the RTC's
decision was invalid for lack of jurisdiction, since
the heirs were not substituted for the deceased
Pedro. Was the trial court's decision valid?

A. Yes. Notwithstanding the general rule in S16 R3, a
formal substitution of heirs is not necessary when
they themselves voluntarily appear, participate in
the case, and present evidence in behalf of the
deceased. Strictly speaking, the rule on the
substitution of heirs is not a matter of jurisdiction
179

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

but a requirement of due process. Thus when
due process is not violated, as when the right of
the representative or heir is recognized and
protected, non-compliance or belated compliance
with the Rules cannot affect the validity of a
promulgated decision. Mere failure to substitute for
a deceased plaintiff is not a sufficient ground to
nullify a trial court's decision. The alleging party
must prove that there was undeniable violation of
due process. (De la Cruz v. Joaquin, 28 July 05)
Court compared this case with Chittick v. CA,
166 SCRA 219.
Q.

Paulo filed an action to recover possession of a
parcel of land against Deng. During the pendency
of the case, Deng, who was without counsel, died.
Paulo advised the court of Deng's death and filed
a motion for his substitution but the court did not
issue an order for the substitution of Deng. The
heirs possessed the· land. Judgment was
rendered in favor of Paulo. May Paulo enforce the
judgment against the heirs?

A.

No. The failure to substitute the heirs for the
deceased defendant deprived the court of jurisdiction
to enforce its decision against them. The rights of
the heirs of Deng to due process were violated
when they were not given the chance to defend their
side in court Hence the judgment cannot be
enforced against the heirs of Deng. (See Ferreria v.
Vda. de Gonzalez, G.R. No. L-11567,17 July 1958).

Q.

In the preceding problem, would your answer
be the same if the heirs voluntarily appeared in
court and participated in the proceedings therein?

180

J9JC9B0M

RULE 3
Parties To Civil Actions

A.

No, my answer would not be the same. The
voluntary appearance of the heirs and their
participation in the proceedings therein cured the
defect of lack of substitution. After all the heirs
were now given their day in court.

Q.

Paulo filed an action to recover possession of a
parcel of land against Deng. During the pendency
of the case, Deng died. Deng's counsel failed to
inform the court of Deng's death. The heirs
possessed the land. Judgment was rendered in
favor of Paulo. May Paulo enforce the judgment
against the heirs?

A.

Yes. Here Deng's counsel failed to inform the court
of his client's death. Since the trial court was not
informed of petitioner's death, it may not be faulted
for proceeding to render judgment without ordering
his substitution. Its judgment is thus valid and
binding upon Deng's legal representatives or
successors-in-interest, insofar as his interest in the
property subject of the action is concerned. (See
Carabeo v. Dingco, G.R. No. 190823, 4 April 2011;
Saligumba v. Palanog, G.R. No. 143365, 4
December 2008; Florendo v. Coloma, G.R. No. L60544, 19 May 1984 ). This case should be
distinguished from Ferreria where the court was

Q.

P filed an action for quieting of title with
damages against D. During the pendency of the

inform the court of D's death. Judgment was
rendered in favor of P ordering D to vacate the
181

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

land and return possession to P. The heirs of D,
who are now in possession, contend that the
judgment was void since there was no
substitution. Are they correct?
A.

No. The duty of the court to order the legal
representative to appear arises only upon
proper notice. The notation "Party-Deceased" on
the unserved notices could not be the "proper
notice" contemplated by the rule. As the trial court
could not be expected to know or take judicial
notice of the death of a party without the proper
manifestation from counsel, the trial court was well
within its jurisdiction to proceed as it did with the
case. Moreover, there is no showing that the court's
proceedings were tainted with irregularities.
It is the duty of counsel for the deceased to
inform the court of the death of his client. The
failure of counsel to comply with his duty under
Section 16 to inform the court of the death of his
client and the non-substitution of such party will not
invalidate the proceedings and the judgment
thereon if the action survives the death of such
party. The decision rendered shall bind the party's
successor-in-interest. The rules operate on the
presumption that the attorney for the deceased _____
party is in a better position than the attorney for the adverse party to know about the death of his client
and to inform the court of the name and address of
his legal representative. ( Saligumba v. Pa/anog,
G.R. No, 143365, 4 December 2008).

Q.

A filed a complaint for the recovery of
ownership of land against B who was
represented by her counsel X. In the course of
the trial, B died. However, X failed to notify the

court of B's death. The court proceeded to hear
the case and rendered judgment against B.
After the judgment became final, a writ of
execution was issued against C, who being B's
sole heir, acquired the property.
1)

If you were counsel of C, what course of
action would you take?

2)

Did the failure of counsel X to inform
the court of B's death constitute direct
contempt? (98 Bar Q6)

A.
1) If I were the counsel of C, I would file a motion
to set aside the writ of execution.
The Supreme Court has held that the failure to
substitute the heirs for the deceased defendant
deprived the court of jurisdiction to enforce its
decision against them as their rights to due process
were violated. (Ferreria v. Vda. de Gonzalez, G.R.
No. L-11567,17 July 1958).18
2) No. Direct contempt is misbehavior in the
presence of or so near a court as to obstruct or
interrupt the proceedings before the same.
(S1 R71).
Here the failure to notify the court was not a
misbehavior in the presence of or so near the court
as to obstruct or interrupt the proceedings. The
misbehavior would however amount to indirect
18

The problem asked only what course of action should be taken by C's
counsel. The course of action taken is a plausible ground to oppose the
enforcement of the writ of execution. However since X failed to notify the court
and in the light of Florendo v. Coloma and other cases, C's attempt to nullify the
writ should be unsuccessful.

contempt as it was a misbehavior of an officer of
the court in the performance of his official duties.
(S3[a] R71 ).
Q.

P filed an action for recovery of parcel of land
against D. The trial court dismissed the case
prompting P to appeal to the Court of Appeals.

Pending appeal, P died. The lawyer of P gave
notice to the CA of P's death and moved for the
suspension of the period to file appellant's brief
pending the appointment of an administrator of
P's estate in the probate proceedings. The CA
denied the motion for suspension and dismissed
P's appeal for failure to file the appellant's brief.
Was the CA correct?
A.

No. The death of P extinguished the lawyer-client
relationship and hence the lawyer had no more
authority to act in the case save to notify the court
and give the names and addresses of the legal
representative. The CA should thus have suspended
the period to file the appellant's brief until a legal
representative was appointed and the order of
substitution made. (Vda. de Haberer v. Court of
Appeals, G.R. No. L-42699, 26 May 1981 ).

Q.

The Court of Appeals dismissed a petition
under R42 on the ground that the notice of
death was belatedly filed by counsel. Was the
dismissal called for?

A.

No. Dismissal of a petition under R42 on the ground
that the notice of death was belatedly filed by
counsel was uncalled for. The same is a ground not
for the dismissal of the case but for disciplinary
proceedings against the counsel. The CA should
have ordered the representatives to appear and be

substituted pursuant to S16 R3 instead of
perfunctorily dismissing the case. (Regalado v.
Regalado, 6 June 2011 ).
Q.

Is 516 R3 applicable to a criminal case?

A. S16 R3 would not apply in case of the death of the
accused during the pendency of the case. Under
S4 R111, the death of the accused during the
pendency of the criminal action shall extinguish the
civil liability arising from the crime.
However S16 R3 would be applicable if the
civil action for the recovery of the civil liability
arising from the offense charged was deemed
instituted with the criminal action and it was the
offended party who died, in which case he would
be substituted by his legal representative/s.
Q.

What is the effect of a transfer of interest during
the pendency of the litigation?

A. The action may be continued by or against the
original party, unless the court upon motion directs
the transferee to be substituted in the action or
joined with the original party. (S19 R3).
Q.

Does 519 R3 require the counsel of parties to
report any transfer of interest?

A. No. While it may be prudent for counsel to report any
transfer of interest, S19 R3 does not require counsel
to do so. (Siguion Reyna Montecillo Ongsiako v.
Chionglo-Sia, 3 February 2016, Jardeleza, J.).
Q.

In case of any transfer of interest pendente lite,
is substitution mandatory?

185

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

No. Unless the court upon motion directs the
transferee pendente lite to be substituted, the action
is simply continued in the name of the original party.
For all intents and purposes, the Rules already
consider the transferee joined or substituted in the
proceeding a quo, commencing at the exact moment
when the transfer of interest was perfected between
original party-transferor and the transferee pendente
lite. ( Siguion Reyna Montecillo Ongsiako v ChiongloSia, 3 February 2016, Jardeleza, J.). The transferee
is joined or substituted by operation of law from the
exact moment when the transfer of interest is
perfected between the original party and the
transferee. (Natalia Realty, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,
440 Phil. 1 [2002]).

Sec. 20. Action on contractual money claims
Q.

P filed with the RTC an action to collect a loan
of PS00,000 from D. P was able to obtain a writ
of attachment and attach a property of D.
During the pendency of the case, D died.
a) Should the case be dismissed?

A.
No, the case should be allowed to continue
until final judgment.
S20 R3 provides that when the action is for
recovery of money arising from contract, express or
implied, and the defendant dies before entry of final
judgment, the action shall not be dismissed but
shall instead be allowed to continue until entry of
final judgment. D should be substituted by his legal
representative or heir. (S16 R3).

No. S20 R3 provides that the judgment should

estate of D as a money claim pursuant to R86.
c) P filed the judgment as a money claim with the
probate court. Does the writ of attachment
entitle P to preference over the other
creditors in respect of the property attached?

A.
Yes. The writ of attachment was not dissolved
since the main action was not dismissed but
continues until final judgment. Hence P is a
preferred creditor over the property attached.
(JOSE Y. FERIA, 1997 RULES OF CIVIL·
PROCEDURE 15 [1997]; Art. 2242[7], Civil Code).
Q.

P filed with the RTC an action for recovery of
possession of a parcel of land against D. D died
while the case was pending and was substituted
by his heir X who had succeeded D in the
possession of the land. P won the case and no
appeal was made by X. May P move for the
execution of the judgment against X?

A. Yes, since this is not among the cases provided for
in S5 R86 which have to be filed with the probate

court as a money claim. The judgment may be
enforced against X since he had been validly
substituted for D.
Q.

P filed an action for tort against D who had
negligently inflicted injuries upon P. D died
during the pendency of the case and was
substituted
by his heir X. Judgment was
rendered in favor of P for PS00,000. No appeal
was filed by X. May P move for the execution of
the judgment against X?

A.

No. This is a judgment for money against the
decedent and hence has to be filed with the
probate court pursuant to S5 R86.

Q.

Pambusco filed a complaint for sum of money
against D. During the pendency of the case, D
died. Intestate proceedings for the settlement of
D's estate commenced and notice to the
estate's creditors was given for them to file
their claim within 6 months from the first
publication of the notice. A month thereafter,
on Pambusco's motion, the administrator of D's
estate was substituted for D in the civil case for
collection. The court rendered judgment in
favor of Pambusco and D appealed. Pambusco
filed a contingent claim covering the judgment
award with the probate court. At the time of the
filing of the contingent claim, the 6-month
period for creditors to file their claim had
expired. In due course the judgment in favor of
Pambusco was affirmed on appeal and became
final and thus Pambusco moved that the estate
be ordered to pay Pambusco. The administrator
opposed the motion on the ground that the
claim is time-barred since the contingent claim
188

J9JC9B0M

RULE3
Parties To Civil Actions

was filed beyond the statute of non-claims. Is
the claim of Pambusco time-barred?
A.

No. Where the deceased was substituted by the
administrator in the civil action involving a money
claim, the estate is deemed to have notice of such
claim. The substitution of the deceased in the civil
action by the administrator or the decedent's
representative is generally considered as equivalent
to the presentation of the claim with the probate court.
Under the circumstances, the filing of the contingent
claim ad abundantiorem cautelam by Pambusco was
a mere formality. (Ignacio v. Pampanga Bus Co.,
G.R. No. L-18936, 23 May 1967).

Q.

(a) Plaintiff sued to recover an unpaid loan and
was awarded P333,000 by the Regional Trial
Court of Manila. Defendant did not appeal
within the period allowed by law. He died
six days after the lapse of the period to
appeal. Forthwith, a petition for the settlement
of his estate was properly filed with th~
Regional Trial Court of Pampanga where an
inventory of his assets was filed and
correspondinglyapproved. Thereafter, plaintiff
filed a motion for execution with the Manila
court, contending therein that the motion
was legally justified because the defendant
died after the judgment in the Manila court
had become final. Resolve the motion and
state your reasons.
(b) Under the same facts as (a), a writ of
execution as issued by the Manila court upon
proper motion three days after the lapse of
189

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

the period to appeal. The corresponding levy
on execution was duly effected on defendant's
parcel of land worth P666,000 a day before
the defendant died. Would it be proper, on
motion, to lift the levy on defendant's
property? State the reasons for your answer.
(92 Bar Q5).

A.

(a) I would deny the motion for execution.
Under the Rules on Special Proceedings, a
judgment for money against the decedent must be
filed with the probate court as a money claim to be
enforced in the manner provided for in R86. (S5
R86). Hence the judgment cannot be enforced by
execution.
(b) No, it would not be proper to lift the levy on
defendant's property.
Under the Rules on Civil Procedure, in case of
the death of the judgment obliger after execution is
actually levied upon any of his property, the same
may be sold for the satisfaction of the judgment
obligation. (S7[c] R39).

SEC. 21. Indigent party
Q.

Spouses B & C were the owners of a residential
and boarding house with a market value of
more than P300,000. Their total earnings were
more than double the minimum wage of an
employee. When the city demolished their
residence and boarding house, B and C filed an
action for damages with the RTC against the
city. They applied for exemption from the docket
and legal fees as indigents. The RTC denied
their application on the ground that they are

190

J9JC9B0M

RULE 3
Parties To Civil Actions

disqualified to litigate as indigents since
they do not meet the salary and property
requirements under S19 R141. May B and C still
be exempted from paying the docket and legal
fees as pauper litigants even though they do
not meet the requirements under S19 R141?
A.

Yes. B and C may still be exempted if they can
prove that they have "no money or property
sufficient and available for food, shelter and basic
necessities for themselves and their family" as
provided in Section 21 of Rule 3. If the applicant for
exemption meets the salary and property
requirements under S19 R141 19 then the grant of
exemption is mandatory. On the other hand where
the applicant does not satisfy one or both
requirements, then the applicant should not be
denied outright; instead the court should apply the
"indigency test" under S21 R3 and use its sound
discretion in determining the merits of the
application for exemption. (Spouses Algura v. City
of Naga, G.R. 150135, 30 Oct 06).

19
Indigent litigants (a) whose gross income and that of their immediate
family do not exceed an amount double the monthly minimum wage of an
employee and (b) who do not own real property with a fair market value as stated
in the current tax declaration of more than P300,000 shall be exempt from the
payment of legal fees. (S19 R141).

RULE 4. VENUE
Q.

Define venue.

A.

Venue refers to the possible or proper place or
places for the trial of a suit, as among several
places where jurisdiction could be established.
(STEVEN H. GIFIS, LAW DICTIONARY [1975]).

Q.

What is the difference between jurisdiction and
venue?

A.

Jurisdiction deals with the authority of a court to
exercise judicial power, while venue deals with the
place where that power should be exercised.
(GREENLEAF'S REPORTS, CIVIL PROCEDURE
51 [1972]).

Q.

Is venue jurisdictional?

A.

In civil cases venue is not jurisdictional. However in
criminal cases, it is.

Q.

What is a real action and what is a personal
action?

A.

A real action is an action affecting title to or
possession of real property or interest therein. Any
other action is a personal action. (S1 R4).

Q.

What is the venue of real actions?

A.

Real actions shall be commenced and tried in the
proper court which has jurisdiction over the area
wherein the real property involved, or a portion
thereof, is situated. Forcible entry and unlawful
detainer actions shall be commenced and tried in
the municipal trial court of the municipality or city
192

J9JC9B0M

RULE4

Venue
wherein the real property involved, or a portion
thereof, is situated. (S1 R4).
Q.

What is the venue of personal actions?

A.

Personal actions may be commenced and tried
where the plaintiff or any of the principal plaintiffs
resides, or where the defendant or any of the
principal defendants resides at the election of
the plaintiff.
In the case of a non-resident defendant found
in the Philippines, the action may be commenced
and tried where the plaintiff resides or where the
non-resident defendant may be found, at the
election of the plaintiff. (S2 R4).

Q.

What is the venue of an action against a nonresident defendant not found in the Philippines?

A.

If any of the defendants does not reside and is not
found in the Philippines and the action affects the
personal status of the plaintiff, or any property of
said defendant located in the Philippines, the action
may be commenced and tried in the court of the
place where the plaintiff resides (if action involves
the plaintiff's status), or where the property or any
portion thereof is situated or found (if the action
affects defendant's property). (S3 R4).
Note that S3 R4 applies to both personal and
real actions.

P, a resident of Manila, will file an action to
recover title over land registered in the name of
D, a non-resident defendant and who is not
found in the Philippines. The land is located in
Davao City. May P file the action in Manila?

A.

Yes. Under S3 R4, if any of the defendants does
not reside and is not found in the Philippines and
the action affects any property of said defendant
located in the Philippines, the action may be
commenced and tried in the court of the place
where the plaintiff resides or where the property is
situated. Hence the action may be filed in both
Manila and Davao City.

Q.

P, a resident of Manila, will file an action to
recover title over land registered in the name of
D, a non~resident defendant but who is found in
the Philippines. The land is located in Davao
City. May P file the action in Manila?

A.

No. S3 R4 does not apply if the non-resident
defendant is found in the Philippines. In such a
case, the general venue rule for real actions will
194

apply and hence the action for recovery of title over
land should be filed in Davao City.
Q.

P, a resident of Manila, will file an action to
claim ownership over a bank account in the
name of D, a non-resident defendant and who is
not found in the Philippines. The bank is
located in Davao City. Where is the venue or
where are the venues of the action?

A.

The venues are in Manila, where P the plaintiff
resides, or in Davao City, where the subject
property of Defendant D is found.
Under S3 R4, if the non-resident defendant is
not found in the Philippines and the action affects
any property of said defendant located in the
Philippines, the action may be commenced and
tried in the court of the place where the plaintiff
resides or where the property is situated or found.

Q.

P, a resident of Manila, will file an action to
claim ownership over a bank account in the
name of D, a non-resident defendant but who is
presently staying in a hotel in Cebu City while
on vacation. The bank is located in Davao City.
Where is the venue of the action?

A.

The venue may either be in Manila, where the
plaintiff P resides, or in Cebu City, where the
defendant D is found, at the election of P.
Under S2 R4, in a personal action against a
non-resident defendant found in the Philippines, the
action may be commenced and tried where the
plaintiff or any of the principal plaintiffs resides, or
where the non-resident defendant may be found, at
the plaintiff's election.

Q.

D, an American citizen, borrowed PS00,000 from
P, a Filipino citizen while vacationing in the
Philippines. D failed to pay. D went back to the
United States. May P file a suit in the Philippines
against D?

A.

No. D is a non-resident and he is not found in the
Philippines. Nor does the action affect P's personal
status or any property of D located in the Philippines.
A Philippine court cannot acquire jurisdiction over a
non-resident defendant in an action in personam.

Q.

For purposes of the rule on venue, what is the
residence of a corporation?

A.

The residence of a corporation is its principal place
of business, not its branch office. (1 FLORENZ D.
REGALADO, REMEDIAL LAW COMPENDIUM 112
[ih rev. ed., 3 rdprinting]).

Q.

D, a resident of Cebu City, borrowed P1 million
from C, a resident of Los Angeles, California,
U.S.A. D did not pay C despite demands. C
engaged Atty. B, whose office and residence is
in Quezon City, to file a collection case against
D. C executed an SPA authorizing Atty. B to
prosecute the case in his behalf. C filed the
collection case before the Regional Trial Court
of Quezon City. D filed an answer raising the
affirmative defense of improper venue, arguing
that none of the parties reside in Quezon City.
Was venue improperly laid?

A.

Yes. In a collection suit brought by a non-resident
plaintiff as represented by his attorney-in-fact, the
real party-in-interest is the plaintiff pursuant to
Section 3 of Rule 3. Hence the venue should have
been laid in the place where the defendant resides
196

RULE4
Venue

and not where the attorney-in-fact resides. (Ang v.
Ang, 22 August 2012).
Q.

Plaintiff Lawrence Heller, a U.S. Air Force
member, filed with the CFI of Pampanga an
action for damages against Dangwa Transportation
Co. and its driver. The complaint averred that
plaintiff was then stationed at Clark Air Base,
Angeles, Pampanga. The defendants filed an
answer raising the affirmative defense of improper
venue. The defendants argued that plaintiff's
assignment in the Philippines is temporary
since members of the United States Air Force
may be assigned any time to any station under
the exclusive control and decision of the
Commanding Officer; and that, the venue of the
action should not be Pampanga but the City of
Baguio or Benguet, Mountain Province, where the
defendants reside. Was venue improperly laid?

A.

No. Residence for purposes of determining venue
under S2 R4 simply means a place of abode,
whether permanent or temporary. What is of
paramount importance is where plaintiff actually
resided or where he may be found at the time he
brought the action. Here plaintiff had his actual
residence at Clark Air Base, Angeles, Pampanga,
at the time he filed his action. Hence venue was
properly laid. (Oangwa Transportation Co. v.
Sarmiento, 31 January 1977).

Q.

Plaintiff Claridades filed an action with the CFI
of Bulacan, where he resides, against Mercader
and Fernandez for the dissolution of their
partnership. The main asset of the partnership
was a fishpond located in Marinduque. Defendants
filed an answer in which they alleged that the
197

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

partnership had so far been unproductive and
that this was the· result of Plaintiff's failure to
contribute his share. Defendants counterclaimed
for damages. Subsequently the court granted
leave to intervene to Zulueta and his wife who
alleged that they had bought the fishpond and
were now its owners. Zulueta and his wife were
given 10 days to file such pleading as they may
deem necessary for the protection of their
rights. The Zuluetas then filed an answer raising
the affirmative defense of improper venue.
a) May the case be dismissed on the ground of
improper venue?
b) If the action filed by Plaintiff against
Defendants were a real action affecting title
over the fishpond, would your answer still
be the same?
A.
a)

No. An action for the dissolution of a
partnership is a personal and not a real action,
notwithstanding the fact that the main asset of
the partnership was a real property. The sale of
the fishpond would merely be a necessary
incident to the liquidation of the partnership.
Hence the venue was properly laid.

b) Yes my answer would still be the same.
The defendants had already waived the
objection against improper venue when they did not
raise the same in the answer.
The court having legally acquired authority to
hear and decide the case, it cannot be divested of
that authority by the intervenors. An intervention
198

J9JC9B0M

RULE4

Venue
cannot alter the nature of the action and the issues
joined by the original parties thereto. ( Claridades v.
Mercader, 17 SCRA 1 [19661). Intervention is not
an independent proceeding but one which is merely
ancillary to the existing action.
Q.

Petitioner filed with the RTC of Davao City a
complaint for nullification of deed of sale of
land against the respondent. The petitioner
alleged that he never signed the questioned
deed of sale. The subject land is located in
Carmen, Davao del Norte. The respondent filed
an answer raising the affirmative defense of
improper venue stating that the complaint
should have been filed with the RTC of Davao
del Norte which has jurisdiction over Carmen,
the place where the subject land is located.
May the case be dismissed on the ground of
improper venue?

A.

No, the complaint for nullification of the Deed of
Sale of land is a personal action since there was no
allegation that the possession and title to the
property have been transferred to respondent;
nowhere in the complaint did petitioner allege or
pray for the recovery or reconveyance of the real
property. Hence venue was properly laid in Davao
City where the parties reside. (Racpan v. BarrogaHaigh, 6 June 2018, Velasco, J.).

Q.

P filed a complaint against the surety with the
RTC of Manila. The surety then filed a thirdparty complaint against X, who had executed an

the surety in case it becomes liable under the
surety bond. X filed an answer to the third-party
complaint raising the affirmative defense of
199

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

improper venue. X pointed out that the indemnity
agreement between the surety and X contains a
provision that any suit arising from the
agreement shall be solely and exclusively filed
in Quezon City. Should the court dismiss the
third-party complaint?

A.

No. A third-party complaint is ancillary to the main
case. Thus a third-party complaint has to yield to
the jurisdiction and venue of the main action.
(Eastern Assurance & Surety Corp. v. Cui, G.R. L54452, 20 July 1981).

Q.

P, a corporation, filed a complaint for
annulment of contracts of loan with cancellation
of real estate mortgage against D in Pasig, the
place where P had its office. P alleged that the
contract of loan was without the knowledge of
the corporation. P, the mortgagor, is still in
possession of the real property mortgaged. D
raised the affirmative defense of improper
venue in his answer, contending that the
annulment of the real estate mortgage is a real
action, since P sought to compel D to accept its
payment and thus affecting title over the
property and free it from the encumbrance.
Thus it should have been filed in Quezon City,
where the encumbered properties are located.
Is the complaint for cancellation of real estate
mortgage a real action?

A.

No. The instant action to annul a contract and its
accessory REM is a personal action. An action for
cancellation of REM is a personal action if the
mortgagee has not foreclosed the mortgage and
the mortgagor is still in possession of the premises
as his title to or possession of the property is not in

mortgagor was still in possession of the realty
mortgaged. ( Chua v. Total Office Products and

Q.

Eduardo, a resident of the City of Manila, filed
before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila
a complaint for the annulment of a Deed of Real
Estate Mortgage he signed in favor of Galaxy
Bank (Galaxy), and the consequent· foreclosure
and auction sale of his mortgaged Makati
property. Galaxy filed a Motion to Dismiss on
the ground of improper venue alleging that the
complaint should be filed with the RTC of Makati
since the complaint involves the ownership and
possession of Eduardo's lot. Resolve the motion
with reasons. (16 Bar Q4).

A.

The motion to dismiss on the ground of improper
venue should be granted. Under the Rules of Civil
Procedure, the venue of real actions shall be with
the proper court having jurisdiction over the area
where the real property involved is situated. An
action for annulment of mortgage is a real action if
there has already been a foreclosure sale. (See
Chua v. Total Office Products and Services, 30
September 2005).
Here there was already a foreclosure sale.
Hence the action for annulment of mortgage is a
real action which should have been filed in Makati
where the real property is situated.20

20
1n First Sarmiento Holdings Inc. v. Phil. Bank of Communications, 19
June 2018, e.b., Leonen, J., it was held that the action for annulment of real

action) and not a real action because although there had been a foreclosure
sale, the certificate of sale had not yet been registered with the register of deeds.

A brings an action in the Metropolitan Trial
Court of Manila against B for the annulment of
an extrajudicial foreclosure sale of real property
with an assessed value of PS0,000 located in
Laguna. The complaint alleged prematurity of
the sale for the reason that the mortgage was
not yet due. B timely moved to dismiss the case
on the ground that the action should have been
brought in the Regional Trial Court of Laguna.
Decide with reasons. (00 Bar Q 18a).

A.

Insofar as the motion to dismiss is based on
improper venue - since it argued that the action
should have been brought in Laguan - the same
should be granted.
The action for annulment of the extrajudicial
foreclosure sale of real property is a real action since
there has been a foreclosure sale and thus the
action affects title to the real property mortgaged.
(See Chua v. Total Office Products & Services, 30
September 2005). Hence the venue lies in Laguna,
the place where the real property is situated.21

RULE4

Venue

The mortgagors filed a motion for reconsideration
wherein they reiterated the previous grounds and
added the ground of improper venue, contending
that the action for deficiency was a real action
which should have been brought in Manila. The
motion for reconsideration was denied. The
mortgagors went up to the Court of Appeals on a
petition for certiorari. The CA granted the petition
and ordered the dismissal of the action on the
ground of improper venue, holding that it was a
real action which should have been filed in
Manila. Was the CA's decision correct?
A.

No, the CA's decision was not correct.
First, an action to recover the deficiency after
extrajudicial foreclosure of a real estate mortgage is
a personal action since it does not affect title to or
possession of real property or any interest therein.
Hence the action was properly brought in Makatr'
where the mortgagee has its main office.
Second, even assuming that there · was
improper venue, the ground was waived by the
mortgagors since they did not timely raise it in their
answer. Here the ground of improper venue was
raised belatedly in the motion for reconsideration,
not in the answer. Hence the objection was waived
pursuant to S1 R9. (BP/ Family Bank v. Yujuico, 22
July 2015, Bersamin, J.).

the land in Mindoro.
203

PRlfvlER~REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

8 filed a motion to dismiss on the ground
that the Batangas court did not have
jurisdiction over the subject matter, the land
being located in Mindoro. 8 however did not
allege improper venue in his motion. Decide
with reasons. (88 Bar Q4b).
A.

Motion to dismiss denied. The ground that the
Batangas court did not have jurisdiction over the
subject matter is without merit as the Regional Trial
Court has jurisdiction over actions incapable of
pecuniary estimation under B.P. Big. 129. An action
for rescission of contract is one which is incapable
of pecuniary estimation.
The more pertinent ground for the motion to
dismiss was improper venue. However under S2
R9, defenses and objections not raised in the
motion to dismiss are deemed waived. Here the
defense of improper venue was not alleged in the
motion to dismiss. Hence B is deemed to have
waived the same.
Even if the motion to dismiss were to be
considered as substantially raising the defense of
improper venue, the motion would still be denied.
The action for rescission of the lease contract is a
personal action since the complaint filed by the
lessee did not pray for the recovery of possession
of the land.22 Hence the motion to dismiss would
still be denied.

Q. When is Rule 4 on venue of actions not applicable?

A.

1) Civil and criminal actions for libel shall be filed
with the Regional Trial Court having jurisdiction
over the place where the libelous article is
printed and first published or where any of the
offended parties actually resides at the time of
the commission of the offense. (Article 360,
Revised Penal Code). Article 360 also provides
for special venue provisions if one of the
offended parties is a public officer whose office
is in Manila.
2)

Petitions for declaration of nullity and annulment
of marriage shall be filed in the Family Court of
the province or city where the petitioner or
respondent has been residing for at least 6
months prior to the date of filing, or in case of a
non-resident respondent, where he may be
found in the Philippines, at the election of the
petitioner. (Sec. 4, SC Rule on Declaration of
Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages and
Annulment of Voidable Marriages). Same venue

Q.

P applied for 6 cellular phone subscriptions with
Piltel. P later filed with the RTC of lligan City a
complaint for sum of money and damages
against Piltel. The latter raised the affirmative
defense of improper venue, citing the common
provision in the subscription agreements which
provide that:
"Venue of all suits arising from this
Agreement shall be in the proper courts of
Makati City. Subscriber expressly waives any
other venue."
Should the affirmative defense of improper
venue be granted?

A.

Yes. The exclusive venue provision was held to be
valid by the Supreme Court. The SC distinguished
this case from Sweet Lines v. Teves, 83 SCRA 361,
in which the plaintiffs were virtually compelled to buy
tickets from Sweet Lines otherwise they would be
stranded in Bohol. Here the Plaintiff had unfettered
freedom to sign or not sign the subscription

executed three Real Estate Mortgages in favor

of Union Bank. Section 9 of the Real Estate
Mortgage Deeds provides as follows:
Section 9. Venue. - The venue of all suits and
actions arising out of or in connection with this
Mortgage shall be in Makati, Metro Manila, the
parties hereto waiving any other venue.

May PAGLAUM file an action for annulment of
the mortgages with the RTC of Cebu City?

A.

No. The phrase, "waiving any other venue" means
that the parties have agreed that the venue of all
actions arising from the mortgage shall be in Makati
City. (Paglaum Management Corp. v. Union Bank,
18 June 2012).

Q.

Lessor filed a complaint against lessee with the
RTC of Valenzuela City for collection of unpaid
rentals amounting to PS million. The lease
contract provided that "all actions filed in
connection with this lease shall be filed with the
RTC of Pasay City, exclusive of all others."
Lessee filed several motions for extension of
time to file a responsive pleading and when he
eventually filed his answer, it contained a
counterclaim and third-party complaint. In his
answer, the lessee raised the affirmative
defense of improper venue. May the case be
dismissed on the ground of improper venue?

A. Yes. The venue stipulation is a restrictive or
exclusive one; hence any action arising from the
lease contract shall be filed only in the RTC of Pasay
City. That respondent had filed several motions for
extension of time to file a responsive pleading, or
that he interposed a counterclaim or third-party
complaint in his answer does not necessarily mean
208
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE4

Venue
that he waived the affirmative defense of improper
venue. There is no inconsistency in seeking
dismissal of the main complaint while pursuing one's
counterclaim or third-party complaint in the same
case. (Ley Construction Corp. v. Sedano, 23 August
2017, Perlas-Bernabe, J.).
Q.

PB Com filed a collection case against D before
the RTC of Manila, PB Com's place of business,
based on the Surety Agreement (SA) executed
by D in relation to a credit line PB Com extended
to International Trading Company. However, in
the promissory note executed by ITC, it was
expressly stipulated that the "venue for any legal
action that may arise out of said Promissory Note
shall be Makati to the exclusion of all other
courts." D raised the affirmative improper venue.
Should the affirmative defense be granted?

A.

Yes. Under the "complementary-contracts-construedtogether" doctrine, an accessory contract must be
read in its entirety and together with the principal
agreement. The SA can be enforced only in
conjunction with the promissory note (PN). The
venue stipulation in the promissory note thus also
applies to the SA as an ancillary contract of the
promissory note. The venue should be laid in
Makati. (Phil. Bank of Communications v. Lim, G.R.
23
158138, 12 April 2005).

Q.

Respondent entered into a payroll agreement
with the bank. The agreement contained a venue

23
The ruling is arguable. To extend the venue provision in the promissory
note to the SA would run afoul of the principle of relativity in contract law which
provides that contracts are binding only between or among the parties thereto.
Resort to a doctrine of construction or interpretation was unnecessary since there
was no ambiguity or vagueness in the venue provision.

stipulation which reads thus: "In case of
litigation, venue shall be in the proper trial
courts of Manila for determination of any and all
questions arising hereunder." A dispute arising
from the payroll agreement between Respondent
and the bank ensued.
Respondent filed an
action for damages with the RTC of Quezon City
where he resides. The bank raised the affirmative
defense of improper venue. Should the affirmative
defense be granted?
A.

No. The venue stipulation here is not exclusive but
merely permissive for it does not contain the words
expressing the intent that Manila is an exclusive
venue, like "exclusively" or "solely." Hence the filing
of the case in Quezon City where the plaintiff
resides is proper. (Philippine Bank of Communications
___ v. Trazo, 30 August 2006).

Q.

Guina is the president and general manager of
Air-Swift
International,
a single registered
proprietorship engaged in the freight-forwarding
business. Mangila engaged the services of Guina
to transport goods but she did not pay Guina.
Guina thus filed a collection suit against Mangila
before the RTC of Pasay City, where Air-Swift
holds office. Guina resides in Paranaque City
while
Mangila resides in San Fernando,
Pampanga. Mangila raised the affirmative defense
of improper venue. She points to a provision in
Guina's invoice which contains the following
venue provision:
3. If court litigation becomes necessary to
enforce collection, the agreed venue for such
action is Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines.

J9JC9B0M

RULE4
Venue

Should the affirmative defense be granted?
Explain.
A.

Yes, the affirmative defense of improper venue
should be granted, although for a reason different
from that invoked by Mangila.
Under the Rules of Civil Procedure, the venue
of a personal action is in the residence of either the
plaintiff or the defendant.
Here what is involved is a collection suit which
is a personal action. However, neither the Plaintiff
Guina nor the Defendant Mangila resides in Pasay
City. The fact that Air-Swift International holds office
in Pasay City is irrelevant since a single proprietorship
does not possess juridical personality and thus
cannot be a party to a suit.
Hence Pasay City is not the proper venue for
the action.
The venue stipulation is not the proper basis
for dismissing the case on the ground of improper
venue. The Supreme Court has held that a veAue
stipulation which does not contain words of
exclusivity is merely a permissive venue stipulation
which simply provides for an additional venue.
Hence the case may not be dismissed for
improper venue on the basis of the venue provision
since it is not exclusive. The case however may be
dismissed on the ground of improper venue
because it was not filed in the residence of either
the Plaintiff or the Defendant. (Mangila v. Guina, 12
August 2002, Carpio, J.).

Q.

How may the ground of improper venue be
raised by the defendant?

A.

As an affirmative defense in the answer. (S12[a]
R8, 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure). It may no
longer be raised in a motion to dismiss. (S12[a]
R15, 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure).

Q.

May the trial court dismiss a complaint motu
proprio on the ground of improper venue?

A.

No, since if the defendant does not raise the
objection of improper venue in the answer, he is
deemed to have waived it. However in cases
governed by the Rule on Summary Procedure and
in ejectment cases, the trial court instead of issuing
the summons may from an examination of the
allegations in the complaint and such evidence as
may be attached thereto dismiss the case outright
on any of the grounds for dismissal of a civil action
which are apparent therein, including improper
venue. (Section 4, Revised Rules on Summary
Procedure; S5 R70).
Under the Revised Rules of Procedure for
Small Claims Cases, after the court determines that
the case falls under such rules, it may from an
examination of the allegations of the Statement of
Claim/s and such evidence attached thereto, by
itself, dismiss the case outright on any of the
grounds for the dismissal of the case, including
improper venue.
If during the hearing the court is able to
determine that there exists a ground for the dismissal
of the Statement of Claim/s, the court may by itself
dismiss the case even if such ground is not pleaded

Q.

Petitioner was born in 1989 in Sabah, Malaysia. It
was only in 2008 that her mother reported her
birth to the Philippine Statistics Authority in
Quezon City. However her birth year was
erroneously recorded as 1980 instead of 1989.
She filed a petition under R108 with the RTC of
Davao City, where she resides, to correct her
year of birth in her report of birth. The RTC motu
proprio dismissed the petition on the ground of
improper venue stating that under S1 R108 the
petition should have been filed with the RTC of
Quezon City. Was the dismissal correct?

A.

No. Venue is procedural, not jurisdictional, and
hence, may be waived. It was erroneous for the
RTC to motu proprio dismiss the petition before it
on the ground of improper venue. Since
convenience is the raison d'etre of the rules on
venue, and as it was established that Davao City is
the residence of petitioner, and as further pointed
out by the OSG, PSA has a field office located in
Davao City, it is the most convenient for the parties.
Moreover, it is well-settled that courts may not
motu proprio dismiss the case on the ground of
improper venue. Without any objection at the
earliest opportunity, as in a motion to dismiss or in
the answer, it is deemed waived. The OSG did not
register any objection to the venue of the petition.

2)

Cases where the total amount of the plaintiff's
claim does not exceed P100,000 or P200,000
in Metro Manila, exclusive of interests and cost.
Note however that if the claim falls under the

Q.

In an ejectment case, the court dismissed the
complaint for failure of the plaintiff to appear
during the preliminary conference. The Plaintiff
filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal
order. The Defendant contends that the dismissal
had become final and executory since the
motion for reconsideration is a prohibited
pleading and hence does not suspend the
reglementary period to appeal. Is the Defendant's
contention correct?

A.

No. The motion for reconsideration prohibited under
Sec. 19(c) of the Rule on Summary Procedure is
that which seeks reconsideration of a judgment
rendered by the court after trial on the merits. The
215

Q.

How is a small claims action commenced?

A.

A small claims action is commenced by filing with
the court an accomplished and verified Statement
of Claim/s.

Q.

What are the venue rules for small claims cases?

A.

The regular rules on venue shall apply. However if
the plaintiff is engaged in the business of banking,
lending, and similar activities, and has a branch in
the municipality or city where the defendant
resides, the Statement of Claims shall be filed
where that branch is located.

Q.

What are the prohibited pleadings and motions
in small claims cases?

A.

The prohibited pleadings and motions are
essentially the same as those prohibited under the
Rule on Summary Procedure. The only difference is
that motions to dismiss on whatever ground are
prohibited in small claims cases. (See 816).

Q.

May the defendant file a permissive counterclaim?

A.

Yes the defendant may also elect to file a

that the amount and nature thereof are within the
coverage of the Rule and the prescribed docket
and other legal fees are paid. (S 15).24

Q.

Are decisions in small claims cases appealable?

A.

No, decisions in small claims cases are final,
executory, and unappealable. (S24 ). An aggrieved
party may however resort in appropriate cases to a
special civil action for certiorari in case of grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of or excess
of jurisdiction. (A.L. Ang Network, Inc. v. Mondejar,
22 January 2014 ). The petition for certiorari shall be
filed with the RTC. Since a motion for reconsideration
is a prohibited pleading, a party must file the
petition for certiorari without filing a motion for
reconsideration of the judgment.

No, inasmuch as the parties may enter into
compromise at any stage of the proceedings.

REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

What are the kind of defenses?

A.

Defenses may either be negative or affirmative. A
negative defense is the specific denial of the
material fact or facts alleged in the pleading of the
claimant essential to his cause or causes of action.
An affirmative defense is an allegation of a new
matter which, while hypothetically admitting the
material allegations in the claimant's pleading,
would nevertheless prevent or bar recovery by him.
(S5 R6).

Q.

Give examples of affirmative defenses.

A.

Fraud, prescription, release, payment, illegality,
statute of frauds, estoppel, former recovery, discharge
in bankruptcy, and any other matter by way of
confession and avoidance. (S5[b] R6, first paragraph).
Affirmative defenses may also include grounds
for the dismissal of a complaint, specifically, that
the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter,
that there is another action pending between the
same parties for the same cause, or that the action
26
is barred by a prior judgment.
(S5(b] R6, second
paragraph).

Q.

Plaintiff files a complaint against B and C who
are made co-defendants. C files an answer
serving a copy thereof upon P. Does C also
need to serve a copy upon 8?

A.

No. A co-defendant does not need to serve a copy
of the answer against a co-defendant, except
where there is a cross-claim in the answer or in
case of S5 R62 in interpleader where the conflicting

claimants should serve a copy of the answer on
their co-defendants.
Counterclaim
Q.

What is a counterclaim?

A.

A counterclaim is any claim which a defending party
may have against an opposing party. (S6 R6).

Q.

How is a counterclaim set up or pleaded? May a
counterclaim be set up in a motion to dismiss?

A.

While technically a separate and independent
pleading, a counterclaim by common practice is
pleaded or set up in an answer. (See S8 R11 ). Thus
the practice of denominating such an answer as
"Answer with Compulsory/Permissive Counterclaim/s."
A counterclaim cannot however be set up in a
motion to dismiss. The reason is that unlike in the
case of an answer (S8 R 11), there are no
provisions in the Rules which provide that
counterclaims may be set up in a motion to dismiss.

Q.

P files a case against D. D files a counterclaim
against P. May P file a counterclaim against D's
counterclaim?

A.

Yes. A counterclaim may be asserted against an
original counterclaimant.

Q.

The Republic, through the PCGG and with the

Chavez as a defendant in a counterclaim
221

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

for filing a harassment suit. Was the filing
of a counterclaim against Solicitor General
Chavez proper?

A.

No. A counterclaim is any claim which a defending
party may have against an opposing party. Chavez
was not the opposing party but merely the counsel
of the opposing party. Enrile has to file a separate
suit if he wants to claim damages against Chavez.
(Chavez v. Sandiganbayan, 193 SCRA 282 [1991]).

Q.

PX filed a suit for damages against DY. In his
answer, DY incorporated a counterclaim for
damages against PX and AC, counsel for plaintiff
in said suit, alleging in said counterclaim, inter
alia, that AC, as such counsel, maliciously
induced PX to bring the suit against DY despite
AC's knowledge of its utter lack of factual and
legal basis. In due time, AC filed a motion to
dismiss the counterclaim as against him on the
ground that he is not a proper party to the case,
he being merely plaintiff's counsel. xxx Should
AC's motion to dismiss the counterclaim be
granted or not? Reason. (04 Bar Q9).

A.

Yes, AC's motion to dismiss the counterclaim
should be granted. As held in Chavez v.
Sandiganbayan, 193 SCRA 282 (1991), the lawyer
of the opposing party is himself not a party to the
case and thus a counterclaim is not proper against
him. DY should file a separate suit against AC.

Q.

Is there an instance wherein a counterclaim
may be asserted by the defending party against
one who is not an opposing party?

A.

Yes. Under S13 R6, a third-party defendant may in
proper cases assert a counterclaim against the

Section 7. Compulsory Counterclaim

Q.

Why is a compulsorycounterclaimtermed as such?

A.

A compulsory counterclaim is termed compulsory
because there is an element of compulsion to set it

otherwise allowed by the Rules of Court. Under S2

defendant has a compulsory counterclaim, he
should not file a motion to dismiss but an answer
with a counterclaim, with the ground for the motion
to dismiss being asserted as an affirmative defense
pursuant to S6 R16. (Financial Building Corp. v.

counterclaim? and
(d) Is there any logical relation between the claim
and the counterclaim?

226

RULE6
Kinds Of Pleadings

A positive answer to all four questions would
indicate that the counterclaim is compulsory. ( GS/S
v. Caballero, G.R. No. 158090, 4 October 2010).
Q.

What is the "compelling test of compulsoriness"
to determine whether a claim is compulsory?

A.

The test involves asking the question whether there
is a "logical relationship between the claim and the
counterclaim, that is, where conducting separate
trials would entail a substantial duplication of effort
and time by the parties and the court." If there is
such a logical relationship, then the claim is
compulsory. (Tan v. Kaakbay Finance Corp., G.R.
146595, 20 June 2003).
Note: From an analysis of Supreme Court
decisions, a rule of thumb that may be used is the
test of opposition or inconsistency: would the grant
of the complaint necessarily defeat or negate the
counterclaim? Alternatively, would the grant of the
counterclaim necessarily defeat or negate the
complaint? If the answer is yes, then the counterclaim
is compulsory; if no, then the counterclaim
is permissive.

Q.

Plaintiff filed suit for nullification of a promissory
note against the Defendant on the ground of
usurious and unconscionable interest rates.
The Defendant counterclaimed for the payment
of the P1,000,000 loan with interest. He however
did not pay the docket fees. Should the
counterclaim be dismissed for failure to pay
docket fees?

A.

No. The counterclaim for the payment of the loan
with interest is compulsory since it arises out of or
is connected to the loan transaction subject of the

227
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

complaint. The grant of the counterclaim would
necessarily negate or defeat the suit for nullification.
Being compulsory, there is no need to pay the filing
fees thereon. (Tan v. Kaakbay Finance Corp., G.R.
146595, 20 June 2003; Alba v. Malapajo, 13
January 2016, Peralta, J.).
Q.

Should filing fees be paid on compulsory
counterclaims?

A.

No. While compulsory counterclaims are subject to
filing fees, the payment thereof has been
suspended by the Supreme Court.
The old rule was that filing fees were required of
permissive but not compulsory counterclaims. (S?[a]
R141). S?(a) was later amended on 16 August 2004
so as to impose filing fees also on compulsory
counterclaims filed before the RTC. Payment
however of such filing fees was suspended by the
SC Resolution dated 21 September 2004 [AM. No.
04-2-04-SC]).
Confusion later arose from the obiter dictum in
Korea Technologies Co., Ltd. v. Lerma, 542 SCRA
1, 16-17 (2008), which stated that "effective August
16, 2004 under Sec. 7 Rule 141, as amended by
A.M. No. 04-2-04-SC, docket fees are now required
to be paid in compulsory counterclaim or crossclaim." As a result some courts were collecting
filing fees on compulsory counterclaims citing
Korea Technologies Co., Ltd.
The obiter clearly overlooked the SC Resolution
of 21 September 2004. Thus the Supreme Court's
Office of the Court Administrator issued a
clarificatory circular stating that the obiter dictum
"has been deleted in a revised issuance" and that

228

"the Resolution of this Court in A.M. No. 04-2-04SC dated September 21, 2004 suspending
payment of filing fees for compulsory counterclaims
remains in effect." (OCA Circular No. 96-2009,
dated 13 August 2009).
Note however that the payment of filing fees
on cross-claims was not suspended.
Q.

Fernando mortgaged his land and building to
the GSIS to secure a loan he obtained from the
latter. Fernando defaulted on his loan so the
GSIS foreclosed on the loan and later acquired
it at the foreclosure sale. GSIS consolidated its
title over the realty after the lapse of the
redemption period. Subsequently GSIS awarded
the realty to CMTC after public bidding in which
Fernando also participated.
Fernando then filed a suit with the Regional
Trial Court against GSIS and CMTC for
nullification of the bid award to CMTC and for
the declaration of his own bid as the winning
one. GSIS filed an answer with counterclaim for
the recovery of rentals from the realty which
Fernando had been collecting from CMTC despite
the consolidation of title by the GSIS. GSIS did
not pay any filing fee on the counterclaim. After
trial, the RTC dismissed Fernando's complaint
and granted GSIS's counterclaim for rentals. On
appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the
dismissal but deleted the award of rentals in
favor of the GSIS.
a)

Is the counterclaim of GSIS for rentals a
compulsory or a permissive counterclaim?

229

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

b)

Did the CA rule correctly in deleting the
award of rentals to GSIS?

A.
a) The counterclaim of GSIS for rentals is a
permissive counterclaim.
One of the tests devised by the Supreme Court
is to ask whether substantially the same evidence
will support or refute plaintiff's claim as well as the
defendant's counterclaim. A negative answer as in
this case means that the counterclaim is permissive.
The evidence needed by Fernando to cause the
annulment of the bid award and the sale to CMTC
is different from that needed by GSIS to establish
its claim for the recovery of rentals. A favorable
judgment on Fernando's complaint to nullify the
GSIS's bid award to CMTC would not preclude a
favorable judgment for GSIS on its counterclaim to
recover the rentals which Fernando had been
collecting from CMTC after GSIS had become the
owner of the property.
b) Yes the CA acted correctly in deleting the award
of rentals to GSIS.
The rule in permissive counterclaims is that
for the trial court to acquire jurisdiction, the
counterclaimant is bound to pay the prescribed
filing fees. Since the GSIS failed to pay the filing
fees, the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction over its
permissive counterclaim. The judgment rendered
by the RTC, insofar as it ordered Fernando to pay
GSIS the rentals which he collected from CMTC, is
considered null and void. Any decision rendered
without jurisdiction is a total nullity and may be

struck down at any time, even on appeal. ( GS/S v.
Caballero, G.R. No. 158090, 4 October 2010).
Q.

Aya sues Lea for recovery of a tract of land.
Lea seeks in turn to be reimbursed of the value
of improvements she had introduced on the
same land and the payment of damages she
had sustained. Should Lea file a separate action
against Aya for that purpose? (94 Bar Q16)

A.

No, Lea should not file a separate action agains~
Aya for that purpose.
Under S2 R9, a compulsory counterclaim not
set up shall be barred.
Here the claim of Lea for reimbursement of the
value of the improvements she had introduced on
the same land and the payment of damages she
had sustained is a compulsory counterclaim since it
arises out of or is connected to the suit of Aya for
recovery of land. A favorable judgment on Lea's
counterclaim would negate Aya's suit for recovery
since Lea would have the right of retention under
Article 546 of the Civil Code. Hence Lea should set
up her claim for reimbursement and damages as a
compulsory counterclaim against Aya. (See Camara
v. Aguilar, 94 Phil. 527).

Calibre Traders entered into a distributorship

breaching its obligations under the distributorship
agreement by refusing to reconcile accounts
and by appointing other distributorsin Pangasinan
and Tarlac. Bayer filed an answer with
counterclaim for unpaid accounts under the
distributorship agreement. Calibre filed a motion
to dismiss the counterclaim on the ground that
it was permissive and Bayer had not paid the
docket fees thereon. Bayer opposed the motion
arguing that its counterclaim was compulsory.
The trial court denied the motion to dismiss,
stating that the counterclaim was compulsory.
After trial, the court rendered judgment in favor
of Calibre. In its judgment, the trial court also
dismissed Bayer's counterclaim stating that
since it was permissive, the trial court did not
acquire jurisdiction over the same for nonpayment of the docket fees thereon.
a)

Was Bayer's counterclaim permissive or
compulsory?

b) Did the trial court rule properly in dismissing
Bayer's counterclaim?
A.

a) Bayer's counterclaim was permissive.
Although the rights and obligations of the
parties are anchored on the same contract, the
causes of action they filed against each other are
distinct and do not involve the same factual
issues. There is no logical relationship between the
two actions in a way that the recovery or dismissal of
plaintiff's suit will establish a foun'ciation for the
other's claim. The counterclaim for collection of
money is not intertwined with or contingent on
Calibre's own claim for damages, which was based

232

RULE6
Kinds Of Pleadings

on the principle of abuse of rights. Both actions
involve the presentation of different pieces of
evidence. Calibre's suit had to present evidence of
malicious intent, while Bayer's objective was to
prove nonpayment of purchases. (Calibre Traders,
Inc. v. Bayer Phils. Inc., G.R. No. 161431, 13
October 2010). The grant of Bayer's counterclaim for
unpaid accounts would not necessarily defeat
or negate Calibre's suit for damages based on
abuse of rights.
b)

No, the trial court did not act properly in
dismissing the counterclaim of Bayer.

Bayer here was in good faith in not paying the
docket fee since it relied upon the trial court's
earlier order denying the motion to strike out the
counterclaim and stating that the counterclaim was
compulsory. What the trial court should have done
was to require Bayer to pay the docket fee within a
reasonable time but not beyond the prescriptive
period. Furthermore, Bayer should not suffer for the
mistake of the trial court. (Id.).
Q.

In a suit by lessor against lessee for unpaid
rentals, is the counterclaim by lessee for
damages against the lessor for the latter's
taking over the leased premises and harvesting
crops permissive?

A.

Yes. The complaint and the counterclaim are not
repugnant or inconsistent with each other. The fact
that the lessor is entitled to unpaid rentals would
not authorize him to unilaterally take over the
premises and harvest the crops planted by the
lessee. (Sy-Vargas v Estate of Ogsos, 5 Oct 2016,

Q.

Metrobank foreclosed extrajudicially on the real
estate mortgage executed in its favor by the
spouses Reynoso to secure the loan of CPR
Promotions,
Metrobank bought the realty
mortgaged at the auction sale. Subsequently
Metrobank filed an action against the Reynosos
with the regional trial court to collect on the
deficiency of P2.6 million. The Reynosos filed an
answer where they raised the defense that the bid
price exceeded the amount of the mortgage
obligation. They filed counterclaims for moral and
exemplary damages and attorney's fees, alleging
that the suit was unfounded. The RTC rendered
judgment in favor of Metrobank.
The Reynosos appealed to the Court of
Appeals. In their appeal brief, the Reynosos
prayed for the return of the excess of the bid
price over the amount due under the mortgage.
The CA reversed the RTC and ordered Metrobank
to refund to CPR P722,000, representing the
excess of the bid price over the amount due
under the mortgage. Assuming that the bid price
did indeed exceed the Reynosos' mortgage
obligation, was it proper for the Court of Appeals
to order the refund of the excess?

A.

No. Under S2 R9, a compulsory counterclaim not
set up is barred.
Here the claim of the Reynosos for the refund
of the excess over the bid price was a compulsory
counterclaim since it is inconsistent with or in direct
opposition to the claim for deficiency of Metrobank.
Hence it should have been set up as a compulsory
counterclaim in the action for deficiency filed by
Metrobank. Since it was not, the claim for refund
234

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE6

was barred. (Metrobank v. CPR Promotions, 22
June 2015, Velasco, J.). The last opportunity for the
Spouses Reynoso to set up their claim for refund
was by amendment before judgment pursuant to
S10 R11. They could no longer set up the claim for
refund on appeal. The fact that in their answer with
the RTC the Reynosos raised as a defense the
excess of the bid price over the obligation will not
benefit them since a defense is not a counterclaim.

Q.

D borrowed P1,000,000 from P secured by a real
estate mortgage executed by D in P's favor. The
mortgage contained a special power of attorney
authorizing P to sell the real estate at the
foreclosure sale. D defaulted in the payment of
the loan. D filed an action against P to nullify the
real estate mortgage on the ground that his wife
did not give her consent thereto. Judgment was
rendered in favor of P dismissing D's complaint.
a)

P filed an action to collect on the loan
against D. Is the action barred?

b)

Instead of an action to collect on the loan, P
filed an action for judicial foreclosure
against D. Is the action barred?

c)

Instead of an action to collect or for judicial
foreclosure, P filed a petition for extrajudicial
foreclosure against D. Is the action barred?

A.
a) No. Applying the opposition test, we find that
the action to collect on the loan is not a
compulsory counterclaim which should have
been set up by P in the action for nullification of
the real estate mortgage. A judgment nullifying
235

•

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

the real estate mortgage would not preclude P
from collecting on the principal loan since the
mortgage is only an accessory obligation.
b) Yes. Applying the opposition test, it can be seen
that a judgment nullifying the mortgage would
necessarily preclude an action to foreclose
upon it. Hence the action for judicial foreclosure
is a compulsory counterclaim which is barred
since it was not set up in the nullification suit.
c)

Q.

No. The right to foreclose extrajudicially is a
substantive right under Act No. 3135 which cannot
be repealed or abrogated by a procedural rule.
(Papa v. Banaag, 17 SCRA 1083, 1086 [1966]).
Besides a petition for extrajudicial foreclosure,
being precisely extrajudicial, cannot be set up
as a counterclaim before a regular court.

b)

Yes. In the RTC, a counterclaim may be

the family court.

d)

It depends. If the RTC is also a special
commercial court, then the counterclaim may be
filed before it. If the RTC is a non-SCC, then the

The RTC has jurisdiction over Ramon's
counterclaim for P130,000 as damagElS.al'.ld· -·
attorney's fees but it does not have jurisdiction
over the counterclaim for P250,000.

A counterclairn must be within the jurisdiction
of the court both as to the nature and amount.
However in an original action before the RTC the
counterclaim may be considered as compulsory
regardless of its amount.
Hence the RTC has jurisdiction over the claim
for P130,000 which is a compulsory counterclaim
even though the amount thereof does not exceed
P300,000. The RTC however does not have
jurisdiction over the permissive counterclaim for
P250,000 since the same does not exceed the
jurisdictional amount of P300,000.
Ramon does not have to pay docket fees on
the P130,000 counterclaim. While S?(a) R141 as

on compulsory counterclaims filed before the RTC,
the payment of such docket fees has been

Suggested Answer of UP Law Center & Philippine
Association Of Law Schools:
A.

Yes, the RTC has jurisdiction over Ramon's
counterclaims because they are all money claims in
which the totality rule applies in determining
jurisdiction. (Sec. 5[d], Rule 2, Rules of Court).

(Note: It is submitted that the totality rule
cannot be applied. This is because in the case of a
compulsory counterclaim the RTC would have
jurisdiction over it regardless of its amount. [S? R6].
Otherwise put in a compulsory counterclaim, the
amount thereof does not serve as a test of
jurisdiction. Hence the amount of the compulsocy
counterclaim should not be added to the amount of
the permissive counterclaim in order to determine
jurisdiction. It would be however different in the case
of two or more permissive counterclaims that are
principally for recovery of money in which case the
aggregate amount would be the test of jurisdiction.)
Ramon has to pay docket fees for his
counterclaim
whether
the
counterclaim
is
compulsory or permissive in nature. Rule 141 of the
Rules of Court has been amended to require
payment of docket fees for counterclaims and
cross-claims whether compulsory or permissive.

unlawful detainer against P. The Court of Appeals
ruled that the raising of the counterclaim for
ejectment was improper since such could only be
initiated by a verified complaint pursuant to S4
R70. Was the filing of the counterclaim improper?
A.

No. There is no rule that an ejectment suit cannot be
raised in a counterclaim. In fact the counterclaim for
ejectment was compulsory since it was connected
with the transaction or occurrence constituting the
subject matter of the opposing claim, i.e., the lease
contract between D and P. ( Chan v. Court of

No. Once a decision has become final and

court is to order its execution. To allow the
supplemental hearing would be to amend or
alter a final and executory judgment.

b) No. Under S2 R9, a compulsory counterclaim
not set up is deemed barred. The claim for
reimbursement of the value of the improvements
is in the nature of a compulsory counterclaim
since it is connected with the transaction or
occurrence constituting the subject matter of
the Petitioners' claim. Hence it should have
been set up as a compulsory counterclaim in
the action filed by Petitioners against the
Private Respondents. The Private Respondents'
argument that they could not have raised the
counterclaim for reimbursement of the value of
the improvements as it would run counter to
their defense of ownership is without merit.
Under S2 RS a party may set forth two or more
statements of a defense alternatively or
hypothetically. Inconsistent defenses may be

that each defense is consistent with itself.

Q.

Would the dismissal of the main complaint also
result in the dismissal of the counterclaim
pleaded therein?

A.

No. Unlike the 1964 Rules of Civil Procedure, the

main complaint will not correspondingly result in the
243

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

dismissal of the counterclaim where the defendant
had already filed and served his counterclaim upon
the plaintiff. The defendant has the option of
prosecuting the counterclaim in the same or in a
separate action. (S6 R16 1997 Rules of Civil
Procedure, 82 & 3, R17). The exception would be
under S2 R 17 where the defendant pleaded his
counterclaim after the service upon him of the
plaintiff's motion for dismissal. In such a case, the
dismissal of the complaint will also result in the
dismissal of the counterclaim. The reason is quite
obvious: the defendant already has notice of the
plaintiff's motion for dismissal at the time he pleads
his counterclaim and is therefore presumed to have
borne the risk of dismissal.

her answer a counterclaim for damages against
Globe Asiatique for filing a malicious and
harassment suit against her. The judge in Case 2
dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction
stating that it cannot interfere with the orders of
the coordinate court in Case 1. It also dismissed
the counterclaim of Padilla on the ground that
244

RULE6
Kinds Of Pleadings

the dismissal of the main complaint necessarily
carried with it the dismissal of the compulsory
counterclaim.Was the dismissal of the compulsory
counterclaim correct?

A.

No. Under the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, it i~
now explicitly provided that the dismissal of the
complaint due to failure of the plaintiff to prosecute
his case is "without prejudice to the right of the
defendant to prosecute his counterclaim in the
same or in a separate action." (S3 R17). The effect
of this amendment is to abandon previous rulings
that the dismissal of a complaint carries with it the
dismissal of the counterclaims. While S3 R17 refers
to dismissal of complaints due to the fault of
plaintiff, it does not preclude the application of the
same rule when dismissal is at defendant's
instance. The court's jurisdiction over respondent's
complaint is not to be confused with jurisdiction
over petitioner's counterclaim. (Padilla v. Globe
Asiatique Realty Corp., 6 August 2014).27

Q.

Financial Building Corporation (FBC) was engaged
by the U.S.S.R government to construct a multilevel apartment building in Forbes Park. Forbes
Park Association (FPA) suspended all entry
permits of the construction after discovering
that the same would violate the subdivision's
deed of restrictions. FBC filed an action for
injunction and damages against FPA anchored
on the contention that FPA's prohibition on the

27
The Court need not have relied by analogy upon 83 R17. The more
precise provision is 86 R16 which provides that the dismissal of the complaint
pursuant to said provision shall be without prejudice to the prosecution in the
same or separate action of a counterclaim pleaded in the answer. The rule in
816 R16 was not carried over to the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure (apparently
inadvertently) but it is submitted that ii is still applicable.

construction work was improper (first case). FPA
filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the
complaint fails to state a cause of action since it is
the USSR, not FBC, which was the real party-ininterest. The motion to dismiss was granted. The
order of dismissal became final. Later on FPA filed
an action against FBC to remove the structures
it had built and for damages (second case).
a)

If you were the counsel for FBC, what would
you do?

b) If you were the counsel for FPA, instead of
filing a motion to dismiss, what would you
have done?
c)

Assume that no motion to dismiss was filed by
FBC in the second case and the RTC rendered
a decision in favor of FPA. On appeal may
the judgment of the RTC in the second case be
set aside? If so, on what ground?

A.
a) I wouid file a motion to dismiss the suit of FPA
on the ground of res judicata, specifically, that
the second case should have been raised as a
compulsory counterclaim in the first case. (S2
R9). The claim to demolish the structures was a
compulsory counterclaim which should have
been set up in the injunction case. Such a
counterclaim would defeat or negate FBC's
complaint for injunction which alleged that the
prohibition on construction was improper.
b)

I would not file a motion to dismiss but an
answer and raise the ground for the motion to
dismiss (i.e., failure to state a cause of action)
246

as an affirmative defense in the answer. (S6
R16, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure). I would
plead in my answer the claim for damages and
removal as a compulsory counterclaim. In such
a case, the dismissal of the complaint would
have been without prejudice to the prosecution
in the same or separate action of a counterclaim
pleaded in the answer, pursuant to S6 R16.
c) Yes the judgment of the RTC may be set aside
on the ground of res judicata. Note that the
defense of res judicata may be raised for the
first time even on appeal. (Financial Building

Q.

P sues D who moves to dismiss on the ground of
prescription. The motion is granted and the case

Then, D sues P on a claim arising out of the
same transaction or occurrence as P's earlier
attempted claim. P defends on the ground that
D's claim is precluded by his failure to raise it as
a counterclaim in the first action. Is P's defense
meritorious?

A.

Yes. D should not have filed a motion to dismiss but
an answer interposing his counterclaim and raising
the ground of prescription as an affirmative defense.
(S6 R16, 1997 Rules of Procedure; Financial
Building Corp. v. Forbes Park Association, supra).
Since he failed to set up his compulsory counterclaim
in the first action, the same is deemed barred.

Q.

Fe filed a collection suit for P387,000 against
Ramon in the RTC of Davao City. Aside from
alleging payment as a defense, Ramon in his
answer set up counterclaims for P100,000 as
damages and P30,000 as attorney's fees as a
result of the baseless filing of the complaint, as
well as for P250,000 as the balance of the
purchase price of 30 units of airconditioners
he sold to Fe.
a)

b)

Suppose Ramon's counterclaim for the
unpaid balance is P310,000, what will happen
to his counterclaims if the court dismisses
the complaint after holding a preliminary
hearing on Ramon's affirmative defenses?

c)

Under the same premise as paragraph (b)
above, suppose that instead of alleging
payment as a defense in his answer, Ramon
filed a motion to dismiss on that ground, at
the same time setting up his counterclaims,
and the court grants his motion. What will
happen to his counterclaims? (08 Bar Q2)

b)

Ramon's counterclaim may be prosecuted in
the same or in a separate action pursuant to S6
R16 which provides that the dismissal of the
action shall be without prejudice to the
defendant prosecuting his counterclaims in the

S2 R9. A counterclaim cannot be set up in a
motion to dismiss. (Financial Building Corp. v.
Forbes Park Association, Inc., 338 SCRA 346).
His counterclaim for P310,000 may still be
prosecuted in a separate action since it is a
permissive counterclaim.
Q.

Petitioner filed a complaint for consolidation of
title over land sold to him by Respondent under
a pacto de retro sale. Respondent filed an
answer with counterclaim asking that Petitioner
receive P810 and that the pacto de retro sale be
declared as an equitable mortgage. Petitioner
did not file an answer to the Respondent's
counterclaim. Upon motion, the trial court declared
Petitioner in default as to Respondent's
counterclaim and rendered judgment in favor of
Respondent. Did the trial court properly declare
Petitioner in default in respect of Respondent's
counterclaim?

A.

No. The counterclaim of Respondent is compulsory
since it is connected with the subject matter of
Petitioner's complaint for consolidation. A party
cannot be declared in default for failing to answer a
compulsory counterclaim because the issues raised
in the compulsory counterclaim are deemed
automatically joined by the allegations of the
complaint. (Gojo v. Goya/a, 35 SCRA 557 [1970]).

Q.

Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant for
recovery of possession of real property with the
Regional Trial Court of Manila. Defendant filed
an answer with affirmative defenses and interposed
a counterclaim for damages and attorney's fees
arising from the filing of the complaint. When
plaintiff failed to file an answer on the
249

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

counterclaim, defendant moved to declare him
in default. Notwithstanding notice of the motion,
plaintiff did not file an opposition.
As judge, how would you resolve the motion
to declare plaintiff in default? (96 Bar Q6[3]).
A.

As judge, I would deny the motion to declare
plaintiff in default
The Supreme Court has held that a party
cannot be declared in default for failing to answer a
compulsory counterclaim, since the issues in
such counterclaim are automatically traversed by
the complaint.
Here the counterclaim for damages and
attorney's fees arising from the filing of the complaint
is a compulsory counterclaim since it arises from the
filing of the complaint by the plaintiff. Hence plaintiff
cannot be declared in default.

Q.

L obtained a series of loans from Banco de Oro
for which he executed three real estate
mortgages. L defaulted on the 3rd loan and the
bank extrajudicially foreclosed the mortgage on
rd
the 1st and 3 loans. Before the scheduled public
auction, L filed with the RTC of Quezon City a
complaint for specific performance, torts, and
damages against the bank for including the 1st
real estate mortgage in the foreclosure. The
bank filed an answer in which it raised the
defense that there is a cross-default provision in
the loan contracts that justifies the inclusion of
properties in the 1st real estate mortgage in the
foreclosure. The auction sale then proceeded
but the proceeds realized therefrom were not
sufficient to answer for L's loan obligation. The

250

RULE6
Kinds Of Pleadings

bank sent a demand letter to L to pay the
deficiency but this was not heeded by L.
Subsequently, during the pendency of the
Quezon City case, the bank filed with the RTC of
Mandaluyong against L an action for collection
of the deficiency. L filed a motion to dismiss on
the ground that the action for the deficiency was
a compulsory counterclaim that should have
been set up in the Quezon City case since it
arose from the same loan transaction. Should
L's motion to dismiss the action for the
deficiency be granted?
A.

No. The action for the deficiency does not involve a
compulsory counterclaim. A compulsory counterclaim
is one which must be existing at the time of filing
the answer. (S8 R 11). An after-acquired counterclaim
is merely permissive. Thus, a party who fails to file
a counterclaim arising out of or connected with the
transaction subject of the plaintiff's suit but which
did not exist at the time said party files his answer
is not barred from filing such claims. He can do so
by supplemental pleading or by a separate action.
Here BDO's right of action accrued only after L's
refusal to pay after receiving demand letters for the
deficiency from BOO. (Banco de Oro v. Locsin, 25
August 2005, Carpio-Morales, J.).

SEC. 8. Cross-claim

Q. What is a cross-claim?
A.

A cross-claim is any claim by one party against a
co-party arising out of the transaction or occurrence
that is the subject matter either of the original action
or of a counterclaim therein. Such a cross-claim
may cover all or part of the original claim. (S8 R6).
251

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A cross-claim may include a claim that the
party against whom it is asserted is or may be liable
to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim
asserted in the action against the cross-claimant.
Q.

D and E are solidarily indebted to P for
PS00,000. P filed a collection case against D
and E for PS00,000. D filed his answer in which
he alleged that he had already paid PS00,000 to
P prior to the filing of the complaint. Judgment
rendered in favor of D and E dismissing P's
complaint, the court finding that D had already
paid P even prior to the filing of the case. The
judgment became final and executory. D then
files an action to collect P250,000 from E as
reimbursement. E files a motion to dismiss on
the ground that D should have filed his claim as
a cross-claim in the collection case filed by P.
Should the court grant the motion to dismiss?

A.

Yes. A cross-claim not set up is deemed barred.
(S2 R9). D should have filed in the first case a
cross-claim against E for reimbursement.

Q.

Is there such a thing as a permissivecross-claim?

A.

In a sense yes. A cross-claim which either matured
or was acquired by a party after serving his pleading
is not compulsory. (S9 R11, Namarco v. Federation
of Namarco Distributors, Inc., 49 SCRA 238).

Q.

D and E are jointly and severally indebted to P
under a promissory note for PS00,000. P sues D
and E before the RTC. D filed a cross-claim
against E to recover P450,000 arising from the
non-payment of the price of a car sold and
delivered by D to E. Is the filing of the crossclaim proper?

252
J9JC9B0M

RULE6
Kinds Of Pleadings

A.

No. A cross-claim is any claim by one party against
a co-party arising out of the transaction or
occurrence that is the subject matter either of the
original action or of a counterclaim therein (S8 R6).
Here, the cross-claim is not proper since the claim
by D against E did not arise out of the loan
transaction subject of the complaint. Hence the
court cannot take cognizance of the cross-claim.

Q.

P filed a case against D and E. D filed a crossclaim against E. E did not answer the cross.:.
claim. May D move to declare E in default of the
cross-claim?

A. Yes. E should answer the cross-claim otherwise he
may be declared in default of the same. Under S3
R9 the claiming party may move for default in case
of failure to answer of the defending party. The
cross-claimant is a claiming party while the crossdefendant is a defending party within the purview of
the Rules of Court. (S1 R3). Compare with the rule
that the opposing party cannot be declared in default
for failure to answer a compulsory counterclaim.
Q.

P filed a case against D and E. D filed a crossclaim against E. May E in his answer to the
cross-claim, assert a counterclaim against D's
cross-claim?

A. Yes. The cross-defendant can file an answer to the
cross-claim and he may plead in the answer a
counterclaim or a cross-claim. (See old S10 R6).
Q.

D and E are solidarily indebted to P for
PS00,000. P filed a collection case against D
and E for PS00,000. D and E filed their answer
alleging the defense of prescription. Judgment
rendered in favor of P and the same became

253
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

final and executory. D pays the PS00,000 to the
sheriff. D then files an action to collect P250,000
from E. E files a motion to dismiss on the
ground that D should have filed his claim as a
cross-claim in the collection case filed by P.
Should the court grant the motion to dismiss?

A.

No. The cross-claim is not compulsory but permissive
since D's right to reimbursement arose only after he
had served his answer. Prior to paying P, D did not
yet have the right of reimbursement as against E.

Q.

D borrowed PS00,000 from P with X acting as
the surety. D did not pay on maturity so P sued
D and X. Judgment rendered in favor of P as
against D and X for PS00,000. The bank account
of X was garnished in the amount of PS00,000. X
demanded indemnification from D but the latter
did not pay X. X sued D for indemnification. D
argued that X's claim for indemnification was
waived since he did not raise it as a cross-claim
pursuant to S2 R9. Is D's argument meritorious?

A.

No. The cross-claim was merely permissive since
X's right to indemnification only arose after he had
paid D. Also under S35 R39, when a judgment is
upon an obligation of one of the parties as security
for another, and the surety pays the amount or any
part thereof, either by sale of his property or before
sale, he may compel repayment from the principal.

Q.

S unlawfully ousted O from his parcel of land.
S then sold and delivered the land to B. 0 files
an action for reconveyance against S and B.
Judgment was rendered in favor of 0. The
judgment became final and executory. Later on
B filed an action for breach of warranty against
254

RULE6
Kinds Of Pleadings

eviction against S. S moved to dismiss on the
ground that the action was barred since B
should have raised the same as a cross-claim
against S in the reconveyance suit. Should S's
motion to dismiss be granted?

A.

No. A cross-claim which matured or arose after the
defendant has served his answer is permissive and
not mandatory. (S9 R11).
Here B's cross-claim for breach of warranty
against eviction arose only after a final judgment
had been rendered in the reconveyance suit. Under
the Law on Sales, the warranty against eviction
cannot be enforced until a final judgment has been
rendered whereby the vendee loses the thing
acquired or a part thereof. (Articles 1548 and 1557,
Civil Code). Hence the cross-claim is not barred.

Q.

Is a cross-claim subject to the payment of a
docket fee?

A. A cross-claim filed before the MTC is not subject
to a docket fee but one filed with the RTC is.
(S?[a] R141).
Q.

P filed a complaint for collection of a P1 ,000,000
loan against D and E before the RTC of Manila.
D filed a counterclaim against P for PS00,000 for
moral and exemplary damages claiming that the
filing of the suit was malicious and baseless. D
also filed a counterclaim against P for P450,000
arising from the unpaid price of a car sold by D
to P. In the meantime D also filed a cross-claim
against E for indemnification contending that
the loan was really incurred for the benefit of E
only. No docket fees were paid on the counterclaims
and cross-claim.

SEC. 10. Reply
Q.

Define a reply.

A.

A reply is a pleading, the function of which is to
deny, or allege facts in denial or avoidance of new
matters alleged in or relating to an actionable
document attached to the answer. (S10 R6).

Q.

When a plaintiff file a reply?

A.

A plaintiff may file a reply only if the defending
party attaches an actionable document to his
answer. (Id.)

Q.

Is there a need for the Plaintiff to file a reply?

A.

No. The reason is that even if a plaintiff does not file
such reply, all the new matters alleged in the
answer, including those alleged in or relating to an
actionable document attached to the answer, are
deemed controverted. If the plaintiff wishes to
interpose any claims arising out of the new matters
so alleged, he shall set forth such claims in an
amended or supplemental complaint. (S10 R6).

257

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

When is there a need for the Plaintiff to file a
reply?

A.

If the defending party attaches an actionable
document to his answer and the plaintiff wishes to
contest the genuineness and due execution of the
actionable document, he should file a reply thereto.
(S10 R6). Such a reply must be verified in
accordance with S8 RB. Otherwise the genuineness
and due execution of the actionable document are
deemed admitted by the plaintiff.

Q.

When may the defendant file a rejoinder?

A.

If an actionable document is attached to the reply,
the defendant may file a rejoinder if the same is
based solely on an actionable document. (S10 R6,
2020 Rules of Civil Procedure).

SEC. 11. Third-party complaint.
Q.

What is a third-party complaint?

A.

A third-party complaint is a claim that the defendant
may file against a person not a party to the action
for contribution, indemnification, subrogation or any
other relief, in respect of his opponent's claim.
(CISO). The defendant should obtain leave of court
in order to file a third-party complaint.

Q.

What is a fourth-party complaint?

A.

A fourth-party complaint is a claim that the thirdparty defendant may file against a person not a
party to the action for contribution, indemnification,
subrogation or any other relief, in respect
of his opponent's claim. The third-party defendant
should obtain leave of court in order to file a fourthparty complaint.

Q.

Distinguish a third-party complaint from a thirdparty claim.
~

A.

AS TO ITS NATURE. A third-party complaint is a
pleading while a third-party claim is not a pleading
but-an affidavit or paper.
AS TO WHO FILES. A third-party complaint is
filed by a party to a case while a third-party claim is
filed by a stranger to the case.
AS TO PURPOSE. The purpose of a thirdparty complaint is for the defendant to bring in a
stranger as a party to the case while the purpose of
the third-party claim is for the third-party to notify
the sheriff of his right or claim over the property
attached, levied, or seized by the sheriff.

Q.

Illustrate each of the grounds for a third-party
complaint.

A.

CONTRIBUTION. If D and X are liable for tort
against P and the latter sues D only, D may file a
third-party complaint against X for contribution,
since joint tort-feasors are solidarily liable under
Article 2194 of the Civil Code.
INDEMNIFICATION. P sues the surety to
recover the loan the latter had guaranteed. The.,
surety may file a third-party complaint against the
principal debtor for indemnification. At any rate, a
judgment against the surety is also binding upon
the principal debtor who had notice of the action or
proceeding and an opportunity at the surety's
request to join in the defense. (S46 R39; 2
MANUEL V. MORAN, COMMENTS ON THE
RULES OF COURT 346 [1979 ed.]).

SUBROGATION. X recklessly drives his car
and collides with P's car destroying it. P sues the
insurer to recover damages on his car insurance
policy. The insurer can file a third-party complaint
against X since it would be subrogated to the rights
of the insured upon payment to the latter.
OTHER RELIEF IN RESPECT OF HIS
OPPONENT'S CLAIM. P sues D to recover real
property. D may file a third-party complaint against
X, who sold the real property to him, for breach of
warranty against eviction. (Art. 1548, Civil Code).
Insured sues insurer to recover on the policy issued
by the latter. The insurer may file a third-party
complaint against the re-insurer.
Q.

When may the third (fourth,
complaint be denied admission?

etc.)-party

A.

The third (fourth, etc.)-party complaint shall be
denied admission, and the court shall require29 the
defendant to institute a separate action, where: (a)
the third (fourth, etc.)-party defendant cannot be
located within 30 days from the grant of such leave;
(b) matters extraneous to the issue in the principal
case are raised; or (c) the effect would be to
introduce a new and separate controversy into
30
the action.

2
9why should the court require the defendant to institute a separate
action? This matter should be left to the defendant's discretion. The defendant
may not want to pursue his claim in a separate action.
30
1t is submitted that grounds (b) and (c) are too broadly stated and would
defeat the purpose of providing for third (fourth, etc.)-party complaints, that is, to
avoid multiplicity of suits. They also go against the principle that a third-party
complaint is independent of and distinct from the complaint. It should suffice that
the third-party complaint is "in respect of' the claim of the third-party plaintiff's
opponent. It is suggested that the test of propriety discussed in the next question
should be the test of whether to admit or not the third-party complaint.

260
J9JC9B0M

RULE6
Kinds Of Pleadings

Q.

What is the test to determine the propriety of a
third-party complaint?

A. The test to determine the propriety of a third-party
complaint is to ask the following questions:
1)

Is the third-party defendant's liability to the
third-party plaintiff premised on the latter's
liability to the plaintiff?

2)

May the plaintiff directly assert a claim against
the third-party defendant?

An affirmative answer to any of these questions
means that the third-party complaint is proper.31
Q.

A bank lent money to a company. The money
lent was misappropriated by certain officers of
the company. In the collection suit filed by the
bank against the company, may the latter file a
third-party complaint against the erring officers?

A.

No. A third-party complaint is, under the Rules,
available only if the defendant has a right to
demand contribution, indemnity, subrogation or any
other relief from the supposed third-party defendants
in respect to the plaintiffs claim. (Sec. 1, Rule 12,
Rules of Court).
Here the officers of the defendant corporation
had nothing to do with the loan of defendant
corporation with the bank. Consequently, they
cannot be made parties defendants in a third-party
complaint. (Commercial Bank & Trust Co. v.
Republic Armored Car Service Corp., 8 SCRA

Q.

Rufino is indebted to Simplicio in the amount of
P400,000 payable on 31 December 2007. To meet
the obligation, Rufino had saved P200,000 by
January 2007. During that month, Rosendo was
able to borrow the P200,000 from Rufino after
having been warned that Rosendo should return
the P200,000 to Rufino before 31 December 2007.
In February 2008, Simplicio sued Rufino for
the collection of his credit. Rufino pleaded in
his Answer that he was ready to pay P200,000
to Simplicio and, reciting his transaction with
Rosendo, he filed a third-party complaint against
Rosendo for the recovery of the P200,000. Is the
third-party complaint admissible? (80 Bar Q2 ed).

A.

No the third-party complaint is not admissible.
Under S11 R6, a third-party complaint is
available only if the defendant has a right to
demand contribution, indemnity, subrogation or any
other relief, in respect of his opponent's claim.
Here the right to demand relief by Rufino
against Rosendo was not in respect of Simplicio's
claim against Rufino. Hence the third-party
complaint is not admissible. (See Commercial Bank

In an action filed by A against Band C with

C file a third-party complaint against D for
the amount of P225,000? (97 Bar Q2b ed).

b)

No, C cannot file a third-party complaint against

D is not in the way of a claim for contribution,

Q.

Plaintiff lent money to D with S acting as surety.
S acted as surety upon a counterbond given by
X which counterbond would answer to S in case
he is held liable upon the loan. D was unable to
pay Plaintiff who sued D and S. May S file a
third-party complaint against X?

A. Yes. The third-party complaint by S against X is in
respect of P's claim against S. X's liability to S is
premised upon S's liability to the Plaintiff. 32

D borrowed PS00,000 from P with X acting as
the surety. D did not pay on maturity so P sued
X. Judgment rendered in favor of P as against
X for PS00,000. The bank account of X was
garnished in the amount of PS00,000. X demanded
indemnification from D but the latter did not pay

should have filed a third-party complaint against
D and not having done so, the action for
indemnification is barred by res judicata or
waiver. Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

A.

No. Unlike a compulsory counterclaim or a crossclaim, the filing of a third-party complaint is not
compulsory and has no preclusive effect. Hence
X's claim for indemnification against D is not barred
by res judicata or waiver.

Q.

Paras was a passenger of a bus operated by
Inland. The Inland bus was bumped by a
Philtranco bus negligently driven by its driver.
Paras suffered injuries and incurred substantial
hospitalization and medical expenses. Paras
filed with the RTC a complaint against Inland
based on contract of carriage. Inland, with leave
of court, filed a third-party complaint against
Philtranco based on quasi-delict. The RTC
rendered a judgment absolving Inland from
liability and finding that the collision was due to
the negligence of the Philtranco driver. The RTC
ordered Philtranco to pay damages to Paras.
On appeal, Philtranco challenges the decision
contending that it cannot be held liable directly
to Paras since Paras' suit is against Inland and
is based on culpa contractual while lnland's
third-party complaint against it is based on
quasi-delict. Philtranco argues that since it was
merely subrogated to Inland, there should first
be a finding of lnland's liability to Paras before
Philtranco can be held liable. Is Philtranco's
argument correct?

A.

No. Under S11 R3, a third-party complaint is a claim
that a defending party may, with leave of court, file
264

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE6
Kinds Of Pleadings

against a person not a party to the action for
contribution, indemnity, subrogation or any other
relief, in respect of his opponent's claim.
Under this Rule, a person not a party to an
action may be impleaded by the defendant either
(a) on an allegation of liability to the latter; (b) on
the ground of direct liability to the plaintiff; or, (c)
both (a) and (b). The situation in (a) is covered
by the phrase "for contribution, indemnity or
subrogation;" while (b) and (c) are subsumed under
the catch all "or any other relief, in respect of his
opponent's claim." It is worth adding that allowing
the recovery of damages by Paras based on quasidelict, despite his complaint being upon contractual
breach, served the judicial policy of avoiding
multiplicity of suits and circuity of actions by
disposing of the entire subject matter in a single
litigation. (Philtranco Service Enterprises v. Paras,
25 April 2012, Bersamin, J.).
Ancillary jurisdiction over third-party complaint
Q.

D and E are solidarily indebted to P for
PS00,000. The debt is due and outstanding. P
sues D for PS00,000 before the regional trial
court. D filed a motion for leave to file a thirdparty complaint against E seeking contribution
of P250,000. Should the court grant the motion
even though the amount of the claim does not
exceed PJ00,000?

A. Yes. Where the regional trial court has jurisdiction
over the main case, it also has ancillary jurisdiction
over the third-party complaint even though the
amount claimed falls below the jurisdictional
amount. A third-party complaint is merely auxiliary

Q.

In an action brought by PCIB against RM and
XV before the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila,
XV interposed a counterclaim of P450,000; a
cross-claim against RM for PS00,000; and a
thirdaparty complaint against DE for 425,000, all
of which were dismissed, upon proper motions,
for lack of jurisdiction. Discuss the merits of the
said order of dismissal. (85 Bar Q2ed).

A.

The order of dismissal with respect to the
counterclaim is proper because a counterclaim
must be within the jurisdiction of the court, both as
to its nature and amount. (S7 R6).
It is submitted that the dismissal with respect
to the cross-claim and third-party complaint is also
proper. It is believed that the doctrine of ancillary
jurisdiction is not applicable if what is involved is a
main action filed with a metropolitan trial court
rather than a regional trial court since the amounts
of the cross-claim and third-party complaint would
be above rather than below the jurisdictional
amount. It is also difficult to conceive how a thirdparty complaint, which is for contribution, indemnity,

exceed

the

Dean Mariano Magsalin is of the opinion that
the MTC has jurisdiction over the third party
complaint invoking the doctrine of ancillary jurisdicJiQn
as set forth in Republic v. Central Surety &
Insurance Co., 25 SCRA 641. (MARIANO MAGSALIN,
ANSWERS TO BAR QUESTIONS FROM 1980 TO
st
1989, p. 71 [1 ed.]). In Republic v. Central Surety
& Insurance Co., however, the main complaint was
filed with the Court of First Instance and the thirdparty complaint was for an amount falling below the
then jurisdictional amount of P10,000. In the given
bar problem, the amount of the third-party
complaint falls above the jurisdictional amount of
P400,000.

Q.

P filed a complaint against the surety with the
RTC of Manila. The surety then filed a thirdparty complaint against X, who had executed an
indemnity agreement undertaking to indemnify
the surety in case it becomes liable under the
surety bond. X filed a motion to dismiss the
third-party complaint on the ground of improper
venue. X pointed out that the indemnity agreement
between the surety and X contains a provision
that any suit arising from the agreement shall
be solely and exclusively filed in Quezon City.
Should the court dismiss the third-partycomplaint?

A.

No. A third-party complaint is ancillary to the main
case. Thus a third-party complaint has to yield to
the jurisdiction and venue of the main action.

Q.

CCC Insurance Corp. issued a surety bond in
favor of Kawasaki Steel Corp. to guarantee the
repayment of the advance made by Kawasaki
to FFM Construction. Upon failure of FFM
Construction to repay Kawasaki, Kawasaki
demanded payment on the surety bond against
CCC Insurance. CCC Insurance denied liability
and refused to pay, raising the defense of
novation of the principal obligation. Kawasaki
sued CCC Insurance which filed a third-party
complaint against FFM Construction for
indemnification. FFM corporation was declared in
default with respect to the third-party complaint.
Judgment was rendered in favor of Kawasaki
against CCC Insurance on the main complaint
and in favor of CCC Insurance against FFM
Construction on the third-party complaint. On
appeal, may the third-party complaint against
FFM Corporation be dismissed for lack of
cause of action?

A. Yes. The rights to indemnification and subrogation
of a surety arise only upon its payment of the
obligation to the obligee. In the case at bar, since
CCC Insurance has refused to acknowledge and
pay its obligation to Kawasaki under the Surety
Bond, it has not yet acquired the rights to seek
indemnification from FFM Construction and
subrogation to Kawasaki as against FFM Construction.
In the same vein, the corresponding obligation of
FFM Construction to indemnify CCC Insurance has
yet to accrue. Thus far, there is no act or omission
on the part of FFM Construction which violated the
right of CCC Insurance and for which the latter may
seek relief from the courts. In the absence of these
elements, CCC Insurance has no cause of action
268
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE6
Kinds Of Pleadings

against FFM Construction. Resultantly, the thirdparty complaint of CCC Insurance should be
dismissed. (CCC Insurance Corp. v. Kawasaki
Steel Corp., 22 June 2015).
Note: The ruling is arguable. In effect it holds
that the surety may sue the principal only after it
had made payment to the obligee, either voluntarily
or through execution, thereby depriving the surety
of the right to resort to a third-party complaint
against the principal and negating S11 R6's
purpose of avoiding multiplicity and circuitry of
suits. In fact under S46 R39, the surety need not
even file a third-party complaint against the
principal but can simply give him notice of the
action or proceeding, in which case the principal is
also bound by any judgment rendered against the
surety. Under FRCP 14(a) a defending party may,
as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and
complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to
it for all or part of the claim against it. Similarly S8
R6 provides that a cross-claim "may include a claim
that the party against whom it is asserted is or may
be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a
claim asserted in the action against the crossclaimant." This proviso that a cross-claim may be
filed against a party who may be liable to the crossclaimant is applicable mutatis mutandis to a thirdparty complaint.
Third-party complaint independent and distinct from
main complaint
Q.

P filed an action to recover on his insurance
claim against insurer D. D filed a third-party
complaint against the re-insurer E which was

269

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

allowed by the trial court. Judgment was rendered
in favor of P in respect of his complaint against D,
and in favor of D on its third-party complaint
against E. Only D appealed from the judgment
against it. May D move for the execution of the
judgment on the third-party complaint against E?

A. Yes. A third-party complaint is independent of and
distinct from the complaint. Hence the judgment on
the third-party complaint may become final and
executory without waiting for the final determination
of the main case. (See Pascual v. Bautista, 33
SCRA 301 [1970]; Firestone Tire & Rubber Co., v.
Tempongko, 27 SCRA 418 [1969]). E should have
appealed the judgment against it if it still wanted to
contest the same.
Q.

P filed a case against D. D filed a motion for
leave of court to file a third-party complaint
against E. The court issued an order disallowing
the third-party complaint. May D appeal from
the order?

A.

Yes. Such an order would finally dispose of D's
right to implead E. (Vda. de Dias v. Balagot, 20
SCRA 950 [1967]).

SEC. 13. Answer to third (fourth, etc.) party complaint

Q.

X's car collides with P's car destroying the
latter's car. P sues the insurer to recover
damages on his car insurance policy. The
insurer files a third-party complaint against X.
May X in his answer to the third-party complaint
raise the defense that P's car was at the time of
the collision being driven by P's friend who did
not have a valid driver's license, thus violating

270
J9JC9B0M

RULE6
Kinds Of Pleadings

the authorized-driver clause of the car policy
and barring P from recovering thereon?

A.

Yes. Under S13 R6, a third-party defendant may
allege in his answer defenses that the third-party
plaintiff may have against the original plaintiff's
claim. The violation of the authorized-driver clause
is a defense that the insurer may have against the
claim of the insured P, yet this may be invoked by X
in order to defeat or negate the insurer's claim
pursuant to S13 R6.

Q.

P filed a collection case against D who had
acted as a surety in a loan extended by P to X.
D in turn filed a third-party complaint against X
for indemnification. It turned out that X had
already paid his loan to P even before P had
brought his suit. May X file a counterclaim
against P for moral and exemplary damages for
bringing a malicious and unfounded suit and
causing X to be dragged into court?

A.

Yes. Ordinarily a third-party defendant may not file
a counterclaim against the original plaintiff, since
the original plaintiff is not an opposing party as to
him. However under S13 R6, the third-partydefendant,
in proper cases, may assert a counterclaim against
the original plaintiff in respect of the latter's claim
against the third-party plaintiff. Here X's counterclaim
is connected to the loan transaction subject of the
suit filed by P against D. (S13 R6).

RULE 7. PARTS OF A PLEADING
Q.

What are the parts of a pleading? (SBCA)

A. The parts of a pleading are the following:

Q.

1)

Caption. This sets forth the name of the court,
the title of the action, and the docket number if
assigned.

2)

Body. The body of a pleading sets forth its
designation, the allegations of the party's claim
or defenses, the relief prayed for, and the date
of the pleading.

3)

Signature and address. Must include also the
matters stated in answer to the next question.

What matters or information should be stated
by counsel below his signature? (PIRMA)

A.
1)

His §.ddress which should not be a post-office
box.

2)

His PTR official receipt number for the current
year.

3)

His !BP official receipt number for the current
year.

4)

His roll number.

5)

Number and date of issue of his MCLE Certificate
of Compliance or Certificate of Exemption for
the current or immediately preceding compliance
period. (SC Resolution dated 17 February 2015).

272
J9JC9B0M

RULE 7
Parts Of A Pleading

~

6) . In papers and pleadings filed with the SC,
the counsel should indicate his contact details:
e.g., phone number, fax number, cell phone
number, or email address. (A.M. No. 07-6-5SC, 10 July 2007).
Q.

What is the effect if the counsel fails to state
below his signature Nos. 1 to 4 above?

A.

The pleading is considered as not having been
signed.

Q.

What is the effect if the counsel fails to indicate
in his pleading the number and date of issue of
his MCLE Certificate of Compliance or Certificate
of Exemption for the current or immediately
preceding compliance period?

A.

Failure to disclose the required MCLE information
pursuant to SC Resolution dated 17 February 2015
would subject the counsel to appropriate penalty and
disciplinary action but would no longer cause the
dismissal of the case and the expunction of the
pleadings from the records. The non-compliant lawyer
shall be discharged from the case and the client shall
be allowed to secure the services of a new counsel
with the concomitant right to demand the return of
fees already paid to the non-compliant lawyer.

Q.

Is a prosecutor required to indicate in the
information the number and date of issue of his
MCLE Compliance Certificate? May the court
dismiss the information in case of failure to
doso?

A.

Yes the prosecutor is required to do so since an
information is a pleading. Nonetheless the court
should not dismiss the information but simply

273
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

require the investigating prosecutor to indicate
the required information. (People v. Arrojado, 9
November 2015, Peralta, J.).
Q.

Give the rules regarding the inclusion of the
parties' names in the pleadings.

A.
1) The names of all the parties should be included
in the original complaint. In subsequent pleadings,
it is sufficient if the name of the first party on
each side be stated with an appropriate
indication when there are other parties, such as
by using the word, "et al." (S1 R7). The names
of all the parties in an appeal shall also be
indicated in the notice of appeal and record on
appeal. (S5 & 6 R41 ).
2)

In a class suit, it is sufficient if the names of
those appearing in the complaint as plaintiffs or
in the answer as defendants be sufficiently
numerous and representative as to fully protect
the interests of all concerned. (S12 R3).

3) Whenever the identity or name of a defendant is
unknown, he may be sued as the unknown
owner, heir, devisee, or by such other
designation as the case may require. When his
identity or true name is discovered, the pleading
must be amended accordingly. (S14 R3).
4) When two or more persons not organized as an
entity with juridical personality enter into a
transaction, they may be sued under the name
by which they are generally or commonly
known. In the answer of such defendant, the

274

J9JC9B0M

RULE 7
Parts Of A Pleading

names and addresses of the persons composing
said entity must all be revealed. (S15 R3).

Q.

May a court adjudge a defendant liable for
P1 ,000,000 where the specific amount prayed
for in the complaint is only PS00,000 and there
is no general prayer for such further or other
relief as may be deemed just or equitable?

A.

Yes, provided the evidence so warrants and the
defendant fails to object to the introduction of
evidence on the additional P200,000. In such a
case the plaintiff shall pay the additional filing fee
on the P200,000 which shall constitute a lien on the
judgment award. (S5 R10, S2 R141).
Note however that a judgment rendered
against a party in default cannot exceed the
amount nor be different in kind than that prayed for.
(S3[d] R9).

Q.

May the court in its final judgment award a claim
not alleged, or a relief different from, or more
that that claimed in the pleading?

A

Yes. (S2 R141). Of course, the evidence on record
should so warrant and the provisions of S5 R 10
should be taken into account. The docket fees on
such award shall constitute a lien on the judgment.
(S2 R141).

Q.

What is the rule regardingthe signing of pleadings?

A.

Every pleading and other written submission to the
court must be signed by the party or counsel
representing him. (S3 R7).

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

Q.

The OSG in behalf of the Republic filed a
complaint in the RTC for the revocation of titles
registered in the name of Kenrick Development
Corporation (KDC). KDC filed an answer which
was purportedly signed by its counsel, Atty. G.
The trial of the case was held up by various pretrial and discovery issues. Two years later, Atty.
G, who by then was no longer KDC's counsel,
was summoned in a congressional hearing on
fake land titles. He testified that he prepared
KDC's answer and sent an unsigned draft to
KDC's president. He testified that the signature
appearing above his name in the answer was
not his, that he did not authorize any one to
sign in his behalf, and he did not know who
signed above his name. The Republic filed a
motion to declare KDC in default for failure to
file a valid answer. The RTC granted the motion,
declared KDC in default, and allowed the
Republic to present its evidence ex parte. On
appeal, the CA reversed the RTC, saying that
Atty. G assented to the filing of the answer in
his behalf as he never disowned the answer and
resumed acting as counsel for KDC after its
filing. Did the CA err?

A.

Yes. S3 R7 is quite clear when it requires that a
pleading must be signed by the party or counsel
representing him. Hence only the signature of
either the party himself or his counsel operates to
validly convert a pleading from one that is unsigned
to one that is signed.
Counsel's authority to sign a pleading is
personal to him and may be delegated only to
another lawyer pursuant to Rule 9.01 of the Code
of Professional Responsibility. Hence Atty. G's
276

RULE 7
Parts Of A Pleading

blanket authority, whether express or implied, for
just anyone to sign was void.
The answer being unsigned, it produced no
legal effect and thus Republic v. Kenrick Development
Corporation KOC was properly declared in default.
(, G.R. 149576, 8 August 2006, Corona, J.).
(Note: The court in its discretion may allow the
defect of an unsigned pleading to be remedied if
the failure to sign was inadvertent and not intended
to delay. Here it appears that the filing of the
spuriously signed answer was not inadvertent.)
Q.

What is the significance of counsel's signature
on a pleading?

A.
The signature of counsel constitutes a
certificate by him that he has read the pleading and
document; that to the best of his knowledge,
information, and belief, formed after an inquiry
reasonable under the circumstances:
1)

It is not being presented for any improper
purpose, such as to harass, cause
unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase
the cost of litigation;

2)

The claims, defenses, and other legal
contentions are warranted by existing law or
jurisprudence, or by a non-frivolous argument
for extending, modifying, or reversing
existing jurisprudence;

3) The factual contentions have evidentiary
support or, if specifically so identified, will
likely have evidentiary support after availment
277

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

of the modes of discovery under these
rules; and
4) The denials of factual contentions are
warranted on the evidence or, if specifically
so identified, are reasonably based on
belief or a lack of information. (S3[b] R? as
amended by the 2020 Rules on Civil
Procedure).

Q.

What is the consequence if there is a violation
of S3(b) R7?

A.

If the court determines, on motion or motu proprio
and after notice and hearing, that this rule has been
violated, it may impose an appropriate sanction or
refer such violation to the proper office for
disciplinary action, on any attorney, law firm, or party
that violated the rule, or is responsible for the
violation. Absent exceptional circumstances, a law
firm shall be held jointly and severally liable for a
violation committed by its partner, associate, or
employee. The sanction may include, but not limited
to, non-monetary directives or sanctions; an order to
pay a penalty in court; or, if imposed on motion and
warranted for effective deterrence, an order directing
payment to the movant of part or all of the
reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses
directly resulting from the violation, including
attorney's fees for the filing of motion for sanction.
The lawyer or law firm cannot pass on the monetary
penalty to the client. (S3[c] R7, 2020 Rules on
Civil Procedure).

Q.

Is it required that a pleading be under oath,
verified or accompanied by affidavit?

278

RULE 7
Parts Of A Pleading

A.

Except when otherwise specifically required by law
or rule, pleadings need not be under oath, verified
or accompanied by affidavit. (S4 R?).

Q.

How is a pleading verified?

A.

A pleading is verified by an affidavit of an affiant
duly authorized to sign said verification. The
authorization of the affiant to act on behalf of a
party, whether in the form of a secretary's certificate
or a special power of attorney, should be attached
to the pleading, and shall allege the following
attestations:
(a) The allegations in the pleading are true and
correct based on his personal knowledge, or
based on authentic documents;
(b) The pleading is not filed to harass, cause
unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the
cost of litigation; and
(c) The factual allegations therein have evidentiary
support or, if specifically so identified, will
likewise have evidentiary support after a
reasonable opportunity for discovery.
The signature of the affiant shall further serve
as a certification of the truthfulness of the
allegations in the pleading. (S4 R?, 2020 Rules of
Civil Procedure).33

33
The wordings of the amendments to 84 R7 seem to indicate that
attestations (a), (b), and (c) should be alleged in the authorization, i.e., the
secretary's certificate or the special power of attorney. It is submitted that 84 R7
should be read as requiring the attestations to be made in the verification itself,
not in the authorization of the affiant to act on behalf of a party.

279
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

Who may make a verification?

A.

A verification may be made by the party, his lawyer
or his representative, or any person who personally
knows the truth of the facts alleged in the pleading.
(Tanjuatco v. Judge Gako, A.M. No. RTJ-06-2016,
23 March 2009). If made by a person other than
the party, such person's authority to sign the
verification, whether in the form of a secretary's
certicate or special power of attorney, should be
attached to the pleading. (S4 R7).

Q.

What would be the effect if a pleading required
to be verified is not verified or lacks a proper
verification?

A.

A pleading required to be verified which is not
verified or lacks a proper verification, as in those
containing a verification based on "information and
belief," or upon "knowledge, information and belief,"
shall be treated as an unsigned pleading. (S4 R7).
An unsigned pleading produces no legal effect.
However the court may, in its discretion, allow such
deficiency to be remedied if it shall appear that the
same was due to mere inadvertence and not
intended for delay. In practice the Supreme Court
has been strict with the requirement for verification
in petitions filed before it.

Q.

What pleadings or papers are required to be
verified?

A.

The following pleadings or papers are required to
be verified:
1) Petition for relief from judgment (S3 R38).
2) Petition for review on certiorari (S1 R45).

Certification against forum shopping (CFS)
Q.

What is forum shopping? (06 Bar Q3.1)

A.

The act of a party who as a result of an adverse
opinion in one forum, seeks a favorable opinion

282

RULE 7
Parts Of A Pleading

(other than by appeal or certiorari) in another, or
who institutes two or more actions or proceedings
grounded on the same cause, on the gamble that
one or the other court would make a favorable
disposition. (City of Cebu v. Del Rosario, G.R. No.
169341, 22 November 2006).
Q.

Why is forum shopping prohibited?

A.

Forum shopping is prohibited because of the
vexation caused the courts and parties-litigants by
a party who asks different courts or administrative
agencies to rule on the same or related causes or
to grant the same or substantially the same relief, in
the process creating the possibility of conflicting
decisions being rendered by the different fora upon
the same issues. (Municipality of Taguig v. Court of
Appeals, 469 SCRA 588 [2005]).

Q.

What is the test for determining whether a party
violates the rule against forum shopping?

A.

The test for determining whether a party violates
the rule against forum shopping is to ask whether a
final judgment in one case will amount to res
judicata in the action under consideration or
whether the elements of litis pendentia are present.
If the answer is yes, there is forum-shopping.
(Marcopper Mining Corp. v. Solidbank Corp., 432
SCRA 360).

Q.

X was driving the dump truck of Y along Cattleya
Street in Sta. Maria, Bulacan. Due to his
negligence, X hit and injured V who was crossing
the street. Lawyer L, who witnessed the incident,
offered his legal services to V. V, who suffered
physical injuries including a fractured wrist bone,
underwent surgery to screw a metal plate to his
283

wrist bone. On complaint of V, a criminal case for
Reckless Imprudence
Resulting
in Serious
Physical injuries was filed against X before the
Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Sta. Maria. Atty. L,
the private prosecutor, did not reserve the filing
of a separate civil action. V subsequently filed a
complaint for Damages against X and Y before
the Regional Trial Court of Pangasinan in
Urdaneta where he resides. In his "Certification
Against Forum Shopping," V made no mention of
the pendency of the criminal case in Sta. Maria.
a)

Is V guilty of forum shopping?

XXX (10 Bar Q4e).

A.
a)

Vis not guilty of forum-shopping.

The Supreme Court has held that the test to
determine whether there is forum-shopping is
whether the second action may be barred by res
judicata or lis pendens.
Here the second action is one for physical
injuries and is thus an independent civil action
separate and distinct from and which shall proceed
independently of the criminal action for reckless
imprudence (Art 33, Civil Code; S3 R111 ). Hence
there is no res judicata or lis pendens and thus no
forum-shopping.
Q.

What is a certification against forum shopping?

A.

It is a certification under oath by the plaintiff or
principal party in the complaint or other initiatory
pleading asserting a claim for relief or in a sworn

284

J9JC9B0M

RULE 7
Parts Of A Pleading

certification annexed thereto and simultaneously
filed therewith, stating that: (CPR)
(a) he has not theretofore commenced any action
or filed any claim involving the same issues in
any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency;
(b)

to the best of his knowledge, no such other
34
action or claim is pending therein; if there is
such other pending action or claim, a complete
statement of the present status thereof; and

(c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or
similar action or claim 35 has been filed or is
pending, he shall report that fact within 5 days
therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid
complaint or initiatory pleading has been filed. 36
The authorization of the affiant to act on behalf
of a party, whether in the form of a secretary's
certificate or a special power of attorney, should be
attached to the pleading. 37

Q.

P filed a complaint against D for collection of
sum of money. No certification against forum
shopping was contained or annexed to the
complaint. D filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint on the ground of failure to comply
3

4whether or not initiated by the affiant.
Although S5 R7 uses the phrase "involving the same issues" and "same
or similar action or claim," the Supreme Court has held that the requirement of
disclosure applies only to actions or claims involving the same cause of action.
36
1 have recast somewhat the arrangement of the tenor of the certification
into what I think is a more logical arrangement of (a) non-commencement, (b)
non-pendency; and (c) reporting.
37
This paragraph was added in the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure. It
should be read as applying to the situation where the plaintiff or principal party is
a juridical person. If the party is a natural person, he should be the one to
execute the certificate himself. Unlike a verification, the certificate against forum
shopping cannot be made by a counsel or representative, unless there are
justifiable reasons.

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

with S5 R7. P filed an amended complaint to
which is now annexed the certification against
forum shopping. Should D's motion to dismiss
be granted?

A.

Yes. Failure to comply with the requirements under
the first paragraph of S5 R? shall be cause for the
dismissal of the complaint without prejudice, unless
otherwise provided. The failure to comply with the
requirements of S5 R? re the filing of a certification
against forum shopping shall not be curable
by mere amendment of the complaint or other
initiatory pleading.

Q.

If P's complaint is dismissed, what is the
remedy or recourse available to P?

A.

P has two options which he can consider. P may
simply refile the complaint and annex thereto the
certification against forum shopping. This is because
the dismissal for failure to comply with the
requirement of annexing a sworn certification against
forum shopping is a dismissal without prejudice.
P may also file a special civil action for
certiorari in order to set aside the dismissal order if
P feels that the order was made with grave abuse
of discretion amounting to lack of or excess
of jurisdiction.

Appeal is not available to P as an appeal may
not be taken from an order dismissing an action
without prejudice. (S1 R41 ).
Q.

Is the submission of a false certification against
forum shopping a ground for summary dismissal
with prejudice?

286

RULE 7
Parts Of A Pleading

A.

No. A violation of S5 R7 - other than through willful
and deliberate forum shopping - does not authorize
the court to dismiss a case without motion and
hearing. Even the submission of a false certification of
non-forum shopping does not automatically warrant
dismissal of the case, even if it might constitute
contempt of court. (De Leon v. Chu, 2 Septembe~
2015). There must be motion and hearing.

Q.

When would a dismissal for the violation of S5
R7 b~ with prejudice?

A.

If the dismissal order so provides or if the acts of
the party or his counsel clearly constitute willful and
deliberate forum shopping. (S5 R7).

Q.

Juan filed with the Makati RTC a petition for
custody against his wife Michelle praying for
joint custody or visitation rights over his two
daughters then in the custody of Michelle.
Michelle filed her motion to admit answer with
motion for issuance of protection order. The
Makati RTC denied Michelle's motion to admit
answer. Subsequently Michelle withdrew her
motion for issuance of protection order. Michelle
then filed with the Muntinlupa RTC a petition for
temporary and permanent protection order
under the provisions of R.A. No. 9262. Juan
argues that the Muntinlupa case should be
dismissed on the ground of forum shopping.
Michelle counters that she cannot be guilty of
forum-shopping since she was the respondent
in the Makati case. Is Michelle guilty of
forum-shopping?

A.

Yes. The fact that Michelle was not the plaintiff or
petitioner in the first case does not detract from the

287
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

charge of forurn-shopping if she asked for the same
reliefs in both cases. In both cases, she asked for
the same relief of a protection order. Hence the
second case should be dismissed on the ground of
forum-shopping and/or lis pendens. While there was
a withdrawal by Michelle of her motion for
protection order in the Makati case, it should be
noted that such withdrawal was made after her
motion was in effect denied by the Makati RTC.
This clearly smacks of forum-shopping. (BrownAraneta v. Araneta, 9 October 2013, Velasco, J.).
Q.

A petition for review was filed with the Court of
Appeals. The verification and CFS attached
thereto however lacked the notarial seal although
the notary public's signature and stamp were
present. Shall this be a cause for the dismissal
of the petition?

A.

No. The verification and CFS were in fact submitted.
An examination of these documents shows that the
notary public's signature and stamp were duly
affixed. Except for the notarial seal, all the
requirements for the verification and certification
documents were complied with. Hence there was
substantial compliance with the requirements on
the verification and certification against forum
shopping. (Regulus Dev't Inc. v. Dela Cruz, 25
January 2016, Brion, J.).

Q.

Petitioners are husband and wife. They filed a
petition for certiorari and mandamus before the
Court of Appeals but only the husband signed
the CFS. Is the husband's signature sufficient?

A.

Yes, the husband's signature alone is sufficient
compliance with the rule on certification against

288

J9JC9B0M

RULE 7
Parts Of A Pleading

forum shopping. (Sps. Dar v. Alonzo-Legasto, 30
Aug 2000).
Q.

May counsel for a party sign the CFS?

A.

As a general rule no. The CFS needs to be signed
by the party himself since he is in the best position
to state the matters therein. Exception would be the
case wherein the party is a juridical person in which
case the lawyer could sign. The lawyer must however
be specially authorized by a board resolution. (BP/
Leasing Corp v. CA, 18 November 2003). If for
reasonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader
is unable to sign, he must execute a Special Power
of Attorney designating his counsel of record to
sign on his behalf. (Jacinto v. Gumaru, 2 June
2014, Del Castillo, J.).

Q.

May an attorney-in-fact, who was authorized to
prosecute a suit on behalf of the principal, sign
the CFS in behalf of the principal?

A.

As a general rule, no. The reason is that it is the
party himself who is in the best position to state the
matters required in a CFS, particularly, whether
actions or claims involving the same issues have
been filed or are pending. However for justifiable
reasons, the attorney-in-fact may be the one to sign
the CFS, as for instance, where the attorney-in-fact
is himself a party to the case and shares a common
interest with the other parties (Bandillion v. La
Filipina Uygongco Corporation, 16 September
2015, Peralta, J.) or where the party is not residing
in the Philippines (Wee v. Galvez, 11 August 2004,
Quisumbing, J.).

289

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

Respondent, a resident of the United States,
executed an SPA appointing her daughter,
Grace Galvez, to act as her attorney-in-fact in
the Philippines. The Special Power of Attorney
authorizes Grace Galvez to do the following:
1) To ask, demand and claim any sum of money
that is duly [due] from any person natural,
juridical and/or corporation in the Philippines;
2) To file criminal and/or civil complaints before
the courts of justice in the Philippines to
enforce my rights and interest[s];
3) To attend hearings and/or Preliminary
Conference[s], to make stipulations, adjust
claims, to settle and/or enter into Compromise
Agreement[s], to litigate and to terminate
such proceedings; [and]
4) To sign all papers, documents and pleadings
necessary for the accomplishment of the
above purposes
Is this sufficient authority for Grace Galvez
to sign the CFS in behalf of the Respondent?

A.

Yes. Grace Galvez, as attorney-in-fact of the
respondent, was duly authorized and empowered
not just to initiate complaints, whether criminal or
civil, to enforce and protect the respondent's rights,
claims, and interests in this jurisdiction, but
is specifically authorized to sign all "papers,
documents, and pleadings" necessarily connected
with the filing of a complaint. The aforementioned
papers and documents, which Grace Galvez was
authorized and empowered to sign, must necessarily
include the CFS. (Wee v. Galvez, supra).

RULE 7
Parts Of A Pleading

Q.

RC filed a complaint for the annulment of
foreclosure sale against Bank V. In its answer,
Bank V set up a counterclaim for actual
damages and litigation expenses. RC filed a
motion to dismiss the counterclaim on the
ground that Bank V's answer with counterclaim
was not accompanied by a certification against
forum shopping. Rule. (07 Bar Q10a).

A.

I would rule for the denial of the motion to dismiss.
The Supreme Court has held that a certification
against forum shopping is not required for asserting
a compulsory counterclaim since it is not an
initiatory pleading or incipient application but merely
auxiliary to the main proceeding. (Sps. Ponciano v.
Parente/a, 9 May 2000; Spouses Carpio v. Rural
Bank of Sto. Tomas, G.R. 153171, 4 May 2006).
Here the counterclaim is for actual damages
and litigation expenses and thus compulsory since
it arose out of the transaction or occurrence which
is the subject matter of RC's complaint. Hence the
38
motion to dismiss should be denied.

Q.

The NLRC rendered a decision against Fr.
Tabora, the Ateneo de Naga University, and
Edwin Bernal (the Petitioners). The Petitioners
filed a petition under Rule 65 seeking the
reversal of the NLRC decision. The verification
and the certification against forum shopping
(CFS) was however signed only by Fr. Tabora.
The CA dismissed the Petition insofar

38
The bar question does not indubitably indicate that the counterclaim for
actual damages is compulsory. It may be inferred however that the examiner
considered such counterclaim as compulsory, especially since the question was
based on the case of Spouses Carpio v. Rural Bank of Sto. Tomas, supra, which
involved an answer with compulsory counterclaims.

291
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

as the Ateneo and Bernal were concerned,
notwithstanding a belated showing that Fr.
Tabora had been authorized to sign the
verification and CFS for the Ateneo and Bernal.
Was the dismissal proper?

A.

No. In verification, the signature of one instead of
all the parties would be sufficient if there is
showing that he had sufficient knowledge and
belief to sign the verification. As regards the CFS
requirement, there was substantial compliance
with the submission, albeit delayed, of proof that
Fr. Tabora had been authorized to sign the CFS
for the Ateneo and Bernal. The SC considered
the delay a mere technicality or procedural
imperfection which should not defeat the ends of
justice. (Ateneo de Naga University v. Manalo, 9
May 2005). Doctrine reiterated in China Banking
Corporation v. Mondragon International Phils, 17
November 2005, re belated proof of authority of
corporate signatory to CFS.

Q.

The verification and the certification against
forum shopping appended to the appeal to the
NLRC were signed by BPl's Assistant VicePresident. There was no proof however that the
AVP was authorized by the corporation's board.
Are the verification and the certification against
forum shopping fatally defective?

A.

No. The AVP as a corporate officer has implied or
apparent authority to sign the verification and CFS.
An express authorization is not an indispensable
requirement. The fact that BPI acquiesced and
expressed no objection to the appeal by before the
NLRC is proof that it authorized the AVP to sign the

292

J9JC9B0M

RULE7
Parts Of A Pleading

verification and the CFS. (Enriquez v. BPI, G.R.
172812, 12 February 2008).

Q.

Who are corporate officers or employees who may
sign the verification and certification against forum
shopping without need of a board resolution?

A.

(1) Chairperson of the board of directors, (2) the
President, (3) General Manager or acting General
Manager, (4) Personnel Officer, and (5) Employment
Specialist in a labor case. The rationale for this list
is that these officers are in a position to verify the
truth and correctness of the allegations in the
complaint or petition. (Cagayan Valley Drug Corp.
v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No.
151413, 13 February 2008). The Vice-President and
Assistant Vice-President may be added to the
list. (Enriquez v. BPI, G.R. No. 172812, 12
February 2008).

Q.

Korean Airlines (KAL), a foreign corporation
licensed to do business in the Philippines filed
a collection case against Expert Travel and
Tours Inc. The verification and CFS was signed
by its counsel and resident agent X. To the
motion to dismiss filed by ETI, KAL countered
that X was authorized by KAL in a teleconference
by the Board of Directors. No record of such
authorization was attached to the complaint.
Can the resident agent sign the verification and
CFS in behalf of a foreign corporation?

A.

No. X was not specifically authorized to execute the
certification in behalf of KAL. Being a resident agent
does not mean that he is authorized to execute the
requisite CFS because while he may be aware of
actions filed against his principal, he may not be

293

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

aware of actions initiated by his principal whether in
the Philippines or in the country where such foreign
corp. is organized. (Expertravel and Tours Inc. v.
CA, 26 May 2005)

Q.

The notarial certificate of the Verificationf
Certification of Non-Forum Shopping attached
to private respondents' petition before the CA
did not state whether they presented competent
evidence of their identities, or that they were
personally known to the notary public. Should
the petition be dismissed?

A.

Yes. Under Section 6, Rule II of A.M. No. 02-8-1 3SC dated July 6, 2004, entitled the "2004 Rules on
Notarial Practice" (2004 Rules on Notarial Practice),
a jurat refers to an act in which an individual on a
single occasion appears before the Notary Public
and is personally known to the notary public or
identified by the notary public through competent
evidence of identity as defined by the Rules. Hence
the Verification and CFS are fatally defective
for failure to comply with the said Rules. (William
Go Que Construction v. Singson, 19 April 2016,
Perlas-Bernabe, J.).

Q.

In the proceedings for the settlement of the testate
estate of Alice, a contingent money claim for
commission in the event of the sale of properties
of the estate was filed by Alan with the probate
court. The executrix moved for the dismissal of the
claim on the ground that no certification against
forum shopping was attached thereto pursuant
to S5 R7. The RTC dismissed the money claim.
Was the dismissal proper ?

294
J9JC9B0M

RULE 7
Parts Of A Pleading

A.

No. A certification against forum shopping is
required only for complaints and other initiatory
pleadings. A money claim against the estate is not
an initiatory pleading since the probate proceeding
was already inititated upon the filing of the petition
for the allowance of the decedent's will. A money
claim does not initiate new litigation but merely
brings a material but incidental matter arising in the
progress of a case. Hence a money claim is only
incidental to the probate proceeding, moreso if it is
contingent since the claimant cannot even institute
a separate action for a mere contingent claim.
(Sheker v. Estate of Sheker, G.R. No. 157912, 13
December 2007).

Q.

Metrobank extrajudicially foreclosed on a real
estate mortgage and purchased the realty at the
auction sale. Since the mortgagor refused to
vacate the realty, Metrobank filed an ex parte
petition for writ of possession over the
foreclosed property, pursuant to Act No. 3135.
The mortgagor, who was allowed by the court to
intervene, filed a motion to dismiss the petition
on the ground that a false CFS was attached
since it did not disclose cases filed by the
mortgagor involving the same parties and the
loan agreement secured by the mortgage.
a) Should the motion to dismiss be granted?
b) If the motion to dismiss is granted, what is
the remedy of Metrobank?

A.
a)

No. While denominated as a petition for writ of
possession, it is not an initiatory pleading since
under Section 7 of Act No. 3135, such petition
295

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

is filed in the form of an ex parte motion. In
other words, the petition for writ of possession
is in substance merely a motion. Hence dismissal
of the petition on the ground of submission of a
false CFS is unwarranted since in the first place
a CFS is not even required. (Metrobank v. Abad
Santos, 15 December 2009).
b)

The remedy of Metrobank is to file with the
Court of Appeals a special civil action for
certiorari unless the dismissal provided that it is
with prejudice. Appeal is not available since a
dismissal for failure to comply with S5 R7 is
without prejudice and thus it is certiorari under
R65 which should be availed of. (S1[g] R41).39
If the dismissal provided that it is with prejudice,
then appeal would be proper.

Q.

Does a petition for writ of possession in favor of
the buyer in local tax delinquency sale require a
certification against forum shopping?

A.

No, since such petition is not an initiatory pleading.
(De Guzman v. Chico, 7 Dec 2016, Jardeleza, J.).

Q.

Give in capsule form, the jurisprudential
pronouncements respecting noncompliance with
the requirements on, or submission of defective,
verification and certification.

39
1n Metrobank v. Abad, 15 December 2009, the SC said that appeal was
the proper remedy, although it allowed the special civil action for certiorari filed
by Metrobank because of exceptional circumstances. The SC overlooked that
certiorari really was the proper remedy since dismissal under S5 R7, unless
otherwise provided or unless because of willful and deliberate forum-shopping, is
without prejudice.

296

RULE 7
Parts Of A Pleading

A.
1) A distinction must be made between noncompliance with the requirement on or submission
of defective verification, and non-compliance with
the requirement on or submission of defective
certification against forum shopping.
2)

As to verification, non-compliance therewith or
a defect therein does not necessarily render the
pleading fatally defective. The court may order
its submission or correction or act on the
pleading if the attending circumstances are
such that strict compliance with the Rule may
be dispensed with in order that the ends of
justice may be served thereby.

3)

Verification is deemed substantially complied
with when one who has ample knowledge to
swear to the truth of the allegations in the
complaint or petition signs the verification, and
when matters alleged in the petition have been
made in good faith or are true and correct.

4)

As to certification against forum shopping, noncompliance therewith or a defect therein, unlike
in verification, is generally not curable by its
subsequent submission or correction thereof,
unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the
ground of "substantial compliance" or presence
of "special circumstances or compelling reasons."

5)

The certification against forum shopping must
be signed by all the plaintiffs or petitioners in a
case; otherwise, those who did not sign will
be dropped as parties to the case. Under
reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however,
297

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a
common interest and invoke a common cause
of action or defense, the signature of only one
of them in the certification against forum
shopping substantially complies with the Rule.
6)

Finally, the certification against forum shopping
must be executed by the party-pleader, not by
his counsel. If, however, for reasonable or
justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable
to sign, he must execute a Special Power of
Attorney designating his counsel of record to
sign on his behalf. (Jacinto v. Gumaru, 2 June
2014, Del Castillo, J.).

Q.

What are the contents of a pleading stating a
party's claims or defenses?

A.

Every pleading stating a party's claims or defenses
shall in addition to those mandated by S2 R?, state
the fo!!owing:
a)

Names of witnesses who will be presented to
prove a party's claim or defense;

b)

Summary of the witnesses' intended testimonies,
provided that the judicial affidavits of said
witnesses shall be attached to the pleading and
form an integral part thereof. Only witnesses
whose judicial affidavits are attached to the
pleading shall be presented by the parties
during trial. Except if a party presents meritorious
reasons as basis for the admission of additional
witnesses, no other witness or affidavit shall be
heard or admitted by the court; and

298

RULE 7
Parts Of A Pleading

c)

Documentary and object evidence in support of
the allegations contained in the pleading. (S6
R7, emphasis supplied).40

Q.

Explain the purpose and significance of S6 R7.

A.

S6 R7 is intended to expedite the trial of cases by
compelling the parties to be ready with their
testimonial evidence before they file their pleadings
stating their claims or defenses, i.e, all pleadings
except the reply and the rejoinder.
It provides that such pleadings shall state the
names of witnesses who will be presented to prove
a party's claim or defense; a summary of the
witnesses' intended testimonies, provided that the
judicial affidavits of said witnesses shall be
attached to the pleading and form an integral part
thereof. Only witnesses whose judicial affidavits are
attached to the pleading shall be presented by the
parties during trial. Except if a party presents
meritorious reasons as basis for the admission of
additional witnesses, no other witness or affidavit
shall be heard or admitted by the court.
Examples of meritorious reasons are:
1) The witness is an adverse, hostile, or unwilling
witness.
2)

40

Despite the exercise of due diligence, the
proponent could not have discovered the
witness or procured his judicial affidavit prior to
the filing of the pleading.

S6 R7 is a new provision added in the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure.

3)

Testimony of a witness on rebuttal.

Note that the preclusive effect does not apply
to documentary and object evidence. The reason
could be that it would already be imposing undue
hardship on the pleader if he is also required to be
ready with such evidence at the time of the filing
of the pleading.

RULE 8. MANNER OF MAKING
ALLEGATIONS IN PLEADINGS
Q.

What are ultimate facts?

A.

The facts essential to a claim or defense. A fact is
essential if it cannot be stricken out without leaving
the statement of the cause of action or the
defense insufficient.

Q.

How shall the ultimate facts be stated in a
pleading?

A.

Every pleading shall contain in a methodical and
logical form, a plain, concise and direct statement
of the ultimate facts, including the evidence on
which the party pleading relies for his claim or
defense, as the case may be. If a cause of action or
defense relied on is based on law, the pertinent
provisions thereof and their applicability to him shall
be clearly and concisely stated.41

Q.

How may alternative
defenses be pleaded?

A.

A party may set forth two or more statements of a
claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically,
either in one cause of action or defense or in
separate causes of action or defenses. (S2 R2).

Q.

In alternative causes of action or defense, what
is the effect of the insufficiency of one of the
alternatives?

A.

In such a case, as long as one of the alternative
statements, if made independently, would be

sufficient, the pleading is not rendered insufficient
by the insufficiency of the other alternative. (Id.).

Q.

In pleading alternative causes of action or
defenses, is it required that the causes of action
or defenses be consistent with each other?

A.

No. The causes of action or defenses alleged may
be inconsistent with each other, provided that each
cause of action or defense be consistent in itself.
(Bac/ayon v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 89132, 26
February 1990).

Q.

Plaintiff sued defendant for collection of P1
million based on the latter's promissory note.
The complaint alleges, among others:
1)

Defendant borrowed P1 million from
plaintiff as evidenced by a duly executed
promissory note;

2)

The promissory note reads:

"Makati, Philippines
Dec.30,2014
For value received from plaintiff, defendant
promises to pay plaintiff P1 million, twelve (12)
months from the above indicated date without
necessity of demand.
Signed
Defendant"
A copy of the promissory note is attached
as Annex "A."

Defendant, in his verified answer, alleged
among others:

302
J9JC9B0M

RULE 8
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

1) Defendant specifically denies the allegation
in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the complaint, the
truth being defendant did not execute any
promissory note in favor of plaintiff, or
2)

Defendant has paid the P1 million claimed
in the promissory note (Annex "A"
of the Complaint) as evidenced by an
"Acknowledgment Receipt" duly executed
by plaintiff on January 30, 2015 in Manila
with his spouse signing as witness.

A copy of the "Acknowledgment Receipt" is
attached as Annex "1" hereof.
Plaintiff filed a motion for judgment on the
pleadings on the ground that defendant's answer
failed to tender an issue as the allegations
therein on his defenses are sham for being
inconsistent; hence, no defense at all. Defendant
filed an opposition claiming his answer tendered
an issue. Is judgment on the pleadings proper?
(15 Bar Q7a)
A.

No, judgment on the pleadings is not proper.
Under Section 2 of Rule 8, a party may set forth two
or more statements of a defense alternatively or
hypothetically. The Supreme Court has held that
inconsistent defenses may be pleaded alternatively
or hypothetically, provided that each defense is
consistent with itself. (Bac/ayon v. Court of Appeals,
26 February 1990).
Hence Plaintiff's contention that defendant's
answer failed to tender an issue as his defenses
are sham for being inconsistent is without merit.

Q.

In an action to recover a parcel of land, the
intervenors claimed to be the absolute owners
thereof and asked that they be placed in
possession of the property, but defendants
maintained that they had absolute title on the
land and filed a counterclaim for injunction
against plaintiffs and intervenors. Judgment was
rendered for the defendants. In a subsequent
action, the intervenors claimed from the
defendants the expenses they had incurred in
clearing and cultivating the parcel of land and
planting coconut and other fruit-bearing trees
thereon. The defendants in their answer pleaded
that the plaintiff's claim was a compulsory
counterclaim that should have been set up in the
former action as against the counterclaim for
injunction filed by the defendants. The plaintiffs
replied that they could not have set up in the
former case such counterclaim for improvements
because it 'vvould have been inconsistent with
and would have weakened their claim for title to
the land. Is the plaintiff's contention meritorious?

A.

No. Under S2 R8 "[a] party may set forth two or
more statements of a claim or defense alternatively
or hypothetically, either in one cause of action or
defense or in separate causes of action or
defenses." Hence the plaintiff and intervenors in the
former case could have set up the claim that they
were entitled to the parcel of land and alternatively
that assuming hypothetically that they were not
entitled to the land, at least they are entitled as
possessors in good faith to the coconut and other
fruit-bearing trees planted by them in the land and
their fruits or their value. Their failure to set up that

304

RULE 8
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

alternative claim in the former case bars it forever.
(Camara v. Aguilar, 50 O.G. 1549, 12 March 1954).
Q.

Petitioners filed with the CFI of Cebu an action
for recovery of land against the Private
Respondents. The Private Respondents filed an
answer raising the defense of their ownership.
The CFI decided in favor of the Private
Respondents but on appeal the Court of
Appeals reversed and decided in favor of the
Petitioners declaring them as the owners of the
land and ordering the Private Respondents to
vacate the premises. In the body of its decision,
the Court of Appeals stated that there was no
fraud or bad faith on the part of the Private
Respondents. The Court of Appeal's judgment
became final and executory. The Petitioners
moved for the execution of the judgment before
the CFI. This was opposed by the Private
Respondents on the ground that a hearing
supplementary to execution should be conducted
to allow them to present evidence to prove that
they are builders in good faith and to prove the
value of the improvements. The Petitioners
argued that the Private Respondents should
have set up their claim for reimbursement in the
action for recovery. The Court of Appeals allowed
the Private Respondents to present such
evidence, stating that the Private Respondents
could not have presented such evidence in the
trial court since it would be inconsistent with
their defense of ownership. Is the reason cited
by the CA for allowing the Private Respondents
to present evidence tenable?

A.

No. The Court of Appeals' statement that Private
Respondents could not have raised the counterclaim

305
J9JC9B0M

PRiMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

for reimbursement of the value of the improvements
as it would run counter to their defense of
ownership is without merit. Under S2 R8 a party
may set forth two or more statements of a defense
alternatively or hypothetically. Inconsistent defenses
may be pleaded alternatively or hypothetically
provided that each defense is consistent with itself.
Not having been set up, the counterclaim is barred
under S2 R9. (Bac/ayon v. Court of Appeals, G.R.
No. 89132, 26 February 1990).
Q.

Same facts as the previous question.
a)

Should the CFI grant the opposition of the
Private Respondents to Petitioners' motion
for execution?

b)

May the Private Respondents file a separate
action to recover the value of the improvements
introduced by them?

a)

No. Once a decision has become final and
executory, the only jurisdiction left with the
court is to order its execution. To allow the
supplemental hearing would be to amend or
alter a final and executory judgment.

A.

b) No. Under S2 R9, a compulsory counterclaim
not set up is deemed barred. The claim for
reimbursement of the value of the improvements
is in the nature of a compulsory counterclaim
since it is connected with the transaction or
occurrence constituting the subject matter of
the Petitioners' claim. Hence it should have
been set up as a compulsory counterclaim in

42
The second sentence of S4 RB omits "capacity of a party to sue or be
sued," mentioning only "capacity of a party to sue or be sued in a representative
capacity." It is believed that this is simply a drafting oversight. This is apparent
from the use of the word "capacity" when the more appropriate word as may be
gleaned from the first sentence is "authority." There is no good reason why a

Q.

Lirio and Semicon Integrated
Electronics- --Corporation (Semicon) entered into a lease
contract covering Lirio's properties. Villalon,
who was then Semicon's president and chairman
of the board, represented the lessee corporation
in the lease contract. Prior to the expiration of
the lease, Semicon terminated the contract and
allegedly left unpaid rentals, damages, and
interest. Urio demanded payment but Semicon
and Villalon failed to pay.
Lirio thus filed a complaint for sum of money
against Semicon and Villalon. In his complaint,
Lirio alleged that Semicon and Villalon unjustly
preterminated the lease and failed to pay the
unpaid rentals despite demand. Lirio alleged also
in his complaint that "Villalon fraudulently and
surreptitiously removed Semicon's equipment,
merchandise, and other effects from the leased
premises, preventing him to exercise his right,
among others, to take inventories of these
effects, merchandise, and equipment."
Villalon filed a motion to dismiss on the
ground that the complaint failed to state a cause
of action against him. He argued that he is not a
real party-in-interest as he is merely an officer of
Semicon. Villalon further contended that there
was no competent allegation in the complaint
about any supposed wrongdoing on his part to
warrant his inclusion as a party defendant.
The RTC granted Villalon's motion to dismiss.
It held that under the theory of separate corporate
entity, the action should be limited against

party desiring to make an issue as to the adverse party's capacity to sue or be
sued should not do so by way of specific denial.

308

J9JC9B0M

RULE 8
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

Semicon, the lessee; it cannot be expanded
against Villalon, a mere corporate officer.
The Court of Appeals reversed the RTC
holding that the allegation of fraud against
Villalon placed the case within the doctrine of
piercing the veil of corporation fiction and thus
stated a cause of action against Villalon. Did lhe
Court of Appeals correctly reverse the RTC's
dismissal order?
A.

No. S5 RB requires that in all averments of fraud,
the circumstances constituting fraud must be stated
with particularity.
Here Lirio's mere invocation of the words
"surreptitiously and fraudulently" does not make
the allegation particular without specifying the
circumstances
of Villalon's
comm1ss1on and
employment of fraud, and without delineating why it
was fraudulent for him to remove Semicon's
properties in the first place. The allegation of fraud
would have been averred with particularity had Lirio
alleged, for example, that Villalon removed the
equipment under the false pretense that they
needed repair and refurbishing but the equipment
were never returned, or that Villalon removed the
merchandise because Semicon needed to sell them
in exchange for new supplies but no new supplies
were bought. No such allegation was ever made.
Thus, the RTC could not have properly ruled
on whether there was a need to pierce the veil of
corporate entity precisely because the complaint
failed to state with particularity how Villalon
committed and employed fraud. Hence the complaint

309
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER~REVIEWER ON

failed to state a cause of action against Villalon.
(Villalon v. Urio, 3 August 2015).
Q.

The complaint alleged that the defendant acted
in bad faith, arbitrarily, illegally, wrongfully, and
in violation of law. However, it did not contain
any averment of facts showing that defendant's
acts were done in the manner alleged. Does the
complaint state a cause of action? Explain. (96
Bar Q3).

A.

Yes. Malice, intent, knowledge or other condition
of the mind (MIKO) may be averred generally.
(S5 RS).

Q.

How is a judgment or decision pleaded?

A.

In pleading a judgment or decision of a domestic or
foreign court, judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, or of
a board or officer, it is sufficient to aver the
judgment or decision without setting forth matter
showing jurisdiction to render it. An authenticated
copy of the judgment or decision shall be attached
to the pleading. (S6 R8):'

Actionable document
Q.

What is an actionable document?

A.

An actionable document ls a written instrument or
document on which an action or defense is based
upon. (S7 RS).

Q.

Give examples of actionable documents.

A.

P files an action to collect a loan from D. D files an
answer raising the defense of payment. The
promissory note signed by D evidencing the loan is
an actionable document for plaintiff. On the other
310

RULE 8

hand, a receipt showing payment of the loan is an
actionable document for the defendant.
Q.

What is the requirement regarding an actionable
document?

A.

They shall be set forth in the pleading. (S7 RS).

Q.

How is an actionable document set forth in a
pleading?

A.

The substance of the actionable document shall be
set forth in the pleading, and the original or a copy
thereof shall be attached to the pleading as an
exhibit, which shall be deemed to be a part of the
pleading. 43 (S7 RS).

Q.

Should an actionable document be attached to
the pleading? Would a failure to so attach result
in the dismissal of the action?

A.

Yes, the actionable document should be attached
to the pleading as required under S7 RS. However
a failure to so attach or set forth should not result in
the outright dismissal of the complaint. (KeihinEverett Forwarding Co. v. Tokio Marine Malayan
Insurance Co., 28 January 2019, Reyes, J.). The
court should simply order the plaintiff to attach or
set forth the actionable document.

insurer. On appeal, the freight-forwarder contends
that the trial court should not have considered
in evidence the insurance policy, since being an
actionable document, it should have been
attached or set forth in the complaint. Is the
contention correct?
A.

No. Failure to attach/set forth actionable document
does not preclude its subsequent offer in evidence.
There is no specific provision in the Rules of Court
which prohibits the admission in evidence of an
actionable document in the event a party fails to
comply with the requirement of the rule on
actionable documents under S7 RS. (Keihin-Everett
Forwarding Co. v. Tokio Marine Malayan Insurance,
28 January 2019, Reyes, J.).

Q.

If the adverse party wants to contest the
genuineness and due execution of an actionable
document, how shall he do so? (SOS)

A.

The adverse party shall specifically deny under
oath the genuineness and due execution of the
actionable document and set forth what he claims
to be the facts. (S8 RS). Otherwise the genuineness
and due execution of the actionable document shall
be deemed admitted. (Id.).

Q.

What specific facts are deemed included within
the admission by the adverse party of the
genuineness and due execution of an actionable
document? (SAW Deform)

A.

1)

That the party whose signature it bears §,igned it.

2)

That if signed by another, it was signed for the
adverse party and with his §.Uthority.

312

RULE 8
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

3) That at the time it was signed, it was in words
and figures exactly as set out in the pleading of
the party relying upon it.
4)

That the document was duly delivered.

5)

That any formal requisites of law, such as seal,
acknowledgment or revenue stamp which it
lacks, are waived by him. (Hibberd v. Rhode,
32 Phil. 476).

Hence the following defenses, among others, are
barred by the implied admission:

Q.

1)

Forgery.

2)

The agent signing was not authorized
exceeded his authority.

3)

The party signing the document signed it in
some other capacity than that alleged in
the pleading.

4)

That the document was never delivered. (Id.).

5)

Lack of documentary stamps. (Filipinas Textile
Mills Inc. v. State Investment House Inc., 12
November 2003).

P filed an action for collection of loan against D.
P attached to the complaint a copy of the
promissory note evidencing the loan signed by D.
D filed an unsworn answer specifically denying
that he signed the note. After the presentation of

forgetting to formally offer in evidence the
promissory note. The court rendered judgment in

J9JC9B0M

PRiMER-REVIEWER ON

taking into consideration the promissory note
although it was not formally offered in evidence.
44
Is D's assignment of error meritorious?

A.

No. D's failure to specifically deny under oath the
promissory note which was an actionable document
resulted in D's implied admission of its genuineness
and due execution. The same is a judicial admission
and hence does not require proof pursuant
to S4 R129.

Q.

In an action for collection of P2,000,000, plaintiff
bank alleged that defendant Oriental Textile
Mills, Inc., for valuable consideration, executed
in favor of the bank a promissory note for said
amount, a copy of the note being attached to
the complaint. Defendant filed an answer to the
complaint denying liability and alleging that the
signatory Jesus Lim had no authority to
negotiate and obtain a loan in its behalf, nor to
sign the promissory note. The answer was not
verified. During the trial, defendant sought to
introduce evidence to show that Jesus Lim was
not authorized to enter into the transaction and
to sign the promissory note for and in behalf of
the defendant corporation. Plaintiff objected to
such evidence, claiming that Urn's authority had
been admitted by defendant's failure to verify the
answer. The judge sustained the objection. Was
the ruling correct? (91 Bar Q12a ed).

A.

Yes, the judge's ruling sustaining the objection was
correct. The Supreme Court has held that the implied
admission of the actionable document's genuiness
and due execution includes an admission that the
44

Based on Question No. 14 of 1974 Bar.

314

RULE 8
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

agent signing the same was duly authorized by the
adv_erse party. Hence the defense that the agent
signing the same was not authorized by the
principal is barred by the implied admission.
(Hibberd v. Rhode, 32 Phil. 476).
Q.

P purportedly sold a parcel of land to D. Later,
P claimed that what he signed was a document
captioned Lease Contract and not a deed of
sale. P then filed a complaint against D and M,
to whom D sold the property. In their answer, D
and M attached the purported deed of sale. P
did not file a reply specifically denying under
oath the deed of sale. During the trial, can P be
allowed to testify that what he actually signed
was a lease contract and not a deed of sale?

A.

Yes. Failure to deny the genuineness and due
execution of an actionable document does not
preclude a party from arguing against it by evidence
of fraud, mistake, compromise, payment, statute of
limitations, estoppel and want of consideration.
(Acabal v. Acabal, 31 March 2005, Carpio Morales,
J.). Here P's evidence to the effect that what he
actually signed was a lease contract and not a deeel
of sale is evidence of mistake or fraud.

Q.

In his answer to the complaint, Mario Reyes
alleged that he does not owe Norma Alajar any
sum of money, and that he executed the
promissory note only to enable Alajar to show the
same to her husband to explain the disappearance
of the amount from the conjugal funds as Norma
Alajar lost the same in the casino. The answer is
not verified. At the trial, the lawyer of Norma
Alajar objected to the testimony of Mario Reyes
as to his accommodation story because, as the
315

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

answer is not verified, he is deemed to have
admitted the genuineness and due execution of
the promissory note. Decide on the objection with
reasons. (90 Bar Q7)

A.

Objection overruled. Failure to deny the genuineness
and due execution of an actionable document does
not preclude a party from arguing against it by
evidence of want of consideration. (Acabal v.
Acabal, 31 March 2005). Here Mario Reyes's defense
that he was only an accommodation party is a
defense of want of consideration.

Q.

Plaintiff filed an action to recover a parcel of
land against the Defendants. Attached to the
complaint is a copy of the deed of sale executed
by the Defendants' father in favor of the
Plaintiff. The Defendants specifically denied but
not under oath the deed of sale. At the trial of
the case, Defendants sought to present an
expet1 witness to testify that the signature of
the seller in the deed of sale is a forgery.
Plaintiffs objected to the presentation of the
witness saying that the Defendants impliedly
admitted the genuineness and due execution of
the deed of sale when they failed to specifically
deny it under oath. How should the trial court
rule on the objection?

A.

The trial court sl1ouldoverrule the objection. Under
S8 RB the requirement of an oath does not apply
when the adverse party does not appear to be a
party to the instrument. Here the Defendants were
not parties to the deed of sale. (See Toribio v. Bidin,
134 SCRA 162). Note: although the requirement of
an oath does not apply, the adverse party should still

316

RULE 8
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

specifically deny the actionable document and set
forth what he claims to be the facts.
Q.

Pedro filed an action for recovery of land
against Ding. Ding filed an answer in which he
raised the defense that he was the owner of the
land as Pedro's late father, Frondo, had sold the
land to him. Ding attached to his answer a copy
of the deed of sale over the subject land
purportedly executed by Frondo in favor of
Ding. Pedro did not file a reply. During the trial,
may Pedro be allowed to prove over the
relevant objection that his father's signature to
the deed of sale was a forgery?

A.

No. Although the requirement of an oath does not
apply to Pedro since he is not a party to the deed of
sale, nevertheless Pedro should still specifically
deny the actionable document, that is the deed of
sale, and set forth what he claims to be the facts.
Since he failed to do so, Pedro is deemed to
have admitted the genuineness and due execution of
the deed of sale and he is thus precluded from
proving that his father's signature thereon was forged.

Q.

"A" filed suit against "B" and "C" for the recovery
of personal property which, according to the
complaint had been sold to him by the defendants'
father during the latter's lifetime under a document
entitled Bill of Sale, the substance of the bill was
pleaded in the complaint, and a copy thereof was
attached to the complaint as an exhibit. "B" and
"C" filed an answer which disclaimed knowledge
or information about the Bill of Sale and averred
that the signature thereon allegedly belonging to
their father appears to be a forgery. At the trial of
317

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRiMER~REVIEWER ON

REMEDIALLAW
the case, "B" and "C" commenced, through
counsel and by means of an expert witness, to
adduce evidence to prove that the seller's
signature was a forgery. "A" objected, saying that
the genuineness and due execution of the Bill of
Sale was deemed admitted because the answer
was unverified, as a matter of law, inasmuch as
the verification was made only on the express
basis of best information and belief. Resolve the
objection with reasons. (87 Bar Q9).
A.

Objection overruled. Under S8 R8 the requirement
of an oath does not apply when the adverse party
does not appear to be a party to the instrument.
Here the Defendants "B" and "C" were clearly
not parties to the Bill of Sale. Hence there was no
need for their answer to be verified or under oath.
The disclaimer by "B" and "C" of knowledge or
information about the Bill of Sale and their averment
that tr1e signature purporting to be their father's
appears to have been forged may be considered as
a specific denial under the third sentence of S10 R8.

Q.

Y leased a warehouse to Z for 2 years
evidenced by a written lease contract. As Z
refused to vacate after the expiration of the
lease, X, only son of Y who had died, filed action
to recover possession, alleging that although Z
sought renewal of the lease contract, this was
denied by Y in his lifetime, shown by a copy of a
letter-reply signed by him addressed to Z,
attached to the complaint as Annex A. In his
answer, Z asserted that the contract was verbally
renewed but he failed to deny under oath the due
execution and authenticity of Annex A.

318

RULES
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

During the trial Z's testimony showing Y's
signature on Annex A to be a forgery is
vehemently objected to on the ground that the
absence of a sworn denial in the answer
constitutes an implied admission of the due
execution and authenticity of Annex A, an
actionable document.
Resolve the objection
with reasons. (79 Bar Q6-1 ).
A.

Objection overruled. The rule on implied admission
under S7 & 8 R8 applies only to an actionable
document, that is, a written instrument or document
upon which an action or defense is based.
Here the action of X was based upon the
written lease contract and not upon the letter-reply
which is merely an evidentiary document.
Even assuming that the letter-reply was an
actionable document, the requirement of an oath
does not apply when the adverse party does not
appear to be a party to the instrument. (S8 R8).
Here Z was not a party to the letter-reply which was
unilaterally prepared by Y.

319
J9JC9B0M

t

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A

No. Under S7 R8, a document is actionable when
an action or defense is grounded upon such written
instrument or document. Here, the charge invoices
are not actionable documents per se as these only
provide details on the alleged transactions. These
documents need not be attached to or stated in the
complaint as these are evidentiary in nature. In fact,
Respondent's cause of action is not based on these
documents but on the contract of sale between the
parties. (Asian Construction & Dev't Corp. v.
Mendoza, 27 June 2012, Del Castillo, J.).

Q.

Action by BP Oil to recover value of petroleum
products delivered to Total Distribution under
an agency agreement executed between the
two. The complaint of BP Oil includes as an
annex a letter from BP Oil to Total which states
the value of stocks of unsold lubricants. This
letter was not specifically denied under oath by
Total. Is Total deemed to have admitted the
genuineness of the letter?

A

No. The letter is not an actionable document but an
evidentiary document. BP Oil's action was based
on the agency agreement, not the letter. Hence
Total's failure to put its denial under oath will not
amount to an implied admission. (BP Oil v. Total
Distribution, 6 Feb 2017, Mendoza).

Q.

Young Builders Corporation (YBC) sued Benson
Industries Inc. (BIi) for payment under a
construction contract where YBC would construct
a building for BIi. In its complaint YBC averred
that it had accomplished work on the building in
the amount of P54 million of which BIi had paid
only P40 million. Attached to the complaint was
a copy of the accomplishment billing. During

320
J9JC9B0M

RULE 8
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

the trial, YBC failed to authenticate the
accomplishment billing. Thus the court ruled in
favor of BIi. On appeal, YBC contends that there
was no need to authenticate the accomplishment
billing since BIi failed to specifically deny it under
oath and thus impliedly admitted its genuineness
and due execution.Is YBC's contentionmeritorious?

A.

No. The actionable document which was the basis
of YBC's action is the construction contract between
the parties. The accomplishment billing is merely an
evidentiary document. Thus the implied admission
rule does not apply and hence YBC needs to
authenticate the accomplishment billing. (Young
Builders Corp. v. Benson Industries Inc., 19 June
2019, Caguioa, J.).

Q.

Suppose a defendant denies under oath the due
execution of an actionable document attached
to plaintiff's complaint under Rule 8, Rules of
Court. However, before the trial, plaintiff serves
on defendant a request for admission under
Rule 26 of the Rules of Court, asking him to
admit the genuineness of the same actionable
document described in and exhibited with the
request but the latter fails to serve on the
plaintiff within 15 days a sworn statement denying
specifically the authenticity of the document. As
far as the probative value is concerned, which
will prevail, the sworn denial in the answer or
the implied admission arising from defendant's
failure to serve a sworn denial to the request for
admission? Explain. (79 Bar Q6-2).

A.

It is the sworn denial in the answer which will
prevail. A request for admission is not proper where
the subject matter thereof is the same as that
321

alleged in the requesting party's complaint for
which the requested party had already denied in his
answer. A party should not be required to make a
second denial of those allegations already denied
in his answer to the complaint. (Lafiada v. CA, G.R.
No. 102390, 1 February 2002).
Q.

P filed a verified complaint against D seeking to
recover a parcel of land. In the complaint, P
alleged that he never sold the land to D but D
took possession under a false claim of ownership.
D filed an answer to which he attached a copy
of a deed of sale between him and P over the
land. P did not specifically deny under oath
the genuineness and due execution of the deed
of sale. Was there an implied admission under
S8 RB?

A.

No. The verified complaint with a specific allegation
that P never sold the land to D was a substantial
traversal of the actionable document. (Toribio v.
Bidin, 134 SCRA 162).

Q.

Manuel filed a verified complaint to annul a
deed of sale over community property which his
wife Martha had executed in favor of Titan
Corporation. Manuel alleged that the sale was
made without his knowledge and consent. In its
answer, Titan Corporation attached a special
power of attorney purportedly executed by
Manuel in favor of his wife authorizing her to
sell the land. Manuel filed a reply which was not
under oath alleging that his signature to the
SPA was forged. May Manuel prove that his
signature to the SPA was forged?

322

J9JC9B0M

RULE 8
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

A.

Yes. The allegation in the verified complaint that
Manuel did not know or consent to the sale of the
land put Titan Corporation on adequate notice that
it would be called upon during the trial to prove the
genuineness and due execution of the SPA. Hence
the implied admission rule under S8 R8 does not
apply. (Titan Construction Corp. v. David, G.R. No.
169548, 15 March 2010, Del Castillo, J.; citing
Toribio v. Bidin, 134 SCRA 162). It may also be
said that the complaint, which was verified and
which alleged that Manuel did not consent or know
about the sale, was a substantial traversal of the
SPA's genuineness and due execution.

Q.

P filed a complaint for collection of PS00,000
against D. P attached a copy of the promissory
note for PS00,000 to the complaint. D filed an
answer which was not under oath or verified, in
which he alleged in the main that he had already
paid the PS00,000. P offered in evidence the
copy of the promissory note without accounting
for the non-production of the original. D objected
to the offer on the ground that it violates the
best evidence rule since only a copy and not
the original was presented. Should the trial court
sustain the objection?

A.

No the trial court should not sustain the objection.
The Supreme Court has held in Gaw v. Chua,
G.R. No. 160855, 16 April 2008, that a party who
impliedly admits the genuineness and due execution·
of a document by failing to contest it in accordance
with S8 R8 cannot object to the presentation
of a copy.

323

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Here D failed to specifically deny under oath the
promissory note since his answer was not verified or
under oath. Hence D impliedly admitted the
genuineness and due execution of the promissory
note and cannot object to the presentation of a copy
thereof rather than the original.
Q.

Petitioner Concepcion Chua and Respondent
Suy Ben Chua are the children of the late Chua
Chin. Upon the demise of Chua Chin, his
spouse and his children executed a deed of
partition wherein they waived their shares over
the Hagonoy Lumber in favor of their co-heir
Chua Sioc Han. Chua Sioc Han then sold the
Hagonoy Lumber to Respondent. Later Respondent
delivered a check for P200,000 to Petitioner
which
the latter encashed. Subsequently
Respondent sued Petitioner to collect on the
P200,000 which the Respondent alleges was a
loan. In her answer with counterclaim, Petitioner
alleged that the P200,000 was an advance on
her share in Hagonoy Lumber and counterclaimed
for accounting and delivery of her share.
Respondent
filed an answer to the
counterclaim wherein he alleged that Petitioner
no longer had any interest in Hagonoy Lumber
because of the execution of the deed of
partition and that he is now the owner of the
Hagonoy Lumber- by virtue of a deed of sale
executed in his favor by Chua Sioc Han.
Respondent annexed copies of the deed of
partition and of sale to his Answer to the
Counterclaim. Petitioner filed a reply and countered
that the deed of partition and the deed of sale
were not true and valid agreements and did not
express the true intention of the parties, and
324

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULES
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

that the deeds were only temporary paper
arrangements executed upon advice of counsel
until all the heirs could reach a final agreement.
After trial, the court ruled in favor of
Respondent. Petitioner contended that it was
error for the trial court to admit mere copies of
the deed of partition and the deed of sale in
violation of the best evidence rule. Is the
Petitioner's contention correct?
A.

No the Petitioner's contention is not correct.
The Supreme Court has held in Gaw v. Chua,
G.R. No. 160855, 16 April 2008, that production of
the original may be dispensed with in the trial
court's discretion whenever the opponent does not
bona fide dispute the contents of the documents
and no other useful purpose will be served by
requiring production.
Here there was no dispute as to the terms of
either deed; hence the RTC correctly admitted the
photocopies in evidence. Petitioner admitted signing
the deed of partition. As for the deed of sale,
Petitioner in effect admitted the genuineness and
due execution of the deed of sale when she failed to
specifically deny it pursuant to S8 R8. The Petitioner
did not contest the contents of the deeds but simply
alleged that there was a contemporaneousagreement
that the transfer of Hagonoy Lumber to Chua Sioc
Huan was only temporary.
(Note: Although Petitioner was not a party to
the deed of sale between Chua Sioc Huan and
Respondent and therefore is not required to deny it
under oath, she must still specifically deny its
genuineness and due execution. This Petitioner
325

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

failed to do and so she impliedly admitted the same
pursuant to S8 R8).
Q.

State Investment House Inc. (SIHI) filed an
action for collection against Filipinas Textile
Mills Inc, (Filtex). In its complaint SIHI alleged
that Filtex applied with SIHI for the issuance of
letters of credit to finance the purchase of raw
materials from various suppliers and that SIHI
issued the letters of credit but Filtex did not pay
the loan it had incurred from SIHI in relation to
the letters of credit. The letters of credit were
attached to the complaint. Filtex filed an unsworn
answer denying liability. Judgment was rendered
in favor of SIHI. Filtex contends that the trial
court erred in admitting in evidence the letters
of credit since the documentary stamps were
not affixed thereto and cancelled and hence the
letters of credit cannot be used in evidence
pursuant to Section 201 of the National Internal
Revenue Code. Is Filtex's contention valid?

A.

No. Since Filtex failed to specifically deny under
oath the letters of credit, it is deemed to have
impliedly admitted the genuineness and due execution
of the same. Such Implied admission includes the
waiver of the objection to the lack of documentary
stamps. (Filipinas Textile Mills Inc. v. State Investment
House Inc., G.R. No. 119800, 12 November 2003;
citing Hibberd v. Rhode, supra).

Q.

Plaintiff filed an action to annul a deed of sale
against the Defendant on the ground that he
had not made any sale thereof. The Defendant
filed an answer to which he attached a copy of a
deed of sale purportedly executed by the Plaintiff.
Plaintiff did not file a reply under oath. During the
326

J9JC9B0M

RULES

MannerOf MakingAllegationsIn Pleadings
trial, Plaintiff presented without objection an
expert witness who testified that the Plaintiff's
signature on the deed of sale was forged. May the
court take into account the testimony of the
expert witness in deciding the case?
A.

Yes. While the Plaintiff impliedly admitted the
genuineness and due execution of the deed of sale
when he did not specifically deny it under oath and
set forth what he claims to be the facts, the benefits
of the implied admission were lost by the Defendant
when he failed to timely object to evidence
challenging the genuineness and due execution of
the actionable document. (Koh v. Ongsiako, 36
Phil. 185; Titan Construction Corp. v. David, G.R.
No. 169548, 15 March 2010).

Q.

What are the three modes of specific denial?

A.

FIRST MODE: The defendant must specify each
material allegation of fact the truth of which he does
not admit, and whenever practicable, set forth the
substance of the matters upon which he relies to
45
support his denial.
SECOND MODE: Where a defendant desires
to deny only a part of the averment, he shall specify
so much of it as is true and material and deny only
the remainder.
THIRD MODE: Where a defendant is without
knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief
as to the truth of a material averment made in the
complaint, he shall so state, and this shall have the
effect of a denial. (S10 R8).

45
A party desiring to raise an issue as to the legal existence of any party or
the capacity of any party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity shall do
so by specific denial. (S4 R8)

What is the effect if material averments in a

Q.

Petitioner filed an action for quieting of title
against GSIS. The complaint alleged that since
1968 until the time the complaint was filed, GSIS
never exercised its rights as a mortgagee; the
real estate mortgage over his property constituted
a cloud on the title; GSIS' right to foreclose had
prescribed, In its answer, GSIS assailed that the
complaint failed to state a cause of action and
that prescription
does not run against it
because it Is a government entity.

Petitioner argued that GSIS had judicially
admitted that its right to foreclose the mortgage
had prescribed because of its failure to
specifically deny the paragraph in the complaint to
that effect. Is the petitioner's contention correct?
A.

No. It must be remembered that conclusions of fact
and law stated in the complaint are not deemed
admitted by the failure to make a specific denial.
This is true considering that only ultimate facts must

"The 2020 Rules amended "material averment in the complaint" to
"material averments in a pleading asserting a claim or claims." Does this mean
that there is no need to specifically deny a material averment which does not
assert a claim or claims? It is submitted that the answer is in the negative. S11
should not be read in isolation but in relation to S10 on specific denial which
states that a defendant must specifically deny each material allegation of fact the
truth of which he does not admit, without stating that such material allegation
must assert a claim or claims. It is submitted that the subject phrase in S11
should be read as "material averments in a pleading upon which the pleader
relies upon to support his claim or claims." (See S1 RB).

328

RULES
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

be alleged in any pleading and only material
allegation of facts need to be specifically denied.
A conclusion of law is a legal inference on a
question of law made as a result of a factual
showing where no further evidence is required. The
allegation of prescription in petitioner's complaint is a
mere conclusion of law. Labelling an obligation
to have prescribed without specifying the
circumstances behind it is a mere conclusion of law.
The fact that GSIS had not instituted any action
within ten years after the loan had been contracted
is insufficient to hold that prescription had set in.
Thus, even if GSIS' denial would not be considered
as a specific denial, only the fact that GSIS had not
commenced any action, would be deemed admitted
at the most. This is true considering that the
circumstances to establish prescription against GSIS
have not been alleged with particularity.
In fine there was no judicial admission on th~
part of GSIS with regard to prescription because
treating the obligation as prescribed, was merely a
conclusion of law. It would have been different if
petitioner's complaint alleged details necessary to
determine when GSIS' right to foreclose arose, i.e.,
date of maturity and whether demand was necessary.

Capitol Motors filed a complaint for sum of
money against Yabut. A copy of the promissory
note upon which the action was based was

that Yabut defaulted in the payment of the note.

allegations for want of knowledge or information
sufficient to form a belief as to the truth thereof.
Capitol Motors moved for a judgment on the
pleadings in its favor. Should the trial court
grant the motion?

A.

Yes. The third mode of specific denial may not be
availed of when the fact as to which want of
knowledge or information is claimed is so plainly
and necessarily within the defendant's knowledge
that his averment of ignorance must be palpably
untrue. The defendant must aver positively or state
how it is that he is ignorant of the fact alleged.
(Capitol Motors v. Yabut, 32 SCRA 1).

Q.

Plaintiff sued Defendant corporation for nonpayment of hospital equipment delivered to it.
Paragraph 6 of the complaint stated that
Defendant's total obligation as of 15 February
2009 was P123,901,650.00, but its balance
thereafter became oniy P54,654, 195.54 because
it had since then paid P67,357,683.23 to the
Plaintiff. The Defendant in its answer denied
paragraphs no. 6 of the complaint "for lack of
knowledge or information sufficient to form a
belief as to the truth or falsity thereof, inasmuch
as the alleged transactions were undertaken
during the term of office of the past officers of
Defendant corporation, subject to its special
and affirmative defenses." The Defendant in its
answer raised the special and affirmativedefenses
of lack of personaljurisdiction, impropervenue, lis
pendens, and forum shopping. Was the manner of
denial effective as a specific denial?

A.

No. Considering that paragraph no. 6 of the
complaint averred matters that the Defendant ought

330

J9JC9B0M

RULE 8
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

to know or could have easily known, the answer did
not specifically deny such material averments. It is
settled that denials based on lack of knowledge or
information of matters clearly known to the pleader,
or ought to be known to it, or could have easily
been known by it are insufficient, and constitute
ineffective or sham denials.
That the Defendant qualified its admissions
and denials by subjecting them to its special and
affirmative defenses of lack of jurisdiction over its
person, improper venue, litis pendentia and forum
shopping was of no consequence because these
affirmative defenses, by their nature, involved
matters extrinsic to the merits of the Plaintiff's
claim, and thus did not negate the material
averments of the complaint. (Fernando Medical
Enterprises v. Wesleyan University Philippines,
Inc., 20 January 2016, Bersamin, J.).
Q.

What is a negative pregnant? What is the effect
of a negative pregnant?

A.

A negative pregnant is a denial of a fact alleged
with some qualifying or modifying circumstance
which denial is ambiguous or conjunctive, that is, it
cannot be ascertained whether it is the fact or only
the qualification or modification which is denied.
The effect is that the defendant is deemed to
have only denied the qualification or modification
but not the fact itself which is deemed admitted.

Q.

Plaintiff Galofa filed a case against Nee Bon
Sing for recovery of possession of and to quiet
title over a parcel of land. Plaintiff in Paragraph
4 of the complaint alleges that Plaintiff was
unable to take possession due to unwarranted
adverse claim of ownership and possession by
Defendant alleging sale by a certain Fe Nicolas
of subject property to Defendant. In paragraph 3
of his answer, the Defendant alleged thus:
"Defendant specifically denies Paragraph 4 of
the Complaint, the truth being that Defendant
never asserted title of ownership to the property
in virtue of any deed of conveyance executed in
favor of Defendant by Fe Nicolas nor claimed
any possessory right." The Plaintiff moved for
judgment on the pleadings. Should the court
grant the Plaintiff's motion?

A.

Yes. Paragraph 3 of the answer was a negative
pregnant. The Defendant's denial as to the material
averments in par. 4 conjoined with his disclaimer of
dominical or possessory rights in the manner
alleged in the complaint. The Defendant's denial is
therefore a negative pregnant which is equivalent to
an admission. The Defendant is deemed to have
denied only the qualification regarding the sale by
Fe Nicolas but not the fact that he prevented
Plaintiff from taking possession by an unwarranted
adverse claim of ownership Hence a judgment on
the pleadings is proper. (Ga/ofa v. Nee Bon Sing,
22 SCRA 48).

Paragraph 9 of the Complaint alleged thus:
"That as a result thereof, Plaintiff was
compelled to file a case in court and in so doing
has to retain the services of counsel for the
contracted amount of no less than P1,500."
Defendant in his answer alleged thus:
"That if in fact the Plaintiff had contracted,
as alleged in Par. 9 of the Complaint, the
services of counsel and will spend the amounts
therein specified occasioned by the institution of
the action, the same is his own personal
responsibility,for which reason, Defendant denies
any part and assumes no liabilitytherefor."
Is the Defendant deemed to have admitted
Paragraph 9 of the Complaint?

A.

Yes. The Defendant failed to specifically deny
Paragraph 9 under any of the modes set forth in
S10 RS. The defendant does not deny the alleged
fact; what he denies is his liability therefor, which is
an issue of law. Since the defendant neither denies
nor admits the material allegation about the
services of plaintiff's counsel, he is deemed to have
admitted Paragraph 9. ( Ga/ofa v. Nee Bon Sing, 22
SCRA 48). The Defendant should have employed
the third form of denial.

Q.

In his complaint for foreclosure of mortgage to
which was duly attached a copy of the
mortgage deed, plaintiff PP alleged inter alia as
follows: (1) that defendant DD duly executed the
mortgage deed, copy of which is Annex "A" of
the complaint and made an integral part thereof;
and (2) that to prosecute his complaint, plaintiff

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

contracted a lawyer, CC, for a fee of PS0,000. In
his answer, defendant alleged, inter alia, that he
had no knowledge of the mortgage of the
mortgage deed, and he also denied any liability
for plaintiff's contracting with a lawyer for a fee.
Does defendant's answer as to plaintiff's
allegation no, 1 as well as no. 2 sufficiently raise
an issue of fact? Reason briefly. (04 Bar Q6b).
A.

Defendant's answer as to plaintiff's allegation no. 1
does not sufficiently raise an issue of fact.
The third mode of specific denial may not be
availed of when the fact as to which want of
knowledge or information is claimed is so plainly
and necessarily within the defendant's knowledge
that his averment of ignorance must be palpably
untrue. The defendant must aver positively whether
he duly executed the mortgage deed or not. It
cannot be that he had no knowledge of plaintiff's
allegation. (Capitol Motors v. Yabut, 32 SCRA 1).
Defendant's answer as to plaintiff's allegation no.
2 also does not sufficiently raise an issue of fact.
In a case involving similar facts, the Supreme
Court held that where defendant did not deny the
alleged fact regarding the engagement of a lawyer
for a fee but denied only his liability therefor, he is
deemed to have admitted the alleged fact. ( Galofa
v. Nee Bon Sing, 22 SCRA 48).

RULE 8

concrete title while the Defendants are owners
by virtue of a TCT which was annexed to the
answer. Did the Defendants specifically deny
the allegation in the complaint regarding Urn's
prior physical possession and the Defendants'
unlawful physical invasion?
A.

Yes. While the substance of the matters upon

these were stated or indicated in the special and

days from the filing of the answer.47 Such affirmative
defenses shall be resolved by the court within 30
days from the termination of the summary hearing.
(S12[d] RS, 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure).
Under the first paragraph, the court has a duty
to resolve the affirmative defenses while in the
second paragraph, the court has the discretion to
conduct or not the summary hearing for the
resolution of the affirmative defense. If the court
decides not to conduct the summary hearing, the
affirmative defenses would be resolved during
the trial proper.
Subject to the right of appeal, an order
granting a motion to dismiss or an affirmative
defense that the cause of action is barred by a prior
judgment or by the statute of limitations; that the
claim or demand set forth in the plaintiffs pleading
has been paid, waived, abandoned or otherwise
extinguished; or that the claim on which the action
is founded is unenforceable under the provisions of
the statute of frauds, shall bar the refiling of the
same action or claim. (S13 R15, 2020 Rules of

Note that a motion to hear affirmative defenses is a prohibited motion.

acquired after the answer was filed, the defendant should promptly file a motion
for leave to admit supplemental answer averring the affirmative defense.

shall constitute a waiver thereof. (S12[b] RB, 2020
Rules of Civil Procedure).
Q.

What is the remedy of the defendant from the
denial of the affirmative defense?

A.

Affirmative defenses, if denied, shall not be the
subject of a motion for reconsideration or petition
for certiorari, prohibition or mandamus, but may be
among the matters to be raised on appeal after a
judgment on the merits. (S12[e] RB, 2020 Rules
of Civil Procedure). 49

Lack of legal capacity to sue
Q.

What is meant by the plaintiff having no legal
capacity to sue?

A.

The term "lack of legal capacity to sue" means
either that the plaintiff does not have the necessary
qualifications to appear in the case because he is
not in the full exercise of his civil rights, as in the
case of a minor or incompetent who is not assisted
by his father, mother, guardian, or guardian ad
!item; or when he does not have the character or
representation which he claims, as when he is not a
duly appointed executor or administrator of the
estate he purports to represent. Thus an administrator
has no legal capacity to sue after her resignation as
such has been accepted by the court. (Lao v. Dee,
L-3B90, 23 January 1952). Other examples are: (1)
a foreign corporation doing business in the
Philippines without a license (Sec. 133, Corporation
Code); and (2) an unincorporated association.

49
Even if the affirmative defense is granted, a motion for reconsideration
thereof is prohibited. (S12[c] R15). The remedy of the plaintiff is an appeal.

Q.

In 1992, Petitioner Obando, in his capacity as
co-administrator of the estate of the Spouses
Figueras, filed a Complaint against Eduardo and
Amigo Realty (Respondents) for the nullification
of sale of a real property. The Respondents filed
their answer.
However, the probate court in the estate
proceedings issued an order dated 17 December
1997 removing Petitioner from his office as coadministrator of the estate of the Figueras spouses
after his conviction of estafa through falsification of
public document-Consequently, in the civil case,
Respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss dated 27
January 1998, after Petitioner had rested his case.
The Respondents' ground for dismissal was the
lack of legal capacity to sue of Petitioner after
having been removed as co-administrator. The
Petitioner argued that the motion to dismiss should
be denied since the Rules provide that a motion to
dismiss may be submitted only before the filing of a
responsive pleading. Petitioner argued that it
was already too late for Respondents to file a
Motion to Dismiss after Petitioner had finished
presenting his evidence. May the trial court grant
the motion to dismiss?

A.

Yes. It must be pointed out that it was only after
Petitioner had been convicted of estafa through
falsification that the probate court divested him of
his representation of the Figueras estate. It was
only then that the ground of lack of legal capacity
became available to the Respondents. Hence, it
could not be said that they waived it by raising it in
a Motion to Dismiss filed after their Answer was
submitted. If the plaintiff loses his capacity to sue
during the pendency of the case, the defendant
339

responsive pleading. (Obando v. Figueras, 322
SCRA 148 [2000], Panganiban, J.). 50

Q.

When the plaintiff is not the real party in
interest, what is the ground for dismissal?

A.

Failure to state a cause of action. (Casimiro v.
Roque, 98 Phil. 880).

Q.

Distinguish between lack of legal capacity to
sue and lack of personality to sue.

A.

A litigant lacks the personality to sue when he or
she is not the real party in interest. In this situation,
the initiatory pleading may be dismissed on the
ground of failure to state a cause of action.
The lack of the legal capacity to sue, on the
other hand, refers to a litigant's "general disability to

sue, such as on account of minority, insanity,
incompetence, lack of juridical personality or any
other general disqualifications of a party." In this
case, the initiatory pleading may be dismissed on
the ground of lack of legal capacity to sue.
When an entity has no separate juridical
personality, it has no legal capacity to sue. S1 R3
states that "only natural or juridical persons or
entities authorized by law may be Rarties in a civil
action." (National Electrification Administration v.
Maguindanao Electric Cooperative, Inc., 11 April
2018, Jardeleza, J.).
50
Under the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure, a motion to dismiss on the
ground of lack of legal capacity to sue is prohibited. (S12[a] R15). The remedy of
the defendant would be to file a motion for leave to file supplemental answer, the
lack of legal capacity having occurred after the filing of the original answer.
(S6 R10).

RULE 8
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

Q.

Plaintiff Zuiden Bros. Ltd. is a Hong Kong
corporation. On several occasions, GTVL Inc.
purchased lace products from Zuiden. As per
instruction of GTVL, the lace products were
delivered by Zuiden to Kenzar Ltd., a Hong
Kong corporation. The products are then
considered as sold upon receipt by Kenzar of
the goods purchased by GTVL. Kenzar then had
the obligation to deliver the products to the
Philippines and/or to follow whatever instructions
GTVL had on the matter. GTVL failed to pay
Zuiden, so the latter brought a suit before the
RTC of Paranaque City for collection of a sum
of money. GTVL filed an answer raising the
affirmative defense of plaintiff's lack of legal
capacity to sue. It was alleged that Zuiden is
doing business in the Philippines without a
license and thus barred from suing under
Section 133 of the Corporation Code. Should
the action be dismissed?

A.

No. An unlicensed foreign corporation not doing
business in the Philippines can sue before Philippine
courts. The transactions between Zuiden and GTVL
cannot be considered as "doing business" in the
Philippines. An essential condition to be considered
as doing business in the Philippines is the actual
performance of specific commercial acts within the
territory of the Philippines for the plain reason that
the Philippines has no jurisdiction over commercial
acts performed in foreign territories. Here the
perfectionand the consummation of these transactions
were done outside the Philippines. Moreover the
transactions are simply export transactions. An
exporter is not deemed to be doing business in a
foreign country by the simple fact of exporting
341

products to such foreign country. (B. Van Zuiden
Bros., Ltd., v. GTVL Mfg. Industries, Inc., G.R. No.
147905, 28 May 2007).
Q.

May

a

corporation file a case after its
dissolution and the lapse of the 3-year grace
period provided for in Section 122 of the
Corporation Code?

A.

No. In such a case the corporation petitioner lacks
capacity to sue because it no longer possesses
juridical personality by reason of its dissolution and
lapse of the three-year grace period provided for
under Sec. 122 of the Corporation Code. The case
was properly dismissed on ground of lack of legal
capacity to sue. (Alabang Oev't Corp. v. Alabang
Hills Village Association, 2 June 2014).

Pleading asserting the claim states no cause of action
Q.

When does a pleading fail to state a cause of
action?

A.

A pleading fails to state a cause of action when it
contains no allegation that there is an act or
omission by the defendant which violated the right
of the plaintiff. For example a complaint to collect
on a promissory note which avers that the promissory
note is not yet due but that the defendant was
having financial difficulties. Mere financial difficulty
does not make the obliger lose the benefit of the
period under Article 1198 of the Civil Code.

Q.

Where the plaintiff's cause of action is premature,
is there a ground for a motion to dismiss?

A.

Yes. A complaint which contains a premature cause
of action may be dismissed for failure to state a
342

J9JC9B0M

RULE8
Manner Of Making Allegations In Pleadings

cause of action. (Erlanger & Galinger, Inc. v. Villamar,
L-8767, 23 March 1956).
Q.

Distinguish failure to state a cause of action
from lack of cause of action.

A.

Failure to state a cause of action relates to the
failure of the allegations of the pleading to state a
cause of action, while lack of cause of action
relates to a failure of proof, that is, the plaintiff's
failure to prove by evidence his allegations relating
to his cause of action.
Dismissal of the complaint on the ground of
failure to state a cause of action would not bar the
re-filing of the complaint, while a judgment for
defendant on the ground of lack of cause of action
would amount to res judicata.

Failure to comply with a condition precedent
Q.

May a court motu proprio dismiss a case
for failure to comply with Article 151 of the
Family Code?

A.

No. Non-compliancewith the earnest effort requirement
under Article 151 of the Family Code is not a
jurisdictional defect which would authorize the
courts to dismiss suits filed before them motu
proprio. Rather, it merely partakes of a condition
precedent such that the non-compliance therewith
constitutes a ground for dismissal of a suit should
the same be invoked by the opposing party at the
earliest opportunity, as in a motion to dismiss or in
the answer. Otherwise, such ground is deemed
waived. (Moreno v. Kahn, 30 July 2018, PerlasBernabe, J.).

J9JC9B0M

RULE 9. EFFECT OF FAILURE TO PLEAD
Q.

What is the effect if defenses and objections are
not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in
the answer?

A.

They are deemed waived. However, when it appears
from the pleadings or the evidence on record that
the court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter,
that there is another action pending between the
same parties for the same cause, or that the action
is barred by prior judgment or by statute of
limitations, the court shall dismiss the claim. (JRLP) 51

Q.

Petitioners Rebecca and Rosalie, children of
Spouses Lourdes and Luciano Pacana, filed an
action for accounting and damages against
Rovila Inc., and Respondents. The Petitioners
alleged that Respondents had embezzled the
funds and property of Rovi!a Water Supply, the
family business owned by their parents. The
Petitioners filed the complaint in their own
names although Rosalie was authorized by
Lourdes through an SPA.
Lourdes and Luciano died. The Petitioners
informed the court of this development and
amended the complaint but the caption of
the amended complaint remained the same.
Respondents filed a motion to dismiss on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction, which was
denied, and later an answer. During the pretrial,

51
Since the only grounds that may be raised in a motion to dismiss are res
judicata, lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, lis pendens, and prescription (S12[a]
R15), and these are not waived by failure to set them up in the motion to dismiss,
the application of S1 R9 would now be limited only to failure to raise the defense
or objection in the answer.

344

RULE 9
Effect Of Failure To Plead

the Respondents stated for the first time that
they would seek the dismissal of the complaint
because the Petitioners are not the real parties
in interest but rather the deceased spouses
Pacana who are the alleged owners. The RTC
issued a pretrial order where one of the issues
submitted was whether the complaint should be
dismissed for failure to comply with S2 R2
which requires that every action must be
prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.
Respondents then filed a motion to dismiss
on the ground that the Petitioners are not the real
party in interest and hence the complaint fails to
state a cause of action. Petitioners argued that
the ground of failure to state a cause of action
was waived while Respondents countered that
the ground of failure to state a cause of action
was timely raised pursuant to S2(f) R18. Should
the motion to dismiss be granted?
A.

The motion to dismiss should not be granted.
Under S1 R9, defenses and objections not raised
either in the motion to dismiss or in the answer are
deemed waived. Under the 1997 Rules, grounds
other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction, res
judicata, lis pendens, and prescription are deemed
waived if not raised either in the motion to dismiss
or in the answer. Failure to state a cause of action
was deleted as an exception to the waiver rule.
Although S2(f) R18 provides that the court
during the pretrial may consider the propriety of
dismissing the action should a valid ground therefor
be found to exist, this applies only to the issues that
would govern the trial proper. The issue of failure to

345
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

state a cause of action can no longer be taken up by
the trial court since it had been waived under S1 R9.
(Pacana-Contreras v. Ravi/a Water Supply, Inc.,
G.R. No. 168979, 2 December 2013, Brion, J.).
Q.

What is the effect if a compulsory counterclaim,
or cross-claim, is not set up in a case?

A.

It shall be barred. (S2 R9).

Q.

What is the reason behind 52 R9?

A.

The rule is designed to achieve resolution of the
whole controversy at one time and in one action
and to avoid multiplicity of suits. (Baclayon v. Court
of Appeals, 182 SCRA 761; Ledesma v. Morales,
87 Phil. 199).

Q.

How should a compulsory counterclaim or
cross-claim be set up?

A.

A compulsory counterclaim or a cross-claim that a
defending party has at the time he files his answer
shall be contained therein. (S8 R 11).

Q.

May a compulsory counterclaim be set up in a
motion to dismiss?

A.

No. The Supreme Court has stated that if the
defendant has a compulsory counterclaim, he
should not file a motion to dismiss but an answer
with a counterclaim, with the ground for the motion
to dismiss being asserted as an affirmative defense
pursuant to S6 R16 (1997 Rules). In such a case,
the dismissai of the complaint shall be without
prejudice to the prosecution in the same or
separate action of a counterclaim pleaded in the

346

J9JC9B0M

RULE 9
Effect Of Failure To Plead

answer. (Financial Building Corp. v. Forbes Park
Association, G.R. No. 133119, 17 August 2000). 52
Q.

What is the remedy of a party if he fails to set up
his counterclaim or cross-claim in the answer?

A.

When a pleader fails to set up a counterclaim or a
cross-claim through oversight, inadvertence, or
excusable neglect, or when justice requires (Keyword:
JOIE), he may, by leave of court, set up the
counterclaim or cross-claim by amendment before
judgment. (S10 R11).

Q.

What is the rule on pleading regarding afteracquired counterclaims or cross-claims?

A.

An after-acquired counterclaim is merely permissive
even if it arises from or is connected with the
transaction or occurrence constituting the subjectmatter of the opposing party's claim.
A counterclaim or a cross-claim which either
matured or was acquired by a party after serving
his pleading may, with the permission of the court,
be presented as a counterclaim or a cross-claim by
supplemental pleading before judgment. (S9 R11 ).
In Banco de Oro Universal Bank vs. Court of
Appeals, G.R. No. 160354, 25 August 2005, the
Supreme Court also allowed the setting up of the
after-acquired counterclaim in a separate action.

Q.

If a compulsory counterclaim or cross-claim not
set up is made the subject of a separate action,
what is the remedy of the defendant?

52
Although S16 R16 was not transposed or re-enacted in the 2020 Rules,
it is submitted that the procedure in the second paragraph thereof regarding the
prosecution in the same action of a counterclaim pleaded in the answer is still
valid under the 2020 Rules.

347

PRIMER~REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

The remedy of the defendant is to file a motion to
dismiss or answer raising the ground of litis
pendentia if the first case is still pending or the
ground of res judicata if the first case is already
final and unappealable. The basis for this is that
under S4 ?(b) R39, the final judgment is conclusive
not only with respect to the matter directly adjudged
but also as to any other matter that could have
been raised in relation thereto. (Metals Engineering
Resources Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R.
No. 95631, 28 October 1991).53

Q.

P sues D for tort. D files a motion to dismiss on
the ground of res judicata. The court dismisses
P's complaint and the dismissal order becomes
final and unappealable. Later D sues P for moral
and exemplary damages for having brought a
harassment suit. P moves to dismiss on the
ground that the claim for moral and exemplary
damages should have been brought as a
counterclaim in the torts case. Should the motion
to dismiss be granted?

A.

Yes. Had D wanted to prosecute his claim for moral
and exemplary damages, he should have not filed a
motion to dismiss but an answer wherein he should
have raised res judicata as an affirmative defense
and included a counterclaim in the answer for moral
and exemplary damages. Not having done so,
the claim for damages is barred under S2 R9.

53
The author is of the view that the more precise affirmative defense is that
the claim has been waived or otherwise extinguished. (S7 R6, S2 R9). Res
judicata would apply only if there is identity of causes of action. There is no
identity of cause of action between the complaint and the compulsory
counterclaim. See for instance Financial Building Corp. v. Forbes Park
Association, 338 SCRA 346 [2000] where it was held that the basis for dismissal
is bar by prior judgment or waiver.

Declaration of Default
Q.

When may a defendant be declared in default?
What happens thereafter?

A.

If the defendant fails to answer within the time
allowed therefor, the court shall upon motion of the
claiming party with notice to the defending party,
and proof of such failure, declare the defending
party in default. Thereupon, the court shall:
1) Proceed to render judgment granting the claimant
such relief as his pleading may warrant; or
2)

In its discretion, require the claimant to submit
evidence. (S3 R9).

Q.

May the reception of evidence be delegated?

A.

Yes, it may be delegated to the clerk of court (S3
R9), who must be a member of the bar. (S9 R30).

Q.

Should a motion to declare defendant in default
be set for hearing?

A.

While such a motion is a litigious motion, a hearing
is discretionary upon the court. (S6 R15). The
defendant however should be given the chance
to oppose the motion to declare him in default.
(S5[c] R15).

Q.

May the court motu proprio declare a defendant
in default for failure to timely file an answer?

A.

No. There should be a motion by the plaintiff. Note
however that under the Rule on Summary
Procedure, the court may motu proprio render
349

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

judgment in favor of the plaintiff if the defendant
fails to timely answer.
Q.

What is the effect of the order of default?

A.

A party in default shall be entitled to notice of
subsequent proceedings but not to take part in the
trial. (S3[a] R9).

Q.

Plaintiff filed a action for sum of money against
the defendant before the MTC. For failure to
answer, the defendant was declared in default.
Subsequently however the MTC dismissed
the case motu proprio for failure of the plaintiff
to comply with the requirement of prior
barangay conciliation. Was the motu proprio
dismissal proper?

A.

No. The ground of non-compliance with a condition
precedent, i.e., undergoing prior barangay conciliation
proceedings, was not invoked at the earliest
opportunity, as in fact, respondent was declared in
default for failure to file a responsive pleading
despite due notice. Hence such ground was deemed
waived. (Lansangan v. Caisip, 6 August 2018,
Perlas-Bernabe, J.).

Q.

May a party who is declared in default testify in
behalf of the non-defaulted defendants?

A.

Yes. There is nothing in the Rules of Court which
prohibit or disqualify a defaulted party from being a
witness for the non-defaulted defendant/s. ( Cavili v.
Florendo, G.R. No. 73039, 9 October 1987).

Q.

before the RTC. D filed an answer within the

a)

May E and F be declared in default upon
motion of P?

b) May P move for a default judgment against
E and F?

A.

Q.

c)

May E and F take part in the trial?

d)

May E and F testify in behalf of D?

a)

Yes, since E and F did not file their answers.

b)

No. This is a case of partial default under S3(c)
R9. When a pleading asserting a claim states
a common cause of action against several
defending parties, some of who answer and the
others fail to do so, the court shall try the case
against a// upon the answers thus filed and
render judgment upon the evidence presented.
Here the court should try the case against D, E,
and F upon the answer filed by D.

c)

No. A party in default shall be entitled to notice
of subsequent proceedings but not to take part
in the trial.

d)

Yes. A defaulted party is not disqualified from
testifying in court in behalf of a non-defaulted
party. (Cavili v. Florendo, supra).

P filed a complaint against D, E, and F wherein
he alleges that defendants are jointly indebted
to him for P900,000. D filed an answer within the
reglementary period but E and F did not.
a)

May E and F be declared in default upon
motion of P?
351

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

b)

May P move for a default judgment against
E and F?

A.
a) Yes since E and F did not file an answer within
the reglementary period.
b) Yes. The provisions of S3(c) R9 do not apply
since the complaint does not state a common
cause of action against D, E, and F. In a joint
obligation, each obligation of the joint debtor is
separate and distinct from the other joint
debtors. Hence the court may render default
judgment against E and F ordering them to pay
P300,000 each to P.

Q.

P filed a complaint for collection of a PS00,000
loan against D. D did not file an answer and was
declared in default. The clerk of court received
P's evidence which proved that the amount of
the loan was actually PSS0,000. May the court
award P550,000 to P?

A.

No. A judgment rendered against a party in default
shall not exceed the amount or be different in kind
from that prayed for nor award unliquidated
damages. (S3[d] R9). This is different from the rule
where the defendant was not declared in default
and which is thus covered by S5 R 10.

Q.

Plaintiff sued Defendant for collection of a
P45,000 loan plus interest of 12% per annum
from 2 March 1991 until full payment.
Defendant did not file an answer and was
accordingly declared in default. After Plaintiff
presented his evidence ex parte, the RTC
rendered judgment ordering Defendant to pay

352
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 9
Effect Of Failure To Plead

Plaintiff P45,000 plus interest of 5% per month
from 2 March 1991 until full payment. Defendant
failed to appeal. Subsequently Defendant filed a
petition for annulment of judgment regarding
the portion thereof that awarded 5% per month
interest rather than 12% per annum interest.
The Plaintiff contends that the judgment has
already become final and executory and that
there are only two grounds for a petition for
annulment, that is, extrinsic fraud and lack of
jurisdiction, none of which is present. May the
petition for annulment of judgment prosper?
A.

Yes, a petition for annulment of judgment is an
exception to the final judgment rule, which states
that final and executory judgments can no longer
be set aside.
While under S2 R47 a Petition for Annulment
of Judgment may be based only on the grounds of
extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction, jurisprudence
recognizes lack of due process as additional
ground to annul a judgment. A final and executory
judgment may still be set aside if, upon mere
inspection thereof, its patent nullity can be shown
for having been issued without jurisdiction or for
lack of due process of law. Here the grant of 5%
monthly interest is way beyond the 12% per annum
interest sought in the Complaint and smacks of
violation of due process. The reason is that under
S3(d) R9, a judgment rendered against a party in
default shall not exceed the amount or be different
in kind from that prayed for. (Diana v. Balangue, 7
January 2013, Del Castillo, J.).

353

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

What are the cases wherein no defaults are
allowed?

A.

In actions for annulment or declaration of nullity of
marriage or for legal separation. If the defending party
fails to answer, the court shall order the Solicitor
General or his deputized public prosecutor to
investigate whether or not a collusion between the
parties exists, and if there is no collusion, to intervene
for the State in order to see to it that that evidence
submitted is not fabricated or suppressed. (S3[e] R9;
Articles 48 and 60, Family Code). No judgment shall
be based on a stipulation of facts or confession of
judgment. (Articles 48 and 60, Family Code).

Q.

Atty. Victor Dabo is the lawyer of the defendant
in Civil Case No. 1286 of the Regional Trial
Court of Manila entitled "Sweet Sugar Inc. v.
National Landair Inc." The defendant was served
summons on 6 July 2008. As of 17 October 2008,
Atty. Dabo had not filed any responsive
pleading on behalf of the defendant on account
of numerous social engagements with important
and prospective clients.
On 18 October 2008, the counsel for the
plaintiff filed with the court a "Motion to Declare
Defendant in Default," a copy of which was duly
served upon Atty. Dabo. By way of opposition
to the said motion, Atty. Dabo served and filed
with the court a "Motion to Admit Answer" with
the defendant's answer attached thereto. The
tendered answer recited facts which constituted
valid defenses to the claim asserted in the
complaint.

354

J9JC9B0M

RULE 9
Effect Of Failure To Plead

The counsel for the plaintiff opposed the
admission of the answer arguing that it was
filed out of time; that the inattention of Atty.
Dabo did not constitute fraud, accident, mistake
or excusable neglect; and that it would be unfair
and unjust if the prejudice caused by the social
activities of Atty. Dabo be inflicted upon the
plaintiff, and not upon Atty. Dabo and his client.
What action should the court take? Reasons.
(83 Bar Q1 ed).
A.

The court should admit the amended complaint.
The Supreme Court has held that the
defendant's answer should be admitted where it
was filed before he had been declared in default as
default judgments are generally disfavored. (Cathay
Pacific Airways v. Romil/o, 141 SCRA 451, De las
Santos v. Carpio, 501 SCRA 390 [2006]).
While Atty. Dabo unduly delayed in filing the
answer, this was counterbalanced by the delay of
plaintiff's counsel in filing the motion to declare the
defendant in default. Moreover the answer contained
valid defenses. Cases should as much as possible
be decided on the merits rather than on technicalities.

Q.

What are the remedies of a party who fails to file
an answer and/or is declared in default?

A.
1)

Before notice of order of default. File a motion
to admit answer giving a justifiable cause for
the delay in the filing of the answer. Where an
answer has been filed belatedly but before the
defendant is declared in default, the court
355

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

should admit the answer in order to resolve the
case on the merits rather than on technicalities.

Q.

2)

After order of default but before judgment. File
a motion under oath to set aside the default
order upon proper showing that his failure to
answer was due to fraud, accident, mistake or
excusable negligence and that he has a
meritorious defense. (S3[b] R9).

3)

After judgment but before it becomes final. File a
motion for new trial on the ground of FAME under
R37. If the motion for new trial is denied, the
defendant may appeal within 15 days from
receipt of the order denying the motion for
new trial.

4)

After judgment becomes final. File a petition
for relief under R38. If the defendant was
improvidently or wrongly declared in default he
may move to set aside the judgment by way of
a special civil action for certiorari.

5)

After period to file a petition for relief has
lapsed. File a petition for annulment of judgment
based on extrinsic fraud under R47.

P files a collection case for PS00,000 against D.
D was declared in default on the ground that his
answer was filed beyond the reglementary
period. D filed a motion for reconsideration in
which he submitted proof that his answer was
filed on the 15th day from service of summons.
The trial court denied the motion on the ground
that it was not accompanied by an affidavit of
merits. Default judgment rendered against D
who received a copy of the judgment on March
1. D filed a motion for reconsideration which

356
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 9
Effect Of Failure To Plead

was denied in an order received by D on April 1.
On May 3 D filed a special civil action for
certiorari with the CA to set aside the default
judgment. P argued that the petition should be
dismissed since the proper remedy was appeal.
Should the petition for certiorari be dismissed?
A.

No. The trial court acted with grave abuse of
discretion when it declared the defendant in default
despite the fact that there was proof that he had
timely filed his answer. Furthermore a motion for
reconsideration need not be accompanied by ari
affidavit of merits. Appeal is not an adequate
remedy since D was not able to present any
countervailing evidence before the court a quo.
(Balangcad v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 83888,
12 February 1998).

Q.

Tan filed with the MTC a collection case against
Otero for failure to pay purchases of petroleum
products. Otero failed to file his answer and was
duly declared in default. During presentation of
evidence ex parte, Tan presented the testimonies
of his two Petron outlet employees who
attended to Otero when he made his purchases.
Tan also presented statements of accounts
prepared by his employee Lito, who however
was not presented to testify. The MTC rendered
a default judgment in favor of Tan. On appeal
Otero contends that the MTC should not have
taken into consideration the SOAs since Tan
failed to authenticate them, the employee who
actually prepared them not having been
presented to testify. Nonetheless, the RTC and
the CA affirmed. May Otero on appeal still raise
the failure of Tan to authenticate the SOAs?

357

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

Yes. A defendant against whom a default judgment
was rendered is not barred on appeal from
challenging the judgment for being contrary to the
law and the evidence. Hence the defendant on
appeal may challenge the evidence received as
unauthenticated and as hearsay. (Otero v. Tan, 15
August 2012, Reyes, J.). The SOAs were not
authenticated as no witness was presented to
identify the signature of the one who prepared it.
They were also hearsay since the one who
prepared them was not presented in court nor was
there a showing that he was unavailable to testify.

Q.

May a party declared in default appeal from the
default judgment of the RTC and file appeal
brief in the CA?

A.

Yes. The provision that the defaulting party cannot
take part in the trial only meant that he has already
lost his standing in the trial court. In other words,
the effect of the judgment of default is limited only
to those stages in the prosecution of the case
which terminated with and included in the judgment
of the trial court on the merits. A defaulted party
may appeal from the judgment rendered against
him. And concomitant with the said right is the filing
of the appellant's brief in order to be heard, or an
appellee's brief, if the one who appealed the
judgment was the piaintiff. (Royal Plains View Inc.
v. Mejia, 12 Nov 2018, Reyes, J.).

RULE 10. AMENDED &
SUPPLEMENTAL PLEADINGS
Q.

How may a pleading be amended?

A.

Pleadings may be amended by (1) adding or
striking out an allegation or the name of any party,
or (2) correcting a mistake in the name of a party or
a mistaken or inadequate allegation or description
in any other respect. (S1 R 10).

Q.

What is the reason for allowing the amendment
of pleadings?

A.

So that the actual merits of the controversy may
speedily be determined, without regard to
technicalities, and in the most expeditious and
inexpensive manner. (Id.).

Q.

What are the kinds of amendments?

A.

Amendments may either be formal or substantial.
A formal amendment is one which seeks to correct
a mere defect in the designation of the parties
and other clearly clerical or typographical error.
Amendments which go beyond such corrections
are substantial.
Formal amendments may be corrected by the
court at any stage of the action, at its initiative or on
motion, provided no prejudice is caused thereby to
the adverse party. Except where the amendment is
a matter of right, a substantial amendment may be
made only upon leave of court. Such leave shall be
refused if it appears to the court that the motion
was made with intent to delay or confer jurisdiction
on the court, or the pleading stated no cause of

360

RULE 10
Amended & Supplemental Pleadings

action from the beginning which could be amended.
(S3 R10, as amended by the 2020 Rules of
Civil Procedure).
Q.

When are amendments a matter of right?

A.

A party may amend his pleading once as a matter
of right at any time before a responsive pleading is
served or, in the case of a reply, at any time within
10 days after it is served. (S2 R10).

Q.

When amendment is a matter of right, should
the pleader file a motion to admit the amended
pleading?

A.

No since it is the ministerial duty of the court
to accept the amended pleading. The pleader
should just file the amended pleading without any
corresponding motion. (Marcos-Araneta v. Court of
Appeals, G.R. No. 154096, 22 August 2008).

Q.

What is the remedy of a party if an amendment
is refused by the court although the same is a
matter of right?

A.

The party may avail of mandamus since it it a
ministerial duty of the court to accept the
amendment made as a matter of right. (MarcosAraneta v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 154096, 22
August 2008; Ong Peng v. Custodio, L-14911, 25
March 1961 ).

Q.

When may the complaint be amended as a
matter of right?

A.

At any time before the answer is served upon the
plaintiff. (S2 R10)

361

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

When may the answer be amended as a matter
of right?

A.

Under the 1997 Rules, an answer may be amended
as a matter of right at any time before the reply,
which is the responsive pleading to an answer, is
served upon the defendant. (Id.) However under
the 2020 Rules, an answer may be responded to by
a reply only if the defendant attaches an actionable
document to the answer.
It is submitted that if no reply is filed by the
plaintiff, the defendant may amend his answer as a
matter of right until the issuance of the pre-trial
order. Thereafter, the answer may no longer be
amended if such amendment would raise an issue
not included in the pretrial order.

Q.

When may the reply be amended as a matter
of right?

A.

Within 10 days after it is served. (Id.)

Q.

F sues his brother G to recover ownership of a
parcel of land but the latter, within the period
for pleading, moves to dismiss based on two
grounds, to wit: first, the suit being between
members of the same family, the complaint
fails to aver that earnest efforts towards a
compromise have been made, and second, the
action is barred by extinctive prescription.
Pending resolution of the motion to
dismiss, F serves notice to take G's deposition,
which the latter opposes, claiming that at this
stage of the proceeding no deposition can be
obtained without leave of court.

362
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 10
Amended & Supplemental Pleadings

Meanwhile, obviously to meet G's objections
in the motion to dismiss still unresolved, F files
an amended complaint seeking this time the
partition of the land between him and his
brother and alleging that earnest efforts at
amicable settlement have been exerted and
have failed.
1)

If you were the trial judge, would you admit
F's amended complaint and deny G's
motion to dismiss despite the latter's
contention that the amendment would result
in a radical change of the cause of action or
theory of the case? Reasons. (79 Bar QS).

A.

1) Yes if I were the trial judge I would admit F's
amended complaint. Under S2 R10 a party
may amend his pleading once as a matter of
right before a responsive pleading is served.
Here no responsive pleading has been served
since a motion to dismiss is not a responsive
pleading. Hence F may amend his complaint as a
matter of right.
Q.

P filed an action for recovery of possession of
land against D before the RTC of Manila. The
complaint did not allege the assessed value of
the land. D filed an answer raising the
affirmative defense of lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction since the action was a real one and
the complaint did not aver the assessed value
of the land involved. P then moved for leave of
court to admit an amended complaint which
alleged that the land had an assessed value of

363

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

P55,000. Should the court grant the motion for
leave to admit the amended complaint?
A.

No. It is axiomatic that if the purpose of the
amendment is to confer jurisdiction upon the court
then the court cannot admit the amended
complaint. This is because the court which does not
have jurisdiction under an original complaint is
without power to admit an amended complaint.
(Rosario v. Carangdang, 96 Phil. 845 [1955]).

Q.

P filed an action for recovery of possession of
land against D before the RTC of Manila. The
complaint did not allege the assessed value of
the land. D filed a motion to dismiss on the
ground of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction
since the action was a real one and the
complaint did not aver the assessed value of
the land involved, P then filed an amended
complaint which alleged that the land had an
assessed vaiue of P55,000. Should the court
grant the motion to dismiss?

A.

No. In tr1is case P may amend his complaint as a
matter of right since a motion to dismiss is not a
responsive pleading. Since the filing of the amended
complaint is a matter of right, there is no power or
discretion that needs to be exercised by the trial
court. Hence the amended complaint supersedes
the original complaint and the trial court would have
jurisdiction by virtue of the amended complaint.
(See Rosario v. Carangdang, supra).

Q.

On 12 May 2005, the plaintiff filed a complaint in
the Regional Trial court of Quezon City for the
collection of P250,000. The defendant filed a
motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground
364

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 10
Amended & Supplemental Pleadings

that the court had no jurisdiction over the
action since the claimed amount of P250,000 is
within the exclusive jurisdictionofthe Metropolitan
Trial Court of Quezon City.
Before the court could resolve the motion,
the plaintiff, without leave of court, amended his
complaint to allege a new cause of action
consisting in the inclusion of an additional
amount of P200,000, thereby increasing his total
claim to P450,000. The plaintiff thereafter filed
his opposition to the motion to dismiss, claiming
that the Regional Trial Court had jurisdiction
over his action. Rule on the motion of the
defendant with reasons. (05 Bar Q9).
A.

The motion to dismiss of the defendant on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction should be denied.
Under the Rules of Civil Procedure, a plaintiff
may amend his complaint as a matter of right before
service of a responsive pleading upon him. The
Rules of Civil Procedure also provide that the
amended pleading supersedes the original pleading.
Here the amendment was a matter of right
since a motion to dismiss is not a responsive
pleading. Hence the amended complaint supersedes
the original complaint and thus the RTC has
jurisdiction. (See Rosario v. Carangdang, supra.).

Q.

Arturo lent P1 Million to his friend Robert on the
condition that Robert execute a promissory
note for the loan and a real estate mortgage
over his property located in Tagaytay City.
Robert complied. In his promissory note dated
20 September 2006, Robert undertook to pay
the loan within a year from its date at 12% per
365

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

annum interest. In June 2007, Arturo requested
Robert to pay ahead of time but the latter
refused and insisted on the agreement. Arturo
issued a demand letter and when Robert did not
comply, Arturo filed an action to foreclose the
mortgage. Robert filed an answer in which he
raised the affirmative defense of failure to state
a cause of action as the debt was not yet due.
On 1 October 2007, Arturo filed a motion for
leave to admit amended complaint alleging that
Robert's debt had in the meantime become due
but that Robert still refused to pay. Should
the amended complaint be allowed? (Based on
08 Bar Q11)
A

No. S3 R10 as amended by the 2020 Rules of Civil
Procedure provides that leave to amend a pleading
shall be refused if the pleading stated no cause of
action from the beginning which could be amended. 54
An amendment is not proper where the purpose is to
cure a complaint which fails to state a cause of action
because of prematurity and where there was a timely
objection by the defendant. (Swagman Hotels v.
Court of Appeals, 8 April 2005). An amendment is not
proper and should be denied if the plaintiff had no
cause of action at the filing of the original complaint
and the purpose of the amendment is to introduce a
subsequently-accrued cause of action. The cause of
action must exist at the time the action was begun,
and the plaintiff will not be allowed by an amendment
or supplemental pleading to introduce a cause of
action which had no existence when the action
was commenced. (Surigao Mine Exploration Co. v.
Harris, 68 Phil. 113).
54

This amendment is a codification of the Swagman Hotels ruling.

Q.

The Iglesia ni Cristo filed a complaint against
Siasocoand CarissaHomesfor specificperformance
and damages wherein the INC prayed that a
deed of sale over the subject parcel of land be
executed in its favor. Carissa filed an answer
while Siasoco filed a motion to dismiss.
Pending the resolution of the motion to dismiss,
Carissa Homes sold the land to the INC. The
INC then filed an amended complaint dropping
Carissa as defendant and changing the nature
of the case to a mere action for damages.
Siasoco filed a motion to strike out the
amended complaint on the ground that it was
filed without leave of court. Should the amended
complaint be expunged from the records?

A.

No. Where some but not all the defendants have
answered, the plaintiff may still amend the
complaint as a matter of right as against the nonanswering defendant or defendants. ( Siasoco v.
Court of Appeals, 303 SCRA 186). Here Siasoco
had not filed an answer. Hence the INC can still
amend the complaint as a matter of right.

Q.

On 10 September 1981, Private Respondents
filed with the CFI of Pasay an action for specific
performance and damages to compel Petitioners
to execute a deed of sale over a parcel of land
in their favor (Civil Case No. 9412). On 16
September 1981, the Private Respondents filed
another case for annulment of sale and damages
against the Petitioners and the Quiazons when
the Private Respondents learned that the land
had been transferred by the Petitioners to the
Quiazons (Civil Case No. 9432). Civil Case No.
9432 was eventually dismissed on the ground
that the Private Respondents had split their

367

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

cause of action. In 1996 after Petitioners had
already filed their answer, the Private Respondents
filed a motion for leave to admit amended
complaint in Civil Case No. 9412. The amendment
consists of changing the nature of the case
from specific performance and damages to
annulment of sale and damages. The Petitioners
opposed the motion on the ground that the
amendment substantially changes cause of
action and the theory of the case. Should the
amended answer be admitted?
A.

Yes. Granting arguendo that the amendment would
change the cause of action and theory of the case, the
clear import of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure,
when it deleted the phrase, "or that the cause of action
or defense is substantially altered," is that the
amendment may now substantially alter the cause of
action or defense. This should however be true when
the amendments sought t9 be made shall serve the
higher interest of justice, prevent delay, and secure a
just, speedy, and inexpensive disposition of every
action or proceeding. In the interest of substantial
justice, the amendment is allowed so as to afford
party-litigants the full and genuine opportunity to
substantiate their respective claims and defenses and
for the court to decide the case on the merits.
(Valenzuela v. CA, 363 SCRA 777 [2001]).

Q.

Respondent WG&A entered into a lease
contract with the Philippine Ports Authority
over a marine slip way in the North Harbor. The
lease contract provides that "the lease of the
area shall take effect on 1 January 2001 to 30
June 2001 or until such time PPA turns over its
operation to the winning bidder in the North
Harbor modernization." Believing that the lease

368
J9JC9B0M

RULE10
Amended & Supplemental Pleadings

contract expired on 30 June 2001 PPA wrote a
letter to Respondent asking it to vacate the
leased premises. Respondent replied that the
lease contract is up to the turn-over of the
premises to the winning bidder but the PPA
insisted on its stand. Respondent thus filed an
action for injunction against PPA. PPA filed its
answer. Then WG&A filed a motion to admit
amended complaint. The amended complaint is
for injunction and reformation of the contract.
PPA opposed the admission of the amended
complaint on the ground that the reformation
sought by Respondent constituted a substantial
amendment which if granted will substantially
alter the Respondent's cause of action and
theory of the case. Should the trial court admit
the amended complaint?

A.

Yes the trial court should admit the amended
complaint. Under the 1964 Rules the court may
grant leave for a substantial amendment "unless
the motion was made with intent to delay the action
or that the cause of action or defense is
substantially altered." The 1997 Rules amended the
old S3 R10 by deleting the phrase "or that the
cause of action or defense is substantially altered."
The clear import of such amendment in S3 R10 is
that under the new Rules the amendment may
substantially alter the cause of action or defense.
(Philippine Ports Authority v. William Gothong and
Aboitiz Inc., G.R. No. 158401, 28 January 2008).

Q.

Plaintiff filed a case against Defendant for
annulment of real estate mortgage. The complaint
states that the Plaintiff was defrauded into
signing the mortgage. During the trial, the Plaintiff
without objection presented evidence that the
369

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

mortgaged property was conjugal property and
that his wife did not give her written conformity
thereto. No amendment of the complaint was
made. May the court render judgment annulling
the mortgage on the ground that the spouse's
written consent was not obtained?
A.

Yes. Under S5 R10, when issues not raised by the
pleadings are tried with the express or implied
consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all
respects as If they had been raised in the
pleadings. No amendment of such pleadings
deemed amended is necessary to cause them to
conform to the evidence. Here the Defendant's
failure to object amounted to an implied consent to
the trial of the issue of lack of spousal consent.

Q.

Same as above but the Defendant timely
objected to the introductionof evidence regarding
lack of spousal consent. How should the court
ruie on the objection?

A

The court should sustain the objection. The second
sentence of S5 R10 which provides that "[i]f
evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that
it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the
court may allow the pleadings to be amended and
shall do with liberality if the presentation of the merits
of the action and the ends of substantial justice will
be subserved thereby" was deleted in the 2020
Rules of Civil Procedure.
Furthermore under S7 R18, the contents of
the pre-trial order shall control the subsequent
proceedings, unless modified before trial to prevent
manifest injustice. Hence such modification of the
pre-trial order cannot be made during the trial.

Q.

A complaint was filed by the counsel for
Superior Sales (an entity without a distinct
juridical personality) against Mr. Garcia on a
money claim for goods delivered. Mr. Garcia
did not file a motion to dismiss. Eventually, trial
was held and his liability was established through
several invoices, each of which uniformly
showed on its face that Mr. Tan is the proprietor
of Superior Sales. After Superior Sales had
rested its case, Mr. Garcia filed a motion to
dismiss on the ground that, since there is
actually no person properly suing as plaintiff,
no relief can be granted by the court. On the
other hand, the counsel for Superior Sales filed
a motion to amend the complaint to make it
conform to the evidence, that the real party
plaintiff is Mr. Tan. The court denied the said
motion on the ground that it was filed too late
and instead, dismissed the case. Did the trial
court act correctly? Explain. (92 Bar Q12).

A.

No, the trial court did not act correctly.
Under the Rules of Civil Procedure, when
issues not raised by the pleadings are tried with the
express or implied consent of the parties, they shall
be treated in all respects as if they had been raised
in the pleadings. No amendment of such pleadings
deemed amended is necessary to casue them to
conform to the evidence. (S5 R10).
Here the issue that Mr. Tan was the real party
in interest was tried with the implied consent of the
parties since Mr. Garcia failed to object to the
presentation of the invoices. Hence there was even
no need to amend the complaint to conform to the
evieence. (Id.).
371

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

Same preliminary facts as in the preceding
problem. However Mr. Garcia filed an answer
raising the defense that the Plaintiff is not a real
party in interest. During the trial, Mr. Garcia
objected to the presentation of the invoices
showing that Mr. Tan is the proprietor of Superior
Sales on the ground that in the pleadings, the
plaintiff is Superior Sales. If you were the judge,
how would you rule on the objection?

A.

If I were the judge, I would sustain the objection on
the ground that it is not within the issues made by
the pleading. Under the 2020 Rules of Civil
Procedure, the portion of S5 R10 which allowed an
amendment to authorize presentation of evidence
where the evidence was objected to on the ground
that it is not within the scope of the pleadings
was deleted.

Q.

During trial, plaintiff was able to present,
without objection on the part of defendant in an
ejectment case, evidence showing that plaintiff
served on defendant a written demand to vacate
the subject property before the commencement
of the suit, a matter not alleged or otherwise set
forth in the pleadings on file. Was the jurisdictional
defect of the complaint cured? Explain. (Based
on 04 Bar Q4a)

A.

Yes the jurisdictional defect of the complaint was
cured.
S5 R 10 provides that when issues not raised by
the pleadings are tried with the express or implied
consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all
respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings

372

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 10
Amended & Supplemental Pleadings

and no amendment of the pleading is necessary to
cause them to conform to the evidence.
Here the issue regarding the written demand to
vacate was tried with the implied consent of the
parties due to the defendant's failure to object.
Hence the complaint was deemed amended to
include an allegation regarding the written demand
to vacate.
Here the amendment of the complaint took
place by operation of law under S5 R10. Hence the
amended complaint superseded the original complaint
and jurisdiction was thus acquired by the court.
Q.

Plaintiff filed an accion publiciana before the
RTC against the defendant. The complaint did
not contain any allegation regarding the assessed
value of the subject land. The defendant's motion
to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction
was denied and the trial court rendered decision
in favor of the plaintiff. On appeal, the plaintiffappellee annexed to his brief the tax declaration
of the property showing that it had an assessed
value of more than PS0,000. No objection was
interposed by the defendant-appellant. The
defendant argued that the trial court did not
acquire jurisdiction because of the failure to
allege the assessed value of the land. The
plaintiff countered that in accordance with S5
R10, the lack of jurisdiction was cured by the
introduction of the tax declaration without
objection by the defendant. Was the lack of
jurisdiction cured by the introduction of the
tax declaration?

373

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

No. The plaintiffs invocation of S5 R10 to support
his claim that failure of the defendant to object to
his presentation of the tax declaration before the
CA constitutes an implied amendment is misplaced.
Such rule contemplates an amendment to conform
to or authorize presentation of evidence before the
trial court during the trial on the merits of the case.
Here plaintiff presented the tax declaration to
prove the assessed value of the property for the first
time on appeal before the CA in his brief. There was
no proof or allegation that he presented the same
during the trial or that the court examined such
document. Since the tax declaration was never duly
identified by testimony during the trial albeit
incorporated in the appellee' s brief, the CA will not be
required to review such document that was not
previously scrutinized by the RTC. As the assessed
value is a jurisdictional requirement, the belated
presentation of document proving such value before
the appellate court will not cure the glaring defect in
the complaint. Thus, jurisdiction was not acquired.
(Cabrera v. Clarin, 28 Nov 2016, Peralta, J.)

Q.

In the trial of a homicide case, the fiscal was
able to prove treachery and evident premeditation
without objection on the part of the defense. By
reason thereof, the fiscal moved to amend the
information invoking the provisions of the

pleadings to conform to the evidence. He then
filed an amended information changing the
homicide to that of murder which, however, was
vehemently objected to by the defense.
(A)

amend. (85 Bar Q9).
374

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 10
Amended & Supplemental Pleadings

XXX

A.

(A) The fiscal's motion to amend the information
should be denied. The provisions of S5 R 10 do not
apply to criminal cases which are specifically
governed by S 14 R 110 under which a substantial
amendment can no longer be made after the
accused had pleaded.
Here the amendment is substantial as it seeks
to change the nature of the offense charged and
the accused had already pleaded since the case
had already reached the trial stage. Hence the
motion should be denied.

Q.

Plaintiff sued Defendant for collection of the
purchase price of a land in the amount of
P2,200,000. Defendant in her answer stated that
she had paid P2 million and therefore owes the
Plaintiff only P200,000. During the trial, Defendant,
without objection, presented a receipt showing
payment of the P200,000. Nor did the Plaintiff
object to the admissibility of the receipt when it
was formally offered. The trial court rendered
judgment dismissing the case stating that
Defendant had fully paid her obligation. On
appeal, Defendant contends that the trial court
erred in considering the evidence of payment
since there was a judicial admission by
Defendant that she still owes P200,000. Is the
Defendant's contention correct?

A.

No. It is noteworthy that when Defendant presented
the evidence of payment, Plaintiff did not object
thereto. When the receipt was formally offered as
evidence, Plaintiff did not manifest their objection to
the admissibility of said document on the ground

375

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

that payment was not an issue. Since there was an
implied consent on the part of Plaintiff to try the
issue of payment, the RTC cannot be faulted for
admitting respondent's testimonial and documentary
evidence to prove payment. (Dela Cruz v.
Concepcion, 11 October 2012, Peralta, J.).
Q.

What is a supplemental pleading?

A.

It is one setting forth transactions, occurrences or
events (TOE) which have happened since the date
of the pleading sought to be supplemented. Upon
motion and upon reasonable notice and such terms
as are just, the court may permit a party to serve a
supplemental pleading. (S6 R10).

Q.

In November 1989, Petitioner Superclean
Services Corporation filed with the RTC a
complaint for "mandamus/certiorari" seeking to
compel the Home Development & Mutual Fund
to award the 1990 janitorial contract to Petitioner
as the lowest bidder. HDMF filed an answer
alleging that Petitioner did not qualify as a
bidder. In 1991 Petitioner moved for the admission
of a "supplemental complaint" alleging that the
delay in the case had rendered it moot and
academic and accordingly instead of pursuing
its prayer for mandamus, it was now seeking
damages. The trial court denied the motion to
admit the "supplemental complaint." Was it
proper for Petitioner to supplement its complaint?

A.

No. The supervening event was cited not to reinforce
or aid the original demand but to change the relief
sought to one for recovery of damages. Hence
Petitioner's remedy was not to supplement but rather
to amend its complaint. Indeed the new relief sought

376
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 10
Amended & Supplemental Pleadings

is actually an alternative remedy to which Petitioner
was entitled at the time of the filing of its original
complaint. (Superc/ean Services Corp. v. Court of
Appeals, 258 SCRA 165 [1997]). Nonetheless the
trial court should simply have allowed the Plaintiff to
file a motion to admit amended complaint rather than
denying outright the motion to admit supplemental
complaint. (See Superclean Services Corp. v. Court
of Appeals, supra).
Q.

P filed a complaint for damages against D for
breach of contract. In his complaint, P alleged that
D completed only ¾ of the house he undertook to
construct. Subsequently P amended his complaint
by alleging that D completed only ½ of the house.
Trial was held and thereafter the parties submitted
their evidence. The original complaint was not
marked and offered in evidence. May the court in
rendering its decision take into consideration
P's statement in the original complaint that D
completed¾ of the house?

A.

No. An amended pleading supersedes the pleading
that it amends. Hence admissions in the superseded
pleadings are merely extrajudicial admissions and
still need to be offered in evidence if a party
decides to use them. (Ching v. Court of Appeals,
331 SCRA 16). D should have offered the original
complaint in evidence.

Q.

In an action for reconveyance of a parcel of land
filed in the Regional Trial Court, the defendant,
through his lawyer, filed an answer therein
admitting the averment in the complaint that
the land was acquired by the plaintiff through
inheritance from his parents, the former
owners thereof.

377

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Subsequently, the defendant changed his
lawyer and, with leave of court, amended
the answer. In the amended answer, the
abovementioned admission no longer appears;
instead, the alleged ownership of the land by
the plaintiff was denied coupled with the
allegation that the defendant is the owner of the
land for the reason that he bought the same
from the plaintiff's parents during their lifetime.
After trial, the Regional Trial Court rendered
a decision upholding the defendant's ownership
of the land.
On appeal, the plaintiff contended that the
defendant is bound by the admission contained
in his original answer. Is the contention of
plaintiff correct? Why? (93 Bar Q4)
A.

No, the contention of plaintiff is not correct.
Under S8 R10, an amended pleading
supersedes the pleading that it amends. Hence the
admissions in the superseded pleading cease to be
judicial admissions and may not be considered by
the court unless offered in evidence.

RULE 11
When To File Responsive Pleadings

MOTION TO DISMISS/MOTION FOR
BILL OF PARTICULARS DENIED
Balance of period under R 11 but in no case
less than 5 days. (S4 R16 1997 Rules of Civil
Procedure, 56 S5 R12).
Q.

Summons was served upon the defendant on 1
March. The Defendant filed a motion to dismiss
on 25 March. The Defendant received the order
denying his motion to dismiss on 1 April. Up to
when may the Defendant file his answer?

A.

Up to 8 April. The Defendant had until March 31 to
file his answer, so that when he filed his motion to
dismiss on March 25, he had 7 days remaining.
The day of the act causing the interruption (March
25) is excluded from the computation, that is,
defendant is not deemed to have consumed the
same. 57 Thus the allowable period after the
interruption or the remaining period is seven days
(March 25 to March 31 ). When the Defendant
received notice of the cessation of the cause of
interruption on April 1, the allowable period started
to run on the next day (April 2 up to April 8). One
may simply add the remaining period to the day of
notice of cessation: April 1 + 7 days= April 8.

6There is no equivalent provision in the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure on
the time to plead an answer if a motion to dismiss is denied. In such a case the
relevant provision in the 1997 Rules, i.e., S4 R16 should govern. Another view is
that the movant would have only the balance to file the answer, citing S2 R22.

Q.

When may a reply be filed?

A.

A reply, if allowed under S10 R6, may be filed
within 15 days from service of the answer. (S6 R11,
S10 R6).

Q.

May the period to file a pleading be extended?

A.

A defendant may, for meritorious reasons, be
granted an additional period of not more than 30
days to file an answer. A defendant is allowed to
file only one motion for extension of time to file
an answer.
A motion for extension to file any pleading,
other than an answer, is prohibited and considered
a mere scrap of paper. The court, however, may
allow any other pleading to be filed after the time
fixed by these Rules. (S11 R11, as amended in the
2020 Rules of Civil Procedure). 58

RULE 12. BILL OF PARTICULARS
Q.

What is the remedy of a party if the adverse
party's pleading contain allegations which are
not averred with sufficient definiteness or
particularity so that he cannot properly prepare
his responsive pleading?

A.

He may file a motion for a bill of particulars. Note
however that if the pleading is not only indefinite or
ambiguous but fails to state a cause of action, the
remedy of the party is to file a motion to dismiss on
the ground that the pleading states no cause
of action.

Q.

What is a bill of particulars?

A.

A bill of particulars is a definite statement of any
matter which is not averred with sufficient
definiteness or particularity in a pleading so as to
enable the opposing party to properly prepare his
responsive pleading. (S1 R12). A bill of particulars
becomes a part of the pleading for which it is
intended. (S6 R12).

Q.

Within what time may a motion for a bill of
particulars be filed?

A.

Within the time to file a responsive pleading
under R11.

Q.

Does the filing of a motion for a bill of particulars
stay the period to file responsive pleadings?

A.

Yes. After service of the bill of particulars or after
notice of denial of his motion, the movant may file
his responsive pleading within the period to which
he was entitled at the time of filing his motion,
383

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

which shall not be less than 5 days in any event.
(S5 R12).

Q.

Within what time shall the order requiring
a pleader to file a bill of particulars be complied
with?

A.

The compliance therewith must be effected within
10 days from notice of the order, unless a different
period is fixed by the court. The bill of particulars
may be filed either in a separate pleading or in an
amended pleading. (S3 R12).

Q.

What is the effect on non-compliance or
insufficient compliance with the order requiring
the filing of a bill of particulars?

A.

The court may order the striking out of the pleading
or the portions thereof to which the order was
directed or make such other order as it deems just.
(S4 R 12). For instance a court may pursuant to S3
R17 dismiss the plaintiff's complaint if he fails to
comply with an order requiring the filing of a bill
of particulars.

J9JC9B0M

RULE 13. FILING & SERVICE OF
PLEADINGS, JUDGMENTS
& OTHER PAPERS
Q.

Distinguish filing from service of pleadings and
other papers.

A.

Filing is the act of submitting the pleading or other
paper to the court, while service is the act of
providing a party with a copy of the pleading or any
other court submission. (S2 R13).

Q.

How is service made upon a party who has
appeared by counsel?

A

Service is the act of providing a party with a copy of
the pleading or any other court submission. If a
party has appeared by counsel, service upon such
party shall be made upon his counsel or one of
them, unless service upon the party and the party's
counsel is ordered by the court. Where one counsel
appears for several parties, such counsel shall only
be entitled to one copy of any paper served by the
opposite side. (S2 R13 as amended in the 2020
Rules of Civil Procedure).
Where several counsels appear for one party,
such party shall be entitled to only one copy of any
pleading or paper to be served upon the lead counsel
if one is designated, or upon any one of them if there
is no designation of a lead counsel. (S2 R13, as
added in 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure).
Note however that a request for admission
must be served on the party himself, not his
counsel. (Lanada v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No.
102390, 1 February 2002).

Doctrine of actual notice
Q.

Plaintiff filed a complaint for legal redemption
against the Defendant. Upon motion, the court
dismissed the complaint (first dismissal order).
The Plaintiff (but not his lawyer) received the
first dismissal order on 23 April 2003. On 8 May
2003 the Plaintiff through counsel moved for
reconsideration. Meanwhile the Plaintiff's lawyer
received the first dismissal order on 15 May
2003. The Plaintiff then received on 23 May 2003
a copy of the order denying the motion for
reconsideration on the ground that it lacked a
notice of hearing. On 27 May 2003 Plaintiff filed
a notice of appeal with the court. The court
denied the order for having been filed more
than 15 days from 23 April and that the motion
for reconsideration did not toll the period to
appeal since it was a mere scrap of paper for
lack of a notice of hearing. The Plaintiff on the
other hand argued that the period to appeal
should have been reckoned from service on the
counsel on 15 May 2003 and not from 23 April
2003 Was the notice of appeal filed on time?

A.

No. The general rule is that where a party is
represented by counsel, service should be made
upon the counsel and not the party himself and that
the reglementary period should be reckoned from
service upon the counsel. Nonetheless appeal here
should be reckoned not from the formal notice to
counsel but upon actual notice to him. Here it
cannot be denied that Plaintiff's counsel had actual
notice of the first dismissal order on 8 May 2003 at
the latest when he filed a motion for reconsideration
thereof. Hence the 15 day period to appeal should

386

J9JC9B0M

RULE 13
Filing & Service Of Pleadings,
Judgments & Other Papers

be reckoned from 8 May 2003 and not 15 May
2003. The notice to appeal should have been filed
th
on or before 23 May 2003 (15 da~ from 8 May
2003) rather than 30 May 2003 ( 15t day from 15
May 2003). (Hema/ v. De Guzman, G.R. No.
181568, 26 June 2008).
Q.

The Republic, as represented by the Office of
the Solicitor General, filed a complaint for
cancellation of title and reconveyance with the
RTC. The OSG entered its appearance and
deputized Atty. Artemio C. Legaspi and the
members of the LRA legal staff to appear in the
case, with the OSG exercising supervision and
control over its deputized counsel. The OSG
also requested that notices of hearings, orders,
decisions and other processes be served on
both the OSG and the deputized counsel. The
Notice of Appearance, however, stated that "only
notices of orders, resolutions, and decisions
served on him will bind the party represented."
Subsequently, Atty. Alexander N.V. Acosta
(Atty. Acosta) of the LRA entered his appearance
as deputized LRA lawyer, pursuant to the OSG
Letter dated August 7, 2001. The letter also
contained the statement, "only notices of orders,
resolutions and decisions served on him will
bind the [Republic], the entity, agency and/or
official represented." The notice of pretrial was
sent to the OSG but not to the deputized
counsel Atty. Acosta. Atty. Acosta thus failed to
appear during the trial for which reason the
case was dismissed with prejudice. Is notice to
the OSG binding upon the Republic?

387

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

Yes. The OSG's deputized counsel is "no more
than the 'surrogate' of the Solicitor General in any
particular proceeding" and the latter remains the
principal counsei entitled to be furnished copies of
all court orders, notices, and decisions. In this case,
records show that it was the OSG that first entered
an appearance in behalf of the Republic; hence, it
remains the principal counsel of record. The
appearance of the deputized counsel did not divest
the OSG of control over the case and did not make
the deputized special attorney the counsel of
record. Thus, the RTC properly acted within bounds
when it relied on the rule that it is the notice to the
OSG that is binding, (Republic v. Viaje, 27 January
2016, Reyes, J.). 59

Q.

What papers are required to be filed and served?

A.

Every judgment,
resolution, order, pleading
subsequent to the complaint, written motion, notice,
appearance, demand, offer of judgment or similar
papers shall be flied with the court and served upon
the parties affected. (S4 R13).

Q.

Are ex-parte written motions required to be
served on the parties affected?

A.

Yes although they need not be set for hearing.
However ex-parte motions for preliminary attachment,
temporary restraining order, replevin, or receivership
need not be s@rved on the adverse party if such
service would compromise the efficacy of these
provisional remedies.

59
Nonetheless, because of the special circumstances of the case, that is, a
342,000-square••meter land alleged to be part of the public domain, the SC
relaxed the rule on notice and reversed the dismissal of the complaint.

RULE 13
Filing & Service Of Pleadings,
Judgments & Other Papers

Q.

What are the four modes of filing pleadings and
other papers and when are they considered filed?

A.

The filing of pleadings and other court submissions
shall be made by:
(a)

Submitting personally the original thereof,
plainly indicated as such, to the court;

(b)

Sending them by registered mail;

(c)

Sending them by accredited courier; or

(d)

Transmitting them by electronic mail or other
electronic means as may be authorized by
the Court in places where the court is
electronically equipped. 60

In (a), the clerk of court shall endorse on the
pleading the date and hour of filing. In (b) and (c),
the date of the mailing of motions, pleadings, and
other court submissions, and payments or deposits,
as shown by the post office stamp on the envelope
or the registry receipt, shall be considered as the
date of their filing, payment, or deposit in court.61
The envelope shall be attached to the record of the
case. In (d), the date of electronic transmission
shall be considered as the date of filing. (S3 R13,
as amended by the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure).
Q.

May a pleading be filed by ordinary mail?

A.

No. Pleadings may only be personally filed, filed by
registered mail or accredited courier, or by electronic
mail or other electronic means. (S3 R13).
60

1tappears that filing by facsimile transmission is not allowed.
There is no mention of how sending by courier service is deemed filed
and how this is shown. This appears to be an inadvertent omission. One may
reasonably assume that the date of deposit to the courier for mailing, as shown
by the acknowledgment receipt of the courier, is deemed to be the date of filing.
61

389

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

Q.

What are the modes of service of pleadings?

A.

Pleadings, motions, notices, orders, judgments, and
other court submissions shall be served personally
or by registered mail, accredited courier, electronic
mail, facsimile transmission, other electronic means
as may be authorized by the Court, or as provided
for in international conventions to which the
Philippines is a party. (S5 R13 as amended by the
2020 Rules of Civil Procedure).

Q.

How is personal service made?

A.

Court submissions may be served by personal
delivery of a copy to the party or to the party's
counsel, or to their authorized representative
named in the appropriate pleading or motion, or by
leaving it in his office with his clerk, or with a person
having charge thereof. If no person is found in his
office, or his office is not known, or he has no
office, then by leaving the copy, between the hours
of eight in the morning and six in the evening, at the
party's or counsel's residence, if known, with a
person of sufficient age and discretion residing
therein. (S6 R13, as amended by the 2020 Rules of
Civil Procedure).

Q.

How is service by mail made?

A.

Service by registered mail shall be made by
depositing the copy in the post office, in a sealed
envelope, plainly addressed to the party or to the
party's counsel at his office, if known, otherwise at
his residence, if known, with postage fully pre-paid,
and with instructions to the postmaster to return the
mail to the sender after ten days if undelivered. If
no registry service is available in the locality of
390

J9JC9B0M

RULE 13
Filing & Service Of Pleadings,
Judgments & Other Papers

either the sender or the addressee, service may be
done by ordinary mail. (S7 R13).
Q.

What is substituted service and when may it be
resorted to?

A.

If personal service or service by mail cannot be
made, the office and place of residence of the party
or his counsel being unknown, service may be
made by delivering the copy to the clerk of court,
with proof of failure of both personal service and
service by mail. (S8 R13).

Q.

When and how is service by electronic means
and facsimile made?

A.

Service by electronic means and facsimile shall be
made if the party concerned consents to such
modes of service.
Service by electronic means shall be made by
sending an e-mail to the party's or counsel's
electronic mail address, or through other electronic
means of transmission as the parties may agree on,
or upon direction of the court.
Service by facsimile shall be made by sending
a facsimile copy to the party's or counsel's given
facsimile number. (S9 R13, as added in the 2020
Rules of Civil Procedure).

Q.

What shall a party do if he changes his
electronic mail address or facsimile number
while the action is pending?

A.

The party must promptly file, within 5 days from
such change, a notice of change of e-mail address
or facsimile number with the court and serve the
notice on all other parties.

Service through the electronic mail address or
facsimile number of a party shall be presumed valid
unless such party notifies the court of any change,
as aforementioned. (S11 R13, as added in the
2020 Rules of Civil Procedure).
Q.

Do the rules prescribe a format for electronic
mail and facsimile?

A.

Yes. The subject of the electronic mail and facsimile
must follow the prescribed format: case number,
case title and the pleading, order or document title.
The title of each electronically-filed or served
pleading or other document, and each submission
served by facsimile shall contain sufficient
information to enable the court to ascertain from the
title: (a) the party or parties filing or serving the
paper, (b) nature of the paper, (c) the party or
parties against whom relief, if any, is sought, and
(d) the nature of the relief sought. (S12 R13, as
added in the 2020 Rules of Civil Pmcedure ).

Q.

Is there a presumption regarding service of
notice to a party of a court setting?

A.

Yes. Under S10 R13, a new provision under the
2020 Rules of Civil Procedure, there shall be
presumptive notice to a party of a court setting if
such notice appears on the records to have been
mailed at least 20 days prior to the scheduled date
of hearing and if the addressee is from within the
judicial region, or at least 30 days if the addressee
is from outside the judicial region.
The purpose of the new provision is to
minimize delays caused by cancellation and
rescheduling of court settings, even if the other

392

RULE 13
Filing & Service Of Pleadings,
Judgments & Other Papers

party was absent, where there was no proof of
service upon such other party.
Q.

How are judgments, final orders or resolutions
served?

A.

Judgments, final orders or resolutions shall be
served either personally or by registered mail.
Upon ex parte motion of any party in the case, a
copy of the judgment, final order, or resolution may.
be delivered by accredited courier at the expense
of such party. When a party summoned by
publication has failed to appear in the action,
judgments, final orders or resolutions against him
shall be served upon him a/so by publication at the
expense of the prevailing party. (S13 R13).
Justice Feria believes that if a party served
with summons subsequently absconds and his
present address is unknown, the court may order
that judgments, final orders or resolutions shall be
served upon him by publication. (JOSE Y. FERIA,
1997 RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 45 [1997]).

Q.

Plaintiff filed a complaint for judicial foreclosure
against Defendant. A judgment on the pleadings
sent by registered mail was received on 15
March 2002 by the security guard at the building
where the Defendant's counsel held office but
the judgment was received by the Defendant's
counsel only on 13 June 2002. The Defendant's
counsel filed a notice of appeal the next day but
this was not given due course by the RTC which
said that the notice of appeal was filed out of
time since it was filed more than 15 days from
15 March 2002. Was the notice of appeal filed
~
out of time?
393

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

Yes. Service of judgment on security guard of
building where counsel's office is located is valid
and binding. Counsel should devise system to
ensure prompt receipt of official communications
and cannot hide behind the security guard's
negligence. (Mendoza v. Court of Appeals, 15 July
2015, Perez, J.).

Q.

If a party is resorting to modes of service or filing
other than personal, should the pleading or paper
be accompanied by a written explanation why
the service or filing was not done personally?

A.

No longer. The provision of S 11 R13 (priorities in
modes of service and filing) under the 1997 Rules
of Civil Procedure which required such a written
explanation was no longer incorporated in the 2020
Rules of Civil Procedure.

Q.

What orders, pleadings, and other documents
must be served or filed personally or by
registered mail when allowed?

A.

The following orders, pleadings, and other
documents must be served or filed personally or by
registered mail when allowed, and shall not be
served or filed electronically, unless express
permission is granted by the Court: (CASI)
a)

Initiatory pleadings and initial responsive
pleadings, such as an answer;

b)

Subpoenae, protection orders, and writs:

c)

Q.

What is the proof of service of pleadings and
papers?

A.

PERSONAL SERVICE. Proof of personal service
shall consists of a written admission of the party
served, or the official return of the server, or the
affidavit of the party serving, containing a full
statement of the date, place and manner of service.
(S17 R13). If there is written acknowledgment
of receipt by the party served, an affidavit of service
is no longer necessary, since the written
acknowledgment is in effect a written admission.
SERVICE BY ORDINARY MAIL. Affidavit of
the person mailing of facts showing compliance
with S7 R13.
SERVICE BY REGISTERED MAIL. Affidavit of
the person mailing showing compliance with S7
R13 and the registry receipt issued by the mailing
office. The registry return card shall be filed
immediately upon its receipt by the sender, or in
lieu thereof the unclaimed letter together with the
certified or sworn copy of the notice given by the
postmaster to the addressee.
ACCREDITED COURIER SERVICE. Proof
shall be made by an affidavit of service executed by
the person who brought the pleading or paper to

Q.

What is a notice of lis pendens?

A.

It is a notice of the pendency of a real action which

office of the registry of deeds where the property
subject of the action is situated

Q.

What is the purpose of a notice of lis pendens?

A.

To serve as constructive notice to those not parties
to the case that the real property is the subject of a
pending litigation. (S19 R13).

Q.

May a notice of lis pendens be cancelled?

A.

Yes, in the following cases:
1)

Upon order of court after proper showing that
the notice is for the purpose of molesting the
adverse party, or that it is not necessary to

protect the rights of the party who cause it to be
recorded. (S19 R13).
2)

By the register of deeds, upon verified petition
of the party who caused its registration. (Sec.
77, PD 1529).

3) After final judgment in favor of the defendant or
other disposition of the action such as to
terminate finally all rights of the plaintiff in and
to the land and/or building involved, upon the
registration with the register of deeds of a
certificate of the clerk of court in which the
action or proceeding was pending stating the
manner of disposal thereof. (Id.).
Q.

May a notice of lis pendens be registered in
respect of unregistered property?

notice of lis pendens shall be recorded by
annotation on the space provided therefore in the
Registration Book.

RULE 14. SERVICE OF SUMMONS
Q.

Define summons and give its object or purpose.

A.

It is a mandate requiring the appearance of said
defendant in an action under penalty of having
judgment entered against him for failure so to do.
The object of the summons is to notify the
defendant that he has been sued. (STEVEN GIFIS,
LAW DICTIONARY [1975]).

Q.

What is the effect of service of summons upon
the defendant?

A.

By the service of summons, the court acquires
jurisdiction over the person of the defendant. Note
however that under S17 R14, service of summons
only confers jurisdiction over the res and not over
the person of the defendant.

Q.

How does a court acquire jurisdiction over the
person of the defendant?

A.

Either by service of summons or by the defendant's
voluntary appearance. Under S23 R14 the defendant's
voluntary appearance in the action shall be
equivalent to service of summons.

Q.

When is the summons issued?

A.

Unless the complaint is on its face dismissible under
S1 R9, the court shall, within five days from receipt
of the initiatory pleading and proof of payment of the
requisite legal fees, direct the clerk of court to issue
the corresponding summons to the defendants.

d) A notice that unless the defendant so answers,
plaintiff will take judgment by default and may
be granted the relief applied for. Note that
under S3 R9, judgment by default may be
rendered even without reception of evidence.
A copy of the complaint and order for
appointment of guardian ad Iitem, if any, shall
be attached to the original and each copy of
the summons.

Q.

What is the effect of failure to attach a copy of
the complaint to the summons?

A.

The defendant must nevertheless appear and
apprise the court of this defect; the court can then
simply furnish him with a copy of the complaint and
give him a new time to answer. Otherwise he may
be declared in default and judgment rendered
against him and he may not be heard to complain.

Who are the persons who may serve summons?

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

The summons may be served by the sheriff, his
deputy, or other proper court officer, and in case of
failure of service of summons by them, the court
may authorize the plaintiff to serve the summons
together with the sheriff.
There is failure of service after unsuccessful
attempts to personally serve the summons on the
defendant in his address indicated in the complaint.
Substituted service should be in the manner
62
provided under S3 R14.
In cases where summons is to be served
outside the judicial region of the court where the
case is pending, the plaintiff shall be authorized to
cause the service of summons.
If the plaintiff is a juridical entity, it shall notify the
court, in writing, and name its authorized
representative therein, attaching a board resolution or
secretary's certificate thereto, as the case may be,
stating that such representative is duiy authorized to
serve the summons on behalf of the plaintiff.
If the plaintiff misrepresents that the defendant
was served summons, and it is later proved that no
summons was served, the case shall be dismissed
with prejudice, the proceedings shall be nullified, and
the plaintiff shall be meted appropriate sanctions.
If summons is returned without being served
on any or all the defendants, the court shall order
the plaintiff to cause the service of summons by
other means available under the Rules.

Failure to comply with the order shall cause
the dismissal of the initiatory pleading without
prejudice. (S3 R 14, as amended in the 2020 Rules
of Civil Procedure).
Q.

Is summons required to serve an amended
complaint?

A.

It depends on two factors. First, whether or not the
amended complaint changes the cause of action or
introduces a new cause or causes of action.
Second, whether or not the defendant had already
voluntarily appeared in the action.
If the amended complaint does not change the
cause of action or introduce a new cause or causes
of action, there is no need to serve summons on the
amended complaint. (De Dias v. Court of Appeals,
212 SCRA 519 [1992]; Pan-Asiatic Travel Corp. v.
Court of Appeals, 164 SCRA 623 [1988], 1 MANUEL
V. MORAN, COMMENTS ON THE RULES OF
COURT 362 [1979 ed.]). Thus if the amended
complaint merely set forth the promissory note on
which the complaint was based, no summons is
needed to serve the amended complaint. (Ong Peng
v. Custodio, L-14911, 25 March 1961). The amended
complaint can simply be filed and served as in the
case of any other pleading. (Id.).
If the defendant had voluntarily appeared in court
(e.g., by filing a motion to dismiss or an answer or
motion for extension of time to file answer without
invoking lack of personal jurisdiction), there is no
need for summons to serve the amended complaint,
even if the amended complaint changes the cause of
action or introduces a new cause or causes of action.

Q.

P filed a complaint to collect an unpaid loan of
P500,000 from D. Summons and copy of the
complaint was served upon D. P then filed and
served upon D an amended complaint changing,
after a recomputation, the amount of the unpaid
loan from P500,000 to PG00,000. No summons
was issued to serve the amended complaint.
Upon P's motion the court rendered a default
judgment for PG00,000 against D. May the
default judgment be set aside on the ground
that there was no service of summons on the
amended complaint?

A.

No. The rule is that it is only when new causes of
action are alleged in an amended complaint filed
before the defendant has appeared in court that
another summons must be served on the defendant
with the amended complaint. (De Dias v. Court of
Appeals, 212 SCRA 519 [1992]). Here the cause of
action remained the same, the amendment consisting
of a mere correction. Hence the judgment of the
court is valid.

Q.

When an additional defendant is impleaded in a
later pleading, it is necessary to serve summons
upon him?

A.

Yes in order to obtain jurisdiction over his person.
The service upon him of a copy of the court order
admitting the later pleading together with a copy
thereof is not the process required for bringing him
to court. (Fetalino v. Sanz, 44 Phil. 691 ).

Q.

How is personal service on the defendant made?

A.

Whenever practicable, the summons shall be
served by handing a copy thereof to the defendant
in person and informing the defendant that he is
being served, or, if he refuses to receive and sign
for it, by leaving the summons within the view and
in the presence of the defendant. (S5 R14, as

that the process server should have served the
summons at their residence as indicated in the
complaint. Are the Moguls correct?

A.

No. S5 R14 does not require that the service of
summons on the defendant in person must be
effected only at the latter's residence as stated in
the summons. In other words, personal service of
summons may be made in any place where the
defendant may be found. (Sansio v. Sps. Mogul, 14

days from issue and receipt of summons, be served
personally after at least three attempts on two
separate dates. (S6 R14, S20 R14).63

Q.

How is substituted service of summons effected?

Substituted serviced may be effected by:
a)

18 years of age and of sufficient discretion
residing therein;

b)

By leaving copies of the summons at the

with some competent person in charge thereof.
A competent person includes, but not limited to,
one who customarily receives correspondences
for the defendant;

c)

By leaving copies of the summons, if refused

Q.

P filed a collection case against D with the RTC
of Quezon City. The sheriff went to D's
residence in Paranaque, waited for ten minutes
and saw two young ladies arrive by tricycle.
When advised by them that D was not around,
the sheriff left a copy of the summons with one
of them who was indicated in the return as
"Josephine Areola." It turned out that Areola
was just a guest of D's maid and was only 11
years old. The return does not show impossibility
of personal service within a reasonable time.
The court declared D in default and rendered a
judgment by default against D. Nine days later
D filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of
jurisdiction over their persons.
a) Was there a valid service of summons?
b) Should the motion to dismiss be granted?
The trial court denied the motion to dismiss.
D's motion for reconsideration was denied. The
trial court then issued a writ of execution. D
filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 with

A.
a)

No there was no valid service of summons.
Before substituted service may be effected,

406

RULE 14
Service Of Summons

there must have been at least three attempts
on two separate dates. Here the sheriff
resorted to substituted service on his first - and only - - attempt to effect personal service.
b) Yes. If a defendant had not been properli
summoned, the period to file a motion to dismiss
for lack of jurisdiction over his person does not
commence to run until he voluntarily submits to
the jurisdiction of the court, since the court has
no jurisdiction to adjudicate the controversy as
to him until such time. Here D did not voluntarily
submit to the jurisdiction of the trial court.
Consequently the period to file a responsive
pleading did not even commence to run.
c)

No. Since the trial court did not validly acquire
jurisdiction over the person of D, the judgment
issued by it is null and void. It is axiomatic that
a void judgment cannot become final and
executory and may be assailed or impugned at
any time. An action to declare the nullity of a
void judgment does not prescribe. (Laus v.
Court of Appeals, 219 SCRA 688). What would
only bar the action to annul the judgment would
be estoppel or laches. (Ang Ping v. Court of
Appeals, 310 SCRA 34).

Q.

Is there a need for strict compliance with the
requirements of substituted service or would
substantial compliance suffice?

A.

There must be strict compliance. Since substitute!
service is in derogation of the common law and is
extraordinary in character, it must be used only as
prescribed and in the circumstances authorized by
statute. Statutes prescribing modes other than
407

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

personal service of summons must be strictly
complied with to give the court jurisdiction, and
such compliance must appear affirmatively in the
return. (Laus v. Court of Appeals, 219 SCRA 688).
Q.

What does "person of sufficient discretion" in
S6 R14 mean?

A.

A person of sufficient discretion is considered to
have enough discernment to understand the
importance of a summons. "Discretion" is defined
as "the ability to make decisions which represent a
responsible choice and for which an understanding
of what is lawful, right or wise may be
presupposed". Thus, to be of sufficient discretion,
such person must know how to read and
understand English to comprehend the import of
the summons, and fully realize the need to deliver
the summons and complaint to the defendant at the
earliest possible time for the person to take
appiOpriate action. Thus, the peiSon must have the
"relation of confidence" to the defendant, ensuring
that the latter would receive or at least be notified of
the receipt of the summons. The sheriff must
therefore determine if the person found in the
alleged dwelling or residence of defendant is of
legal age, what the recipient's relationship with the
defendant is, and whether said person comprehends
the significance of the receipt of the summons and
his duty to immediately deliver it to the defendant or
at least notify the defendant of said receipt of
summons. These matters must be clearly and
specifically described in the Return of Summons.
(Manotoc v. Court of Appeals, 16 August 2006).

in

charge

RULE 14
Service Of Summons

A.

If the substituted service will be done at defendant's
office or regular place of business, then it should be
served on a competent person in charge of the
place. Thus, the person on whom the substituted
service will be made must be the one managing the
office or business of defendant, such as the
president or manager; and such individual must
have sufficient knowledge to understand the
obligation of the defendant in the summons, its
importance, and the prejudicial effects arising from
inaction on the summons. Again, these details must
be contained in the Return. (Id.).

Q.

The process server served summons and
copies of the complaint upon Ms. Charlotte
Magpayo, the Property Custodian at Nation
Petroleum, where the Defendants regularly hold
office. May the Property Custodian be considered
as a "competent person in charge" of Nation
Petroleum on whom substituted service may
be made?

A.

No. A "competent person in charge" refers to one
managing the office or the business, such as the
president, manager, or the officer-in-charge. The
rule presupposes the existence of a relation of
confidence between such person and the defendant.
Charlotte Magpayo is a Property Custodian at
Nation Petroleum. Her position denotes limited
responsibility to office equipment, inventory, and
supplies. Plaintiff did not submit any evidence that
Magpayo's job description includes the management
of Nation Petroleum's Makati office. She cannot be
considered as the competent person in charge of
the defendants' business or office. (Ang v. Chinatrust

GSP Inc. filed a collection case against Consar
Trading Corporation (CTC), its President, R.
Consulta, and its Vice President, N. Sarayba,
before the RTC. As the sheriff failed to serve
the summons and copies of the complaint on
any of CTC's authorized officers as well as on
Consulta and Sarayba, he left copies of such
documents with Agnes Canave (Canave) who,
according to the sheriff's return, was Sarayba's
secretary and an authorized representative of
both Sarayba and Consulta.None of the
defendants filed an answer so upon motion they
were declared in default and judgment rendered
against them. Subsequently, Consulta filed with
the Court of Appeals an action to annul the
judgment of the RTC. Consulta argues that
Canave was not a competent person in charge
of CTC. Was there a valid substituted service of
summons upon Consulta?

A.

Yes. It is not necessary that the person in charge of
the defendants' regular place of business be
specifically authorized to receive the summons. It is
enough that he appears to be in charge. In this
case, Canave, a secretary whose job description
necessarily includes receiving documents and other
correspondence, would have the semblance of
authority to accept the court documents. ( Gentle
Supreme Phils. Inc. v. Consulta, 1 September

Q.

What should the return in case of substituted
service of summons contain?

A.

Should substituted service have been effected, the

1)

The impossibility of prompt personal service
within a period of 30 days from issue and
receipt of summons;

2)

The date and time of the three attempts on at
least two separate dates to cause personal
service and the details of the inquiries made to
locate the defendant residing thereat; and

3)

The name of the person at least 18 years of
age and of sufficient discretion residing thereat;
name of competent person in charge of the
defendant's office or regular place of business,
or name of the officer of the homeowners'
association or condominium corporation or its
chief security officer in charge of the community

(S20 R14, as amended in the 2020 Rules of

Q.

What is the effect if the return does not state the
matters required under 520 R14?

A.

The substituted service is presumed to be invalid.
The sheriff or process server cannot invoke the
presumption of regularity in the performance of
official functions.
Nevertheless, such failure does not conclusively
prove that the service is invalid. The plaintiff may
still establish compliance with the matters stated in
S20 R14 during the hearing of any incident
assailing the validity of the substituted service. (See

to the office of PILTEL in order to serve
summons on Ongpln who was then the chairman
of the board of PILTEL and was expected to
attend a board meeting on that day. Ongpin
however did not attend the board meeting. The
sheriff served summons on Anne Morallo,
executive secretary of the President of PILTEL,
who told the sheriff that she was authorized to
receive summons in behalf of Ongpin. When
Morallo tried to forward the summons to
Ongpin, the latter's lawyers (also the counsel of
PILTEL) refused to receive it. Subsequently
Ongpin entered a special appearance challenging
the jurisdiction of the trial court. Did the trial
court acquire jurisdiction over Ongpin?

A.

No. There was non~compliance with the rule on
substituted service under S6(b) R14. The phrase
therein, "at the defendant's office or regular place of
business" does not inciude a corporation where the
defendant is a chairman of the board of directors
as he does not regu!ariy hold office or conduct

A.
a)

An ejectment case is an action in personam
since it merely seeks to enforce personal
liability against the Defendant. This can be
gleaned from Sections 1, 15, and 17 of Rule
70. (Note: Also a judgment in an ejectment
case only relates to physical possession and
not possession as a real right).

b) Yes. There was no valid service of summons
upon Respondent. The Respondent although
staying at Norway was a Philippine resident as
shown by documents (including an REM)
executed by her where she indicated her address
as Buenlag, Calasiao, Pangasinan. However
the substituted service was effected not at her
residence but at a house which although owned
by her was being leased to Gonzalez who also
resides thereat. Also Oscar Layno the brother
of Respondent was merely visiting the
premises to collect rental and did not reside
thereat. The sheriff's return did not even
indicate that the house was Respondent's
residence and that Oscar resided there.
413
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

Residence, for purposes of summons, is not
synonymous to domicile, but the place where
the person named in the summons is actually
residing. As it turned out, the occupant of the
house was Gonzalez and Respondent's brother
was only in the premises to collect rent from
Gonzalez. Since the MTC did not acquire
jurisdiction over the person of Respondent, its
judgment is null and void. (Domagas v. Jensen,

Q.

The Plaintiff filed a complaint for sum of money
against the Defendant. The sheriff attempted to
serve summons on the Defendant at her given
address but the attempt was unsuccessful
since the Defendant no longer resided at the
given address. Later the trial court issued an
alias summons to be served upon the
Defendant at her new address at Alabang Hills
Subdivision, Muntinlupa City. The security guard
however refused to allow the sheriff to enter the
subdivision since the Defendant had given the
security guards strict instructions not to allow
anyone to proceed to her house when she's not
around. When the sheriff came back to Alabang
Hills, the same thing happened. The sheriff then
left the summons with the security guard by the
name of A.H. Geroche who refused to sign the receipt. Subsequently a judgment by default
was rendered against the Defendant. Defendant
filed with the trial court a petition for relief. She
contended that the substituted service of
summons was not valid since it was not made in
accordance with S6 R14. Should the trial court
grant the petition for relief?

414
J9JC9B0M

RULE 14
Service Of Summons

A.

No, the trial court should not grant the petition
for relief.
The Supreme Court has held that an overly
strict application of S6 R14 may be dispensed
with if the sheriff was prevented from effecting
substituted service by the defendant himself.
Here the Defendant herself gave strict
instructions to the security guards not to allow
anyone to proceed to her house if she was not
around. In his return the sheriff declared that he was
refused entry by the security guard. She should bear
the consequences of such strict instructions. It can
be considered that summons was properly served
upon the Defendant. (Robinson v. Miralles, G.R. No.
163584, 12 December 2006).

Q.

Express Padala filed a petition for recognition
of foreign judgment against 0. At the time the
petition was filed, 0 was already residing in

upon O through her uncle, who was the
caretaker of O's old family residence in Tanauan,
Batangas. Judgment was rendered in favor of
Express Padala. 0 appealed to the CA. May the
CA set aside the RTC's judgment?

A.

Yes. Substituted service presupposes that the place
where the summons is being served is the defendant's
current residence or office/regular place of business.
Thus, where the defendant neither resides nor holds
office in the address stated in the summons,
substituted service cannot be resorted to. Not being a
resident of the address where the summons was
served, the substituted service of summons is
ineffective. Accordingly, the RTC did not acq-uire·

Spouses C and D. By virtue of said sale, a deed
of absolute sale was entered into between the
parties and 18 promissory notes were issued by
Spouses C and Din favor of Spouses A and B.
Later, X, as the trustee of Spouses A and B,
brought an action for rescission of promissory
notes, deed of sale of real property and
cancellation of title against Spouses C and D
before the RTC. Substituted service was made
at C's (the wife's) office, the clerk therein
acknowledging receipt only for C. Was the
summons on C binding on D?

A.

Yes. Service of summons on the wife is deemed
binding on husband where the spouses are being
sued on an obligation chargeable to the conjugal
partnership. Considering that the obligation entered
into by C and D clearly appeared to be a
transaction that their conjugal partnership is liable
for, they were therefore correctly made codefendants as they had the same interests therein.
Also, as the case involves an action in personam
over documents entered into as regards a conjugal
property, the receipt of C of the summons is binding
to her as it is to D. The notation that the summons
was "received for C only" had no effect as its
receipt nevertheless bound D. (Villarama v. Guno, 6
August 2018, Tijam, J.).64

there are reports that the Philippines will join the
convention, as of the time of this writing the

Q.

How is service of summons made upon a

S12 R14 would be at the corporation's office or place
of business, there is no requirement that it be done
so. It may be effected anywhere. (See Baltazar v.
Courl of Appeals, G.R. No. 78728, 8 December
1988). The ruling herein was incorporated in the 2020
Rules of Civil Procedure which states that service on
the persons mentioned therein may be made
"wherever they may be found."

Q.

Villarosa Corporation has its principal office in

RULE 14
Service Of Summons

A.

No. A branch manager is not among the persons
enumerated in S12 R14. (E. B. Villarosa & Partner
Co., Ltd. v. Judge Benito, G.R. No. 136426, 6
August 1999). The ruling would still be valid under
the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure which provides in
the second paragraph of S12 R14 that "[i]f such
service cannot be made upon any of the foregoing
persons, it shall be made upon the person who
customarily receives the correspondence for the
defendant at its principal office." (Emphasis supplied).

Q.

Is service of summons upon
accountant of a corporation valid?

A.

No as a cost accountant is not among the designated
persons in S12 R14 on whom summons may be
validly served. (Green Star Express, Inc. v Nissin
Universal Robina Corporation, 6 July 2015, Peralta, J.)

Q.

Centrogen obtained loans from Far East Bank in
the total amount of P2 million secured by a real
estate mortgage executed by lreneo Santiago.
When Centrogen defaulted in the payment of
the loan, BPI (successor-in-interest of FEBTC)
instituted extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings.
Santiago filed a complaint for annulment of
mortgage against BPI. The sheriff served the
summons and a copy of the complaint upon the
branch manager of BPI Sta. Cruz, Laguna.
Subsequently, instead of filing an answer, BPI
filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack
of jurisdiction over its person. BPI argued in the
motion that a branch manager is not one among
the persons authorized under S11 R14 to
receive summons.

b) Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

A.
a) No. The service of summons on BPl's branch
manager did not bind the corporation for the
branch manager is not included in the
enumeration in the statute of the persons upon
whom service of summons can be validly made
in behalf of the corporation. Such service is
therefore void and ineffectual.
b)

No. A case should not be dismissed simply
because an original summons was wrongfully
served. It should be difficult to conceive that
when a defendant personally appears before a
court complaining that he had not been validly
summoned, that the case against him should
be dismissed. An alias or new summons can
be actually served on said defendant. (See
Bank of the Philippine Islands v. Spouses
Santiago, G.R. No. 169116, 26 March 2007).

Q.

P filed a complaint against ACME Bus
Corporation. (ABC). The sheriff left a copy of the
summons and complaint with the security
guard of ABC at its office in Calamba. The
security guard then turned over the summons
and complaint to the in-house counsel of ABC.
ABC filed a motion for extension of time to file
answer. Later ABC filed an answer raising the
affirmative defense of lack of personal jurisdiction.
Should the affirmative defense be granted?

A.

No. Under S23 R14 the defendant's voluntary
appearance in the action shall be equivalent to
service of summons and the SC has held that the
filing of a motion for extension of time to file answer
420

RULE14
Service Of Summons

is a voluntary appearance. ( Orosa v. Court of
Hence the
Appeals, 261 SCRA 376 [1996]).
affirmative defense should be denied.

Q.

In the preceding problem, what if instead of
filing a motion for extension of answer, ABC
filed an answer raising the affirmative defenses
of lack of personal jurisdiction. Would your
answer be the same?

A.

Yes my answer would still be the same. A case
should not be dismissed outright, on motion of
defendant, because the original summons was
wrongfully served or there was failure of service. It
is inconceivable that a complaint would be dismissed
where the defendant has appeared in court and no
judgment has yet been rendered in favor of plaintiff.
The court can simply order or allow the plaintiff to
move for the issuance of an alias summons. (Bank
of the Philippine Islands v. Spouses Santiago, G.R.
No. 169116, 26 March 2007; Far Corp. v. Francisco,

Q.

RCBC filed a complaint for damages arising
from fraud against Defendant corporation.
Summons was served upon the Defendant's"
liaison officer, upon the phoned instruction
of the Defendant's corporate secretary. Was
summons validly served upon the Defendant?

A.

Yes. It is clear that the liaison officer, in receiving
the summons, did so in representation of the
corporate secretary, who is one of the officers
competent under the Rules of Court to receive
summons on behalf of a private juridical person.

While there was no direct, physical handing of the
summons to the corporate secretary, the latter
could at least be charged with having constructively
received the same. (Nation Petroleum Gas, Inc. v.
RCBC, 17 August 2015, Peralta, J. ).
Q.

A lawyer made two special appearances in court
in behalf of defendant corporation in order to
challenge the validity of service of summons
upon it. The summons was served upon the
lawyer while in court. Did the trial court acquire
jurisdiction over the defendant corporation?

A.

No. A lawyer is not within the persons enumerated
under S12 R14 who may validly receive summons
in behalf of the corporation.
S 13 R 14 of the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure
provides that "[w]here the summons is improperly
served and a lawyer makes a special appearance
on behalf of the defendant to, among others,
question the validity of service of summons, the
counsel shall be deputized by the court to serve
summons on his client." 65

6
5This provision is anachronistic. A special appearance was a motion to
dismiss based solely on the ground of lack of personal jurisdiction. It was
necessary under the 1964 Rules because the case law then was that a motion to
dismiss which raised grounds aside from lack of personal jurisdiction would
amount to a voluntary appearance. (De Midgely v. Ferandos, 64 SCRA 23
[1975]). A special appearance became obsolete under the 1997 Rules which
provided that the inclusion in a motion to dismiss of grounds aside from lack of
personal jurisdiction shall not be deemed a voluntary appearance. Under the
2020 Rules, lack of personal jurisdiction can no longer be raised in a motion to
dismiss but should be set forth as an affirmative defense in the answer. The
example cited as being covered by S13 R14 is where the complaint is
accompanied by an application for preliminary attachment or preliminary
injunction and summons was not validly served upon the defendant who thus
seeks to discharge the attachment or to dissolve the preliminary injunction. But
in such a case, the appropriate remedy for the defendant is not to enter a special
appearance but to file a motion to discharge the attachment under S13 R57 or to
dissolve the preliminary injunction under S6 R58.

Q.

The SEC promulgated a rule that if a
management committee was formed to oversee
the affairs of a corporation pursuant to P.D. 902A, only the chairmanof the managementcommittee
can validly receive summons. Summons was
served on the corporation through its corporate
secretary. Was there a valid service of summons?

A

Even if a management committee was formed to
oversee the affairs of a corporation pursuant to PD
902-A, it would not authorize the SEC to promulgate
a rule that only the chairman of the Mancom can
validly receive summons. Such rule cannot amend
or alter the Rules of Court promulgated by the SC
which allows officers of a corporation to receive
summons in its behalf. In this case, summons was
validly served upon the corporate secretary. (Tyson's
Super Concrete Inc. v. CA, 23 June 2005).

Q.

Petitioner filed a petition for cancellation of

that "[e]very cooperative shall have an official

communications shall be sent [and that] [s]uch

Relying on the above provision, petitioner
argued that respondent was sufficiently served
with summons and a copy of its petition for
cancellation of annotations because it allegedly
sent these documents to respondent's official
address as registered with the Cooperative
Development Authority. Was there a valid service

No. On matters relating to court procedure, it is the

The pertinent provision in the rules is S12 R14.
There was no proper service upon the officers

SEC. 14. Service upon foreign private juridical entity
Q.

May a foreign corporation
Philippine courts?

A.

Yes, unless it is transacting business in the
Philippines without a license. (Sec. 150, Revised
Corporation Code). Hence a foreign corporation not
licensed to do business in the Philippines can sue
on an isolated transaction.

Q.

May a foreign private juridical entity be sued
before Philippine courts?

A.

Yes provided it has transacted or is doing business
in the Philippines, as defined by law, regardless of
whether it has a license to do so or not. (See S14
R14). Philippine courts however do not have
jurisdiction over foreign corporations which have
not transacted or is doing business in the Philippines.

Q.

What is the meaning of the phrase, "has transacted
or is doing business in the Philippines"?

A.

"Doing business" is defined in Sec. 3(d) of the
Foreign Investments Act as including the following:
(Keyword: SOAMI)
1)

bring a suit before

Soliciting orders or service contracts;

424

RULE 14
Service Of Summons

2)

Opening offices, whether called "liaison" offices
or branches;

3) Appointing representatives or distributors
domiciled in the Philippines or who in any
calendar year stay in the country for a period or
periods totaling 180 days or more;
4)

Participating in the management, supervision
or control of any domestic business, firm, entity
or corporation in the Philippines; and

5) Any other act or acts that imply a continuity of
commercial dealings or arrangements, and
contemplate to that extent the performance of
acts or works, or the exercise of some of the
functions normally incident to, and in
progressive prosecution of, commercial gain or
of the purpose and object of the business
organization.
Provided, however, that the phrase "doing
business" shall not be deemed to include mere
investment as a shareholder by a foreign entity in
domestic corporations duly registered to do
business, and/or the exercise of right as such
investor, nor having a nominee director or officer to
represent its interests in such corporation; nor
appointing a representative or distributor domiciled
in the Philippines which transacts business in its
own name and for its own account.
The phrase "has transacted business" has no
special significance but is simply meant to
emphasize that even a single act can be construed
as "doing business" if it implies a continuity of
commercial dealings or arrangements.

Q.

How is service of summons made upon a
foreign private juridical entity?

A.

When the defendant is a foreign private juridical
entity which has transacted or is doing business in
the Philippines, service may be made on its
resident agent designated in accordance with law
for that purpose, or if there is no such agent, on the
government official designated by law to that effect,
or on any of its officers, agents, directors or
trustees within the Philippines.
If the foreign private juridical entity is not
registered in the Philippines or has no resident
aient but has transacted or is doing business in
it, 6 as defined by law, such service may, with leave
of court, be effected out of the Philippines through
any of the following means:
a)

By personal service coursed through the
appropriate court in the foreign country with the
assistance of the department of foreign affairs;

b)

By publication once in a newspaper of general
circulation in the country where the defendant
may be found and by serving a copy of the
summons and the court order by registered mail
at the last known address of the defendant;

c)

By facsimile;

d)

By electronic means with the prescribed proof
of service; or

e)

By such other means as the court, in its
discretion, may direct. (S14 R14).

6The italicized phrase was added in the 2020 Rules of Civil Court and

business in the Philippines for it to be sued before the Philippine courts.

A.

No. When a foreign corporation has designated a
resident agent authorized to receive summons
pursuant to Section 123 of the Corporation Code
(now Section 145, Revised Corporation Code),
such designation is exclusive and service of
summons on any other person is inefficacious.
(H.B. Zachry Company v. Court of Appeals, 232
SCRA 329 [1994]; Poizat v. Morgan, 28 Phil. 597).
The two other modes of service are allowed only
when the foreign corporation has neglected or
refused to designate a resident agent. (Poizat v.

"or, if there be no such agent."

Respondent alleged that Thomson had issued a

originals thereof. Summons was served upon
HSBC Trustee through the in-house counsel of
HSBC at its Enterprise Tower Office. Was there a
proper service of summons upon HSBC Trustee?

A.

No. S 14 R 14 is the relevant provision. Firstly there
were no appropriate allegations in the complaint
showing that HSBC Trustee is doing business in
the Philippines. It is not enough to allege in a
general way that the defendant foreign corporation
is doing business in the Philippines. Secondly there
is no allegation in the complaint that HSBC is a
domestic agent of HSBC Trustee. Thus summons

Q.

Sharp Corporation is a Filipino corporation
doing business in Japan through its four duly
registered branches. The Plaintiff filed in Japan
a case for sum of money against Sharp but
summons could not be served on Sharp in
Japan. The Tokyo District Court requested the
Supreme Court of Japan to cause the delivery
of the summons to the Philippines. The Japanese
Supreme Court delivered the summons to the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs which forwarded the
same to the Japanese Embassy in Manila. The
Japanese Embassy then sent the summons to
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of
Foreign Affairs endorsed the summons to the
executive judge of the CFI. The sheriff then
served the summons at Sharp's principal office
in Manila. A judgment was rendered by the
Japanese court against Sharp. Sharp filed an
action for the enforcement of the Japanese
judgment before the Manila Regional Trial Court.
The RTC and the Court of Appeals both
dismissed the petition on the ground that the
action for collection is in personam and
extraterritorial service of summons is not
allowed. May the judgment of the Japanese
court be enforced in the Philippines?

A.

Yes. Applying the doctrine of processual presumpfioff,
the Japanese procedural law on service of summons
upon a foreign private juridical entity is presumed to
be the same as S14 R14. The delivery of summons
to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is
equivalent to service "on the government official

service of summons by publication which shall
be through a motion in writing, supported by the
affidavit of the piaintiff or some person on his
behalf, setting forth the grounds for the
application. (S19 R14).

A

In any action where the defendant is designated as
an unknown owner, or the like, or whenever his or
her whereabouts are unknown and cannot be
ascertained by diligent inquiry, within 90 days from
the commencement of the action,68 service may, by
leave of court, be effected upon him or her by

Any order granting such leave shall specify a
reasonable time, which shall not be less than 60
days after notice, within which the defendant must
answer. (S16 R14, as amended in the 2020 Rules

68
The phrase "within 90 calendar days from the commencement of the

Crispin has a due but unpaid promissory note
drawn in his favor by Tomas, whose present
whereabouts are unknown to him.

One day Crispin saw Tomas on Avenida
Rizal, Manila. Whereupon, Crispin filed suit
against Tomas in the Regional Trial Court of
Manila. Crispin subsequently moved for leave of
court to serve summons by publication upon
Tomas, alleging that Tomas is a resident
defendant but whose address is unknown and
could not be ascertained by diligent inquiry
within 90 days from the filing of the action.
Should the Court grant the motion?
A.

Yes, the Court should grant the motion.
Under S16 R14, summons may be served
through publication upon a resident defendant
whose whereabouts are unknown and cannot be
ascertained by diligent inquiry within 90 days from
the commencement of the action. The phrase, "any
action" in S16 R14 includes actions in personam.
Here the suit for collection is an action in
personam which is covered by S16 R14. Hence
service of summons by publication may be effected
with leave of court.

was rendered against Asuncion. Subsequently
Asuncion filed an action to annul the judgment.
Asuncion argued that a copy of the summons
and the order should have been sent to his last
known address and since this was not done, the
service of summons by publication is ineffective.
Pantaleon argues that the requirement of sending
a copy of the summons and the order to the
defendant's last known address applies only to
S17 R14. Is Pantaleon's argument meritorious?
A.

No. The requirement of sending a copy of the
summons and order to the defendant's last known
address by registered mail applies to all instances
where service of summons by publication is made.
This may be gleaned from S22 R14 regarding proof
of service by publication which provides that the
affidavit shall aver that a copy of the summons and
order for publication shall be sent by registered mail
to the defendant's last known address. The
judgment is null and void ab initio. (Pantaleon v.
Asuncion, 105 Phil. 761 [1959]).

summons and a copy of the complaint in a
newspaper of general circulationin Rizal.
As B was actually no longer residing in
Rizal, and consequently did not become aware
of the collection suit against him, he failed to
file his answer in court. He was therefore
declared in default and a judgment was indue

judgment.

The Supreme Court has held that in order for a
court to acquire jurisdiction to render judgment it
must acquire jurisdiction over the person of the

Here there was no valid service of summons
by publication since there was no showing that
diligent efforts were exerted to ascertain the
whereabouts of B nor was the summons and order
for publication sent to B at his last known address.
(S16 R14; S22 R14; Pantaleon v. Asuncion, 105

b)

B should file file with the Court of Appeals an
action to annul the judgment of the regional trial
court on the ground of lack of jurisdiction. (S1 &

suit an application for a temporary restraining
order or preliminary injunction to restrain the

SEC. 17. Extraterritorial service
Q.

When may extraterritorial service of summons
be availed of?

A.

Extraterritorial service of summons may be availed of:
A) When the defendant is a non-resident and is
not found in the Philippines; and
B)
1)

The action affects the personal status of the
plaintiff.

2)

The action relates to property within the
Philippines:

a)

In which the defendant has or claims an
interest, or

b)

In which the relief demanded consists
of excluding the defendant from any
interest therein.

3)

An action wherein the property of theA
defendant has been attached within the
Philippines. (PPA) 69

69
In strict point of law, the propriety of extraterritorial service is not
dependent on the technical characterization of the action as in rem or quasi in
rem, but on whether the action is any of those mentioned in S15 R14. (See
Baltazar v. Court of Appeals, 168 SCRA 354, 363). The Supreme Court however
has stated in several cases that S15 R14 applies to actions in rem or quasi in
rem and not to actions in personam. This test could lead to problems. For
example an action to recover title to or possession of real property, which is
clearly covered by the terms of S15 R14, has been characterized by the
Supreme Court as an action in personam. (Republic v. Court of Appeals, 315
SCRA 600, 606). It is recommended that the test should be simply whether the
action is any of those mentioned in S 15 R 14.

Q.

In the foregoing instances, does the extraterritorial
service of summons confer jurisdiction over the
person of the non-resident defendant?

A.

No. The court acquires jurisdiction over the res
(plaintiff's status or defendant's property) which is
situated in the Philippines but not over the person
of the defendant. This is because a Philippine court
cannot acquire jurisdiction over the person of a
defendant who does not reside in and is not found
in the Philippines.

Q.

Tristan filed a suit with the RTC of Pasay
against Arthur King and/or Estate of Arthur
King for reconveyance of a lot declared in the
name of Arthur King under TCT No. 1234. The
complaint
alleged that "on account Arthur
King's residence abroad up to the present and
the uncertainty of whether he is still alive or
dead, he or his estate may be served with
summons

Summons was
published and nobody filed any responsive
pleading within sixty (60) days therefrom. Upon

said lot to Tristan.

King's ~state, filed a petition for
annulment of judgment before the CA praying
that the decision in favor of Tristan be declared
null and void for lack of jurisdiction. He claims
that the action filed by Tristan is an action in
personam and that the court did not acquire
jurisdictioti over defendants Arthur King and/or
his estate. On the other hand, Tristan claims
436

RULE14

that the suit is an action in rem or at least an
action quasi in rem. Is the RTC judge correct in
ordering service of summons by publication?
Explain. (16 Bar Q19)
A.

Yes, the RTC judge is correct in ordering service of
summons by publication.
Under S17 R14, extraterritorial service, which
includes service by publication, may be availed of
in actions the subject of which is property within the
Philippines in which the defendant has or claims a
lien or interest or in which the relief demanded
consists in excluding the defendant from any
interest therein.
Here the action for reconveyance has for its
subject a real property in the Philippines in the
defendant's name and in which the relief sought is to
annul the defendant's title and vest it in the plaintiff.
While Jojo is not without legal basis in saying
that the action for reconveyance is in personam
(Republic v. CA, 315 SCRA 600, 606), the test of
whether an action is covered by S17 R14 is not its
technical characterization as in rem or quasi in rem
but whether it is among those mentioned in S 17
R14. (See Baltazar v. Court of Appeals, 168 SCRA

What is a long-arm statute?

A.

A long-arm statute is a statute which allows a local

It is submitted that an action for reconveyance is more properly
characterized as an action quasi in rem. See de Midgely v. Ferandos, 13 May
1975, where the issue was the applicability of S15 R14 and where the Court
stated that the action for reconveyance of land was an action quasi in rem and
thus a case where extraterritorial service may be availed of.

locally and affects a local plaintiff. Such statutes are
commonly employed to allow a local court to exercise
jurisdiction over non-resident motorists who cause
automobile accidents within the state. {STEVEN H.
GIFIS, LAW DICTIONARY 122 [1975]).
Q.

Is S17 R14 a long-arm statute?

A.

No since it does not provide for the acquisition of
personal jurisdicition over the non-resident defendant.
What is provides for is acquisition of jurisdiction over
the res (the plaintiff's status or the defendant's
property) which is situated in the Philippines or what
is termed as quasi-in-rem jurisdiction.

b) What would be the recourse, if any, of P in

A.
a)

No. The action is one in personam, hence
extraterritorial service cannot be effected in an
action against a non-resident defendant.

b)

P shou Id look for property of D in the
Philippines and have them attached. Prior or
contemporaneous service of summons is not
required in order to attach D's property. (S5

action into one quasi in rem. Extraterritorial
service of summons may then be effected.

Q.

D, an American tourist in the Philippines,
negligently drove his car hitting and inflicting
serious injuries upon P. After the accident, D
forthwith went back to the United States. Can P
file a torts case in the Philippines against D?

A.

No. An action for tort and damages is one in
personam. Since we do not have a long-arm statute
in the Philippines, P has no judicial recourse
against D, unless he can locate any property of D
within the Philippines and attach the same.

Q.

What are the modes of effecting extraterritorial
service? (Keyword: PIPO).

A.

Service may by leave of court be effected out of the
Philippines by:
1) Personal service as under S5.71
2) As provided for in international conventions to
which the Philippines is a party.72
3)

Publication in a newspaper of general
circulation in such places and for such time as
the court may order, in which case a copy of
the summons and order for publication shall be
sent by registered mail to the last known

Q.

May summons

A.

Yes. Extraterritorial service may be "in any other
manner the court may deem sufficient." (S17 R14).

Q.

What is the purpose of extraterritorial service of
summons?

A.

The purpose of extraterritorial service of summons
is not to vest the court with jurisdiction over the
person of the defendant but merely for satisfying
the due process requirement. In a proceeding in
rem or quasi in rem, jurisdiction over the person of
the defendant is not a prerequisite to confer
jurisdiction on the court provided that the court
acquires jurisdiction over the res. (Asiavest Limited
v. Court of Appeals, 296 SCRA 539).

Q.

Lani filed an action for partition and accounting
in the RTC of Manila against her sister, Mary
Rose, who is a resident of Singapore and is not
found in the Philippines. Upon motion, the court
ordered the publication of the summons for 3
weeks in a local tabloid, Bulgar. Linda, an OFW
vacationing in the Philippines, saw the summons
in Bulgar and brought a copy of the tabloid
when she returned to Singapore. Linda showed
the tabloid and the page containing the
summons to Mary Rose who said, "Yes, I know,
my kumare Anita scanned and emailed that
page of Bulgar to me!" Did the court acquire
jurisdiction over Mary Rose? (08 Bar Q1)

440

RULE14
Service Of Summons

A.

No, the court did not acquire jurisdiction over
Mary Rose.
Under S17 R14 on extraterritorial service of
summons, it is required that a copy of the summons
and order be sent to the defendant's last known
address by registered mail.
Here no copy of the summons and the order
was sent to Mary Rose's last known address by
registered mail. The fact that Mary Rose read a
copy of the Bulgar would not constitute a valid
service of summons in the absence of a specific
court order directing that the service upon Mary
Rose of a cop¥ of Bulgar would constitute a
sufficient service. 3
Even assuming that a valid extraterritorial
service was made in accordance with S17 R14,
such would not confer jurisdiction over the person
of Mary Rose but only over the res, that is the
property in the Philippines subject of partition.

Q.

P filed an action to recover title over a parcel of
land in Laguna from D, who is a U.S. resident.
With leave of court, extraterritorial service of
summons by publication was made, with a copy

registered mail to D's last known address. The
trial court rendered judgment by default declaring_
P as the owner of the land and imposing
attorney's fees by way of damages upon D. Is
the judgment of the court valid?

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

A.

The judgment of the court is valid in part. The
judgment declaring P as the owner of the land is
valid since the court validly acquired jurisdiction
over the res. However the judgment ordering D to
pay attorney's fees to P is invalid since a claim for
the recovery of damages is one in personam and
the court never acquired jurisdiction over the
person of D.

Q.

Petitioner left for the United States. Respondent
husband then filed an action to declare the
nullity of his marriage with the Petitioner. Upon
leave of court, summons was published in a
newspaper of general circulation once a week
for 3 consecutive weeks and a copy of the
summons and the order was sent to the
Petitioner at her given address in California
through the Department of Foreign Affairs,
Pasay City. Petitioner contended that there was
no valid extraterritorial service of summons
since a copy of the summons and order was not
sent directly to her but only through the
Department of Foreign Affairs at Pasay City.
Was there a valid service of summons?

A.

Yes there was valid extraterritorial service.
Under S17 R14, extraterritorial service of
summons may be made where the action concerns
the personal status of the plaintiff. An action for
declaration of nullity concerns the plaintiff's personal
status and is an action in rem or quasi in rem.
Here the extraterritorial service as effected not
through the second but through the third mode, i.e.,

Q.

Cris and Melania were married in 1974.
However, sometime in November 1991, Melania
left for the U.S.A. due to her alleged
"irreconcilable differences" with Cris. In 1992, she
obtained a divorce decree, and subsequently,
married a certain Zenon Parnawski in San
Diego, California in 1993.
In 2001, Cris filed a petition 1for the
declaration of nullity of his marriage with
Melania on the ground of psychological incapacity
before the RTC. Cris filed a Motion for Issuance
of Summons by Publication. The RTC granted
the motion and ordered the summons to be
served upon Melania by publication
in a
newspaper of general circulation. Accordingly,
the summons and copy of the petition were
published in the San Pedro Express. No answer
was filed by Melania. The RTC rendered a
decision granting the petition. After more than
seven years from the decision's finality, Melania
filed a petition for annulment of judgment
before the CA, claiming that the RTC decision
was rendered without jurisdiction and tainted
with extrinsic fraud.
The CA granted the petition for annulment
of judgment, and consequently, declared null
and void the RTC Decision. The CA pointed out
that Cris did not send a copy of the summons to
the last known address of Melania and hence

443

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

there was no valid extraterritorial service. Was
the ruling of the CA correct?
A.

No. the RTC only ordered that the summons be
published in a newspaper of general circulation,
which mode of service falls under the third mode of
extraterritorial service of summons, i.e., "in any
other manner the court may deem sufficient," and
hence, should be differentiated from the second
mode of extraterritorial service of summons which
requires publication and service by registered mail
to the defendant's last known address.
If the RTC intended to direct extraterritorial
service of summons under the second mode, then
it should have so indicated that the publication be
complemented by sending a copy thereof to the last
known address of Melania through registered mail.
Hence there was a valid extraterritorial service and
the RTC's decision should not have been nullified
by the C/>-,.(Arrieta v. Arrieta, 19 November 2018,

444

RULE14

A.

Yes. The action to revive judgment is one in

in an action against a non-resident defendant
cannot be validly effected.The judgment is thus null

Q.

Paul Schenker, a Swiss citizen and resident,
through his wife and attorney-in-fact, Helen
Schenker, a Philippine resident, filed a suit in
the Philippines against Gemperle for the
enforcement of subscriptions to shares of
stocks. Gemperle then filed with the CFI an
action for damages against Paul Schenker,
alleging that Paul had caused the publication of
malicious imputations against the plaintiff which
damages his business reputation. Summons and
copy of the complaint was served upon Helen
Schenker. Did the CFI acquire jurisdiction over
the person of Paul?

A.

Yes. Since Paul had appointed his wife as his
attorney-in-fact authorized to bring suits in his
behalf, she is also deemed authorized to receive
summons in a case filed against Paul, especially
where the case is an offshoot of the case filed at
his behest and wherein he had authorized Helen to
be his attorney-in-fact. ( Gemperle v. Schenker, 19

a) What is the nature of an action for partition?

Q.

b)

a)

An action for partition is an action quasi in rem.

b)

No. Since she is a non-resident, service could
only be rnade pursuant to S17 R14 and such
service must be outside of the country.
Furthermore Mrs. Valmonte did not appoint Mr.
Valmonte as her attorney-in-fact to represent
her in litigations and in court. Mr. Valmonte was
merely acting as his wife's counsel in
negotiations with P but this cannot be construed
as an authorization to represent her in court.
(Valmonte v. Court of Appeals, 252 SCRA 93

19 SCRA 45 (1967), where the non-resident
husband had appointed the wife as his

RULE 14
Service Of Summons

After Chan has carefully manipulated the
finances of the family corporations and diverted
their funds to his account in a Swiss bank, he
flees from the Philippines and now resides
at 127 Rue Duphine, Zurich, Switzerland. The
banks concerned now retains the services of
Atty. Ramon Castillo for the purpose of filing a
suit in the Philippines against Daniel Chan on
his obligation as a soldary co-debtor on the
loans of the family corporations. One of the
procedural problems facing Atty. Castillo is the
method of effecting a valid service of summons
upon Daniel Chan, now residing in Switzerland,
to enable the Philippine court to acquire
jurisdiction over his person.
Describe the remedies and procedures, and
the supporting grounds thereof that Atty..
Castillo should follow as would enable him to
effect a valid service of summons on Daniel
Chan. (83 Bar Q14).
A.

First Atty. Castillo should file a collection suit
against Daniel Chan with application for the
issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment. A writ
of preliminary attachment may be applied for since
Daniel Chan is a non-resident. (S 1[f] R57).
Upon the issuance of the order and writ of
attachment, Atty. Castillo should coordinate with
the sheriff to attach the house and lot at Forbes
Park. The writ of attachment may be enforced even
prior to service of summons since Daniel Chan is a
non-resident. (S5 R57).
Upon the attachment of the Forbes Park
property, Atty. Castillo should file a motion for leave
447

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

to effect extraterritorial service upon Daniel Chan.
Extraterritorial service may now be availed of since
the property of Chan has been attached within the
Philippines. (S17 R14).
Once the court grants leave and extraterritorial
service is effected upon Chan, the court acquires
jurisdiction over the res (the property attached) and
may render valid judgment enforcible against the
Forbes Park property.
There is no solution to the problem of how to
effect valid service of summons in order for the
court to acquire jurisdiction over the person of
Chan. The reason is that a Philippine court cannot
acquire jurisdiction over the person of a nonresident not found in the Philippines. Extraterritorial
service under S 17 R 14 confers jurisdiction only
over the res and not the person of the defendant.
Hence Atty. Castillo should try to look for more
property of Chan to attach. The court's judgment
can be enforced only on the property of Chan which
is attached. The debt of P2.5 billion not covered by
attached property cannot be enforced against Chan
as the court has no jurisdiction over his person.

How is summons made upon a resident who is
temporarily out of the Philippines?

When any action is commenced against a defendant
who ordinarily resides within the Philippines, but
who is temporarily out of it, service may, by leave of

underS17 R16. (S18 R16).
448

J9JC9B0M

RULE 14

Q.

P sued Father Maximo for damages arising from
a motorcycle accident. The sheriff left the
summons and a copy of the complaint with Fr.
Bautista at the convent where he and Father
Maximo reside. At the time of the service of
summons, Father Maximo was temporarily out
of the Philippines. Judgment was rendered by
default against Father Maximo. He then sought
to annul the judgment on the ground that he
was not validly served with summons. Father
Maximo contends that in the case of a resident
defendant who is temporarily out of the
Philippines, summons should be served by
extraterritorial service pursuant to S17 R14 and
not by substituted service under S6 R14. Father
Maximo also contends that he never received a
copy of the summons and complaint. Should
the judgment be annulled?

A.

No. A perusal of S 18 R 14 reveals that extraterritorial
service is not the exclusive mode of serving
summons upon the resident defendant temporarily
out of the Philippines since the said provision uses
the word "may." Substituted service of summons
upon such defendant may be availed of. Even if we
were to assume that Fr. Maximo did not receive a
copy of the summons and complaint, that would not
affect the validity of the substituted service. A
person who goes abroad temporarily should take
care of the affairs of his residence such that there
should be someone to receive correspondence,

Q.

P filed with the RTC a torts case against A, B, C,
and D. The sheriff went to D's residence and
served the summons and complaint on D's
husband, since D was temporarily out of the
country in Ireland. Subsequently D filed an
answer raising the affirmative defense of lack of
personal jurisdiction. D contends that she was
not properly served with summons since she
was temporarily out of the country and hence
service of summons on her should conform to
S18 R14 which requires extraterritorial service.
Should the RTC grant the affirmative defense?

A.

The RTC should not grant the affirmative defense.
The Supreme Court has held that in the case
of a resident temporarily out of the Philippines,
extraterritorial service is not mandatory since S 18
R14 uses the word "may" and thus substituted
service of summons may be resorted to.
Here D was temporarily out of the country.
Hence extraterritorial service is not mandatory and
substituted service of summons may be resorted to.

SEC. 23. Voluntary appearance
Q.

What is a "voluntary appearance" within the

Q.

Tina Guerrero filed with the Regional Trial Court
of Binan, Laguna, a complaint for sum of money
amounting to P1 Milion against Carlos Corro.
The complaint alleges, among others, that
Carlos borrowed from Tina the said amount as
evidenced by a promissory note signed by
Carlos and his wife, jointly and severally.
Carlos was served with summons which was
received by Lindai his secretary.
However
Carlos failed to file an answer to the complaint
within the 15-day reglementary period. Hence
Tina filed with the court a motion to declare
Carlos in default and to allow her to present
evidence ex parte. Five days thereafter, Carlos
filed his verified answer to the complaint,
denying under oath the genuineness and due
execution of the promissory note; and
contending that he has fully paid his loan with
interest at 12% per annum.
1) Was the summons validly served on Carlos?

A.

2)

If you were the judge, will you grant Tina's
motion to declare Carlos in default?
(06 Bar Q12)

1)

Yes, the summons was validly served on Carlos.

Initially there was no valid service of summons,
since there was no showing that for justifiable
causes personal service could not be effected
within a reasonable time. (S7 R14). However under
S20 R14, the defendant's voluntary appearance in
the action shall be equivalent to service of summons.

452

RULE 14
Service Of Summons

Here there was a voluntary appearance by
Carlos when he filed his verified answer and such
voluntary appearance is equivalent to service of
summons. Hence the summons was validly served
on Carlos.

If I were the judge I would not grant Tina's
motion to declare Carlos in default.

The Supreme Court has held that the
defendant's answer should be admitted where it
was filed before he had been declared in default as
default judgments are generally disfavored. (Cathay

The court however may, in the exercise of its

Q.

Jacob filed a complaint for annulment of loan
and mortgage contract against Petro Bank on
the ground of fraud. Petro Bank fiied an answer
denying any fraud against Jacob. After the
termination of the pretrial, Jacob filed an ex
parte motion for the issuance of a subpoena
duces tecum and ad testificandum to the senior
loan manager of Petro Bank to appear and testify
in the initial hearing for the presentation of
Jacob's evidence as Jacob's first witness and to
bring documents relative to Jacob's loan. Is the
motion a non-litigious or a litigious motion?

A.

It is a litigious motion. The motion would prejudice
the rights of the adverse party Petro Bank since its
officers would be compelled to testify in support of
Jacob's case. ( Sps. Afulugencia v. Metro Bank, 5
Feb 2014).

Q.

What is the effect if a motion is without proof of
service?

A.

It shall not be acted upon by the court. (S7 R15).
Under the old S6 R15 of the 1964 Rules of Court,
the court nonetheless may act upon the motion "if it
is satisfied that the rights of the adverse party or
parties are not affected." It is submitted that the
court retains such discretion to act upon the motion,
especially where the adverse party did in fact
receive the motion.

Q.

What is the omnibus motion rule?

A.

The rule that a motion attacking a pleading, order,
judgment, or proceeding shall include all objections
then available, and all objections not so included
shall be deemed waived. (S9 R15). Excepted from
this rule are objections based on subject-matter
jurisdiction, res judicata, lis pendens, and prescription
as provided for in S1 R9.

Q.

Spouses See filed an action against HDMF to
compel it to surrender title over a lot to them.
The RTC rendered a decision in favor of
the Spouses See. HDMF filed a motion for
reconsideration raising the lone ground that it
could not be compelled to release the title to
the Spouses See because Arimado (a corespondent) has yet to deliver to it P270,000.
The motion for reconsideration was denied. In
a subsequent certiorari case filed by HDMF
against the Spouses See seeking to set aside
the RTC decision, could the HDMF raise as an
argument that the RTC decision is null and void
for having been issued without a trial?

459
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

No. As to the HDMF's argument that the February
21, 2002 Decision of the RTC is null and void for
having been issued without a trial, it is a mere
afterthought which deserves scant consideration. The
Court notes that the HDMF did not object to the
absence of a trial when it sought a reconsideration
of the February 21, 2002 Decision. Instead, the
HDMF raised the lone argument that it should not
be compelled to release the title to the Sees
because Arimado has yet to deliver to HDMF the
sum of P.272,000.00. Under the Omnibus Motion
Rule embodied in Section 8 of Rule 15 of the Rules
of Court, all available objections that are not
included in a party's motion shall be deemed
waived. (See HDMF v. Spouses, G.R. No. 170292,
22 June 2011 ).

Q.

Plaintiff filed a motion for leave to admit
amended complaint. Should the motion for
leave be accompanied already by the amended
compiaint?

A.

Yes. A motion for leave to file a pleading or motion
shall be accompanied by the pleading or motion
sought to be admitted. (S10 R15).

Q.

What are the prohibited motions under the 2020
Rules of Civil Procedure?

A.

The following motions shall not be allowed:
(a) Motion to dismiss except on the following
grounds:
i)

That the court has no jurisdiction over the
subject matter of the claim;

ii) That there is another action pending between
the same parties for the same cause; and
460

iii) That the cause of action is barred by a prior
judgment or by the statute of limitations;
(b) Motion to hear affirmative defenses;
(c) Motion for reconsideration of the court's action
on the affirmative defenses; 79
(d) Motion to suspend proceedings without a
temporary restraining order or injunction issued
by a higher court;
(e) Motion for extension of time to file pleadings,
affidavits or any other papers, except a motion
for extension to file an answer as provided by
S11 R11,; and
(f) Motion for postponement intended for delay,
except if it is based on acts of God, force
majeure or physical inability of the witness to
appear and testify. If the motion is granted
based on such exceptions, the moving party
shall be warned that the presentation of its
evidence must still be terminated on themdates
previously agreed upon.
A motion for postponement, whether written or
oral, shall, at all times, be accompanied by the
original official receipt from the office of the clerk of
court evidencing payment of the postponement fee
under S21(b) R141, to be submitted either at the
time of the filing of said motion or not later than the
next hearing date. The clerk of court shall not
accept the motion unless accompanied by the
original receipt. (S12 R15, as added in the 2020
Rules of Civil Procedure).

The provision does not distinguish whether the action is for the grant or
denial of the affirmative defense. Cf. S12(e) R8.

Q.

Will an order granting the motion to dismiss or
an affirmative defense bar the refiling of the
same action or claim?

A.

S13 R15, captioned "[d]ismissal with prejudice,"
provides that "subject to the right of appeal, an
order granting a motion to dismiss or an affirmative
defense that the cause of action is barred by a prior
judgment or by the statute of limitations; that the
claim or demand set forth in the plaintiffs pleading
has been paid, waived, abandoned or otherwise
extinguished; or that the claim on which the action
is founded is unenforceable under the provisions of
the statute of frauds, shall bar the refiling of the
same action or claim." (S13 R15, as amended by
the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure).
The remedy of the plaintiff is to appeal the
order. Note that a motion for reconsideration of the
order is prohibited. (S12[c] R15).80

80
S13 R15 seems to imply that if the order granting a motion to dismiss or
an affirmative defense is on grounds other than those provided for in S13 R15,
the dismissal is without prejudice and thus the remedy of the plaintiff is not to
appeal but to refile the action or to file the appropriate special civil action under
R65. (S1[g] R41·; United Alloy Phils. Corp. v. United Coconut Planters Bank, 23
November 2015). It is opined that this should not be the case. The mere fact that
S13 R15 is captioned "dismissal with prejudice" should not be taken to mean that
the other dismissals are "without prejudice." See S8 R40 on dismissal on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction by the MTC in which the remedy is appeal. See also
Madrigal Transport Inc. v. Lapanday Holdings Corp., 11 August 2004, where the
Court held that the remedy from an order dismissing a case on the ground of
failure to state a cause of actiot, is appeal and not certiorari; and Pfleider v. Court
of Appeals, 12 November 2018, wherein the remedy from an order dismissing a
case on the ground of /is pendens is appeal under R45. It should be noted that
R65 places a greater burden on the plaintif for he has to show not only reversible
error but grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of or excess of jurisdiction.

462

RULE 16. MOTION TO DISMISS81
Q.

Under the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure, is a
motion to dismiss a prohibited motion?

A.

Yes, a motion to dismiss is a prohibited motion
except if the ground thereof is lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction, res judicata, lis pendens, or prescription.
(S12[a] R 15, 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure). 82

Q.

Within what time should a motion to dismiss
be filed?

A.

Within the time for but before filing the answer. (S1
R16, 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure). However, if
the grounds of lack of jurisdiction, res judicata, lis
pendens, and prescription appear from the pleadings
or the evidence on record, the motion to dismiss
may be filed even after an answer had been filed.
(S1 R9).

Q.

May the trial court dismiss a case motu proprio?

A.

No, there should be a motion to dismiss or an
answer with affirmative defense filed by the
defendant. The exceptions are:
1) When it appears from the pleadings or the
evidence on record that the court has no
jurisdiction over the subject matter, or that the

81
Under the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure, the provisions of R16 have
either been deleted or transposed to other rules.
82
The other instances wherein a motion to dismiss is allowed are the
following: (1) on the ground of non-referral for conciliation in ejectment cases and
in cases covered by the Rule on Summary Produre; (2) failure to comply with the
requirements of S5 R7; (3) failure to pay the docket fee; (4) impropriety of the
interpleader action or on other appropriate grounds specified in R16. (S4 R62);
and (5) lack of subject-matter or personal jurisdiction in declaration of nullity and
annulment of marriage and in legal separation cases.

action is barred by res judicata, or lis pendens,
or prescription, the court shall dismiss the
claim. (S1 R9, S1 R14).
2)

In ejectment cases and in cases governed by
the Rule on Summary Procedure, the court
may, from an examination of the allegations in
the complaint and such evidence as may be
attached thereto, dismiss the case outright on
any of the grounds for the dismissal of a civil
action which are apparent therein. (Section 4,
Rule on Summary Procedure; S5 R?O).

3)

In cases covered by the Revised Rules of
Procedure for Small Claims Cases, the court
may motu proprio dismiss the statement
of claims in the instances proved for in Section
11 thereof.

Q.

May a complaint be dismissed on the ground that
the allegations therein are vague and indefinite?

A.

Provided that it states a cause of action, a
complaint may not be dismissed on the ground
alone that its allegations are vague and indefinite.
The defendant's remedy is to move for a bill of
particulars or avail of the proper mode of discovery.
(Ga/eon v. Ga/eon, 49 SCRA 516).

Action on motion to dismiss
Q.

What action shall the court take on the motion
to dismiss?

A.

Being a litigious motion, the court shall observe the
procedure in S5 R15 and resolve the motion within
15 days from receipt of the opposition thereto or
upon expiration of the period to file the opposition.

464

RULE 16
Motion To Dismiss

The court may in its discretion call a hearing on
the motion. (S6 R15). In this hearing, when the
motion is based on facts not appearing on record, the
court may hear the matter on affidavits or depositions
presented by the respective parties, but the court may
direct that the matter be heard wholl/ or partly on oral
8
testimony or depositions. (S2 R15).
The court may dismiss the action or claim,
deny the motion, or order the amendment of the
84
pleading.

Q.

May the court defer resolution of the motion?

A.

No, the court must resolve the motion to dismiss.
The court cannot defer resolution of the ground for
dismissal until trial. (See S5 & 6, R15).

Time to plead
Q.

If the motion to dismiss is denied, within what
time shall the defendant file his answer?

A.

If the motion to dismiss is denied, the movant shall
file his answer within the balance of the period
prescribed by R11 to which he was entitled at the
time of serving his motion, but not less than five
days in any event, computed from is receipt of the
notice of the denial. If the pleading is ordered to be
amended, he shall file his answer within the period
prescribed by R11 counted from service of the
amended pleading, unless the court provides

85
Procedure).
Q.

P filed a complaint against D for collection of
P500,000 before the RTC. Summons was received
by D on March 1. On March 25, D filed a motion
to dismiss on ground of res judicata. The trial
court denied the motion to dismiss in an order
received by D on July 1. Up to what date may D
file his answer?

A.

July 8. The Defendant had until March 31 to file his
answer, so that when he filed his motion to dismiss
on March 25, he had 7 days remaining. The day of
the act causing the interruption (March 25) is
excluded from the computation, that is, defendant is
not deemed to have consumed the same. 86 Thus
the allowable period after the interruption or the
remaining period is seven days (March 25 to March
31 ). When the Defendant received notice of the
cessation of the cause of interruption on July 1, the
allowable period started to run on the next day (July
2 up to July 8). One may simply add the remaining
period to the day of notice of cessation: July 1 + 7
days = July 8.

Q.

Same facts as the preceding question, but D
filed his motion to dismiss on March 31. Up to
what date may D file his answer?

A.

Up to July 6. S4 R16 (1997 Rules) states that the
movant is entitled to not less than 5 days in any

it is submitted that this provision is still effective, since there is an

event computed from receipt of the notice of denial.
Thus: July 1 + 5 days= July 6.
Q.

P filed an action for specific performance of
contract against D. Summons was received by
D on March 1. On March 10, D filed a motion to
dismiss on ground of prescription. After
hearing, the trial court ordered P to amend the
complaint to cure the defect by alleging that P
had made an extrajudicial demand which
interrupted the running of the prescriptive
period. P filed the amended complaint and a
copy thereof was served on D on July 1. Up to
what date can D file his answer?

A.

Up to July 31. Under S4 R16 (1997 Rules) the
movant shall file his answer within the period
prescribed by R11 counted from service of the
amended pleading. D thus has 30 days from July 1
or up to July 31 within which to file his answer.
(JOSE Y. FERIA, 1997 RULES OF CIVIL
PROCEDURE 59 [1997]). Justice Regalado writes
that the movant only has the balance but not less
than 5 days within which to file his answer. (1
FLORENZ D. REGALADO, REMEDIAL LAW
COMPENDIUM 262 [ylh rev. ed., 3rd printing 1999]).
It is submitted that the opinion of Justice Feria is
more in accord with the tenor of S4 R 16.

Q.

In the prior question, what if on March 11,
without waiting for the resolution of the motion
to dismiss, P filed an amended complaint curing
the defect of failure to state a cause of action
and served a copy upon D. Should D wait for
the resolution of the MTD or file an answer
within 30 days from March 11?

467

D should file an answer within 30 days since the
amendment rendered moot and academic the
motion to dismiss.

SEC. 5. Effect of dismissal
Q.

If a motion to dismiss is granted, may the
plaintiff still re-file the complaint?

A

Yes, except if the ground for the dismissal is
prescription, unenforceability of the claim, res
judicata, and extinguishment of the claim. (S13
R15; keyword: PURE).

Q.

P filed an action against D for recovery of
ownership of land. The RTC decided in favor of
D but on appeal the CA reversed and held that P
is entitled to the ownership of the land. The
judgment became final and executory. Later D
filed an action against P for recovery of the
value of the improvements it had introduced on
the land. P filed a motion to dismiss on the
ground of res judicata. This was denied
categorically by the trial court. Subsequently P
filed an answer in which he raised the
affirmative defense of res judicata. May P still
raise the defense of res judicata in his answer?

A

Yes, after all the order of denial of the motion to
dismiss is merely interlocutory and cannot amount
to res judicata. (Spouses Rasdas v. Estenor, G.R.
No. 157605, 13 December 2005, Tinga, J.). Rasdas
lays to rest the obiter dictum in C/avano v. Genato,
G.R. No. L-45837, 28 October 1977, which states
that if a ground is raised in a motion to dismiss and
categorically denied, such ground can no longer be
raised as an affirmative defense in the answer.

RULE 17. DISMISSAL OF ACTIONS
Q.

May a plaintiff dismiss his complaint?

A.

Yes, either by filing a notice of dismissal or a
motion for dismissal.

Q.

When may a plaintiff dismiss a complaint
filing a notice of dismissal?

A.

At any time before service of the answer or of a
motion for summary judgment. Upon such notice
being filed, the court shall issue an order confirming
the dismissal. (S1 R 17).

Q.

Is such a dismissal without prejudice?

A.

Yes. The exceptions would be: (1) if otherwise
stated in the notice of dismissal, and (2) under the
two-dismissal rule. In these two instances, the
dismissal is with prejudice.

Q.

What is the two-dismissal rule?

A

The rule that the notice of dismissal would operate
as an adjudication on the merits if the plaintiff had
once dismissed in a competent court an action
based on or including the same claim. (S1 R17).
Hence if plaintiff files a complaint based on the
claim subject of the second dismissal, the defendant
may move to dismiss on the ground of res judicata.

while the first may be by notice or by motion
of the plaintiff.

before the latter could file her answer or a

dismissal of the second complaint with or
without prejudice? Explain. (89 Bar Q2.2).

operate as an adjudication on the merits if the
plaintiff had once dismissed in a competent court

City. However, for reasons personal to her,
Agatha decided to have the complaint dismissed
without prejudice by filing a notice of dismissal
prior to the service of the answer of Yana.
Hence, the case was dismissed by the MeTC.
A month later, Agatha refiled the complaint
against Yana in the same MeTC.
May Yana successfully invoke the TwoDismissal Rule to bar Agatha's third complaint?
Explain your answer. (17 Bar Q7b)
A.

No, Yana may not successfully invoke the TwoDismissal Rule to bar Agatha's third complaint
Under the Two-Dismissal Rule, the notice of
dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the
merits provided it is filed by a plaintiff who has once
dismissed in a competent court an action based on
or including the same claim. [S1 R17]
Here the first dismissal by the plaintiff was not
in a competent court as the RTC in Makati City did
not have subject-matter jurisdiction over an action
seeking to recover P350,000. Hence Agatha's third
complaint is not barred by the Two-Dismissal Rule.

Q.

P filed a complaint against D to collect on
P300,000. P filed a notice of dismissal which was
confirmed by the court. Subsequently P filed a
second case against D involving the P300,000
claim. D filed his answer. P filed a motion for
dismissal which was granted by the trial court.
The court order granting the motion did not
state whether the dismissal was with or without
prejudice. After three months, P filed another
case involving the same P300,000. D filed a
473

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

motion to dismiss on the ground of res judicata,
invoking the two-dismissal rule. Should the
motion to dismiss be granted?
A.

No. The two-dismissal rule would apply only if the
second dismissal was by notice. Here the second
dismissal was by motion and hence the dismissal
would be governed by S2 R17 and not S1 R17.
Since the trial court did not provide in its order that
the second dismissal was with prejudice, then the
dismissal would be without prejudice.

Q.

When may a plaintiff dismiss a complaint by
filing a motion for dismissal?

A.

After the service upon the plaintiff of the answer or
of a motion for summary judgment. In such a case,
the complaint shall not be dismissed save upon
approval of the court and upon such terms and
conditions as the court deems proper. (S2 R17)

Q.

motion, what happens to the counterclaim
pleaded by the Defendant?

respondent invoked S2 R17 and prayed that her

The RTC granted petitioner's motion to
withdraw

Further,
it
declared
respondent's counterclaim "as remaining for
independent adjudication" and as such, gave
petitioner fifteen (15) days to file his answer
thereto. Did the RTC act correctly in declaring
475

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

the respondent's counterclaim "as remaining
for independent adjudication"?
A.

No. As may be clearly inferred from S2 R17, should
the defendant desire to prosecute his counterclaim,
he is required to manifest his preference therefor
within 15 days from notice of the plaintiffs motion to
dismiss. Failing in which, the counterclaim may be
prosecuted only in a separate action.
The rationale behind this rule is not difficult to
discern: the passing of the 15-day period triggers the
finality of the court's dismissal of the complaint and
hence, bars the conduct of further proceedings, i.e.,
the prosecution of respondent's counterclaim, in the
same action. Thus, in order to obviate this finality, the
defendant is required to file the required manifestation
within the aforesaid period; otherwise, the counterclaim
may be prosecuted only in a separate action. (Blay v.
Bafia, 7 March 2018, Perlas-Bernabe, J.).

Q.

Is a dismissal upon the Plaintiff's motion with
prejudice?

A.

It shall be without prejudice unless otherwise
specified in the order of dismissal. (Id.). Compare
this with dismissal upon Plaintiff's notice.

Q.

What is the special rule on dismissal of actions
in respect of a class suit?

A.

A class suit shall not be dismissed or compromised
without the approval of the court. (Id.) The reason
is for the court to protect the interests of the
members of the ciass.

RULE 17
Dismissal Of Actions

SEC. 3. Dismissal due to fault of plaintiff
Q.

Discuss dismissal of complaint due to plaintiff's
fault as provided in 53 R17.

A.

Upon defendant's motion or upon the court's own
motion, a complaint may be dismissed if, for no
justifiable cause, the plaintiff (CAP):

1. Fails to appear on the date of the presentation of
his evidence.
2. Fails to prosecute his action within a reasonable
length of time.
3. Fails to comply with the Rules of Court or any
order of the court.
Q.

What is the effect of a dismissal under 53 R17?

A.

The dismissal shall have the effect of an
adjudication upon the merits, unless otherwise
declared by the court. (S3 R17).

Q.

Will the dismissal under 53 R17 also result in
the dismissal of the defendant's counterclaims?

A.

No. The dismissal is without prejudice to the right
of the defendant to prosecute his counterclaim in
the same or in a separate action (S3 R17).88

Q.

For failure to follow up the service of summons on
the Defendant despite the lapse of a considerable
length of time, the trial court dismissed the
Plaintiffs suit for failure to prosecute.
a)

Was the dismissal proper?

88
Unlike in 82 R17, there is no requirement that the defendant make a
manifestation if he wants to prosecute his counterclaims in the same case.

477

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

b) Assuming it was, may the Plaintiff re-file the
complaint?

A.
a)

Yes, While it is the sheriff's duty to serve
summons, the plaintiff should also see to it that
the sheriff complies with his duty. If he neglects
to follow up the matter with the sheriff or the
court, the action may be dismissed for failure to
prosecute. (BAG Mfg. & Sales Corp. v. Court of
Appeals, G.R. No. 96784, 2 August 1991 ). 89

b)

Yes. The dismissal has no res judicata effect
because the court did not acquire jurisdiction
over the Defendant's person. Hence, the trial
court had no competence to dispose of the
case on the merits and to render a binding
judgment. (Republic Planters Bank v. Molina,
166 SCRA 39).

Q.

Plaintiff piesented his evidence in chief. During
the date for the presentation of Defendant's
witness, the Plaintiff and his counsel were not
present despite notice. May the Court dismiss
the Plaintiff's complaint for failure to prosecute?

A.

No. The ground for dismissal under S3 R17 is the
plaintiff's failure to appear on the date of the
presentation of his evidence in chief, not his failure
to appear on defendant's turn to present his
evidence. The Court should simply consider the
Plaintiff to have waived his right to object to and/or
cross-examine the witness presented.
89

11is submitted that this ruling should be deemed superseded by S1 R14
of the 2020 Rules which provides that upon receipt of the initiatory pleading and
proof of payment of the requisite legal fees, the court shall direct the clerk of
court to issue the corresponding summons to the defendants.

RULE 17
Dismissal Of Actions

Q.

Plaintiff presented two witnesses. On the date
scheduled for the presentation of the third
witness, the Plaintiff and counsel were absent
despite due notice. May the court dismiss the
complaint for failure to prosecute?

A.

No. After all the Plaintiff had already presented two
witnesses. The Court should just order that the
Plaintiff is deemed to have waived further
presentation of evidence and to have rested his case.

Q.

Wanting to unclog his docket and coming
across the records of Special Proceedings No.
501, a guardianship case involving a minor with
properties worth more than a million pesos, and
finding the said case to have been pending way
back in 1981, after petitioner had presented but
only 3 witnesses, following the appointment of
Dizon as guardian, Judge Jurado of Nueva Ecija
Regional Trial Court dismissed the case for
failure to prosecute. Discuss with reasons the
validity of said order of dismissal. (.85 Bar Q18).

A.

The order of dismissal was not valid. The provisions
of S3 R17, which apply to actions, should not be
unqualifiedly applied to special proceedings,
especially a guardianship proceeding over a minor,
wherein the court should observe the "best
interests of the minor" standard. The court should
conduct a clarificatory hearing to determine why the
case had been pending for so long and order the
parties to proceed with dispatch.

Q.

X filed an action for reconveyance against Y. Y
forthwith filed his answer and served it on X. A
week later, X filed a motion to withdraw the
action since he could not avail of the services
479

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

of counsel. The court dismissed the complaint
based on failure to prosecute. A month after, X
instituted the very same action against Y. Y
moved to dismiss the case invoking res
judicata. He alleged that the dismissal of the
first case had the effect of an adjudication upon
the merits since the court's order had no
condition that it was without prejudice. The
court dismissed the subsequent case on the
ground of res judicata. Was the trial court
correct? Explain. (96 Bar QS.2)
A.

The trial court was not correct in dismissing the
subsequent case on the ground of res judicata.
Dismissal for failure to prosecute under S3
R 17 would have the effect of an adjudication upon
the merits only if the failure to prosecute was for an
unreasonable length of time.
Here there was no failure to prosecute for an
unreasonable length of time because X filed the
motion to withdraw the action just a week after Y
had served the answer on him. The court's
characterization of the dismissal as one "for failure
to presecute" was erroneous. Hence the court's
dismissal should be considered simply as a
dismissal upon plaintiff's motion under S2 R17
which dismissal is without prejudice, unless
otherwise specified in the order of dismissal.

Q.

Petitioners and Respondents are siblings.
Respondents filed an action for partition against
Petitioners. The action was dismissed for failure
to prosecute per S3 R17. The dismissal became
final and unappealable. Subsequently the
Petitioners filed an action for quieting of title
480

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 17
Dismissal Of Actions

against the Respondents over the same lot
subject of the partition suit. The court denied
the action for quieting of title but granted the
Respondents' counterclaim for partition. The
Petitioners contend that the trial court should
not have granted the counterclaim for partition
as the same was barred by res judicata. Is the
counterclaim for partition barred by res judicata?
A.

No. Dismissal with prejudice under S3 R17 cannot
defeat the right of a co-owner to ask for partition at
any time, provided that there is no actual
adjudication of ownership of shares yet. Between
dismissal with prejudice under S3 R17 and the right
granted to co-owners under Art. 494 of the Civil
Code, the latter must prevail. To construe otherwise
would diminish the substantive right of a co-owner
through the promulgation of procedural rules. Such
a construction is not sanctioned by the principle
that a substantive law cannot be amended by a
procedural rule. This finds further support from Art.
496 of the Civil Code which provides that "[p]artition
shall be governed by the Rules of Court insofar as
they are consistent with this Code." ( Quintas v.
Nicolas, 16 June 2014).

Non-exercise of a right is not a failure to comply
with a court order
Q.

Respondents filed a complaint for declaration of
nullity of titles against Petitioner before the RTC
Manila which was raffled to Branch 6. Petitioner
filed a motion to dismiss on the ground of lack
of subject-matter jurisdiction which was granted.
Upon motion the Respondents were given 15
days to file the appropriate pleading or motion.
481

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

They did not do so. Respondents then filed a
complaint for annulment of extrajudicial
settlement and titles with RTC Manila which was
raffled to Branch 20. When Branch 20 was
made aware of the first case, it issued an order
transferring the case to Branch 6, considering
that the case before it involved substantially the
same parties and causes of action. In November
2002, before the service of any responsive
pleading upon them, the Respondents filed a
motion to dismiss their complaint in the second
case, praying that it be dismissed without
prejudice. The motion was granted and the case
dismissed without prejudice. Subsequently the
Respondents filed with the RTC Manila a
complaint for annulment of extrajudicialsettlement
and titles. All 3 complaints are based on the
same claim. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss
on the ground of res judicata invoking the twodismissal rule and also 53 R17, The Petitioner
argues that when Respondents failed to file the
appropriate pleading or motion in the first case,
they violated the order of the court thereby
making the dismissal with prejudice pursuant
to S3 R17. Should the motion to dismiss
be granted?
A.

No. In order for the two-dismissal rule to apply, both
dismissals must be at the instance of the plaintiff.
Here the first dismissal was at the instance not of
the plaintiff (Respondents) but of the defendant
(Petitioner). What governs therefore is S2 R 17
which provides that the dismissal shall be without
prejudice.

482

J9JC9B0M

RULE 17
Dismissal Of Actions

Nor does S3 R17 apply. The trial court
dismissed the first case by granting the motion to
dismiss filed by the defendant. When the trial court
allowed Respondents a period of 15 days to file an
appropriate pleading, it was merely acquiescing to
a request made by the Respondents' counsel that
had no bearing on the dismissal of the case and
which after all was a right of the Respondents. The
non-exercise of a right will not amount to a violation
of a court order. ( Ching v. Cheng, 8 October 2014 ).

RULE 18. PRE-TRIAL
Q.

When should the pre-trial be conducted?

A.

After the last responsive pleading has been served
and filed, the branch clerk of court shall issue,
within five days from filing, a notice of pre-trial which
shall be set not later than 60 days from the filing of
the last responsive pleading. (S1 R18, as amended
in the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure). Note that it is
no longer the duty of the plaintiff to move that the
case be _setfor pre-trial.

Q.

During the initial pre-trial hearing, both parties
moved that the pre-trial be terminated and that
the case be set for trial. The judge granted the
joint motion. Was the action of the judge proper?

A.

No. Pretrial is mandatory. Of course in case of an
adverse decision against one of the parties, he
cannot move for the setting aside of the judgment
since the termination of the pre-trial was made with
his consent. The judge however may be subjected
to disciplinary action.

Q.

What are the matters that the court shall
consider during the pre-trial?

A.
(a) The possibility of an amicable settlement or of a
submission to alternative modes of dispute
resolution;
(b) The simplification of the issues;

484
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

RULE 18

Pre-Trial
(c) The possibility of obtaining stipulations or
adrr)issions of facts and of documents to avoid
unnecessary proof;
(d) The limitation of the number and identification
of witnesses and the setting of trial dates; 90
(e) The advisability of a preliminary reference of
issues to a commissioner;
(f) The propriety of rendering judgment on the
pleadings, or summary judgment, or of
dismissing the action should a valid ground
therefor be found to exist;
(g) The requirement for the parties to:
i)

Mark their respective evidence if not yet
marked in the judicial affidavits of their
witnesses;

ii)

Examine and make comparisons of the
adverse parties' evidence vis-a-vis the
copies to be marked;

iii)

Manifest for the record stipulations regarding
the faithfulness of the reproductions and the
genuineness and due execution of the
adverse parties' evidence;

iv)

Reserve evidence not available at the pretrial, but only in the following manner:

1) For testimonial evidence, by giving the
name or position and the nature of the testimony of
the proposed witness;
90
Subject to the rule under S6(b) R7 that only witnesses whose judicial
affidavits are attached to the pleading shall be presented by the parties during
the trial, except if there are meritorious reasons for the admission of additional
witnesses.

485

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

2) For documentary evidence and other object
evidence, by giving a particular description of
the evidence.
No reservation shall be allowed if not made in
the manner described above.
(h)

Such other matters as may aid in the prompt
disposition of the action. (S2 R18, as amended
in the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure).

Q.

May testimonial evidence not available at the
pre-trial be presented during the trial?

A.

As a rule no since the judicial affidavit should have
been attached to the party's pleading. (S6[b] R7).
However such presentation would be allowed
provided that there are meritorious reasons for the
non-availability and provided that the party
intending to present such evidence has reserved
the same during the pre-trial by giving the name or
position and the nature of the testimony of the
proposed witness. (S2 R18).

Q.

May documentary and object evidence not
available at the pre-trial be presented during
the trial?

A.

As a rule no. The failure without just cause of a
party and/or counsel to bring the evidence required
shall be deemed a waiver of the presentation of
such evidence. (S2 R18). However if there is a just
cause, the party may be allowed to do so provided
he has reserved the documentary evidence during
the pre-trial by giving a particular description of the
evidence. (S2 R18).

RULE 18

Pre-Trial
Q.

On whom shall the notice of pre-trial be served?

A.

The notice of pre-trial shall be served on counsel, or
on the party who has no counsel. The counsel served
with such notice is charged with the duty of notifying
the party represented by him or her. (S3 R18).

Q.

What shall the notice of pre-trial include?

A.

The notice of pre-trial shall include the dates respectively set for:
(a) Pre-Trial;
(b) Court-Annexed Mediation; and
(c) Judicial Dispute Resolution, if necessary.
Non-appearance at any of the foregoing
settings shall be deemed non-compliance at the
Pre-Trial and shall merit the same sanctions under
S5 R18.

Q.

Is it the duty of the parties and their counsel to
appear at the pre-trial?

A.

Yes. It shall be the duty of the parties and their
counsel to appear at the pre-trial, court-annexed
mediation, and judicial dispute resolution, if necessary. The non-appearance of a party and counsel
may be excused only for acts of God, force
majeure, or duly substantiated physical inability.
(S3 R18, as amended in the 2020 Rules of
Civil Procedure).
A representative may appear on behalf of a
party, but he shall be fully authorized in writing to:
1)

Enter into an 2 micable settlement;

2)

Submit to 2 Iternative modes of dispute resolution;
and

3)

Enter into §tipulations or admissions of facts
and of documents. (Id.)

Q.

What are the requirements for the validity of the
authorization?

A.

1)

It must be in writing.

2)

It must be a special power of attorney. (Art.
1878[c], Civil Code). There is no express
requirement that the same be notarized but
in practice the courts require that the SPA
be notarized.

3)

In the case of a corporation, there must be a
board resolution specifically authorizing the
representative to enter into the matters stated in
S4 R18.

Q.

What is the effect of the failure of a party and
counsel to appear at the pre-trial, court-annexed
mediation, or judicial dispute resolution, if
necessary?

A.

When duly notified, the failure of the plaintiff and
counse/91to appear without valid cause when so
required, pursuant to S4 R18, shall cause the
91

There is some ambiguity in the phrase "the failure of the plaintiff and
counsel to appear ... shall cause the dismissal of the action." Does it mean that
the failure of either the plaintiff and counsel to appear shall cause the dismissal
of the action? Or does it mean the failure of both the plaintiff and counsel to
appear shall cause the dismissa.l of the action? It is submitted that the latter
meaning is the proper one. It would be harsh to dismiss the case where the
plaintiff was present but his counsel was not around. A show-cause order to the
absent counsel is appropriate and proper. (See Paredes v. Verano, 12 October
2006). A similar interpretation applies to the failure of the defendant's counsel to
appear. However if only the counsel is present, the punitive sanctions shall apply
if the counsel was not armed with the authorization under S4 R18.

488

dismissal of the action. The dismissal shall be with
prejudice, unless otherwise ordered by the court. A
similar failure on the part of the defendant and
counsel shall be cause to allow the plaintiff to
present his evidence ex-parte within ten days from,
termination of pre-trial, and the court to render
judgment on the basis of the evidence offered.
The failure without just cause of a party and
counsel to appear during pre-trial, despite notice,
shall result in a waiver of any objections to the
faithfulness of the reproductions marked, or their
genuineness and due execution. 92
Q.

During the pretrial, plaintiff and his counsel
were present. On the other hand while the
defendant was present his counsel was absent.
The court issued an order allowing the plaintiff
to present his evidence ex parte. Was the action
of the court proper?

A.

No. The absence of counsel for defendants at pretrial does not ipso facto authorize the judge to
declare the defendant as in default and order the
presentation of evidence ex parte. It bears stressing
that nothing in the Rules of Court sanctions the
presentation of evidence ex parte upon instances
when counsel for the defendant is absent during
pre-trial. A show-cause order to the absent counsel
would have been the more cautious and reasonable
course of action under the circumstances. (Paredes
v. Verano, G.R. No. 164375, 12 October 2006).

92
The situation covered by this paragraph is where the party and counsel
fail without just cause to appear during pre-trial but the court does not choose to
impose the penalty of dismissal or ex parte presentation of evidence.

Q.

The plaintiff failed to appear at the pre-trial.
May the court aside from dismissing the case
allow the defendant to present evidence ex
parte on his counterclaim?

A.

Yes. If the plaintiff fails to appear at the pre-trial,
the court may upon motion dismiss the complaint
and allow the defendant to present evidence ex
parte on his counterclaim.(See Absolute Management
Corp. v. Metro Bank, 23 July 2014) The provision of
S3 R17 may be applied by analogy to supplement
S5 R18.

Q.

What is a pre-trial brief? What shall it contain?

A.

A pre-trial brief is a brief required to be filed by
the parties before the pre-trial and containing,
among others:
The parties shall file with the court and serve
on the adverse party, in such manner as shall
ensuie theii ieceipt theieof at least tr1ree (3)

(b) A summary of admitted facts and proposed
stipulation of facts;
(c) The main factual and legal issues to be tried or
resolved;

How is a pre-trial brief filed and served?

A.

It should be filed with the court and served on the
adverse party, in such manner as shall ensure their
receipt thereof at least 3 days before the date of the

Q.

What is the effect of the failure to file the pretrial brief?

A.

It shall have the same effect as failure to appear at

Q.

What is a pre-trial order? What is its function?

A.

A pre-trial order is the order issued by the court
within ten days from the termination of the pre-trial
which shall recite in detail the matters taken up.
The order shall include:
(a) An enumeration of the admitted facts;
(b) The minutes of the pre-trial conference;
(c) The legal and factual issue/s to be tried;
(d) The applicable law, rules, and jurisprudence;

The direct testimony of witnesses for the
plaintiff shall be in the form of judicial affidavits.
After the identification of such affidavits, crossexamination shall proceed immediately.
Postponement of presentation of the parties'
witnesses at a scheduled date is prohibited, except
if it is based on acts of God, force majeure or duly
substantiated physical inability of the witness to
appear and testify. The party who caused the
postponement is warned that the presentation of its
evidence must still be terminated within the
remaining dates previously agreed upon.
Should the opposing party fail to appear
without valid cause stated in the next preceding
paragraph, the presentation of the scheduled
witness will proceed with the absent party being
deemed to r1ave waived the right to interpose

Yes. Should there be no more controverted facts, or
no more genuine issue as to any material fact, or an
absence of any issue, or should the answer fail to

RULE 19. INTERVENTION
Q.

Define intervention.

A.

It is a proceeding in a suit by which a third person
with a legal interest therein is allowed, with leave of
court, to make himself a party thereto.

Q.

P filed an action for recovery of possession of a
parcel of land located in Cavite against D and E.
The action was filed in the RTC of Las Pinas
City where P resides. D and E filed their
answers in which they alleged that the action
had already prescribed. Subsequently the court
granted X's motion for leave to intervene on his
allegation that the land had been sold to him by
D and E. X then filed an answer wherein he
raised the affirmative defense of improper
venue. Should the court dismiss the action on
the ground of improper venue?

A.

No. D and E had waived the ground of improper
venue when they did not raise the same in their
answer. The court having legally acquired authority
to hear and decide the case, it cannot be divested
of that authority by the intervenors. An intervention
cannot legally alter the nature of the action and the
issues joined by the original parties. (See Claridades
v. Mercader, 17 SCRA 1 [1966]).

Q.

Who may intervene in an action?

A.
1) A person who has a legal interest in the matter
in litigation or in the success of either of the
parties, or an interest against both parties.
495
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

2)

A person who is so situated as to be adversely
affected by a distribution or other disposition of
the property in the custody of the court or of an
officer thereof.

Leave of court is necessary in order that the third
person may be allowed to intervene in the action.
Note that in actions for annulment or declaration
of nullity of marriage or for legal separation where
the defending party fails to answer, the court shall
order the prosecuting attorney to investigate whether
or not a collusion between the parties exists, and if
there is no collusion, to intervene for the State in
order to see to it that that evidence submitted is not
fabricated or suppressed. (S3[e] R9; Articles 48 and
60, Family Code).
Q.

Illustrate the foregoing cases:

A.
1)

Legal interest in the matter in litigation. In an
action involving the estate of a decedent, the
heirs may intervene when they believe that the
administrator's actions are prejudicial to their
interests. In the probate proceedings involving
the settlement of the executor's or administrator's
accounts, a person liable as surety on such
account may, upon application, be admitted as
party to such accounting. (S11 R85). In a
guardianship proceeding, the social worker
may intervene on behalf of the minor if he finds
that the petition should be denied. (S9 SC Rule

Give other examples of intervention.

A.
1)

If the defending party in an action for annulment
or declaration of nullity of marriage or for legal
separation fails to answer, the court shall order
the prosecuting attorney to investigate whether or
not a collusion between the parties exists, and if
there is no collusion, to intervene for the State in
order to see to it that the evidence submitted is
not fabricated. (S3[e] R9).

In a class suit, any party in interest shall have
the right to intervene to protect his individual
interest. (S12 R3).

Q.

What is the procedure if a third person wants to
intervene in a suit?

A.

He shall file a motion for leave of court to intervene
at any time before rendition of judgment by the trial
court. A copy of the pleading-in-intervention shall
be attached to the motion and served on the
original parties. (S2 R 19).
Note that a motion for intervention is a litigious
motion. (S5[ix] R15).

Q.

May intervention be allowed after rendition of
judgment?

A.

No, since intervention may be allowed only before
rendition of judgment. The exception would be the
intervention of an indispensable party. (PacanaContreras v. Ravi/a Water Supply, Inc., G.R. No.
168979, 2 December 2013).

Q.

Respondent was found guilty of grave
misconduct by the Ombudsman and meted the
penalty of dismissal. Respondent appealed the
Ombudsman's decision to the Court of Appeals
by a petition for review under R43. The CA
granted the petition, and accordingly, modified
the Ombudsman's decision, finding Bongais
guilty of simple neglect of duty only and
imposing on him the penalty of suspension for
six months. Dissatisfied with the CA decision,
the Ombudsman filed a motion for leave to
intervene, which the CA denied on the ground

498

RULE 19
Intervention

that the Ombudsman has no legal interest in the
case. Was the denial proper?
A.

Yes, but not on the ground of lack of legal interest
but for having been filed out of time.
The Ombudsman has legal standing to intervene
on appeal in administrative cases resolved by it.
Even if not impleaded as a party in the proceedings,
the Ombudsman has legal interest to intervene and
defend its ruling in administrative cases before the
CA, its interest proceeding, as it is, from its duty to act
as a champion of the people and to preserve the
integrity of the public service.
However the motion for leave to intervene was
filed out of time since it was filed after rendition of
judgment in contravention of S2 R19. (Ombudsman
v. Bongais, 23 July 2018, Perlas-Bernabe, J.)

Q.

May a third party whose property has been
levied upon pursuant to a final and executory
judgment move to intervene in the case?

A.

No. A motion to intervene may not be filed after a
judgment had been rendered by the trial court. The
third party may file a third-party claim.

Q.

May the stockholders of a corporation intervene in
a litigation involving the corporation's property?

A.

No. Absent a showing that the corporation has

its stockholders have no personality or interest to

Q.

Ruben and Nene, Filipino citizens, were married
in Manila in 1968. The marriage encountered
problems and the two decided to obtain a
divorce in the Dominican Republic in 1984. The
next month, Ruben and Maria contracted marriage
in Virginia, United States. The union of Ruben
and Maria produced one offspring. Ruben
subsequently filed a petition for declaration of
nullity of his marriage to Nene with the RTC of
Quezon City in 2001. Maria filed a motion for
leave to intervene in the marriage nullity case
citing her long marriage to Ruben. May the RTC
grant leave to Maria to intervene?

A.

No. Maria has no interest in the marriage nullity
case since she is not the legal wife of Ruben.
Under the Civil Code, a divorce obtained abroad by
Filipino citizens is not recognized. Hence Nene was
still the legal wife of Ruben and thus Maria did not
acquire the legal interest of a wife upon which her
motion for leave to intervene was based. (Perez v.
Court of Appeals, 480 SCRA 411 [2006]).

Q.

Is the allowance of intervention compulsory
with the court?

A.

No, the allowance is discretionary, that is why leave
of court should be sought. In exercising its
discretion, the court shall consider whether or not
the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the
adjudication of the rights of the original parties, and
whether or not the intervenor's rights may be fully
protected in a separate proceeding.
However, where the intervenor is an
indispensable party, the court must allow the
intervention. (Peyer v. Martinez, 88 Phil. 72).
It is submitted also that under S12 R3, S3(e)
R9, and S16 R110, the court must allow the
intervention of the party-in-interest, the State, and
the offended party, respectively.

Q.

P filed an action for unlawful detainer against D

No. Intervention is a prohibited pleading under

Q.

When should an answer to a complaint-inintervention be filed?

501
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

Within 15 days from notice of the order admitting
the complaint-in-intervention, unless a different
94
period is fixed by the court. (S4 R19).

Q.

If an original party fails to file an answer to the
complaint-in-intervention, can he be declared in
default with respect to such complaint?

A.

Yes. Under the 1997 Rules, the filing of an answer
to the complaint in intervention is no longer optional
but mandatory. S4 R 19 states that "[t]he answer to
the complaint-in-intervention shall be filed within 15
days from notice of the order admitting the same,
unless a different period is fixed by the court." (Lim
v. National Power Corporation, 685 SCRA 477, 480
[2012]).

Q.

Is an order denying a motion for leave to
intervene appealable? If so what is the period
for appealing the order?

A.

Yes, an order denying a motion for leave to
intervene may be appealed. The appeal period
would be 30 days from notice of the order, taken by
filing a notice of appeal and a record on appeal.
This is because the appeal from the order denying
intervention is a separate appeal. However, if at the
time it denied the motion for leave, the court had
already rendered judgment and has thus disposed
of the case, the appeal period would be 15 days
taken by filing a notice of appeal alone. (See
Foster-Gallego v. Spouses Galang, G.R. No.
130228, 27 July 2004 ).

94
11appears that a shorter period may be fixed. In Lim v. NAPOCOR, G.R.

RULE 19

Intervention
Q.

Quezon Power Ltd. filed with the Regional Trial•'
Court of Mauban, Quezon, an action for
consignation and damages against the Province
of Quezon for its refusal to accept payment of
realty taxes. Petitioner filed a motion for
intervention alleging that as a resident and
taxpayer of Quezon, he has an interest in the
aggressive collection of realty taxes. The RTC
dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction
stating that it is the Local Board of Assessment
Appeals which has jurisdiction over the complaint.
The RTC also dismissed Petitioner's motion for
intervention. The issue is whether or not the
RTC erred in dismissing Petitioner's motion for
intervention as a consequence of the dismissal
of the main case. While acknowledging the
RTC's lack of jurisdiction, Petitioner nonetheless
prayed that the Court pass upon the correctness
of the Municipal Assessor's assessment of QPL's
realty taxes, among others. Did the RTC err in
dismissing Petitioner's motion for intervention?

A.

No. Jurisdiction over an intervention is governed by
jurisdiction over the main action. Accordingly, an
intervention presupposes the pendency of a suit in
a court of competent jurisdiction.
Here, Petitioner did not contest the RTC's
dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, but oddly maintains
his intervention by asking in this appeal a review of
the correctness of the subject realty tax
assessment. This recourse is improper since the
RTC's lack of jurisdiction over the main case
necessarily resulted in the dismissal of his
intervention. In other words, the cessation of the
principal litigation - on jurisdictional grounds at that
- means that Petitioner had, as a matter of course,

503
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

lost his right to intervene. Verily, it must be borne in
mind that: [l]ntervention is never an independent
action, but is ancillary and supplemental to the
existing litigation. Otherwise stated, the right of an
intervenor should only be in aid of the right of the
original party. Where the right of the latter has
ceased to exist, there is nothing to aid or fight for;
hence, the right of intervention ceases. (Pu/gar v.
RTC of Mauban, Quezon, 10 September 2014).
Q.

Peter filed an action for recovery of a parcel of
land against David. David filed his answer.
Before trial, Ian filed a motion for leave to
intervene to which he attached a complaint-inintervention against Peter and David, alleging
that he was the true owner of the land, and
serving a copy of the motion and complaint
against Peter and David. The court issued an
order granting Ian's motion for leave to intervene
and admitting his complaint-in-intervention.
a) Within what period should Peter and David
answer the complaint-in-intervention?
b) May Peter and David be declared in default
upon motion of Ian if they fail to timely
answer the complaint-in-intervention?
c) Assume that Ian was unable to file a motion
for intervention because he did not learn
about the case. Subsequently a judgment
was rendered in favor of Peter, which
judgment became final and executory. It was
at that point that Ian learned about the - judgment. If you were the lawyer for Ian, what
recourse, if any, would you take in his behalf?

504

RULE 19

Intervention
A.
a)

Peter and David should answer the complaintin-intervention within 15 days from notice of the
order admitting the complaint-in-intervention
pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure.

b)

Yes, Peter and David may be declared in
default upon motion of Ian if they fail to timely
answer the com plai nt-i n-i ntervention.

The Supreme Court has held that an original
party which does not timely file an answer to a
complaint-in-intervention may be declared in default
in respect of the same, since the filing of such an
answer is mandatory under the 1997 and 2010
Rules of Civil Procedure. (Lim v. NAPOCOR, 14
November 2012).
c)

If I were the lawyer for Ian, the recourse I would
take in his behalf is to file an action for
annulment of the judgment under R47.

The Supreme Court has held that a judgment
rendered without impleading an indispensable party
is void. A void judgment may be annulled at any
time by filing an action for annulment of judgment
under R47.
Here Ian alleges that he is the true owner of
the land. Ian was not impleaded in the suit for
recovery of the land filed by Peter against David.
Hence Ian is an indispensable party since his
interest as owner would be directly affected by the
judgment in the case. Thus the judgment is void since
Ian was not impleaded and hence it may be annulled
at any time by an action for annulment of judgment.

RULE 20, CALENDAR OF CASES
Q.

The presiding judge of a multi-sala court
designed a system of assigning cases wherein
he would personally assign the cases in order
to assure an equal case distribution among the
branches. Is this proper?

A.

No such a system would not be proper.
Under S2 R20, the assignment of cases to the
different branches shall be done exclusively by raffle.
(Note: This is different from the 1964 Rules
which provided that the assignment of cases may
be "by raffle or otherwise." [S7 R22]).

Q.

What would be an exception regarding the rule
on assignment of cases by raffle?

A.

Cases falling within the jurisdiction of the special
commercial court or family court would be assigned
to these courts without need of raffle, unless two or
more branches have been designated as special
courts, in which case it shall be raffled only among
them. This is calied a limited raffle as opposed
to a general raffle.

RULE 21. SUBPOENA
Q.

What is a subpoena?

A.

Subpoena is a process directed to a person
requiring him to attend and to testify at the hearing
or the trial of an action, or at any investigation
conducted by competent authority, or for the taking
of his deposition. In this case it is called a
subpoena ad testificandum. The subpoena may
also require the person to bring with him any books,
documents, or other things under his control, in
which case it is called a subpoena duces tecum.

Q.

Who may issue subpoena?

A.

The subpoena may be issued by:
a) The court before which the witness is required
to attend.
b) The court of the place where the deposition is
to be taken.
c) The officer or body authorized by law to do so
in connection with investigations conducted by
said officer or body.
d) Any Justice of the Supreme Court or of the
Court of Appeals in any case or investigation
pending within the Philippines.

A.

When application for a subpoena to a prisoner is
made, the judge or officer shall examine and study
carefully such application to determine whether the
same is made for a valid purpose.
No prisoner sentenced to death, reclusion
perpetua or iife imprisonment and who is confined
in any penal institution shall be brought outside the
said penal institution for appearance or attendance
in any court unless authorized by the Supreme
Court. (S2 R21 ).
A detention prisoner is not compelled to attend
under a subpoena if no permission of the court in
which his case is pending was obtained. (S10 R21)

Q.

Give the form and contents of a subpoena.

A.

A subpoena shall state the name of the court and
the title of the action or investigation, shall be
directed to the person whose attendance is
required, and in the case of a subpoena duces
tecum, it shall also contain a reasonable description
508

of the books, documents or things demanded which
must appear to the court prima facie relevant.
Q.

What are the grounds for quashing a subpoena
duces tecum?

A.

The court may quash a subpoena duces tecum
upon motion promptly made and, in any event, at or
before the time specified therein if:

Q.

1)

It is unreasonable and oppressive,

2)

The relevancy of the books, documents or
things does not appear,

3)

The person in whose behalf the subpoena is
issued fails to advance the reasonable cost of
the production thereof, or

4)

The witness fees and kilometrage allowed by
the Rules of Court were not tendered when the
subpoena was served.

What is the ground for quashing a subpoena ad
testificandum?

A.
1) The court may quash a subpoena ad
testificandum on the ground that the witness is
not bound thereby. Under S10 R21 a witness is
not compelled to attend by virtue of the service
of a subpoena if he resides more than 100
kilometers from the place where he is to testify
by the ordinary course of travel.

the Rules of Court were not tendered when the
subpoena was served.

REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

How is a subpoena served?

A.

Service of a subpoena shall be made in the same
manner as personal or substituted service of
summons. The original shall be exhibited and a
copy thereof delivered to the person on whom it is
served. The service must be made so as to allow
the witness a reasonable time for preparation and
travel to the place of attendance.
Costs for court attendance and the production of
documents and other materials subject of the
subpoena shall be tendered or charged accordingly.
(S6 R21 as amended in the 2020 Rules).
Note that a person present in court before a
judicial officer may be required to testify as if he
were in attendance upon a subpoena issued by
such court or officer. (S7 R21 ).
A subpoena may be served electronically if
express permission is granted by tfle court. (S14[b]
R13, 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure).

Q.

May a subpoena be served by registered mail or
by electronic means?

A.

S14 R13 provides that "the following orders,
pleadings, and other documents must be served or
filed personally or by registered mail when allowed,
and shall not be served or filed electronically,
unless express permission is granted by the Court."
One of the documents mentioned is a subpoena.
S14(b) R13 thus gives the impression that a
subpoena may be served by registered mail or by
electronic means if express permission is granted
by the court.

510

RULE 21
Subpoena

S14(b) R13 should however be read in
conjunction with S6 R21 which provides that service
of a subpoena shall be made in the same manner as
personal or substituted service of summons and that
costs for court attendance and the production of
documents and other materials subject of the
subpoena shall be tendered or charged accordingly. _
Perusing the two provisions, it appears that a
subpoena cannot be served by registered mail or
by electronic means. Service by registered mail is
qualified by the phrase "when allowed" and from a
reading of S6 R21 such is not allowed in the case
of a subpoena. Moreover it is difficult to conceive
how the costs for court attendance and production
of documents and materials may be tendered or
charged in case of service by registered mail or by
electronic means.
In case of failure to serve personally a
subpoena, service may be made by emailing it to
the defendant's email address, if allowed by the
court, but this is really subsumed under substituted
service under S6(e) R14.
Q.

How may the court compel the attendance of a
witness?

A.

In case of failure of a witness to attend, the court or
judge issuing the subpoena, upon proof of the
service thereof and of the failure of the witness,
may issue a warrant to the sheriff of the province,
or his deputy, to arrest the witness and bring him
before the court or officer where his attendance is
required. (S8 R21 ). This is also known as a bench.Ji
warrant (STEVEN GIFIS, LAW DICTIONARY 21

511

[1975]). The court also has the power to punish for
indirect contempt any person who fails to obey
without adequate cause a subpoena served upon
him. (S9 R21, S3[f] R71 ).
Q.

What is the viatory right of a witness?

A.

It is the right of a witness not to be compelled to
attend in court under a subpoena if the witness
resides more than 100 kilometers from his
residence to the place where he is to testify by the
ordinary course of travel. (S10 R21; 1 FLORENZ D.
REGALADO, REMEDIAL LAW COMPENDIUM 300
[ih rev. ed., 3rdprinting, 1999]).

Q.

What is the remedy of a party in case he wants
to present in evidence the testimony of a
reluctant witness who resides more than 100
kilometers from his residence to the place where
he is to testify by the ordinary course of travel?

A.

Tr1e remedy of the party is to take the deposition of
the witness. He should serve to every other party to
the action a notice to take the deposition of the
witness pursuant to S15 or S25 R23.
Under S4(c) R23, the deposition of a witness,
whether or not a party, may be used by any party
for any purpose if the court finds that the witness
resides at a distance more than 100 kilometers
from the place of trial or hearing.
Proof of service of a notice to take a deposition,
as provided in S15 and 25 of R23, shall constitute
sufficient authorization for the issuance of a subpoena
for the persons named in said notice by the clerk of
court of the place in which the deposition is to be

512

RULE 21

Subpoena

taken. The clerk shall not, however, issue a subpoena
duces tecum to any person without an order of the
court. (S2[b] & S5 R21 ).
Q.

Is the viatory right available in criminal cases?

A.

No. (People v. Montejo, G.R. L-24154, 31 October
1967).

Q.

May the viatory right be invoked against a
subpoena duces tecum?

A.

It is submitted that the viatory right may not be
invoked against a subpoena duces tecum. S10 of
R21 speaks of a witness who resides more than
one hundred kilometers from his residence to the
place where he is to testify, evidently referring to a
subpoena ad testificandum. The first paragraph of
S4 R21 which provides for the grounds of quashing
a subpoena duces tecum does not mention the
viatory right unlike the second paragraph which
provides for the grounds of quashing a subpoena
ad testificandum.

513

RULE 22. COMPUTATION OF TIME
Q.

How is any period of time prescribed and
allowed by the Rules of Court, or by order of the
court, or by any applicable statute computed?

A.

The day of the act or event from which the
designated period of time begins to run is to be
excluded and the date of performance included. If
the last day of the period, as thus computed, falls
on a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday in the
place where the court sits, the time shall not run
until the next working day. (S1 R22).
Thus if a defendant is served with summons
on July 1, he has until July 31 (July 1 + 30 = July
31) within which to file his answer. If the defendant
receives a copy of the adverse decision on October
1, he has until October 16 within which to file a
notice of appeal.

Q.

In a habeas corpus case, the respondent Director
of the Bureau of Corrections received a copy of
the RTC's decision on October 1 at 10:00 am. Up
to when may the Director appeal the decision?

A.

Up to 3 October, even if beyond 10:00 am. Under
S1 R22, in computing any period of time prescribed
or allowed by the Rules of Court or by order of
court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the
act or event from. which the designated period of
time begins to run is to be excluded and the date of
performance included. Hence the 48-hour period
starts to run on 2 October. (See Kabigting v.

Computation Of Time

Q.

The MCTC declared the spouses Leynes in
default for their failure to file their answer to the
spouses Superales' Complaint within the
reglementary period for doing so. According to
the MCTC, the spouses Leynes only had until 20
May 2000 to file an answer; and although 20
May 2000 was a Saturday, the court was open
and court personnel Benedicta and Anastacia
were present at that time to receive cases and
motions filed with the court in accordance with
S.C. Administrative Circular No. 2-99. The spouses
Leynes contended that they had until 22 May
2000, the next working day, to file their answer.
Was the MCTC correct?

A.

No. Administrative Circular No. 2-99 should not
affect the manner by which periods set by the rules
or the courts are computed under Rule 22, Section
1 of the Rules of Court. Administrative Circular No.
2-99 is an administrative issuance signed by then
Chief Justice Hilario G. Davide to govern the
attendance of judiciary officials and employees. It
cannot amend or take precedence over the Rules
of Court, duly approved by the Court en bane and
published for the information of and compliance by
the public. In fact, Administrative Circular No. 2-99
itself states that "it supersedes and modifies
accordingly any previous Orders or Circulars on the
matter," but not the Rules of Court. (Leynes v.
Court of Appeals, 19 January 2011 ).

Q.

What is the effect of interruption on the period
of time?

A.

Should an act be done which effectively interrupts
the running of the period, the allowable period after
such interruption shall start to run on the day after
515

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

notice of the cessation of the cause thereof. The
day of the act that caused the interruption shall
be excluded in the computation of the period.
(S2 R22).

Q.

Plaintiff filed a complaint for sum of money
before the RTC against the Defendant.
Summons and a copy of the complaint was
served upon the Defendant on July 1. On July
25, the Defendant filed a motion to dismiss and
he received the order denying the motion to
dismiss on August 1. What is the last day for
the Defendant to file his answer?

A.

August 8. The Defendant had until July 31 to file his
answer, so that when he filed his motion to dismiss
on July 25, he had 7 days remaining. The day of
the act causing the interruption (July 25) is
excluded from the computation, that is, defendant is
not deemed to have consumed the same. 95 Thus
the allowable period after the interruption or the
remaining period is seven days (July 25 to July 31 ).
When the Defendant received notice of the
cessation of the cause of interruption on August 1,
the allowable period started to run on the next day
(August 2 up to August 8). One may simply add the
remaining period to the day of notice of cessation:
August 1 + 7 days= August 8.

P lent PS00,000 to D payable on 23 June 1994
without need of notice or demand. The last day
of the 10-year prescriptive period fell on 19
June 2004 which is a Saturday. If P files his
complaint on 21 June 2004, may his complaint
be dismissed on the ground of prescription?

A.

Yes. The rule on pretermission of holidays under
R22 while applicable to reglementary periods is not
applicable to prescriptive periods set under the Civil
Code, Revised Penal Code, or other applicable
statutes. P should have filed his complaint at the
latest on 18 June 2004. The action to enforce a
written contract under Article 1144 of the Civil Code
prescribes in 10 years from the accrual of the right
of action. (See Yapdiangco v. Buencamino, 122

DISCOVERY (RULES 23-29)
Q.

What is discovery?

A.

The modern pre-trial procedure by which one party
gains vital information concerning the case in order
to aid him in his litigation. (STEVEN GIFIS, LAW
DICTIONARY 61 [1975]).

Q.

What is the primary purpose of discovery?

A.

The primary purpose of discovery is to enable the
parties to obtain the fullest possible knowledge of
the issues and facts before trial and thus prevent
the situation where trials are carried on in the dark.
It makes the parties lay down their cards on the
table so that justice can be rendered on the merits
of the case. (Koh v. Intermediate Appellate Court,
144 SCRA 259).

Q.

May one validly object to discovery on the
ground that it is a "fishing expedition"?

A.

No. Precisely the purpose of discovery is to enable
a party to obtain relevant facts from the other party
in advance of trial so as to facilitate settlement or to
expedite the trial. (Ong v. Mazo, 4 June 2004).
Discovery is in effect a legally sanctioned "fishing
expedition" designed to unveil probative fa(?t$_and.
evidence. (THOMAS A. MAUET, FUNDAMENTALS
OF PRETRIAL TECHNIQUES 158 [1988]).

Q.

What are the three principal characteristics of
discovery?

A.

First it is largely a self-executing process. For the
most part, lawyers conduct discovery without
judicial approval, participation, or regulation.
518

Rules 23-29
Discovery

Second, the discovery rules are flexible and
permit any order, and repeated use, of the various
discovery methods subject only to court protection
against abuse.
Third, orders regulating discovery are usually
not final appealable orders. Since discovery issues
will often be moot by the time a final judgment is
entered in the case, appeals are relatively
infrequent. This means that issues concerning
discovery are principally resolved at the trial court
level. (THOMAS A. MAUET, FUNDAMENTALS OF
PRETRIAL TECHNIQUES 157 [1988]).
Q.

What are the modes or methods of discovery
provided for by the Rules of Court? (PRIDE)

A.
1) Depositions pending action (R23) or before
action or pending appeal. (R24).
2) Interrogatories to parties. (R25).
3)

Request for admission by adverse party. (R26).

4)

Motion for Qroduction or
documents or things. (R27).

5)

Motion for physical or mental §.xamination of a
party. (R28).

of

Q.

May the modes of discovery be resorted to
against non-parties?

A.

Only deposition may be resorted to against nonparties. The other modes must only be resorted to
against parties.

Q.

Is the availment of the modes of discovery,
like a motion for production, limited to the
pre-trial stage?

A

No. The availment of a motion for production, as
one of the modes of discovery, is not limited to the
pre-trial stage. Rule 27 does not provide for any
time frame within which the discovery mode of
production or inspection of documents can be
utilized. The rule only requires leave of court "upon
due application and a showing of due cause. (Eagle
Ridge Dev't Corp v. Cameron Granville Asset Mgt
Inc., 24 Nov 2014, Leanen, J.).

520

RULE 23. DEPOSITIONS
PENDING ACTIONS
Q.

What is a deposition?

A.

Deposition is a method of pre-trial discovery which
consists in taking the testimony of a person under
oath upon oral examination (oral deposition) or
upon written interrogatories. The term deposition
also refers to the testimony or statement so taken.

Q.

What are the kinds of depositions?

A.

Depositions may either be taken upon oral
examination, it which case it is also known as an
oral deposition or it may be taken upon written
interrogatories.Deposition upon written interrogatories
should not be confused with written interrogatories
to parties under R25 which is a separate method of
discovery altogether.
Depositions pending actions are those taken
during the pendency of a case before the court a
quo. (R23) Depositions may be taken even before
the filing of an action or during the pendency of an
appeal. (R24).

Q.

Distinguish deposition from affidavit.

A.

While an affidavit is also under oath, it is
distinguished from a deposition in that it is executed
ex parte without any opportunity for the other
parties to attend and cross-examine the affiant.
Hence an affidavit is hearsay and inadmissible in
evidence while a deposition although also hearsay
may be admitted in evidence under the conditions
and situations set forth in S4 R23.

Q.

When may a deposition be taken?

A.

Upon ex parte motion96 of a party, the testimony of
any person, whether a party or not, may be taken,
at the instance of any party, by deposition upon oral
examination or written interrogatories.The attendance
of witnesses may be compelled by the use of a
subpoena as provided in R21. Depositions shall be
taken only in accordance with these Rules. The
deposition of a person confined in prison may be
taken only by leave of court on such terms as the
court prescribes. (S1 R23, as amended in the 2020
Rules of Civil Procedure).

Q.

Plaintiff filed a complaint against the defendant.
The defendant filed a motion to dismiss. The
plaintiff, without prior leave, filed and served a
notice to take deposition upon the defendant
and the person to be deposed, and the
deposition was subsequently taken. May such
deposition be given probative value?

A.

No. A deposition which did not comply with S1 R23
may not be given probative value. Here the
deposition should have been taken with leave of
court since the defendant has not yet served an
answer. (Georg v. Holy Trinity College, 20 July
2016, Perez, J.).

Q.

What is the
deponent?

Unless otherwise provided by the court in a
protective or limiting order, the deponent may be
examined regarding any matter, not privileged,

96
Under the 1997 Rules, a motion was not required in order to take the
deposition of a person after the answer had been served. The party simply had to
serve a notice to take deposition to every other party to the action. (S1 & S15 R23).

which is relevant to the subject of the pending
action, whether relating to the claim or defense of
any party, including the existence, description,
nature, custody, condition, and location of any
books, documents, or other tangible things and the
identity and location of persons having knowledge
of relevant facts. (S2 R23).
Q.

May deponents be examined and cross-examined?

A.

Yes. Examination and cross-examination of
deponents may proceed as permitted at the trial
under S3-18 R132. (S3 R23).

Q.

In what proceedings may a deposition be used?

A.

At the trial or upon the hearing of a motion or an
interlocutory proceeding. (S4 R24)

Q.

Against whom may a deposition be used?

A.

Against any party who was present or represented
at the taking of the deposition or who had due
notice thereof.

Q.

For what purposes may a deposition be used?

A.

The purpose for which a deposition may be used
depends on who the deponent is and on who will
be using the deposition. Section 4 of Rule 23 lays
down the relevant rules:
a)

Any deposition may be used by any party for
the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the
testimony of the deponent as a witness. This is
a common use of a deposition, to impeach a
witness who is under cross-examination.

b) The deposition of a party or of any one who at
the time of the taking the deposition was an
523

officer, director, or managing agent of a public
or private corporation, partnership, or association
which is a party may be used by an adverse
.Qfil1yfor any gur12ose.
c)

The deposition of a witness, whether or not a
.Qfil!y, may be used by any party for any
purpose if the court finds (DOSUE): (1) that the
witness is gead; or (2) that the witness resides
at a distance more than 100 kilometers from
the place of trial or hearing, or is out of the
Philippines, unless it appears that his absence
was procured by the party offering the
deposition; (3) that the witness is is gnable to
attend or testify because of age, sickness,
infirmity, or imprisonment; or (4) that the party
offering the deposition has been unable to
procure the attendance of the witness by
2 ubpoena; or (5) upon application and notice,
that such gxceptional circumstances exist as to
make it desirable, in the interest of justice and
with due regard to the importance of presenting
the testimony of witnesses orally in open court,
97
to allow the deposition to be used.
(S4 R23).
The deposition in such a case is admissible in
evidence as an exception to the hearsay rule.
(ANTONIO R. BAUTISTA, BASIC CIVIL
PROCEDURE 124 [2003 ed.]; United States
Federal Rules of Evidence, Sec. 804[b][1 ]). If
the deposition is taken not in the same case but
in a former case or proceeding, it is governed
not by S4(c) R23 but by S47 R130.

97
The determination of whether "exceptional circumstances" exist is very
fact sensitive and different for each case. An example given in an American
case is the need to protect deponents from harassment and threats in case they
testified in open court. (Lozano v. City of Hazleton, US District Court for Middle
District of Pennsylvania, No. 3:06cv1856).

Q.

Cleary, a U.S. citizen residing in California,
filed before the RTC of Cebu an action for
specific performance with damages against the
Respondents. Respondents filed their answers.
Prior to trial, Cleary moved for court
authorization to take deposition. Invoking
S4(c)(2) R23, Cleary prayed that the deposition
be taken before the Consulate-General of the
Philippines in Los Angeles, California, and that
the same be used as his direct testimony as he
"is out of the Philippines." Respondents opposed
the motion on the following grounds (1) Clearylfi
was the plaintiff himself and therefore the
deposition was not for discovery purposes
since Cleary cannot discover anything from his
own testimony, (2) Respondents would be
deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine
Cleary, and (3) Cleary was not suffering from
any impairment which would prevent him from

525

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

testifying in the Philippines. May Cleary's
deposition be taken in L.A. and be used by him
in the Philippines against Respondents for any
purpose pursuant to S4(c) R23?

A.

Yes. The argument that the deposition may not be
allowed since Cleary is the plaintiff himself is
erroneous since under S1 R23, the testimony of a
person, whether a party or not, may be taken
by deposition. This provision does not make
any distinction or restriction as to who can avail
of a deposition.
The argument that Respondents would be
deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine Cleary
is without merit. Depositions may be used without
the deponent being actually called to the witness
stand by the proponent under the conditions and
instances mentioned in S4 R23. One instance is
when the deponent "is out of the Philippines" as
stated in S4(c)(2) R23, in which case the deposition
"may be used by any party for any purpose."
The argument that Cleary was not suffering
from any impairment also does not hold water.
S4(c)(2) R23 does not qualify as to the condition of
the deponent who is outside of the Philippines.
(Santamaria v. Cleary, 15 June 2016, Leanen, J.).

Q.

May only part of a deposition be offered in
evidence by a party?

A.

Yes. In such a case, the adverse party may require
him to introduce all of it which is relevant to the part
introduced, and any party may introduce any other
parts. (S4[d] R23).

526
J9JC9B0M

Rule 23
Depositions Pending Actions

Q.

May a deposition be offered to prove the truth
of the facts set forth therein, in lieu of the actual
oral testimony of the deponent in open court?

A.

No. The deposition may be opposed by the adverse
party and excluded under the hearsay rule - i.e.,
that the adverse party had or has no opportunity to
cross-examine the deponent at the time that his
testimony is offered. That opportunity for crossexamination was afforded during the taking of the
deposition alone is no argument, as the opportunity
for cross-examination must normally be accorded a
party at the time that the testimonial evidence is
actually presented against him during the trial or
hearing of a case. (Republic v. Sandiganbayan, 16
December 2011 ).
However, under certain conditions and for
certain limited purposes laid down in Section 4,
Rule 23 of the Rules of Court, the deposition may
be used without the deponent being actually called
to the witness stand. Thus: (IPD)
1) Under S4(a) R23 the deposition may be used by
any party for the purpose of impeaching or
contradicting the testimony of the deponent as a
witness. This is not covered by the hearsay rule
since the purpose is not to prove the truth of the
facts in the deposition but only to impeach or
contradict the deponent's testimony in court.
2)

The deposition of a Q.fil1yor of any one who at
the time of taking the deposition was an officer,
director, or managing agent of a public or
private corporation, partnership, or association
which is a party may be used by an adverse
party for any purpose, including to prove the
527

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

truth of the matter stated in the deposition. The
reason for this is that the depositions are in the
nature of party-admissions which are excluded
from the hearsay rule.
3)

The deposition of a witness, whether or not a
party, may be used by any party for any
purpose if the court finds that any of the
circumstances in S4(c) R23 (DOSUE) is
present. This is in effect an exception to
the hearsay rule. (ANTONIO R. BAUTISTA,
BASIC CIVIL PROCEDURE 124(ANTONIO R.
BAUTISTA, BASIC CIVIL PROCEDURE 124
[2003 ed.]; FRE 804[b][1]).

Q.

Pedro files a tort case against Dencio. Before
the trial, Pedro with prior notice to Dencio, took
the deposition of Weng, wherein Weng stated
that Dencio entered the intersection when the
stoplight was red against him. Since he had
already taken the deposition of Weng, Pedro no
longer presents Weng as a witness during the
trial and instead offers in evidence her
deposition to prove that Dencio entered the
intersection when the stoplight was red. Dencio
objects to the offer of the deposition on the
ground that the same is hearsay. Should the
objection be sustained?

A.

Yes. The deposition may be objected to by the
adverse party on the ground that it is hearsay - i.e.,
that the adverse party had or has no opportunity to
cross-examine the deponent at the time that his
testimony is offered. That opportunity for crossexamination was afforded during the taking of the
deposition alone is no argument, as the opportunity
for cross-examination must normally be accorded a

actually presented against him during the trial or

trial, Pedro with prior notice to Dencio, took the
deposition of Weng, wherein Weng stated that
Dencio entered the intersection when the

deposition was taken, she went to the United
States and became a permanent resident
therein.Pedro offers in evidence her deposition to
prove that Dencio entered the intersection when
the stoplight was red. Dencio objects to the offer
of the deposition on the ground that the same is
hearsay. Should the objection be sustained?
A.

No the objection should be overruled. Under S4(c)
R23 the deposition of a witness may be used by
any party for any purpose if the court finds that the
witness is out of the Philippines. In such a case
Weng's deposition may be used without actually
calling her to the witness stand. (Republic v.
Sandiganbayan, id.) In effect S4(c) R23 provides
for a hearsay exception. (ANTONIO R. BAUTISTA,

Q.

Respondent filed a case against the Petitioner for
damages arising from a vehicular accident which
killed Respondent's son. Respondent then took
the deposition of Corral before the Clerk of Court
of the Pasig RTC. During the deposition, the
Petitioner's counsel extensively cross-examined
the deponent. At the conclusion of Respondent's
testimonial evidence, he offered in evidence the
deposition of Corral and a certification from the
BID that Corral had departed for abroad on a
plane. Petitioner opposed the admission of the
deposition on the ground that the same did not
meet any of the conditions provided for in S4(c)
R23. Petitioner contended that the BID certification
is not proof that Corral was still out of the
country. ls the deposition admissible in evidence?

A.

Yes. The BID certification is adequate proof that
Corral was out of the country. The onus was on
Petitioner to prove his allegation that the deponent
had returned to the Philippines. ( Sa/es v. Sabino, 9

Q.

In 1987, the Republic, through the PCGG, filed
Civil Case No. 0009, an action for reconveyance
and reversion, against Jose Africa, Ferdinand
Marcos, Imelda Marcos, Juan Ponce Enrile, et
al. The complaint alleges that shares in Eastern
Telecommunications Philippines Inc. (ETPI) were
illegally acquired for the beneficial interest of the
Marcoses. Subsequently Victor Africa, the son of
Jose Africa who had died, filed Civil Case No.
0130 with the Sandiganbayan against the PCGG
seeking to nullify the PCGG orders asking him to
surrender the ETPI shares and to desist from
acting as an ETPI director and shareholder.
Subsequently the SB ordered the consolidation
of CC No. 0009 with several incident cases
including CC No. 0130. The PCGG in CC No.
0130 took the deposition of Maurice Bain, a
former officer of ETPI, in London. The deposition
was sought to be introduced by the PCGG in CC
No. 0009. The Respondents objected on the
ground that the deposition did not comply with
S47 R130 which requires identity of parties,
they not having been parties to CC No. 0138;
The PCGG on the other hand argues that since
CC No. 0009 and CC No. 0130 were consolidated,
the actions were merged into one and hence it
is S4(c) R23 and not S47 R130 which applies.
Under S4(c) R23 the deposition may be
introduced in evidence for any purpose if the
deponent is outside of the Philippines. Is the
deposition admissible in CC No. 0009?

A.

No. The consolidation here was merely for purposes
of joint trial but each case retained its separate
character and required the entry of a separate
judgment The consolidation did not merge CC No.

532
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

Rule 23
Depositions Pending Actions

0009 and CC No. 0130 into a single action and cause
the parties in one to be the parties to another. Thus
the deposition was not taken in CC No. 0009 but in a
separate or former proceeding, CC No. 0130, in
which case the requirements of S47 R130 requiring
identity of parties applies. Since the Respondents
were not parties to CC No. 0130, the deposition
taken therein was hearsay as against them and
inadmissible upon proper and timely objection.
(Republic v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. 152375, 16
December 2011).
Q.

P filed an action for collection against D (Case
1) with the deposition of X being taken therein.
The court dismissed Case 1 and the order of

Case 2 against D. Case 2 involves the same
subject matter. May P introduce in Case 2 the
deposition of X if any of the circumstances in
Section 4(c)(1) to (5) of R23 are present?

A.

Yes. Under S5 R23, when an action has been
dismissed and another action involving the same
subject is afterward brought between the same
parties or their representatives or successors in
interest, all depositions lawfully taken and duly filed
in the former action ma~ be used in the latter as if
originally taken therefor. 9

Q.

Is a party deemed to have made a person his
own witness by taking his deposition?

99
The requirement that the prior action must have been dismissed before
depositions taken for use in it can be used in a subsequent action was considered an
oversight by U.S. courts who have ignored this requirement. See Wright &
Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil §2150. What is important is that the
second action involves the same parties and subject matter.

533

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

No. A party shall not be deemed to make a person
his own witness for any purpose by taking his
deposition. (S7 R23). This is why under S4(a) R23
any deposition may be used by any party for the
purpose of contradicting or impeaching the
testimony of the deponent as a witness.

Q.

What is the effect of using depositions?

A.

The rule is that the introduction in evidence of the
deposition or any part thereof makes the deponent
the witness of the party introducing the deposition.
(S8 R23). Hence the party may not impeach the
deponent. (S12 R132).
The exceptions to the foregoing rule are:
1) When the deposition is introduced in evidence
precisely for the purpose of contradicting or
impeaching the testimony of deponent as a
witness. (S8 R23; S4[a] R23).
2)

Q.

The use by a party of the deposition of an
adverse party or of an officer, director, or

intersection. May Plaintiff use the deposition of
Juan to impeach his testimony as a witness?
534

J9JC9B0M

A.

Yes but he should first have the court declare Juan

Q.

Before whom may a deposition be taken in the
Philippines?

A.

Within the Philippines, depositions may be taken
before: (JuNA)
1) A judge.
2)

A notary public.

3) A person authorized to administer oaths if the
parties so stipulate in writing. (S10 R23; S14 R23).
Q.

Before whom may a deposition be taken in
foreign countries?

A

In a foreign state or country, depositions may be
taken: (LACE)
1) On notice before a secretary of §.mbassy or
legation, consul general, consul, vice-consul, or
consular agent of the Republic of the
Philippines.
2)

.Qommissionor under letters rogatory.

3)

A person authorized to 9-dminister oaths if
the parties so stipulate in writing. (S11 R23;
S14 R23).

Q.

Distinguish a commission from a letters rogatory.

A.

Letters rogatory and commission are both devices
for taking the deposition of a person in a foreign
state or country. (S12 R23). A commission is an
instrument issued by a court or tribunal directed
535

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

to a magistrate or an individual authorizing him to
take the deposition of the witness named therein,
while a letters rogatory is a request to a foreign
court to give its aid, backed by its power, to secure
desired information. They are distinguished in that
commissions are taken down in accordance with the
rules laid down by the court issuing the commission,
while in letters rogatory, the methods of procedure
are under the control of the foreign tribunal. (Dulay
v. Dulay, 11 Nov 2005).
Q.

In a pending case with the RTC, Rodrigo filed a
petition for issuance of letters rogatory in order
to get the depositions of several witnesses
living abroad. The RTC granted the petition and
issued letters rogatory requesting the Clerk of
Court of Boston to take the depositions but the
latter simply ignored the request. Hence the
depositions were instead taken before a notary
public in New York. The RTC then ordered the
depositions authenticated by the Philippine
consulate. The Defendant objected to the
admissibility of the depositions on the ground
that they were not in accordance with the
terms of the letters rogatory issued by the
Court. Are the depositions admissible?

A.

Yes. The authentication made by the consul was a
ratification of the authority of the notary public who
took the questioned depositions. The deposition
was, in effect, obtained through a commission and
no longer through letters rogatory. (Dulay v. Dulay,
11 Nov 2005).

Q.

How does a party take the deposition of a
person upon oral examination?

536

Rule 23
Depositions Pending Actions

A.

A party desiring to take the deposition of any
person upon oral examination shall give reasonable
notice in writing to every other party to the action.
The notice shall state the time and place for taking
the deposition and the name and address of each
person to be examined, if known, and if the name is
not known, a general description sufficient to
identify him or the particular class or group to which
he belongs. (S15 R23).
Proof of service of a notice to take deposition
shall constitute sufficient authorization for the
issuance of subpoenas for the persons named in
said notice by the clerk of court of the place in which
the deposition is to be taken. The clerk shall not,
however, issue a subpoena duces tecum to any
such person without an order of the court. (S5 R21 ).

Q.

How shall an oral deposition be taken?

A.
1)

The officer before whom the deposition is to be
taken shall put the witness on oath and shall
personally, or by some one acting under his
direction and presence, record the testimony of
the witness.

2)

The testimony shall be taken stenographically
unless the parties agree otherwise.

3)

Examination and cross-examination of deponents
may proceed as permitted at the trial under S318 R132. (S3 R23).

4)

All objections made at the time of the
examination to the qualifications of the officer
taking the deposition, or to the manner of taking
it, or to the evidence presented, or to the
537

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

conduct of any party, and any other objection to
the proceedings (OMECO), shall be noted by
the officer upon the deposition. Evidence
objected to shall be taken subject to the
objections. Note that the officer has no power
to rule on the objections.
5)

In lieu of participating in the oral examination,
parties served with notice of taking a deposition
may transmit written interrogatories to the
officers, who shall propound them to the witness
and record the answers verbatim.(S17 R23).

Q.

What is the sanction if a party or an officer or
managing agent of a party willfully fails to appear
before the officer who is to take his deposition,
after being served with a proper notice?

A.

Aside from contempt, the court on motion and
notice may strike out all or any part of any pleading
of that party, or dismiss the action or proceeding or
any part thereof,· or enter a judgment by default
against that party, and in its discretion, order him to
pay reasonable expenses incurred by the other,
including attorney's fees. (S5 R29).

Q.

E, the chairman of one of the plaintiff
corporations was the deponent in a complaint
against ALI. Upon termination of the oral
deposition, ALI objected to the propriety,
admissibility and conformity of the deposition
proceedings. Later, E died and his deposition was
introduced in evidence. Can a deposition which
was not completed, signed and certified, or filed
before the trial court be used in evidence?

538
J9JC9B0M

Rule 23
Depositions Pending Actions

A.

Yes. An unsigned deposition does not preclude its
use during the trial. A deponent's signature only
goes to the form and the signature is required only to
ensure that the deponent is afforded the opportunity
to correct any errors therein and ensure its accuracy.
(Ayala Land Inc. vs Tagle, 11 August 2005)

Q.

When should the objections to a deposition
be made?

A.
1) As to competency or relevancy of testimony.
Objections should be made when the deposition
is being offered in evidence. (S6 R23). Objections
to the competency of a witness or the
competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony
are not waived by failure to make them before
or during the taking of the deposition, unless
the ground of the objection is one which might
have been obviated or removed if presented
at that time.
The test to determine whether "the ground of
the objection might have been obviated or removed
if presented at that time" is whether the objection.It
will give the other party an opportunity to cure the
deficiency of his proof. An example would be the
lack of qualification of an expert, which may be
cured by objecting at the time of the taking of
the deposition.
2)

As to form of notice and as to disqualification of
officer. All errors and irregularities in the notice
for taking a deposition are waived unless
written objection is promptly served upon the
party giving the notice. Objections to taking a
deposition because of disqualification of the
539

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

officer before whom it is to be taken is waived
unless made before the taking of the deposition
begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification
becomes known or could be discovered with
reasonable diligence.
Q.

Plaintiff versus Defendant. Plaintiff took the
deposition of W, Defendant's former lawyer,
concerning W's advice to Defendant on the
anticipated litigation between Plaintiff and
Defendant. Defendant's lawyer X who was
present did not object. At the conclusion of
Plaintiff's testimonial evidence, Plaintiff offered
in evidence the deposition of W for the purpose
of proving the communication
between
Defendant and W. Defendant objected to the
admission of the deposition on the ground that
it violates the attorney-client privilege. Plaintiff
retorted that Defendant waived the privilege
when he failed to object during the deposition
taking. How would you rule on the objection?

A.

I would sustain the objection.
Objections to the competency or relevancy of
the testimony of the deponent should be made
when the deposition is being offered in evidence.
Such objections are not waived by failure to make
them before or during the taking of the deposition,
unless the ground of the objection is one which
might have been obviated or removed if presented
at that time. (S6 R23).
Here the objection relates to the competency
of W's testimony. The ground for the objection
(violation of the attorney-client privilege) would not
have been obviated or removed even if presented
540

Rule 23
Depositions Pending Actions

during the deposition-taking. Hence the same is not
waived even if Defendant failed to object during
the deposition taking.
Q.

Plaintiff versus Defendant. Plaintiff took the
deposition of W. W testified about the contents
of a letter but without laying the predicate for
his oral testimony. Defendant's lawyer who was
present did not object. At the conclusion of
Plaintiff's testimonial evidence, Plaintiff offered
in evidence the deposition of W for the purpose
of proving the contents of the letter. Defendant
objected to the admission of the deposition on
the ground that it violates the best evidence
rule. How would you rule on the objection?

A.

I would overrule the objection.
Objections to the competency of a witness or
the competency, relevancy, or materiality of
testimony are not waived by failure to make them
before or during the taking of the deposition, unless
the ground of the objection is one which might have
been obviated or removed if presented at that time.
(S6 R23).
Here the ground of the objection, that is, the
failure to comply with the best evidence rule might
have been obviated or removed if presented during
the deposition taking: W could have laid the
foundation for his oral testimony by testifying as to
the unavailability of the original. Hence the objection
should be overruled. (2 MANUEL V. MORAN,
COMMENTS ON THE RULES OF COURT 73
[1979 ed.]).

RULE 24. DEPOSITIONS BEFORE
ACTION OR PENDING APPEAL
Q.

Pedro intends to file a tort case against Dencio.
He intends to use the testimony of Winnie as a
key witness but the latter will shortly be going
to the United States to work as a nurse. What is
the remedy of Pedro?

A.

Pedro should avail of S1 R24 which states that a
person who desires to perpetuate his own
testimony or that of another person regarding any
matter that may be cognizable in any court of the
Philippines, may file a verified petition in the court
of the place of the residence of any expected
adverse party.

Q.

Give the rule regarding depositions pending appeal.

A.

!f an appeal has been taken from a judgment of a
court, including the Court of Appeals in proper
cases, or before the taking of an appeal if the time
therefore has not expired, the court in which the
judgment was rendered may allow the taking of
depositions of witnesses to perpetuate their testimony
for use in the event of further proceedings in the said
court. In such case the party who desires to
perpetuate the testimony may make a motion in the
said court for leave to take the depositions, upon
the same notice and service thereof as if the action
was pending therein. (S7 R24).

542
J9JC9B0M

RULE 25. INTERROGATORIES
TO PARTIES
Q.

What are interrogatories? What is their use?

A.

A pretrial discovery method in which written
questions are propounded by one party and served
on the adverse party, who must serve written
replies thereto under oath. (STEVEN GIFIS, LAW
DICTIONARY 109 [1975]). It is used by a party
desiring to elicit material and relevant facts from an
adverse party. (S1 R25). The terms "interrogatories"
and "written interrogatories" are synonymous.

Q.

How and when may a party serve interrogatories
upon an adverse party?

A.

Upon ex parte motion, any party desiring to elicit
material and relevant facts from any adverse
parties shall file and serve upon the latter written
interrogatories to be answered by the party served
or, if the party served is a public or private
corporation or a partnership or association, by any
officer thereof competent to testify in its behalf. (S1
R25, as amended in the 2020 Rules of Civil
Procedure).

Q

Who shall answer interrogatories?

A

Interrogatories shall be answered by the party
served or, if the party served is a public or private
corporation or a partnership or association, by any
officer thereof competent to testify in its behalf. (S1
R25).

100

100

Under the 1997 Rules, a motion was not required in order to file and
serve written interrogatories upon a party after the answer had been served.

543
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

How and when are interrogatories answered?

A.

The interrogatories shall be answered fully in writing
and shall be signed and sworn to by the person
making them. The party upon whom the
interrogatories have been served shall file and serve
a copy of the answers on the party submitting the
interrogatories within 15 days after service thereof,
unless the court on motion and for good cause
shown, extends or shortens the period. (S2 R25).

Q.

What is the consequence if a party fails to serve
answers to interrogatories?

A.

The court on motion and notice may strike out all or
any part of any pleading of that party, or dismiss
the action or proceeding or any part thereof, or
enter a judgment by default against that party, and
in its discretion, order him to pay reasonable
expenses incurred by the other, including attorney's
fees. (S5 R29).

Q.

What is the effect of failure to serve written
interrogatories?

A.

Unless thereafter allowed by the court for good
cause shown and to prevent a failure of justice, a
party not served with written interrogatories may not
be compelled by the adverse party to: (1) give
testimony in open court, or (2) to give a deposition
pending appeal. (S6 R25). Thus a party not served
with interrogatories may not be called as an
adverse party witness by the other side.

Q.

Jacob filed a complaint for annulment of loan
and mortgage contract against Petro Bank on
the ground of fraud. Petro Bank filed an answer
denying any fraud against Jacob.3 After the

544

Rule 25
Interrogatories To Parties

termination of the pretrial, Jacob filed an ex
parte motion for the issuance of a subpoena
duces tecum and ad testificandum to the senior
loan manager of Petro Bank to appear and
testify in the initial hearing for the presentation
of Jacob's evidence as Jacob's first witness
and to bring documents relative to Jacob's
loan. Counsel of Petro Bank opposed the
motion the ground that under the Rules of Civil
Procedure, a party not served with written
interrogatories may not be compelled by the
adverse party to give testimony in open court.
Jacob argued that it is Petro Bank not the
employees who is the party and hence he could
compel the employees to testify in court. How
should the court rule on Jacob's motion?
A.

The court should deny Jacob's motion. Under S6
R25 a party not served with written interrogatories
may not be compelled by the adverse party to give
testimony in open court. The Supreme Court has held
that if the party not served with written interrogatories
is a corporation, its officers are the ones who cannot
be so compelled to give testimony.
Here Petro Bank was not served with written
interrogatories by Jacob. Hence Petro Bank's senior
loan manager, an officer, cannot be compelled by
Jacob to give testimony in open court. (Afulugencia
v. Metro Bank, 5 Feb 2014).

Q.

China Bank filed with the RTC a loan collection
case against Ever Electrical Mfg. Co. and Ng
Meng Tam, a surety to Ever's loan. Ng filed an
answer with affirmative defense of the nullity of
the suretyship contract. Ng moved for a
preliminary hearing on his affirmative defense
545

which was granted. After serving written
interrogatories on George Yap, China Bank's
account officer, and receiving Yap's answers
thereto, Ng applied for the issuance of a
subpoena duces tecum and ad testificandum
against George Yap. China Bank objected,
arguing that Yap cannot be compelled to testify
in court because Ng did not obtain and present
Yap's judicial affidavit pursuant to Section 5 of
the Judicial Affidavit Rule (JAR). Should China
Bank's objection be sustained?

A.

No. Section 5 of the JAR expressly excludes from
its application adverse party and hostile witnesses.
For the presentation of these types of witnesses,
the provisions on the Rules of Court under the
Revised Rules of Evidence and all other correlative
rules including the modes of deposition and
discovery rules shall apply. Here it is enough for
the party calling the adverse party witness to serve .
beforehand written interrogatories pursuant to S6
R25 and the case of Afulugencia v. Metropolitan
Bank & Trust Co., 715 SCRA 399 (2014), which
was done in this case. (Ng Meng Tam v. China
Banking Corp., 5 August 2015).

Q.

Is it proper to object to written interrogatories
on the ground that they constitute a "fishing
expedition"?

A.

No. The refusal to answer written interrogatories on
the ground that they constitute a "fishing
expedition" is not a meritorious ground. Precisely
the purpose of discovery is to enable a party to
obtain relevant facts from the other party in
advance of trial so as to facilitate settlement or to
expedite the trial. (Ong v. Mazo, 4 June 2004).

546

RULE 26. ADMISSION BY
ADVERSE PARTY
Q.

When and how may a request for admission
be made?

A.

At any time after issues have been joined, a party
may file and serve upon any other party a written
request for the admission by the latter of:
1) The genuineness of any material and relevant
document described in and exhibited with the
request; or
2)

The truth of any material and relevant matter of
fact set forth in the request.101

Copies of the documents shall be delivered
with the request unless copies have already been
furnished. (S1 R26).
Q.

When are issues deemed to have been joined?

A.

Issues are considered to have been joined when
the parties have become aware of what issues in
the case are in dispute. Issues are deemed to have
been joined after the defendant has filed his answer
and the plaintiff has filed his reply thereto or the
period for filing the reply has expired. Under the
1964 Rules the forerunner of the phrase "issues
have been joined" was "the pleadings are closed,"
which has the same import. (2 MANUEL V. MORAN,
COMMENTS ON THE RULES OF COURT 88
[1979 ed.]).

101
unlke the taking of depositions and the filing and service of written
interrogatories, an ex parte motion is not required under R26.

Q.

P filed a complaint against D. D filed a motion to
dismiss, May P served a request for admission
on D?

A.

No, since issues have not yet been joined. ( See S1
R26).

Q.

P filed a complaint against D. D failed to file his
answer and was declared in default upon P's
motion, The court directed P to present evidence
ex parte. May P serve requests for admission
upon D?

A.

No, since issues were not joined.

Q.

On whom must the request for admission be
served?

A.

A request for admission must be served directly
upon the party requested. Otherwise, that party
cannot be deemed to have admitted the genuineness
of any relevant matters of fact set forth therein
on account of failure to answer the request
for admission. (Laflada v. CA, G.R. 102390, 1
February 2002).

Q.

May a party on whom the request for admission
is served engage the services of counsel to
make the response in his behalf?

A.

Yes. When R26 states that a party shall respond to
the request for admission, it should not be
restrictively construed to mean that a party may not
engage the services of counsel to make the
response in his behalf. This is especially so where
the request for admission was served not directly
upon the party requested but upon his lawyer. It is
unfair for the private respondents to expect the
petitioners to answer the requests for admission
548

Rule 26
Admission By Adverse Party

that they did not personally receive. (Lanada v. CA,
G.R. No. 102390, 1 February 2002).
Q.

Through his lawyer plaintiff A sent to defendant
B, through B's counsel, a request for admission
of certain facts stated therein material to the case
pending between them. B did not reply at all.
On appeal from an adverse decision, A
assigned as error the trial court's disregard of
the facts, the admission of which was the
subject of his unanswered request. A contended
that as his request for admission forms part of
the records of the case, although not formally
submitted in evidence, and the records do not
show that the defendant ever replied thereto,
there was a clear judicial admission by the
defendant of all the material facts stated in the
request, and that had the trial court considered
said admissions, it would have made contrary
findings of facts. Is the plaintiff correct? Why?
(84 Bar Q10).

A.

No, the plaintiff is not correct.
The Supreme Court has held that a request for
admission must be served directly upon the party
requested. Otherwise, that party cannot be deemed
to have admitted the genuineness of any relevant
matters of fact set forth therein on account of failure
to answer the request for admission.
Here the request for admission was not served
directly upon defendant B but upon B's counsel.
Hence the failure of B to answer the request for
admission did not amount to an implied admission
of the matters stated in the request. (Lanada v. CA,
G.R. 102390, 1 February 2002).

Q.

May a party be requested to admit facts which
he had already denied in his answer?

A.

No. A request for admission is not proper where the
subject matters thereof are the same as the
ultimate facts alleged in the requesting party's
complaint for which the requested party had
already denied in his answer. A party should not be
required to make a second denial of those already
denied in his answer to the complaint. (Lanada v.
CA, G.R. No. 102390, 1 February 2002).

Q.

The petitioners spouses Duque allegedly executed
a deed of donation of a parcel of land in favor of
their daughter who in turn sold a portion thereof
to Yu. Spouses Duque lodged a Verified
Complaint for Declaration of Non-Existence and
Nullity of a Deed of Donation and Deed of
Absolute Sale and Cancellation of Tax Declaration
(Complaint) against their daughter and Yu
before the Regional Trial Court (RTCj of Barili,
Cebu, alleging that the signature in the Deed of
Donation was forged. Yu served a request for
admission on the petitioners regarding the
genuineness of the deed of donation. The
petitioners failed to answer the request for
admission. Are they deemed to have admitted
the genuineness of the deed of donation?

A.

No. The implied admission rule under R26 admits
of an exception, that is, when the party to whom
such request for admission is served had already
controverted the matters subject of such request
in an earlier pleading. Here, as pointed out by
petitioners, the genuineness of the deed of donation
being requested to be admitted has already been
denied and controverted in the Verified Complaint
550

Rule 26
Admission By Adverse Party

for Declaration of Non-Existence and Nullity of a
Deed of Donation and Deed of Absolute Sale and
Cancellation of Tax Declaration. In fact, the forgery
committed in the Deed of Donation was the very
essence of that Complaint, where it was alleged
that being a forged document, the same is invalid
and without force and legal effect. Petitioners,
therefore, need not reply to the request for
admission. Consequently, they cannot be deemed
to have admitted the Deed of Donation's
genuineness and authenticity for their failure to
respond thereto. (Duque v. Yap, 19 February 2018,
Velasco, J.).
Q.

When and how shall an answer to a request for
admission be made?

A.

Within a period designated in the request, which
shall not be less than 15 days after service thereof,
or within such further time as the court may allow
on motion, the party to whom the request is
directed may file and serve upon the party
requesting the admission a sworn statement either:
(1) denying specifically the matters of which an
admission is requested or (2) setting forth in detail
the reasons why he cannot truthfully either admit or
deny those matters. (S2 R26).

Q.

What is the effect if a request for admission is
not answered in accordance with 52 R26?

A.

Each of the matters of which an admission is
requested shall be deemed admitted. (S2 R26).
Any admission, whether express or implied, is for
the purpose of the pending action only and shall not
constitute an admission by him for any other

551
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

purpose nor may the same be used against him in
any other proceeding. (S3 R26).
Q.

At the close of the trial, A's counsel marked for
identification and offered in evidence certified
copies of a Request for Admission and the
Reply thereto in a previous case between the
opposing party in the instant case, B, and a
third party, C. He offered the documents as
evidence that in the previous case, B had made
a judicial admission of a certain fact material to
the present case, the two-fold purpose thereof
being to impeach B's testimony in the present
case and to establish that certain fact. Should
the court admit the documents in evidence?
Explain. (84 Bar Q11).

A.

The court should not admit the document for the
purpose of proving the certain fact nor for
impeaching B's testimony.
Any admission under R26, whether express or
implied, is for the purpose of the pending action
only and shall not constitute an admission by him
for any other purpose nor may the same be used
against him in any other proceeding. Hence even if
A would lay the predicate for impeachment using
an inconsistent statement, the prior admission
cannot be used against B for S3 R26 states that
"the same [may not] be used against him in any
other proceeding."

Q.

May an admission under Rule 26 be withdrawn
or amended?

A.

Yes, the court may allow a party making an
admission, whether express or implied, to withdraw

552

Rule 26
Admission By Adverse Party

or amend it upon such terms as may be just.
(S4 R26).
Q.

What is the effect if a party after being served
with a request for admission serves a sworn
denial thereof and the party requesting the
admission thereafter proves the genuineness of
a document or the truth of any matter of fact
subject of the request for admission?

A.

The party serving the request for admission may
apply to the court for an order requiring the other
party to pay him the reasonable expenses incurred
in making such proof, including attorney's fees.
Unless the court finds that there were good reasons
for the denial or that admissions sought were of no
substantial importance, such order shall be issued.
(S4 R29).

Q.

Plaintiff filed an action to collect P1 million from
the Defendant. Defendant filed an answer in.ti
which he raised the defense that Plaintiff had
condoned or remitted the P1 million debt of the
Defendant. The parties did not avail of any of
the modes of discovery. During the trial, the
defense offers the testimony of Defendant to
show that Plaintiff had condoned the debt. If
you were the lawyer for the Plaintiff, how will
you respond?

A.

I will object to the offer of the testimony on the
ground that it is excluded by the rules.
Unless otherwise allowed by the court for good
cause shown and to prevent a failure of justice, a
party who fails to file and serve a request for
admission on the adverse party of material and
relevant facts at issue which are, or ought to be,

553
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

within the personal knowledge of the latter, shall
not be permitted to present evidence on such facts.
(S5 R26).
Here the fact of condonation is a material and
relevant fact at issue which is, or ought to be, within
the personal knowledge of the Plaintiff. However
since the Defendant failed to file and to serve a
request for admission of payment on the Plaintiff,
he is not permitted to present evidence regarding
the condonation.
Q.

What is the reason behind 55 R26?

A.

The rule aims to make the parties avail of a request
for admission in order to expedite the trial of the
case. A request for admission expedites the trial of
the case since a fact or a document admitted need
no longer be the subject of proof.

Q.

Respondent obtained on credit from Petitioner
various construction materials which the latter
delivered to the Respondent. Petitioner sued for
the collection of the value of the delivered
materials. The parties agree that there was
delivery but they disagree as to the value of the
delivered materials and the Respondent's total
payments. After the pre-trial, the judge issued
his pre-trial order wherein it was stipulated that
the parties agreed that the Petitioner shall
submit an offer to stipulate showing an itemized
list of construction materials delivered to the
Respondent together with the cost claimed by
Petitioner and the Respondent shall comment/
object thereto. Instead of submitting an offer to
stipulate, the Petitioner filed a request for
admission with the court asking Respondent to

554
J9JC9B0M

Rule 26
Admission By Adverse Party

admit receipt of the items mentioned therein
and that the total amount of the goods was
P315,000 of which Respondent has only paid
P130,000. The Respondent did not answer the
requests for admission under oath although it
submitted a comment admitting certain deliveries
and denying others. Thus the trial court deemed
the Respondent to have admitted the matters
stated in the request for admission. The CA
held otherwise saying that the pre-trial order
stated that the Respondent should only comment/
object to the itemized list. Was there an implied
admission by the Respondent?
A.

Yes. The pre-trial order stating that the parties have
agreed that the Petitioner shall submit an offer to
stipulate showing an itemized list of construction
materials delivered to the Respondent together with
the cost claimed by Petitioner and that the
Respondent shall comment/object thereto cannot
preclude the Petitioner from availing of Rule 26.
Said Rule cannot be disregarded since it is a
remedy afforded any party after issues have been
joined. Since the Respondent failed to answer
under oath the requests for admission, he is
deemed to have impliedly admitted the matters
stated therein. (Manzano v. Despabiladeras, G.R.
No. 148786, 16 December 2004).

RULE 27. PRODUCTION OR INSPECTION
OF DOCUMENTS OR THINGS
Q.

Discuss briefly the discovery device of
production or inspection of documents or things.

A.

Upon motion of any party showing good cause
therefor, the court in which the action is pending
may (a) order any party to produce and permit the
inspection, copying, or photographing of any
designated documents or things, not privileged,
which constitute or contain evidence material to any
matter involved in the action and which are in the
possession or control of such party; or (b) order any
party to permit entry upon designated land or other
property in his possession or control for inspection
by the other party of such land or property which is
relevant to the case.

Q.

Distinguish Rule 27 from subpoena duces tecum.

A.

A motion for a production or inspection order is a
pre-trial discovery device intended to obtain facts or
documents in order to prepare for trial; the movant
may opt not to use such facts or documents, while
a subpoena is a process used during the trial
proper and contemplates that the party applying for

A motion and a showing of good cause is

directed to a nonparty.
Q.

Air Philippines Corporation (APC) purchased
chemical lubricants from Pennswell, a company
that manufactures and sells aviation lubricants.
Pennswell sued APC for unpaid purchases. In
its answer, APC alleged that Pennswell had
undertaken to deliver lubricants of the type
belonging to a new line, but that the second
batch of lubricants delivered turned out to be of
the same type as the first batch. APC wanted to
prove fraud by showing the court the chemical
composition of Pennswell's lubricants. During
trial, it filed a motion under Rule 27 to compel
Pennswell to give a detailed list of the chemical
ingredients and composition of their lubricants.
Pennswell objected, claiming that the list
constitutes trade secrets which it could not be
forced to divulge. It argued that its products are
specialized lubricants, and if their components
were revealed, its business competitors could
easily imitate and market the same types of
products. May Pennswell be compelled under
Rule 27 to disclose the chemical ingredients
and composition of its lubricants?

A.

No. While under Rule 27, a party may move for an
order requiring the production or inspection of
objects or tangible things, such objects or things
must not be privileged. Here the chemical composition
and ingredients of the lubrica-nts are trade secrets.
A trade secret is "a secret formula or process not
patented, but known only to certain individuals
using it in compounding some article of trade
557

J9JC9B0M

REMEDIAL LAW

having a commercial value." Trade secrets are
privileged matter whose disclosure is proscribed
and penalized under the Securities Regulation
Code and under the Revised Penal Code. The
chemical ingredients and composition of the
aviation lubricants of Pennswell clearly fall within
the definition of trade secrets and are thus
privileged. (Air Philippines Corp. v. Pennswe/1 /nc.,
G.R. No. 172835, 13 December 2007).
Q.

Petitioner wife filed a petition with the Family
Court for the declaration of the nullity of her
marriage to her Respondent husband on the
ground of the latter's psychological incapacity.
During the pre-trial, Petitioner filed a request for
the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum
addressed to the hospital covering the
Respondent's records for alleged drug-addiction
treatment and rehabilitation. Respondent's
lawyer objects to the motion invoking the
physician-patient privilege. Petitioner's lawyer
retorts that the objection is premature as the
records are not yet being offered in evidence
and, assuming that the objection is not
premature, that the physician-patient privilege
bars only testimonial evidence since it refers
only to the disqualification of the physician to
testify on a matter learned in confidence but
does not otherwise bar the production of
documentary evidence. How should the court
rule on Respondent's objection? Explain.

A.

The court should sustain Respondent's objection.
The Petitioner's application for issuance of
subpoena is premature. She should wait for the
558

J9JC9B0M

Rule 27
Production Or Inspection of
Documents Or Things

trial before making a request for the issuance of
subpoena duces tecum.
It is of course possible to treat Petitioner's
motion for the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum
covering the hospital records as a motion for
production of documents under R27, a discovery
procedure available to a litigant prior to trial. 102 In
such a case, the argument of Petitioner's lawyer that
the objection is premature would be without merit.
Under S1 R27, documents which are privileged
may not be the subject of a motion for production.
Here the documents subject of a motion for
production were covered by the physician-patient
privilege. Hence the adverse party (Respondent)
may object to the motion on the ground that the
documents sought to be produced are privileged and
may not be the subject of a motion for production.
The argument of Petitioner's lawyer that the
physician-patient privilege bars only testimonial
evidence is without merit. The physician-patient
privilege bars not only the physician's testimony on
the confidential information but also the documents
embodying such confidential information. To compel
the physician to disclose such records would in
effect be to compel him to testify against the patient.

102
This statement of the court is incorrect. A motion for production under
R27 can be directed only against a party. The hospital and/or the physicians
were not party to the marriage nullification case. The appropriate procedure for
Petitioner to follow is to depose the physicians, ask them regarding the existence
of documents, and then move for the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum
against the physicians or hospital. (See Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 504).
Of course in such a case, the physicians could invoke the physician-patient
privilege with respect to privileged documents.

559
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Here the documents embody the confidential
information on Respondent's drug rehabilitation
obtained by the physician. Hence the same are
also barred under the physician-patient privilege.
(Chan v. Chan, 24 July 2013).
Q.

Petitioners filed a complaint against Respondents
Abra Valley Colleges, Inc. and its officers for
inspection of corporate books and records.
Respondents filed an answer raising the affirmative
defense that Petitioners are not stockholders-ofrecord of Abra Valley. Petitioners filed a motion
for Production/Inspection of Documents to compel
the respondents to produce the stock-andtransfer book (5TB), but the RTC denied the same - --· · ·
on the ground that STB may be examined only by
a stockholder-of-record. Was the denial proper?

A.

No. The rules of discovery, including S1 R27, are to
be accorded broad and liberal interpretation. The
RTC should have favorably acted on the
Petitioners' Motion for Production/Inspection of
Documents in order to enable the Petitioners to
obtain the fullest possible knowledge of the issues
and facts to be determined in the case and thereby
prevent the trial from being carried on in the dark.
Doing so would not have caused any prejudice to
the Respondents, for, after all, even had the
Petitioners not filed the Motion for Production/
Inspection of Documents, the Respondents would
themselves also be expected to produce the STB in
court in order to substantiate their affirmative
defense that the Petitioners were not stockholdersof-record of Abra Valley. Verily, that there was no
entry or record in the STB showing the Petitioners
to be stockholders of Abra Valley was no valid
justification for the Respondents not to produce the
560

Rule 27
Production Or Inspection of
Documents Or Things

same. Otherwise, the disputable presumption under
S3(e) R131 that "evidence willfully suppressed
would be adverse if produced" could arise against
them. (/nsigne v. Abra Valley Colleges, Inc., 29 July
2015, Bersamin, J.)
Q.

May a motion for production of documents
under R27 be properly denied if made after
rendition of judgment?

A.

Yes. While there is no specific time limit within
which the modes of discovery may be resorted to, it
should be remembered that their primordial
purpose is to expedite the resolution of the case
and avoid delay. Here the motion would only result
in delay. (CIR v SMC, 25 January 2017, Leonen, J.)

Q.

In an administrative proceeding before the Office of
the Government Counsel Legal Services-BSP, may
a party avail of service of written interrogatories
and a motion for production of documents?

A

No. It bears stressing that the proceeding involved
is administrative in nature. Although trial courts are
enjoined to observe strict enforcement of the rules
on evidence, the same does not hold true -for
administrative bodies. The Court has consistently
held that technical rules applicable to judicial
proceedings are not exact replicas of those in
administrative investigations. Recourse to discovery
procedures as sanctioned by the Rules of Court is
then not mandatory for the OGCLS-BSP. Hence,
We cannot subscribe to Norlina's tenacious
insistence for the OGCLS-BSP to strictly adhere to
the Rules of Court so as not to purportedly defeat
her rights. ( Sibayan v. Ada, 17 January 2018,
Velasco, J.).

RULE 28. PHYSICAL AND MENTAL
EXAMINATION OF PERSONS
Q.

What are the requirements for the issuance
of an order for the physical and mental
examination of a party?

A.
1) There should be a motion for good cause
shown and upon notice to the party to be
examined and to all other parties.
2)

Such motion shall specify the time, place,
manner, conditions and scope of the examination
and the person or persons by whom it is to
be made.

3)

The action in which the motion is made is one
in which the mental or physical condition of a
party is in controversy. (S1 & 2, R28).

Q.

A court issued an order requiring a party to
submit to a physical or mental examination.
The party refused to do so. May the court order
the arrest of the disobedient party?

A.

No. The court may impose other penalties such as
rendering a judgment by default or issuing an order
that the physical or mental condition of the
disobedient party shall be taken to be established
for the purposes of the action in accordance with
the claim of the party obtaining the order but the
court cannot order his arrest. (S3[d] R29).

562

Rule 28
Physical And Mental
Examination Of Persons

Q.

Wife filed a marriage nullification case against
her husband. The wife's psychologist sent a
letter to the husband requesting that he submit
to a psychological examination to be undertaken
by the psychologist. The husband denied the
request. If you were the lawyer for the wife,
what legal step would you take?

A.

If I were the wife's lawyer, I would file a motion for
the mental examination of the husband. This is
allowed since the husband's mental or psychological
examination is in controversy in the marriage
nullification case.

Q.

Same facts as in the preceding question. The
court issued the order requiring the husband to
submit to a psychological examination but the
husband refused to do so. May the court order
the arrest of the husband?

A.

No. The court may issue an order that the mental
condition of the disobedient party shall be taken to
be established for the purposes of the action in
accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the
order but the court cannot order his arrest. (S3[d]
R29). Thus the court may issue an order that the
wife is suffering from narcissistic personality disorder
incapacitating her to comply with the essential marital
obligations, as contended by the husband.
Take note however that the court cannot
render a default judgment against the husband
since default judgments are prohibited in marriage
nullification cases. (S3[e] R9; Articles 48 and 60,
Family Code).

Q.

What is the effect if the party examined requests
and obtains a report of the examination so
ordered or takes the deposition of the examiner?

A

He waives any privilege he may have in that action
or any other involving the same controversy,
regarding the testimony of every other person who
has examined or may thereafter examine him in
respect of the same mental or physical
examination.

564

RULE 30. TRIAL
Q.

Define trial.

A.

An examination, usually involving the offering of
testimony before a competent tribunal according to
established procedures, of facts or law put in issue
in a cause for the purpose of determining such
issue. (STEVEN GIFIS, LAW DICTIONARY 212
[1975]). In its narrow sense, trial refers to the stage
of a case when the parties present their evidence
before the court up to the point when the case is
deemed submitted for decision.

Q.

Distinguish trial from hearing.

A.

The two terms are often used interchangeably. A
hearing however is also used in referring to
interlocutory motions, while trial usually refers to the
stage where the parties present their evidence.

Q.

What is the order of trial in civil actions?

A.
1) The plaintiff shall adduce evidence in support
of his complaint.
2)

The defendant shall then adduce evidence in
support of his defense, counterclaim, crossclaim and third-party complaint.

3)

The third-party defendant, if any, shall adduce
evidence of his defense, counterclaim, crossclaim and fourth-party complaint.

4)

The fourth-party, and so forth, if any, shall
adduce evidence of the material facts pleaded
by them.

565
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

5)

The parties against whom any counterclaim or
cross-claim has been pleaded, shall adduce
evidence in support of their defense, in the
order to be prescribed by the court.

6)

The parties may then respectively adduce
rebutting evidence only, unless the court, for
good reasons and in furtherance of justice,
permits them to adduce evidence upon their
original case.

7)

Upon admission of the evidence, the case shall
be deemed submitted for decision, unless the
court directs the parties to argue or to submit
their respective memoranda or any further
pleadings. Note that memoranda are prohibited
under the Rule on Summary Procedure.

If several defendants or third-party defendants,
and so forth, having separate defenses appear by
different counsel, the court shall determine the
relative order of presentation of their evidence.
The trial shall be limited to the issues stated in
the pre-trial order. (S5 R30).
Q.

How is the offer of evidence, the comment or
objection thereo, and the court ruling made?

A.

The offer of evidence, the comment or objection
thereto, and the court ruling shall be made orally in
accordance with S35 to 40 R 132. (S6 R30 as
added in the 2020 Rules).

Q.

What is rebuttal evidence?

A.

Evidence given to explain, repel, counteract, or
disprove facts given in evidence by the adverse party.
(Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th ed., 1983). For

566

Rule 30
Trial

instance the defendant presents evidence of an
expert's finding that his signature to the promissory
note was forged. In rebuttal, the plaintiff may present
his own expert witness to prove that the defendant's
signature on the note is genuine.
Q.

What is reverse trial and when may it be
resorted to? Explain briefly. (07 Bar Q5b)

A.

Reverse trial is a trial in which it is the defendant
or accused who presents his evidence ahead
of the plaintiff or the prosecution, who may then
present rebutting evidence. It is called a reverse
trial since it is the reverse of the usual order of trial
in which it is the plaintiff or prosecution who first
presents evidence.

14
In a civil case, a reverse trial may be resorted
to if the defendant admits the material allegations of
the complaint but interposes a lawful defense. (Yu
v. Mapayo, 29 March 1972). In a criminal case, a
reverse trial may be resorted to if the accused
admits the act or omission charged in the complaint
or information but interposes a lawful defense.
(S11[e] R119).
The reason for conducting a reverse trial is
that the plaintiff or prosecution no longer needs to
adduce evidence to prove a judicial admission.
Q.

May judgment be rendered upon a stipulation
of facts?

A.

Yes. The parties to any action may agree, in
writing, upon the facts involved in the litigation, and
submit the case for judgment on the facts agreed
upon, without the introduction of evidence. If the
parties agree only on some of the facts in issue, the
567

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

trial shall be held as to the disputed facts in such
order as the court shall prescribe. (S6 R30). Take
note however that a judgment upon a stipulation of
facts is not allowed in actions for declaration of
nullity or annulment of marriage and legal
separation. (Articles 48 and 60, Family Code).
Q.

Give the rule regarding reception of evidence.

A.

The judge of the court where the case is pending
shall personally receive the evidence to be
adduced by the parties. (S9 R30).

Q.

What are the exceptions to the rule that it is the
presiding judge who shall personally receive
the evidence?

A.

The court may delegate the reception of evidence
to its clerk of court who is a member of the
bar: (DEW)
1)

In fl_efaultor ft.X parte hearings, or

2)

Where the parties agree in writing (S9 R30).

Q.

Does the clerk of court have the power to rule
on objections to any question or to the
admission of exhibits?

A.

No. Such objections shall be resolved by the court
upon submission of the clerk of court's report and
the transcripts within 10 days from the termination
of the hearing. (S9 R30).

Q.

In a hearing on a motion to dismiss, may the
judge delegate the reception of evidence to the
clerk of court?

A.

No, since this is not an ex parte motion, unless the
parties agree in writing to the delegation.
568

J9JC9B0M

RULE 31. CONSOLIDATION
OR SEVERANCE
Q.

Define consolidation of actions.

A.

The act or process of uniting several actions into
one trial and judgment, by order of court; or the
court may order that one of the actions be tried,
and the others decided without trial according to the
judgment in the one selected. (BLACK'S LAW
th
DICTIONARY 162, 5 abridged ed., [1983]). The
term consolidation of actions" is used interchangeably
with the term "joint trial," although the former
includes the situation wherein some of the
consolidated cases are decided without trial but
according to the result of the one selected.
Consolidation is a procedural device granted to
the court as an aid in deciding how cases in its docket
are to be tried so that the business of the court may
be dispatched expeditiously and with economy while
providing justice to the parties. To promote this end,
the rule permits the consolidation and a single trial of
several cases in the court's docket, or the
consolidation of issues within those cases. (Republic
v. Sandiganbayan, 16 December 2011 ).

Q.

When may a court order the joint hearing, trial,
or consolidation of cases?

A.

When actions involving a common question of law
or fact are pending before the court, it may order a
joint hearing or trial of any or all the matters in issue
in the actions; it may order all the actions
consolidated; and it may make such orders

569
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

concerning proceedings therein as may tend to
avoid unnecessary costs or delay. (S1 R31).
Q.

In what senses is the term "consolidation" used?

A.

In the context of legal procedure, the term
"consolidation" is used in three different senses: (QAT)
1) QUASI-CONSOLIDATION. Where all except
one of several actions are stayed until one is tried,
in which case the judgment in the one trial is
conclusive as to the others. This is not actually
consolidation but is referred to as such.
2) ACTUAL CONSOLIDATION. Where several
actions are combined into one, lose their separate
identity, and become a single action in which a
single judgment is rendered. This is illustrated by a
situation where several actions are pending
between the same parties stating claims which
might have been set out originally in one complaint.
3) CONSOUDATION FOR TRIAL. Where
several actions are ordered to be tried together but
each retains its separate character and requires the
entry of a separate judgment. This type of
consolidation does not merge the suits into a single
action, or cause the parties to one action to be
parties to the other. (See Republic v. Sandiganbayan,
16 December 2011 ).

Q.

When may a court order a separate trial?

A.

The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid
prejudice, may order a separate trial of any claim,
cross-claim, counterclaim, or third-party complaint,
or of any separate issue or of any number of
claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-party
complaints or issues.

Q.

On different dates in January 1986, three radio
commentators announced on radio that the
plaintiff was a drug lord. The plaintiff wanted to
sue the radio commentators for libel.
a) May the plaintiff file a complaint wherein he
joins his causes of action for libel against
the three radio commentators?
b) Assume that the plaintiff decides to file
separate cases for libel against the radio
commentators. May the plaintiff subsequently
move for a joint trial or for the consolidation
of the cases?

A.
a)

No. The joinder of causes of action did not
comply with the rule on joinder of parties which
requires that the right to relief arises from the
same transaction or series of transactions.

b)

Yes P may move for a joint trial or for
consolidation of the cases since there is a
common question of law or fact, i.e., whether P
is a drug lord or not and whether the radio
broadcasts are libelous.

RULE 32. TRIAL BY COMMISSIONER
Q.

When may a case be referred by the court to a
commissioner?

A.

By order of the court, a case may be referred to a
commissioner: (WMPE)
a)

By written consent of both parties;

b)

By motion of either party or on the court's
initiative in the following cases: (LAF)
1) When the trial of an issue of fact requires
the examination of a long account on
either side;
2)

When the taking of an account is necessary
for the information of the court before
judgment, or for carrying a judgment or
order into effect; or

3) When a question of fact, other than upon
the pleadings, arises upon motion or
otherwise, in any stage of a case, or for
carrying a judgment or order into effect.
c)

In expropriation cases for the purpose of
determining just compensation. (S5 R67).

d)

In partition cases, where the parties are unable
to agree upon a partition. (S3 R69).

Q.

What are the powers of the commissioner?

A.

Subject to the limitations and specifications stated
in the order of reference, the commissioner has

572

Rule 32
Trial By Commissioner

and shall exercise the power to regulate the
proceedings in every hearing before him and to do
all acts and take all measures necessary or proper
for the efficient performance of his duties under the
order. He may issue subpoenas and subpoenas
duces tecum, swear witnesses, and unless provided
otherwise in the order of reference, he may rule
upon the admissibility of evidence. The trial or
hearing before him shall proceed in all respects as
it would if held before the court. (S3 R32).
Q.

What is the effect if a witness refuses to obey a
subpoena issued by the commissioner or to
give evidence before him?

A.

The witness shall be deemed in contempt of the
court which appointed the commissioner. (S7 R32).
The commissioner himself has no power to cite the
witness in contempt. Such refusal constitutes an
indirect contempt under S3 R71.

Q.

Upon the completion of the trial or hearing
or proceeding before the commissioner, what
shall he do?

A.

He shall file with the court his report in writing upon
the matters submitted to him by the order of
reference. When his powers are not specified or
limited, he shall set forth his findings of fact and
conclusions of law in his report. He shall attach
thereto all exhibits, affidavits, depositions, papers
and the transcript, if any, of the testimonial
evidence presented before him.

RULE 33. DEMURRER TO EVIDENCE
Q.

What is a demurrer to evidence?

A.

A motion to dismiss filed by the defendant after the
plaintiff has completed the presentation of his
evidence on the ground that upon the facts and the
law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief. (S1 R33).

Q.

What action shall be taken on a demurrer to
evidence?

A.

A demurrer to evidence shall be subject to the
provisions of R15. (S2 R33, 2020 Rules of Civil
Procedure). The opposing party shall file his
opposition to the demurrer to evidence within five
days from receipt thereof. No other submissions
shall be considered by the court in the resolution of
the demurrer. The demurrer shall be resolved by
the court within 15 days from its receipt of the
opposition thereto, or the expiration of the period to ·
file such opposition. (S5[c] R15). The court may call
a hearing on the demurrer to evidence. (S6 R15).

Q.

May the order denying the demurrer to evidence
be the subject of an appeal or a petition
under R65?

A.

No. The order denying the demurrer to evidence
shall not be subject of an appeal or petition for
certiorari, prohibition or mandamus before judgment.
(S2 R33, 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure).

Q.

What risk does the defendant take when he files
a demurrer to evidence?

A.

If the defendant's demurrer is granted but on
appeal the order of dismissal is reversed, he shall
575

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

be deemed to have waived the right to present
evidence. In practical terms, this means that the
plaintiff already wins the case since the appellate
court should forthwith render judgment for the
plaintiff on the basis of his evidence alone. On the
other hand if the demurrer is denied, the defendant
still has the right to present evidence. (Id.).
Q.

Carlos filed a complaint against Pedro in the
Regional Trial Court of Ozamis City for the
recovery of the ownership of a car. Pedro filed
his answer within the reglementary period.
After the pre-trial and actual trial, and after
Carlos has completed the presentation of his
evidence, Pedro moved for the dismissal of the
complaint on the ground that under the facts
proven and the law applicable to the case,
Carlos is not entitled to the ownership of the
car. The Regional Trial Court granted the motion
for dismissal. Carlos appealed the order of
dismissal and the appellate court reversed the
order of the trial court. Thereafter, Pedro filed a
motion with the Regional Trial Court asking the
latter to allow him to present his evidene.
Carlos objected to the presentation of evidence
by Pedro. Should the Regional Trial Court grant
Pedro's motion to present his evidence? Why?

A.

No. Under S1 R33, if a demurrer to evidence is
granted and on appeal the order of dismissal is
reversed, the movant shall be deemed to have
waived the right to present evidence.
Here Pedro filed a demurrer to evidence by
moving for dismissal, after Carlos had completed
the presentation of is evidence, on the ground that
under the facts and law Carlos is not entitled to
576

J9JC9B0M

Rule 33
Demurrer To Evidence

relief. Hence when the order of dismissal was
reversed on appeal, Pedro is deemed to have
waived his right to present evidence and thus the
Regional Trial Court should not grant Pedros'
motion to present evidence.

Q.

Distinguish the effects of the filing of a
demurrer to evidence in a criminal case and its
filing in a civil case. (07 Bar Q5a).

A.

In a criminal case the filing of a demurrer to
evidence results in the waiver of the accused to
adduce evidence if the filing was without leave and
the same is denied, while in a civil case the filing of
a demurrer to evidence does not need leave of
court and its denial will not result in a waiver of the
defendant to present evidence.
In a criminal case the grant of the demurrer to
evidence results in the acquittal of the accused and
hence the dismissal cannot be appealed, while in a
civil case, the grant of the demurrer to evidence may
be appealed and if on appeal the dismissal of the case
is reversed by the appellate court, the defendant is
deemed to have waived the presentationof evidence.

Q.

Plaintiff finance company filed case against
defendant. The defendant filed a demurrer to
evidence. The trial court granted the demurrer
and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the
Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's order
granting the demurrer. The Court of Appeals
ordered the remand of the case to the trial court
for further proceedings. Was the Court of
Appeal's remand order proper?

A.

No. The Supreme Court held that the remand was
improper since the Court of Appeals had enough
577

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

REMEDIALLAW

evidence on record to decide the case. To remand
the case for the defendant to present evidence
before the court a quo would be to circumvent the
provisions of S1 R33 which provide that the
defendant is deemed to have waived the right to
present evidence. (Radiowealth Finance Company
v. Del Rosario, 6 July 2000).
Q.

In a demurrer to evidence, may the movant
present evidence in support of his motion?

A.

No. What should be resolved in a motion to dismiss
based on a demurrer to evidence is whether the
plaintiff is entitled to the relief based on the facts
and the law. The "facts" referred to should include
all the means sanctioned by the Rules of Court in
ascertaining matters in judicial proceedings. These
include judicial admissions, matters of judicial
notice, stipulations made during the pre-trial and
trial, admissions, and presumptions, the only
exclusion being the defendant's evidence. ( Glv1A
Network Inc. v. Central CATV, Inc., 18 July 2014).

Q.

May a demurrer to evidence be filed after the
court has rendered judgment?

A.

No. Being considered a motion to dismiss, a
demurrer to evidence must clearly be filed before the
court renders its judgment. (Gonzales v. Bugaay,
22 February 2012). In this case, the defendant's
motion for new trial was granted. However instead
of presenting new evidence, the defendant filed a
demurrer to evidence. The SC held that the
defendant is deemed to have abandoned his
motion for new trial and thus the judgment of the
trial court stands.

RULE 34. JUDGMENT ON
THE PLEADINGS
Q.

What is a judgment on the pleadings?

A.

It is a judgment based solely on the relief prayed
for in the complaint without plaintiff adducing
any evidence.

Q.

When may the court render judgment on the
pleadings?

A.

The court may motu proprio or on motion render
judgment on the pleadings if it is apparent that the
answer fails to tender an issue, or otherwise admits
the material allegations of the adverse party's
pleadings. The motion shall be subject to the
provisions of R 15. (S2 R34, 2020 Rules of Civil
Procedure). Note that unlike in the 1997 Rules, the
court may motu proprio render judgment on
the pleadings.
The court may motu proprio include in the pretrial order that the case be submitted for judgment
on the pleadings. (S10 R18, 2020 Rules of Civil
Procedure).

Q.

Capitol Motors filed a complaint for sum of
money against Yabut. A copy of the promissory
note upon which the action was based was
attached to the complaint. The complaint alleges
that Yabut defaulted in the payment of the note.
Yabut filed an answer in which he admits the
paragraph regarding his personal circumstances
but "specifically denies" the rest of the
allegations for want of knowledge or information
sufficient to form a belief as to the truth thereof.

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Capitol Motors moved for a judgment on the
pleadings in its favor. Should the trial court
grant the motion?

A.

Yes. The third mode of specific denial may not be
availed of when the fact as to which want of
knowledge or information is claimed is so plainly
and necessarily within the defendant's knowledge
that his averment of ignorance must be palpably
untrue. The defendant must aver positively or state
how it is that he is ignorant of the fact alleged.
Since there is an implied admission of the material
averments of the complaint, a judgment on the
pleadings may be rendered. (Capitol Motors v.
Yabut, 32 SCRA 1).

Q.

In a complaint for recovery of real property, the
plaintiff averred, among others, that he is the
owner of the said property by virtue of a deed of
sale executed by the defendant in his favor.
Copy of the deed of sale was appended to the
complaint as Annex "A" thereof.
In his unverified answer, the defendant
denied the allegation concerning the sale of the
property in question, as well as the appended
deed of sale, for lack of knowledge or
information sufficient to form a belief as to the
truth thereof. Is it proper for the court to render
judgment without trial? Explain. (05 Bar QS).

A.

Yes, it is proper for the court to render judgment
without trial.
Under the Rules of Civil Procedure, a
judgment on the pleadings without trial may be
rendered by the trial court if the defendant's answer
admits the material allegations of the complaint.

580

Rule 34
Judgment On The Pleadings

Here the defendant's answer admitted the
material allegations of the complaint since the same
were not specifically denied. Defendant's denial for
lack of knowledge or information did not amount to a
specific denial whether or not he executed the deed
of sale was a matter which was plainly within
his knowledge. Furthermore, defendant impliedly
admitted the genuineness and due execution of the
deed of sale, an actionable document, when he
failed to specifically deny it under oath.
Hence a judgment on the pleadings without,\
trial may be rendered by the court in favor of
the plaintiff.

Q.

In 2000 Comglasco Corporation entered into a
five-year lease contract with Santos Car Check
Center. One year into the lease, Comglasco
sent a pretermination notice to Santos Car.
Santos Car filed a case for breach of contract
and damages against Comglasco. In its answer,
Comglasco raised the following defenses (a)
rebus sic stantibus under Article 1267 of the
Civil Code, invoking financial difficulties as a
result of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, and
(b) legal or physical impossibility to perform
the prestation under Article 1266 of the Civil
Code. Article 1267 provides that "[w]hen the
service has become so difficult as to be
manifestly beyond the contemplation of the
parties, the obligor may also be released
therefrom, in whole or in part." Article 1266
states that "[t]he debtor in obligations to do
shall also be released when the prestation
becomes legally or physically impossible
without the fault of the obligor." Santos Car
581

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

filed a motion to render judgment on the
pleadings. May the court grant the motion?

A.

Yes. Comglasco's defenses of rebus sic stantibus
and legal or physical impossibility failed to tender
an issue. An obligation to pay rentals is not the
"service" contemplated of in Article 1267 nor is it a
prestation "to do" envisaged in Article 1266. Hence
such defenses are sham defenses which failed to
tender an issue and thus a judgment on the
pleadings was proper. (Comglasco Corp. v. Santos
Car Check Center, 25 March 2015).

Q.

What are the instances wherein a judgment on
the pleadings is not allowed?

A.

In actions for declaration of nullity or annulment of
marriage or for legal separation. (S1 R34; S3[e] R9).

Q.

D promised to sell a parcel of land to P for P1
million and P accepted D's promise. Later on D
advised P that he was no longer interested in
selling the land to P. P filed a complaint for
specific performance against D to compel the
latter to sell the land. D filed an answer in which
he admits that he promised to sell the land to P
and that P had accepted his promise but alleges
that the promise was not supported by any
consideration. P and D jointly moved for a
judgment on the pleadings. The trial court
rendered judgment dismissing the complaint
stating that the accepted unilateral promise to sell
is not binding upon the promissor since it was
not supported by any distinct consideration. On
appeal may P contend that the trial court erred in
finding that there was no distinct consideration
since cause is presumed in a contract?

582

Rule 34
Judgment On The Pleadings

A.

No. One who prays for judgment on the pleadings
without offering proof as to the truth of his own
allegations, and without giving the opposing party ·
an opportunity to introduce evidence, impliedly
admits the truth of all the material and relevant
allegations of the opposing party, and to rest his
motion for judgment on those allegations taken
together with such of his own as are admitted in the
pleadings. (See Sanchez v. Rigas, 45 SCRA 368).

Q.

May the action of the court on a motion for
judgment on the pleadings be the subject of an
appeal or petition for certiorari, prohibition, or
mandamus?

A.

No. Any action of the court on a motion for
judgment on the pleadings shall not be subject of
an appeal or petition for certiorari, prohibition
or mandamus. (S2 R34, 2020 Rules of Civil
103
Procedure) .

103
The second paragraph of S2 R34 should be read as referring only to the
order of the court denying the motion for judgment on the pleadings or the order
of the court submitting the case for judgment on the pleadings (see S10 R18),
not to the judgment on the pleadings itself which is appealable under S 1 R41.

J9JC9B0M

RULE 35. SUMMARY JUDGMENTS
Q.

What is a summary judgment?

A.

A judgment rendered by a court without a full-blown
trial, if the court finds that, except as to the amount
of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and the plaintiff or defendant is entitled
to a judgment as a matter of law. The judgment
need not be on the entire case but only on specified
factual issues, with the court proceeding to
try the other factual issues. This is known as a
partial summary judgment. (THOMAS MAUET,
FUNDAMENTALS OF PRETRIAL TECHNIQUES
262 [1988]).
Even if there is a legal question remaining but
there is no material factual issue, a summary
judgment may be rendered.

Q.

When is there no genuine issue as to any
material fact?

A.

There is no genuine issue on any material fact
when there is no factual issue which will require a
full-dress evidentiary hearing involving presentation
of witnesses for regular examination. The absence
of a genuine material factual issue may be
established by affidavits, depositions, or admissions.
(ANTONIO
R.
BAUTISTA,
BASIC
CIVIL
PROCEDURE 73-74 [2005 ed.]).

Q.

In what actions is summary judgment proper?

A.

In all actions where a claim or cause of action is
pleaded by or against a party. Note that in the
special civil action for declaratory relief, a summary
584

Rule 35
Summary Judgments

judgment may also be rendered although technically
speaking there is no claim or cause of action
therein. (S1 & 2, R35). Summary judgment is
however not proper in actions for declaration of
nullity or annulment of marriage or legal separation.
(Roque v. Encarnacion, 95 Phil. 643).
It has been written that a summary judgment is
proper only in actions to recover a debt, or for a
liquidated sum of money, or for declaratory relief. (1
FLORENZ D. REGALADO, REMEDIAL LAW
rd
COMPENDIUM 357 [ih rev. ed., 3 printing, 1999]).
It is submitted that there is no such limitation and that
a summary judgment is proper in all actions in which
a claim is asserted by or against a party. Hence a
summary judgment is proper in personal injury cases.
(THOMAS
MAUET,
FUNDAMENTALS
OF
PRETRIAL TECHNIQUES 262 [1988]).
Q.

When may a claimant
judgment?

A.

A party seeking to recover upon a claim,
counterclaim, or cross-claim or to obtain a
declaratory relief may, at any time after the
pleading in answer thereto has been served, move
with supporting affidavits, depositions, or admissions
for a summary judgment in his favor upon all or any
part thereof. (S1 R35).

Q.

Republic filed a forfeiture case against the heirs
of Ferdinand Marcos. After pre-trial, the
Republic filed a motion for summary judgment.
The Respondents argue that, by agreeing to
proceed to trial during the pre-trial conference,
petitioner waived its right to summary judgment.
Is the argument of the Respondents correct?
585

J9JC9B0M

move for summary

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

No. This argument must fail in the light of the New
York Supreme Court ruling which we apply by
analogy to this case. In Ecker v. Muzysh, 19 NYS2d
250 (1940), the defendant opposed the motion for
summary judgment on a ground similar to that
raised by the Marcoses, that is, "that plaintiff had
waived her right to summary judgment" by her act
of proceeding to trial. If, as correctly ruled by the
New York court, plaintiff was allowed to move for
summary judgment even after trial and submission
of the case for resolution, more so should we permit
it in the present case where petitioner moved for
summary judgment before trial.
Therefore, the phrase "anytime after the
pleading in answer thereto has been served" in
Section 1, Rule 35 of our Rules of Civil Procedure
means "at any stage of the litigation." Whenever it
becomes evident at any stage of the litigation that
no triable issue exists, or that the defenses raised
by the defendant(s) are sham or frivolous, plaintiff
may move for summary judgment. A contrary
interpretation would go against the very objective of
the Rule on Summary Judgment which is to "weed
out sham claims or defenses thereby avoiding the
expense and loss of time involved in a trial."
(Republic v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 152154, 15
July 2003, e.b.).

Q.

Give an example where a claimant may move
for a summary judgment.

A.
1) Plaintiff files a tort case against defendant arising
from a vehicular accident. Defendant files an
answer admitting negligence but averring that the

586

Rule 35
Summary Judgments

damages claimed are exorbitant and unsupported
by evidence. Plaintiff may move for a summary
judgment in his favor on the issue of defendant's
negligence in which case the court will proceed to
try only the issue regarding the amount of
damages recoverable.
2)

Plaintiff files an action to collect on a
promissory note. Defendant files an answer to
which he attaches a receipt showing payment.
Plaintiff may move for a summary judgment by
attaching a document signed by the parties
showing that the payment in the receipt was for
another loan which is not subject of
the complaint.

Q.

May a defendant move for a summary judgment
in his favor? If so, when?

A.

Yes. A party against whom a claim, counterclaim,
or cross-claim is asserted or a declaratory relief is
sought may, at any time, move with supporting
affidavits, depositions or admissions for a summary
judgment in his favor as to all or any part thereof.
(S2 R35).

Q.

Describe the proceedings
summary judgment.

A.

The motion shall cite the supporting affidavits,
depositions or admissions, and the specific law
relied upon. The adverse party may file a comment
and serve opposing affidavits, depositions, or
admissions within a non-extendible period of five
days from receipt of the motion. Unless the court
orders the conduct of a hearing, judgment sought
shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings,
supporting affidavits, depositions and admissions on

damages, there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to
judgment as a matter of law. (S3 R35, as amended
in the 2020 Rules of Civil Procedure).
Q.

Plaintiff sues defendant for collection of a
promissory note in the amount of ft700,000.
Defendant files his answer setting forth the
affirmative defense of payment. Defendant has
a cancelled check in the amount of P700,000
and a written receipt in full signed by the
plaintiff. If you were the lawyer for the
defendant, what procedural device would you
employ in behalf of the defendant in order to
obtain an expeditions result in his favor?

A.

The procedural device I would employ in behalf of
the defendant is to file a motion for summary
judgment. I would support the motion with the
defendant's affidavit, attaching thereto the cancelled
check and receipt. A full-blown trial would be
avoided by the defendant since it is clear that the
debt had been paid and that the cross-examination
104
of the defendant would be futile.

Q.

Plaintiff sued defendant for collection of P1

Plaintiff filed a motion for judgment on the

589
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Defendant filed an opposition claiming his
answer tendered an issue.
Plaintiff's motion for judgment on the
pleadings was denied. Defendant filed a motion
for summary judgment on the ground that there
are no longer any triable genuine issues of facts.
Should the court grant defendant's motion for
summary judgment? (15 Bar Q7b ed).

A.

Yes, the court should grant Defendant's motion for
summary judgment.
Under S2 R35, a defendant may at any time,
move with supporting admissions for a summary
judgment in his favor.
Here the Plaintiff had impliedly admitted
the genuineness and due execution of the
acknowledgment receipt, which was the basis of
Defendant's defense, by failing to specifically deny
it under oath. Hence Plaintiff's claim is groundless
and the Defendant is entitled to a summary
judgment in his favor.

Q.

Distinguish a judgment on the pleadings from a
summary judgment.

A.

The distinctions between a judgment on the
pleadings and a summary judgment are as follows:
1) Judgment on the pleadings is proper if it
appears that there is no genuine issue between
the parties, while a summary judgment is
proper even if there is a remaining issue as to
the amount of damages.
2)

Judgment on the pleadings is based
exclusively upon the pleadings without the

590
J9JC9B0M

Rule 35
Summary Judgments

presentation of any evidence, while a summary
judgment is based not only on the pleadings
but also upon supporting affidavits, depositions,
and admissions showing that, except as to the
amount of damages, there is no genuine issue.
A judgment on the pleadings is a judgment on the
facts as pleaded, while a summary judgment is a
judgment on the facts as proven summarily by
affidavits, depositions or admissions. 2 MANUEL
V. MORAN, COMMENTS ON THE RULES OF
COURT 170 (1979 ed.).
3)

Judgment on the pleadings may be prayed for
only by a plaintiff or claimant, while a summary
judgment may be prayed for by a defending
party. (S2 R35).

Q.

Plaintiff filed with the RTC an action to collect
P1 million on a promissory note against the
Defendant. Defendant filed an answer in which
he raised the affirmative defense of payment.
Defendant attached to his answer a copy of a
receipt purportedly signed by the Plaintiff,
acknowledging payment of the P1 million
promissory note. Plaintiff did not file a reply to
the answer. If you were the lawyer for the
defendant, what procedural device would you
use in order to obtain an expeditious, favorable
result for your client?

A.

I would file a motion for summary judgment
dismissing the complaint. A motion for summary
judgment is available where there is no genuine
material factual issue and defendant is entitled to a
judgment in his favor.

591
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Here the plaintiff is deemed to have admitted
the genuineness and due execution of the receipt,
an actionable document, when he failed to file a
reply specifically denying under oath its genuineness
and due execution. Thus there is no genuine
material factual issue as to payment.
Q.

May a party introduce exhibits in support of the
motion for summary judgment?

A.

Yes. While the rules expressly mention only
"supporting affidavits, depositions or admissions,"
there is no bar to supporting the motion with
documents or exhibits. In practice, such exhibits
are attached to the supporting affidavit. (See
THOMAS MAUET, FUNDAMENTALS OF PRETRIAL
TECHNIQUES 262 [1988]; 1 FLORENZ D.
REGALADO, REMEDIAL LAW COMPENDIUM
360-61 [ih rev. ed., 3rd printing, 1999]). Thus S5
R35 provides that "[c]ertified true copies of all
papers or parts thereof referred to in the
[supporting] affidavit shall be attached thereto or
served therewith."

Q.

What is a partial summary judgment?

A.

A partial summary judgment is a judgment which is
rendered if in a motion for summary judgment,
judgment is not rendered upon the whole case or for
all the reliefs sought and a trial is necessary. In
such a case, the court may, by examining the
pleadings and the evidence before it and by
interrogating counsel, ascertain what material facts
exist without substantial controversy, including the
extent to which the amount of damages or other
relief is not in controversy, and directing such further
proceedings in the action as are just. The facts so
592

Rule 35
Summary Judgments

ascertained shall be deemed established, and the
trial shall be conducted on the controverted facts
accordingly. (S4 R35).
Q.

May a partial summary judgment be appealed
separately from the judgment in the entire case?

A.

No. A partial summary judgment is an interlocutory
order that was never meant to be treated
separately from the main case. It is merely a pretrial adjudication that certain issues in the case
shall be deemed established for the trial of the
case. Hence the failure to appeal separately from a
partial summary judgment or to challenge it by a
special civil action for certiorari does not make the
same final and executory. (Philippine Business
Bank v. Chua, 15 November 2010, Brion, J.).

Q.

May a partial summary judgment be executed if
the entire case has not yet been resolved?

A.

No. What S4 R35 contemplates is that an appeal
from a partial summary judgment shall be taken
together with the judgment that the trial court may
render in the entire case after trial has been
conducted on the controverted facts. Inasmuch as a
partial summary judgment does not finally dispose of
the action, execution thereof shall not issue,
conformably with Section 1 of Rule 39 of the Rules of
Court. (Province of Pangasinan v. Court of Appeals,
G.R. No. 104266, 31 March 1993; Guevarra v. Court
of Appeals, 124 SCRA 297 [1983]).

Q.

Plaintiff filed a complaint for collection of the
principal amount of P1,000,000 and accrued
interest of P350,000 against Defendant.
Defendant filed his answer. Plaintiff moved for
summary judgment contending that there was
593

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

no genuine material factual issue. The court
rendered summary judgment for the principal
amount of P1,000,000 but ordered that trial
proceed regarding the accrued interest of
P350,000 since there was a genuine material
factual issue therein. Subsequently Plaintiff
filed a motion for execution of the judgment for
P1 ,000,000 contending that it became final and
executory because of the Defendant's failure to
appeal therefrom. May the court grant the
motion for execution?
A.

No. The summary judgment rendered by the court
is a partial summary judgment since it was
rendered only with respect to the relief respecting
the principal of P1 ,000,000 but not respect to the
relief regarding the interest which was still the
subject of trial. The Supreme Court has held that a
partial summary judgment, being an interlocutory
order, may not be appealed. Being merely
interlocutory, the partial summary judgment may
not be enforced while the case is still pending.

Q.

May the action of the court on a motion for
summary judgment be the subject of an appeal or
petition for certiorari, prohibition, or mandamus?

A.

No. Any action of the court on a motion for summary
judgment shall not be subject of an appeal or petition
for certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. (S2 R34,
2020 Rules of Civil Procedure). 105

10
5The second paragraph of 82 R34 should be read as referring only to the

certification against forum shopping in behalf of
Kemper Insurance, had not been authorized by
a board resolution to file the complaint in behalf
of Kemper and to sign the verification and CFS.
May the judgment of the RTC be set aside?

A.

Yes. The failure of Atty. Lat to show that he was•'

meant that the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction over

acquire jurisdiction over the case. Lack of
jurisdiction over the case may be raised at any
stage of the case. (Cosco Phils. Shipping v.

Q.

What are the requirements for the rendition of a
judgment or final order?

A.

A judgment or final order determining the merits of
the case shall be in writing personally and directly
prepared by the judge, stating clearly the facts and
the law on which it is based, signed by him, and
filed with the clerk of court.

Q.

What is a sin perjuicio judgment?

A.

It is a judgment without a statement of the facts in
support of its conclusions. Such a judgment is void
for it violates Section 14, Article VIII of the
Constitution. Thus the party adversely affected would
be unable to file a motion for reconsideration or
appeal the judgment for he has to speculate on the
grounds upon which the judge based his decision.

Q.

A dismissal order tersely read as follows: "For
failure of the Plaintiff, to prosecute, the case is
hereby dismissed." Is the dismissal order valid?

A.

No. The same has the effect of an adjudication on
the merits (S3 R17) and thus should have stated
the facts on which it is based pursuant to S1 R36.
Failure to comply therewith renders the order null
and void. (Shimizu Philippines Contractors v.
Magsalin, 20 June 2012).

Q.

An RTC decision merely narrated the relevant

No the decision is void. Under S1 R36, the

Q.

What is a memorandum decision?

A.

A memorandum decision is one rendered by an
appellate court which adopts by reference the
findings of facts and the conclusions of law set forth
in the decision, order, or resolution appealed from.
(Sec. 40, B.P. Big. 129; S5 R51 ).

Q.

The Decision of the Regional Trial Court of
Makati affirming the decision of the MTC of
Makati City read in full as follows:
MEMORANDUM DECISION
After a careful and thorough perusal,
evaluation and study of the records of this case,
this Court hereby adopts by reference the
findings of fact and conclusions of law contained
in the decision of the Metropolitan Trial Court of
Makati, Metro Manila, Branch 63 and finds that
there is no cogent reason to disturb the same.
WHEREFORE, judgment appealed from is
hereby affirmed in toto.
The decision of the MTC or the findings of
fact and conclusions of law adopted by the RTC
were not attached or annexed to the memorandum
decision. The Defendant assailed the validity of
the RTC judgment on the ground that it does
not comply with Article VIII, Section 14 of the
Constitution which states that "[n]o decision
shall be rendered by any court without

597
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

expressing therein clearly and distinctly the
facts and the law on which it is based." Did the
RTC judgment sufficiently comply with the said
constitutional provision?

A.

No. While memorandum decisions are allowed by
Section 40 of B.P. Big. 129, the memorandum
decision, to be valid, cannot incorporate the
findings of fact and the conclusions of law of the
lower court only by remote reference, which is to
say that the challenged decision is not easily and
immediately available to the person reading the
memorandum decision. For the incorporation
by reference to be allowed, it must provide
for direct access to the facts and the law being
adopted, which must be contained in a
statement attached to the said decision. In other
words, the memorandum decision authorized under
Section 40 of B.P. Big. 129 should actually embody
the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the
lower court in an annex attached to and made an
indispensable part of the decision. (See Francisco
v. Permskul, 12 May 1989, Cruz, J.).

Q.

What is a nunc pro tune judgment or order?

A.

"Nunc pro tune" means "now for then." A nunc pro
tune judgment or order is one rendered to record
some judicial act done at a former time but which
was not carried into the record. It is proper only for
the purpose of placing into the record judicial action
which was actually taken.
For instance the name of the defendant was
already corrected in open court from Juan dela
Cruz to Juan Cruz and approved by the court but
this was not carried into the record. The court in its
judgment ordered Defendant Juan dela Cruz to pay

598

Rule 36
Judgments, Final Orders,
And Entry Thereof

Plaintiff. Upon plaintiff's motion or even on its own
initiative, the court may issue a nunc pro tune order
correcting the defendant's name.
Since the only function of a nunc pro tune
judgment or order is to place into the record judicial
action actually taken, it cannot correct judicial errors,
however flagrant and glaring these may be (Henderson
v. Tan, 87 Phil. 466), nor can it construe what the
judgment means. (Lichauco v. Tan Po, 51 Phil. 862).
Q.

In a judgment for partition, certain properties
subject of the partition were overlooked and not
mentioned in the dispositive portion. What step
may the court take?

A.

The court may render a nunc pro tune judgment
including the overlooked properties in the dispositive
portion. (Magno v. Magno, 17 August 2016, Peralta, J.).

Q.

What is meant by entry of judgments and final
orders?

A.

If no appeal or motion for new trial or
reconsideration is filed within the time provided in
the Rules, the judgment or final order shall forthwith
be entered by the clerk in the book of entries of
judgments. The date of finality of the judgment or
final order shall be deemed to be the date of its
entry. The record shall contain the dispositive part
of the judgment or final order and shall be signed
by the clerk, with a certificate that such judgment or
final order has become final and executory.

Q.

What is the importance of the date of entry?

A.

The date of entry is the starting point of the 6month period for filing a petition for relief (S3 R38),
the 5-year period for filing a motion for execution

599
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

(S6 R39), and the 10-year period for filing an action
for revival of judgment (Art. 1144, Civil Code).
Q.

What is a several judgment?

A.

It is a judgment rendered by a court in an action
against several defendants where the court renders
judgment against one or more of them, leaving the
action to proceed against the others. (S4 R36).

Q.

What is a separate judgment?

A.

It is a judgment rendered by a court in an action wherein
more than one claim for relief is presented and where
the court renders a separate judgment disposing of a
claim or some of them but allowing the action to
proceed against the remaining claims. (S5 R36).

Q.

May a separate judgment be enforced even
while the action is proceeding against the
remaining claims?

A.

Yes. Under S5 R36, in case a separate judgment
is rendered, the court by order may stay its
enforcement until the rendition of the subsequent
judgment or judgments. Since the word used is
"may," the court has the discretion not to stay the
enforcement of the separate judgment. This
distinguishes a separate judgment from a partial
summary judgment which cannot be enforced until
judgment has been rendered in the entire case.

Q.

May an appeal be taken from a separate or
several judgment?

A.

No, unless the court allows the appeal. (S1[f] R41).
The remedy of the aggrieved party is to file the
appropriate special civil action under R65. (S1
R41 ). Where an appeal is allowed, the same shall

600

And Entry Thereof
be taken by filing a notice of appeal and a record
on appeal within 30 days from notice of the order
allowing the appeal. (S3 R41 ).

Q.

Distinguish a partial summary judgment from a
separate judgment. 106

PARTIAL SUMMARY
JUDGMENT
One claim. Judgment for part
thereof or for some of the
reliefs thereof. Judgment is
summary.
Governed by S4 R35.
Interlocutory order.
Cannot be appealed until
after judgment in the entire
case has been rendered.

Cannot be enforced until
rendition of judgment in the
entire case.

SEPARATE JUDGMENT

More than one claim.
Judgment for one claim/s but
action to proceed as to
remaining claims.
Governed by S5 R36.
Judqment or final order.
As a rule not appealable
while the main case is
pending, unless the court
allows an appeal therefrom.
(S1 [f] R41)
May be enforced even prior
to rendition of the subsequent
judgment/s unless stayed by
court. (S5 R36)

Note: A partial summary judgment and a
separate judgment are similar in that both may be
executed after rendition of judgment in the entire or
main case, under the same terms and conditions as
execution of a judgment or final order pending
appeal. (S2[b] R39).
106
In Marcos v. Republic, G.R. No. 189434, 25 April 2012, it was stated
that a partial summary judgment may also be considered as a separate
judgment. This is not altogether precise. As held by the Supreme Court in
Province of Pangasinan v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 104266, 31 March 1993,
the applicable provision where a partial summary judgment has been rendered is
S4 R35 and not S5 R36 which applies to judgments in general.

Q.

Plaintiff filed a complaint for collection on a_road _____
-construction project against the Province of
Pangasinan. Per the plaintiff's contract with the
province, the project involved two phases, Phase 1
and Phase 2, for a total consideration of P5 million
and that upon completion of Phase 1, the plaintiff
would be entitled to a payment of P3 million. The
plaintiff alleged that he had completed Phase 1
and had accomplished 60% of Phase 2 but that the
defendant had decided not to proceed with the
project and to pay the amounts due him. The
plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary
judgment on Phase 1 which was granted by the
trial court. Subsequently the plaintiff filed a motion
for execution of the partial summary judgment
while the trial court was still trying the case with
respect to Phase 2. The trial court granted the
motion for execution stating that since the
Province of Pangasinan had failed to appeal from
the partial summary judgment within 30 days from
notice, the same had become final and executory,
invoking 55 R36. Was it proper for the trial court to
grant the motion for execution?

A.

No. The Supreme Court has held that a partial
summary judgment being interlocutory cannot be
the subject of execution. The Supreme Court also
held that since what was involved was a partial
summary judgment, the applicable provision was
S4 R35 and hence it was error for the trial court to
rely upon S5 R36 which pertains to judgments in
general. (Province of Pangasinan v. Court of
Appeals, 220 SCRA 726 [1993]). 107

107
A partial summary judgment was proper since there was only one claim,
that is, for collection on the road construction project. A separate judgment
under S5 R36 involves two or more claims, with judgment being rendered in one.

Q.

Tan, a stockholder and director of CST Inc. (CST),
filed a derivative suit for the declaration of
unenforceability
of promissory
notes and
mortgage against Philippine Business Bank
(PBB), John, and Felipe before the Makati City
RTC. Tan alleged that CST's real properties had
been fraudulently mortgaged to PBB without the
authority of the board of directors of CST. Tan
alleged that a forged secretary's certificate
purportedly authorizing John to obtain a loan
from PBB and to mortgage CST's properties had
been procured by defendants. John and Felipe
had signed as co-makers on the promissory
notes (PNs) executed by CST in favor of PBB.
PBB filed
an
answer
alleging
the
genuineness of the secretary's certificate and the
enforceability of the PNs and mortgage deeds.
PBB also filed a cross-claim against Felipe
demanding payment of the PNs he had co-signed
with CST. In Felipe's answer to PBB's cross-claim
he denied having authorized John to obtain the
loan from PBB but admitting having signed the
PNs in a sincere effort to persuade John to pay
off the loan and redeem CST's properties.
PBB subsequently filed a Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment based on S1 R35, claiming
that since Felipe already admitted the execution
of the promissory
notes in favor of PBB
amounting to tl75,000,000 insofar as its cross603

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER~REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

claim against him was concerned, there was no
genuine issue on any material fact on the issue
of his liability to PBB. PBB argued that although
Felipe claimed that he signed the promissory
notes merely to persuade John to pay off his
loan to PBB, he was still liable as an
accommodation party under Section 29 of the
Negotiable Instruments Law. The RTC granted
the Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.
Felipe filed a notice of appeal from the
summary judgment against him. PBB countered
with a motion to disallow appeal and a motion
for execution. The RTC, invoking S1(f) R41,
disallowed Felipe's appeal and granted the
motion for execution. The RTC ruled that since
Felipe had failed to avail of certiorari as per the
last sentence of S1 R41, the partial summary
judgment had become final and executory. Did
the RTC act correctly in granting the motion for
execution of the summary judgment?
A.

No, the RTC did not act correctly in granting the
motion for execution of the partial summary
judgment. A partial summary judgment is an
interlocutory order which cannot become final and
executory by the failure to file a certiorari petition to
challenge the judgment. Accordingly, the RTC
grievously erred when it issued the writ of execution
against Felipe. (Philippine Business Bank v. Chua,
15 November 2010, Brion, J.). 108

108

While the judgment rendered against Felipe was a summary judgment, it was
not a parlial summary judgment because it was a judgment on the entire claim,
i.e., PBB's cross-claim against Felipe. Thus the summary judgment was actually
a several judgment which under S5 R36 may be enforced prior to the rendition of
judgment in the main case or in the other claims, unless stayed by the court.
This point was belatedly raised by PBB on appeal but the Supreme Court stated,
inter a/ia, that PBB was estopped from doing so since it had in the court a quo

RULE 37. NEW TRIAL OR
RECONSIDERATION
Q.

When may a party file a motion for new trial or
reconsideration?

A.

Within the period for taking an appeal. (S1 R37).

Q.

What are the grounds of a motion for new trial?
(FAME-N)

A.

a)

Fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence
(1) which ordinary prudence could not have
guarded against and (2) by reason of which
such aggrieved party has probably been
impaired in his rights; or

b)

Newly discovered evidence, which (1) he could
not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered
and produced at the trial, and which (2)
if presented would probably alter the result.
(S1 R37).

Q.

May a motion for new trial be filed with the
Court of Appeals in an appealed case? If so
when and on what ground?

A.

Yes. At any time after the appeal from the lower
court has been perfected and before the Court of
Appeals loses jurisdiction over the case, a party
may file a motion for a new trial on the ground of
newly discovered evidence which could not have
been discovered prior to the trial in the court below

theory on that consideration.

by the exercise of due diligence and which is of
such a character as would probably change the
result. (S1 R53). The court of appeals may receive
evidence in its discretion. (S2 R53).
Q.

May a motion for new trial be filed with the
Supreme Court?

A.

In civil cases a motion for new trial may not be filed
with the Supreme Court as such a remedy is not
provided for in the Rules of Court. The Supreme
Court however may in exceptional cases take
cognizance of factual issues by virtue of its plenary
judicial power. (JOSE FERIA, 1997 RULES OF
CIVIL PROCEDURE 201 [1997]).
In criminal cases, a motion for new trial on the
ground of newly-discovered evidence may be filed
with the Supreme Court. (S1 R125 in relation to
S14 R124). Thus in Custodio v. Sandiganbayan, 8
March 2005, the Supreme Court entertained a
motion for new trial by the accused convicted in the
Aquino-Galman double murder case.

Q.

May a motion for extension of time to file a
motion for new trial or reconsideration be filed?

A.

No motion for extension of time to file a motion for
new trial or reconsideration may be allowed. (S3
R41 ). Motions for extension of time to file a motion
for new trial or reconsideration may be filed only in
connection with cases pending before the Supreme
Court. No such motion may be filed before any
lower court. (Fernandez v. CA, 16 May 2005).

Q.

What is the meaning of "fraud" as a ground for
new trial under S1(a) R37?

606

Rule 37
New Trial Or Reconsideration

A.

The fraud referred to in S1 (a) R37 is extrinsic fraud,
that is, deception or trickery by which the aggrieved
party was prevented from having trial or presenting
his case before the court. It should be distinguished
from intrinsic fraud which involves the presentation
of false or perjured testimony but did not otherwise
prevent the aggrieved party from presenting
his case.

Q.

Give examples of extrinsic fraud.

A.
1) When a party connived with the court
personnel so that notices of trial dates were
sent to the old address of the aggrieved party's
counsel although a notice of change of address
had been filed.
2)

The aggrieved party's lawyer betrays him and
sells out his case to the other side.

3)

The judge is bribed by the adverse party to
render a decision in his favor.

Q.

What is the meaning of accident within the
purview of S1 R37?

A.

Accident is similar to the concept of fortuitous event
in civil law. It is something which ordinary prudence
on the part of party or counsel could not have
guarded against.
If counsel loses his planner but did not exert
diligent efforts to inquire from the court about trial
dates, he cannot complain if he was not able to
attend an important trial setting. On the other hand
if counsel was injured in a vehicular collision and

607
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

was unable to attend crucial trial dates, that would
be a ground for a new trial.
Q.

Give an example of mistake which constitutes a
sufficient ground for a new trial.

A.

If a party, because of a pending compromise
agreement, believed in good faith that it was not
necessary for him to answer, appear at the trial and
put up a defense, there is a mistake which would
constitute a sufficient ground for a new trial.
(Salazar v. Salazar, 8 Phi. 853).

Q.

Is mistake of a party's counsel a ground for a
new trial?

A.

No. The mistake or lack of foresight or skill on the
part of counsel cannot be admitted as reason for
reopening cases. Otherwise there would be no end
to cases so long as a new counsel could be
engaged who could allege and show that prior
counsel had not been sufficiently diligent, or
experienced or learned.

Q.

Distinguish a motion for new trial from a motion
for reopening a trial.

A.
1) A motion for new trial is a remedy specifically
mentioned in the Rules of Court, while a motion
for reopening of trial is not so mentioned, at
least insofar as civil cases are concerned.
2)

A motion for new trial may only be filed after
the judgment had been rendered, while a
motion for reopening may be made before or
after judgment.

608

Rule 37
New Trial Or Reconsideration

3) A motion for new trial is based on specific
grounds set forth in S1 R37, while a motion for
reopening is based on broader grounds, that is,,A
the paramount interests of justice.
Q.

What are the contents of a motion for new trial?
(WAS)

A.

1) The motion shall be in writing.
2)

It should state the grounds therefor.

3) A motion based on the ground of fraud,
accident, mistake, or excusable negligence shall
be supported by an affidavit of merits; while a
motion based on newly discovered evidence
shall be supported by affidavits of the witnesses
by whom such evidence is expected to be given,
or by duly authenticated documents which are
proposed to be introduced in evidence. (S2 R37).
Q.

What is an affidavit of merits?

A.

It is an affidavit which recites: (FEC)
1) The nature and character of the fraud,
accident, mistake, or excusable negligence on
which it is based;
2)

The facts constituting the movant's good and
substantial cause of action or defense, as the
case may be; and

3) The evidence he intends to present if the
motion is granted, which evidence must be
such as to warrant the reasonable belief that
the result of the case would probably be
different, if a new trial were conducted.

1)

From a judgment in cases for legal separation,
annulment, and declaration of nullity of
marriage.

2)

From a judgment in petition for custody of
minor under the SC Rules on Cases Involving
Custody of Minors.

In 1995, Rhomel Cote and respondent Florie
Cote, both Filipinos, were married in Quezon
City. In 2002, Rhomel filed a Petition for Divorce
before the Family Court of the First Circuit of
Hawaii on the ground that their marriage was
irretrievably broken. This was granted in 23
August 2002 by the issuance of a decree of
absolute divorce that stated that either party
(Rhomel or Florie) is permitted to marry from
and after the effective date of the decree.
Seven years later, Florie commenced a
petition for recognition of foreign judgment
granting the divorce before the RTC. Florie also
prayed for the cancellation of her marriage
contract, hence, she also impleaded the Civil
Registry of Quezon City and the NSO. In 2011,
the RTC granted the petition and declared Florie
to be capacitated to remarry after the RTC's
decision attained finality and a decree of
absolute nullity has been issued.

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Petitioner filed a Notice of Appeal on 17
May 2011. However, the RTC, believing that the
petition was covered by A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC or
the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of
Void Marriages and Annulment of Voidable
Marriages, applied Section 20 of said Rule and
denied the appeal because the notice was not
preceded by a motion for reconsideration.
Aggrieved, the petitioner filed a petition for
certiorari with the CA. Was the denial of the
appeal correct?
A.

No. A decree of absolute divorce procured abroad is
different from annulment as defined by our family
laws. A.M, No. 02-11-10-SC covers only void and
voidable marriages that are specifically cited and
enumerated in the Family Code of the Philippines.
Void and voidable marriages contemplate a situation
wherein the basis for the judicial declaration of
absolute nullity or annulment of the marriage exists
before or at the time of the marriage. It treats the
marriage as if it never existed. Divorce, on the other
hand, ends a legally valid marriage and is usually due
to circumstances arising after the marriage.
It was error for the RTC to use as basis for
denial of petitioner's appeai Section 20 of A.M. No.
02-11-10-SC. Since Florie followed the procedure
for cancellation of entry in the civil registry, a
special proceeding governed by Rule 108, an
appeal from the RTC decision should be governed
by S3 R41 and not AM. No. 02-11-10-SC.
(Republic v. Cote, 14 March 2018, Reyes, J.). 109

The SC nevertheiGsS affirmed the CA's decision dismissing petitioner's

Rule 37
New Trial Or Reconsideration

Q.

What is the effect of a motion for new trial or
reconsideration on the period of appeal?

A.

The filing of a timely motion for new trial or
reconsideration shall toll or interrupt the reglementary
period of appeal. Upon receipt of the order denying
the motion for new trial or reconsideration, the
movant has a fresh 48-hour, 5-working day, 15-day
or 30-day period to appeal, as the case may be.

Q.

What is a pro forma motion for new trial or
reconsideration? What is the result if such a
motion is filed?

A.

A pro forma motion for new trial or reconsideration
is one which does not comply with the requirements
of S2 R37 and S2-5, S7 R15. Such a motion would
be a mere scrap of paper and would have no
legal effect.
This includes a motion for new trial based on
fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence
which is not supported by an affidavit of merits; or
motions without the requisite proof of service and
notice of hearing. The result is that the pro forma
motion does not toll the reglementary period of
appeal and thus the challenged judgment would
become final.

Q.

May a second motion for new trial be filed? If so
when may it be filed?

A.

Generally no. The exception would be when the
second motion for new trial is based on a ground
not existing nor available when the first motion for

have been treated as one for mandamus since the duty to allow a timely and

RULE 38. PETITION FOR RELIEF
Q.

When may a party file a petition for relief from a
judgment, final order or other proceeding?

A.

When a judgment or final order is entered, or any
other proceeding is thereafter taken against a party
in any court through fraud, accident, mistake, or
excusable negligence, he may file a verified petition
in such court and in the same case praying that
the judgment, order or proceeding be set aside.
(S1 R38).

Q.

Is Rule 38 applicable to criminal cases?

A.

Yes. See for instance Basco v. Court of Appeals,
337 SCRA 472 (2000) where the Supreme Court
allowed the filing of a petition for relief from a
judgment of conviction in a criminal case.

Q.

May a party file a petition for relief from a denial
of appeal?

A.

Yes, where the party by fraud, accident, mistake, or
excusable negligence, has been prevented from
taking an appeal. He may file a verified petition for
relief in such court and in the same case praying
that the appeal be given due course.
For instance after a judgment had been
rendered against the defendant, the court sent the
decision to the defendant's counsel who had just
been struck with a serious illness. Because of this
the counsel was unable to file a notice of appeal on
time. The defendant may file a petition for relief
asking that his belatedly filed notice of appeal be
given due course.
615

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

Within what time must the petition for relief
be filed?

A.

It must be filed within 60 days after the petitioner
learns of the judgment, final order, or other
proceeding to be set aside and not more than §
months after such judgment or final order was
entered, or such proceeding was taken. Both
periods must be complied with.

Q.

Is the 60-day period reckoned from the time the
petitioner learns of the judgment or final order
or from the time the petitioner learns of the
finality of the judgment or final order?

A.

As expressly provided under the Rules of Court, the
60-day period under S3 R38 should be reckoned
from the time the aggrieved party has knowledge of
the judgment or order sought to be set aside. In
other words, for purposes of the 60-day period
under R38; knowledge of the finality of the judgment
or order is irrelevant. (Lasam v. Philippine National
Bank, 5 December 2018, Reyes, J.).

Q.

Does a petition for relief under R38 require a
certification against forum shopping?

A.

Yes since a petition for relief is a new petition
wherein a party seeks relief based on grounds
different from those in the original case, that is,
fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence.
(Norris v. Parente/a, 27 February 2003).

Q.

The executor filed a petition for the probate of X's

in a newspaper of general circulation. At the
hearing the will was admitted to probate. Seven

Rule 38
Petition For Relief

months after the admission of the will to probate,
the daughter of X filed a petition for relief under
R38 to set aside the order of allowance. Was the
petition timely filed?

A.

No. Publication of the notice of hearing is
constructive notice which is sufficient to constitute
due process of law. (In re Estate of Johnson, -39 ·
Phil. 156)

Q.

P filed a case against D. D filed an answer. P
bribed the court staff to send a fake notice of
dismissal to D. D thus no longer appeared in the
case. The court proceeded to render a judgment
in favor of P which became final and executory.
D learned of the judgment only after 1 year from
its entry. Does D still have a remedy?

A.

Yes D can still file an action to annul the judgment
under R47 on the ground of extrinsic fraud. He
should file the action within 4 years from his
discovery of the fraud. D may still avail of R47 since
the remedy of new trial or petition for relief was no
longer available through no fault of his. (S1&2 R47).

Q.

What are the formal requirements of the petition?

A.
1) The petition must be verified.
2)

It must be accompanied by a certificate against
forum shopping, since it is an initiatory pleading

REMEDIAL LAW

the petitioner's good and substantial cause of
action or defense, as the case may be. (S3 R38).
Q.

What is the nature of a petition for relief under
S1 R38?

A.

It is similar to a motion for new trial on the ground of
fraud, accident, mistake, or excusable negligence,
the difference being that the motion for new trial
under R37 is filed before the judgment becomes
final, while a petition for relief under S1 R38
presupposes a final judgment or order.

Q.

Is a petition for relief under Rule 38 available
against a judgment of the Court of Appeals?

A.

No. Petition for relief under R38 is not available
against a judgment of the Court of Appeals. "Any
court" in S1 and 2 R38 does not include the Court
of Appeals but refers only to the trial courts. ( Sps.
Mesina v. Meer, 2 July 2001 ).

Q.

Within what time should a petition for relief be
answered?

A.

Within 15 days from receipt of the court order
requiring the adverse parties to answer the petition.
The court issues the order if it finds that the petition
is sufficient in form and substance to justify relief.
The order shall be served in such manner as the
court may direct, together with copies of the petition
and the accompanying affidavits. (S4 R38).

Q.

What proceedings are taken by the court after
the answer is filed?

A.

After the filing of the answer or the expiration of the
period therefor, the court shall hear the petition
and if after such hearing, if finds that the allegations
618

J9JC9B0M

Rule 38
Petition For Relief

therein are not true, the petition shall be dismissed.
But if the court finds such allegations to be true, it
shall set aside the judgment or final order or other
proceeding complained of upon such terms as may
be just. Thereafter the case shall stand as if such
judgment, final order or other proceeding had never
been rendered, issued or taken. The court shall
then proceed to hear and determine the case as if a
timely motion for a new trial or reconsideration had
been granted by it. (S6 R38).
Where the denial fo an appeal is set aside, the
lower court shall be required to give due course to
the appeal and to elevate the record of the
appealed case as if a timely and proper appeal had
been made. (S7 R38).
Q.

P files an action with the Regional Trial Court of
Las Pinas City, Branch 170, to recover a parcel of
land co-owned by D. P however did not implead
in his complaint E and F, the co-owners of the
land. The RTC rendered a judgment in favor of P
ordering the reconveyance of the land to P. No
appeal having been filed the judgment became
final and executory on 10 January 2004 and was
entered in the book of entries of judgment on the
same day. E and F learned of the judgment on 10
March 2004 and on 15 March 2004 they filed a
petition for relief from the judgment with Branch
170 of the Las Pinas RTC. P filed an answer
seeking the dismissal of the petition for relief. If
you were the judge, would you dismiss the
petition for relief?

A.

Yes. The petition for relief cannot be availed of by E
and F since they were not parties to the RTC case.

619

(S1 R38). E and F should avail of the remedy of
annulment of judgment under R47.

Q.

In a petition for relief under R38, it was argued
by petitioners that their counsel's failure to file
the appeal was because of his advanced age of
80 and that this constituted mistake and
excusable negligence. May the counsel's advance
age be so considered?

A.

No. This argument stereotypes and demeans senior
citizens. It assumes that a person with advanced
age is prone to incompetence. This cannot be
countenanced. (Madarang v. Sps. Morales, 9
June 2014).

620

RULE 39. EXECUTION, SATISFACTION,
& EFFECT OF JUDGMENTS
Q.

What is meant by execution?

A.

Execution is the remedy provided by law for the
enforcement of a judgment. (21 Am Jur. 18). It also
refers to the process of enforcing the judgment.

Q.

Are there final judgments or orders to which the
concept of execution is not applicable?

A

Yes. If the judgment does not order the doing of
something or the payment of money, there is nothing
in the judgment which needs to be enforced or
executed. For instance a judgment dismissing a case
without pronouncement as to damages and costs.
Also a judgment in an injunction case which orders
the defendant not to do an act or a judgment
declaring a contract null and void. In such cases, if
the appeal period has lapsed, the judgment becomes
"final and unappealable," not "final and executory.''
In land registration proceedings, after the
ownership has been proved and confirmed by
judicial declaration, no further proceeding to enforce
said ownership is necessary, except when the
adverse or losing party had been in possession of
the land and the winning party desires to oust him.
(Ting v. Heirs of Lirio, G.R. 168913, 14 March 2007).

Q.

Petitioners filed with the CFI of Cebu an action
for recovery of land against the Private
Respondents. The Private Respondents filed an
answer raising the defense of their ownership.
The CFI decided in favor of the Private
Respondents but on appeal the Court of Appeals
621

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

reversed and decided in favor of the Petitioners
declaring them as the owners of the land and
ordering the Private Respondents to vacate the
premises. In the body of its decision, the Court
of Appeals stated that there was no fraud or bad
faith on the part of the Private Respondents.
The Court of Appeal's judgment became final
and executory. The Petitioners moved for the
execution of the judgment before the CFI. This
was opposed by the Private Respondents on the
ground that a hearing supplementary to
execution should be conducted to allow them to
present evidence to prove that they are builders
in good faith and to prove the value of the
improvements. Should the CFI grant the opposition
of the Private Respondents?
A.

No. Once a decision has become final and executory,
the only jurisdiction left with the court is to order its
execution. To allow the supplemental hearing would
be to amend or alter a final and executory judgment.
(Baclayon v. Court of Appeals, supra).

Q.

Are orders of execution appealable?

A

No. (S1 R141)

Q.

What if the order of execution varies the terms of
the judgment or gives an improper interpretation
of the judgment? May the order be appealed?

A.

No. The prior rulings that such orders of execution
may be appealed are superseded by S 1 R 141.
The remedy of the aggrieved party is to file a
special civil action of certiorari under Rule 65.

Q.

When does execution issue as a matter of right?

A.

Execution shall issue as a matter of right:
622

J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

1) On motion, upon a judgment or order that
disposes of the action or proceeding upon the
expiration of the period to appeal therefrom if
no appeal has been duly perfected.
2)

If the appeal has been duly perfected and
finally resolved, the execution may forthwith be
applied for in the court of origin, on motion of
the judgment obligee, submitting therewith
certified true copies of the judgment or
judgments or final order or orders sought to be
enforced and of the entry thereof, with notice to
the adverse party. The appellate court may, on
motion in the same case, when the interest of
justice so requires, direct the court of origin to
issue the writ of execution. (S1 R39).

Q.

When execution is a matter of right, may
the court of origin issue the writ of execution
motu proprio?

A.

No. Pursuant to S1 R39, a writ of execution shall
issue only after motion.

Q.

When execution is a matter of right, is notice to
the adverse party required?

A.

We have to distinguish. Under the first paragraph of
S1 R39, where no appeal was made during the
reglementary period, notice to the adverse party is
not required. However under the second paragraph,
notice to the adverse party is required since the
same is provided for in the second paragraph, unlike
in the first. (Anama v. Philippine Savings Bank, 25
110
January 2012).
11

°This ruling has been modified by the 2020 Rules which states that all
motions shall be served so as to ensure their receipt by the other party. Hence
even in the first paragraph of S1 R39, notice to the adverse party is required.

623
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

When execution is a matter of right, should the
motion for the issuance of a writ of execution
be set for hearing?

A.

No, because such a motion is a non-litigious motion.
The court shall resolve the motion within five days
from receipt thereof. (S4 R15, 2020 Rules).

Q.

Distinguish between finality of judgment for
purposes of appeal and finality of judgment for
purposes of execution.

A.

Finality of judgment for purposes of appeal refers to
a judgment which completely disposes of a case. A
final judgment in this sense is distinguished from an
interlocutory order which still leaves something
more to be done by the court and is not appealable.
Finality of judgment for purposes of execution
refers to a judgment where the period to appeal
therefrom has expired without any appeal being
duly perfected or where an appeal has been duly
perfected but finally resolved. The judgment in this
sense is more precisely referred to as "final and
executory" in order to avoid confusion with final
judgment in the first sense.

Q.

What is the remedy if a motion for execution is
denied?

A.

The remedy is mandamus. The issuance of a writ of
execution is a ministerial duty of the court under S1
R39, compellable by a writ of mandamus. (Greater
Metropolitan Manila Solid Waste Management
Committee v. Jancom Environmental Corporation,
G.R. No. 163663, 30 June 2006, citing cases).
Jancom and other cases cited therein may be
deemed to have superseded Soccoro v. Ortiz, G.R.

Q.

P files a suit to collect PS00,000 from D with the
Regional Trial Court. The RTC rendered judgment
in favor of D. P appeals to the Court of Appeals
which reversed the RTC and rendered judgment in
favor of P. P filed a motion for a writ of execution
with the RTC which denied the same without
justifiable cause. P's motion for reconsideration
was denied. What is the remedy of P?

A.

P may file a motion with the Court of Appeals to
direct the RTC to issue the writ of execution. (S1
R39). Mandamus is not proper since there is a
plain, adequate, and speedy remedy under S1 R39.
(JOSE
FERIA,
1997 RULES OF
CIVIL
PROCEDURE 115 [1997]).

Q.

What are instances wherein the court may
refuse to enforce a final and executory
judgment?

A.
1) When subsequent facts occur which render
execution impossible, unjust, or inequitable.
2) Where the judgment has been novated by the
parties.
3) Where the judgment obligor had already
complied with the judgment.
4)

Where a temporary restraining order or
preliminary injunction is issued by the proper

R47, or petition for certiorari, prohibition, and

Q.

A quo warranto judgment directing the
reinstatement of respondent as regional director
of the National Commission on Indigenous
Peoples became final and executory. However it
was later discovered that the respondent had
falsified his bachelor's degree and thus had
become ineligible for the position of regional
director. May the judgment still be executed?

A.

No. The general rule is that the execution of a
court's judgment becomes a matter of right upon
the expiration of the period to appeal and no appeal
was duly perfected. Generally, therefore, courts
may no longer review or modify a final and
executory judgment. This is otherwise referred to as
the principle of immutability of judgments, which
dictates that once a decision becomes final, the
enforcement or execution of the judgment becomes
a purely ministerial act. An exception to the rule is
whenever circumstances transpire after the finality
of the judgments rendering execution unjust
and inequitable.
Here there was a supervening circumstance,
that is, the discovery that the respondent had
falsified his bachelor's degree and thus had
become ineligible for the contested position. To still
order the execution of the judgment would be
clearly unjust and inequitable. (Arroyo v. CA, 10
April 2019, Reyes, J.).

Q.

A judgment was rendered by a Court in favor of
Roberto and against Francisco in the sum of
PS00,000. When the sheriff was in the process

626

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

of enforcing the writ of execution, Roberto
stopped a levy being made on the properties of
Francisco because he and the latter had agreed
that the amount due from Francisco will be
increased to P550,000 payable in 10 monthly
installments of P55,000 each, with Racquel, a
sister of Francisco, guaranteeing the payment
of the installments. After paying 5 monthly
installments or P275,000, Francisco and Racquel
stopped paying. Whereupon, Roberto asked the
sheriff to enforce the writ of execution for the
amount of P225,000. Should the sheriff enforce
the writ of execution? (80 Bar QS ed)

A.

No, the sheriff should not enforce the writ of
execution.
The Supreme Court in Fun Cam Lu v. Yap, 74
Phil. 287, has held that where the judgment is
novated by agreement between the judgment
obligee and obliger, the judgment may no longer
be enforced.
Here Roberto and Francisco had novated the
judgment by changing substantially the terms thereof.
Hence the judgment may no longer be enforced.

Q.

What is discretionary execution?

A.

The execution, ordered by the court in its
discretion, of a judgment or final order during the
pendency of an appeal. (S2 R39).

Q.

What are the requirements in order that
discretionary execution may issue? (MNG SH)

627
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.
1)

Motion of the prevailing party with notice to the
adverse party.

2)

Upon good reasons to be stated in the special
111
order after due hearing. (S2[a] R39.).

Q.

What is meant by "good reasons" which would
justify discretionary execution?

A.

Good reasons are those which constitute superior
circumstances demanding urgency which will
outweigh the injury or damages should the losing
party secure the reversal of the judgment. The
Rules of Court did not intend that execution
pending appeal shall issue as a matter of right.
(Ong v. Court of Appeals, 203 SCRA 38 [1991]).

Q.

Give examples of good reasons which may
justify discretionary execution.

A.
1) Where there is danger of the judgment
becoming ineffectual, as where the losing party
is disposing of its assets ( Scottish Union &
National Insurance Co. v. Macadaeg, 91 Phil.
891) or where the articles subject of the
case would deteriorate (Federation of United
NAMARCO Distributors v. Court of Appeals, 4
SCRA 867),
2)

Where the judgment debtor is insolvent or in
imminent danger of being insolvent. (Santos v.
Mojica, G.R. No. L-24266, 24 January 1969).

111
Take note however that under S6 R15 of the 2020 Rules, ii is now
discretionary upon the court to call a hearing on a litigious motion, including a
motion for execution pending appeal. p

628

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

Q.

Is financial distress of the prevailing party
which is a corporation a good reason for
granting execution pending appeal?

A.

No. The financial distress of a corporation does not
outweigh the long standing general policy of
enforcing only final and executory judgments.
Certainly, a juridical entity like petitioner corporation,
has other than extraordinary execution, alternative
remedies like loans, advances, internal cash
generation and the like to address its precarious
financial condition. (Pulumbarit v. CA, 14 October
2015, Jardeleza, J.).

Q.

P filed a suit to collect PS00,000 from D arising
from the value of construction materials
delivered by P to D which the latter paid for with
a check which bounced. The Regional Trial
Court rendered judgment in favor of P. D filed
an appeal. P filed a motion for execution
pending appeal with the RTC contending that
D's appeal was frivolous and dilatory. The RTC
granted the motion conditioned upon P posting
a bond in favor of D for the amount of PS00,000.
Was the grant of the motion for execution
pending appeal proper?

A.

No. The ground that the appeal is dilatory and that
a bond was posted by the prevailing party are by
themselves not sufficient to constitute good
grounds for the issuance of discretionary execution.
Where the reason given is that an appeal is
frivolous and dilatory, execution pending appeal
cannot be justified. This is because the trial court
would be virtually pre-empting the appellate court's
decision on the appeal.
629

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Likewise the mere posting of a bond is not a
good ground for the issuance of discretionary
execution. Otherwise, execution pending appeal
would issue as a matter of course. (Ong v. Court of
Appeals, 203 SCRA 38 [1991 ]).

(Note: If the motion for execution pending
appeal is filed with the appellate court, it can order
execution pending appeal if it finds that the appeal
is frivolous and dilatory).
Q.

May awards of moral and exemplary damages
and attorney's fees be the subject of execution
pending appeal?

A.

No. Unlike actual damages for which the petitioners
may clearly be held liable if they breach a specific
contract and the amounts of which are fixed and
certain, liabilities with respect to moral and exemplary
damages as well as the exact amounts remain
uncertain and indefinite pending resolution by the
appellate court. The existence of the factual bases
of these types of damages and their causal relation
to the petitioners' act will have to be determined in
the light of the assignments of errors on appeal.
(Tiorosio-Espinosa v. Hofilefla-Europa, 20 January
2016, Jardeleza, J.).

Q.

Should a motion for execution pending appeal
be filed with the trial court or with the appellate
court?

A.

The motion for execution may be filed:
a)

With the trial court while: (JP)

It has jurisdiction over the case, and

630

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

It is in possession of either the original record
or the record on appeal (JP); or
b) With the appellate court after the trial court has- lost jurisdiction. (S2[a] R39.).
Q.

May a motion for execution pending appeal be
filed with the trial court after it has lost
jurisdiction but is still in possession of either
the original record or the record on appeal?

A.

No more.

Q.

May the trial court order execution pending
appeal even after it has lost jurisdiction over the
case/subject matter of the record on appeal?

A.

Yes, provided that a motion for execution pending
appeal was filed with the trial court before it lost
jurisdiction and provided the order is issued prior to
the transmittal of the original record or record on
appeal. (S9 R41 in relation to S2 R39).

Q.

When does the trial court lose jurisdiction?

A.

In appeals by notice of appeal, the trial court loses
jurisdiction over the (entire) case: (PE)
1)

Upon perfection of the appeals filed in due
time, and

2)

Upon the expiration of the time to appeal of the
other parties.

In appeals by record on appeal, the trial courtloses jurisdiction over the subject matter of the
record on appeal (but retains jurisdiction over the
remaining subject matter not covered by the
appeal): (AE)
631
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

1) Upon the approval of the record on appeal filed
in due time, and
2)

Upon the expiration of the time to appeal of the
other parties. (S9 R41).

Q.

When is a party's appeal deemed perfected as
to him?

A.

A party's appeal by notice of appeal is deemed
perfected as to him upon the filing of the notice of
appeal in due time.
A party's appeal by record on appeal is
deemed perfected as to him with respect to the
subject matter thereof upon the approval of the
record on appeal filed in due time. (S9 R41).
Under R42, the appeal is deemed perfected as
to the petitioner upon the timely filing of the petition
for review and the payment of the corresponding
docket and other la1Nful fees. (S8 R42).

Q.

May the trial court grant a motion for execution
pending appeal if there is a pending motion for
reconsideration of its judgment?

A.

No. Where there is a pending motion for
reconsideration of the trial court's decision, an
order of execution pending appeal is improper and
premature.The pendency of the motion for
reconsideration legally precludes execution of the
decision because the motion serves as the
movant's vehicle to point out the findings and
conclusions of the decision which, in his view, are
not supported by law or the evidence and,
therefore, gives the trial judge the occasion to
reverse himself. In the event that the trial judge
finds the motion for reconsideration meritorious, he
632

J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

can of course reverse the decision. (JP Latex
Technology, Inc. v. Ba/Ions, Granger Balloons, Inc.,
581 SCRA 553, 563 [2009]).
Q.

On September 25 the private respondents
received the RTC's decision annulling the sale
of certain real properties and ordering them to
deposit with the court the rentals and/or income
due from such properties. The private respondents
filed a notice of appeal on October 2. The
petitioner who received the RTC decision on
October 1, filed on October 11 a motion for
immediate execution pending appeal of that
portion of the judgment requiring deposit. The trial
court granted the motion. On certiorari, the Court
of Appeals set aside the order granting execution
pending appeal on the ground that the appeal was
perfected on October 10 or the expiration of the
private respondents' period of appeal and hence
the trial court already lost jurisdiction at that point.
Was the setting aside of the order granting
execution pending appeal proper?

A.

No. In appeals by notice of appeal, the court loses
jurisdiction over the case upon the perfection of the
appeals filed in due time and the expiration of the
time to appeal of the other parties. (S9 R41 ). Here
the appeal was perfected as to private respondent
on October 2 with the filing of the appeal in due
time. However the period to appeal of the other
party, that is the petitioner, was up to October 16.
Hence when the petitioner filed his motion for
execution pending appeal on October 11, the trial
court still had jurisdiction as the petitioner's period
to appeal had not yet expired. (Belgado v.
Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 74975, 12
January 1987).

and B. The court rendered judgment in favor of
P. P and A received a copy of the decision on
April 1 while B received his copy on April 10. A
filed a notice of appeal on April 10. P wants to
file a motion for execution pending appeal on
April 20, with the original record still in the

a)

Should P file his motion with the RTC or

day after A had filed his notice of appeal.
Should P file his motion with the RTC or

A.
a)

P should file his motion for execution pending
appeai with the RTC.

S2(a) R39, the motion for execution pending
appeal should be filed with the trial court while it
has jurisdiction over the case and is in possession
of the original record.
Here the RTC still has jurisdiction over the
case since the appeal period of B has not yet
expired (S9 R41) and it is in possession of the
original record.
b)

P can neither file his motion for execution

with trial court which approves it on July 1. On
July 3 Plaintiff wants to file motion for execution
pending appeal against A. Where should the
Plaintiff file the motion?

A.

With the appellate court. Note that the trial court
lost jurisdiction over the subject matter of the record
on appeal upon the approval of the record on
appeal and the expiration of the time to appeal (30
days) of the other parties from the subject matter of
the record on appeal.

Q.

What are the 3 stages of the trial court's
jurisdiction over an appealed case?

A.

1)

Full jurisdiction: When the trial court has
jurisdiction and it is in possession of the original
record or record on appeal, as the case
may be. (JP)

2)

Residual jurisdiction: When the trial court has
lost jurisdiction but the original record or the
record on appeal has not yet been transmitted
to the appellate court. (P)
635

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

3)

Executory jurisdiction. The trial court has lost
jurisdiction and the original record or record on
appeal has been transmitted to the appellate
court. The trial court has no more jurisdiction
or power over the case save to issue and
enforce the writ of execution should the
judgment therein become final.

Q.

May discretionary execution be stayed?

A.

Yes. Discretionary execution may be stayed upon
approval by the proper court of a sufficient
supersedeas bond filed by the party against whom
it is directed, conditioned upon the performance of
the judgment or order allowed to be executed in
case it shall be finally sustained in whole or in part.
The supersedeas bond may be proceeded against
on motion with notice to the surety. (S3 R39).

Q.

What is the "proper court" which will approve
the supersedeas bond?

A.

Generally, the court which issued the order for
execution pending appeal, be it the trial or the
appellate court. (JOSE FERIA, 1997 RULES OF
CIVIL PROCEDURE 117 [1997]). However once
the original record or the record on appeal is
transmitted to the appellate court, it is only that
court which can approve the supersedeas bond.

Q.

What judgments are immediately executory and
shall not be stayed by an appeal therefrom?

shall not be stayed by an appeal taken
therefrom, unless otherwise ordered by the
trial court. (S4 R39).
2) A judgment rendered against the defendant in
an §jectment case is immediately executory
notwithstanding an appeal unless defendant
executes a supersedeas bond and makes
periodic deposits of the rent due or the
reasonable value for the use and occupation of
the premises. (S19 R?O).
3)

In ejectment cases, the judgment of the RTC
against the defendant shall be immediately

that may be taken therefrom. (S21 R?O).

4)

In civil cases governed by the Rule on

on appeal shall be immediately executory,
without prejudice to a further appeal that may.,
be taken therefrom. (S21 Rule on Summary
Procedure).

5) A geficiency judgment in a judicial foreclosure
proceeding, while it may be appealed, is
immediately executory. (S6 R68).
6)

Judgment or final order of a court in a case of
indirect _gontempt may be appealed to the

Distinguish between a judgment or final order
which is "immediately executory" from one
which is "immediately final and executory."

A judgment which is immediately executory may be
appealed but the appeal does not stay the execution
of the judgment or final order. On the other hand, a
judgment or final order which is immediately final and
executory may not be appealed.

23, SC A.M. No. 08-8-7-SC effective 1 October

Petitioners were employees of respondent
Napar, a recruitment agency owned and managed
by respondent Lacsamana. Napar assigned
petitioners at respondent Jonas, a corporation
engaged in the manufacture of various food
products with respondent Young as its President,
to work as factory workers, machine operator,
quality control inspector, selector, mixer, and
warehouseman. Sometime in September of
2002, Petitioners filed before the Arbitration
Branch of the NLRC three separate complaints
for wage differentials, 13th month pay, overtime
pay, holiday pay, premium pay for holiday and
rest day, service incentive leave pay, and
unpaid emergency cost of living allowance
(ECOLA) against respondents, which complaints
were consolidated before Labor Arbiter Jaime
Reyno. In January 2003, Petitioners
and
Respondents entered into a Joint Compromise
Agreement which provides that Petitioners shall
be considered regular employees of Napar,
shall be re-assigned and assured that they will
be given work, and that in case Napar fails to reassign and provide work for Petitioners, Napar
shall reinstate them in the payroll. The
compromise agreement was approved by the
Labor Arbiter.
However Napar failed to reassign and provide work for Petitioners and to
639

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

reinstate them in the payroll. The Petitioners
filed a complaint for illegal dismissal with the
Labor Arbiter. The Respondents contend that
the complaint for illegal dismissal was barred
by res judicata and that the remedy of the
Petitioners was to move for the execution of the
compromise judgment. Is the Respondents'
contention correct?
A.

No. A compromise agreement, once approved, has
the effect of res judicata between the parties and
should not be disturbed except for vices of consent,
forgery, fraud, misrepresentation, and coercion. A
judgment upon compromise is therefore not
appealable, immediately executory, and can be
enforced by a writ of execution. However, this
broad precept enunciated under Article 2037 of the
Civil Code has been qualified by Article 2041 of the
same Code which recognizes the right of an
aggrieved party to either (1) enforce the compromise
by a writ of execution, or (2) regard it as rescinded
and insist upon his original demand, upon the other
party's failure or refusal to abide by the
compromise. Article 2041 confers upon the party
concerned the authority, not only to regard the
compromise agreement as rescinded but also, to
insist upon his original demand. The Petitioners
validly exercised this option as there was breach
and non-compliance of the Joint Compromise
Agreement by Respondents. (/nutan v. Napar
Contracting & Allied Services, 25 November 2015,
Del Castillo, J.).

Q.

A wife filed with the RTC a petition for the
declaration of the presumptive death of her
husband. The RTC granted the petition and
declared that the husband is presumptively
640

J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

dead. The Office of the Solicitor General filed a
notice of appeal. The RTC elevated the records
of the case to the Court of Appeals. Did the RTC
act correctly in elevating the case records?

A.

No. A petition for the declaration of presumptive
death of an absentee spouse is governed by Title
XI of the Family Code regarding summary judicial
proceedings in the Family Law. (Articles 41 and
253, Family Code). Article 247 of Title XI provides
that "the judgment of the lower court shall be
immediately final and executory." Hence it was
erroneous for the OSG to file a notice of appeal
and for the RTC to elevate the case records to the
CA. (Republic v. Bermudez-Lorino, G.R. No.
160258, 19 January 2005; Republic v. Granada,
G.R. 187512, 13 June 2012). An aggrieved party
may file a special civil action for certiorari with the
Court of Appeals but he has to show grave abuse
of discretion amounting to lack of or excess of
jurisdiction. (Republic v. Granada, supra).

Q.

Up to when may a final and executory judgment
or order be executed by motion?

A.

Within 5 years from the date of its entry. (S6 R39).
If a writ of execution was issued and levy made
within the 5-year period, the auction sale of the
property thereafter will be valid provided it is made
within the 10-year period. If no levy was made
within the 5-year period, the writ of execution may
no longer be enforced by motion.

Q.

After the lapse of 5 years from the entry of a
final and executory judgment or order, may the
same be still enforced?

641
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

Yes but no longer by motion but by independent
action. The prevailing party should file an action for
revival of the judgment after 5 years but within 10
years from the date of its entry. (Articles 1144[3],
1152, Civil Code). When the judgment has been
revived, the prevailing party can then enforce it by
motion within 5 years from the date of entry of the
revived judgment. (S6 R39)

Q.

A revived judgment was not enforced within 5
years from its entry. May it still be revived by
filing a second action for revival of the judgment?

A.

Yes. The last sentence of S6 R36 explicitly
provides that "[t]he revived judgment may also be
enforced by motion within 5 years from the date of
its entry and thereafter by action before it is barred
by the statute of limitations." This amendment in the
1997 Rules superseded the ruling in Luzon Surety
Company v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 151
SCRA 652 (1987), to the effect that there can be
only one action for revival of judgment and that a
revived judgment can be enforced only by motion
for execution or money claim within 5 years from its
entry. (JOSE Y. FERIA, 1997 RULES OF CIVIL
PROCEDURE 118 [1997]).

Q.

What is an alias writ of execution? Is there still
a need to issue one under the 1997 Rules of
Civil Procedure?

A.

An alias writ of execution is one issued in lieu of the
original writ of execution that had already
lapsed. Before the 1997 revision to the Rules of Civil
Procedure, the lifetime of a writ of execution, under
the then s-1-1R39, was 60 days from its receipt by

642

J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

the officer required to enforce the same and after
said period, the writ becomes functus officio.
However, it must be noted that under the
present S14 R39, the lifetime of the writ of
execution is no longer 60 days but during the
period within which the judgment may be enforced
by motion, that is, within 5 years from entry thereof.
Thus within the 5-year period, a writ of execution is
still effective and there is no need for the issuance
of an alias writ of execution. (Bajet v. Baclig, A.M.
No. RTJ-00-1598, 30 July 2002). Conversely after
the 5-year period, the judgment may no longer be
enforced by motion and a motion for the issuance
of an alias writ of execution should be denied.
Q.

The judgment in a collection case in favor of P
against D became final and executory. Within
the 5-year period, P filed a motion for issuance
of writ of execution which was granted.
Unfortunately for P he was not able to locate
property of D which may be levied within the 5year period. After the 5-year period, P was able
to locate a property of D. May P file a motion for
the issuance of an alias writ of execution?

A.

No. There is no such thing as an alias writ of
execution under the 1997 Rules. A judgment must
be enforced by motion and by levy on execution
within the 5-year period. After said period, it may no
longer be so enforced. The remedy of the judgment
obligee is to file an action for revival of judgment.

Q.

What is a dormant judgment? How may it be
enforced?

A.

A dormant judgment is one which has not been
enforced by motion within 5 years after its entry and
643

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

is thus reduced to a mere right of action in favor of
the judgment-obligee. It may be enforced by filing
action for revival of judgment and enforcing the
decision therein. (Sa/vante v. Cruz, 88 Phil. 236).
Q.

Which court has jurisdiction over an action for
revival of judgment?

A.

The Regional Trial Court has original and exclusive
jurisdiction, since the action for revival of judgment
is an action incapable of pecuniary estimation.
(Anama v. Citibank, N.A., 13 December 2017,
Jardeleza, J.).

Q.

Should the action for revival of judgment be
filed with the same court which rendered the
judgment sought to be revived?

A.

No. As an action for revival of judgment is a new
action, the rules on instituting and commencing
actions apply, including the rules on jurisdiction. Its
jurisdictional requirements are not dependent on
the previous action and the petition does not
necessarily have to be filed in the same court which
rendered judgment. (Anama v. Citibank, N.A., 13
December 2017, Jardeleza, J.).

Q.

Where is the venue of an action for revival of
judgment?

A.

If the action for revival of judgment affects title to or
possession of real property or interest therein, then
it is a real action that must be filed with the court
having jurisdiction over the place where the real
property is situated.
Otherwise, the action for revival of judgment is
a personal action wherein venue lies with the
residence of either the plaintiff or defendant, at the
644

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

option of the plaintiff. (Infante v. Aran Builders, Inc.,
24 August 2007, Austria-Martinez, J.).

Q.

Plaintiff filed an action to revive a RTC judgment
against the Defendant. The judgment sought to
be revived declared the Plaintiff as the owner of
a parcel of land located in Muntinlupa City and
ordered the Defendant to execute an absolute
deed of sale thereof in Plaintiff's favor.
Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the
ground of improper venue. The Defendant
contends that the action for revival of judgment
is a personal action which should have been
filed in Makati City where the parties reside.
Should the motion to dismiss on the ground of
improper venue be granted?

A.

No. If the action for revival of judgment affects title
to or possession of real property or interest therein,
then it is a real action that must be filed with the
court having jurisdiction over the place where the
real property is situated.
Here the judgment sought to be revived was a
real action since it affected title to a parcel bf land.
Hence the venue was properly laid in the RTC of
Muntinlupa City which had jurisdiction over the
place where the property was situated. (Infante v. Aran Builders, Inc., supra).

Q. A, a resident of Dagupan City, secured a favorable
judgment in an ejectment case against X, a

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Manila. What is the procedure to be
followed by A in enforcing the judgment?
(97 Bar)

A.
a)

A should file an action for revival of the
judgment. This is because the judgment cannot
be enforced by motion since it is already more
than five years from the entry of the judgment.

The action for revival of the judgment, being
incapable of pecuniary estimation, should be filed
with the regional trial court. Since the action affects
possession to real property, venue is in Manila
where the venue of the ejectment suit lies.
Q.

A files a case against B. While awaiting decision
on the case, A goes to the United States to
work. Upon her return to the Philippines, seven
years later, A discovers that a decision was
rendered by the court in her favor a few months
after she had left. Can A file a motion for
execution of the judgment? Explain briefly. (07
Bar Q10b)

A.

No, A cannot file a motion for the execution of the
judgment.
Under S6 R39, a final and executory judgment
may be enforced by motion within a period of 5
years from its date of entry.
Here more than 5 years has elapsed from the
entry of the judgment. Hence A cannot enforce the
same by motion but only by an independent action.

(Note: The facts of the problem do not show

may however be reasonably presumed by
the examinee.)
Q.

P filed an application for the registration of a
parcel of land in his name with the RTC. D, an
occupant of the land, filed an opposition
thereto. The RTC rendered a judgment in favor
of P which became final and executory in 1997.
In 2008 P filed with the RTC a petition for the
issuance of a writ of possession seeking to
evict D. D opposed the application on the
ground that the petition was barred since it was
filed more than 10 years after the entry of
judgment. Should D's opposition be granted?

A.

No. The five and ten-year periods under S6 R39 do
not apply to special proceedings, such as land
registration and cadastral cases where the right to
apply for a writ of possession is imprescriptible.
Moreover under Section 47 of the Property
Registration Decree, no right in derogation to that of
the registered owner may be acquired by prescription.
(Rodi/ v. Benedicto, 95 SCRA 137 [1980]).

Q.

On 28 July 2010, respondent Yap filed with the
RTC of Cebu City a petition for cancellation and
re-issuance of Decree No. 99500 covering Lot
No. 922 of the Carcar Cadastre, and for the
issuance of the corresponding Original Certificate
of Title (OCT) pursuant to the re-issued decree.
His petition alleged that while a valid decree
was issued for Lot No. 922 in 1920, based on
the certification from the Register of Deeds of
the Province of Cebu, there is no showing or
proof that an OCT was ever issued covering the
647

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

said lot. The RTC granted the petition and
ordered the Register of Deeds of the Province
of Cebu to cancel Decree No. 99500, re-issue a
new copy thereof, and on the basis of such new
copy, issue an Original Certificate of Title in the
name of Andres Abellana, as administrator of
the Estate of Juan Rodriguez.
On appeal, the OSG postulates that the
petition should be denied due to Yap and his
predecessors' failure to file the proper motion
to execute Decree No. 99500 as prescribed
under Section 6, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. It
also subscribes that the petition is now barred by
the statute of limitations since nine decades had
already passed after the issuance of the said
decree in November 1920 without any action
brought upon by Yap or his predecessors-ininterest. Is the OSG's argument correct?
A.

No. There is nothing in the iaw that iimits the period
within which the court may order or issue a decree
in a land registration case. The reason is that the
judgment is merely declaratory in character and
does not need to be asserted or enforced against
the adverse party. it is axiomatic that S6 R39 does
not apply in land registration proceedings. There is
no provision in the Land Registration Act similar to
S6 R39, regarding the execution of a judgment in a
civil action, except the proceedings to place the
winner in possession by virtue of a writ of
possession. (Republic v. Yap, 7 February 2018,
Velasco, J.).

Q.

Banco Filipino filed a petition for extrajudicial
foreclosure of real estate mortgage against the
Petitioners. In due course, the property was

648
J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

sold at public auction and bought by Banco
Filipino. After the expiration of the redemption
period, Banco Filipino filed a petition for
issuance of writ of possession pursuant to
Section 7 of Act No. 3135. The court granted the
petition and issued the writ of possession in
1984 but the same was not implemented. Seven
years thereafter Banco Filipino filed a motion
for issuance of alias writ of possession.
Petitioners opposed the same on the ground
that since more than 5 years had elapsed from
the order issuing the writ of possession, the
same can no longer be enforced by mere
motion. Should the court grant the motion for
the issuance of alias writ of possession?
A.

Yes. S6 R39 applies only to ordinary civil actions,
not to other or extraordinary proceedings not
expressly governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure
but by some other specific law or legal modality. S6
R39 is not applicable to an ex parte petition for the
issuance of the writ of possession as it is not in the
nature of a civil action governed by the Rules of
Civil Procedure but a judicial proceeding governed
separately by Section 7 of Act No. 3135 which
regulates the methods of effecting an extrajudicial
foreclosure of mortgage. (Topacio v. Banco Filipino,
17 November 2010, Brion, J.).

Q.

Lirio filed a petition for the original registration
of Lot 18281 with the CFI of Cebu. (1st LRC
Case) The CFI granted the petition and the
decision became final and executory in 1977.
The CFI issued an order directing the LRC to
issue the decree of registration and the
certificate of title in favor of Lirio. No decree of
registration was however issued by the LRC. In
649

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

1997 Petitioner filed with the RTC of Cebu an
application for registration of title to the same
nd

lot. (2 LRC Case). The Respondents (heirs of
Lirio) filed an answer in which they alleged that
nd
the 2 LRC Case is barred by res judicata or
st
the 1 LRC Case. Petitioner argues that the 1st
LRC Case cannot be the basis of res judicat since
it is an extinct judgment, that is, one which was
not enforced within 10 years from the date of its
entry pursuant to S6 R39 of the Rules of Court. Is
Petitioner's argument meritorious?

A.

No, the Petitioner's argument is not meritorious.
The Supreme Court has held that Section 6,
Rule 39 of the Rules of Court does not apply in land
registration proceedings. S6 R39 refers to civil
actions and is not applicable to special proceedings,
such as a land registration case. This is so because
a party in a civil action must promptly enforce a
judgment that is secured against the adverse party,
and his failure to act to enforce the same within a
reasonable time as provided in the Rules makes
the decision unenforceable against the losing party.
In special proceedings, the purpose is to establish
a status, a right or a particular fact; in land
registration proceedings, the ownership by a person
of a parcel of land is sought to be established. (Ting
v. Heirs ofLirio, G.R. No. 168913, 14 March 2007).

Q.

May the five-year period to enforce the judgment
by motion be suspended?

A.

Yes where the delay in enforcing the judgment is
attributable to or due to the acts of the losing party.
In such a case the time during which the execution
is stayed is excluded and the five-year period

650

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

extended by the delay caused by the losing party.
An example would be where the losing party
employed legal maneuvers to block the enforcement
of the judgment. In a case, petitioner triggered the
series of delays in the execution of the RTC's final
decision by filing numerous motions and appeals in
the appellate courts, even causing the CA's
issuance of the TRO enjoining the enforcement of
the decision. (Central Surety & Ins. Co. v. Planters
Product, 7 March 2007).
Q.

P filed a collection case for P700,000 against D.
Judgment in favor of P was entered in 5
January 2000 but the same was not enforced by
motion. On 19 December 2009, P served a
written demand to pay upon D which the latter.did not heed. On 2 February 2010, P filed with
the RTC an action to revive the judgment in the
collection case. D filed a motion to dismiss on
the ground of res judicata. P opposed the
motion stating that under Article 1155 of the
Civil Code, the prescriptive period was interrupted
when he made an extrajudicial demand made on
D. Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

A.

Yes since the action was brought more than ten
years from the entry of judgment in the collection
case. P's written demand did not interrupt the
running of the prescriptive period. The reason is
that Article 1155 of the Civil Code, which provides
that the prescription of actions is interrupted when
there is an extrajudicial demand by the creditors
and when there is a written acknowledgment of the
debt by the debtor, refers to actions to recover on a
debt arising from contract or from law, and not to an
action to revive a judgment. (Philippine National

Bank v. Osete, 24 SCRA 63 [1968]). 112
Q.

The judgment in a collection case in favor of P
against D became final and executory and
judgment was entered on 20 January 2000. On 5
January 2010, P filed with the RTC an action for
revival of the judgment, but the same was
dismissed without prejudice for failure to serve
summons on D. Copy of the dismissal order
was served on P on 1 April 2010. May P still
file an action to revive the judgment and if so,
until when?

A.

Yes, P may still file an action to revive the
judgment. The filing of the action for revival
interrupted the running of the prescriptive period.
The period started to run again when the action
was dismissed on 1 April 2010, and P has the
balance of 15 days or until 16 April 2010 within
which to file the action for revivai. (Board of
Liquidators v. Zulueta, 115 SCRA 548 [1982]).

Q.

Respondents filed an action for cancellation of
title against Petitioner (Civil Case No. 15357).
The RTC, in this case, cancelled the titles of the
petitioner and his father Jose because they
were obtained through the misrepresentation of
the petitioner's grandfather, Isidro Campit. The
judgment became final and unappealable in
July 1979. The respondents have long desired
to divide the subject property among themselves,
but the petitioner adamantly refused to surrender
112

The statement in Board of Liquidators v. Zulueta, 115 SCRA 548, 557
(1982), that the written extrajudicial demand interrupted the prescriptive period
for filing the revival suit was merely an obiter dictum that did not overturn the
holdings in Delosa and Osete.

652
J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

his title to the property to them, or to the
Register of Deeds, despite their formal demand.
Due to the petitioner's continued refusal to
surrender the subject TCT, the respondents
filed anew an action for annulment and
cancellation of title with the RTC in August
2003, docketed as Civil Case No. 18421. The
petitioner opposed the respondents' action and
argued that the August 1978 decision in Civil
Case No. 15357, which declared his title null
and void, could no longer be enforced because
its execution was already barred by the Statute
of Limitations, as the said decision was never
executed within 10 years from July 19, 1979 the date of finality of the judgment. Is the
petitioner's opposition valid?
A.

No. Considering that the action for annulment and
cancellation of title filed by the respondents is
substantially in the nature of an action for
reconveyance based on an implied or constructive
trust, combined with the fact that the respondents
have always been in possession of the subject
property, Civil Case No. 18421 may be treated as
an action to quiet title, the filing of which does not
prescribe. Thus, the respondents' filing of Civil
Case No.18421 was proper and not barred by the
time limitations set forth under the Rules of Court in
enforcing or executing a final and executory
judgment. (Campit v. Gripa, 17 September 2014).

Q.

Petitioner was found guilty of homicide and
sentenced to imprisonment of 12 years, 1
month and 1 day to 20 years and to pay the
heirs of the victim P32,000 for funeral expenses
and P30,000 as death indemnity. The judgment
became final and executory in 1989. In 2010,

653
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

private respondent, the son of the deceased
victim, filed a Motion for Execution of Judgment.
He alleged, among others, that despite his
request to the City Prosecutor to file a motion
for execution, the judgment has not been
enforced because said prosecutor has not
acted upon his request. The Petitioner opposed
the motion contending that the judgment can no
longer be enforced pursuant to S6 R39. Should
the RTC grant the motion for execution?
A.

With respect to the penalty of imprisonment, the
judgment may be enforced. The applicable provision
is not S6 R39 but Article 93 of the Revised Penal
Code. Pursuant to Article 93, the period of
prescription of the penalty did not start to run since
the Petitioner did not evade the service of his
sentence by escaping from imprisonment. Since the
penalty had not prescribed, the same may
be enforced by arresting the Petitioner to serve
his sentence.
With respect however to the civil liability, the
judgment may no longer be enforced. The civil
liability arising from the offense has prescribed
pursuant to Article 1144(3) of the Civil Code, in
relation to S6 R39. (Basilonia v. Villaruz, 10 August
2015, Peralta, J.).

Q.

In an action for revival of a judgment of partition,
is it necessary that all the parties, in whose favor
the case for partition was adjudged, be made
plaintiffs to the action for revival of judgment?

A.

No. Even just one of the co-owners, by himself
alone, can bring an action for the recovery of the
co-owned property, even through an action for
654

J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

revival of judgment, because the enforcement of
the judgment would result in such recovery of
property. Any which one of said prevailing parties,
who had an interest in the enforcement of the
decision, may file the complaint for revival of
judgment, even just by himself. (Clidoro v.
Ja/manzar, 9 July 2014).
Q.

How may execution issue or be enforced in
case of the death of a party?

A.

In case of the death of a party, execution may issue
or be enforced in the following manner:

Q.

a)

In case of the death of the judgment obligee,
upon the application of his executor or
administrator, or successor in interest.

b)

In case of the death of the judgment obligor,
against his executor or administrator or
successor in interest, if the judgment be for the
recovery of real or personal property, or the
enforcement of a lien thereon. However if the
judgment is for money, it must be filed as a
money claim against the estate of the judgment
obligor. (S5 R86).

c)

In case of the death of the judgment obligor,
after execution is actually levied upon any of

(CAPTION & TITLE)
MOTION FOR EXECUTION

The Plaintiff, through the undersigned
counsel most respectfully alleges that:
1) A decision has been rendered in this case
for collection of PS00,000 and the period for
appeal had long expired without
the
Defendant making an appeal.
2)

The Decision is thus final and executory.

What is the defect of this model form?
A.

It does not comply with S8(e) R39 which provides
that the motion for execution shall specify the
amounts of the interest, costs, damages, rents, or
profits (PIRC D) due, aside from the principal
obligation under the judgment.

Effect Of Judgments

Q.

May the sheriff compute the interest where the
same was not specifically indicated in the writ
of execution as mandated by S8 R39?

A.

No. It is the judge's, not the sheriff's, duty to
compute the interest payable. (Plantilla v. Baliwag,
6 June 2001 ).

Q.

How do the Rules classify judgments which are
the subject of execution?

A.

The Rules classify such judgments into three:

Q.

1)

Money judgments. (S9).

2)

Judgments for specific acts. (S10).

3)

Special judgments. (S11 ).

Outline the procedure for enforcement
execution of judgments for money.

of

A.
1) Immediate payment on demand. The officer
shall demand from the judgment obliger the
immediate payment of the full amount stated in
the writ of execution and all lawful fees. The
judgment obliger shall pay in cash, certified
bank check payable to the judgment obligee, or
any other form of payment acceptable to the
judgment obligee. If the judgment obligee or his
duly authorized representative is present at the
time of payment, the judgment obliger shall pay
directly to the judgment obligee or representative.
Otherwise the judgment obliger shall deliver the
payment to the executing sheriff.
2)

Satisfaction by levy. If payment cannot be
made under No. 1, the officer shall levy upon
657

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

the properties of the judgment obligor giving the
latter the option to immediately choose which
property or part thereof may be levied upon,
sufficient to satisfy the judgment. If the judgment
obligor does not exercise the option, the officer
shall first levy on the personal properties, if any,
and then on the real properties if the personal
properties are insufficient to answer for
the judgment.
3)

Q.

Garnishment of debts and credits. The officer
may levy on debts due the judgment obligor
and other credits, including bank deposits,
financial interests, royalties, commissions and
other personal property not capable of manual
delivery in the possession or control of third
parties. Levy shall be made by serving notice
upon the person owing such debts or having in
his possession or control such credits to which
the judgment obligor is entitled. The garnishee
shall make a written report to the court within 5
days from service of the notice of garnishment.
The garnished amount in cash, or certified bank
check issued in the name of the judgment
obligee, shall be delivered directly to the
judgment obligee within 10 working days from
service of notice on said garnishee requiring
such delivery, except the lawful fees which
shall be paid directly to the court. (S9 R39).

A judgment was rendered in favor of P against
D for a sum of money. The judgment became
final and executory and a writ of execution was
issued. The sheriff (unaccompanied by P) went
to the Defendant who issued a check payable to
the order of the sheriff for the amount of the
judgment award. The sheriff deposited the
658

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

check in his personal account, withdrew the
proceeds, and absconded. May the judgment
still be enforced against D?

A.

Yes. There was no valid payment since the check
was issued payable to the sheriff and not to the
judgment obligee P. Hence D's obligation still
subsists and a writ of execution may still be
enforced against him. (Philippine Airlines Inc. v.
Court of Appeals, 181 SCRA 557 [1990]). The PAL
ruling was subsequently codified in S9(a) R39 of
the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.

Q.

In the preceding problem, would your answer
be the same if what was turned over by D to the
sheriff was cash?

A.

No. In that case there would be valid payment
pursuant to S9 R39.

Q.

A judgment in favor of P against D became final
and executory. The sheriff garnished D's bank
account with Banco de Plata. Five days later the
sheriff went back to the bank and the bank manager turned over to the sheriff a manager's
check payable to P representing the garnished
amount. The sheriff absconded with the check
and the proceeds thereof after forging the
signature of P. May the bank be held liable by P
in case of loss?

A.

Yes. The bank, as garnishee, should have
delivered directly to P the check as mandated by
S9(c) R39. If any loss occurs to P, the bank should
be held accountable.

Q.

How is a judgment for conveyance, delivery of
deeds, or other specific acts (eds) in connection
therewith enforced?

A.

If a judgment directs a party to execute a
conveyance of land or personal property, or to
deliver deeds or other documents, or to perform
any other specific act in connection therewith, and
the party fails to comply within the time specified,
the court may direct the act to be done at the cost
of the disobedient party by some other person
appointed by the court and the act when so done
shall have like effect as if done by the party. If real
or personal property is situated within the
Philippines, the court in lieu of directing a
conveyance thereof may by an order divest the title
of any party and vest it in others, which shall have
the force and effect of a conveyance executed in
due form of law. (S10[a] R39).

Q.

The judgment directed the defendant to execute
a conveyance of land located in the Philippines
in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant refused to
do so. May the court hold defendant in contempt?

A.

No. The court can simply direct the conveyance to
be done by some other person or issue an order
divesting the title of the defendant over the property
and vesting it in the plaintiff. (Ca/uag v. Pecson,
G.R. No. L-1403; 29 October 1948).

Q.

How shall the officer enforce a judgment for the
delivery or restitution of real property?

A.

The officer shall demand of the person against
whom the judgment for the delivery or restitution of
real property is rendered and all persons claiming
rights under him to peaceably vacate the property
660

J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

within 3 working days, and restore possession
thereof to the judgment obligee; otherwise, the
officer shall oust all such persons therefrom with
the assistance, if necessary, of appropriate peace
officers, and employing such means as may be
reasonably necessary to retake possession, and
place the judgment obligee in possession of such
property. (S10[c] R39).

Q.

P filed an action for recovery of possession of
land against D. The RTC decided in favor of P
and after the judgment had become final and
executory the RTC, upon P's motion, issued a
writ of execution directing the sheriff to place P
in possession of the subject land. When the
sheriff tried to evict D from the land, the latter
refused to do so. May the RTC hold Din indirect
contempt?

A.

No. The writ was not directed to D but to the sheriff.
As the writ did not command the judgment debtor to
do anything, he cannot be guilty of the acts
described in Rule 71 which is "disobedience of or
resistance to a lawful writ, process, order, judgment,
or command of any court." The proper procedure is
for the sheriff to oust D, availing of the assistance of
peace officers pursuant to S10(c) R39. (Lipata v.
Tutaan, L-16643, 29 September 1983). 113

A.

No, except upon special order of the court, issued
upon motion of the judgment obligee after due
hearing and after the judgment obliger or his agent
has failed to remove the same within a reasonable
time fixed by the court. (SM HR) (S1O[d] R39).114

Q.

What is a special "break-open" order?

A.

It is the special order provided for in S1O(d) R39.

Q.

In an ejectment case, the sheriff and plaintiff's
counsel went to the defendant's premises in
order to deliver possession to the plaintiff by
virtue of a writ of execution. They found no one
staying thereat but with the door padlocked. In
order to deliver possession to plaintiff, the
sheriff "smashed" the padlock. Plaintiff's lawyer
was charged administratively by the defendant
who argued that the sheriff and the lawyer
"used violence to break open [his] domicile
without authority from the court." Is the lawyer
administratively liable?

A.

No. There is only one instance where a special
"break-open" order is required and that is under
S10(d) R39. This is evidently not the case here
since no building or structure constructed by the
defendant was demolished or required to be
demolished. The sheriff cannot be expected to wait
for the defendant to return before enforcing the writ
of execution. (Arcadia v. Ylagan, A.M. No. 2734, 30
July 1986).

114
Note that under S6 R15, the conduct of a hearing is only discretionary
upon the court.

Q.

What is a special judgment?

A.

One which requires the performance of any act,
other than the payment of money or the sale or
delivery of real or personal property, which a party
must personally do because his personal
qualifications and circumstances have been taken
into consideration. (Caluag v. Pecson, 82 Phil. 8).
Note however that the judgment should not require
the performance of a service otherwise that would
run afoul of the Constitutional proscription against
involuntary servitude.

Q.

How is a special judgment executed or enforced?

A.

A certified copy of the judgment shall be attached
to the writ of execution and served by the officer
upon the party against whom the same is rendered
or upon any other persons required thereby, or by
law, to obey the same, and such party or person
may be punished for contempt if he disobeys
the same.

Q.

Give an example of a special judgment.

A.

One which orders the defendant to disclose a
secret formula, code, or password to the plaintiff, or
to install a software personally designed by and
known only to the defendant.

Q.

What is the effect of levy on execution as to
third persons?

A.

The levy on execution shall create a lien in favor of
the judgment obligee over the right, title, and
interest of the judgment obliger in such property at
the time of the levy, subject to liens and
encumbrances then existing. (S12 R39). In respect
of land, the writ of execution shall be registered

natural persons. (D'Armoured Security and Inv.
Agency v. Orpra, 27 June 2005)
Q.

Atty. Magtanggol Abogado recently passed the
bar. He ordered a complete set of SCRA and
Philippine Reports from Central Bookstore, Inc.
He was unable to pay the price thereof. Central
sued Atty. Abogado for collection of the unpaid
price and won. The judgment became final and
executory. May the sheriff levy upon the SCRA
and Philippine Report books?

A.

Yes. No article mentioned in S13 R39 shall be
exempt from execution issued upon a judgment
recovered for its price or upon a judgment of
foreclosure of a mortgage thereon. (S13 R39).

Q.

When must the exemptions under S13 R39 be
claimed?

A.

The exemptions under S13 R39 must be claimed at
the time the sheriff is effecting the levy and
garnishment; otherwise these are deemed waived.
(Herrera v. McMicking, 14 Phil. 641). Note however
that in the case of exemption of the family home,
the same may be raised before the sale of the
property. (Spouses Verso/av. Court of Appeals, 31
July 2006).

Q.

Is it sufficient for the spouses to claim that the
property is their family home for it to enjoy
the benefit of exemption from execution or
forced sale?

A.

No. The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to
exemption from forced sale or execution under
Article 153 of the Family Code is a personal
privilege granted to the judgment debtor and as

,,

665
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER~REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

such it must be claimed not by the sheriff but by the
debtor himself before the sale of the property. It is
not sufficient that the person claiming exemption
merely alleges that such property is a family home.
This claim for exemption must be set and proved to
the sheriff. Failure to do so would estop the party
from later claiming the exemption. (Spouses
Verso/a v. Court of Appeals, 31 July 2006; Oliva-De
Mesa v. Acero, 16 January 2012).

Q.

May the exemptions in S13 R39 be waived by
stipulation?

A.

Prior to the filing of a case, it is submitted that the
exemptions may not be waived by stipulation
because it would run afoul of public policy. When
the case is filed however, a party may waive
the exemption.

Q.

Give examples where the law provides for
special exemptions.

A.

Q.

1)

The right to receive support under the Family
Code as well as any money or property
obtained as such support shall not be levied
upon on attachment or execution. (Article 205,
Family Code).

2)

Foreign currency deposits. (Foreign Currency
Deposit Act).

3)

Deposits rnalntained by banks with the BSP as
part of their reserve requirements. (Sec. 103,

Daisy R. Yahon (respondent) filed a petition for

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &

provisions of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9262,
otherwise known as the "Anti-Violence Against
Women and Their Children Act of 2004," against
her husband, S/Sgt. Charles A. Yahon (S/Sgt.
Yahon), an enlisted personnel of the Philippine
Army who retired in January 2006. Respondent
and S/Sgt. Yahon were married on June 8, 2003.
Subsequently the RTC issued a judgment
directing Sgt. Yahon to provide P4,000 a month
to respondent. Sgt. Charles A. Yahon was also
directed to give to respondent 50% of whatever
retirement benefits and other claims that may
be due or released to him from the government
and the said share of petitioner shall be
automatically deducted from Sgt. Yahon's
benefits and claims and be given directly to the
respondent. The AFP Finance Center demurred
from complying with the directive saying that
government pension or gratuity is exempt from
execution under S13(I) of R39. Is the AFP
Finance Center correct?
A.

No. Section 8(g) of R.A. No. 9262, being a later
enactment, should be construed as laying down an
exception to the general rule that retirement
benefits are exempt from execution. The law itself
declares that the court shall order the withholding of
a percentage of the income or salary of the
respondent by the employer, which shall be
automatically remitted directly to the woman
"[n]otwithstanding other laws to the contrary."
Section 8(g) of R.A. No. 9262 used the general
term "employer,"which includes in its coverage the
military institution, S/Sgt. Yahon's employer. Where
the law does not distinguish, courts should
not distinguish. Thus, Section 8(g) applies to a//

government.

Q.

Is there such a thing as an alias writ of
execution?

A.

No more. Under the old rules, the lifetime of a writ
of execution was 60 days from receipt by the
sheriff. Hence there was a need of an alias writ of
execution upon the expiration of the 60-day period.
This is no longer necessary under the 1997 Rules
which fixes the lifetime of a writ of execution at 5
years from the date of entry of the judgment. (S6
R39). However the sheriff shall make a report to
the court within 30 days after his receipt of the writ
and every 30 days thereafter until full satisfaction of
the judgment. (S14 R39).

Q.

What is a third-party claim?

A.

A remedy afforded to a third-party with a claim to
property levied, attached, or seized by virtue of
court order, wherein the third-party makes an
affidavit of his title or right of possession to the
property and serves the affidavit upon the court
officer and a copy upon the judgment obligee. It is
available to a third-party in cases of levy on
execution (S16 R39), attachment (S14 R57), and
replevin (S7 R60), It is also referred to as terceria.

Q.

Distinguish a third-party claim from a thirdparty complaint.

A.
1) A third-party claim is merely an affidavit, while
a third-party complaint is a pleading.

668

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

Q.

2)

A third-party claim is filed by a stranger while a
third-party complaint is filed by a party.

3)

A third-party claim does not require leave of
court, while a third-party complaint does.

Discuss briefly the procedure for making a
third-party claim under S16 R39. (ASBA)

A.
1) The third-party shall make an affidavit showing
his title to or right of possession over the
property.
2)

He shall serve the affidavit upon the levying
officer and a copy upon the judgment obligee.

3)

Thereafter the officer is not bound to keep the
property, unless the judgment obligee, on
demand of the officer, files a bond approved by
the court to indemnify the third-party claimant in
a sum not less than the value of the property
levied. The officer shall not be liable for damages
for the taking or keeping of the property to any
third-party claimant if the indemnity bond is filed.

4)

A claim for damages for the taking or keeping of
the property may be enforced by the third-party
against the bond provided he files an action
within 120 days from the filing of the bond.

Q.

When may the third-party avail of a third-party
claim?

A.

While the property is still in the possession of the
officer and before it is sold at execution.

Q.

What happens if after the filing of the third-party
claim the sheriff still proceeds with the sale of a
property even if no indemnity bond was filed?

A.

The sheriff shall be personally liable for such
damages as may be sustained by the third-party
claimant. (Bayer Phils. Inc. v. Agana, G.R. No. L38701, 8 April 1975). The third party can file an
action for reconveyance against the purchaser.

Q.

What are the remedies available to a third-party
with a claim to title or possession of property
which is levied upon by a court?

A.

The remedies of the third-party are: {TRIM)
1) Motion or application with the court for the
release of the property. This is based on the
continuing jurisdiction of a court with respect
to matters concerning the execution or
enforcement of its judgment.
2)

Third-party claim or terceria under S16 R39.

3)

An action to claim damages on the indemnity
bond if one is filed.

4)

A separate reivindicatory action to recover
possession of the property from the officer or
the purchaser at the execution sale.

Note that in third-party claim in attachment
(S14 R57) and replevin (S7 R60), the third party
has the additional remedy of intervention which is
not available in R39. {TRIMI) This is because
intervention may be availed of only before rendition
of judgment. (S2 R 19).

670

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

Q.

If a third-party claimant has availed of a thirdparty claim but is unable to recover the
property, may he still file a separate action to
recover possession?

A.

Yes. Nothing contained in S16 R39 shall prevent
the third-party claimant from vindicating his claim to
the property in a separate action. (S16 R39).

Q.

What is the proper remedy of a third party if his
third-party claim is denied by the trial court?

A.

Neither appeal (because third-party claimant is not
a party) nor certiorari is the proper remedy because
there is an adequate remedy of filing a separate
reivindicatory action. (PSALM v Maun/ad Homes, 8
Feb 2017, Peralta, J.)

Q.

In a decision in Civil Case No. 93-1000 which
became final and executory, the RTC of Manila
(Branch 21) issued a writ of execution for its
enforcement. The sheriff levied upon certain
chattels and scheduled the auction sale thereof.
However, Santamaria filed a third-party
claim with the sheriff asserting that the chattels
levied upon by the latter belong to him and not
to the judgment debtor. Because the judgment
obligee posted an indemnity bond in favor of
the third-party claimant, the sheriff refused to
release the chattels and stated that he would
proceed with the auction sale.
Hence Santamaria filed with the RTC of
Bulacan (Branch 8) an action against the
judgment obligee and the sheriff for the
recovery of the chattels and seeking to enjoin
the auction sale. The RTC of Bulacan in due
671

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

course issued a writ of preliminary injunction
enjoining the sheriff from proceeding with the
auction sale. The judgment creditor and the
sheriff filed a motion to dismiss stating that
Santamaria can no longer file a separate action
since he had already filed a third-party claim
and that the auction sale cannot be enjoined
since a court cannot interfere with the judgment
of a coordinate court. How should the motion
to dismiss be resolved? (93 Bar Q8ed).
A.

The motion to dismiss should be denied. Nothing
contained in S16 R39 shall prevent the third-party
claimant from vindicating his claim to the property in
a separate action. (S 16 R39). There is no
interference with the processes of a coordinate and
co-equal court, since the sheriff was improperly
implementing the writ of execution. (Abiera v. Court
of Appeals, 45 SCRA 314).

Q.

Enforcing a writ of execution issued by the
Pasig Regional Trial Court in a civil action, the
sheriff attached several pieces of machinery
and equipment found in defendant's place of
business. Antonio Sadalay filed with the sheriff
an affidavit of third-party claim stating that
the attached properties belong to him, not to
the defendant
a) Can Sadalay intervene in the case and ask the
Pasig RTC to resolve his third-party claim?
b)

If Sadalay decides to file a separate action
in the Regional Trial Court in Makati to
vindicate his claim, may he validly obtain a
writ of injunction from the Makati RTC to

672
J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

enJom the sale in execution of the levied
properties? (91 Bar Q9).

A.
a)

No, Sadalay may not intervene in the case and
. ask the Pasig RTC to resolve his third-party
claim.

Under S2 R19, intervention should be filed
before rendition of judgment by the trial court.
Here the Pasig RTC's judgment is already final
and executory. Hence intervention is no longer
possible.
b) Yes, Sadalay may validly obtain a writ of
injunction from the Makati RTC to enjoin the
execution sale.
Under S16 R39 nothing contained therein shall
prevent the third-party claimant from vindicating his
claim to the property in a separate action. The
Supreme Court held that there would be no
interference with the processes of a coordinate and
co-equal court, since the sheriff was improperly
implementing the writ of execution. (Abiera v. Court
of Appeals, 45 SCRA 314).
Q.

What is the remedy of the judgment obligee
against a third-party claimant who filed a
frivolous or plainly spurious claim?

A.

He may claim damages against the third-party
claimant in the same case or he can file a separate
action for damages. (S16 R39).

in the notice.

2)

Any excess property or proceeds of the sale
shall be delivered to the judgment obliger.

3)

The judgment obliger, if present at the sale,

1)

Personal property capable of manual delivery.
If the purchaser desires, the officer must
execute and deliver to him a certificate of sale.
The sale conveys to the purchaser all the rights
which the judgment obliger had in such
property as of the date of the levy on execution
or preliminary attachment. (S23 R39).

2)

Personal property not capable of manual
delivery. The officer must execute and deliver
to the purchaser a certificate of sale. The
certificate conveys to the purchaser all the
rights which the judgment obliger had in such
property as of the date of the levy on execution
or preliminary attachment. (S24 R39).

3)

Real property. The officer must give to the
purchaser a certificate of sale. The certificate
must be registered in the registry of deeds of
the place where the property is situated. This
is necessary since the one-year redemption
period commences from the registration of the
certificate of sale. (S25 R39).

Q.

Is there a right of redemption over property sold
at execution?

A.

In the case of personal property there is no right of
redemption. In the case of real property, there is a
right of redemption.

Q.

The sheriff on execution levied upon the
defendant's growing crops. Does the defendant
have a right to redeem the growing crops?

A.

No. While growing crops are classified as real
property under Article 415(2) of the Civil Code, the
right to the growing crops mobilizes the same by
anticipation. ( Sibal v. Valdez, 50 Phil. 512).

Q.

Who may redeem real property sold?

or his successor-in-

2)

The redemptioner, that is, a creditor having a
lien by virtue of an attachment, judgment, or
mortgage on the property sold subsequent to
the lien under which the property was sold.
(S27 R39).

Their right to redeem is an example of a legal
right of redemption.
Q.

Give an example of a redemptioner.

A.

P files a case against D for damages and is able to
attach D's land. The writ of attachment is annotated
on the original certificate of title but not on the

676
J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

owner's duplicate. Subsequently D mortgages the
land to X who is unaware that it had been attached
by P. If P wins and the land is sold on execution, Xis
a redemptioner, his mortgage lien being subsequent
to the lien obtained by P through attachment.
Q.

Why do the Rules of Court give the right of
redemption to a redemptioner?

A.

To enable the redemptioner to protect his lien on
the property sold at execution. This is because if no
redemption is made within the allowable period, the
redemptioner's lien on the property is extinguished
because the purchaser acquires all the rights of the
judgment obligor to the property as of the time of
the levy, free of subsequent liens (S33 R39).

Q.

Outline the periods of redemption in execution
sale of real property.

A.

1) The judgment obligor, whether exercising a first
or subsequent registration, has a period of one
year from the date of the registration of the
certificate of sale within which to redeem the
property. Once he redeems, there shall be no
further redemption. In no case may the judgment
obliger redeem beyond the one-year period.
2)

The redemptioner exercising first redemption
has the same one-year period within which
to redeem.

3)

The redemptioner exercising a subsequent
redemption has a period of 60 days after the
last redemption within which to redeem. The
redemptioner may redeem even beyond the
677

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

one-year period provided it is within 60 days
after the last redemption. (S28 & 29, R39).
Illustration
P files a case to collect P1 million in damages
from X. P is able to levy on attachment on X's land
on which there is a prior registered mortgage in
favor of A for P300,000. Afterwards X mortgages
the land to B for P200,000 and then to C for
P100,000. Judgment rendered in favor of P and
the land is sold at execution with P as the
purchaser for P1 million.
Redemption periods:
X as the judgment obliger and B and C as
redemptioners have the right to redeem. A does
not have the right of redemption since his lien is
prior to the lien under which the property was sold.
The reason why the iaw does not grant the prior
lienholder a right of redemption is that there is no
need to protect his interest as the execution sale
will not affect his lien.
The judgment obliger X, whether exercising
first or subsequent redemption, has one year from
the registration of the certificate of sale within which
to redeem. In no case will his right of redemption
go beyond the .one-year redemption period. If X
redeems, no further redemption shall be allowed
and X is restored to his estate. (S29 R39).
Redemptioners B and C, when exercising the
right of first redemption, have one year from the
registration of the certificate of sale within which to
redeem. If they are exercising a subsequent

678
J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

redemption, they have 60 days after the last
redemption within which to redeem. A redemptioner
may redeem from another redemptioner even
beyond the one-year period provided he redeems
within 60 days after the last redemption. If either B
or C redeems, the other can still redeem.

Thus in the illustration, if B (rather than P) was
the purchaser, C if he wants to redeem should
also pay B P200,000. If B was not the
purchaser, C if he wants to redeem need not
pay B P200,000. If the redemption period
lapses, B's mortgage lien is obliterated even as
to C. (S33 R39).

5)

The amount of any liens held by the last

with interest. Note: No. 5 is not applicable to
redemption by the judgment obliger since after
all the redemption does not obliterate the
subsequent liens as to the judgment obliger.
(S29 cf. S33 R39).

Thus if B will redeem, he needs to pay the
purchase price of P1 million. If C will redeem from
B, C should pay B the amount the latter paid on
redemption
plus the amount of P200,000
representing B's mortgage lien. If it is X who will
redeem from 8, X should pay 8 the amount the
latter paid on redemption but is not required to pay
B's mortgage lien of P200,000.
Q.

What proof is required of a redemptioner?

A
1)

a) A certified true copy of the judgment or final
order under which he claims the right to
redeem; or

b)

If he redeems upon a mortgage or other lien, a
memorandum of the record thereof, certified by
the register of deeds; or

c)

An original or certified true copy of any
assignment necessary to establish his claim; and

680
J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

2) An affidavit executed by him or his agent,
showing the amount then actually due on the
lien. (S30 R39).
Q.

Who is entitled to the rents, earnings, and income
of the real property pending redemption?

A.

The judgment obliger shall be entitled to the rents,
earnings, and income of the property pending
redemption until the expiration of his period
of redemption. (S32 R39). Once the one-year
redemption period has expired, the rents, earnings,
and income shall belong to the purchaser or
redemptioner as the case may be.

Q.

Upon the expiration of the right of redemption,
what rights are acquired by the purchaser or
redemptioner?

A.

Upon the expiration of the right of redemption, the
purchaser or redemptioner shall be substituted to
and acquire all the rights, title, interest and claim of
the judgment obligor to the property as of the time
of the levy. (S33 R39).

Q.

P filed with the RTC a sum of money case
against D. P won and the judgment became final
and executory in 1990. Upon motion, the land
of D was levied on execution and bought by P at
the execution sale in the same year. Upon the
expiration of the redemption period, the court
issued a writ of possession placing P in
possession. In 1996, P filed a motion to direct
the Register of Deeds to issue a new certificate
of title over the land in his name.

execution, is it enough for the executing
party P to file a motion with the court which
rendered judgment or does he need to file a
separate and original action with the
Regional Trial Court?
b)

Can such remedy be availed of even if more
than five years from the entry of judgment
had passed?

a)

P should file a separate and original action with
the RTC ..

A.

Under Section 75 of the Property Registration
Decree, upon expiration of the redemption period
for land sold on execution, the purchaser at
such sale or anyone claiming under him may
petition the court for the entry of a new certificate of
115
title to him.
Hence P should file the proper petition with
the cadastral court for the issuance of a new title in
his name.
b) Yes, such remedy can still be availed of.
Under the Law on Civil Procedure, It is settled
that execution is enforced by the fact of levy and
sale. The fact of levy and sale constitutes execution,
and not the action for the issuance of a new title.
Here, the levy and sale of the properties took
place in 1990 or well within the five-year period
provided for in S6 R39. (Padilla v. Philippine

Producers Cooperative Marketing Association, 15

Q.

P filed a sum of money case against D. During
the pendency of the case, D sold his parcel of
land covered by TCT No. 1234 in favor of X in a
notarized but unregistered deed of sale. X took
possession of the land. Subsequently the court
rendered judgment in favor of P and the same
became final and executory. The court issued a
writ of execution and levy on execution on the
land was effected by registering the writ of
execution with the register of deeds. At the
execution sale, the land was bought by P and
the certificate of sale was registered.
a) Who between P and X has a better right to
the land?
b) Would your answer be different if the land
was registered?

A.

a)

P has a better right to the land.

It is axiomatic that a registered levy on
execution prevails over a prior unregistered sale.
(Uy v. Medina, 8 August 2010; Suntay v. Keyser
Mercantile Inc., 20 December 2014; Buzon v.
Licauco, 13 Phil. 357 [1909]). In the purchase of
registered land under levy on execution, the
provisions of S33 R39 cannot overturn the provisions
of Section 51 of the Property Registration Decree
which provides that the act of registration is the
operative act to convey or affect the land insofar as
third person are concerned. (Buzon v. Licauco,
supra; see Carumba v. Court of Appeals, 31 SCRA
558 [1970]; Radiowealth Finance Co. v. Palileo,
197 SCRA 245 [1991]).
683
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

b) Yes, my answer would be different. In that
case, X would have a better right. The reason
is that the purchaser of unregistered land at a
sheriff's execution sale steps into the shoes of
the judgment obligor and merely acquires the
latter's interest in the property sold as of the
time the property was levied upon pursuant to
S33 R39.
Here at the time of the levy, the judgment
obligor D no longer had any interest in the land
since he had sold and delivered the same to X.
(Carumba v. Court of Appeals, supra).
Q.

P filed a sum of money case against D. During
the pendency of the case, D sold his parcel of
land covered by TCT No. 1234 in favor of X in a
notarized but unregistered deed of absolute sale.
X took possession of the land. Subsequently the
court rendered judgment in favor of P and the
same became finai and executory. The court
issued a writ of execution and levy on execution
on the land was effected by registering the writ
of execution with the register of deeds. X then
registered the deed of absolute sale in his favor.
At the execution sale, the land was bought by P
and after the expiration of the redemption
period, the certificate of sale in P's favor was
registered. Who between P and X has a better
right to the land?

A.

P has a better right to the land.
Under S33 R39, upon the expiration of the
right of redemption, the purchaser or redemptioner
shall be substituted to and acquire all the rights,
title, interest and claim of the judgment obligor to
684

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

the property as of the time of the levy. (S33 R39).
In other words, the purchaser's right to the property
retroacts to the date of the levy. (1 FLORENZ D.
th
REGALADO 300 [5 rev. ed.]).
At the time of the levy, the sale in favor of X
was not yet registered and thus did not affect or
convey the land insofar as third persons are
concerned. (Sec. 51, Property Registration Decree).
Hence insofar as P was concerned, D was still
the owner of the land and thus P acquired the
rights of D.
Q.

In extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate
mortgages under Act No. 3135, is the issuance_,.
of a writ of possession ministerial upon the
court after the foreclosure sale and during the
red~n,ption period?

A.

Yes. The court may issue the order for a writ of
possession upon the mere filing of an ex parte
116
motion and the approval of the corresponding bond.

Q.

Is there an exception to the foregoing rule?

A.

Yes. Under S33 R39, which is made applicable to
extrajudicial foreclosures of real estate mortgages,
the possession of the property shall be given to the
purchaser or last redemptioner unless a third party is
actually holding the property in a capacity adverse to
the judgment obligor. Thus, the court's obligation to
issue an ex parte writ of possession in favor of the
purchaser in an extrajudicial foreclosure sale ceases

116
While S5(b) R15 requires that all motions, including a motion for the
issuance of a writ of possession, must be served on the other party, it is submitted
that such service is not required in an ex parte motion for writ of possession under
Section 7 of Act No. 3135 (extrajudicial foreclosure of REM) since the right to file
the motion ex parte is a substantive right provided for by law.

to be ministerial when there is a third party in
possession of the property claiming a right adverse
to that of the judgment debtor/mortgagor. (Cabling v.
Lumapas, 18 June 2014).
Q.

Petitioner was the highest bidder in an
extrajudicial foreclosure sale over a real property.
After the redemption period, the final deed of sale
was issued by the sheriff and a new certificate of
title was issued in the name of Petitioner. The
Petitioner filed an application for issuance of a
writ of possession. The Respondent filed an
opposition on the ground that that the property
had previously been sold to her by Aida lbabao,
the property's registered owner and the judgment
debtor/mortgagor in the extrajudicial foreclosure
sale, pursuant to a Deed of Conditional Sale. It
appears from the records that no deed of
absolute sale over the subject property has been
executed in the Respondent's favor. The trial
court granted the opposition and denied the
application for issuance of a writ of possession.
The trial court stated that its obligation to issue a
writ of possession ceases to be ministerial once it
appears that there Is a third party in possession
of the property claiming a right adverse to that
of the debtor/mortgagor. Did the trial court
rule correctly?

A.

No. We emphasize that the exception provided
under S33 R39 contemplates a situation in which a
third party holds the property by adverse title or
right, such as that of a co-owner, tenant or
usufructuary, who possesses the property in his
own righti and is not merely the successor or
transferee of the right of possession of another
co-owner or the owner of the property. Here, the

686
J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

respondent cannot be said to possess the subject
property by adverse title or right as her possession
is merely premised on the alleged conditional sale
of the property to her by the judgment debtor/
mortgagor. The execution of a contract of
conditional sale does not immediately transfer title
to the property to be sold from seller to buyer. In
such contract, ownership or title to the property is
retained by the seller until the fulfillment of a
positive suspensive condition which is normally the
payment of the purchase price in the manner
agreed upon. (Cabling v. Lumapas, 18 June 2014).
Q.

D borrowed PS00,000 from P with X acting as
the surety. D did not pay on maturity so P sued
D and X. Judgment rendered in favor of P as
against D and X for PS00,000. The bank account
of X was garnished in the amount of PS00,000.
X demanded indemnification from D but the
latter did not pay X. D argued that X's claim for
indemnification was waived since he did not
raise it as a cross-claim pursuant to 52 R9. Is
D's argument meritorious?

A.

No. Under S35 R39, when a judgment is upon an
obligation of one of the parties as security for
another, and the surety pays the amount or any part
thereof, either by sale of his property or before sale,
he may compel repayment from the principal. This is
a specific provision which prevails over S2 R9.

Q.

What are the remedies available to the judgment
obligee in aid of execution? (EIRE)

A.

obligor when
1) Examination of judgment
judgment returned unsatisfied. In case the
687
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

judgment is returned unsatisfied, the judgment
obligee is entitled to an order from the court
which rendered the judgment, requiring the
judgment obligor to appear and be examined
concerning his property and income and
proceedings may be had for the application of
the property and income of the judgment
obligor towards the satisfaction of the
judgment. (S36 R39).
2)

Examination of ob/igor of judgment obligor.
The court may by order require require the
obligor of the judgment obligor to appear before
the court or commissioner appointed by it for
examination. The person indebted to the
judgment obligor may pay to the sheriff holding
the writ of execution the amount of his debt and
this shall constitute a sufficient discharge of the
debt. (S37 &39 R39).

3)

Order for application of property and income to
satisfaction of judgment. If upon investigation of
his current income and expenses, it appears
that the earnings of the judgment obligor for his
personal services are more than necessary for
the support of his family, the court may order
that he pay the judgment in fixed monthly
installments, and upon his failure to pay any
such installment when due without good excuse,
may punish him for contempt. (S40 R39).

4)

Appointment of receiver. The court may appoint
a receiver of the property of the judgment
obligor; and it may also forbid a transfer or
other disposition of, or any interference with,
the property of the judgment obligor not exempt
from execution. (S41 R39).

A.

No. Under S36 R39, no judgment obliger shall be
required to appear before a court or commissioner
outside the province or city in which such obliger

court to appoint a commissioner and for the order
to specify the time and place in Pasay City where

the royalties it paid to De Guzman. During the
execution stage, Esguerra filed a motion for the
examination of Holcim pursuant to S37 R39.
Assuming that during the hearing of the motion,
Holcim denies any indebtedness to De Guzman,
may the trial court, upon proof of Holcim's debt
to De Guzman, order Holcim to pay such
debt to Esguerra?
A.

No. Pursuant to S43 R39, in the examination of a
person, corporation, or other juridical entity who has
the property of such judgment obliger or is indebted to
him (S37 R39), and such person, corporation, or
juridical entity denies the indebtedness, the court
may only authorize the judgment obligee to institute
an action against such person or corporation for the
recovery of such interest or debt. Nothing in the Rules
gives the court the authority to order such person or
corporation to pay the judgment obligee and the court
exceeds its jurisdiction if it orders the person who
denies the indebtedness to pay the same. (Esguerra
v. Holcim Phils. Inc., 2 September 2013, Reyes, J.).

Q.

Is the principal debtor bound by a judgment
against the surety even if he is not impleaded
in the suit?

A.

Yes, the principal debtor is bound from the time that
he has notice of the action or proceeding, and an
opportunity at the surety's request to join in
the defense.

Q.

What do you understand by res judicata?

A.

Res judicata literally means "a thing decided." In
fine, it means that once a matter has been decided
with finality by a court, the matter is conclusive as

690

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

between the parties to the case and can no longer
be relitigated.
Res judicata embraces two concepts: (1) "bar
by prior judgment," as provided for in S47(a) & (b)
R39; and (2) "conclusiveness of judgment" (also
known as "collateral estoppel" or "auter action
pendant") as provided for in S47(c) R39. (Rasdas
v. Estenor, G.R. No. 157605, 13 December 2005).
Q.

Give the rules on "bar by prior judgment" and
on "conclusiveness of judgment."

A.

Bar by prior judgment:
a)

In case of a judgment or final order: (SPC)
1) Against a specific thing,
2)

Or in respect to the probate of a will or the
administration of the estate of a deceased
person, or

3)

In respect to the personal, political, or legal
condition or status of a particular person or
his relationship to another, the judgment or
final order is conclusive upon: (TWAC)
The title to the thing,
The will or administration, or
The condition, status or relationship of the
person.

However the probate of a will or granting of
letters of administration shall only be prima facie
evidence of the death of the testator or intestate.
(S47[a] R39).

691
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

b)

In other cases, the judgment or final order is,
with respect to (1) the matter directly adjudged
or as to (2) any other matter that could have
been raised in relation thereto, conclusive
between the parties and their successors-ininterest by title subsequent to the commencemen! ___
of the action or special proceeding, litigating for
the same thing and under the same title and in
the same capacity. (S47[b] R39)

Conclusiveness of judgment:
c)

Q.

In any other litigation between the same parties
or their successors in interest, that only is
deemed to have been adjudged in a former
judgment or final order which appears upon its
face to have been so adjudged, or which was
actually and necessarily included therein or
necessary thereto (anin). (S47[c] R39). In
conclusiveness of judgment, the parties in both
actions are the same but the causes of action
are different. Hence the former judgment or final
order is conclusive only in respect as to the
matters actually raised and adjudged therein.

Distinguish "bar by prior judgment"
"conclusiveness of judgment."

from

A.
1)

AS TO IDENTITY OF CAUSES OF ACTION.
In bar by prior judgment, there is identity of
causes of action between the prior and the
subsequent case, while in conclusiveness of
judgment, the causes of action are different.

2)

AS TO CONCLUSIVENESS. In bar by prior
judgment, the prior case is conclusive not only

692

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

as to the matters directly adjudged but also to
any other matter that could have been raised in
relation thereto, while in conclusiveness of
judgment, the prior case is conclusive only in
respect of the matters actually raised and
adjudged in the prior case.
3) AS TO PRECLUSIVE EFFECT. Bar by prior
judgment bars the relitigation of a case, while
conclusiveness of judgment bars only the
relitigation of an issue.
4)

Q.

AS TO GROUND FOR MOTION TO DISMISS.
Bar by prior judgment is a ground for a motion
to dismiss, while conclusiveness of judgment is
not.

What are the requisites of res judicata (bar by
prior judgment)?

A.

1) The prior judgment or order must be final and
executory or final and unappealable.
2)

It must be rendered by a court having jurisdiction
over the subject matter and the parties.

3) The prior judgment or order must be on the
merits, that is, it was rendered after a
consideration of the evidence or stipulations
submitted by the parties at the trial of the case.
A dismissal order which even if not on the
merits is a dismissal with prejudice or has the
effect of an adjudication on the merits
constitutes res judicata. (E.g., S3 R17, SS R16,
the two-dismissal rule under S1 R17).

There is identity of subject matter, parties, and

action and the subsequent action.

Petitioner filed with the CFI a complaint against
the Private Respondent in 1969 for quieting of
title with damages, wherein the former seeks to
be declared the owner of the subject land. In
1970, the Private Respondent dispossessed
Petitioner of the land in question and stayed
there until January 1978. The Private Respondent
won in the CFI but the CA reversed and
declared the Petitioner as the owner of the
subject land and ordered the Private Respondent
to pay Petitioner P56.40 as the latter's share in
the proceeds of the sale of the copra from the
coconuts harvested in the land.
The decision became final and executory in
2 February 1978. In 6 February 1978, Petitioner
filed a second case with the CFI against Private
Respondent seeking to recover from the latter
the incomes from the subject land from 1970 up
to January 1978 when possession of the land
was delivered to the Petitioner. Private Respondent
filed a motion to dismiss the second case on
the ground of res judicata. The Petitioner
contended that there was no res judicata since
the issue or matter regarding the income from
the land was not raised in the quieting of title
case. Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

A.

Yes. There is only one cause of action in the first and
second cases, viz., the continuing refusal by the
Private Respondent to recognize Petitioner's
ownership over the property. (See Jalandoni v.
Martin-Guanzon, 102 Phil. 859). Petitioner should
694

J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

have raised the claim for income in a supplemental
pleading. Under S47(b) R39, a judgment or final order
is conclusive between the parties "with respect to the
matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that
could have been raised in relation thereto." (Bayang
v. Court of Appeals, 148 SCRA 91 ).
Q.

For purposes of res judicata, what is meant by
identity of parties?

A.

For purposes of res judicata, only substantial identity
of parties is required and not absolute identity. There
is substantial identity of parties when there is
community of interest between a party in the first
case and a party in the second case even if the latter
was not impleaded in the first case. In other words,
privity or a shared identity of interest is sufficient to
invoke application of the principle of res judicata.
Thus it was held that there was substantial
identity of parties where the party in the second
case was invoking a right to ownership based on
heirship which was also invoked by his brother in a
first action for recovery of ownership that had been
decided against the brother. (/got v. Valenzuela, 5
December 2018).

Q.

Rolando filed a petition for declaration of the
nullity of his marriage to Carmela because of
the alleged psychological incapacity of the
latter. After trial, the court rendered judgment
dismissing the petition on the ground that
Rolando failed to prove the psychological
incapacity of his wife. The judgment having
become final, Rolando filed another petition,
this time on the ground that his marriage to
Carmela had been celebrated without a license.

Is the second action barred by the judgment in
the first? Why? (02 Bar Q6b).
A.

Yes. Under S47{b) R39, a judgment is conclusive
not only with respect to the matter directly adjudged
but also as to any other matter that could have
been raised in relation thereto.
Here the ground of lack of license could have
been raised in the first petition for declaration of
nullity of marriage. Not having been so raised, the
judgment of the first case is already conclusive as
to the issue of the marriage license. (Ma/lion v.
Alcantara, G.R. No. 141528, 31 October 2006). 118

Q.

In 1996, respondents spouses Eliezer and Leila
Adlawan obtained a P3,669,685.00 loan from
petitioner Central Visayas Finance Corporation
covered by a promissory note and a chattel
mortgage over a Komatsu Highway Dump Truck.
Respondents failed to pay the loan, prompting
petitioner to file an action against respondents for
replevin before the Cebu Regional Trial Court,
docketed as Civil Case No. 22294 (replevin case).
The principal relief sought was for the recovery of
the possession of the dump truck, which was
used as a collateral in the mortgage contract
between the parties. In the event that delivery
thereof cannot be effected, petitioner stated an
alternative prayer, that is, for the respondents
to pay the amount of P2,604,604.97 which
represented their outstanding obligation.

118
The answer of the UP Law Center was that the second petition is not
barred because it involved a different cause of action from the first. However in
the light of the subsequent ruling in Ma/lion, the revision of the answer is in
order. This is an interesting case of a bar question anticipating future
jurisprudence.

Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

In its 1999 decision, the trial court ruled in
petitioner's favor and respondents were
ordered to deliver possession of the dump truck
to petitioner. Petitioner then extrajudicially
foreclosed on the chattel mortgage and caused
the sale at public auction of the dump truck,
which was then sold to it as the highest bidder
for P500,000.00.
In 2000, petitioner commenced a second
case before the RTC - Civil Case No. 24841 - this
time for collection of sum of money and/or
deficiency judgment relative to respondents'
supposed unpaid balance on their loan, which
petitioner claimed to be at Php2,104,604.97 less the value of dump truck - with damages
(deficiency case).
Was the second action barred by res
judicata?
A.

Yes. Under S47(b) R39, a judgment or final order is
conclusive not only with respect to the matter
directly adjudged but also to any other matter that
could have been raised in relation thereto.
By failing to seek a deficiency judgment in the
replevin case after its case for recovery of
possession was resolved, petitioner is barred from
instituting another action for such deficiency.
Pursuant to S4 ?(b) R39, on the effect of judgments
or final orders, the judgment in the replevin case is,
with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to
any other matter that could have been raised in
relation thereto, conclusive between the petitioner
and respondents.

Petitioner's argument that the replevin case
and the deficiency case involved different causes of
action is without merit. Petitioner ignores the fact
that it prayed in the replevin case that in the event
manual delivery of the vehicle could not be
effected, the court render judgment in its favor by
ordering
respondents to pay P2,604,604.97.
Following S47(b) R39, petitioner's second complaint
is barred by res judicata. (Central Visayas Finance

Q.

D borrowed P1,000,000 from P evidenced by a
promissory note, payable in 20 equal monthly
installments of P50,000 each. There is no
acceleration clause in the note. D paid the first 6
installments but did not pay the ih to 11th
installments. P sued D to recover the said
installments. D in his answer raised the defense
that his signature to the note was forged. The court
decided in favor of P, finding that D's signaturewas
genuine. The judgment became final and executory.
Subsequently P filed another case against
D to collect the 16th to 20th installments.
a)

Can D in the second case raise the defense
that his signature was forged?

b)

Can Din the second case raise the defense
that he was intimidated into signing
the note?

119
The holding that the replevin case and the deficiency case involve the
same cause of action is arguable. Petitioner's complaint joined two causes of
action in the alternative: recovery of possession of the dump truck (replevin) and
collection of loan in case the dump truck could not be recovered. The complaint
did not involve extrajudicial foreclosure which is a distinct proceeding and in
which the mortgagee has the right to run after the mortgagor for any deficiency.
The fact that collection was stated as an alternative remedy does not bar resort
to extrajudicial foreclosure and any resultant deficiency action.

698

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

A.
a)

No more. Although the causes of action are
different, the parties are the same, bringing into
fore the application of the rule on conclusiveness
of judgment. Since the issue regarding the
forgery was directly adjudged in the first case,
such a finding is already conclusive as between
the parties.

b) Yes. The issue on vitiated consent was not.,.
directly adjudged in the first case. Hence it can
still be raised in the second case. Bar by prior
judgment does not apply since the causes of
action in the first and second case are different.
Q.

Husband filed an action for the probate of his
deceased wife's will. The probate court issued
an order admitting the will to probate. Two
years later, a criminal complaint for forgery of
the will was brought against the husband.
Should the complaint be dismissed?

A.

Yes. The order admitting the will to probate is
conclusive as to its authenticity and due execution.
(Mercado v. Santos, 66 Phil. 215). Under S47(a)
R39 in case of a judgment or final order in respect
to the probate of a will, the judgment or final order
is conclusive upon the will. Likewise S1 R75
provides that subject to the right of appeal, the
allowance of a will shall be conclusive as to its
due execution.

Q.

Respondents filed an action for annulment of
real estate mortgage against the Petitioners.
The RTC granted the annulment but held the
Respondents liable to the Petitioner for the,
payment of P1 million. In its judgment, the RTC

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

stated that the market value of the Respondent's
family home did not exceed P300,000, the
statutory limit for exemption from execution.
The RTC judgment became final and executory.
During the execution, may the Petitioners
introduce evidence that the market value of the
Respondents' family home exceeded P300,000
in order to levy on the family home?
A.

No. Since the RTC in its judgment had already
determined that the market value of the property
did not exceed P300,000, to receive evidence to
the contrary during the execution state would
violate res judicata. (Eulogio v. Bell, 8 July 2015,
Sereno, CJ.)

Q.

Does the rule of conclusiveness of judgment
apply also to criminal cases?

A.

Yes. (Ligtas v. People, 17 August 2015, Leanen, J.).

Q.

Ligtas filed a complaint for declaration of tenancy
relationship with the Department of Agrarian
Reform Adjudication Board against Pacate.
Pacate then filed a complaint for theft against
Ligtas for harvesting without her consent the
abaca hemp in her plantation. Subsequently the
DARAB rendered a decision finding that Ligtas
was a bona fide tenant of Pacate. The DARAS
decision was not appealed by the parties. May the
RTC convict Ligtas of theft?

A.

No.Under the principle of conclusiveness of
judgment, the final determination by the DARAB
that Ligtas was a bona fide tenant is conclusive and
binding upon the criminal court. Hence Ligtas could
not be convicted of theft because as a tenant he
700

has the right to harvest the abaca hemp. (Ligtas v.

Q.

Nasugatan sued Sagasa for injuries he suffered
when Sagasa drove his car recklessly and
bumped into Nasugatan. Sagasa confessed
judgment and was adjudged to pay PS,000.00.
Nasugatan became blind because of the injuries
he sustained in the accident. He filed another
suit against Sagasa, this time for P100,000.00.
May Sagasa plead the filing of the first
complaint in abatement of the second suit and
contend that the judgment on the merits in the
first case constitutes a bar in the second?
Explain. (86 Bar Q1).

A

Yes, Sagasa may plead that the judgment in the
first case constitutes a bar in the second.
Under S4 R2, if two suits are instituted on the
basis of the same cause of action, a judgment upon
the merits in any one is available as a ground for
the dismissal of the other.
Here the second suit involves the same cause
of action: Sagasa's reckless driving which violated
the right of Nasugatan. In other words Nasugatan's
blindness resulted from the same reckless act of
Sagasa. Hence the second suit is barred by the
judgment in the first suit.
Alternative Answer:
No, Sagasa may not plead that the judgment in
the first case constitutes a bar in the second.
Under S47(b) R39, a judgment in an action in
personam is conclusive between the parties and
701

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

their successors-in-interest as to the matter directly
adjudged or as to any other matter that could have
been raised in relation thereto.
Here the blindness could not have been raised
in the first case. Hence the second suit for
damages arising from the blindness is not barred
by the judgment in the first suit.

Note: I favor the first answer. My objection to
the alternative answer is based on my opinion that
competent medical diagnosis could have detected
the possibility that the injuries would result in
blindness. In other words the possibility of blindness
could have been raised in the first case. Hence when
Nasugatan entered into the compromise, he is
thereby deemed to have waived his claim for
damages from the blindness.

summary judgment which was granted by the
trial court. Defendants appealed to the CA. The
Plaintiff filed a motion for execution pending
appeal with the CFI which was granted.
Defendants then filed with the CA a special civil
action for certiorari and prohibition wherein
they alleged that the trial court acted with grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of or
excess of jurisdiction
when it granted the
motion for summary judgment. The CA dismissed
the petition for certiorari and prohibition ruling
that the trial court acted with sound discretion
in granting the motion for summary judgment.
In the appeal before the CA, the Defendants
raised as an error the grant by the trial court of
the motion for summary judgment. May the
Defendants still raise as error the grant by the
trial court of the summary judgment?
A.

No more. The ruling on the petition for certiorari and
prohibition that the trial court acted with sound
discretion in rendering summary judgment constitutes
the "law of the case" and can no longer be
reviewed anew on appeal. (Litton Mills, Inc. v.
Galleon Trader, Inc., 163 SCRA 489).

E appealed to th~ CA which reversed the RTC's
decision and held that E was improperly declared
in default.
a)

A.

Was the CA's reversal proper?

No. E's Petition for Certiorari on the denial of his
motion for reconsideration has already been
dismissed with finality by the Court of Appeals. E
did not appeal said ruling of the Court of Appeals.
The dismissal of the Petition for Certiorari assailing
the denial of respondent E's Motion constitutes a
bar to the retrial of the same issue of default under
the doctrine of the law of the case.
b) E counters that the doctrine of the law of the
case is not applicable, inasmuch as a Petition
for Certiorari is not an appeal. E argues that the
Doctrine of the Law of the Case applies only
when the appellate court renders a decision on
the merits, and not when such appeal was
denied due to technicalities. How would you
refute E's argument.

A.

There is no substantial distinction between an
appeal and certiorari when it comes to the doctrine
of the law of the case since the doctrine is founded
on the policy of ending litigation. Likewise to say
that the doctrine of the law of the case applies only
when the appellate court renders a decision on the
merits would be putting premium on a party's
negligence of losing the previous appeal. (Banco

J9JC9B0M

Rule 39

(Note: It is submitted that the "law of the case"
is not applicable since the petition for certiorari and
prohibition does not constitute a first appeal, the
same being an original action. Furthermore in a
certiorari proceeding, the issue that may be
properly resolved by the court is whether an order
was issued with grave abuse of discretion, not
whether the order was erroneous or not.)
Q.

Does a minute resolution constitute a binding
precedent?

A.

No. A minute resolution is not a binding precedent.
Unlike decisions, minute resolutions are not
published in the Philippine Reports nor signed-by
the members of the Court and certified by the Chief
Justice. (Deutsche Bank AG Manila Branch v.
Commissioner of Internal Revenue, G.R. No.
188550, 19 August 2013).

Q.

What are the tests to be applied in resolving a
situation which involves two or more conflicting
decisions which are final and executory?

A.

The two tests are: (1) to ask which judgment came
first, and (2) to ask which judgment was rendered
by a court of last resort. The earlier judgment or the
judgment rendered by a court of last resort would
be the one which would prevail. (Navarra v.
Liongson, 10 April 2016). Thus an earlier judgment
of a CA division which held that there was a valid
substitution prevails over a later judgment of
another CA division which held that the substitution
was invalid. (ld.). 121

Q.

What is the effect of a foreign judgment or
final order?

A.

The effect of a foreign judgment or final order of a
foreign tribunal having jurisdiction to render the
judgment or final order is as follows:
a)

In case of a judgment or final order upon a
specific thing, the judgment or final order is
conclusive upon the title to the thing; and

b)

In case of a judgment or final order against a
person, the judgment or final order is
presumptive evidence of a right as between the
parties and their successors in interest by a
subsequent title. (S48 R39).

Q.

May a foreign judgment or final order be repelled?

A.

Yes by evidence of: (1) want of jurisdiction, (2)
want of notice to the party, (3) collusion, (4) fraud,
or (5) clear mistake of lav,1or fact. (S48 R39). Take
note that both the foreign judgment under S48(a)
and S48(b) may be so repelled, unlike in the 1964
rules wherein it was only the S48(a) judgment
which may be repelled.

Q.

What does "want of jurisdiction" in S48 R39
mean? By whose standard should the presence
of jurisdiction be judged?

A.

Want of jurisdiction refers to either subject-matter
jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction. The presence of
jurisdiction should be judged not only in accordance
with the foreign law but also in accordance with the
Philippine law. Hence a judgment rendered

court, including the SC; otherwise we would be violating the principle of
immutability of final judgments.

in a foreign court which recognizes summons by

recognition in the Philippines. ( See JOVITO
SALONGA, PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW 551
[1995 ed.]).
Q.

What does "fraud" in S48 R39 mean?

A.

The fraud referred to in S48 R39 has the same
meaning as "fraud" in S1 (a) R37, that is, it refers to
extrinsic fraud or deception or trickerty by which the
aggrieved party was prevented from having trial or
presenting his case before the court.

Q.

Private Respondent Filipina filed with the
Regional Trial Court of Makati a petition for
declaration of nullity of marriage with her
Petitioner husband, a German citizen. During
the pendency of the case, the Petitioner
obtained a divorce decree from the Court of
First Instance of Hamburg, Germany, based on
the German Civil Code provision that if a couple
have lived separately for more than 3 years,
their marriage is deemed irrefutably dissolved.
The decree also awarded parental custody
of the couple's two children to the Petitioner.
The Petitioner thus filed a motion to dismiss the
nullity suit on the ground that there was already
a divorce decree issued by the German court.
The RTC dismissed the Petition, stating in effect
that the foreign divorce decree should
be recognized.

709
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

On Private Respondent's motion for partial
reconsideration, the RTC partially set aside its
dismissal order and reinstated the case for the
purpose of determining the issue of parental
custody over the two children of the Private
Respondent and the Petitioner. May the RTC take
cognizance of the issue of parental custody after
it had recognized the divorce decree?
A.

Yes. While divorce decrees obtained abroad by
foreigners are recognized in our jurisdiction, the
other effects provided by the decree, like that of
custody, should not be automatically recognized.
They can be repelled by a showing that there was
want of jurisdiction, want of notice to the party,
collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of law or fact.
(S48 R39).

It is essential that there should be an
opportunity to challenge the foreign judgment in
order for the couri in ihis jurisdiciion io properly
determine its efficacy.
There was no showing that private respondent
Filipina was given the opportunity to challenge the
judgment of the German court so as to provide
basis for declaring the judgment as res judicata
with regard to the rights of petitioner German to
have parental custody over their two children. The
proceedings in the German court were summary.
As to what was the extent of private respondent's
participation in the proceedings in the German
court, the records remain unclear. The divorce
decree itself states that neither has private
respondent commented on the proceedings nor has
she given her opinion to the social services office.
710
J9JC9B0M

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

Unlike petitioner who was represented by two
lawyers, the private respondent had no counsel to
assist her in the proceedings before the German
court. More importantly the divorce judgment was
issued to petitioner by virtue of the German Civil
Code provision that when a couple have lived
separately for 3 years, the marriage is deemed
irrefutably dissolved. The divorce decree did not
state who the offending spouse was. In the absence
of any showing that Private Respondent was unfit
to take custody of her children, the RTC was
correct in setting the issue of parental custody for
hearing. (Roehr v. Rodriguez, G.R. No. 142820, 20
June 2003).
Q.

May a foreign judgment which is final be
forthwith enforced in the Philippines by a
motion for execution?

A.

No. A petition for the recognition and enforcement
of the foreign judgment must first be filed in the
Philippines. However where the foreign judgment
does not grant any affirmative relief, as when it
merely dismisses a case or decrees a divorce, a
petition for recognition alone is proper. (JOVITO
SALONGA, PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW 53536 [1995 ed.]).

Q.

Petitioner Fujiki is a Japanese national who
married respondent Maria Paz Marinay in the
Philippines in 2004. The marriage did not sit
well with petitioner's parents. Thus, Fujiki could
not bring his wife to Japan where he resides.
Eventually, they lost contact with each other. In
2008, Marinay met another Japanese, Maekara.
Without the first marriage being dissolved,

Marinay and Maekara were married in 2008 in
Quezon City, Philippines. Maekara brought
Marinay to Japan. However, Marinay allegedly
suffered physical abuse from Maekara. She left
Maekara and started to contact Fujiki. Fujiki and
Marinay met in Japan and they were able to
reestablish their relationship. In 2010, Fujiki
helped Marinay obtain a judgment from a family
court in Japan which declared the marriage
between Marinay and Maekara void on the
ground of bigamy. In 2011, Fujiki filed a petition
in the RTC of Pasay City entitled: "Judicial
Recognition of Foreign Judgment (or Decree of
Absolute Nullity of Marriage)." Fujiki prayed that
(1) the Japanese Family Court judgment be
recognized; (2) that the bigamous marriage
between Marinay and Maekara be declared void
ab initio; and (3) for the RTC to direct the LCR of
Quezon City to annotate the Japanese Family
Court judgment on the Certificate of Marriage
between Marinay and Maekara and to endorse
such annotation to the Office of the Administrator
and Civil Registrar General in the NSO.
A few days after the filing of the petition,
the RTC immediately issued an Order dismissing
the petition based on Braza v. The City Civil
Registrar of Himamay/an City, Negros Occidental
(607 SCRA 638 [2009]) wherein the SC ruled that

RTC's dismissal of the petition correct?

Rule 39
Execution, Satisfaction &
Effect Of Judgments

A.

Since the recognition of a foreign judgment only
requires proof of fact of the judgment, it may be
made in a special proceeding for cancellation or
correction of entries in the civil registry under Rule
108 of the Rules of Court. In Corpuz v. Sta. Tomas Ji
(628 SCRA 266 [20101) this Court declared that
"[t]he recognition of the foreign divorce decree may
be made in a R108 proceeding itself, as the object
of special proceedings (such as that in Rule 108 of
the Rules of Court) is precisely to establish the
status or right of a party or a particular fact."
Braza is not applicable because Braza does
not involve the recognition of a foreign judgment
nullifying a bigamous marriage where one of the
parties is a citizen of the foreign country. To be sure,
a petition for correction or cancellation of an entry
in the civil registry cannot substitute for an action to
invalidate a marriage. A direct action is necessary
to prevent circumvention of the substantive and
procedural safeguards of marriage under the
Family Code, However, this rule does not apply in a
petition for correction or cancellation of a civil
registry entry based on the recognition of a foreign
judgment annulling a marriage where one of the
parties is a citizen of the foreign country. There is
no circumvention of the substantive and procedural
safeguards of marriage under Philippine law. A
recognition of a foreign judgment is not an action to
nullify a marriage. It is an action for Philippine
courts to recognize the effectivity of a foreign.,
judgment, which presupposes a case which was
already tried and decided under foreign law. (Fujiki
v. Marinay, 20 June 2013).

Q.

Yi and Chun filed an action for sum of money
and damages against Mercantile Insurance
Company (MIC) before the Superior Court of
California, U.S.A. Judgment was rendered in
favor of the plaintiffs. As Yi sought to enforce
the judgement in the Philippines, she filed an
action for recognition and enforcement of the
judgment before the RTC. MIC challenges the
validity of the foreign judgment on the ground
that there was want of notice to it since there
was no proper service of summons in the
California case, the service having been effected
only through mail. Is MIC's challenge meritorious?

A.

No. Matters of remedy and procedure such as
those relating to the service of process upon a
defendant are governed by the lex tori or the
internal law of the forum. In this case, Atty. Dyer,
member of the bar of the State of California for
more than 30 years, testified as to the applicable
law related to summons. In detail, he stated the
exact pertinent provision under the California Code
of Civil Procedure which allows service of summons
by mail. (Mercantile Insurance Co. v. Yi, 18 March
2019, Reyes, J.).

Q.

Under Article 1144 of the New Civil Code, an
action upon a judgment must be brought within
10 years from the time the right of action
accrues. Is this provision applicable to an
action filed in the Philippines to enforce a
foreign judgment? (05 Bar Q1a)

A.

Yes. Article 1144 does not distinguish between a
domestic or a foreign judgment. The foreign judgment
must not be barred by prescription under the law of
the state of rendition or under Article 1144.

however be enforced under Rule 12 of the Special
Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution. The
petition to recognize or enforce the arbitral award may
be filed with the RTC: (a) where the arbitration
proceedings were conducted; (b) where any of the

RULE 40. APPEALS FROM THE
MUNICIPAL TRIAL COURTS TO THE
REGIONAL TRIAL COURTS
Q.

Define appeal.

A.

Appeal is a proceeding by which a party seeks from
a higher court the review of a judgment or final
order of a lower court on the ground that the
judgment or final order is against the evidence
or the law.

Q.

Where, when, and how is an appeal taken from
a judgment or final order of the MTC?

A.

Where to appeal:
An appeal from a judgment or final order of a
Municipal Trial Court may be taken to the Regional
Trial Court exercising jurisdiction over the area to
which the former pertains.
When to appeal:
An appeal may be taken within 15 days after
notice to the appellant of the judgment or final order
appealed from. Where a record on appeal is
required, the appeal is taken within 30 days after
notice of the judgment or final order.
The period of appeal shall be interrupted by
a timely motion for new trial or reconsideration. (S2
& 3 R40).
Where a motion for reconsideration or new trial
is filed and then denied, the movant has a fresh
period of '15 days to file the notice of appeal,
counted from receipt of the order denying the motion

To The Regional Trial Courts

for reconsideration or new trial. (Neypes v. Court of
Appeals, G.R. 141524, 14 September 2005).
How to appeal:
The appeal is taken by filing a notice of appeal
with the court that rendered the judgment or final
order appealed from. Where a record on appeal is
required, the appellant shall file a notice of appeal
and a record on appeal within 30 days after notice
of the judgment or final order.
Q.

Are appeal bonds required for the taking of
appeals?

A.

No. The prior requirement of appeal bonds under
S3 R40 and S5 R41 was removed by the Interim
Rules. Under the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure,
appeal bonds are no longer provided for therein.
An exception is found under Section 46 of the
Alternative Dispute Resolution Act (R.A. No. 9285)
which provides that the losing party who appeals to
the CA from the judgment of the court confirming
the arbitral award shall be required by the appellate
court to post counterbond executed in favor of the
prevailing party equal to the amount of the award.

Q.

Give the form and contents of a notice of
appeal.

A.

The notice of appeal shall indicate the parties to the
appeal, the judgment or final order or part thereof
appealed from, and state the material dates
showing the timeliness of the appeal. Copy of the
notice of appeal shall be served on the adverse
party. (S2 & 3 R40).

Q.

D was convicted by the Regional Trial Court of
the crime of estafa and sentenced to prision
mayor. He wants to appeal the judgment of
conviction on a pure question of law. To what
court should he take his appeal?

A.

To the Court of Appeals. The provision allowing direct
appeal to the Supreme Court on pure question/s of
law does not apply to a judgment of conviction in a
criminal case. What governs here is Section 3 of Rule
122. (Tan v. People, 381 SCRA 75).

Q.

P filed with the MTC an application for original
registration of a parcel of land over which there
was no controversy or opposition. After trial,
the MTC rendered a decision denying the
application. If P wants to appeal the MTC
decision, to what court shall he take his appeal
and what provisions govern his appeal?

A.

P should take his appeal to the Court of Appeals in
accordance with the provisions of R41. Under
Section 34 of B.P. Big. 129 on the delegated
jurisdiction of the MTC in cadastral and land
registration cases, it is provided that the decision of
the MTC shall be appealable in the same manner
as decisions of the RTC.

122

See also 818 R70 to the same effect as S7(c) R40.

Rule 40
Appeals From The Municipal Trial Courts
To The Regional Trial Courts

Under S8 R40, if an appeal is taken from an
order of the lower court dismissing the case without
a trial on the merits on the ground of lack of

the dismissal order, should, if it has jurisdiction
thereover, proceed to try the case on the merits as
if the case was originally filed with it.
c)

Q.

D should appeal to the CA by way of Rule 41.
This is because the RTC tried the case in the
exercise of its original rather than appellate
jurisdiction. (S8 R40, first paragraph).

P filed with the Metropolitan Trial Court of Las
Pifias City a complaint against D to recover
possession of a parcel of land with an assessed
value of P60,000. D filed an answer. The MeTC

b) Assume the RTC does not dismiss the
appeal and proceeds to take cognizance
thereof. The RTC decides the case in favor
of D. What mode of appeal should P use in
case he wants to have the RTC decision
reviewed on questions of law and fact?

A.

a)

No the RTC should not dismiss the appeal.

Under S8 R40, if the case was tried on the
merits by the lower court without jurisdiction over
the subject matter, the RTC on appeal shall not
dismiss the case if it has original jurisdiction
thereof, but shall decide the case in accordance

with S7 R40, without prejudice to the admission of
amended pleadings and additional evidence in the
interest of justice.
Here although the MTC did not have
jurisdiction over the real action since the assessed
value of the land exceeds P50,000, the RTC should
not dismiss the case since it has original jurisdiction
over real actions where the assessed value of the
real property exceeds P50,000.
b) P should appeal by way of R42 to the Court of
Appeals, since the RTC tried the case in the
exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.
Q

Anabel filed a complaint against B for unlawful
detainer before the Municipal Trial Court (MTC)
of Candaba, Pampanga. After the issues had
been joined, the MTC dismissed the complaint
for lack of jurisdiction after noting that the
action v1asone for accion publiciana.
Anabel appealed the dismissal to the RTC
which affirmed it and accordingly dismissed
her appeal. She elevates the case to the Court
of Appeals, which remands the case to the
RTC. Is the appellate court correct? Explain.
(10 Bar Q3)

A.

Yes the appellate court is correct.
Under the Rules on Civil Procedure, where the
MTC dismisses a case on the ground that it has no
jurisdiction, the plaintiff may appeal the order of
dismissal to the RTC, which while affirming the
dismissal order shall try the case on the merits if it

722

Rule 40

has jurisdiction thereof and as if the case were
originally filed with it. (S8 R40).
Here the RTC had original jurisdiction over the
accion publiciana case; hence it should have tried
the same. Thus the remand by the Court of
Appeals was proper.

(Note: The examinee may reasonably presume
that the accion publiciana relates to land/realty with
an assessed value exceeding P20,000; otherwise
the MTC would not have dismissed the case).
Q.

Plaintiff filed a complaint for a sum of money
against defendant with the MeTC-Makati, the
total amount of the demand, exclusive of

to dismiss the complaint on the ground of the
MeTC's lack of jurisdiction over the subject
matter. After due hearing, the MeTC (1) ruled that
the court indeed lacked jurisdiction over the
subject matter of the complaint; and (2) ordered
that the case therefore should be forwarded to

723
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

REMEDIALLAW
However the court's ruling to forward
immediately the case to the proper Regional Trial
Court was not correct.
Under the Rules of Civil Procedure, where a
case is dismissed by the MTG on the ground of lack
of jurisdiction, the remedy of the plaintiff is to
appeal the order of dismissal to the RTC which if it
has jurisdiction shall try the case on the merits as if
the case were originally filed with it. The Rules do
not empower the MTC to forward the case to the
proper RTC. [S8 R40]
Q.

Plaintiff lessor filed with the MTC an unlawful
detainer case against the lessee. The demand
letter by the plaintiff informed the lessor that he
was unilaterally rescinding the lease and
demanded that lessee vacate the premises. The
MTC dismissed the ejectment case for lack of
jurisdiction, holding that accion publiciana was
the proper remedy. On appeal to the RTC, the
latter reversed the MTC decision and held that
the complaint sufficiently made out a case for
unlawful detainer and thus the MTC had
jurisdiction. Defendant appealed to the CA. The
CA affirmed the RTC decision, holding that
assuming arguendo that the complaint was one
for accion publiciana, the RTC was duty bound
not to dismiss the case pursuant to S8 R40.
Was the CA's invocation of S8 R40 proper?

A.

No. Admittedly, S8 R40 authorizes the RTC
to decide an appealed case on the merits -as if it
were originally filed before it- if it finds that it has
original jurisdiction over the case. However, this is
not the case here because the RTC affirmed the

724
J9JC9B0M

Rule 40

MTC's jurisdiction over the original complaint.
(Quesada v. Bonanza Restaurants, 14 November

2016, Brion, J.).
Q.

Are the other provisions of R41 applicable to
appeals under R40?

A.

Yes, insofar as they are not inconsistent with or
may serve to supplement the provisions of R40.
(S9 R40).

123

1tshould also be noted that since the case was dismissed by the MTC
without a trial on the merits, the RTC on appeal should have conducted a trial on
the merits rather than merely deciding the case based on the records. The
RTC's failure to conduct a trial on the merits hence did not cure the MTC's lack of
jurisdiction.

RULE 41. APPEAL FROM THE
REGIONAL TRIAL COURT
Q.

What judgment or orders may be appealed?

A.

An appeal may be taken from a judgment or final
order that completely disposes of the case, or of a
particular matter therein when declared by the
Rules of Court to be appealable.

Q.

Can a party file a notice of appeal from a
judgment even if there is a pending motion for
reconsideration by the other party?

A.

Yes. There is nothing in the Rules which makes a
party's right to appeal dependent or contingent on
the opposing party's motion for reconsideration.
Similarly, a party's undertaking to file a motion for
reconsideration of a judgment is not hindered by
the other party's filing of a notice of appeal. Each
party has a different period within which to appeal
and since each party has a different period within
which to appeal, the timely filing of a motion for
reconsideration by one party does not interrupt the
other or another party's period of appeal. (Bernardo
v. Soriano, 19 June 2019, Caguioa, J.)

Q.

Give examples of an order that disposes of a
particular matter which may be appealed as
provided in the Rules of Court.

concerning appeals in special proceedings.
b)

g) An order g_ismissingan action without prejudice.
(S1 R41 as amended by SC Resolution
effective 27 December 2007).
Q.

What is the final judgment rule? What is the
exception thereto?

A.

The final judgment rule provides that an appeal
may be taken only from a judgment or final order
that completely disposes of the case. (S1 R41).
The exception is when a judgment or final
order completely disposes of a particular matter in a
case and the Rules declare such judgment or final
order to be appealable. Examples are the order of
expropriation in an expropriation case (S4 R67) and

727
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

the order of partition in a partition case (S2 R69).
Both orders do not completely dispose of the
case but nonetheless appealable as provided for
by the Rules.
Q.

Is an order denying a petition for relief from
judgment appealable? How about an order
granting a petition for relief?

A.

No. (S1[a] R41). Under the 1964 Rules, a judgment
denying relief under R38 was subject to appeal.
This was changed in the 1997 Rules.
With more reason is an order granting a
petition for relief not appealable since the same is
clearly an interlocutory order. (2 FLORENZ D.
REGALADO, REMEDIAL LAW COMPENDIUM 397
[ih rev. ed., 3rdprinting]).

Q.

Distinguish a final order from an interlocutory
order.

A.

A final order is one that disposes of the subject
matter in its entirety or terminates a particular
proceeding or action, leaving nothing else to be
done but to enforce by execution what has been
determined by the court, while an interlocutory
order is one which does not dispose of the case
completely but leaves something to be decided
upon. (Silverio v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No.
178933, 16 September 2006). The rule is that a
final order, unlike an interlocutory one, is appealable.
The remedy of a party from an interlocutory order is
to assign it as an error in the appeal from the
judgment or to file a special civil action for certiorari
if the order was issued without or excess of
jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of or excess of jurisdiction.

Rule 41
Appeal From The
Regional Trial Court

Q.

Plaintiff filed a complaint against Defendant
before the RTC. Prior to trial, the RTC dismissed
the case without prejudice for Plaintiff's failure
to prosecute. Twenty days after the Plaintiff's
notice of the order of dismissal, he filed a
motion for reconsideration, invoking meritorious
grounds.
a)

May the RTC entertain the motion for
reconsideration and revive the case?

b) Would your answer be the same if the order
was silent on whether it was with or without
prejudice?
A.

a)

Yes. The remedy from an order dismissing a
case without prejudice is not an appeal but a
special civil action under Rule 65. Hence the
15-day period to appeal or file a motion for
reconsideration is not applicable to the order of
dismissal without prejudice. Thus the motion
for reconsideration was timely filed.

b) No, in that case my answer would not be the
same. The dismissal would be considered as
one with prejudice pursuant to S3 R17. In such
a case the dismissal order is a final appealable
order. The failure to file a motion for
reconsideration within 15 days from notice
rendered such order final and unappealable.
Q.

The RTC ordered petitioner's Notice of Appeal
expunged from the records "for lack of
authority from, [its] Board of Directors to initiate
the appeal," pursuant to Section 12 of RA 9904.
Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration of
729

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER~REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

the order which was denied. The Petitioners filed
a special civil action for certiorari to set aside the
RTC's order. Was certiorari the proper remedy?
A.

Yes. The order - expunging petitioner's Notice of
Appeal from the records of the case - is effectively
an order disallowing or dismissing an appeal that
precludes resort to an appeal. Hence, pursuant to
S1 R41, petitioner's only recourse is via the present
certiorari action.
The order was issued with grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack of or excess of
jurisdiction. A board resolution authorizing the
representative to initiate the appeal is not required
for the purpose of filing a notice of appeal. This is
because a notice of appeal is not a pleading,
initiatory or otherwise, that, when required by the
law or the rules, must contain, among others, a
verification and certification against forum shopping
to be signed by the party or his/her representative,
and, in the case of a representative, proof of his/her
authority to file the action, i.e., power of attorney or
secretary's certificate with copy of the board
resolution. (United Interior Manggahan Homeowners
Assoc. v. De Luna, 20 November 2017, PerlasBernabe, J.).

Q.

What is the remedy of an aggrieved party from
the issuance of a writ of possession in a
petition for extrajudicial foreclosure? Appeal or
a special civil action for certiorari?

A.

Appeal. A special civil action for certiorari could be
availed of only if there is no appeal or any other
plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of law. It has been repeatedly held in a

730
J9JC9B0M

Rule 41
Appeal From The
Regional Trial Court

number of cases that the remedy of a party from
the trial court's order granting the issuance of a writ
of possession is to file a petition to set aside the
sale and cancel the writ of possession, and the
aggrieved party may then appeal from the order
denying or granting said petition. When a writ of
possession had already been issued as in this
case, the proper remedy is an appeal and not a
petition for certiorari. To be sure, the trial court's
order granting the writ of possession is final. The
soundness of the order granting the writ of
possession is a matter of judgment, with respect to
which the remedy of the party aggrieved is ordinary
appeal. As respondent availed of the wrong
remedy, the appellate court erred in not dismissing
outright the petition for certiorari. (Producers Bank
v. Excelsa Industries, Inc., 669 SCRA 470 [2012]).
After the consolidation of title in the buyer's
name for failure of the mortgagor to redeem the
property, the writ of possession becomes a matter
of right. Its issuance to a purchaser in an
extrajudicial foreclosure sale is merely a ministerial
function. The trial court has no discretion on this
matter. Hence, any assertion of discretion in
connection with such issuance is misplaced, and a
petition for certiorari is not a proper remedy. The
order for the issuance of a writ of possession being
final, it is a proper subject for appeal. (BPI v. Co, 9
November 2015, Jardeleza, J.).
Q.

In November 2003, First Marbella Condominium
Association, Inc. (FMCA) filed with the RTC,
through the office of the clerk of court, a
petition for extrajudicial foreclosure against
Gatmaytan, a unit owner, for unpaid association
dues amounting to P3 million. The RTC
731

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

executive judge issued an order dismissing the
petition on the ground that there was no
mortgagee-mortgagor relationship between FMCA
and Gatmaytan. FMCA filed a motion for
reconsideration which was denied. FMCA elevated
the matter to the SC by way of a petition for
certiorari under R45. In its petition, FMCA raised
a sole question of law, that is, that FMCA may
file the petition for extrajudicial foreclosure
pursuant to Sec. 20 of the Condominium Act
which provides that unpaid assessments shall
constitute a lien which may be enforced in the
same manner as judicial
or extrajudicial
foreclosure of real estate mortgage. Was the
filing of the petition for review on certiorari with
the Supreme Court the proper remedy?
A.

No. Only a judgment, final order or resolution
rendered by a court in the exercise of its judicial
functions relative to an actual controversy is subject
to an appeal to the SC by way of a Petition for
Review on Certiorari. The order dismissing the
petition for extrajudicial foreclosure was issued by
the RTC Executive Judge in the exercise of his
administrative function to supervise the ministerial
duty of the Clerk of Court as Ex-Oficio Sheriff in the
conduct of an extrajudicial foreclosure sale; hence,
said orders are not appealable under R45. Rather,
the correct remedy is by petition for mandamus.
(First Marbella Condominium Association, Inc. v.
Gatmaytan, 557 SCRA 155 [2008]). 124

124
The SC proceeded nonetheless to treat the petition for review on certiorari
as a petition for mandamus and then to dismiss it on the ground that petitioner had
no right to extrajudicially foreclose since it did not have a special power of attorney
authorizing extrajudicial foreclosure as required under Act. No. 3135.

right to implead E. ( Vda. de Dias v. Balagot, 20
SCRA 950 [1967]).

Q.

Is an order denying a motion to intervene
appealable? If so what is the period for
appealing the order?

A.

Yes, an order denying a motion to intervene may
be appealed. The appeal period is 15 days from
notice of the order. (Foster-Gallego v. Spouses

Q.

United Alloy filed with the RTC a case against
United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) for
annulment and/or reformation of contract. The
complaint was dismissed by the RTC on the
ground of improper venue and forum-shopping,
United Alloy not having disclosed the pendency
of another case involving the same issues
between the parties. United Alloy filed a special
civil action for certiorari with the Court of
Appeals seeking to set aside the dismissal
order. The CA dismissed the petition for
certiorari, ruling that the proper remedy that
United Alloy should have availed of was appeal.
Was appeal the proper remedy?

A.

No. Except for cases falling under paragraphs (f),
(h), or (i), the dismissal of an action based on the
grounds under S1 R16 is without prejudice and
does not preclude the refiling of the same action.
And under S1 (g) R41, an order dismissing an
action without prejudice is not appealable. The
proper remedy therefrom is a special civil action for
certiorari under Rule 65.
But, if the reason for the dismissal is based on
paragraphs (f), (h), or (i) (i.e., res judicata,
prescription, extinguishment of the claim or
demand, and unenforceability under the Statute of
Frauds) the dismissal, under S5 R16, is with
prejudice and the remedy of the aggrieved party is
to appeal the order granting the motion to dismiss.

The RTC dismissed D's appeal because of D's

12

6The rulings of the Supreme Court on this point are conflicting. In
Strongworld Construction Corp. v. Pere/lo, 27 July 2006, the court held a
dismissal for failure to state a cause of action as one "without prejudice" since it
was other than the grounds in S1(f), (h), and (i). However in Madrigal Transport
v. Lapanday Holdings, 11 August 2004, the court characterized the interpretation
that S5 R16 limits the remedy of appeal only to dismissals grounded on S1(f),
(h), and (i) as "absurd." It is submitted that Madrigal Transport is more
persuasive. It is not correct to call dismissals under S1 R16 other than (f), (h),
and (i), as "without prejudice" simply because they can be refiled. Dismissals
"without prejudice" are those specifically mentioned in the rules under S5 R7, S3
R17 (if provided by court), and S5 R18 (if provided by court). For instance,
dismissal of the case without a trial on the merits, including that grounded on lack
of jurisdiction, is appealable by the express terms of S8 R40.

appropriate since an appeal was the proper
remedy from the RTC order dismissing D's
appeal. Was P's argument correct?

A.

No. Under S 1(c) R41, no appeal may be taken from
an order disallowing or dismissing an appeal.- In
such a case, the aggrieved party may file an
appropriate special civil action as provided in R65.
Hence the special civil action for certiorari was the
proper remedy. (Sarmiento v. Zaratan, 5 February
127
2007).

Q.

What are the instances of dismissal without
prejudice?

A.
1)

Dismissal pursuant to S5 R7 (rule on
certification against forum shopping) unless the
dismissal is due to willful and deliberate forumshopping.

2)

Dismissal under S1 R17 (plaintiff's notice of
dismissal).

3)

Dismissal under S2 R 17 (plaintiff's motion of
dismissal).

4)

Dismissal under S3 R17 (failure to prosecute)
where provided for by the court in its order.

5)

Dismissal under S5 R18 (failure to appear at
the pretrial) where provided for by the court
in its order.

127
Cf. Ang v. Grageda, G.R. No. 166239, 8 June 2006, where it was held
that appeal under R42 was the proper remedy from the RTC order dismissing an
appeal pursuant to S7(b) R40. It is submitted that Sarmiento, which squarely
tackled the issue of whether it is appeal or certiorari which is the proper remedy,
should be regarded as the controlling doctrine.

Q.

Dismissal which the court expressly provides to
be "without prejudice." (See Mijares v. Ranada,
12 April 2005).

P filed with the RTC a torts case against A, B, C,
and D. The sheriff went to D's residence and
served the summons and complaint on D's
husband, since D was temporarily out of the
country in Ireland. Subsequently D filed an
answer raising the affirmative defense of lack of
personal jurisdiction. D argued that she was not
properly served with summons since she was
temporarily out of the country and hence service
of summons on her should conform to 518 R14
which requires extraterritorial service.
The RTC granted the affirmative defense
and dismissed the case. P filed a timely motion
for reconsideration but the same was denied.
th
On the 60 day from notice of the order denying
his motion for reconsideration, P filed with the
Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari under
R65 contending that the dismissal order was
issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting
to lack of or excess of jurisdiction. D filed a
motion to dismiss the petition for certiorari
contending that the proper remedy for P was an
appeal. Should the Court of Appeals dismiss

Under the Rules of Civil Procedure, no appeal
may be taken from a judgment or final order for or
against one or more of several parties while the
main case is pending and that the aggrieved party

may file an appropriate special civil action under
R65. (S1 [f] R41 ).
Here the final order was for D who was one of
several defendants, and the main case was still
pending. Hence the petition for certiorari under
R65 was a proper remedy. (Palma v. Galvez, 10
March 2010).
Q.

Give the modes of appeal.

A.
a)

Ordinary appeal. The appeal to the CA in
cases decided by the RTC in the exercise of its
original· jurisdiction shall be taken by filing a
notice of appeal with the RTC and serving a
copy thereof upon the adverse party. No record
on appeal shall be required except in special
proceedings and other cases of multiple
or separate appeals where the law or the Rules
so require.

b)

Petition for review under R42. The appeal to
the CA in cases decided by the RTC in the
exercise of its appellate jurisdiction shall be
by verified petition for review in accordance
with R42.

c)

Appeal by certiorari (Petition for review on
certiorari) under R45. In all cases where only
·questions of law are raised or involved, the
appeal shall be to the Supreme Court by
verified petition for review on certiorari in
accordance with R45.

Q.

When is appeal a matter of right and when is it
not a matter of right?

A.

Ordinary appeal is a matter of right. This means
that the appellate court should review the case, and
this duty is compellable by mandamus. Appeals
under R42, R43, and R45 are not a matter of right.
Review is discretionary and the appellate court may
dismiss the petition outright if it finds that the
questions raised are too unsubstantial to require
consideration.

Q.

When is ordinary appeal not a matter of right?

A.

In cases of an appeal from a several or separate
judgment while the main case is pending, the
appeal must be made with leave of court. (S1 R41).

Q.

May there be an instance in which the decision
of the MTC may be appealed to the Court
of Appeals?

A.

Yes. The decision of the MTC in the exercise of its
delegated jurisdiction in cadastral and land
registration cases shall be appealable in the same
manner as decisions of the Regional Trial Courts.
(Sec. 34, B.P. Big. 129).

Q.

Give the periods of ordinary appeals.

A.
1)

The appeal shall be taken within 15 days
from notice of the judgment or final order
appealed from.

2)

Where a record on appeal is required, the
appellant shall file a notice of appeal and a

record on appeal within 30 days from notice of
the judgment or final order.

Q.

3)

In habeas corpus cases, appeal shall be taken
within 48 hours from notice of the judgment or
final order appealed from.

4)

In writ of amparo and writ of habeas data
cases, the period of appeal shall be 5 working
days from notice of the adverse judgment
or final order.

On 5 April P received the order of the court

b)

Up to 20 April 2006. (April 5 + 15 = April 20).

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

received a copy of the dismissal order on 3 March
1998 and on the 15th day thereafter or on 18
March 98 filed a motion for reconsideration. The
trial court denied the motion for reconsideration
in an order which was received by Pon 22 July
98. On 27 Juiy 98 P filed with the RTC a notice of
appeal. The RTC denied the notice of appeal
stating that P only had up to 23 July 98 within
which to file the notice of appeal. Did the trial
court act correctly in refusing to give due course
to the appeal of P?
A.

No. Under S3 R41 P had 15 days from notice of
the judgment or final order to appeal the RTC
decision. The order denying P's motion for
reconsideration was a final order since it finally
disposed of the issues in the case. Hence P had 15
days from 22 July 98 or up to 6 August 2004 (22 +
15 - 31 [days in July] = 6). (Neypes v. CA, G.R.
141524, 14 Sep 05, en bane).

Q.

Aside from R41, what other Rules are governed
by the fresh 15-day period rule?

A.

In Neypes, the Supreme Court stated that aside
from Rule 41, the "fresh" 15-day period rule applies
also to Rule 40 (appeal from MTC to RTC), Rule
42 (petition for review from RTC to CA), Rule 43
(appeal from quasi-Judicial bodies to the CA), and
Rule 45. (Id.).
A scrutiny of the said rules, however, reveals
that the "fresh period rule" enunciated in Neypes
does not apply to Rules 42, 43 and 45 as there is
no interruption in the 15-day reglementary period to
appeal. It is already explicit in S1 R42, S4 R43 and
S2 R45 that the appellant or petitioner is accorded

740

Rule 41
Appeal From The
Regional Trial Court

a fresh period of 15 days from the notice of the
decision, award, judgment, final order or resolution
or of the denial of petitioner's motion for new trial or
reconsideration filed. (See Rodriguez v. People,
G.R. 192799, 24 October 2012).
Take note also that Yu v. Tatad, G.R. No.
170979, 9 February 2011, expanded the scope of
the Neypes doctrine to criminal cases in appeals of
conviction under S6 R122.
Q.

In a habeas corpus case, the respondent
Director of the Bureau of Corrections received a
copy of the RTC's decision on October 1 at
10:00 am. Up to when may the Director appeal

A.

Up to 3 October, even if beyond 10:00 am. Under
S1 R22, in computing any period of time prescribed
or allowed by the Rules of Court or by order of
court, or by any applicable statute, the day of the
act or event from which the designated period of
time begins to run is to be excluded and the date of_
performance included. Hence the 48-hour period°
starts to run on 2 October. (See Kabigting v.

Q.

What is a record on appeal?

A.

The record on appeal is a record of the case a quo
prepared and filed by a party who intends to take
an appeal in cases of special proceedings, and in
cases of multiple and separate appeals.

Q.

What is the purpose of a record on appeal?

A.

The purpose of a record on appeal is to enable the

Q.

Is the order of a liquidation court allowing or
disallowing a claim appealable?
If so, is a
record on appeal required?

A.

An order of a liquidation court allowing or
disallowing a claim is a final order, which may be
the subject of an appeal. The issuance of such an
order, by its nature, affects only the particular claim
involved, thereby creating a situation where multiple
appeals are allowed. Consequently, a record on
appeal is necessary in each and every appeal
made thereon. (Consolidated Bank & Trust Co. v.
United Pacific Leasing & Finance Corp., 19 October
2015, Jardeleza, J.).

Q.

Give the form and contents of a record on appeal.

A.
1)

The full names of all the parties to the
proceedings shall be stated in the caption of

2)

It shall include the judgment or final order from
which the appeal is taken.

Q.

Where is the record on appeal filed?

A.

Q.

What action shall the trial court take on the
record on appeal?

A.

The trial court may approve it as presented, or
upon its own motion or at the instance of the
appellee, may direct its amendment by the
inclusion of any omitted matters which are deemed
essential to the determination of the issue of law or
fact involved in the appeal. (S7 R41).

Q.

When is a party's appeal deemed perfected as
to him?

A.

A party's appeal by notice of appeal is deemed
perfected as to him upon the filing of the notice of
appeal in due time.
A party's appeal by record on appeal is
deemed perfected as to him with respect to the
subject matter thereof upon the approval of the
record on appeal filed in due time. (S9 R41).
Under R42, the appeal is deemed perfected as
to the petitioner upon the timely filing of the petition
for review and the payment of the corresponding
docket and other lawful fees. (S8 R42).

Q.

When does the trial court lose jurisdiction?

A.

In appeals by notice of appeal, the trial court loses
jurisdiction over the (entire) case:

744
J9JC9B0M

Rule 41
Appeal From The
Regional Trial Court

1)

Upon perfection of the appeals filed in due
time, and

2)

Upon the expiration of the time to appeal of the
other parties.

In appeals by record on appeal, the trial court
loses jurisdiction over the subject matter of the
record on appeal (but retains jurisdiction over the
remaining subject matter not covered by the
appeal):
Upon the approval of the record on appeal filed
in due time, and
Upon the expiration of the time to appeal of the
other parties. (S9 R41).
Q.

The trial court issued an order giving due
course to respondent's appeal upon learning
that a notice of appeal had been timely filed and
that a postal money had been issued to the
clerk of court representingthe appeal fee. Months
later the petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the
appeal contending that the respondents never
paid the appeal fee. Upon verification the court
learned that while respondent had indeed
issued a postal money order in favor of the
Office of the Clerk of Court of the RTC, the
amount pertaining thereto was never remitted
or received by the court. The RTC thus
dismissed the case for failure to prosecute. On
petition for certiorari, the CA held that the RTC
acted with grave abuse of discetion in
dismissing respondent's appeal since the RTC
had already lost jurisdiction over the case when
it gave due course to respondent's appeal. Did
745

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

the RTC act with grave abuse of discretion in
dismissing respondent's appeal?

A.

No. Respondent failed to perfect its appeal before
the RTC by not paying the full amount of the
prescribed appellate docket fees. Consequently,
the RTC did not lose jurisdiction over the case and,
as a matter of discretion, properly dismissed the
appeal for failure to prosecute. The RTC retained
jurisdiction to dismiss the appeal as provided under
89 R41. As a result of respondent's failure to
perfect an appeal within the period fixed by law, no
court could exercise appellate jurisdiction to review
the RTC decision. (Huang v. Land Bank of the
Philippines, 17 February 2016, Perlas-Bernabe, J.).

Q.

What is meant by the residual jurisdiction of the
trial court?

A.

It is the power of the trial court after it has lost
jurisdiction but prior to the transmittal of the original
record or the record on appeal, to: (PWICE)
1)

Issue orders for the Q.rotectionand preservation
of the parties' rights which do not involve any
matter litigated by the appeal;

2) Approve _gompromises;
3)

Q.

After the defendant has taken an appeal, may
the RTC dismiss the appeal?

A.

Yes, provided that:
1) The original record or the record on appeal is
not yet transmitted to the appellate court.
2)

The dismissal may be made only on the ground
that it was taken out of time, or that the docket
and other lawful fees were not paid within the
reglementary period.

The dismissal may be upon motion or motu
proprio. (S13 R41).

Q.

Philippine Bank of Communications (PBCom)
filed a collection case against Private

RTC for failure of PBCom to pay the full docket
fee per its order. PBCom filed a motion for
reconsideration but it was denied. PBCom filed
a timely notice of appeal but the same was not
given due course by the RTC on the ground
that appeal was not the proper remedy. Without
filing a motion for reconsideration, PBCom filed
a petition for certiorari and mandamus with the
Court of Appeals. The CA denied the petition on
the ground that (1) appeal and not certiorari and
mandamus was the proper remedy, and (2)
PBCom failed to comply with the mandatory
requirement of a motion for reconsideration.
a) Was the CA correct in stating that appeal
and not certiorari was the proper remedy?

to file first a motion for reconsideration of the
challenged order?

A
a)

No. Under 81 (c) R41, no appeal may be taken
from an order disallowing or dismissing an
appeal. In such a case the aggrieved party may
file the appropriate special civil action under R65.

b)

No. While the general rule is that a motion for
reconsideration is a condition precedent to filing
a special civil action under R65, an exception is
when the challenged order is patently defective.
Here the RTC's order disallowing the appeal
was patently defective since under S13 R41,
the RTC may dismiss an appeal only on two
grounds: ( 1) the appeal is taken out of time,
and (2) non-payment of the docket and other
lawful fees within the reglementary period.

Here the RTC disaiiowed the appeal not on the
two grounds cited but on the ground that appeal
was not the proper remedy. Hence such disallowance
is patently defective and may be set aside by
certiorari and the RTC ordered to give due course to
the appeal. (Philippine Bank of Communications v.

Q.

Petitioner Samson filed a Complaint before the
RTC of Pasig City for Recovery of Property or
its Value against respondent spouses, Tanay
Rural Bank, Inc., and the Register of Deeds of
Morong, Rizal, claiming that he had been paying
his one-third (1/3) share of realty taxes covering
the subject portion of land for the years 2002 to
2004. In 2005, however, his payment was
rejected by the Municipal Treasurer of Tanay,
Rizai; at such time he discovered that
respondent spouses had already mortgaged the
entire property in favor of respondent Bank
back in November 2002. In August 2006, the
RTC of Pasig City dismissed the complaint on
the grounds of improper venue, res judicata,
and that the complaint states no cause of
action. It held that the suit is a real action which
should be filed in the RTC of Morong, Rizal,
where the property subject of the case is
situated. Moreover, the lower court pointed out
that as early as 1991, herein petitioner had
already filed a Complaint for Partition of Real

128
Pursuant to the old rule, in which the movant would have only the
balance of the remaining period. (See De Las Alas v. Court of Appeals, 83 SCRA
200). The new rule is that the movant would have a fresh 15-day period. (Neypes
v. Court of Appeals, 14 September 2005).

750

Rule 41
Appeal From The
Regional Trial Court

Property and Damages involving the same
subject property against the same parties,
which complaint was already dismissed by this
Court with finality. Thus, the principle of res
judicata applies. Finally, the trial court held that
petitioner's complaint states no cause of action
against herein respondent Bank as it does not
allege any details as to the liability or any
violation of petitioner's rights. Claiming that the
lower court erred in dismissing his complaint,
petitioner Samson filed an appeal with the CA,
which likewise dismissed the same for having
been improperly brought before it. The appellate
court ruled that since petitioner's appeal raised
only issues purely of law, it should be
dismissed outright. Did the CA correctly dismiss
the appeal?
A.

Yes. In the instant case, petitioner appealed the
Order of the trial court which dismissed his
complaint for improper venue, lack of cause of
action, and res judicata. Dismissals based on these
grounds do not involve a review of the facts of the
case but merely the application of the law,
specifically in this case, R 16. The issue to be
resolved is limited to whether or not said rule was
properly applied, which will only involve a review of
the complaint, the motions to dismiss, and the trial
court's order of dismissal, but not the probative
value of the evidence submitted nor the truthfulness
or falsity of the facts. Considering, therefore, that
the subject appeal raised only questions of law, the

Q.

After receiving the adverse decision rendered
against his client, the defendant, Atty. Sikat
duly filed a notice of appeal. For his part, the
plaintiff timely filed a motion for partial new trial
to seek an increase in the monetary damages
awarded. The RTC instead rendered an amended
decision further reducing the monetary awards.
Is it necessary for Atty. Sikat to file a second
notice of appeal after receiving the amended
decision? (08 Bar Q12).

A.

No, it is not necessary for Atty. Sikat to file a
second notice of appeal after receiving the
amended decision.
The Supreme Court has held that a party need
not file a second notice of appeal from the amended
decision after having perfected an appeal from the
original decision and that to hold otherwise would be
to give a premium to technicalities at the expense of
a just resolution of the case. (PNB-Republic Bank v.
Cordova, 14 March 2008; Pacific Life Assurance Co.
129
V. Sison, 299 SCRA 16 [1998]).

VVhile there is an obiter in Pacific Life Assurance Co. that a notice of
appeal would be necessary if the amended decision decreased the appellant's
liability, it is submitted that the better view is that it would not matter whether the
amended decision increased or decreased the appellant's liability. After all, the
appellant was still held liable in the amended decision.

RULE 42. PETITION FOR REVIEW FROM
THE RTC TO THE CA
Q.

How may a party appeal from a decision of the
RTC rendered in the exercise of its appellate
jurisdiction?

A.

A party desiring to appeal from a decision of the
RTC rendered in the exercise of its appellate
jurisdiction may file a verified petition for review with
the Court of Appeals, furnishing the RTC and the
adverse party with a copy of the petition.

Q.

Within what time should the petition for review be
filed?

A.

The petition should be filed and served within 15
days from notice of the decision or of the denial of
petitioner's motion for reconsideration or new trial.
Upon proper motion and the payment of the full
amount of the docket and other lawful fees and the
deposit of costs before the expiration of the
reglementary period, the Court of Appeals may
grant an additional period of 15 days only within
which to file the petition for review. No further
extension shall be granted except for the most
compelling reason and in no case to exceed 1§
days.

Q.

P filed with the MTC a complaint for P300,000
against D. D filed a motion to dismiss on the
ground of improper venue but this was denied by
the MTC. D challenged the order denying his
motion to dismiss by filing a special civil action for
certiorari before the RTC. The RTC dismissed the
petition for certiorari. How should D seek the

753
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

review of the RTC resolution dismissing his petition
for certiorari? By way of R41 or R42?

A.

By way of R41. Since the RTC decision was
rendered in the exercise of its original rather than
appellate jurisdiction it should be appealed under
R41. A special civil action for certiorari is not a
mode of appeal but an original action.

Q.

A boundary dispute between Brgy. Sangalang
and Brgy. Maguihan was lodged in the
Sanggunian Bayan of Lemery, Batangas. The
Sanggunian decided in favor of Brgy. Sangalang.
Brgy. Maguihan filed a notice of appeal. The
Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal because
Brgy. Maguihan availed of the wrong mode of
appeal. Was the dismissal of the appeal proper?

A.

Yes. Section 119 of the Local Government Code
provides that the decision of the sanggunian
concerned may be appealed to the RTC having
jurisdiction over the area in dispute, within the time
and manner prescribed by the Rules of Court. In the
case at bar, it is clear that when the case was
appealed to the RTC, the latter took cognizance of
the case in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction,
not its original jurisdiction. Hence, any further appeal
from the RTC Decision must conform to R42 not
R41. The appellant should have filed a petition for
review with the CA, not a notice of appeal. (Brgy.
Sangalang v. Brgy. Maguihan, 23 December 2009).

Q.

P won in an ejectment suit against D. The MTC
refused to give due course to the notice of
appeal filed by D so the latter filed a special civil
action for certiorari with the RTC. The RTC
granted the petition for certiorari. P appealed to

754
J9JC9B0M

Rule 42
Petition For Review From
The RTC To The CA

the Court of Appeals by way of a petition for
review under R42. The CA dismissed P's appeal
holding that the proper remedy was R41
not R42. Was the dismissal of P's petition for
review correct?
A.

Yes. A special civil action for certiorari under R65 is
an original action. Hence the RTC decision granting
the petition for certiorari was made in the exercise of
its original not appellate jurisdiction. Hence the
proper remedy was R41 not R42. (Heirs of Garcia v.
Mun. of Iba, Zambales, 22 July 2015, Bersamin, J.).

Q.

The land of Diaz was expropriated by the
Department of Agrarian Reform pursuant to P.D.
No. 27. The DAR valued the land at P197,000.
Not satisfied with the valuation, Diaz filed a
complaint against the LBP and the DAR with the
RTC of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, sitting as a SpeciatAgrarian Court (SAC). The complaint prayed that
the just compensation be fixed at PS million. The
SAC in its decision agreed with the DAR's
valuation. Diaz appealed the SAC's decision to
the Court of Appeals by way of ordinary appeal
under R41. The LBP moved to dismiss the
appeal. Should the appeal be dismissed?

A.

Yes. Section 60 of the Comprehensive Agrarian
Reform Law of 1998 provides that an appeal may be
taken from a decision of the SACs by filing a petition
for review with the CA within 15 days from receipt of
the notice of the decision, otherwise the decision
shall become final. Hence the proper mode of
appeal is by a petition for review under Rule 42 and
not through an ordinary appeal under R41. (Land
Bankv. CA, G.R. No.190660, 11 April 2011).

Q.

May the petition for review under R42 raise

A.

Yes. (S2 R42). Compare with a petition for review
on certiorari which as a rule can only raise
legal questions.

Q.

May the petition for review under R42 raise only
questions of law?

A.

Yes. Hence an appeal from a decision of the RTC
rendered in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction
is to the CA even if it raises only questions of law.
(S2[c] R42; see 14 BarQ22).

Q.

Give briefly the procedure to be observed by
the CA after the filing of the petition.

A.
1) The CA may require the respondent to file a

dismiss, or the CA may dismiss the petition if it
finds the same to be patently without merit,
prosecuted manifestly for delay, or that the
questions raised therein are too unsubstantial
to require consideration. (MTD)
2)

If upon the filing of the comment or such other
pleadings as the court may allow or require, or
after the expiration of the period for the filing
thereof without such comment or pleading
having been submitted, the CA finds prima

error of fact or law that will warrant a reversal or
modification of the appealed decision, it may
give due course to the petition.

Upon the timely filing of a petition for review and
the payment of the corresponding docket and other
lawful fees.

Take note that under R.A., No. 9282 (approved
30 March 2004) which amended R.A. 1125 (the
Court of Tax Appeals Law), a party adversely
affected by a resolution of a Division of the CTA on
a motion for reconsideration or new trial, may file a
petition for review with the CTA en bane. (Sec. 18,
R.A. No. 1125). A motion for reconsideration or new
trial filed with the CTA division is thus a condition
precedent for filing a petition for review with the
CTA en bane. A party adversely affected by a
decision or ruling of the CTA en bane may file with
the Supreme Court a verified petition for review on
certiorari under R45. (Sec. 19).
Take note also that a party affected by a
decision, ruling, or inaction of the Central Board of
Assessment Appeals may file an appeal with the
CTA within 30 days after the receipt of such
decision or ruling or after the expiration of the
period fixed by law for action. Appeal shall be made
by filing a petition for review analogous to Rule 42
within 30 days from receipt of the decision or ruling

Q.

In November 2019, the City Council of Manila
passed Ordinance No. 8331, enacting the 2013
Omnibus Revenue Code of the City of Manila.
In January 2014, some operators of retail
businesses in the City of Manila filed an appeal
before Secretary of Justice Leila M. De Lima
(petitioner). The retail business operators claimed
that Section 104 of Ordinance No. 8331, which
imposed percentage tax on gross sales of
retailers from 1% to 3%, is unconstitutional and
violative of the Local Government Code. The
petitioner issued a Resolution declaring Section
104 of Ordinance No. 8331 void for being
contrary to Section 191 of the Local Government
Code. What is the remedy of the City of Manila
from the petitioner's resolution?

A.

A petition for review under R43. The subject matter of
review is the decision of the Secretary of Justice
evaluating the legality or constitutionality of a local
revenue ordinance, an act which is quasi-judicial in
nature, and therefore may be the subject of an appeal through a petition for review under Rule 43. (De Lima

the Republic of the Philippines (Republic) and
herein petitioners Narra Nickel Mining and
Development Corporation, Tesoro Mining and
Development, Inc., and McArthur Mining, Inc. on
the ground that more than 40% of the shares of
petitioners were owned by Canadian corporations.
Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration
before the OP but the same was denied.
Petitioners then went up to the Court of Appeals
by way of a petition for review under R43. Is R43
available to the Petitioners?
A.

No. The OP's cancellation and/or revocation of the
FTAA was not one which could be classified as an
exercise of its quasi-judicial authority, thus negating
the CA's jurisdiction over the case. The jurisdictional
parameter that the appeal be taken against a
judgment, finai order, resolution or award of a
"quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasijudicial functions" is explicitly stated in S1 R43.
Quasi-judicial or administrative adjudicatory
power is the power of the administrative agency to
adjudicate the rights of persons before it. With the
legal treatment and parameters of an FTAA in mind,
it becomes apparent that the OP's cancellation
and/or revocation of the FTAA is an exercise of a
contractual right that is purely administrative in
nature, and thus, cannot be treated as an
adjudication. As one of the contracting parties to
the FTAA, the OP could not have adjudicated on
the matter in which it is an interested party, as in a
court case where rights and duties of parties are
settled before an impartial tribunal. In a very loose
sense, the OP's cancellation/revocation may be
taken as a "decision" but only to the extent of
considering it as its final administrative action

internal to its channels. (Narra Nickel Mining &

Q.

May the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR) Secretary's act of approving
a mining company's application for a Mineral
Production Sharing Agreement and entering
into a MPSA with the mining company be
reviewed by the Court of Appeals under R43?

A.

No. R43 is applicable only to judgments, orders,
and issuances of a quasi-judicial body in the
exercise of its quasi-judicial functions. The act of the
DENR Secretary in approving SRMl's application
and entering into an MPSA with it is not an exercise
of its quasi-judicial power. Hence, it cannot be
reviewed by the CA, whether by a petition for review
under Rule 43 or a special civil action for certiorari
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court.
In the case of the DENR Secretary, its power
to approve and enter into a MPSA is unmistakably
administrative in nature as it springs from the
mandate of the DENR under the Revised
Administrative Code of 1987, which provides that
"[t]he [DENR] shall x x x be in charge of carrying
out the State's constitutional mandate to control
and supervise the exploration, development,
utilization, and conservation of the country's natural
resources." (Basiana Mining Exploration Corp. v.
Secretary of the DENR, 7 March 2016, Reyes, J.).

(PCHC), the PCHC ruled in favor of UOB.
Pursuant to the PCHC Rules, Metrobank filed a
Petition for Review with the Regional Trial Court
of Makati City. Did Metrobank avail of the
correct remedy?
A.

No. An arbitral award of the PCHC is appealable
not to the Regional Trial Court, but to the Court of
Appeals under R43. This notwithstanding that under
the PCHC ruies, such arbitral awards are
appealable to the RTC. Since the PCHC Rules
came about only as a result of an agreement
between and among member banks of PCHC and
not by law, it cannot confer jurisdiction to the RTC
over arbitral awards. (Metro Bank v. Court of
Appeals, 18 February 2009, Nachura, J.).

Rule 43
Appeals From Quasi-Judicial
Bodies To The Court Of Appels

A.

No. Article 82 of the Omnibus Investments Code of
1987 providing for direct appeal to the Supreme
Court is violative of Art. VI, Sec. 30 of the
Constitution which provides that "[n]o law shall be
passed increasing the appellate jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court as provided in this Constitution
without its advice and concurrence." Since Article
82 was enacted without the advice and
concurrence of the SC, the same never became
effective and did not amend Section 9 of B.P. Big.
129 which provides for the CA's appellate
jurisdiction over decisions of quasi-judicial bodies.
(First Lepanto Ceramics, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,
G.R. 110571, 7 October 1994, e.b.).

Voluntary Arbitrator
Q.

A dispute arose between Guagua National
Colleges (GNC) and its faculty and labor union
regarding the funding of the retirement plan out
of the tuition fee increase. The dispute was
submitted to voluntary arbitrator Froilan Bacungan
who rendered a decision. After receiving a copy
of the decision, the union filed with the Court of
Appeals a motion for a 15-day extension to file
their petition for review under R43. The CA
granted the motion and the union filed its
petition within the extended 15-day period.
GNC then filed its motion to dismiss, asserting
that the decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator had
already become final and executory pursuant to
Article 276 of the Labor Code which provides
that the award or decision of the voluntary
arbitrator shall be final and executory after ten
calendar days from receipt of the copy of the
award or decision by the parties. The CA denied
767

J9JC9B0M

the motion to dismiss. The denial of the motion
to dismiss was challenged by GNC before
the Supreme Court on a petition for certiorari
under R65.
a)

How should the conflict between R43 and
Article 276 of the Labor Code be resolved?

b) May the denial of the motion to dismiss be
set aside under R65?

A.
a) The 10-day period stated in Article 276 should
be understood as the period within which the
party adversely affected by the ruling of the
Voluntary Arbitrators or Panel of Arbitrators
may file a motion for reconsideration.
Only after the resolution of the motion for
reconsideration may the aggrieved party appeal
to the CA by filing the petition for review under
R43 within 15 days from notice pursuant to S4
R43. In effect, the SC held that the filing of a
motion for reconsideration is a condition
precedent for availing of R43.
b)

No. The denial of the motion to dismiss was not
made with grave abuse of discretion amounting
to lack of or excess of jurisdiction in view of the
conflicting jurisprudence on the matter and in
view of R43. ( Guagua National Colleges v. CA,
28 Aug 2018, e.b., Bersamin, J.).

Q.

Is the list of quasi-judicial agencies in 51 R43

Rule 43
Appeals From Quasi-Judicial
Bodies To The Court Of Appels

Q.

Are commercial arbitration awards reviewable
under Rule 43?

A.

No. A commercial arbitral tribunal does not exercise
quasi-judicial powers since it is not a creature of the
law but an ad hoc tribunal or a creature of contract.
(Fruehauf Electronics Phils. Corp. v. Technology
Electronics Assembly & Mgt. Pacific Corp., 23
November 2016, Brion, J.).

Q.

May the appeal raise questions of fact?

A.

Yes an appeal under R43 may involve questions
of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law.
(S3 R43).
However appeals from Construction Industry
Arbitration Commission (CIAC) awards may raise
only questions of law. R43 must be read together
with the Construction Industry Arbitration Law,
which provides that appeals of arbitral awards must
raise only questions of law. (Metro Bottled Water
Corp. v. Andrada Construction Corp., 6 March
2019, Leanen, J.).

Q.

What is the period of appeal?

A.

The appeal shall be taken within 15 days from
notice of the award, judgment, final order or
resolution, or from the date of its last publication, if
publication is required by law for its effectivity, or of
the denial of petitioner's motion for new trial or
reconsideration duly filed in accordance with the

Ombudsman
Q.

What is the remedy of an aggrieved party from a
decision of the Ombudsman in an administrative
disciplinary case?

A.

Petition for review to the Court of Appeals under
R43. Appeals from the decision of the Office of the
Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases
are no longer appealable to the Supreme Court.
(Fabian v. Desierto, GR. No. 129742, Sept. 16,
1998). However, the remedy of an aggrieved party
from a decision or order of the Office of the
Ombudsman in a criminal case is to file a petition
for certiorari before the SC. (Estrada v. Desierto,
445 SCRA 655 [2004]).
However the remedy from the Ombudsman's
ruling exonerating respondents from administrative
liability is not R43 (since such ruling is final &
unappealable) but R65. (Mandagan v. Dela Cruz, 8
October 2018, Perlas-Bernabe).

Q.

How is the appeal taken?

A.

Appeal is taken by filing a verified petition for
review in 7 copies with the CA, with proof of service
of a copy thereof on the adverse party and on the
court or agency a quo.
The petition shall be accompanied by a sworn
certification against forum shopping containing the
details in S2 R42 and shall state the specific
material dates showing that it was filed on time.

Q.

Should the court or agencies whose judgments

No, the petition for review shall not implead the

prosecuted manifestly for delay, or that the
questions raised therein are too unsubstantial

If upon the filing of the comment or such other
pleadings as the court may allow or require, or
after the expiration of the period for the filing
thereof without such comment or pleading
having been submitted, the CA finds prima
facie that the court or agency concerned has
committed errors of fact or law that would
warrant a reversal or modification of the award,
judgment, final order or resolution sought to be
reviewed, it may give due course to the petition;
otherwise it shall dismiss the same.

If the petition is given due course, the CA may
set the case for oral argument or require the
parties to submit memoranda. The case shall
be deemed submitted for decision upon the filing
of the last pleading or memorandum required by
the rules or by the Court of Appeals.

Q.

Will the appeal stay the award, judgment, final
order or resolution sought to be reviewed?

A.

No, unless the CA shall direct otherwise upon such
terms as it may deem just. (S12 R43). Compare
with S8(b) R42.

RULE 44. ORDINARY
APPEALED CASES (CA)
Q.

What cases are covered by R44?

A.

Ordinary appealed cases or those appealed to the
CA from a decision of the RTC in the exercise of its
original jurisdiction.

Q.

What are the rules governing the title of the
case and the designation of the parties?

A

The title of the case shall remain as it was in the
court of origin, but the party appealing the case
shall be further referred to as the appellant and the
adverse party as the appellee. Hence if the plaintiff
appeals, he shall be referred to as the plaintiffappellant while the defendant is referred to as the
defendant-appellee. If both appeal, the plaintiff will
be designated as the plaintiff-appellant while the
defendant is referred to as the defendant-appellant.

Q.

What is a cross-appeal?

A.

A cross-appeal is one wherein both parties have
appealed.

Q.

What are the papers to be filed by the parties in
an ordinary appeal?

A.

1) Appellant's brief. To be filed by the appellant
within 45 days from receipt of the notice of the
clerk that all the evidence, oral and documentary,
are attached to the record. There should be
proof of service of two copies upon the appellee.
773
J9JC9B0M

2)

Appellee's brief. To be filed by the appellee
within 45 days from receipt of the appellant's
brief, with proof of service of 2 copies thereof
upon the appellant.

3)

Reply brief. Within 20 days from receipt of the
appellee's brief, the appellant may file a reply
brief answering points in the appellee's brief not
covered in his main brief.

4)

Memorandum. In certiorari, prohibition, mandamus,
quo warranto and habeas corpus cases, the
parties shall file, in lieu of briefs, their respective
memoranda within a non-extendible period of 30
days from receipt of the notice issued by the clerk
that all the evidence, oral and documentary, is
already attached to the record.

Q.

May an appeal be withdrawn as a matter of right?

A.

An appeal may be withdrawn as a matter of right at
any time before the filing of the appellee's brief.
Thereafter the withdrawal may be allowed in the
court's discretion. (S3 R50).

Q.

Plaintiff filed with the RTC a case against the
Defendant. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss
on the ground of forum-shopping and improper
venue. The RTC granted the motion to dismiss
stating that there was indeed forum-shopping
but that venue was properly laid. Plaintiff
appealed to the Court of Appeals. In the CA, the
Defendant argued that the motion to dismiss
should also have been granted on the ground of
improper venue. The CA held that there was no
forum-shopping but stated that the case should
be dismiss on the ground of improper venue.
774

J9JC9B0M

Rule 44
Ordinary Appealed Cases (CA)

Was it correct for the CA to dismiss the case on
the ground of improper venue?
A.

No. An appellee can argue only to sustain the
judgment but not to impugn its correctness. Here
Appellee cannot raise improper venue on appeal as it
can argue only to sustain the judgment and not to
impugn its correctness. It was therefore reversible
error for CA to rule that the case should be dismissed
for improper venue. SC ordered remand to RTC.
(Cruz v MIAA, 9 Sep 2013, Perlas-Bernabe, J.)

Q.

Does the Court of Appeals have the power to try
cases and conduct hearings, receive evidence and
perform acts necessary to resolve factual issues?

A.

Under Section 9 of B.P. Big. 129, the Court of
Appeals has the power to try cases and conduct
hearings, receive evidence, and perform acts
necessary to resolve factual issues in cases falling
within its original and appellate jurisdiction,
including the power to grant and conduct new trials
or further proceedings.
The Supreme Court however has held that the
CA's power to receive evidence is qualified by the
CA's internal rules. Hence in accordance with such
rules, in appeals in civil cases, the CA may receive
evidence only when it grants a new trial based on
newly-discovered evidence. (Crispino v. Tansay, 5
Dec 2016, Leanen, J.).

RULE 45. APPEAL BY CERTIORARI TO
THE SUPREME COURT
Q.

What is a petition for review on certiorari?

A.

A petition for review on certiorari, also known as
appeal Supreme Court from a judgment or final order
of by certiorari, is a mode of appeal to the the:
1)

Court of Appeals.

2)

Sandiganbayan.

3)

Regional Trial Court, where the appeal raises
only questions of law.

4)

Court of Tax Appeals en bane. (Sec. 19, R.A.
1125 as amended by R.A. 9282).

It is initiated by the filing of a verified petition.

Note that an appeal to the Supreme Court may
be taken only by a petition for review on certiorari,
except in criminal cases where the penalty imposed
is reclusion perpetua, or life imprisonment. (S3
R56). A judgment imposing the death penalty is
subject to automatic review.
Q.

May a petition for review on certiorari raise
questions of fact?

A.

Generally, no. S1 R45 states that "[t]he petition
shall raise only questions of law which must be
776

J9JC9B0M

Rule 45
Appeal By Certiorari To
The Supreme Court

distinctly set forth." The exceptions wherein the
petition may raise questions of fact are:
1) An appeal from a final judgment or order in a
writ of amparo or writ of habeas data case may
be taken to the Supreme Court under Rule 45.
The appeal may raise questions of fact or law
or both. (Sec. 19, Rule on the Writ of Amparo;
Sec. 19, Rule on the Writ of Habeas Data).
2)

When the conclusion is grounded entirely on
speculation.

3)

The inference is manifestly mistaken, absurd or
impossible.

4)

There is grave abuse of discretion.

5)

The judgment is based on a misapprehension
of facts.

6)

The findings of facts are conflicting.

7)

The Court of Appeals, in making its findings
went beyond the issues of the case and the
same is contrary to the admissions of both
appellant and appellee.

8) The findings are contrary to those of the trial
court.
9)

The findings of fact are conclusions without
citations of specific evidence on which they are
based.

10) The facts set forth in the petition as well as in
the petitioner's main and reply briefs are not
disputed by the respondents.

Q.

Distinguish a Petition for Review on Certiorari
from a Special Civil Action for Certiorari.
(JNR FIRM)

A.

AS TO GOVERNING RULE. A petition for review
on certiorari is governed by Rule 45, while a special
civil action for certiorari is governed by Rule 65.
AS TO NATURE OF PROCEEDING. A petition
for review on certiorari is a mode of appeal, while a
special civil action for certiorari is an original action.
AS TO JURISDICTION. A petition for review
on certiorari is under the exclusive appellate
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, while a special
civil action for certiorari is under the concurrent
original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, the Court
of Appeals, and the Regional Trial Court,
Sandiganbayan, and COMELEC.
AS TO REQUIREMENT OF A MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION. A petition for review on
certiorari does not require the filing of a motion for
reconsideration with the lower court, while the filing of
a motion for reconsideration is a condition precedent
to the filing of a special civil action for certiorari.
AS TO REGLEMENTARY PERIOD. A petition
for review on certiorari should be filed within 15
days from notice of the judgment or final order
being appealed from, while a special civil action for
certiorari should be filed within 60 days from notice
of the judgment, order, or resolution.
778

J9JC9B0M

Rule 45
Appeal By Certiorari To ·
The Supreme Court

AS TO FINDINGS OF FACTS. Findings of facts
of the Court of Appeals are binding upon the
Supreme Court in a petition for review on certiorari,
while in a special civil action for certiorari, the findings
of fact of the Court of Appeals are not binding.
AS TO IMPLEADING OF PARTIES. In appeal
by certiorari, the lower courts or judges are whose
decisions are subject of review are not impleaded
either as petitioners or respondents, while in a
special civil action for certiorari, the lower court or
judge whose orders or proceedings are subject to
challenge are impleaded as public respondents.
Q.

What is the remedy from a decision or final
order issued by the Court of Appeals in a
petition for freeze order filed by the Anti-Money
Laundering Council?

A.

A petition for review on certiorari to the Supreme
Court under R45. Any. party aggrieved by the
decision or ruling of the court may appeal to the
Supreme Court by petition for review on certiorari
under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court. The appeal
shall not stay the enforcement of the subject
decision or final order unless the Supreme Court
directs otherwise. (Sec. 57, A.M. No. 05-11-04-SC,
eff. 15 December 2005).

Q.

Within what time may a petition for review on
certiorari be filed?

A.

The petition shall be filed within 15 days from notice
of the judgment or final order or resolution appealed
from, or of the denial of the petitioner's motion for
new trial or reconsideration filed in due time after
notice of the judgment. On motion duly filed and
served, with full payment of the docket and other
779

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

lawful fees and deposit for costs before the
expiration of the reglementary period, the Supreme
Court may for justifiable reasons grant an extension
of 30 days only within which to file the petition.
In an appeal from a writ of amparo or writ of
habeas data case, the appeal period is 5 working
days from the date of notice of the adverse
judgment or order. (S19, Rule on the Writ of
Amparo; S19 Rule on the Writ of Habeas Data).
Q.

P received an adverse decision of the CA on 2
September 2005. P thus had until 19 September
2005 within which to file his petition for review
on certiorari since 17 September 2005 was a
Saturday. On 16 September 2005 P filed a motion
for a 30-day extension to file his petition. The
same was granted by the SC. Up to when may P
file the petition?

A.

Up to 17 October 2005. A.M. No. 00-2-14-SC
provides that any extension of time granted by a
court should be computed from the expiration of the
original period, regardless of the fact that said
expiry date falis on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal
holiday. Hence the 30-day extension should be
reckoned from 17 September and not 19 September.

Q.

What are the contents of a petition for review on
certiorari?

A.

The petition shall:
1) State the full name of the appealing party as
the petitioner and the adverse party as the
respondent, without impleading the lower
courts or judges thereof either as petitioners or
respondents;
780

J9JC9B0M

Rule 45
Appeal By Certiorari To
The Supreme Court

2)

Indicate the material dates when notice of the
judgment or final order or resolution subject
thereof was received, when a motion for new
trial or reconsideration, if any, was filed and
when notice of the denial thereof was received;

3)

Set forth concisely a statement of the matters
involved, and the reasons or arguments relied
on for the allowance of the petition;

4)

Be accompanied by a clearly legible duplicate
original or a certified true copy of the judgment or
final order or resolution certified by the clerk of
court of the court a quo and the requisite number
of plain copies thereof, and such material portions
of the record as would support the petition;

5)

Contain a sworn certification against forum
shopping as provided in S2 42. (S4 R45).

Proof of service of a copy of the petition on the
lower court concerned and on the adverse party
shall be submitted together with the petition.
(S3 R45).
Q.

What are the grounds for the outright dismissal
or denial of the petition?

A.
1)

Failure of the petitioner to comply with the
requirements regarding payment of the docket
and other lawful fees, deposit for costs, proof of
service of the petition, and the contents of and
the documents which should accompany the
petition shall be a sufficient ground for the
dismissal thereof. Hence a petition which is not
verified or which contains a defective verification
may be dismissed outright.
781

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

2)

The Supreme Court may on its own
initiative deny the petition on the ground
that the appeal is without merit, or is
prosecuted manifestly for delay, or that
the questions raised therein are too
unsubstantial to require consideration.
(S5 R45). This is because review under
R45 is not a matter of right but of sound
judicial discretion, granted only when
there are special and important reasons
therefor. (S6 R45).

Q.

Is R45 applicableto both civil and criminal cases?

A.

Yes. The mode of appeal prescribed in R45 shall
be applicable to both civil and criminal cases,
except in criminal cases where the penalty imposed
is death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment.
(S9 R45). Hence if the judgment of the Court of
Appeals or the Sandiganbayan imposes the penalty
of reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, appeal
shall be taken by filing a notice of appeal. If the
Court of Appeals or Sandiganbayan imposes the
death penalty, the same shall be automatically
reviewed by the Supreme Court.

782
J9JC9B0M

RULE 46. ORIGINAL CASES
Q.

In original actions for certiorari, prohibition,
mandamus, and quo warranto, how does the
court acquire jurisdiction over the person of
the respondent?

A.

The court shall acquire jurisdiction over the
respondent's person by the service on him of its order.,
or resolution indicating its initial action on the petition
or by his voluntary submission to such jurisdiction.
(S4 R46). Service of the order or resolution upon the
party's counsel of record is deemed service upon
such party. This is true even if the counsel had
withdrawn but no notice of withdrawal was filed with
the court prior to the service of the order or resolution.
(Francisco v. Loyola Plans Consolidated Inc., 1
February 2016, Peralta, J.).

Q.

May the court dismiss outright a petition
for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, and quo
warranto?

A.

Yes, the court may dismiss the petition outright with
specific reasons for such dismissal or require the
respondent to file a comment on the same within
ten days from notice. Only pleadings required by
the court shall be allowed. (S5 R46).

783
J9JC9B0M

RULE 47. ANNULMENT OF JUDGMENTS
OR FINAL ORDERS AND RESOLUTIONS
Q.

What is the coverage of R47?

A.

R47 shall govern the annulment by the Court of
Appeals of judgments or final orders and resolutions
in civil actions of Regional Trial Courts for which the
ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for
relief or other appropriate remedies are no longer
available through no fault of the petitioner.

Q.

Plaintiffs spouses Domantay filed a petition for
consolidation against the defendants heirs of
spouses Alvarez. It was alleged that the
spouses Alvarez had executed a deed of sale
with right to repurchase over a parcel of land in
favor of the plaintiffs and that the defendants
had failed to repurchase the lot. Defendant Nora
Alvarez and some other defendants were not
served with summons. No answer having been
filed, a default judgment was rendered in favor
of the plaintiffs. No appeal or petition for relief
from the judgment was made. Subsequently
Nora Alvarez and Edwin Alvarez (an heir who
was not impleaded in the petition for consolidation)
filed a petition for annulment of the judgment
with the Court of Appeals. The spouses Domantay
argued that the petition should be dismissed
since there was no showing or allegation in the
petition that the ordinary remedies of new trial,
appeal, or petition for relief were no longer
available through no fault of Alvarez, as
required by 51 R47. Should the petition for
annulment of judgment be dismissed?
784

J9JC9B0M

Rule 47
Annulment Of Judgments Or
Final Orders And Resolutions
A.

No. In a case where a petition for the annulment of
a judgment or final order of the RTC filed under
R47 is grounded on lack of jurisdiction over the
person of the defendant/respondent or over the
nature or subject of the action, the petitioner need
not allege in the petition that the ordinary remedy of
new trial or reconsideration of the final order or
judgment or appeal therefrom ate no longer
available through no fault of her own. This is so
because a judgment rendered or final order issued
by the RTC without jurisdiction is null and void and
may be assailed any time either collaterally or in a
direct action or by resisting such judgment or final
order in any action or proceeding whenever it is
invoked, unless barred by laches.
Here the judgment is null and void for lack of
jurisdiction over the person of Nora Alvarez, no
summons having been served upon her. (Alvarez v.
Domantay, 3 June 2019, Reyes, J.). 131

Q.

Is Rule 47 applicable to criminal cases?

A.

No. S1 R47 limits the scope of the remedy of
annulment of judgment to civil actions. The remedy
cannot be resorted to when the RTC judgment
being questioned was rendered in a criminal case.
The 2000 Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure
itself does not permit such recourse, for it
excluded R47 from the enumeration in S18 R124 of
the provisions of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil
Procedure which have suppletory application to
criminal cases. (People v. Bitanga, 26 June 2007).

131
Note that Nora Alvarez is an indispensable party. Hence the failure to
serve summons upon her resulted in the judgment being void in toto and not only
insofar as Nora Alvarez was concerned. (See Pua v. Deyto, 26 November 2012).

Q.

Is a petition for annulment
of judgment
available against judgments or final orders of
quasiQjudicial bodies, such as the SEC?

A.

No. (Imperial v. Armes, 30 Jan 2017, Jardeleza, J.)

Q.

Which court has jurisdiction over an action for
annulment of a judgment?

A.

If the judgment is that of a RTC, then original and
exclusive jurisdiction lies with the Court of Appeals.
(S1 R47; Sec. 9[2], B.P. Big. 129). If the judgment
is that of the MTC, then the original and exclusive
jurisdiction lies with the RTC. (Sec. 19[6], B.P. Big.
129). An action to annul a judgment or final order
of a MTC shall be filed in the RTC having
jurisdiction over the MTC. (S10 R47).

Q.

The Republic filed with the RTC of Paranaque
City an action for reversion against Yujuico
involving a land in Paranaque with an assessed
value of more than PS0,000. The Republic
contended that the judgment of the CFI of
Pasig, acting as a land registration court, which
decreed the issuance of an OCT over the 'land is
a nullity since the land was under water and
thus part of the Manila Bay. Does the RTC have
jurisdiction over the action for reversion?

A.

No. Under B.P. Big. 129, the Court of Appeals has
exclusive original jurisdiction over actions for the
annulment of judgments of the RTC.
Here the action at bottom seeks to nullify the
judgment of the CFI, acting as a land registration
court, on the ground that a land registration court
cannot issue a title over property of the public
domain. Hence it is the Court of Appeals which has

786
J9JC9B0M

Rule 47
Annulment Of Judgments Or
Final Orders And Resolutions

jurisdiction pursuant to B.P. Big. 129 and R47 of
the Rules of Court. (Yujuico v. Republic, G.R. No.
168861, 26 October 2007).

Q.

The Republic filed with the RTC of Tanauan,
Batangas,
an action for reversion
and
cancellation of title against Malabanan (Civil
Case No. C-192). The Republic alleged that
Malabanan's TCT No. T-24268 had emanated
from Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 017421 of the Registry of Deeds of Batangas,
which was purportedly issued pursuant to
Decree No. 589383 in LR.A. Record No. 50573;
that upon verification, the Land Registration
Authority could not find any copy of the
judgment rendered in LRC Record No. 50573;
and that the tract of land covered by TCT No. T24268, being within the unclassified
public
forest, remained part of the public domain that
pertained to the State and could not be the
subject of disposition or registration.
Malabanan moved to dismiss Civil Case No.
C-192, arguing that the RTC had no jurisdiction
over the action because it sought the annulment
of the judgment and the decree issued in LRC
Record No. 50573 by the Court of First Instance,
and thus an action for annulment of judgment
under R47, the jurisdiction over which pertained
to the Court of Appeals pursuant to Yujuico v.
Republic. Should the motion to dismiss
be granted?

A.

No. The jurisdiction over an action for reversion is
with the RTC. The RTC may properly take
cognizance of reversion suits which do not call for

787
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

an annulment of judgment of the RTC acting as a
132
Land Registration Court.

Yujuico is not apropos since here the Republic
is not seeking seeking the annulment of the
judgment from which Decree No. 589383 was
derived inasmuch as such judgment did not exist
in the first piace. (Malabanan v. Republic, 19
September 2018, Perlas-Bernabe, J.).

Q.

Remedios, claiming that she is the adopted
daughter of the deceased Toribio, filed with the
RTC an action for partition of Toribio's estate.
Petitioner filed an answer alleging that Remedios
was not validly adopted as the adoption decree
issued by the then Court of First Instance (CFI)
was fraudulently secured. The RTC dismissed
the action for partition on the ground that
Remedios was not validly adopted. Did the
RTC act properly in dismissing the action on
that ground?

A.

No. The RTC did not have the jurisdiction to
determine or to review the validity of the decree of
adoption issued by the erstwhile CFI by virtue of
the equal rank and category between the RTC and
the CFI. The proper court with jurisdiction to do so
was the CA, which has been vested by Section 9 of
Batas Pambansa Big. 129 with the exclusive original
jurisdiction over actions for the annulment of the
judgments of the RTC. (Oribello v. CA, 5 August
2015, Bersamin, j,)

132
The decision cited Section 19(2) of B.P. Big. 129 as the basis of the
RTC's jurisdiction where the assessed value of the real property exceeded
P20,000. It is submitted that the more precise basis of the RTC's jurisdiction is
Sec. 44(e) of the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1948 and thus the RTC would
have jurisdiction over aciions for reversion regardless of the assessed value of
the property.

788

J9JC9B0M

Rule 47
Annulment Of Judgments Or
Final Orders And Resolutions

Q.

What are the grounds for the annulment of a
judgment under R47?

A.

The annulment may be based only on the grounds
of extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction. Extrinsic
fraud shall not be a valid ground if it was availed of,
or could have been availed of, in a motion for new
trial or petition for relief. (S2 R47).
Jurisprudence also recognizes denial of due
process as an additional ground. Where a court
approved a commissioner's project of partition
when only three of the nine heirs were notified of
the meeting to discuss the project, the aggrieved
heirs could resort to R47 in order to nullify the
court's order of approval. (Benatiro v. Heirs of
Cuyos, 560 SCRA 478 [2008]).

Q.

What does lack of jurisdiction in 52 R47 mean?

A.

Lack of jurisdiction in S2 R47 involves the want of
jurisdiction over the person of the defending party
or over the subject matter of the case. It does not
refer to cases where the court has personal or
subject-matter jurisdiction but acted beyond such
jurisdiction. (Teano v. Municipality of Navotas, 15
February 2016).

Q.

What is the period for filing the action for
annulment of judgment under R47?

A.

1)

If based on extrinsic fraud, the action must be
filed within 4 years from its discovery.

2)

If based on lack of jurisdiction, the action is
imprescriptible and may be filed at any time
789

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

unless it is barred by laches or estoppel.
(S3 R47).
The action is commenced by the filing of a
verified petition alleging the matters set forth in S4
R47. It shall be accompanied by a certification
against forum shopping.
Q.

Is it necessary in R47 that one be a party to the
judgment sought to be annulled?

A.

No. One need not be a party to the judgment
sought to be annulled. What is essential is that he
can prove his allegation that the judgment was
obtained by the use of fraud and collusion and he
would be adversely affected thereby. Even where
there was no fraud and collusion, however, the
Supreme Court has allowed persons to file petitions
for annulment of judgment to question precisely
their non-inclusion as parties to the original case.
(Intestate Estate of the Sian v. Philippine National
Bank, 513 SCRA 662, 671 [2007])

Q.

Due to Philip's abuse and sexual infidelity,
Viveca abandoned their conjugal dwelling in
Pasig City together with her children. Viveca
filed a petition for legal separation against her
husband Philip. In the petition for legal separation,
Viveca revealed that she residing at her parents'
house in Mandaluyong City. Subsequently Viveca
went to the U.S.A. with her children and lived
there. Philip filed an action for declaration of
nullity of his marriage with Viveca before the
RTC of Balayan, Batangas. Philip moved for
leave to effect extraterritorial service under S17
R14. Philip stated in his Petition and motion that
the last known address of Viveca was at their

790
J9JC9B0M

Rule 47
Annulment Of Judgments Or
Final Orders And Resolutions

conjugal home in Pasig City. Summons was
served by publication and a copy of the
summons and court order was sent by registered
mail to the indicated last known address.
Viveca was unaware of the petition for
declaration of nullity and the later judgment of
the court nullifying her marriage with Philip.
She filed an action for annulment of judgment
under R47 on the ground of extrinsic fraud. Will
the action for annulment of judgment prosper?
A.

Yes. There was extrinsic fraud committed by Philip
when he indicated the last known address of
Viveca as their conjugal home when she had
already abandoned it and when she had already
moved in with her parents in Mandaluyong City.
Clearly there was an intent on the part of Philip to
prevent Viveca from acquiring knowledge of the
nullity case and depriving her of her day in court.
The judgment of the Batangas court should be
annulled on the ground of extrinsic fraud. (Yu v. Yu,
20 June 2016, Peralta, J.).

Q.

Tom Wallis filed with the Regional Trial Court
(RTC) a Petition for Declaration of Nullity of his
marriage with Debi Wallis on the ground of
psychological incapacity of the latter. Before
filing the petition, Tom Wallis had told Debi
Wallis that he wanted the annulment of their
marriage because he was already fed up with
her irrational and eccentric behaviour. However,
in the petition for declaration of nullity of
marriage, the correct residential address of

instead, the residential address of their married
son was stated. Summons was served by

REMEDIAL LAW

petition. For failure to file an answer, Debi
Wallis was declared in default and Tom Wallis
presented evidence ex-parte. The RTC rendered
judgment declaring the marriage null and void
on the ground of psychological incapacity of
Debi Wallis. Three (3) years after the RTC
judgment was rendered, Debi Wallis got hold of
a copy thereof and wanted to have the RTC
judgment reversed and set aside. If you are the
lawyer of Debi Wallis, what judicial remedy or
remedies will you take? Discuss and specify the
ground or grounds for said remedy or remedies.
(14 Bar Q20)

A.

If I were the lawyer of Debi Wallis, the judicial
remedy I would take is to file with the Court of
Appeals an action for annulment of the RTC
judgment under R47. An action for annulment of
judgment may be resorted to since the remedies of
appeal and petition for relief are no longer available
through no fault of Debi Wallis. [S1 R47]
The grounds for annulment of judgment would
be lack of jurisdiction and extrinsic fraud. Lack of
jurisdiction also covers lack of jurisdiction over the
person of the defendant since the judgment would
be void. [1 FLORENZ D. REGALADO, REMEDIAL
LAW COMPENDIUM 558 (?'h rev. ed., 3rdprinting)]
Here the court did not acquire jurisdiction over
the person of Debi since there was no valid
substituted service of summons. Substituted service
of summons should have been made at Debi's
residence. (S7 R14). Hence the judgment of the RTC
was void. Since the judgment is void, the petition for
annulment thereof is imprescriptible. (S3 R47).

Also there was extrinsic fraud when Tom
deliberately indicated a wrong address for Debi
thus preventing her from having her day in court
and contesting Tom's petition. [See Yu v. Yu, 20
June 2016]
Q.

In 2001 Private Respondent filed with the RTC a
petition for issuance of new owner's duplicate
title alleging the loss of his owner's duplicate
title. The RTC issued an order for the issuance
of a new owner's duplicate in the name of the
Private Respondent. Since no appeal was made,
the judgment was entered in the book of entries.
Private Respondent then sold the property to a
Mr. Marty. The Private Respondent's title was
cancelled and a new TCT issued in the name of
Mr. Marty. Later the Petitioners who had bought
the property of the Private Respondent in 1986
and were in possession of the property, filed
with the Court of Appeals an action to annul the
RTC's judgment on the ground that the
duplicate title was not lost but was in their
possession after it had been delivered by the
late spouse of the Private Respondent in 1986.
The Court of Appeals denied the petition on the
ground that the RTC had jurisdiction to issue
the order and that the Petitioners did not
acquire any vested right since the sale in their
favor was not registered. May the RTC's
decision be nullified under R47?

A.

Yes. The RTC has no jurisdiction to issue an order
for the issuance of new owner's duplicate title if the
owner's duplicate title was not actually lost but was
in the possession of a person who had bought the
property. The order of the RTC may be set aside
under R47 of the Rules of Court and cannot

793

become final and executory as the order is void for
lack of jurisdiction, (Villanueva v. Viloria, G.R. No.
155804, 14 March 2008).
Q.

Plaintiff sued Defendant for collection of a
P45,000 loan plus interest of 12% per annum
from 2 March 1991 until full payment.
Defendant's counsel did not file an answer and
Defendant was accordingly declared in default.
After Plaintiff presented his evidence ex parte,
the RTC rendered judgment ordering Defendant
to pay Plaintiff P45,000 plus interest of 5% per
month from 2 March 1991 until full payment.
Defendant's counsel failed to file an appeal in
behalf of his client. Subsequently Defendant
filed a petition for annulment of judgment
regarding the portion thereof that awarded 5%
per month interest rather than 12% per annum
interest. The Plaintiff contends that the judgment
has already become final and executory and
that there are only two grounds for a petition for
annulment, that Is, extrinsic fraud and lack of
jurisdiction, none of which is present. The
Plaintiff also argues that the remedy of annulment
of judgment is not available to Defendant since
the remedy of appeal was no longer available
because of Defendant's fault. May the petition
for annulment of judgment prosper?

A.

Yes. A petition for annulment of judgment is an
exception to the final judgment rule, which states
that final and executory judgments can no longer
be set aside.
While under S2 R47 a Petition for Annulment
of Judgment may be based only on the grounds of
extrinsic fraud and lack of jurisdiction, jurisprudence
794

Rule 47
Annulment Of Judgments Or
Final Orders And Resolutions

recognizes lack of due process as additional
ground to annul a judgment. A final and executory
judgment may still be set aside if, upon mere
inspection thereof, its patent nullity can be shown
for having been issued without jurisdiction or for
lack of due process of law. Here the grant of 5%
monthly interest is way beyond the 12% per annum
interest sought in the Complaint and smacks of
violation of due process. The reason is that under
S3(d) R9, a judgment rendered against a party in
default shall not exceed the amount or be different
in kind from that prayed for.
While S1 R47 requires that annulment of
judgment may be availed of in instances where the
ordinary remedies of new trial, appeal, petition for
relief or other appropriate remedies are no longer
available through no fault of the petitioner, the
Plaintiff may be excused here since the remedy of
appeal was not lost due to his fault but to the fault
of his lawyer who was grossly negligent. The
lawyer's gross negligence started from his failure to
file an answer right up to his failure to file an
appeal. Defendant cannot be blamed for relying too
much on his former counsel. Clients have reasonable
expectations that their lawyer would amply protect
their interest during the trial of the case. Here
Defendant is a plain and ordinary person who is
totally ignorant of the intricacies and technicalities
of law and legal procedures. Being so, he
completely relied upon and trusted his former
counsel to appropriately act as his interest may
lawfully warrant and require. (Diana v. Balangue, 7
January 2013, Del Castillo, J.).

Q.

May the Court of Appeals dismiss outright a
petition for annulment of judgment?

A.

Yes. Should the Court of Appeals find no
substantial merit in the petition, the same may be
dismissed outright with specific reasons for such
dismissal. (S5 R47), Take note however that S5
R47 is not applicable to annulment of judgments or
final orders of the MTG. (S10 R47). Hence the
RTC cannot dismiss outright the action if it finds no
substantial merit in the action.

Q.

What action is taken by the court if it finds
prima facie merit in the petition?

A.

The court shall give due course to the petition
and summons shall be served on the respondent/s.
(S5 R47).

Q.

What is the procedure to be observed under R47?

A.

The procedure in ordinary civi! cases shall be
observed. Should El trial be necessary before the
Court of Appeals, the reception of the evidence
may be referred to a member of the CA or a judge
of the RTC. (S6 R47).

Q.

What is the effect of a judgment of annulment
under R47?

A.

The judgment of annulment shall set aside the
questioned judgment or final order or resolution and
render the same null and void, without prejudice to
the original action being refiled in the proper court.
However, where the judgment or final order or
resolution is set aside on the ground of extrinsic
fraud, the court may on motion order the trial court
to try the case as if a timely motion for new trial had
been granted therein. (S7 R47).
796

J9JC9B0M

Rule 47
Annulment Of Judgments Or

The prescriptive period for the refiling of the
original action shall be deemed suspended from the
filing of such original action until the finality of the
judgment of annulment. The exception would be
where the extrinsic fraud is attributable to the.,
plaintiff in the original action. (S8 R47).

Q.

Aside from the annulment of the judgment, final
order, or resolution, what other relief is
available under R47?

A.

The judgment of annulment may include the award
of damages, attorney's fees, and other relief.
If the questioned judgment or final order or
resolution had already been executed, the court
may issue such orders of restitution or other relief
as justice and equity may warrant under the
circumstances. (S9 R39).

Q.

Teodora Salera borrowed P350,000 from A-1
Investors Inc. As the loan remained unpaid for
a long time, A-1 filed an action for collection
with the MeTC of Quezon City against Teodora,
impleading her husband Saturnino pursuant to
S4 R3. Summons was served on Teodora's son
at the family's residential house in Cebu City.
Subsequently a default judgment was entered
against Teodora and Saturnino and the sheriff
levied upon the house. Saturnino then filed with
the RTC of Cebu City an action for injunction
with prayer for TRO and preliminary injunction
seeking to restrain the judicial sale of the
property. In his complaint, Saturnino alleges
that he was not properly served with summons
and was denied due process.

797

REMEDIAL LAW

(a) Did Saturnino avail of the proper remedy?
(b) May the RTC of Cebu City nonetheless treat
the action for injunction as one for
annulment of judgment and take cognizance
of the same?
A.
(a) No. Saturnina sought to permanently enjoin the
public auction of property levied pursuant to a writ
of execution issued in the MeTC case on the
ground that he was not served with summons
and was denied due process. In doing
so, Saturnina was actually seeking the annulment
of the MeTC decision for lack of jurisdiction or for
extrinsic fraud. The proper remedy for Saturnino's
predicament is therefore not an action for
injunction, but for annulment of judgment.
(b) No. Even if we were to treat the action before the
RTC of Cebu City as an action for annulment
rather than for injunction, said RTC could not take
cognizance of the same. S10 R47 provides that
an action to annul a judgment or final order of an
MTC shall be filed in the RTC having jurisdiction
over the former. It is therefore the RTC
of Quezon City which has jurisdiction over a case
seeking annulment of the final decision of the
Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City. (Salera

RULE 51. JUDGMENT
Q.

Petitioner Multi-Realty Development Corporation
is the developer of the Makati Tuscany
Condominium. In 1975, the Master Deed over
the condominium was executed. Multi-Realty
Development Corporation was of the impression
that it was the owner of the unassigned parking
lots
and the
Respondent
condomimium
corporation seemed to think likewise since it
even offered to buy some of the parking lots. In
1989 however the Respondent claimed ownership
of the unassigned parking lot and it was then
that the Petitioner discovered that the Master
Deed did not indicate the ownership of the
unassigned lots. In 1990 Petitioner filed an
action for reformation of instrument against the
Respondent. The RTC ruled in favor of the
Petitioner but on appeal the CA reversed the
RTC holding that the Petitioner's action had
already prescribed. The issue of prescription
was not raised before the lower court nor even
before the CA on appeal. Was it proper for the
CA to rule that the action had prescribed?

A.

No. Settled is the rule that no questions will be
raised on appeal unless they have been raised
below. Points of law, theories, issues and arguments
not adequately brought to the attention of the lower
court need not be considered by the reviewing
court as they cannot be raised for the first time on
appeal. Basic considerations of due process impel
this rule. Also under S8 R51 no error which was not
assigned and argued in the brief may be

considered on appeal. (Multi-Realty Dev't Corp. v.
Makati Tuscany Condominium Corp., G.R. 146726,
16 June 2006).
Q.

What errors may be passed upon on appeal?
(JA VP)

A.

1) Those assigned as errors closely related to or
dependent on an assigned error.
2)

Those which affect subject-matter jurisdiction
or the validity of the judgment.

3)

Plain and clerical errors. (S8 R51; S4 R56).

Q.

In an appeal from the MTC to the RTC under
R40, may the RTC pass upon errors which were
not assigned or errors which are not closely
related or dependent on an assigned error?

A.

Yes. S8 R51 does not apply to appeal under R40
because of S7(c) R40 which provides that the RTC
shall decide the case on the basis of the entire
record of the proceedings had in the court of origin
and such memoranda as are filed. (Adora v.

the CA while the bank and D did not. In its
decision, the CA modified the RTC judgment by
deleting the award of damages against D.
Although D did not appeal, it was argued that
the issue concerning D's liability is closely
related to the error assigned by T concerning
the bank's liability. Did the CA act properly in
deleting the award of damages against D?

A.

No. It should be noted that D did not appeal. The
exception to the general rule which states that an
unassigned error may be considered if closely
related to or dependent on an assigned error is for
the benefit of the appellant and not of the appellee.
(Hiponia-Mayuga v. Metro Bank, 22 June 2015,
Mendoza, J. ).

Q.

What is the harmless error rule?

A.

The rule which provides that no error in either the
admission or the exclusion of evidence and no error
or defect in any ruling or order or in anything done
or omitted by the trial court or by any of the parties
is ground for granting a new trial or for setting
aside, modifying; or otherwise disturbing a judgment
or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to
the court inconsistent with substantial justice. The
court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard
any error or defect which does not affect the
substantial rights of the parties. (S6 R51).
For example an error by the court in admitting
hearsay evidence is harmless if there are other
pieces of evidence sufficient to support the
judgment rendered by it.

Q.

MIS Maritime Corporation (MIS) engaged
Tsuneishi Heavy Industries to dry dock and
repair its vessels. The vessel was dry-docked
and repaired and returned to MIS but it refused
to pay the service and repair fee to Tsuneishi
stating that the latter had damaged the vessel
during repair and demanding set-off for the
damage caused by the faulty repair and the
delay in the return of the vessel.

In
April
2008,
Tsuneishi
filed
a
complaint against MIS before the RTC. This
complaint stated that it is invoking the admiralty

808
J9JC9B0M

Rule 57
Preliminary Attachment

jurisdiction of the RTC to enforce a maritime
lien under Section 21 of the Ship Mortgage
Decree. It also alleged as a cause of action MIS'
unjustified refusal to pay the amount it owes
Tsuneishi under their contract. The complaint
included a prayer for the issuance of arrest
order/writ of preliminary attachment. To support
this prayer, the complaint alleged that Section
21 of the Ship Mortgage Decree as well as R57
on attachment authorize the issuance of an
order of arrest of vessel and/or writ of
preliminary attachment. Is a maritime lien in
favor of the applicant a ground for the issuance
of a writ of preliminary attachment?
A.

No. A maritime lien exists in accordance with the
provision of the Ship Mortgage Decree. It is
enforced by filing a proceeding in court. When a
maritime lien exists, this means that the party in
whose favor the lien was established may ask the
court to enforce it by ordering the sale of the
subject property and using the proceeds to settle
the obligation.
On the other hand, a writ of preliminary
attachment is issued precisely to create a lien.
Hence, where a lien already exists, as in this case
a maritime lien, the same is already equivalent
to an attachment.
Clearly, because it claims a maritime lien in
accordance with the Ship Mortgage Decree, all
Tsuneishi had to do is to file a proper action in court
for its enforcement. The issuance of a writ of
preliminary attachment on the pretext that it is the
only means to enforce a maritime lien is
superfluous. The reason that the Ship Mortgage

809
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Decree does not provide for a detailed procedure
for the enforcement of a maritime lien is because it
is not necessary. Section 21 already provides for
the simple procedure-file an action in rem before
the court (Tsuneishi Heavy Industries v. MIS
Maritime Corp,, 4 April 2018, Jardeleza, J.).
Q.

May an order of attachment issue ex parte?

A.

Yes pursuant to S2 R57. However the court may in
its sound discretion require that the application for
preliminary attachment be made by motion with
notice and hearing to the adverse party.

Q.

What is the reason for allowing the ex parte
issuance of an order of preliminary attachment?

A.

To avoid the possibility of the adverse party
disposing of his property or absconding while the
application is being heard. (Davao Light & Power
Co. v. Court of Appeals, 204 SCRA 343).

Q.

Give the stages of a preliminary attachment as
set forth in R57. (FOBOER)

A.
1)

Filing of the application for issuance of writ of
preliminary attachment in the form of an affidavit.

2)

Court issues the order granting the application.
The order fixes the amount of the attachment
bond (S4 R57) but does not yet require the
sheriff to attach the property of the person
against whom it is issued.

3)

The applicant must thereafter file the attachment
bond in the amount fixed by the court.

810

Rule 57
Preliminary Attachment

4)

The court issues the order of attachment, witty
corresponding writ of attachment, requiring the
sheriff to attach the properties of the adverse
party as may be sufficient to satisfy the
applicant's demand. Several writs may be
issued at the same time to the sheriffs of the
courts of different judicial regions.

5)

The writ of attachment is enforced by the sheriff
pursuant to S5&7 R57.

6)

After enforcing the writ, the sheriff must make a
return thereon to the court from which the writ
issued. (S6 R57).

Q.

What does the order of attachment require the
sheriff to do?

A.

The order of attachment must require the sheriff of
the court to attach so much of the property in the
Philippines of the party against whom it is issued,
not exempt from execution, as may be sufficient to
satisfy the applicant's demand.

Q.

What are the requirements for the issuance of
an order of attachment? (AB)

A.

1) AFFIDAVIT. Affidavit of the applicant, or of
some other person who personally knows the
facts that: (COSA)
a)

A sufficient _gauseof action exists,

b) The case is Qneof those mentioned in S1 R57,
c)

There is no other sufficient 2ecurity for
the claim sought to be enforced by the
action, and

d)

2)

The §.mount due to the applicant, or the
value of the property the possession of
which he is entitled to recover, is (deducting
all legal counterclaims) as much as the
sum for which the order is granted.

APPLICANT'S BOND OR ATTACHMENT
BOND. A bond executed to the adverse party
in the amount fixed by the court in its order
granting the issuance of the writ, conditioned
that the applicant will pay all the costs which
may be adjudged to the adverse party and fill
damages which the adverse party may sustain
by reason of the attachment, if the court shall
finally adjudge that the applicant was not
entitled to the attachment (S4 R57).

The affidavit and the bond must be duly filed
with the court before the order of attachment
issues. (S3 R57).
Q.

A verified complaint with prayer for preliminary
attachment contained the allegations required
under S4 R57 but without a separate affidavit.
The trial court denied the application for
preliminary attachment on the ground that there
was no affidavit. Was the denial correct?

A,

No. It is well-settled that a verified statement
incorporated in the complaint alleging thE3mattei:s - under S4 R57 even without a separate affidavit is
sufficient and valid to obtain a preliminary
attachment. (Manacop v. Court of Appeals, G.R.
No. 104875, 13 November 1992). Moreover, a
verification itself is an affidavit. (Dela Rosa v.
Carlos, G.R. No. 147549, 23 October 2003). S4 R7
provides that "[a] pleading is verified by an affidavit
812

J9JC9B0M

Rule 57
Preliminary Attachment

that the affiant has read the pleading and that the
allegations therein are true and correct of his personal
knowledge or based on authentic records."
Q.

Is attachment available to a mortgagee in an
action to recover the mortgage debt wher~ any
one of the grounds in S1 R57 exists?

A.

Generally no, for a requirement of the issuance of
an order of attachment is that "[t]here is no other
sufficient security for the claim sought to be
enforced by the action." However in the following
instances attachment is available to the mortgagee.
1) When the mortgagee abandons his security
and brings an ordinary action for recovery of
the debt, in which case he may cause
attachment to be levied upon the very property
on which the mortgage was constituted.
(Pepperel v. Taylor, 5 Phil. 536).
2)

In foreclosure proceedings, if the mortgagee
shows by affidavit or otherwise that the proceeds
from the sale of the property mortgaged would
not be sufficient to pay the mortgage debt. (De
/os Reyes v. CF/ of Batangas, 55 Phil. 408).

Q.

What is the manner by which the sheriff shall
attach property?

A.

The sheriff enforcing the writ shall without delay
and with all reasonable diligence attach, to await
judgment and execution in the action, only so much
of the property in the Philippines of the party
against whom the writ is issued, not exempt from
execution. (S5 R57).

Q.

What are the requirements for the enforcement
of a levy on attachment?

A.

No levy on attachment shall be enforced unless it is
preceded or contemporaneously accompanied by
service of summons together with (CABAWO) a
copy of the _gomplaint, the 2 pplication for
attachment, the applicant's 2 ffidavit and .!2.ond,and
the Qrder and writ of attachment, on the defendant

Q.

What are the exceptions to the requirement of
prior or contemporaneous service of summons?

A.

The requirement of prior or contemporaneous
service of summons shall not apply where: (SNIT)

Q.

1)

The summons could not be §.erved personally
or by substituted service despite diligent efforts.

2)

The defendant is a Philippine resident temporarily
absent therefrom.

3)

The defendant is a non-resident of the Philippines.

4)

The action is one in rem or quasi in rem. (S5
R57).

Perpetual Lumber, the supplier of construction
materials of Acme Builders, which has a
running account with the former, was paid by
the latter P500,000 in check. The check bounced
due to closed account. Despite timely written
notice of dishonor, Acme refused to pay
Perpetual. Hence, Perpetual filed a collection
suit against Acme and simultaneously applied
ex parte for a writ of attachment on the ground
of fraud. No service of summons and complaint
was made upon Acme Builders.

Preliminary Attachment

a)

Could the judge grant the application for
writ of attachment based on the ground
cited by Perpetual?

b)

Assume that the application was granted.
Could the sheriff forthwith proceed to levy
on the properties of Acme?

a)

Yes. Under the 1997 Rules (Sec. 1[d], Rule
57), the grounds cover not only fraud in
contracting the debt but also to fraud in the
performance of the obligation.

b)

No. No levy on attachment shall be enforced
unless it is preceded or contemporaneously
accompanied by service of summons, together
with a copy of the complaint, the application for
attachment, the applicant's affidavit and bond,
and the order and writ of attachment. (S5 R57).

Q.

Katy filed an action against Tyrone for
collection of P1 million in the RTC with an ex
parte application for a writ of preliminary
attachment.
Upon posting of the attachment
bond, the court granted the application and
issued a writ of preliminary attachment.
Apprehensive that Tyrone might withdraw his
savings deposit with the bank, the sheriff
immediately served a notice of garnishment on the
bank to implement the writ of preliminary
attachment. The following day, the sheriff
proceeded to Tyrone's house and served him the
summons, with copies of the complaint containing
the application for writ of preliminary attachment,

815
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Katy's affidavit, order of attachment, writ of
preliminaryattachment, and attachment bond.
Within 15 days from service of summons,
Tyrone filed a motion to dismiss and to dissolve
the writ of preliminary attachment on the
following grounds: (i) the court did not acquire
jurisdiction over his person because the writ
was served ahead of the summons; (ii) the writ
was improperly implemented; and (iii) said writ
was improvidently issued because the obligation
in question was already fully paid. Resolve the
motion with reasons. (05 Bar Q7)

A.

The motion to dismiss and to dissolve the writ of
preliminary attachment should be denied.
The motion to dismiss on the ground that the
court did not acquire jurisdiction over Tyrone's
person because the writ was served ahead of the
summons should be denied. The trial court already
acquired jurisdiction over Tyrone upon the service
of the summons upon him. Any irregularity in the
service of the writ of attachment would only affect
the enforceability of the attachment but has no
effect on the acquisition of jurisdiction over Tyrone's
person since preliminary attachment is only ancillary
to the main action.
The motion to dissolve the writ on the ground
that the same was improperly implemented should
be denied. The improper implementation of the writ
does not affect the validity of the writ itself although
it affects the validity of the enforcement of the writ.
(See Oflate v. Abrogar, G.R. No. 107303, 23
February 1995). The proper remedy for Tyrone is to
file a motion to discharge the attachment on his
816

J9JC9B0M

Rule 57
Preliminary Attachment

bank deposit on the ground that the attachment was
irregularly or improperly enforced. Under S13 R57 an
attachment may be discharged on the ground that the
same was improperly or irregularly enforced. Here the
attachment was improperly or irregularly enforced
since the notice of garnishment was served on the
bank without any prior or contemporaneous service of
summons. The subsequent service of summons does
not cure the invalidity of the garnishment of the
bank deposit. (Onate v. Abrogar, G.R. No. 107303,
23 February 1995).
The motion to dissolve the writ on the ground
of payment should also be denied. It is not proper
to move for the dissolution of a writ on the ground
of payment. Such a ground should be raised in a
motion to dismiss or in the answer as an affirmative
defense. In both cases, Tyrone should adduce
evidence of the fact of payment. For the court to
dissolve the writ of preliminary attachment on the
ground of payment would be tantamount to
resolving the main action already. (See Davao Light
& Power Co. v. Court of Appeals, 204 SCRA 343).
Q.

In a case for sum of money, the trial court
granted ex parte the prayer for issuance of a
writ of preliminary attachment. The writ was
immediately implemented by the sheriff. The
defendant filed a motion to discharge the writ of
preliminary attachment on the ground that it
was issued and implemented prior to service of
summons. Plaintiffs opposed arguing that under
the Rules of Court, the writ can be applied for
and granted at the commencement of the action
or at any time thereafter. In any event, plaintiff
argues that the summons which was eventually
served cured whatever irregularities that might
817

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

have attended the enforcement of the writ. How
would you rule on the conflicting contentions of
the parties? (96 Bar Q9.4).
A.

I would rule on the conflicting contentions of the
parties as follows.
The defendant's ground that the writ of
attachment was issued prior to service of summons
was not meritorious since the writ can be applied
for and granted at the commencement of the
action. (S1 R57). The ground however that the writ
was implemented prior to the service of summons
is meritorious since the enforcement of the writ as a
rule can only be done after or during the service of
summons. (S5 R57).
The plaintiff's argument that the eventual
service of summons cured the irregularity in the
enforcement is without merit. The Supreme Court
has held that the subsequent service of summons
will not cure the irregularities that attended the
enforcement of the writ. ( Onate v. Abrogar, 23
February 1995).
I would grant the defendant's motion. Since
the attachment was improperly or irregularly
enforced, it may be discharged. (S13 R57).
Properly speaking what should be discharged is the
attachment, i.e., the enforcement of the writ, not the
writ of attachment itself which was validly issued.
This semantic imperfection should be overlooked
and defendant's motion treated as one to discharge
the attachment rather than the writ of attachment.

Q.

A sues B for collection of a sum of money.
Alleging fraud in the contracting of the loan, A
applies for preliminary attachment with the
818

Rule 57
Preliminary Attachment

court. The Court issues the preliminary
attachment after A files a bond. While summons
on B was yet unserved, the sheriff attached B's
properties. Afterwards, summons was duly
served on B. B moves to lift the attachment.
Rule on this. (12 Bar Essay Q8a)

A.

Motion to lift attachment granted. The rule is that an attachment cannot be enforced unless done prior to
or simultaneous with the service of summons and
other accompanying papers. (S5 R57).
Here the summons was not yet served at the
time of the attachment. The subsequent service of
summons will not cure the irregularities that
attended the enforcement of the writ. ( Onate v.
Abrogar, 23 February 1995).

Q.

Outline the manner by which the sheriff shall
attach real and personal property.

A.
1)

Rea/ property, or growing crops thereon, or any
interest therein. This is attached by filing with
the registry of deeds a copy of the order of
attachment, together with a description of the
property attached and a notice that it is
attached, and by leaving a copy of such order,
description, and notice with the occupant of the
property. Note that even if the real property is
not registered with the registry of deeds, the
attachment may be registered pursuant to Sec.
113(d) of P.O. No. 1529.

2)

Personal property capable of manual delivery.~
Attached by taking and safely keeping it in his

819
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

custody, after issuing the corresponding receipt
therefor.
3)

Stocks or shares in a company. Attached by
leaving with the president or managing agent
thereof, a copy of the writ, and a notice stating
that the stock or interest of the party against
whom the attachment is issued is attached in
pursuance of such writ.

4)

Debts and credits, and other personal property
not capable of manual delivery. Debts and
credits, including bank deposits, financial interest,
royalties, commissions and other personal
property not capable of manual delivery, are
attached by leaving with the person owing such
debts, or having in his possession or under his
control, such credits or other personal property,
or with his agent, a copy of the writ, and notice
that the debts owing by him to the party against
,,vhom attachment is issued, and the credits and
other personal property in his possession, or
under his control, belonging to said party, are
attached in pursuance of the writ.

5)

Interest in estate of the decedent. Attached by
serving the executor or administrator or other
personal representative of the decedent with a
copy of the writ and notice that said interest is
attached. A copy of the writ and notice shall
also be filed in the office of the clerk of the
court in which said estate is being settled and
served upon the heir, legatee or devisee
concerned. (S7 R57).

820
J9JC9B0M

Rule 57
Preliminary Attachment

Q.

May property in custodia /egis be attached?

A. · Yes. In such a case, a copy of the writ of attachment
shall be filed with the proper court or quasi-judicial
agency, and notice of the attachment served upon the
custodian of such property. (S7 R57).

Q.

What is the effect of attachment of debts,
credits and all other similar personal property
(garnishment)?

A.

All persons having in their possession or under
their control any credits or other similar personal
property belonging to the party against whom
attachment is issued, or owing any debts to him, at
the time of service upon them of the copy of the writ
of attachment and notice as provided in S7(d) R57,
shall be liable to the applicant for the amount of
such credits, debts or other similar personal
property, until the attachment is discharged, or any
judgment recovered by him is satisfied, unless such
property is delivered or transferred, or such other
debts are paid, to the clerk, sheriff, or other proper
court officer of the court issuing the attachment.
(S8 R57).

Q.

A writ of preliminary attachment was issued by
the trial court and, on the basis thereof,
defendant's credit balance with a stockholder
was garnished. Can the court order the
stockbroker to surrender that credit balance to
plaintiff or to the sheriff? (80 Bar Q7ed).

A.

The court may order the stockbroker to surrender
the credit balance to the sheriff. This is sanctioned
by the last part of S8 R57 which provides that the
garnished debt may be paid to the clerk, sheriff, or
other proper court officer of the court issuing the
821

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

attachment. The evident purpose is to secure the
garnished credit.
The court however may not order the
stockbroker to surrender the credit balance to
the plaintiff. Preliminary attachment is merely
provisional and problems could arise if the plaintiff
were to lose in the main action. Compare this with
garnishment on execution under S9(c) R39 wherein
the garnishee must deliver directly to the judgment
obligee the garnished amount.
Q.

Does the attachment of an interest in property
belonging to the estate of a decedent impair the
powers of the executor, administrator, or other
personal representative over the property
belonging to the estate?

A.

The attachment of the interest of an heir, legatee,
or devisee in the property belonging to the estate of
a decedent shall not impair the powers of
the executor, administrator, or other personal
representative of the decedent over such property
for the purpose of administration. (S9 R57).

Q.

May the executor, administrator, or other
personal representative of the decedent distribute
the property attached?

A.

Yes. Distribution may be awarded to the heir,
legatee, or devisee, but the property attached shall
be ordered delivered to the sheriff making the levy,
subject to the claim of the heir, legatee, or devisee.
(S9 R57).

Q.

What remedies are available to a party when
a writ of attachment is issued or enforced
against him?

822
J9JC9B0M

Rule 57
Preliminary Attachment

A.
1)

He may prevent the enforcement of the writ of
attachment or move for its lifting if he makes a
cash deposit or gives a counterbond in an
amount equal to that fixed in the order of
attachment, which may be the amount sufficient
to satisfy the applicant's demand or the value of
the property to be attached. (S2 & 5 R57). No
notice and hearing is required.

2)

He may move to discharge the attachment
which has been enforced if he makes a cash
deposit or files a counterbond executed to the
attaching party with the clerk of court where the
application is made, in an amount equal to that
fixed by the court in the order of attachment,
exclusive of costs. (S12 R57).

3)

He may move to discharge the attachment on
the ground that the same was improperly or
irregularly issued or enforced, or that the bond is
insufficient, or that the attachment is excessive.
(S13 R57). In 2 & 3, the court may discharge
the attachment only after notice and hearing.

Q.

May the adverse party against whom a writ of
attachment has been issued move for its lifting
by depositing real property instead of depositing
cash or filing a counter-bond?

A.

No. The word "deposit" in S2 & 5 R57 can only be
construed to refer to cash. A broader interpretation
thereof is not justified in the present case for the
reason that a party seeking a stay of the
attachment under S5 is required to make a deposit
in an amount equal to the bond fixed by the court in
the order of attachment or to the value of the

823
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

property to be attached. The proximate relation of
the word "deposit" and "amount" is unmistakable in
S5 R57. Plainly, in construing said words, it can be
safely concluded that S5 requires the deposit of
money as the word "amount" commonly refers to or
is regularly associated with a sum of money. (Luzon
Dev't Bank v. Krishnan, 13 April 2015, Peralta, J.).

Q.

D sold an Amorsolo painting to P for P10
million. P later filed an action for annulment of
the contract on the ground that D had defrauded
him by selling a fake Amorsolo painting. P was
able to obtain the issuance of a writ of
attachment against D on the ground of fraud. D
moved to discharge the attachment on the ground
that there was no fraud since the painting was a
genuine Amorsolo. May the court entertain the
motion?

A.

No. The Supreme Court has held that an
attachment may not be dissolved by a showing of
its irregular or improper issuance if it is upon a
ground which is at the same time the applicant's
cause of action in the main case since an
anomalous situation would result if the issues of the
main case would be ventilated and resolved in a
mere hearing of a motion. Here the issue of fraud is
determinative of whether P is entitled to the
annulment of the contract of sale. Hence the
resolution of the motion to discharge would in effect
pre-empt the trial on the merits of the case. (See
Davao Light & Power Co. v. Court of Appeals, 204
SCRA 343). D's remedy is to file a counterbond.

Q.

Petitioner filed a complaint before the RTC
against the private respondents for sum of
money plus damages with a prayer for the
824

J9JC9B0M

Rule 57
Preliminary Attachment

issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment.
The application for preliminary attachment alleged
that the private respondents induced petitioner
to grant the loan by issuing postdated checks
to cover the installment and interest payments.
The RTC issued an order granting the issuance
of the writ of preliminary attachment and the
same was enforced against the property of the
private respondents. The private respondents
filed a motion to discharge the attachment on
the ground that the same was improperly or
irregularly issued. They contended that there
was no fraud since the Petitioner was aware
that the postdated checks were unfunded at the
time of issuance and were merely issued for the
purpose of creating an evidence of a preexisting obligation. May the RTC entertain the
motion to discharge the attachment?
A.

No. An attachment may not be dissolved by a
showing of its irregular or improper issuance if it is
upon a ground which is at the same time the
applicant's cause of action in the main case since
an anomalous situation would result if the issues of
the main case would be ventilated and resolved in
a mere hearing of a motion. Here the issue of fraud
is clearly within the competence of the trial court in
the main case. (Cuartero v. Court of Appeals, G.R.
No. 102448, 5 August 1992).

Q.

Wolfe was an employee of Watercraft Venture
Corporation who was subsequently dismissed
from work. During his employment, Wolfe stored
the sailboat, Knotty Gull, within Watercraft's
boat storage facilities, but never paid for the
storage fees. Sometime in June 2002, Wolfe
pulled out his sailboat from Watercraft's storage
825

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

facilities after signing a Boat Pull-Out Clearance
where he allegedly acknowledged the outstanding
obligation of US$16,324.82 representing unpaid
boat storage fees for the period of June 1997 to
June 2002. Despite repeated demands, he failed
to pay the said amount. Thus, Watercraft filed
against Wolfe a Complaint for Collection of Sum
of Money with Damages with an Application for
the Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Attachment.
Wolfe filed a Motion to Discharge the Writ of
Attachment, arguing that Watercraft failed to
show the existence of fraud and that the mere
failure to pay or perform an obligation does not
amount to fraud. The motion was opposed by
Watercraft on the ground that when the
preliminary attachment is issued upon a ground
which is at the same time the applicant's cause of
action; e.g., fraud, the defendant is not allowed to
file a motion to dissolve the attachment under
S13 R57 by offering to show the falsity of the
factual averments in the plaintiffs application and
affidavits on which the writ was based - and
consequently that the writ based thereon hag _____
..
been improperly or irregularly issued .:.. the
reason being that the hearing on such a motion
for dissolution of the writ would be tantamount to
a trial of the merits of the action. May the trial
court dissolve the attachment?
A.

Yes. The rule cited by Watercraft is not applicable
in this case because when Wolfe filed a motion to
dissolve the writ of preliminary attachment, he did
not offer to show the falsity of the factual averments
in Watercraft's application and affidavit on which
the writ was based. Instead, he sought the
discharge of the writ on the ground that Watercraft

826

Rule 57
Preliminary Attachment

failed to particularly
amounting to fraud.

allege

any

circumstance

No trial on the merits of the action at a mere
hearing of such motion will be had since only the
sufficiency of the factual averments in the
application and affidavit of merit will be examined in
order to find out whether or not Wolfe was guilty of
fraud in contracting the debt or incurring the
obligation upon which the action is brought, or in
the performance thereof. Here the allegation in the
application for preliminary attachment that Wolfe
pulled out his sailboat from Watercraft's storage
facilities after signing a Boat Pull-Out Clearance
where he allegedly acknowledged the outstanding
obligation but did not pay it despite demands did
not particularly allege any circumstance amounting
to fraud but was simply an averment of a nonpayment of an obligation. The applicant for a writ
of preliminary attachment must sufficiently show the
factual circumstances of the alleged fraud because
fraudulent intent cannot be inferred from the
debtor's mere non-payment of the debt or failure to
comply with his obligation. (Watercraft Venture
Corp. v. Wolfe, 9 September 2015, Peralta, J.).
Q.

Upon failure of X to pay the promissory note for
PS00,000 which he executed in favor of Y, the
latter filed a complaint for sum of money with
application for the issuance of a writ of

about to dispose of his properties in fraud
of his creditors.

May the court issue the writ immediately
upon the filing of the complaint and before
service of summons?

827
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

b)

Is hearing on the application necessary?

c)

If the writ was issued and X filed a motion to
quash the attachment, may the motion be
granted ex parte? (91 Bar Q6ed).

a)

Yes, because S1 R57 provides that attachment
may issue at the commencement of the action.

b)

No, because S2 R57 provides that the order of
attachment may be issued ex parte. The ex
parte issuance of the writ would be justified
since there was an allegation that X is about to
fraudulently dispose of his property.

c)

No, because under S12 and S13 R57, notice
and hearing is required before an attachment is
quashed or discharged upon motion.

A.

Q.

Petitioner filed an action for collection of
P2,160,000 against the Respondents arising
from the issuance by the latter of checks which
were later dishonored. The complaint was
accompanied by an application for preliminary
attachment which was granted by the RTC.
Subsequently in 2006 the Petitioner and the
Respondents entered into a compromise
agreement wherein the Respondents agreed to
pay their obligation by way of installments from
2006 to 2013. The compromise agreement was
approved by the RTC which thus rendered a
compromisejudgment. The Respondentsforthwith
moved for the discharge of the preliminary
attachment. The RTC granted the motion
holding that since the main case had already
been closed and terminated by the compromise

828

Rule 57
Preliminary Attachment

judgment, the preliminary attachment, which is
merely ancillary, should be lifted or discharge.
Was the lifting or discharge of the preliminary
attachment proper?
A.

No. While the provisions of R57 are silent on the
length of time within which an attachment lien shall
continue to subsist after the rendition of a final
judgment, jurisprudence dictates that the said lien
continues until the debt is paid, or the sale is
had under execution issued on the judgment or
until the judgment is satisfied, or the
attachment discharged or vacated in the same
manner provided by law. Here, while the parties
have entered into a compromise agreement which
had already been approved by the RTC in its
compromise judgment, the obligations thereunder
have yet to be fully complied with. Hence, given
that the foregoing debt remains unpaid, the
attachment of Respondents' properties should have
continued to subsist. (Um v. Lazaro, 3 July 2013,
Perlas-Bernabe, J.).

Q.

What is a third-party claim?

A.

A remedy afforded to a third-party with a claim to
property levied, attached, or seized by virtue of
court order, wherein the third-party makes an
affidavit of his title or right of possession to the
property and serves the affidavit upon the court
officer and a copy upon the party procuring the
levy, attachment, or seizure. It is available to a
third-party in cases of levy on execution (S16 R39),
attachment (S14 R57), and replevin (S7 R60). It is
also referred to as terceria.

829
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

Discuss briefly the procedure for making a
third-party claim under S14 R57.

A.
1) The third-party shall make an affidavit showing
his title to or right of possession over the property.
2)

He shall serve the affidavit upon the court
officer and a copy upon the attaching party.

3)

Thereafter the officer is not bound to keep the
property, unless the attaching party, on
demand of the officer, files a bond approved by
the court to indemnify the third-party claimant in
a sum not less than the value of the property
levied. The officer shall not be liable for
damages for the taking or keeping of the
property to any third-party claimant if the
indemnity bond is filed.

4)

A claim for damages for the taking or keeping of
the property may be enforced by the third-party
against the bond provided he files an action
within 120 days from the filing of the bond.

Q.

What are the remedies available to a third-party
with a claim to title or possession of property
which is attached?

A.

The remedies of the third-party are:
1) Third-party claim or terceria under S14 R57.
2)

Motion to intervene. This is because the third
party "is so situated as to be adversely affected
by a distribution or other disposition of property
in the custody of the court, or of an officer
thereof." (S1 R19). Also under S14 R57 on third830

Rule 57
Preliminary Attachment

party claim, it is provided that "nothing herein
contained shall prevent such claimant or any
third person from vindicating his claim to the
property... in the same or a separate action."
3) An action to claim damages on the indemnity
bond if one is filed.
4)

A separate action to recover possession of the
property from the officer or the purchaser at the
execution sale.

Q.

If a third-party claimant has availed of a thirdparty claim but is unable to recover the
property, may he still file a separate action to
recover possession?

A.

Yes. Nothing contained in S14 R57 shall prevent
the third-party claimant from vindicating his claim
to the property in the same or a separate action.
(S16 R39).

Q.

What is the remedy of the judgment . obligee
against a third-party claimant who filed a
frivolous or plainly spurious claim?

A.

He may claim damages against the third-party
claimant in the same case or he can file a separate
action for damages. (S14 R57).

Q.

What are the instances when a party whose
property was attached may obtain damages
against the attaching party on account of
the attachment?

A.

When the attachment is improper, irregular, or
excessive. Improper means that there was no valid
ground for attachment. Irregular means that
although there was a valid ground for attachment,
831

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

the proper procedure was not followed as when the
attachment was effected even prior to service of
summons. Excessive means that more property
than is necessary to secure a favorable judgment
was attached.
Q.

May the defendant recover damages on account
of the attachment even if the judgment was in
favor of the plaintiff?

A.

Yes, if the attachment was improper, irregular, or
excessive. Thus in a sum of money case, even if
the plaintiff wins, defendant can seek damages if
the attachment enforced against him was not
supported by any of the grounds upon which
attachment may issue as set forth in S1 R57.
(Baron v. David, 5"1Phil. 1).

Q.

From whom may the party recover damages in
case of improper, irregular, or excessive
attachment?

A.

From the attaching party or from the surety which
issued the applicant's bond. The party seeking
damages must file an application for damages. The
application may be in the form of a counterclaim in
the answer or by way of motion.

Q.

When and where should the application for
damages on account of attachment be filed?

A.

An application for damages on account of improper,
irregular, or excessive attachment must be filed
before the trial or before appeal is perfected or
before the judgment becomes executory, with due
notice to the attaching party and his surety or
sureties, setting forth the facts showing his right to
damages and the amount thereof. Such damages
832

J9JC9B0M

Rule 57
Preliminary Attachment

shall be awarded only after proper hearing and
shall be included in the judgment on the main case.
(S20 R57).
If the judgment of the appellate court be
favorable to the party against whom the attachment
was issued, he must claim damages sustained
during the pendency of the appeal by filing an
application in the appellate court, with notice to the
party in whose favor the attachment was issued or

appellate court becomes executory. The appellate
court may allow the application to be heard and
decided by the trial court. (S20 R57). Take note that
nd
the procedure in the 2 paragraph of S20 R57
applies only to damages sustained during the
pendency of the appeal. If the aggrieved party did
not file an application with the trial court, he cannot
seek damages sustained during the pendency of the
trial by filing an application with the appellate court.
Q.

Is the liability of the attaching party on account
of improper, irregular, or excessive attachment
limited to the amount of the bond?

A.

No. S20 R57 states that nothing contained therein
by prevent the party against whom attachment was
issued from recovering in the same action the
damages awarded to him from any property of the
attaching party not exempt from execution should.Jt
the bond or deposit given by the attaching party be
insufficient or fail to fully satisfy the award.
Note that the surety's liability however is
limited to the amount of the bond. Under Article
2055 of the Civil Code a guaranty cannot extend to
more than what is stipulated therein.

Q.

Distinguish between the applicant's bond and
the counterbond.

A.

AS TO WHO POSTS. The applicant's bond is posted
by the applicant while the counterbond is posted by
the party against whom attachment is issued.
AS TO PURPOSE. The purpose of the
applicant's bond is to obtain a writ of preliminary
attachment while the counterbond aims to prevent
or discharge a preliminary attachment.
AS TO LIABILITY OF BOND. The applicant's
bond shall answer for all the costs which may be
adjudged to the adverse party and all damages
which he may sustain by reason of the attachment,
if the court shall finally adjudge that the applicant
was not entitled thereto, while the counterbond
secures the payment of the judgment which the
applicant may be entitled to.
AS TO REQUIREMENT OF NOTICE AND
HEARING TO SURETY. The liability of the sureties
under the applicant's bond must be enforced by an
application after motion with due notice has been
given to the applicant and the sureties and after
proper hearing, while in a counterbond, the sureties
thereon are forthwith charged under the judgment
and their liability may be recovered after notice and
summary hearing in the same action.

Q.

520 R57, which governs the procedure for
recovering on the attachment bond, requires
notice and hearing before the finality of
judgment in an application for damages, while
517 R57, which governs the procedure for

834

Rule 57
Preliminary Attachment

recovering on the counterbond, allows the
notice and hearing to the surety after the
judgment has become executory. What is the
reason for the difference?
A.

The answer lies in the kind of damages sought to
be enforced against the bond. Under S20 R57, in
relation to S4 R57, the surety bond shall answer for
all the costs which may be adjudged to the adverse
party and all damages which he may sustain by
reason of the attachment. In other words, the
damages sought to be enforced against the surety
bond are unliquidated. Necessarily, a notice and
hearing before the finality of judgment must be
undertaken to properly determine the amount of
damages that was suffered by the defendant due to
the improper attachment. These damages to be
imposed against the attaching party and his
sureties are different from the principal case, and
must be included in the judgment.
On the other hand, under S17 R57, in relation
to S 12 R57, the cash deposit or the counter-bond
shall secure the payment of any judgment that the
attaching party may recover in the action. Stated
differently, the damages sought to be charged
against the surety bond are liquidated. The final
judgment had already determined the amount to be
awarded to the winning litigant on the main action.
Thus, there is nothing left to do but to execute the
judgment against the losing party, or in case of
insufficiency, against its sureties. (Excellent Quality
Apparel, Inc. v. Visayan Surety & Insurance Corp.,
1 July 2015, Mendoza, J.).

Q.

Is there a need for execution to be returned
unsatisfied so that the surety on the
counterbond shall become charged thereon?

A.

No. Unlike the 1964 Rules, there is no more need
for execution to be returned unsatisfied in order that
the surety on the counterbond shall become
charged thereon, It is enough that the judgment
against the party on whom attachment was issued
has become executory and that there is notice to
the sureties and a summary hearing. (S17 R57).
This amendment brings R57 in line with Article
2059(2) of the Civil Code which provides that the
benefit of excussion is not available to a surety.

836

RULE 58. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION
Q.

Define a preliminary injunction.

A.

A preliminary injunction is an order granted at any
stage of an action or proceeding prior to the
judgment or final order, requiring a party or a court,
agency, or a person to refrain from a particular act
or acts. (S1 R58)

Q.

Define a preliminary mandatory injunction.

A.

A preliminary mandatory injunction is an order
granted at any stage of an action or proceeding
prior to the judgment or final order, requiring a party
or a court, agency, or a person to perform a
particular act or acts. (S1 R58)

Q.

Can injunction be a main action?

A.

Yes injunction, aside from being a provisional
remedy, may also be an action by itself. Jurisdiction
over an action for injunction is vested exclusively in
the Regional Trial Court as the subject of the
litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation. (See
also Sec. 21[1], B.P. Big. 129). In the main action for
injunction, the petitioner may apply for the issuance
of a writ of preliminary injunction.

Q.

Distinguish
injunction.

A.

Preliminary injunction is one issued prior to
judgment or final order, while a final injunction is
issued if after the trial of the action it appears that
the applicant is entitled to have the act or acts
complained of permanently enjoined, in which case
the court shall grant a final injunction perpetually

commission or continuance of the act or acts or
confirming the preliminary mandatory injunction.
(S9 R58). Preliminary injunction is thus provisional
while final injunction is permanent.
Q.

Distinguish

injunction from prohibition.

A

Injunction is generally directed against a person
not exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial
functions, while prohibition is directed against
a tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person
exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial
functions.
Injunction may be the main action itself, or just
a provisional remedy in the main action, whereas
prohibition is always a main action.
Where an action for prohibition is filed, the
petitioner may seek the provisional remedy of
preliminary injunction against the respondent.

Q.

Distinguish mandatory injunction from mandamus.

A

The purpose of mandatory injunction is to compel a
party to do a particular act in order to restore the last
actual peaceable uncontested status which preceded
the pending controversy, while mandamus seeks the
to compel the performance of a ministerial duty.
Mandamus is always a main action while
mandatory injunction may be a main action or a
provisional remedy. Thus in an action for mandamus
the petitioner may pray for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction.

Q.

What is a status quo ante order? How is it
distinguishedfrom a temporary restrainingorder?

A.

A status quo ante order is an equitable remedy
intended to maintain the status quo ante, i.e. the
last actual, peaceable, uncontested state of things
which preceded the controversy. It is distinguished
from a TRO in that it is issued by the court motu
proprio, that is, there is no application therefor or
the allegations of the pleadings do not make out a
case for the issuance of a TRO. Also unlike a TRO,
no bond is required for the issuance of a status quo
ante order. (Mega-World Properties & Holdings Inc.
v. Majestic Finance & Investment Co., 9 December
2015, Bersamin, J.).

Q.

In a dispute between a developer and the
landowner, the trial court issued a status quo
ante order directing the developer to post
security guards on the property subject of the
joint-venture agreement. Was the issuance of
the status quo ante order proper?

A.

No. The purpose of a status quo ante order is to
maintain the status quo ante, that is, the last actual,
peaceable, uncontested state of things prior to the
controversy. Here the last actual, peaceable,
uncontested status prior to the controversy was that
there were no security guards in the premises.
Furthermore a status quo ante order by its nature
cannot require the doing (or undoing) of acts.

7)

CONSERVATORSHIP, RECEIVERSHIP, AND
LIQUIDATION PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE
NEW CENTRAL BANK ACT. The actions of the
Monetary Board in respect of conservatorship,
receivership, and liquidation proceedings shall
not be restrained except on petition for
certiorari on the ground that the action taken
was in excess of jurisdiction or with such grave
abuse of discretion as to amount to lack of or
excess of jurisdiction. The petition for certiorari
may only be filed by the stockholders of record

of the SEC that falls exclusively within its
jurisdiction. (Sec. 179, Revised Corporation Code).
Q.

A complaint ..affidavit was filed with the Office of
the Ombudsman against Mayor Jejomar Binay
Jr. charging him with plunder and violation of
the Anti-Graft Law in connection with the
construction of the Makati City Hall Parking
Building. The 0MB issued an order placing
Binay under preventive suspension without pay
for not more than 6 months during the
pendency of the investigation. Binay filed a
petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals
seeking the nullification of the preventive
suspension order and praying for the issuance
of a TRO and/or writ of preliminary injunction to
enjoin its implementation. The CA issued a TRO
enjoining the implementation of the preventive
suspension order. The Ombudsman argued that
the CA cannot issue the TRO, invoking the first
paragraph of Section 14 of R.A. No. 6770 or the
Ombudsman Act which reads as follows:
- No writ of
Section 14, Restrictions.
injunction shall be issued by any court to delay an
investigation being conducted by the Ombudsman
under this Act, unless there is a prima facie
evidence that the subject matter of the
investigation is outside the jurisdiction of the
Office of the Ombudsman.

Was the Ombudsman correct?
A.

No. When Congress passed the first paragraph of
Section 14, RA 6770 and, in so doing, took away
from the courts their power to issue a TRO and/or
writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin an investigation
conducted by the Ombudsman, it encroached upon
842

Rule 58
Preliminary Injunction

this Court's constitutional rule-making authority
under Section 5(5), Article VIII. Clearly, these
issuances, which are, by nature, provisional reliefs
and auxiliary writs created under the provisions of
the Rules of Court, are matters of procedure which
belong exclusively within the province of this Court.
R58 did not create, define, and regulate a right but
merely prescribed the means of implementing an
existing right since it only provided for temporary
reliefs to preserve the applicant's right in esse which
is threatened to be violated during the course of a
pending litigation. Hence the first paragraph of
Section 14 of RA 6770 is unconstitutional and void.
(Carpio Morales v. Court of Appeals, 10 November
2015, e.b., Perlas-Bernabe, J.).
The policy against the issuance of provisional
injunctive writs by courts other than the Supreme
Court to enjoin an investigation conducted by the
Office of the Ombudsman under the first paragraph
of RA 6770 is declared INEFFECTIVE until the
Court adopts the same as part of the rules of
procedure through an administrative circular duly
issued therefor. (ld.). 134
Q.

Can a Regional Trial Court issue a TRO or writ of
preliminary injunction against decisions of the
Ombudsman in administrative disciplinary cases?

A.

No, the RTC has no power to issue a TRO or writ of
preliminary injunction to interfere with or restrain the
decisions of the Ombudsman in disciplinary cases.

13
4The Carpio Morales ruling by its express terms covers the ban on TROs
and writs of injunction issued against investigations by the 0MB under Section
14 of R.A. No. 6770. The applicability of the ratio decidendi to other laws barring
the issuance of TROs and writs of preliminary injunction, i.e., the ban on the
issuance of court injunctions against the collection of taxes imposed under the
National Internal Revenue Code, needs further examination.

Q.

The residents of Dasmariiias Village, Makati
City, filed against the NAPOCOR a complaint for
damages with a prayer for the issuance of a writ
of preliminary injunction and/or temporary
restraining order. The Plaintiffs sought to enjoin
NAPOCOR from energizing and transmitting
high voltage electric current through its cables
erected from Sucat, Paranaque to Araneta
Avenue, Quezon City. The Plaintiffs allege that
NAPOCOR failed to comply with Section 27 of
the Local Government Code requiring prior
consultation prior to the implementation of a
government project and that the electromagnetic
fields are harmful to their health. They allege
that unless the restraining order is issued,
grave and irreparable injury to their health
would ensue. NAPOCOR argues that the court
is prohibited from issuing a temporary restraining
order and preliminary injunction against an
infrastructure project by virtue of PD 1818.
May the trial court issue a restraining order
against NAPOCOR?

A.

Yes. While PD 1818 prohibits any court from
issuing injunctions or restraining orders in cases
involving infrastructure projects, the prohibition
extends only to the issuance of injunctions in
administrative acts in controversies involving facts
or the exercise of discretion in technical cases. The
844

Rule 58
Preliminary Injunction

issues of whether there is a violation of the plaintiffs'
constitutionally protected right to health under Section
15, Article II and whether NAPOCOR had violated
Section 27 of the Local Government Code are
questions of law which divest the case from the
protective mantle of PD 1818.
(Hernandez v.
National Power Corp., G.R. 145328, 23 March 2006).
Q.

In a decision in Civil Case No. 93-1000 which
became final and executory, the RTC of Manila
(Branch 21) issued a writ of execution for its
enforcement. The sheriff levied upon certain
chattels and scheduled the auction sale thereof.

However, Santamaria filed a third-party claim
with the sheriff asserting that the chattels levied upon
by the latter belong to him and not to the judgment
debtor. Because the judgment obligee posted an
indemnity bond in favor of the third-party claimant, the
sheriff refused to release the chattels and stated that
he would proceed with the auction sale.
Hence Santamaria filed with the RTC of
Bulacan (Branch 8) an action against the judgment
obligee and the sheriff for the recovery of the
chattels and seeking to enjoin the auction sale.
The RTC of Bulacan in due course issued a writ of
preliminary injunction enjoining the sheriff from
proceeding with the auction sale. The judgment
creditor and the sheriff filed a motion to dismiss
stating that Santamaria can no longer file a
separate action since he had already filed a thirdparty claim and that the auction sale cannot be
enjoined since a court cannot interfere with the
judgment of a coordinate court. How should the
motion to dismiss be resolved? (93 Bar Q8 ed).
845
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

The motion to dismiss should be denied. Nothing
contained in S16 R39 shall prevent the third-party
claimant from vindicating his claim to the property in
a separate action. (S16 R39). There is no
interference with the processes of a coordinate and
co-equal court, since the sheriff was improperly
implementing the writ of execution. (Abiera v. Court
of Appeals, 45 SCRA 314).

Q.

Who may grant preliminary injunction?

A.

A preliminary injunction may be granted by the
court where the action or proceeding is pending. If
the action or proceeding is pending in the Court of
Appeals or in the Supreme Court, it may be issued
by said court or any member thereof. (S2 R58).

Q.

P, a Makati resident, filed a petition for
prohibition with the RTC of Makati seeking to
enjoin the Department of Justice from proceeding
with the preliminary investigation of a syndicated
estafa case against him. P applied for a writ of
preliminary injunction to restrain the DOJ from
continuing with the preliminary investigation.
Upon the DOJ's motion, the RTC dismissed the
petition on the ground of improper venue
saying that the case should have been filed in
Manila which has territorial jurisdiction over the
Department of Justice at Padre Faura, Manila.
a)

Was the dismissal proper?

b) What if P were a Pasig City resident. Would
your answer be the same.
A.

J9JC9B0M

Rule 58

may be enforced within the judicial region to which
the RTC belongs.
Here Manila is within the National Capital
Judicial Region to which the Makati RTC belongs.
Hence the Makati RTC could issue a writ of
injunction and the same could be enforced in Manila.
b)

If P were a Pasig City resident, my answer
would not be the same. The dismissal would
then be proper.

An action for prohibition is a personal action.
Hence the action should have been filed either in
Pasig City, where P resides, or in Manila, where the
DOJ holds office, pursuant to R4.
Q.

What is the territory in which a writ of injunction
may be enforced?

A.

A writ of injunction issued by the Supreme Court or the
Court of Appeals may be served and enforced
anywhere in the Philippines. A writ of injunction issued
by the Regional Trial Court may be enforced only
within the judicial region to which the RTC belongs.
(Sec. 3[b] Interim Rules on B.P. Big. 129). A writ of
preliminary injunction issued by the Municipal Trial-"
Court may be enforced outside of its territorial
jurisdiction but within the judicial region to which it
belongs. There is no need of a certification by a RTC
judge for the enforcement of a writ of preliminary
injunction outside of the MTC's territorial jurisdiction.

A.

A preliminary injunction may be granted when it is
established that: (WER)
a)

The applicant is entitled to the relief demanded,
and the whole or part of such relief consists in
restraining the commission or continuance of
the act or acts complained of, or in requiring the
performance of an act or acts, either for a
limited period or perpetually;

b)

The comm1ss1on, continuance or nonperformance of the act or acts complained of

Q.

Private Respondent obtained a P3 million loan
from Petitioner Union Bank secured by a real

non-payment of the loan, Petitioner extrajudicially
foreclosed the mortgage. A week before the
expiration of the redemption period, Private
Respondent filed an action for annulment of
the mortgage and foreclosure sale and for
reconveyance with prayer for temporary
restraining order and preliminary injunction
seeking to enjoin the consolidation of title by
Petitioner. The Private Respondent forthwith
registered a notice of lis pendens on the

848

Rule 58
Preliminary Injunction

property. Should the preliminary injunction
be granted?
A.

No. The consolidation of title by Petition and the
issuance of a new title in its name will not cause
irreparable injury to the Private Respondent. This is
because the purchaser at the auction sale merely
steps into the shoes of the judgment debtor or
mortgagor. Hence the consolidation and issuance
of new title to Petitioner will not render ineffectual
the judgment in the main case for reconveyance.
More importantly, the notice of lis pendens
which despite consolidation will remain annotated
on the property sufficiently protects the rights of the
Private Respondent. Any transferee pendente lite
steps into the shoes of the transferor and is bound
by the judgment in the pending case. (See Union
Bank v. Court of Appeals, 311 SCRA 795 [1999]).

injunction to restrain P Corporation

from

A.

Yes. There is no question that when P corporation
purchased the property, W and X were in actual
possession of the property and their adverse
claims and notice of lis pendens were annotated
in the titles of the property. Hence a writ of
preliminary injunction was proper since W and X
have clearly shown that they are entitled to the right
of possession. (See Lukang v. Pagbilao Oev't

Q.

ABC Cattle Corporation is the holder of a
pasture lease agreement since 1990 covering
1,000 hectares of pasture land surrounded with
fences. In 1992, D was issued a pasture lease
agreement covering 930 hectares of land
adjacent to ABC's. A relocation survey showed
that the boundaries of D's land extended 580
hectares into ABC's pasture land. Thereupon, D
removed ABC's fence and started to set up his
own boundary fence 580 hectares into ABC's
pasture area. As ABC persistently blocked O's
advances into its property, D filed a complaint
with preliminary injunction to enjoin ABC from
restricting him in the exercise of his lease rights.
If you were the judge, would you issue a
preliminary injunction? Explain. (96 Bar Q9[3]).

A.

If I were the judge I would not issue a writ of
preliminary injunction.
The Supreme Court has held that the purpose
of preliminary injunction, whether prohibitory or
mandatory, is to maintain or restore the status quo
or the last actual peaceable uncontested status.

Q.

What are the requirements for the grant of a
preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining
order? (VeBoNS)

A.
a)

VERIFIED APPLICATION. The application
in the action or proceeding is verified,
and shows facts entitling the applicant to the
relief demanded.

b)

BOND. Unless exempted by the court, the
applicant files with the court where the action or
proceeding is pending, a bond executed to the
party or person enjoined, in an amount to be
fixed by the court, to the effect that the
applicant will pay to such party or person all
damages which he may sustain by reason of
the injunction or temporary restraining order if
the court should finally decide that the applicant
was not entitled thereto. Upon approval of the
requisite bond, a writ of preliminary injunction
shall be issued.

c)

NOTICE OF RAFFLE. When an application for
a writ of preliminary injunction or a temporary
restraining order is included in a complaint or
any initiatory pleading, the case, if filed in a
multiple-sala court, shall be raffled only after
851

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

notice to and in the presence of the adverse
party or the person to be enjoined. In any
event, such notice shall be preceded, or
contemporaneously accompanied, by service of
summons, together with a copy of the complaint
or initiatory pleading and the applicant's
affidavit135 and bond, upon the adverse party in
the Philippines. (Summons + CAB).
However, where the summons could not be
served personally or by substituted service despite
diligent efforts, or the adverse party is a resident of
the Philippines temporarily absent therefrom or is a
non-resident thereof (TSN), the requirement of
prior or contemporaneous service of summons
shall not apply. 136
d)

SUMMARY HEARING. The application for a
TRO shall thereafter be acted upon only after
all the parties are heard in a summary hearing
which shall be conducted within 24 hours
after the sheriff's return of service and/or the
records are received by the branch selected by
raffle and to which the records shall be
transmitted immediately.

The period within which to conduct a summary
hearing is not 24 hours after the case has been
raffled but 24 hours after the records are
transmitted to the branch to which it is raffled.
13
5The term "applicant's affidavit" appears to be a drafting oversight since
preliminary injunction is sought by a verified application. The term should be
changed to "verified application."
136
1t is opined that what the rule intends is that the requirement of notice of
raffle to the adverse party or person to be enjoined is dispensed with, not just the
prior or contemporaneous service of summons. If a person cannot be served
with summons, chances are that he could not also be served with the notice of
raffle. The purpose of the notice of raffle is to ensure that the adverse party or
person to be enjoined will have an opportunity to attend the raffle.

A.

Never. No preliminary injunction shall be granted

Q.

May a temporary restraining order issue ex parte?

A.

As a rule no. There must be a summary hearing.

Q.

What are the instances when a TRO may be
issued ex parte or without hearing?

A.

GREAT/IRREPARABLE INJURY. If it shall appear
from facts shown by affidavits or by the verified
application that great or irreparable injury would
result to the applicant before the matter can be
heard on notice, the court to which the application
for preliminary injunction was made, may issue ex
parte a TRO to be effective only for 20 days from
service on the party or person sought to be enjoined.
Within the 20-day period, the court must order said
party or person to show cause why the injunction
should not be granted and determine whether or not
the preliminary injunction shall be granted.
EXTREME URGENCY+ GRAVE INJUSTICE
+ IRREPARABLE INJURY. (EGI) If the matter is of
extreme urgency and the applicant will suffer grave
injustice and irreparable injury, the executive judge
of a multiple-sala court or the presiding judge of a
single-sala court may issue .ex parte a TRO
effective for only 72 hours from issuance but he
shall immediately comply with the provisions of S4
R58 as to service of summons and the complaint,
affidavit, and bond. Within the 72 hours, the judge
before whom the case is pending shall conduct a
summary hearing to determine whether or not the
TRO shall be extended until the application for
preliminary injunction can be heard.

Q.

An application for a writ of preliminary injunction
with a prayer for a temporary restraining order
is included in a complaint and filed in a multisala Regional Trial Court consisting of Branches
1, 2, 3, and 4. Being urgent in nature, the
Executive Judge, who was sitting in Branch 1,

854

J9JC9B0M

Rule 58
Preliminary Injunction

upon the filing of the aforesaid application
immediately raffled the case in the presence of
the judges of Branches 2, 3, and 4. The case
was raffled to Branch 4 and the judge thereof
immediately issued a temporary restraining
order. Is the temporary restraining order valid?
Why? (01 Bar Q9)
A.

The temporary restraining order is not valid.
When an application for a writ of preliminary
injunction or a temporary restraining order is included
in a complaint or any initiatory pleading, the case, if
filed in a multiple-sala court, shall be raffled only after
notice to and in the presence of the adverse party or
the person to be enjoined. (S4 R58).
Here the raffle to Branch 4 was made without
notice to and in the presence of the adverse party
or the person to be enjoined. Hence the raffle to
Branch 4 was invalid and the temporary restraining
order issued by its judge was not valid.

Q.

What is the period of effectivity of a temporary
restraining order (TRO)? Is such period of
effectivity inclusive of non-working days?

A.

A TRO issued by executive judge of a multiple-sala
court and the presiding judge of a single-sala court
in cases of extreme urgency shall be effective only
for a period of 72 hours from its issuance.
A TRO issued by a trial court is effective only
for a period of 20 days from service on the party or
person to be enjoined. The 20-day period includes
the 72 hours of the TRO issued by the executive or
presiding judge, if one had been issued.

855

J9JC9B0M

PRiMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A TRO issued by the Court of Appeals or a
member thereof is effective for a period of 60 days
only, counted from service on the party or person to
be enjoined.
A TRO issued by the Supreme Court or
a member thereof shall be effective "until
further orders."
The effectivity period is inclusive of nonworking days. A non-working day is excluded only
when the last day of the TRO falls on a nonworking day, in which case the TRO is still effective
on the next succeeding working day. (BPI v. CA,
G.R. 142731, 8 June 2006, Azcuna, J.)

Q.

Is the effectivity of a TRO extendible?

A.

As a rule no. Even the TRO issued by the Court of
Appeals or a member thereof is non-extendible.
Note however that a TRO issued by the Supreme
Court or a member thereof shall be effective until
further orders.
However a TRO may be renewed or extended
on a ground different from the one on which it was
first issued. This is because what S5 R58 provides
is that "[t]he effectivity of a temporary restraining
order is not extendible without need of any judicial
declaration to that effect and no court shall have
authority to extend or renew the same on the same
ground for which it was issued." (Underscoring
supplied, see 1 REGALADO 654). The renewal or
extension may or may be without hearing
depending upon the exigencies of the situation and
in accordance with S5 R58.

Q.

P filed a complaint against B with the RTC of
Las Pinas City. Alleging extreme urgency, grave
injustice, and irreparable damage, P applied ex
parte with the executive judge for the issuance
of a 72-hour TRO. The executive judge issued
the TRO effective 72 hours from issuance. The
case was forthwith raffled to Branch 256 of the
RTC. On the 72nd hour and at the conclusion of
the summary hearing in which the parties were
present, the RTC judge issued a TRO effective
20 days from issuance. Was there any defect in
the TRO issued?

A.

Yes. A TRO's validity should be for 20 days only,
inclusive of the original 72 hours. Since the original
72 hours had lapsed, the TRO issued herein can be
valid for only 17 days. (S5 R58).

Q.

What are the grounds for preventing
dissolving a preliminary injunction?

A.

INSUFFICIENCY. The application for injunction or
restraining order may be denied, upon a showing of
its insufficiency.

Q.

Respondent filed with the RTC a complaint
against Petitioners for the establishment of a
permanent right of way, with application for
preliminary injunction to prevent the Petitioners
from closing off a private road within their
property which Respondent has been using in
order to go to and from the public highway in
order to access his poultry farm. The writ of
preliminary injunction was issued. Subsequently
the RTC dismissed Respondent's complaint
holding that the Respondent was unable to
establish the requirements for a right of way
under Article 649 of the Civil Code. Respondent
appealed to the CA. Pending the appeal, the
Petitioners closed the private road. The RTC
noting that the decision had not yet become
final and executory cited the Petitioners in
contempt. Are the Petitioners liable for contempt?

A.

No. A writ of preliminary injunction is deemed
dissolved or lifted upon the dismissal of the main
case, even if such dismissal is appealed. Hence
858

Rule 58
Preliminary Injunction

the defendants cannot be cited for contempt if they
close the right of way. (Buyco v. Baraquia, 21
December 2009).
Q.

Petitions for certiorari with application for
preliminary injunction were filed with the
Supreme Court challenging the planned burial
of former President Marcos in the Libingan ng
mga Bayani. The SC issued a SQAO enjoining
the burial. In due course, the SC rendered a
decision dismissing the petitions. Nothing was
said in the decision regarding the SQAO. The
remains of Marcos were buried in the LNMB
right after the promulgation of the decision and
before the filing of motions for reconsideration
by the petitioners. The petitioners moved to cite
the respondents in contempt for burying
Marcos in the LNMB. Will the motion prosper?

A.

No. The SC cited Buyco v. Baraquia (21 December
2009), which ruled that the lifting of a writ of
preliminary injunction due to the dismissal of the
complaint is immediately executory even if the
dismissal of the complaint is pending appeal.
By nature, a SQAO is similar to the provisional
remedies of TRO and writ of preliminary injunction.
Thus, when the Court dismissed the petitions, the
SQAO, in effect, became functus officio; it could not
stand independent of the main proceeding. Such
dismissal necessarily carried with it the lifting of the
SQAO issued during the pendency of the action.
Being interlocutory and ancillary in character, the
order automatically dissolved upon dismissal of the
main case. The lifting of the SQAO is effective
immediately despite the existence of the right to file

and the actual filing of a MR or appeal. (Ocampo v.

Q.

When may a preliminary injunction or restraining
order be modified?

A.

If it appears that the extent of the preliminary
injunction or restraining order is too great, it may be
modified. (Id.).

Q.

What is the procedure for claiming, ascertaining,
and awarding damages upon the bond of the
adverse party?

A.

At the trial, the amount of damages to be awarded
to either party, upon the bond of the adverse party,
shall be claimed, ascertained, and awarded under
the same procedure prescribed for preliminary
attachment under S20 R57. (S8 R58). In fine, there
should be an application for damages filed with
due notice to the adverse party and his surety, and
the damages shall only be awarded after proper
hearing and shall be included in the judgment
on the main case.

Q.

When is a final injunction granted? (06 Bar
Q9.1b ed.)

A.

A final injunction is granted if after the trial of the
action it appears that the applicant is entitled to have
the act or acts complained of permanently enjoined.
The final injunction shall perpetually restrain the
party or person enjoined from the commission or
continuance of the act or acts or confirm the
preliminary mandatory injunction. (S9 R58).

RULE 59. RECEIVERSHIP
Q.

What is a receivership?

A.

It is a provisional or ancillary remedy wherein the
court appoints a receiver to receive and preserve
the property or fund in litigation pendente lite, when
it does not seem reasonable to the court that either
party should hold it.

Q.

Is the receiver an agent of either party?

A.

No he is not an agent or representative of a party
but is regarded as an officer of the court. (Teal
Motor Co. v. CF/ of Manila, 51 Phil. 563).

Q.

May a party to the action be appointed receiver?

A.

No. The receiver should be a neutral or impartial
person and hence a party to the litigation should
not be appointed a receiver unless the other party
consents. (Alcantara v. Abbes, G.R. 14890, 30.18
September 1963).

Q

Who may appoint a receiver?

A.

1) The court where the action is pending.
2)

The Court of Appeals or a member thereof.

3)

The Supreme Court or a member thereof.

Q.

In what cases may a receiver be appointed? (I FPJ)

A.

Upon a verified application, one or more receivers
of the property which is the subject of the action or
proceeding may be appointed by the court where
the action is pending, or by the Court of Appeals or
by the Supreme Court, or a member thereof, in the
following cases:
861

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

1) When it appears from the verified application
and such other proof as the court may require
that the applicant has an interest in the property
or fund which is the subject of the action or
proceeding, and that such property or fund is in
danger of being lost, removed, or materially
injured unless a receiver be appointed to
administer and preserve it. (RIL)
2) When it appears in an action for foreclosure of a
mortgage that the property is in danger of being
wasted or dissipated or materially injured, and
that its value is probably insufficient to discharge
the mortgage debt, or that the parties have so
stipulated in the mortgage contract. (WID + 1/S)
3) After judgment, to preserve the property during
the pendency of an appeal, or to dispose of it
according to the judgment, or to aid execution
when the execution has been returned
unsatisfied or the judgment obligor refuses to
apply his property in satisfaction of the judgment,
or otherwise to carry the judgment into effect.
(PDEC) Under S41 R39, the court may during
the execution stage appoint a receiver of the
judgment obliger's property.137
4)

Whenever in other cases it appears that the
appointment of a receiver is the most
convenient and feasible means of preserving,
administering, or disposing of the property in
litigation. (S1 R59).

just cause abandons the other or fails to comply

against D. During the pendency of the case, P
learns that D is disposing of some of his
property and that the rest of D's property is
deteriorating rapidly.
a)

May P apply for the appointment of a
receiver of D's property?

b) Judgment was rendered in favor of P and
the same becomes final and executory. May
P apply for the appointment of a receiver of
D's property?
A.

a)

No. A receiver may be appointed only over
property which is the subject of the action or
proceeding. (S1 R59). Where the action is
merely to obtain a money judgment on unpaid
credits and not to enforce a lien upon specific
property or funds in the defendant's possession,
the appointment of a receiver is improper.
(Bonaplata v. Ambler, 2 Phil. 392).

b) Yes. Under S41 R39 on execution, the court
may appoint a receiver of the property of the
judgment
obliger, especially where the
defendant has been disposing of or concealing
his property to avoid its application to the
satisfaction of the judgment. (Philippine Trust

Q.

In a suit for the collection of a sum of money,
the plaintiff applied for the appointment of a
receiver of the defendant's property to assure
the payment of the obligation. Should the court
grant the application?

A.

No. Receivership may be applied for only in respect
of the property or fund subject of the action or
proceeding or in respect of the property in litigation.
In a sum of money case, the defendant's property
or fund is not the subject of the action or litigation.

Q.

May an application for the appointment of a
receiver be availed of in extrajudicial foreclosure?

A.

No since S1(b) R59 speaks of an "action by the
mortgagee for the foreclosure of the mortgage."
An extrajudicial foreclosure is not an action. Note
however that a stipulation allowing the mortgagee
to take possession of the property mortgaged
upon foreclosure is valid. (DBP v. Sps. Doyon, 25
March 2009).

Q.

During the pendency of an appeal where should
the application for appointment of a receiver
be filed?

A.

With the appellate court. However the appellate
court may allow the application to be filed in and
decided by the court of origin and the receiver
appointed to be subject to the control of the court
of origin. (Id.).

Q.

If an appeal has been perfected and the trial
court deprived of its jurisdiction, may it still
appoint a receiver?

A.

Yes if the order is necessary for the protection and
preservation of the rights of the parties and

864

Rule 59
Receivership

provided the original record or the record on appeal
has not yet been transmitted to the appellate court.
(S9R41).
Q.

May a receiver be appointed ex parte?

A.

Justice Feria writes that the new rule does not
authorize an ex parte appointment of a receiver and
that a hearing is necessary. (Feria 230). Prof.
Bautista writes that "apparently" a receiver may be
appointed ex parte.
It is believed that the
appointment of a receiver may be applied for ex
parte especially where there is a danger of the
property being lost, wasted, or dissipated.

Q

What are the bonds required under R59?

A.

1) APPLICANT'S BOND. (S2 R59)
2)

COUNTERBOND. (S3 R59).

3)

RECEIVER'S BOND. (S4 R59).

Q.

What is an applicant's bond?

A.

It is the bond which the court shall require the
applicant to file before issuing the order appointing
a receiver. It is executed to the party against whom
the application is presented, in an amount to be
fixed by the court, to the effect that the applicant
will pay such party all damages he may sustain by
reason of the appointment of such receiver in case
the applicant shall have procured such appointment
without sufficient cause; and the court may in its
discretion, at any time after the appointment,
require an additional bond as further security for
such damages. (S2 R59).

Q.

What are the grounds for the denial of the
application or the discharge of the receiver?

A.
1)

FILING OF COUNTERBOND. The application
may be denied or the receiver discharged,
when the adverse party files a bond executed
to the applicant, in an amount to be fixed by the
court, to the effect that such party will pay the
applicant all damages he may suffer by reason
of the acts, omissions, or other matters
specified in the application as ground for
such appointment.

2)

NO SUFFICIENT CAUSE. The receiver may
also be discharged if it is shown that his
appointment was obtained without sufficient
cause. (S3 R59).

Q.

What is a receiver's bond?

A.

The bond filed by the receiver before entering upon
his duties executed to such person and in such
sum as the court may direct, to the effect that he
will faithfully discharge his duties in the action
or proceeding and obey the orders of the court.
(S4 R59).

Q.

What acts of the receiver need court approval?
(IAC)

A.

Funds in the hands of a receiver may be invested
only by order of the court upon written consent of
all the parties to the action.
No action may be filed by or against the
receiver without leave of the court which appointed
him. (S6 R59).
A receiver cannot enter into a contract without
the approval of the court. (Pacific Merchandising
Corp. v. Consolacion Insurance & Surety Company,
73 SCRA 564).

Q.

When may the court order termination of the
receivership?

A.

Whenever the court, motu proprio or on motion of
either party, shall determine that the necessity for a
receiver no longer exists, it shall, after due notice to

Q.

The Asean Banking Corporatoin retained the
services of Atty. Victor Mamon in connection
with its contemplated suit against Dap Textile
Mills, Inc. (DAPO) for the collection of the
latter's loan in the amount of P650 million.
Payment of the loan was secured by a real
estate mortgage on the textile plant and the
land it occupied, both owned by DAPO.
At the time that the services of Atty. Mamon
were retained, the appraised value of the
mortgaged property was P256 million as
compared to the loan of P650 million. DAPO
defaulted on its loan after the union of its
employees had declared a strike which prevented
everyone from entering the factory premises.
As a consequence, DAPO ceased operations
and its textile plant had since then been
exposed to the elements and risk of fire due to
the presence of highly combustible materials
consisting of synthetic fibers.
The Asean Banking Corporation requested
Atty. Mamon to pursue a cause of action that
868

Rule 59
Receivership

would realize two principal objectives: (a)
obtain a judgment for the payment of any
deficiency arising from the foreclosure of the
mortgage lien; (b) procure the possession and
operation of a textile plant, either by Asean
Banking Corporation or by a third party during
the pendency of the foreclosure proceedings
and until the expiration of the redemption
period after the foreclosure sale, so that that
income derived therefrom could be applied in
partial payment of the loan.
What are the judicial remedies that Atty.
Mamon should pursue to accomplish the two
principal objectives of the Asean Banking
Corporation? (83 Bar Q15).
A.

Atty. Mamon in behalf of Asean Banking Corporation
should file a judicial action for foreclosure of
real estate mortgage and then after the sale, file a
motion for deficiency judgment. (S6 R68).
Upon filing of the foreclosure suit, Atty. Mamon
should in behalf of his client file a verified
application for the appointment of a receiver since
the textile plant is in danger of being wasted- or ·
dissipated or materially injured and its value is
insufficient to discharge the mortgage debt. The
receiver would be a third person except if there is a
written stipulation in the mortgage agreement that
Asean Banking Corporation may be appointed as a
receiver. (S1 [c] R59). The receiver would have the
power to take and keep possession of the property
in controversy and to collect debts due to the
corporaton of which he is the receiver and thus can
apply any income from the textile plant to the
payment of the loan. (S6 R59).

RULE 60. REPLEVIN
Q.

What is replevin?

A

A provisional remedy wherein a party praying for the
recovery of possession of personal property may apply
for an order for the delivery to him of such property
wrongfully detained by the adverse party. (S1 R60).
Replevin may also refer to the main action for
the recovery of personal property wrongfully
detained by the defendant.

Q.

Distinguish the provisional remedy of replevin
from attachment under S1(c) R57.

A

Replevin is available only where the principal relief
sought in the action is the recovery of possession
of personal property, while attachment under S1 (c)
R57 is available even if the recovery of personal
property is only an incidental relief sought in the
action. (2 FLORENZ D. REGALADO, REMEDIAL
th
LAW COMPENDIUM 436 [5 rev. ed.]).
Replevin extends only to personal property, while
attachment covers both real and personal property.
Replevin may be availed of to recover personal
property even if it is not being concealed, removed or
disposed of, while attachment presupposes that the
property has been concealed, removed, or disposed
of to prevent !ts being found or taken by the applicant.
In replevin, the personal property is delivered to
the applicant, while in S1 (c) R57, the personal property
is not delivered to the applicant but merely attached.
In replevin, the application may be made at the
commencement of the action or at any time before

870

Rule 60
Replevin

answer, while S1 (c) R57 may be applied for at the
commencement of the action or at any time before
entry of judgment.

Q.

A sold 5,000 piculs of sugar to B, payable on
demand. Upon delivery of the sugar to B,
however, the latter did not pay its purchase
price. After the lapse of some time from the date
of delivery of the sugar to B, A brought an
action for the rescission of the contract of sale
and as incident of this action, asked for the
manual delivery (replevin) of the sugar to him.
May the remedy of replevin prayed for by A be
granted? (96 Bar Q9[2]).

A.

No. Replevin is available only where the principal
relief sought in the action is the recovery of
possession of personal property and not where
such recovery is merely an incidental relief sought
in the action. (1 FLORENZ D. REGALADO,
REMEDIAL LAW COMPENDIUM 436 [5 th rev. ed.]).
Here the principal relief sought in the action is
the rescission of the sale contract, with recovery of
possession being merely incidental thereto.
In a case involving analogous facts, the
Supreme Court held that replevin will not lie for the
seller to re-possess the goods in case of nonpayment by the buyer because the filing of the
action for rescission will not ipso facto revest title in
the seller; it is the court judgment which will do so.
(Ocejo, Perez & Co. v. International Banking Corp,
37 Phil. 631, 642-643 [1918]).

Q.

When may a party apply for a writ of replevin?

Q.

After the filing of an answer, may the plaintiff
apply for a writ of replevin?

A.

No more since replevin may be applied for only
before answer. The possible remedy of the plaintiff
would be to move for a preliminary attachment
under S1 (c) R57.

Q.

In what actions may replevin be availed of as a
provisional remedy?

A.

It may be availed of only in actions for recovery of
possession of personal property.

Q.

If the debtor in a chattel mortgage refuses to
deliver the chattel so it can be sold at a
foreclosure sale, what is the remedy of the
creditor? Explain. (80 Bar QS)

A.

The creditor may (1) file an action to effect judicial
foreclosure directly of the chattel mortgage, or (2)
file an action for replevin to recover the chattel and
to apply for a writ of replevin under R60 as a
preliminary step to extrajudicial foreclosure under
Section 14 of the Chattel Mortgage Law. In (2), the
creditor may as an alternative to the recovery of the
chattel, pray for the payment of the principal
obligation. (Northern Motors Inc. v. Herrera, 49
SCRA 392 [1973]).

Q.

What are the requirements for the issuance of a
writ of replevin?

A.

AFFIDAVIT. The applicant must show by his own
affidavit or that of some other person who
personally knows the facts: (AWTO)
a) That the applicant is the owner of the property
or is entitled to its possession.
872

Enriquez filed with the RTC an action for replevin
with application for a writ of replevin against
Asuten to recover a van allegedly unlawfully
taken by Asuten. Upon the filing of a bond in the
amount of P600,000 (double the value of the van),
the sheriff seized the van pursuant to a writ of
replevin issued by the court. Subsequently
however the court dismissed the replevin case for
failure of Enriquez to prosecute. The court
ordered Enriquez to return the car to Asuten but
she failed to do so. The court thus ordered the
forfeiture of the entire bond in Asuten's favor.
a)

Was the order of the court proper?

b)

May the surety recover the P600,000 from
Enriquez?

a)

No. Forfeiture of the replevin bond, requires
first, a judgment on the merits in the
defendant's favor, and second, an application
by the defendant for damages. Neither

circumstance appears in this case. When
Enriquez failed to produce the van, equity
demanded that Asuten be awarded only an
amount equal to the value of the van. The
Regional Trial Court erred in ordering the
forfeiture of the entire bond in Asuten's favor,
considering that there was no trial on the merits
or an application by Asuten for damages.
b) Yes, by virtue of the indemnity agreement
between Enriquez and the surety wherein
Enriquez bound herself to indemnify the surety
for whatever amount the surety may have paid
on account of the bond. (Enriquez v. Mercantile
Insurance Co., 15 August 2018, Leanen, J.)
Q.

Is prior demand a condition precedent to the,18
filing of an action for a writ of replevin?

A.

No. Prior demand is not a condition precedent to
an aGtion for a writ of replevin, since there is
nothing in S2 R60 that requires the applicant to
make a demand on the possessor of the property
before an action for a writ of replevin could be filed.
(Agner v. BPI Family Bank, 3 June 2013).

Q.

Defendant Makati Textile Mills obtained a loan
from a finance company and in order to secure
the loan executed a chattel mortgage in favor of
the lender over the textile drying machines
which are located in its premises. For failure of
Defendant to pay, the Plaintiff finance company
seized under a writ of replevin the textile
machines in its premises. The Defendant
objected on the ground that the textile machines
are real property under Art. 415(5) of the Civil
Code. Is the Defendant's objection valid?
875

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

No. When Defendant executed a chattel mortgage
over the machines, it treated the same as personal
property. Hence the Defendant is estopped from
contending that the same are real property.

Textile Mills, G.R. No. 58469, 16 May 1983).

Q.

PCI Leasing filed with the RTC a complaint for
sum of money with an ex parte application for a
writ of replevin against Serg's Products Inc.
Pursuant to the writ of replevin issued by the
court, the sheriff went to the factory of Serg's
and seized machinery found therein. Records
show that a lease agreement had been executed
between PCI Leasing and Serg's whereby the
machinery was considered as personal property
and leased by Serg's from PCI Leasing.
a) Serg's contends that the seizure of the
machinery under a writ of replevin was
invalid since the machinery is real property
under Article 415(5) of the Civil Code. Is
Serg's contention correct?
b)

Serg's also moved to discharge the writ of
replevin on its contention that it was the
owner of the machinery. May the court take
cognizance of the motion to discharge the
writ on this ground?

A.
a) No. While the machinery is real property under
Article 415(5) of the Civil Code being essential
to the chocolate-making industry of Serg's, the
latter is estopped from arguing that the
machinery is not personal property. This is
because it had executed a lease agreement

876

J9JC9B0M

Rule 60

with PCI Leasing wherein it treated the
machinery as personal property. Under the
principle of estoppel, a party to a contract is
ordinarily precluded from denying the truth of
any material averment of fact found therein.
( Serg's Products Inc. v. PC/ Leasing & Finance
Co., G.R. 137705, 22 August 2000).
b)

No. The policy under R60 is that questions
involving title to the movable should be
determined during the trial proper. The
defendant's remedy is either to post a counterbond or to question the sufficiency of the
applicant's bond or of the surety/sureties
thereon. The defendant however cannot invoke
title to the movable seized in order to discharge
or dissolve the writ of replevin. (Id.).

Q.

Plaintiff bank filed a sum of money case
(P350,000) against an auto loan borrower with
the MTC of Pasay City. The Plaintiff also applied
for a writ of replevin and was able to seize the
car valued at P500,000. The Defendant filed a
motion to dismiss on the ground that
jurisdiction should be with the RTC. Should the
Defendant's motion to dismiss be granted?

A.

No. The SC held that in a sum of money case,
jurisdiction is determined by the amount of the
claim not by the value of the vehicle seized under
the writ of replevin. (Fernandez v. International
Corporate Bank, 7 October 1999).

Q.

In 1996, respondents spouses Eliezer and Leila
Adlawan obtained a P3,669,685.00 loan from
petitioner Central Visayas Finance Corporation
covered by a promissory note and a chattel
mortgage over a Komatsu Highway Dump Truck.
Respondents failed to pay the loan,
prompting petitioner to file an action against
respondents for replevin before the Cebu Regional
Trial Court, docketed as Civil Case No. 22294
(replevin case). The principal relief sought was for
the recovery of the possession of the dump truck,
which was used as a collateral in the mortgage
contract between the parties. In the event that
delivery thereof cannot be effected, petitioner
stated an alternative prayer, that is, for the
respondents to pay the amount of P2,604,604.97
which represented their outstanding obligation.
In its 1999 decision, the trial court ruled in
petitioner's
favor and respondents
were
ordered to deliver possession of the dump truck
to petitioner. Petitioner then extrajudicially
foreclosed on the chattel mortgage and caused
the sale at public auction of the dump truck,
which was then sold to it as the highest bidder
for P500,000.00.
In 2000, petitioner commenced a second
case before the RTC - Civil Case No. 24841 - this
time for collection of sum of money and/or
deficiency judgment relative to respondents'

878

Rule 60
Replevin

supposed unpaid balance on their loan, which
petitioner claimed to be at Php2, 104,604.97 less the value of dump truck - with damages
(deficiency case).
Was the second action barred by res judicata?
A.

Yes. Under S47(b) R39, a judgment or final order is
conclusive not only with respect to the matter
directly adjudged but also to any other matter that
could have been raised in relation thereto.
By failing to seek a deficiency judgment in the
replevin case after its case for recovery of
possession was resolved, petitioner is barred from
instituting another action for such deficiency.
Pursuant to S47(b) R39, on the effect of judgments
or final orders, the judgment in the replevin case is,
with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to
any other matter that could have been raised in
relation thereto, conclusive between the petitioner
and respondents.
Petitioner's argument that the replevin case and
the deficiency case involved different causes of
action is without merit. Petitioner ignores the fact
that it prayed in the replevin case that in the event
manual delivery of the vehicle could not be effected,
the court render judgment in its favor by ordering
respondents to pay P2,604,604.97. Following S47(b)
R39, petitioner's second complaint is barred by res
judicata. (Central Visayas Finance Corp. v. Ad/awan,
138
25 March 2019, Del Castillo, J.).

138
The holding that the replevin case and the deficiency case involve the
same cause of action is arguable. The replevin case should be distinguished
from extrajudicial foreclosure, which is a separate proceeding. II is inappropriate
for the petitioner to seek a deficiency judgment in the replevin case since a
deficiency judgment or award can be sought only after the foreclosure sale. The

thereon. The comment shall be verified and
shall be accompanied by affidavits, depositions
or other authentic documents.

3)

After the filing of the comment or the expiration
of the time therefore, the application shall be
set for hearing not more than 3 days thereafter.

4)

The court shall make a provisional determination
of the facts and may grant the application. If
granted, the court issue an order granting
support and shall fix the amount of money to be
provisionally paid or such other forms of
support as should be provided, taking into
account the necessities of the applicant and the
resources or means of the adverse party, and
the terms of payment or mode for providing
support. (nrt) If the application is denied, the
principal case shall be tried and decided as
early as possible.

5)

If the adverse party fails to comply with the
order granting support, the court shall, motu

execution against him, without prejudice to his
liability for contempt. When the party ordered
to give support pendente lite refuses or fails to

Q.

Husband Masiba was ordered by the court to
give support pendente lite to wife Kawawa and minor son, Munti, based on Kawawa's testimony
supported by her documentary evidence that
Masiba has failed to give a single centavo of
support inspite of constant requests and demands
for support.
Masiba filed an appeal questioning the
order stating that there were no hearings and
reception of evidence before the order was
issued and that given his day in court, he could
prove beyond doubt that his wife is much richer
than he is and could well afford to support
herself and their son.

A.

The appeal should be dismissed.
No appeal may be taken from an interlocutory
order. (S1[b] R41). Here the order granting support
pendente lite is an interlocutory order since it does
not completely dispose of the case. The court still
has to render its judgment in the principal case.

Q.

What is interpleader?

A.

lnterpleader is a special civil action whereby a
person who claims no interest whatsoever in a
property or right, or an interest which in whole or in
part is not disputed by the claimants, brings an
action against the conflicting claimants to compel
them to interplead and litigate their several claims
among themselves. (S1 R62). lnterpleader is used
to avoid double or multiple liability on the part"'
of the obligor.

Q.

A.

1) The stakeholder files a complaint against the
conflicting claimants.
2)

Upon the filing of the complaint, the court shall
issue an order requiring the conflicting
claimants to interplead with each other.

3)

Summons shall be served upon the the
conflicting claimants, together with a copy of
the complaint and order.

4) Within the time for filing an answer, each
claimant may file a motion to dismiss on the
ground of impropriety of the interpleader or on
other grounds in S16.
5)

Each claimant shall file his answer setting forth
his claim within 15 days from service of
summons, serving a copy upon each of the
other conflicting claimants who may file their

reply thereto. A claimant who fails to timely file
his answer may, on motion, be declared in
default and thereafter the court may render
judgment barring him from any claim regarding
the subject matter.
6)

The court shall proceed to determine the
respective rights of the conflicting claimants
and to adjudicate their several claims.

Q.

Plaintiff engaged X to construct a water tank for
him for a price of P1 ,000,000. Plaintiff withheld
delivery of the last payment of P30,000 to X
since X's supplier S had made a claim to the
same. Unable to determine who between X and
S is entitled to the P30,000 payment, Plaintiff
filed with the RTC of Las Pinas City an action
for interpleader against X and S to determine
who between them is entitled to the P30,000. X
filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the
RTC has no jurisdiction over the action. Should
the motion to dismiss be granted?

A

Yes. The MeTC has no jurisdiction over the case
since the amount subject of the interpleader does
not exceed P400,000. Under B.P. Big. 129, the MTC
has jurisdiction over civil actions where the value of
the personal property, estate, or amount of the
demand does not exceed P400,000. (See Makati
Oev't Corp. v. Tanjuatco, 27 SCRA 401 [19691).
However where the subject of the interpleader
is not the possession or title of real or personal
property but the performance of a service, it is clear
that the RTC has jurisdiction as the subject thereof
is incapable of pecuniary estimation.

Q.

Raphael, a warehouseman, filed a complaint
against V Corporation, X Corporation, and Y
Corporation to compel them to interplead. He
alleged therein that the three corporations
claimed title and right of possession over the
goods deposited in his warehouse and that he
was uncertain which of them was entitled to the
goods. After due proceedings, judgment was
rendered by the court declaring that X Corporation
was entitled to the goods. The decision became
final and executory.
Raphael filed a complaint
against X
Corporation for the payment of P100,000 for
storage charges and other advances for the
goods. X Corporation filed a motion to dismiss
the complaint on the ground of res judicata. X
Corporation alleged that Raphael should have
incorporated in his complaint for interpleader
his claim for storage fees and advances and
that for his failure he was barred from
interposing his claim. Raphael replied that he
could not have claimed storage fees and other
advances in his complaint for interpleader
because he was not yet certain as to who was
liable therefor. Resolve the motion with reasons.
(05 Bar Q4).

A.

I would deny the motion to dismiss grounded on res
judicata.
An interpleader suit is not based on a cause of
action since there is no act or omission by which the
defendants violated the right of the complainant. The
complainant is simply seeking to compel the
defendants to interplead among themselves. Hence
res judicata and splitting of cause of action would
891

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

not apply since the complaint is not based on a
cause of action.
X Corporation's allegation that Raphael should
have incorporated in his complaint for interpleader
his claim for storage fees and advances is incorrect
since joinder of causes of action shall not include
special civil actions like interpleader. (S5 R2).
Q.

Bliss Development Corporation (BDC) is the
registered owner of Lot No. 27. In 1984, BDC
executed a deed of sale over the property in
favor of the Spouses Melgazo. The Spouses
Melgazo allegedly transferred their rights to
Nacua. Further assignments of rights were made
and eventually the rights were transferred to
Diaz. BDC executed a contract to sell in favor of
Diaz and received payments for Lot 27 from Diaz.
Later, Arreza claimed that the Spouses
Melgazo had sold the rights over the property to
him. To resolve the conflicting claims of Arreza
and Diaz, BDC filed a complaint for interpleader
against them before the RTC of Makati City. In
March 1996, the RTC ruled that the signatures
. of Sps. Melgazo transferring their rights to
Nacua were forged and thus Arreza had a better
right over the property. This decision became
final and executory.
In August 1996, Diaz filed a complaint for
sum of money against BDC and Arreza before
the RTC of Makati City. Diaz argued that BDC's
representations led him to believe that he had a
good title over the property, but due to the
court's ruling in the interpleader case, he was
constrained to transfer the property to Arreza.

892

Rule 62
lnterpleader

Diaz prayed for reimbursement from BDC and
Arreza. In their respective answers, BDC and
Arreza argued that Diaz's complaint for
reimbursement is barred by res judicata since it
should have been raised in the interpleader suit.
Are BDC and Arreza correct?

A.

Arreza is correct in his argument that Diaz'
complaint for reimbursement is barred by res
judicata. Diaz' complaint is in the nature of a
compulsory counterclaim which should have been
raised in the interpleader suit. Not having been
raised, the same is barred pursuant to S2 R9.
However, BOC is not correct in its argument
that Diaz' complaint for reimbursement is barred by
res judicata. The essential elements of res judicata
are not present. First, the interpleader case was
between Arreza and Diaz. While it was BOC that
initiated the interpleader case, the opposing parties
in that prior case are, in fact, Arreza and Diaz.
Second, the issues resolved in the interpleader
case revolved around the conflicting claims of
Arreza and Diaz, and not whatever claim either of
them may have against BOC. Thus, there is no
identity of parties, nor identity of subject matter,
between the interpleader case and the complaint
for sum of money. (Bliss Dev't Corp. v. Diaz, 5
August 2015, Velasco, J.).

case to compel Petitioner and the Philippine
Bank of Communications to litigate their claims.
Thus, "[d]eclaring a claimant in default would
ironically defeat the very purpose of the suit." Is
the argument of Petitioner correct?
A.

No. In this case, Zuellig filed the interpleader case
to extinguish its obligation to pay rent. Its purpose
in filing the interpleader case "was not defeated"
when the Makati trial court declared Petitioner in
default. At any rate, an adverse claimant in an
interpleader case who fails to answer within the
required period may, on motion, be declared in
default pursuant to S5 R62. The consequence of
the default is that the court may "render judgment
barring [the defaulted claimant] from any claim in
respect to the subject matter." The Rules would not
have allowed claimants in interpleader cases to be
declared in default if it would "ironically defeat the
very purpose of the suit." (Lui Enterprises v. Zuellig
Pharma, 12 March 2014).

Q.

Who pays the docket fees on the conficting
claims subject of the interpleader suit?

A.

The conflicting claimants themselves. Since the
defendants-in-interpleader are actually the ones
who make a claim - only that it was extraordinarily
done through the procedural device of interpleader
- then to them devolves the duty to pay the docket
fees prescribed under S7 R141. S7 R62 pertains
only to the docket fees for initiating the interpleader
suit itself not the claims subject thereof since the
one who initiated the interpleader suit claims no
interest whatsoever in the subject matter. (Bank of
Commerce v. Planters Development Bank, 24
September 2012).

RULE 63. DECLARATORY RELIEF
& SIMILAR REMEDIES
Q.

What are the remedies provided for in Rule 63?

A.

The first is declaratory relief under the first
paragraph of Rule 63.
The second paragraph provides for "similar
remedies" or more specifically the remedies
of: (QCR)
1) Action for reformation of an instrument.
2)

Action to quiet title.

3) Action to consolidate ownership over the real
property by the vendee a retro pursuant to
Article 1607 of the Civil Code.
Q.

What is declaratory relief?

A.

A special civil action brought by a person interested
under a· deed, will, contract or other written
instrument, or whose rights are affected by a
statute, executive order or regulation, ordinance, or
any other governmental regulation (serog) to
determine any question of construction or validity
arising, and for a declaration of his rights or duties,
thereunder. (S1 R63). (IR CV RD)

Q.

Is the enumeration of the subject matter of a
declaratory relief proceeding exclusive?

A

Yes. Hence sufficiency or probative value of
evidence, declaration of Philippine citizenship

court decision (DILG v. Gatuz, 14 October 2015't ---- -and orders, resolutions, or decisions of quasijudicial bodies (id.) may not be the subject matter of
an action for declaratory relief.
Q.

When may the petition for declaratory relief be
brought?

A.

It should be brought before breach or violation of
the contract or written instrument or of the statute,
executive order or regulation, ordinance, or
governmental regulation. (S1 R63).

Q.

Respondents mortgaged their land to CHF Inc.
Because Respondents had defaulted in their
obligations,CHF initiated foreclosureproceedings
but the same was restrained because of an
injunction suit filed by Respondents. The
Respondents then filed an action for declaratory
relief with the CFI of Caloocan City seeking
a declaration of the extent of their actual
indebtedness to CHF. CHF was declared in
default and in due course judgment
was
rendered fixing the Respondents' liability at
P15 million and authorizing them to consign the
amount in court. No appeal was interposed
from the decision. Subsequently CHF initiated
anew foreclosure proceedings. Respondents
argued that the same was barred by the
judgment in the declaratory relief case. Is the
Respondents' argument meritorious?

A.

No. An action for declaratory relief by a person
interested under a deed or written instrument should
be filed before breach or violation of the deed.
Where the contract has already been breached prior

896

Rule 63
Declaratory Relief & Similar Remedies

to the filing of an action for declaratory relief, the
court can no longer assume jurisdiction over the
action. Here the loan contract had already been
breached prior to the filing of the declaratory relief
petition. Hence the judgment in the declaratory relief
case was a nullity and cannot stand as a bar to the
foreclosure proceeding. (Tambunting v. Bae/lo, 16
September 2005).
Q.

In June 2011, the respondent Mayor of Malay,
Aklan issued the assailed EO 10, ordering the
closure and demolition of Boracay West Cove's
hotel on the ground that its construction in a
forest area was illegal. EO 10 was partially
implemented on June 10, 2011. Thereafter, two
more instances followed wherein respondents
demolished the improvements introduced -by ·
Boracay West Cove, the most recent of which
was made in February 2014. Alleging that the
order was issued and executed with grave
abuse of discretion, petitioner filed a Petition
for Certiorari with prayer for injunctive relief
with the Court of Appeals.
The CA dismissed the petition solely on a
procedural ground, i.e., the special writ of
certiorari can only be directed against a
tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions and since the issuance
of EO 10 was done in the exercise of executive
functions, and not of judicial or quasi-judicial
functions, certiorari will not lie. Instead, the
proper remedy for the petitioner, according to
the CA, is to file a petition for declaratory relief
with the Regional Trial Court. Is a petition for
declaratory relief the proper remedy?
897

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

No. An action for declaratory relief presupposes that
there has been no actual breach of the instruments
involved or of the rights arising thereunder.
In the case at bar, the petition for declaratory
relief became unavailable by EO 1O's enforcement
and implementation. The closure and demolition of
the hotel rendered futile any possible guidelines that
may be issued by the trial court for carrying out the
directives in the challenged EO 10. Indubitably, the
CA erred when it ruled that declaratory relief is the
proper remedy given such a situation. (Aquino v.
Municipality of Malay, Aklan, 29 September 2014 ).

Q.

Which court has jurisdiction over an action for
declaratory relief?

A.

The Regional Trial Court since an action for
declaratory
relief is incapable of pecuniary
estimation. (Office of the Ombudsman v. /bay, G.R.
137538, 3 September 2001 ). However if the petition
has far-reaching implications and raises questions
that should be resolved, the Supreme Court may
treat the petition as one for prohibition or mandamus
and take cognizance thereof. (Alliance of Gov't
Workers v. Minister of Labor and Employment,
124 SCRA 7).

Q.

Resources Unlimited, a well-financed foreign
corporation would like to engage in a taxexempt business venture in the Philippines. Its
management, however, entertains some doubts
as to whether it could, in the light of the
provisions of the Investments Incentive Act. To
resolve all doubts and to obtain a declaration of
its rights and duties under the said law, it filed a
petition for declaratory relief with the Supreme

898

Rule 63
Declaratory Relief & Similar Remedies

Court. How will you resolve said petition?
Discuss. (85 Bar Q17).

A.

I would resolve to dismiss the petition for lack of
jurisdiction.
It is the Regional Trial Court, not the Supreme
Court, which has jurisdiction since an action for
declaratory relief is incapable of pecuniary
estimation. (Office of the Ombudsman v. /bay, G.R.
137538, 3 September 2001).
Even if the petition were filed in the RTC, it
should still be dismissed. In declaratory relief, there
must be an actual justiciable controversy or
the ripening seeds of one between persons whose
interests are adverse. (Tolentino v. Board of
Accountancy, G.R. No. L-3062, 28 September
1951). A petition for judicial relief cannot be used to
get an advisory opinion from the court.

Q.

In January 2005, the City of Cagayan de Oro,
through its local legislative council, enacted an
ordinance which imposed an annual mayor's
permit fee of P500 on every electric or
telecommunications post belonging to public
utility companies operating in the city. The
Cagayan Electric Power and Light Company
(CEPALCO) filed a Petition for Declaratory
Relief with Damages & Prayer for Temporary
Restraining Order & Preliminary Injunction before
the Cagayan RTC assailing the ordinance's
validity. CEPALCO contended that the imposition,
in the guise of police power, was unlawful for
violating the fundamental principle that fees,
charges, and other impositions shall not be
unjust, excessive, oppressive, or confiscatory.
899

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

The RTC dismissed the petition for failure of
CEPALCO to exhaust administrative remedies
pursuant to Section 187 of the Local Government
Code. The RTC stated that CEPALCO neglected
to appeal the ordinance to the Secretary of
Justice. Was the dismissal proper?
A.

No. Section 187 of the Local Government Code,
which outlines the administrative procedure for
questioning the constitutionality or legality of a tax
ordinance or revenue measure and which requires
that an appeal of a tax ordinance or revenue
measure should be made to the Secretary of
Justice within 30 days from the effectivity of the
ordinance, does not find application in cases where
the imposition is in the nature of a regulatory fee,
not a tax or revenue measure. Here the purpose of
the ordinance was the city's need to impose some
form of regulation on the construction of electric
and telecommunications poles. Hence there was no
procedural barrier preventing CEPALCO from
instituting the instant petition for declaratory relief
before the RTC. ( City of Cagayan de Oro v.
CEPALCO, 17 October 2018, Reyes, J.).

Q.

In August 1969, Daymiel (respondent) served as
a casual laborer of the Provincial Engineering
Office of the ProvincialGovernmentof Zamboanga
del Norte. Eventually, respondent assumed the
position of Accounting Clerk Ill until his
retirement in July 2003. Thereupon, respondent
applied for retirement benefits before the
Government Service Insurance System (GSIS).
A tentative computation was made pursuant to
respondent's application. Initially, GSIS granted
respondent a total of 33.6 years of creditable
service with a lump sum payment equivalent to
900

J9JC9B0M

Rule 63
Declaratory Relief & Similar Remedies

P542,325. However, a re-computation was made
wherein GSIS credited respondent only with
23.8 years of service instead of the initial 33.6.
Accordingly, respondent's lump sum payment
was decreased to P384,295.80. Unsatisfied with
the computation, respondent wrote a letter to
the GSIS and inquired as to the legal basis for
such computation.
It appears that the re-computation was
made as a result of the implementation of Policy
and Procedural Guidelines No. 171-03 (PPG No.
171-03) dated 24 March 2003 issued by then
GSIS President and General Manager Winston
F. Garcia. PPG No. 171-03 was subsequently
approved by the GSIS Board of Trustees in
Resolution No. 90 dated April 2, 2003.
Respondent thus filed with the RTC a
petition for declaratory
relief seeking the
nullification of PPG No. 171-03 and Resolution
No. 90 on the ground of illegality. He argued
that PPG 171-03 pegged the starting point of the
computation on the date of payment of monthly
contributions whereas the GSIS Act pegged the
starting point at the date of original appointment.
GSIS filed a motion to dismiss invoking the
GSIS Act which vests in the GSIS the original
and exclusive jurisdiction to hear disputes on
laws administered by it. The RTC granted the
motion to dismiss. Was the dismissal proper?
A.

No. What the respondent is seeking for is the
nullification of PPG No. 171-03 and Resolution No.
90 on the ground of illegality. While respondent's
contention deals with a dispute as to the
computation of his retirement benefits, his petition
901

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

mainly attacks the legality of the assailed
issuances, that is, a mere policy of the president of
a GOCC or Board Resolution cannot amend or
modify a law passed by Congress. The determination
of whether a rule issued by an administrative
agency contravenes the law or the Constitution is
within the jurisdiction of the regular courts via a
petition for declaratory relief. (GS/S v. Daymiel, 11
March 2019, Reyes, J.).
Q.

Which court has jurisdiction over an action for
reformation of an instrument?

A.

The Regional Trial Court since an action for
reformation of an instrument is incapable of
pecuniary estimation.

Q.

Which court has jurisdiction over an action for
quieting of title?

A.

As a rule the RTC since the action is one incapable
of pecuniary estimation. Howevei, where the
principal relief sought is the recovery of possession
or title to real property or interest therein, the action
would be a real one and jurisdiction would depend
on the assessed value of the real property. (Reterta
v. Mores, 17 August 2011 ).

Q.

Which court has jurisdiction over an action to
consolidate ownership over real property
pursuant to Article 1607?

A.

The MTC or RTC depending on the assessed value
of the subject real property. This is because the
action is a real one:

Q.

Is there a cause of action in proceedings for
declaratory relief?

902

Rule 63
Declaratory Relief & Similar Remedies

A.

Yes because of the. expanded concept of cause of
actions in proceedings for declaratory relief. The
concept of cause of actions in declaratory relief is
not, as in ordinary civil action, the wrong or delict by
which the Plaintiff's rights are violated, but is
extended to a mere denial, refusal or challenge
raising at least an uncertainty or insecurity which is
injurious to plaintiff's rights. (Id.). It is permitted on~
the theory that courts should be allowed to act, not
only when harm is actually done and rights
jeo,:2ardized by physical wrongs or physical attack
upon existing legal relation, but also when
challenge, refusal, dispute, or denial thereof is
made amounting to a live controversy. (Multi-Realty
Oev't Corp. v. Makati Tuscany Condominium Corp.,
G.R. 146726, 16 June 2006).

Q.

May the petitioner move for a summary
judgment in an action for declaratory relief?

A.

Yes. (S1 R35).

Q.

Who should be made parties to a declaratory
relief proceeding?

A.

All persons who have or claim any interest which
would be affected by the declaration shall be made
parties; and no declaration shall prejudice the rights
of persons not parties to the action, unless
otherwise provided in the Rules of Court. (S2 R63).

Q.

What is the effect of the failure to include as
defendant a party who would be adversely affected
by the declaratory judgment of the court?

A.

The non-joinder of persons who claim any interes(
which may be affected by a declaratory judgment is
not a jurisdictional defect as S2 R63 provides that

903
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

said declaration shall not prejudice their interests.
Since the judgment in a declaratory relief case is
merely declaratory and not executory, the rule
on compulsory joinder of indispensable parties
does not apply.
Q.

When is notice to the Solicitor General or to the
prosecutor or attorney of a local government
unit involved required?

A.

In any action which involves the validity of a statute,
executive order or regulation, or any other
governmental regulation (serg), the Solicitor General
shall be notified by the party assailing the same
and shall be entitled to be heard upon such
question. (S3 R63).
In any action which involving the validity of a
local government ordinance, the corresponding
prosecutor or attorney of the local government unit
involved shall be similarly notified and entitled to
be heard. If such ordinance is alleged to be
unconstitutional, the Solicitor General shall also be
notified and entitled to be heard. (S4 R63).

Q.

May the court refuse to hear or try a declaratory
relief petition?

A.

Yes. The court motu proprio or upon motion, may
refuse to exercise the power to declare rights and
to construe instruments in any case where a
decision would not terminate the uncertainty or
controversy which gave rise to the action, or in any
case where the declaration or construction is not
necessary and proper under the circumstances.
(S5 R63). Note that this provision does not apply to
an action for reformation, quieting of title, or
consolidation of ownership. (Id.).
904

Rule 63
Declaratory Relief & Similar Remedies

Q.

May a declaratory relief action be converted into
an ordinary action?

A.

Yes if before the final termination of the case, a
breach or violation of an instrument or a statute,
executive order or regulation, ordinance, or any
other governmental regulation should take place,
the action may thereupon be converted into an
ordinary action, and the parties shall be allowed to
file such pleadings as may be necessary and
proper. (S6 R63).

RULE 64. REVIEW OF JUDGMENTS AND
FINAL ORDERS OR RESOLUTIONS OF THE
COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND THE
COMMISSION ON AUDIT
Q.

What is nature and purpose of Rule 64?

A.

Rule 64 is a remedy available to a party who seeks
the review by the Supreme Court of a judgment or
final order or resolution of the Commission on
Elections and the Commission on Audit.
While a mode of review, R64 clearly provides
that it is governed by the provisions of R65 on
certiorari, except as provided in R64. Paradoxically,
R64 is a special civil action of certiorari which is not
an original action but a mode of review.

Q.

What is the basis of R64?

A.

Section 7 of Article IX of the Constitution which
provides that "[u]nless otherwise provided by this
Constitution or by law, any decision, order, or ruling
of each Commission may be brought to the
Supreme Court on certiorari by the aggrieved party
within thirty days from receipt of a copy thereof." In
Dario v. Mison, G.R. No. 81954, 8 August 1989, the
Supreme Court held that the word certiorari in this
provision refers to the special civil action of
certiorari under R65 not the petition for review on
certiorari under R45.

Q.

Why is the Civil Service Commission excluded
from the coverage of R64?

A.

Because R.A. No. 7902 provides that the appeal
from the CSC shall be to the Court of Appeals.
906

J9JC9B0M

Rule 64
Review Of Judgments And Final Orders
Or Resolutions Of The Commission On Elections
And The Commission On Audit

Hence judgments or final orders of the CSC
should be appealed to the Court of Appeals
pursuant to R43.
Q.

Esteves filed an election protest with the RTC of
Baler, Aurora. Bitong moved to dismiss the
election protest because it did not specify the
precincts where fraud and irregularities were
allegedly committed. The RTC issued an order
denying the motion to dismiss. Bitong assailed
the denial in a petition for certiorari and
prohibition with the COMELEC. The COMELEC
(2 nd Division) rendered a decision which
nullified the RTC's denial order and dismissed
Esteves' election protest. Esteves then filed a
petition for certiorari under Rule 64 with the SC
nd
assailing the 2 Division's decision. May the
petition of Esteves be dismissed?

A.

Yes. Under Article IX-C, Section 3 of the
Constitution, an aggrieved party must first file a
motion for reconsideration of a resolution of a
Division to the COMELEC en bane. This requirement
of a motion for reconsideration is mandatory and
jurisdictional in invoking the power of review of the
High Court. Failure to abide by this requirement
constitutes a good ground for the dismissal of the
petition. (Esteves v. Sarmiento, G.R. 182374, 11
November 2008).

Q.

Within what time should the
certiorari under R64 be filed?

A.

The petition shall be filed within 30 days from notice
of the judgment or final order or resolution sought
to be reviewed. If a motion for new trial or
reconsideration is filed and denied, the movant
907

J9JC9B0M

petition

for

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

shall have the remaining period within which to file
the petition but which shall not be less than 5 days,
reckoned from notice of the denial. (S3 R64).
Q.

On 4 February 2008 the Petitioner received the
resolution of the COMELEC's First Division. On
8 February 2008, the Petitioner filed a motion for
reconsideration of the resolution which motion
was elevated to the COMELEC en bane for
resolution. On 22 September 2008 the Petitioner
received the resolution of COMELEC en bane
denying his motion for reconsideration. On 22
October 2008, Petitioner filed with the Supreme
Court his petition for certiorari under R64 to set
aside the COMELEC en bane's resolution.
Respondent moved to dismiss on the ground
that the petition was filed out of time. Petitioner
contended that pursuant to the Neypes rule, he
had a fresh 30-day period from 22 September,
the day when he received notice of the denial of
his motion for reconsideration. Was the petition
for certiorari under R64 timely filed?

A

No. The petition was not timely filed and thus
should be dismissed. Under S3 R64, if a motion
for reconsideration of a judgment or final order of
the COMELEC is filed and denied, the movant shall
file the petition within the remaining period, but
which shall not be less than 5 days in any event,
reckoned from notice of denial. Since the Petitioner
had used up 3 days at the time he filed his motion
for reconsideration on 8 February, then his
remaining period was only 27 days, not 30 days. 139

139
1n the case, the Supreme Court committed an oversight in stating that
Petitioner had a remaining period of 26 days. The Petitioner actually had 27 days
left. The day when he filed his motion for reconsideration (February 8), which
interrupts the running of the period, is excluded in the computation of the period,

908

Rule 64
Review Of Judgments And Final Orders
Or Resolutions Of The Commission On Elections
And The Commission On Audit

Hence the Petition which was filed on the 30th day
from notice of the denial of his motion for
reconsideration was filed out of time.
Petitioner's argument that he had a fresh 30day period from notice of denial of his motion for
reconsideration is without merit. The Neypes rule
does not apply to petitions under R64 since there is
an explicit provision in S3 R64 which states that the
movant has only the remaining period, which shall
not less than 5 days, to file his petition, reckoned
from notice of denial. (Pates v. COMELEC, G.R.
184915, 30 June 2009, e.b.).
Q.

Will the filing of the petition for certiorari under
R64 stay the execution of the judgment or final
order sought to be reviewed?

A.

No, unless the Supreme Court shall direct
otherwise upon such terms as it may deem just.
(S8 R64).

and forms part of the remaining period counted from notice of denial of the
motion. (See 82 R22; De las Alas v. CA, 83 SCRA 200). Hence the remaining
period is 27 (not 26) days and thus the last day of the remaining period fell on 19
October 2008 (Sunday) and not 18 October 2008 (Saturday). The oversight
nonetheless did not affect the correctness of the result since Petitioner had filed
his petition on 22 October 2008, which was still beyond the effective last day of
20 October 2008 (Monday).

RULE 65. CERTIORARI, PROHIBITION,
AND MANDAMUS
Q.

Which court has jurisdiction over the special
civil actions for certiorari, prohibition, and
mandamus?

A.

There is concurrent original jurisdiction among the
Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, the Regional Trial
Courts, the Sandiganbayan, and the COMELEC.
In City of Manila v. Grecia-Cuerdo, 4 February
2014 (e.b.), the Supreme Court held that it is the
Court of Tax Appeals, not the Court of Appeals,
which has jurisdiction over a special civil action for
certiorari assailing an interlocutory order issued by
the RTC in a local tax case, since such a case falls
within the CTA's exclusive appellate jurisdiction.

Q.

Does it mean then that a person has an
unfettered discretion to choose which among
the aforesaid courts he may file the special civil
action under R65?

A

No. The concurrence of jurisdiction should not be
taken to mean that the parties have an absolute,
unrestrained freedom of choice of the court to
which they will file their application or petition.
There is an ordained sequence of recourse to
courts vested with concurrent jurisdiction beginning
from the lowest to the highest. This hierarchy is
determinative of the venue of appeals and is
likewise determinative of the proper forum for
petitions for extraordinary writs. A direct invocation
of the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction to issue
these writs should be allowed only when there
910

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

are special and important reasons therefor, clearly
and specifically set out in the petition. (Montes v.
Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 143797, 4 May 2006).
This is known as the principle or doctrine of
"hierarchy of courts."
Q.

On 15 December 2014, the Department of
Transportation and Communication (DOTC) and
its attached agency, the Civil Aviation Authority
of the Philippines (CAAP), posted an Invitation
to Pre-qualify and Bid (Invitation) on the airport
development, operations, and maintenance_ of
the Bacolod-Silay, Davao, lloilo, Laguindingan,
New Bohol (Panglao), and Puerto Princesa
Airports (collectively, Projects). On March 10,
2015, the DOTC and the CAAP issued the
Instructions
to Prospective Bidders (ITPB),
which provided that prospective bidders are to
pre-qualify
and bid for the development,
operations, and maintenance of the airports,
which are now bundled into two groups
(collectively, the Bundled Projects), namely:
Bundle 1: Bacolod-Silay and lloilo; and Bundle
2: Davao, Laguindingan,
and New Bohol
(Panglao). The costs of Bundle 1 and Bundle 2
are P50.66 Billion and P59.66 Billion, respectively.
The Puerto Princesa Airport project was not
included in the bundling.
On 27 March 2015, petitioner GIOS-SAMAR,
Inc., suing as a taxpayer and invoking the
transcendental importance of the issue, filed a
petition for prohibition with the Supreme Court.
Petitioner argues that the bundling of the
Projects is unconstitutional because it will: (i)
create a monopoly; (ii) allow the creation and
operation of a combination in restraint of trade;
911

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

(iii) violate anti-dummy laws and statutes giving
citizens the opportunity to invest in public
utilities; and (iv) enable companies with shaky
financial backgrounds to participate in the
Projects. Was the filing of the petition for
prohibition with the Supreme Court proper?
A.

No. While the Supreme Court has original and
concurrent jurisdiction over petitions for certiorari,
prohibition, and mandamus with other courts,
litigants do not have unfettered discretion to invoke
the SC's original jurisdiction. The doctrine of
hierarchy of courts dictates that, direct recourse to
this Court is allowed only to resolve questions of
law, notwithstanding the invocation of paramount
or transcendental importance of the action. This
doctrine is not mere policy, rather, it is a
constitutional filtering mechanism designed to
enable the Court to focus on the more fundamental
and essential tasks assigned to it by the highest
law of the land.
Petitioner's arguments against the constitutionality
of the bundling of the Projects are inextricably
intertwined with underlying questions of fact, the
determination of which require the reception of
evidence. The SC, however, is not a trier of fact. It
cannot resolve these factual issues at the first instance.
Hence the petition should be dismissed. (Gios-Samar
Inc. v. OOTC, e.b., 12 March 2019, Jardeleza, J.).

Sec. 1. Petition for certiorari
Q.

What is the special civil action of certiorari?

A.

An extraordinary remedy by which an aggrieved
person prays for a judgment annulling or modifying
912

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

the proceedings of a tribunal, board or officer
exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions on the
ground that such tribunal, board or officer has acted
without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of or
excess of jurisdiction. (S1 R65).
Q.

Define the phrase "without jurisdiction."

A.

It refers to a case where the court or quasi-court
does not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the
case or dispute.

Q.

Define the phrase "in excess of jurisdiction."

A.

It refers to a case where the court or quasi-court
has subject-matter jurisdiction but it issues an order
which it has no power or which is beyond its power
to do so. For instance the RTC of Manila issues a
preliminary injunction seeking to restrain a person
in Batangas from performing a particular act.

Q.

Define the phrase "with grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of or excess of jurisdiction."

A.

When a court or quasi-court abuses its discretion in
a manner which is so patent and gross as to
amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual
refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act
at all in contemplation of law. For instance a court
grants a motion for preliminary attachment on the
sole ground that the defendant is in imminent
danger of insolvency.

Q.

May an administrative
agency
like the
Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication
Board issue writs of certiorari?

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

No. Administrative agencies, such as the Department
of Agrarian Refonn Adjudication Board (DARAB),
are not courts of law exercising judicial power. The
power to issue writs of certiorari is an incident of
judicial review. Thus, administrative agencies may
not issue writs of certiorari to annul acts of officers
or state organs even when they exercise supervisory
authority over these officers or organs. (Zoleta v.
Land Bank, 9 August 2017, Leanen, J.).

Q.

Petitioners, who are complainants before the
prosecutor's office in Davao City, filed a petition
for certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus
against the Secretary of Justice to set aside the
issuance of a department order which directed
all prosecutors to forward all cases already filed
against Celso de los Angeles of the Legacy
Group to the Secretariat of the Special Panel
created by the Department of Justice in Manila.
Was the filing of the petition proper?

A.

No. Petitions for certiorari and prohibition are
directed only to tribunals that exercise judicial
or quasi-judicial functions. The issuance of the
department order was a purely administrative or
executive function of the Secretary of Justice. Nor
is mandamus proper to control or review the
exercise of discretion. (Oacudao v. Secretary of
Justice, 8 January 20i3, e.b., Bersamin, J.).

Q.

Is a special civil action for certiorari against the
Secretary of Finance and the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue proper in order to set aside
the BIR's Revenue Regulation No. 2-2012 which
imposed value-added taxes on the importation
of petroleum into the freeport and special
economic zones?
914

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

A.

No. Respondents do not fall within the ambit of a
tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial functions. They issued RR 2-2012 in
the exercise of their quasi-legislative or rule-making
powers, and not judicial or quasi-judicial functions.
Respondents did not adjudicate or determine the
rights of the parties. ( Clark Investors & Locators
Assoc. v. Secretary of Finance, 6 July 2015,
Villarama, J.)

Q.

The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) issued
the Rules for Setting the Electric Cooperatives'
Wheeling Rates (RSEC-WR) and Resolution No.
14 which set the electric cooperatives' wheeling
rates and allowed the electric cooperatives to
collect contributions from members for capital
contributions. The Petitioners, who are members
of electric cooperatives, filed a special civil
action for certiorari with the Supreme Court to
set aside Resolution No. 14. Was the resort to a
special civil action for certiorari proper?

A.

No. The ERC did not exercise judicial or quasijudicial functions in issuing and implementing the
RSEC-WR and Resolution No. 14. It was not called
upon to adjudicate the rights of contending parties or
to exercise, in any manner, discretion of a judicial or
quasi-judicial nature. Instead, RSEC-WR and
Resolution No. 14 were done in the exercise of the
ERC's quasi-legislative and administrative functions.
It was in the nature of subordinate legislation,
promulgated in the exercise of its delegated power.
Quasi-legislative power is exercised by administrative
agencies through the promulgation of rules and
regulations within the confines of the granting statute
and the doctrine of non-delegation of powers flowing
from the separation of the branches of the
915

government. Particularly, the ERC applied its rulemaking power as expressly granted by Republic Act
(R.A.) No. 9136 ("Electric Power Industry Reform Act
of 200"1'' or EPIRA). (Rosa/es v. Energy Regulatory
Commission, 5 April 2016, e.b., Peralta, J.).
Q.

Petitioner applied for the position of RTC Judge.
The JBC informed the petitioner that he was not
included in the list of candidates for the said
stations because of the JBC's long-standing
policy of opening the chance for promotion to
secondElevel courts to, among others, incumbent
judges who have served in their current position
for at least five years, and since the petitioner has
been a MTC judge only for more than a year, he
was excluded from the list. Petitioner filed a
petition for certiorari and prohibition with the SC
assailing the policy as unconstitutional and as
having been issued with grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack of or excess of jurisdiction.
May the SC take cognizance of the petition for
certiorari and prohibition?

A

Yes. As a rule, the special civil actions for certiorari
would lie oniy as against judicial and quasi-judicial
acts, with respect to certiorari, and judicial,
quasi-judicial, and ministerial acts, with respect to
prohibition.
With respect to the Supreme Court, however,
the remedies of certiorari and prohibition are
necessarily broader in scope and reach, and the
writ of certiorari or prohibition may be issued to
correct errors of Jurisdiction committed not only by a
tribunal, corporation, board or officer exercising
judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions but
also to set right, undo and restrain any act of grave

916

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction by any branch or instrumentality of the
Government, even if the latter does not exercise ti
judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions. This
application is expressly authorized by the text of the
second paragraph of Section 1, Article VIII of the
Constitution on the expanded judicial power of the
SC. (Villanueva v. Judicial and Bar Council, 7 April
2015, e.b., Reyes, J.; Council of Teachers and Staff
of Colleges and Universities of the Philippines v.
Secretary of Education, 9 October 2018, e.b.,
Caguioa, J.).
See also Arau/lo v. Aquino, 1 July 2014, e.b.,
Bersamin, J., where the SC, invoking its expanded
jurisdiction, said that prohibition and certiorari were
proper to challenge the Disbursement Acceleration
Program (OAP) and related issuances of the
Department of Budget and Management implementing
the OAP notwithstanding that the same do not involve
judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial acts; and Private
Hospitals Assoc. v. Medialdea, 6 Nov 2018, e.b.,
Tijam, J., where it was held that
certiorari &
prohibition proper to challenge the constitutionality of
RA 10932 (Anti-Hospital Deposit Law) even if what
was involved was legislative and not judicial, quasijudicial, or ministerial function.
Q.

May the question on whether the Secretary of
Justice committed grave abuse of discretion,,
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in
affirming, reversing, or modifying the resolutions
of prosecutors be the subject of a petition for
certiorari under R65?

A.

Yes, even when an administrative agency does not
perform a judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial

917
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

function, the Constitution mandates the exercise of
judicial review when there is an allegation of grave
abuse of discretion. (De Lima v. Reyes, 11 January
2016, Leonen, J.).
Q.

Distinguish a Petition for Review on Certiorari
from a Special Civil Action for Certiorari.

A.

AS TO GOVERNING RULE. A petition for review
on certiorari is governed by Rule 45, while a special
civil action for certiorari is governed by Rule 65.
ASTO NATURE OF PROCEEDING. A petition
for review on certiorari is a mode of appeal, while a
special civil action for certiorari is an original action.
AS TO JURISDICTION. A petition for review
on certiorari is under the exclusive appellate
jurisdiction of the. Supreme Court, while a special
civil action for certiorari is under the concurrent
original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, the Court
of Appeals, the Regional Trial Court, the
Sandiganbayan, and the COMELEC.
AS TO REQUIREMENT OF A MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION. A petition for review on
certiorari does not require the filing of a motion for
reconsideration with the lower court, while the filing of
a motion for reconsideration is a condition precedent
to the filing of a special civil action for certiorari.
AS TO REGLEMENTARY PERIOD. A petition
for review on certiorari should be filed within 15
days from notice of the judgment or final order
being appealed from, while a special civil action for
certiorari should be filed within 60 days from notice
of the judgment, order, or resolution.

918

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

AS TO FINDINGS OF FACTS. Findings of
facts of the Court of Appeals are binding upon the
Supreme Court in a petition for review on certiorari,
while in a special civil action for certiorari, the
findings of fact of the Court of Appeals are not
binding upon the Supreme Court.
AS TO IMPLEADING OF PARTIES. In appeal
by certiorari, the lower courts or judges whose
decisions are subject of review are not impleaded
either as petitioners or respondents, while in a
special civil action for certiorari, the lower court or
judge whose orders or proceedings are subject to
challenge are impleaded as public respondents.
Q.

Why is certiorari an extraordinary remedy?

A.

Because it is only available where there is no
appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy
in the ordinary course of law. (S1 R65).

Q.

What is the remedy of an aggrieved party from a
judgment declaring presumptive death under Article
41 of the Family Code?

A.

A special civil action for certiorari. Judgment
declaring presumptive death under Article 41 of the
Family Code is immediately final and executory and
cannot be appealed, the remedy of the aggrieved
party is a special civil action for certiorari under
R65. (Republic v. Cantor, 10 December 2013).

Q.

What are the exceptions to the rule that certiorari is
not a substitute to a lapsed remedy of appeal?

A.
1) When public policy and the advancement of the
public welfare so dictate.

3)

When the writs issued are null.

4)

When the questioned order amounts to an

5)

When appeal is not a plain, speedy, and
adequate remedy.

P files a collection case for PS00,000 against D.

D was declared in default on the ground that his
answer was filed beyond the reglementary
period. D filed a motion for reconsideration in
which he submitted proof that his answer was
filed on the 15th day from service of summons.
The trial court denied the motion on the ground
that it was not accompanied by an affidavit of
merits. Default judgment rendered against D
who received a copy of the judgment on March
1. D filed a motion for reconsideration which
was denied in an order received by D on April 1.
On May 3, D filed a special civil action for
certiorari with the CA to set aside the default
judgment. P argued that the petition should be
dismissed since the proper remedy was appeal.
Should the petition for certiorari be dismissed?
A.

No. The trial court acted with grave abuse of
discretion when it declared the defendant in default
despite the fact that there was proof that he had
timely filed his answer. Furthermore a motion for
reconsideration need not be accompanied by an
affidavit of merits. Appeal is not an adequate
remedy since D was not able to present any

920

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

evidence before the court a quo and the appeal
would hence be decided on the basis solely of the
plaintiff's evidence. (Balangcad v. Court of Appeals,
G.R. No. 83888, 12 February 1998).
Q.

P filed a collection case against D before the
RTC. P won the case and D filed a notice of
appeal. P then filed with the RTC a motion for
execution pending appeal on the ground that he
was posting a bond to indemnify D for any
damages that may be caused him by the execution
and on the ground that D's appeal was flimsy
and dilatory. After due notice and hearing, the
RTC granted the motion.
a) Was the grant of the motion for execution
pending appeal proper?
b) What would be the remedy of D against the
execution?

A.
a)

The mere posting of a bond is not a good
ground for the issuance of discretionary
execution. Otherwise, execution pending appeal
would issue as a matter of course. Likewise
the ground that the appeal is dilatory is not a
good ground. Otherewise the trial court would
be virtually pre-empting the appellate court's
decision on the appeal. ( Ong v. Court of
Appeals, 203 SCRA 38).

b) D may file a special civil action for certiorari to
set aside the order granting execution pending
appeal. The order was issued with grave abuse
of discretion amounting to lack of or excess of
jurisdiction. Appeal although available to D is
921

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

not an adequate remedy as the writ of
execution was already issued. (Presbiterio v.
Rodas, 73 Phil. 300).

Q.

C filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against
X Company before the Labor Arbiter. The Labor
Arbiter ruled in favor of C and ordered his
reinstatement and the payment of back wages.
X Company appealed to the National Labor
Relations Commission which set aside the
Labor Arbiter's decision and found that the
dismissal of C was valid. C's motion for
reconsideration was denied. What is the remedy
of C from the NLRC's adverse ruling?

A.

C's remedy is to file a special civil action for
certiorari with the Court of Appeals on the ground
that the decision of the NLRC was rendered with
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of or
excess of jurisdiction. The petition for certiorari
should be initially filed with the Court of Appeals in
strict observance of the doctrine on the hierarchy of
courts. ( St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC, 295
SCRA 494 [1998]).

Q.

JEWM Corporation bought two parcels of
registered land covered by TCT Nos. 325675
and 325676 on which notices of lis pendens,
including that of a case filed by the spouses
Crisologo against JEWM's predecessor-in-interest,
were annotated. JEWM filed with the Regional
Trial Court an action against the register of
deeds and II John and Jane Does" to cancel the
notices of lis pendens on the registered land
pursuant to Section 108 of the Property
Registration Decree. The spouses Crisologo
were not impleaded. The spouses Crisologo

922

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

filed a motion to be recognized as parties but
did not file a motion for intervention on their
belief that they were included among the John
and Jane Does. The RTC denied the motion and
a subsequent motion for reconsideration. The
spouses Crisologo thus filed a petition under
Rule 65 with the Court of Appeals to set aside
the RTC's order. The CA dismissed the petition
on the grounds that there were adequate reliefs
available to the spouses Crisologo, that is, a
motion for intervention and appeal; and that the
spouses Crisologos as non-parties in the RTC
case cannot avail of R65. Did the CA act
correctly in dismissing the petition for certiorari?
A.

No. The spouses Crisologo's liens were annotated
at the back of TCT Nos. 325675 and 325676. Thus,
as persons with their liens annotated, they stand to
be benefited or injured by any order relative to the
cancellation of annotations in the pertinent TCTs. In
other words, they are as indispensable as JEWM
itself in the final disposition of the case for
cancellation, being one of the many lien holders. As
indispensable parties, Spouses Crisologo should
have been joined as defendants in the case
pursuant to S7 R3.
Although intervention under Rule 19 could
have been availed of, the failure to use this remedy
should not prejudice Spouses Crisologo. It is the
duty of RTC-Br. 14, following the rule on joinder of
indispensable parties, to simply recognize them,
with or without any motion to intervene. Through a
cursory reading of the titles, the Court would have
noticed the adverse rights of Spouses Crisologo
over the cancellation of any annotations in the
subject TCTs.
923

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Neither will appeal prove adequate as a
remedy since only the original parties to an action
can appeal. Here, Spouses Crisologo were never
impleaded. Hence, they could not have utilized
appeal as they never possessed the required legal
standing in the first place. Moreover appeal is not
available as against an interlocutory order.
The same is also true if recourse to annulment
of judgment under Rule 47 is made since this
remedy presupposes a final judgment already
rendered by a trial court.
The fact that the spouses Crisologo were not
parties in the RTC should not preclude resort to
R65 because they were indispensable parties and
the lack of legal standing was not their fault. The
SC thus struck down the CA rulings and ordered
the remand of the case to the RTC for the Spouses
Crisologo and all other lien holders to be
impleaded. (Crisologo v. JEWM Agro-Ind. Corp., 3
March 2014).
Q.

Siguion Reyna Montecillo & Ongsiako Law
Offices (SRMO) acted as counsel for Remedios
N. Rodriguez (Remedios) when she commenced
an action for the intestate settlement of the
estate of her deceased husband Susana J.
Rodriguez before the Regional Trial Court.
During the pendency of the intestate proceedings,
Remedios asked for the payment of widow's
allowance. She was subsequently granted a
monthly widow's allowance of P3,000.00. While
the case was pending, Remedios executed a
Deed of Sale of Inheritance wherein she agreed
to sell all her rights, interests and participation
in the estate to Gerardo in consideration of

924

J9JC9B0M

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

P200,000.00. Remedios, executed a special
power of attorney authorizing Gerardo to receive
all moneys due to her from the inheritance
or estate.
Gerardo later on executed a document titled
as "Substitution of Attorney-in-Fact," where he
designated
SRMO as substitute
attorney
pursuant to the power of substitution granted to
him in the earlier SPA. Gerardo subsequently
executed his own SPA authorizing SRMO "[t]o
appear ... and represent [Gerardo] in any and all
proceedings
and incidents
in the estate
proceedings. " SRMO filed a motion with the
RTC for the payment of the allowance then
amounting to a total of P315,000.00. A few
months after, the Estate remitted to SRMO three
(3) checks totaling this amount.
Subsequently the RTC motu proprio directed
SRMO to reimburse the Estate the amount of
P315,000 representing the widow's allowance it
received. The court stated that Remedios was no
longer entitled to the allowance after selling her
hereditary share. SRMO moved to be excused
from reimbursing the Estate. According to SRMO,
when it sought the payment of the widow's
allowance, it was merely seeking the enforcement
of a judgment credit in favor of its client,
Remedios, who had, in turn, sold her interests to
Gerardo, also represented by SRMO. The RTC
denied SRMO's motion. Aggrieved by the RTC's
orders, SRMO elevated the case to the CA
through a petition for certiorari. SRMO argued
that it merely acted as representative of Gerardo,
Remedios' successor-in-interest, when it received_
the sum corresponding to the widow's allowance.
925

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Without going into the merits of the case,
however, the CA denied SRMO's petition on the
ground that the latter was not a party in the case
before the lower court and therefore had no
standing to question the assailed order. Was the
denial of the petition on such ground correct?
A.

No. The general rule is that a person not a party to
the proceedings in the trial court cannot maintain
an action for certiorari in the CA or the Supreme
Court to have the order or decision of the trial court
reviewed. The peculiar facts of this case, however,
call for a less stringent application of the rule. The
facts show that SRMO became involved in its own
capacity only when the RTC ordered it to return the
money that it received on behalf of its client. The
order of reimbursement was directed to SRMO in
its personal capacity-not in its capacity as counsel
for either Remedios or Gerardo. That SRMO is
being required to reimburse from its own coffers
money already transmitted to its client is sufficient
to give SRMO direct interest to challenge the
RTC's order. ( Siguion Reyna Montecillo Ongsiako
v. Chiong/a-Sia, 3 February 2016, Jardeleza, J.).

Q.

A complaint-affidavit was filed with the Office of
the Ombudsman against Mayor Jejomar Binay
Jr. charging him with plunder and violation of
the Anti-Graft Law in connection with the
construction of the Makati City hall parking
building. The 0MB issued an order placing
Binay under preventive suspension without pay
for not more than 6 months during the
pendency of the investigation. Binay filed a
petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals
seeking the nullification
of the preventive
suspension order and praying for the issuance
926

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

of a TRO and/or writ of preliminary injunction to
enjoin its implementation. The 0MB filed a
motion to dismiss the petition invoking Section
14 of R.A. No. 6770 or the Ombudsman Act
which reads as follows:
Section 14. Restrictions. - No writ of
injunction shall be issued by any court to delay an
investigation being conducted by the Ombudsman
under this Act, unless there is a prima facie
evidence that the subject matter of the
investigation is outside the jurisdiction of the
Office of the Ombudsman.

No court shall hear any appeal or
application for remedy against the decision or
findings of the Ombudsman, except the Supreme
Court, on pure question of law.
Should the motion to dismiss be granted?
A.

No. The first paragraph is irrelevant since it
evidently speaks of a writ of injunction issued as a
provisional remedy. This is shown by the phrase,
"to delay an investigation being conducted by the
Ombudsman." Hence the first paragraph does not
deal with subject-matter jurisdiction.
The second paragraph on the other hand is
unconstitutional and void. It limits the remedy
against "decision or findings" of the Ombudsman to
a Rule 45 appeal and thus attempts to effectively
increase the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction
without its advice and concurrence in violation of
Section 30, Art. VI of the Constitution.
Since the preventive suspension order is
interlocutory and thus unappealable, the remedy for
an aggrieved party is a R65 petition with the CA
927

REMEDIAL LAW

pursuant to the doctrine of hierarchy of courts.
(Carpio Morales v. Court of Appeals, 10 November
2015, e.b., Perlas-Bernabe, J.).
Q.

Is the filing of a motion for reconsideration of
the court's or quasi-judicial body's decision,
order, or ruling a requirement for the filing of a
special civil action for certiorari?

A.

Yes, the general rule is that the person filing a
special civil action for certiorari should first have
moved for the reconsideration of the court or quasijudicial body's decision. The reason is to afford the
court or body an opportunity at the first instance to
correct the imputed error. (B.A. Finance Corp. v.
Pineda, L-61628, 29 December 1982).

Q.

Is the foregoing rule subject to exceptions?

A.

Yes. In the following instances, a prior motion for
reconsideration is not necessary:
1)

When the challenged order is a patent nullity.
(Luzon Surety Co. v. Marbella, L-16088, 30
September 1960).

2)

When the case involves matters of extreme
urgency. (Matutina v. Bus/on, L-14637, 24
August 1960).

3)

When the issue raised is one purely of law.
(Amante v. Sison, 60 Phil. 949).

4)

Where public interest is involved. (National
Electrification Administration v. Court of Appeals,
126 SCRA 394 ).

5)

When the question raised in the certiorari
petition had been properly raised, argued and

928

Rule 65

submitted to the respondent court or body and
passed upon by it. (Fernandez v. Caluag, L16124, 30 December 1961).
Q.

A judgment was rendered by the RTC granting
the petition for declaration of presumptive death
of the spouse filed by the private respondent.
Without filing a motion for reconsideration, the
petitioner Republic filed a petition for certiorari
under R65 to set aside the RTC's decision.
Petitioner's main contention is that private
respondent failed to establish a "well-founded
belief' that his missing wife was already dead.
The CA dismissed the petition because no
motion for reconsideration was filed with the
court a quo. The CA ruled that such defect was
fatal and warranted the immediate dismissal of
the petition. Was the dismissal of the petition
on this ground proper?

A.

No. Parties cannot seek reconsideration, nor appeal
decisions in summary judicial proceedings under
the Family Code because by express mandate of
Article 247 of the Family Code, judgments rendered
thereunder are immediately final and executory.
While parties are precluded from filing a
motion for reconsideration or a notice of appeal, in
a petition for declaration of presumptive death, they
may challenge the decision of the court a quo
through a petition for certiorari to question grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

2010, what is the remedy of an aggrieved party
from an order approving or disapproving a

A.

The remedy of the aggrieved party is to file a

under R65 within 15 days from notice of the
decision or order. (S2 R6, 2013 Financial
Rehabilitation Rules of Procedure).

Q.

Where should a special civil action for certiorari
seeking to set aside an interlocutory order of
the RTC in a local tax case be filed? With the
Court of Appeals or the Court of Tax Appeals?

A.

The Court of Tax Appeals. The power of the CTA
includes that of determining whether or not there
has been grave abuse of discretion amounting to
lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the RTC
in issuing an interlocutory order in cases falling
within the .exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the tax
court. It, thus, follows that the CTA, by
constitutional mandate, is vested with jurisdiction to
issue writs of certiorari in these cases. Since
appellate jurisdiction over private respondents'
complaint for tax refund is vested in the CTA, it
follows that a petition for certiorari seeking
nullification of an interlocutory order issued in the
said case should, likewise, be filed with the same
court. To rule otherwise would lead to an absurd
situation where one court decides an appeal in the
main case while another court rules on an incident
in the very same case. (City of Manila v. GreciaCuerdo, 715 SCRA 182 [2014]).

Q.

What is the special civil action of prohibition?

A.

An extraordinary remedy by which an aggrieved
person prays for a judgment commanding a tribunal,
corporation, board, officer or person, whether
exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial
functions, to desist from further proceedings in an
action or matter on the ground that such proceedings
are without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or
with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or
excess of jurisdiction (S2 R65).

Q.

Give examples where prohibition may be availed of.

A.

Prohibition is proper to restrain a sheriff from
executing a judgment which was not yet executory
(Blossom & Co. v. Manila Gas Corporation, 47 Phil.
670) or from levying on properties of the judgment
obligor which are exempt from execution.

The Supreme Court in Enriquez v. Macadaeg,
84 Phil. 674, has held that the remedy where a
motion to dismiss is improperly denied is prohibition.
Here the motion to dismiss was improperly
denied. Under Rule 4, venue of personal actions is
the place where the plaintiff or the defendant
resides, at the plaintiff's election but here the case
was filed in Manila where neither the plaintiff nor
the defendant resides. Hence a petition for
prohibition would be proper.
(Note: It is submitted that certiorari may also
be availed of in order to set aside the order denying
the motion to dismiss).

mandamus with the Supreme Court to stop
respondents DILG Secretary and mayors from
evicting them pursuant to the Urban Development
Housing Act (RA No. 7279) and to compel the
respondents to afford them judicial process
prior to evictions and demolitions. Section 28
(a) and (b) of RA 7279 provides that evictions
and demolitions may be allowed without any
court order when: (1) persons or entities
occupy danger areas such as esteros, railroad
tracks, garbage dumps, riverbanks, shorelines,
waterways, and other public places such as
sidewalks, roads, parks, and playgrounds; and
(2) persons or entities occupy areas where
government infrastructure projects with available
funding are about to be implemented. Did the
Petitioners properly avail of prohibition?

932

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

A.

No. Prohibition is available against a respondent
exercising judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial
functions. In exercising the power to demolish and
evict illegal structures pursuant to RA 7279 the
respondents are clearly not exercising judicial or
quasi-judicial powers. Both judicial and quasijudicial functions involve the determination of what
the law is, and what the legal rights of the
contending parties are, with respect to the matter in
controversy and, on the basis thereof and the facts
obtaining, the adjudication of their respective rights.
Nor is there a ministerial duty on the part of
respondents. Section 28 of RA 7279 in authorizing
evictions and demolitions uses the word "may."
Clearly there is discretion on the part of respondents
to implement demolitions and evictions and thus there
is no ministerial duty. (Kalipunan ng Damayang
Mahihirap v. Robredo, 22 July 2014).

Q.

Why is prohibition an extraordinary remedy?

A.

Because it is only available where there is no
appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate remedy
in the ordinary course of law. (Id.).

Q.

Distinguish certiorari from prohibition.

A.

The purpose of certiorari is to annul proceedings
had without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction or
with grave abuse of discretion; hence certiorari is a
corrective remedy and operates on acts already
consummated. On the other hand, prohibition is a
preventive remedy whose function is to restrain the
doing of some act about to be done. It is not intended
to provide a remedy for acts already accomplished.
(Agustin v. De la Fuente, 84 Phil. 515).

REMEDIAL LAW

Certiorari is directed only against judicial or
quasi-judicial acts while prohibition may be directed
against judicial, quasi-judicial, or ministerial acts.
(Tuason v. Register of Deeds, 157 SCRA 613).
Q.

Distinguish injunction from prohibition.

A.

Injunction is generally directed against a person
not exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial
functions, while prohibition is directed against a
tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person
exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial
functions.
Injunction may be the main action itself, or just
a provisional remedy in the main action, whereas
prohibition is always a main action.
Where an action for prohibition is filed, the
petitioner may seek the provisional remedy of
preliminary injunction against the respondent.

Q.

Distinguish prohibition from mandamus.

A

The object of mandamus is to compel a tribunal,
corporation, board, officer or person to comply with
a ministerial duty while prohibition has for its object
that of preventing the tribunal, corporation, board,
officer or person from executing an act not within or
in excess of its jurisdiction. Mandamus is an
affirmative remedy for it commands that something
be done; prohibition is purely negative for it
commands that something be left undone.

SEC. 3. Mandamus
Q.

Define mandamus.

A.

A special civil action wherein the petitioner prays
that judgment be rendered commanding a tribunal,
corporation, board, officer or person to perform an
act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty
resulting from an office, trust, or station, the
performance of which the respondent has been
unlawfully neglecting. (S3 R65).
It is also available against a person who
unlawfully excludes another from the use and
enjoyment of a right or office to which such other
person is entitled. (Id.).
Like certiorari and prohibition, mandamus is
only available when there is no other plain, speedy
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

Q.

Mandamus is also available against a person
who unlawfully excludes another from the use
and enjoyment of a right or office to which such
other person is entitled. Distinguish this type of
mandamus from quo warranto.

A.

Where the respondent merely excludes the
petitioner from an office without usurping, intruding
into, or unlawfully holding the office, the proper
remedy is mandamus. If the respondent however
claims any right to the office and usurps, intrudes
into, or unlawfully holds it against the petitioner, the
appropriate remedy would be quo warranto.
(Burguete v. Mayor, 94 Phil. 930).

Q.

Give examples where mandamus would be proper.

A.

Mandamus is available to compel a judge to allow
an appeal, where the same was timely and duly
filed and the proper fees failed. It has been held
that a mandamus suit is proper to compel GSIS to
continue paying a member's monthly pension.
(GSIS v. de Leon, 17 November 2010). Mandamus
is proper to compel the Department of Budget and
Management to pay retirement gratuity differentials
of retired Court of Appeals justices. (Assoc. of
Retired CA Justices v. Abad, 10 July 2018,
Velasco, J.).

Q.

May a transferee of shares of stock initiate an
action for mandamus to compel the corporation
to record the transfer of shares in its stock-andtransfer book, as well as to issue new stock
certificates in his name?

A.

Yes. It is settled jurisprudence that the registration
of a transfer of share of stock, and the consequent
issuance of a new stock certificate to the
transferee, is a ministerial duty on the part of the
corporation. (Andaya v. Rural Bank of Cabadbaran,
Inc., 3 August 2016, Sereno, C.J.). Note that
mandamus does not lie solely against public
officers, but even against private persons who have
a ministerial duty.

Q.

May mandamus issue to compel the performance
of a discretionary duty?

A.

As a rule no. Only ministerial duties may be
compelled by mandamus, and not discretionary
ones. (Tavera-Luna Inc. v. Nable, 67 Phil. 340).
Where such discretion however can be legally
exercised in only one way and it refuses to act in

936

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

such manner, mandamus will lie to compel the
court to exercise its discretion in accordance with
law. (1 FLORENZ D. REGALADO, REMEDIAL
th
LAW COMPENDIUM 464 [5 rev. ed. 1988]).
Q.

Does mandamus lie to compel the payment of_
an informer's reward?

A.

No. The grant of an informer's reward for the
discovery, conviction, and punishment of tax
offenses is a discretionary quasi-judicial matter that
cannot be the subject of a writ of mandamus. It is
not a legally mandated ministerial duty. This reward
cannot be given to a person who only makes
sweeping averments about undisclosed wealth,
rather than specific tax offenses, and who fails to
show that the information which he or she supplied
was the undiscovered pivotal cause for the
revelation of a tax offense, the conviction and/or
punishment of the persons liable, and an actual
recovery made by the State. (Lihaylihay v. Tan, 23
July 2018, Leanen, J.).

Q.

An order of a Regional Trial Court setting the
case for pre-trial was duly sent to and received by
the plaintiff and defendant and their respective
lawyers. On the date of the pre-trial, plaintiff and
his counsel did not appear and defendant moved
to have plaintiff's complaint dismissed. The Court
denied the motion and re-set the pre-trial. Can
defendant successfully sue for mandamus before
a higher tribunal? (80 Bar Q4 ed)

No, the defendant cannot successfully

that the trial court has the discretion but not the
duty to declare a party non-suited. Under Rule 65
of the Rules of Court, mandamus only lies to
compel the performance of ministerial acts but not
those involving discretion.

Q.

A files a Complaint against B for recovery of
title and possession of land situated in Makati
with the RTC of Pasig. B files a Motion to
Dismiss for improper venue. The RTC Pasig
Judge denies B's Motion to Dismiss, which
obviously was incorrect. Alleging that the RTC
Judge "unlawfully neglected the performance of
an act which the law specifically enjoins as a
duty resulting from an office," B files a Petition
for Mandamus against the judge. Will Mandamus
lie? Reasons. (12 Bar Essay Q10b)

A.

No, mandamus will not lie. The Supreme Court has
held that mandamus may not be directed against
discretionary acts. Prohibition, not mandamus, is
the proper remedy when a motion to dismiss
is improper~ denied. (Enriquez v. Macadaeg, 84
14
Phil. 674 ).

Q.

May mandamus lie to challenge a trial judge's
order of voluntary inhibition?

A.

Yes. While, ordinarily, mandamus will not prosper
to compel a discretionary act, the writ shall issue in
instances of gross abuse of discretion, manifest
injustice or palpable excess of authority, equivalent
to denial of a settled right to which petitioner is
entitled; and when there is no other plain, speedy

140
11is submitted that mandamus will lie, since the discretion can be
legally exercised in only one way, that is, to dismiss the case on the ground of
improper venue.

938

J9JC9B0M

Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

and adequate remedy. A judge's decision to refuse
to act on account of some disqualification is not
conclusive,
and his competency
may
be
determined on an application for mandamus to
compel him to act. Where the motion for inhibition
merely imputed bias or prejudice without any
ground to support it, the judge's order of inhibition
was not grounded on a just and valid cause.
(Pagoda Phils. Inc. v. Philippine Canning Inc., G.R.
No. 160966, 11 October 2005).

Q.

Alleging that his father passed away in 1992
and left a holographic will, which is now in the
custody of his mother, Nixon filed with the RTC
a petition for mandamus with damages to
compel his mother to produce the will so that
probate proceedings for the allowance of the
will could be instituted. Was the filing of the
petition for mandamus proper?

A.

No. This is because there is a plain, speedy, and
adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, that
is, the filing of a petition for probate under S1 R76
and then moving for the production of the will under
S2-5 R75. Under S1 R76, an interested person
may petition the court having jurisdiction to have
the will allowed, whether the same be in his
possession or not, or is lost or destroyed. ( Uy v.
Lee, 15 January 2010). It also appears that Nixon
had a photocopy of the will. This would have been
sufficient to prove the holographic will.

Q.

May mandamus lie to compel the performance
of contractual duties?

A.

No. Contractual duties are not specifically enjoined
by law but by the agreement between the parties.

939
J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

The proper remedy then of the aggrieved party is to
file an ordinary civil action for specific performance.
( Quioge v. Del Rosario, 46 Phil. 337).
Q.

May a mayor be compelled by mandamus to
issue a business permit?

A.

No. A mayor cannot be compelled by mandamus
to issue a business permit since the exercise of the
same is a delegated police power and hence
discretionary in nature. (Lacap v. Sandiganbayan,
21 June 2017; Roble Arrastre v. Villaflor, 22 August
2006; Rimando v. Naguilian Emission Testing
Center, G.R. No. 198860, 23 July 2012).

Q.

Once the decision of a court in an application
for original registration of land ordering the
LRA to issue the decree of registration has
become final, will mandamus lie to compel the
LRA to issue the decree of registration?

A.

Yes. However mandamus does not lie to compel
LRA to issue the decree of registration where it
appears that there is an existing title over the same
land. (Rodriguez v. CA, 13 June 2013). The reason
is that it would violate the principle that a certificate
of title is not subject to a collateral attack pursuant
to the Property Registration Decree.

Q.

In a petition for mandamus, may the petitioner
recover damages from the respondent?

A.

Yes. Aside from praying for a judgment compelling
the respondent to perform the ministerial duty, the
petitioner may also pray that the court order the
respondent "to pay damages sustained by the
petitioner by reason of the wrongful acts of the
respondent." (S3 R65). Note that this provision
940

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

allowing the recovery of damages is not found in
certiorari and prohibition.
Sec. 4. When petition filed
Q.

When may a petition for certiorari, prohibition,
or mandamus be filed?

A.

The petition may be filed not later than 60 days
from notice of the judgment, order or resolution. In
case a motion for reconsideration or new trial is
timely filed, whether such motion is required or not,
the 60-day period shall be counted from notice of
the denial of said motion. (S4 R65).
The 60-day period would not apply in case
there is no judgment, order or resolution to be
assailed, as for instance in a mandamus petition
where what is being assailed is the continuing
refusal to perform a ministerial duty.
Take note however that a petition for certiorari
seeking to restrain or set aside actions taken by the
Monetary Board of the BSP in respect of
conservatorship, receivership, and liquidation
proceedings should be filed within 10 days from
receipt by the board of directors of the institution of
the order directing conservatorship, receivership, or
liquidation. (Sec. 30, New Central Bank Act).
Also a petition for mandamus based on
unlawful exclusion from public office must be filed
within one year from such exclusion. (Galano v.
Roxas, 67 SCRA 8, 16 [19751).

Q.

May a motion for extension of time to file the
petition under R65 be filed?
941

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

Yes. While the provision in S4 R65, which states
that "[n]o extension of time to file the petition shall
be granted except for the most compelling reason
and in no case exceeding 15 days," was deleted by
A.M. No. 07-12-SC (effective 27 December 2007),
this does not mean that the filing of a motion for
extension was absolutely prohibited. If such were
the intention, the deleted portion could just have
been simply reworded to state that "no extension of
time to file the petition shall be granted." Absent
such a prohibition, motions for extension of time to
file a petition under Rule 65 are allowed, subject
to the Court's sound discretion (Domdom v.
Sandiganbayan, G.R. Nos. 182382-83, 24 February
2010, en bane) but only under exceptional and
meritorious cases. (Mid-Islands Power Generation
Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 189191,
29 February 2012; Republic v. St. Vincent de Paul
Colleges, G.R. 192908, 22 August 2012). In Midis/ands the petition for certiorari filed with the Court
of Appeals involved the operations of the Calapan
Diesel Power Plant and an imminent brown-out in
the entire province of Oriental Mindoro, while in St.
Vincent de Paul Colleges, the Supreme Court took
into account the fact that the CA had earlier granted
the motion for extension of time and the public
interest involved, i.e., the expropriation of private
property for public use.
Note: Views were expressed that courts other
than the Supreme Court cannot grant an extension
as they are bound by the amendment of S4 R65
by A.M. No. 07-12-SC invoking Laguna Metts
Corporation v. Caalam, G.R. No. 185220, 27 July
2009. In Laguna Metts the Supreme Court held that
the Court of Appeals cannot grant an extension of
942

J9JC9B0M

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

time to file a petition under R65 since the Court of
Appeals would in effect be disregarding or
modifying A.M. No. 07-12-SC. Said views said that
the ruling in Domdom was justified by the Supreme
Court's equity jurisdiction, i.e., the power to
suspend the operation of the Rules of Court or to
exempt a particular case from its coverage, a power
which can be exercised only by the Supreme Court.
It should be noted however that in Mid-Islands
the Supreme Court gave its imprimatur to the Court
of Appeals' grant of an extension, stating that the
matter was an exceptional and meritorious case.
The practical effect of the rulings in Oomdon, Midis/ands, and St. Vincent de Paul Colleges is the
reinstatement of the provision in S4 R65 that "[n]o
extension of time to file the petition shall be granted
except for the most compelling reason and in no
case exceeding 15 days." Hence not only the
Supreme Court but other courts as well may grant
the extension, provided the matter involved is an
exceptional and meritorious case.
Q.

Where should the petition for under R65 be filed?

A.

If the petition relates to the act or omission of a
MTC or of a corporation, a board, an officer or a
person, it shall be filed with the RTC exercising
jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by
the SC. It may also be filed with the CA or with the
Sandiganbayan, whether or not in the same is in
aid of the court's appellate jurisdiction.
If the petition involves an act or an omission of
a quasi-judicial agency, unless otherwise provided
by law or these rules, the petition shall be filed with

The NWRB granted the motion and allowed

certiorari under R65 with the RTC which
dismissed the petition stating that it should have

A.

Yes. S4 R65 provides that if the petition involves an
act or omission of a quasi-judicial agency, like the
NWRB, the petition under R65 shall be filed with
and cognizable only by the Court of Appeals. The
fact that the NWRB is not mentioned in S1 R43
does not mean that it it not a quasi-judicial agency
since the list is S1 R43 is not meant to be exclusive
as shown by the use of the word "among."

The Department of Health issued a cease-anddesist order (CDO) against the GCC Approved
Medical Centers Association (GAMCA) enjoining
it from implementing the deck-referral system in
which OFW applicants to the Gulf countries
should have their medical examination only in
Gulf Cooperative Countries (GCC) approved
clinics. GAMCA filed with the RTC of Pasay City
a petition for certiorari under R65 seeking to
enjoin the DOH from implementing the CDO.
a)

Was the DOH acting in a quasi-judicial
capacity when it issued the CDO?

b) Was the petition properly filed with the
RTC?
A.
a)

;"

Yes. The DOH COO letter directed GAMCA to
cease and desist from engaging in the referral
decking system practice within three days from
receipt of the letter. By issuing this COO letter
implementing Section 16 of RA No. 10022, the
DOH (1) made the finding of fact that GAMCA
implements the referral decking system, and (2)
applied Section 16 of RA No. 10022, to
conclude that GAMCA's practice is prohibited
by law and should be stopped.

From this perspective, the DOH acted in a
quasi-judicial capacity: its COO letter determined a
question of fact, and applied the legislative policy
prohibiting the referral decking system practice.
Notably, CDOs have been described and
treated as quasi-judicial acts in past cases, and had

945
J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON

even been described as similar to the remedy of
injunction granted by the courts.
b)

No. Acts or omissions by quasi-judicial
agencies, regardless of whether the remedy
involves a R43 appeal or a R65 petition for
certiorari, is cognizable by the Court of Appeals.
The provision in S4 R65 requiring that certiorari
petitions challenging quasi-judicial acts to be
filed with the CA is in full accord with Section
9(1) and (3) of Batas Pambansa Big. 129. Thus,
by law and by Supreme Court Rules, the CA is
the court with the exclusive original jurisdiction
to entertain petitions for certiorari and prohibition
against quasi-judicial agencies. (Association of
Medical Clinics v. GCC Medical Centers, 6
December 2016, e.b., Brion, J.).

Q.

Private respondent filed an election protest
case against the Petitioner before the RTC. The
RTC issued an order finding the service of
summons against the Petitioner valid and
declaring the Petitioner's answer as filed out of
time and thus authorizing the reception of
evidence ex parte. Petitioner filed a petition for
certiorari with the Supreme Court. Private
Respondent contends that the petition for
certiorari should have been filed with the
COMELEC pursuant to S4 R65. The Petitioner
on the other hand contends that a certiorari
proceeding to set aside an interlocutory order is
not in aid of appellate jurisdiction. Was the R65
petition properly filed with the SC?

A.

No. If a case may be appealed to a particular court
or judicial tribunal or body, then said court or
judicial tribunal or body has jurisdiction to issue the
946

J9JC9B0M

Rule 65
Certiorari, Prohibition And Mandamus

extraordinary writ of certiorari, in aid of its
appellate jurisdiction. Since it is the COMELEC
which has jurisdiction to take cognizance of an
appeal from the decision of the regional trial court
in election contests involving elective municipal
officials, then it is also the COMELEC which has
jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari in aid of its
appellate jurisdiction. (Galang v. Geronimo, 22
February 2011, e.b., Peralta, J.).
SEC. 5. Respondents and costs in certain cases
Q.

Who should be joined as respondents in a R65
petition?

A.

When the petition filed relates to the acts or
omissions of a judge, court, quasi-judicial agency,
tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person, the
petitioner shall join, as private respondent or
respondents with such public respondent or
respondents, the person or persons interested in
sustaining the proceedings.

Q.

In a R65 petition for certiorari filed with the RTC,
wherein the accused Petitioner questions the
denial by the MTC of his application for probation,
the Petitioner failed to implead the offended party
as the private respondent. Hence the RTC
dismissed the petition for failure to comply with
S5 R65. Was the dismissal proper?

A.

In a petition for certiorari under R65, the failure to
implead the private complainant pursuant to S5
R65 will not warrant the dismissal of the petition.
S11 R3 states that neither misjoinder nor nonjoinder of parties is a ground for the dismissal of an
action. Thus, the trial court should have ordered
947

petitioner to add private complainant as a
respondent to the case. ( Cuyo v. People, 12
141
October 2011, Sereno, J.).

Q.

Whose duty is it to appear in behalf of the
respondents?

A.

It shall be the duty of the private respondent to
appear and defend, both in his own behalf and in
behalf of the public respondent. Unless otherwise
specifically directed by the court where the petition
is pending, the public respondents shall not appear
in or file an answer or comment to the petition or
any pleading therein. If the case is elevated to a
higher court by either party, the public respondents
shall be included therein as nominal parties.
However unless otherwise specifically directed by
the court, they shall not appear or participate in the
proceedings. (S5 R65).

Q.

Will the filing of the petition under R65 interrupt
the course of the principal case?

A.

No, unless a temporary restraining order or a writ of
preliminary injunction has been issued against
the public respondent from further proceeding in
the case.
The public respondent shall proceed with the
principal case within ten days from the filing of a
142
petition for certiorari
with a higher court or

141
See also Abdu/raman v, Office of the Ombudsman, 19 August 2013,
wherein the SC held that the CA should not have dismissed the petition for
certiorari for failure to implead the private respondent
142
The use of the phrase "petition for certiorari" instead of "petition" in the
second paragraph of 87 R65 appears to be a drafting oversight There appears
to be no good reason why the rule requiring the public respondent to proceed
within ten days from the filing of the petition for certiorari should not apply also to
a petition for prohibition and mandamus,

tribunal, absent a TRO or writ of preliminary
injunction, or upon its expiration. Failure of the
public respondent to proceed with the principal
case may be a ground for an administrative charge.
(S7 R65).
However where a person has been adjudged
in direct contempt and he avails himself of the
remedies of certiorari or prohibition, the execution
of the judgment shall be suspended pending
resolution of the petition, provided such person files
a bond. (S2 R71 ).
Q.

P filed a petition for mandamus with the RTC
against the Register of Deeds and the Land
Registration Authority in order to compel the
latter to issue to him a transfer certificate of

matter by way of consu/ta. The RTC denied the
motion to dismiss as well as the succeeding
motion for reconsideration by the respondents.
The respondents then filed a special civil action
for certiorari with the Court of Appeals with a
prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining
order and writ of preliminary injunction. After 20
days from the filing of the petiton for certiorari,
the CA required P to file a comment but did not

RULE 66. QUO WARRANTO
Q.

What is quo warranto?

A.

In Latin, quo warranto means "by what right or
authority."
It is a special civil action brought in the name
of the Republic against the usurpation of public
office, position or franchise, and commenced by the
filing of a verified petition.
It may also be brought by an individual in his
own name, who claims to be entitled to a public
office or position usurped or unlawfully held or
exercised by another.

Q.

Which courts have jurisdiction over petitions
for quo warranto?

A.

The Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, and the
Regional Trial Courts have original and concurrent
jurisdiction. The Sandiganbayan has original
jurisdiction in quo warranto arising in cases filed
under Executive Order Nos. 1, 2, 14, 14-A, in aid of
its appellate jurisdiction. (Sec. 4, P.O. No. 1606).

Q.

What is the venue in a quo warranto proceeding?

A.

If brought before the RTC, it should be filed with the

Q.

Mandamus is also available against a person
who unlawfully excludes another from the use
and enjoyment of a right or office to which such
other person is entitled. Distinguish this type of
mandamus from quo warranto.

A.

Where the respondent merely excludes the
petitioner from an office without usurping, intruding
into, or unlawfully holding the office, the proper
remedy is mandamus. If the respondent however
claims any right to the office and usurps, intrudes
into, or unlawfully holds it against the petitioner, the
proper remedy would be quo warranto. (Burguete v.
Mayor, 94 Phil. 930).

Q.

Petitioner Fabian was appointed Election Registrar
of Municipality of Sevilla supposedly to replace
the respondent Election Registrar Pablo who was
transferred to another municipality without his
consent and who refused to accept his aforesaid
transfer, much less to vacate his position in Bogo
143
town
as election registrar, as in fact he
continued to occupy his aforesaid position and
exercise his functions thereto. Petitioner Fabian
then filed a petition for mandamus against Pablo
but the trial court dismissed Fabian's petition
contending that quo warranto is the proper
remedy. Is the court correct in its ruling? Why?
(01 Bar Q3).

A.

Yes the court is correct in its ruling.
Where the respondent merely excludes the
petitioner from an office without usurping, intruding
into, or unlawfully holding the office, the proper
remedy is mandamus. If the respondent however

it appears that this should be written as "Sevilla."

952

Rule 66
Quo Warranto

claims any right to the office and usurps, intrudes
into, or unlawfully holds it against the petitioner, the
proper remedy would be quo warranto. (Burguete v.
Mayor, 94 Phil. 930).
Here Pablo refused to vacate his position and
continued to hold it against Fabian. Hence quo
warranto not mandamus is the proper remedy.
Q.

Against whom may a quo warranto case be
brought?

A.

Against:
1) A person who usurps, intrudes into, or
unlawfully holds or exercises a public office,
position or franchise.
2) A public officer who does or suffers an act
which, by the provision of law, constitutes a
ground for the forfeiture of his office; or
3) An association which acts as a corporation
within the Philippines without being legally
incorporated or without lawful authority so to
act. (S1 R65).
Note however that a quo warranto proceeding
in the third case is within the original and exclusive
jurisdiction of the regional trial court pursuant to
Sec. 5.2 of the Securities Regulation Code, in
relation to Section 5(b) of P.O. No. 902-A which
speaks of a controversy "between [a] corporation ...
and the state insofar as it concerns [the corporation's]
franchise or right to exist." (See also A.M. No. 0303-03-SC effective 1 July 2003).

Q.

A group of businessmen formed an association
in Cebu City calling itself Cars Co. to distribute/
sell cars in said city. It did not incorporate itself
under the law nor did it have any government
permit or license to conduct its business as
such, The Solicitor General filed before a
Regional Trial Court in Manila a verified petition
for quo warranto questioning and seeking to
stop the operations of Cars Co. The latter filed a
motion to dismiss the petition on the ground of
improper venue claiming that its main office
and operations are in Cebu City and not in
Manila. Is the contention of Cars Co. correct?
Why? (01 Bar Q11).

A.

No. Under S7 R66, when the Solicitor General
commences the action for quo warranto, it may be
brought in the Regional Trial Court of Manila.
(Note: With the passage of A.M. No. 03-0303-SC [effective 1 July 2003], original and exclusive
jurisdiction over the action for quo warranto under

Q.

A.

Quo warranto may be:
1)

Compulsory or discretionary.

2)

Brought in the name of the Republic (S1 R66)

Q.

When is quo warranto compulsory?

A.

The Solicitor General or a public prosecutor, when
directed by the President of the Philippines, or
when upon complaint or otherwise he has good
reason to believe that any case specified in S1
R66 can be established by proof, must commence
the action.

Q.

When is quo warranto discretionary?

A.

The Solicitor General or a public prosecutor may, with
the permission of the court in which the action is to be
commenced, bring such an action at the request and
upon the relation of another person; but in such case
the officer bringing it may first require an indemnity for
the expenses and costs of the action in an amount
approved by and to be deposited in the court by
the person at whose request and upon whose relation
the same is brought.

Q.

Who may commence a quo warranto action?

A.

1) The Solicitor General.
2)

A public prosecutor.

3)

A person claiming to be entitled to a public
office or position usurped or unlawfully held or
exercised by another may bring an action
therefor in his own name. (S5 R66).

Q.

Distinguish a quo warranto action commenced
by a private individual from a quo warranto
action commenced by the Solicitor General or
public prosecutor.

A.

In the action commenced by the private individual,
it is necessary for the petitioner to prove his right to

the office in dispute. If he fails to prove this, it is
unnecessary for the court to pass upon the right of
the respondent to the office.
In an action commenced by the Solicitor
General or a public prosecutor, it is not necessary
that there be a person claiming to be entitled to
the office alleged to have been usurped. The duty
of the court is to pass upon the right of the
respondent only.
Q.

R.A. 10660 created six new vacancies in the
Sandiganbayan. The JBC submitted six groups
or "clusters" corresponding to each vacancy to
President Aquino for his consideration. Petitioners
are members of one of the clusters. However
not one from their cluster was appointed by
President Aquino. They filed a petition for quo
warranto challenging the appointment of the SB
justices by Aquino. They alleged that the
President violated the Constitution when he
disregarded the JBC's clustering by not appointing
any one of their cluster to the Sandiganbayan.Will
the action for quo warranto prosper?

A.

No. It is axiomatic that in a petition for quo warranto
filed by an individual claiming entitlement to office,
such individual must show that he has a clear right
to the office allegedly held by another. Petitioner
judges who merely have an expectant not a clear
right to Sandiganbayan positions are not proper
parties to file petition for quo warranto under S5
R66. Petitioners' rights depended on an expectancy:
that they would be the ones appointed by the
President. (Aguinaldo v. Aquino, 29 Nov 2016, e.b.,

Quo Warranto

Q.

In the quo warranto case filed by the Republic
against Maria Lourdes Sereno, seeking her
ouster from the position of Chief Justice of the
Philippines, certain private individuals filed
motions for leave to intervene as citizens and
as taxpayers. They claim that as citizens and as
taxpayers, they have a legal interest in the
matter of Sereno's ouster or removal. May these
individuals be allowed to intervene?

A.

No. The movants do not possess the required legal
interest to intervene in a quo warranto suit since
they neither claim to be entitled to the questioned
position nor are they the ones charged with the
usurpation thereof. (Republic v. Sereno, 11 May
2018, e.b., Tijam, J.).

Q.

In an action for usurpation, can the court award
damages sustained as a result of the usurpation
to the person adjudged entitled to the office?

A.

No. Such damages must be sought in an action to be
filed within one year after the entry of the judgment
establishing the petitioner's right to the office in
question. (See S9 R66 in relation to S11 R66).

Q.

In an action for usurpation, what judgment shall
the court render if usurpation is found?

A.

The court shall render judgment that such
respondent be ousted and altogether excluded
therefrom, and that the petitioner or relator, as the
case may be, recover his costs. Such further
judgment may be rendered determining the
respective rights in and to the public office, position
or franchise of all the parties to the action as justice

the cause of such ouster, or the right of the
petitioner to hold such office or position arose.
(S11 R66)

Q.

In the quo warranto case filed by the Republic
against Maria Lourdes Sereno, seeking her
ouster from the position of Chief Justice of the
Philippines, the respondent moved to dismiss
the petition on the ground of prescription,
invoking S11 R66 which provides that "[n]othing
contained in this Rule shall be construed to
authorize an action against a public officer or
employee for his ouster from office unless the ---- same be commenced within one year after the
cause of such ouster, or the right of the
petitioner to hold such office or position,
arose." May the petition for quo warranto be
dismissed on the ground of prescription?

A.

No. The one-year limitation is not applicable when
the quo warranto action is filed by the State at its
own instance through the Solicitor General. Here
the petitioner is not a mere private individual
pursuing a private interest, but the government
itself seeking relief for a public wrong and suing for
public interest. ~Republic v. Sereno, 11 May 2018,
1 4
e.b., Tijam, J.).

144
However, the one-year prescriptive period shall apply to a quo warranto

What is the prescriptive period for bringing an

A.

Within one year after the entry of the judgment

Q.

If the principal of a public high school is
illegally replaced by another, is it a requirement
that before he can go to court on quo warranto,
he should first exhaust administrative remedies?
(80 Bar Q10)

A.

No, it is not a requirement that he should first
exhaust administrative remedies.
The Supreme Court has held that in quo
warranto proceedings, no one is compelled to
exhaust administrative remedies since public
interest requires that the right to public office should
be determined as expeditiously as possible.
Furthermore, the action for quo warranto must be
brought within one year from the date of ouster.
( Galano v. Roxas, 67 SCRA 8, [1975]).

Q.

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

was later discovered that the respondent had
falsified his bachelor's degree and thus had
become ineligible for the position of regional
director. May the judgment still be executed?
A.

No. The general rule is that the execution of a
court's judgment becomes a matter of right upon
the expiration of the period to appeal and no appeal
was duly perfected. Generally, therefore, courts
may no longer review or modify a final and
executory judgment. This is otherwise referred to as
the principle of immutability of judgments, which
dictates that once a decision becomes final, the
enforcement or execution of the judgment becomes
a purely ministerial act. An exception to the rule is
whenever circumstances transpire after the finality
of the judgments rendering execution unjust
and inequitable.
Here there was a supervening circumstance,
that is, the discovery that the respondent had
falsified his bachelor's degree and thus had
become ineligible for the contested position. To still
order the execution of the judgment would be
clearly unjust and inequitable. (Arroyo v. CA, 10

RULE 67. EXPROPRIATION
Q.

Define eminent domain and expropriation.

A.

Eminent domain is the right of the state or the
sovereign to take private property for public use
upon payment of just compensation. Expropriation
is the special civil action by which the state or the
sovereign exercises its right of eminent domain. In
other words, eminent domain is the right while
expropriation is the judicial proceeding for enforcing
said right.

Q.

What entities may

A.

1)

The State.

2)

Local governments. (Sec. 19, Local Government
Code). There must' be an ordinance passed by

whose subject matter is incapable of pecuniary
estimation. The subject of an expropriation case is
the determination of the government's right to take
private property for public use. (Brgy. San Roque v.

Q.

What are the stages of an expropriation suit?

A.

The first stage is the determination of the plaintiff's
authority to expropriate, including the inquiry into the
propriety of the expropriation, its necessity, and the
public purpose of the expropriation. The court will
issue an order of expropriation declaring that the
plaintiff has the right to expropriate, for the public
use or purpose described in the complaint, and upon
the payment of just compensation. (S4 R67).
The second stage is the ascertainment by the
court of just compensation, taking into account the
report of the commissioners. The court shall render
judgment in accordance with the action it has taken
upon the report.

Q.

How is the right of eminent domain exercised?

A.

The right of eminent domain shall be exercised by
the filing of a verified complaint which shall:
1)

State with certainty the right and purpose of
expropriation;

2)

Describe the real or personal property sought
to be expropriated; and

3)

Join as defendants all persons owning or
claiming to own, or occupying, any part thereof
or interest therein, showing, so far as practicable,
the separate interest of each defendant. (S1 R67).

Q.

If the title to the property is in the name of the
Republic, may an action for expropriation lie?

A.

Yes. If the title to any property sought to be
expropriated appears to be in the Republic of the
Philippines, although occupied by private individuals,
962

J9JC9B0M

Rule 67
Expropriation

or if the title is otherwise obscure or doubtful so that
the plaintiff cannot with accuracy or certainty
specify who are the real owners, averment to that
effect shall be made in the complaint. (S2 R67).
Q.

When shall the plaintiff have the right to enter
or to take possession of the property subject
of the expropriation?

A.

In case of real property

Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time
thereafter and after due notice to the defendant, the
plaintiff shall have the right to take or enter upon
the possession of the real property involved if he
deposits with the authorized government depositary
an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the
property. Such deposit shall be held by such bank
subject to the orders of the court and shall be in
money, unless in lieu thereof the court authorizes
the deposit of a certificate of time deposit of a
government bank of the Republic payable on
demand to the authorized government depositary.
(S2 R67).
In case of expropriation of right-of-way site or location
for national government infrastructure projects

Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time
thereafter, and after due notice to the defendant,
the implementing agency shall immediately deposit
to the court in favor of the owner the amount
equivalent to the sum of:

property and improvement for the area. In provinces, cities, municipalities, and
other areas where there is no zonal valuation, or where the current zonal
valuation has been in force for more than 3 years, the BIR is mandated, within
the period of 60 days from the date of filing of the expropriation case, to conduct
a zonal valuation of the area, based on the land classification done by the city or
municipal assessor. (Sec. 6[c], R.A. No. 10752).

In case of expropriation by a local government unit

The local government unit may immediately
take possession of the property upon the filing of
the expropriation proceedings and upon making a
deposit with the proper court of at least 15% of the
fair market value of the property based on the
current tax declaration of the property to be
expropriated.
In case of personal property

If personal property is involved, its value shall
be provisionally ascertained and the amount to be
deposited shall be promptly fixed by the court.
After the deposit is made the court shall order
the sheriff or other proper officer to forthwith place
the plaintiff in possession of the real or personal
property involved and promptly submit a report
thereof to the court with service of copies to the
parties. (S2 R67). The court shall issue a writ of
possession for this purpose.
Otherwise, the plaintiff shall have a right to/$
enter upon the property only upon payment to the
defendant of the compensation fixed by the
judgment, with legal interest thereon from the
taking of the possession of the property, or after
tender to the defendant of the amount so fixed and
payment of the costs. (S10 R67).
Q.

Is a prior hearing required before the plaintiff
may enter into or take possession of the
property involved?

previously appeared or answered, he may present
evidence as to the amount of the compensation to
be paid for his property, and he may share in the
distribution of the award. (S3 R67).
Q.

Can the defendant in an expropriation suit file a
motion to dismiss?

A.

No. While under the 1964 Rules the defendant in
an expropriation case may file a motion to dismiss,
under the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure the
defendant may no longer file a motion to dismiss.
Any objections or defenses the defendant may
have to the taking of his property must be set forth

is a bank certificate showing that there is, on
deposit with the Land Bank of the Philippines, an
amount equivalent to the assessed value of the

a)

Jovito's motion to dismiss will not prosper.

The Supreme Court has held that the defendant
in an expropriation case cannot file a motion to
dismiss but should raise his objections in the answer.
(Masikip v. City of Pasig, 23 January 2006).
b)

As judge, I will not grant the writ of possession

In case
of expropriation
for national
government infrastructure projects, the law requires
that the government, in order that it will have the
right to enter or take possession, should immediately
pay the owner of the property 100% of the market
value of the property. Here what was done was
only to make a deposit of an amount equivalent to
the assessed value. (R.A. No. 8974, Republic v.

Q.

When shall the order of expropriation issue?

A.

use or purpose described in the complaint and
upon the payment of just compensation. (S4 R67).
Q.

Is a hearing required before the order
expropriation may issue?

A.

It depends. If the defendant has no objection or
defense to the action or the taking of his property or
if no party appears to defend, the court may issue
the order of expropriation without a hearing.
Otherwise a hearing shall be conducted.

Q.

May the order of expropriation be appealed?

A.

Yes. A final order sustaining the right to expropriate
the property may be appealed by any party
aggrieved thereby. Such appeal, however, shall not
prevent the court from determining the just
compensation to be paid. (S4 R67).

Q.

What is the time and manner for appealing an
order of expropriation?

A.

The party taking the appeal shall file a notice of
appeal and a record on appeal within 30 days from
notice of the order of expropriation. (Municipality of
Binan v. Garcia, 180 SCRA 576). This is because
the appeal from the order of expropriation is a
separate appeal. (S2[a] R41).

Q.

What is just compensation?

A.

Just compensation is the market value of the
property plus consequential damages to the property
not taken less the consequential benefits to be
derived by the owner from the public use or purpose
of the property taken. The consequential benefits
assessed shall in no case exceed the consequential
damages assessed. This is to avoid the property

owner being deprived of the actual value of his
property. The following equation is illustrative:
FMV + (CD-CB) = JC
Where:
FMV is the fair market value
(CD-CB) is consequential damages to the
property not taken less the consequential benefits
to be derived by the owner from the public use or
purpose of the property taken, the operation of its
franchise by the corporation, or the carrying of
the business of the corporation or person taking
the property.
Q.

What is meant by consequential benefits?

A.

Consequential benefits refers to the actual benefits
derived by the owner on the remaining portion of
his or her land which are the direct and proximate
results of the improvements consequent to the
expropriation and not the general benefits which he
receives in common with the community. (1
FLORENZ
D. REGALADO, REMEDIAL LAW
COMPENDIUM 746 [J1hrev. ed.]).

Q.

At what point in time is the just compensation
to be determined?

A.

The just compensation is determined as of the date
of the taking of the property or the filing of the
complaint, whichever comes first. (S4 R67).

Q.

The City of Cebu filed the complaint for
expropriation of the Respondent's property on
17 September 1993 but the property was
actually taken by the city only on 21 September
970

Rule 67
Expropriation

1994. At what point in time should the just
compensation be determined?

A.

As of the taking of the property on 21 September
1994. While S4 R67 provides that just compensation
shall be determined at the time of the filing of the
complaint if the filing precedes the taking, such
provision cannot prevail over Section 19 of the
Local Government Code, a substantive law, which
states that just compensation should be based on
the fair market value of the property at the time of
the taking of the property. (City of Cebu v. Dedamo,
7 May 2002, Davide, C.J.) Hence in expropriation
by a local government, it is Section 19 of the LGC
not S4 R67 which governs.

Q.

What is inverse condemnation?

A.

Inverse condemnation refers to the action for
recovery of just compensation filed by the property
owner in the situation wherein the State, local
government unit or public utility seizes or takes
private property for public use without filing
beforehand a complaint for expropriation. It is
called inverse because it is the property owner
rather than the State which initiated the
proceedings for the payment of just compensation.

August 2011, Bersamin, J.).

appointment of commissioners. Was it proper
for the trial court to do so?
A.

Yes. S5 R67 on the appointment of commissioners
does not apply to inverse condemnation proceedings.
R67 presupposes that the plaintiff exercised its right
of eminent domain by filing a complaint for
expropriation. When a government agency itself
violates procedural requirements, it waives the usual
procedure found in R67. (National Power Corp. v.
Asoque, 14 September 2016, Leanen, J.; Republic v.
Court of Appeals, G.R. 106804, 12 August 2004). - - Nothing of course prevents the court from appointing
commissioners to determine the just compensation.
(Rebadulla v. Republic, 31 January 2018, Tijam, J.).

Q.

A complaint for recovery of possession with
damages or payment of just compensation
dated 9 January 2001 was filed by petitioner
Felisa Agricultural Corporation (petitioner)against
the National Power Corporation (NPC) before
the RTC. Petitioner claimed that in 1997, it
discovered that the NPC's transmission towers
and transmission lines were located within a
19,635-squaremeter portion of its lands situated in
Brgy. Felisa, Bacolod City. Further verification
revealed that the transmission towers were
constructed sometime before 1985 by NPC
which entered the subject land without petitioner's
knowledge and consent.
In the course of the proceedings, the
parties agreed to narrow down the issue to the
payment of just compensation and agreed to
settle the case at the price of P400.00/sq. m. but
the proposed compromise did not push through
in view of the failure of the OSG to act on the

972

Rule 67
Expropriation

Deed of Sale entered into by the parties.
Subsequently, petitioner moved that NPC be
immediately ordered to pay the amount of
P7,845,000 representing the 100% zonal value of
the subject land in accordance with R.A. No.
8974. NPC opposed the motion, contending that
the said law only applies to expropriation cases
initiated by the government to acquire property
for any national government infrastructure
project. Is the opposition meritorious?
147

A.

No. The provisions of RA 8974,
including that on
the payment of 100% zonal valuation, are
applicable to inverse condemnation proceedings.
To hold otherwise would be to allow the
government to benefit from its own non-observance
of the proper procedure of fiing an expropriation
proceeding before taking over private property.
(Felisa Agricultural Corp. v. National Transmission
Corp., 2 July 2018, Perlas-Bernable, J.).

Q.

In 1940, the DPWH took Respondents' subject
property without the benefit of expropriation
proceedings for the construction of the
MacArthur Highway. In a letter dated December
15, 1994, Respondents demanded the payment
of the fair market value of the subject parcel of
land. Celestino R. Contreras, then District Engineerof the First Bulacan Engineering District of the
DPWH, offered to pay for the subject land at the
rate of PO.70 per square meter, per Resolution
of the Provincial Appraisal Committee of
Bulacan. Unsatisfied with the offer, Respondents
demanded the return of their property, or the
payment of compensation at the current fair

market value. Hence, the complaint for recovery
of possessionwith damages filed by Respondents.
Respondents were able to obtain favorable
decisions in the RTC and the CA, with the
subject property valued at P1 ,500.00 per square
meter, with interest at 6% per annum.
Both the RTC and the CA valued the
property at P1,500.00 per square meter, plus 6%
interest from the time of the filing of the
complaint until full payment. What is the
reckoning date for determining just compensation,
the time of the taking in 1940 (P0.70 per sq. m.)
or the time of the filing of the complaint for
recovery of possession?

A.

The time of the taking in 1940, pursuant to S4 R67
which states that the just compensation shall be
determined as of the date of the taking of the property
or the filing of the complaint, whichever came first. In
inverse condemnation, the just compensation should
still be reckoned as of the time of the taking, even if
apparently unjust. The landowner will however be
compensated by the award of interest, exemplary
damages, and attorney's fees. ( Sec. of OPWH v.
Tecson, 21 April 2015 [e.b.])

Q.

What is fair market value?

A.

Fair market value or market value is the price at
which the property would bring in a market of willing
buyers and willing sellers in the ordinary course of
trade and neither operating under pressures or
constraints. (STEVEN GIFIS, LAW DICTIONARY
125 [1975]).

Rule 67
Expropriation

Q.

What is the procedure for ascertaining just
compensation?

A.

Upon the rendition of the order of expropriation, the
court shall appoint not more than 3 competent and
disinterested persons as commissioners to ascertain
and report to the court the just compensation for
the property sought to be taken. The order of
appointment shall designate the time and place of
the first session of the hearing to be held by the
commissioners and specify the time within which their
report shall be submitted to the court. (S5 R67).

Q.

Upon the rendition of the order of expropriation,
is the appointment of commissioners mandatory
upon the court?

A.

Yes. This is shown by the use of the word "shall"
in S5 R67.

Q.

Should the court consult the parties prior to the
appointment of commissioners?

A.

No. Neither Rule 67 of the Rules of Court nor
R.A. No. 8974 requires the RTC to consult the
parties in the expropriation case prior to the
appointment of commissioners. (Republic v. Mupas,
148
8 September 2015).

Q.

Describe in brief the proceedings before the
commissioners.

A.
1) The commissioners have the power to receive
evidence and are authorized to administer
oaths on hearings before them.

2)

The commIssIoners, after due notice to the
parties to attend, may view and examine the
subject property and its surroundings, and may
measure the same.

3)

The commissioners shall assess the consequential
damages to the property not taken and deduct
therefrom the consequential benefits to be
derived by the owner from the public use or
purpose of the property taken. But in no case
shall the consequential benefits assessed
exceed the consequential damages assessed.
(S6 R67).

4)

The commissioners shall make a full and
accurate report to the court of all their
proceedings, and such proceedings shall not
be effectual until the court shall have accepted
their report and rendered judgment
in
accordance with their recommendations.

5)

Upon the filing of the commissioners' report,
the clerk of court shall serve copies on all
interested parties, with notice that they are
allowed 10 days within which to file objections
to the findings of the report. (S7 R67).

Q

What are the actions that the court may take
upon the commissioners' report?

A.

The court may, after hearing:
1)

Accept the report and render judgment
accordance therewith;

2)

Recommit the report to the commissioners for
further report of facts;

The court may make such order or render such
judgment as shall secure to the plaintiff the property
essential to the exercise of his right of expropriation,
and to the defendant just compensation for the
property so taken. (S8 R67).
Q.

Is the plaintiff's right to enter the property
suspended by an appeal from the judgment?

A.

No. The plaintiff's right to enter upon the property
of the defendant and appropriate the same for
public use or purpose shall not be delayed by an
appeal from the judgment. But if the appellate court
determines that the plaintiff has no right of
expropriation, judgment shall be rendered ordering
the RTC to forthwith enforce the restoration to the
defendant of the possession of the property, and to
determine the damages which the defendant
sustained and may recover by reason of the
possession taken by the plaintiff. (S 11 R67).

Q.

Who pays the costs in an expropriationproceeding?

A.

All costs, including the commissioners' fees, shall
be paid by the plaintiff. However if the property
owner takes an appeal and the judgment is
affirmed, the costs of the appeal shall be paid by
the owner. (S12 R67).

Q.

The National Power Corporation (NPC) filed a
complaint for expropriation against (a) Petrona
Dilao and her co-owners over 7,281 square
meters of land, and (b) Estefania Enriquez over
7,872 square meters of land. The trial court

977

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

rendered a judgment adopting the commissioners'
report and fixing the just compensation of the land
of Dilao and her co-owners at P516.66 per square
meter. NPC filed a notice of appeal from the
judgment but this was disallowed by the trial court
on the ground that NPC should have filed both a
notice of appeal and a record on appeal. Was the
disallowance of NPC's appeal proper?
A.

Yes. A record on appeal is required in cases of
multiple or separate appeals. (S2[a] R41 ). Here the
judgment of just compensation still left something to
be done by the trial court since it still has to
determine the just compensation with respect to
Enriquez. Hence this was a case involving a
separate appeal. A record on appeal is required
since the trial court still had to hold on to the
records of the case. (National Power Corporation v.
Paderanga, 28 July 2005, Carpio Morales, J.).

Q.

The National Power Corporation (NAPOCOR)
filed a complaint for expropriation against the
Petitioners for the construction of a transmission
line project. The NAPOCOR sought to expropriate
7,875 square meters of the Petitioners' property.
Petitioners filed their answer with counterclaim
wherein they said that the expropriation should
cover not only 7,875 square meters but the
entire property since the construction of the
transmission line would render the entire
property valueless and unfit for whatever
purpose. In it$ December 2001 Decision the trial
court fixed the fair market value of the 7,875
square-meter~portion at P115 per square meter.
The trial court also directed its commissioners
to submit a report on the fair market value of
the "dangling'; or remaining area of 58,484

978

Rule 67
Expropriation

square meters affected by the installation of
NAPOCOR's transmission lines. In its March
2002 Supplemental Decision, the trial court
declared the "dangling area" consisted of
48,848.87 square meters and fixed its fair market
value at P65 per square meter. The trial court ruled
that Petitioners are entitled to consequential
damages because the expropriation impaired the
value of the "dangling area" and deprived
Petitioners of the ordinary use of their property.
NAPOCOR filed a notice of appeal from the
Supplemental Decision. Petitioners argue that the
Supplemental Decision has become final and
executory since NAPOCOR did not file a record on
appeal. ls a record on appeal required?
A.

No. A record on appeal is required in multiple and
separate appeals. Jurisprudence recognizes the
existence of multiple appeals in expropriation Jit
proceedings because there are two stages in every
action for expropriation. The reason for multiple
appeals in the same case is to enable the rest of
the case to proceed in the event that a separate
and distinct issue is resolved by the trial court and
held to be final. In such a case, a record on appeal
is indispensable since only a particular incident
of the case is brought to the appellate court for
resolution with the rest of the proceedings
remaining within the jurisdiction of the trial court. In
this case since the trial court fully and finally
resolved all conceivable issues in the complaint for
expropriation, there was no need for NAPOCOR to
file a record on appeal because the original records
could already be sent to the appellate court.

G.R. 161219, 6 October 2008).

Q.

In an expropriation proceeding the court
rendered judgment awarding just compensation
to the defendant landowner. The government
appealed. May the landowner move for execution
pending appeal?

A.

No. Execution pending appeal not applicable to
expropriation proceedings. The reason is that
public funds cannot be seized under a writ of
execution. (National Power Corp. v. Rabie, 17 Aug
2016, Carpio, J.).

Q.

In expropriation cases, interest should be
awarded to the landowner. From when is such
interest computed?

A.

Interest should be computed from the date of the
taking of the property. Here legal interest shall run
not from the date of the filing of the complaint but
from the date of the issuance of the writ of
possession on 5 May 2008, since it is from this date
that the fact of the deprivation of property can be
established. As such, it is only proper that accrual
of legal interest should begin from this date.
Accordingly, the Court deems it proper to correct
the award of legal interest to be imposed on the
unpaid balance of the just compensation for the
subject lot, which shall be computed at the rate of
12% p.a. from the date of the taking on 5 May 2008
until 30 June 2013. Thereafter, or beginning 1 July
2013, until fully paid, the just compensation due
respondent shall earn legal interest at the rate of
6% p.a. pursuant to BSP Circular No. 799, Series of
2013. (Republic v. Macabagdal, 10 January 2018,

RULE 68. FORECLOSURE OF REAL
ESTATE MORTGAGE
Q.

What is a real estate mortgage?

A.

A real estate mortgage is an accessory contract
constituted by the owner of a real property whereby
he allows a lien to be constituted thereon for the
purpose of securing in favor of the creditor the
fulfillment of a principal obligation.

Q.

Define foreclosure of real estate mortgage.

A.

The proceeding whereby the property subject of the
real estate mortgage is sold at public auction for the
payment of the principal obligation in favor of the
mortgagee. (Article 2087, Civil Code). It is called
foreclosure because the purpose of the action is to
foreclose or divest the rights in the property of the
mortgagor and junior lienholders and to vest their
rights in the purchaser. (S3 R68).

Q.

May foreclosure of real estate mortgage be
done extrajudicially?

A.

Yes. It is required however that there be a special
power of attorney inserted in or annexed to the deed
of mortgage empowering the mortgagee to sell the
land at public auction. (Sec. 1, Act No. 3135).

Q.

The real estate mortgage provides that in the
event of nonpayment of the loan, the mortgagors
expressly agree to the extrajudicial foreclosure
of the mortgaged property. Would this be
sufficient to authorize extrajudicial foreclosure in
the event of the mortgagors's default?

981

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

No. The mortgagors evidently agreed only to the
holding of the extrajudicial foreclosure should they
default in their obligations. Their agreement was a
mere expression of their amenability to extrajudicial
foreclosure as the means of foreclosing the
mortgage, and did not constitute the special power
or authority to sell the mortgaged property to
enable the mortgagees to recover the unpaid
obligations. What was necessary under Act No.
3135 was the special power or authority to sell whether inserted in the mortgage itself, or annexed
thereto - that authorized the mortgagees to sell in
the public auction the mortgaged property. Hence
the extrajudicial foreclosure was void. (Baysa v.
Plantilla, 13 July 2015).

Q.

De Castro is the registered owner of Unit 802 of
of the condominium, covered by Condominium
Certificate of Title (CCT) No. 2826. For failure to
pay assessment dues amounting to P79,905.41
as of 31 July1986 despite demand, Wei bit
Construction Corp., Wack Wack Condominium
Corp., and Spouses Eugenio Juan Gonzalez and
Matilde Gonzalez (petitioners) caused the
annotation of a lien for unpaid assessments and
other dues at the back of De Castro's title on 14
August 1986 pursuant to Section 4 of the
registered Master Deed with Declaration of
Restrictions of Wack Wack Condominium (Master
Deed). As the said dues remained unsettled,
petitioners filed a petition for the extra-judicial
foreclosure of the condominium unit with the
Office of the Ex-Officio Sheriff of Pasig City on
27 October 1986. The requirements of publication
and posting of the notice were then complied
with and the public auction was set on 10

982

Rule 68
Foreclosure Of Real Estate Mortgage

February 1987. Petitioners emerged as the
highest bidder in the auction sale and a
certificate of sale was issued in their favor.
De Castro subsequently filed a petition for
annulment of foreclosure proceedings with the
RTC. In the said petition, De Castro argued that
the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings were
null and void since petitioners have no special
power of attorney or authority to sell the
mortgaged property pursuant to Act No. 3135. Is
De Castro's argument correct?
A.

No. Section 20 of the Condominium Act provides
that unpaid assessments in accordance with a duly
registered declaration of restrictions shall be and
become a lien upon the condominium to be
registered with the Register of Deeds of the city or
province where such condominium project is
located and that such liens may be enforced in the
same manner provided for by law for the judicial or
extra-judicial foreclosure of mortgage or real
property. In other words the authority to sell the
mortgaged property was vested in petitioners
pursuant to Section 20 of the Condominium Act and
the duly registered declaration of restrictions.
Hence the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings
including the auction sale were valid. (We/bit Const.
Corp. v. De Castro, 23 July 2018, Tijam, J.).149

149
Compare with First Marbella Condominium Association, Inc. v.
Gatmaytan, 579 Phil. 432 (2008), where the court nullified the extrajudicial
foreclosure proceedings since the only basis of therein petitioners for causing the
extra judicial foreclosure of therein respondent's condominium unit was a mere
notice of assessment annotated on the latter's CCT.

Q.

In February 2014, petitioner filed an action for
foreclosure of real estate mortgage against the
respondents spouses before the RTC of Kalibo,
Aklan. The complaint alleged that the respondents
borrowed P250,000 in 2008 from the petitioner
and executed in his favor a REM over the
subject land, which has an assessed value of
P13,380. The RTC dismissed the action on the
ground of lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.
On appeal, the petitioner argues that the RTC
had jurisdiction since foreclosure is an action
which is incapable of pecuniary estimation. Was
the dismissal proper?

A.

Yes. Foreclosure of real estate mortgage is a real
action, since it involves title to real property. Hence
it is the assessed value of the property which
determines the court's jurisdiction. Considering that
the assessed value of the mortgaged property is
only P13,380.00, the RTC correctly found that the
action falls within the jurisdiction of the first level
court- per Section 33(3) of BP 129 as amended.
(Roldan v. Barrios, 23 April 2018, Peralta, J.).

Q.

Is an action for foreclosure of a real estate
mortgage an action incapable of pecuniary
estimation?

A.

No. It is a real action which affects the title to or
possession of the mortgaged realty. The trial court's
order confirming the foreclosure sale would divest
the mortgagor or junior lienholder of his rights over
the realty and vest the same in the purchaser.
Hence jurisdiction is not exclusively with the
regional trial court but with the municipal trial court
or regional trial court depending upon the assessed
value of the realty mortgaged.

984

J9JC9B0M

Rule 68
Foreclosure Of Real Estate Mortgage

Q.

What is the venue of a foreclosure suit?

A.

In the proper court which has jurisdiction over the
area wherein the real property involved, or a portion
thereof, is situated. This is because a foreclosure
suit is a real action.

Q.

What shall be set forth in the complaint for
foreclosure?

A.

The complaint shall set forth:
1) The date and due execution of the mortgage;
2)

Its assignments, if any;

3) The names and residences of the mortgagor
and the mortgagee;
4)

A description of the mortgaged property;

5) A statement of the date of the note or other
documentary evidence of the obligation
secured by the mortgage;
6)

The amount claimed to be unpaid thereon; and

7)

The names and residences of all persons
having or claiming an interest in the property
subordinate in right to the holder of the
mortgage, all of whom shall be made defendants
in the action. (S1 R68). Such persons are
termed as junior encumbrancers.

Q.

Should the debtor, who is not the mortgagor, be
included in the action?

A.

It was stated in a case that such debtor should be
included. (Soriano v. Enriquez, 24 Phil. 584). It is
opined that the debtor should not be impleaded.
Firstly he is not mentioned in S 1 R68 as among

985

J9JC9B0M

those who should be made parties. Secondly the
mortgagee has no cause of action against the debtor
since he is not a party to the mortgage contract.
Q.

X mortgaged his real property to C to secure a
loan obtained by X from C. The mortgage was
registered. Subsequently X also mortgaged the ____ .
same property to D for another loan and
mortgage was also registered. X failed to pay
both loans. C filed a foreclosure complaint
against X. C did not implead D. After due trial,
the court rendered judgment in favor of C and
confirmed the auction sale of the property. D
filed an action to annul the judgment on the
ground that he was an indispensable party who
was not impleaded. Will D's action prosper?

the

A.

No. In an action to foreclose a real estate
mortgage, the junior encumbrancer is merely a
necessary party. The mortgage may be foreclosed
without impleading him and without prejudicing his
rights as there will still remain with him the
unforeclosed right of redemption.

Q.

In the preceding question, what are the rights or
remedies available to D, the second mortgagee?

A.

D still has the unforeclosed right of redemption
which he may exercise within one year from the
date of the registration of the foreclosure sale, as
he is a redemptioner under S27(b) R39 which has
suppletory effect to R68 pursuant to S3(a) R1. (1
FLORENZ D. REGALADO, REMEDIAL LAW
COMPENDIUM 750-51 [ih rev. ed., 3 rdprinting]).
Since D's real estate mortgage was not
foreclosed, D may still foreclose upon the mortgage
in his favor once the principal obligation secured

986

Rule 68
Foreclosure Of Real Estate Mortgage

thereby becomes due and demandable. D should
however pay off the first mortgagee C or the
purchaser at the first foreclosure suit.
Q.

What would be the effect if D had been impleaded?

A.

The inclusion of D would serve to foreclose or
extinguish his right of redemption. If there is any
residue after satisfaction of C's claim, then D would
be entitled to the residue.

Q.

How is a foreclosure suit conducted?

A.

A foreclosure suit is conducted like an ordinary civil
action. Upon the filing of the complaint, summons is
issued and served upon the defendant, who answers
within the reglementary period. After the filing of the
answer, trial is held and thereafter judgment is
rendered. (S3[a] R1; JAIME R. NUEVAS, REMEDIAL
LAW REVIEWER 302-303 [1964]).

Q.

Outline in brief the procedure in a foreclosure case.

A.

The procedure in a foreclosure case may be briefly
outlined as follows:
1)

FILING OF THE COMPLAINT. The mortgagee
or his assignee files the foreclosure complaint,
which shall set forth the matters stated
in S1 R68.

2)

JUDGMENT OF FORECLOSURE. If upon trial
the court shall find the facts set forth in the
complaint to be true, it shall determine the
amount due to the plaintiff upon the mortgage
debt, including interests and other charges as
approved by the court, and costs, and shall
render judgment for the sum so found due.

987

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

3)

EQUITY OF REDEMPTION (90-120 DAY
PERIOD). The court shall order that the sum
found due be paid to the court or to the
judgment obligee within a period of not less
than 90 days nor more than 120 days from the
entry of judgment, and that in default of such
payment the property shall be sold at public
auction to satisfy the judgment. (S2 R68).

4)

FORECLOSURE SALE. If the defendant fails to
pay within the period specified in the judgment of
foreclosure, the plaintiff shall file a motion for the
foreclosure sale of the property. The sale shall
be conducted by way of a public auction in the
manner and under the provisions of R39
governing execution sale of real property.

5)

ORDER OF CONFIRMATION. After the
foreclosure sale has been conducted, the
purchaser shall file a motion for the confirmation of
the sale. The order of confirmation of the sale shall
operate to divest the rights in the property of all the
parties to the action and to vest their rights in the
purchaser, subject to such rights of redemption
as may be allowed by the law. (S3 R68).

6)

WRIT OF POSSESSION. Upon the finality of
the order of confirmation or upon the expiration
of the redemption period when allowed by law,
the purchaser or last redemptioner can file with
the court which ordered the foreclosure sale a
motion for the issuance of a writ of possession
over the property. The purchaser or last
redemptioner shall be entitled to possession of
the property unless a third party is actually
holding the same adversely to the judgment
obligor. (S3 R68).

988

J9JC9B0M

J9JC9B0M

Rule 68
Foreclosure Of Real Estate Mortgage

7)

DEFICIENCY JUDGMENT. If the proceeds of
the foreclosure sale are not sufficient to pay the
judgment award, the plaintiff may file a motion
for the court to render a deficiency judgment
against the defendant, upon which execution
may issue immediately. (S6 R68).

Q.

Is the judgment of foreclosure appealable? If
so, within what time and in what manner should
the appeal be taken?

A.

Yes the judgment on foreclosure is appealable
since it is a judgment which disposes of the merits
of the case. Justice Regalado writes that since
foreclosure involves multiple or separate appeals,
the appeal shall be taken by filing a notice of
appeal and a record on appeal within 30 days from
notice of the judgment. (FLORENZ D. REGALADO,
REMEDIAL LAW COMPENDIUM 509, 752 [7th rev.
ed., 3rd printing]).

Q.

How may the defendant prevent the auction sale?

A.

By paying the amount of the mortgage debt stated
in the judgment on foreclosure within the period
provided by the court for the exercise of the equity
of redemption (90-120 days). In default of such
payment, the property shall be sold at public
auction to satisfy the judgment. (S2 R68).

Q.

From when is the 90-120 day period computed?

A.

From the entry of the judgment on foreclosure. If
no appeal is made, the judgment on foreclosure
becomes final and executory and will be entered in
the book of entries of judgment. The date of finality
of the judgment shall be deemed to be the date of
its entry. (S2 R36).
989

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

What is the equity of redemption?

A.

The right of the defendant to defeat the foreclosure
sale and recover or gain the property by paying the
judgment award within the period stated in the
judgment of foreclosure which shall be not less
than 90 days nor more than 120 days from the
entry of judgment.
(Note: Under S2 R68 of the 1964 Rules of
Court, the defendant had “a period of not less than
ninety days from date of service of [the judgment of
foreclosure]” to pay the mortgage debt. Supreme
Court decisions had ruled that the mortgagor or
junior encumbrancer may recover or gain the
property by paying the mortgage debt prior to the
finality of the order of confirmation. (Anderson v.
Reyes, 54 Phil. 944; Castillo v. Samonte, 106 Phil.
1023; GSIS v. CFI, 175 SCRA 19). It is submitted
that the foregoing rulings are no longer good case
law since S2 R68 of the 1997 Rules of Civil
Procedure clearly provides that the judgment award
should be paid within the period stated in the
judgment of foreclosure which should not be more
than 120 days from the entry of the judgment).

Q.

If the defendant fails to pay within the period
stated in the judgment of foreclosure, what
should the plaintiff do?

A

The plaintiff should file a motion for the foreclosure
sale of the property.

Q.

Is notice and hearing required for the motion for
foreclosure sale?

A.

While notice is required, the motion will no longer be
set for hearing and shall be resolved by the court
990

J9JC9B0M

Rule 68
Foreclosure Of Real Estate Mortgage

within 5 days from receipt thereof. S3 R68 provides
that the court “upon motion, shall order the property
to be sold in the manner and under the provisions of
Rule 39,” and under S4(iv) R15, a motion for the
issuance of a writ of execution is a non-litigious
motion which shall not be set for hearing.
Q.

Should notice of the foreclosure sale be given
to the defendant?

A.

Yes pursuant to S15(d) R39 in relation to S3 R68
which provides that the property mortgaged should be
sold in the manner and under the provisions of Rule
39 and other regulations governing sale of real estate
under execution. (JOSE Y. FERIA & MARIA
CONCEPCION NOCHE, PROVISIONAL REMEDIES:
A REVIEWER-PRIMER 252 [2007 ed.]).

Q.

Is there a right of redemption in extrajudicial
foreclosure? If so what is the period of redemption?

A.

Yes there is a right of redemption in extrajudicial
foreclosure. The period of redemption is one year
from the registration of the foreclosure sale. (Act
3135; Reyes v. Tolentino, G.R. L-29142, 29
November 1971). However in case of extrajudicial
foreclosure by a bank and the mortgagor is a
juridical person, the period of redemption is until the
registration of the foreclosure sale or 3 months after
the foreclosure sale, whichever is earlier. (Section
47, General Banking Law).

Q.

Is there a right of redemption
foreclosure?

A.

As a rule there is no right of redemption in judicial
foreclosure. After the finality of the order confirming

991

in judicial

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

the foreclosure sale, the mortgagor has no more
right over the property.
Q.

What is the exception to the rule that there is no
right of redemption in judicial foreclosure?

A.

Under Section 47 of the General Banking Law, in
case of foreclosure by a bank, whether judicial or
extrajudicial, the mortgagor has one year from the
registration of the foreclosure sale within which to
redeem the property.
Also a junior mortgagee or junior lienholder
who was not impleaded in the foreclosure suit has
a right of redemption within one year from the
registration of the foreclosure sale. (S27(b) R39 in
relation to S3(a) R1).

Q.

After the foreclosure sale, what should the
purchaser do?

A.

The purchaser should move for the confirmation of
the sale.

Q.

Is notice and hearing required for a motion for
confirmation of sale?

A.

Yes. Notice to the defendants should be given and
a hearing should be conducted. This is to afford the
defendants a chance to contest the confirmation on
the ground, for instance, of nullity of or irregularities
in the sale or of gross inadequacy. ( Tiglao v.
Botones, 90 Phil. 275). It is submitted however that
the defendants should no longer be given the
chance to pay the mortgage debt after the lapse of
the period stated in the judgment on foreclosure.

992

J9JC9B0M

Rule 68
Foreclosure Of Real Estate Mortgage

Q.

What is the order of confirmation?

A.

The order by which the court confirms the
foreclosure sale and thereby divests the rights in
the property of all the parties to the action and to
vest their rights in the purchaser, subject to such
rights of redemption as may be allowed by law.

Q.

May the order of confirmation be appealed? If
so, when and how should the appeal be made?

A.

Yes the order of confirmation is a final order which
may be appealed. (Dimalanta v. Ocampo, 20 SCRA
1136; De la Cruz v. Sta. Maria, L-17928, 30 April
1963). Since foreclosure involves multiple or
separate appeals, the appeal shall be taken by ^
filing a notice of appeal and a record on appeal
within 30 days from notice of the order. (FLORENZ
D. REGALADO, REMEDIAL LAW COMPENDIUM
509, 752 [7th rev. ed., 3rd printing]).

Q.

Upon the finality of the order of confirmation
or (where redemption is allowed by law) upon
the expiration of the redemption period, may the
purchaser forthwith take possession of the
property?

A.

No. The purchaser should file a motion for the
issuance of a writ of possession. Upon the finality
of the order of confirmation or upon the expiration
of the redemption period when allowed by law, the
purchaser or last redemptioner can file with the
court which ordered the foreclosure sale a motion
for the issuance of a writ of possession over the
property. The purchaser or last redemptioner shall
be entitled to possession of the property unless a
third party is actually holding the same adversely to
the judgment obligor. (S3 R68).
993

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

May the motion be filed ex parte?

A.

In extrajudicial foreclosure, the purchaser may file
an ex parte motion for the issuance of a writ of
possession. (Section 7, Act No. 3135).
In judicial foreclosure, the motion for the
issuance of a writ of possession is a non-litigious
motion which shall not be set for hearing and shall
be resolved by the court within five days from
receipt thereof. (S4 R15, 2020 Rules). Nevertheless
the motion must be served upon the other party.
(S5 R15, 2020 Rules).

Q.

May a transferee of the purchaser or winning
bidder file a motion for the issuance of a writ of
possession?

A.

Yes since the transferee would be entitled to all the
rights of the transferor. (Gallent v. Velasquez, 6
April 2016, Reyes, J.).

Q.

The bank extrajudicially foreclosed upon the
real property of the petitioners and bought it at
the foreclosure safe. After the expiration of the
one-year redemption period, the bank consolidated
its title. The bank later sold the real property to
A corporation which then sold it to the spouses
Chung. Upon failure of the petitioners to vacate
the property, the spouses Chung filed an expa rte petition for the issuance of a writ of
possession. Was it proper for the spouses
Chung to avail of such remedy?

A.

No. Undoubtedly, the spouses Chung can apply for
the issuance of a writ of possession even though
they were not the purchasers at the foreclosure
proceedings. However, unlike the original purchaser,
994

J9JC9B0M

Rule 68
Foreclosure Of Real Estate Mortgage

the Chungs' right to apply for the issuance of a writ
of possession is circumscribed and cannot be
made ex parte; the issuance of a writ of possession
in favor of a subsequent purchaser must be made
only "after hearing and after determining that the
subject property is still in the possession of the
mortgagor." In other words, while the spouses
Chung may file a petition for the issuance of a writ
of possession, it should not be ex parte. (Reyes v.
Chung, 13 September 2017, Velasco, J.; Okabe v.
Saturnino, 26 August 2014, e.b., Peralta, J.).
Q.

What is a deficiency judgment?

A.

A judgment rendered by the court in favor of the
plaintiff for the balance if the proceeds of the
foreclosure sale are not sufficient to pay the
judgment award. The plaintiff shall file a motion with
the court praying that it render a deficiency
judgment. The judgment may be appealed but is
immediately executory.

Q.

May the deficiency judgment be appealed? If so,
within what period may an appeal be taken?

A.

Since foreclosure involves multiple or separate
appeals, the appeal shall be taken by filing a notice
of appeal and a record on appeal within 30 days
from notice of the order. (FLORENZ D. REGALADO,
REMEDIAL LAW COMPENDIUM 509, 752 [7th rev.
ed., 3rd printing]).

Q.

D borrowed P700,000 from C. X executed a real
estate mortgage in favor of C in order to secure
D’s debt. The debt was not paid and C filed an
action for foreclosure against X. The real
property was sold at the foreclosure sale but
the sale only realized proceeds of P400,000.
995

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

May C file a motion for deficiency judgment
against X?
A.

No. In the absence of a contrary stipulation, a thirdparty mortgagor is liable only to the extent of the
real property mortgaged. (Phil. Trust Co. v. Echaus,
52 Phil. 852).

Q.

D a non-resident borrowed P1,000,000 from C
and to secure payment thereof, D executed a
real estate mortgage over his property in
Tagaytay City In favor of C. D failed to pay the
loan so C filed a complaint for foreclosure
against D with the RTC of Tagaytay City. C’s
application for leave to effect extraterritorial
service of summons by publication in a newspaper
of general circulation was granted by the RTC.
In due course, the court rendered a judgment
on foreclosure.
a)

Is the judgment on foreclosure valid?

b)

Assume that the foreclosure sale did not
yield sufficient proceeds to satisfy the
judgment award in favor of C. C then moved
for a deficiency judgment against D which
the court granted. Is the deficiency judgment
valid?

a)

Yes the judgment on foreclosure is valid.
An action for foreclosure of a real estate
mortgage is an action quasi in rem since it is
directed against the property itself. Hence
extraterritorial service of summons under S15
R14 may be had.

996

J9JC9B0M

Rule 68
Foreclosure Of Real Estate Mortgage

b)

Q.

No the deficiency judgment is not valid. The
deficiency judgment is in personam because it
is directed only against the mortgagor-debtor.
Under S15 R14 extraterritorial service of
summons upon a non-resident can be made
only in actions or proceedings in rem or quasi in
rem. Hence the court cannot acquire jurisdiction
over the person of D and the deficiency
judgment rendered against him would be void.

The Asean Banking Corporatoin retained the
services of Atty. Victor Mamon in connection
with its contemplated suit against Dap Textile
Mills, Inc. (DAPO) for the collection of the
latter’s loan in the amount of P650 million.
Payment of the loan was secured by a real
estate mortgage on the textile plant and the
land it occupied, both owned by DAPO.
At the time that the services of Atty. Mamon
were retained, the appraised value of the
mortgaged property was P256 million as
compared to the loan of P650 million. DAPO
defaulted on its loan after the union of its
employees had declared a strike which prevented
everyone from entering the factory premises.
As a consequence, DAPO ceased operations
and its textile plant had since then been
exposed to the elements and risk of fire due to
the presence of highly combustible materials
consisting of synthetic fibers.
The Asean Banking Corporation requested
Atty. Mamon to pursue a cause of action that
would realize two principal objectives: (a)
obtain a judgment for the payment of any
deficiency arising from the foreclosure of the
997

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

mortgage lien; (b) procure the possession and
operation of a textile plant, either by Asean
Banking Corporation or by a third party during
the pendency of the foreclosure proceedings
and until the expiration of the redemption
period after the foreclosure sale, so that that
income derived therefrom could be applied in
partial payment of the loan.
What are the judicial remedies that Atty.
Mamon should pursue to accomplish the two
principal objectives of the Asean Banking
Corporation? (83 Bar Q15).
A.

Atty. Mamon in behalf of Asean Banking Corporation
should file a judicial action for foreclosure of real
estate mortgage and then after the sale, file a motion
for deficiency judgment. (S6 R68).
Upon filing of the foreclosure suit, Atty. Mamon
should in behalf of his client file a verified
application for the appointment of a receiver since
the textile plant is in danger of being wasted or
dissipated or materially injured and its value is
insufficient to discharge the mortgage debt. The
receiver would be a third person except if there is a
written stipulation in the mortgage agreement that
Asean Banking Corporation may be appointed as a
receiver. (S1[cj R59). The receiver would have the
power to take and keep possession of the property
in controversy and to collect debts due to the
corporaton of which he is the receiver and can thus
apply any income from the textile plant to the
payment of the loan. (S6 R59).

998

J9JC9B0M

RULE 69. PARTITION
Q.

Define partition of real estate.

A.

Partition is the process whereby the co-ownership
over real property is terminated by vesting in each
of the co-owners a specific property or allotment of
the proceeds or value of the property.

Q.

May partition be done extrajudicially?

A.

Yes partition may be done extrajudicially by
voluntary agreement among the parties or judicially
by the filing of a complaint for partition by any one
of the co-owners or their assigns.

Q.

When may the action for partition be filed?

A.

At any time. The action for partition does not
prescribe. Under Article 494 of the Civil Code, each
one of the co-owners may demand at any time the
partition of the thing owned in common.
Take note however that if a co-owner
repudiates the co-ownership and claims title over
the property or part thereof, the remedial action is
not one for partition but for reconveyance of
property, in which case prescription may set in.

Q.

Which court has jurisdiction over an action for
partition?

A.

If the subject matter of the action is real property,
jurisdiction would depend upon its assessed value.
If the assessed value exceeds P20.000, or P50.000
within Metro Manila, then it would be the Regional
Trial Court which would have jurisdiction.
Otherwise, it would be the Municipal Trial Court.
999

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

If the subject matter is personal property,
jurisdiction would depend upon the value of the
personal property. If the value exceeds P300,0U0,
or P400.000 within Metro Manila, then jurisdiction
would lie with the Regional Trial Court. Otherwise,
it would be the Municipal Trial Court which would
have jurisdiction. (FERIA & NOCHE, THE 1997
RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE: PROVISIONAL
REMEDIES AND SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS 26667 [2007 ed.]).
If the main purpose of the action however is
the annulment of a deed of adjudication and the
declaration of the plaintiffs as heirs, with the
partition of the property merely being incidental to
the main action, the action is one which is
incapable of pecuniary estimation and hence within
the jurisdiction of the RTC. (Russel v. Vestil, 364
Phil. 392 [1999]).
Q.

Is an action for partition of real property a real
action? What is the venue of an action for
partition of real property?

A.

Yes an action for partition of real property is a real
action since it affects title to or possession of real
property or interest therein. JOSE Y. FERIA,
RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 17 (1997).
Venue would thus lie with the proper court which
has jurisdiction over the area where the real
property or a portion thereof is situated. (S1 R4).

Q.

A files an action in the Municipal Trial Court
against B, the natural son of A’s father, for the
partition of a parcel of land located in Taytay,
Rizal, with an assessed value of P20,000. B
moves to dismiss the action on the ground that
1000

J9JC9B0M

Rule 69
Partition

the case should have been brought in the
Regional Trial Court because the action is one
that is not capable of pecuniary estimation as it
involves primarily a determination of hereditary
rights and not merely the bare right to real
property. Resolve the motion. (00 Bar Q18b).
A.

The motion to dismiss should be denied. The MTC
has jurisdiction over real actions over land with an
assessed value not exceeding P20,000. An action
for partition is a real action; hence the MTC has
jurisdiction since the assessed value does not
exceed P20,000. (See Huguete v. Embudo, G.R.
No. 149554, 1 July 2003).

Q.

A co-heir filed in 2003 with the RTC of Bacolod
City a complaint for partition of inherited
property. The complaint however did not allege
the assessed value of the property subject of
the complaint. May the complaint be dismissed
for lack of jurisdiction?

A.

Yes. For actions on partition, the subject matter is
two-phased. Partition is at once an action (1) for
declaration of co-ownership and (2) for segregation
and conveyance of a determinate portion of the
properties involved. Thus, in a complaint for
partition, the plaintiff seeks, first, a declaration that
he/she is a co-owner of the subject properties, and
second, the conveyance of his/her lawful share. An
action for partition of real estate is at once an action
for the determination of the co-owners of the
subject property and an action for the eventual
conveyance of specific portions thereof to the co­
owners. While this subject matter is incapable of
pecuniary estimation, the proper court which would
have jurisdiction over the action would still depend
1001

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

on the subject property's assessed values in
accordance with Secs. 19(2) and 33 (3) of B.P.
Big. 129. (Agarrado v. Librando-Agarrado, 6 June
2018, Reyes, J.).150
Q.

May an action for partition be employed to
settle a decedent’s estate?

A.

Yes. Co-heirs are co-owners hence they may settle
the estate extrajudicially or judicially. The decedent
should however have died intestate, since if he died
with a will, the heirs cannot partition the estate
without first probating the will. (Guevara v. Guevara,
74 Phil. 479 [1943]; S1 R75).

Q.

Kuya and Diko filed a complaint for partition of
their deceased father’s estate against their
sisters, Ate and Ditse. The brothers alleged that
the four of them are the only heirs of their
deceased father; that they could not agree as to
how their father’s estate should be divided;
that their father left no will and that he left no
debts whatsoever.
Ate and Ditse filed a motion to dismiss
insisting that the proper action should be a
petition for the issuance of letters of
administration and not an action for partition. Is
the motion meritorious? Explain. (86 Bar Q14ed).

A

No, the motion to dismiss is not meritorious. Under
the Law on Partition, the estate of a deceased

,50The court's statement that while action for partition is incapable of
pecuniary estimation, jurisdiction would be based on the assessed value of the
land is self-contradictory. It is more in accord with the ruling to hold that an
action for partition is a real action.

1002

J9JC9B0M

Rule 69
Partition

person may properly be divided since a coownership has arisen among the deceased’s heirs
provided that the deceased died intestate and left
no debts. A petition for issuance of letters of
administration is only an option to settle the estate
and is not mandatory. In fact the heirs in such a
case are encouraged to have the estate partitioned,
whether judicially or extra]udicially, as this is less
expensive than a probate proceeding. (Butiong v.
Plazo, 5 August 2015, Peralta, J.).
Q.

Outline in brief the proceedings in judicial partition.

A.

The proceedings in judicial partition may be briefly
outlined as follows:
1)

COMPLAINT. A person having the right to
compel the partition of real estate may file a
complaint for partition, setting forth the nature
and extent of his title and an adequate
description of the real estate of which partition
is demanded and joining as defendants all
other persons interested in the property.

2)

ORDER FOR PARTITION. If after the trial the
court finds that the plaintiff has the right thereto,
it shall order the partition of the real estate
among all the parties in interest. (S2 R69).

3)

PARTITION BY AGREEMENT. The parties
may, if they are able to agree, make the
partition among themselves by proper instruments
of conveyance, and the court shall confirm the
partition agreement. (S2 R69).4

4)

PARTITION BY COMMISSIONERS. If the
parties cannot agree on the partition, the court
shall appoint not more than 3 competent and
1003

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

disinterested persons as commissioners to
make the partition. (S3 R69).
5)

PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSIONERS.
The commissioners shall: (a) partition the
property, b) if the real estate cannot be divided
without prejudice to the interests of the parties,
the court may assign it to one of the parties
willing to take it, provided he pays to the other
parties such amounts as the commissioners
deem equitable, unless one of the interested
parties asks that the property be sold instead of
being assigned, in which case the court shall
(c) order the commissioners to sell the property
at public sale.

6)

REPORT
OF
COMMISSIONERS.
The
commissioners shall make a full and accurate
report to the court of all their proceedings as to
the partition, or the assignment of the real
estate to one of the parties, or the sale of the
real estate. Upon the filing of the report the clerk
of court shall serve copies on all interested
parties with notice that they have 10 days
within which to file objections to the findings
of the report.

7)

ACTION OF COURT UPON REPORT,
JUDGMENT OF PARTITION. Upon the expiration
of the 10-day period, the court may upon
hearing: (a) accept the report and render judgment
in accordance therewith; (b) recommit the
report to the commissioners for further report of
facts; or (c) set aside the report and appoint
new commissioners; or (d) accept the report in
part and reject it in part; and make such order
and render judgment as shall effectuate a fair
1004

J9JC9B0M

Rule 69
Partition

and just partition of the real estate or its value
(where the realty is assigned or sold) between
the several owners thereof.
Q.

May the order for partition be appealed? If so,
how?

A.

Yes the order for partition is appealable pursuant to
52 R69 which states that “a final order decreeing
partition and accounting may be appealed by any
party aggrieved thereby.” The aggrieved party shall
file a notice of appeal and a record on appeal within
30 days from notice of the order. A record on appeal
is required since there may be a subsequent
appeal from the judgment of partition and/or
accounting for rent and profits under S7 & 8 R69.
{Miranda v. Court of Appeals, 71 SCRA 295; see also
Municipality of Binan v. Garcia, 180 SCRA 576).

Q.

If the parties cannot agree among themselves to
a voluntary partition, is reference to commissioners
mandatory?

A.

Yes. This is shown by the use of the word “shall” in
53 R69.

Q.

May the judgment for partition be appealed? If
so, how?

A.

Yes. It is submitted that the appeal is taken by filing a
notice of appeal within 15 days from notice of the
judgment. There is nothing more left for the trial court
to do after the rendition of the judgment for partition
and no reason for it to retain the records if an appeal
is interposed. Hence the considerations in Miranda v.
Court of Appeals, supra, are not apropos.

Q.

B, C, and D filed an action for partition of a land
alleging that they are co-heirs and co-owners of
the land. After due proceedings, the trial court
rendered a judgment of partition dividing the
land among B, C, and D. The judgment became
final and executory. Y then filed an action to
recover the land against B, C, and D, claiming
that X (the deceased father of B, C, and D) had
sold the land to him 5 years earlier. B, C, and D
countered that X’s rights over the land had been
cut-off by the judgment of partition. Are B, C,
and D correct?

A.

No, B, C, and D are not correct.
Under S12 R69, nothing in R69 shall be
construed so as to prejudice, defeat, or destroy the
right or title of any person claiming real estate
involved by title under any other person, or by title
paramount to the title of the parties among whom
the partition may have been made. The partition of
a thing owned in common shall not prejudice third
persons, who shall retain the rights of mortgage,
servitude, or any other real rights belonging to
them before the division was made. (Article 499,
Civil Code).
Here Y’s title over the land is paramount to that
of B, C, and D since X had no more right over the
land at the time of his demise.

Q.

Petitioners and Respondents are siblings.
Respondents filed an action for partition against
Petitioners. The action was dismissed for failure
to prosecute per S3 R17. The dismissal became
final and unappealable. Subsequently the
Petitioners filed an action for quieting of title
1006

J9JC9B0M

Rule 69
Partition

against the Respondents over the same lot
subject of the partition suit. The court denied the
action for quieting of title but granted the
Respondents’ counterclaim for partition. The
Petitioners contend that the trial court should not
have granted the counterclaim for partition as the
same was barred by res judicata. Is the
counterclaim for partition barred by res judicata?
A.

No. Dismissal with prejudice under S3 R17 cannot „
defeat the right of a co-owner to ask for partition a r
any time, provided that there is no actual
adjudication of ownership of shares yet. Between
dismissal with prejudice under S3 R17 and the right
granted to co-owners under Art. 494 of the Civil
Code, the latter must prevail. To construe otherwise
would diminish the substantive right of a co-owner
through the promulgation of procedural rules. Such
a construction is not sanctioned by the principle
that a substantive law cannot be amended by a
procedural rule. This finds further support from Art.
496 of the Civil Code which provides that “[pjartition
shall be governed by the Rules of Court insofar as
they are consistent with this Code.” (Quintos v.
Nicolas, 16 June 2014).

Q.

What are the 3 kinds of actions available in

The three kinds of actions in order to recover
possession of real property are:
1)

Accion interdictal,

2)

3)

Accion reivindicatoria.

Q.

Accion interdictal is the action to recover physical
possession or possession de facto.151 It refers to
the action for ejectment.
Accion publiciana is the plenary action to
recover the real right of possession.
Accion reivindicatoria is the action to recover
not just possession but ownership of real property.

“physical possession.” The latter term can be erroneously interpreted to refer
only to actual possession when the law protects not only actual but constructive

the assessed value of the real property involved.
Where the assessed value does not exceed
P20.000 (or P50,000 in Metro Manila) it would be
the municipal trial court which would have
jurisdiction. It the assessed value exceeds such
amounts then it would be the regional trial court
which would have jurisdiction.
Q.

May an ejectment suit be resorted to in order to
resolve a boundary dispute?

A.

No. Opposing possessory rights over certain areas
of adjacent lots, arising from claims of ownership
thereof, cannot be resolved in a summary action
such as an ejectment suit. The issues involved in
such a controversy should be fully threshed out in
an accion publiciana or an action reivindicatoria,
and not before the municipal trial court in a
summary proceeding of unlawful detainer or forcible
entry. (Javier v. De Guzman, 2 September 2015,
Peralta, J.).

Q.

In an action for unlawful detainer in the
Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Manila, defendant
X raised in his answer the defense that plaintiff
A is not the real owner of the house subject of
the suit. X filed a counterclaim against A for the
collection of a debt of P380,000 plus accrued
interest of P15,000 and attorney’s fees of P20,000.
a)

Is X’s defense tenable? (98 Bar Q2ed)

xxx
A.

a)

No, X’s defense is not tenable.

The Supreme Court has held that in an
unlawful detainer suit, the issue is not ownership
1009

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

but the physical or material possession of the
subject premises.
X ’s defense is merely that A is not the real
owner but he did not allege that the right of
possession was based on the right of ownership.
Hence X’s defense is untenable.
Q.

Is an action for ejectment an action quasi in rem
or an action in personam?

A.

An ejectment case is an action in personam since it
merely seeks to enforce personal liability against
the Defendant. This can be gleaned from Sections
1, 15, and 17 of Rule 70. (Domagas v. Jensen,
G.R. No. 155847, 17 January 2005). Hence the rule
is that the judgment in an ejectment case is
binding only on one who has been properly
impleaded and given an opportunity to be heard.
(Sunflower Neighborhood Association v. Court of
Appeals, G.R. No. 136274, 3 September 2003).

Q.

What are the exceptions to the rule that the
judgment in an ejectment case is binding only
upon the persons impleaded in the suit?

1)

A trespasser, squatter or agent of the
defendant fraudulently occupying the property
to frustrate the judgment.

2)

A guest or occupant of the premises with the
permission of the defendant.

3)

A transferee pendente lite.

4)

A sublessee.

5)

A co-lessee.
1010

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70

6)

A member of the family, relative or privy of the
defendant. (Sunflower Neighborhood Association
v. Court of Appeals, supra).

Q.

What are the two kinds of ejectment suits?

A.

The two kinds of ejectment suits are suits for
forcible entry and those for unlawful detainer.

Q.

Distinguish forcible entry from unlawful detainer.

1)

AS
TO
NATURE
OF
DEFENDANT’S
POSSESSION. In forcible entry, the defendant’s
possession is unlawful from the start, while in
unlawful detainer, the defendant’s possession
was lawful at the start but later on became illegal.

2)

AS TO NEED FOR DEMAND. In forcible entry
there is no need for prior demand to file it, while
prior demand is needed in unlawful detainer
where the defendant failed to pay or comply
with the conditions of the lease contract.

3)

AS TO PRESCRIPTIVE PERIOD. The oneyear period in forcible entry is counted from the
unlawful deprivation, while in unlawful detainer
the one-year period is counted from the last
demand to pay/comply and vacate or from the
withholding of possession.

4)

AS TO REQUIREMENT OF PRIOR PHYSICAL
POSSESSION. In forcible entry it is required
that the plaintiff had prior physical possession,
while such possession is not required in
unlawful detainer.

Forcible entry
Q.

Define an action for forcible entry.

A.

The action for forcible entry is a summary
proceeding for the recovery of possession by a
person who has been deprived of possession of
any land or building by force, intimidation, threat,
strategy, or stealth. (FISTS)

Q.

What is the prescriptive period for bringing an
action for forcible entry?

A.

Within 1 year after such unlawful deprivation. (Art.
1147[1], Civil Code; S1 R70). Where the unlawful
deprivation is by stealth, the one-year period is
counted from the time the plaintiff came to know of
the unlawful deprivation. (City of Manila v. Garcia,
L-26053, 21 February 1967).

Q.

Is prior demand necessary in an action for
forcible entry?

A.

No. A perusal of Sections 1 and 2 of Rule 70 reveal
that prior demand is unnecessary in an action for
forcible entry.

Q.

What are the essential allegations
complaint for forcible entry?

A.

The essential allegations of a complaint for forcible
entry are the following: (PUF)

a

1)

Prior physical possession
building by the plaintiff; and

Unlawful deprivation of such possession by the
defendant through force, intimidation, stealth,

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

Q.

Is it necessary that the foregoing allegations be
expressly stated in the complaint for forcible entry?

A.

No. The allegations need not be express. It is
sufficient if these matters may be inferred from
other allegations in the complaint. Thus an
allegation that “Defendant unlawfully turned Plaintiff
out of possession of the property though force”
would suffice to allege prior physical possession
since a person who was turned out of possession
has to be in prior physical possession. (Madammu
v. Municipal Court of Manila, 74 Phil. 230).

Q.

On 25 March 1996, Tirona sued Nunez before the
Metropolitan Trial Court of Valenzuela for forcible
entry. Tirona claimed to be owner of various
fishpond lots located at Valenzuela, Metro Manila.
He alleged that on 20 January 20 1996, Nunez, “by
means of force, stealth, or strategy, unlawfully
entered the said fishpond lots and occupied the
same against his will, thereby depriving him of
possession of said fishponds.”
Nunez filed his answer, in which he raised
the defense that the MTC has no subject-matter
jurisdiction over the complaint since Tirona
failed to allege that he was in prior physical
possession, which allegation is jurisdictional in
a complaint for forcible entry. Tirona countered
that the allegation that he was deprived of
possession was in effect an allegation that he
was in prior physical possession.
a)

Should the MTC dismiss the case for lack of
subject-matter jurisdiction?

b)

Assume that Tirona filed a motion for leave
to amend complaint so as to allege prior
1013

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

physical possession on his part. May the
court grant him leave to do so?

a)

Yes the MTC should dismiss the case for lack
of subject-matter jurisdiction. In an action for
forcible entry, an allegation that the plaintiff was
in prior physical possession is mandatory for
the court to acquire jurisdiction.

While the complaint alleged that Tirana was
deprived of possession of the fishponds, it cannot
be inferred from such phrase that the possession
that Tirana was supposedly deprived of was a prior
physical possession.
b)

No. An amendment is not allowed where the
court has no jurisdiction over the original
complaint and the purpose of the amendment is
to confer jurisdiction upon the court. ( Tirona v.
Alejo, 10 October 2001).

Q.

Discuss the meaning of
possession in forcible entry.

prior

physical

A.

Prior physical possession should not be interpreted
literally to refer solely to the situation where Plaintiff is
physically occupying the land or building. Possession
can be acquired not only by material occupation or
the exercise of a right but also by the fact that a thing
is subject to the action of one’s will or by the proper
acts and legal formalities established for acquiring
such right. (Art. 531, Civil Code).
Possession can be acquired by juridical acts
such as donation, succession, and execution of
public instruments. Possession in the eyes of the
law does not mean that a man has to have his feet
1014

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

on every square meter of ground. It is enough that
he is able to subject the property to the action of his
will. (Mangaserv. Ugay, 3 December 2014).
In a case, the Supreme Court held that a prior
vendee of land in a deed of sale executed in a
public instrument was earlier in possession than a
subsequent vendee, even though it was the latter
who first physically occupied the land. Hence the
prior vendee could file a forcible entry case since
he was the one in prior possession. (Wong v.
Carpio, 21 October 1991).
Q.

The complaint for forcible entry alleges that the
plaintiff has been deprived of the land irv
question without stating how such deprivation
took place. Is the complaint sufficient?

A.

No the complaint is not sufficient. There was no
showing from the complaint that the unlawful
deprivation took place through FISTS. (Gumiran v.
Gumiran, 21 Phil. 174).

Q.

The complaint for forcible entry alleges that
“before plaintiff could take possession of and
occupy said house, defendant surreptitiously
and maliciously occupied same without the
knowledge and consent of plaintiff.” Is the
complaint sufficient?

A.

No, the complaint is not sufficient. It is clear from the
allegation that the plaintiff was not able to take prior
physical possession of the property. (Madammu v.
Municipal Court of Manila, 74 Phil. 230).

Unlawful detainer
Q.

Define unlawful detainer.

A.

Unlawful detainer is the summary proceeding for the
recovery of possession filed by a lessor, vendor,
vendee, or other person against whom the
possession of any land or building is unlawfully
withheld by the defendant after the termination or
expiration of the defendant’s right to hold possession
by virtue of an implied or express contract.
In unlawful detainer, the defendant’s right to
possess was initially lawful since he had a right to
do so by virtue of an implied or express contract,
but later on became unlawful after the termination
or expiration of such right.

Q.

Against whom is the unlawful detainer action
brought?

A.

Against the person who is unlawfully withholding
possession from the plaintiff or against any person
claiming under him.

Q.

May a person who had not been in possession
of the premises bring an action for unlawful
detainer of these premises?

A.

Yes. A perusal of S1R70 shows that prior
possession de facto is not required in unlawful
detainer, unlike in forcible entry where the plaintiff
should have been “deprived of the possession.”
What is important in unlawful detainer is that the
plaintiff is a person who has a right to possession
and “against whom the possession of any land or
building is unlawfully withheld.”

1016

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

For instance an action for unlawful detainer
may be brought by a vendee against whom the
possession is unlawfully withheld by the vendor.
(See Maninang v. Court of Appeals, 314 SCRA
525). S1 R70 states that a vendee against whom
the possession of any land or building is unlawfully
withheld after the expiration or the termination of
the right to hold possession by virtue of any
contract, express or implied, may bring an action for
unlawful detainer.
Q.

Ben sold a land to Del with right to repurchase
within one year. Ben remained in possession of
the property. When Ben failed to repurchase the
same, title was consolidated in favor of Del.
Despite demand, Ben refused to vacate the
land, constraining Del to file a complaint for
unlawful detainer. In his defense, Ben contended
that the case should be dismissed because Del
had never been in possession of the property.
Is Ben correct? (08 Bar Q17).

A.

No Ben is not correct. Under S1 R70, prior physical
possession is not required of the plaintiff in unlawful
detainer.

Q.

D stayed in P’s land by the latter’s tolerance. P
then asked D to vacate the land as he was going
to reside therein. D refused. Should P file an
action for forcible entry or unlawful detainer?

A.

Unlawful detainer. D’s possession was initially
lawful albeit only through P’s tolerance. It became
unlawful after D refused to vacate after being asked
to do so by P. Where a person is allowed to stay in
another’s land or building by tolerance, there is an

implied contract that the occupant will leave once
the owner desires to make use of the premises.
Q.

In a complaint for unlawful detainer, is a simple
allegation that the “defendant is unlawfully
withholding possession from the plaintiff”
sufficient?

A.

Yes such an allegation is sufficient for the words
“unlawfully withholding” imply possession on the
defendant’s part, which was lawful at the start,
expired later as a right, and which is being withheld
by the defendant. (Co Tiamco v. Diaz, 75 Phil. 672).

Q.
a) Can the mortgagee-buyer of a foreclosed
property file an action for unlawful detainer
against the mortgagor after the lapse of the
redemption period?
b)

Would the pendency of a suit for the
annulment of the mortgage bar the
ejectment suit?

a)

Yes. This is because the mortgagee-buyer is
entitled to the possession after the expiration of
the redemption period. In such a case the
mortgagor’s right to stay in the premises by virtue
of the real estate mortgage has terminated.

The mortgagee-buyer may ask for a writ of
possession or file an action for ejectment.
b) Pendency of a suit for annulment of the
mortgage is not a bar to the ejectment suit
since the issue in the latter is merely physical

Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

possession not ownership. (Javelosa v. Court
of Appeals, 10 December 1996).
Q.

Union Bank acquired the Maunlad Shopping Mall
after the foreclosure sale. Union Bank then entered
into a contract to sell over the mall in favor of
Maunlad Homes Inc. The price was payable in
installments and upon full payment Union Bank
would execute a deed of absolute sale in favor of
Maunlad Homes. Under the contract, in event of
rescission due to failure to pay or to violation of
the contract, Maunlad Homes would be
immediately required to vacate the property and
turn over possession to Union Bank.
Maunlad Homes failed to pay succeeding
installments and so Union Bank served a notice
of rescission and then a notice to pay and
vacate which Maunlad Homes did not heed.
Union Bank filed an action for unlawful detainer
with the MeTC against Maunland Homes.
Maunlad Homes raised the defense that it still
had the right to possess as it was still was the
owner of the mall because of Union Bank’s
failure to reserve ownership in the contract.
The MeTC dismissed the action for lack of
jurisdiction. It found that Union Bank’s cause
of action was based on a breach of contract and
that both parties are claiming a better right to
possess the property based on their respective
claims of ownership of the property. The MeTC
ruled that the appropriate action to resolve
these conflicting claims was an accion
reivindicatoria, over which it had no jurisdiction.

1019

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

The RTC and the CA affirmed the MeTC’s
decision. The CA additionally held that Union
Bank’s claim of possession is based on its claim
of ownership which in turn is based on its
interpretation of the terms and conditions of the
contract, particularly, the provision on the
consequences of Maunlad Homes’ breach of
contract. The CA determined that Union Bank’s
cause of action is premised on the interpretation
and enforcement of the contract and the
determination of the validity of the rescission,
both of which are matters beyond the jurisdiction
of the MeTC. Therefore, it ruled that the dismissal
of the ejectment suit was proper. Did the MeTC
have jurisdiction over the case?
A.

Yes. Despite Maunlad Homes’ claim of ownership
of the property, the MeTC retained its jurisdiction
over the action; a defendant may not divest the
MeTC of its jurisdiction by merely claiming
ownership of the property. Under S16 R70, “[wjhen
the defendant raises the defense of ownership in
his pleadings and the question of possession
cannot be resolved without deciding the issue of
ownership, the issue of ownership shall be resolved
only to determine the issue of possession.” In
ejectment cases, the MTC has the jurisdiction to
preliminarily determine the issue of ownership in
order to determine the issue of possession.
The authority granted to the MeTC to
preliminarily resolve the issue of ownership to
determine the issue of possession ultimately allows
it to interpret and enforce the contract or agreement
between the plaintiff and the defendant. To deny
the MeTC jurisdiction over a complaint merely
because the issue of possession requires the
1020

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

interpretation of a contract will effectively rule out
unlawful detainer as a remedy. As stated, in an
action for unlawful detainer, the defendant’s right to
possess the property may be by virtue of a contract,
express or implied; corollarily, the termination of the
defendant’s right to possess would be governed by«$
the terms of the same contract. Interpretation of the
contract between the plaintiff and the defendant is
inevitable because it is the contract that initially
granted the defendant the right to possess the
property; it is this same contract that the plaintiff
subsequently claims was violated or extinguished,
terminating the defendant’s right to possess. (Union
Bank v. Maunlad Homes, Inc., G.R. 190071, 15
August 2012).
Q.

Is prior demand required in an unlawful detainer
case?

A.

No, as a rule prior demand is not required in an
unlawful detainer case. The exception is where the
unlawful detainer suit is brought by the lessor
against the lessee on the ground of the latter’s
failure to pay or to comply with the conditions of
the lease. (S2 R70).
Also where the unlawful detainer is based on
defendant’s possession through tolerance, a
demand for the defendant to vacate is necessary.

Q.

X leased his land to B under a one-year lease
contract from 1 January 2014 to 31 December
2014 with monthly rental of P30,000. Despite the
expiration of the lease, B continued to possess
the land without any notice to vacate from X.
On 14 January 2015, X filed with the MTC an
action for unlawful detainer against B, alleging
1021

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

that B was withholding possession despite the
expiration of the lease contract. B filed a motion
to dismiss on the ground of lack of jurisdiction,
contending that X had not made a prior demand
to vacate against him. Should the motion to
dismiss be granted?
A.

No. Prior demand is not required in an unlawful
detainer case if the ground of the suit is
the termination or expiration of the defendant’s right
to possess.
Here the defendant B’s right to possess had
terminated upon the expiration of the lease contract.

Q.

Same facts as the preceding question except
that the unlawful detainer suit was filed on
16 January 2015. Should the motion to dismiss
be granted?

A.

No. Under Article 1670, if at the end of the lease,
the lessee should continue enjoying the thing
leased for 16 days with the acquiescence of the
lessor, and unless a notice to the contrary by either
party has been given, it is understood that there is
an implied new lease for the time established in
Article 1687. Here since the lease was paid
monthly, a month-to-month lease was impliedly
established for the month of January 2015. The
monthly lease had not yet expired when X brought
the suit in 16 January 2015.
What X should do is to serve prior notice to B
that he is terminating the lease for the succeeding
month of February 2015. X may then bring an
action for unlawful detainer against B if the latter
refuses to leave.
1022

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

Q.

What is the prescriptive period for bringing an
action for unlawful detainer?

A.

Within 1 year after the unlawful withholding of
possession. (Art. 1147[1], Civil Code; S1 R70).
Upon the expiration of the lease, the lessee is
already considered to be unlawfully withholding the
property; hence the right of action for unlawful
detainer immediately arises. (Panganiban v.
Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp., 395 SCRA 624).
In case of failure to pay or to comply with the
conditions of the lease, the action should be
brought within one year from the expiration of the
15-day or 5-day period from demand (the last
demand in case there are more than one) or from
the service or posting of written notice as provided
in S2 R70.

Q.

In an unlawful detainer complaint, it was alleged
that defendant occupied the land through the
plaintiff’s tolerance, that plaintiffs demanded
that defendant vacate the property but to no
avail; hence the plaintiffs served upon defendant
a formal demand to vacate dated 1 September
2003 which was not heeded. The complaint was
filed on 6 October 2003. The MTC ruled in favor
of plaintiffs. On appeal, the Court of Appeals set
aside the decision on the ground that the MTC
did not acquire jurisdiction. The CA held that in
ejectment cases, is it a requirement that the
complaint should aver, as jurisdictional facts,
when and how entry into the property was
made. Did the CA rule correctly?

1023

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

No. The requirement that the complaint should
aver, as jurisdictional facts, when and how entry
into the property was made by the defendants
applies only when the issue is the timeliness of the
filing of the complaint before the MTC. This is
because, in forcible entry cases, the prescriptive
period is counted from the date of defendants’
actual entry into the property; whereas, in unlawful
detainer cases, it is counted from date of the last
demand to vacate. Hence, to determine whether
the case was filed on time, there is a necessity to
ascertain whether the complaint is one for forcible
entry or for unlawful detainer; and since the main
distinction between the two actions is when and how
defendant entered the property, the determinative
facts should be alleged in the complaint.
Here the Complaint was filed on October 6,
2003 or within one year from the time the formal
demand to vacate was made. Hence timeliness of
the complaint was not at issue and thus the
Complaint sufficiently established a case for
unlawful detainer as to vest the MTC with
jurisdiction. (Deia Cruz v. Capco, 17 March 2014,
Del Castillo, J.).152

Q.

A complaint fo r unlawful detainer was filed with
the MTC by Plaintiff on 24 December 2008 which
contained the following allegations: (1) Plaintiff
was in possession and control of subject

,52The court’s reasoning appears to be faulty. If the dispossession was
through FISTS, then the one-year period would have been counted from the
unlawful deprivation through FISTS rather than from the last demand and thus
timeliness would have been an issue. It is submitted that the CA’s decision was
the correct one. To justify an action for unlawful detainer based on tolerance, it is
essential that the complaint allege that the plaintiffs tolerance must have been
present right from the start of the possession sought to be recovered. (See
Z a c a r ia s v. A n a c a y , 24 September 2014).

1024

property, however, sometime in May 2007 she
discovered that Defendants have entered the
subject property and occupied the same; (2)
Plaintiff demanded that they leave the premises.
The defendants requested for time to leave and
she acceded to said request. The defendants
committed to vacate the subject property by the
end of May, 2008; (3) Despite several repeated
demands, defendants unjustifiably refused to
vacate the subject premises prompting the
Plaintiff to seek the assistance of a lawyer who
wrote them a formal and final demand letter in
July 2008 to vacate the premises and to pay
reasonable compensation for their illegal use
and occupancy of the subject property. Does
the MTC have jurisdiction over the complaint?
A.

No. To justify an action for unlawful detainer, it is
essential that the plaintiff’s supposed acts of
tolerance must have been present right from the
start of the possession which is later sought to be
recovered. Otherwise, if the possession was
unlawful from the start, an action for unlawful
detainer would be an improper remedy.
The above complaint failed to allege a cause
of action for unlawful detainer as it does not
describe possession by the Defendants being
initially legal or tolerated by the Plaintiff and which
became illegal upon termination by the Plaintiff of
such lawful possession. Plaintiffs insistence that
she actually tolerated Defendants’ continued
occupation after her discovery of their entry into the
subject premises is incorrect. As she had averred,
she discovered respondents’ occupation in May
2007. Such possession could not have been legal
from the start as it was without her knowledge or

consent, much less was it based on any contract,
express or implied. The possession of the defendant
in unlawful detainer is originally legal but became
illegal due to the expiration or termination of the
right to possess. Where the complaint did not
satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of a valid
cause for unlawful detainer, the municipal trial court
had no jurisdiction over the case.
MTC clearly had no jurisdiction over the case as
the complaint did not satisfy the jurisdictional
requirement of a valid cause for unlawful detainer.
Since the prescriptive period for filing an action for
forcible entry has lapsed, petitioner could not convert
her action into one for unlawful detainer, reckoning
the one-year period to file her action from the time of
her demand for respondents to vacate the property.
(.Zacarias v. Anacay, 24 September 2014).153
Q.

What are the requirements of the demand or
notice under S2 R70?

1)

The demand made on the lessee must be to
pay or to comply with the conditions of the
lease and to vacate. (S2 R70).

2)

If demand cannot be made upon the lessee
himself, by serving written notice of such
demand upon the person found in the premises
or by posting written notice of such demand on
the premises if no person be found thereon.

163ln D e la Cruz v. Capco, the complaint alleged that defendant’s possession
was tolerated without indicating that defendant unlawfully deprived plaintiff of
possession through FISTS. Compare with Z a c a ria s where complaint alleged that
she discovered defenant’s occupation which was without her knowledge and
consent, and which allegation in effect made it a case of forcible entry.

1026

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

3)

The lessee failed to comply with the demand
within 15 days in case of land and 5 days in
case of building. The 15/5-day period is
counted from notice if made upon the lessee or
the person found in the premises or from the
posting of the notice of demand on the
premises if no person be found thereon.

Q.

Is the demand under S2 R70 required to be
in writing?

A.

The demand made on the lessee himself need not
be in writing. (Jakihaca v. Aquino, 181 SCRA 67).
The demand should be in writing however if
the demand cannot be made on the lessee himself.
In such case, the written demand should be served
on the person found in the premises or posted in
the premises if no person be found thereon.

Q.

The lessee failed to pay the rent for 3 months.
The lessor served a written notice upon the
lessee to pay the rent or vacate the premises.
The lessee failed to either pay or vacate within 5
days from receipt of the notice. May the lessor file
a suit for unlawful detainer against the lessee?

A.

No. The jurisdictional demand in unlawful detainer
is a demand to pay and vacate. As worded,
plaintiffs demand gave defendant an alternative of
either paying the rent or vacating. When defendant
then elected to stay after such demand, he became
merely a debtor for the unpaid rental and cannot be
ejected until he defaults in payment and a demand
is made upon him. ( Vda. de Murga v. Chan, 25
SCRA 441).

1027

Q.

In the preceding problem, what if the lessor
served a demand to vacate without any demand
to pay?

A.

The demand Is sufficient for purposes of complying
with the jurisdictional requirement. The reason is
that the defendant is left with no choice to defeat
ejectment, unlike in a demand letter couched as
“pay/comply or vacate.”

Q.

Plaintiff lessor filed with the MTC an unlawful
detainer case against the lessee. The demand
letter by the lessor informed the lessee that he
was unilaterally rescinding the lease and
demanded that lessee vacate the premises. The
MTC dismissed the ejectment case for lack of
jurisdiction, holding that accion publiciana was
the proper remedy. Was the dismissal proper?

A.

Yes. The lessor’s letter to the lessee informing him
that the lease is unilaterally rescinded and demanding
that lessee vacate is not the jurisdictional demand
required under S2 R70. (Quesada v. Bonanza
Restaurants, 14 Nov 2016, Brion, J.).

Q.

D sold her residential land to P but D requested
that she be allowed to live in the house with a
promise to vacate as soon as she was able to
find a new residence. After D had been living in
the house fo r one year, P demanded that D
vacate but D failed or refused to do so. On
appeal the RTC held that there was no valid
demand to pay and vacate since the demand
was to vacate only. Was the RTC correct?

A.

No. Demand to vacate is sufficient where the
defendant’s possession was based on the plaintiff’s
1028

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

tolerance, and not on any contract between them.
(Macaslang v. Zamora, G.R. No. 156375, 30
May 2011).
Q.

What is an implied new lease?

A.

It is a new lease which results if at the end of the
lease contract the lessee should continue enjoying
the thing leased for 15 days with the acquiescence
of the lessor, and unless a notice to the contrary by
either party has previously been given. The period*
of the lease shall be for the time established in
Articles 1682 and 1687 of the Civil Code and the
other terms of the contract shall be revived. (Article
1670, Civil Code).

Q.

What are the consequences if a complaint for
forcible entry or unlawful detainer is defective,
that is the allegations therein do not make out a
case for forcible entry or unlawful detainer?

A.

The following are the consequences if a complaint
for forcible entry or unlawful detainer is so defective
(PJ):
1)

The action would be treated as an accion
publiciana or accion reivindicatoria and hence
governed by the regular procedure.

2)

The MTC would not have jurisdiction if the
assessed value as alleged in the complaint
exceeds the jurisdictional amount or if there is
no allegation regarding the assessed value.

Q.

Are ejectment cases governed by the Rule on
Summary Procedure?

A.

Yes, all actions for forcible entry and unlawful
detainer, irrespective of the amount of damages or
1029

J9JC9B0M

unpaid rentals sought to be recovered, shall be
governed by the Rule on Summary Procedure.
Q.

What are the prohibited pleadings, motions, and
petitions under the Rule 70?

A.

(6M [dbp red] TM PIRC)

1) Motion to dismiss or quash except where the
ground is non-referral for conciliation and lack of subject
matter jurisdiction.
2)

Motion for bill of particulars.

3)

Motion for postponements which are dilatory.

4)

Motion for reconsideration of a judgment, re­
opening, and new trial.

5)

Motion for extension of time to file pleadings or
papers.

6)

Motion to declare defendant in default.

7)

Third-party complaint.

8)

Memoranda.

9)

Petition for relief from judgment.

10) Intervention.
11) Reply.
12) Certiorari, prohibition, and mandamus against
interlocutory orders.
Q.

P filed an action for unlawful detainer against D
alleging that D had not been paying rent for
over a year and that D refused to leave despite
P’s demand upon him to pay and vacate. D filed
a verified answer in which he interposed a
1030

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

counterclaim for collection of a P200,000 loan
he had extended to P for the latter to buy a
used car. If you were the counsel for P what
would you do?
A.

I would file a motion to expunge the counterclaim.
Under S4 R70 the only pleadings allowed in an
ejectment case are the complaint, compulsory
counterclaim, cross-claim and the answers thereto.
The counterclaim of D is permissive since it does
not arise out of nor is it connected to the lease
between P and D.

Q.

In an action for unlawful detainer in the
Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Manila, defendant
X raised in his answer the defense that plaintiff
A is not the real owner of the house subject of
the suit. X filed a counterclaim against A for the
collection of a debt of P380,000 plus accrued
interest of P15,000 and attorney’s fees of P20,000.
a)

xxx

b)

Does the MTC have jurisdiction over the
counterclaim? (98 Bar Q2 ed)

b)

Yes the MTC has subject-matter jurisdiction
over the counterclaim.

Under B.P. Big. 129, the MTC in Metro Manila
has jurisdiction where the amount of the claim,
excluding interests and attorney’s fees, does not
exceed P400,000.
Here the amount of the counterclaim, exclusive
of interests and costs, does not exceed P400.000.
Hence the MTC has jurisdiction.
1031

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

However the MTC does not have jurisdiction to
act on the counterclaim since a permissive
counterclaim is not allowed under the Rule on
Summary Procedure. Hence it is a mere scrap of
paper which should not be considered by the Court.
(S4 R70).
Q.

P filed with the MeTC of Las Pinas City an action
for forcible entry against D. The complaint
alleges that the land subject of the action is in
Muntinlupa City. Without even waiting for the
answer of D, the judge dismissed the complaint
on the ground of improper venue. Was the
judge’s action proper?

A.

Yes the judge’s action was proper.
Under S5 R70, the court may, from an
examination of the allegations in the complaint and
such evidence as may be attached thereto, dismiss
the case outright on any of the grounds for the
dismissal of a civil action which are apparent
therein. If no ground for dismissal is found, it shall
forthwith issue summons.

Q.

Within what time should the defendant in an
ejectment case file and serve his answer?

A.

Within 10 days from service of summons. (S6 R70).
The answer to counterclaims or cross-claims shall
be served and filed within 10 days from service of
the answer in which they are pleaded. Note that a
motion for extension of time to file answer is
prohibited (S13 R70).

Q.

What is the result if defenses available to the
defendant are not pleaded in the answer?

1032

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

A.

Affirmative and negative defenses not pleaded in
the answer are deemed waived, except lack of
subject-matter jurisdiction. (S6 R70).

Q.

What is the effect if the defendant fails to answer?

A.

Should the defendant fail to answer the complaint
within 10 days from service of summons, the court,
motu proprio or on plaintiff’s motion, shall render
judgment as may be warranted by the facts alleged
in the complaint and limited to what is prayed for
therein. The court may in its discretion reduce the
amount of damages and attorney’s fees claimed for
being excessive or otherwise unconscionable,
without prejudice to the applicability of S3(c) R9 if
there are two or more defendants. (S7 R70).

Q.

The complaint for unlawful detainer filed before
the MeTC by Fairland Knitcraft Corporation
against Po contained the following allegations:
Fairland was the owner of Condominium Unit
No. 205 in Cedar Mansion II on Ma. Escriba
Street, Pasig City. The said unit was leased by
Fairland to Po by verbal agreement, with a
rental fee of P20,000.00 a month, to be paid by
Po at the beginning of each month. From March
2011, Po had continuously failed to pay rent.
For said reason, Fairland opted not to renew the
lease agreement anymore. On January 30, 2012,
Fairland sent a formal letter to Po demanding
that he pay the amount of P220,000.00,
representing the rental arrears, and that he
vacate the leased premises within 15 days from
the receipt of the letter. Despite receipt of the
demand letter and the lapse of the said 15-day
period to comply, Po neither tendered payment
for the unpaid rent nor vacated the premises.
1033

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Thus, on December 12, 2012, Fairland was
constrained to file the complaint for unlawful
detainer before the MeTC.
Po failed to file an answer within the
reglementary period. Hence Fairland filed a
motion to render judgment. The MeTC considered
the case submitted for decision. Po filed a
Motion for Leave of Court to file Comment/
Opposition to Motion to Render Judgment. In
the attached Comment/Opposition, Po denied
the allegations against him and commented that
there was no supporting document that would
show that Fairland owned the property; that
there was no lease contract between them; and
that there were no documents attached to the
complaint which would show that previous
demands had been made and received by him.

In its decision, the MeTC dismissed the
complaint for lack of merit due to Fairland’s
failure to prove its claim by preponderance of
evidence. The MeTC explained that although the
complaint sufficiently alleged a cause of action,
Fairland failed to prove that it was entitled to the
possession of the subject property. The MeTC
also stated that there was no evidence presented
to support Fairtand’s claim against Po either.
On appeal, Fairland posits that judgment
should have been rendered in its favor on the
basis of the complaint itself and not on its
failure to adduce proof of ownership over the
subject property, is Fairland correct?

1034

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

A.

Yes. S6 of the Rule on Summary Procedure and S7
R70 are clear that in case the defendant fails to file **
his answer, the court shall render judgment, either
motu proprio or upon plaintiffs motion, based
solely on the facts alleged in the complaint and
limited to what is prayed for. The failure of the
defendant to timely file his answer and to controvert
the claim against him constitutes his acquiescence
to every allegation stated in the complaint.
Logically, there is nothing to be done in this
situation except to render judgment as may be
warranted by the facts alleged in the complaint.
Judgment shall be rendered based only on the
complaint of Fairland without the need to consider
the weight of evidence. The complaint of Fairland
had a valid cause of action for unlawful detainer.
Consequently, there is no more need to present
evidence to establish the allegation of Fairland of
its ownership and superior right of possession over
the subject property. (Fairland Knitcraft Corp. v. Po,
27 January 2016, Mendoza, J.).

Q.

When is the preliminary conference held?

A.

Not later than 30 days after the last answer is filed,
a preliminary conference shall be held. (S8 R70).

Q.

Are the provisions of R18 on pre-trial applicable
to the preliminary conference?

A.

Yes unless the same are inconsistent with the
provisions of R70.

Q.

What is the result of the failure of a party to
appear during the preliminary conference?

A.

The failure of the plaintiff to appear in the preliminary
conference shall be cause for the dismissal of his
1035

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

complaint. The defendant who appears in the
absence of the plaintiff shall be entitled to judgment
on his counterclaim in accordance with S7.
If a sole defendant shall fail to appear, the
plaintiff shall likewise be entitled to judgment in
accordance with S7 R70. This procedure shall not
apply where one of two or more defendants sued
under a common cause of action who had pleaded
a common defense shall appear at the preliminary
conference. (S8 R70).
Q.

What happens after the preliminary conference
is terminated?

A.

Within 5 days after the termination of the
preliminary conference, the court shall issue an
order stating the matters taken up therein, including
but not limited to:
1)

Whether the parties have arrived at an amicable
settlement, and if so the terms thereof;

2)

The stipulations or admissions entered into by
the parties;

3)

Whether, on the basis of the pleadings and the
stipulations and admissions made by the
parties, judgment may be rendered without
need of further proceedings, in which event the
judgment shall be rendered within 30 days from
issuance of the order;

4)

A clear specification of material facts which
remain controverted; and

5)

Such other matters intended to expedite the
disposition of the case.

1036

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

Q.

Is a full-blown trial conducted in ejectment cases?

A.

No. Instead within 10 days from receipt of the
preliminary conference order, the parties shall
submit the affidavits of their witnesses and other
evidence on the factual issues defined in the order,
together with their position papers setting forth, the
law and the facts relied upon by them. (S10 R70).

Q.

When shall the court render judgment?

A.

Within 30 days after receipt of the affidavits and
position papers, or .the expiration of the period for
filing the same, the court shall render judgment.

Q.

What may the court do if there is no showing
of a referral in a case requiring referral for
conciliation?

A.

The court may sua sponte or upon motion dismiss
the case without prejudice. The case may be
revived only after that requirement shall have been
complied with. (S12 R70).

Q.

In an ejectment case, the court dismissed the
complaint for failure of the plaintiff to appear
during the preliminary conference. The Plaintiff
filed a motion for reconsideration of the
dismissal order. The Defendant contends that the
dismissal had become final and executory since
the motion for reconsideration is a prohibited
pleading and hence does not suspend the
reglementary period to appeal. Is the Defendant’s
contention correct?

A.

No. The motion for reconsideration of a judgment
prohibited under Sec. 19(c) of the RSP is that
which seeks reconsideration of a judgment
rendered by the court after trial on the merits. The
1037

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

dismissal order is not a judgment on the merits after
trial of the case. (Lucas v. Fabros, 324 SCRA 1).
Q.

Discuss the availability of preliminary injunction
in ejectment cases,

A.

Preliminary (prohibitive) injunction
The court may grant preliminary injunction, in
accordance with the provisions of R58 to prevent
the defendant from committing further acts of
dispossession against the plaintiff.

Preliminary mandatory injunction
A possessor deprived of his possession
through forcible entry or unlawful detainer may,
within 5 days from the filing of the complaint,
present a motion in the action for forcible entry or
unlawful detainer for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction to restore him in
his possession. The court shall decide the motion
within 30 days from the filing thereof. (S15 R70).
It should be noted that S15 R70 modifies
Article 539 of the Civil Code in two ways: First by
extending the remedy of preliminary mandatory
injunction to unlawful detainer. Second, by limiting
the period within which the remedy may be availed
of from 10 days to 5 days from the filing
of the complaint.
Preliminary mandatory injunction in case of appeal
Upon motion of the plaintiff, within 10 days
from the perfection of the appeal to the RTC, the
latter may issue a writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction to restore the plaintiff in possession if the
1038

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

court is satisfied that the defendant’s appeal is
frivolous or dilatory, or that the plaintiffs appeal is
prima facie meritorious. (S20 R70). Take note
that this remedy is available to plaintiff even if
he lost before the MTC provided that the RTC
is satisfied that the plaintiff’s appeal is prima
facie meritorious.
Q.

In ejectment cases, may the defendant raise the
defense of ownership?

A.

The general rule is that in ejectment cases the
defendant may not raise the defense of ownership
in his pleadings. The reason is that the issue in
ejectment cases is not ownership but merely
physical possession.
The exception is where the question of
possession cannot be resolved without deciding the
issue of ownership; provided, that the issue of
ownership shall be resolved only to determine the
issue of possession. (S16R70).

Q.

If after trial, the court finds that the allegations
of the complaint are true, what are the reliefs it
shall grant to the plaintiff in the judgment?

A.

(RARAC)
1)

Restitution of the premises.

2)

The sum justly due as arrears of rent or as
reasonable compensation for the occupation
and use of the premises.

3)

Attorney’s fees, and

4)

Costs. (S17R70).

1039

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

Can the trial court award moral and exemplary
damages in favor of the plaintiff?

A.

No, The only damages that may be awarded by
the court are those provided for in S17 R70.

Q.

In ejectment cases, may the court award
attorney’s fees exceeding P20,000?

A.

Yes. The limitation in Sec. 1(A)(1) of the Rule on
Summary Procedure was deleted in S7 & S17 R70
of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. (HONORATO
Y. AQUINO, ASPECTS OF JURISDICTION 113
[1999 ed.]).154

Q.

In an action for unlawful detainer based on the
plaintiffs tolerance of defendant’s possession,
when should the back rentals start to run?
From the occupation by tolerance or from the
time of the demand to vacate?

A.

From the time of the demand to vacate. It is
inconsistent to demand payment of rentals during
the period of tolerance. (Pro-Guard Security v.
Tormil Realty, 7 July 2014).

Q.

D is renting an apartment unit from P under a
one-year lease contract with rent payable
monthly at P10,000. Ten days after the expiration
of the lease contract, P, without making a prior
written demand to pay and vacate, filed an
unlawful detainer suit against D. D filed a motion
to dismiss on the ground that P did not comply
with the jurisdictional requirement of prior demand.

,54The pronouncement in D e la R o s a v. R o ld a n , 5 September 2006, that
the P20.000 ceiling applies to ejectment cases before the MTC, referred to a
MTC judgment rendered in 25 September 1996 or prior to the effectivity of the
1997 Rules of Civil Procedure on 1 July 1997.

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

a)

Is the motion to dismiss a prohibited pleading?

b)

How should the judge rule on the motion to
dismiss?

c)

Assume that you were consulted by P prior
to the filing of the ejectment case and he
asks your opinion on the fastest way for
him to take possession of the apartment
unit. What would be your advice?

d)

Can P include in his complaint a prayer for
moral and exemplary damages in the
amount of P100,000?

e)

If D files an answer, could he interpose
therein a counterclaim for moral and
exemplary damages against P in the amount
of P100,000 arising from the filing of the suit
against him (D)?

a)

No. A motion to dismiss is allowed when it is
based on the ground of lack of subject-matter
jurisdiction. (S13 R70). Here the motion to
dismiss alleges that there was no jurisdictional
demand which in effect alleges that the
MTC has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter
of the suit.

b) The judge should deny the motion to dismiss.
Prior demand is not required where the action
for unlawful detainer is based on termination
of the defendant’s right to hold possession.
(S1 R70).

d)

No. The only damages that can be recovered in
an unlawful detainer suit are the fair rental
value or the reasonable compensation for the
use and occupation of the real property,
attorney's fees, and costs. (S17 R70). Other
damages must be claimed in an ordinary
action. (Feiisilda v. Villanueva, 139 SCRA431).

e)

Yes. The claim for moral and exemplary
damages arising from the filing of the suit is a
compulsory counterclaim which is allowed
under S4 R70.

P filed a case of unlawful detainer against D
over real property with an assessed value of
P60,000. P alleged that D failed to pay the rent
for over a year and that he made a written
demand on D pay or to vacate the leased
premises. D filed a motion to dismiss on the
ground that the demand of P on D was for D to
pay or vacate.
a)

Is the motion to dismiss filed by D a
prohibited pleading?

Assume that the court grants the motion to
dismiss. P filed a motion for reconsideration of
the order dismissing the case.

Assume that the court denies the motion to

May D file a motion for reconsideration of

d)

Assume that D filed the motion for
reconsideration and the court denies the
same. May D file a special civil action fo t
certiorari and mandamus with the RTC

The MTC proceeded to try the case on the
merits and then rendered judgment in favor of
P. D appealed to the RTC contending that the
MTC has no jurisdiction over the case.
e)

On appeal, should the RTC dismiss or
decide the case?

f)

Assume that the RTC decided to take
cognizance of the appeal. On appeal, may the
RTC admit an amended pleading by D in which
he raises a counterclaim for P200,000 as moral
and exemplary damages for the filing by P of a
baseless and harassment suit?

g)

The RTC decided the case in favor of P.
What mode of appeal should D avail of if he
wants to have the decision of the RTC
reviewed?

h)

Is the judgment of the RTC immediately
executory?

a)

The motion to dismiss filed by D is not a
prohibited pleading. A motion to dismiss is not "
prohibited if it is based on lack of jurisdiction
over the subject matter. Here D’s ground that
1043

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

there was a failure to comply with the
jurisdictional demand to pay and vacate is in
effect a motion to dismiss on the ground that
the MTC has no jurisdiction over the subject
matter since the demand to pay and vacate is
jurisdictional in unlawful detainer cases.
b)

The motion for reconsideration is not a
prohibited pleading, In Lucas v. Fabro, 324
SCRA 1, it was held that the motion for
reconsideration which is prohibited is one which
seeks reconsideration of a judgment rendered
by the court after trial on the merits. Here the
dismissal was done without a trial on the merits
being conducted,

c)

Yes. What is prohibited under S13(3) R70 is
only a motion for reconsideration of a judgment.
Hence a motion for reconsideration of an
interlocutory order is not prohibited.

d)

No. Under SI 3(8) R70, a petition for certiorari
or mandamus against any interlocutory order
issued by the trial court in ejectment cases is a
prohibited pleading. The order denying the
motion to dismiss is an interlocutory order.

e)

The RTC should decide the case. Under S8
R40, if a case was tried on the merits by the
lower court without jurisdiction over the subject
matter, the RTC on appeal shall not dismiss the
case if it has original jurisdiction thereof, but
shall decide the case, without prejudice to the
admission of amended pleadings and additional
evidence in the interest of justice.

f)

No. A counterclaim should be within the
jurisdiction of the RTC both as to nature and
1044

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

amount. Here the amount of P200,000 lies
below the jurisdictional amount for the RTC.
The RTC is trying the case in the exercise of
its appellate rather than original jurisdiction;
hence the exceptive clause of S7 R6 finds
no application.

Q.

g)

D should avail of the petition for review under
R42. This is because the judgment of the RTC
was rendered in the exercise of its appellate,
not original, jurisdiction.

h)

Yes the judgment of the RTC is immediately
executory. Under S21 R70 the RTC’s judgment
against the defendant shall be immediately
executory, without prejudice to a further appeal
that may be taken therefrom.

D sold a parcel of land to P with an assessed
value of P15,000. After the delivery of the title
over the land to P, D despite P’s demand
refused to turn over possession to P.
a)

May P file an action for unlawful detainer
against D?

Assume that P filed an unlawful detainer
case against D.
b)

May D raise the defense that he is still the
owner since the sale was subject to the
suspensive condition that P should first
clear the premises of squatters?

After trial, the court rendered judgment in
favor of P finding that P is entitled to the
possession of the land as the contract of sale
was not subject to any suspensive condition.
1045

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

c)

May D later on file with the MeTC an action
to recover the ownership of the land
as against P?

a)

Yes P may file an action for unlawful detainer
against D.

An action for unlawful detainer may be brought
by a vendee against whom the possession in
unlawfully withheld by the vendor. (See Maninang
v. Court of Appeals, 314 SCRA 525). S1 R70 states
that a vendee against whom the possession of any
land or building is unlawfully withheld after the
expiration or the termination of the right to hold
possession by virtue of any contract, express or
implied, may bring an action for unlawful detainer.
b)

Yes D may raise the defense of ownership
since in this case the issue of possession
cannot be resolved without determining the
issue of ownership. Here the issue of ownership
hinges on whether the sale was subject to a
suspensive condition.

c)

Yes. When the defendant raises the defense of
ownership in his pleadings and the question of
possession cannot be resolved without
deciding the issue of ownership, the issue of
ownership shall be resolved only to determine
the issue of possession. (S16 R70). Likewise
S18 R70 provides that the judgment in an
ejectment case shall be conclusive with respect
to the possession only and shall in no wise
bind the title or affect the ownership of the land
or building.
1046

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

Q.

To what court is the judgment or final order in
an ejectment case appealable?

A.

The judgment or final order shall be appealable to
the appropriate Regional Trial Court.

Q.

How shall the Regional Trial Court decide the
appeal?

A.

The Regional Trial Court shall decide the appeal on
the basis of the entire record of the proceedings had
in the court of origin and such memoranda and/or
briefs as may be submitted by the parties or required
by the Regional Trial Court. (S18 R70). As such, the
RTC, in exercising appellate jurisdiction, is not
limited to the errors assigned in the appeal
memorandum but could decide on the basis of the
entire record of the proceedings had in the trial court
and such memoranda and/or briefs as may
be submitted by the parties or required by the RTC.
(.Macaslang v. Zamora, 30 May 2011, Bersamin, J.).

Q.

Is the judgment of the MTC in ejectment cases
immediately executory?

A.

The judgment of the MTC against the Plaintiff is not
immediately executory pending appeal.
The judgment of the MTC against the
defendant is immediately executory unless: (SAD)
1)

An appeal has been perfected;

2)

The defendant to stay execution files a
sufficient supersedeas bond, approved by the
MTC and executed in favor of the plaintiff to
pay the rents, damages, and costs accruing
down to the time of the judgment appealed
from; and
1047

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

3)

During the pendency of the appeal, the
defendant deposits with the appellate court the
amount of rent due from time to time under the
contract, if any, as determined by the judgment
of the MTC, or in the absence of a contract, the
defendant deposits with the RTC the
reasonable value of the use and occupation of
the premises for the preceding month or period
at the rate determined by the judgment of the
lower court on or before the 10th day of each
succeeding month or period. (S19 R70)

Q.

What is the effect of failure of the defendant to
make the periodic deposit?

A.

The appellate court, upon plaintiffs motion and
upon proof of such failure, shall order the execution
of the appealed judgment with respect to the
restoration of possession, but such execution shall
not be a bar to the appeal taking its course until the
final disposition thereof on the merits. (S19 R70).

Q.

The Defendant appealed from the judgment in
an unlawful detainer case. Pending appeal and
because of the Defendant’s failure to deposit
the rental corresponding to April, the Plaintiff
filed with the RTC on May 11 a motion for
execution with respect to the restoration of
possession. After the filing of the motion or on
May 13, the Defendant made the deposit of
rentals corresponding to April. The RTC denied
the motion for execution on the ground that the
deposit had already been made on May 13. Was
the denial of the motion for execution correct?

Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

S

A.

No. S19 R70 regarding the periodic deposit of the
rentals corresponding to the previous month within
the first ten days of the succeeding month is
mandatory. The fact that the actual deposit was
made shortly after the expiration of the first ten
days cannot make any difference. Failure to make
the deposit of rentals within the period fixed by law,
however short the delay, gives the appellee the
right to execution of the judgment, which the court
is bound to grant and enforce. (Carbungco v.
Amparo, G.R. No. L-2245, 20 May 1949).

Q.

Distinguish the supersedeas bond from the
periodic deposit.

A.

The supersedeas bond covers only the rent,
damages, and costs as fixed in the MTC judgment
while the deposit covers the rent/reasonable cost
for the use and occupation of the premises that
accrue after the MTC judgment and until the final
judgment on appeal.
Failure to file the supersedeas bond will render
the MTC judgment immediately executory while the-'
failure to make the deposit (but with a supersedeas
bond posted) will render the MTC judgment executory
only as to the restoration of plaintiff’s possession.
The supersedeas bond is necessary to stay
execution even if the defendant vacates the
premises after the judgment while a periodic
deposit is not necessary if the defendant vacates
the premises. (S19 R70).

Q.

While the ejectment case was pending before
the Municipal Court, Juan Santos religiously
deposits all current rentals. In due time, the
judge ordered Juan Santos to pay all rents until
he vacates the premises as well as attorney’s
fees in the amount of P5,000. Maria Cruz moves
for immediate execution on the ground that
Juan Santos did not deposit the attorney’s fees
of P5,000 and that he did not post a
supersedeas bond for the award. Should the
court grant immediate execution? Decide with
reasons. (90 Bar Q3).

A.

No, the court should not grant immediate execution.
A supersedeas bond covers only the rents,
damages, and costs accruing down to the time of
the judgment appealed from. In other words, it does
not cover those that accrue after the judgment
appealed from.
Here Juan had been religiously depositing all
the current rentals during the pendency of the
ejectment case. Hence a supersedeas bond was
unnecessary notwithstanding the court’s order to
pay rentals. The court can simply order the
application of the deposit to the rentals in arrears.
As to the award of attorney’s fees, the same is
not required to be covered by a supersedeas bond.
(Once v. Gonzalez, 76 SCRA 258).

Q.

Judgment was rendered against defendant
Jaypee in an action for unlawful detainer. The
judgment ordered Jaypee to vacate and to pay
attorney's fees in favor of Bart, the plaintiff.

1050

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

To prevent the immediate execution of the
judgment, would you advise the posting of a
supersedeas bond as counsel for Jaypee?
Explain your answer briefly? (17 Bar Q12A).
A.

As counsel for Jaypee, I would advise him that the
posting of a supersedeas bond to prevent immediate
execution of the judgment is unnecessary.
A supersedeas bond is necessary to prevent
immediate execution only if the judgment awards
rents, damages, and costs in favor of the plaintiff.
Here the judgment against Jaypee did not
award any rents, damages, and costs. The
Supreme Court has held that attorney’s fees are
not covered by the supersedeas bond. (Once v.
Gonzalez, 76 SCRA 258, 261).

Q.

In an ejectment case, the MTC ordered Ellery to
vacate the nipa house standing on a residential
lot, restore possession thereof to Indit and pay
the sum of P340 as back rentals at the rate of
P20 per month. Ellery appealed to the RTC and
posted a suersedeas bond of P400. Subsequently,
Indit filed a motion in the RTC for the execution
of the judgment on the ground that Ellery had
not deposited the current rentals of P20 per
month. Ellery opposed the motion pointing out
that the MTC did not fix in its judgment the
monthly rental to be paid during his continued
stay in the premises so that he is not duty
bound to pay the same. Decide the motion for
execution filed by Indit. (89 Bar Q7[2]).

1051

REMEDIAL LAW

A.

Motion for execution granted insofar as the
restoration of Indit to the possession of the subject
premises is concerned.
in a case involving similar facts, the Supreme
Court held that there is no need for the MTC
judgment to specifically fix and order the payment
of rentals during the pendency of the appeal. What
the rules require merely is that “the amount of rent
due from time to time under the contract, if any,
[has been] determined by the judgment of the
Municipal Trial Court.”
Here the judgment determined that the amount
of rent due from time to time under the contract is
P20 per month. The fact that Ellery posted a
supersedeas bond is a commitment on his part to
deposit the current rentals of P20 per month.
(,Dehesa v. Maclalag, 81 SCRA 53 [1978]).

Q.

Plaintiff filed an unlawful detainer case against
the Defendant lessee. The MTC rendered a
judgment in favor of the Plaintiff ordering the
Defendant to vacate the premises and to pay
rentals and damages to the Plaintiff. Dissatisfied
with the amount of the rentals awarded, the
Plaintiff appealed to the RTC. Defendant did not
appeal nor did he post a supersedeas bond or
make the periodic deposits. May the Plaintiff
move for the immediate execution of the judgment
in his favor?

A.

Yes. The provisions of S19 R70 are applicable
even if the one who appeals is the plaintiff rather
than the defendant. The provision provides that “an
appeal has been perfected” without specifying who
perfected the appeal. The defendant in order to
1052

J9JC9B0M

Rule 70
Forcible Entry And Unlawful Detainer (Ejectment)

prevent immediate execution must post the
supersedeas bond and make the periodic deposit.
( See City o f Manila v. Court of Appeals, 149 SCRA
183 [1987]).
Q.

The Air Transportation Office filed a complaint
for unlawful detainer against Miaque. Judgment
was rendered in favor of the ATO ordering Miaque
to vacate the premises and to pay damages to the
ATO. On appeal the RTC affirmed. Miaque filed
a petition for review with the Court of Appeals
under R42 which was given due course by the
CA. The RTC issued a writ of execution to
enforce the judgment but the CA set aside the
order on the sole ground that that the RTC “has
no jurisdiction to order the issuance of [the]
writ of execution” because, when it (CA) gave
due course to the petition for review in CA-G.R.
SP No. 79439, the RTC was already divested of
jurisdiction over the case pursuant to the third
paragraph of S8(a), R42. Was the writ of
execution properly set aside by the CA?

A.

No. The Court of Appeals is mistaken. It disregards
both (1) the immediately executory nature of the
judgment of the RTC in ejectment cases under S21
R70, and (2) the rule that such judgment of the
RTC is not stayed by an appeal taken therefrom
under S8(b) R42. It ignores the nature of the RTC’s
function to issue a writ of execution of its judgment
in an ejectment case as ministerial and not
discretionary. (Air Transportation Office v. Court of
Appeals, 25 June 2014, Leonardo-De Castro, J.)

Q.

In the hearing on the motion for execution of an
unlawful detainer case decided in favor of the
Plaintiff, the Defendants raised the argument
that the writ of execution may no longer be
enforced because after the judgment was
rendered but before the writ of execution was
issued, they had acquired ownership over the
land subject of the ejectment case. May the writ
of execution be quashed on this ground?

A.

No. Defendant’s argument that they subsequently
acquired ownership of the subject property cannot
be considered as a supervening event that will bar
the execution, as unlawful detainer does not deal
with the issue of ownership. The issue of ownership
should be properly litigated in the appropriate
action, not in the hearing of a motion for execution
of the ejectment case. (Holy Trinity Realty v.
Abacan, 17 April 2013, Sereno, C.J.).

RULE 71. CONTEMPT
Q.

Define contempt.

A.

Contempt is the disobedience to the court by acting in
opposition to its authority, justice, and dignity.
{Regalado v. Go, G.R. No. 167988, 6 February 2007).

Q.

Briefly discuss the contempt power and the
reason for it.

A.

The power to punish for contempt is inherent in all
courts. Its existence is essential to the preservation
of order in judicial proceedings and to the
enforcement of judgments, orders and mandates of
the courts, and consequently to the due
administration of justice. The reason behind this
power to punish for contempt is that respect of the
courts guarantees the stability of their institution.
(JAIME R. NUEVAS, REMEDIAL LAW REVIEWER
321 [1964] citing Perkins v. Director of Prisons, 58
Phil. 271 and Cornejo v. Tan, 85 Phil. 772).

Q.

Does Rule 71 apply to contempt committed
against quasi-judicial bodies or entities?

A.

Yes. Rule 71 shall apply to contempt committed
against quasi-judicial bodies or entities, or it shall
have suppletory effect to such rules as they may
have adopted pursuant to authority granted to them
by law to punish for contempt. The RTC of the
place wherein the contempt has been committed
shall have jurisdiction over such charges as may be
filed therefor. (S12 R71).

1055

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

Q.

May persons, entities, bodies or agencies
exercising quasi-judicial functions have the
power to punish for contempt?

A.

Generally no since the contempt power is
essentially of a judicial nature. (Negros Oriental II
Electric Co-operative v. Sangguniang Panlungsod
of Dumaguete, G.R. No. 72492, 5 November 1987).
Such person or entity shall file the contempt charge
with the RTC of the place wherein the contempt
has been committed and it is the RTC which shall
have the power to punish (S12 R71).The law
however may expressly authorize the person or
entity exercising quasi-judicial functions to punish
for contempt as in Sec. 5(j) of the Securities
Regulation Code which empowers the Securities
and Exchange Commission to “[pjunish for contempt
of the Commission, both direct and indirect, in
accordance with the pertinent provisions of and
penalties prescribed by the Rules of Court.”

Q.

How is contempt classified under the Rules
of Court?

A.

Contempt is classified as either direct contempt or
indirect contempt.

Q.

What is the main distinction between direct
contempt and indirect contempt?

A.

Direct contempt is misbehavior in the presence of
or so near a court as to obstruct or interrupt
the court proceedings; any other disobedience,
disrespect or misbehavior not in the presence of or
so near a court is indirect contempt.

1056

J9JC9B0M

Rule 71
Contempt

Q.

Define direct contempt.

A.

As set forth in S1 R71, direct contempt is
misbehavior in the presence of or so near a court
as to obstruct or interrupt the proceedings
before the same, including: (FORD)
1)

Disrespect toward the court;

2)

Offensive personalities toward others, or

3)

Refusal to be sworn or to answer as a witness,
or to subscribe an affidavit or deposition when
lawfully required to do so. (S1 R71).

4)

Willful and deliberate forum shopping. (S5 R7).

Q.

What is the punishment for direct contempt?

A.

Fine not exceeding P2,000 or imprisonment not
exceeding 10 days or both, if it be a RTC or court of
equivalent or higher rank.
Fine not exceeding P200 or imprisonment not
exceeding 1 day, or both, if it be a MTC. (S1 R71).

Q.

Is a charge and hearing required before a
person may be punished for direct contempt?

A.

No. A person may be summarily adjudged in
contempt and punished by the court. (S1 R71).

Q.

May a person appeal from the order adjudging
him in direct contempt?

A.

No. The person adjudged in direct contempt may
not appeal therefrom, but may avail of the remedies
of certiorari or prohibition. The execution of the
judgment shall be suspended pending resolution of
such petition, provided such person files a bond
fixed by the court which rendered the judgment and
1057

J9JC9B0M

conditioned that he will abide by and perform the
judgment should the petition be decided against
him. (S2R71).
Q.

In filing a motion for reconsideration of a
decision of the Court of Tax Appeals, Attys. H
and M stated therein that “it was gross ignorance
of the law for the Honorable Court to have held
that it has no jurisdiction over this instant
petition.” Are Attys. H and M liable for direct
contempt?

A.

Yes. Rule 11.03 of the Code of Professional
Responsibility enjoins all attorneys to “abstain from
scandalous, offensive or menacing language or
behavior before the Courts.” While a lawyer may
criticize a court’s decision in properly respectful
terms, he should refrain from offensive language.
(Habawel v. CTA, 7 September 2011, Bersamin, J.).

Q.

What acts constitute indirect contempt?

A.

A person guilty of any of the following acts may be
punished for indirect contempt: (MAIDS FAR)
a)

Misbehavior of an officer of the court in the
performance of his official duties or in his
official transactions;

b) Disobedience of or resistance to a lawful writ,
process, order, or judgment of a court,
including the act of a person who, after being
dispossessed or ejected from any real property
by the judgment or process of any court of
competent jurisdiction, enters or attempts or
induces another to enter into or upon such real
property, for the purpose of executing acts of
ownership or possession, or in any manner
1058

J9JC9B0M

Rule 71
Contempt

disturbs the possession given to the person
adjudged to be entitled thereto;
c)

Any abuse of or any unlawful interference with
the process or proceedings of a court not
constituting direct contempt;

d)

Any improper conduct tending, directly or
indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the
administration of justice;

e)

Assuming to be an attorney or an officer of a
court, and acting as such without authority;

f)

Failure to obey a subpoena duly served; and

g)

The rescue, or attempted rescue, of a person
or property in the custody of an officer by virtue
of an order or process of a court held by him.
(S3 R71).

h)

Submission of a false certification against
forum-shopping or non-compliance with any of
the undertakings therein. (S5 R7).

Q.

May a person be summarily adjudged in indirect
contempt?

A.

No. There must be a charge in writing filed, an
opportunity given to the respondent to comment
thereon within such period as may be fixed by
the court and to be jieard by himself or counsel.
(S3R71) (CCH)

Q.

Before the respondent has been given the
opportunity to comment and before the hearing,
may the court issue a bench warrant to arrest
the respondent and bring him to court?

1059

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

A.

Yes. Nothing in S3 R71 shall be so construed as to
prevent the court from issuing process to bring the
respondent into court, or from holding him in
custody pending such proceedings. (S3 R71).

Q.

P filed an action for recovery of possession of
land against D. The RTC decided in favor of P and
after the judgment had become final and
executory the RTC, upon P’s motion, issued a
writ of execution directing the sheriff to place P in
possession of the subject land. When the sheriff
tried to evict D from the land, the latter refused to
do so. May the RTC hold D in indirect contempt?

A.

No. The writ was not directed to D but to the sheriff
who was directed to deliver the property to P. As
the writ did not command the judgment debtor to do
anything, he cannot be guilty of the acts described
in Rule 71 which is “disobedience of or resistance
to a lawful writ, process, order, judgment, or
command of any court.” The proper procedure is for
the sheriff to oust D availing of the assistance of
peace officers pursuant to Section 10(c) of Rule 39.
(.Lipata v. Tutaan, L-16643, 29 September 1983).

Q.

A writ of execution was served by a sheriff upon
defendant so that plaintiff may be placed in
possession of the property held by the former.
The defendant refused to vacate and surrender
the premises to plaintiff. Can defendant be held
for indirect contempt for disobedience of, or
resistance to a lawful writ issued by the court?
Explain. (95 Bar Q5[2]).

A.

No. The writ was not directed to the defendant but
to the sheriff who was directed to deliver the
property to the plaintiff. As the writ did not command
1060

J9JC9B0M

Rule 71
Contempt

the judgment debtor to do anything, he cannot be
guilty of the acts described in Rule 71 which is
“disobedience of or resistance to a lawful writ,
process, order, judgment, or command of any
court.” The proper procedure is for the sheriff to
oust the defendant availing of the assistance of
peace officers pursuant to Section 10(c) of Rule 39.
(Lipata v. Tutaan, L-16643, 29 September 1983).
Q.

Suppose that by virtue of an execution of the
judgment in an ejectment case, defendant was
successfully ousted from the property in
litigation and the plaintiff was lawfully placed in
possession thereof, but seven years later
defendant re-entered the property and forcibly
took over possession, can plaintiff move that
defendant be declared in indirect contempt? (95
Bar Q5[3])

A

Yes the plaintiff can move that defendant be
declared in indirect contempt.
Under Section 3(b) of Rule 70, a person who
after being dispossessed or ejected from any real
property by the judgment or process of any court of
competent jurisdiction, enters or attempts or
induces another to enter into or upon such real
property, for the purpose of executing acts of
ownership or possession, or in any manner disturbs
the possession given to the person adjudged to be
entitled thereto is liable for indirect contempt.
Here defendant was ejected by a lawful writ
yet he re-entered the subject real property and
executed acts of possession. Hence he can be
declared in indirect contempt.

Q.

Nancio is a driver of the Chief of the Business
Permit Division of Makati City. One morning
finding that the parking slot for his boss was
occupied by another car, Nancio looked for
another parking space and parked his car in a
vacant parking slot. Unbeknownst to Nancio, the
parking slot belonged to Makati RTC Judge
Frank. Judge Frank found his parking slot
occupied and because he had to spend a lot of
time looking for a parking space, his promulgation
of decisions was delayed. Judge Frank issued a
show-cause order to Nancio to explain why he
should not be cited for indirect contempt for
“improper conduct tending, directly or indirectly,
to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration
of justice.” Finding Nancio’s explanation
unsatisfactory, Judge Frank ordered Nancio to
pay a fine of P1,000 and to be imprisoned.
a) Was Judge Frank’s order finding Nancio
liable for indirect contempt proper?
b) Would your answer be different if there was
a showing that Nancio knew that the
parking slot belonged to Judge Frank?

a)

No. The phrase “improper conduct tending,
directly or indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or
degrade the administration of justice,” is so
broad and general that it encompasses a wide
spectrum of acts that could constitute indirect
contempt. However the act of Nancio in parking
his car in the judge’s parking slot does not fall
under this category. There was no showing that
Nancio acted with malice or bad faith or that he
1062

J9JC9B0M

Rule 71

was improperly motivated to delay the
proceedings of the court by parking in Judge
Frank’s slot. We cannot also say that Nancio’s
act constitutes disrespect to the dignity of the
court. (Inonog v. Ibay, A M . No. RTJ-09-2715,
28 July 2009).
b)

Q.

No, my answer would not be different. While
Nancio’s act was improper, in the absence of a
showing that his motivation in parking in Judge
Frank’s slot was to delay the court proceedings,
his act would not constitute indirect contempt.

Does the NBI Deputy Director have the

b)

May the NBI hold Andrew in indirect contempt
for his refusal to obey the subpoena?

c)

May the NBI successfully file a verified
petition for indirect contempt against Andrew
for his refusal to obey the subpoena?

a)

Yes. The NBI has the power to issue subpoena
for the appearance of any person for
investigation or production of documents,
through its officers from the ranks of Regional
Director to Director. (Sec. 4[b], R.A. 10867).
1063

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

b)

No. The NBI is neither a court nor has it been
conferred contempt powers by law.

c)

No. A person who refuses to obey a subpoena
duly served may be held liable for indirect
contempt if the subpoena was issued by a court
or a person or body exercising quasi-judicial
powers. (S4 & 12 R71). The NBI is neither a
court or a body exercising quasi-judicial powers.

Q.

How are proceedings for indirect contempt
commenced?

A.

SHOW-CAUSE ORDER. Proceedings for indirect
contempt may be initiated motu proprio by the court
against which the contempt was committed by an
order or any other formal charge requiring the
respondent to show cause why he should not be
punished for contempt.
VERIFIED PETITION. In all other cases,
charges for indirect contempt shall be commenced
by a verified petition with supporting particulars and
certified true copies of documents or papers
involved therein, and upon full compliance with the
requirements for filing initiatory pleadings for civil
actions in the court concerned.

Q.

If the contempt charges in the verified petition
arose out of or are related to a principal action
pending in court, will the petition be tried
separately?

A.

If the contempt charges arose out of or are related
to a principal action pending in the court, the
petition for contempt shall allege that fact but said
petition shall be docketed, heard, and decided

1064

Rule 71

separately, unless the court in its discretion orders
the consolidation of the contempt charge and
the principal action for joint hearing and decision.
(S4 R71).
Q.

When the indirect contempt proceedings are
commenced by a show-cause order issued
motu proprio by the court, may such
proceedings be docketed and heard separately
from the main case?

A.

No. When the court issues motu proprio a showcause order, the duty of the court under S4 R71 (1)
to docket and (2) to hear and decide the case
separately from the main case does not arise, much
less to exercise the discretion (3) to order the
consolidation of the cases. There is no petition from
any party to be docketed, heard and decided
separately from the main case precisely because it
is the show-cause order that initiated the
proceedings. (Baculi v. Belen, 24 September 2012,
Velasco, J.).

Q.

Union Bank filed with the RTC of Pasay City a
case against the Spouses Tamondong to collect
on an unpaid motor vehicle loan, with prayer for
the issuance of a writ of replevin. The case was
dismissed for failure to prosecute, reinstated
upon Union Bank’s motion for reconsideration,
and dismissed again for failure to prosecute.
Union Bank filed another case to collect on
the same loan this time before the MTC of Pasay
City. Upon Union Bank’s application, the
Tamondong’s motor vehicle was seized under a
writ of replevin. The Spouses Tamondong filed
motions to dismiss the case, to set aside the writ
1065

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

of replevin, and to cite for contempt the counsel
of Union Bank for forum-shopping. The MTC
issued an order dismissing the case, recalling
the writ of replevin, and ordering Union Bank
and its counsel to immediately return the vehicle
to the Spouses Tamondong. Union Bank did not
return the vehicle. The Spouses Tamondong
filed an unverified motion to cite Union Bank and
its counsel for indirect contempt for failing to
return the replevied motor vehicle.
Upon Union Bank’s failure to forthwith
return the vehicle, the MTC issued an order for
Union Bank and its counsel to show cause why
they should not be cited for contempt for failing
to return the vehicle. Union Bank submitted a
reply questioning the manner in which the
contempt proceedings were initiated but continued
to keep the vehicle. The MTC thus cited Union
Bank’s counsel, Atty. Leonidas, for indirect
contempt. Atty. Leonidas filed an administrative
case against Judge Supnet for not following the
proper procedure In citing him for indirect
contempt. The Office of the Court Administrator
agreed with Atty, Leonidas saying that the
indirect contempt proceedings were not initiated
by Judge Supnet motu proprio but upon mere
motions of the Tamondongs. The OCA
recommended that Judge Supnet be sanctioned
for improperly citing Union Bank’s counsel in
indirect contempt. Was the OCA’s recommendation
correct? Explain.
A.

No, the OCA’s recommendation was not correct.
Under 84 R71, indirect contempt proceedings
may be initiated motu proprio by the court by an
1066

J9JC9B0M

Rule 71
Contempt

order or any other formal charge requiring the
respondent to show cause why he should not be
cited for contempt.
Disobedience to the MTC’s order for the return
of the vehicle qualifies as indirect contempt for
which the MTC properly issued a show-cause order
to Union Bank. The show-cause order was a
legitimate exercise of the MTC’s judicial discretion
to determine whether Union Bank should
be sanctioned for discregarding its order. Thus
independently of the motions filed by the Tamondong
spouses, it was the Pasay MTC which commenced
the contempt proceedings motu proprio. No verified
petition is required if the contempt proceedings are
initiated in this manner. (Leonidas v. Judge Supnet,
A.M. No. MTJ-02-1433, 21 February 2003).
Q.

In a certiorari case before the Court of Appeals
seeking the review of the NLRC decision, Atty.
Regalado acted as counsel for the employer.
Subsequently a compromise agreement was
entered into between the employer and the
employee Go. The compromise agreement was
entered into without the knowledge and participation
of Go’s counsel. Subsequently Go, through
counsel, filed a manifestation with omnibus
motion wherein Go, inter alia, asked that Atty.
Regalado be asked to explain why no
disciplinary action should be taken against her
for negotiating directly with Go without the
presence of his counsel. The Court of Appeals
issued an order asking Atty. Regalado to show
cause why she should not be cited in contempt
for violating Canon 9 of the Canons of
Professional Ethics. Finding Atty. Regalado’s
explanation unsatisfactory, the Court of Appeals
1067

4

J9JC9B0M

PRIMER-REVIEWER ON
REMEDIAL LAW

issued a resolution holding Atty. Regalado
guilty of indirect contempt. May Atty. Regalado’s
conviction for indirect contempt be set aside?
A.

Yes for lack of jurisdiction on the part of the CA to
issue the resolution.
Under S4 R71, if the contempt proceedings
are not initiated motu proprio by the court against
which the contempt was committed, the charge for
indirect contempt shall be commenced by a verified
petition upon full compliance with the requirements
for filing initiatory pleadings for civil actions.
Here it was Go who brought to the attention of
the CA the alleged misbehaviour of Atty. Regalado
through the filing of the manifestation with omnibus
motion. Without such positive act on the part of Go,
no indirect contempt charge could have been
initiated at all. Hence the filing of a verified petition
was mandatory and the absence of such meant that
the CA did not acquire jurisdiction over the special
civil action for contempt against Atty. Regalado.
The Supreme Court distinguished the instant
case from Leonidas v. Judge Supnet, supra, where
there was an utter violation of the court’s order
requiring Union Bank to return the seized chattel
and where independently of the motions filed by the
Tamondongs, it was the Pasay MTC which
commenced the contempt proceedings motu proprio.
(Regalado v. Go, G.R. No. 167988, 6 February 2007).

S11 R71. (S5 R71).

3)

If committed against a person or body
exercising quasi-judicial powers, the RTC of the
place wherein the contempt has been
committed shall have jurisdiction over such
charges. (S12R71).

The spouses Nicolas filed a case against the
spouses Rodriguez for the latter’s closure of a
subdivision road lot. The HLURB ruled in favor of
the spouses Nicolas. The spouses Rodriguez
sought to set aside the HLURB’s decision by way
of a petition for certiorari with the Court of
Appeals. The CA dismissed the petition and the
spouses Rodriguez appealed to the Supreme
Court by way of a petition for review on certiorari
under R45. In the SC, the spouses Nicolas filed a
Petition for Indirect Contempt against the spouses
Rodriguez, alleging that "despite vigorous
protestation on the part of the spouses Nicolas,
and after having been warned of the existence of
the Cease and Desist Order issued by the
HLURB, the spouses Rodriguez, in complete

defiance of the injunction issued by the HLURB
continuously, maliciously and feloniously dumped
filling materials that would ultimately block the
road lot leading to the inner lots of the
subdivision.” May the SC act on the petition for
indirect contempt?
A.

No, the SC may not act on the petition and should
dismiss it. Just because the decision of a quasi­
judicial body is pending appeal before the SC does
not mean that the SC has jurisdiction over a petition
for indirect contempt committed against the quasi­
judicial body. S12 R71 states that with respect to
contumacious acts committed against quasi-judicial
bodies such as the HLURB, it is the regional trial
court of the place where the contemptuous acts
have been committed that acquires jurisdiction over
the indirect contempt case. (Rodriguez v. HLURB,
19 June 2019, Caguioa, J.).

Q.

May the respondent in indirect contempt held in
custody be released on bail?

A.

Yes. If the hearing is, not ordered to be had
forthwith, the respondent may be released from
custody upon filing a bond, in an amount fixed by
the court, for his appearance at the hearing of the
charge. (S6R71).

Q.

What is the punishment for indirect contempt?

A.

In indirect contempt against a RTC or a court of
equivalent or higher rank, fine not exceeding
P30,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months,
or both.

1070

J9JC9B0M

Rule 71
Contempt

If indirect contempt against a MTC, fine not
exceeding P5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 1
month, or both. (S7R71).
Q.

May a writ of execution issue for the
enforcement of a judgment imposing a fine?

A.

Yes, a writ of execution, as in ordinary civil actions,
shall issue for the enforcement of a judgment
imposing a fine unless the court otherwise
provides. (S7R71).

Q.

May the penalty of imprisonment exceed 6
months?

A.

Yes. When the contempt consists in the refusal or
omission to do an act which is yet in the power of
the respondent to perform, he may be imprisoned
by order of the court concerned until he performs it.
(S8R71).

Q.

May the judgment of a court adjudging the
respondent guilty of indirect contempt be
appealed?

A.

Yes, the judgment of a court in a case of indirect
contempt may be appealed to the proper court as in
criminal cases. (S11 R71).

Q.

May the judgment of the court finding that the
respondent is not guilty of indirect contempt be
appealed?

A.

No. The judgment of the court finding that the
respondent is not guilty of indirect contempt may
not be appealed; otherwise double jeopardy would
result. (Santiago v. Anuncianon, 84 SCRA 118).

Q.

Will the appeal suspend the execution of the
judgment or final order?

A.

No, unless a bond is filed by the person adjudged
in contempt, in an amount fixed by the court from
which the appeal is taken, conditioned that if the
appeal be decided against him, he will abide by and
perform the judgment or final order. (S11 R71).
