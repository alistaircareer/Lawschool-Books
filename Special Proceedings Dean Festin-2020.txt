its debts when they fall due . It is surn~ar y and non-adv ersarial in
nature. Its end goal is to secure the approva l of a rehabili tation plan
to facilitat e the successf ul recovery of the corporat e debtor. It does
not seek relief from an injury caused by another party. (Golden Cane

No. 198222, April 4, 2016, Brion, J .)

1.06 IS LIQUIDATION PROCE ED/NGA SPECIA L PROCEEDING?
A petition for liquidat ion of an insolven t corporat ion should be
classifie d as a special proceed ing and not as an ordiniry action. Such
petition does not seek the enforce ment or protecti on of a right nor
the prevent ion or redress of a wrong against a p¢y. It does not pray
for a ffirmati ve relief for injury arising from a party's wrongfu l act
or omissio n nor state a cause of action that can be enforced against
any person. (Pacific Banking Corpora tion Employ ees Organiz ation

The followin g are the distincti ons:
A special proceed ing under the same rule provide s that it
is a reme,dy by which a party seeks to establis h a s tatus, a
right or a particul ar fact. Pursuan t to Section 3,,:n .Ie I of
the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedu re, a civil actin!' · .- ,ne by
which a party sues another for the enforce ment u " i-Jl'U i.ection of a right, or the prevent ion or redress of a wr ong.

1.05 IS ARBITR ATION A SPECIA L PROCE EDING?
Arbitrat ion is deemed a special proceedi a.g and governe d by
the special provisio ns of R.A. No. 9285, its ffiR , and the Special ADR
Rules. R.A. No. 9285 is the general law applicab le to all matters and
controv ersies to be resolved through alternat ive dispute resolutio n
methods .
Well-se ttled is the rule that procedu ral laws are construe d to
be applicab le to actions pending and undeter mined at the time of
their passage , and are d~emed retroact ive in that sense and to that
extent. (DFA u. BCA Internat ional Corpora tion, C.R. No. 210858,
June 29, 2016, Carpio, J.)

No, the list of enumer ation is not exclusiv e. Any petition which
has ~or its main purpose the establis hment of a status, right or a
part~c~ ar fact may be included as special pr,p ceeding. An example
of this 1s a petition for declarat ion of nullity of marriag e. It seeks to
establis h a status, a right, or a particul ar fact.

On July 4, 2007, Gina filed a p~tition with the RTC of
Manila to declare Frank preswnpt1vely dead, so that she
could marry Willie. The RTC granted Gina's ~etition. The
Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed a Notice of Appeal
with the RTC, stating that it was appealing the decision to
the Court of Appeals on questions of fact and law.
Is a petition for Declaration of Preswnptive Death a
special proceeding? Why or why not?

SUGGESTED ANSWER:
A petition for declaration of presumptive dellth is not included
in the en um era tions falling as a subject matter of a special proceeding
under Section 1 of Rule 72. Such petition under Article 41 of the
Family Code is a summary proceeding for the purpose of remarriage
of the present spouse.

However, it is in a nature of a special proceeding because it is
,.
an application that seeks to establish a status or a particular fact.

1.09 IS A PROCEEDING BEFORE THE SHARI' A DISTRICT COURT
AGAINST A DECEASED PERSON AN ORDINARY CIVIL
ACTION OR A SPECIAL PROCEEDING?

A proceeding before the Shari'a District Court for the settlement
of the estate is deemed a special proceeding.

MONTANER v. SHARI'A DISTRICT COURT
G.R. No. 174975, January 20, 2009
DOCTRINE: The co·u:rt reiterates that the proceedings before
the court a quo are /on.the issuance of letters of administration,
settlement, and distribution of the estate of the deceased,
which is a special proceeding. Section 3(c) of the Rules of Court
(Rules) defines a special proceeding as "a remedy by which

a party seeks to eatabli8h a status, a right, or a particular
fact:'' Thia Court has applied the Rules, particularly the rules
on special proceedings, for the settlement of the estate of a
decea11ed Muslim.
FACTS:

In May 1995, Alejandro Montaiier, Sr. died leaving
petitioners Luisa Kho, his wife, and his three children
as heirs to his estate. Five years later. a complaint for
judicial partition of properties of Alejamdro, Sr. was filed
before the Shari'a District Court by Liling Disangcopan
and Almahleen Llling S. Montaner, who claimed that
Alejandro, Sr. was a Muslim and that they were his first
family.
Petitioners filed a Motion to Dismiss the complaint on the
ground of lack of jurisdiction of the Shari'a Court, alleging
that the decedent,was a Roman Catholic. They also argued
that the proceeding before the district court is an ordinary
civil action against a deceased person. Said court dismissed
the complaint, holding that the deceased was not a Muslim
and the court's jurisdiction extends only to settlement of
estate of deceased Muslims.
Private respondent Liling filed a M~tion for Re'consideration
which was granted by the Shari'a District Court. It
reconsidered its dismissal and allowed Mie respondents to
adduce further evidence. Later, it ordered the continuation
of the trial on merits . This was questioned by the petitioners.

ISSUE: Whether or not the complaint.filed by the respondents
in the Shari'a District Court for the settlement of the estate is
an ordinary civil action.
RULING: The complaint filed by the respondents before the Shari'a
District Court for the settlement of the estate is a special pro.eeding.
The underlying assumption in petitioners' argument that the
proceeding before the Shari'a District Court is an ordinary civil action
against a deceased person, rests on an erroneous understanding of
the proceeding before the court a quo. Part of the confusion may be
attributed to the proceeding before the Shari'a District Court where
the parties were designated either as plaintiffs or defendants and
the case was denominated as a special civil action.

6

.
SPECIAL PROCEED INGS .
(A Foresight to the Bar Exnm and the Practice of Law➔

The Court reiterate s that the proceed ings before the court a
quo are for the issuance of letters of admJnis tration, settleme nt,
and distribu tion of the estate of the decease d, which is a speciaJ
proceed ing. Section 3(c) of the Rules of Court (Rules) defines a special
proceed ing as "a remedy by which a party seeks to establis h a status,
a right, or a particul ar fact. " This Court has applied the Rules,
particul arly the rules on special proceed ings, for the settlem ent of
the estate of a decease d Muslim .
In a petition for the issuance of letters of adminis tration,
settlem ent, and distribu tion of estate, the apph1:ants seek to establis h
the fact of death of the deceden t and later to be duly recogniz ed
as among the deceden ,t's heirs, ;hich would allow them to exercise
their right to particip ate in the settlem ent and liquidat ion of the
estate of the deceden t. Here, the respond ents seek to establis h
the fact of Alejand ro Montan. er, Sr.'s death and, subsequ ently, for
private respond ent Almahle en Liling S. Montan. er to be recogniz ed
as among his heirs, if such is the case in fact.
As a special procee ding, the purpos e of the settlem ent of
the estate of the decede nt is to determ ine all the assets of the
estate, pay its liabilit ies, and distrib ute the residue to those
entitle d to the sai:ne.
1.10 DOES A SPECIA L PROCE EDING HAVE A DEFINIT E ADVER SE
PARTY?

Unlike a civil action which has definite adverse parties,
a special procee ding has no definite adverse party.
MONTA NER v. SHARI 'A DISTR ICT COURT
G.R. No. 174975, Januar y 20, 2009
DOCTR INE: The prohib ition agains t a decede nt O i' his estate
from being a party defenda ri,t in an ordina ry civil action does
not apply tp a special procee ding such as the settlem ent of the
estate of the decease d.
The definitio ._ns of a civil action and a special procee ding,
respect ively, ih _f1, e Rules illustra te this differen ce. A civil
action, in which ·"a party sues anothe r for the enforce ment
or protect ion of a right, or the preven tion or redress of a
w_rong" neces~a ~ily has definite adverse parties , who are
either t~e pl~mtz ff_or defend ant. On the other hand, a sp'e cial
procee ding, by which a party seeks to establi sh a status, right,

Rule 7 2 -

C HAPTER 1 - GENERA L PROVISIO N

lJr a particu lar fact," has one definite party, who petition a or
applies for a declara tion of a status, right, or particu lar fac4
but no definite adverse party.
lt bears emphas is that the estate of the deceden t u, not
being sued for any cause of action. As a special proceed ing,
the purpos e of the settlem ent of the estate of the deceden t u, to
determ ine all the assets of the estate, pay its liabiliti es, and to
distrib ute the residua l to those ent-itle d to the same.
1.11 SHOUL D THE DETERM INATION OF THE LEGAL HEIRS OF
THE DECEASED PERSON BE MADE IN THE SPECIAL PRO~
CEEDIN GS?
Yes, the Court has consiste ntly ruled that the trial court cannot
make a declara,t ion of heirship in the civil action for the reason that
such a declarat ion can only be made in a special proceed ing.

An ordinary civil action is differen t from a special proceed ing.
Under Section 3, Rule 1 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Court.. a
civil action is -defined as one by which a party sues another for the
enforce ment or protecti on of a right, or the prevent ion or redress of a
wrong while a special proceed ing is a remedy by which a party seeks
to establis h a status, right, or a particu lar fact. ,
It is then decisiv ely clear that the declara tion ofheirs hip
can be made only in a special procee qing inasmu ch as the
petitio ners here are seekin g the establi shmen t of a status or
right. (Heirs of Teofilo Gabata n v. CA and Lourdes Evero Pacana,
G.R. No . 150206, March 13, 2009)
1.12 IS THERE AN EXCEP TION TO THE RULE ON THE NEED TO
INSTITU TE A SEPAR ATE PROCE EDING FOR THE DETER MINATION OF HEIRSH IP?
By way of exceptio n, the need to institut e a seJ>arat e special
proceed ing for the determi nation of l:eirship may be dispens ed with
for the sake of practica lity, as. when the parties in the civil case
had volunta rily submitt ed the issue to the trial court and already
present ed their evidenc e regardi ng the issue of heirship , and the
RTC had consequ ently rendere d judgme nt thereon , or when a
special proceed ing had been institut ed but had been finally closed
and termina ted, and hence, can.not be re-open ed. (Heirs of Ypon v.
Ricafor te, G.R. No . 198680, July 8, 2013)

Rul e 73 - Subject of Estate. of Deceased Persons

CHAPTER2
RULE 73
SUBJECT OF ESTATE OF DECEASED PERSONS
(BAR QUESTIONS: 2003, 2005)
1.00 EXPLAIN SPECIAL . PROCEEDING RELATIVE TO THE
SETTLEMENT OF ESTATE OF DECEASED PERSON.
Special proceeding relative to the settlemen t of the estate of
a ·deceased person may either be testate or intestate. Where the
deceased person left no will, the proceeding shall be intestate and
where there is a will, the proceeding is testate. In which case, the
probate of a will is mandatory. The same takes precedence over
intestate proceedings. This being so, the institutio n of intestate
proceeding in another place may not proceed while the probate of a
purporte d will of the deceased is pending in another place.
1.01 "WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE SETTLEMENT OF ESTATE
PROCEEDINGS?

The settleme nt of a decedent's estate is a proceeding in ;em
which is binding against the whole world. All persons having
interest in the subject matter involved, whether they were pnf · 9ed
or not, are equally bound. (Philippine Savings Bank u. Lantin, _;;:,""
SCRA 483)
1.02 WHEN MUST THE CLAIMS AGAINST THE DECEASED PERSONS BE F.ILED? .

Claims against . deceased persons should be filed during
the settleme nt proceel:'Li.ngs of their estate. Such proceedings are
primarily governed by--:_§Pecial rules found under Rules 73 to 90 of
the Rules, although rules governing ordinary actions may, as far
as practicable, apply suppletorily. (Heirs of the Late Sps. Flauiano
Maglasang and Salud Adaza-Maglasang, et al. v. Manila Banking
Corporation, G.R. No. 171206, September 23, 2013)
14

1.03 WHICH COURT HAS JURISDICTION OVER PROBATE PROCEEDING?
Pursuant to RA No. 7691 , the question as to which court shall
exercise jurisdiction over probate proceedings depends upon the
gross value of the estate of the decedent. ·

In Metro Manila, the Municipal Trial Court has jurisdiction
on the said proceeding if the value of the estate does not exceed

P400,000.00, otherwise, the Regional Trial Court has jurisdiction
over the same.
Outside Metro Manila , Municipal. Trial Courts, Metropolitan
Trial Courts and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts have jurisdiction
over probate proceedings if the gross value of the estate left by the
decedent does n~t exceed P300,000 .00 beginning April 16, 2004
(before the said date, it was P200,000 .00).
1.04 WHAT DETERMINES VENUE IN THE SETTLEMENT OF ESTATE PROCEEDING?
Pursuant to Rule 73, Section 1, residence of the decedent at the
time of his death is determin ative of the venue of t~e proceeding.

It is only where the decedent was a non-resident of the
Philippines at the time of his death that venue lies in any province
•
in which he had estate.
1.05 WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THE WORD "RESIDES" WITHIN
THE CONTEXT OF VENUE?

"Resides" should be viewed or understo od in its popular sense,
meaning , the personal, actual or physical habitatio n of a person,
actual residence of place of abode. It signifies physical presence in a
place and actual stay thereat. In this popular sense, the t9rm means
merely residence , that is, personal residence, not legal residence or
domicile. Residence simply requires bodily presence as an inhabitan t
in a given place, while domicile requires bodily presence in that
particula r place and also an intention to make one's domicile. No
particula r length of time of residence is required though; however,
the residence must be more than temporary. (Garcia Fule v. CA, 74
S CRA 189)
Venue for ordinary civil actions and that for special proceedings
have one and the same meaning . As thus defined, "residence," in the
context of venue provisions, means nothing more than a person's

estate of deceased person.

Venue is in Bulacan as A- is a resident of Malolos, Bulacan at the
time of his death .
NOTE: The determination of which court exercises jurisdiction
over matters of probate depends upon the gross value of the estate
of the decedent. R.A. No. 7691 provides that a municipal court has
exclusive original jurisdiction over probate proceedings, where the
value of the estate does not exceed P200,000.00 in places other than
Metro Manila (beginning April 16, 2004 however, ~e jurisdictional
amount other than in Metro Manila is adjusted to P300,000.00) .

SUGGESTE D ANSWER:

1.08 CAN A PROBATE COURT ISSUE WRITS OF EXECUTION?

Rule 73 of the Rules or'Court expressly declares tliat if the
decedent is an inhabitant of the Philippines at the time of his death,
whether a citizen or an alien, his will shall be proved, or letters
of a~stratio ii granted, and his estate s~ttled, in the Regional
Trial Court in the province in which he resides at the time of his
death, and if he is an inhabitant of a-foreign country, the Regional
Trial Court of any province in which he had estate. The court first
taking cognizance of the settlement of the estate of the decedent,
shall exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other courts.

No. As a general mle, a probate court cannot issue writs of
execution because its orders usually refer to the adjudication of
claims against the estate which the executor or administrato r may
satisfy without the need of e,xecutor processes.

continuity and consistency. (Quiazon v. Belen., G.R. No. 189121, July

SUGGESTE D ANSWER:

The Municipal Trial Court of Malolos, Bulacan has jurisdiction
of the probate proceeding on the estate of A taking into account
the amount of the estate involved valued at P200,000.00 . (Sec. 33,
B.P. Blg. 129 as amended, Sec. 1, Rules of Court and R .A. No . 7691)

1.09 BY WAY OF EXCEPTIONS, WHEN MAY A PROBATE COURT
ISSUE WRITS OF EXECUTION?

The court may issue writs of execution on the following:
1.

To satisfy the contributive shares of the devisj!es, legatees
and heirs on possession of the decedent's assets as laid
down in Rule 88, Section 6;

2.

To enforce payment of the expenses of partition under
Rule 90, Section 3;

3.

To satisfy the cost when a pers~n is cited for examination
in probate proceedings under Rule 142, Section 13.

2.00 FOR PURPOSES OF SETTLEMENT OF THE ESTATE OF DECEASED PERSON, WHAT DOES SECTION 4, RULE 73 OF
.,
THE RULES OF COURT STATE?

The said rule speaks about presumptive death for purposes of
settlement of the estate. It states:
"For purposes of settlemen t of his estate, a p erson
shall be presumed dead il absent and unheard from for
the periods fixed in the Civil Code. But if such person
proves to be alive, he shall be entitled to the balance of his
estate aiter pay ment of all his debts. The balance may be
reco vered by motion in the same proceeding."

2.02 WHAT ARE THE POSSIBL E CONSEQ UENCES IF, IN THE
COURSE OF INTESTATE PROCEED ING, A WILL IS LATER DISCOVERED ?

2.01 FOR PURPOSE S OF SUCCESSIO"", WHAT ARE THE INSTANCES AS TO WHEN THE PRESUM PTION OF DEATH
SHALL ARISE?

The following are the possible conseque nces, to wit:
Whether the intestate proceedin g already coma.
menced should be dis'conti nued and a new proceedi ng under a separate number and title should be constitu ted is
entirely a matter of form and lies within th'e sound discretio n
of the court. In no matter does it prejudice the substanti al
rights of any of the heirs or creditors. (Reynoso v. Santiago, 85
Phil. 268, 270)
It has been held that the probate of the will is
b.
mandator y. It is anomalou s that the estate of a person who died
testate should be settled in an intestate proceedin g. Therefore ,
the intestate case should be consolid ated with the testate
proceedi ng and the judge assigned to the testate proceedin g
should continue hearing the two cases. (Roberts v. Leonidas ,
129 SCRA 33)
If in the course of the intestate proceedin gs, it is
c.
found that the decedent had left a 1a-st will, proceedi ngs for
the probate of the latter should replaci the intestate
. proceed ings even if at that stage, an fltlminist rator had
already been appointed , the latter being •equired to render a
final account and turn over the estate in his possessio n to the
executor subseque ntly appointe d. This, however, is understoo d
to be without prejudice that the proceedin g shall continue as
a n intestacy . (Uriate v. CFI of Negros, 33 SCRA 252, 259)
However , the mere discovery of a documen t purportin g to be
the last will and testamen t of the decedent after appointm ent of
an administ rator and assumpti on that the decedent died intestate
does not, however, ipso facto nullify the letters of administ ration
already issued or even authorize their revocatio n until the will has
been proved and allowed. (Advincu la v. Teodoro, 99 Phil. 413)

The period of absence as fixed by the Civil Code are the
following:
a.

Article 390 provides :

"After an absence of seven years, it being unknown
whether or not the absentee still lives, he shalrbe presumed
dead for all purposes, except for fuccession .
The absentee shall not be presumed dead -for the
purpose of opening his succession till after an absence
o/ t~n years. If he disappear s after the age of seventy-fi ve
years, an absence of five years shall be sufficient in order
that his successio n may be opened."

~

b.

Articie 391 provides :

''The following shall be presumed dead for all
purposes , including the division of the estate among the
heirs:
A person on board a vessel lost during a
1.
sea voyage, or an aeroplane which is missing, who
has not been heard of for four years since the loss of
the vessel or aeroplane ;
A person in the armed forces who h as taken
2.
part in war, and has been missing for four years;
A person who has been in danger of deat h
3.
under other circumsta nces and his existence has ,wt
been known for four years."

c.

Article 392 provides :

'7f the abs$tee appears, or without appearin g his
existence is prove,rf,, he shall recover his property in the
condition in whiC'h· it may be found, and the price of any
property that may have been alienated or the property
acquired therewith ; but he cannot claim either fruits or
rent."

FACTS:

The term "resides" connotes ex vi termini "actual residence" as
distinguished from ''legal residence or domicile.'' The term ''resides,"
like the terms "residing" and "residence," is elastic and should be
~terp~ete_d ~ the light of the object or purpose of the stat13te or rule
m which 1t 1s employed. In the application of venue statutes and
rules - Section 1, Rule 73 of the Revised Rules of Court is of such
nature - residence rather than domicile is the significant factor.

Even when the statute uses the word "domicile" still it is
construed to mean residence and not domicile in the technical ~ense.

SALUDO, JR. v. AMERICAN EXPRESS
G.R. No. 159507, April 19, 2006
DOCTRIN E: Secti'on 1, Rule 73 of the Revised Rules of Court
s.tates that residence rather than domicile is the significan t
factor in determin ing venue.

FACTS:
Aniceto G. Saludo, ·Jr. filed a complaint for damages against
AMEX and/or its officers with the RTC of Maasin City,
Southern Leyte. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that
plaintiff (herein petitioner Saludo) "is a Filipino citizen, of
legal age, and a member of the House of Represent atives
-and a Tesident of Ichon, Macrohon, Southern Leyte,
Philippine s." The complaint 's cause of action stemmed
- from the alleged wrongful dishonor of petitioner Saludo's
AMEX credit card and the suppleme ntary card issued to
his daughter.
Responde nts averred that the complaint should be dismis,,cd
on the ground that venue was improper ly laid because
none of the parties was a resident of Leyte. They alleged
that responden ts were not residents of Southern Leyte.
Moreover, notwithsta nding the claim in his complaint ,
petitioner Saludo ~as not allegedly a resident thereof as
e·v idenced by the fact that his communit y tax certificate , ·
which .y;as presented when he executed the complaint 's
verifi~ation and certification of non-forum shopping, was
issued ,4] Pasay"City.

because not one of the parties, includin g petitione r SalucJ,o

Rule 73 - Subject of Estele of Deceased Persona

was a resident of Southern Leyte at the time of filing of the
co~plain t .
SUPREM E COURT'S RULING: The Court lays down the
doctrinal rule that the term 'resides' connotes ex ui termini 'actual
residence' as distinguish ed from 'legal residence or domicile.' This
term 'resides,' like the terms 'residing' and 'residence' is elastic and
should be interprete d in the light of the object or purposes of the
statute or rule in which it is employed.
Section 1, Rule 73 of the Revised Rl,\les of Court states
that residence rather than domicile is the significant factor in
determinin g venue. Even where the statute uses the word 'domicile'
still it is construed as residence and not domicile in the technical
sen~e. Some cases make a ctistinction between the terms 'residence'
and 'domicile' but as generally used in statutes fixing venue, the
terms are synonymous, and convey the same meaning as the term
'inhabitan t.' In other words, 'resides' should be viewed or understood
in its popular sense, meaning, the personal, actual or physical
habitation of a person, actual residence or place of abode. Residence
simply requires bodily presence as an inhabitan t in a given place,
while domicile requires bodily presence in that place and also an
intention to make it one's domicile. No particular length of time of
residence is required though; however, th_e residence must be more
than "temporar y."

to all the rights and properties of the deceas~d at the moment of
the latter's death. Section 1, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court, allows
heirs to divide the estate among themselves without need of delay
and risks of being dissipated. When a person dies ·without leaving
pending obligations, his heirs, are not required to submit the
., prope:rty for judicial administration, nor apply for the appointment
of an administrator by the court.

The Court of Appeals co!llmitted no reversible error when it
ruled that thelower court did not err in converting petitioner's action
for letters of administration into an action for judicial partition.
Nor can the Court sustain petitioner's argument that the Order
of the trial court converting an action for letters of administration
to one for judicial pa:rtition has no basis in the Rules of Court, hence
procedurally infirm. The basis for the trial court's Order is
Section -1, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court. It provides that in
cases where the heirs disagree as to the partition of the estate
and no extrajudicial settlement is possible, then ,, " rdinary
action for partition may be resorted to, as in this case.
1.131S THE ORDINARY ACTION FOR PARTIT: .vN INTENDED
TO TAKE THE SPECIAL PROCEEDING ON THE SETTLEMENT OF ESTATE?

Yes, the ordin~ry action for partition therefore is meant to take
the place of the special proceeding on the settlement of the estate.
The reason is that,:jf the deceased dies without pending obligations,
there is no necessiJy for the appointment of an administrator to
administer the estate for the heirs and the creditors, much less, the
necessity to deprive the real owners of their possession to which they
are immediately entitled. (Heirs of Ernesto Morales v. Astrid Morales
Agustin, represented by her Attorney-In-Fact, Edgardo Torres, G.R ..
No. 224849, June 6, 2018, Reyes, Jr., J.)

DOCTRINE:

a.

Definition of Partition

Partition is the separation, division and assignment of
a thing held in common among those to whom it may belong.
It may be effected exti-ajudiciall y by the heirs themselves
through a public instrument filed before the register of deeds.
b.

Oral partitfon of heirs when valid

However, as between the parties, a public instrument is
a contract
neither constitutive nor an inherent .element of
>
of partition. Since registration serves as constructive notice
to third persons, an oral partition by the heirs is valid if no
creditors, are affected.
Moreover, even the requirement of a written memorandum under the statute of frauds does not apply to partitions
effected by the heirs where no credit()rs are involved considering that such transaction is not a conveyance of property resulting in change of ownership but merely a designation and
segregation of that part which belongs to each heir.
Further, in the case of Maglucot-Aw v. Maglucot, the
SC held that partition may be inferred from circuihstances

sufficiently strong to support the pJ"esumption. Thus, after
a long possession in severalty, ·a deed of partition may_ be
presumed. It has been held that recitals in deeds, possession,
and occupation of land, improvements made thereon fo~ a
long series of years, and acquiescence for 60 years, furnish
sufficient evidence that there was an actual partition of la_nd
either by deed or by proceedings in the probate court, ~hich
had been lost and were not recorded.

of respondents ' intent to possess t h e s ubj ect property considering that Simon 's children n e ve r contested the conveyance of
the subject property to Leopoldo. A s to the fourth element of
laches, it goes withou t saying that p etitioners will be prejudiced if respondents ' complaint is accorded relief, or not held

precluding their right to recover the subject property.

They alleged t h at t h ey , toge the r with t.he petitioners and

respondent h as no cause of acti on again.st the petiti oner
because the proper remedy should not be a complaint fo r
partition but an action fo r the settlement of estate of Jayme
and his wife, and he has no more right of participation
over the subject property because the same has Long been
conveyed to Ernesto Morales by the ?espondent 's parents,
Simeon and Leonila Morales.

Accordingly, considering that Felisa and Juan already
owned the subject property at the time they. sold the same to
Leopoldo on May 14, 1966, having been assigned such property
pursuant to the oral partition of the estate of Simon effected by
_his heirs, petitioners are entitled to actual possession thereof.

He furth er contends that an admihistration proceeding for
the settlement of t h e estate of the deceased is a condition
that has to be m et before any partition of the estate and
any distribution thereof to the heirs could be effected.

How may his e~tate be settled by his heirs who are oflegal age
and have legal capacity? Explain.

Extrajudicial Settlement and Partition

SUGGESTED ANSWER:

The rules on special proceedings ordinarily require that
the e~tate of the deceased should be judicially administered
through an administrator or executor. What are the
exceptions to the said requirement?

The Rules of Court particularly Section 1 of Rule 74 is
applicable on the matter. If the decedent left no will and no debts, as
in the case of Nestor, and the heirs are all oflel!al age, his heirs may,
without securing letters of administration, divide the esta te among
themselves by means of public instrument or by stipulation in a
pending action for partition and shall p.le a bond with the register of
deeds in an amount equivalent to the value of the personal property
involved as certified to under oath by the parties concerned. The
fact of extrajudicial settlement shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation once a week for three consecutive weeks in the
province.

)

SUGGESTED ANSWER:
The exceptions to the rule that the estate of the dereased should
be judicially administered through an administrator vr executor are
the following:
1)
If the decedent left no will and no debts and the heirs
are all of legal age, the parties may, without securing letters of'
administr.ation, divide the estate among themselves by means
of public in'strument or by stipulation in a pending action for
partition
shall file a bond with the register of deeds in
an amount equivalent to the value of the personal property
involved as certified to under oath by the parties concerned.

To obtain a speedy settlement of his est~te, the remedy
available is to proceed to undertake a summary settlement of estate
of small value under Section 2, Rule 7 4 of the Rules of Court since
Rene's estate does not exceed PI0,000.00. The hearing shall be held
not less than one month nor more than three months from the date of
the last pu}?lication of a notice which shall be published once a week
for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation
in the province, and after such other notice to interested persons as
the court may direct, the court may l?roceed summarily, without the
appointment of an executor or administrator, to settle the estate.

2.00 WHAT IS AN AFFIDAVIT OF SELF-ADJUDICATION?
It is an affidavit required by Section 1 of Rule 74 that is to be
executed by the sole heir' of a deceased person in adjudicating to
himselF the entire estate left by the decedent. It is filed with the
Registry ofJ)eeds.
The Rule provides that the sole heir who adjudicates
the entire - estate to himself by means of an affida vit sh :> 1: fi le,
simultaneously with and as a condition precedent t o the . - b of
the public instrument, or stipulation in the action for p r -..:t_10n , or
of the affidavit in the office of the register of deeds, a bond with the
said register of deeds, in an amount equivalent to the value of ~he
personal property involve? as certifie.d to under oath_by the _parties
concerned and conditioned upon the payment of any Just claim that
may be filed under Section 4 of this rule.
Adjudication by ~ -.heir of the deceden~'s e~tire estate ~o
himself by means of an a.fjdavit is allowed only 1f he 1s th~ sole heir
to the estate. (Delgado Vda. de De la Rosa u. Heirs of Marciana Vda.

order established in Section 6 of Rule 78 in case the deceased left no
will ' or in case he did,.he failed to name an executor therein.

.

In light of the admission of respondent-spouses Gualvez, the
court a quo had properly rendered judgment on the validity of the
Affidavit of Self-Adjudication executed by Avelina. As poiy.ted out by
the trial court, an Affidavit of Self-Adjudication is only proper when
the affiant is the sole heir of the decedent. The second sentence of
Section I, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court is pat~ntly9clear that selfadjudication is only warranted when there is only one heir:
Section I. Extrajudicial settlement by agreement between heirs. - xx x If there is only one.heir, he may adjudicate to himself the entire estate by means of an affidavit
filed in the office of the register of deeds. x x x (emphasis
supplied)

.,
As admitted by respondents, Avelina was not the sole heir of
·Eulalia. In fact, petitioner Salvador is one of the co-heirs by right
of representation of his mother. Without a doubt, Avelina had perjured herself when she declared in the affidavit that she is "the
only daughter and sole heir of spouses EULALIO ABARIENTOS
AND VICTORIA VILLAREAL." The falsity of this claim renders her
act of adjudicating to herself the inheritance left by her father invalid.

1, IF A PERSON HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OR tfAD NOT PARTICIPATED IN THE EXTRAJUDICIAL SETTLEMENT, IS HE
BOUND THEREBY BY REASON OF CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE
OF PUBLICATION?

No. Publication in this ca se does not constitute constructive
notice. Under the second para graph of Rule 7 4 . Section 1. it expressly
provides: "The fa ct of the extrajud icial-settlement or administration
sha ll be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the
manner provided in the nex t succeeding section: but no extrajudicial
sett lem ent shall be binding upon any person who has not participated
therein or had no notice thereof. ''

In the case of Benatiro u. Hei rs of Cuy os, 560 SCRA 4 78, the
Supre m e Court explain ed that Extraj u dicial Settlement of Esta tes
under S ection 1 of RLLle 7 4 is an ex parte proceeding, and th e rule
plainly sta tes th at person s wh o do not participate or had no notice

Yes. Section 2, Rule 75 of the Rules of Court expressly provides

copy of the will in her possession, she, therefore, can be compelled to

Section 3 of Rule_ 75 expressly states that a person named as

of the testator, or within 20 days after he knows that he is named
executor if he obtained ;u~h knowledge after the death of the testator,

Is Cancio Vidal, after learning of Sergio's death,
• ·d to file with the proper court a petition for probate of

the latter's will and testament?

SUGGESTED ANSWER:
Yes. Section 3, Rule 75 of the Rules of Court is explicit. A person
amed as executor in a will shall, within 20 days after he knows of
~he death of the testator, or wit hin 20 days after he knows that he
is named executor if he obtained such knowledge _afte~ t~e _de_a th
of the testator, present such will to the court having Junsdictlon.
Considering the fact tlrat Cancio Vidal is named as executor in the
.,will, he is, therefore, obliged to file a petition for probate of the will
3.04 MAY MANDAMUS LIE TO COMPEL THE- PRODUCTION OF
THE ORIGINAL WILL?

No, as held in the case of Uy Kiao Eng v. Nixon., Lee, G.R. No.
176831, January 5, 2010, the Supreme Court, without unnecessarily
ascertaining .whether the obligation involved here - the production
of the original holographic will - is in the nature of a public or a
private duty, rules that the remedy of mandamus cannot be availed
of by the respondent because there lies another plain, speedy andadequate remedy in the ordinary course oflaw. It should be noted in
this case that the respondent has a photocopy of the will and that he
seeks the production of the original for purposes of probate.
The Rules of Court, however, does not prevent him from
instituting probate proceedings for the allowan·ce of the will whether
the same is in his possession or not. Section 1 of Rule 76 relevantly
provides:
Sec. 1. Who may petition for the allowance of will. Any executor, devisee, or legatee named in a will, or any

other p e rson interested in the estate, may, at any time
after the death of the testator, petition the court having

1.01 IS PROBATE OF AWILL SUBJECT TO PRESCRIPTION?

' 1

No. The petJ.tion for probate.of the will is not subj~c_t to the
statute of limitations and does not prescribe, as such petition may

169144, January 26, 2011)
1.05 BAR Q. [2012)

What are the jurisdictional facts that must be alleged in
•
a petition for probate of a will?
SUGGESTED ANSWER:

The testator himself may, during his lifetime, petition the
court for the allowance of his will.

The jurisdictional facts in probate proc.e edings are the death of
the decedent, his residence at the time of his death in the province
of where the probate court is sitting, or if he is ·an inhabitant of a
foreign country, his leaving his estate in such province. (Cuenca v.
CA, 53 SCRA 360)

1.03 WHO IS A "PERSON INTERESTED IN THE ESTATE"?

·1.06 WHAT IS THE NATURE OF PROBATE PROCEEDINGS?

As a rule, in order. that a person may be allowed to intervene
in a probate proceeclin.g.!P-e must have an interest in the estate, or in
the will, or in the property to be affected by it either as executor or
as a claimant of the estate. An interested party is one who would
be benefited by the estate such as an heir or one who has a claim

Probate proceedings is in rem . The notice by publication as a
prerequisite to the allowance of a will, is a constructive notice to the
whole world, and when probate is granted the judgment is binding
upon everybody, even against the State. The probate of a will of the
court having jurisdiction thereof is conclusive as to its due execution
and validity. (Cuenca v. CA, 53 SCRA 360)

2.04 UNDER RULE 76, 2ND PARAGRAPH OF SECTION 11, WHAT

Why?
SUGGESTED ANSWER:

Yes, an order denying the probate of a will may be overturned
after the period to appeal therefrom has lapsed. A petition for
relief may be filed on the grounds of fraud, accident, mistake or
excusable negligence within a period of 60 days after the petitioner
learns of the judgment or final order and not more than six months
after such judgment or final order was entered. (Rule 38, Secs. 1 and
3; Soriano v. A~( 100 Phil. 785 [1957]) An action for annulment
may also be filed on the ground of extrinsic fraud within four years.
from its discov~, and if based on lack of jurisdiction, before it is
barred by laches o r estoppel. (Rule 47, Secs. 2 and 3)

-\
2.03 UNDER RULE 76; SECTION 11, WHAT MUST BE DONE IF THE

NOTARIAL WILL IS CONTESTED?

For notarial wills, Section 11 of Rule 76 provides that if the
will is contested, all the subscribing . witnesses, and the notary in

I·

Rule 76 - Allowance or o·isall owance of Will

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS

MUST BE DONE IF A HOLOGRAPHIC WII.L IS CONTESTED?

The possibility of false document being adjudged as the will of
t~e ~estator cannot be eliminated, which is why if the holographic
will is contested, the law requires thre,e (3) witnesses to declare that
_the will was in the handwriting of the deceased, (Coday u. Calugay,
~
G.R. No. 123486, August 12, 1999)

It should be noted that 2nd paragraph of Section 11, Rule 76
provides that, "If a holographic will is contested, the same shall
be allowed if at least three (3) witnesses who know the handwriting
of the testator explicitly declare that the will and the signature are
in the handwriting of the testator; in the .absence of any competent witness, and if the court deem it necessary, expert testimony
may be resorted to."

Probate of a Will Is a. Proceedfo g bt Rem

ALABAN, et al. v. COURT OF APPEALS
G.R. No. 156021, Septembe r 23, 20'05
FACTS:

Respondent Francisco Provido filed a petition for the
probate of the Last Will and Testamenl of the late Soledad
Provido Elevencionado. Respondent alleged that he was
the heir of the decedent and the executor of her will. The
RTC in P.D. Monfort North, Dumangas, Iloilo allowed the
probate of the will of the decedent and directed the issuance
of letters testamenta ry to responden t;
Petitioners filed a motion for the reopening of the probate
proceedings. Likewise, they filed an opposition to the
allowance of the will of-the decedent, as well as the issuance
of letters testamenta ry to respondent, claiming that they
are the intestate heirs of the decedent. Petitioners claimed
that the RTC did not acquire jurisdiction over the petition
due to non-payment of the correct docket fe_es, defective
publication; and Jack of notice to the other heirs.

•

~TC issued an Order denying petitioners ' motion for
being unmeritorious holding that petitioners were
deemed notified of the hearing by publication and that the
deficiency in the payment of docket fees is not a ground for
the outright dismissal of the petition. It merely required
responden t to pay the deficiency.

ISSUE: Whether or not petitioner s have become parties to the,
probate proceedin gs by virtue of a notice by publicatio n.
SUPREM E · COURT'S RULING: It has been held that a
proceeding for the probate of a will is one in rem, such that with
the corresponding M blication of the petition the court's jurisdictio n
extends to all perso_~s interested in said will or in the settlement of
the estate of the decedent.
Publicati on is notice to the whole world that the
proceedin g has for its object to bar indefinite ly all who
might be minded to make an objection of any sort against
the right sought to be establishe d. It is the publicati on of

case and vests the court with jurisdicti on to hear and decide
jt. Thus, even though petitioner s were not mentione d in the
petition for probate, they eventuall y became parties thereto
~ a conseque nce of the publicatio n of the notice of hearing.
Assuming arguendo that petitione"tS are entitled to be so
notified, the purported infir mity is cured by the publication of
the notice. After all, personal notice upon-the heirs is a matter of
procedural convenience and not a jurisdictio nal 1-equisite.

2.01 BAR Q. [2014]
Probate of a Notarial Will Executed Abroad
-t

Johnny, a naturalized citizen of the United States of
America (USA) but formerly a Filipino citizen, executed
a notarial will in accordance with the laws of the State
of California, USA. Johnny,_at the time of his death, was
survived by his niece Anastacia, an American citizen residing
at the condominium unit of Johnny located at Fort Bonifacio,
Taguig City; a younger brother, Bartolome, who manages
Johnny's fish pond in Lingayen, Pangasinan; and a younger
sister, Christina, who manages Johnny's rental condominium
units in Makati City. Johnnls entire estate which he inherited
from his parents is valued at P200 million. Johnny appointed
Anast~cia as executrix of his will.
(A) Can Johnny's notarial will be probated before the
proper court in the Philippines?
(B)

XX X

SUGGESTED ANSWER:
Yes, Johnny's notarial will can be probated before th e proper
court in the Philippines.

It is a settled jurisprudential doctrine that our laws do not
prohibit the prob.ate of wills executed by foreigners abroad although
the same have not yet been probated and allowed in the countries of
their execution. Article 816 of the Civil Code expressly provides that
the will of an alien who is abroad produces effect in thP D],;•· ,pines
if made in accordance with the formalities prescribed by
'--'" of
the place where he resides or according to the formalities OL•scrved
in his country.
In the case at bar, Johnny's notarial will was executed in
accordance with the·laws of California, U.S.A. Hence, his will may
be probated in the Philippines.

2.02 UNDER SECTION 4 Of RULE 77, WOULD THE COURT'S OR·
DER EXTEND TO All:: THE ESTATE OF THE TESTATOR IN
THE PHILIPPINES?
Y~s, Section 4 of Rule 77 provides that when a will is thus
allowed, the court shall grant letters testamentary, or letters of
administration with the will annexed, and such letters testamentary '

Rule 77 - Allowance of WiJI Proved Outside of the Philippines

shall extend to all the estate of the testator in
or of administration,
.
the Philipprnes.
Such estate, after the payment of just debts and expenses of
dministration,
shall be disposed of according to such will, so far
8
5 sUCh will may operate upon it; and the residue, if any, shall be
~sposed of as is provided by I_aw in _cases of estates in the Philippines
· belonging to persons who are mhab1tants of another state or country.

2.03_BAR Q. [2011)
Will Probated Abroad and Probated in the Philippines

Pedrillo, a Fil-Am permanent resident of Los Angeles,
California at the time of his death, bequeathed to Winston
a sum of money to pur~hase an annuity. Upon Pedrillo's
demise, his will was duly probated in Los Angeles and
the specified sum in the will -was in fact used to purchase
an annuity with XYZ of Hong Kong so that Winston would
receive the equivalent ofUS$1,000 per month for the.next 15
years.
· Wanting to receive the principal amount of the annuity,
Winston files for the probate of Pedrillo's will i.i:i.Ma.kat~RTC.
As prayed for, the court names Winston as administrator of
the estate.
Winston now files in the Ma.kati RTC a motion to compel
XYZ to account for aU sums in its possession forming part of
Pedrillo's estate. Rule on the motion.

SUGGESTED ANSWER:
. The motion must be denied. When a will is allowed, the letters
of administration granted by the court shall extend to all the estate
of the testator in the Philippines. (Rule 77, Sec. 4) Hence, RTC of
Mak_a ti has no jurisdiction over XYZ of Hong Kong.
"

2.04 CAN OUR COURTS TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE OF FOREIGN LAWS?
No, foreign laws do not prove themselves in our jurisdiction and
our courts are not authorized to take judicial notice of them. Hence,
ex~cutors or administrators of the decedent's estate are duty-bound
to mtroduce in evidence the pertinent law of the foreign court which
atjmitted to probate the will of the decedent. (Ancheta u. Dalaygon,

however, have some fact legally before it in order to jus.
tify such removal. There must be evidence of an act or
omission on the part of the administrator not conform.
able to or in disregard of the rules or the orders of the
court which it deems sufficient or substantial to war.
rant the removal of the administrator. Suffice it to state
that the removal of an administrator does not lie on the
whims, caprices and dictates of the heirs or beneficia.rie8
of the estate.

The RTC issued the assailed order denying the petitioners'
Omnibus M~tion and likewise denied the subsequent
Motion for Reconsideration . The Court of Appeals affirm ed
the decision of the tria l court. Hence, th.is petition.
1ssUES:
In the appointment of administrator, do petitioners
J.

have prefere·n tial and superior rights as legitimate
children over the respondents who are the ille~
timate children of the decedent?

FACTS:

2.

Respondent-minors Yohanna and . Victoria Longa,
represented by their mother, Mary Jane B. Sta. Cruz <Ms.
Sta. Cruz), filed a Petition for Letters of Administration
for the intestate estate of the deceased Enrique T. Longa.
Respondents alleged that Enrique died intestate, survived
by petitioners Eleptherios and Stephen (legitimate children)
an·d respondents Yohanna and Victoria, (illegitimate
children) who are both minors; and that Enrique left
several properties with no creditors.
Subsequ~ntly, the RTC issued an Order · appointing Ms.
Sta. Cruz, the mother of the respondent minors, as the
_ administratrix of Enrique's estate. The RTC then issued
the Letters of Ad.ministration upon the respondentadministratrix's posting of a bond. Thereafter, Ms. Sta.
Cruz submitted a Report of the Inventory and Appraisal of
the real and personal properties of the decedent which was
duly noted by the RTC.
Petitioners filed an Omnibus Motion to remove Ms. ..3ta.
Cruz as administratrix and to appoint Elepther,:os ur his
nominee as administrator. Petitioners accused Ms. Sta.
Cruz of acts of misrepresentatio n for not disclosing all the.
assets of the decedent.
Further~. petitioners assert that each of them, being the
survivm'g spouse and legitimate children of Enrique, has a
preferential right over respondents to act as admin istrator
of the estate, or to designate somebody else to administer
the estate in their behalf, pursuant to the order of preference
under Rule 78, Section 6.

Should Ms. Sta. Cruz be removed as administratri x
for alleged acts of concealing decedent's asset?

SUPREME COURT'S RULING:
1.

No, the petitioners do not have preferential and superior
rights as legitimate children over the respondents
who are illegitimate children of the decedent. The
preference given to the surviving spouse, next of kin,
and creditors is not absolute, and that the appointment
of an administrator greatly depends on the atie.ndant
facts and circumstances of eac,h case.
}

In the appointment of the administrator of the estate of a deceased person, the principal consideration
reckoned with is the interest in said"estate of the one to
be appointed as administrator .

In the instant case, petitioners are non-residents
of the Philippines, which disqualify them from
administering the decedent's estate pursuant to Rule 78,
Section 1 of the Rules of Court. Likewise, respondents
Yohanna Longa and Victoria Longa are also disqualified
by reason of their minority. In view of the evident
disqualificatio n of petitioners and respondents and the
lack of any known creditors, the parties have no choice
but to have somebody else administer the estate for
them.
In the case herein, respondent-ad ministratrix's interest is to protect the estate for the benefit of her children with Enrique. Indeed, it is the minor respondents
who would directly benefit from an orderly-and ~fficient
management by the respondent-ad ministratrix.

Rule 78 -

No, the petitioners did not present a~; factual and lega)
ground to remove Ms. Sta. Cruz as administratrix of
Enrique's estate. Section 2, Rule 76 of the Rules of Court
requires only an allegation of the probable value of the
character of the property of the estate. If the true value
and properties would be known later on, the same
should be reported and made known to the court, just
as what Ms. Sta. Cruz did in the instant case.

3.06 ·EXPLAIN THE REASON WHY THE Ap POINTMENT OF CO-AD.
MINISTRATORS HAS BEEN ALLOWED DESPITE THE RULE
ON THE ORDER OF PREFERENCE.

an

The paramo~t consideration in the . appointment of
administrator over the estate of a decedent is the prospective
administrator's interest in the estate.

It is to this requirement of observation of the order of preference
in the appointment of administrator of a decedent's estate that
the appointment of co-administrators has been allowed, but as an /
exception. Reference must be made to Section 6(a) of Rule 78 of the
Rules of Court which specifically states that letters of administration
may be issued to both the surviving spouse and the next of kin. In
addition and impliedly, the Supreme Court in its discussion, pointed
to Section 2 of Rule 82 of the Rules of Court which say that "x x x
when an executor or administrator dies, resigns or is removed, Ui.e
remaining executor or administrator may administer the trust alone
x x x." (In the Matter of the Intestate Estate of Cristina AguinmdoSuntay v. Isabel Cojuangco-Suntay, G.R. No . 183053, Oc!obcr 10,
2012)
3.07 WHAT IS THE SCOPE OR LIMIT OF ADMINIS TR ~TION?

The general rule universally recognized is that administration /
extends only to .the assets of a decedent found within the state ?r
country where it was granted, so that an administrator appointed 1Jl
one state or country has no power over the property in another state /
or country, This.__is specifically embodied in Section 4, Rule 78 of t~e
Rules of Couit:..:_(Leon u. Manufacturers Life Insurance Co,, 90 Phil.
459, 463)
The courts have always respected the right to which a testator
enjoys to determine who is most suitable to settle his testamentary
affairs, and his solemn selection should not lightly be disregarded.

RULE 79
OPPOSING ISSUANC,E OF LETTf;RS TESTAMENTARY
PETITION AND CONTEST FOR LETTERS
OF ADMINISTRATIO~
(BAR QUESTIONS: 2008, 2010)
1.00 UNDER SECTION 2 OF RULE 79, WHO MAY FILE AN OPPOSITION TO THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS TESTAMENTARY?

Any person· interested in a will may state in writing the
grounds why letters te~tamentary should not issue to the persons
named therein as executors, or any of them. The court, after hearing
upon notice, shall pass upon the sufficiency of such grounds.
1.01 WHO MAY FILE A PETITION FOR LETTERS OF ADMINISTRA. TION?

A petition for letters of administ;ation mu5t be filed by an
interested person. (Sec. 2)
1.02 WHO IS AN "INTERESTED PARTY" IN ESTATE· PROCEEDINGS? WHAT ABOUT THE "NEXT OF KIN''?

Section 2, Rule 79 of the Rules of Court provides that a Petition
for Letters of Administration must be ·filed by an interested person.
An "interested party," in estate proceedings, is one who would be
benefited in the estate, such as an heir, or one who has claim against
the estate, such as creditor. (Heirs of Austino Mesina and Genoveva
S. Mesina, represented by Norman Mesina v. Heirs of Doiningo Fian,
Sr., represented by Theresa Fian Yray, ewl., G.R. No. 201816, April 8,
2013)

Also, in estate proceedings, the phrase "next of kin" refers to
those whose relationship with the decedent is such that they are
entitled to share in the estate as distributees. (Quiazon v. Belen,
G.R. No. 189121, July 31, 2013)

1.03 CASE
AMELIA GARCIA-QUIAZON v. MA. LOURDES BELEN
G.R. No. 189121, July 31, 2013
DOCTRINE: An "interested party," in estate proceedings, is
one who would be benefited in the estate, such as an heir, or
one who has a claim against the estate, such as a creditor.·
Also, in estate proceedings, the phrase ''next of kin" refers to
those whose relationship with the decedent•is such that they
are entitled to share in the estate as distributees.

SUPREME COURT'S RULING: In the instant case, Elise, as
a compulsory heir who stands to be benefited by the distribution
of Eliseo's estate, is deemed to be an interested party. With the
oyerwhelming evidence on record produced by Elise to prove her
filiation to Eliseo, the petitioner's pounding on her lack of interest
in the administration of the decedent's estate, is just a desperate
attempt to sway this Court to reverse the findings of the Court of
Appeals. Certainly, the right of Elise to be appointed administratrix
of the estate of Eliseo is on good grounds. It is founded on her right
as a compulsory heir, who, under the law, is entitled to her legitime
after the debts of the estate are satisfied. Having a vested right
in the distribution of Eliseo's estate as one natural children, Elise
can I,e rightfully be considered as an interested party within the
purview·of the law.
An "interested party," in estate proceedings, is one who would
be benefited in the estate, such as an heir, or one who has a claim
against the estate, such as a creditor. Also, in estate proceedings,
the phrase "next of kin" refers to those whose relationship wi th
the decedent is such that they are entitled to share in the estc,:
distributees.

1.04 UNDER SECTION 2 OF RULE 79, ENUMERATE THE CONTENTS OF A PETITION FOR LETTERS OF ADMINISTRATION.
Under the saiq rule, a petition for letters of administration
must be filed by an interested person and must show, so far as
known to the petitioner:
(a)

The jurisdictional facts;

(b) The names, ages, and residences of the heirs, and
the names and residences of the creditors, of the decedent;

CHAPTER.2

109

(c) The probable value and character of the property of
the estate;
(d) The name of the person for whom letters of
administration are prayed.
But no defect on the petition shall render void the issuance of
letters of administration .
1.05 UNDER SECTION 4 OF RULE 79, ON WHA'r GROUND MAY AN
INTERESTED PERSON FILE A WRITTEN OPPOSITION FOR
PETITION FOR ADMINISTRATION?

The Rule states that any interested person may, by filing
a written opposition, contest the petition on the ground of the
incompetency of the person for whom letters are prayed therein, or
on the ground of the contestant's own right to the administration,
and may pray that letters issue to himself, or to any competent
person or persons named in the opposition.
1.06 BAR Q. [2008)
Oppositor to a Petition for Administration
Domenico and Gen lived without"the benefit of marriage
for twenty years, during which time they purchased
properties together. After Domenico die~ without a will,
Gen filed a petition for letters of administration. Domenico's
siblings opposed the same on the ground that Gen has no legal
personality. Decide.
SUGGESTED ANSWER:

The opposition filed by Domenico's siblings should be denied.
Contrary to their claim, Gen has legal personality to file a petition
for administration. Section 2, Rule 79 of the Rules of Court expressly
provides that said petition may be filed by any "interest~d party."
The fact that Gen and Domenico was not married is of no moment.
She is considered as "interested · party" because their ''live-in"
relationship is governed by the property regime of a union without
marriage under Chapter 7, Article 147 or 148 of the Family Code as
the case may be.
Section 4 of Rule 79 provides that, "Any interested p'erson may,
by filing a ·written opposition, contest the petition on the ground_0 ~
the incompetency of the person for whom letters are prayed therem,

• 115

Rule 80-Spe cinl ·Adminis tra tor

as provid ed in the afore-q uoted provisi on does not apply to

to the appoin tment of a regula r admin istrato r, and not of a

FACTS:
Gerard o Tan died, leaving no will. The private respond ents,
being illegiti mate childre n of the' decease d, filed with
the RTC of Ormoc a petition for the issuanc e of letters of
admini stration and moved for the appoin tment of attorne yin-fact Romua ldo Lim as the special admini strator of the
decease d estate. It was oppose d by petition e-rs, claimin g to
be the legitim ate childre n of Gerard o Tan and moved for
the appoin tment of Vilma Tan as already acting as de facto
admini strattjx of Gerard o's estate. The court appoin ted ·
Vilma Tan as the de facto admini strator , howeve r, due to
the fact that she did not comply with her duties, Romua ldo
Lim was appoin ted as the special admini strator of Gerard o's
estate.
Petitio ner filed a motion for _.r econsid eration for Vilma's
appoin tment conten ding that ·they shouM be given priority
in the admini stration of the estate since they are alleged ly

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS

CHAPTER2

(A Foresight u, the Bar Exam nnd the Practice of Law)

1.09 WHEN MAY THE col/RT APPOINT SPECIAL co-ADMINts.

TRATORS?

.

Under certain circumstances and for various reasons well.
settled in Philippine and American jurisprudence, the Supreme
Court upheld the appointment of co-administrators:
1.
To have the benefits of their judgment and p-erhap8
at all times to have different interests represented;

2.
Where justice and equity demand that opposing
parties or factions be representeg in the management of the
estate of the deceased;
3.
Where the estate is large or, from any cause, an
intricate and perplexing one to settle;
4.
To have all interested persons satisfied and the
representati ves to work in harmony for the best interests of
the estate; and

5.
When a person entitled to the administrati on of an
estate desires to have another competent person associated
with him in the office.

In the frequently cited Matias v. Gonzales, the Court dwelt on
the appointmen t of special co-administr ators during the pendency
of the appe~ for the probate of the decedent's will. Pending the
probate therefore, the .Court recognized Matias' special interest in
the decedent's estate as universal heir and executrix designated in
the instrument who should not be excluded in the administration
thereof. Thus, it held that justice and equity demand that two
factions among the non-compulsory heirs of the decedent, consisting
of an instituted heir (Matias) and intestate heixs (resr. · · ' ~nts
thereat), should be represented in the managemen t of the dece .. ~nt s
estate. (Emilio Suntay v. Isabel Cojuanco-Su ntay, C.R. No. 182IJ53,
October JO, 2012)

coue ·drari, however, requires noth-~ng less than grave abuse of

RULE 81
BONDS OF EXECUTOR S AND ADMINISTR ATORS
1.00 IS THE EXECUTOR OR ADMINl~TRA TOR REQUIRED TO
POST BOND?
Yes. Before an executor or administrator enters upon the
~xecution of his trust, and letters testamentary or of administratio n
issue, he sheJJ give a bond, in such sum as the court directs
'
conditioned as follows :
(a) To make and return to the court, within three
months, a true and complete inventory of eJJ goods, chattels,
rights, creclits, and estate of the deceased wruch shall come to
his possession or knowledge or to the possession of any other
person for him ;
(b) To administer according to these rules, and, if an
executor ,..according to the will of the testator, all goods, chattels,
rights, creclits, and estate wruch shall at any time come to his
possession or to the possession of any other person for him,
and from the proceeds to pay and discharge all debts, legaci~s.
and charges on the same, or such clividends thereon as shali be
decreed by the court;
To render a true and j us t a cco ·1 nt of his
(c)
1 ,y ot h er
administratio n to the court with.in one year , a n L
time when required by the court;
(d) . To perform all orders of the court by rum to be
performed.

1.01 WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANC E OF THE BOND POSTED BY AN
EXECUTOR OR ADMINISTRA TOR?
The bond posted by administrato rs and e xec utors is intended
as an indemnity to the creditors, the h eirs and th e es tate. The co urt
shall fix the amount thereof and hold it acco untabl e for a ny breach

c. Generally, consolidation and joint hearing of the two casts
l)()llld have been proper if they do not inuolue settlement uf the estate
1
f O decedent, whicli is covered by a special provi&ian of tM Rules of
~ourt, namely Section 1 of Rule 73, the specific command of which
should be obeyed.
i .02 THE DISCOVERY OF THE WILL IPSO FACTO NULLIFY TME
LETTERS OF ADMINISTRATION ALREADY ISSUED?

No-It is only when the newly discovered will has been admitted
to probate that the letters of administration ~ay be revoked.

1.00 PURSUANT TO SECTION 1, RULE 82, WHEN A WILL IS LAT.
ER DISCOVE~ED, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE LETTERS
OF ADMINISTRATION PREVIOUSLY GRANTED?

If after letters of administration have been granted on the
estate of a decedent as if he had died intestate, his will is proved
and allowed by the court, the letters of administration shall be
revoked and all powers thereunder cease, and the administrator
shall forthwith surrender the letters to the court, and render his
account -w ithin such time as the court directs. Proceedings for the
issuance of letters testamentary or of administration under the will
shall be as hereinbefore provided.
1.01 WHAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE IF A WILL IS LATER DISCOV,
ERED DURING THE INTESTATE PROCEEDING?

a.
If in the course of the intestate proceedings, it is found
that the decedent left a will, proceedings for the probate of the lczter
-should replace the intestate proceedings even if at tha_t stage, ~n administrator had already been appointed, the latter bemg reqmred to
render a final account and turn over the estate in lus J
~ion to
the executor subsequently appointed. This, however, !s unde~·-stood
to be without prejudice that the proceeding shall contmue as mtestacy. (Uriate v. CF! of Negros Occidental, 33 SCRA 252, 259)

In Aduincula u. Teodoro, 99 Phil 413, the Supreme Court
bad the occasion to declare that mere discovery of a document
purporting to be the last will and testament of the decedent after
the appointment of an administrator does not ipso facto nullify the
letters of administration already issued or even authorize their
revocation until the ~ has been proved and allowed.
1.03 BAR Q. [2002)

x x x B. What should the court do if, in the course of
intestate proceedings, a will is found and it is submitted for
probate? Explain.
SUGGESTED ANSWER:

If a will is subsequently found while tlte intestate proceeding
is pending and the will is submitted for probate, the intestateproceedings shall be discontinued or suspended. After the will is
probated, the intestate proceedings will be terminated.
2.00 WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF ADMINISTRATION?

The purpose of administration is the liquidation of the estate
and distribution of the residue among the heirs and legatees.

b. · Wh~ther the intestate proceeding already commen~ed
should be discontinued and a new proceeding under a separate

2.01 WHAT DOES LIQUIDATION MEAN?

number and title should be constituted is entirely a matter of form
and lies withiCJ the sound discretion of the court. In no manner does
it prejudice th.e substantial rights of any of the heirs or creditors.
(Reynoso v. Santiago, 85 Phil. 268, 270)

Liquidation means the determination of all the assets of the
estate and payment of all debts and expenses. Approval of the
project of partition does not necessarily terminate administration.

Raio 8 2 - Revocation or Administrati on. Death, Resi gna tion
and Removal of Exec:atore and Administrators

2 .02 UNDER SECTION 2 OF RULE 82, WHAT A,~ THE GROUNDS
WHEREIN A COURT MAY· REMOVE OR ACCEPT RESIGNA.
TION OF EXECUTOR OR ADMINISTRATOR?

If an executor or administrator neglects to render his account
and settle the estate according to law, or to perform an order or
judgment of the court, or a duty expressly provided by these rules, or
absconds, or becomes insane, or otherwise incapable or unsuitable to
discharge the trust, the court may remove him, or, in its discretion,
may permit him to resign.
When an executor or administrator dies, resigns, or is removed
the remaining executor or administrator "inay administer the trust
alone, unless the court grants letters to someone to act with him.
If there is no remaining executor or administrator, administration
may be granted to any suitable person .

2.03 ARE THE GROUNDS ENUMERATED THEREIN EXCLUSIVE?
The grounds enumerated for removal of an administrator are
not exclusive. The court is invested with ample discretion in the
removal of an administrator for as long as there is evidence of an
act or omission on the part of the administrator not conformable to
or in disregard of the rules or the orders of the court which it deems
sufficient or substantial to warrant the removal of the administrator.

2.04 ARE THE GROUNDS FOR REMOVAL OF A SPECIAL ADMIN-1STRATOR THE SAME AS THOSE FOR REMOVAL OF EXE~";UTOR OR ADMINISTRATOR ?
No. A special administrator may b e rem ove d on 0th ,=, ·- grounds
upon the court's discretion.

2.05 CITE EXAMPLES OF VALID GROUNDS FOR r .:::MOVAL O.F AN
ADMINISTRATOR BY THE PROBATE COURT.

The following constitute valid grounds for removal of an
administrator:
1.

~An administrator who dis bursed funds of the estate
cial approval. (Cot ia v. J imenez, 104 Phil. 966)

without•j~

2.
False representation by an administrator in securing
his appointment. (Cabarrubias v. Dizon, 76 Phil. 209)

3.

PROVISION FOR SUPPORT OF FAMILY
1.00 UNDER SECTION 1 OF RULE 83, IS THE EXECUTOR OR AD.
MINISTRATOR DUTY BOUND TO MAKE ~ RETURN OF THE
INVENTORY AND APPRAISAL OF THE ESTATE?
Yes. Section 1 expressly provides that three months after his
appointment every executor or administrator shall return to the court
a true inventory and appraisal of all the real and personal estate of
the deceased which has come into his possession or knowledge.

.

1.01 IS THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD TO SUBMIT AN INVENTORY
AND APP.RAISAL OF ALL REAL AND PERSONAL ESTATE
MANDATORY?
No, the three-month period under this Rule is not mandatory.
The court retains jurisdiction notwithstanding the fact that the
inventory is filed beyond the said period . After the filing of the petition
for .the issuance of letters of administration and the publication of
the notice of hearing, the probate court acquires jurisdiction over a
decedent's-estate and retains that jurisdiction until the proceeding
is closed. The fact that an inventory was filed after the tbr.s!': -month
period-would not deprive the probate court of jurisdicti np 1··i approve
it. The delay in filing the inventory by the administratr
.' ever,
if not satisfactorily explained, may be a ground for r,- ' •LWal. (Sebial

Under Section 2, the wearing apparel of the surviving husband
or wife and minor children, the marriage bed '.111d bedding, an~ such
provisions and other :;i.rticles as will necessarily be consumed m the
subsistence of the fa,roily of the deceased, under the direction of the

2.02 CASE
puty to Make an Inventory

ARANAS v. MERCADO, et al.
G.R. No. 156407, January 15, 2014
sUPREME COURT'S RULING: Under Section 6(a), Rule 78 of
the Rules of Court, the letters of administration may be granted at
the discretion of the court to the surviving spouse, who is competent
and willing to serve when the person dies intestate. Upon issuing
the letters of administration to the surviving spouse, the RTC
becomes duty-bound to direct the preparation and submission of the
inventory of the properties of the estate, and the surviving spouse,
as the administrator, has the duty and re_sponsibility to submit
the inventory within three months from the issuance' of letters of
administration pursuant to Rule 83 of the Rules of Court, viz. :

Section 1. Inventory and appraisal to b; returned within
three months. - Within three (3) months after hi.s appointment
every executor or administrator shall return to the court a true
inventory and appraisal of all the real and personal estate of
the deceased which has come into his possession or knowledge.
In the appraisement of such estate, the court may order one
or more of the inheritance tax appraisers to give his or their
assistance.
The usage of the word "all" in Section 1, supra, demands the
inclusion of all the real and personal properties of the decedent in
the inventory. However, the word "all" is qualified by the phrase
which has come into his possession or knowledge, which signifies
that the prope"rties must be known to the administrator as
decedent's properties or are in her possession as the administrator.
Section 1 allows no exception, for the phrase true inventory implies
that no properties which appear to be owned by the decedent can be

:Cathe estate, such as the dete rmin ation of _the s~a tus of each h~ir
whether the property in the inventory is conJugal or exclusive
an d
property of the deceased spouse.

The objective of the Rules of Court in requiring the inventory
~nd a~p.raisaJ of the estate of the decedent is "to aid the court
rn revising the accounts and determining the liabilities of the
e~ec~tor _or the ad_~ istrator, and in making a final and equitable
disti:ib~tion _(partition) of the estate and then to facilitate the
admuustration of the estate." Hence, the RTC that presides over
the ad~istration of an estate is vested with wide discretion on
the qu~stion of what properties should befocluded in the inventory,
According to Peralta v. Peralta, the CA cannot impose its judgment
in order to supplant that of the RTC on the issue of which properties
are to be included or excluded from the inventory in the absence of
"positive abuse of discretion," for in the administration of the estates
of deceased persons, "the judges enjoy ample discretionary powers
and the appellate courts should not interfere with or attempt to
replace the action taken by them, unless it be shown that there has
been a positive abuse of discretion." As long as the RTC commits no
patently grave abuse of discretion, its orders must be respected as
part of the regular performance of its judicial duty.
There is no dispute that the jurisdiction of the trial court as
an intestate court is special and limited. The trial court cannot
adjudicate title to properties which are claimed · to be part of the
estate but are 'claimed to be belonging to third parties by title
adverse to that of the decedent and the estate, not by virtue of any
right' of inheritance from the decedent. All that the trial court can do
regarding said properties is to determine whether or not they should
be included in the inventory of properties to be administered by the
administrator. Such determination is provisional and may be still
revised. As the Court said in Agtarap v. Agtarap:

rule is that such court merely exercises special and limited
jurisdicfion.
However, this general rule is subject to exceptions as justified
by expediency and convenience.
First, the probate court may provisionally pass upon in an
intestate or a testate proceeding the question of inclusion i~, or

DURING THE SETTLEMENT OF THE ESTATE?
Under Section 3, the widow and minor or incapacitated children
of a deceased person, during the settlement of the estate, shall
receive therefrom, under the direction of the court, such alJowance
as are provided by law.

2.04 ARE GRANDCHILDREN ENTITLEO TO ALLOWANCE?
No, grandchildren are not entitied to allo~ ance under Rule
83. The law clearly limits the allowance to "widow and children"
and does not extend it to the deceased's grlllldchildren, regardless
of their minority or incapacity. (Estate of Hilario Ruiz v. Court of

Respondents Rolando Sy, Rosalino Sy, Lucio Sy, Enrique

second marriage to respondent Rosita Ferrera-Sy, while
petitioners Jose Sy Bang, Julian Sy, and Oscar Sy are the
children of Sy Bang from his first marriage to Ba Nga, and
petitioners Zenaida Tan and Ma. Emma Sy are the chµdren
of petitioner spouses Jose Sy Bang and Iluminada Tan.

•

Respondents filed a Complaint for Partition against
petitioners.

•

During ap · out-of-court conference ~etween petitioners
and respondents, it was agreed that the management
supervision or administration of the common propertie~
and/or the entire estate of the deceased Sy Bang shall
be placed temporarily in the hands of petitioner Jose Sy
Bang. They also agreed that the income of the three cinema
houses shall exclusively pertain to respondents for their
support and sustenance, pending the termination of Civil
Case No. 8578, for Judicial Partition, and the income from
the vast parts of the entire estate and other businesses of
their common father, to pertain exclusively to petitioners.
i

While the case was pending, Rosita Ferrera-Sy filed a
Motion for Payment of Widow's Allowance. She alleged
that her deceased husband, Sy Bang, left an extensive
estate. The properties of the estate were found by the trial
court to be their conjugal properties. From the time of Sy
Bang's death until the filing of the motion, Rosita was not
given any widow's allowance as provided in Ser •i,- · 1, Rule
83 of the Rules of Court by the parties in posse&_,,0.!l and
control of her husband's estate, or her share in the c,:mjugal
partn~rship.
• · The Court granted the Motion for Payment of Widow's
Allo~ ance and ordered petitioners jointly and severally to
pay RG.sita P25,000.00 as the widow's allowance to be taken
fromJ;}e estate of Sy Bang until the estate is finally settled
or until further orders from the Court.
•

Meanwhile, respondents filed a Joint Petition for the
Guardianship of the Incompetent Rosita Ferrera-Sy
before the RTC of Lucena City, Branch 58. On May 19,

Order Court Deposit of Widow's Allowance Ordered by the
Supreme Court.
The guardianship court issued an order directing the
respondents to deposit before such court certain amount
representing the widow's allowance of the incompetent
Rosita. Respondent became her guardian. Petitioners
questioned the order.

issUES: J.

Whether or not the trial court, acting as a
Guardianship Court, had authority to enforce payment of
widow's allowance.
Whether or not the payment of widow's allowance
2.
should not be implemented as the estate of Sy Bang- the source
from which payment is to be taken - has not been detennined
'
·with finality.

SUPREME C(?URT'S RULING:
FIRST ISSUE: No, the guardianship court exerc1smg special
~d limited jurisdiction cannot actually order the delivery of the
property of the ward found to be embezzled, conce~ed, or conveyed.
It is the court hearing the settlement of the estate that should effect
the payme¥t of widow's allowance considering that th~ properties of
•
the estate are within its jurisdiction.
Section 3, Rule 83 of the Rules of Court states:
SEC. 3. Allowance to widoi.p and fam ily. -The widow and
minor or incapacitated children of a deceased person, during
the settlement of the estate, shall receive therefrom, under the
direction of the court, such allowance as are provided by law.
Correlatively, Article 188 of the Civil Code states:
Art. 188. From the common .tnass of property support shall
be given to the surviving spouse and to the children during the
liquidation of the inventoried property and until what belongs
to them is delivered; but from this shall be deducted that
amount received for support which exceeds the fruits or rents
pertaining to them .

Obviously, "the court" referred to in Section 3,.Rule 83
,
o.f the Rules of Court is the court hearing the settlement of

'- . ~

the estate. Also crystal clear is the provision of the law thnt
the widow's allo~ance is to· be taken from the common :tna88
of property forming part of the estate of the decedent.
Thus, as evident from the foregoing provisions, it ia
the court hearing the settlement of the estate that should
effect the payment of widow.'s allowance considering that
the properties of the estate are within its jurisdiction, to
the exclusion of all other courts. The guardianship court
exercising special and limited jU{isdiction cannot ~ctuaUy
order the delivery of the p_roperty of the ward found to be
embezzled, concealed,,or conveyed.
SECOND ISSUE: The widow's allowance is chargeable to Sy
Bang's estate. That the full extent of Sy Bang's estate has not Yet
been determined is no excuse from complying with this Court's
o~der. Properties of the estate have been identified - i.e., those in
the names of petitioners - thus, these properties should be made to
answer for the widow's allowance. In any case, the amount Rosita
receives for support, which exceeds the fruits or rents pertaining to
her, will be deducted from her share of the estate.

fo~ the adm1rustra:t10n of the estate and which powers he can exercise
without leave of court. It has long been held that the constitution of

leave of court 1s notreqUired. (San Diego v. Nombre, et al., L-19265

2.00 IS AN EXECUTOR OR ADMINISTRATOR CHARGEABLE WITH
ALL ESTATE AND INCOME?

2.04 DISCUSS THE ADMINISTRATOR'S DUTY TO RENDER AN
ACCOUNTING.

Yes, Section 1 of Rule 85 provides that, as a rule, every executor
or administrator is chargeable in his account with the whole of the
• estate of the deceased which has come into his possession, at the
value of the appraisement contained in the inventory; with all the
interest, profit, and income of such estate; and with the proceeds of
so much of the estate as is sold by him, at the price at which it was
sold.

The administrator or executor is under obligation to render a
true and just account of his administration to the court. Hearing is
held before an administrator's account is approved, especially if an
interested party raises objections to certain items in the accounting
report. At that hearing, the practice is for the administrator to take
the witness stand, testify under oath on bis accounts and identify
the receipts vouchers and documents evidencing his disbursements
which are offered as exhibits. He may be interrogated by the court
and cross-examined by the oppositor's c0unseL Th~ oppositors may
present proofs to rebut the administrator's evidence in support of
his accounts. (De Guzman v. De Guz man-Carillo, 83 SCRA 256, 260)

To recover attorney's fees, the attorney may either bring an
independent action personally against the executor or administrator,
or file a petition in the administration proceedings for the probate
court to allow the same and to direct the payment of his fee as an
expense of administration. (Aldamiz, etc. u. Judge of the CFI of

of any part of the estate. He must account for the excess when
he sells any part of the estate for more than appr&isement,

settles any claim against the estate for less than its n()minal
value, he is entitled to charge in his account only the amount
he actually paid on the settlement."

2.05 IS THE ONE YEAR (ONE) PERIOD TO RENDER AN ACCOUNTING MANDATORY?

Yes, the rendering of an accounting by an administrator of his
administration within one year from his appointment is mandatory,
as shown by the word "shall.,, under Section 8 of Rule 85. The only
exception is when the court otherwise directs because of extensions
of the time for presenting claims against the estate or for paying the
debts or disposing the assets of the estate. (Kalaw u. l ~termediate

2.06 MAY A PARTY WHOSE CLAIM IS CONTINGENT COMPEL THE
ADMINISTRATOR TO RENDER AN ACCOUNTING?

Section 3 clearly provides that no executor or administrator
shall be accountable for debts due the deceased which remain
uncollected without his fault.

The administrator is required to render an account of his
administration within one year from receipt of the letters of
administration. There are reliefs available to compel an administrator to perform either duty, but a person whose claim against the

place of examining and allowing the account of the executor or
adminis~ato r;
2) Section 7(b) of Rule 89 concerning the petition to

Yes, upon the death of a person, all his property is burdened
)Vith all his debts, his death creating an equitable lien thereon for the
benefit of the creditors. And such lien continues until the debts are
extinguished either by the payment, prescription, or satisfaction in
one of the modes recognized by law. (Suiliong and Co. v. Chio Taysan,

1.01 WHAT IS THE SO-CALLED "STATUTE OF NON-CLAIMS"

It is the period fixed by law for the fifuig of the daims against
the estate. The rule mandates certain creditors of a deceased person
to present th~ir claims for examination and allowance within a
specified period, the purpose thereof being to seltle the estate with
dispatch, so that the residue may be delivered to the persons entitled
thereto without their being afterwards called upon to respond in
actions for claims, which, under the or~ary statute of limitations,
have not yet prescribed. (Santos v. Manarang, 27 Phil. 213)

Now, the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure under Rule 3 of Section

As expressly provided under Section 2, RuJe 8 of the Rules
of Court, A may file a · money claim based on the decision rendered
against the estate of the deceased at any time before an order of
distribution is entered upon application.

2.00 WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PUBLICATION OF NOTICE
TO CREDITORS?
The publication of the notice to creditors is constructive notice
to all, hence a creditor cannot be permitted to file his claim beyond
the period fixed in said notice on the bare ground that he had no
knowledge of the administration proceedings. (Villanueva v. PNB,
L-18403, September 30, 1963)

2.01 ENUMERATE THE TYPES OF CLAIM THAT MUST BE FILED
WITH THE PROBATE COURT UNDER THE NOTICE.
.
1) .All mo~ey claims against the decedent arising from
contract, express or implied, whether the same be due, not due, or
contingent;

2)

All claims for funeral expenses and expenses for the l~ st

sickness of the decedent; and

3) Judgment for money against the decedent. The ~udgment
must be presented as a claim against the_estate, w ~ "l'• n. iudgment
debtor dies before levy on execution of his propert1e;e;.
2.02 IS PERSONAL NOTICE UNDER SECTION 4, RULE 76 OF THE
RULES OF COURT (NOTICE OF TIME AND PLACE OF PRO·
BATE-PROCEEDINGS) A JURISDICTIONAL REQUIREMENT IN ·
TESTATE OR INTESTATE SETTLEMENT OF A DECEASED'S
ESTATE? .
No, person'"~ notice to the heirs is not a jurisdictional
requirement in the settlement of estate of decea~ed persons . A
testate or intestate settlement of a deceased's estate 1s a proceedmg
in rem, such that the publication under Section 3 of the same Rule
vests the court with jurisdiction over all persons who are interested
therein.

2.03 WHICH RULE SHALL PREVAIL IN CASE OF CONFLICT BETWEEN SECTION 5 OF RULE 86 AND SECTION 11 OF RULE 6?
The specific provisions of Section 5, Rule 86 of the Rules of
Court should prevail over the general provisions of Section 11, Rule
6 of the Rules of Court. The settlement of the estate of deceased
persons (where daims against the deceased should be filed) i.s
primarily governed by the rules on special proceedings, while the
rules provided for ordinary claims, including Section 11, Rule 6 of
the Rules of Court, merely apply suppletorily. (Metropolitan Bank
and Trust Company v. Absolute Management Corporation., 688
SCRA 225)
For academic purposes, Section 5, Rule 86 of the Rules of Court
provides:

"Sec. 5. Claims which must be filed under the notice.
If not filed, barred; exceptions. - All clqims for money
against the decedent, arising from contract, erpress or
implied, whether the same be due, not due, or contingent,
all claims for funeral expenses and expenses for the last
sickness of the decedent, and judgment for money against
the decedent, must be filed within the time limited in
the notice; otherwise they are barred forever, except that
they may be set forth as counterclaims in any action that
the executor or administrator may bring against the
claimants. Where an executor or administrator commences
an action, or prosecutes an action c;ilready commenced by
the deceased in his lifetime, the debtor may set forth by
answer the claims he has against the decedent, instead
of presenting them independently to the court as herein
provided, and mutual claims may be set off against each
other in such action; and if final judgment is rendered in
favor ol the defendant, the amount so determined shall be
considered the true balance against the estate, as though
the claim had been presented directly before the court in

Yes, claims other than for money, debt or interest thereon
arising from contract cannot be presente d in the testate or intestat~

·

2.05 WHAT IS THE MEANING OF "MONEY CLAIMS" THAT MUST
BE FILED IN THE TESTATE OR INTESTATE PROCEEDINGS?
Money claims are 'claims for money, debt or interest thereon
upon a liability contract ed by the deceden t before his death. Claims
contracteci after his death cannot, therefore, be presente d with the
exception of funeral expense s and expense s incurred on the last
sickness of the decedent.
Section 5, Rule 86 of the Rules of Court expressly allows the
prosecution of money claims arising from a contracl " · ns t the

If the said claims are not filed within t he time limit in the

During the trial, but after the presentation of plaintift's

then filed a motion to d1smiss the action on the ground
his client's death. The court denied the motion to dismiss
and, instead, directed counsel to furnish the court with the
names and addresses of Dioscoro's heirs and ordered that the
designated a~strator of Dioscoro's estate 'be substituted
_,_as representati~e party.

After trial, the court rendered judgment in favor

issuance of the writ of execution proper? Exphi~zt.
SUGGESTED ANSWER:

The court's issuance of the writ of execution was not proper.
Under Rule 3 of Section 20, a favorable judgment in a contractual ·
money claim sh~ll be enforced in the manner especially provided
in the Rules
prosecuting claims against the estate of a deceased
person. Under Ruj e 86 of the Rules of Court, a judgment for money
should be filed as a money claim with the probate court. The Supreme
Court has held that .a money claim cannot be enforced by a writ of
execution but should instead be filed as a money claim.

Rule 86 - Clnirrui Against Estate

EDIES AVAILABLE TO A MORTGAGE CREDITOR UPON THE
DEATH OF THE MORTGAGOR?

The alternative remedies provided under this Rules are the
following:
1)
To waive the security mortgage and claim the entire
debt from the estate as an ordinary claim. By filing money
claim against the estate he is deemed ~o have abandoned the
mortgage and thereafter he cannot file a foreclosure suit if be
fails to recover his money claim against the estate;
2)
To foreclose the mortgage judicially and prove any
deficiency as an ordinary claim. The foreclosure suit should be
against the executor or administrator as party defendant. In
the event 't hat a creditor fails to fully recover his claim, he may
obtain deficiency judgment and file it as a claim against th~
estate in the manner provided by this Rule;
3) . To rely solely upon the mortgage and foreclose
the same at any time before it is barred by prescription
without right to claim for any deficiency. This mode includes
extrajudicial foreclosure of sale and its exercise precludes one
from recovery any balance of indebtedness against the estate
and frees the estate from further liability.

Thus, a creditor who elects to foreclose by extrajudicial sale
waives all his rights to recover against the estate of the deceased
debtor for any deficiency remaining unpaid after the sale. It can be
readily seen that the decision in this case will impose a burden upon
the estates of deceased persons who have mortgaged real'property
for the security of debts, without any compensatory advantage.

4.01 EXPLAIN THE TERM "ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES" AVAILABLE TO THE MORTGAGE CREDITOR.

In our jurisdiction, the remedies available to the mortgage
creditor are deemed alternative and not cumulative. Notably, an
election of one remedy operates as a waiver of the other. For this
Purpose, a remedy is deemed chosen upon the filing of the suit
for collection or upon the filing of the complaint in an ~ction for
foreclosure of mortgage, pursuant to the provision of Rule 68 of the

SUGGESTED ANSWER:

,c. X's claim was disallowed.
(1) Does the probate court still have jurisdiction io allow
the claim of D's administrator by way of _offset? Why?

The probate court has no jurisdiction to allo~ the claims of D's
administrato r by way of offset because it appears that there is no
amount against which to offset the claim.

Section 10 of Rule 86 provides:
''Within fifteen (15) days ·after service of a copy of the
claim on the executor·oi.· administrator, he shall file his answer
admitting or denying the claim specifically, and setting forth
the admission or denial. If he has no knowledge sufficient to
• enable him to admit or deny specifically, he shall state such
want of knowledge.

(2) Suppose D's administra tor did not allege any claim
against X by way of offset. Can D's administra tor prosecute
the claim in an independen t proceeding ? Why?

SUGGESTED ANSWER:

The executor or administrato r in his answer shall allege
in offset any claim which the decedent before death had against
the claimant, and his failure to do so shall bar the claim
forever. A copy of the answer shall be served by the executor or
administrato r on the claimant. The court in its discretion may
_extend th~ time for filing such answer."
4.03 IS THE-JUDGMENT OF THE COURT APPROVING OR DISAP·
PROVING A CLAIM APPEALABLE?

Yes, as provided under Section 13 of Rule 86, a judgment u_
court approving or disapproving a claim shall be appealable.
4.04 AS A GENERAL.RULE, A PROBATE COURT HAS ~,1 .J JURISDICTION TO ENTERTAIN A CLAIM IN FAVOR OF THE ESTATE
AGAINST A THIRD PERSON AS THE SAME MUST BE THE
SUBJECT OF AN ORDINARY ACTION. CITE THE EXCEPTION
TO THIS RULE.

The exception to·t his Rule is provided under Section 10 of Rule
86. It authorizes th~~xecutor or administrato r to interpose any
counterclaim in offset ·of a claim against the estate. Said counterclaim
i~ regarded as a compulsory counterclaim as the failure to file the
same shall bar the claim forever .

D's administrato r can proceed with the claim in.an independent
action since the claim of X was disallowed. Where X had a valid
claim and D's administrato r did not allege any claim against X by
way of offset, his failure to do so would bar his claim forever.

4.06 CASE
,

•
UNION BANK v. SANTIBANEZ AND ARIOLA
G.R. No. 149926, February 2'3, 2005
DOCTRINE: Well-settled is the rule that a probate court has
the jurisdiction to determine all the properties of the deceased,
to determine whether they should or should not be included
in the inventory or list of properties to be administere d. In our
jurisdiction , the rule is that there can be no valid partition
among the heirs until a~er the will has been probated.
The filing of a money claim against the decedent's estate
in the probate court is mandatory. This requiremen t is for the
purpose of protecting the estate of the deceased by informing
the executor or administra tor of the claims against it, thus
enabling him to examine each claim and to determine
Whether it is a proper one which should be allowed. The plain
and obvious design of the rule is the speedy settlement of the

The production and examination are nothing to be afraid of
since the intestate co.u rthas no authorit y to decide who the decedent 's
heirs are in connection with such incident which is confined to the
examina tion of docume'n ts which may aid the adminis trator in
determin ing properti '=s believed to belong to th e deceden t's estate.
~at is more, that court has no authorit y to decide the question
of whether certain properti es belong to the estate or to th e person

AB a general rule, a probate court cannot isst1e a writ of
· cution. As held by the Supreme Court inAldamiz u. Judge of CFI
:tMindoro, 85 Phil. 228, 233, a writ of execution is not the proper
procedure allowed b~ ~he R~es of Court for the payment of debts
and expenses of admimstration.
The proper procedlJ!e is for the court to order the sale of
personal estate or the sale or mortgage of real property of the
deceas~d and all debts and expenses of the administration should be
paid out of the proceeds of such sale or mortgage. The order for the
sale or mortgage should be issued upon motion of the administrator
and with the written notice to all the heirs, legatees an"d devisees
residing in the Philippines, according to Section 3 of this Rule, and
Section 2 of Rule 89. And when sale or mortgage !Sto be made, the
regulations contained in Section 7 of Rule 89 should be QOmplied
with.
1.01 ARE THERE EXCEPTIONS?

Yes, under the following circumstances, the probate court may
issue writs of execution:
To satisfy the distributive ·shares of devisees
1.
'
legatees and heirs in possession of the decedent's assets;
2.

To enforce payment of the expenses of partition; and

~- . To. satisfy the costs when a person is cited f or
exammahon m probate proceedings.
1,02 MAY THE COURT AUTHORIZE ANY PERSON TO DISPOSE OF
THE PROPERTIES OF THE ESTATE?

It is only the executor or administrator of the estate whom
the court may authorize to dispose of the properties of the estate

1.03 IS AN HEIR OR DISTRIBUTEE LIABLE FOR OUTSTANDING
CLAIMS AGAINST THE ESTATE?
Heirs are not required to respond with their own property for
the debts of their deceased ancestors. But even after.the partition
of the estate, the heirs and distributes are liable individually for
the payment of all lawful outstandin g ·claims against the estate
in proportion to the amount ·or value of the property they have
respectively received from the estate.
'the hereditary property consists only of that part which
remains after the settlement of all lawful claims against the estate
for the settlement of which the entire estate is first liable. The heir~
cannot, by any act of-their own or by agreement among themselves,
reduce the creditors' security for the payment of their claims. (Pavis

v. de la Raja, 8 Phil. 70)
2.00 WHAT MAY THE COURT DO IF A CONTINGENT CLAIM .FILED
IS VALID? .
The court .may order that sufficient estate be retained to pay
the contingent claim. Thus, Section 4 expressly states:

CHAPTER 2
Rulo 88 - Payment of the Debi.a or the FAtate

\67

It is expressly provided under Section 5:
"How contingen t claim becoming absolute in two

years allowed and paid; Action against distribute u
later. - If such contingent claim becomes absolute and is
presented to the court, or to the executor or administra tor,
within two (2) years from the time limited for other
creditors to present their claims, it may be allowed by the
court if not disputed by the executor or administra tor, and,
if disputed, it may be proved and allowed or disallowed by
·
the court as the facts may warrant.

If the contingent claim is allowed, the creditor shall
receive payment to the same extent as the other creditors
if the estate retained by the executor or administra tor
is sufficient. But if the claim is not so presented, after
having become absolute, within said two (2) years, and
allowed, the assets retained in the hands of the executor
or administra tor, not exhausted in the payment of claims,
shall be distributed by the order of the court to the persons
entitled to the same; but the assets so distributed may still
be applied to the payment of the claim when established ,
and the creditor may maintain an action against the
clistributees to recover the debt, and such distrµnrtees and
their estates shall be liable for the debt in proportion to th~
estate they have respectively received from the property of
the deceased."

"Estate to be retained to meet contingen t clcims.
- If the court is satisfied that a. contingent claim duly
filed is valid, it may order the executor or adminisL·,
retain in his hands sufficient estate to pay such contll'..., . ;;
claim when the same becomes absolute, or, if the estate is
insolvent, sufficient to pay a portion equal to the dividend
of the other creditors.!'
2.01 WHAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE IF SUCH CONTINGENT CLAIM
BECOMES ABSOLUlE AND IS PRESENTED WITHIN TWO (2)
YEARS FROM THE.J IME LIMITED FOR OTHER CREDITORS
TO PRESENT THEIRC LAIMS?
. T-he contingent may be allowed by the court if not disputed by
the executor or administra tor, and, if disputed, it may be proved and
allowed or disallowed by the court.

Rule 90, Section 1 of the Rules of Court provides that, when
the debts, funeral charges , and expenses of administration. the
allowance to the widow, and inherita nce tax, if any, chargeable
to the estate in accordance with law, have been paid, the court,
00 the application of the executor or admini strator, or of a person
interested in the estate, and after hearing upon notice, shall assign
the residue of the estate to the persons entitled to the same, naming
them and the proportions, or parts, to which each is entitled. and
such·persons may demand and recover their respective shares from
the executor or administrator, or any other person having the same
in his possession.
·
If there is a controversy before the court as to who are the
lawful heirs of the deceased person or as the distributive'Shares to
which each person is entitled under the law, the controversy shall be
heard and decided as in ordinar y cases.

No distrib ution shall be allowe d until -the payment of

Rule 90 -

FACTS:
The instant controversy stemmed from the settlement of
estate of the deceased Beatriz Silverio in which the RTC
ordered the sale of various properties of the intestate estate
of the deceased to partially settle estate taxes, penalties,
interests and other charges due thereon .
Among the properties authorized to be st,ld was the one
located at Forbes Park, Makati City, occupied by herein
respondent. The RTC further issued a writ of execution and
a notice to vacate the premises against her. Consequently,
this was opposed and the CA annulled and set aside the
Writ of Execution and Notice to Vacate issued by the RTC.
Hence, this appeal.

1.02 BAR Q. [2011) Multiple Choice

·As a rule, the estate shall not be distributed prior to the
payment of all charges to the estate. What will justify advance
distribution as an exception?
(A) The -estate has sufficient residual assets and the distribu.
tees file sufficient bond.
{B)

The specific property sought to be distributed might suffer

in value.

(C)

An agreement among the heirs regarding such distribu-

tion.
(D) The conformity of the majority of the creditors to such
distribution.

RICARDO S. SILVERIO, JR. v. COURT OF APPEALS
and NELIA S. SILVERIO-DEE
G.R. N?· 178933, September 16, 2009
DOCTRINE: Additionally, the above provision must be viewed
in the context that _the subject property is part of an estate and
subject to intestate-proceedings before the courts. It is, thus,
relevant to note tha!, in Section 1, Rule 84 of the Rules of Court,
the administrator may only deliver properties of the estate to
the heirs upon order of the Court. Similarly, under Section 1,
·Rule 90 of the Rules of Court, the properties of the estate shall
only be distributed after the payment of the debts, funeral
charges, and other expenses against ·the estate, except when
authorized by the Court.

Distribution and Partition of the Estate

or

ISSUES: 1)
Whether
not the authority granted by
the administrator allowing the respondent to remain in
possession of the estate property while its obligations remain
unpaid is valid or not.

2) Whether or not the CA serio_usly erred and/or
committed grave abuse of discretion arhounting , to lack of
or excess of jurisdiction in annulling the Order, the Writ of
Execution, and the Notice to Vacate because the respondent's
occupancy of the subject property will prevent the sale
authorized by the RTC to secure funds for the payment of taxes
due which are now high and rapidly increasing payment of
which must not be enjoined.
SUPREME COURT'S RULING: The alleged authority given by
Silverio, Sr. for the respondent to occupy the property is null and
void since the possession of estate property can only be given to
a purported heir by virtue of an Order from this Court. Seotion 1
of Rule 90 is explicit when it states that, "No distribution shall be
allowed until the payment of the obligations above mentioned has
been made or provided for, unless the distributees, or any of them,
give a bond, in a sum to be fixed by the court, conditioned for the
payment of said obligations within such time as the court directs."
In. fact , the Executor or Administrator shall have the right to the
Possession and management of the real as well as the personal estate
0 1 the deceased only when it is
necessary for the payment of the debts
and expenses of administration. (Sec. 3, Rule 84 of the Revised Rules

DOCTRINE: The facts obtaining in the present case do not call

ownership of Lot 829-~4-B. It bears stressing that the question
is one of collation or advancement by the decedent to an heir
over which the question of title and own&ship ca,_, be passed

FACTS:
Casimiro V. Madarang, Sr. (Casimiro, Sr. or the decedent)
died intestate on June 3, 1995 leaving real and personal
properties with an estimated value of P200,000.00. He was
survived by his wife Dolores and their five children, namely
Casimiro, Jr. , Jose, Ramiro, Vicente, and Corazon.
In the intestate proceedings filed by the couple's son Jose,
Dolores was appointed as administratrix of the intestate
estate of Casimiro, Sr. Dolores submitted an Inventory
Report listing the properties of the' decedent's estate. Jose
filed his Comment on the Report alleging that it omitted six
lots including Lot 829-~4-B which is covered by Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 125429 .
She alleged that the six lots had been transferred during the
lifetime of the decedent by a Deed of Donation executed in
August 1992 by his parents Dolores and Casimiro, Sr. and
therefore, should no longer be included in the inventory.

ISSUE: Whether or not the properties subject: bf a de~d Of
donation executed by the decedent during his lifetime should
be excluded from inventory of the estate of the decease.
SUPREME COURT'S RULING: The facts obtaining in the
present case do not call for the probate court to make a provisiona/
determination of ownership of Lot 829-B-4-B. It bears stressing that
the question is one of collation or advancement by the decedent
to -an heir over which the question of title and ownership can be
passed upon by a probate court.
Vicente's claim of ownership over Lot 829-B-4-B rests upon a.
deed of donation by his father (decedent) and his mother. Article
1061 of the Civil Code expressly provides:

Article 1061. Every compulsory heir, who succeeds
~ith other compulsory heirs, must bring into the mass of
the estate any property or right which he may have received
from the decedent, during the lifetime of the latter, by way of
donation, or any other gratuitous title, in order that it may be
computea in the determination of the legitime of each heir and
in the account of partition.

In relation to which, Section 2, Rule 90 of the Rules of Court
provides:
Sec. 2. Questions as to advancement to be determined.
- Questions as to advancement made, or alleged to have been
made, by the deceased to any heir may be heard and determined
by the court having jurisdiction of the estate proceedings; and

the final order of the court thereon shall be binding on

2.03 WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF A FINAL DECREE OF DISTRIBUTION?

A final decree of distribution of the estate of a deceased person
vests the title to the land of the ~state to the djstributees.

If the decree is erroneous, it should be corrected by opportune
appeal, for once it becomes final, its binding effect i~ like any other
judgment in rem, unless properl~ set_aside for lack of jurisdiction or
fraud. Where the court has validly issued a decree of distribution
and the same has become final, the validity or invalidity of the
project of partition becomes irrelevant. (Vda. de Kolayco v. Tengco,
207 SCRA 600)

2.04 WHEN DOES A . PROBATE COURT LOSE JURISDICTION OF
AN ESTATE UNDER AQMINISTRATION?

The probate court lose jurisdiction of an estate under
administration only after the payment of all debts and the remaining
estate delivered to the heirs entitled to receive the same. The finality
of the approval of the project of partition by itself alone does not
terminate the proceeding. As long as the order of the distribution
of the estate has not been complied with, tne probate ~roceedings
cannot be deemed closed and terminated. (Guilas v. Judge of CFI
Pampanga, 43 SCRA 111)

•

2.05 WHAT IS THE REMEDY OF AN HEIR WHO HAS NOT RECEIVED HIS SHARE?
"I,

If an heir has not received his share, his proper remedy is to
.ti le a motion with the probate court for delivery to him of his share .or
if the estate proceedings had been closed, he should file a motion for
reopening of the proceeding, within the prescriptive period, and not to
file an independent action for annulment of the project of partition.

The expenses of partition shall be paid:

(A Foresight to tho Bnr Exom ond the Practice of Lo w)

an Affidavit of Adverse Claim dated March 17, 2009
which was however denied registration by the responden~
RD on November 3, 2009. In their Complaint for Specific
Performance with Damages before the RTC of Malolos
Bulacan, the petitioners sought the delivery and return i~
their favor of the owner's duplicate copy of OCT P-1908 and
the execution of the corresponding Deed of Absolute Sale
~y wa_y of confirming the Bilihang Tuluyan ng Lupa. They
likeW1se prayed that OCT P-1908 be cancelled and a new
one be issued in their names.
In its decision, the RTC -held that petitioners' action is
premature on the ground that it was no.t shown that
the Probate Court had already fully settled the Estate
of Amanda, even the Huling Habilin had already been
allowed and certified. On appeal to the CA, the said court
affirmed the RTC's ruling and dismissed petitioners' appeal
due to the pendency of the probate proceedings before the
probate court. It cited Rule 90, Section 1 of the Rules of
Court which states that "no distribution shall be allowed
until the payment of debts, funeral charges, and expenses
of administration, allowance to the widow, and inheritance
tax have b~en made, unless the distributees or any of them
give a bond in a sum fixed by the court conditioned on the
p~yment of the said obligations."
Petitioners' Motion for Reconsideration having been denied "'"~
by the C .A., they filed before the Supreme Cour t their
petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the h ules
of Court.

ISSUE: May the petitioners compel: (1) the delivery a ,. :l return
in their favor of the owner's duplicate copy of 0 0 T P-1 908
and (2) the cancellation of OCT P-1908 and that new one be
issued in their name, despite the pendency of the settlement of
Amanda's estate?
SUPREME COURt~ RULING: The petitioners may compel the
delivery and return _~ their favor of the owner's duplicate copy of
OCT P-1908, despite ~the pendency of the settlement of Amanda's
estate. However, they cannot compel the cancellation of OCT
-P-- 1908 and the issuance of new title in their name.
. Article 777 of the Civil Code states that the rights of the inhentance are transmitted from the moment of the death of the de-

171

CHAPI'ER 2 ·
Rul o 90 -

Dis tribution ond Partition of the Esta t e

dent. Article 777 operates at the very moment of the decedent's
~:ath meaning that the· transmission by successi on occurs at the
recise moment of death and, therefore , at that precise ti me, the
~eir is already leg~ly deemed to have acq~ed ownershi_p of his~er
bare in the inhentance, "and not at the trme of declaration of herrs,
s r partition, or distribution." Thus, there is no legal bar to an heir
~sposing of his/her hereditary share immediately after such death.
The Court, early on in Teves de Jakosalem v. Rafols, et aL, explained
that a sale made by a legal or intestate heir of his share in an inheritance does not interfere with the administration o f the estate.
Here, upon the death of Amanda, Resurreccion became the absolute owner of the devised subject property, subject to a resolutory
condition that upon settlement of Amanda' s Estate, the devise is
not declared inofficious or excessive. Hence, there was no legal bar
preventing Resurreccion from entering into a contract of sale with
the petitioners with respect to the farmer's share or interest over the
subject property .

In a contract of sale, the parties' obligations are plain and
simple. The law obliges the vendor to transfer the ownership of
and to deliver the thing that is the object of sale to the vendee.
Therefore, as a consequence of the valid contract of sale entered
into, by the parties, Resurreccion had the =obligation to deliver the
subJ~ct property to the petitioners. In fact , it is no£ disputed that
the physical delivery of the subject property to the petitioners had
been done, with the latter immediately entering into possession of
the subject property after the ex ecution of the Bilihang Tuluyan ng
Lupa. Therefore, considering that a valid sale has been entered into
in the instant case, there is no reason for the respondents' heirs
to withhold from the petitioners the owner's duplicate copy of OCT
·
P-1908.
To reiterate, Resurreccion already sold all of her interest over
th~ subject property to the petitioners. Therefore, the respondents
heirs have absolutely no rhyme nor reason to continue ypssessing
the owner's duplicate copy of OCT P-1908. Nevertheless, the existence of a valid sale in the instant case "does not necessarily mean
~hat the RD may already be compelled to cancel OCT P-1908 and
issue a new title in the name of the petitioners. According to Section
92 of Presidential Decree No. (PD) 1529, otherwise known as the
~roperty Registration Decree, with respect to the transfer of propert~es subject of testate or intestate proceedings, a new certificate of
title in the name of the transferee shall be issued by the Re~ter of

filed with the Register of Deeds, and upon the presentation
of t~e owner,s· duP_licate certificate of title, new certificates
of title ~hall be issued to the parties severally entitled
thereto zn accordance with the approved partition and
distribution . "
Further, under Section 91 of P.D. No. 1529, even without an
order of final distribution from the testate/intes tate court and in
anticipation of a final distribution of a portion or the whole of the
property, the Register of Deeds may be compelled to issue the corresponding certificate of title to the transferee only when the executor/
administrat or of the estate submits a certified copy of an order from
the court having jurisdiction of the testate or intestate proceedings
directing the executor/ad ministrator to transfer the property to the
transferees. The said provision provides:

"Section 91. Transfer in anticipatio n of final

the testate or intestate proceedings directs the execu! ',. ·
administrat or to take over and transfer to the devisees '~,

might be entitled on final distribution , upon the filing of

transfer to be made upon the register in like manner as
in case~ / a sale, and upon the presentation of the owner's
duplicaJ~ certificate to the Register of Deeds, the devisees
or heirs concerned shall be entitled to the issuance of the
correspondi ng certificates of title. "
The aforement ioned sections of P.D. No. 1529 are in
perfect conjunctio n with Rule 90, Section 1 of the Rules of
Court, which states that the a:ctual distributio n of property

173

Rule 90 - Distribution ~nd Partition of the Estate

.....

subject to testate or intestate proceeding s, i.e., the issuance
of a new title in the name of the distributee , ·shall occur
onlY when the debts, funeral charges, and expenses of
irdJJlinistration, the allowance to the widow, and inheritance
ta.s., if any, chargeable to the estate, have been paid. Only
then can the testate ~r intestate ~ourt assign the residue of
the estate to the persons entitled to the same. Under Rule •
90, Section 1, the testate or intestate court may also order
the distributio n of the property pending the final order of
distributio n if the distributee s give a bond in a sum fixed
by the court conditione d upon the payment of the aforesaid
said obligations within such time as the court directs, or
when provision is made to meet those obligations .
Hence, under the applicable provisions of P.D. No. 1529
and the Rules of Court, it is only upon the issuance by the
testate or intestate court of the final order of distribution of
the estate or the order in anticipatio n of the final distribution
that the certificate of title covering the subject property may
be issued in the name of the distributee s.

In the instant case, there is no showing that, in the pendency
of the settlement of the E_sta~e o~ Amanda, th,.e P~obate_~our_t had
issued an order of final distribution or an order m anticipation of
a final distribution, both of which the law deems as requirements
before the RD can issue a new certificate "f title in the name of the
petitioners. To clarify, this holding does not go against Article 777. of
the Civil Code whatsoever. What the aforesaid Civil Code provision
signifies is that there is no legal bar preventing an heir from disposing his/her hereditary share and transferring such share to another
person, inasmuch as the right thereto is vested or transmitted to
the heir from the moment of the death of the decedent or testator.
The rule, however, does not state that the transferee may already
compel the issuance of a new certificate of title covering
,, the specific
property in his/her name.
Hence, reading Article . 777 ~f the Civil Code together with
the pertinent provisions of P.D. No. 1529 and the Rules of Court,
while"an heir may dispose and transfer his I her hereditary share to
another person, before the transferee may compel the issuance of a
new certificate of title covering specific property in his I h_e~ na'!7-e, a
final order of distribution of the estate or the order in anticipation of
t
the final distribution issued by the testate 01 ·"!,testate court must fi,_rS
be had.

In this instance, the case filed with the RTC was a special
proceeding for the settlement of the estate of Lourdes Reyes, Settled

FACTS:

A. Reyes are the ~hil~ren of Louraes A. Reyes and Pedro N~
Reyes. Lourdes died mtestate, leaving to her heirs, among
others, three parcels of land, including a lot covered b
Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 24475.
Y
Respondent filed a petition for settlement of the estat
praying for his appointment as administrator. Petitione:
and other parties opposed the petition. Later, a compromise
agreement was e:°tered into by the parties to partition
the estate of Lourdes Reyes. A Decision dated September
13, 2000 was rendered by the RTC based on the said
compromise agreement. Thereafter, petitioner filed . a
motion to cancel lis pendens annotation for TCT No. 244 75
in view of the finality of judgment in the ·settlement of the
estate.
-·

176

~

Respondent opposed the motion and claimed that the
parties, in addition to the compromise agi·eemer:t,
executed "side agreements" which had yet to be fulfilled.
One such agreement was executed between petih o
·1nd
respondent granting respondent a one-meter right 0 1 way
on the lot covered by TCT No. 24475. However, petitioner
refused to give the right of way and threate·1ed to build a
concrete structure to prevent access. Respondent countered

that, urJ,less petitioner permitted the inscription of the right
of way on the certificate of title pursuant to their agreement,
the notice of lis pendens in TCT No. 24475 must remain. ·
ISSUE: Whether or not the annotation of the lis pendens on
the title may 11e cancelled in view of the termination of the
settlement of estate case.
SUPREME COURT'S RULING: A compromise is a contract
whereby the parties, by making reciprocal concessions, avoid litiga·

is the rule that a probate court is a tribunal of limited jurisdiction..
It acts on matters pertaining to the estate but never on the rights to
property arising from the contract. It approves con.tracts entered into
for and on behalf of the estate or the heirs to it but this is by fiat of the
Rules of Court. It is apparent, therefore, that when the RTC approved
the compromise agreement the settlement of the estate proceeding
came to an end.
Moreover, a notice of lis pendens may be cancelled when the
annotation is not necessary to protect the title of the party who
caused it to be recorded. The compromise agreement did not mention
the grant of a right of way to respondent. Any agreement other than
the judicially approved compromise agreement between the parties
was outside the limited jurisdiction of the probate court. Any alleged
right arising from the "side agreemen( on the right of way can be
fully protected by filing an ordinary action for spki.fic performance
a court of general jurisdiction.

m

More importantly, the order of• the probate court
approving the compromise had the effect of directing thedelivery of the residue of the estate of Lourdes to the persons
entitled thereto under the compromise agreement. As such,
it brought to a close the intestat~ proceedings and the probate
court lost jurisdiction over the case, except only as regards to the
compliance and the fulfillment by the parties of their respective
obligations under the compromise agreement.
Having established that the proceedings for the settlement of
the estate of Lourdes came to an end .upon the RTC's promulgation
of a decision based on the compromise agreement, Section 4, Rule 90
of the Rules of Court provides:

·Sec. 4. Recording the order o/ partition of estate.
- Certified copies of final orders and judgments of the court
relating to the real estate or the p<,. •,:tion thereof shall be

recorded in the registry of deeds of the provj"TJ,ce where the
property is situated. ·

In line with the recording of the o·r der for the partition of the
estate, paragraph 2, Section 77 of P.D. No. 1529 provides:

f,ACTS:
Miguelita died intestate, leaving real properties. She was
survived by her husband, petitioner herein, and their two
minor children.
Petitioner filed with the RTC a verified petition for the
settlement of Miguelita's estate praying that letters of
administration be issued in his name, and that the net
residue of the estate be divided among the compulsory
heirs.
Respondent Miguelita's mother filed an opposition,
specifically to petitioner's prayer for the issuance of letters
of administration. Afterwards, she also filed a motion for
her appointmen~ as special administratrix.
Petitioner moved to strike out respondent's opposition,
alleging that the latter has no direct and material interest
in the estate, she not being a compulsory heir, and that he,
being the surviving spouse, has the preferential right to be
appointed as administrator under -the law.

Respondent countered that she has direct and material
inte~est in the estate because she gave half of her inherited
properties to Miguelita on condition ~hat both of them
"would undertake whatever business endeavor they
decided to, in the capacity of business partners."

DOCTRINE: The general rule is that the juris ,·' ,ct ion of the
trial court either as an intestate or a probate court relates
only to matters having to do with the settlement of the estate
and probate of will of deceased persons but does not extend
to the determination of questions of ownership that arise
during the proce~dings. The patent rationale for this rule is
that such court ~%e_rcises special and limited jurisdiction.

Petitioner filed with the intestate court an omnibus motion
praying, among others, that an Order be issued directing
the partition and distribution of the estate among the
declared heirs. Respondent opposed petit ioner's motion on
the ground that the partition and distribution of the estate
is "premature and precipitate," considering that there is
yet no determination ''whether ;the properties specified in
the inventory are conjugal, ·paraphernal or owned in a joint
venture."

A well-recogti'ized deviation to the rule is the principle
that an intestate or a probate court may hear and pass upon
questions of ownership when its purpose is to determine
whether or not a property should be included in the inventory,

ESCHEAT
(BAR QUESTIONS: 1997, 2002, 2012, 2018)
1.00 PURSUANT TO SECTION 1 OF RULE 91, WHEN IS A PETITION
FOR ESCHEAT PROPER?

. It is proper when a person dies without a will, leaving an estate
without any legal heir o.r person lawfully entitled to the same. It
provides:
I

"Section 1. When and by whom petition filed . When a pers<:m dies intestate, seized of real or personal
property in the Philippines, leaving no heir or person
by law entitled to the same, the Solicitor General or his
representative in behalf of the Republi(:·of the Philippines,
may file a petition in the Court of First Instan~e of the
·province where the deceased last resided or in which he
had estate, if he resided out of the Philippines, setting
forth the facts, and praying that the estate of the deceased
be declared escheated.''
1.01 WHAT IS THE CONCEPT OF ESCHEAT?

a. It is the falling of a decedent's estate into the geo'eral
property of the State on his death intestate without lawful heirs,
and is applied indifferently to all his rights to property of whatever
..,
nature. (21 CJ 848)
b. It is a proceeding whereby the real and personal property
of a deceased person become the property of the State upon his
de~th without leaving a will or legal heirs. It is not an ordinary
action, but a SJ)ecial proceeding, and commenced by petition and not
by complaint. (Municipal Council of San Pedro, Laguna, et al. u.

c.
Escheat is a -proceeding; unlike that ~f succession or
assignment, whereby the State, by virqie of sovereignty, steps in and
cl~ms the real or personal property of a person who dies intestate
leaving no heir. In the absence of a lawful owner, a property is
claimed by the State to forestall an open "invitation to self-service
by the first timers." (Republic v. CA, G.R. No. 143483, January 31

e.
The doctrine that the deposit represente d by a manager's
check automatica lly passes to the payee is inapplicable, because the
• instrumen t - although accepted in advance - remains undelivered.
When there is non-delivery of a manager's check, its assigned
fund is deemed to remain part of the account which procured it.
When there ts activity in t~e 'account that procured the manager's
check, the same cannot be escheated in favor of the government.

1.02 WHO IS THE REAL PARTY-IN-INTEREST IN ALL ACTIONS
FOR THE REVERSION TO THE GOVERNMENT OF LANDS OF
THE PUBLIC DOMAIN?

In all actions for the reversion to the Government of lands
of th.e public domain or improvements thereon, the Republic of
the Philippines is the real party-in-in terest. The action ~li 11 1e
instituted by the Solicitor General or the officer acting in his : ::ia,

Even if the decedent died testate but his will was not allowed

title to the same, or if sold, the municipality or city shall~
accountable to him for the proceeds, after deducting reasonable charges for the care of the estate; but a claim not
made within said time shaJ] be forever barred."

2,01 GIVE THE RATIONALE OF THE FIVE-YEAR TIME LIMITATION
TO BAR A PERSON FROM CLAIMING PROPERTY ALREADY
ESCHEATED TO THE GOVERNMENT.
a. Since escheat is one of the incidents of sovereignty, ihe
State may, and usually does, prescribe the conditions and limits
the time within which a claim to such property may be made. The
procedure by w~ich the escheated property may be recovered is
generally prescnbed by statute, and a time limit is imposed within
which such action must be brought. (Republic v. CA. G.R No.
J43483, January 31, 2002)

In this jurisdiction, a claimant to an escheated property
b.
must file his claim "within five (5) years from the date of such
judgment, such person shall have possession of and title to the
same, or if sold, the municipality or city shall be aci,ountable to
him for the proceeds, after deducting the estate; but a claim not

capriciously conjured by the State to defraud any"claimant; on the

before_the Court ~f Appeals. Ob'{iously, private respondent's belated
assertion of her right over the escheated properties militates against
recovery.
With the lapse of the five-year period, therefore, private
respondent has irretrievably lost her right to claim and the supposed
"discovery of the deeds of donation" is not enough justification to
nullify ~he escheat judgment which has long attained finality,

06 CAN DEPOSIT OR CREDIT BALANCE BE THE SUBJECT OF
ESCHEAT PROCEEDINGS?

(A)

5 years from date of judgment to file a claim.

2.

(B)

Z years from date of judgment to file a claim.

It depends. Escheat proceedings refer to the judicial process
in which the State, by virtue ,of its sovereignty, steps in and claims
abandoned, left vacant, or unclaimed property, without there being
an interested person having a legal claim thereto. In the case of
dormant accounts, the State inquires into the status, custody, and
ownership of the unclaimed balance to determine whether the
inactivity was brought about by the fact of death or absence of or
abandonment by the depositor.

(C) 5 years from date of resignation of the judgment to file a
claim.
(D) 2 years from date of resignation of the judgment to file a
claim.

2.04 CAN THE TRIAL COURT CONVERT AN ESCHEAT PROCEEDING INTO AN ORDINARY SPECIAL PROCEEDING?

No, t!us is not allowed by the rules. The two actions are entirely
different from each other and the requirements in vesting jurisdiction
are likewise different. In special proceedings, publication is once a
week for three consecutive weeks while in escheat, once a weE!Jr for
six consecutive weeks.
2.05 WHO HAS THE PERSONALITY TO CHALLE.NGt --,~e
CAPACITY OF A PERSON TO ACQUIRE OR OWt..i u;1,iO
BASED ON NON-CITIZENSHIP?
I

Under Section 7, B.P. Blg. 185, the Solicitor General or his
representative shall institute escheat proceedings against its
violators. Although t1)e law does not categorically state that only the
Government, throug~ the Solicitor General, may attack the title of
an alien transferee ofland, it is nonetheless correct to hold that only
the Government, through the Solicitor General, has the personality
. to file a case challenging the capacity of a person to acquire or to own
land based on non-citizenship. This limitation is based on the fact
that the violation is committed against the State, not against anY

If after the proceedings the property remains without a lawful
owner interested, to claim it, the property shall be .reverted to the
State "to forestall an open invitation to self-service by the first
comers." However, if interested parties have come forward and laid
claim to the property, the courts shall determine whether the credit
or deposit should pass to the claimants or be forfeited in favor of the
State. Escheat is not a proceeding to penalize depositors for failing
to deposit to or withdraw from their accounts. It is a proceeding
whereby the State compels the surrender to it of unclaimed deposit
balances when there is substantial ground for a belief that they have
been abandoned, forgotten , or without an owner. (RCBC v. Hi-Tri

2.07 MAY THE FUNDS OF UNDELIVERED MANAGER'S CHECK BE
THE SUBJECT OF ESCHEAT?

The doctrine that the deposit represented by a manager's

SUPREME COURT'S RULING: Escheat is a proceeding, unlike
that of succession or assignmen t, whereby the State, by virtue of its
sovereignty, steps in and claims the real or personal property of a
person who dies intestate leaving no heir.
A claimant'to an escheated property must file his claim "within
five (5) years from the date of such judgment, such person shall have.
possession of and title to the same, or if sold, the municipality or
city shall be accountable to him for the proceeds, after deducb g

defraud any claimant; on the contrary, it is decidedly prescribed to
encourage would-be claimants to be punctilious in asserting their
claims, otherwise they may lose them forever in a fi r,al judgment.

Any perso~ alleging to have a direct right or interest in the
property-sou,ght to be escheated is likewise an interested party and
may appear and oppose the petition for escheat. However, private

RULE 92

_ DEFINE GUARDIA~SHIP.
1 00
It is a trust relation of the most sacred character, in which one
rson, called a "guardian" acts for another called the "ward" whom
fie law regards as incapable of managing his own affairs.
A guardianship is designed to further the ward's well-being not
bat of the guardian. It is intended to preserve the ward's property,
t well as to render any assistance that the ward may personally
as
require.
i .01 DISCUSS THE BASIS OF GUARDIANSHIP.

Where minors are involved, the State acts as parens patriae.
It is the duty of protecting the rights of persons or individuals who
because of age or incapacity are in an unfavorable position uis-a-uis
other parties. Una~le as they are to take due care of what concerns
'them, they have the political community to look after their welfare.
This obligation the State must live up to. Parens patriae is inherent
in the supreme power of the State, whether that power is lodged
in a royal person or in the legislature and has no affinity to those
arbitrary powers · which are sometimes exerted by irresponsible
monarchs to the great detriment of the people. On the contrary, it
is the interest of humanity and for the prevention of injury to those
who cannot protect themselves. (Nery de Leon u. Rosqrio Lorenzo, et
al., G.R. No. L-23376, April 1, 1972, 44 SCRA 431)

1.02 DEFINE GUARDIAN.

A guardian is a person in whom the law has entrusted the
, custody and control of the person or estate or both of an infant,
insane or other person incapable of ma.q.aging his own affairs.

··- In guardianship of minors, it is the Family Court where the
minor resides.
1.08 WHERE IS THE VENUE OF GUARDIANSHIP CASES?

Venue is the place of residence of the minor or inr', tent
person. However, if the minor or incompetent resides outs-,Je the

incompetent may be situated.

1.03 CITE RELATED PROVISIONS OF THE FAMILY CODE 0
N
GUARDIANSHIP.
~he f~llowing provisions of the Family Code are related
to
guardianship, to wit:

~:· 222. The courts may appoint a guardian of
~he child s property or a guardian ad litem when the best
interests of the child so require.
ART. 223. The parents or in their absence or
.
incapacity, the i~dividual, entity or institution exercising
parental authority may petition the proper court of the
p~ac~ ~here the child resides, for an order providing for
disciplinary measures over the child. The child shall be
entitled to the assistance of counsel, either of his choice or
appointed by the court; and a summary hearing shall be
conducted wherein the petitioner and the child shall be
heard.
However, if in the same proceeding, the court finds
the petitioner at fault, irrespective of the merits of the
petition, or when the circumstances so warrant, the court
may also order the deprivation or suspension of parental
authority or adopt such other measures as it may deem
just and proper.

ART. 224. The measures referred to in the preceding
article may include the commitment of the child for
not more than thirty days or in children's homes duly
accredited by the proper government agency.
The parent exercising parental authority shall not
interfere with the care of the child whenever committed but
shall provide for his support. Upon proper petition or at its
own instanee~. the court may terminate the commitment of
the child w~e.,~ever just and proper.

. ART. 226. The property of the unemancipated
child earned or acquired with his work and industry or
by onerous or gratuitous ti tle shall belong to the child in
ownership and shall be devoted exclusively to the, latter's

support and education, unless the·title or transfer provides
otherwise.
The right of the parents over the fruits and income of
the child's property shall be lim ited primarily to the child's

the powers and duties of guardian for the full period during which
guardianship is necessary. (Francisco v. CA, 12 7 SCRA 371)

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS

200

Before the'Q_qurt is a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 45
of the R~les of_Court filed by Alamayri seeking the reversal
an~ se~mg aside of the decision of the Court of Appeals in
which it upheld the validity of the Deed of Absolute s'ale
executed by Nelly Nave in favor of siblings Pabale over a
parcel of land located in Calamba, Laguna.

The Pa bale siblings intervened as ·appellants in CA-G .R.
CV No. 58133 avemng that the RTC erred in declaring in
its December 2, 1997 Decision that the Deed of Absolute
Sale executed by Nave in their favor was null and void on
the ground that Nave was found incompetent by the Court
since the year 1980.
Alamayri contended that the Court of-Appeals erred by not
applying the principle of conclusiveness of judgment. He
argued that since Nave was already judici~lly determined
to be an incompetent in Special Proceeding No. 146-86-C on
June 22, 1980, then all contracts she subsequently entered
into should be declared null and void, including the Deed
of Sale in issue. The finding should retroact to _affect the
validity of the Deed of Sale subsequently executed in favor
of respondents Pabales.

ISSUE: Whether or not conclusiveness of judgment is
applicable in special proceedings.
SUPREME COURT'S RULING: No, contrary to Alamayri's
assertion, conclusiveness of judgment has no application to the
instant petition since there is no identity of parties and issues
between SP Proc. No. 146-86-C and Civil Casf No. 675-84-C.
}

SP Proc. No. 146-86-C was a petition filed with the RTC for the
appointment of a guardian over the person and estate of his late wife
Nelly, Nave alleging her incompetence.
•
A guardian may be appointed by the RTC over the person and
the estate of a minor or an incompetent.
A petition for appointment of a guardian is a special proceeding,
without the usual parties, i.e., petitioner versus respondent, in ·an
ordinary civil case.
The objectives of a Regional Trial Court hearing a petition
for appointment of a guardian under Rule 93 of the Rules of Court
is to determine, first, whether the person is indeed a minor or an
incompetent who has no capacity to care for hims~lf and/or his
P~operties; and second, who is most qualified to be appointed as
his guardian. The Rules reasonably assume that the people who
best could help the trial court settle such issues would be those
~ho are closest to and most familiar with the supposed minor or
incompetent, namely , his relatives living within the same province
and/or the persons caring for him.

3.01 CASE

VANCIL v. BELMES
G.R. No. 132223, June 19, 2001
DOCTRIN E: Section 7, Rule 93 of the Revised Rules of Court

confirms the designati on of the parents as ipso facto guardian
of their minor children without need of a court appointm ent
_
and only for good re~on may another person be named.

FACTS:
Petitioner Bonifacia Vancil is the mother of Reeder c
Vancil, a Navy servicem~n of the USA who died in the said
country on De~ember 22, 1986. During his_lifetime, Reeder
had two children named Valerie and Vincent by his common.
law wife, Helen G. Belmes. Petitioner commenced before
the RTC of Cebu City guardians hip proceedings over the
persons and properties of minors Valerie and Vincent. At
the time, Valerie was only six years old while Vincent was
a tw9-year old child. She was appointed legal and judicial
guardian over the persons and estate of Valerie Vancil and
Vincent Vancil, Jr.
On August 13, 1987, the natural mother of the minors,
Helen Belmes, submitted an opposition to the subject
guardians hip proceedings asseverati ng that she had already
filed a similar petition for guardians hip before the RTC of
Pagadian City. Helen Belmes followed her opposition with
a Motion for the Removal of Guardian and Appoint mt
of a New One, asserting that she is the natural mother tn
actual custody of and exercising parental authority over the
_subject minors.
The trial court rejected and denied Beirne-, motion to
remove and/or to disqualify Bonifacia as guardian of
Valerie and Vincent, Jr. and instead ordered petitioner
Bonifacia Vancil to enter the office and perform her duties
as such guardian upon the posting of a bond of P50,000.00 .
The subs~quen t attempt for reconsider ation was likewise
dismissea; .

ISSUE: Who betw~i'n the mother and grandmo ther of the minor
children should be their guardian ?
.SUPREME COURT'S RULING: Stress should likewise be made
that our Civil Code considers parents, the father, or in the absence,

...

203

the-mother , as natural guardian of h~:r minor children. The law on
parental authority unqer the Civil Code or P.D. No. 603 and now the
New Family Code (Art. 225 of the Family Code), ascribe to the same
legal pronounce ments. Section 7, Rule 93 of the Revised Rules of
court confirms the designatio n of the parents as ipso facto guardian
of their minor children without need of a court appointme nt and
onlY for good reason ~ay ~other person be named. Ironically, for
the petitioner, there 1s nothmg on record of any reason at all why
Helen Belmes, the biological mother, should be deprived of her legal
rights as natural guardian of her minor children. To give away such
privilege from Helen would be an abdication and grave violation of
the very basic fundamen tal tenets in civil law and the constitutio n
on family solidarity.
Even assuming that responden t is unfit as guardian of minor
Vincent, still petitioner cannot qualify as a substitute guardian.
It bears stressing that she is an American citizen and a resident
of Colorado. Obviously,, she will not be able to perform the
responsibilities and obligation s required of a guardian. In fact, in
her petition, she admitted the difficulty of dischargin g the duties
of a guardian by· an expatriate , like her. To be sure, she will merely
delegate those duties to someone else who may not also qualify as a
guardian.
The appealed decision is affirmed: with moa:ification in the
sense that Valerie, ·who has attained the age of majority, will no
longer be under the guardians hip of responden•t Helen Belmes.

FACTS:
On Septem ber 23, 1989, petition er Dinah B. Tonog gave
birth to Gardin Faith Belarde Tonog, her illegitimate
daughte r with private respond ent Edgar V. Dagmm 1,
0
A year after the birth of Gardin Faith, petitioner left for
the United States of America where she found work as a
register ed nurse while Gardin Faith was left in the care of
her father and paterna l grandpa rents.
On January 10, 1992, private respond ent filed a petition
for guardia nship over Gardin Faith in RTC Quezon City
which rendere d a judgme nt appointing private respondent
as legal guardia n and granting custody of Gardin. Edgar
moved for immedi ate execution of the said resolution but
was denied. A favorable decision was rendere d by CA.

ISSUE: Whether or not the fat her is entitled to be the legal
guardi an of his daught er.
·
SUPREME COURT'S RULING: Yes, in custody disputes, it is

axiomatic that th'e paramo unt criterion is the welfare and well.being of the child. In arriving at its decision as to whom custody
of the minor should be given, the court must take into account
the respective resources and social and moral situations of the
contending parents.

This general rule cited is not intended , however , to den.i gi•qtp
the importa nt role fathers play in the upbringing of their children.
Indeed, it is recognized that both parents "complement each ot~er
in giving nurture and providing that holistic care which ta~es into
account the physical , emotional, psychological, mental, social , and
spiritua l n~eds of the child." Neither does the law nor jurispru dence
intend to downplay a father's sense of loss when he is separated ·
from his child. --

'

.
While the· b~ ds between a mother and her small child
are
special in nature~ 1ther parent, whether father or mother, is bound
to suffer agony and pain if deprived of custody. One cannot say that
his or her suffering is greater than that of the other parent. It is not
so much the suffering, pride, and other feelings of either parent bµt
the welfare of the child which is the paramo unt consideration.

THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD
AND
THE TENDER AGE PRESUMPTION
JOYCELYN PABLO-GUALBERTO v
CRISANTO'RAFAELITO GUALBERTO
G.R. No. 156254, June 28,i?00S
SUPREME COURT'S RULING: On the issue of the custody of the
child, the Suprem e Court considered the following: •

THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD
A Primar y Consid eration
The principle of "best interest of the child" pervades
Philippine cases involving adoption, guardianship, support,
personal status, _minors in conflict with the law, and child custody.
In these cases, it has long been recognized that in choosing the
parent to whom custody is given, the welfare of the minors should
always be the paramo unt consideration.

..

Courts are mandated to take .cinto accowit all relevant
circumstances that would have a bearing on the children's wellbeing and development. Aside from the material resources and the
moral and social situations of each parent, otaer factors may also be '
considered to ascertai n which one has tlie capability to attend to the
physical, educational, social and moral welfare of the children .
Among these factors are the previous care and devotion
shown by each of the parents; their religious background, _moral
uprightness, home environment and time availability; as well as the
children 's emotional and educational needs.

that, as a general rule, a mother is to b~ preferred _m a~arding

of the Family Code cannot be ignored, except when the court finds

to have custody of her children in one or moi:.e, of the following
instances: neglect, aband9nment, unemployment, immorality,
habitual drunkenness, and drug addiction, maltreatment of the
child, insanity or affliction with a communicable disease.

i,05 CASE

But sexual preference or moral laxity alone does not prove
parental neglect or incompetence. Not even the fact that a mother
is a prostitute or has been unfaithful to her husband would render
her unfit to have custody of her minor child. To deprive the wife of
custody, the husband must clearly establish that her moral lapses
have had an adverse effect on the welfare of the child or have
distracted the offending spouse from exeI'cising proper parental
care.

f.ACTS:

CANIZA v. COURT OF APPEALs
G.R. No. 110427, February 24 ,

•

No, it does not limit its application to legitimate
children. This provision of the law known as the tender age
presumpti-~n is likewise applicable to illegitimate children.
Article 213 of the Family Code provides:

No child under seven years of age shall be
separated from the mother unless the court finds
compelling reasons to order otherwise."
In the recent case of Renaly n A. Masbate and Sp ouses Renr;i.to
Masbate and Marlyn Masbate v. Ricky James Relucio, G.R. No.
235498, July 30, ,2018, Leonen, J. , the Supreme Court ruled that
the second paragraph of Article 21 3 of the Family Code, does not
distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate children - and ·
hence, does no~factor in whether or not the parents are married
- in declaring bhat "no child under seven ((7)] years of age shall be
separated from tl}} mother unless the court find s compelling reasons
to order otherwise." 'Vbi lex non d istinguit nee nos distingu ere

not to recognize any distinction.

Caiiiza was ~he absolute owner of the property in question;
that out of kindness, she had allowed the Estrada spouses
to temporarily reside in her house, rent-free; that Camza
already had urgent need of the house on account of her
advanced age and failing health. Cafuza had asked the
Estradas verbally and in writing to vacate the house but
they had refused to do so. Guardian Amparo Evangelista
commenced a suit in the MetroTC of Quezon City to eject
the spouses Pedro and Leonora Estrada from the said

Judgment was rendered by the MetroTC in Cafuza's favor,
ordering the Estradas to vacate ti_e premises and pay
Caiiiza P5,000.00 by way of attorney's fees. On appeal,
the decision was reversed by the RTC holding that the
action by which the issue of defendants' possession should

Evangelista's duty to care for her aunt's person, to attend to her

i.03 CAN THE COURT ORDER THE DELIVERY OF PROPERTY OF
THE WARD FOUND TO BE ~MBEZZLED OR CONCEALED?
Generally, the guardianship court exercising special and limited
jurisdiction cannot actually order the delivery of the property of the
ward found to be embezzled or concealed. In a categorical language
of this Court, only in extreme cases, where property dearly belongs
to the ward or where his title thereto has been judicially decided,
max the court direct its delivery to the guardian.

When the minor resides outside the Philippines but has
property in the Philippines, any relative or friend of such minor,
01
anyone interested in his property, in expectancy or otherwise, may
petition the Family Court for the appointment of a guardian over
the property.

It is only when the market value of the property or the annual
. come of the child exceeds P50,000.00, the parent concerned shall
~nish a bond in such amount as the court may determine, but in no
ase less than ten per centum of the value of such property or annual
~come, to guarantee the performance of the obligations prescribed
for general guardians.

.

Notice of hearing on the petition shall be given to the minor by
publication or any other means as the court may deem proper. The
court may dispense with the presence of the non-resident minor.

If, after hearing, the court is satisfied that such non-resident is
a minor and a guardian is necessary or convenient, it may appoint a
guardian over his property.
_.1.14 ENUMERATl: THE CONDITIONS SET IN THE FILING OF A
BOND BY THE GUARDIAN UNDER SECTION 14.

1.16 AS THE NATURAL GUARDIAN OF THE MINOR UNDER PARENTAL AUTHORITY, PARENTS HAVE THE POWER TO ADMINISTER HIS PROPERTY. TO WHAT EXTENT DOES "ADMINISTRATION"lNCLUDE?
Administration includes all acts for the preservation of the
property and the receipt of fruits according to the natural purpose
of the thing. Any act of disposition or alienation, or' any reduction
in th·e substance of the patrimony of the child, exceeds the limits of
ad.ministration.
•
Thus, a father or mother, as the natural guardian of the minor
under parental authority, does not have the power to dispose or
encumber the property of the latter. Such power is granted by law
only to a judicial guardian of the ward's property and even .then
only with court's prior approval secured in accordance with the
proceedings set forth by the Rules of Court. (Napoleon D. Neri, et

ship which is called a trust.

In the instant case, a trust was established as evidence by
letter executed by Felisa during her lifetime which partly reads:
"Dear Delfin,
Ipinaaabot ko saiyo ang sulat kong ito upang malaman
mo ang aking nagiging damdamin. Hinihiling ko saiyo at
ipinakikiusap sa iyo tungkol doon sa late at building ng ·

Hindi naman kaila saiyo kung papaano ko ito naisalin
sa inyong pangalan nina Filemon C. Buenaventura Sr., Bella
Aluarez Guerrero at Delfin Guerrero Sr. Ang dahilan nito ay

Felisa's word in the above-quoted letter clearly declared hef
intention of transferring the title over the subject property to Bella, _
Delfin, Sr., and Felimon, Sr. in order to merely accommodate the'm
in securing a loan from the GSIS. It is likewise clear that she was
retaining her ownership over the subject property and articulated
her wish to have her heirs share equally therein.
1.03 DISCUSS IMPLIED TRUST.

Resulting (Implied) trusts arise from the nature or
circumstances of the consideration involved in a transaction whereby
one person becomes invested with legal title but is obligated in

No. The general rule is that an aGtion to compel a trustee to

adverse and, therefore, cannot ripen into a title by prescription.
However, prescription may arise where there is adverse
possession of the property. To constitute adverse possess:i'on, the
following requisites must concur: (1) that.the trustee has performe~
unequivocal acts of repudiation amounting to t~e ouster of the ce5 lui

_ ARE ADOPTION STATUTES LIBERALLY CONSTRUED?
1 01
Yes. It is .settled that . adoption statutes -as well

•
as matters of
procedure leading to adoption should b~ lib:rally cor:istrued to carry
out the benefic~nt_purpos~s of the adoption mstitution and to protect
the adopted child m the nghts and privileges coming to it as a result
of the adoption. (Republic v. CA, 205 SCRA 356)
The main purpose of adoption is the promotion of the welfare
of children. Acc?rdingl~, the law should be construed liberally, in a
!llanner that will sus~am rather than defeat the said purpose. The
law should also be applied with compassion, understanding and less
severity in view of the fact that it is intended to provide homes, love
care and education for less fortunate children. (Republic v. Vergara:
210 SCRA 206)

PRINCIPLES OF ADOPTION

1.02 WHAT IS THE PARAMOUNT CONSIDERATION IN ADOPTION
STATUTES?
1)

Adoption statutes, being humane and salutary, hold the
interests and welfare of the child to be of paramount consideration.
They are designed to provide homes, par;ntal care, and
education for unfortun ate, needy or orphaned children and give
them the protectio n of society and family, as well as to allow
childless couples or persons to experience the joys of parenthood
and give them legally a child in the person of the adopted for the
manifestation of their natural parental instincts. Every reasonable
intendment should be sustained to promote and fulfill these noble
and compassi onate objectives of the law.

It is defined as a juridical act, a proceeding in rem, which
creates between tJVo persons a relations hip similar to that which
results from legi~imate paternity and filiation .

1.03 WHICH COURT HAS JURISDICTION AND VENUE OVER
DOMESTIC ADOPTION CASES?-

Only an ado--ption made through the court is valid in this
jurisdiction. It is not a natural law at all, but is wholly and entirely

According to Section 6 of the Rules of Adoption, the petition for
adoption shall be filed with the Family Court of the province or city

where the prospective adoptive parents reside.

1.11 WHEN IS THE WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE BIOLOGICAL
PARENTS NOT NECESSARY?

It is not necessary if the subject of adoption is deemed as an
abandoned child. An abandoned child is a child who has no proper
parental care or guardianship, or whose parent(s) have deserted hill'l/
her fo~ a period of at least three continuous months, which include
foundling. (Sec. 2[3], R.A. No. 9523, An Act Requiring Certification.

of DSWD to Declare a Child Legally Availaole for Adoption as a
Prerequisite for Adoption Proceed_ings)

In this case, a certification from the DSWD -stating that the
child is legally available in a domestic adoption and in an inter.
country adoption proceeding is needed. (Sec. 8, ibid.)

1.13 WHOSE CONSENT IS NECESSARY TO EFFECT ADOPTION?
Section 9 of R.A. No. 8552 otherwise known as the "Dom tic
es
Adoption Act of 1998" provides:
After being properly counseled and tnformed of his/her
right t_o give or withhold his/h~r approval of the adoption,
the wntten consent of the followrng to the adoption is hereby
required:
(a)

The adoptee, if ten years of age or over;

(b) The biological parent(s) of the child, if
known, or the legal guardian, or the proper government
instrumentality which has legal custody of the child;

(1)

(c) The legitimate and adopted sons/daughters,
ten years of age or over, of the adopter(s) and adoptee, if
any;

(2)

(d) The illegitimate sons/daughters, ten years of
age or over, of the adopter if living with said adopter and
the latter's spouse, if any; and

Adoption has, thus, the following effects:
sever all legal ties between the biological parent(s)
except when the biological parent is the
adoptee,
and the
spouse of the adopter;
deem the adoptee as a legitimate child of the adopter;

and
(3) give adopter and adoptee reciprocal rir;hts and
. obligations arising from the relationship of parent ." •' · -~hild,
including but not limited to: (i) the right of the adL~ .. er to
choose the name the child is to be known; and (ii) the right of
the adopter and the adoptee to be legal and cm' ,-, ulsory heirs
of each other.
Therefore, even if emancipation terminates parental authority,
the adoptee is considered a legitimate child of the adopter with all
the rights ofa legitimate child such as:
(1)
(2)
(3)
rights.

to bear the surname of the father and the mother;
to r~ceive support from their parents; and
to be-entitled to the legitimate and other successional

Conversely, the adoptive parents shall, with respect to the
adopted child, enjoy all the benefits to which biological parents are

(e) The spouse, if any, of the person adopting or to
be adopted.

1.14 MUST HUSBAND AND WIFE JOINTLY ADOPT?
Yes, as a rule, husband and wife shall jointly adopt, except in
the following cases:
(i) if one spouse seeks to adopt the legitimate son/
daughter of the other; or
(ii) if one spouse seeks to adopt bis/her own illegitimate
son/daughter: Provided, however, That the other spouse has
signified his/her consent thereto; or

(ii.i) if the spouses are legally separated from each other.

CHAPTER 6 _ ADOP'I'.ION

(A Foresight to the Bar Exam and the Practice of I,.aw)

The Supreme Court has issued guidelines in "petitions
for adoptions under
R.A. No. 8552 and R.A. No. 8043
Basically, a petition for do1n:estic adoption under R.A. No. 855 2
will go through these steps:

[1]

[2]

[3]

[4]

I

.,,~

A lawyer prepares the petition for the person/a wh 0
wantis to ad~pt. The petition includes documents lik
birth certificates, marriage certificate, proof of financia~
capacity (such as ITR, bank deposit, etc.), clearances
(barangay, police, NBI, fiscal, court),"and others as proof
of good moral character,. good health, etc.
Upon payment of the filing or docket fee, the petition is
raffled to a Family Court (of the city nearest to the place
where the petitioner resides). If the petition is sufficient
in form and substance, the court issues an order, usually
within a month after the filing of the petition, setting the
case for initial hearing and ordering the court social worker to_conduct a case study and home visit.
The court order is published in a newspaper of general
circulation once a week for three weeks. The newspaper
is chosen by raffle conducted by the Office of_ the Clerk of
Court, in c9mpliance with a Supreme Court circular.
Before the initial hearing, the social worker conducts a
-case study and home visit. The social worker submits hls
investigation report and recommendatio ns to tbe court
before the initial hearing.

[5]

On the date of the initial hearing, the petitioner a n t• , 11e
prospective adoptee mu·s t be present. The lawyer presents
what are known as the jurisdictional facts (pet · sion, proof
of publication in newspaper, notice to the Uffice of the
Solicitor General, etc.).

[6]

If there is no opposition to the petition for adoption by any
party, then the lawyer asks the court permission for an ex
parte presentation of evidence, done only before the court
stenograpb,'er and the court appointed commissioner (the
branch clerk of court). The court, however, can require
presentation of evidence in open court.

IN RE: PETITION FOR ADOPTION OF MICHELLE P. LIM
G.R. Nos. 168992-93, May 21, 2009

DOCTRINE: Th~ law is cle~r. There is no room for ambiguity.
petitioner, having remar:'~d at the time the petitions for
adoption were filed, must Jointly adopt. Since the petitions for
adoption were filed· only by petitioner herself, without joining
her husband, Olario, the trial court was correct in denying the
petitions for adoption on this ground.
FACTS: Michelle and Michael who were 11 days old were brought to
the clinic of the Spouses Lim. They reared and cared for the children
as· th'eir own. When Primo died and Monina remarried, the new
couple decided to file a petition for adoption ofthe childre~ However,
the trial court dismissed the petition. Hence, this petition.

ISSUE: Whether or not petitioner, who has r;emarried, can
singly adopt.
SUPREME COURT'S RULING: It is undisputed that, at the
time the petitions for adoption were filed, petitioner had already
remarried. She filed the petitions by herself, without. being joined by
her husband Olario. The Court has no other recourse but to affirm
the trial court's decision denying the petitions for adoption. Dura
lex sed lex. The law is explicit. Section 7, Article Ill of RA No. 8552
reads:
SEC. 7. Who May Adopt. -The follow_ing may adopt:
(a) Any Filipino citizen of legal age, in possession of
full civil capacity and legal rights, of good moral char~cter,

the spouses to adopt Jointly. The rule also insures harmony between
the spouses.
The law is clear. There is no room for ambigcity. Petitioner,

having remarried at ~he time th~ ~etitions for adoption were filed,
ust jointly adopt. Smee the petitions for adoption were filed only
petitioner herself, without joining her husband, Olario, the

trial court was correct rn enymg t e petitions for adoption on this
ground.
!Il

Neither does petitioner fall under any of the three exceptions
numerated in Section 7. First, the children to be adopted are not
;he legitimate children of petitioner or of her husband, Olario.
Second, the children are not the illegitimate children of petitioner.
Apd third, petitioner and Olario are not legally separated from each
other.
The fact that Olario gave his consent to,the adopti~ as shown
in bis Affidavit of Consent does not suffice. There are certain
requirements that Olario must comply being an American citizen.
He must meet the qualifications set forth in Sectitm 7 of R.A. No.
8552 such as: (1) he must -prove that his country has diplomatic
relations with the Republic of the Philippines; (2) he must have been
living in the Philippines for at least three continuous years prior
to the filing of the application for adoption; (3) he_must maint~
such residency until the adoption decree is entered; (4) he has legal
capacity to adopt in his own country; and (5) the adoptee is allowed
to enter the adopter's country as the latter's adopted child. None of
these qualifications were shown and proved during the trial. )'
These requirements on residency and certification of the alie_n's
qualification to adopt cannot likewise-be waived_pursuant to Section
7. The children or adoptees are not relatives within the fourth degree
of consanguinity or affinity of petitioner or of Olario. Neither are th e
adoptees the legitimate children of the petitioner.

FACTS:
~~ February 4: 2002, Diwata Ramos Landingi n, a
c1t1zen of the Uruted ·States of America (USA), of Filipino
parentag e and a resident of Guam, USA, filed a petition for
the adoption of minors Elaine Dizon Ramos who was born
on August 31, 1986; Elma Dizon Ramos, who was born on
Septemb er 7, 1987; and Eugene Dizon Ramos who was bor
11
on August 5, 1989. The minors are the natural children of
Manuel Ramos, pe~itione r's brother, and Amelia Ramos.

Landingi n, as petitione r, alleged in her petition that when
Manuel died on May 19, 1990, the children were left to their
paternal grandmo ther, Maria Taruc Ramos; their biological
mother, Amelia, went to Italy, re-marrie d there and now
has two •children by her second marriage and no longer
commun icated with her children by Manuel Ramos nor
with her in-laws from the time she left up to the institutio n
...,,
of the adoption ; the minors are being financiall y supported
by the petitione r and her children, and relatives abroad;
as Maria passed away on Novembe r 23, 2000, pe~i
r
desires to adopt the children; the minors have given their
written consent to the adoption; she is qualified to adopt
as shown by the fact that she is a 57-year-o ld widow, has
children of her own who are already married, gainfully
employed and have their respectiv e families; she lives
alone in her own home in Guam, USA, where she acquired .
citizensh ip, and works as a restaura nt server. She came
back to~t_he Philippin es to spend time with the minors;
her cliil_1fen gave their written consent to the adoption
of the minors. Petitione r's brother, Mariano Ramos, who
earns substant ial income, signified his willingne ss and
commitm ent to support the minors while in petitione r's
custody.
0

the petitione r-appell ee is not financially capable to support
the three children .

SUPREME COURT'S RU~ING: The petition is denied for lack
f merit. It has been the policy of the Court to adhere to the liberal
~oncept, as stated in Malkinso n u. Agraua, that adoption statutes,
being humane and salutary, hold the interest and welfare of the child
to be of paramou nt considera tion and are designed to provide homes, •
parental care and education for unfortuna te, needy or orphaned
children and give them the protection of society and family in the
person of the !3-dopter as well as to allow childless couples or persons
to experienc e the joys of parenthoo d and give them legally a child
in the person of the adopted for the manifesta tion of their natural
parental instincts. Every reasonabl e )ntendm e~t should ~us be
sustained to promote and fulfill these noble and compassionate
objectives of the law.
Since the primary considera tion in adoption is the best interest
of the child, it follows that the financial capacity of prospective parents should also be carefully evaluated and considered. Certainly ,
the adopter should be in a position to support the would-be adopted
child or children, in keeping with the means of the family accord¥ig
to the Adoption Home Study Report forwarded by the Departme nt of
Public Health & Social Services of the Government of Guam to the
DSWD, petitione r is no longer supportin g her legitimate chil~en,
as the latter are already adults, have individual lives -and families.
At the time of the filing of the petitio_n, petitioner was 57 years old,
employed on a part-time basis as a waitress, earnin~ $~.15 ~ ho~
and tips of around $1,000 a month. Petitioners roam mtentlon ID
adopting the children is to bring the latter to Guam, USA. Sh~ has_a
house at Quitugua Subdivision in Yi.go, Guam, but the ~ame_ is still
being amortize d. Petitione r likewise knows that the limited rncome
might be a hindranc e to the adoption procl. 'lings.

1.02 USE OF MIDDLE NAME UPON DECREE OF ADOPTION,

IN THE MATTER OF THE ADOPTION
OF STEPHANIE NATHY GARCIA v. CATINDIG
G.R. No. 148311, March 31, 2005
ISSUE: May an illegitimate child, upon adoption by h
natural father, use the surname of her natural mother as her
middle name?
·
·
er
SUPREME COURT'S RULING:
_Liberal Construction of Adoption
'1t is a settled rule that adoption statutes, being humane and
salutary, should be liberally c~nstrued to carry out the beneficent
purposes of a~option. The interests and welfare of the adopted
child are of primary and paramount consideration, hence, every
reasonable intendment should be sustained to promote and fulfill
these noble and compassionate objectives of the law. Hence, since
there is no law prohibiting an illegitimate child adopted by her
naf;:ural father, like Stephanie, to use, as middle name her mother's
surname, the Court finds no reason why she should not be allowed
to do so." The Supreme Court further explained:

Use of Surname Is Fixed by Law For all practical and legal purposes, a man's name is the
designation by which he is known and called in the community
in which he lives and is best known. It is defined as the word or
combination of words,by which a person is distinguished from other
individuals an·d, also, as the label or appellation which he bears for
the convenience of the world at large addressing him, or in speaking
of or dealing with him, It is both of personal as well as public interest
that every person mu.~t have a name.
The name of an individual has two parts: (1) the given or
proper name and (2) the surname or family name. The given or
'proper name is that which is given to the individual at birth or at
baptism, to distinguish him from other individuals. The surname or

JTlilY name is that which identifies the famil

As correctly submitted by both P"....;e th

regulating t e use o a m1 e name. Even Article 17T, of the Family
Code, as ame~~ed by R.~. No. 9255, otherwise known as "An Act

,Allowing Illegitimate _Children to Use the Surname of Their Father"
is silent as to what rmddle name a child may use.

'

Notably, the law is_ likewise silent as to what middle name

an adoptee may use_- Article 365 of the Civil Code merely provides
that "an adopted child s~all bear the surname of the adopter." Also,
Article 18_9 ~f th~ F~ily ~ode, enumerating the legal effects of
adoption, 1s likewise silent on the matter. xx x.
Justice Caguioa suggested that the proposed Article (12) be
modified to the effect that it shall be mandatory on the child to use
the surname of the father but he may use the surname of the mother
by way of an initial or a middle name. Prof. Bal,ane stated that they
take note of this for inclusion in the Chapter-on Use of Surnames
since in the proposed Article (10) they are just enumerating the
rights oflegitimate children so that the details can b~covered in the
appropriate chapter. xx x.
Justice Puno suggested that they agree in principle that in the
Chapter on the Use of Surnames, they should say that initial or
surname of the mother should immediately precede_the surname
of the father so that the second name, if any, will be before the
surname of the mother. Prof. Balane added that this is really the
Filipino way. The Committee approved the suggestion.

The Underlying Intent of Adoption Is in Favor of the Adopted

ChildAdoption is defined as the process-of making a child, whether
related or not to the adopter, possess in general, th~ ri~hts accor~ed
to a legitimate child. It is a juridical act, a proceeding in rem wh~ch
creates between two persons, a relationship similar to that whic_h

1.03 RESCISSION OF ADOPTION

ISABELITA S. LAH OM v. JOSE MELVIN SIBULO

(previou sly referred to as "DR. MELVIN S. LAHOM")
G.R. No. 143989, July 14, 2003

DOCTRINE: Whil~ R.A No. 8552 has unquali fiedly withdrawn
{~om an adopter a consequ_ential right to rescind the adoption
decree even in cases where the adoption might clearly turn
out to be undesira ble, it remains , neverthe less, the bounden
duty of the Court to apply the law. Dura lex sed lex would be
the hackney ed truism that those caught in the law have to live
with. It is still notewor thy, however, that an adopter, while
barred from severing the legal ties of adoption , can always
for valid reasons cause the forfeitur e of certain benefits
otherwis e accruin g to an undeser ving child. For instance;
upon the grounds recogniz ed by law, an adopter may deny to
an adopted child his legitime and, by a will and testament,
may freely exclude him from having a share in the disposable
portion of his est~_te.
FACTS:

..:~
The bliss of marriage and family would be less than complete
without children. The realizatio n could have likely prodded
the spouses; Dr. Diosdado Laborn and Isabelita Lahom, to
take into their care Isabelita 's. nephew Jose Melvin Sibulo

·-

That in view of respondent's inse»sible attitude
resulting in a strained and uncomfortable relationship
between him and petitioner, the latter has suffered wounded
feelings, knowing that after all respondent's only motive
to his adoption is his expectancy of his alleged rights over
the propertie s of herein petitioner and her ·late husband,.
clearly shown by his recent filing of Civil Case No. 99-4463
for partition against petitioner, thereby totally eroding
her love and affection towards respondent, rendering the
decree of adoption , considering respondent to be the ~hild
of petitione r, for all legal purposes~ has been negated for
which reason there is no more _basis for its existence , hence
this petition for revocation."

Prior to the instituti on of the case, specifically on
22 March 1998, R.A. No. 8552, also known as the
Domesti c Adoptio n Act, went into effect. The new
statute deleted from the law the righ_t of adop.te\

ISSUE: Whether or not the subject adoption, decreed on 05
May 1972, can still _b e revoked or rescinded by an adopte
r
after the effectivity ·of R.A No. 8552.
S~REME COURT'S RULING: A brief background on the law
• 3:nd its origins could provide some insights on the subject. In ancient
times, the Romans undertook adoption to assure male heirs in the
family. The continuity of the adopter's family was the primary
purpose of adoption and all matters relating to it basically focused
on the rights of the adopter. There was hardly any mention about
the rights of the adopted . Countries, like Greece, France, Spain and
England, in an effort to preserve inheritance within the family,·
neither allowed nor recognized adoption. It was only much later
when adoption was given an impetus in law and still later when the
·w elfare of the child became a paramount concern. Spain itself which
previously disfavored adoption ultimately relented and accepted the
Roman law concept of adoption which, subsequently, was to find its
way to the archipelago. The Americans came and introduced their
own ideas on adoption which, unlike most countries in Europe, made
the interests of the child an overriding consideration. In the early part
of the century just passed, the rights of children invited universal
attention; the Geneva Declaration of Rights of the Child of 19~4
and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, followed
by the United Na~ions Declarations of the Rights of the Child, were
written instruments that would also protect and safeguard the
rights of adopted children . The Civil Code of the Philippines of 1950
on adoption, latey modified by the Child and Youth Welfare Code
and then by the __Family Code of the Philippines gave immediate
statutory acknowledgment to the rights of the adopted. In 1989,
the United Nations initiated the Convention of the Rights of the
Child. The Philippines, a State Party to the Convention, accepted
the principle that adoption was impressed with social and moral
responsibility, and that its underlying intent was geared to favor the
adopted child. R.A. No. 8552 secured these rights and privileges for

under the C1vi o e and the Family Code, the laws then in force.

It was."!'onths after the effectivity of R.A No. 8552 that
herein petitioner filed an action to revoke the decree of
adoption granted in 1975. By then, the new law, had already
abrogated and repealed the right of an adopter under
the Ci.vii Code ~nd the ~am~ly Code to rescind a decree of
adoption. Consistently with its earlier pronouncements, the
Court should now hold that the action for rescission of the
adoption decree, having been initiated by petitioner after
R.A. No. 8552 had come into force, no longer could be pursued.
, Interestingly, even before the passage of the statute, an action
:to set aside the adoption is subject to the ijve-year bar rule under
Rule 100 of the Rules of Court and that th~ adopter would lose the
right to revoke the adoption decree after the lapse of that period.
The exercise of the right within a prescriptive period is a condition
that could not fulfill the requirements of a vested right entitled
to protection. It must also be acknowledged that a person has no
vestPd right in statutory privileges. While adoption has often been
·l to in the context of a "right," tqe privilege to adopt is itself
reJ<
not n,1turally innate or fundamental but rathe.r a right merely
created by statute. It is a privilege that is governed by the St;te's
deter.o ;ination on what it may deem to be for the best interest and
welfare of the child. Matters relating to adoption, including the
withdrawal of the right of an adopter to nullify the adoptiop decree,
are subject to regulation by the State. Concomitantly, a right of
action given by statute may be take!} away at anytime before it has
been exercised.

1.03 WHAT IS THE -PURPOSE OF THE WRIT OF HABEAS COR
·
PUS?

1.04

EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF RESTRAINT.

Actual and effective, and not merely nominal or moral, restraint
is required. (Zagala v. !lustre, 48 Phil. 282)
However, actual physical restraint is not always required;
oy restraint which will prejudice freedom of action is sufficient.
(Moncupa v. Enrile, et al., G.R. No . 63345, January 30, 1986)
It is more than mere moral restraint; in fact, the law requires
actual or physical confinement. However, the fact that no physical
force was exerted to keep a person does not make less real the
deprivation of his personal freedom which includes the freedom of
movement, freedom to ~ransfer from one place to another, freedom
to choose one's residence. Freedom may be lost due to internal moral
compulsion, to founded or groundless fear, to erroneous belief in the
existence of an imaginary power of an impostor to cause harm if not
blindly obeyed, to any other psychological element, that may curtail
the mental faculty of choice or the unhampered exercise of the will.
If the actual effect of such psychologicaf spell is to place a person
at the mercy of another, the victim is entitled to \ he protection of
courts of justice as much as the individual who is illegally deprived
of liberty by duress or physical coercion. (Caunca v. Salazar and
Justo, G.R. No. L-2690, 82 Phil. 851)
1.05 WHO HAS THE BURDEN OF PROVLNG ILLEGAL RESTRAINT?

As a general rule, the burden of proving illegal restz:aint by
the respondent rests on the petitioner who attaches such restraints.

him in what is alleged to be the unlawful authority. Hence,
the only parties before the court are the petitioner (prisoner)

question to be resolved is whether the custodian has authority
to deprive the petitioner of his liberty. The writ may be denied

The writs of habeas corpus and certiorari may be ancillary to
each other where necessary to give effect to the sup.ervisory powers
of the higher courts. A writ of habeas corpus reaches the body and
the jurisdictional matters. A writ of certiorari reaches the rec~rd but
not the body. Hence, a writ of habeas corpus may be used with the
writ of certiorari for the purpose of review .
However, habeas corpus does not lie where the petitione~ has
the remedy of appeal or certiorari because it will not be perrrutted
to perform the functions of a writ of error or appeal for the purpose
of reviewing errors or irregularities in the proceedings of a court
having jurisdiction over the person and the subject matter. (Galvez

2 WHAT FACTORS MUST THE COURT CONSIDER IN GRANT1
ING THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS?

Fundam entally, in o:rder to justify the grant of the writ of
habeas corpus, the restrain ~ of ~berty must be in t~e nature of an
·u al and involuntary depnvat1on of freedom of action. In general,
1 eg
·
d
·
h th
the purpose of the writ of habeas corpus IS
to e~ermm
e "':' e . er
or not a particul ar person is legally held. A_ prune ~peci:fication
of an application for a writ of habeas corp~s, m _fact, IS an a_c tual
and effective , and not merely nomina l or moral, illeg,tl restram t of
liberty. "The writ of habeas corpus was devised and exists as a spe~dy
and effectual ,remedy to relieve persons from unlawful restrain t,
and as the best and only sufficient defense of p~rsonal freedom. ~
prime specification of an application for a writ of habeas corp~ is
restrain t of liberty. The essentia l object and purpose of the writ_of
habeas corpus is to inquire into all m~er of involun tary restram t
as distingu ished from volunta ry, and to relieve a person there~o m
if such restrain t is illegal. Any restrain t which will preclude freedom
of action is sufficient."
In passing upon a petition for habeas corpus, a court or j~dge
must first inquire into whethe r the petition er is being_ r~~tr.amed
of his liberty. If he is not, the writ will be refused. l_nq\illy u~tO the
cause of detentio n will proceed only-where such resiram t exists. ~f
the alleged cause is thereaft er found to be unlawful, then the writ
should be gra~ted and the petition er discharged. Needless to state,
if otherwise, again the writ will be refused .

Courts of justice constitut ed to pass upon substant ial rights

Thus, th~ well-settled rule that courts !fill not determine a moot
question. Where the issues have become moot anq academic , there
ceases to be any justiciable controversy, thus rendering the resolution of the same of no practical value. The Court will, therefore ,
abstain from expressing its opinion in a case where no legal relief is

Rule 102 of the Rules of Court provides that the writ of habeas
corf us.is available in all cases .of illegal confinement or detention by
which any person is deprived of his liberty. The purpose of the writ
is to inquire into all manner of involunt ary restraint and to relieve
a person therefrom if such restraint is illegal. Here, Hercules was
locked up inside the police station jail without lawful reasons. It
constitut es illegal deprivation of his liberty.

SUPREME COURT'S RULING:
The release of persons in whose behalf the application for a
Writ of Habeas Corpus was filed renders the petition for the issuance

2.03 WHAT KIND OF RELEASE MUST BE EFfECTED TO RENDER
THE PETITION MOOT AND ACADEMIC?

A release that renders a petition for a writ of habeas corpus
moot and academic must be one which is free from involuntary
restraints. When the person so released continues to be denied one or
more of his constitutional freedoms, where there is a present denial
of due process, or where the restraints are not merely involuntary
but appear to be unnecessary, the person concerned or those acting
in his behalf may still avail themselves again of the pri,vilege of the
writ. (Moncupa v. Enrile, et al., G.R . N,o. 63345, January 30, 1986)

SPEClAL PROCEEDINGS

The writ of habeas corpus extends to all cases of illegal
confinement or detention by which any person is deprived of his
liberty, or by which the rightful custody of any person is withheld
from the person entitled t_h ereto. Thus, it is the_ prope~ legal remedy
to enable parents to regam the custody of a mmor child even if the
latter be in_the cus~ody of a third pe~son o~ his o":'111 free will. It may
even be said that m custody cases mvolvmg mmors, the question
of illegal and involuntary restraint of liberty is not the underlying
rationale for the availability of the writ as a remedy. Rather, it is
prosecuted for the purpose of determining the right of custody over a
child. (Emphasis supplied)

In a case, the RTC erred when it hastily dismissed the action
for having become moot after Maryl Joy was produced before the
trial court. It should have conducted a trial to determine who had
the rightful custody over Maryl Joy. In dismissing the action, the
RTC, in effect, granted the petition for habeas corpus and awarded
the custody of Maryl Joy to the Spouses Gallardo without sufficient _.,__
basis. (Noel B. Bagtas v. Hon. Ruth C. Santos, Presiding Judge df

were attendant to his arrest. The remedy of petitioner was to file a
motion for the dismissal of the Charge Sheet and the Mission Order
of the Immigration Commission er, not a petition for a writ of habeas
corpus before the RTC. The RTC had no authority to nullify the
Mission Order issued by the Immigration Commission er, much less
set aside the arrest of Javed Kiani.
'
Once a person detained is duly charged in court, he may no
longer question his detention through a petition for issuance of a
lurit of habeas corpus. His remedy would be to quash the information_
and/or the warrant of arrest duly issued. The Writ of Habeas Corpus
should not be allowed after the party sought to be released had been
charged before any court.

4.00 MAY HABEAS CORPUS BE GRANTED IF THE PRISONER

No. Petition for habeas corpus cannot be graQ.ted if the accused

sentence up to its maximum term. (Office of the Court Administrator

4.01 MA'( A WIFE SECURE A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS TO
• COMPEL HER HUSBAND TO LIVE WITH HER IN CONJUGAL
BLISS?

No, marit~ rights including coverture and living in conjugal
dwelling may not be enforced by the extraordinary writ of habeas
corpus. A writ of habeas corpus extends to all cases of illegal
confinement or detention, or by which the rightful custody of a
person is withheld from the one entitled thereto.
No court is empowered as a judicial authority to compci;
a husband to live with his wife. Coverture cannot be enforced 1. _,
compulsion of a writ of habeas corpus carried out by sheriffs or a1t:,
other process, This is a matter beyond judicial authority and is
best left to the man and woman's free choice. (llusorio v. Bildner,
G.R. No. 139789, 332 SCRA 169, May 12, 2000)
To justify the grant of the petition, the restraint oflil.erty must
be an illegal and involuntary deprivation of freedom of action. The
illegal restraint of liberty must be actual and effective, not merely
nominal or moral. (Erlinda K. flusorio v. Erlinda I. Bildner and

THE PRESIDENT'S POWER AND CONGRESS
IN RELATION TO THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS

a)

The President and Congress act in tandem in exercising the
power to proclaim martial law or suspend the privilege of the Writ
of habeas corpus. They exercise the power, not only sequentially
but in a sense jointly since, after ·the President has initiated th~
proclamation or the suspension , only the Congress can maintain the
same based on its evaluation of the situation on the ground, a power
that th~ President does not have. (Philip Sigfrid Fortun v. Gloria
Macapagal-Arroyo, et al., G.R. No. 190293, March 20, 2012)

The Cullamat Petition. "anchored on Section 18,
Article VIf' , of the Constitutio n, likewise seeks
the nullification of Proclamat ion No. 216 for being
unconstitu tional because it lacks sufficient factual
basis · that there is rebellion in Mindanao and that
public safety warrants its declaration .
The Mohamad Petition posits ·that m ~ law is a
c)
measure of last resort and should be invoked by
the President only after exhaustion of less severe
r~medies. It contends that the extmordin ary powers
of the President should be dispensed sequential ly,
i.e. , first , the power to call out the armed force~;
second, the power to suspend the privilege of the writ
of habeas corpus; and finally, the power to dec~are
martial law.
• The argument maintains that the President has no
discretion to choose which extraordin ary power to use;
moreover his choice must be dictated only by, and
commens ~ate to, the exigencies <;>f the situation.

IT IS WITHIN THE POWER OF THE PRESIDENT
TO SUSPEND THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS
LAGMAN v. MEDIALDEA
G.R .. No. 231658, July 4, 2017
Del Castillo, J.
FACTS:
Effective May 23, 2017, and for a period not exceeding
days, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte issued Proclamat ion
No. 216 declaring a state of martial law and suspending
the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in the whole of
Mindanao.

•

After the submission of the Report and the briefings,
the Senate issued P.S. Resolution No. 388 expressing

Lagman Petition claims that the declaration of
martial law has no sufficient factu!!-1 basis because
there is no rebellion or invasion in Marawi City or in
any part of Mindanao. It argues that a~ts of_ terrorism
in Mindanao do not constitute rebellion smce there
is no proof that its purpose is to remove Mi1:~an~o or
any part thereof from allegiance to the Philippme s,
its laws, or its territory.

5.01 LANDMARK CASE

Within the timeline set by Section 18, Article VII of the
Constitutio n, · the President submitted to Congress on
May 25, 2017, a written Report on the factual basis of
Proclamat io~ No. 216. The Report pointed out that for
decades, Mind,anao has been plagued with rebellion and
lawless violetp..~e which only escalated and worsened with
the passing oftirne.

Rule 102 - Habeas Couius

(A Foresigh t to the Bar Exam and the Practice of La YI)

A plain readin g of Sectio n 18, Article VII of the
Const itution shows that the Presid ent's power to declar e
martia l law is n9t subjec t to any condit ion except for the
requir ement s of actual invasi on or rebelli on and ·that
public safety requir es it. Besides, it would be contrary to
commo n sense if the decision of the President is made dependent
on the recomm endatio n of his mere alter ego. Rightly so, it is
only on the President and l'J:Oother that the exercise of the powers
of the Comma nder-in -Chief under Section 18, Article VII of the
Constit ution is bestowed.

SUPR E~E COURT'S RULING:

It was precis ely this time eleme nt that promp ted
the Const ituti.o nal Comm ission to elimin ate the requir ement of concu rrence of the Congr ess in the initial imposition by the Presid ent of martia l law or suspen sion of
the privile ge of the writ of habea s corpus .
Considering that the procla mation of martia l law or sus,pension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus is now anchored on actual invasio n or rebellion. and when public safety
requires it, and is _no longer under threat or in immine nt danger
1
thereof, there is a necessity and urgency for the President to act
1
•
quickly to protect the country.

a. - The Presid ent deduc ed from the facts availa bl
to him that there was an armed public uprisin g, th:
culp~b le purpo se of which was to remov e from th
alle~1a nce-to the Philip pine Gover nment a portio n ofit:
t~rrito ry and to depriv e the Chief Execu tive of any of
his. power s and prerog atives , leadin g the Presid ent to
behev_e that there was probab le cause that the crime 'of /
.rebelh on was and is being comm itted and that pubJ/8 <,_ 1safety requir es the impos ition of martia l law and :?: ·
suspen sion of the privile ge of the writ of habea s corpus , ..
A · review of the afores aid facts simila rly leads
the Court . to conclu de that the Presid ent, in issuing
Procla mation No. 216, had suffici ent factua l basis tendin g
to show that actual rebefl ion exists. The A ·esident's
conclusion, that there was an armed public uprising, the
culpable f!~rp~se of which was the removal from the allegiance
of th~ P~ilippine Governmen~ a portion of its territory and the
deprwa t~n of the President from perform ing his powers and
prerogatives, was reached after a tactical consideration of the
facts. In fine, thefres ident satisfactorily discharged his burden
·.
of proof
..:.!.

b. The recom menda tion of, or consu ltation with

milita ry officia ls, is not a condit ion for the Presid ent to
declar e martia l law.

The Court, as Congress does, must thus accord the
President the same leeway by not wading into the realm that
is reserved exclusively by the Co,:,.stitution to the Executive
Department.
Past events may be consid ered as justifi cation s for
the declar ation and/or suspen sion as long as these are
conne cted or relate d to the curren t situati on exisF - qt
the time of the declar ation.

As to what facts must be _state'd in the ptoclamatioi. _ud
the written Report is up to the Preside nt. As Commander-inChief, he has sole discretion to determ ine what to include and
what not to include in the proclamation and the written Report
taking into accou,n t the urgency of the situatio n as well as
natio~a l security.

"The Congress, voting jointly, by a vote of at least a
majority of all its Members in regular or special session.
may revoke such proclamation or suspension, which revocation shall not be set aside by the President."

In his Report, the President noted that the acts of violence

agamst civilians and their properties.

The requirement that "[t]he Congress, voting jointly, by a

Congress revokes the President's proclamation of martial law and/

7.06 BAR Q. [2008]
Habeas Corpus When Proper or Not Proper

After Alma had started serving her sentence for violation
of Batas Pambansa Big. 22 (BP 22), she filed a petition for
writ of habeas corpus, citing Vaca v. CA where the sentence
of imprisonment of 'a party found guilty of violation of Batas
Pambansa Big. 22 (BP 22) was reduced to a fine equal to double
the amount of the check involved. She prayed that her sentence
be similarly modifi°'e"d and that she be immediately released
from detention. In~ e alternative, she prayed that pending
determination on whether the Vaca ruling applies to her, she
b~ allowed to post bail pursuant to Sec. 14 of Rule 102 which
provides that if a person is lawfully imprisoned or restrained
on a charge of having committed an offense not punishable

bY death, he may he admitted to haii in the discretion of the

court, Accordingly, the trial court aHowed Alma to post bail
and then ordered her release. In your opinion, is the order of
the trial court correct?
soGGESTED ANSWER:
The order of the trial court is not correc~. Alma is not entitled to
bail as she is not a detention prisoner but already a convicted felon.
Section 2 of Rule 102 which allows th~ reme~y of haber:s corl!us to
ost bail is applicable only when the prisoner 1s a detention pnsoner

HABEAS CORPUS IN RELATION
TO RIGHTFUL CUSTODY OVER MINORS
8.00 MAY HABEAS CORPUS BE RESORTED TO WHERE RIGHT .
FUL CUSTODY IS WITHHELD FROM A PERSON ENTITLED
•
THERETO?

Yes, a~ stated earlier, the writ of habeas corpus shall extend to

all cases of illegal confine ment or detentio n by which any perso 18

is withhel d from the person entitled thereto except as other~osen

Thus, in the case of Marie Antone tte Abigail, et al. v. Abanilla
G.R. No. 16273~, August 29, 2006, the Suprem e Court explain ed
that ha_be~ corpus may be resorted to in cases where rightful
custody Is withhel d from a person entitled thereto under Article 211
of the Family Code.

In the above-s tated case, respond ent Loran and petition er

the court. In the absence of a judicial grant of custody to one parent,
both parents are still entitled to the custody of their child. In the
present case, private respond ent's cause of action is the deprivation
of his rig~t to see his child as alleged in his petition . Hence, the
Court ruled that the remedy of habeas corpus is availa l:.le to him .
8.01 DOES THE STATE HAVE THE RIGHT TO INTERVENE IN

confinement or detention by which any person is deprived of his
liberty, but also in cases involving the rightful custody over a
minor.
The general rule is that parents should have custody over
their minor children but the State has the right to intervene
where the parents treat them cruelly and abusively, impairing
their growth and well-being, and leaving them emotional scars
that they carry throughout their lives unless they are liberated
from such parents and properly counseled." •

SUGGESTED ANSWER:
,The motion to dismiss the petition for h_abeas corpus sh?uld be
granted. By filing the case for declara tion of nullity of ma~nage, H
automa tically submitt ed the issue of the custody of ~he child as an
inciden t thereof. Section 21 of the "Rule on Declara tion of Ab~olut~
Nullity of Void Marriag es and Annulm ent of :7"~dable Marnag ~s
directs the court taking jurisdic tion over a petition for decl8:1'ation
of nullity of marriag e to resolve the custody of common chl1:dren ,
by mere motion of either party, it could only mean ~hat the ~ g of
a new action is not necessa ry for the court to consider the issue of

BRIEF BACKGROUND ON THE WRIT OF AMPARO.

The Writ of Amparo was first adopted in Mexico in 1957
~ and
('½mparo" literally means protection). It is broader in

in
application than the writ of habeas corptts
against illegal arrest and violation of human rights. In ~.1.exican
jurisdiction, Amparo procedure has two parts. The preliminary onesuspension incident tends to prevent the consummati on of alleged
violations. ·

310

Justice Azcuna defined Amparo as a special constitut·10
writ to protect or enforce a constitutional right (other than ph .llaJ
liberty which . is already covered by the writ of habeas corp~~lc~J
consonance with the power of the Supreme Court to adopt l ' tn

What is the Writ of Amparo? How is it distinguished
from the Writ of Habeas Corpus?

SUGGESTED ANSWER:
A ~rit ~f Amparo is a remedy available to any person whose
.
n?ht t_o lif~, liberty, and security has been violated or is t.hreater. et!
with vtolat1on by a public official or employee or a priva te in cl1vit' ., ··l

1.05 WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE WRIT OF AMPARO?

The Writ of Amparo is an independent and sum-1ary remedy
that provides rapid judicial relief to protect the people's right
to life, liberty, ,and security. It is preventive in that it breaks the
expectations of impunity in the commission of tliese offenses, and
it is curative in that it facilitates the subsequent and summary
remedy that provides rapid judicial relief to protect the people's
right to life, liberty, and security. Having been originally intended
as a response to the alarming cases of extrajudicial killings and
enforced disappearances in the country, it serves both preventive
and curative roles to address the said human rights violations. It
is preventive in that it breaks the expectation of impunity in the
commission of these offenses, and it is curative in that it f~ ilitates
the subsequent punishment of perpetrators by inevitably leading to
subsequent investigation and action. (Lozada v. Arroyo, et al. , G.R.
·
Nos. 184379-80, April 24, 2013)
1.06 TO WHAT CASES DOES THE WRIT OF AMPARO APPLY?

The Writ of Amparo is confined only to cases of extralegal
killings and enforced disappearances. Considering that this re~edy

is aimed at addressing these serious violations of or lhreats to th
right to life, liberty and security, it cannot be issued on amorphou e
and uncertain grounds, or in cases where the alleged threat h s
ceased and is no longer imminent or continuing. Instead, it
be granted judiciously so as not to dilute the extraordinary and
remedial character of the writ; thus: The privilege of the Writ f
Amparo is envisioned basically to protect and guarantee th
rights of life, liberty an~ security of persons, free from fears an~
trn:eats that vitiate the quality of this life. It is an extraordinary
wnt conceptualized and adopted in light of and in response to th
prevalence of extralegal killings and enforced di'sappearances.
e

mu:~

. . ~ccordingly, the remedy ought to be resorted to and granted
JUdlClously, ~est the de~ · s_oug_h t . by the. Amparo Rule be diluted
and ~ndermmed by the mdiscr1mmate filing of Amparo petition for
purpos~s less than the desire to secure Amparo reliefs and protection
and/or on •the basis of unsubstantiated allegations. (Lozada v.
Arroyo, et al., G.R. Nos . 184379-80, April 24, 2013)
1.07 MAY "ANY PERSON" FILE A PETITION FOR THE WRIT OF
AMPARO?

No, while "any person" may file a petition for the writ of habeas
corpus, in a petition for the ~t of amparo, the order of priority on
wh<?. can file the petition sho~ld be strictly followed.

In the case of Lorie Marie Tomas Callo v. Commissioner
Jaime H. Morante, et aL.; G.R. No. 230324, September 19, 2017,
Carpio, Acting CJ, there was no allegation nor proof that the missing
person; Parker had no im~ediate family members or any ascendant,
descendant, or collateral relative ~thin the fourth civil degr ~e c r
consanguinity or affinity. In fact, no allegation was made on any
of the familial relationship·of Parker as only her whereabouts from
2011 were alleged and discussed. Thus, based on the order of priority,
petitioner in this cas~ had· no legal standing to file this petition.
1.08 EXPLAIN VIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO SECURITY AS A
GROUND FOR~ HE GRANT OF THE WRIT.
'
The writ of AmA,aro covers violations of the right to security.
At the core of the guaraptee of the right to security, as embodied in
S~ction 2, Article III of the Constitution, is the immunity of one's
·person, including the extensions of his/her person, i. e. , houses,
papers and effects, against unwarranted government intrusion.

S ction 2, Article III of the Constitutibn not only limits the State's
ewer over a person's h_ome and possession, but more importantly,
po tects the privacy and sanctity of the person himself. (Mamba v.
~~eno, G.R. No. 191416, February 7, 2017, Bienvenido L. Reyes, J.)
09 WHEN A PERSON IS CONSUMED BY FEAR FOR LIFE AND
LIBERTY, MAY THE WRIT OF AMP~RO FAVORABLY BE ISSUED?

1·

Yes, it may be issued. A writ of amparo is an independent
d summary remedy to provide im~eq.iate ju'dicial relief for the
an tection of a person's constitutional right to life and liberty. When
proerson is consumed by fear for her life and liberty that it completely
~~its her movement, the writ may be issued to secure her.
Note, however, that the source of this fear must be valid and
bstantiated by ·circumstances, and not mere paranoia. Thus,
~u resolving the necessity of issuing a writ of amparo and the
:~rresponding protection' order, the courts must look at the ove~all
circumstance surrounding the applicant and respondents. (Gadian
v. Jbrado, G.R. No. 188163, October 3, 2017, Bersamin, J.)
1.1 OIS GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT IN T_!'iE DISAPPEARANCE AN
INDISPENSABLE ELEMENT?

Yes, under Section 1 of A.M. No. 07-9-12-SC, a Writ of Amparo
may lie against a private individual or entity. B.ut even if the pe_r~on
sought to be held accountable or responsible in an Amparo pet1ti~n
is a private individual or entity, still, gov_ernment involvement lil
the disappearance remains an indispensable element.
In the case of Nav ia v. Pardic;, G.R. No . 184467, June 19,
2012, petitioners are mere security guards at the Grand Royale
subdivision in Brgy. Lugam, Malolos City and their principal, the
Asian Land, is a private entity. They do not work for the government
and nothing has been presented that would link or co~nect them
to some covert police, military, or gov~rrunental operation. To fall
within the ambit of A.M. No. 07_-9-12-SC in relation to R.A. No.
9851 , the disappearance must be attended by so~e g~vernm~ntal
involvement. This hallmark of State participation differen:ia_tes
an enforced· disappearance case from an ordinary case of a nussmg
person.

FACT S:
At aroun d 11:40 in the morni ng of May 6, 2012, petitio ners
arrive d at the NAIA 3 aboard a Cebu Pacific Airline
flight from a vacati on with their family and friends . They
waited for the arriva l of their bagga ge but were eventu allv
inform ed that it was offload ed and transf erred to a differr=-i{,
flight. Aggrie ved, petitio ners lodged a compl ain t befor e
Cebu Pacific compl aint desk.
As they were compl aining , they notice d a man taking photos
of Claud ine with his celluJ ar phone . Raym art approa ched
the man and asked what he was doing. Sudde nl _,, the man,
later identif ied as Ramo n ''Mon" Tulfo (Mon), alleged ly
punch ed and kicked Ray mart, forcing the latter to fight
·
back.
When Claud ine saw the comm otion, she approa ched
Mon an~ t~e latter likewi se allege dly kicked and pushed
her back aga,ins t the counte r. At that instan ce, Rayma rt
ru~hed to' q~end his wife, while one Edoar do Benjam in
Atilan o (Atilan o) joined in the brawl. Immed iately

Days after the incide nt, respon denrs Ra.ffy, Ben, and Erwin
- Tulfo (respo ndents ), brothe rs of Mon, aired on their TV
progra m comme nt's and explet ives agains t petitio ners,. and
threat ened that they will retalia te. Terrifi ed by the gravity
of the threat s hurled , petitio ners filed a petitio n for the
issuan ce of a writ of ampar o agains t respon dents on May
11, 2012 before the RTC.
A Resolu tion granti ng a TPO in favor of petitio ners and
directe d respon dents to file their return /answ er was
issued . In his return /answ er, Ben Tulfo claime d that the
statem ents he uttere d did not involv e any actual threat
and that he merely expres sed his strong sentim ents to
defend his brothe r.
Later, the RTC, throug h Judge Singh, dismis sed the
petitio n and ordere d the dissol ution of the TPO.

It held that the pe,titio n is not a proper subjec t of a writ
of ampar o since the rules were intend ed to apply solely to
cases of extral egal killing s and enforc ed disapp earanc es,

For the issuan ce of writ of amparo, it has to be shown by
the requ~red quantu m of proof that the disappearance
was c_arried out by, or with the author ization , support or
a_cquiescence of the govern ment or a politic al organization, a~d t~~ t there is a refusa l to acknow ledge the same
or_ to.give fn'formation on the fate or wherea bouts of the
missing perfi'q_ns.
In a petitio n for the· writ of amparo, the order of priority
on who can file the petitio n should be strictly followed.

Danielle Nopuente arrived in the Philippines on 23
March 2011 ana" was charged on 15 Januar y 2013 for
deportation. It was alleged that Danielle Nopuente was a
fugitive from justice in the United States of America with
an outstan ding arrest warran t issued against her.
On the premise that Danielle Nopuente and Danielle
Tan Parker are one and the same person, pursua nt to a
Summa ry Deportation Order (SDO) issued by the Bureau
of Immigration, Parker was arreste d irt Tagaytay City
on 5 June 2014. She was then taken and detained to the
Immigration Detent ion Facility in Bicuta n, Taguig City as
the deportation was not carried out because she is charged
with falsification and use of falsified documents .

claims by substan tial evidence. (Mamb a v. Bueno, G.R. No. 191416,
February 7, 2017, Bienve nido L. Reyes, Associate Justice ) ~

In Ampar o actions, petitioners must .establish their claims by
substantial evidence, and they cannot merely rely on the supposed
failure of respondents to prove either their defenses or their exercise
of extraor dinary diligence. (Loz_ada v. Arroyo, et al., G.R. Nos.
184379-80, April 24, 2013)

Substan tial evidence is that amount ofrelev ant evidence which
a r~a:sonable mind might accept as adequa te to support a conclusion.
It is more than a,~ ere imputat ion of wrongdoing or violation that
would warrant a ~nding of liability against the person charged.
The sum~ar y natute of Amparo proceedings, as well as, the use of
substan tial evidence as standar d of proof shows the intent of the

and _e~traJU~icial killings, or threats thereof, with what is akin to

DILIGENCE BY THE PUBLIC OFFICJAL IPSO FACTO GRANT

THE WRIT OF AMPARO?

No. The failure to establis h that the public official observed
extraord inary diligence in the performance of duty does not result
in the automa tic grant of the privilege of the Amparo writ. It does
not relieve the petition er from establis hing his or her claim by
substan tial evidence. The omission or inaction on the part of the
public official provides, however, some basis for the petitio? er to
move and for the court to grant interim reliefs. (Gen. Yano, et al. v.

2.34 IS ARCHIVING OF AN AMPARO CASE ALLOWED?

FILING OF SEPARATE CRIMINAL, CIVIL, OR ADMINISTRATIVE

Archiving of cases is a procedural measure d~signed . to
temporarily defer the hearing of cases in which no im~edia~e a~hon

Under this scheme, an inactive case is kept alive but held m abeyance

civil or administrative -actions. However, when a criminal action has
been commenced, no ;eparate petition for the writ shall be filed,
but the reliefs under the writ shall be available by motion in the
criminal case, and the procedure under this Rule shall govern the
~sposition of the reliefs available under the Writ of Amparo.

To be sure, the Amparo rule sanctio_ns the archiving of cases,
provided that it is impelled by a valid cause_, s~ch as wh~n _the
witnesses fail to appear due to threats on their lives or to si~ar
analogous causes that would prevent the _court from effechv~ly
heru'ing and conducting the amparo proceedings. (Balao v. Ermita,

from 6 September to 17 September 2009, and (b) the lack of any frur
and effective official investigation as to his allegations. Thus, the
privilege of the writs of amparo and habeas data must be ~anted
in his favor . As a result, there is no longer any need to issue a
temporary protection order, as the privilege of these writs already

FACTS: In this petition for review under Rule 45 of the Rules of
Court in relation to Section 19 of the Rule on the Writ of Amparo
(Amparo Rule), Lourdes D. Rubri"co, Jean Rubrico Apruebo, and
Mary Joy Rubrico Carbone! assail and seek to set aside the Decision
of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated July 31, 2008 in CA-G.R. SP No.
00003, a petition commenced under the Amparo Rule.
The petition prayed that a Writ of Amparo be issued
ordering the individual respondents to desist from performing an;
threatening act against the security of the petitioners and for the
Office of the Ombudsman (0MB) to immediately file an information
for kidnapping qualified with the aggravating circumstance of
gender of the offended party. It also prayed for damages and for
respondents to produce documents submitted to any of them on the
cas~ of petitioner Lourdes.
Gen . .Esperon, P/Dir. Gen. Razon, P/Supt. Roquero, P/Irn,p.
Gomez were included as respondents not because they we_
implicated as being connected to, let alone as being behind, the
alleged abduction and harassment of petitioner. They were included
in the case on the theory that they, as commanders, were responsible
for the unlawful acts allegedly committed by their subordinates
against petitioners.

Whether or not the principle of "command
responsibility ,, applies to Gen. Esperon and P/Dir. Gen. Razon
in {the} Amparo proceedings.

ISSUE:

SUPREME COUR"RS RULING: The evolution of the command
responsibility doctnQ<;_ finds its context in the development of laws
of war and armed combats. _According to Fr. Bernas, "command
responsibility," in its simplest terms, means the "responsibility of
-commanders for crimes committed by subordinate members of the
armed forces or other persons subject to their control in international _

a.rs or domestic conflict." In t,his se~e, command responsibility is
Wroperly a form of criminal complicity.' The I-~a~le Convention~ of
i907 adopted the doctrine of command respons1bihty, foreshadowmg
the present-day precept of_holding ~ superior accountable for _the
t ocities committed by his subordinates should he be renused
~ r his duty of con.trol over them. As then formulated, command
111
onsibility is "an omission mode of individual criminal
resp
.
.
Jjability'' whereby the superior 1s
n:1~ d~ respons1"ble £or ~rimes
-mitted by his subordinates for failing to prevent or pumsh the
co~
.
perpetrators (as opposed to crimes he ordered).

It may plausibly be contended that commahd responsibility, as
legal basis to hold military/police commanders liable for extr~legal
killings enforced disappearances , or threats, may be made applicable
to this jurisdiction on the theory_th~t the co_m mand __responsibility
doctrine now constitutes a pnnciple of ~ternab?nal law . or
tomary international law in accordance with the mcorporat10n
cus
.
·
t
l
clause of the Constitution. Still, it would be mapprop1:~t~
o app Y
t these proceedings the ,doctrine of command responsibility, as the
;A seemed to have done, as a form of criminal complici~y through
omission, for individual respondents' criminal liability, if there be
any, is beyond the reach of Amparo. In other words'. the Court _
d?es
not rule in such proceedings on any issue of crimmal culpability,
even if incidentally a crime or an infraction of an administrative rule
may have been committed.
>

1.

I

As the Court stressed in Secretary of National Defense v.
Manalo, the Writ of Amparo was conceived t~ provide expeditious
and effective procedural relief against - violations or threats of
violation of the basic rights to life, liberty, and security of persons;
the corresponding Amparo suit, however, "is not an action to
determine criminal guilt requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt
x x x or administrative liability requiring substantial evidence that
will require full and exhaustive proceedings." Of the same tenor, and
by way of expounding on the nature and role of Amparo, is what the
Court said in Razon v. Tagitis.
J

Writ of Amparo does not determine guilt nor pinpoint
criminal culpability for the disappearanc e, · threats thereof
or extrajudicial killings; it de.termines responsibility , or at
least accountabilit y, for the enforced disappearanc e, thre_ats
thereof or extrajudicial killings for purposes of imposmg
the appropriate remedies to address the disappearanc e or
extrajudicial killings.

3. REV. FR. ROBERT P. REYES v. CA, SECRETARY
RAUL GONZALEZ, et al.
G.R. No; 182161, December 3, 2009
DOCTRINE: Here, the restriction on petitioner's right to
travel as a -consequence of the pendency of the criminal case
filed against him was not unlawful. Petitioner also fa iled t(,
establish that his right to travel was impaired in the mann:_•,
and to the extent that it amounted to a serious violation of
his right to life, liberty, and security, for which there exists no
readily available legal recourse or remedy.
FACTS: Petitioner was among those arrested in the Manila Peninsula
Hotel siege on November 30, 2007. In the inquest proceedings that
followed, probable cause was established. Subsequently, Petitioner,
along with 50 others were charged with the crime of Rebellion.
Respondent then orde_red that petitioner be included in the Hold
Departure List of thE; :Bureau of Immigration.

The RTC eventlI~ily dismissed the case against petitioner.
However, petitioner filed a petition for issuance of a Writ of Amparo,
aµeging among others that his name has not yet been dropped from
the Hold Departure List of the BID. He anchors his petition on the
premise that his constitutional right to travel is violated.

ssUE: Whether or not petitio'ner's right to liberty has been
1 . lated or threatened ~ith violation by the issuance of the
viobject hold departure order (HDO), which would entitle him

" the privilege of the Writ of Amparo.
to

-

sVPREME COURT'S RULING: No. Petitioner maintains that
b Writ of Amparo does not only exclusively apply to situations of
!~a.judicial killings and enforced ~sa~pearances, but encompasses
U liberties protected by the Const1tut1on. However, the Court has
:iready pronounced that the Writ of Amp~ro, in its pr~s~nt ,~orm,
. confined only to these two instances of extralegal killings and
~
"
"enforced disappearances.

The right to travel refers to the right to move from one place
to another. It is subject to usual constraints for the purpose of
safeguarding the system of justice. In ~uc~ c~s~s, whether the a_ccu~ed
hould be permitted to leave the Junsdichon for humarutanan
:easons is a matter of the c9urt's sound discretion.
Here the restriction on petitioner's right to travel as a
conseque~ce of the pendency of the criminal case 6:}ed again~t
him was not unlawful. Petitioner also failed to establish that his
right to travel was impaired in the manne~ and to _the ~xtent that
it amounted to a serious violation of his nght to life, liberty, and

4. DANIEL MASANGKAY TAPUZ, al. v.
HON. JUDGE ELMO DEL ROSARIO
G.R. No. 182484, June 17, 2008
DOCTRINE: The Court sees no point in separately and
directly intervening through a Writ of Amparo in the absence

SUPRE~ COURT'S RUL~G: No, the issuance is not proper.
The Writ of _Ampar? w~s ongmally conceived as a response to
t~e extraordinary nse m the number of killings and enforced
disapp_earances, and to the perceived lack of available and effective
re~~dies to address these extraordinary concerns. It is intended
to ad~ess violations of or threats to the right to life, liberty, 0, ·.
l
secunty, as· an extraordinary and independent remedy beyond tb,;
available under the prevailing Rules, or as a remedy supplement&!
to these Rules. What it is not, is a writ to protect concerns that are
purely property or commercial. Neither is it a writ that the Court ~
shall issue. on amorphous and uncer-tain grounds.

fJiUS, if the pe_tit~oners wish to see~ redre~s .and hol_d the a~leged

peglrn of ordinary criminal prosecution rather than on the use of the

retraordinary remedy of the Wri t of Amparo.

The Court sees no point in separately and directly intervening
hrough a Writ of Amparo in the absence of any clear prima facie
t bowing that the right to life, liberty, or security - the personal
s ncern that the writ is intended to protect ~ is immediately in
~:nger or threatened, or that the danger or threat is continuing.

5. THE SECRETARY OF NATIONAL DEFENSE
v. RAYMOND and REYNALDO MANALO
G.R. No. 180906, October 7, 2008

voGTRINE: Nonetheless, the circumstances of respondents'
abduction, detention, torture and escape reasonably support
a conclusion that there is an apparent threat that they will
again be abducted, torturfd, and this time, even executed.
These constitute threats to their liberty, security, and life,
actionable through a petition for a Writ of Amparo.
FACTS: Brothers Raymond and Reynaldo Manalo were abducted
by military men belonging to the CAFGU on the suspicion that
they Wfrre members and supporters of the NJ?.A After 18 months
of detention and torture, the brothers escaped on Augus~ 13, 2007.
Ten days after their escape, they filed a Petition for Prohibition,
Injunction, and Temporary Restraining Order to stop the military
officers and agents from depriving them of their right to liberty and
other basic rights. They also sought ancillary remedies and all other
legal and equitable reliefs.

The issuance of the Writ of Amparo in the prE:sent case is
anchored on the factual · allegations brought about in the petition.
Notably, none ofthE; supporting affidavits compellingly show
that the threat to the right to life, liberty, and security of the
petitioners is imminent or is continuing.

The Court ordered the Secretary of DND and the Chief of
Staff of the AFP, their agents, representatives, or persons acting
in their stead, including but not limited to the CAFGU to submit
their comment; and enjoined them from causing the arrest of the
respondents, or otherwise restricting, curt.ailing, abridging, or
depriving them of their right to life, liberty, ,and other basic rights.

Under these l_ei al and factual situations, the Supreme Court
.
IS far from satisfied _~ th the prima facie existence of the ultimate
facts that would justify the i_ssuance of a Writ of Amparo. Rather
than acts of terrorism that pose a continuing threat to the persons
-of the petitioners, the violent incidents alleged appear to the Court
to be purely property-related and focused on the disputed land.

While the petition was pending, the Rule on the Writ of Amparo
took effect. Respondents filed a manifestation and omnibus motion
to treat existing petition as Amparo petition. The privilege of the
Writ of Amparo was granted by the Court of Appeals on December
.
26, 2007.

CHAPTER 8- THE WRIT OF AMPARO

(A Foresight to lhe Bar Exom and the Practice of Low)

The possibility of respondents being executed stared them
in the eye while they were in detention. With their escape, this
continuing threat to their life is apparent, moreso now that they
have surfaced and implicated specific officers in the military not
only in their own abduction and torture, but also in those of other
persons known to have disappeared.
Understandably, since their escape, respondents ha,.·,, ' ·,,n
under concealment and protection by" private citizens because u ,,1e
threat to their life, liberty and security. The threat vitiates ,,'_eir free
will as they are forced to limit their movements or activities. Precisely
because respondents are being shielded from the perpetrators of
their abduction, they cannot be expected to show evidence of overt
acts of threat such as faee-to-face intimidation or written threats to
their life, liberty, ancl--security. Nonetheless, the circumstances of
respondents' abductio~,· detention, torture, and escape reasonably
support a conclusion th'at there is an apparent threat that they will
again be abducted, tortured, and this time, even executed. These
constitute threats to their liberty, security, and life, actionable
through a petition for a Writ of Amparo. Hence, the issuance of 8
Writ of Amparo was proper.

v{firmed with finality by this Court, is NOT included among

,4m,paro.

'

ACTS: Petitioners are settlers in a certa~ parcel_of land situated

the pet:Jt10n; or 1s
• h er been demolished as of the hme of filmg

.
about to be demolished pursuant to a court Judgment.
They now come to this Court for the issuance of ~ Writ of
Amparo on the ground that t~e land titles presented agamst them
are fraudulent and spurious .

ISSUE: Whether or not a Writ of Amparo may issue.
SUPREME COURT'S RULING: No, the ~ t may not ~e issued:
' The threatened demolition of a dwelling by virtue _of a fin~ Judgme~t
of the court, which in this case was affirmed ,Wlth .finality _by this
Court, is NOT included among the enumeration under gectlon 1 of
the Rule on the Writ of Amparo.
No Writ of Amparo may be issued unless there is a clear
allegation of the supposed factual and legal basis of the right sought
to be protected. The claim to the land in question is no~ alleged_ at
all. Moreover, a claim to dwelling does not_constitute right to life,
liberty, and security. There is, therefore, no legal basis for the
issuance of the said writ.

7. INF ANT JULIAN YUSAY CARAM v.
ATTY. MARIJOY D. SEGUI, et al.
G.R. No. 193652, August 51 2014

DOCTRINE: Since it is extant from· the pleadings filed th_at
what is involved is the issue of child custody and the exercise
of parental rights over a child, who, for all intents and
purposes, has been legally considered _a ward of the State, the
Amparo rule cannot be properly applied.
FACTS: This petition is all about the Writ of -:1-mpa~o filed by
Christina Yusay Caram for the adoption of her child Julian. In her

· petition, Christina accused respondents of "blackmailing" her ·

d
.
f
.
.
egaJ
reqms~tes 1or a ~pt~on o the ~?r child had been complied with
The trial court disnnssed her petition. Hence, this petition.
·

In~this case, Christina alleged that the respondent DSWD
fficers caused her "enforced separation" from Baby Julian. and
~bat their action amounted to an "enforced disappearance" within
tbe context of the Amparo rule. Contrary to her position, however,
the respondent DSWD officers never concealed Baby Julian's
whereabouts. In fact, Christina obtained a copy of the DSWD's May
ZB, 2010 Memorandum explicitly stating that Baby Julian was in
the custody of the Medina Spouses when she filed her petition before
tbe RTC. Besides, she even admitted in her petitiqn for review on
certiorari that the respondent DSWD officers presented Baby Julian
before the RTC during the hearing held in the afternoon of August
5 2010. There is, therefore, no "enforced disappearance" as used in
the context of the Amparo rule as the third and fourth el~ments are
missing.
Christina's directly accusing the respondents of forcibly
separating her from her chilg and placing the latter up for ado~~on,
supposedly without complying with the necessary legal reqms1tes
to qualify the child for adoption, clearly indicates that she is not
searching for a lost Ghild but asserting her parental authority over
the child and contesting custody over him.

344

ISSUE: Whether or not the Writ of Amparo is a proper remed
for the custody of the child.
Y
SUPREME COURT'S RULING: No, the Writ or Amparo is not
proper remedy for the custody of the child. Section 1 of the Rule a
the Writ of Amparo provides as follows:
on

,.

. . SECTION~· Petition. -The petition for a Writ ofAmparo
1s a _remed_y a~ail~ble to any person whose right to life, liberty
and security 1s VI?la~ed or thre~tened with violation by an
unlawful act or om.1ss1on of a pubhc official or employee, or of
private individual or entity.
a

The writ shall cover extralegal killings and enforced disappearances or threats thereof. In the landmark case of Secretary of
National Defense, et al. v. Manalo, et al., the Court held that:
The pronouncement on the coverage of the writ was further
cemeP.,ted in the latter' case of Lozada, Jr. v. Macapagal-Arroyo
where the Court explicitly declared that as it stands, the Writ t}(
Amparo is confined only to cases of extrajudicial kiilings RP
enforced disappearances, or to threats thereof. As to what constitut
"enforced disappearance," the Court in Navia v. Pardico enumeratea
the elements constituting "enforced disappearances" as the term is
statutorily defined in Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 9851, to wit:
(a) that there be an arrest, detention, abduction or any
form of deprivation of liberty;
(b) that it be carried out by, or with the authorization,
support or acquiescence of, the State or a political organization;
.

(c) that it ~ followed by the State or political organiza·
tion's refusal to acknowledge or give information on the fate or
whereabouts of the person·subject of the Amparo petition; and,
(d) that the intention for such refusal is to remove
subject person froni the protection of the law for a prolonged
period of time.

345

Since it is extant from the pleadings filed_that what is involved
is the issue of child custody and the exercise of parental 1ights over a
child, who, for all intents and purposes, h~s been legally considered
a ward of the State, the Amparo rule canriot be pro;>erly applied.
To reiterate, the privilege of the Writ of Amparo is a
remedy available to victims of extrajudicial killings and enforced
disappearances or threats of a similar nature, regardless of whether
the perpetrator of the unlawful act or omission is a public official or
employee or a private individual. It is envisioned basically to protect
and guarantee the right to life, liberty and security of persons, free
from fears and threats that vitiate the quality of life.

is a writ that we shall iss,,e. on amorphous and uncertaitt
grounds.

FACTS: Petitioners alleged that in February 2008, rurno
8
circulated that petitioner Nerio Pador was a marijuana planter ~
Baran.gay Tabunan, Cebu City. On 17 March 2008, responden~n
Alberto Alivio, Carmelo Revales and Roberto Alimorin raided th/
ampalaya farm to search for marijuana plants, but found none. Aft;r
the raid, petitioners Nerio and Ray Pador received invitation letterr
8
for a conference from respondent Barangay Cap\ain Arcayan. The
referred the invitation letters to their counsel, who advised the~
not to attend and, instead, sent a letter-reply to Barangay Captain
Arcayan. However, the latter refused to receive it. Petitioners then
concluded that the conduct of the raid, the sending of the invitation
letter, f~e refusal of respondent barangay captain to receive their
letter-reply - as well as the possibility of more harassment cases
false accusations, and possible violence from respondents - gravel;
threatened their right to life, liberty and security and necessitated
the issuance of a Writ of Amparo:
ISSUE: Whether or not there is sufficient ground for the
issuance of a Writ of Amparo.

SUPREME COURT'~ RULING: The Court ruled in the negative.
··-section 1 of the Rule on the Writ of Amparo provides for the
grounds that may be relied upon in a petition therefor:
Sec. 1. Petition. - The petition for a Writ of Amparn i• :
remedy available to any person whose right to life, libel'ty L
security is violated or threatene~ with violation by an unlawtu1
act or omission of a public official or employee, or of a private
individual or entity.

The writ shall cover extralegal killings and enforced
disappearances or threats thereof.
Thus, to be entitled to the privilege of the writ, petitioners
must prove by substa-ntial evidence that their rights to life, liberty,
and security are beihg1.~olated or threatened by an unlawful act or
omission. The Writ of Amparo was originally conceived as a response
to the extraordinary rise in the number of killings and enforced
disappearances, and to the perceived lack of available and effective
remedies to address these extraordinary concerns. It is intended
to address violations of or threats to the rights to life, liberty or

G.R. No. 197522, September 11, 2013

•

oCTRINE: The historical prevalence of his deplora~le
V ctice has even led to the inception and eventual adoption
pf~he Rules on Amparo to better protect the sacrosanc~ right
~f every person to his life and liberty and not to be deprived of
such without due process of law.

FACTS: Tetet, son of Petitioner, was a_~ ested by respondents for
alleged acts of extortion and,on th~ ~us~ic1on th~t he was a "';°ember
f the Communist Party of the Philippmes/National Peoples Army
~evolutionary Movement. Despite his peaceful surrender, he was
maltreated by the respondents. He was hit on different p_a rts of ~he
body with the butts of their rifles, and his hands were ~~d be~d
his back with an electric wire. He was placed on a military Jeep
and brought to the Viga River where he was gunned pown by the
respondents. In defense, respondents posited that Tetet pulled a
hand grenade from Abordo, one of the arresting officers .. He then
jumped out of the jeep and, from the ground, ~don his captors
by moving to pull the safety pin off the grenade where one of the
arresting police officers, as an act of self-defense, fired upon Tetet,
hitting him four times in the body.
ISSUE: Whether or not the Rules on Amparo apply in this
case.
SUPREME COURT'S RULING: The court ruled in the positive.
The court can only bewail the loss of a family member ~o~gh
the unfortunate course of an extralegal killing. The historical
prevalence of his deplorable practice ·has even led to the inception
and eventual adoption of the Rules on Amparo to better protect the
sacrosanct right of every person to his life and lib~rty and n_ot to be
deprived of such without due process of law. Despite the poignancy
natural to every case advanced as an extralegal killin~, t~e C~urt,
as in all courts of law, is mandated to operate on msti~ut~onal
impartiality - that is its every ruling, notwithstanding the

2.
privilege of the Writ of Amparo.

issUES: 1.

DOCTRINE: In the present case, the totality of the eviden. ·
adduced by petitioners failed to meet the threshold ce
substan_tial evidence. Sifting through all the evidence an.~
allegations presented the crux of the case boils down. t0
assessing the veracity and credibility of the parties' divergi
claims as to what actually transpired. In this regard, t~g
Supreme Court is in agreement with the factual findings 0;
the Court of Appeals to the extent that petitioner Lozada w 8
· not illegally deprived of his liberty from the point when :
disembarked from the aircraft up to the time he was led
the departur._e area of the airport~ as he voluntarily submitted
himself to the custody of respondents.

t:

FACTS: After the discovery of the alleged corruption scandals arising from the ZTE-NBN deal, petitioner Rodolfo Lozada, acting then
as its unoffi.c ial con~ultant, left the Philippines on the date he was
to-appear before the Senate of the Philippines Blue Ribbon Commit1
tee on the allegations made by him that anomalies transpired in the
·
·1
.
;_
ZTE-NB:N deal involving several public officials.

On ·return to the Philippines, several unidentified ,i- approached the petitioner, led him through the departure arei:: ,,.
the airpQrt, and into a car waiting for them. He was then brought
to La Salle Greenhills. He claimed that its perimeter were guarded
by policemen resulting to a restraint of his liberty and a threat not.
only on his security, but also that of his family and the De La Salle
brothers. This incidtmt prompted the petitioner to file a petition for
Writ of Amparo with its corresponding interim reliefs.
The case re~ched the Court of Appeals and upon resolution,
denied the petiti9n'because the petitioner failed to prove through
substantial evidenGl that respondents violated, or threatened with
violation, the right to life, liberty and security of the petitioner. It
_further dropped former President Arroyo as a respondent on the
ground that at the time the petition was filed, she was still the
incumbent President and therefore, immune from suit.

suPREME COURT'S RULINGS:

FIRST ISSUE:
It is settled in jurisprudence that the President enjoys
· rnunity from suit d~g his or her tenure of office or actual
:umbency. Conversely, this presidential privilege of imm~ty
cannot be invoked by a non-sitting president even for acts comrmtted
during his or her tenure. In the case at bar, the events that gave to
the present action, as well as the filing of the original Petition and
the issuance of the CA Decision, occurred ·d~g t~e incumbency
of former President Arroyo. In that respect, 1t was proper for the
court a quo to have dropped her as a respondent on account of her
•
presidential immunity from suit.

SECOND ISSUE:
Sections 17 and 18 of the Rule on .the Writ of Amparo require
the parties to establish their claims by substantial evidence, or.such
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate
to support a conclusion. The use of this evidentiary thres~old
reveals the clear intent of the framers of the Rule on the Writ of
Amparo to have the equivalent of an administrativ~ pi;o~eeding,
albeit judicially conducted, in addressi.ng amparo s1tuati~ns. In
cases where the violation of the right to life, liberty, or security ~as
already ceased, it is necessary for the petitioner in an a_mparo action
to prove the existence of a continuing threat as held m the case of

Razon v. Tagitis.
In the present case, the totality of the evidence_ addu_ced by
petitioners failed to meet the threshold of substantial e~dence.

The Writ of Ha~eas Data is essentia.l!y considered as the
youngest legal mechamsm to safeguard the pflvacy of an individu a.1

Council of Europe s 108th Convention on Data Protection of 198I
The European Data Protection Con~ention of 1981 was convened~
dev~lop safeguards to secure the privacy of the individual by wa 0f
Y
• regulating the processing of personal information or data.

In Latin American countries, it finds its application as

the Federal Republic of Brazil. Article 5, Title II of the 1998
Constitution provides:
"Habeas ,Data shall be granted: (1) to ensure the knowledge of information rel~ted to the person of the petitioner con-taiped in records or databanks of government agencies 'or of

The country of Colombia incorporated the habeas data right in
.
its 1991 Constitution and reformulated the same in the 1997 version
of its Constitution, where it recognizes the citizen's right to know,
access, update and rectify any information gathered about them in
databases, both public and private. Article 135 of the 1992 Paraguay
Constitution provides:

The Argentine Supreme Court held that the writ is a
roper remedy in cases involving extralegal killings and enforced
tsappearanc es which give the \'ictims access to_ police an? ~t8:)'
records otherwise closed to them . The Argen!1r1e Consti~ution m
reference to the Writ of Habeas Data under Article 43 proVIdes:
':.1ny person may file this action (the writ of habeas
data) to obtain information on the data about himself and
their purpose, registered in public records or data bases, or in
private ones intended to supply information; and in case of false
data or discriminati on, this action may be filed to request the
suppression, rectific_ation, confidentiali ty or updating of said
data. The secret nature of the sources ofjournalistic information
shall not be impaired. "

G.R. No. ·202666, Septem ber 29, 2014
DOCTRINES:
1.

To "engage " in somethi n8 is differen t from underta king
a busines s endeavo ur. To "engage " means ''to do or tak
part in somethi ng." It does not necessa rily mean th e
the activ!ty must be done in pursuit of a business .
matters is that the person or entity must be gatherin
collectin g or storing said data or informa tion about
aggriev ed party or his or her family. Whether such un~
dertakin g carries the element of regulari ty, as when one
pursues · a business , and is in the nature of a personal
endeavo ur, for any other reason or even for no reason
at all, is immate rial and such will not prevent the writ
from getting to said person or entity.

Wh::

t:•

I

To agree with respond ents' above argumen t, wo u.ld
mea!I, unduly limiting the reach of the writ to a 1: • ,
small group, i.e., private persons and entities whose L.
ness is data gatheri ng and storage, and in the proce,, ,
decreas ing the effective ness of the writ as an instrum ent
designe d to protect a rigl!,t which is easily violated in
view of rapid advance ments in the informa tion and communica tions technol ogy-a right which a grr-at majority .
of the users of technolo gy themsel ves are not capable of
protecti ng.
The Suprem e found that the default setting for
Faceboo k posJs of the petition ers' children were set on
''Public. " Th_u);, it can be surmise d that the photogr aphs
in question -az,re viewabl e to everyon e on Facebook,
absent any proof that petition ers' children positivel y
limited the disclosu re of the photogr aph. If such were the
case, they cannot invoke the protecti on attache d to the
right to informa tional privacy.

~

369

The SC, citing the US v. Gines-Perez case, stated:
"A person who places a photogr aph on .the Internet precisel y intends to forsake and renounce all
privacy rights to such imagery , particul arly under
circums tances such as here, where the Defenda nt
did not employ protecti ve measure s or devices that
would have controll ed access- to the Web page or the
photogr aph itself."
Also that the photos are viewable by "friends
only" do~s not necessa rily bolster the petitio~er~'
contenti on. In this regard, the cyber com~un it~ is
agreed that the digital images under this setting
still remain to be outside the confines of the zones of
privacy in view of the following:
( 1)· Face book "allows the world to be more
open and connect ed by giving i~s users th~. tools to
interact and share in any conceiva ble way',
(2) A good number of Facebook users ''befriend" other users who are total stranger s;
(3) The sheer number of ''Friend s" one user
has, usually by the hundred s; and
,
(4) A user's Facebook friend can "share" the
former'& post, or "tag" others w~Q ar~ not _F~cebook
friends with the former, desp"it~ its bem? visible only
to his or her own Facebook friends. It is well to emphasize at this point that set~ing a post's or profil_e
detail's privacy to "Friend s" is no assuran ce t~at it
can no longer be viewed by another user who -is not
Facebooh friends with the source of the co?tent. The
user's own Facebook friend can share said content
or tag his or her own Facebook friend t~ereto, r~gardless of whether the user tagged by the latter is
Facebook friends or not with the former. Also, when
the post is shared or when a person is tagged, the respective Facebook friends of the person who shar~d
the post or who was tagged can vi,ew _the P?,st, t e

· STC's _computers, Escudero's students Jogged in to
t err respective personal Facebook accoun t s and showed
her_ photos of !he identified students, which include: (a) _
J:ulia and . J~lienne drinking hard liquor and smoking
cigarettes i.µs1de a bar; and (b) Julia and Julienne along
t}_ie streets of Ce~u wearing articles of clothing that show
VI.rtually the e~tirety of their black brassieres . What is
more, Esc{!_<:1.ero s students claimed that there were times
w~en acces ~ to or the availability of the identified students'
p oto~ was· not_confined to the girls' Facebook frie nds, but
were, m fact, viewable by any Facebook user.
The !~entfied students in the Facebook pos ts subsequently
wen o t e office of STC's high school principal. Allegedly:

they were castigated nnd ve?'bally abus ed by the STC's
officials present in the conference. Consequently, they
were barred fiom joining the commencement exercises
scheduled on March 30, 2012.
A week before graduation, Angela's mother, Dr. Armenia
M . Tan (Tan), filed a Petition for Injunction and Damages
before the RTC of Cebu City against STC, et al. In it,
Tan prayed that defendants therein be enjoined from
implementing the sanction that precluded Angela from
joining the commencement exercises .
The RTC issued a TRO allowing said students to attend
the graduation ceremony, to which STC filed a motion for
reconsideration. Despite the issuance of the TRO, the STC
still barred the sanctioned students from participating in
the graduation rites, on the ground that its MR is remained
unresolved.
Thereafter, petitioners filed before the RTC a petition for
the issuance of a writ of habeas data and av erred, in the
main, that:
1.
The privacy setting of their children's Facebook
accounts was set at "Friends Only ." They , thus, have
a reasonable expectation of privacy which must be
respected; and
·
2.
The photos accessed belong to the girls and, thus,
cannot be used and reproduced without their consent.
Escudero, however, violated their rights b y saving
digital copies of the photos and b y subsequently
showing them to STC's officials. Thus, the Facebook
accounts of petitioners' children were intruded upon;
3.

4.

The photos of their children in their undergarments
(e.g. , bra) were taken for posterity before they changed
into their swims uits on the occasion of a birthday
beach party;
Respondents, b eing involv ed in the field of education,
knew or ought to have known of laws that safe guard
the right to privacy. Corollarily, respondents knew or
ought to have known that the girls, whose privacy has
bee n invaded , are the victims in this case, and not the
offenders. Worse, after viewing the photos, the minors
wer e calle d "immoral" and were punished outright;

For instance, a Facebook user can regulate the visibility and

manifestation, in cyber WOf ld, of the users mvocatlon of his or her
right to informatio nal privacy.
Therefore, a Facebook user who opts to make use of a privacy
tool to grant or de~y access to his or her post or p~ofile detail s_hould
not be denied the informatio nal privacy right which necessarily accomfanies said choice.

Now, the question arise: Did the minors limit the 'disclosur e of
the photos such that the images were kept within their zones
•
of privacy?
The Supreme Court found that the default setting for
Facebook posts of the petitione rs' children were set on "Public." Thus, it can be surmised that the photogra phs in question were viewable to everyone on Facebook, absent any proof
that petitioner s' children positively limited the disclosur e of
the photogra ph. If such were the case, they cannot invoke the
protection attached to the right to informati onal privacy.
.,
The SC, citing the US v. Gines-Perez case, stated:

"A person who places a photograp h on the Internet pTecisely intends to forsake and renounce all privacy rights to such
imagery, particular ly unde-r circumstan ces such as here, w~ere
the Defendant did not employ protective measures or devices
that would have controlled access to the Web page or the photograph itself."

FACTS:

In his petition for the issuance of the writ of habeas data
dated June 22, 2012, respond~n t P/Supt, Neri A Ilagan
(Ilagan) alleged that he and petitioner Dr. Joy Margate Lee
(Lee) were former common law partners.
Sometime in July 2011, he visited Lee at the latter's
condomini um and rested for a while, and, thereafter,
proceeded to his office . Upon arrival, he noticed that his
digital camera was missing. On August 23, 2011 , Lee
confronted Ilagan regarding a purported sex video she
discovered from the said camera involving Ilagan and
another woman, which the latter vehementl y denied and
demanded Lee to return the camera, but to no avail.
Subsequen tly, Lee utilized the said video as ' evidence in
filing various complaints against Ilagan such as violation
of R.A. No. 9262 and an a dministrat ive complaint for grave
misconduc t b e fore the National Police Com.missio n.
Ilagan claimed that Lee's acts of reproducin g the subject

The Regional Trial Court found Hagan's petition meritori

the subject video and s?owing it to other people, i.e.,
!'l~OLCO M officers~ Violated the latter's right to privacy

anguish.

~!

Dissatisfied , Lee filed a petition for review on certiorari
before the Supreme Court.

ISSUE: Did the RTC correctly extended the privilege of the writ of ·
habeas data in favor of Ilagan?
~UPREME COURT'S RULING: The RTC did not correctly extend
the privilege of the writ of habeas data in favor of Ilagan.
AM. No. 08-1-16-SC , or the Rule on the Writ of Habeas ,.,,.
(Habeas Data Rule), was conceived as a response, given the Jack
of effective and available remedies, to address the extraordin?. ry
rise in the number of killings and enforced disappeara nces. It was
conceptua lized as a judicial -remedy enforcing the right to
privacy, most especially the right to informath .mal privacy
of individua ls, which is defined as "the right to control the
collection , maintenan ce, use, and dissemina tion of data
about oneself." '
As defined in Section 1 of the Habeas Data Rule the writ of
habeas data no-w ~ ~nds as "a remedy available to any p'erson whose
right to privacy t'!._1life, liberty or security is violated or threatened
by an unlawful act'"ar omis~ion of a public official or employee, or of
a private individual or entity engaged in the gathering, collecting or
· storing of data or informatio n regarding the person, family, home,
and correspond ence of the aggrieved party."

37g;

.Thus, in order to support ·a petitian for the issuance of such
·t Section 6 of the Hapeas Data Rule essentially requires that the
h . h
'
t.Vfl
sufficiently alleges, among ot h ers, "t h e manner t e rig t to

relation, it bears pomtmg out that the wn~ of habeas data will not
issue to protect purely property or com"!~rcia l concerns nor when the
and
' nds invoked in support of the petitions therefor are vague
.
grou
doubtful.
In this case, the Court finds that Ilagan was not able to
sufficientl y allege that his right to privacy in life, liberty or
security was or would pe violated !hro~gh the supp~sed re. roduction and threatene d dissemina tion of the sub1ect sex
:ideo. While Ilagan purports a privacy interest in the supression of this video - which he fears would somehow find
way to Quiapo or be uploaded in the intern~t for public
consumpt ion - he failed to explain the connectio n between
such interest and any violation of his right to life, liberty
or ~ecurity. Indeed, courts cannot speculate or'contriv ~ v_ersions of possible transgres sions. As the rules and existing
jurisprud ence on the matter evoke, alleghag and eventuall y
proving the nexus between one's privacy right to the cogent
rights to life, liberty or security are crucial in habeas ~ata
cases so much so that a failure on either account .certainly
'
renders a habeas data petition dismissib le, as in this case.

:s

Further, the Ilagan's petition is equally dismissib le due
to the inadequa cy of the evidence presented . As the records
show, all that Ilagan submitted in support of his petition w_as
his self-servin g testimony which hardly meets the su}>stanti al
evidence requirem ent as prescribe d by the Habeas Data
rule. This is because nothing herein would- indicate that
Lee actually proceeded to commit any overt act towards
the end of violating Ilagan's right to privacy in life, liberty,
or security; Contrasti ngly, Lee even made it clear that the
only reason why she reproduce d the su~ject vi~e~ was to
legitunate ly utilize the same as evidence in the crmnnal and
administr ative cases that she filed against Ilagan.

particular documents to be secured, their location or what particular
government office had custody thereof, and who has possession or

DOCTRINE: The writs of amparo and habeas data will NOT
issue to protect purely property or commercia l concerns
nor when the grounds invoked in support of the petitions
therefore are vague or doubtful. Employmen t constitutes a
property right under the context of the due process clause of
the Constitutio n. It is evident that respondent 's reservation s
on th e real reasons for her transfer is a legitimate concern
respecting the terms and conditions of one's employmen t are
what prompted her to adopt the extraordin ary remedy of
•
habeas data.

FACTS: Rosario Lim is an administrat ive clerk at MERALCO,
an anonymous letter was posted at the door of her assigned office

denouncing respondent. By Memorandu m of .Alexander (head of
MERALCO Human Resource Staffing), he directed the transfer of
respondent to another sector due to the accusations and threats
against her from unknown individuals and which could possible
compromise her safety and security.
Lim then requested deferment of lµs transfer, but due to
futility, she filed a TRO for her transfer and a petition for issuance of
a writ of habeas data against MERALCO commanding MERALCO,

to wit:
1) Full disclosure of the data or information about
respondent in relation to the report purportedly received by
petitioners on the alleged threat to her safety and security;

'
S!JPREME COURT'S RULING: The CA erred in granting the
Writ of Habeas Data in favor of the petitioner.
The Writ of Habeas Data was conceptualized as a judi,', _
remedy enforcing the right to privacy, most especially the right to
informational privacy of individuals. The writ operates to protect a
person's right to control informatipn regarding himself, particularly
in the instances where such information is being collec:.ed through
unlawful means in order to achieve unlawful ends.
The main problem behind the ruling of the Court of Appeals
is that there is actu~lly no evidence on record that shows that any
of the public respondents had violated or threatened the right to
privacy of the petitioner. The act ascribed by the Court of Appeals
to the public res:p6bdents that would have violated or threatened
the right to priva<iy of the petitioner, i.e., keeping records of
investigations and other reports about the petitioner's ties with the
CPP-NPA, was not adequately proven-considering that the origin
of such records were virtually unexplained and its existence, clearly,
only inferred by the appellate court from the video and photograph

For a writ of kalikasa n to issue, the followin g re~uisi_tes
must concur: (1) there is an actual or threaten ed violation _
f the constitu tional right to a balance d and healthfu l
:cology; (2) the actual or threaten ed viola~on arises from an
unlawfu l act or omission of a public official or employee, or

violation involves or will lead to an environm ental damage of

FACTS:
To address the clamor for a more tangible response to climate
change, Former Presiden t Gloria Macapagal-Arro~o issued AO
171 which created the Presiden tial Task Force on Climate Change
(PTFCC) on February 20, 2007. This body was r~organize~ throug~
BO 774 which designated the Presiden t as Chairperson, and cabinet sec;etari es as members of the Task Force. EO 774 expres~ed
what is now referred to by the petitioners as the "Road Sharing
Principle ." Section 9(a) thereof reads:
,
"Section 9. Task Group on Fossil Fuels. - (a) To

of the petitioners' constitutional right to a balanced and healthful
ecology, and may even be tantamo unt to deprivation of life, and of
Jife sources or "land, water, and air" by the government without due
process of law. They also decry the "unequal" protection of laws in
the prevailing scheme, claiming that ninety-eight percent (98%) of
filipinos are discriminated against by the law when the car-owning
two percent (2%) is given almost all of the road space and while
Jarge budgets are allocated for construction and maintenance of
roads, hardly any budget is given for sidewalk4s, bike lanes and non!Ilotorized transpo rtation systems.

Respondents, through the Office of the Solicitor General, filed
their Comment seeking the outrigh t dismissal of the petition for
Jack of standin g and failure to adhere to the doctrine of hierarchy
of courts. Moreover, respondents argue that petitioners are not
entitled to the reliefs prayed for. Specifically, respondents assert
that petitioners are not entitled to a writ of kalikasan because
they failed to show tliat the public respondents are guilty of an ·
unlawful act or omission; state the environmental law/s violated;
show environmental damage of such magnitude as to prejudice the
life, health or property of inhabita nts of two or more cities; and

Should the Court issue Writ of Kalikasqn in this case?
SUPREME COURT'S RULING:

For a writ of kalikasa n to issue, the following requisites must
concur:
there is an actual or threaten ed violation of the
1.
constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology;
2. the actual or threaten ed violation arises from an
unlawful act or omission of a public official or.:> employee, or
private individual or entity; and
the actual or threaten ed violation involves or will
3.
lead to an environmental damage of such magnitude as to
prejudice the life, health or property of inhabita nts in two or
more cities or provinces.
It is well-settled that a party claiming the privilege for the issuance of a writ of kalikasa n has to show that a law, rule or-regulation

~ea egations, petition
ers were n?~ able to show that respondents
failed to execute any of the laws petit10ners cited. In fact, apart fro
adducin g expert testimo ny on the adverse effects of air pollutiorn
on public health, the petition ers did not go beyond mere allegation
in _establis hing the unlawfu l acts or omissions on the part of th:
public.r esponde nts that have a causal link or reasona ble connection
to the actual or threaten ed violation of the constitu tional right to
a balanced and healthfu l ~cology of the magnitu de contemplated
under the ~ules, as require d of petition s of this nature.
Moreover, the Nationa l Air Quality Status Report for 20052007 (NAQSR) submitt ed by the petition ers belies their claim that
the DENR failed to reduce air pollutan t emissions - in fact, the
NAQSR shows that the Nationa l Ambien t Total Suspend ed Particu··· lates (TSP) value used to determi ne air quality has steadily declined
from 2004 to 2007, and while the values still exceed the air quality
guideline value, it has remaine d on this same downward trend until
as recently as 2011. On the other hand, public respond ents s
ciently showed that \hey did not unlawfu lly refuse to implement or
neglec;:t the laws, executive and adminis trative orders as claimed by
the petition ers. Projects and program s that seek to improve air quality were underta ken by the respond ents, jointly and in coordination
with stakeho lders, such as: priority tagging of expendi tures for climate change adaptat ion and mitigation, the Integra ted Transport
Sy~tem which is aimed to decongest major thoroughfares, Truck ·
Ban, Anti-Smoke Belching Campai gn, Anti-Colorum, Mobile Bike
Service Proiarris.. and Urban Re-Gree ning Program s.
In fact, the..:k me NAQSR submitt ed by the petition ers show
that the DENR was, and is, taking concrete steps to improve
nationa l air quality, such as informa tion campaig ns, free emission
testing to complement the anti-smoke-belching program and oth_er

Supr eme Court's Ruling:

oN ISSU E A:
No, the ECC is not inval idated in. the absence of
the signatur e of RP Energ y repre senta tive. WKile the
signa ture is
neces sary for the valid ity of the ECC , the partic
ular c-ircumstanc es of this case show that the DEN R and RP
Energ y were
not prope rly appri sed of the issue of lack of signa
ture in order
for them to prese nt contr overt ing evidence and argum
ents on
this point, as the issue only arose durin g the cours
e of the proceedings upon clarif icator y quest ions from the appel
late court .
Conse quent ly, RP ~nerg y canno t be faulte d for subm
itting the
certified true copy of the ECC only after it learn
ed that the
ECC had been inval idated on the groun d of lack of
signa ture in
the Janua ry 30, 2013 Decision of the appel late court
.
ON ISSU E B:
No, it is not a preco nditio n to· the issua11ce. The
ECC is
not the license or perm it conte mplat ed under Sectio
n 59 of the
IPRA Law and its imple ment ing rules . Henc e, there
is no necessit y to secur e the CNO under Sectio n 59 before
an ECC may
be issued , and the issua nce of the subje ct ECC
witho ut first
secur ing the afore said certif icatio n does not rende
r it invalid.
ON ISSU E C:
No. it is not a preco nditio n to the consu mmat ion
of the
Lease and Deve lopme nt Agree ment (LDA) . While
the court
finds that a CNO shoul d have been secur ed
prior to the
consu mmat ion of the LDA betwe en SBMA and
RP Energy,
consi derin g that this is the first time (we) lay down
the rule of
action appro priate to the applic ation of Section 59,
the Supre me
Court refrai ns from inval idatin g the LDA for reaso
ns of equity .
ON ISSU ED:
No, compliance is not neces sary. The issuan ce
of an
ECC does not, by itself, resul t in the imple menta
tion of the

OPOSA v. FACTORAN
G.R. No. 101083, July 30, 1993
. . The principal petitioners are all minors duly represented a1, 0
Jomed by their respective parents. The complaint was instituted ,'$
a taxpayers'_class suit and alleges that the plaintiffs "are all citu.,~, 1
of the Republic of the Philippines, taxpayers, and entitled to the tu
benefit, use and enjoyment of the natural resource treasure that 1j
the country's virgin tropical forests."
Public-records reveal that the defendant's predecer ,ors have
granted timber license agreements ('TLA's') to various corporations
to cut the aggregate area of 3.89 million hectares for commercial
logging purposes. At the present _rate of deforestation, i.e., about
200,000 hectares per annum or 25 hectares per hour - nighttime,
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays included - the Philippines will
bereft of _forest .re~~urces after the end of this ensuing decade,
if ~ot ~~rlier. Th~ adverse effects, disastrous consequences,
senous mJury and irreparable damage of this continued trend of
deforestation to the plaintiff minor's generation and to generations
yet _unborn are evident and incontrovertible. Defendant's refusal to
c~cel the af~reme~tioned TLA's is manifestly contrary to the public
policy enunciated m the Philippine Environmental Policy. Thus,

?e

the petitioners were prompted to file a civil case before the RTC of
r,Aakati.
Secretary Factoran, Jr., filed a Motion to Dismiss the complaint
based on two grounds, namely: (1) the p_laintiffs have ~o ~aus~ of
action against him; and (2) the issue ra1_sed by thhe pl la~ t~ 1s a
litical question which properly pertains to t e egis1ative or
~:ecutive branch of Government. The RTC granted the Motion to
Dismiss.

ISSUES: 1. Whether or no!· the said -!'et_ition"e~s ha~e a ca~se
of action to ''prevent the misappropriation or impairment of
Philippine rainforests and "arrest the unabated h':"'orrhage
of the country's uital life support systems and continued rape
of Mother Earth."
2. Whether .or not the issue raised by the Petitioners,
assuming they have locus standi, is a political question.
SUPREME COURT'S RULING:

FIRST ISSUE:
, The Supreme Court held that the suit filed by the petitioners is
indeed a class suit. The subject matter of the.complaint is of common
and I general interest not just to several, 6ut to all titizens of the
Philippines. Consequently, since the parties are so numerous, it,
becomes impracticable, if not totally impossible, bring all of them
before the court. The Court likewise declared that the plaintiffs are
numerous and representative enough to ensure the full protection
of all concerned interests. Hence, all the requisites for the filing
of a valid class suit under Section 12, Rule 3 of the Revised Rules
of Court are present both in the said civil case and in the instant
petition, the latter being but an incident to the former. The Court
also held that the petitioner minors have the personality to sue
in behalf of the succeeding generations based on the concept of
intergenerational responsibility insofar as the right to a ;,balanced
and healthful ecology is concerned. Thusr the petitioners have locus
standi to file the said action.

to

The right to a balanced and healthful ecology carries with it
the correlative duty to refrain from impairing the environment. The
right of the petitioners (and all those they represent) to a balanced
and healthful ecology is as clear as the DENR's duty - under its
mandate and by virtue of its powers and functions under E.O. No.

the said right. A denial or violation of that right by the other w~e
has the correlative duty or obligation to respect or protect the sarn. 0
.
e
gives rise to a cause of action.
As to the defense related to the issue being a political question
this suit principally involved the enforcement of a right vis-a-v •'
policies already formulated and expressed in legislation. It mus~
nonetheless, be emphasized that the political question doctrine is n'
longer the insurmountable obstacle to the exercise of judicial pow 0
or the impenetrable shield that protects exeeutive and legislati~r
actions from judicial inquiry or review.
e
In relation to the _non-im pairme nt clause allegation, it should
be noted that timber licenses are not contracts. Hence, the non.
impair ment clause cannot be invoked.

· SECOND ISSUE:
It is a justiciable issue which is within the authority of the
Court to pass ~pon. What is _prmcipally involved is the enforcement
of a right vis-a-vis policies already formulated and expressed in
legislation. It must, nonetheless, be emphasized that the political
question doctrine is no longer the insurm ountab le obstacle to the
exercise of judicial power or the impene trable shield that protects
ex_~cutive -a nd legisla'tive actions from judicial inquiry or review/,•. •.
.
,, _ ,, • 'i'i
The -right of the petitio ners is well-embodied in Section
Article II of the 1987 Constitution. And while the right to a balance d
and healthful ecology is to be found under the Declaration of
Principles and State Policies and not under the Bill of Rights, it does''
not follow that it is less import ant than any of the civil ar.d political
rights enume rated in the latter. Such a right belongs t.o a different
category of rights altogether for it concerns nothing less than self- ·
preservation and self-perpetuation - aptly and fittingly stressed
by the petitioners - the advancement of which may even be said to
predate all governments and constitutions. As a matter of fact, these
basic rights need_not,even be written in the Constitution for they are
assumed to exist fro'trl the inception of human kind. If they are now
explicitly mentioneclin the fundamental charter it is because of the
well-founded fear of its framers that unless the ;ights to a balanced
and healthful ecology and to health are manda ted as state policies
.by the Constitution itself, thereby highlighting their continuing
importance and imposing upon the state a solemn obligation to

reserve the first and protect and advance the second , the day would
p t be too far when all else would be lost not only for the presen t
00
ration but also for those to come - generations which stand to

• 2.00 WHAT MUST EXIST BEFORE A CHANGE OF NAME MAY B

2.02 ILLUSTRATE A SITUATION WHEN A CHANGE OF NAME WILL
AVOID CONFUSION.

A Change of Name is a privilege and not a matter of
right, such-that a "proper ·a nd reasonable cause" must e · t
before it may be authorized. In granting or denying a peti;i:n ,
for change of name under Rule 103, the question of "proper and

Justific~tions advanced in support thereof. (Emelita Basilio Gan 11•
Republic of the Philippines, G.R. No. 207147, September 14, 2(1,' lX,-.

The case of Eric Chua v. Republic, G.R. No. 231998, November
20, 2017, illustrates where a change of name will avoid confusion.
As the petitioner has established, he is known in his community as

2.01 WHAT ARE THE GROUNDS DEEMED AS PROPER AN[; r-.~r-\ •

prejudiced by the use of his true and official name.

Th~ Court e,µumerated several recognized grounds that

.,.
viz.:

-~

a)

when the name is ridiculous, dishonorable or
extremely difficult to write or pronounce;

b)

when the change results as a legal consequence..
such as legitimation;

"Eric Chua, "rather than ''Eric Kiat. "Moreover, all of his credentials
exhibited before the Court, other than his Certific~te of Live Birth,
bear the name ''Eric Chua." Guilty of reiteration, 'Eric's Certificate
of Baptism, Voter Certification, Police Clearance, National Bureau
of Investigation Clearance, Passport, and Hi~h School Diploma all
reflect his surname to be "Chua."
Thus, to compel him to use the name ''Eric Kiat" at this point
would inevitably lead to confusion. Ii would result in an alteration
of all of his official documents, save for his Certificate of Liv~ Birth.
His children, too, will correspondingly be compelled to have their
records changed. For even their own Certificates of Live Birth state
that their father's surname is "Chua."
To deny this petition would then have ramifications not only to
Eric's identity in his community, but also to that of his children.
2.03 BAR Q. (2014)
Grounds for Change of Name

parents because the ~~rname ofhi~ ado~tive ~arents sounded
offensive and was seriously affectmg his business and social
life. The adoptive parents gave their consent to the petitio
for change of name. May A file a petition for change of Dllll)e~
If the RTC grants the petition for change of name,
what I l•r
.
any, will be the effect on t h e respective re )ations of A with
his adoptive parents and with his natural parents? Discuss.

SUGGESTED ANSWER:
There is no law that prohibits an adopte? child to file a petition
to change name under Rule 103. However, to justify a change of
name under Rule 103, the petitioner must show not only some proper
or compelling reasons therefor, but also that he will be prejudiced by
the use of his name. The grounds are as follows:
(a) when the name is ridiculous, dishonorable or extremely difficult to write or pronounce;
(b) when the change results as a legal consequence, as
in legitimation;
·

(c)

when the change will avoid confusion;

(d) when one has continuously used and been ,known
since childhood by a Filipino name, and was unaware ot .A.J,~n
pare~tage; ;
·,
·
• (e) a sincere desire to adopt a Filipino name to \:,- ·.- ,
signs of former alienage, all in good faith and without prejudicing anybody; and
(f) when the surname causes embarrassment and
there is no showing that the desired change of name was
for a fraudulent purpose or that the change of name would
prejudice public interest. (In re: Petition for change of narrie
and/ or correction/ cancellation of entry in civil registry of
Julian Lin Carulasan Wang also known as Julian Lin Wang,
· to be amended/corrected as Julian Lin Wang v. Cebu City Civil
Registrar; G.-Jl. No. 159966, March 30, 2005)

In the case' aj;.J.bar, none of the circumstances enumerated are
present. The assumption tp.at the surname "sounded offensive and
was seriously affecting his business and social life" do not fall under
· any of the enumerations. Moreover, it will only bring confusion if he
reassumes the surname of his natural parents because it might give

4)9

erroneous impression on the mind of

on the existence
:fhis ties with his natural parents. Hence,thehepublic
cannot file the same.

If the RTC, however, grants the petition for a change of name,

.. will not affect his relations with his adoptive parents and natural
itarents. It is a settled rule tha_t a cha~ge of n~me do~s not d_efine
p effect a change in one's existing family relations or m the ~ghts
or d duties fl.owing therefrom. It does not aJter one's legal capae1ty or

an

civil status.
4 WHAT MAY CONSTITUTE AS A PRO~R GROUND FOR

20
· OBJECTION TO CHANGE OF NAME?

Essentially, a change of name does not define or eff~~t a ch~ge
of one's existing family relations or in the rights_and du~es flowmg
therefrom. It does not alter one's legal capacity or civil ~tatus.
However, "there could be instan~es where the change applied for
may be open to objection by pa.mes who already bear the s ~ e
desired by the applicant, not because he would t?ereby acqwre
,,~ .... family ties with them but because the existence of such
~ rt ~·
. d." B
ties
might be erroneously impressed on the pu blic ~
ence,
in requests for a change of name, "what is involued is no_t a . "!ere
matter of allowance or disallowance of the request, bu~ a '!;dic:ous
eupluation of the sufficiency and proptiety of _the 1ustq1.catzo~s
advanced . . . mindful of the consequent results ui the eve~t of its
, 'grant .. . "(Republic v. Merlyn Mercadera through Attorney-in-Fact,
Ehelyn Oga,' G.R. No. 186027, December 8, 201[))
3.00 WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PUBLICATION OF THE ORDER?

Publication of the order is necessary in order for the cpurt to
acquire jurisdiction. A petition for change of name being a pr~eeding
in rem the court acquires jurisdiction to hear and deterrrune the
petitio~ only after publication of the order. (Republic v. Hernandez,
253 SCRA 509)
3.01 WHAT ARE THE REQUISITES OF A VALID p"ueLICATION?

In the context of Section 3, Rule 103 of the Rules, publication
is valid if the following requisites concur: (1) the petition_and the
copy of the order indicating the date and place for the hearrng must
be published; (2) the publication must be .at ~east once a ~eek fo;

G.R. No. 206~48, February 18, 2014

The RTC granted the respondent's petition and directed the

:Od delete the entry "Fluvio Miranda Magpayo, Jr." in the space for

The Republic of the Philippines through Office of th~ Solicitor
General assailea the decision contending that the deletion of the
entry on the date and place of marriage of respondent's parents from
his birth certificate has the effect of changing his civil status from
legitimate to illegitimate and, therefore; should ~e made through
appropriate adversarial proceedings.

DOCTRINE: It is not the father (herein respondent) oi· •he"

in his or her best interest to choose whether to use the surname

ISSUE: Whether or not the change bej.ng sought by the
respondent affects his legal status in relation to his parents

Nothing is more settled than that when the :aw is clear
and free from ambiguity, it must be taken to mean what it
says and it must, be given its literal meaning free from any
int~rpretation .

SUPREME COURT'S RULING: The change being sought in
respondent's petition goes so far as to affect his legal status in
relation to his parents. It seeks to change his legitimacy to that of
illegitimacy. Rule 103 then would not suffice to grant ; espondent's
supplication.

3. REPUBLIC v. CAPOTE
G.R. No. 157043, Februar y 2, 2007
pOCTRINE: Giovann i is entitled to ch~nge his name as he was
,iever recogniz ed by his father while his mother has always
recogniz ed him as her child. A change of name will erase the
impressi on that he was ever recogniz ed by his father. It is also
to his best interest as it will facilitat e his mother's intended
petition to have him join her in the United States. This Court
will not stand in the way of the reunific ation of 111;other and
son.

FACTS: Minor Giovanni N. Gallamaso is the illegitimate natural

child of Corazon P. Nadores and Diosdado Gallamaso. He was born
prior to the effectivity of the New Family Code and as such, his
mother used the surname of the natural father despite the absence
of marriage between them and Giovanni has been known by that
name since birth as per his birth certificate registere d at the Local
Civil Register of San Juan, Southern Leyte.
I The father, Diosdado Gallamaso, frpm the time Giovanni was
bqrn and up to the_present, failed to take up his responsibilities
to him on ~atters of financial , physical, emotional and spiritual
concerns.
Giovanni's mother might eventually petition him to join her in
the United States and his continued use of the surname Gallamaso,
the surname of his natural father, may complicate his status as
·
natural child;
Respondent Capote was appointed guardian ad litem of minor
Giovanni N. Gallamaso by virtue of a court order in Special Proc,
No. R-459, dated August 18, 1998 authorizing her to file in court
a petition for change of name of said minor in accordance with the
desire of his mother who is residing and working abroad.

ISSUE: Whether or not minor Giovanni may change his name.
SUPREME COURT'S RULING: The Rules of Court provides
the requirements and procedure for change of name. Here, the
appropria te remedy is covered by Rule 103, a separate and distinct
proceedin_g from Rule 108.

Article 172 of the Family Code provides that the filiation of
legitimate children is established by any of the following:
(1) The record of birth appearing in a civil register or a
final judgment; or
(2) An admission oflegitim ate filiation in a public document or a private handwri tten instrume nt and signed by the
parent concerned.
In the absence of the foregoing evidence, the legitimate filiation
shall be proved by:
(1) The open and continuous possession of the status of
a legitimate child; or
(2) Any othE:r means allowed by the Rules of Court and
special laws.

In effect:
Judicial approval of voluntary recognition is required only
where filiation is proved by: (1) open and continuous possession of
status of a legitimate child; or (2) any other means allowed by the
Rules of Court and special laws. (Gono-Javier v. CA, 239 SCRA 593)
The filiation of illegitimate children, like legitimate children,
is established by: (1) record of birth appearin g in the civil register
or a final judgment; or (2) an admission of legitimate filiation in a ·
public document or a private handwri tten instrume nt and signed
by the parent concerned. In the absence thereof, filiation shall be
proved by (1) the open and continuous possession of the s~atus of
a legitimate child; or (2) any other means allowed by the Rules of
Court and special laws. The due recognition _of an illegitimate child
in a record of birth, or in a will, or in a statemen t before the court of
record, or in any authenti c writing is, in itself a consummated act of
acknowledgment of a child, and no further court action is required.
·
(Gono-Javier v. CA, 239 SCRA 59_3) ·
1.02 CAN ~N ILLEGITIMATE CHILD USE THE SURNAME OF THE

the
.
d f b. h
recohr o_ irt_ ! a will, a statement before a court of record or in any
'
aut entic wntmg."

. :·· Compuls~~y recognition is sometimes also called judicial recognition, to distinguish it from that which is a pure\t· ;~,'
voluntary act of the parent. It is recognition decreed by final j u cl .,·
me~t of a competent court. It is governed by Articles 283 and 2134
~ettm_g ·forth the ca~es in which the father or mother, respectively:
Is obliged ~o recogmz~ a natural c1p.ld, and Article 285 providing
that generally, t~e action_ for recognition of natural children may be
brought only durmg the lifetime of the presumed parents.
The matter of whether or not judicial approval is needed for the
e~fi~acy of voluntary recognition i's dealt with in Article 281 of the
Civil Co.de.

. Article 281 • A clt!:._ld who is of age cannot be recognized without
h is consent.
. ·.
....

Whe~ the 1~&>gnitiop. of a minor does not take place in a
record of birth or ma will, judicial approval shall be necessary.

A minor c~ in any case impugn the recognition within
ti
our years followmg the attainment of his majority.

431

In other words, judicial approv~ is not needed if a recognition is voluntarily· made:
of a person who is of age, only his consent being
1)
necessary; or
of a minor whose acknowledgm ent is effected in a
record of birth or in a will.
2)

On the other hand, judicial approval is needed if the recognition
of the minor is effected, not through a record of birth or in a will but
through a statement in a court of record ·or an authentic document.
In any case, the individual recognized can impugn the recognition
within four years following the attainment of his majority:
Now there are no less than three writings submitted in
'
evidence in this case in which Felisa Gapusan Parcon describes
Ligaya Gapusan-Chu a as her daughter, viz.:
I

Felisa's sworn statement of assets and liabilities, in which she
names and describes Ligaya as her daughter; b) her application
for GSIS life insurance in which she again describes Ligaya as her
daughter; and c) her application for membership in the Negros
Occidental Teachers' Federation, where she names Ligaya as her
"adopted daughter."
,
Each of these writings is undoubtedly an "authentic writing"
within the contemplation of Article 278. "An 'authentic writing' for
purposes of voluntary recognition ... (is) understood as a genuine
or indubitable writing of · the father" (or mother), including "a
public instrument" (one acknowledged before a notary public or
other competent official with the formalities required by law), and,
of course, a public or official document in accordance with Sep;ion
20, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court. The sworn statement of assets
and liabilities filed by Felisa Parcon is a pubij.c document, having
been executed and submitted pursuant to a requirement of the law:
The other two writings above mentioned are, to be sure, not public
documents, but this is of no moment; n~ither of them bas to be a
public document in order to be categorized as an "authentic writing."
It is enough that they are the genuine or indubitable writings of
Felisa Gapus~n Parcon.
The fact that Ligaya had been continuously treated by Felisa
as her daughter, the proposition that Ligaya was indeed Felisa's
daughter becomes well-nigh conclusive.

the ~opra ~usiness of the Uyguangcos, which is a stri~tly
fa~y busmess; that he was a director, together with the
petitioners, of the Alu and Sons Development Corporation,
a family corporation; and that in the addendum to
the_ ?riginal extrajudicial settlement concluded by t·he
petit10ners, he was given a share in his deceased father's
estate.

ISSUE: Whethec__or not private respondent should be allowed
to pro_ve that he rs an illegitimate child of his claimed father,
w~o is alrea~y'3.dead, in the absence of the documentary
evidence required by the Civil Code.
. SUPREME _COURT'S RULING: The Court finds that this case
must be decided under a new if not entirely dissimilar set of rul~s

Article 175. Illegitimate children may establish their
illegitimate filiation in the same w_ay and on the same evidence
as legitimate children.
The following provision is, therefore, ~also available to the
private respondent in proving his illegitimate filiation:

Article 172. The filiation of legitimate children is established by
anY of the following:
(1) The record of birth appearing in the civil register or
a final judgment; or (2) An admission of legitimate filiation in
a public document or a private handwritten instrument and
signed by the parent concerned.
·

In the absence of the foregoing evidence, the legitimate filiation
shall be proved by:
(1) The open and continuous possession of the status of a
legitimate child; or (2) Any other means allowed by the Rules of
Court and special laws.
,
The problem of the private respondent, however, is that, since
he seeks 't o prove his filiation under the sectmd paragraph of Article
172 of the Family Code, his action is now barred because of his
alleged father's death in 1975. The second paragraph ofthis Article
175 reads as follows:

.\' /1

The action must be brought within the same period specified in Article 173, except when the action is based on the second paragraph of Article 172, in which case the action may be
brought during the lifetime of the alleged parent. (Italics supplied.)
..,

It is clear that the private respondent can no longer be allowed
at this time to introduce evidence of his open and continuous
possession of the status of an illegitin1ate child or prove his alleged
filiation -through any of the means allowed by the Rules of Co~t
or special laws. The simple reason is that Apolinario Uyguangco 1s
already dead and can no longer be heard on the claim of his alleged
son's illegitimate filiation.

family r~s1~e.nce - there 1s no need to constitu te the same judicial}Y
or extraJudic1ally.

In Cabang , et al. v. Mr. and Mrs. Basay, G.R. No. 180587

March 20, 2009, the Suprem e Court declared:

..

'

As ~efined, ~1'fi:e family ho~e is a sacred symbol of family
lov~ a~d ~ the reP_ository of cherishe d memorie s that last dnring
.

o~e s lifetime. It is the dwellin g house where the husband rard
wife, or an unmarr ied head of a family reside, inc!uri\1;· '.1he
l~nd on which it is situated . It is constitu ted j ointly _ .tC
hus_band and the wife or by an unmarr ied head of a family."
Articl~ 153 of the Family C_ode provide s that - Lhe family
home 1s deemed constitu ted from the time it is 0ccupied as a
family residenc e. From the time of its constitu tion and so long
as any of its benefici aries actually resides therein, the family
home continu es to be such and is exempt from execution, forced
sale or attachm ent except as hereina fter provide d and to the
extent of the value allowed by law. The actual value of the
family home· sha_)l not exceed, at the time of its constitution,
the amount ofP300, 000.00 in urban areas and P200,000.00 in
~ural areas. Un~ r the 3:.fore-quoted provision, a family home
is deemed constitu ted on a house and a lot from the time it is
occupied as a family residenc e. There is no need to constitu te
the same judiciall y or extrajud icially.

Yes . Article 159 of the Family Code is ex plicit:
"The family home shall continue despite the dea th of one
or both spouses or of tbe unmarri ed head of the family for a
period of ten years or for as long as there is a minor beneficiary,
and the heirs cannot partition the same unless the court find s
compelling reasons therefor . This rule shall, apply regardless
of whoever owns the property or constitu ted the family home.''
The Suprem e Court had the occasion to explain the importance
of Article 159 of the Family Code in the case of Vilma G. Arriola
and Anthony Ronald G. Arriola u. John Nabor C. Arriola, G.R.
No. 177703, January 28, 2008. It held that the purpose of Article
159 is to avert the disinteg ration of the family unit following the
death of its head. To this ~nd, it preserve s the family home as t he
physical symbol of family love, security , and unity by imposing the
following restricti ons on its partitio n: first , that the heirs cannot
extrajudicially partitio n it for a period of ten years from the death
of one or both spouses or of the unmarr ied head of the family, or for
a longer period, if there is still a minor beneficiary residing therein;
and second, that the heirs cannot judicial ly partitio n it during the
aforesaid periods unless the court finds compelling rea~ons therefor .
No compelling reason has been alleged by the parties nor has the
RTC found any compelling reason to order the pariitio n of the family
home, either by physical segrega tion or assignm ent to any of the
heirs or through auction sale as suggest ed by the parties.
More importa ntly, Article 159 imposes the proscription
against the immedi ate partitio n of the family home regardle ss of its
ownership. This signifies that even if the family home bas passed by
succession to the co-ownership of the heirs, or has been willed to any
one of them, this fact alone cannot transfor m the family home into
an ordinary property , much less dispel the protection cast u-pon it by
the law . The rights of the individu al co-owper or owner of the family
home cannot subjuga te the rights gr.anted under Article 159 to the
beneficiaries of the family home.
From the time of its constitu tion and so long as any of its
beneficiaries actually resides therein, the family home continues to
be such and is exempt from execution, forced sale or attachm ent
exce_pt as hereina fter provided and to the extent of the value aµowed

by law. Thus, applying tb~se conc_e pt_s in the ca~e at'bar, the subfoct
house as well as the spec~c ,portion of th~ subJect land on which it
stands are deemed constituted as a family home ~y the deceased
and petitioner from the moment they -~ egan occupyi~g the same as
8 family residence 20 years ba~k. Article 159 promles that: "The
family home shall continue despite ~he death o( one or both spouses
or of.the unmarried head of the family for a period of ten years or for
as long as there is a minor beneficiary, and the heirs cannot partition,
the same unless the court finds compelling reasons therefor." This rule
shall apply regardless of whoever owns the property or constituted
the family home.
2.00 MAY A FAMILY HOME BE, ESTABLISHED ON PROPERTY
HELD IN CO-OWNERSHIP WITH THIRD PERSONS?
No. A family home cannot be established on property held in
co-ownership with third persons.
•

There can be no question that a family home is generally
exempt from execution, provided it was duly constituted as such.
It is likewise ;given that the family home must be constituted on
property owned by the persons constituting it. Indeed as pointed out
in Kelley, Jr. v. Planters Products, Inc., 557 SCRA 499 (2008), "The

family home must be part of the properties of the absolute community
or the conjugal partnership, or of the exclusive properties of either
spouse with the latter's consent, or on the property of the unmarried
head of the family."
In other words: The family home must be establislh .
the properties of: (a) the absolute community, or (b) the coujuc:-c!.l
partnership, or (c) the exclusive property of either spouse with the
consent of the other. It cannot be established on property held in
co-ownership with third persons. However, it can be 3stablished
partly on community property, or conjugal property and partly on
the exclusive property of either spouse with the consent of the latter ..
If constituted by an unmarried head of a family, where there is no
communal or conjugal property existing, it can be constituted only
on his or her own property . .(Cabang, et al. v. Mr. and Mrs. Basay,

G.R. No. 180587, March 20, 2009)

'
2.01 SUMMARlZE '(HE RULES ON CONSTITUTION OF FAMILY
HOMES FOR- PURPOSES OF EXEMPTION FROM EXECU·
TION.
. .
·
~e rules on constitution of family homes, for purposes of
exemption from execution, could be summarized as follows:

CHAPTER 13

439r,

Rule 106 - Constitution of family Home

First, family residenC'es constructed before the effectivit!
of the Family Code or before August 3, 1988 mu~t b_e _con~ltuted as a family liome either judicia~y. or extr~Judiqally m
accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code m order to be
exempt from execution;
Second, family residences constructed after the eff~ctivity of the Family Code on August 3, _1988 are automatic~y
deemed to be family homes and thus exempt from execut1?n
from the time it was constituted and lasts as long as any of its
beneficiaries actually resides therein;
•

Third, family residences which. were not _judicially
or extrajudicially constituted as a family h?~e pnor to the
effectivity of the Family Code, but were ~xistmg thereafter,
are considered as family homes by operation of law _and are
prospectively entitled to the benefits accorded to a family home
under the Family Code.
These rules find 'application in the case of Spouses
Aracelis Olivio-De Mesa and Ernesto De Mesa v. Spouses
Claudio and Rufina Acero, G.R. No. 185?64, J~nuary 16, 2~12.
Here the subject property became a family reSidence sometlille
in J;nuary 1987. There was no showing, however, th~t the sa°:1e
was judicially or extrajudicially constituted as_ a family home rn
accordance with the p.r:ovision of the Civil Code. Still, ,,/hen the Family
Code took effect on August 3, 1988, the subject property became a
family home by operation oflaw and was thus pi-os~ectively_exempt
from execution. The petitioners were, thus, correct m asserting that
the subject property as a family home.

The Family Code clearly provides that for the purpose of
tracting a second marriage , the present spouse must file a
00
c urnmary proceedi ng for the declarati on of the presump tive death of
:he absentee , without prejudice to the effect of-the reappear ance of
the absent spouse. (Republic v. Yolanda Granada , G.R No. 187512,

June 13, 2012)
3.01 WHAT IS THE REASON BEHIND THE REQUISI TE JUDICIA L
DECLAR ATION OF PRESUM PTIVE DEATH OF THE ABSENT
SPOUSE ?
The requisite judicial declarati on of presump tive death of the
absent spouse (and conseque ntly, the applicati on of a stringent
standard for its issuance) is also for the present spouse's benefit.
It is intended to protect him/her from a criminal prosecuti on of
bigamy under Article 349 of the Revised Penal Code which might
come into play if he/she would prematu rely remarry sans the court's
declaratio n. Upon the issuance of the decision dfclaring his/her
absent spouse presump tively dead, the present spouse's good faith
' in contracti ng a second marriage is effective ly establish ed. The
decision of the competen t court constitut es s1tlficien t proof of his/
her good faith and his/her criminal intent in case of remarria ge is
effectivel y negated. Thus, for purposes of remarria ge, it is necessary
to strictly comply with the stringen t standard and have the absent
spouse judicially declared presump tively dead. (Republic u. Cantor,
G.R. No. 184621, Decembe r 10, 2013)
3.02 WHAT ARE THE REQUISI TES FOR THE DECLAR ATION OF
PRESUM PTIVE DEATH?

As noted by the Court in that cas~, the four requisite s for the
declarati on of presump tive death under the Family Code are as
follows:
That the absent spouse has been missing for four
1)
years, or two consecuti ve years if the disappea rive

The premise is that Article 41 of the Family Code places upon

THE CONCE PT OF WELL-FOUNDED BELIEF AS A

REPUB LIC v. NILDA V. TAMPUS

Perlas-B ernabe, J.
-\
DOCTRINE: The "well-fo unded belief' in the absentee's death
requires the present spouse to prove that his/her belief was the
result of diligent and reasonable efforts to locate the absent

Respond ent Nilda B. Tampus (Nilda) was married to Dante
L. D~l Mundo (Dante) on Novembe r 29, 1975 in Cordova,
Cebu.
On December 2, 1975, Dante, a inemberc if the Armed Forces
of the Philippin es (AFP), left responde nt, and went to Jolo,
Sulu where he was assigned . Since then, Nilda heard no
news from Dante. She tried every'thing to locate him by
inquiring from his parents, relatives , and neighbors, but
her efforts proved futile.
Thus, on April 14, 2009, she filed before the RTC a petition
to declare Dante as presump tively dead for the purpose
of remarria ge, alleging that after the lapse of thirty-th ree
(33) years without any kind of communication from him,
she firmly believes that he is already dead.
;,

The RTC granted Nilda's petition and declared Dante as
presump tively dead for_~ll legal purposes, without prejudice
to the effect of his reappear ance. It found that Dante left
the conjugal dwelling sometime in 1975 and from then on,
Nilda never heard from him again despite diligent efforts
to locate him. In this light, she believes that he had passed
away especially since his last assignme nt was a combat
mission.

~he Court of Appeals erred in upholding the RTC Decision
declanng Dante as presumptively dead.
Before a judicial declaration of presumptive death can be
obtained, it must be shown that the prior spouse had been absent for
four consecutive years and the present spouse had a well-founded
belief that the prior spouse was already dead. Under Article 41 of
the Family Code of the Philippines (Family Code), there are four (4)
essential re_q uisites for the declaration of presumptive death: (1) tbru
th.e absent spouse h~s been missing for four (4) consecutive year.,, ' ··
two (2) consecutive years if the disappearance occurred where th,,·i:
is danger of death under the circumstances laid down in Article 391
of the Civil Code; (2) that the present spouse wishes to remarry; (3)
that-the present spouse has a well-founded belief that the absentee
is dead; and (4) that the present spouse files a summary proceeding
for the declaration of presumptive death of the absentee.

The "well-founded belief" in the absentee's death requires
the present spouse to prove that his/her belief was the result of
diligent and reasonable efforts to locate the absent spouse and that
based on these efforts and inquiries, he/she believes that under the
circumstances, the'" absent spouse is already dead. It necessitates
exertion of active effqrt, not a passive one. As such, the mere absence
of the spouse for
periods prescribed under the law, lack of anY
news that such absentee spoJJse is still alive, failure to communicate,
or general presumption of absence under the Civil Code would not
suffice. The premise is that Article 41 of the Family Code places
upon the present spouse the burden of complying with the stringent

su.~

In this case, Nilda testified that she tried to locate him by makhereabouts, but unfortunat~ly, they also cJ,id not k~ow where to find
~im, Other than making said inquiries, however, Nilda made not;;~
h efforts to find her husband. She could have called or procee e
~o e~e AFP headquarters to request information ·about her hu~~and,
but failed to do so. She did not even ~eek the help of the authorities or
h AFP itself in finding him. Considering her own pronouncement
the t Dante was sent by the AFP on a combat mission to Jplo, Sulu at
~h: time of his disappearance, she could have inquired from the AFP
the status of the said mission, or from the members of the AFP who
assigned thereto. To the Court's mind, therefore, Nilda failed to
actively look for her mis,sing husband, and her p~rported ea:nest
efforts to find him by asking Dante's parents, rel~~wes, and f:iends
did not satisfy the strict standard and degree of diligence required to
create a "well-founded belief' of his death.

:re

, What appears from the facts as established in this case was
that Nilda simply allowed the passage of time without actively and
diligently searching for her husband, which the Court c~ot ac~ept
as constituting a "well-founded belief that her husband 1s dead.

3.06 IS THE JUDGMENT IN A PETITION· FOR DECLARATION OF
PRESUMPTIVE DEATH IMMEDIATELY FINAL AND EXECUTORY?

The hearing of a petition for the declaration of presu~pti~e
death is a summary proceeding under the Family Cod~ and is
thus governed by Title XI thereof. Article 24 7 the Family Code
provides that the judgment of the trial court m summary cou:t
proceedings shall be immediately final and executory. Th,_µs , there ~s
no reglementary period within which to.perfect an appeal. (Republic

4.00 CASES
1. REPUBLIC v. MARIA FE CANTOR

G.R. No. 184621, December 10, 2013

DOCTRINE: In sum, the Court viewed that the respond
.
''p
.
ent
mere ly engage d m a
asswe search" where she relied
.
.
.
""
h
.
uncorro bora t ed-. inquiries I rom er m-laws, neighbors a ond
.friends. She failed to conduct a diligent search because hn
alleged efforts are insufficient to form a well-founded beli;
that her husband was already dead.

FACTS: The respondent and Jerry were married and they lived
together as husband and wife in their conjugal dwelling in Agan
Homes, Koronadal City, South Cotabato. Sometime in January
1998, the couple had a quarrel. After their quarrel, Jerry left their
conjugal dwelling and it was the last time that the respondent '3J''3r
saw him. Since then, she had not seen, communicated nor l1d (f~
anything .from Jerry or his whereabouts.
On May 21, 2002, or more than four years from the tim,_i of
Jerry's disappearance, the respondent filed before the Regional
Trial Court a petition for her husband's declaration of presumptive
death. She claimed that she had a well-founded belief tl.dt Jerry was
already dead. She alleged that she had inquired from her mother-inlaw, her brothers-in-law, her sisters-in-law, as well as her neighbors
and friends, but to no avail In the hopes of finding Jerry, she also
allegedly made it a point to check the patients' directory whenever
she went to a hospital. All these earnest efforts, the respondent
claimed, proved _futi_le, prompting her to file the petition in court.
The Regional Trial Court granted the petition which the Court
of Appeals affirmed::::Oismayed by the ruling of the court, petitioner
filed a petition for review on·certiorari.

· ISS_DE: Whether or not the respondent had a well-founded
belief that her husband is already dead.

the respondent's well-founded belief was not enough or there was
Jack of earnest effort to find her husband. The re~so~s a re as follows :
l) the respondent did not actively look for heT rn1ssrng husband. she
did not purposely undertake a diligent se~ch f?r h~T husband as
her hos-pital visits were not planned nor pnmanly direc~ed to l~ k
; hi' m• 2) she did not report Jerry's absence to the police nor did
,or
'
·
h did
she seek the aid of the authoriti_e s to look: for ?1m;
3) s e _ not
resent as witnesses Jerry's relatwes or their ne1ghbors and friends,
~vho can corroborate her efforts to locate Jerry;~and 4) th~re w_as
other corroborative evidence to supp?rt the respondent s cJ~m
00
b t she conducted a diligent search. Ne1tber was there supporting
t ~dence proving that she had a well-founded belief other than her
~::.e claims that she inquired from her friends and in-laws about her
husband's whereabouts.

In sum, the Court viewed that the respondent merely_eng~~ed
in a "passive search" where she reli~d on uncorro~orated inqumes
fr m her in-laws neighb'ors and friends. She failed to conduct a
~igent search b~cause her alleged efforts are insufficient to form a
well-founded belief that her husband was already dead.
2. REPUBLIC v. COURT OF APPEALS
G.R. No. 163604, May~-, 2005
}

DOCTRINE: There is no doubt that the petition of Apolinaria
Jomoc is a summary proceeding under the Family Code and
not a special proceeding under the Revisl?d Rules of Court
which requires a record on appeal. It being a summary
ordinary proceeding, the filing of a notice of appeal from the
trial court's order sufficed.

,. The trial court; noting that no record of appeal was fil d
and served i"as required · by and pursuant to Section 2( ~)
Rule 41 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, the presea '
case being a special proceeding," disapproved the notice~}
appeal.
•

The Republi<s . Motion · for ~econsideration of the •trial
court's order of disapproval had been denied. Petitioner
contended that the declaration of presumptive death
of a person under Article 41 of the Family Code is not a
special proceeding or a case of multiple or separate appeals
requiring a record on appeal.

ISSUE: Whe-ther or not a petition for declarat ion of the
presump tive death of a person is in the nature of a special
proceed ing, thus, a record on appeal is needed.

On June 7, 2016, th~ Philippfue Consulate Office (PCO)
in
Calgary, Alber ta subm itted a Report of Birth of Zion Pearl
to the nation al office of the Philip pine Statis tics Authority
(PSA) in Manila. Unfor tunate ly, throu gh oversi
ght
or mista ke, the PCO erroneously indicated the child's
birthd ate as June 27, 2016, instea d of June 27, 2015,
in
the said repor t. Roice Anne broug ht the said discrepancy
to
the attent ion of flte concerned officials of the PCO which
,
instea d of taking imme diate action , advised her to file
a
petiti on before the proper court in t~ Philip pines for
the
correction of entry in the Report of Birth of her daugh ter.
Roice Anne filed before the RTC of Davao City, where_she
was a reside nt, a petitio n to correct the report o[ _birth.
However, the RTC motu proprio dismiss_e~ the petltl on
_on
the groun d of lack of jurisdiction. The pet11:1on for correc

the
Philip pine Statis tics Office in Mani la shoul d ha~e been

CHAPTER 15
Cancellation or Correction of-Entries in the Civil Registry

.o3~ WHO MAY FILE PETITION FOR CANCELLAT ION OR COR1
RECTION OF ENT~IES IN THE CIVIL REGISTRY?

Any person interested in any act, event, order or decree
ncerning the civil status of persons which has been recorded in
c~e civil register, may file a verified petition for the cancellat_ion
t correction of any entry relating thereto, with the Court of Fust
~~stance of the province where the corre~pondin g civil registry is
located. (Sec. 1, Rule 108)
1.04 HOW MAY CORRECTIO N OF ENTRIES ee EFFECTED?

The first is without judicial authority, an administrat ive
roceeding governed by R.A. No. 9048. It is a simplified procedure
for the correction of clerical or typographica l errors_ (or change_ of
first name or nickname) in the civil register. It ma! _be ~ed with
th~ Local Civil R~gistrar's Office of the city or m~c1p~ty W:h~re
the record sought to be corrected is kept. Where a c1tizen 1s ~e~1~g
abroad, the petition shall be filed with the ne~est P~ppme
Consulate. The petition may be denied if the error. IS not clencal or
typographica l o~ it affects the civil status of a person.
The second is through a judicial proceeding governed
by Rule 108. What may be corrected in this procee~g are cle~ic~l
er.rors and substantial errors . Howev er,_in substantial errors, it IS
r J quired that the proceeding is adversarial and ndt summary. This
means among others, that the p etition must b e verified, should
irnplead the civil registrar and all persons wpo have or claim any
interest which would be affected thereby . (Lee v. CA, G.R. No.
118387, October 11 , 2001)
1.05 IS THE PROCEEDIN G UNDER RULE 108 SUMMARY OR AD-

CHAPTER 15
Cancellation or Correction of Entries in the Civil.Registry

The "appropriate adversary proceeding'' should be
b.
~vailed of when what is involved are substantial errors in a civil
registry. The Supreme Court, citing the case of Republic v. Valencia,
ru1ed that even substantial errors may be corrected and the true
facts established provided the parties aggrieved by the error
avail themselves of the appropriate adversary proceeding. The
announcement of the court in that case is illuminating:

"It is undoubtedly true that if the subject matter of apetition is not for the correction of clerical errors of a harm.less
and innocuous nature, but one involvin~ nationality or citizenship, which is indisputably substantial as well as controv~rte~,
affirmative relief cannot be granted in a proceeding which lS
summary in nature. However, it is also true that a right in law
may be enforced and a wrong may be remedied·as long _as _the
appropriate remedy is used. This court adheres to the pnnciple
that even substantial errors in a civil registry may be corrected
and the true facts established provided the parties aggrieved
by the error av,ail themselves of the appropriate adversary
proceeding." (Republic u. Dr. Norma S. Lugsanay Uy, G.R. No.
198010, August 12, 2013)
What is meant by "appropriate adversary proceeding"?
c.
Black's Law Dictionary defines "adversary proceeding" as follows:
One having opposing parties; contested, as distinguis~ed
from an ex parte application, one of whicli the party seeking
relief has given legal warning to the other party, and affor~ed
the latter an opportunity to contest it. Excludes an adoption
proceeding. (Republic v. Dr. Norma S. Lugsanay Uy, G.R. N9.

1 11 WHY MUST THE LOCAL CIVIL REGISTRAR BE IMPLEADED
IN A PETITION FOR A SUBSTANTIAL CORRECTl~N OF EN.
TRY UNDER RULE 108?
The local civil registrar must be impleaded_sin~e he is an indispensable party without whom no final determmation of the case
•
can be had.
Rule 108 of the Rules of Court provides . the J?rocedure for
the correction of substantial changes in the c_ vi.l registry t~ou~h
an appropriate adversary proceeding. An adversary p~o~ee~g is
defined as one "having opposing parties,· contested, as disti~guis~~~
from an ex parte application, one of which the party seeking re ie
has given legal warning to the other party, and afforded the latter an

opportunity to contest it."

RAMON CORPUS TAN v. OFFICE OF THE LOCAL
CIVIL REGISTRAR OF MANILA AND THE
PHILIPPINE STATISTICS AUTHORITY
G.R. No. 211435, April 10, 2019
DOCTRINE: A clerical error is one which is visible to the ey
or obvious to the understanding; an error made by a clerk es
"b
•
or
a t ranscn er; a mistake
in copying or writing, or a harmless
change s~ch as a correction of name that is clearly misspelled
or of a ml.BBtatement of the occupation of the parent.
On the other hand, substantial or contentious alterations
may be allowed only in adversarial proceedings, in which al/interested parties are imp leaded and due process is prop e rly
observed. Corrections in the name, whether of the oum.£'!' of
the Certificate oi Live Birth or any of the paren ts in d :- · 1
therei~ may also involve substantial and contrm_,,, , .
matters which would require an adversarial proceeding.
In this case, the alleged error could not be considered a clerical
error or a readily apparent mistake. Contrary to petitioner's
claim, the correction sought. would definitely h a ve an effect
on his filiation with the persons named in '1. is Certificate of
Live Birth. Verily, the "correction" of petitioner's name from
"Ramon Corpus Tan Ko" to "Ramon Corpuz Tan" would
necessarily affee,t not only his name, but also the names of his
parents as entered in his Certificate of Live Birth.

H e was born on November 13, 1965 at St. Paul

2.

That his birth was duly regis tered in the civil r egistry

3.

That he had been using h.is real ~aroe "Ramon Corpuz

4.

That when he later secured a copy of bis Certificate of

as "Ramon Corpus Tan Ko" instead of his true and
correct name which is "Ramon Corpuz Tan";

5.

That the aforesaid material errors and mistakes in
the entries of bis Certificate of Live Birth were due to
inadvertence and error of the hospital personnel who
prepared the s ubject certificate;

6.

That "Ko ," which was the first name of his father ,
was inadvertently included in his last name; and that
the mistake was not immediately rectified because

In its assailed Order dated December 27, 2011, the RTc
dismissed the subject petition for correction of entry. Th
RTC ratiocinated that the petitioner failed to comply wit~
the requir_ements of an adversarial proceeding noting that
the correction sought for, is a substantial correction and is
governed by Rule 108 of the Rules of Court, which is not
summary, but an adversarial proceeding. The appellat
court concurred ~t4 the trial ~ourt that the error sough~
to be corr~cted 1s a substantial one _which requires an
adversarial proceeding.

ISSUES:
1.

Whether or not the correction sought by the petitioner
constitutes substantial change.

2.

Whether or not the petitioner failed to observe the
requirements of an adversarial proceeding in thiE: case.

3.

Whether or not the petitioner failed to prove hj s .~ 1 ;,
action.

· ·-

RULING:
1.

The correction sought by petitioner involves a substantial
change, not a mere clerical error. Rule 108 of the Revised Rules
of Court governs the proceeding for the cancellation or correction of any entry concerning the civil status of persons which
has been recorded in the civil register.
A clerical error is one which is visible to the eyes or
obvious to the understanding; an error made by a clerk or a
transcriber; , a mistake in copying or writing, or a harmless
change such as a correction of name that is clearly misspelled·
or of a mis~ tatement of the occupation of the parent. On the
other han'a-, . substantial or contentious alterations may be
allowed on.l~ n adversarial proceedings, in wruch all interested
parties are implead.ed and due process is properly observed.
Substantial and controversial alterations include those which
may affect the citizenship, legitimacy of paternity or filiation ,
or legitimacy of marriage.

465

Corrections in the name, whether of the owner of the
Certificate of ~ive Birth or any of the parents indicated therein,
may also involve substantial and controversial matters which
would require an adversarial proceeding.

In this case, the alleged error could not be considered a
clerical error or a readily apparent mistake. Contrary to petitioner's claim, the correction sol!,ght would definitely have an
effect on his filiation with the persons named in his Certificate
of Live Birth. Verily, the "correction" of petitioner's name from
''Ramon Corpus Tan Ko" to ''Ramon Corpuz Tan" would necessarily affect not only his name, but also the names of his parents
as entered in his Certificate of Live Birth.
2.

Petitioner failed to comply with the procedural requirements of
an adversarial proceeding under Rule 108.
Section 3 Rule 108 of the Rules of Court provides that the
civil registrar 'and all persons who have or claim any_interest
which would be affected by the cancellation or correct10n of an
entry in the civil register, shall be made parties to the proceeding.
From the foregoing, it is clear that there are circ~ances which impelled the Court to , excuse the failm:e to unplead
indispensable parties in proceedings for Cjl.IlCellation or correction of entry.
, Contrary to the submissions by ~e par~e_s, it is Lu_gsanay
Uy which finds application to the present petition. In srud ca_se,
the private respondent sought the ":orrection~ of ..her name
in her Certificate of Live Birth from Anita Sy' to No~ma S.
Lugsanay," impleading the -Local Civil Registrar of Gmgoog
City as respondent. The Court ruled that respondent should
have impleaded her parents and siblings as the persons :'ho
have interest, and are affected by the ·¾an~es or corre~ti~ns
she wanted to make. Simply put, imp. lding aD<l notifying
only the local civil registrar is not enough.
The fact that the_notic~ of hearin~ was published ine:
newspaper of general ciiculat10n and notice thereof was s :
upon the State will not change the nature of t~e r:~eeRul!:

the entry whose cancellation or correction is sought.

'-

-

There can be no doubt that when an opposition to the petition •
is filed either by the Civil Registrar or any p~rson having or claiming
anY interest in the entries sought to be cancelled and/or corrected
and the opposition is actively prosecuted, the proceedings thereon
become adversary proceedings.
Thus, in the case of G.R. No. 209527, February 14, 2018,
Reyes Jr., J., the Republic incorrectly argued that the petition for
correction under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court is limited to changes
in entries containing, harmless and innocuous errors.
2.02 CITE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE JURISDICTIONAL REQUIRE·
MENTS·UNDER RULE 108.

a. Article 412 of the Civil Code declares that "no entry in a
civil register shall be changed or corrected, without judicial order."
The Rules of Court supplements Article 412 df the Civil Code by
specifically providing for a special remedial proceeding by which
entries in the civil registry may be judicialzy cancelled or corrected.
Rule 108 of the Rules of Court sets in detail the jurisdictional
and procedural requirements that must be complied with before
a judgment, authorizing the cancellation or correction, may be
annotated in the civil registry. It also requires, among others, that
the verified petition must be filed with the RTC of the provmce where
the corresponding civil registry is located; that the civil registrar
and all persons who have or claim any interest must be made parties
to the proceedings; and that the time and plac't. fo:r; hearing must
be published in a newspaper of general circulation. AB these basic ·
jurisdictional requirements have not been mebn the case of Gerbert
Corpuz u. Daisylyn Sto. Tomas, G.R. No. 186571 , August 11: 2010,
the Supreme Court, thus, did not consider the petition filed W1th the
RTC as one filed under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court.
b. Improper venue is shown in the case of R~public u. Julian

Peralta , J.

Is the Civil Service Commi ssion an indispe nsable party to
respond ent's petition for correct ion of his date of birth under
Rule 108?

DOCTRINE: Under Section 7, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court,
an indispe nsable party is a party in interest withou t whom
no final determ ination can be had of an action and shall
be joined as plaintif /{l or defenda nts. If there is a failure
to implead an indispe nsable party, any judgme nt rendere d
would have no effectiv eness.
In ih iiN;_ase, while respond ent implea ded the BOC when
he amende~ his petition for correct ion of entry, he did not
implead theC SC. J:o stress, the CSC is the central personn el
agency of the governm ent and, as such, keeps and mainta ins
the persona l records of all official s and employe es in the civil
service.

Rule 108 -

CHAPTER 15
Cancellatio11 or Cor-..ection of Entries in t he ffivil Registry

4.71

Consid ering that the CSC is an indispe nsable party, it
should have been implead ed in respond ent's petition , and
sent a person al notice to comply with the require ments of fair
play and due process , before it could be affected by the decision grantin g the correct ion of his date of birth. The CSC
should have been afforde d due process before its interest be
affected , no matter how the proceed ing was classifie d. Thus,
the CSC correct ly denied respond ent's request for correcti on
of his date of birth on the basis of the RTC decision grantin g•
the correct ion.

FACTS:
On April 16, 2014, respond ent Pacol Disumir nba Rasuma n,
a Senior Executiv e Assistan t in the Bureau of Custom s
(BOC), filed before the RTC of Lanao del ~ur, Br3:nch 9,
Marawi City, a verified petition for correctio n of his date
of · birth from Februar y 12, 1952 to Februar y 12, 1956,
implead ing as respond ent the Local Civil Registra r of
Maranta o, Lanao del Sur. Respond ent Later filed an
amende d petition to implead the BOC.
In its decision dated July 23, 2015, the RTC granted the
petition and ordered the correcti on of his date of birth from
Februar y 12, 1952 to Fet,.ruar y 12, 1956. On January 21 ,
2016, respond ent filed with the Civil Service Commis si?n•
Nationa l Capital Region (CSC-N CR) a request for correctio n
of his date of birth in his service record. Howeve r, the
request was denied. It ruled that respond ent's employm ent
and school records showed otherwi se. Upon respond ent's
petition for review with the CSC Proper, the latter
dismisse d the said petition and held that it is not bound
by the July 23, 2015 RTC decision because it was not
implead ed_therein, althoug h it was an indispen sable party
and such decision would have no effect insofar as the CSC
is concern ed.
The respond ent's MR before the CSC 'was denied by it,
he filed a petition for Teview with the Court of Appeals .
The CA granted the petition . The CA held that a petition
directed against the thing itself or the res, which concern s
the status of . a person, like correctio n of entries in the
birth certifica te, is an action in rem and which jurisdict ion
over the person of the defenda nt is not a prerequ isite to

ISSUE: Is the Civil Service Commi ssion an indispe nsable
pq.rty to respon dent's petitio n for correct ion of his d ate of
birth under Rule 108?
SUPRE ME COURT 'S RULIN G: Yes, CSC is an indispen sable

party to respond ent's petition for correcti on of his date of birth
upder Rule 108.
Under Section 7, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court, an indispen sable
party is a party in interest without whom no final determi nation can
be had of an action and shall be joined as plaintiff s or defenda nts. If
there is a failure to implead an indispe nsable party, any judgmen t
:endere d would ha~e no effectiv eness. In this case, while respond ent
1mplead ~d t.!].e BOC when he amende d his petition for correctio n of
entry, he did-not implead the CSC. To stress the CSC is the central
pe!sonn el ag~ncy of the governm ent and, as' such, keeps and main·
tam~ the persona l re.cords of all officials and employe es in the civil
service.
While there may be cases where the Court held that the failure
to implead and notify the affected or interest ed parties may be cured

bY the publicat io~ ?f the ~10tice of hearing , such as earnest efforts
were made b~ pet1t10n ers m bringing to court all possible interest ed
parties,. the mteres~ ed parties themsel ves initiated the correctio n
proceed ings, th~re is no actual or presump tive awarene ss of the
e,c.istence of the mterest ed parties, or when a party is inadver tently
left out, none of them applies in respond ent's case.
In this case, while respond ent' implead ed the BOC when he
amende d his petition for correcti on of entry, he did not implead •
the CSC. To stress, the CSC is the central personn el agency of the
governm ent and, as such, keeps and maintai ns the persona l records
of all officials and employe es in the civil service. Notwith standing
that respond ent knew that the correcti on of his date of birth would
have an effect on the conditio n of his employm ent', he still did not
exert earnest efforts in bringin g to court the CSC, and there is no
showing that the CSC was only inadver tently len out. We, therefor e,
find no basis for the CA's ruling that respond ent's case falls
under the exceptio nal circums tances where the failure to implead
indispen sable parties was excused .

Conside ring that the CSC is an indispen sable party, it should
have been implead ed in respond ent's petition. , and sent a persona l
notice to comply with the require ments of fair play and due process,
before it could be affected by the decision grantin g the correcti on of
his date of birth. The CSC should have been' afforded due process
before its interest be affected , no matter how the proceed ing was
classifie d. Thus, the CSC correctl y denied· respond ent's request
for correcti on of his date of birth on the basis of the RTC decision
granting the correcti on.

3.01 LANDMARK CASE

ROMMEL JACINTO DANTES SILVERIO v. REPUBLIC
G.R. No. 174689, October 22, 2007
~OCT~I~: Under the Civil Register Law, a birth certificate
is a historical record of the facts as they existed at the time
0 ( birth. Thu,s, the sex of a person is determined at birth,
vi~ua~ly done by the birth attendant (the physician or
midwife) by examining the genitals of the infant. Considering
that th~re is:7!o law legally recognizing sex reassignment, the
determinatio,~ of a person's sex made at the time of his or her
birth, if not at-tended by error, is immutable.
FACTS:
Petitioner Rommel Jacinto Dantes Silverio filed a petition
for the change of his first name and sex in his birth

~ule 108 -

~
_CHAPTER16
Cancellation or Correction of Entries in the CiTil Registry

477

certificate in. the' RTC of Manila. The petition impleaded
the civil z:egistrar of Manila as respondent.
Petitioner alleged in his petition that his name was
registered as "Rommel Jacinto Dantes Silverio" in his birth
certificate. His sex was registered as "male." He further
alleged that he is a male transsexual, that is, "anatomically
male but feels, thinks and a~ts as a female."
His attempts to transform himself to a "woman" culminated •
when he underwent sex reassignll,}ent surgery in Thailand.
He was thereafter examined by Dr. Marcelino Reysio-Cruz,
Jr., a plastic and reconstruction surgeon in the Philippines
who issued a medical certificate attesting that he had in
fact undergone the procedure. From the'n on, petitioner
lived as a female and was in fact engaged to be married.
The · trial court rendered a decision in fa var of petitioner.
Republic of the Philippines, through the OSG, filed · a
petition for certiorari alleging that there is no law allowing
the change of entries in the birth certificate by reason of
sex alteration.
Petitioner essentially claims that the change of his name
and sex in his birth certificate is allowed under Articles
407 to 413 of the Civil Code", Rules 103 and 108 of the Rules
of Court and R.A. No. 9048.

ISSUE: Whether or not petitioner is• entitled to change his
first name and gender in his certificate of live birth by reason
of sex reassignment surgery.

SUPREME COURT'S RULING: A change of name is a privilege,
not a right. Petitions for change of name are controlled by statutes.
Under R.A. No. 9048, a correction in the civil registry involving
the change of sex is not a mere clerical or typographical error. It is a
substantial change for which the applicable procedure is Rule 108 of
·
the Rules of Court.
To correct simply means "to make or set aright; to remove the
faults or error from" while to change means "to replace something
with something else of the same kind or with something that serves
as a substitute." The birth certificate of petitioner contained no
error. All entries therein, including those corresponding to his first
name and sex, were all correct. No correction is necessary.

(b) No a foreign divorce decree between a foreign sp~use

by itself to cancel the entry in the civil registry pertallllllg to the

"The marriage of the Parties contracted on xxx
before the Civil Registrar of Dusseldorf is hereby dissolved. The parental custody of the children Diktor and
Daus is granted to the father."
Drylvik filed a motion to dismiss in the RTC of Manila on
the ground that the court no longer had jurisdiction over the
matter as a decree of divorce had already been promulgated
dissolving his marriage to Dara. Dara objected, saying t1'.a t
while she was not challenging the divorce decree, th e .-..'..:- .: :...--:.
the RTC still had to proceed for the purpose of dete rrn .

constituting res judicata.
(a)

Should Drylvik's motion to dismiss be granted?

(b) Is a foreign divorce decree between a foreign
spouse and a Filipino spouse, uncontested by both parties,
sufficient by itself to cancel the entry in the civil registry
pertaining to the spouses' marriage?
SUGGESTED ANSWER:
(a)

No, Drylvik's motion to dismiss should not be granted.

In the ·ca~ of Roehr vs. Rodriguez, the Supreme Court held
that as a ge~e!!1 rule, divorce decrees obtained by foreigners in
other countnes are rec~gnizable in our jurisdiction, but the legal
effects thereof, e.g., on custody, care and support of the children,
must still be determined by our courts. Before our courts can give
the effect of res judicata to a foreign judgment, such as the awarJl of

spouses' marriage.
In the case of Fujiki v. Marinay, the Supreme Court held that
the effect of a foreign' judgment is not automatic. To extend the effect
of a foreign judgment in the Philippines, Philippine cour_ts mu~t
determine if the foreign judgment is consistent with domestic public
policy and other mandatory laws (G.R. No. 196049, June 26, 2013).

· Rule 108 - ConcelJation or Correction of Entries in the Civil Registry

4,05 BAR Q. (2005]
gule 108 as a Remedy

Helen is the daughte r of Eliza, a Filipina, and Tony, a
Chinese, who is married to another woman living in China.
f{er birth certificate indicate s that Helen is the legitima te
child of Tony and Eliza and that_she is a Chinese citizen.
Helen wants her birth certifica te corrected by changin g·
her filiation from "legitimate" andl her citizensh ip from
,iChinese" to "Filipino" because her parents were not
married.
What petition should Helen file and wpat procedural
requirem ents must be observed? Explain.
SUGGESTED ANSWER :
The proper r~medial step that Helen may avail of is to file a
petition for correction of entry in the record of birth by changing her
filiation from ''legitima te" to "illegitim ate" and her citizensh ip from
"Chinese" to "Filipino. " It clearly appeared that her parents were not
married. The petition is adversar ial in characte r as provided under
Rule 108 of the Rules of Court. The change cannot be considered as
summary correction .

'

The procedur al requirem ents that must be observed are the
following: (i) verified petition; (ii) names of all persons who have
claim of any interest which would be aft'ected; (iii) issuance of an
order fixing the time and place of hearing; (iv) reasonab le notice
to the parties named in the petition; (v) publication of the order
once a week for three consecutive weeks in a newspap er of general
circulation. (Rule 108 of the Rules of Court)

There was a full-blo wn trial where Agcaoi li present ed

The content ion is incorrec t since the proceeding under Rule

108 of the Rules of Court may either be summa ry or adversa ry in
charact er. It is summa ry when the correcti on sought to be made
is mere clerical · but where the rectifica tion affects civil status,
citizens hip or nationa lity of a _party, it is deemed to be substan tial
and the procedu re to be adopted is adversa ry. It appears that the
procedu re provide d under the Rules are followed. Conseql:•,mt
the -court correctl y ordered the Local Civil Registr ar to make the
correcti ons.
4.07 EXPLAIN AND ILLUSTRATE THE CONCEPT OF "SUBSTAN-

. TIAL ERRORS."

Substan tial errors in the petition for correcti on of entry of
name is illustra ted in the case of Ramon Corpuz Tan v. Office of
the Local Civ~l Registra r of the City of Manila and the Nationa l
Statistic s Office of Quezon City.
Here; th.,_e_ Suprem e Court ruled that the error s?ught to be
correcte d is .not merely a clerical error but a substan tial one. The
alleged mistak'?e is not only a misspel led surnam e but involves a
deletion of a word which entails a change in the surnam e. Further ,
the correction of petition er-appe llant's surnam e from "Tan Ko" to
"Tan" would, in effect, be an adjudica tion that indeed his father's first
name is ''Ko" and his surnam e is "Tan." Hence, the said correction
would entail not only a substan tial change in the surnam e of the

entries in the civil registry may be ·filed in the Regional Trial Court

Aside from the certificate of marriage, no such evidence was
presented to show the existence of marriage. Rather, respondent
showed by overwhelming evidence that no marriage was entered
into and that she was not even aware of such existence. The •
testimonial and documentary evidence clefirlY established that the
only "evidence" of marriage which is the marriage certificate was a
forgery .

With the testimo~e s and other evidence presented , the trial
com:t found that ~he signature appearing in the subject marriage
~ertifica,te was different from responden t's signature appearin

thus ma~e a cate~orica l conclusion that responden t's signature in

. _ Indeed, the Court made a pronounce ment in the n·,
of Minoru Fujiki v. Maria Paz Galela Marinay, Shinichi 'L aelwra,
Local Civil Registrar of Quezon City, and the Administr ator and
· Civil Registrar General of the National Statistics Office that:
. To be sure, a petition for correction or cancellation of an entry
in the civil registry cannot substitute for an action to invalidate a
marriage. A direct action is necessary to prevent circumven tion of the
substantiv e and procedura l safeguard s of marriage under the Family
Code, AM. No. 02-11-10-SC and other related laws. Among these
.safeguard s are the requireme nt of proving the limited grounds for
the dissolutio_n of marriage, support pendente lite of the spouses and
children, the' fiquidatio n, partition and distributio n of the properties
of the ~pousts_ a_n d the investigat ion of the public prosecutor to
determme collus10n. 1). direct action for declaratio n of nullity or
annulmen t of marriage is also necessary to prevent circumvention
of the jurisdictio n of the Family Courts under the Family Courts Act
of 1997 (R.A. No. 8369), as a petition for cancellatio n or correction of

493

While the Court maintain that Rule 108 cannot be
availed of to determin e the validity of marriage , the Court
cannot nullify the proceedin gs before the trial court where
all the part'ies had been given the opportun ity to contest the
allegation s of respondent; the procedur es were followed, and
all the evidence of the parties had already been admitted and
examined. Responde nt indeed sought, not the nullification
of marriage as there was no marriage to speak of, but the
correction of the record of such marriage to reflect the truth
as set forth by the evidence. Otherwis e stated, in allowing the
correction of the subject certificat e of marriage by cancellin g
the wife portion thereof, the trial court Jid not, in any way,
declar;e the marriage void as there was no marriage to speak
of.

1.02 WHAT IS THE NATURI; OF APPEAL?

The right to appeal is a mere statutory privilege, and should
be exercised only in the manner prescribed by law. The statutory
nature of the right to appeal requires the one who avails himself of
it to strictly comply with the statutes or rules that are considered
indispensable interdictions against needless delays and fr,r .i:tn
-··orderly discharge of judicial business.

hi the absence of highly exceptional circumstances warrantmg
their relaxation, like when the loftier demands of substantial justice
and equity require the relaxation, or when there are other special
and meritorious circumstances and issues, such statutes or rules
should remain inviolable.
1.03 WHAT ARE THE AVAILABLE MODES OF APPEAL IN CON•
FORMITY WITH SECTION 2 OF RULE 72?

Rules 40, 41, 42, and 45 apply in conformity with Section 2 of ·
Rule 72, Section 2 (applicability ofrules of actions). If it is an ordinary
appeal under Rule__40 or 41, and the special proceedings are subject
to multiple appe~ , like settlement of estates, the appeal period is
30 days, a notice ofappeal_and record on appeal being required.
The rationale behind allowing more than one appeal in the
same case is to enable the rest of the case to proceed in the event that
a separate and distinct issue is resolved by the court and held to be

v. VILMA S. MIRASOL
G.R. No. 164255, September 7, 2011

I

DOCTRINE: The perfection of an appeal within the period
laid down by law is mandatory and jurisdictional, because
the failure to perfect the appeal within the time prescribed
by the Rules of Court causes the judgment or final order
to become . final as to preclude the appellate court from
acquiring the jurisdiction to review the judgment or final
order. The failure of the petitioners and their counsel to file
, their record on appeal on time. ·rendered the orders of the
RTC final and unappealable. Thereby, the appellate court
lost the jurisdiction to review the challenged orders, and the
petitioners were precluded from assailing the orders.

FACTS:
In January 1985, the petitioners relayed their offer to the
administrator of the Estate of L.J. Hodges to purchase
for P22,560.00 Lot 18, Block 7 of 971 (Lot 18), ·an asset of
the estate situated on D.B. Ledesma Interior, Jaro, Iloilo
City. They made a deposit of P4,512.00, the equivalent of
20% of the offer. On August 1, 1985, th~ administrator
sought judicial approval of the offer, stating that petitioner ·
Erlinda Lebin was the actual occupant of Lot 18. The R.TC
commissioned one Atty. Tabares to conduct an ocular
inspection of Lot 18 to ascertain if Erlinda Le bin was really
the occupant. In his report, Atty. Tabares confirmed that
Erlinda Le bin was the only occupant of Lot 18. Accordingly,
on August 28, 1985, the RTC granted the administrator's
motion for approval of the offer.

Case No. M-1678, filed its Comment/Opposition to t~
aforequoted Motion on 2 October 2002. LCN countere:
tha~ ~he _R~C had already resolved the issue of payment

Payment fil~d ~y Atty. Syquia and Atty. Quasha for failure
of the adDllmstrators to submit an accounting oJ' : ~ J

LCN also averred that the administrators and the : __,rs
of the ~ate Raymond Triviere had earlier agreed to fix the
formers fees at o~y 5% of.the gross estate, based on which,
per the computation of LCN, the administrate ;; were even
overpaid P55,000.00.
~CN further asserted that contrary to what was stated
m the s~con'd Motion for Payment, Section 7, Rule 85 of
the ~~Vised Rules of Court was inapplicable, since the
adnurus~ra~rs failed to establish that the estate was large,
or that _it~ settl~ment was attended with great difficulty,
or r~q~ured..:a high degree of capacity on the part of the
a~Dllrustrator_s. Finally, LCN argued that its claims are
st
ill out sta ndi ng a nd chargeable against the estate of the
late Raymo~d Triviere; thus, no distribution should be
allowed until they have been paid.

CHAP'I'ER 16
Rule 109 - Appeals in SpeciaJ Proceedrngs

505

JSSUE: Whether or not the Court of Appeals erred in ruling

that the award in• favor of the heirs of the late Raymond
Triviere is already a distribution of the residue of the estate.

SUPREME COURT'S RULING: No. While the awards in favor
f petitioner children and widow made in the RTC Order dated 12
~une 2003 was not yet a distribution of the residue of the estate,
given that there was still_a pending claim ~ga~nst_the estate, still,
they did constitute a partial and advance distnbut10n of the estate.
Virtually, the petitioner children and wido~ were already being
awarded shares in the estate, although not all of its obligations had
been paid or provided for.
Section 2, Rule 109 of the Revised Rules of Court expressly
recognizes advance distribution of the estate, to wit:
Section 2. Advance distribution in special proceedings. Notwithstanding Ji pending controversy or appeal in proceedings to settle the estate of a decedent, the court may, in its
discretion and upon such terms as it may deem proper
and just, l)ermit that such part of the estate as may not be affected by the controversy or appeal be distnlmted among the
heirs or legatees, upon compliance with the conditions set
forth in Rule 90 of these rules. (Emphases ~upplied.)
The second paragraph of Section 1 of Rule 90 of the Revised
Rules of Court allows the distribution of tile estate prior to the
payment of the obligations mentioned therein, provided that "the .
distributees, or any of them, gives a bond, in a sum to be fixed by the
court, conditioned for the payment of said obligations within such
time as the court directs."
In sum, although it is within the discretion of the RTC whether
or not to permit the advance distribution of the estate, its exercise
of such discretion should be qualified by the following: (1) only part
of the estate that is not affected by any pending controversy or
appeal may be the subject of advance. distribution (Section 2, Rule
109); and (2) the distributees must post a bond, fixed by the court,
conditioned for the payment of outstanding obligations of the estate
(second paragraph of Section 1, Rule 90). There is no showing that
the RTC, in awarding to the petitioner children and widow their
shares in the estate prior to the settlement of all its obligations,
complied with these two requirements or, at the very least, took the
same into consideration. Its Order of 12 June 2003 is completely

,I,

1.00 WHAT IS R.A. No. 9048 KNOWN AS THE CLERICAL ERROR
ACT?

R.A. No. 9048 now governs the change .of first name.
It vests the power and authority to entertain petitions for
change of first name to the city or municipa l civil registrar
or consul general concerne d.
Under the law, therefore , jurisdicti on over applicatio ns
for change of first name is now primarily lodged with the
aforemen tioned administr ative officers. The intent and
effect of the law is to exclude the change of first name
from the coverage of Rules 103 (Change of Name) and 108
(Cancella tion or Correctio n of Entries in the Civil Registry)
of the Rules of Court, until ancl unless >an administr ative
petition for change of name is first filed and subseque ntly
denied. It likewise lays down the corr~spon ding venue, form
and procedur e. In sum, the remedy and the proceedin gs
regulatin g change of first name are primarily administr ative
in nature, not judicial. The Rule provides:
"SECTION 1. Authority to Correct CleriGal or
Typograph ical Error and Change of First Name or
Nickname. - No entry in a ciuil register shall be changed
or corrected without a judicial order, except for clerical
or typographi cal errors and change of first> name or

changes in the civil registry in appropriate adversarial proceedings.
(Republic v. Benemetrio, G.R. No. 146963, March 15, 2004)

R.A. No. 9048 which was enacted in .2001 bas effectively
changed the nature of proceeding under Rule 108. Under this new
law, "clerical or typographical errors and change of first name or
nickname" may not be corrected or changed by the concerned city or
municipal registrar or consul general, without need of any judicial
, order. The obvious effect is to remove from the ambit of Rule 108 the
correction or cha.nging of such errors in entries of the civil register.
Hence, what is left for the scope of operation of Rule 108 are substantial changes and corrections in entries of the civil register. (Lee
v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 118387, October 11, 2001)

3.03 DOES R.A. NO. 9048 APPLY TO CHANGE IN NATIONALITY?
No, Section 2(3) of R.A. No. 9048 provides that a summary
administrative proceeding to correct, ·clerical pr typographical
errors in a birth certificate cannot apply to a change in nationality.
Substantial corrections to the nationality or citizenship of person
recorded i~ the civil registry should, therefore, be effected through
a petition filed in court under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court. ·

person where it 1.8 p_atently clear that there waa a clerical or
typographical error or mistake in the entry. (R.A. No. 10172)

1.02 DEFINE "CLERICAL OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR."

"Clerical or Typographical Error" refers to a mistake
committed in the performance of clerical work in writing. copying,
transcribing or typing an entry in the civil register that is harmless
and innocuous, such as misspelled name or misspelled place of birth,
mistake in the entry of day and month in the cfate of birth or the sex
of the person or the like, which is visible to the eyes or obvious to the
understanding, and can be corrected or changed only by reference to
other existing record or records.

CANNOT BE CHANGED? (SEC. 2(3], R.A. NO.10172)?
l.

Nationality;

2.

Age; or
Status of the petitioner.

3.

1.04 EXPLAIN THE TERM "VISIBLE TO THE EYES OR OBVIOUS
TO THE UNDERSTANDING ." AS A CLERICAL OR TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR UNDER R.A. NO. 10172.

By qualifying the definition of a clerical, typographical error
as a mistake "visible to the eyes or obvious to the understanding,"
the law recognizes that there is a .factual determination made after
reference to and evaluation of existing documents presented.
Thus, corrections may be made even though the err.or is not
typographical if it is "obvious to the understanding," even if t here is
no proof that the name or circumstance in the birth certificate was
ever used.
1.05 WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CORRECTION OF
CLERICAL OR TYPOGRAPHICA L ERROR? (SEC. 5, R.A. No.

1 07 WHEN IS THE REQUIREMENT UNDER SECTION 5 WHICH
MANDATES THAT THE MEDICAL CERTIFICATE MUST SPE.
CIFICALLY CERTIFY THAT RESPO~DENT "HAS NOT UNDERGONE SEX CHANGE OR SEX TRANSPLANT' NEED NOT
BE COMPLIED WITH?

In the case of Republic v. Miller Omandam Unabia, G .R. ~o.
213346, February 11, 2019, the requirement found under Sec1:1on
5 of R.A. No. •9048, as amended, which mandates that the me~cal
certificate submitted must specifically certify that respondent ~as
not undergone sex change or sex transplant'' need _not to be co~~lied
with when there is a medical certification attestrn.g that petitioner
is ~'phenotypically male."
The Supreme Court rule:
As for petitioner's argument that tl\e medical certificate
failed to specifically certify that respondent "has not under~one
sex change or sex transplant" as required by law, suffice it to
st~te that this is no longer required w1th the certification by Dr.
Labis that respondent is "phenotypically male," meaning that
respondent's entire physical, physiological, and biochemical
makeup - as determined both genetically and environmentally
- is male, which thus presupposes that he did °:ot undergo
sex reassignment. In other words, as determined genetically
and environmentally, from conception to birth, respondent's
entire being, from the physical, to the physiological, · to the
biochemical - meaning that all the chemical processes and
substances occurring within respondent - ,_ was undoubtedly '
male. He was conceived _and born male, ·he·\, ,ks male, and he
functions biologically as a male.

Thus, in respondent's case, the Court must do away with the
requirement of no-sex change certification.

,rhe Supreme Court did not agree with the CA that the
of the
5 ubJect birth certificates are the express recognition
children's ~liation by Tinitigan, because they were not d·uly
registered m accordance with the law. It is mandatory that
the mother of an illegitimate child signs the birth certificate
of her child in all cases, irrespective of whether the father
recognizes the child as his or not. The only legally known
parent of an illegitimate child, by the. fact of illegitimacy, is
the mother of the child who conclusively carries the blood of
the mother. Since it appears on the face of the subject birth
certificates that the mother did not sign the documen~ the
local civil registrar had no authority to register the subject
birth certificates. Clearly, the subject birth certificates
were not executed consistent with the provisions of the law
respecting the registration of birth of i11egitimate children.
*AUTHOR'S NOTE: The related provision of Section S (Registration
and Certification of Birth) under Act No. 3753 (The Law on Registry
of Civil Status) expressly provides that, in case of an illegitimate
child, the birth certificate shall be signed jointly by the parents of the
infant or only the mother if the father refuses.

[BAR A.SJ Ms. A filed a petition for a writ of ampa~, c~ng
that she was being threatened by Mr. B, her ex-boyfi:iend, with
whom she has a child out of wedlock, named C. Ms. A alleged that
since she started dating someone else, Mr. B began stalking her,
parking his car on the street outside her house, and watching her
house until the wee hours of the morning. She thus feared for her
life.
(a)

Is Ms. A entitled to a writ of amparo?

SUGGESTED ANSWER:
No, Ms. A is not entitled to a writ of amparo.
Under the Rule on the Writ of Amparo (i'\..M. No. 0~-9-12-SC), a writ
of amparo is a remedy when there is a violation or threatened violation of
a person's right to life, liberty and security more particularly in ertralegal
killings and enforced disappearance and where government involvement is
indispensable.
In this case, there was no incident of ertralegal killings or enforced
disappearance but only the mere act of stalking by Mr. B against Ms. A.
There was also no government involvement' present in this case since Mr. B
is a private person.
Hence, the remedy of amparo may not be availed 0£

(b) Assuming that Mr. B took away C withou,t Ms. A's
knowledge and consent, what is the proper remedy for Ms. A to
immediately recover C's custody? Explain.

SUGGESTED ANSWER:
The proper remedy is to file a petition for habeas corpus to immediately
recover C's custody as provided under The Rule on Custody of Minors and
Writ of Habeas Corpus in Relation to Custody of Minors (A.M. No. 03-04-04SC).

(A Foresight to the Bar Exam and the Practice of Law)

Ms. A has the right of custody over the minor child which is being
withheld by Mr. B. All she has to prove is that it serves the best interest of
the minor child to be in her custody rather than with Mr. B.
[BARA.9) Ms. Ninitiated a special proceeding for the correction

of entries in the civilregistry under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court

before the Regional Trial Court (RTC), impleading only the Local
Civil Registrar therein. In her petition, Ms. N sought to change the
entry in her birth certificate with respect to the date of her parents'

marriage from "May 22, 1992" to "not married". The Office of the
Solicitor General opposed the petition, arguing that Ms. N's parents
should have been impleaded in the proceeding. In response, Ms.
N argued that this was not
necessary since it was an entry in her
own birth certificate which was intended to
change. Hence, it was a
matter personal to her, and as such, the
of her parents
participation
in the case could be dispensed with.
Is Ms. N's position correct?

Explain.

SUGGESTED ANSWER:
Ms. N's position is not correct. Rule 108

applies not only to

rectifications but also to substantial ones where the procedure to besummary
followed
is adversary. It is adversarial where the alteration
includes those on

citizenship, legitimacy of paternity and filiation or legitimacy of marriage.
In such a case, strict
compliance under Rule 108 must be observed where all
parties who may be interested or affected by the entries must be notified or
represented.

In the case at bar, changing the date of
marriage from "May 22, 1009"
to "not married" involves substantial rectification as it
will affect the status
of Ms. N as the legitimate child of her
