PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
I was introduced to Local Government in 1976 when I was
a freshman at the U.P. College of Law. Teaching the subject was
Professor Pacifico A. Agabin who gave us a frightening long list of
cases to be studied.
In 1979, together with my classmate Jesus P. Casila, we
prepared a Handbook on Local Governments, which contained
provisions of law, notes, and cases on Local Governments. This
Handbook was printed and published on the same year and had sold
about 2,000 copies.
I was a fourth year law student in January, 1980 when elections
for local officials were announced. Having been drafted to run for
board member of Misamis Oriental, I requested my professors at
U.P. to excuse my absences from January 5, 1980, the start of the
campaign up to January 30, 1980, the date of the elections. Luckily,
they agreed. And I was off for the campaign.
The results of the local elections came as a surprise as I topped
the winners in the provincial board. On February 1, 1980, I was back
at the U.P. CollegeofLawtofinish my last semester. In March, 1980,
I came home to Misamis Oriental, was inducted, and began to serve
my six-year term of office. I was reintroduced to Local Governments,
this time, not only in theory but also in actual practice.
The laws on Local Governments were so numerous, separate
and confusing, that early this year, the Batasang Pambansa enacted
the Local Government Code as mandated by the 1973 Constitution.
This book is written in order to guide not only the local
government officials in provinces, cities, municipalities and
barangays, as well as students taking up courses on local
governments and practicing lawyers, but also the ordinary citizens
who may find this book of help in the protection of their rights and
enhancement of their welfare.
In the preparation of this book, I am specially thankful to
Assemblyman and Minister of State for Local Governments, Antonio
V

R. Topaz, who gave me his personal copy of the Code the very day
it came out of the Batasan Press, and who encouraged me to write
a book on it.
I also wish to thank Ambassador Eduardo M. Conjuangco,
Jr., who assisted me in the production of this book; and also, to
UCPB Vice President Narciso "Chit" Pineda who helped me in the
preparation of this book.
I would also like to thank Assemblyman Concordio C. Diel,
Governor Fernando B. Pacana, Jr., Kagawads Constantino G.
Jaraula, Vicente L. dela Lara, Jr., Alfredo Q. Tan, Narcisa E. Pelaez,
Teddy S. Cabeltes, Jovencio R. Roa, and Ana Lucie S. Kho of Misamis
Oriental, who assisted and encouraged me to write this book.
Also, I wish to express my gratitude to Regional Director Juliano
Z. Barcinas, Assistant Regional Director Romulo G. Ventenilla, and
Atty. Rene K. Burdeos of the Ministry of Local Governments, Region
X who had supplied me with the relevant laws and decrees on local
governments. In the preparation ofthis book, I am also very thankful
for the support given by my co-author Atty. Jesus P. Casila, Atty.
Proculo Sarmen, Atty. Mario Hisular, Atty. Edwin Catacutan, and
Atty. Godofredo de Guzman.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
The copies of the First Edition having been sold out, the
publication of this edition becomes necessary because of its continued
demand.
It is hoped that this book will continue to guide not only our
local government officials as well as law students taking up local
governments or public corporations and practicing lawyers, but also
our enlightened citizenry.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION
On October 10, 1991, Republic Act No. 7160 otherwise known
as the "Local Government Code of 1991" was signed into law and
became effective on January 1, 1992.
This new law repealed B.P. Blg. 337, otherwise known as the
"Local Government Code" and other previous statutes, executive
orders, presidential decrees, and issuances dealing on local
governments.
R.A. 7160hopes to usher in a new era ofgenuine and meaningful
local autonomy to enable territorial and political subdivisions of the
State to attain their fullest development as self-reliant communities
and make them more effective partners in the attainment of national
goals.
This book aims to serve law professors and law students as a
textbook on the course Local Governments or Public Corporations
by presenting the legal provisions of the Code itself followed by brief
comments by the author and then digests of leading Supreme Court
cases on the subject.
This will likewise be a handy reference material to all elective
and appointive local officials and employees to guide them in their
actions.

PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION
In view of the numerous cases decided and promulgated by the
Supreme Court after the effectivity of the Local Government Code of
1991,I decided to come up with a fourth edition of this book.
For a better appreciation, the significant portions ofthe Court's
pronouncements in the cases of Aguinaldo v. Santos (212 SCRA 768)
on removal, Flores v. Drilon (223 SCRA 568) on the appointment
of elective officials to another public office, Bunye v. Escareal (226
SCRA 332) on preventive suspension, Garcia • COMELEC (227
SCRA 100) on recall, Galarosa v. Valencia (227 SCRA 728) on
the hold-over doctrine and Magtajas v. Pryce (234 SCRA 255) on
gambling, have been extensively included.
To Grace, Luz, and Nonoy, my gratitude.

PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION
The Fifth Edition of this book was published way back in 2002.

INTRODUCTION
The strength of free nations resides in the local community.
Local institutions are to liberty, what primary schools are to science;
they bring it within people's reach, they teach people to use and
enjoy it. Without local institutions, a nation may establish a free
government, but it cannot have the spirit of liberty. Transient
passions, momentary interests, a chance of circumstances, may
create the external forms of independence; but the despotic tendency
which has been repressed into the interior of the social body will,
sooner or later, appear on the surface.
Alexis de Tocqueville,
Democracy in America
Before going into a full discussion on the Local Government
Code of 1991, it is essential that basic definitions and fundamental
principles on the subject be reviewed.
1.

Political law, defined

Political law is that branch of public law which deals with the
organization and operation of the government organs of the state
and defines the relations of the state with the inhabitants of its
territory. (People v. Perfecto, 43 Phil. 887.)
2.

Polltlcal law, its subdivisions
Political law embraces:

3.

(a)

Constitutional law;

(b)

Administrative law;

(c)

Law of Public Officers; and

(d)

Law of Public Corporations.

Corporation, defined

A corporation is an artificial being created by operation of
law, having the right of succession and the powers, attributes and

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Introduction

properties expressly authorized by law or incident to its existence.

Held: We are of the opinion that it is the duty of the chief
of the division when articles are presented for registration to
determine whether the objects of the corporation as expressed
in the articles are lawful. We do not believe that simply because
the articles of incorporation are perfect in form, he must accept
and register a corporation which was organized for some
unlawful or immoral purposes.

(Sec. 2, Revised Corporation Code.)
4.

Classes of Corporations

Corporations are classified into public and private. Some
authorities include quasi-public corporations in the classification.
5.

Public Corporation, defined

The purpose as stated in the articles of incorporation is
"that the object of the corporation is: a) to organize and regulate
the management, disposition, administration and control
which the barrio Pulo or San Miguel or its inhabitants have
over the common property of said inhabitants belonging to the
whole barrio as such; and b) to use the natural products of said
property for the advantage of the barrio." The purpose as it
appears is to make the barrio a corporation which will become
the owner of and have the right of control and administer any
property belonging to the municipality of Pasig found within
the limits of the barrio. This is unlawful being contrary to the
provisions of the Municipal Code which gives the municipality
jurisdiction over the barrios within their respective territories.

A public corporation is one created by the state either by general
or special act for purposes of administration of local government or
rendering service in the public interest. It is one formed or organized
for the government of portion of a state (Sec. 3, Act No. 1459); it is
created by the state as its own agency for the accomplishment of
parts of its own public works. (Elliot, Mun. Corp., p. 1.)
6.

Private Corporation, classes

Corporations formed or organized under the
Corporation Code may be stock or nonstock corporations.
7.

Revised

Public and Private Corporations, distinguished

Public corporations are established for purposes connected
with the administration of civil or local governments; while private
corporations are created for private aim, gain, or benefits of its
members. Public corporations are creations of the state either by
general or special act; while private corporations are created by the
will of the incorporators with the recognizance of the state.

Judgment AFFIRMED.
8.

(a) Quasi-public corporations, which are created as
agencies of the state for narrow and limited purposes without
the powers and liabilities of self-governing corporations. They
render public service or supply public wants.

Public corporations are involuntary consequences of legislation;
while private corporations constitute voluntary agreements by and
among its stockholders or members.
A.

Decided Case

1.
The Articles of Incorporation seeking to incorporate a
barrio is unlawful for being violative of the Municipal Code.
ASUNCION v. YRIARTE
28 Phil. 67, September 24, 1914, Moreland, J.
Facts: This is an action to obtain a writ of mandamus
to compel the chief of the division of archives of the Executive
Bureau to file certain articles of incorporation. Lower court
found in favor of defendant.

Public Corporations, classes
They are:

(b)
9.

Municipal corporations.

Municipal Corporation, defined

A municipal corporation is a "body politic and corporate
constituted by the incorporation of the inhabitants for purposes
of local government thereof; it is established by law partly as an
agency of the state to assist in the civil government of the country,
but chiefly to regulate and administer the local or internal affairs of
the city, town or district which is incorporated." (Dillon, Mun. Corp.,

Vol. 2, pp. 58-59.)
The term municipal corporation has gradually given way to
the more recent term, local government, which has a substantially

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

identical definition as that of the former. Municipal corporations
and local governments are therefore one and the same entity.
10.

Municipal Corporation, elements
a)

A legal creation or incorporation;

b)
A corporate name by which the artificial personality or
legal entity is known and in which all corporate acts are done;
c)
Inhabitants constituting the population who are invested
with the political and corporate power which are executed through
duly constituted officers and agents;
d)
A place or territory within which the Local Civil
Government and corporate functions are exercised. (Laurel, Cases
on Mun. Corp., p. 29, citing MQuillin, Mun. Corp., Vol. I, pp. 289290.)
11.

Local Government, defined

The term Local Government refers to a "political subdivision
of a nation or state which is constituted by law and has substantial
control oflocal affairs." ( UP Law Center Constitution Revision Project,
Part II, p. 712, citing Sady, Improvement of Local Government and
Administration for Development Purpose.)
12.

Local Government, its dual personality

Local government has a dual personality, namely: 1) public or
governmental; and 2) private or corporate.
In its public or governmental capacity, it is an agent of the
state for the government of the territory and the inhabitants within
the local government limits. In its private capacity, it acts in a
similar category as a business corporation, performing functions not
strictly governmental or political. In its governmental character, it
exercises by delegation a part of the sovereignty of the state.
Examples of the first class are: a) establishment and operation
of schools; b) adoption of regulations against fire and diseases; and
c) preservation of the public peace, etc.
Examples of the latter class are: a) establishment of markets
and slaughter houses; b) operation of telephone system; and c)
operation of ferry service, etc.

Introduction

Municipal corporations perform twin functions. Firstly, they
serve as an instrumentality of the State in carrying out the functions
of government. Secondly, they act as an agency of the community in
the administration of local affairs. It is in the latter character that
they are a separate entity acting for their own purposes and not a
subdivision of the State. (Surigao Electric Co., Inc. v. Municipality
of Surigao, 24 SCRA 898.)
13.

Local Government, as an agency of the State

A.

Decided Cases

1.
A municipal corporation (local government) is merely an
agency instituted by the State for the purpose of carrying out in
detail the objects of government. It is essentially a revocable agency.
It has no vested powers or franchises. It is subject to the control of
the legislative. (Coyle vu. Gray, 30 Atlantic 728.)
COYLE v. GRAY
30 Atlantic 728
Facts: An act was passed by the legislature establishing
a board of water commissioners for the city of Wilmington,
Delaware, taking the control of the waterworks of a municipal
corporation from the mayor and placing it under that of the
special board. Its constitutionality was questioned. Petitioners
contend that the waterworks is a private property of the public
corporation and guaranteed by the due process of law clause;
and this protection exempts it from regulation and control of
the State.
Held: The Act of the Legislature is constitutional. A
municipal corporation being merely an agency of the State, the
legislature may change its internal government at pleasure. A
municipal corporation does not hold property, like waterworks,
as a private corporation, so as to prevent the legislature
from modifying the management thereof at will. There is no
diversion of the property from its original use.
2.
The new City of Manila is liable to its creditors for
obligations incurred by the old City of Manila. The mere change of
the sovereign authority does not necessarily dissolve the municipal
corporation under the former sovereign.

6

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Introduction

VILAS v. CITY OF MANILA
42 Phil. 935, April 3, 1911, Larton, J.

Held: The question in this case is whether the lot occupied
by the court-house of the Municipality of Catbalogan, Samar
belongs to the said municipality or is a state land under the
control of the Insular Government.

Facts: Before the cession of the Philippines to the United
States by the Treaty of Paris, Vilas was creditor of the City of
Manila. When the City of Manila was incorporated under Act
No. 183 of the Philippine Commission, he brought an action
against the City of Manila to recover the sum due to him. As
a matter of defense, it was claimed that the old city of Manila
which incurred the indebtedness had been dissolved by the
change of sovereignty and that by the incorporation of the new
city under Act No. 183, the liability of the old city has already
been extinguished.
Held: The juristic identity of the corporation has in no
wise been affected, and in law, the present city is in every
legal sense the successor of the old. As such it is entitled to the
property and property rights of the predecessor corporation, and
is in law subject to all of its liabilities. The mere change of the
sovereign authority governing a country does not necessarily
dissolve the municipal corporation organized under the former
sovereign. The argument that by the change of sovereignty the
old city was extinguished in the same manner as the agent dies
upon the death of the principal, loses sight of the dual character
of municipal corporations, corporate and governmental. Only
such governmental functions as are incompatible with the
present sovereignty may be considered suspended. The juristic
identity of the corporation is not affected by the change of
sovereignty. The City of Manila stands liable to its creditors.
3.
A municipality, the pueblo of Catbalogan, as a juridical
person, may acquire patrimonial property under its own independent
personality and not as a mere agent of the Central Government.

MUNICIPALITY OF CATBALOGAN v.
DIRECTOR OF LANDS
17 PHil. 216, October 17, 1910, Torres, J.
Facts: The Municipal President of the pueblo of
Catbalogan applied with the Court of Land Registration
asking for the registration of a parcel of land which the courthouse occupies, with the said pueblo as absolute owner. The
Attorney-General opposed.

If a municipality, as a juridical person susceptible of
rights and duties, can acquire all kinds of property such as that
termed propios or patrimoniales, it undoubtedly merits the
designation of owner with respect to the property which may
have been awarded to it as its own. The exercise on the part
of the municipality of a right of ownership in land vested with
the character of common (propio) or patrimonial land is very
distinct from the administration proceedings or acts executed
by it, and from the contract made by the same, inasmuch as,
in the exercise of the right of ownership in the property of the
exclusive ownership of the municipality, this entity has an
independent personality of its own, and does not act as a mere
agent of the Central Government.
14.

Local Governments, powers and functions

A.

Sources of Power of Local Governments
1.
The 1987 Constitution; its provisions on local
governments;
2.

The Local Government Code of 1991; and

3.
All existing laws, acts, decrees, executive orders,
proclamations and administrative regulations not inconsistent
with the 1987 Constitution and the Local Government Code of
1991.

B.

Classification of Local Government Powers
1.

Express powers - those granted in express words.

2.
Implied powers - those necessary or fairly implied
in or incident to the powers expressly granted.
3.
Inherent powers
those essential to the declared
objects and purposes of the corporation not simply convenient
but indispensable such as:
a)

to have perpetual succession;

b)

to sue and be sued;

RABUCO v. VILLEGAS
55 SCRA 656, February 28, 1974, Teehankee, J.

c)
to purchase, hold, and sell property for the
benefit of the municipal corporation;
d)

to have a common seal;

e)

to enact ordinances and resolutions.

4.
Legislative and executive powers
make laws; b) ordinance to execute laws.

Facts: R.A. No. 3120 converted the Malate area, which
are reserved as communal property, into disposable or alienable
lands of the state to be placed under the administration
and disposal of the Land Tenure Administration (LTA), for
subdivisions into small lots not exceeding 120 meters per lot
for sale in installments to the tenants or bona fide occupants
thereof and expressly prohibited ejectment and demolition of
petitioner's homes under Sec. 2 of the Act.

a) ordinance to

5.
Governmental and municipal powers-a) administer
the powers of the state and promoting the public welfare within
it; b) those for the special benefit and advantage of the urban
community. Among the governmental powers are: the power
of eminent domain, of taxation, to promote public education.
Among the municipal powers are: erection of waterworks, gas
works, power electric plants, from which profits may derived
by the municipality.

Respondent city officials contended that the Act must
be stricken down as unconstitutional for depriving the City
of Manila of the lots in question, and providing for their sale
without payment of just compensation thus constituting
deprivation of property without due process oflaw.

Held: The lots in question are manifestly owned by
the city in its public and governmental capacity and not in
its private or proprietary capacity of which it could not be
deprived without due process and without just compensation.
The Act was intended to implement the social justice policy
of the Constitution and the government's program of land for
the landless. It is a manifestation of the legislature's right and
power to deal with the state property which includes those
held by municipal corporation in its public and governmental
capacity. Therefore, R.A. 3120 is constitutional.

6.
Mandatory and discretionary powers - a) those the
exercise of which can be required of municipal corporations;
b) those which it may perform or not, depending upon its
judgment and discretion.

C.

Execution of Municipal Powers

When the charter or statute specifically prescribes the manner
by which certain corporate acts are to be executed and points out
the agency or officers who are to execute them, no other method
of procedure may be used in the premises. But if the law is silent
on the matter of exercise, the corporate authorities are necessarily
clothed with discretion in determining the same. All the methods
of executing such acts, as may be reasonably inferred, are deemed
granted, provided that the action taken is neither arbitrary nor
capricious and must be in good faith. Unless restrained by law, a
municipal corporation has the discretion to select the means and
methods of exercising its powers, provided that the means thus
selected must be reasonable. In making the selection, the council
may proceed either by way of ordinance or resolution.

D.

Decided Case

1.
R.A. 3120 is constitutional and is a manifestation of the
legislature's right to deal with the state property which includes
those held by municipal corporations in its public or governmental
capacity.

Local Governments, rules regarding their properties

A.

Introduction
Art. 423 of the New Civil Code provides:
"The property of provinces, cities, and municipalities is
divided into property for public use and patrimonial property.
(343)"
Art. 424 of the same Code provides:
"Property for public use, in the provinces, cities, and
municipalities, consist of the provincial roads, city streets,
municipal streets, the squares, fountains, public waters,
promenades, and public works for public service paid for by
said provinces, cities or municipalities.

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

10

All other property possessed by any of them is patrimonial
and shall be governed by this Code, without prejudice to the
provisions of special laws. (344a)"

B.

Kinds of Properties of Local Government Units

Provinces, cities, municipalities, or barangays have two kinds
of properties, namely:
1.

property for public use; and

2.

patrimonial property.

Properties for public use consists of:
(1) Provincial, city, municipal, or barangay roads or
streets, squares, fountains, public waters, and promenades.
These are open for use by everybody; and
(2) Public works for public service paid for by said units.
Examples are provincial, city, municipal, or barangay buildings
or water systems. These may not be freely used by everybody.
All other properties are patrimonial properties of the units.

and incidental thereto, mortgage a 2,323.75 square meter lot
situated at the southeastern portion of the Agoo Plaza (Plaza
Lot) as collateral. Consequently, on November 21, 2005, Land
Bank extended a P4,000,000.00 loan in favor of the Municipality
(First Loan), the proceeds of which were used to construct ten
(10) kiosks st the northern and southern portions of the Imelda
Garden. After completion, these kiosks were rented out.
On March 7, 2006, the SB passed Resolution No. 58-2006,
approving the construction of a commercial center on the Plaza
Lot as part of phase II of the Redevelopment Plan. To finance
the project, Mayor Eriguel was again authorized to obtain a
loan from Land Bank, posting as well the same securities as
that of the First Loan. In consequence, Land Bank granted a
second loan in favor of the Municipality on October 20, 2006 in
the principal amount of P28,000,000.00 (Second Loan).
Unable to get any response, Eduardo Cacayuran,
invoking his right as a taxpayer, filed a Complaint against
the implicated officials and the Land Bank, assailing, among
others, the validity of the Subject Loans on the ground that
the Plaza Lot used as collateral thereof is property of public
dominion and therefore, beyond the commerce of man.

LAND BANK v. CACAYURAN
696 SCRA 861, April 17, 2013, Perlas-Bernabe, J.

Ruling: Records disclose that the said loans were executed
by the Municipality for the purpose of funding the conversion
of the Agoo Plaza into a commercial center pursuant to the
Redevelopment Plan. However, the conversion of the said
plaza is beyond the Municipality's jurisdiction considering the
property's nature as one for public use and thereby, forming
part of the public dominion. Accordingly, it cannot be the object
of appropriation either by the State or by private persons.
Nor can it be the subject of lease or any other contractual
undertaking. In Villanueva v. Castaneda, Jr., citing Espiritu v.
Municipal Council of Pozorrubio, G.R. No. L- 61311, September
21, 1987, the Court pronounced that:

Facts: From 2005 to 2006, the Municipality's Sangguniang
Bayan (SB) passed certain resolutions to implement a multiphased plan (Redevelopment Plan) to redevelop the Agoo
Public Plaza (Agoo Plaza) where the Imelda Garden and Jose
Rizal Monument were situated.

x x x Town plazas are properties of public dominion, to
be devoted to public use and to be made available to the public
in general. They are outside the commerce of man and cannot
be disposed of or even leased by the municipality to private
parties.

To finance phase 1 of the said plan, the SB initially
passed Resolution No. 68-2005 on April 19, 2005, authorizing
then Mayor Eufranio Eriguel to obtain a loan from Land Bank

In this relation, Article 1409(1) of the Civil Code provides
that a contract whose purpose is contrary to law, morals, good

Town plazas are properties of public dominion, to be

They are outside the commerce of man and cannot be disposed of
or even leased by the municipality to private parties. Given the
unlawful purpose behind the Subject Loans which is to fund the
commercialization of the Agoo Plaza pursuant to the Redevelopment
Plan, they are considered as ultra vires in the primary sense thus,
rendering them void and in effect, non-binding on the Municipality.

Introduction

customs, public order or public policy is considered void and as
such, creates no rights or obligations or any juridical relations.
Consequently, given the unlawful purpose behind the Subject
Loans which is to fund the commercialization of the Agoo Plaza
pursuant to the Redevelopment Plan, they are considered as
ultra vires in the primary sense thus, rendering them void and
in effect, non-binding on the Municipality.
At this juncture, it is equally observed that the land on
which the Agoo Plaza is situated cannot be converted into
patrimonial property - as the SB tried to when it passed
Municipal Ordinance No. 02-2007 - absent any express grant
by the national government. As public land used for public
use, the foregoing lot rightfully belongs to and is subject to the
administration and control of the Republic of the Philippines.
Hence, without the said grant, the Municipality has no right to
claim it as patrimonial property.
While the Subject Loans cannot bind the Municipality for
being ultra vires, the officers who authorized the passage of
the Subject Resolutions are personally liable. Case law states
that public officials can be held personally accountable for acts
claimed to have been performed in connection with official
duties where they have acted ultra vires, as in this case.
The petition is DENIED.

C.

Alienation of the Properties of Local Government Units

1.
Properties for public use cannot be alienated as such and
may not be acquired by prescription. (Mun. of Oas v. Roa, 7 Phil. 20.)
2.
Patrimonial properties may be alienated and acquired by
prescription. (Mun. of Oas v. Roa, supra.)

In City of Manila v. Garcia, 19 SCRA 413, squatters entered
a piece of land belonging to the City of Manila and later secured
permits or lease contracts from the city mayor. The land later on
was needed for the expansion of the elementary school adjacent to it.
The Supreme Court ruled that the squatters never became tenants
of the land. The property being a public one, the Manila mayor did
not have authority to give permits or execute leases, written or oral
with defendants. Said permits or lease contracts are void.
In Muyot v. De la Fuente, G.R. No. L-6534, 48 O.G. 4860, it
was held that the City of Manila could not lease a portion of a public

13

sidewalk on Plaza Sta. Cruz, being likewise beyond the commerce
of man.
In Espiritu v. Municipal Council of Pozzorubio, 102 Phil. 866,
the Supreme Court declared:
"There is absolutely no question that the town plaza
cannot be used for the construction of market stalls, specially
of residences, and that such structures constitute a nuisance
subject to abatement according to law. Town plazas are
properties of public dominion, to be devoted to public use and
to be made available to the public in general. They are outside
the commerce of man and cannot be disposed of or even leased
by the municipality to private parties."
In Villanueva v. Castaneda, Jr., 154 SCRA 142, the
pronouncements in the above cases were cited when the Supreme
Court ruled that the place occupied by the stalls forming a talipapa
of the vendors/petitioners is a public plaza and as such beyond the
commerce of man and cannot be the subject of lease or any other
contractual undertaking. The removal of the stalls was ordered.

D.

Properties Intended for Public Use or Service

In the case of Capitulo u. Aquino, 53 O.G. 5, 1477, the Supreme
Court ruled that under Article 424 NCC, it does not matter that
the property is not actually devoted for public use or for some
public services. If the property has been intended for such use or
service, and the city has not devoted it to other uses, or adopted any
measure which amounted to withdrawal thereof from public use or
service, the same remains property for public use. Where the lot was
donated to the City of Manila by Sulucan Development exclusively
for street purposes and plaintiffs Capitulo, et al., occupied said lot
and later secured lease contracts on said lot from the city mayor, the
said occupation and lease contract are illegal because, even if not yet
developed and opened for public use, it remains property for public
use not subject to appropriation.

PROVINCE OF ZAMBOANGA DEL NORTE v.
CITY OF ZAMBOANGA
22 SCRA 1334, March 28, 1968, Bengzon, J.P., J.

Even the capitol site, the hospital and leprosarium sites,
and the school sites will be considered patrimonial for
they are not for public use.

Facts: The municipality of Zamboanga used to be
the provincial capital of Zamboanga Province. In 1936,
Commonwealth Act 39 converted it into a city. Sec. 50 provided
that properties which the province shall abandon will be
acquired and paid by the City of Zamboanga at a price fixed
by the Auditor-General. The properties consisted of 50 lots and
some buildings. The city paid P47,000 of the P704,000.

They would fall under the phrase "public works
for public service" for it has been held that under the
ejusdem generis rule, such public works must be for free
and indiscriminate use by anyone, just like the preceding
enumerated properties in the first paragraph of Art. 424.

However, in 1961, R.A. 3039 amended Sec. 50 providing
for the acquisition of the properties "free of charge."
Province filed a suit and prayed for R.A. 3039 to be declared
unconstitutional for depriving plaintiff of property without due
process of law and just compensation. The CFI declared R.A.
3039 unconstitutional and held the 50 properties as private
properties of the province of Zamboanga.

Held: 1. On control by State of Properties of Local
Government Units.
The principle is:
a.
If the property is owned by the municipality
in its public and governmental capacity, the property is
public and Congress has absolute control over it.
b.
If the property is owned in its private or
proprietary capacity, then it is patrimonial and Congress
has no absolute control. The municipality cannot be
deprived of it without due process and payment of just
compensation.
2.

Which of Two Norms May Be Used in Classifying the

Properties
a.

Classification under the Civil Code

Articles 423 and 424, NCC classify property of
provinces, cities and municipalities into property for
public use and patrimonial property. Applying this norm,
all the 50 lots and buildings thereon, except the two lots
used as High School playgrounds, could be considered as
patrimonial properties of the former Zamboanga province.

(Cebu City v. NWSA, 107 Phil. 112.)
Unlike in the Civil Code classification regarding
State properties, properties for public service in the
municipalities are not classified as public.
b.
Classification under the Law of Municipal
Corporations
Applying the norm obtaining under the principles
constituting the law of Municipal Corporations, all those
of the 50 properties in question which are devoted to
public service are deemed public. Under this norm, to
be considered public it is enough that the property be
held and devoted for governmental purposes like local
administration, public education, public health, etc.
Following this classification, RA. 3039 which
provides that all properties of the former province of
Zamboanga and located within the City of Zamboanga
are hereby transferred, free of charge, in favor of the said
City of Zamboanga, is valid insofar as it affects the Jots
as capitol sites and its grounds, hospital and leprosarium
sites and the high school playground sites totaling 24 lots,
since they were held by the former Zamboanga province
in its governmental capacity and therefore subject to the
absolute control of Congress.
But R.A. 3039 cannot be applied to deprive
Zamboanga province of the value of the 26 remaining lots
which are patrimonial properties since they are not being
utilized for distinctly governmental purposes.

Breach of a contractual obligation between the City of
Manila and plaintiff, involving property wh.ich is patrimonial in
character entitles the latter to damages.

damages even if no penalty for such breach is prescribed in the
contract. (Boysaw v. Interphil Promotions, Inc., 148 SCRA 636,
1987.)
Under the doctrine of respondeat superior (Torio v.
Fontanilla, 85 SCRA 599, 1978.), petitioner City of Manila is
liable for the tortious act committed by its agents who failed to
verify and check the duration of the contract of lease.

CITY OF MANILA v. INTERMEDIATE
APPELLATE COURT
179 SCRA 428, November 15, 1989, Paras, J.
Facts: Vivencio Sto. Domingo, deceased husband of
plaintiff Irene Sto. Domingo was buried in a lot of the North
Cemetery, which lot was leased by the City of Manila to
Irene from 1971 to 2021. Irene paid the full rental thereof. In
January 1978, the cemetery authorities exhumed and removed
the remains of Vivencio from the lot which were then placed
in a bag and kept in the bodega of the cemetery. In November
1978 (All Souls Day), when Irene went to the cemetery, she
was shocked to learn that the remains of her husband were not
anymore in the lot, as the same had been rented out to another
lessee.
Held: The North Cemetery is a patrimonial property
of the City of Manila which was created by resolution of the
Municipal Board of August 27, 1903 and January 7, 1904. The
administration and government of the cemetery are under the
City of Health Officer. (Ibid., Sec. 3189) The order and police
of the cemetery (Ibid., Sec. 319), the opening of graves, niches,
or tombs, the exhuming of remains, and the purification of the
same (Ibid., Sec. 327) are under the charge and responsibility
of the superintendent of the cemetery.
The City of Manila furthermore prescribes the procedure
and guidelines for the use and dispositions of burial lots and
plots within the North Cemetery through Administrative Order
No. 5, s. 1975. With the acts of dominion, there is, therefore no
doubt that the North Cemetery is within the class of property
which the City of Manila owns in its proprietary or private
character.
Furthermore, there is no dispute that the burial lot was
leased in favor of the private respondents. Hence, obligation
arising from contracts have the force of law between the
contracting parties. Thus, a lease contract executed by the
lessor and lessee remains as the law between them. (Henson v.
Intermediate Appellate Court, 148 SCRA 11, 1987.) Therefore,
a breach of contractual provision entitles the other party to

17

E.

Other Classification Based on Mode of Acquisition

a.
Properties of local government units may also be
classified as:
1)
Those acquired by the units by their own funds in
their proprietary capacity. These may be disposed of by the
units as they please.

2)
Those acquired by the units in its governmental
capacity such as those acquired by succession or by donation
from the State or National Government or from funds received
from the State. These are held in trust by these units for the
State, for the benefit of its inhabitants. These cannot be sold by
the local government units.
A municipality cannot acquire a lot through prescription since
said lot has an owner and the owner can bring an action to recover
possession at any time because possession is one of the attributes
of ownership of the land. (Municipality [now city} of Legaspi v. A.L.
Ammen Transportation Co., Inc., 26 SCRA 218.)
In the absence of title deed to any land claimed by the City of
Manila as its own, showing that it is acquired with its private or
corporate funds, the presumption is that such land came from the
State upon the creation of the municipality. (Salas u. Jarencio, 45
SCRA 743.)
Regardless of the source or classification of land in the
possession of a municipality, excepting those acquired with its own
funds in its private or corporate capacity, such property is held in
trust for the State for the benefit of its inhabitants, whether it be for
governmental or proprietary purposes. (Ibid.)

to dispose of the same, for after all it owes its creation to it
as an agent for the performance of a part of its public work,
the municipality being but a subdivision or instrumentality
thereof for purposes of local administration. Accordingly,
the legal situation is the same as if the State itself holds the
property and puts it to a different use. (2 McQuilin, Municipal
Corporations, 3rd Ed. p. 197, citing Monagham vs. Armatage,
218 Minn. 27, 15 N. W.2241.)

SANGGUNIANG PANLALAWIGAN OF BATAAN v.
GARCIA, JR.

804 SCRA 629, October 5, 2016, Reyes, J.
Facts: On February 26, 1998, Republic Act (R.A.) No.
8562, authored by Congressman Enrique T. Garcia, Jr. was
approved converting the Medina Lacson de Leon School of
Arts and Trades (MLLSAT) into the Bataan Polytechnic State
College (BPSC), and integrating thereto the Bataan Community
Colleges (BCC). Section 24 of R.A. No. 8562 provides that:

It is clear, then, that local autonomy and decentralization
do not deal directly with issues concerning ownership,
classification, use or control of properties of the public domain
held by local governments. The State retains power over
property of the public domain, exercised through Congress.
The RTC ordered the Province of Bataan to deliver the
owner's duplicate copy of OCT No. N-182 to the Register of
Deeds of Bataan, free from any lien or encumbrance, to execute
the corresponding deed of conveyance in favor of BPSC, and to
cause the transfer and registration of the title to and in the name
of the said college. The Province of Bataan erroneously believed
that it could mortgage the subject lots, notwithstanding that it
held the same in trust for the State and despite the fact that
the said lots were actually being occupied by two government
schools. As the RTC urged, then, the Province of Bataan must
address this issue of security for its loans with LBP. It cannot
complain that its compliance with the order of the RTC might
violate the non-impairment clause of the Constitution, since its
duty to provide a replacement security for its loans with LBP
is clear.

All parcels of land belonging to the government
occupied by the Medina Lacson de Leon School of Arts and
Trades and the Bataan Community Colleges are hereby
declared to be the property of the Bataan Polytechnic State
College and shall be titled under that name: Provided,
That should the State College cease to exist or be abolished
or should such parcels of land aforementioned be no longer
needed by the State College, the same shall revert to the
Province of Bataan.
Cong. Garcia wrote to then Governor of Bataan Leonardo
Roman, and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Bataan,
requesting them to cause the transfer of the title of the aforesaid
lots to BPSC. No transfer was effected.
Thus, Cong. Garcia, along with the faculty members and
some concerned students of BPSC filed a Special Civil Action
for Mandamus with the RTC of Balanga, Bataan against the
Governor and the petitioner.

There is no dispute that the Congress has expressly
intended to entrust to BPSC the titles to the subject lots. Being
the sole beneficiary of Section 24 of R.A. No. 8562, BPSC is the
real party in interest, and is entitled to mandamus to enforce
its right thereunder.

Ruling: The Court takes instructions from the case,
of Salas w. Jarencio, 150-B Phil. 670 (1972) as to properties
belonging to the municipal government.
It may, therefore, be laid down as a general rule that
regardless of the source or classification of land in the
possession of a municipality, excepting those acquired with its
own funds in its private or corporate capacity, such property
is held in trust for the State for the benefit of its inhabitants,
whether it be for governmental or proprietary purposes. It holds
such lands subject to the paramount power of the legislature

The petition for review on certiorari is DENIED.

the legislature may properly leave to the courts or to a commission

been taken under the law to bring the municipal corporation into
existence.
17.

2.
Legal view - This sanctions the possession by the State
of absolute control over local governments, local government being
mere creatures of the State. The right of municipal corporations to
govern themselves in their purely local affairs will not be held to be
abridged except upon clear expression of the legislative will. The equal
protection clause may be validly invoked by a municipal corporation
to complain against a lesser grant of jurisdiction and functions in
its charter as against a larger grant of powers and autonomy by
Congress in the charters of other municipal corporations. (Enriquez

v. Secretary of Finance, 27 SCRA 1261.)

Local Governments, history

The barangays, municipalities, cities, and provinces of today
evolved from the barangays of pre-Spanish times, the pueblos
(municipalities), cabildos (cities), and provincias (provinces) of the
Spanish colonial days and the townships of the American regime.
As of December 2022, there are 81 provinces, 148 cities (33
highly urbanized, 5 independent component, 110 component), 1,486
municipalities, and 42,022 barangays in the country.

A.

Comments

Originally, the laws on local governments were principally
found in the Revised Administrative Code.
In 1959, the Local Autonomy Act (R.A. 2264.) was enacted.
This was an act amending the laws governing local governments
by increasing their autonomy and reorganizing the provincial
governments.
In 1963, The Barrio Charter (R.A. 3590.) was passed, which
provided for the organization of Barrios and provided for the powers,
rights and duties of the barrio council.

R.A. 5185 otherwise known as the Decentralization Act, an
Act granting further autonomous powers to local governments, was
passed in 1967.

26

27

Martial Law was declared in 1972, bringing with it the
Integrated Reorganization Plan, Article XVII of which dealt on
Local Government and Community Development.
From September 1972 up to January 1982, when Martial Law
was lifted, Presidential Decrees and Proclamations were issued
affecting local governments.
The laws on local governments were so numerous, separate
and confusing that they were codified as mandated in the 1973
Constitution. Thus, Batas Pambansa Big. 337, the Local Government
Code was finally approved and took effect on May 12, 1983.
To further assure decentralization and development in the
countryside, the 1987 Constitution mandated the enactment of
another local government code. To implement this constitutional
directive, R.A. 7160 was enacted by Congress and signed into law on
October 10, 1991 by the President. It took effect on January 1, 1992.
SEC. 2. Declaration of Policy. - (a) It is hereby
declared the policy of the State that the territorial
and political subdivisions of the State shall
enjoy genuine and meaningful local autonomy to
enable them to attain their fullest development
as self-reliant communities and make them more
effective partners in the attainment of national
goals. Toward this end, the State shall provide
for a more responsive and accountable local
government structure instituted through a system
of decentralization whereby local government
units shall be given more powers, authority,
responsibilities, and resources. The process of
decentralization shall proceed from the National
Government to the local government units.
(b) It is also the policy of the State to ensure
the accountability of local government units
through the institution of effective mechanisms of
recall, initiative and referendum.
(c) It is likewise the policy of the State to
require all national agencies and offices to conduct
periodic consultations with appropriate local
government units, non-governmental and people's

implemented in their respective jurisdictions.
A.

Comments

This section is based on Sections 1, 2, and 3, Article X of the
1987 Constitution.
The declared policy of this Code is the promotion of local
autonomy, through a system of decentralization.
The history of this trend towards local autonomy is presented
below:
1900. President McKinley's Instructions. - It laid down
the policy that municipal governments should be subject to
the least degree of supervision and control, and confined to the
narrowest limits.
1916. Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916. T he GovernorGeneral as the supreme executive power had general
supervision and control of all the executive departments
and bureaus of the government, and all executive functions
directly under him or within one of the executive departments
under his supervision and control. Executive functions of local
subdivisions come under this all-embracing authority.
1935. Constitution. It provided that the President shall
only have general supervision over all local governments.
1953. Lacson v. Roque. T his is the departure from the
Planas v. Gil and the Villena v. Secretary rulings. General
supervision does not contemplate control. The President
cannot suspend Mayor Lacson of Manila based on the pendency
of a case of libel filed against the Mayor in the Court of First
Instance.
1959. Local Autonomy Act (R.A. 2264.) - This is an act
amending the laws, governing local governments by increasing
their autonomy and reorganizing the provincial governments.
1967. Decentralization Act (R.A. 5185.)-This act granted
further autonomous powers to local governments.
1972. Integrated Reorganization Plan.

1973. Constitution.
Section 10 declares that the State
shall guarantee and promote the autonomy of local government
units. Thrust of the 1973 Constitution is for fullest autonomy
of local government units. (Ceniza v. Commission on Elections,
95 SCRA 763.)
1983. The Local Government Code (B.P. Big. 337.)- It
was enacted codifying the numerous laws on local governments
and granted more autonomy to local governments.
1987. Constitution. S ection 25, Article II declares that:
the State shall ensure the autonomy of local governments. The
1987 Constitution provides for an entire article (Art. X.) on
local governments. (Secs. 1-14 on General Provisions and Secs.
15-21 on Autonomous Regions.)
1991. The Local Government Code of 1991 (R.A. 7160.)
was enacted.
National officials should not only comply with the constitutional
provisions on local autonomy, but should also appreciate the spirit
of liberty upon which these provisions are based. (San Juan v. Civil
Service Commission, 196 SCRA 69.)
The principle of local autonomy does not make local
governments sovereign within the state, it simply means
decentralization. (Basco v. Philippine Amusements and Gaming
Corporation, 197 SCRA 52.)
SEC. 3. Operative Principles of Decentralization.
- The formulation and implementation of policies
and measures on local autonomy shall be guided by
the following operative principles:
(a) There shall be an effective allocation
among the different local government units of their
respective powers, functions, responsibilities, and
resources;
(b) There shall be established in every local
government unit an accountable, efficient, and
dynamic organizational structure and operating
mechanism that will meet the priority needs and
service requirements of its comm unities;
(c) Subject to civil service law, rules and
regulations, local officials and employees paid
wholly or mainly from local funds shall be appointed

officials, like the President as provided for in Section 25, and
the Philippine National Police under Section 28 in their intergovernmental relations with the local government units.
SEC. 5. Rules of Interpretation.
In the

in its favor, and in case of doubt, any question
thereon shall be resolved in favor of devolution
of powers and of the lower local government unit.
Any fair and reasonable doubt as to the existence of
the power shall be interpreted in favor of the local
government unit concerned;

This section also strengthens the power oflocal governments, to
enact ordinances under the general welfare provisions by providing
for liberal interpretation in favor of local governments.

(b) In case of doubt, any tax ordinance or

Comments

This section provides that any doubt or question on a power of
a local government shall be resolved in favor of devolution of powers
and in favor of the lower local government unit.
However, for tax measures enacted by local governments, any
doubt shall be construed strictly against the local government and

Comments

Congress has the power to create or abolish a province, city,
municipality, or any other political subdivision.
The sangguniang panlalawigan or sangguniang panlungsod
has the power to create and abolish barangays located within its
territorial jurisdiction.
SEC. 7. Creation and Conversion. -As a general
rule, the creation of a local government unit or its
conversion from one level to another level shall
be based on verifiable indicators of viability and
projected capacity to provide services, to wit:
(a) Income. It must be sufficient, based on
acceptable standards, to provide for all essential
government facilities and services and special
functions commensurate with the size of its
population, as expected of the local government
unit concerned;
(b) Population. - It shall be determined
as the total number of inhabitants, within the
territorial jurisdiction of the local government unit
concerned; and

34

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

(c) Land Area.
It must be contiguous,
unless it comprises two (2) or more islands or is
separated by a local government unit independent
of the others; properly identified by metes and
bounds with technical descriptions; and sufficient
to provide for such basic services and facilities to
meet the requirements of its populace.
Compliance with the foregoing indicators shall
be attested to by the Department of Finance (DOF),
the National Statistics Office (NSO), and the Lands
Management Bureau (LMB) of the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).
A.

Decided Cases

1.
Petitioners have not demonstrated that the delineation
of the land area of the proposed City of Maka ti (without metes and
bounds) will cause confusion as to its boundaries. Congress has
refrained from using the metes and bounds description of land areas
of other local government units.

MARIANO v. COMELEC
242 SCRA 211, March 7, 1995, Pun0, J.
Facts: Petitioners assail Section 2 of R.A. 7854 as
unconstitutional on the ground that it did not properly identify
the land area or territorial jurisdiction of Maka ti by metes and
bounds, in violation of Section 10 of the 1987 Constitution in
relation to Sections 7 and 450 of the Local Government Code.
Held: We find no merit in the petition. The delineated
land area of the proposed city of Maka ti provides that: SEC. 2.
City of Makati. The Municipality of Makati shall be converted
into a highly urbanized city to be known as the City of Makati,
hereinafter referred to as the City, which shall comprise the
present territory of the Municipality of Makati in Metropolitan
Manila Area over which it has jurisdiction bounded on
the northeast by Pasig River and beyond by the City of
Mandaluyong and the Municipality of Pasig; on the southeast
by the municipalities of Pateros and Taguig; on the southwest
by the City of Pasay and the Municipality of Taguig; and, on
the northwest, by the City of Manila.

Book I- General Provisions

35

The importance ofdrawing the precise strokes of territorial
boundaries cannot be over emphasized. The boundaries must
be clear for they define the limits of the territorial jurisdiction
of the local government unit. Beyond these limits, its acts
are ultra vires. Any uncertainty in the boundaries will sow
costly conflicts in the exercise of governmental powers which
ultimately will prejudice the people's (sic) welfare. This is
the evil sought to be avoided by the Local Government Code
in requiring that the land area be spelled out in metes and
bounds, with technical description.
Given the facts, we cannot perceive how this evil can be
brought about by the description made in Section 2. Petitioners
have not demonstrated that the delineation of the land area
of the proposed City of Makati will cause confusion as to its
boundaries. The delineation did not change even by an inch the
land area previously covered. Section 2 did not add, subtract,
divide, or multiply the established land area of Makati. In
language that cannot be any clearer, the city's land area shall
comprise the present territory of the municipality. We take
judicial notice of the fact that Congress has also refrained from
using the metes and bounds description of land areas of other
local government units with unsettled boundary disputes.
2.
The technical description, containing the metes and
bounds of a municipality's territory stated in E.O. No. 258 creating
the Municipality of Sinacaban, Misamis Oriental, is binding.
MUNICIPALITY OF JIMENEZ v. BAZ, JR.
265 SCRA 182, December 2, 1996, Mendoza, J.

Facts: The Municipality of Sinacaban was created by
Executive Order No. 258 (August 30, 1949) of then President
Elpidio Quirino. It provides: There is hereby created, in the
Province of Misamis Occidental, a municipality to be known
as the Municipality of Sinacaban, which shall consist of the
Southern portion of the Municipality of Jimenez, Misamis
Occidental, more particularly described as follows: '
On the north by a line starting from point 1 the center
of the lighthouse on the Tabo-o point S. 84° 30W., 7,250
meters to point 2 which is on the bank of Palilan River
branch; thence following Palilan River branch 2,400 meters
southwesterly to point 3; thence a straight line
87° 00'W,

36

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

22,550 meters to point 4, where this intersects the Misamis
Occidental-Zamboanga boundary; on the west by the present
Misamis Occidental-Zamboanga boundary; and on the south
by the present Jimenez-Tudela boundary; and on the east, by
the limits of the municipal waters which the municipality of
Sinacaban shall have pursuant to Section 2321 of the Revised
Administrative Code. The Municipality of Jimenez shall have
its present territory, minus the portion thereof included in the
Municipality of Sinacaban.
Based on the technical description, Sinacaban laid
claim to a portion of Barrio Tabo-o and Barrios Macabayao,
Adorable, Sinara Baja, and Sinara Alto. The claim was filed
with the Provincial Board of Misamis Occidental against the
Municipality of Jimenez. Jimenez countered in its answer that
while under EO 258, the disputed area is part of Sinacaban, it
nonetheless asserts jurisdiction on the basis of an agreement
entered with Sinacaban in 1950. The agreement (Resolution
No. 77), which was approved by the Provincial Board of
Misamis Occidental states that: "The barrio of Macabayao,
Sitio Adorable and site will be a part of Jimenez town."
The Provincial Board declared the disputed area to
be part of Sinacaban. Jimenez filed a petition for certiorari,
prohibition and mandamus in the RTC of Oroquieta City,
against Sinacaban, et al. The RTC denied" the petition and the
subsequent motion for reconsideration. Hence, this petition on
whether it is the boundary provided in EO 258 or in Resolution
No. 77 which should be used as basis for adjudicating
Sinacaban's claim.

Held: Jimenez argues that the RTC erred in ordering a
relocation survey of the boundary of Sinacaban, because the
barangays which Sinacaban are claiming are not enumerated
in EO 258 and that in any event, the parties entered into an
agreement whereby the barangays in question were considered
part of the territory of Jimenez. EO 258 does not say that
Sinacaban comprises only the barrios (now called barangays)
therein mentioned. What it says is that "Sinacaban contains"
those barrios without saying they are the only ones comprising
it. The reason for this is that the technical description in
EO 258, containing the metes and bounds of its territory, is
controlling.

Book I General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

37

The trial court correctly ordered a relocation survey based
on EO 258 as the only means of determining the boundaries
of the municipality and consequently the question to which
municipality the barangays questioned belong. Therefore, if
Resolution No. 77 of the Provincial Board is contrary to the
technical description of the territory of Sinacaban, it cannot be
used by Jimenez as basis for opposing the claim of Sinacaban.
SEC. 8. Division and Merger.
Division
and merger of existing local government units
shall comply with the same requirements herein
prescribed for their creation: Provided, however,
That such division shall not reduce the income,
population, or land area of the local government
unit or units concerned to Jess than the minimum
requirements prescribed in this Code: Provided,
further, That the income classification of the
original local government unit or units shall not
fall below its current income classification prior
to such division. The income classification of local
government units shall be updated within six (6)
months from the effectivity of this Code to reflect
the changes in their financial position resulting
from the increased revenues as provided herein.
SEC. 9. Abolition of Local Government Units.
A local government unit may be abolished when
its income, population, or land area has been
irreversibly reduced to less than the minimum
standards prescribed for its creation under Book
III of this Code, as certified by the national agencies
mentioned in Section 7 hereof to Congress or to the
sanggunian concerned, as the case may be.
The law or ordinance abolishing a local
government unit shall specify the province, city,
municipality, or barangay with which the local
government unit sought to be abolished will be
incorporated or merged.

A.

Comments

The Code now lays down three important indicators of viability
in the creation oflocal government units namely: income, population,
and land area.

SEC. 10. Plebiscite Requirement.
No
creation, division, merger, abolition, or substantial
alteration of boundaries of local government units
shall take effect unless approved by a majority of
the votes cast in a plebiscite called for the purpose
in the political unit or units directly affected. Said
plebiscite shall be conducted by the Commission on
Elections (COMELEC) within one hundred twenty
(120) days from the date of effectivity of the law or
ordinance effecting such action, unless said law or
ordinance fixes another date.
A.

Decided Cases

1.
The power to merge administrative regions is a power
which has traditionally been lodged with the President to facilitate the
exercise of the power of general supervision over local governments.
There is no conflict between the power of the President to merge
administrative regions with the constitutional provision requiring
plebiscite in the merger of local government units because the
requirement of the plebiscite in a merger expressly applies only to
provinces, cities, municipalities or barangays, not to administrative
regions. (Abbas v. Commissions on Elections, 179 CRA 287.)
2.
A case involving a boundary dispute between local
government units presents a prejudicial question which must first
be decided before plebiscites for creation of proposed barangays may
be held.

CITY OF PASIG v. COMELEC
314 SCRA 179, September 10, 1999,
Ynares-Santiago, J.
Facts: The residents of Karangalan Village petitioned
that they be segregated from its mother Barangays Manggahan
and Dela Paz, City of Pasig and to be known as Barangay
Karangalan. Plebiscite on the creation was set for June 22,
1996. Meanwhile, the City of Pasig also created Barangay
Napico in Pasig City. The plebiscite was set for March 15,

Book I General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

39

1997. Upon learning of the ordinances creating the barangays,
the Municipality of Cainta moved to suspend or cancel the
respective plebiscite schedules by petitions filed with the
COMELEC.
The municipality of Cainta called the attention of the
COMELEC to a pending case in the RTC of Antipolo, Rizal
for settlement of boundary dispute, in which the proposed
barangays involve areas included in the boundary dispute
subject of said pending case. The COMELEC ordered the
plebiscite for the creation of Barangay Karangalan to be
held in abeyance. However, the COMELEC ruled differently
with respect to the creation of Barangay Napico, saying that
the petition has become moot and academic by reason of the
holding of a plebiscite on March 15, 1997.

Held: We agree with the position of the COMELEC that
the civil case involving the boundary dispute between the
Municipality of Cainta and City of Pasig presents a prejudicial
question which must first be decided before plebiscites for the
creation of the proposed barangays may be held. While the
general rule is that a prejudicial question contemplates a civil
and a criminal action and does not come into play when both
cases are civil, in the interest of good order, the Supreme Court
can very well suspend action on one case pending the final
outcome of another case closely interrelated or linked to the
first.
When territorial jurisdiction is an issue raised in the
pending civil case. until and unless such issue is resolved with
finality, to define the territorial jurisdiction of the proposed
barangay would be an exercise in futility. For indeed, a
requisite for the creation of a barangay, is for its territorial
jurisdiction to be properly identified by metes and bounds or by
more or less permanent natural boundaries.
However, we do not agree with the contention that merely
because a plebiscite had already been held in the case of the
proposed Barangay Napico, the petition of the Municipality
of Cainta had already been rendered moot and academic.
The issues raised by the Municipality of Cainta before the
COMELEC against the holding of a plebiscite for the creation
of Barangay Napico are still pending determination before the
Antipolo RTC.

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

3.
The COMELEC had to concentrate all its manpower and
other resources on its preparation for the May 2013 Elections, and
to ensure that it would not be derailed, it had to defer the conduct
of all plebiscites including that of R.A. 10360. The COMELEC has
residual power to conduct a plebiscite even beyond the deadline
prescribed by Jaw.
CAGAS v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
708 SCRA 672, October 25, 2013, Carpio, J.
Facts: This Resolution resolves the Petition for
Prohibition, filed by Marc Douglas IV C. Cagas, in his capacity
as taxpayer, to prohibit the COMELEC from conducting a
plebiscite for the creation of the province of Davao Occidental
simultaneously with the 28 October 2013 Barangay Elections
within the whole province of Davao de) Sur, except in Davao
City.
Cagas, while he was representative of the first legislative
district of Davao de) Sur, filed with Hon. Franklin Bautista,
then representative of the second legislative district of the
same province, House Bill No. 4451, a bill creating the province
of Davao Occidental. H.B. No. 4451 was signed into law as
Republic Act No. 10360, the Charter of the Province of Davao
Occidental on January 14, 2013 and published on January 21,
2013.
Considering that R.A. No. 10360 shall take effect 15 days
after its publication, COMELEC, therefore, only had until 6
April 2013 to conduct the plebiscite.
Ruling: The COMELEC's power to administer elections
includes the power to conduct a plebiscite beyond the schedule
prescribed by law. The conduct of a plebiscite is necessary for
the creation of a province under Sections 10 and 11 of Article X
of the Constitution. Section 10of R.A. 7160 requires a plebiscite
to be conducted within 120 days from date of effectivity of the
law, unless said law fixed another date.
Section 46 of R.A. No. 10360, however, specifically
provides that the plebiscite for the creation of the province of
Davao Occidental be held within 60 days from the effectivity of
R.A. No. 10360, or until 6 April 2013. Cagas views the period
"60 days from the effectivity" in R.A. No. 10360 as absolute

Book I General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

41

and mandatory; thus, COMELEC has no legal basis to hold a
plebiscite on 28 October 2013.
The Constitution, however, grants the COMELEC the
power to "enforce and administer all laws and regulations
relative to the conduct of an election, plebiscite, initiative,
referendum and recall." The COMELEC has "exclusive charge
of the enforcement and administration of all laws relative
to the conduct of elections for the purpose of ensuring free,
orderly and honest elections." The text and intent of Section
2(1) of Article IX(C) is to give COMELEC "all the necessary
and incidental powers for it to achieve the objective of holding
free, orderly, honest, peaceful and credible elections."
The tight time frame in the enactment, signin g into
law, and effectivity of R.A. No. 10360 on 5 February 2013,
coupled with the subsequent conduct of the National and Local
Elections on 13 May 2013 as mandated by the Constitution,
rendered impossible the holding of a plebiscite for the creation
of the province of Davao Occidental on or before 6 April 2013
as scheduled in R.A. No. 10360. The COMELEC is justified,
and did not act with grave abuse of discretion, in postponing
the holding of the plebiscite for the creation of the province of
Davao Occidental to 28 October 2013 to synchronize it with the
Barangay Elections.
We DISMISS the petition for lack of merit.
4.
The voters of a city which used to be a component city of a
province are not entitled to vote in a plebiscite for the division of said
province, after the city has been converted into a highly urbanized
city (HUC).
DEL ROSARIO v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
G.R. No. 247610, March 10, 2020, Reyes, A., Jr., J.
Facts: Petitioners Cynthia S. Del Rosario, et al. are all
residents of various barangays in Puerto Princesa City; while
the other petitioners are residents of three municipalities in
Palawan. Claiming standing as taxpayers and registered voters
of Puerto Princesa City and of Palawan, they ask this Court
to declare RA No. 11259 entitled "Charter of the Provinces of
Palawan del Norte, Palawan Oriental and Palawan del Sur"
unconstitutional and invalid. Consequently, they also seek the

42

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

issuance of a writ of prohibition against the conduct of the May
11, 2020 plebiscite provided for in Sections 5l and 54 of RA
No. 11259, without the participation of the electorate of Puerto
Princesa City, as well as the disbursement of funds relative
thereto.
The petition alleges that RA No. 11259 suffers from
three infirmities which render it unconstitutional: first, its
passage and enactment into law was made in gross violation
of the public's right to take part in the conduct of public
affairs through public hearings and consultations; second, it
disqualifies the voters of Puerto Princesa City from voting in
the scheduled plebiscite, contrary to Article X, Section 10 of the
Constitution; and third, it provides for a substantial change in
the sharing of proceeds from the development and utilization of
the national wealth between the three new provinces and their
existing municipalities and barangays, in violation of Article
X, Section 7 of the Constitution.
Ruling: Considering the foregoing parameters, We hold
that petitioners Cynthia S. Del Rosario, et al. lack standing
to file the present petition. As residents of Puerto Princesa,
they have become residents of an entity separate, distinct,
and autonomous from the province of Palawan, when Puerto
Princesa became an HUC. In fact, said petitioners, as qualified
voters of Puerto Princesa, have not participated in the elections
for provincial officials of Palawan. By the same token, they
have likewise lost the right to vote in the plebiscite for the
division of the province of Palawan. Nevertheless, this Court
cannot dismiss the petition on this point alone, considering
that petitioners Loreta N. Alsa, Hiya I. Hassan, and John
Vincent C. Colili are residents and registered voters of the
province of Palawan, and as such, are directly affected by the
implementation of the assailed statute, which will divide their
home province into three distinct and separate provinces.
This Court sustains the contention of the Solicitor General
that the assailed statute does not run afoul of the constitutional
policy on public consultation because its effectivity is still
subject to the supreme mode of public consultation: the ballot.
Petitioners must be reminded that ours is a republican state,
where the people are heard primarily through their elected
representatives. Sovereignty resides in the people, but is
primarily manifested through their elected representatives. In

Book I- General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

43

the case at bar, the duly elected representatives of the people
of Palawan at every level: municipal, provincial, and national,
have registered their support and consent to the proposed
division of their province.
A careful survey of the cases reveals that the Court
has considered three key factors in determining whether an
LGU is a "political unit directly affected" by an LGU change
or conversion: territorial alteration, political effects, and
economic effects. The Court shall now apply this three-factor
test to Puerto Princesa and the rest of Palawan, in the light of
the parties' pleadings and the applicable law.
On territorial alteration, this Court agrees with
respondents that the assailed statute will not result in the
alteration of Puerto Princesa's territorial jurisdiction. Section
4 of the law provides in part that "The terrestrial jurisdictions
of the newly created provinces shall be within the present
metes and bounds of all the municipalities that comprise the
respective provinces" without reference to Puerto Princesa.
The Court has pored over the law and finds nothing in it that
changes the metes and bounds of Puerto Princesa's territory.
The realignment of Palawan's legislative district boundaries
does not amount to a territorial alteration so as to render
Puerto Princesa directly affected by the division of the province
of Palawan, for the re-drawing of legislative district boundaries
does not require electoral approval through a plebiscite.
As regards political and economic effects, the Court first
considers the applicable laws. On political effects, Sec. 452,
LGC clearly provides that the qualified voters of HUC "shall
remain excluded from voting for elective provincial officials."
On the economic effects of LGU changes or conversions,
this is a matter of policy in which the judiciary must defer to the
other two great branches of government. The holistic analysis
of the economic impact of an LGU change or conversion on
its neighboring LGUs concerns the wisdom, prudence, and
economic viability of the proposed division, and do not pertain
to the legality thereof.
The present petition for prohibition is hereby DISMISSED.

SEC. 11. Selection and Transfer of Local
Government Site, Offices, and Facilities• (a) The law
or ordinance creating or merging local government

units shall specify the seat of government from
where governmental and corporate services
shall be delivered. In selecting said site, factors
relating to geographical centrality, accessibility,
availability of transportation and communication
facilities, drainage and sanitation, development
and economic progress, and other relevant considerations shall be taken into account.
(b) When conditions and development in the
local government unit concerned have significantly
changed subsequent to the establishment of the
seat of government, its sanggunian may, after
public hearing and by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of
all its members, transfer the same to a site better
suited to its needs: Provided, however, That no
such transfer shall be made outside the territorial
boundaries ofthe local government unit concerned.
The old site, together with the improvements
thereon, may be disposed of by sale or lease or
converted to such other use as the sanggunian
concerned may deem beneficial to the local
government unit concerned and its inhabitants.
(c) Local government offices and facilities
shall not be transferred, relocated, or converted
to other uses unless public hearings are first
conducted for the purpose and the concurrence of
the majority of all the members of the sanggunian
concerned is obtained.
SEC. 12. Government Centers.
Provinces,
cities, and municipalities shall endeavor to
establish a government center where offices,
agencies, or branches of the National Government,
local government units, or government-owned or
controlled corporations may, as far as practicable,
be located.
In designating such a center, the local
government unit concerned shall take into account
the existing facilities of national and local agencies
and offices which may serve as the government

Book I- General Provisions
Title One - Basic Principles

center as contemplated under this Section. The
National Government, local government unit or
government-owned or controlled-corporation
concerned shall bear the expenses for the
construction of its buildings and facilities in the
government center.
SEC. 13. Naming of Local Government Units
and Public Places, Streets and Structures• (a) The
sangguniang panlalawigan may, in consultation
with the Philippine Historical Commission (PHC),
change the name of the following within its
territorial jurisdiction:
(1) Component cities and municipalities,
upon the recommendation of the sanggunian
concerned;

(2) Provincial roads, avenues, boulevards,
thoroughfares, and bridges;
(3) Public vocational or technical schools
and other post-secondary and tertiary schools;

(4) Provincial hospitals, health centers
and other health facilities; and
(5) Any other public place or building
owned by the provincial government.

(b) The sanggunians of highly urbanized
cities and of component cities whose charters
prohibit their voters from voting for provincial

A.

Comments

The legal existence of a municipal corporation is to be determined
by the law creating it. Usually, the law fixes the beginning of the
corporate existence of a municipal corporation from the effectivity
of the law creating it or upon the organization of its government or
upon the qualification of its officers.
Where the law, however, is silent as to the beginning of its
corporate existence, it shall commence upon the election and
qualification of its chief executive and a majority of the members of
its sanggunian.
SEC. 15. Political and Corporate Nature of
Local Government Units• Every local government
unit created or recognized under this Code is a
body politic and corporate endowed with powers to
be exercised by it in conformity with law. As such,
it shall exercise powers as a political subdivision of
the National Government and as a corporate entity
representing the inhabitants of its territory.

A.

Comments

This section defines a local government and embodies the dual
personality of a local government as a subdivision or agency of the
government, and as a corporate entity representing the inhabitants
of its territory as pronounced in Philippine Jurisprudence. (Vilas v.
City of Manila, infra.)
Municipal corporations perform dual functions, one
governmental and another corporate. In the exercise of its
governmental powers and duties, municipal corporations are
agencies of the national government. When engaged in corporate
activities, municipal corporations are on the same plane as any
private corporation. The regulation violated by petitioner was
a zoning ordinance, which seeks to protect the people and their
property, and to promote their well-being. It was enacted in the
exercise of the police power, which essentially, is political and
governmental in nature. (Vilas v. City of Manila, 42 Phil. 953; 220
U.S. 545; Mendoza v. De Leon, 33 Phil. 508; People v. Cruz, 54 Phil.
24; Seng Kee & Co. • Earnshaw, 56 Phil. 204.) In other words, it was
promulgated by the municipal government of Lucena acting as an
agent of the national government. Hence, it partakes of the nature of
"government promulgated rule," although limited in its application
to said locality. (Tiu San • Republic, 96 Phil. 817.)

B.

Decided Case

1.
As a government instrumentality, the Municipality
of Tangkal, Lanao del Norte can only act for secular purposes
and in ways that have primarily secular effects-consistent with
the non-establishment clause. The Municipality of Tangkal is
constitutionally proscribed from adopting, much less exercising, any
religion, including Islam.

MUNICIPALITY OF TANGKAL, PROVINCE
OF LANAO DEL NORTE v. BALINDONG
814 SCRA 237, January 11, 2017, Jardeleza, J.
Facts: The private respondents, heirs of the late Macalabo
Alompo, fled a Complaint with the Shari'a District Court of
Marawi City against the petitioner, Municipality of Tangkal,
for recovery of possession and ownership of a parcel of land
with an area of 25 hectares located at Barangay Banisilon,
Tangkal, Lanao del Norte.

Book I General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

49

The Municipality of Tangkal filed an Urgent Motion to
Dismiss on the ground of improper venue and lack of jurisdiction.
It argued that since it has no religious affiliation and represents
no cultural or ethnic tribe, it cannot be considered as a Muslim
under the Code of Muslim Personal Laws. Moreover, since the
complaint for recovery of land is a real action, it should have
been filed in the appropriate RTC of Lanao de! Norte.
In its Order dated March 9, 2010, the Shari'a District Court
denied the Municipality ofTangkal's motion to dismiss. It held
that since the mayor of Tangkal, Abdulazis A.M. Batingolo,
is a Muslim, the case "is an action involving Muslims, hence,
the court has original jurisdiction concurrently with that of
regular/civil courts."

Ruling: The Code of Muslim Personal Laws defines
a "Muslim" as "a person who testifies to the oneness of God
and the Prophethood of Muhammad and professes Islam."
Although the definition does not explicitly distinguish between
natural and juridical persons, it nonetheless connotes the
exercise of religion, which is a fundamental personal right. The
ability to testify to the "oneness of God and the Prophethood of
Muhammad" and to profess Islam is, by its nature, restricted
to natural persons. In contrast, juridical persons are artificial
beings with "no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts,
no desires. They are considered persons only by virtue of legal
fiction. The Municipality of Tangkal falls under this category.
Under the Local Government Code, a municipality is a body
politic and corporate that exercises powers as a political
subdivision of the national government and as a corporate
entity representing the inhabitants of its territory. (Local Gov't
Code, Sec. 15.)
Furthermore, as a government instrumentality, the
Municipality of Tangkal can only act for secular purposes and
in ways that have primarily secular effects-consistent with
the non-establishment clause. Hence, even if it is assumed
that juridical persons are capable of practicing religion, the
Municipality of Tangkal is constitutionally proscribed from
adopting, much less exercising, any religion, including Islam.
The Shari'a District Court appears to have understood
the foregoing principles, as it conceded that the Municipality
of Tangkal "is neither a Muslim nor a Christian." Yet it still

60

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

proceeded to attribute the religious affiliation of the mayor
to the municipality. This is manifest error on the part of the
Shari'a District Court. It is an elementary principle that a
municipality has a personality that is separate and distinct
from its mayor, vice-mayor, sanggunian, and other officers
composing it. And under no circumstances can this corporate
veil be pierced on purely religious considerations as the Shari'a
District Court has done without running afoul the inviolability
of the separation of Church and State enshrined in the
Constitution.
The Shari'a District Court had no jurisdiction under the
law to decide private respondents' complaint because not all
of the parties involved in the action are Muslims. Since it was
clear from the complaint that the real party defendant was
the Municipality of Tangkal, the Shari'a District Court should
have simply applied the basic doctrine of separate juridical
personality and motu proprio dismissed the case.
The petition is GRAN TED.
SEC. 16. General Welfare.
Every local
government unit shall exercise the powers expressly
granted, those necessarily implied therefrom,
as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or

incidental for its efficient and effective governance,
and those which are essential to the promotion
of the general welfare. Within their respective

territorial jurisdictions, local government units
shall ensure and support, among other things, the
preservation and enrichment of culture, promote
health and safety, enhance the right of the people
to a balanced ecology, encourage and support
the development of appropriate and self-reliant
scientific and technological capabilities, improve
public morals, enhance economic prosperity and
social justice, promote full employment among their
residents, maintain peace and order, and preserve
the comfort and convenience of their inhabitants.
A.

Comments

This is the so-called "general welfare clause" which empowers
local government units to enact and implement measures for the

Book I General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

61

general well-being of their inhabitants. Its basis is the police power
of the State as delegated to local government units.
Verily, the powers of a local government unit are not absolute.
They are subject to limitations laid down by the Constitution and the
laws such as our Civil Code. Moreover, the exercise of such powers
should be subservient to paramount considerations of health and
well-being of the members of the community. Every local government
unit has the sworn obligation to enact measures that will enhance
the public health, safety and convenience, maintain peace and order,
and promote the general prosperity of the inhabitants of the local
units. Based on this objective, the local government should refrain
from acting towards that which prejudice or adversely affect the
general welfare. (Makasiano v. Diokno, 212 SCRA 464.)
B.

Decided Cases

1.
The municipal council of Malabon acted within its powers
when it enacted an ordinance prohibiting jueteng within the limits
of the municipality. (DU.S. v. Espiritusanto, 23 Phil. 610, 1912.)
2.
Since it is the ancient obligation of the individual to
assist in the protection of peace and order in the community
(posse comitatus), residents of a municipality may be compelled
to render civil service. Hence, an ordinance requiring able bodied
male residents from18-50 years old to assist in the apprehension of
bandits and thieves for a period not exceeding 5 days in one month
does not violate the liberty of citizens. (U.S. w. Pompeya, 31 Phil.
245, 1915.)
3.
While the panguingue is not a game of chance, it is still
the proper subject of regulation by the municipality acting under
their delegated police power, whose laudable intention is to impose
public morals and promote the prosperity of the people. (U.S. v.
Salaveria, 39 Phil. 102, 1918.)
4.
As long as the ordinance which prohibits the use of bells
or criers to attract buyers applies to all kinds and classes of people
alike doing business in the prohibited area, such may be regulated.
The regulation of business affairs of the city is a matter of discretion
of the council acting under its police power. (People v. Gabriel, 43
Phil. 641, 1922.)
5.
The Municipal Board of Manila can pass an ordinance for
the regulation of the operation and maintenance of slot machines
since such slot machines are inimical to the general welfare of the

52

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

population. Such ordinance is a lawful exercise of the police power of
the State. (Recreation and Amusement Ass'n. v. City of Manila, 100
Phil. 950, 1957.)
6.
An ordinance passed by the City of Cebu, designed to
eliminate animal waste in city streets and other public places is
a measure designed to promote the health and well-being of the
residents. Such being the case, the ordinance is valid. (People u.
Solon, 110 Phil. 39, 1960.)
7.
The City of Olongapo can require building permits on
buildings located inside the U.S. Naval Reservation under the
General Welfare Clause which scope is wide, well-nigh all embracing,
covering every aspect of public health, morals, safety and well-being
and good order of the community. (People u. Gozo, 53 SCRA 476,
1973.)
8.
Prohibition of admission in an amusement place of
two or more persons with only one ticket is valid, as it is in the
interest of preventing fraud in the collection of municipal taxes and
in accordance with public safety and general welfare. (Samson v.
Mayor of Bacolod City, 60 SCRA 276, 1970.)
9.
The Municipal Council of Mandaluyong declared Lots
Nos. 5 and 6 of Highway Hills Subdivision sold by Ortigas & Co.
to spouses Angeles as part of the commercial and industrial zone
of the municipality. The deeds of sale provided that these lots be
used exclusively for residential purposes. These restrictions were
later annotated in the titles of said lots. An exception to the general
welfare powers delegated to municipalities is when the exercise of
its power will conflict with vested rights arising from its contracts.
However, in this case, police power is superior to contractural
stipulations between parties on the use of lands sold by subdivisions
even if said conditions are annotated on the Torrens Title. (Ortigas
&& Co., Limited Partnership u. Feati Bank and Trust Co., 94 SCRA
533, 1979.)
10. An ordinance banning the shipment of all live fish and
lobster outside Puerto Princesa City From January 1, 1993 to
January 1, 1998 is valid. LGUs may enact police power measures
pursuant to the general welfare clause. (Tana u. Socrates, 278 SCRA
154, 1997.)
11. The MMDA which has no police and legislative powers,
has no power to enact ordinances for the general welfare of the
inhabitants of Metro Manila. It has no authority to order the opening

53

of Neptune Street, a private subdivision road in Makati City and
cause the demolition of it's (sic) perimeter walls. (Metropolitan
Manila Development Authority v. Bel-Air Village Association, Inc.,
328 SCRA 836, 2000.)
12. Since Congress has allowed the PCSO to operate lotteries
which PCSO seeks to conduct in Laguna, pursuant to its legislative
grant of authority, the province's Sangguniang Panlalawigan cannot
nullify the exercise of said authority by preventing something
already allowed by Congress.
LINA, JR. v. PANO
364 SCRA 76, August 30, 2001, Quisumbing, J.
Facts: On December 29, 1995, respondent Tony Calvento
was appointed agent by the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes
Office (PCSO) to install Terminal OM 20 for the operation of
lotto. He asked Mayor Calixto Cataquiz of San Pedro, Laguna.
for a mayor's permit to open the lotto outlet which was denied on
the ground that an ordinance was passed by the Sangguniang
Panlalawigan of Laguna entitled Kapasiyahan Big. 508, T.
1995 on September 18, 1995, which reads:
ISANG KAP ASIYAHAN TINUTUTULA N ANG
MGA "ILLEGAL GAMBLING" LAL O NA ANG LOTTO
SA LALA WIGAN NG LAGUNA."
Held: Petitioners contend that the assailed resolution
is a valid policy declaration of the Provincial Government
of Laguna of its vehement objection to the operation of lotto
and all forms of gambling. It is likewise a valid exercise of
the provincial government's police power under the General
Welfare Clause of Republic Act 7160.
According to the mayor, he based his decision on the
above-mentioned ordinance. The ordinance, however, merely
states the "objection of the council to the said game. It is but
a mere policy statement on the part of the local council, which
is not self-executing. Nor could it serve as a valid ground to
prohibit the operation of the lotto system in the province of
Laguna.
As a policy statement expressing the local government's
objection to the lotto, such resolution is valid. This is part of
the local government's autonomy to air its views which may be

r

64

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

contrary to that of the national government's. However, this
freedom to exercise contrary views does not mean that local
governments may actually enact ordinances that go against
laws duly enacted by Congress. Given this premise, the assailed
resolution in this case could not and should not be interpreted
as a measure or ordinance prohibiting the operation of lotto.
The game of lotto is a game of chance duly authorized
by the national government through an Act of Congress.
Republic Act 1169, as amended by Batas Pambansa Blg. 42, is
the law which grants a franchise to the PCSO and allows it to
operate the lotteries. In our system of government, the power
oflocal government units to legislate and enact ordinances and
resolutions is merely a delegated power coming from Congress.
As held in Tatel vs. Virac, 207 SCRA 157, ordinances should
not contravene an existing statute enacted by Congress.
13. The NTC, under E.O. No. 205, has exclusive jurisdiction
over matters affecting CATV operation, including specifically the
fixing of subscriber rates, but nothing herein precludes LG Us from
exercising its general power, under R.A. No. 7160, to prescribe
regulations to promote the health, morals, peace, education, good
order or safety, and general welfare of their constituents.
BATANGAS CATV, INC. v. COURT OF APPEALS
439 SCRA 326, September 29, 2004,
Sandoval-Gutierrez, J.
Facts: On July 28, 1986, respondent Batangas City
Sangguniang Panlungsod enacted Resolution No. 210 granting
petitioner a permit to construct, install, and operate a
Community Antenna Television (CATV) system in Batangas
City. Section 8 of the Resolution provides that petitioner
is authorized to charge its subscribers the maximum rates
specified therein, "provided, however, that any increase of
rates shall be subject to the approval of the Sangguniang
Panlungsod."
Sometime in November 1993, petitioner increased its
subscriber rates from P88.00 to P180.00 per month. As a result,
respondent Mayor wrote petitioner a letter threatening to
cancel its permit unless it secures the approval of respondent
Sangguniang Panlungsod, pursuant to Resolution No. 210.

Book I-- General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

65

Petitioner then filed with the RTC, Branch 7, Batangas
City, a petition for injunction. It alleged that respondent
Sangguniang Panlungsod has no authority to regulate the
subscriber rates charged by CATV operators because under
Executive Order No. 205, the National Telecommunications
Commission (NTC) has the sole authority to regulate the CATV
operation in the Philippines.
Ruling: Upon President Corazon C. Aquino's assumption
of power, she issued E.O. No. 205 opening the CATV industry
to all citizens of the Philippines. It mandated the NTC to grant
Certificates of Authority to CATV operators and to issue the
necessary implementing rules and regulations.
On September 9, 1997, President Fidel V. Ramos issued
E.O. No. 436 prescribing policy guidelines to govern CATV
operation in the Philippines. Cast in more definitive terms, it
restated the NTC's regulatory powers over CATV operations,
thus:
"SECTION 2. The regulation and supervision of the
cable television industry in the Philippines shall remain
vested solely with the National Telecommunications
Commission (NTC).
SECTION 3. Only persons, associations, partnerships,
corporations or cooperatives, granted a Provisional
Authority or Certificate of Authority by the Commission
may install, operate and maintain a cable television
system or render cable television service within a service
area."
Like any other enterprise, CATV operation may be
regulated by LGUs under the general welfare clause. This is
primarily because the CATV system commits the indiscretion
of crossing public properties. (It uses public properties in order
to reach subscribers.) The physical realities of constructing
CATV system-the use of public streets, rights of ways, the
founding of structures, and the parceling of large regionsallow an LGU a certain degree of regulation over CATV
operators. This is the same regulation that it exercises over all
private enterprises within its territory.
The apparent defect in Resolution No. 210 is that it
contravenes E.O. No. 205 and E.O. No. 436 insofar as it
permits respondent Sangguniang Panlungsod to usurp a

56

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

power exclusively vested in the NTC, i.e., the power to fix
the subscriber rates charged by CATV operators. As earlier
discussed, the fixing of subscriber rates is definitely one of the
matters within the NTC's exclusive domain.
We hold that the NTC, under E.O. No. 205, has exclusive
jurisdiction over matters affecting CATV operation, including
specifically the fixing of subscriber rates, but nothing herein
precludes LGUs from exercising its general power, under R.A.
No. 7160, to prescribe regulations to promote the health, morals,
peace, education, good order or safety, and general welfare of
their constituents. In effect, both laws become equally effective
and mutually complementary.

"(c) It shall not grant any third party any privilege
and/or concession to operate a bus, mini-bus and/or
jeepney terminal."
Ordinance No. 1778 is AN ORDINANCE REGULA TING
THE ENTRAN CE TO THE CITY OF LUCENA OF ALL
BUSES, MINI-BUSES AND OUT-OF-TOWN PASSENGER
JEEPNEYS which provides:
"(a) AII buses, mini-buses and out-of-town
passenger jeepneys shall be prohibited from entering
the city and are hereby directed to proceed to the
common terminal, for picking-up and/or dropping of their
passengers."

The petition is GRAN TED. The assailed CA Decision
and Resolution are hereby REVERSED. The RTC Decision is
AFFIRMED.

"(b) All temporary terminals in the City of Lucena
are hereby declared inoperable starting from the
effectivity of this ordinance."

14. The ordinances are characterized by overbreadth. They
go beyond what is reasonably necessary to solve the traffic problem.
Additionally, since the compulsory use of the terminal operated
by petitioner would subject the users thereof to fees, rentals and
charges, such measure is unduly oppressive.

Respondent, who had maintained a terminal within the
city, was one of those affected by the ordinances.

LUCENA GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL, INC.
v. JAC LINER, INC.
452 SCRA 174, February 23, 2005, Carpio-Morales, J.
Facts: Respondent, JAC Liner, Inc., a common carrier
operating buses which ply various routes to and from Lucena
City, assailed, via a petition for prohibition and injunction
against the City of Lucena, its Mayor, and the Sangguniang
Panlungsod of Lucena before the RTC of Lucena City, City
Ordinance Nos. 1631 and 1778 as unconstitutional on the
ground that, the same constituted an invalid exercise of police
power, an undue taking of private property, and a violation of
the constitutional prohibition against monopolies.
Ordinance No. 1631 is AN ORDINANCE GRAN TING
THE LUCENA GRAN D CENTRAL TERMINAL, INC., A
FRANCHISE TO CONSTRUCT, FINANCE, ESTABLISH,
OPERATE AND MAINTAIN A COMMON BUS-JEEPNEY
TERMINAL FACILITY IN THE CITY OF LUCENA which
provides:

Petitioner, Lucena Grand Central Terminal, Inc., claiming
legal interest as the grantee of the exclusive franchise for the
operation of the common terminal, was allowed to intervene in
the petition before the trial court.
Ruling: The ordinances assailed herein are characterized
by overbreadth. They go beyond what is reasonably necessary
to solve the traffic problem. Additionally, since the compulsory
use of the terminal operated by petitioner would subject the
users thereof to fees, rentals and charges, such measure is
unduly oppressive, as correctly found by the appellate court.
The Sangguniang Panlungsod had identified the cause
of traffic congestion to be the indiscriminate loading and
unloading of passengers by buses on the streets of the city
proper, hence, the conclusion that the terminals contributed to
the proliferation of buses obstructing traffic on the city streets.
Bus terminals per se do not, however, impede or help
impede the flow of traffic. How the outright proscription against
the existence of all terminals, apart from that franchised to
petitioner, can be considered as reasonably necessary to solve
the traffic problem, this Court has not been enlightened.
If terminals lack adequate space such that bus drivers are
compelled to load and unload passengers on the streets instead

68

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED
Book I- General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

of inside the terminals, then reasonable specifications for the
size of terminals could be instituted, with permits to operate the
same denied those which are unable to meet the specifications.
In the subject ordinances, however, the scope of the
proscription against the maintenance of terminals is so broad
that even entities which might be able to provide facilities
better than the franchised terminal are barred from operating
at all.
The petition is hereby DENIED.
15. Insofar as Section 5(f) of R.A. No. 7924 is understood by
the lower court and by the petitioner to grant the MMDA the power
to confiscate and suspend or revoke drivers' licenses without need of
any other legislative enactment, such is an unauthorized exercise of
police power.

METROPOLITAN MANILA DEVELOPMENT
AUTHORITY v. GARIN
456 SCRA 176, April 15, 2005, Chico-Nazario, J.
Facts: Respondent Dante 0. Garin, a lawyer, was
issued a traffic violation receipt (TVR) and his driver's license
confiscated for parking illegally along Gandara Street, Binondo,
Manila, on 05 August 1995. The following statements were
printed on the TVR :
"You are hereby directed to report to the MMDA
Traffic Operations Center Port Area Manila after 48 hours
from date of apprehension for disposition/appropriate
action thereon. Criminal case shall be filed for failure to
redeem license after 30 days.
Valid as temporary DRIVER'S license for seven days from
date of apprehension."
Garin filed the original complaint with application for
preliminary injunction in the RTC of Paranaque. On 14 August
1997, the trial court rendered the assailed decision in favor of
the herein respondent and held:
'WHEREFORE, the temporary writ of preliminary
injunction is hereby made permanent; th(e) MMDA is
directed to return to plaintiff his driver's license; th(e)
MMDA is likewise ordered to desist from confiscating

69

driver's license without first giving the driver the
opportunity to be heard in an appropriate proceeding."

Ruling: In Metro Manila Development Authority u.
Bel-Air Village Association, Inc., 328 SCRA 836 (2000), we
categorically stated that Rep. Act No. 7924 does not grant the
MMDA with police power, let alone legislative power, and that
all its functions are administrative in nature.
The said case also involved the herein petitioner MM DA
which claimed that it had the authority to open a subdivision
street owned by the Bel-Air Village Association, Inc. to public
traffic because it is an agent of the state endowed with police
power in the delivery of basic services in Metro Manila. From
this premise, the MMDA argued that there was no need for the
City of Makati to enact an ordinance opening Neptune Street
to the public.
Tracing the legislative history of R.A. No. 7924
creating the MMD A, we concluded that the MM DA is not a
local government unit or a public corporation endowed with
legislative power, and, unlike its predecessor, the Metro Manila
Commission, it has no power to enact ordinances for the welfare
of the community. Thus, in the absence of an ordinance from
the City of Maka ti, its own order to open the street was invalid.
With the passage of R.A. No. 7924 in 1995, Metropolitan
Manila was declared as a "special development and
administrative region" and the administration of "metro-wide"
basic services affecting the region placed under "a development
authority" referred to as the MMDA. Thus:
" ... ff]he powers of the MM DA are limited to the
following acts: formulation, coordination, regulation,
implementation, preparation, management, monitoring,
setting of policies, installation of a system and
administration. There is no syllable in R.A. 7924 that
grants the MMDA police power, let alone legislative
power.x xx
Insofar as Sec. 5(1) of R.A. No. 7924 is understood by the
lower court and by the petitioner to grant the MM DA the power
to confiscate and suspend or revoke drivers' licenses without
need ofany other legislative enactment, such is an unauthorized
exercise of police power.
The petition is dismissed.

16. Respondent municipality failed to comply with the due
process clause when it passed Resolution No. 50. While it maintained
that the gasoline filling station of petitioner was less than 100 meters
from the nearest public school and church, the records do not show
that it even attempted to measure the distance, notwithstanding
that such distance was crucial in determining whether there was an
actual violation of Section 44.

PARAYNOv.JOVELLANOS
495 SCRA 85, July 14, 2006, Corona, J.
Facts: Petitioner Concepcion Parayno was the owner of a
gasoline filling station in Calasiao, Pangasinan. In 1989, some
residents of Calasiao petitioned the Sangguniang Bayan (SB)
of said municipality for the closure or transfer of the station
to another location. The matter was referred to the Municipal
Engineer, et al., for investigation. Upon their advise, the
Sangguniang Bayan recommended to the Mayor the closure or
transfer of location of petitioner's gasoline station.
Ruling: We hold that the zoning ordinance of respondent
municipality made a clear distinction between "gasoline service
station" and "gasoline filling station." The pertinent provisions
read:

Section 21. Filling Station. A retail station

a.

b.

It is evident from the foregoing that the ordinance
intended these two terms to be separate and distinct from each
other.

Because of the distinct and definite meanings alluded
to the two terms by the zoning ordinance, respondents could
not insist that "gasoline service station" under Section 44
necessarily included "gasoline filling station" under Section 21.
Indeed, the activities undertaken in a "gas service station" did
not automatically embrace those in a "gas filling station."
Respondent municipality invalidly used its police powers
in ordering the closure/transfer of petitioner's gasoline station.
While it had, under R.A. No. 7160, the power to take actions
and enact measures to promote the health and general welfare
of its constituents, it should have given due deference to the
law and the rights of petitioner.
A local government is considered to have properly exercised
its police powers only when the following requisites are met:
(1) the interests of the public generally, as distinguished from
those of a particular class, require the interference of the State
and (2) the means employed are reasonably necessary for the
attainment of the object sought to be accomplished and not
unduly oppressive. The first requirement refers to the equal
protection clause and the second, to the due process clause of
the Constitution.
Respondent municipality failed to comply with the due
process clause when it passed Resolution No. 50. While it
maintained that the gasoline filling station of petitioner was
less than 100 meters from the nearest public school and church,
the records do not show that it even attempted to measure the
distance, notwithstanding that such distance was crucial in
determining whether there was an actual violation of Section
44. The different local offices that respondent municipality
tapped to conduct an investigation never conducted such
measurement either.
Moreover, petitioner's business could not be considered
a nuisance which respondent municipality could summarily
abate in the guise of exercising its police powers. The abatement
of a nuisance without judicial proceedings is possible only if it
is a nuisance per se. A gas station is not a nuisance per se or one
affecting the immediate safety of persons and property, hence,
it cannot be closed down or transferred summarily to another
location.
The petition is hereby GRANT ED. The CA resolution
is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Respondent Municipality of

Resolution No. 50 against petitioner insofar as it seeks to close
down or transfer her gasoline station to another location.

FERRER v. BAUTISTA
760 SCRA 652, June 30, 2015, Peralta, J.

Facts: On October 17, 2011 respondent Quezon City
Council enacted Ordinance No. SP-2095, S-2011, or the
Socialized Housing Tax of Quezon City, Section 3 of which
provides:
SECTION 3. IMP OSITION. A special assessment
equivalent to one-half percent (0.5%) on the assessed
value of land in excess of One Hundred Thousand Pesos
(Php 100,000.00) shall be collected by the City Treasurer
which shall accrue to the Socialized Housing Programs
of the Quezon City Government. The special assessment
shall accrue to the General Fund under a special account
to be established for the purpose (sic).
Effective for five (5) years, the Socialized Housing Tax
(SHT) (sic) shall be utilized by the Quezon City Government
for the following projects: (a) land purchase/land banking; (b)
improvement of current/existing socialized housing facilities;
(c) land development; (d) construction of core houses, sanitary
cores, medium-rise buildings and other similar structures; and
(e) financing of public-private partners hip agreement of the
Quezon City Government and National Housing Authority
(NHA) (sic) with the private sector.
On the other hand, Ordinance No. SP-2235, S-2013 was
enacted on December 16, 2013 and took effect ten days after
when it was approved by respondent City Mayor. The proceeds
collected from the garbage fees on residential properties shall
be deposited solely and exclusively in an earmarked special

Book I General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

63

account under the general fund to be utilized for garbage
collections.

Ruling: Ordinance No. SP.-2095 imposes a Socialized
Housing Tax equivalent to 0.5% on the assessed value of land
in excess of Php 100,000.00. This special assessment is the same
tax referred to in R.A. No. 7279 or the Urban Development and
Housing Act (UDHA). The SHT is one of the sources of funds
for urban development and housing program. Section 43 of the
law provides:
Sec. 43. Socialized Housing Tax[ ].- Consistent
with the constitutional principle that the ownership
and enjoyment of property bear a social function and to
raise funds for the Program, all local government units
are hereby authorized to impose an additional one-half
percent (0.5%) tax on the assessed value of all lands in
urban areas in excess of Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000.00).
In this case, petitioner argues that the SHT is a penalty
imposed on real property owners because it burdens them with
expenses to provide funds for the housing of informal settlers,
and that it is a class legislation since it favors the latter who
occupy properties which is not their own and pay no taxes.
An ordinance based on reasonable classification does not
violate the constitutional guaranty of the equal protection of the
law. The requirements for a valid and reasonable classification
are: (1) it must rest on substantial distinctions; (2) it must be
germane to the purpose of the law; (3) it must not be limited
to existing conditions only; and (4) it must apply equally to all
members of the same class.
For the purpose of undertaking a comprehensive and
continuing urban development and housing program, the
disparities between a real property owner and an informal
settler as two distinct classes are too obvious and need not
be discussed at length. The differentiation conforms to the
practical dictates ofjustice and equity and is not discriminatory
within the meaning of the Constitution. Notably, the public
purpose of a tax may legally exist even if the motive which
impelled the legislature to impose the tax was to favor one over
another. It is inherent in the power to tax that a State is free
to select the subjects of taxation. Inequities which result from

64

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

a singling out of one particular class for taxation or exemption
infringe no constitutional limitation.
Further, the reasonableness of Ordinance No. SP-2095
cannot be disputed. It is not confiscatory or oppressive since the
tax being imposed therein is below what the UDHA actually
allows. As pointed out by respondents, while the law authorizes
LGUs to collect SHT on lands with an assessed value of more
than P50,000.00, the questioned ordinance only covers lands
with an assessed value exceeding P100,000.00. Even better, on
certain conditions, the ordinance grants a tax credit equivalent
to the total amount of the special assessment paid beginning in
the sixth (6th) year of its effectivity. Far from being obnoxious,
the provisions of the subject ordinance are fair and just.
In Ordinance No. SP.-2235, S-2013, the rates of the
imposable fee depend on land or floor area and whether the
payee is an occupant of a lot, condominium, social housing
project or apartment.
For the purpose of garbage collection, there is, in fact, no
substantial distinction between an occupant of a lot, on one
hand, and an occupant of a unit in a condominium, socialized
housing project or apartment, on the other hand. Most likely,
garbage output produced by these types of occupants is uniform
and does not vary to a large degree; thus, a similar schedule of
fee is both just and equitable.
The rates being charged by the ordinance are unjust and
inequitable: a resident of a 200 sq. m. unit in a condominium
or socialized housing project has to pay twice the amount than
a resident of a lot similar in size; unlike unit occupants, all
occupants of a lot with an area of 200 sq. m. and less have to
pay a fixed rate of Phpl00.00; and the same amount of garbage
fee is imposed regardless of whether the resident is from a
condominium or from a socialized housing project.
Indeed, the classifications under Ordinance No. S-2235
are not germane to its declared purpose of "promoting
shared responsibility with the residents to attack their
common mindless attitude in over-consuming the present
resources and in generating waste." Instead of simplistically
categorizing the payee into land or floor occupant of a lot or
unit of a condominium, socialized housing project or apartment,
respondent City Council should have considered factors that

Book I General Provisions
Title One - Basic Principles

65

could truly measure the amount of wastes generated and
the appropriate fee for its collection. Factors include, among
others, household age and size, accessibility to waste collection,
population density of the barangay or district, capacity to pay,
and actual occupancy of the property.
The petition is PARTIALLY GRANT ED. The
constitutionality and legality of Ordinance No. SP-2095,S-2011,
or the "Socialized Housing Tax of Quezon City," is SUSTAINED
for being consistent with Section 43 of Republic Act No. 7279.
On the other hand, Ordinance No. SP-2235, S-2013, which
collects an annual garbage fee on all domestic households in
Quezon City, is hereby declared as UNCONSTITUTIONAL
AND ILLEGAL. Respondents are DIRECTED to REFUND
with reasonable dispatch the sums of money collected relative
to its enforcement.
18. Section 5 of Ordinance No. 0309.-07 is an invalid
provision because the compulsion thereunder to abandon aerial
spraying within an impracticable period of "three (3) months after
the effectivity of this Ordinance" is unreasonable, oppressive and
impossible to comply with. The total ban on aerial spraying runs
afoul with the equal protection clause because it does not classify
which substances are prohibited from being applied aerially even
as reasonable distinctions should be made in terms of the hazards,
safety or beneficial effects of liquid substances to the public health,
livelihood and the environment.

MOSQUEDA v. PILIPINO BANANA GROWERS &
EXPORTERS ASSOCIATION, INC.
800 SCRA 313, August 16, 2016, Bersamin, J.
Facts: After several committee hearings and consultations
with various stakeholders, the Sangguniang Panlungsod of
Davao City enacted Ordinance No. 0309, Series of 2007, to
impose a ban against aerial spraying as an agricultural practice
by all agricultural entities within Davao City.
SECTION 4. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY - The
provisions of this Ordinance shall apply to all agricultural
entities within the territorial jurisdiction of Davao City;
SECTION 5. BAN OF AERIAL SPRAYING - A ban on
aerial spraying shall be strictly enforced in the territorial

66

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

jurisdiction of Davao City three (3) months after the effectivity
of this Ordinance.
SECTION 6. BUFFER ZONE - Consistent with national
legislation and government regulations, all agricultural
entities must provide for a thirty (30) meter buffer zone
within the boundaries of their agricultural farms/plantations.
This buffer zone must be properly identified through Global
Positioning System (GPS) survey. A survey plan showing the
metes and bounds of each agricultural farm/plantation must
be submitted to the City Mayor's Office, with the buffer zone
clearly identified therein;
The ordinance provides for imprisonment and fines for its
violation.
Ruling: The General Welfare Clause in Section 16 of the
Local Government Code embodies the legislative grant that
enables the local government unit to effectively accomplish and
carry out the declared objects of its creation, and to promote
and maintain local autonomy.
Section 458 of the Local Government Code explicitly
vests the local government unit with the authority to enact
legislation aimed at promoting the general welfare.
The impossibility of carrying out a shift to another mode
of pesticide application within three months can readily be
appreciated given the vast area of the affected plantations and
the corresponding resources required therefor.
This Court, therefore, finds Section 5 of Ordinance No.
0309-07 an invalid provision because the compulsion thereunder
to abandon aerial spraying within an impracticable period of
"three (3) months after the effectivity of this Ordinance" is
"unreasonable, oppressive and impossible to comply with."
The required civil works for the conversion to truckmounted boom spraying alone will consume considerable time
and financial resources given the topography and geographical
features of the plantations.
A serious challenge being posed against Ordinance
No. 0309-07 rests on its supposed collision with the Equal
Protection Clause.

Book I - General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

67

We are, therefore, convinced that the total ban on aerial
spraying runs afoul with the equal protection clause because
it does not classify which substances are prohibited from
being applied aerially even as reasonable distinctions should
be made in terms of the hazards, safety or beneficial effects
of liquid substances to the public health, livelihood and the
environment.
The allegation that aerial spraying is hazardous to animal
and human being remains an allegation and assumptions until
otherwise scientifically proven by concerned authorities and
agencies.
We should not apply the precautionary approach (a social
planning principle originating from Germany) in sustaining
the ban against aerial spraying if little or nothing is known of
the exact or potential dangers that aerial spraying may bring to
the health of the residents within and near the plantations and
to the integrity and balance of the environment. It is dangerous
to quickly presume that the effects of aerial spraying would be
adverse even in the absence of evidence. Accordingly, for lack of
scientific data supporting a ban on aerial spraying, Ordinance
No. 0309-07 should be struck down for being unreasonable.
The function of pesticides control, regulation and
development is within the jurisdiction of the FPA under
Presidential Decree No. 1144. The FPA was established in
recognition of the need for a technically oriented government
entity that will protect the public from the risks inherent in the
use of pesticides.
The enumerated devolved functions to the local government
units do not include the regulation and control of pesticides
and other agricultural chemicals. Moreover, Ordinance No.
0309.07 proposes to prohibit an activity already covered by the
jurisdiction of the FPA, which has issued its own regulations
under its Memorandum Circular No. 02, Series of 2009,
entitled Good Agricultural Practices for Aerial Spraying of
Fungicide in Banana Plantations. While Ordinance No. 030907 prohibits aerial spraying in banana plantations within the
City of Davao, Memorandum Circular No. 02 seeks to regulate
the conduct of aerial spraying in banana plantations pursuant
to Section 6, Presidential Decree No. 1144, and in conformity
with the standard of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).

68

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Ordinance No. 0309-07 contravenes the specific regulatory
policy on aerial spraying in banana plantations on a nationwide
scale of the National Government, through the FPA.
The Court DENIES the consolidated petitions for review
on certiorari for their lack of merit; AFFIRMS the CA decision
declaring Ordinance No. 0309-07 UNCONSTITUTIONAL;
PERMAN ENTLY ENJOINS respondent City of Davao, and all
persons or entities acting in its behalf or under its authority,

19. The Ordinance mandates all heavy industries operating
along Batangas Bay to use seawater in the operation of their
respective facilities, and install desalination plants for this purpose.
This contravenes the provisions of the Water Code as it arrogates
unto Batangas City the power to control and regulate the use of
ground water which, by virtue of the provisions of the Water Code,
pertains solely to the NWRB. Batangas City acted in excess of the
powers granted to it as an LGU, rendering the Assailed Ordinance
ultra vires.

CITY OF BATANGAS v. PHILIPPINE SHELL
PETROLEUM CORPORATION
826 SCRA 297, June 7, 2017, Caguioa, J.
Facts: Philippine Shell Petroleum Corporation (PSPC) is
a duly organized Philippine corporation engaged in the business
of manufacturing, refining and distribution of petroleum
products. PSPC owns and operates a refinery situated in
Tabangao, Batangas City. (sic)
On May 28, 2001, the Sangguniang Panlungsod of
Batangas City enacted the Assailed Ordinance which requires
heavy industries operating along the portions of Batangas Bay
within the territorial jurisdiction of Batangas City to construct
desalination plants to facilitate the use of seawater as coolant
for their industrial facilities.
Heavy industries subject of the Assailed Ordinance had
until May 28, 2006 to comply with its provisions. Among
the facilities affected by the Assailed Ordinance is PSPC's
Tabangao Refinery.

Ruling: The Water Code governs the ownership,
appropriation, utilization, exploitation, development, conservation
and protection of water resources. Under Article 3 thereof,

Book I- General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

69

water resources are placed under the control and regulation
of the government through the National Water Resources
Council, now the NWR B. In turn, the privilege to appropriate
and use water is one which is exclusively granted and regulated
by the State through water permits issued by the NWRB. Once
granted, these water permits continue to be valid save only for
reasons spelled out under the Water Code itself.
Conversely, the power to modify, suspend, cancel, or
revoke water permits already issued also rests with NWR B.
The avowed purpose of the Assailed Ordinance, is the
protection of local aquifers for the benefit of the inhabitants
of Batangas City. Failure to comply with the Ordinance would
have the effect of precluding continuous operation, and exposing
noncompliant parties to penal and administrative sanctions.
The Assailed Ordinance effectively contravenes the
provisions of the Water Code as it arrogates unto Batangas
City the power to control and regulate the use of ground water
which, by virtue of the provisions of the Water Code, pertains
solely to the NWR B. By enacting the Assailed Ordinance,
Batangas City acted in excess of the powers granted to it as an
LGU, rendering the Assailed Ordinance ultra vires and is null
and void.
It bears emphasizing that the measure of the substantive
validity of an ordinance is the underlying factual basis for which
it was enacted. Hence, without factual basis, an ordinance will
necessarily fail the substantive test for validity.
It would have been acceptable had there been a specific
study or findings that the local government conducted (sic) and
not just its reliance on the complaints of some constituents
who merely made its conclusion that the drying up of wells
or its salination was due to the "heavy industries" use of
groundwater.
The presumption of validity ascribed to the Assailed
Ordinance had been overturned by documentary and
testimonial evidence showing that no substantial diminution
in the supply of ground water in the Tabangao-Malitam
watershed had occurred in the last three (3) decades, and that
no threat of depletion of ground water resources in sai (sic)
watershed existed.
The petition for review on certiorari is DENIED.

LEAGUE OF PROVINCES OF THE PHILIPPINES v.
DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT
and NATURAL RESOURCES
696 SCRA 190, April 11, 2013, Peralta, J.
Facts: On March 28, 1996, Golden Falcon Mineral
Exploration Corporation (Golden Falcon) filed with the DENR
Mines and Geosciences Bureau Regional Office No. III (MGB
R-IID) an Application for Financial and Technical Assistance
Agreement (FTAA) covering an area of 61,136 hectares situated
in the Municipalities of San Miguel, San Ildefonso, Norzagaray
and San Jose del Monte, Bulacan.On February 10, 2004, while Golden Falcon's appeal was
pending, Eduardo D. Mercado, et al. filed with the Provincial
Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) of
Bulacan their respective Applications for Quarry Permit
(AQP), which covered the same area subject of Golden Falcon's
Application for Financial and Technical Assistance Agreement.
On August 10, 2005, Governor Dela Cruz upon the
Provincial Mining Regulatory Board (PMRB) endorsement
issued the corresponding Small-Scale Mining Permits in favor
of Eduardo D. Mercado, Benedicto S. Cruz, Gerardo R. Cruz
and Lucila S. Valdez.
Ruling: The Local Government Code (Sec. 17) did not
fully devolve the enforcement of the small-scale mining law
to the provincial government, as its enforcement is subject to
the supervision, control and review of the DENR, which is in
charge, subject to law and higher authority, of carrying out the
State's constitutional mandate to control and supervise the
exploration, development, utilization of the country's natural
resources.
Section 17 (b)(3)(iii) of the Local Government Code of
1991 is in harmony with R.A. No. 7076 or the People's SmallScale Mining Act of 1991, which established a People's SmallScale Mining Program to be implemented by the Secretary
of the DENR (Sec. 4) and created the Provincial/City Mining
Regulatory Board under the direct supervision and control of
the Secretary (Sec. 24).

76

The decision of the DENR Secretary, declaring that the
Application for Exploration Permit of AMTC was valid and
may be given due course, and canceling the Small-Scale Mining
Permits issued by the Provincial Governor, emanated from the
power of review granted to the DENR Secretary under R.A.
No. 7076 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations. The
DENR Secretary's power to review and, therefore, decide,
in this case, the issue on the validity of the issuance of the
Small-Scale Mining Permits by the Provincial Governor as
recommended by the PMRB, is a quasi-judicial function, which
involves the determination of what the law is, and what the
legal rights of the contending parties are, with respect to the
matter in controversy and, on the basis thereof and the facts
obtaining, the adjudication of their respective rights. The
DENR Secretary exercises quasi-judicial function under R.A.
No. 7076 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations to the
extent necessary in settling disputes, conflicts or litigations
over conflicting claims.
In this case, the Court finds that the grounds raised by
petitioner to challenge the constitutionality of Section 17 (b)
(3)(iii) of the Local Government Code of 1991 and Section 24
of R.A. No, 7076 failed to overcome the constitutionality of the
said provisions of law.

facilities enumerated in this Section within six (6)
months after the effectivity of this Code. As used in
this Code, the term "devolution" refers to the act by
which the National Government confers power and
authority upon the various local government units
to perform specific functions and responsibilities.
() The National Government or the next
higher level of local government unit may provide
or augment the basic services and facilities assigned
to a lower level of local government unit when
such services or facilities are not made available
or, if made available, are inadequate to meet the
requirements of its inhabitants.
(g) The basic services and facilities herein
above enumerated shall be funded from the
share of local government units in the proceeds
of national taxes and other local revenues and
funding support from the National Government,
its instrumentalities and government-owned or
controlled corporations which are tasked by law to
establish and maintain such services or facilities.

Book I- General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

Any fund or resource available for the use of local
government units shall be first allocated for the
provision of basic services or facilities enumerated
in subsection (b) hereof before applying the same
for other purposes, unless otherwise provided in
this Code.
(h) Regional offices of national agencies
or offices whose functions are devolved to local
government units as provided herein shall be
phased out within one (1) year from the approval
of this Code. Said national agencies and offices
may establish such field units as may be necessary
for monitoring purposes and providing technical
assistance to local government units. The
properties, equipment, and other assets of these
regional offices shall be distributed to the local
government units in the region in accordance with
the rules and regulations issued by the Oversight
Committee created under this Code.
The devolution contemplated in this Code
shall include the transfer to local government
units of the records, equipment, and other assets
and personnel of national agencies and offices
corresponding to the devolved powers, functions,
and responsibilities.
(i)

Personnel of said national agencies or offices
shall be absorbed by the local government units
to which they belong or in whose areas they are
assigned to the extent that it is administratively
viable as determined by the said oversight
committee: Provided, That the rights accorded to
such personnel pursuant to civil service law, rules
and regulations shall not be impaired; Provided,
further, that regional directors who are career
executive service officers and other officers of
similar rank in the said regional offices who cannot
be absorbed by the local government unit shall be
retained by the National Government, without any
diminution of rank, salary or tenure.
(j) To ensure the active participation of the
private sector in local governance, local government

79

units may, by ordinance, sell, lease, encumber, or
otherwise dispose of public economic enterprises
owned by them in their proprietary capacity.
Costs may also be charged for the delivery
of basic services or facilities enumerated in this
Section.
A.

Decided Cases

1.
Mayor Plaza is empowered to issue E.O. 06-92 in order
to give effect to the devolution decreed by the Local Government
Code. He has the authority to reappoint devolved personnel and
may designate an employee to take charge of a department until the
appointment of a regular head, as was done by the Mayor here. The
dropping from the rolls of private respondents is not disciplinary in
nature. Thus, their assertion that they were denied due process is
untenable. Since the dropping from the rolls is not an administrative
sanction, they need not be notified or be heard.

PLAZA v. CASSION
435 SCRA 294, July 27, 2004, Sandoval-Gutierrez, J.
Facts: Before the passage of Republic Act No. 7160,
the task of delivering basic social services was dispensed by
the national government through the Department of Social
Welfare and Development (DSWD). Upon the promulgation
and implementation of the Local Government Code, some
of the functions of the DSWD were transferred to the local
government units.
The City of Butuan, through its Sangguniang Panglungsod
(Sanggunian) passed SP Resolution 427-92 entitled ''Resolution
Authorizing the City Mayor, Honorable Democrito D. Plaza II,
to Sign the Memorandum of Agreement for the Devolution of
the DSWD to the City of Butuan."
Pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
entered into between the City of Butuan, through then Mayor
Democrito Plaza II, petitioner, and the DSWD, the latter's
services, personnel, assets and liabilities, and technical support
systems were transferred to its city counterpart.
By virtue of the same MOA, Mayor Plaza issued Executive
Order (EO) No. 06-92 dated October 5, 1992 reconstituting the
City Social Services Development Of6ce (CSSDO), devolving

80

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

or adding thereto 19 national DSWD employees headed by
petitioner Virginia Tuazon, Social Welfare Officer V. Mayor
Plaza designated her Officer-in-Charge of the reconstituted
CSSDO. Its office was transferred from the original CSSDO
building to the DSWD building.
The CSSDO was originally composed of herein
respondents, headed by Carolina M. Cassion, Social Welfare
Officer IV. Aggrieved by such development, they refused to
recognize petitioner Tuazon as their new head and to report
at the DSWD building. They contended that the issuance of
EO No. 06-92 by Mayor Plaza and the designation of petitioner
Tuazon as Officer-in-charge of the CSSDO are illegal.
Despite Mayor Plaza's series of orders to respondents to
report for work at the DSWD building, they failed to do so.
They were dropped from the rolls.

Ruling: Mayor Plaza is empowered to issue EO No. 0692 in order to give effect to the devolution decreed by the Local
Government Code. As the local chief executive of Butuan City,
Mayor Plaza has the authority to reappoint devolved personnel
and may designate an employee to take charge of a department
until the appointment of a regular head, as was done by the
Mayor here.
The Court Appeals erred in ruling that EO No. 0692 violated respondents' security of tenure as they were
transferred to another office without their consent. There was
no such transfer. Transfer is a movement from one position to
another which is of equivalent rank, level or salary without
break in service and may be imposed as an administrative
penalty. The change of respondents' place of work from the
original CSSDO office to the DSWD building is not a transfer.
It was only a physical transfer of their office to a new one done
in the interest of public service. There were no new movements
or appointments from one position to another.
Private respondents argue that they were denied due
process when they were dropped from the rolls.
CSC Memorandum Circular No. 38, Series of 1993,
provides:
"VI. Requirements For Certain Mode of Separation.
XXX

Book I - General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

81

Officers and employees who are absent for at least
thirty (30) days without approved leave are considered
on Absence Without Leave (AWOL) and may be dropped
from the service without prior notice.
A notice or order of the dropping from the rolls of
an employee shall be issued by the appointing authority
and submitted to the CSC office concerned for record
purposes."
Pursuant to the above provisions and as ruled by the
CSC, the dropping from the rolls of private respondents is not
disciplinary in nature. Thus, their assertion that they were
denied due process is untenable. Since the dropping from
the rolls is not an administrative sanction, they need not be
notified or be heard.
The CA Decision dated February 14, 1996 is REVERSED.
2.
Social welfare and development projects, which include
the grant of loan assistance as part of a livelihood program,
undertaken by the LGUs are covered by the prohibition against the
release, clisbursement, and expenditure of public funds during the
election ban period.
VELEZ v. PEOPLE
G.R. No. 215136, August 28, 2019, Reyes, J. Jr., J.
Facts: In three Informations, Edwin D. Velez, then
Mayor of Silay City, was charged with violation of Section
261(v)(2) of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC) for releasing
loan proceeds to three organizations for the implementation
of the city's livelihood development program within 45 days
before the 1998 elections. Also charged were Eli G. Alminaza,
former City Accountant, Arturo J. Siason, former acting City
Treasurer and Salvador G. Ascalon, Jr., former City Budget
Officer.

Ruling: It is undisputed that petitioner, in his
capacity as Mayor of Silay City, entered into memoranda
of agreement on April 8, 1998, and April 22, 1998, with the
authorized representatives of Hacienda Guinsang-an II Credit
Cooperative, Barangay E. Lopez Credit Cooperative, and
Silay City Consolidated Union of Market Vendors Association,
Inc., for the grant of loans to be used for the implementation

82

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

of the city's livelihood projects. Thereafter, he signed the
disbursement vouchers on April 12, 1998 (29 days before the
May 11, 1998 elections), April 13, 1998 (28 days before said
elections), and April 23, 1998 (18 days before the elections), to
process the release of the loan in the amounts of P50,000.00
each to the two credit cooperatives and P300,000.00 to the
market vendors' association.
Petitioner's approval and signature are vital to the release
and disbursement of government funds without which the
loan proceeds could not have been issued. Clearly, petitioner
facilitated the release and disbursement of public funds as
livelihood loan assistance to the 3 organizations during the
45-day election ban period.
Petitioner, however, insists that the LGUs are not barred
from releasing, disbursing and expending public funds because
the proscription under Section 26l(v)(2) applies only to the
"Ministry of Social Services and Development and any other
ministries of the government performing functions similar to
said ministry." He claims that what the law prohibits is the
release, disbursement and expenditure of public funds by the
DSWD and other government agencies that also provide social
welfare services.
It also bears stressing that while the DSWD is the
lead national government agency mandated to provide
comprehensive social welfare programs, the LGUs act as its
frontline service providers pursuant to the devolution of powers
under Section 17 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7160, otherwise
known as the Local Government Code of 1991.
RA. No. 7160 defines devolution as the act by which the
national government confers power and authority upon LGUs
to perform specific functions and responsibilities. It includes the
transfer to LG Us of the records, equipment, and other assets
and personnel of national agencies and offices corresponding to
the devolved powers, functions, and responsibilities.
Indubitably, social welfare and development projects,
which include the grant of loan assistance as part of a
livelihood program, undertaken by the LG Us are covered by the
prohibition against the release, disbursement and expenditure
of public funds during the election ban period.

The petition is DENIED. The Decision and the Resolution
of the Court of Appeals-Cebu City affirming the RTC decision
finding the petitioners guilty with 2 years imprisonment,
perpetual disqualification from public office and deprivation of
the right of suffrage are AFFIRMED.
SEC. 18. Power to Generate and Apply Resources.
Local government units shall have the power
and authority to establish an organization that
shall be responsible for the efficient and effective
implementation of their development plans,
program objectives and priorities; to create their
own sources of revenue and to levy taxes, fees and
charges which shall accrue exclusively for their
use and disposition and which shall be retained
by them; to have a just share in national taxes
which shall be automatically and directly released
to them without need of any further action; to
have an equitable share in the proceeds from the
utilization and development of the national wealth
and resources within their respective territorial
jurisdictions including sharing the same with the
inhabitants by way of direct benefits; to acquire,
develop, lease, encumber, alienate, or otherwise
dispose of real or personal property held by them
in their proprietary capacity and to apply their
resources and assets for productive, developmental,
or welfare purposes, in the exercise or furtherance
of their governmental or proprietary powers and
functions and thereby ensure their development
into
self-reliant
comm unities
and
active
participants in the attainment of national goals.
SEC. 19. Eminent Domain.
A local
government unit may, through its chief executive
and acting pursuant to an ordinance, exercise
the power of eminent domain for public use, or
purpose, or welfare for the benefit of the poor and
the landless, upon payment of just compensation,
pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution and
pertinent laws: Provided, however, That the power
of eminent domain may not be exercised unless a
valid and definite offer has been previously made

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

84

to the owner, and such offer was not accepted:
Provided, further, That the local government unit
may immediately take possession of the property
upon the filing of the expropriation proceedings
and upon making a deposit with the proper court
of at least fifteen percent (15%) of the fair market
value of the property based on the current tax
declaration of the property to be expropriated:
Provided, finally, That the amount to be paid for
the expropriated property shall be determined by
the proper court, based on the fair market value at
the time of the taking of the property.
A.

Comment

This is an express grant of the power of eminent domain to
local governments.

B.

Decided Cases

1.
The assessed value of a property cannot be made the sole
basis of just compensation since it constitutes only a percentage of
its current fair market value. (Municipality of Daet v. CA, 93 SCRA
503, 1979.)
2.
The Sangguniang Panlalawigan is without authority to
disapprove a municipal resolution authorizing the mayor to initiate
expropriation proceedings since a municipality has the power to
exercise the right of eminent domain. (Moday v. CA, 268 SCRA 586,
1997.)

3. The power of eminent domain by LGUs may be effected
only by ordinance not by a mere resolution. This is one of the four
essential requisites before the LGU can exercise the power of
eminent domain.
MUNICIPALITY OF PARANAQUE v.
V.M. REALTY CORPORATION
292 SCRA 678, July 20, 1998, Panganiban, J.
Facts: Pursuant to Sangguniang Bayan Resolution
No. 93-95, the Municipality of Paranaque fled a Complaint
for expropriation against Private Respondent V.M. Realty
Corporation, over two parcels of land located at Wakas, San
Dionisio, Paranaque, Metro Manila. Allegedly, the complaint
was fled "for the purpose of alleviating the living conditions

Book I- General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

85

of the underprivileged by providing homes for the homeless
through a socialized housing project."
The RTC of Makati, issued an Order giving it due course.
Acting on petitioner's motion said court issued an Order,
authorizing petitioner to take possession of the subject property
upon deposit with its clerk of court of an amount equivalent to
15 percent of its fair market value based on its current tax
declaration.
Private respondent filed its Answer containing affirmative
defenses and a counterclaim, alleging in the main that the
complaint failed to state a cause of action because it was filed
pursuant to a resolution and not to an ordinance as required
by RA 7160.

Held: The following essential requisites must concur
before an LGU can exercise the power of eminent domain:
1.
An ordinance is enacted by the local legislative
council authorizing the local chief executive, in behalf
of the LGU, to exercise the power of eminent domain
or pursue expropriation proceedings over a particular
private property.
2.
The power of eminent domain is exercised for
public use, purpose or welfare, or for the benefit of the
poor and the landless.
3.
There is payment of just compensation, as
required under Section 9, Article III of the Constitution,
and other pertinent laws.
4.
A valid and definite offer has been previously
made to the owner of the property sought to be
expropriated, but said offer was not accepted.
In the case at bar, the local chief executive sought to
exercise the power of eminent domain pursuant to a resolution
of the municipal council. Thus, there was no compliance with
the first requisite that the mayor be authorized through an
ordinance.
We are not convinced by petitioner's insistence that
the terms "resolution" and "ordinance" are synonymous.
A municipal ordinance is different from a resolution. An
ordinance is a law, but a resolution is merely a declaration of the

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

86

sentiment or opinion of a lawmaking body on a specific matter.

An ordinance possesses a general and permanent character,
but a resolution is temporary in nature. Additionally, the two
are enacted differently
a third reading is necessary for an
ordinance, but not for a resolution, unless decided otherwise by
a majority of all the Sanggunian members.
WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED without
prejudice to petitioner's proper exercise of its power of eminent
domain over subject property.
4.
Proper party to appeal the dismissal of expropriation
proceedings is the municipality which filed the expropriation case.
The petitioner barangay, which is a different political entity by
itself cannot continue the expropriation case. (Barangay Matictic v.

Elbinias, 148 SCRA 83, 1987.)
5.
Neither the Local Government Code nor the
Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law requires a local government
unit to secure approval of the Department of Agrarian Reform as
a condition precedent to institute the necessary expropriation
proceedings. (Province of Camarines Sur v. CA, 222 SCRA 173,

1993.)
6.
Section 19 of R.A. 7160, expressly provides that just
compensation shall be determined as of the time of actual taking
and not as of the date of the filing of the complaint as provided for
under Section 4, Rule 67 of the Rules of Court. (The City of Cebu v.

Dedamo, 381 SCRA 754, 2002.)
7.
Ordinance No. 1843 sought to expropriate petitioners'
property without any attempt to first acquire the lands listed in
(a) to (e) of Section 9 of R.A. 7279. Likewise, Cebu City failed to
establish that the other modes of acquisition in Section 10 of R.A.
7279 were first exhausted. There was no evidence of a valid and
definite offer to buy petitioners' property as required by Section 19
of R.A. 7160. Ordinance No. 1843 is constitutionally infirm for being
violative of the petitioners' right to due process.

LAGCAO v. LABRA
440 SCRA 279, October 13, 2004, Corona, J.
Facts: In 1964, the Province of Cebu donated 210 lots to
the City of Cebu. One of these lots was Lot 1029, situated in
Capitol Hills, Cebu City, with an area of 4,048 square meters.

Book I
General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

87

In 1965, petitioners Diosdado Lagcao, et al., purchased Lot
1029 on installment basis. But then, in late 1965, the 210
lots, including Lot 1029, reverted to the Province of Cebu.
Consequently, the province tried to annul the sale of Lot 1029
by the City of Cebu to the petitioners Lagcao. This prompted
the latter to sue the province for specific performance and
damages in the then Court of First Instance.
The CFI and CA ruled in favor of petitioners and ordered
the Province of Cebu to execute the final deed of sale in favor
of petitioners. Thereafter, Transfer Certificate of Tile CTCT)
No. 129306 was issued in the name of petitioners and Crispina
Lagcao.
After acquiring title, petitioners tried to take possession
of the lot only to discover that it was already occupied by
squatters. Thus, on June 15, 1997, petitioners instituted
ejectment proceedings against the squatters. The MTCC and
RTC, Cebu City, ordered the squatters to vacate the lot.
When the demolition order was about to be implemented,
the Sangguniang Panlungsod (SP) of Cebu City passed a
resolution which identified Lot 1029 as a socialized housing
site pursuant to RA 7279. Then, on June 30, 1999, the SP of
Cebu City passed Ordinance No. 1772 which included Lot 1029
among the identified sites for socialized housing. On July, 19,
2000, Ordinance No. 1843 was enacted by the SP of Cebu City
authorizing the mayor of Cebu City to initiate expropriation
proceedings for the acquisition of Lot 1029 which was registered
in the name of petitioners. The intended acquisition was to
be used for the benefit of the homeless after its subdivision
and sale to the actual occupants thereof. The ordinance
appropriated the amount of P6,881,600 for the payment of the
subject lot. This ordinance was approved by Mayor Garcia on
August 2, 2000.

Ruling: RA 7279 is the law that governs the local
expropriation of property for purposes of urban land reform
and housing. Sections 9 and 10 thereof provide:
SEC. 9. Priorities in the Acquisition of Land.
Lands for socialized housing shall be acquired in the
following order:
(a) Those owned by the Government or any of its
subdivisions, instrumentalities, or agencies, including

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

88

government-owned or controlled corporations and their
subsidiaries;
(b)

Alienable lands of the public domain;

(c)

Unregistered or abandoned and idle lands;

(d) Those within the declared Areas or Priority
Development, Zonal Improvement Program sites, and
Slum Improvement and Resettlement Program sites
which have not yet been acquired;
(e) Bagong Lipunan Improvement of Sites and
Services or BLISS which have not yet been acquired; and
(f)

Privately-owned lands.

Where on-site development is found more practicable
and advantageous to the beneficiaries, the priorities
mentioned in this section shall not apply. The local
government units shall give budgetary priority to on-site
development of government lands.
SEC. 10. Modes of Land Acquisition. T he modes
of acquiring lands for purposes of this Act shall include,
among others, community mortgage, land swapping,
land assembly or consolidation, land banking, donation
to the Government, joint venture agreement, negotiated
purchase, and expropriation: Provided, however, That

expropriation shall be resorted to only when other
modes of acquisition have been exhausted: Provided
further, That where expropriation is resorted to, parcels
of land owned by small property owners shall be exempted
for purposes of this Act.
We have found nothing in the records indicating that the
City of Cebu complied strictly with Sections 9 and 10 of RA
7279. Ordinance No. 1843 sought to expropriate petitioners'
property without any attempt to first acquire the lands listed
in (a) to (e) of Section 9 of RA 7279. Likewise, Cebu City failed
to establish that the other modes of acquisition in Section 10 of
RA 7279 were first exhausted. Moreover, prior to the passage
of Ordinance No. 1843, there was no evidence of a valid and
definite offer to buy petitioners' property as required by Section
19 of RA 7160. We therefore find Ordinance No. 1843 to be
constitutionally infirm for being violative of the petitioners'
right to due process.
The petition is hereby GRANTED.

8. The Municipality failed to prove that before it filed its
complaint, it made a written definite and valid offer to acquire the
property for public use as an access road. The only evidence adduced
by the respondent to prove its compliance with Section 19 of the
Local Government Code is the photocopy of the letter purportedly
bearing the signature of Engr. Jose Reyes, to only one of the coowners, Lorenzo Ching Cuanco.

JESUS IS LORD CHRISTIAN SCHOOL FOUNDATION,
INC. v. MUNICIPALITY (NOW CITY) OF PASIG,
METRO MANILA
466 SCRA 235, August 9, 2005, Callejo, Sr., J.
Facts: The Municipality of Pasig needed an access road
from E. R. Santos Street, a municipal road near the Pasig
Public Market, to Barangay Sto. Tomas Bukid, Pasig, where
60 to 70 houses, mostly made of light materials, were located.
The road had to be at least three meters in width, as required
by the Fire Code, so that fire trucks could pass through in case
of conflagration. Likewise, the residents in the area needed the
road for water and electrical outlets. The municipality then
decided to acquire 51 square meters out of the 1,791-square
meter property of Lorenzo Ching Cuanco, Victor Ching Cuanco
and Ernesto Ching Cuanco Kho covered by TCT No. PT-66585,
which is abutting E. R. Santos Street.
On April 19, 1993, the Sangguniang Bayan of Pasig
approved an Ordinance authorizing the municipal mayor to
initiate expropriation proceedings to acquire the said property
and appropriate the fund therefor. The ordinance stated that
the property owners were notified of the municipality's intent
to purchase the property for public use as an access road but
they rejected the offer.
On July 21, 1993, the municipality filed a complaint,
amended on August 6, 1993, against the Ching Cuancos for the
expropriation of the property under Section 19 of Republic Act
(R.A.) No. 7160, LGC.
On November 26, 1993, the plaintiff caused the
annotation of a notice of lis pendens at the dorsal portion
of TCT No. PT-92579 under the name of the Jesus ls Lord
Christian School Foundation, Incorporated (JILCSFI) which
had purchased the property.

Ruling: The grant of the power of eminent domain to
local government units is grounded on Section 19 of R.A. No.
7160. Article 35 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing
the LGC provides:

compliance with Section 19 of the Local Government Code is
the photocopy of the letter purportedly bearing the signature of
Engr. Jose Reyes, to only one of the co-owners, Lorenzo Ching
Cuanco.

ARTICLE 35. Offer to Buy and Contract of Sale. - (a)
The offer to buy private property for public use or purpose
shall be in writing. It shall specify the property sought to
be acquired, the reasons for its acquisition, and the price
offered.

It bears stressing, however, that the respondent offered
the letter only to prove its desire or intent to acquire the property
for a right-of-way. The document was not offered to prove that
the respondent made a definite and valid offer to acquire the
property. Moreover, the RTC rejected the document because
the respondent failed to adduce in evidence the original copy
thereof. The respondent, likewise, failed to adduce evidence
that copies of the letter were sent to and received by all the coowners of the property, namely, Lorenzo Ching Cuanco, Victor
Ching Cuanco and Ernesto Kho.

b) If the owner or owners accept the offer in its
entirety, a contract of sale shall be executed and payment
forthwith made.
(c) If the owner or owners are willing to sell their
property but at a price higher than that offered to them,
the local chief executive shall call them to a conference for
the purpose of reaching an agreement on the selling price.
The chairman of the appropriation or finance committee
of the sanggunian, or in his absence, any member of
the sanggunian duly chosen as its representative, shall
participate in the conference. When an agreement is
reached by the parties, a contract of sale shall be drawn
and executed.
(d) The contract of sale shall be supported by the
following documents:
(1) Resolution of the sanggunian authorizing
the local chief executive to enter into a contract of
sale. The resolution shall specify the terms and
conditions to be embodied in the contract;
(2) Ordinance appropriating
specified in the contract; and

the

amount

(3) Certification of the local treasurer as to
availability of funds together with a statement that
such fund shall not be disbursed or spent for any
purpose other than to pay for the purchase of the
property involved.
In the present case, the respondent failed to prove that
before it filed its complaint, it made a written definite and
valid offer to acquire the property for public use as an access
road. The only evidence adduced by the respondent to prove its

The petition is GRAN TED. The Decision and Resolution
of the Court of Appeals arc REVERSED AND SET ASIDE.
The RTC is ordered to dismiss the complaint of the respondent
without prejudice to the refiling thereof.
9. A local government unit cannot authorize an expropriation
of private property through a mere resolution of its lawmakin g body.
C.A. No. 538, which provides for suspension of ejectment proceedings,
applies only to cases where there exist actual expropriation
proceedings and only tenants who have been in faithful payment of
rentals may invoke the benefits under C.A. No. 538.
ANTONIO v. GERONIMO
476 SCRA 340, November 29, 2005, Tinga, J.
Facts: A complaint for unlawful detainer was filed
before the MTC of Antipolo, by Alexander Catolos (private
respondent), who alleged that he was the registered owner of
four (4) parcels of land situated at Mayamot, Antipolo, Rizal,
covered by a TCT. The defendants therein were the petitioners
Danilo Antonio, et al. who were occupying the said properties.
The complaint was resolved in favor of private respondent.
In a Decision dated 15 September 1993, respondent judge
ordered petitioners to vacate the subject properties. On 28
March 1994, a writ of demolition was issued.
On 20 June 1995, the Sangguniang Bayan of Antipolo,
Rizal passed Resolution No. 61-95, [6] authorizing Mayor

92

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Daniel Garcia to acquire thru expropriation or purchase the
subject properties for public purposes/socialized housing.
On 28 November 1995, petitioners filed a motion to stay
execution with the MTC. Commonwealth Act No. 538 (An
Act Suspending Ejectment Actions) was invoked in asking
respondent judge to suspend the action for ejectment in view of
the announced expropriation of the subject properties.
Ruling: Local government units may exercise the power
of eminent domain, subject to the limitation embodied under
the law. There are two relevant laws to consider, the Local
Government Code (LGC) and Republic Act No. 7279 Urban
Development and Housing Act (UDHA).
In the instant case, no ordinance was passed by the
Sangguniang Bayan of Antipolo. In its stead were Resolution
Nos. 61-95 and 88-95. It has been categorically stated in the
cases of Municipality of Paranaque v. V.M. Realty Corporation
292 SCRA 678 (1998) and Heirs of Suguitan v. City of
Mandaluyong 384 Phil 676 (2000) that a local government unit
cannot authorize an expropriation of private property through
a mere resolution of its lawmaking body.
Assuming that there was even an attempt by Antipolo
City to expropriate the subject properties for socialized
housing, the records do not show compliance with the
abovementioned rules. No attempt was made to acquire the
first five (5) lands mentioned in Section 9. Neither were the
other modes of acquisition exhausted, as mandated by Section
10. An examination of the resolutions readily shows that the
purpose for which they were passed is to save petitioners from
the impending demolition. Yet nothing therein is of binding
force as to preclude the ejectment of the petitioners or the
demolition of their houses.
We agree with private respondent that Commonwealth
Act No. 538 which provides for suspension of ejectment
proceedings, applies only to cases where there exist actual
expropriation proceedings and only tenants who have been in
faithful payment of rentals may invoke the benefits under CA
No. 538.
The petition is DISMISSED.

10. Respondent City of Pasig has failed to establish that
there is a genuine necessity to expropriate petitioner's property.
The Certification issued by the Caniogan Barangay Council the
basis for the passage of Ordinance No. 42 s. 1993 authorizing
the expropriation, indicates that the intended beneficiary is the
Melendres Compound Homeowners Association, a private, nonprofit organization, not the residents of Can.iogan. The purpose is,
therefore, not clearly and categorically public.
MASIKIP v. THE CITY OF PASIG
479 SCRA 391, January 23, 2006, Sandoval-Gutierrez, J.
Facts: Petitioner Lourdes Dela Paz Masikip is the
registered owner of a parcel of land with 4,521 square meters
located at Pag-Asa, Caniogan, Pasig City, Metro Manila.
In a letter dated January 6, 1994, the then Municipality
of Pasig, now City of Pasig, respondent, notified petitioner
of its intention to expropriate a 1,500 square meter portion
of her property to be used for the "sports development and
recreational activities" of the residents of Barangay Caniogan.
This was pursuant to Ordinance No. 42, Series of 1993 enacted
by the then Sangguniang Bayan of Pasig.
Subsequently, on February 21, 1995, respondent fled
with the trial court a complaint for expropriation.
Ruling: Section 19 of the Local Government Code of 1991
(Republic Act No. 7160) prescribes the delegation by Congress
of the power of eminent domain to local government units and
lays down the parameters for its exercise.
The right to take private property for public purposes
necessarily originates from "the necessity" and the taking
must be limited to such necessity. In City of Manila v. Chinese
Community of Manila, 40 Phil 349 (1919) we held that the
very foundation of the right to exercise eminent domain
is a genuine necessity and that necessity must be of a
public character.
Applying this standard, we hold that respondent City of
Pasig has failed to establish that there is a genuine necessity
to expropriate petitioner's property. Our scrutiny of the records
shows that the Certification issued by the Caniogan Barangay
Council dated November 20, 1994, the basis for the passage

94

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

of Ordinance No. 42 s. 1993 authorizing the expropriation,
indicates that the intended beneficiary is the Melendres
Compound Homeowners Association, a private, non-profit
organization, not the residents of Caniogan.
It can be gleaned that the members of the said Association
are desirous of having their own private playground and
recreational facility. Petitioner's lot is the nearest vacant
space available. The purpose is, therefore, not clearly and
categorically public. The necessity has not been shown,
especially considering that there exists an alternative facility
for sports development and community recreation in the area,
which is the Rainforest Park, available to all residents of Pasig
City, including those of Caniogan.
WHEREFORE, the petition for review is GRAN TED. The
challenged Decision and Resolution of the Court of Appeals are
REVERSED. The complaint for expropriation filed before the
trial court by respondent City of Pasig is ordered DISMISSED.
11. Since the local government of Paranaque has not
purchased nor undertaken any expropriation proceedings, neither
did the petitioner and his siblings donate the subject property, the
latter is still a private property and Ordinance No. 88-04 did not
convert the same to public property.

GATCHALIAN v. FLORES
G.R. No. 225176, January 19, 2018, Tijam, J.
Facts: Petitioner Esmeraldo Gatchalian is one of the coowners of a parcel of land (Road Lot 23) covered by TCT No.
79180 located at Brgy. Vitalez, Paranaque City. Road Lot 23
is registered under the name of petitioner's parents, spouses
Sixto Gatchalian and Liceria Gatchalian. On June 2, 2011,
petitioner filed a Complaint for Ejectment with Damages
against respondents Cesar Flores, et al. with the MeTC of
Paranaque City, Branch 77.
For their part, respondents denied that they usurped
the property of petitioner. In fact, it was the Gatchalians who
have encroached on Road Lot 23 when they put up a fence in
their (respondents) property. They insisted that Road Lot 23
is a public road and is now known as "Don Juan Street Gat-

Book I General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

95

Mendoza." In the subdivision plan of the GAT Mendoza Housing
area, Road Lot 23 is constituted as a right of way. Respondents
believed that petitioner has no cause of action against them
and has no authority to file the instant case because it is the
City Government of Paranaque which has the right to do so.
Ruling: Petitioner asserts that he is entitled to the
possession of the road lot being one of the co-owners of the same
since it is registered under the name of petitioner's parents.
While respondents do not claim ownership of the subject lot,
they argued that the road lot is now public property because
of Ordinance No. 88-04, series of 1988 constituting it as "Don
Juan St. Gat-Mendoza." As such, petitioner cannot evict
respondents.
It is undisputed that the road lot is registered under
the name of petitioner's parents. Even the respondents did
not dispute this fact. It is also undisputed that the municipal
government has not undertaken any expropriation proceedings
to acquire the subject property neither did the petitioner donate
or sell the same to the municipal government. Therefore, absent
any expropriation proceedings and without any evidence that
the petitioner donated or sold the subject property to the
municipal government, the same is still private property.
Since the local government of Paranaque has not
purchased nor undertaken any expropriation proceedings,
neither did the petitioner and his siblings donate the subject
property, the latter is still a private property and Ordinance
No. 88-04 did not convert the same to public property.
As to the CA's finding that by virtue of laches the subject
property has been converted into public property, We do not
agree.
It is well-settled that an "owner of [a] registered land
does not lose his rights over a property on the ground of laches
as long as the opposing claimant's possession was merely
tolerated by the owner."
The petition is GRAN TED.

12. There was no showing that any attempt was made to
first acquire the lands listed in Section 9(a) to (e) R.A. 7279 before
proceeding to expropriate respondents' private lands.
CITY OF MAN ILA v. PRIETO
G.R. No. 221366, July 8, 2019, Reyes, J. Jr., J.
Facts: On January 19, 2004, the City Council of Manila
enacted Ordinance No. 8070 that authorized the City Mayor
to acquire certain parcels of land belonging to respondents
Alejandro Roces Prieto, et al.
Initially, petitioner attempted to acquire the subject lots
by negotiated sale, offering the amount of P2,000.00 per square
meter, which respondents refused to accept on the ground that
their respective properties are worth more than that.
Thus, petitioner filed a Complaint dated September 3,
2004, before the RTC, asserting its authority to expropriate
the subject lots for its project.
Ruling: As correctly found by the CA, we find nothing
in the records indicating that petitioner complied with Section
19 of the LGC and Sections 9 and 10 of R.A. No. 7279. (Urban

Development Housing Act of 1992.)
There was no showing that any attempt was made to first
acquire the lands listed in Section 9(a) to (e) before proceeding
to expropriate respondents' private lands. There was also no
document or any evidence presented to prove a study allegedly
conducted showing comparisons and considerations to support
petitioner's conclusion that onsite development was its best
choice.
What is more, there was no evidence presented showing
that the subject properties were those contemplated under
R.A. 7279 to be proper subjects of on-site development. The CA
correctly pointed out that R.A. No. 7279 provides for a detailed
description of specific areas which are the proper subjects of
on-site development, i.e., those "areas where the structures are
dilapidated, obsolete, and unsanitary, tending to depreciate
the value of the land and prevent normal development and use
of the area" as defined under Section 31), in relation to Section
3(c) of R.A. No. 7279. It is, thus, incumbent upon petitioner to
show that the areas they sought to expropriate for socialized

Book I General Provisions
Title One - Basic Principles

97

housing and urban development are those contemplated under
the law. Again, unsupported allegations and generalizations
will not suffice.
Here, it is undisputed that after respondents rejected
petitioner's offer of P2,000.00 per square meter to purchase
their lots for being too low compared to the fair market value
of their properties, petitioner readily instituted the present
expropriation suit without bothering to renegotiate its offer.
Relevantly, thus, there is no valid and definite offer made
by petitioner before it filed the expropriation complaint. The
intent of the law is for the State or the local government to
make a reasonable offer in good faith, not merely a pro forma
offer to acquire the property.
The petition is DENIED. Accordingly, the Decision and
Resolution of the Court of Appeals are AFFIRMED.
SEC, 20. Reclassification of Lands. (a) A city
or municipality may, through an ordinance passed
by the sangganian after conducting public hearings
for the purpose, authorize the reclassification of
agricultural lands and provide for the manner of
their utilization or disposition in the following
cases: () when the land ceases to be economically
feasible and sound for agricultural purposes as
determined by the Department of Agricultural or
(2) where the land shall have substantially greater
economic value for residential, commercial,
or industrial purposes, as determined by the
sanggunian concerned: Provided, That such
reclassification shall be limited to the following
percentage of the total agricultural land area at the
time of the passage of the ordinance:
(1) For highly urbanized and independent
component cities, fifteen percent (15%);
(2) For component cities and first to
third class municipalities, ten percent (10%);
and
(3) For
fourth

shall not be affected by the said reclassification
and the conversion of such lands into other

said Act.
(b) The President may, when public interest
so requires and upon recommendation of the
National Economic and Development Authority,
authorize a city or municipality to reclassify lands
in excess of the limits set in the next preceding
paragraph.
(c) The local government units shall, in
conformity with existing laws, continue to prepare
their respective comprehensive land use plans
enacted through zoning ordinances which shall be
the primary and dominant bases for the future use of
land resources; Provided, That the requirements for
food production, human settlements, and industrial
expansion shall be taken into consideration in the
preparation of such plans.

Decided Cases

1.
The declaration by the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Davao
City that the C-2 district shall be classified as a commercial zone is a
valid exercise of police power to promote the good order and general
welfare of the people in the locality. The operation of a funeral parlor
constitutes a commercial purpose.

PATALINGHUG v. CA
229 SCRA 554, January 27, 1994, Romero, J.
Facts: The Sangguniang Panlungsod of Davao City
enacted Zoning Ordinance No. 363 which provides (Sec. 8)
that the C-2 District shall be dominantly for commercial and
compatible industrial uses, among which are funeral parlors/
memorial homes with adequate off street parking space and
provided that they shall be established not less than 50 meters
from any residential structures, churches and other institutional
buildings.

Meanwhile, petitioner Alfredo Patalinghug constructed a
funeral parlor at Cabaguio Avenue, Agdao. However, several
residents of Barangay Agdao, Davao City complained that the
construction of petitioner's funeral parlor violated Ordinance
No. 363, since it was allegedly situated within a 50-meter
radius from the Iglesia ni Kristo Chapel and several residential
structures. The Sangguniang Panlungsod conducted an
investigation and found that the nearest residential structure,
owned by Wilfredo G. Tepoot is only 8 inches to the south.
Notwithstanding the findings of the Sangguniang Panlungsod,
petitioner continued to construct his funeral parlor.
Consequently, private respondents filed a case for the
declaration of nullity of a building permit.
The lower court dismissed the complaint finding that the
residential buildings were 63.25 meters away, while the Iglesia
ni Kristo chapel was 55.95 meters away. On appeal, the Court
of Appeals reversed the lower court by annulling building
permit No. 870254 issued in favor of petitioner. It ruled that
the construction of the funeral parlor was within the 50-meter
radius measured from the Tepoot's building. The Appellate
Court disagreed with the lower court's determination that
Tepoot's building was commercial and ruled that although it
was used by Mr. Tepoot's leases for laundry business, it was a
residential lot as reflected in the tax declaration, thus paving
the way for the application of Ordinance No. 363. Hence, this
appeal.

Held: The reversal by the Court of Appeals of the trial
court's decision was based on Tepoot's building being declared
for taxation purposes as residential. A tax declaration is not
conclusive of the nature of the property for zoning purposes.
The trial court's determination that Mr. Tepoot's
building is commercial is strengthened by the fact that the
Sangguniang Panlungsod has declared the questioned area
as commercial or C-2. Consequently, even if Tepoot's building
was declared for taxation purposes as residential, once a
local government has reclassified an area as commercial,
that determination for zoning purposes must prevail. While
the commercial character of the questioned vicinity has been
declared thru the ordinance, private respondents have failed to
present convincing arguments to substantiate their claim that
Cabaguio Avenue, where the funeral parlor was constructed

100

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

was still a residential zone. Unquestionably, the operation of
a funeral parlor constitute, a "commercial purpose" as gleaned
from Ordinance No. 636.
The declaration of the said area as a commercial zone thru
a municipal ordinance is an exercise of police power to promote
the good order and general welfare of the people in the locality.
The decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and that
of the trial court reinstated.
2.
The main purpose of zoning is the protection of public
safety, health, convenience, and welfare. There is no indication that
the Torre de Manila project brings any harm, danger, or hazard
to the people in the surrounding areas except that the building
allegedly poses an unsightly view on the taking of photos or the
visual appreciation of the Rizal Monument by locals and tourists.

KNIGHTS OF RIZAL v. DMCI HOMES, INC.
824 SCRA 327, April 18, 2017, Carpio, J.
Facts: On 1 September 2011, DMCI Project Developers,
Inc. (DMCI.PDI) acquired a 7,716.60-square meter lot in the
City of Manila, located near Taft Avenue, Ermita, beside the
former Manila Jai-Alai Building and Adamson University. The
lot was earmarked for the construction of DMCI-PDI's Torre de
Manila condominium project.
The Manila Zoning Board of Adjustments and Appeals
(MZBAA) issued Zoning Board Resolution No. 06-A, Series of
2013, on 8 January 2014.
On 16 January 2014, the City Council of Manila issued
Resolution No. 5, Series of 2014, adopting Zoning Board
Resolution Nos. 06 and 06-A. The City Council resolution
states that "the City Council of Manila find[ s] no cogent reason
to deny and/or reverse the aforesaid recommendation of the
(MZBAA] and hereby ratif{ies] and confirm[s] all previously
issued permits, licenses and approvals issued by the City
[Council] of Manila for Torre de Manila[.]"
On 12 September 2014, the Knights of Rizal (KOR), a
"civic, patriotic, cultural, nonpartisan, non-sectarian and non·
profit organization" created under Republic Act No. 646, filed a
Petition for Injunction seeking a temporary restraining order,

Book I- General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

IOI

and later a permanent injunction, against the construction
of DMCI-PDl's Torre de Manila condominium project. The
KOR argues that the subject matter of the present suit is one
of "transcendental importance, paramount public interest,
of overarching significance to society, or with far-reaching
implication" involving the desecration of the Rizal Monument.
Ruling: In the present case, nowhere is it found in
Ordinance No. 8119 or in any law, ordinance, or rule for that
matter, that the construction of a building outside the Rizal
Park is prohibited if the building is within the background
sightline or view of the Rizal Monument.
While the Rizal Park has been declared a National
Historical Site, the area where Torre de Manila is being built
is a privately-owned property that is "not part of the Rizal Park
that has been declared as a National Heritage Site and the
Torre de Manila area is in fact "well-beyond" the Rizal Park,
according to NHCP Chairperson Dr. Maria Serena I. Diokno.
Neither has the area of the Torre de Manila been designated as
a "heritage zone, a cultural property, a historical landmark or
even a national treasure."
The main purpose of zoning is the protection of public
safety, health, convenience, and welfare. There is no indication
that the Torre de Manila project brings any harm, danger, or
hazard to the people in the surrounding areas except that the
building allegedly poses an unsightly view on the taking of
photos or the visual appreciation of the Rizal Monument by
locals and tourists. In fact, the Court must take the approval of
the MZBAA, and its subsequent ratification by the City Council
of Manila, as the duly authorized exercise of discretion by the
city officials. Great care must be taken that the Court does not
unduly tread upon the local government's performance of its
duties.
It can easily be gleaned that the Torre de Manila is not
a nuisance per se. The Torre de Manila project cannot be
considered as a "direct menace to public health or safety."
Not only is a condominium project commonplace in the City of
Manila, DMCI-PDI has, according to the proper government
agencies, complied with health and safety standards set by law.
The question, then, of whether the Torre de Manila
project is a nuisance per accidens must be settled after due

purpose for which other real property belonging
to the local government unit concerned may be
lawfully used or conveyed: Provided, however,
That no freedom park shall be closed permanently
without provision for its transfer or relocation to a
new site.

In sum, bearing in mind the Court does not intervene in
discretionary acts of the executive department in the absence
of grave abuse of discretion, and considering that mandamus
may only be issued to enforce a clear and certain legal right, the
present special civil action for mandamus must be dismissed
and the TRO issued earlier must be lifted.

square may be temporarily closed during an actual
emergency, or fiesta celebrations, public rallies,
agricultural or industrial fairs, or an undertak ing

shall be specified by the local chief executive
concerned in a written order: Provided, however,
That no national or local road, alley, park, or
square shall be temporarily closed for athletic,
cultural, or civic activities not officially sponsored,
recognized, or approved by the local government
unit concerned.

The petition for mandamus is DISMISSED.
(d) Where approval by a national agency is
required for reclassification, such approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Failure to act on a
proper and complete application for reclassification
within three (3) months from receipt of the same
shall be deemed as approval thereof.

There exists no doubt that Cebu City repudiated its
right to use the subject lot for other public purpose; and instead,
recognized the right of the former owner or his successor-in-interest
to repurchase the same.

FIGURACION v. LIBI
539 SCRA 50, November 28, 2007, Austria-Martinez, J.
Facts: Galileo Figuracion was the owner of Lot No.
899-D-2 situated in Cebu City. Sometime in 1948, the Cebu
City government (Cebu City) expropriated Lot No. 899-D-2,
consisting of 474 sq. m. and turned the same into a portion of
N. Escario Street, connecting the Capitol Building to Gorordo
Avenue and U.P. Junior College. Cebu City paid P23,700.00 for
Lot No. 899-D-2 and was issued TCT No. 49454.
In Resolution No. 330, dated March 20, 1989, the Cebu
City Sangguniang Panlungsod approved the reconveyance to
Isagani Figuracion, successor-in-interest of Galileo Figuracion,
of an unused portion of Lot No. 899-D-2, designated as Lot No.
899-D-2-A (subject lot), consisting of 84 sq. m.
Upon resurvey over two years later, it was ascertained
that the subject lot actually measures 130 sq. m. Accordingly,
the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Cebu City amended
Resolution No. 330 by issuing Resolution No. 2345, approving
the reconveyance of 130 sq. m. of Lot No. 899-D-2, and Mayor
Osmena executed in favor of Isagani Figuracion an amended
deed of sale dated January 24, 1992 over said portion for
P65,000.00. TCT No. 122369 was issued on September 30, 1992
to Isagani Figuracion.
It appearing that herein respondents Spouses Libi had
been using the subject lot, and refused to vacate it despite
demand, petitioners Natividad Figuracion, et al. as successorsin-interest of Isagani Figuracion, fled against respondents a
complaint for unlawful detainer, in the MTC Branch 2, Cebu
City.

Ruling: There exists no doubt that Cebu City repudiated
its right to use the subject lot for other public purpose; and
instead, recognized the right of the former owner or his
successor-in-interest to repurchase the same.

Book I - General Provisions
Title One - Basic Principles

105

In exercise of its discretion to declare a city street or part
thereof abandoned, the Cebu City council unanimously issued
Resolutions No. 330 and No. 2345, declaring the subject lot
vacant and available for conveyance. Respondents themselves
acknowledge that the subject lot was not included in the
construction of Escario Street.
Through the Resolutions, Cebu City ineluctably recognized
the right of petitioners, as successors-in-interest of the
former owner, to repurchase the subject lot. The Resolutions,
issued by the city government in exercise of its regular and
official functions, constitute clear and positive evidence of the
intention of Cebu City to return or reconvey to the former
owner or his successor-in-interest, by way of sale, the portion
of the expropriated property that is no longer needed for the
purpose for which it was intended.
Respondents have no legal basis to challenge the
reconveyance of Lot No. 899-D-2-A by Cebu City to petitioners.
The deed of sale and amended deed of sale between Cebu City
and petitioners, and TCT No. 122309 were all validly issued in
favor of petitioners.
The petition is GRAN TED.

. To convert a barrio road into patrimonial property, the

law requires the LGU to enact an ordinance, approved by at least
two-thirds (2/3) of the Sanggunian members, permanently closing
the road. In this case, the Sanggunian did not enact an ordinance but
merely passed a resolution. Permanent obstructions on these roads
such as the respondents' illegally constructed house, are injurious
public welfare and convenience. The occupation and use of private
individuals of public places devoted to public use constitute public
and private nuisances and nuisance per se.

ALOLINO v. FLORES
788 SCRA 92, April 4, 2016, Brion, J.
. Facts: Teofilo Alolino is the registered owner of two (2)
contiguous parcels of land situated at No. 47 Gen. Luna Street,
Barangay Tuktukan, Taguig, covered by TCTs.
Alolino has a two-storey house on the property. In 1994,
the respondent spouses Fortunato and Anastacia (Marie) Flores
constructed their house/sari-sari store on the vacant municipal/

106

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

barrio road immediately adjoining the rear perimeter wall of
Alolino's house. Since they were constructing on a municipal
road, the respondents could not secure a building permit. The
structure is only about two (2) to three (3) inches away from the
back of Alolino's house, covering the latter's five windows and
the exit door. The respondents' construction deprived Alolino
of the light and ventilation he had previously enjoyed and
prevented his ingress and egress to the municipal road through
the rear door of his house.

Ruling: We find no merit in the respondents' contention
that the Local Government of Taguig had already withdrawn
the subject barrio road from public use and reclassified it as a
residential lot. The Local Government Code (LGC) authorizes
an LGU to withdraw a local road from public use under the
conditions in Section 21.
To convert a barrio road into patrimonial property, the
law requires the LGU to enact an ordinance, approved by at
least two-thirds (2/3) of the Sanggunian members, permanently
closing the road.
In this case, the Sanggunian did not enact an ordinance
but merely passed a resolution. The difference between an
ordinance and a resolution is settled in jurisprudence: an
ordinance is a law but a resolution is only a declaration of
sentiment or opinion of the legislative body. The Sanggunian's
failure to comply with Section 21 renders ineffective its
reclassification of the barrio road.
Alolino does not have an easement of light and view or
an easement of right of way over the respondents' property or
the barrio road it stands on. This does not mean, however, that
the respondents are entitled to continue occupying the barrio
road and blocking the rear of Alolino's house. Every building
is subject to the easement which prohibits the proprietor or
possessor from committing nuisance. Under Article 694 of the
Civil Code, the respondents' house is evidently a nuisance:
Art. 694. A nuisance is any act, omission, establishment,
business, condition of property, or anything else which:
(4) Obstructs or interferes with the free
passage of any public highway or street, or any body
of water;

Book I - General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

107

A barrio road is designated for the use of the general
public who are entitled to free and unobstructed passage
thereon. Permanent obstructions on these roads, such as the
respondents' illegally constructed house, are injurious to public
welfare and convenience. The occupation and use of private
individuals of public places devoted to public use constitute
public and private nuisances and nuisance per se.
Sec. 28 of the Urban Development and Housing Act itself
allows the demolition of illegal structures on public roads and
sidewalks because these nuisances are injurious to public
welfare. Evidently, the respondents have no right to maintain
their occupation and permanent obstruction of the barrio road.
The interests of the few do not outweigh the greater interest of
public health, public safety, good order, and general welfare.
The petition is GRAN TED.
4.
The use of the subdivision roads by the general public
does not strip it of its private character. The road is not converted
into public property by mere tolerance of the subdivision owner of
the public's passage through it. To repeat, the local government
should first acquire them by donation, purchase, or expropriation, if
they are to be utilized as a public road.
HEIRS OF JOSE MARIANO v. CITY OF NAGA
G.R. No. 197743, March 12, 2018, Tijam, J.

Facts: On July 3, 1954, Eusebio M. Lopez, Sr., Soledad
L. Dolor, Jose A. Gimenez and Eusebio Lopez, Jr., as the
President, Secretary, Treasurer and General Manager of the
City Heights Subdivision, respectively, wrote to the mayor
of the City of Naga, Camarines Sur, offering to construct the
Naga City Hall within the premises of the Subdivision.
Petitioners averred that the landowners' plan to donate
five hectares to the City did not materialize as the contract to
build the City Hall was not awarded to the Subdivision.
In their Complaint, petitioners asked the MTC to order
the City and all agencies, instrumentalities or offices claiming
rights under it, including the LTO, NBI, DOLE, PPC and the
Fire Department, to vacate the subject property, and to return
possession thereof to them.

108

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Petitioners averred that there was no donation of the
subject property to the City as the obligation to donate on the
part of Macario and Gimenez, conditioned on the Subdivision
undertaking the construction of the City Hall therein, was
abrogated when the City eventually awarded the construction
contract to Francisoco Sabaria. Petitioners further alleged that
Macario thereafter demanded the return of the property.
Ruling: The City cannot successfully invoke the 1948
Subdivision Regulations as basis to demand vested proprietary
rights over the subject property. Contrary to its position that
roads as well as open spaces in subdivisions instantly belong
to the government without need of compensation or any overt
act of donation, the Subdivision Regulations indicate that local
governments did not automatically become the owner of roads
and open space in subdivisions within their jurisdiction and a
positive act of conveyance or dedication was necessary to vest
ownership in the city or municipality.
Even under PD 957, (Regulating the Sale of Subdivision
Lots and Condominiums.) specifically Section 31, it was
optional on the part of the owner or developer of the
subdivision to donate the roads and open space found therein.
Furthermore, under PD 1216, "(t)he transfer of ownership from
the subdivision owner-developer to the local government is not
automatic but requires a positive act from the owner-developer
before the city or municipality can acquire dominion over the
subdivision roads," such that "until and unless the roads are
donated, ownership remains with the owner-developer."
Contrary to the position of petitioners, the use of the
subdivision roads by the general public does not strip it of its
private character. The road is not converted into public property
by mere tolerance of the subdivision owner of the public's
passage through it. To repeat, the local government should
first acquire them by donation, purchase, or expropriation, if
they are to be utilized as a public road.
The petition is GRANTED. The Court of Appeals'
Amended Decision is SET ASIDE. The Decision of the RTC of
Nags City which ordered the City of Nags and other agencies
in the properties to vacate the subject properties and surrender
them to the petitioners is REINSTATED with MODIFICATION

A homeowners' association may regulate passage into a

WILLIAM G. KWONG MAN AGEMENT, INC.
v. DIAM OND HOMEOWN ERS & RESIDENTS
ASSOCIATION
G.R. No. 211353, June 10, 2019, Leonen, J.
Facts: To safeguard the whole subdivision, Diamond
Homeowners and Residents Association proposed the "No
Sticker, No ID, No Entry" Policy.
Under the Policy, visitors on vehicles who sought to enter
the premises must leave with the subdivision guards their
identification cards, which they may reclaim upon leaving the
subdivision. Visitors on foot were not required to surrender
theirs. Meanwhile, residents with vehicles may obtain stickers
to identify themselves so that they did not need to surrender
any identification card.
After consultations and meetings, the Policy was approved
in December 2006. Diamond Homeowners later issued a
Memorandum to inform residents that the Policy would be
implemented by March 15, 2007. William Kwong, a resident of
the subdivision however, contested the Policy.
When Diamond Homeowners did not heed his objection,
Kwong filed before the Housing and Land Use Regulatory
Board Regional Office a Complaint for the issuance of a cease
and desist order with application for a temporary restraining
order. He argued that the Policy was invalid because the
subdivision roads have been donated to the City of Angeles in
1974 and were, thus, public roads that must be open for public
use. Likewise, he contended that the screening of visitors would
be cumbersome for his customers, affecting his businesses. He
runs 3 motels in the subdivision.

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Book I - General Provisions
Title One - Basic Principles

Ruling: There is no question that the subdivision roads
have been donated to the City of Angeles. Therefore, they are
public property, for public use.

SEC. 22. Corporate Powers.
(a) Every local
government unit, as a corporation, shall have the
following powers:

Both Presidential Decree Nos. 957 and 1216 are silent on
the right of homeowners' associations to issue regulations on
using the roads to ensure the residents' safety and security.

(1) To have continuous succession in its
corporate name;

This silence was addressed in 2010 when Republic Act No.
9904, or the Magna Carta for Homeowners and Homeowners'
Associations, was enacted.
Section 10(d) of RA 9904 gives homeowners' associations
the right to "[regulate access to, or passage through the
subdivision/village roads for purposes of preserving privacy,
tranquility, internal security, safety[,] and traffic order" as
Jong as they complied with the requisites. The law does not
distinguish whether the roads have been donated to the local
government or not.
This Court further notes that the Deed of Donation
recognizes the Diamond Subdivision's power to monitor the
security within the subdivision. The Deed of Donation between
the developer of Diamond Subdivision and the City of Angeles
states:
That it is a condition of this donation, that the
Severina Realty Corporation will have the exclusive right
to appoint and to enter into a contract with any duly
licensed security guard agency for the security guard
services of the Diamond Subdivision, Angeles City.
Thus, the subdivision is still empowered to determine how
best to maintain the security and safety within the subdivision.
The community's welfare should prevail over the
convenience of subdivision visitors who seek to patronize
petitioners' businesses. Article XII, Section 6 of the Constitution
provides that the use of property bears a social function,
and economic enterprises of persons are still subject to the
promotion of distributive justice and state intervention for the
common good:
WHEREFORE, this Court AFFIRMS the Court of
Appeals' Decision and Resolution. This Court finds that
Diamond Homeowners & Residents Association's "No Sticker,
No ID, No Entry" Policy is valid and consistent with law and
jurisprudence.

(c) Unless otherwise provided in this Code,
no contract may be entered into by the local chief
executive in behalf of the local government unit
without prior authorization by the sanggunian
concerned. A legible copy of such contract shall
be posted at a conspicuous place in the provincial
capitol or the city, municipal or barangay hall.
(d) Local government units shall enjoy full
autonomy in the exercise of their proprietary
functions and in the management of their economic
enterprises, subject to the limitations provided in
this Code and other applicable laws.

A.

Comm ents

1.
The courts, including the Supreme Court cannot condone
much less encourage, the repudiation of just obligations contracted
by municipal corporations. On the contrary, the courts will extend
their aid to citizens in enforcing their rights and compel payments
of their valid claims against municipalities with which they entered
into valid contracts. This authority naturally carries with it all
the remedies and court processes, including writs of execution
and attachment against municipal corporations. While the court
is willing and ready to protect properties of municipalities held for
public use, the court believes that other properties of municipalities
not held for public use, including funds which are not essential to the
performance of their functions, may be levied upon and sold or taken
to satisfy valid claims against said municipalities. And the court will
help any citizen and give him every judicial facility to enforce his
valid claim, especially a court award against municipal corporations,
even to the extent of attaching and selling on execution, municipal
revenues and properties not exempt from execution. (Municipality
of Pasay v. Manaois, 86 Phil. 629.)
2.
In San Diego • Mun. of Naujan, 107 Phil. 118, the
Supreme Court ruled that there is no doubt that the original lease
contract in this case was awarded to the highest bidder, but the
reduction of the rental and the extension of the term of the lease
appear to have been granted without previous public bidding.
In the case of Caltex (Phil.), Inc. v. Delgado Bros., Inc., G.R. No.
L-5439, December 29, 1954, the amendment to an arrastre contract
was declared null and void on the ground that it was made without
previous public bidding.
3.
A consent decree, in which the officials of a municipality
assume obligations not authorized by law, is null and void. (City of
Manila u. Tarlac Development Corporation, 24 SCRA 466.)
The fact that, by consent of the municipal officers, an agreement
or stipulation made by them has been put in the form of a judgment,
in an effort to give it the force and effect of a judgment does not
cure a lack of power in the officers to make it, and if such power is
lacking, the judgment as well as the stipulation is void. (Ibid.)
4.
The doctrine of estoppel cannot be applied as against a
municipal corporation to validate a contract which it has no power
to make, or which it is authorized to make only under prescribed
mode or manner, although the corporation has accepted the

Book I - General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

113

benefits thereof and the other party has fully performed his part
of the agreement, or has expended large sums in preparation for
performance. (Pavis v. Municipality of Sabangan, 27 SCRA 92.)
5.
The Mayor has no legal authority to take over operations
and control of a private person's gasoline station without observing
due process. (Lecaroz v. Sandiganbayan, 128 SCRA 324.)
6.
In Province of Cebu v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 147
SCRA 447, a municipality may become obligated upon an implied
contract to pay the reasonable value of the benefits accepted or
appropriated by it as to which it has the general power to contract.
The doctrine of implied municipal liability applies to all cases
where money or other property of a party is received under such
circumstance that the general Jaw, independent of express contract
implies an obligation upon the municipality to do justice with respect
to the same.
7.
In Olongapo Electric Light & Power Corporation v.
National Power Corporation, 149 SCRA 153, a municipal corporation
is not prevented from constructing and operating a competing plant,
although a franchise had been granted a private company for a
similar public utility, provided the franchise is not exclusive.
8.
A municipal corporation may sue and be sued, and
contract and be contracted with. A municipal corporation can be held
liable to third persons ex contractu. (City of Manila u. Intermediate
Appellate Court, 179 SCRA 428.)
B.

Additional Cases

1.
Since a contract for street cleaning is a contract creating
an indebtedness against the municipality within the meaning of
General Orders No. 40, it requires for its validity the concurrence of
the majority of the members of the municipal council. The municipal
attorney is not authorized to enter into such contract. (Acura v.
Municipality of Iloilo, 2 Phil. 217, 1903.)
2.
The municipality of Moncada, during the existence of a
valid contract of lease, must be held responsible for damages for its
illegal acts in forcibly ejecting the lessee. (Municipality of Moncada
v. Cajuigan, 21 Phil. 184, 1912.)
3.
In the administration of its patrimonial property, a
municipal corporation can be regarded as a private corporation or
individual insofar as its liability to third persons on contract or in
tort is concerned. The members of the municipal council are liable

114

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Book I General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

116

for damages for the unlawful rescission of the contract of lease of the
ferry. In the case at bar, there is not a scintilla of evidence that there
was any justifiable reason for forcibly evicting the plaintiff from the
ferry which he had leased. It cannot be said that in rescinding the
contract with the plaintiff, the defendant councilors were honestly
acting for the interests of the municipality. Defendants, therefore,
should be held liable jointly and severally for the damages sustained
by the plaintiff from the rescission of the contract of lease of the
ferry in question. (Mendoza v. De Leon, 33 Phil. 508, 1916.)

Ruling: Based on the foregoing discussion, there
appear two basic premises from which the Court can proceed
to discuss the question of whether prior approval by the
Sangguniang Panlalawigan was required before Gov. Garcia
could have validly entered into the questioned contracts. First,
the Province of Cebu was operating under a reenacted
budget in 2004. Second, Gov. Garcia entered into
contracts on behalf of the province while this reenacted
budget was in force.

4.
To give life to the obvious intendment of the law and to
avoid a construction which would render Section 22(c) of R.A. No.
7160 meaningless, disbursement, as used in Section 346, should be
understood to pertain to payments for statutory and contractual
obligations which the sanggunian has already authorized thru
ordinances enacting the annual budget and are therefore already
subsisting obligations of the local government unit. Contracts, as
used in Section 22(c) on the other hand, are those which bind the
local government unit to new obligations, with their corresponding
terms and conditions, for which the local chief executive needs prior
authority from the sanggunian.

The fact that the Province of Cebu operated under a
reenacted budget in 2004 lent a complexion to this case which
the trial court did not apprehend. Sec. 323 of R.A. No. 7160
provides that in case of a reenacted budget, "only the annual
appropriations for salaries and wages of existing positions,
statutory and contractual obligations, and essential operating
expenses authorized in the annual and supplemental budgets
for the preceding year shall be deemed reenacted and
disbursement of funds shall be in accordance therewith."

QUISUMBING v. GARCIA
573 SCRA 266, December 8, 2008, Tinga, J.
Facts: The Commission on Audit (COA) conducted a
financial audit on the Province of Cebu for the period ending
December 2004. Its audit team rendered a report, Part II
of which states: "Several contracts in the total amount of
P102,092,841.47 were not supported with a Sangguniang
Panlalawigan resolution authorizing the Provincial Governor
to enter into a contract, as required under Section 22 ofR.A. No.
7160." The audit team then recommended that, "Henceforth,
the local chief executive must secure a sanggunian resolution
authorizing the former to enter into a contract as provided
under Section 22 of R.A. No. 7160.2"
Alleging that the infrastructure contracts subject of the
audit report complied with the bidding procedures provided
under R.A. No. 9184 and were entered into pursuant to the
general and/or supplemental appropriation ordinances passed
by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, Gov. Gwendolyn Garcia
alleged that a separate authority to enter into such contracts
was no longer necessary.

It should be observed that, as indicated by the word "only"
preceding the above enumeration in Sec. 323, the items for
which disbursements may be made under a reenacted budget
are exclusive. Clearly, contractual obligations which were
not included in the previous year's annual and supplemental
budgets cannot be disbursed by the local government unit. It
follows, too, that new contracts entered into by the local chief
executive require the prior approval of the sanggunian.
And so, to give life to the obvious intendment of the law
and to avoid a construction which would render Sec. 22(c) of
R.A. No. 7160 meaningless, disbursement, as used in Sec. 346,
should be understood to pertain to payments for statutory and
contractual obligations which the sanggunian has already
authorized thru ordinances enacting the annual budget
and are therefore already subsisting obligations of the local
government unit. Contracts, as used in Sec. 22(c) on the other
hand, are those which bind the local government unit to new
obligations, with their corresponding terms and conditions, for
which the local chief executive needs prior authority from the

sanggunian.
Sec. 465, Art. 1, Chapter 3 and Sec. 468, Art. 3, Chapter
3, LGC inexorably confirms the indispensability of the
sanggunian's authorization in the execution of contracts which

bind the local government unit to new obligations. Note should
be taken of the fact that R.A. No. 7160 does not expressly
state the form that the authorization by the sanggunian has
to take. Such authorization may be done by resolution enacted
in the same manner prescribed by ordinances, except that
the resolution need not go through a third reading for final
consideration unless the majority of all the members of the
sanggunian decides otherwise.
The question of whether a sanggunian authorization
separate from the appropriation ordinance is required should
be resolved depending on the particular circumstances of
the case. Resort to the appropriation ordinance is necessary
in order to determine if there is a provision therein which
specifically covers the expense to be incurred or the contract
to be entered into. Should the appropriation ordinance, for
instance, already contain in sufficient detail the project and cost
of a capital outlay such that all that the local chief executive
needs to do after undergoing the requisite public bidding is to
execute the contract, no further authorization is required, the
appropriation ordinance already being sufficient.
On the other hand, should the appropriation ordinance
describe the projects in generic terms such as "infrastructure
projects," "inter-municipal waterworks, drainage and sewerage,
flood control, and irrigation systems projects," "reclamation
projects" or "roads and bridges," there is an obvious need for a
covering contract for every specific project that in turn requires
approval by the sanggunian. Specific sanggunian approval
may also be required for the purchase of goods and services
which are neither specified in the appropriation ordinance
nor encompassed within the regular personal services and
maintenance operating expenses.
WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED IN PART. The
Decision of the RTC of Cebu City, and its Order are REVERSED
and SET ASIDE. The case is REMAN DED to the court a quo
for further proceedings in accordance with this Decision.
6.
Since the 2001 Economic Development Fund was a lumpsum amount not yet apportioned to specified development projects,
Verceles needed to secure prior authority from the SP. Having failed
to secure prior authority, the first MOA was unauthorized and
properly disallowed. However, the COA gravely abused its discretion

117

Book I General Provisions
Title One - Basic Principles

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

h it disallowed the third MOA and insisted that Verceles should
1,
,,'~read a separate and additional authority from the SP. The
COA ignored Section 3 of the CY 2002 appropriation ordinance,
which specifically identified the tree seedlings production project
with a P3,000,000.00 allocation.
VERCELES, JR. v. COMMISSION ON AUDIT
802 SCRA 504, September 13, 2016, Brion, d.
Facts: The Provincial Government of Catanduanes,
represented by then Governor Leandro B. Verceles, Jr., engaged
the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office
(PENRO) to carry out the province's tree seedlings production
project. The province and PENRO entered into several MOAs
to implement the project.
On June 11, 2001, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan,
through Resolution No. 067-2001, gave blanket authority to
the governor to enter into contracts on behalf of the province.
The SP reaffirmed the authority given to the governor through
Resolution Nos. 068-2001 and 069-2001. On the same date,
the SP also resolved to give the governor the power to realign,
revise, or modify items in the provincial budget••••
The cost of the project was allegedly paid out of the
Economic Development Fund (EDF) allocation in the provincial
budget for calendar years (CY) 2001 and 2002. The EDF is the
20% portion of the province's internal revenue allotment (IRA)
required by law to be spent on development projects.

On October 12, 2001, the SP issued Resolution No. 104-A2001, which effectively revoked the blanket authority given ta
the governor ta enter into contracts on behalf of the Province.
On February 4, 2003, the COA Audit Team Leader
issued an Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM), finding
that Verceles should have sought prior authority from the SP
pursuant ta Sections 22 (c) and 465 (b) (1) (vi) of Republic Act
No. 7160 or the Local Government Code (LGC) before executing
any MOA after the issuance of Resolution No. 104-A-2001.

Ruling: The prior authorization for the local chief executive
to enter into contracts on behalf of the local government unit
may be in the form of an appropriation ordinance passed for
the year which specifically covers the project, cost, or contract
to be entered into by the local government unit.

ll9

Explained simply, the LGC (Sec. 22 [cl) requires the
local chief executive to secure prior authorization from the
sanggunian before he can enter into contracts on behalf of the
LGU. A separate prior authorization is no longer required if
the specific projects are covered by appropriations (Sec. 306 [bl)
in the annual budget of the LGU. 'The appropriation ordinance
passed by the sanggunian is the local chief executive's authority
to enter into a contract implementing the project.
In summary and to harmonize the two provisions: Section
22 (c) of the LGC requires the local chief executive ta obtain
prior authorization from the sanggunian before he can enter
into contracts in behalf of the LGU. Section 465 (b) (1) (vi), on
the other hand, allows the local chief executive ta implement
specific or specified projects with corresponding appropriations
without securing a separate authority from the sanggunian.
In the latter provision, the appropriation ordinance is the
authority from the sanggunian required in the former provision.
We now apply these parameters to the present case.
Verceles claims that SP Resolution No. 67-2001 (affirmed
in SP Resolution Nos. 68-2001 and 69-2001) all dated June
11, 2001 authorized him to enter into the first MOA dated
September 27, 2001. We do not find this position persuasive.
The relevant portions of these resolutions were similarly
worded, thus:
BE IT RESOLVED, as it is hereby-resolved, to
authorize, as it is hereby authorized, the Provincial
Governor to enter into, for and in behalf of Catanduanes,
and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan approving herein,
all memoranda of agreement, contracts or other
undertakings with national government agencies, other
local government units and other public and private
entities, as may be allowable by law, granting them the
authority to undertake for and on behalf of the provincial
government of Catanduanes activities, such as, but not
limited to, bidding and implementation of projects and
programs, acquisition of supplies and other undertakings.
Undeniably, these SP resolutions gave the provincial
governor the blanket authority to enter into contracts on behalf
of the Province. The question is whether a blanket authority is

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

120

a sufficient authority for the governor to implement projects
that have no definite appropriations.
We answer in the negative.
While a blanket authority is not per se ineffective, it does not
suffice for purposes of implementing projects funded by lumpsum appropriations. The nature of lump-sum appropriations
vis-a-vis the power of the purse of the SP (as the legislative
organ of the LGU) requires the local chief executive to obtain
definite and specific authorizations before he can enter into
contracts funded by lump-sum appropriations. The exception
is when the appropriation ordinance already identifies the
specific projects and the costs of the projects to be funded by
lump-sum appropriations.
Since the 2001 EDF was a lump-sum amount not yet
apportioned to specified development projects, Verceles needed
to secure prior authority from the SP. Having failed to secure
prior authority, the first MOA was unauthorized and properly
disallowed. Applying the standards discussed above, we find
that the third MOA was duly funded and authorized by the
CY 2002 appropriation ordinance of the province. Section 3 of
Appropriation Ordinance No. 2002-001 provides:
Section 3. The Lump-Sum Appropriation for the 20%
Economic Development Fund (EDF) is Forty Five Million
One Hundred Twelve Thousand One Hundred Eighty Six
Pesos & 80/100 (P45,112,186.80)
Special Provision:
1.
Use and release of fund - The amount herein
appropriated shall strictly adhere to the policies and
guidelines provided under DILG Memo Circular No.
95-216 dated December 14, 1995 in conjunction with
Section 106 of RA 7160 and the CY 2002 Multi-Sectoral
Development Plan of the Province as initiated by the
Catanduanes Development Council (CDC) and approved
by the Sanggunian Panlalawigan and hereto incorporated
in this Ordinance, to wit:
XXX

Book I General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

121

In stark contrast to the previous year's EDF, the CY 2002
appropriation ordinance clearly, specifically and expressly
set aside P3,000,000.00 to fund the tree seedlings production
project of the Province. This served as sufficient authority for
Verceles to execute the third MOA.
Thus, the GOA gravely abused its discretion when it
disallowed the third MOA and insisted that Verceles should
have secured a separate and additional authority from the
SP. The COA ignored Section 3 of the CY 2002 appropriation
ordinance, which specifically identified the tree seedlings
production project with a P3,000,000.00 allocation.
We Partly Grant the petition. The Notices of Disallowance
which covered the third MOA are annulled.

presented under Sec. 336, LGC on Use of Appropriated Funds
and Savings)

The subject line-item "Consultancy Services" is found in

GERMAR v. LEGASPI
G.R. No. 232532, October 1, 2018, Reyes, A., J.
Facts: After the May 2013 elections, the Municipality of
Norzagaray, Bulacan witnessed a change of administration.
The petitioner, Alfredo G. Germar, won the mayoralty position.
He replaced the former mayor, respondent Feliciano P. Legaspi.
During Germar's term, he entered into contracts for
professional service with six (6) consultants.
On October 28, 2014, a year into Germar's service as the
mayor of the municipality, Legaspi filed a complaint against the
former, together with the six (6) consultants and the Municipal
Human Resources Officer of the municipality, before the Office
of the Ombudsman (0MB).
In the administrative aspect of the complaint, which is
the subject matter of this case, Legaspi averred that Germar
entered into these contracts of professional service without the
prior authorization of the Sangguniang Bayan. This, Legaspi

122

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

asserted, is a violation of Section 444 of the Local Government
Code, which deals with the powers, duties, function, and
compensation of the local chief executive.
Germar was found guilty of grave misconduct by the
Ombudsman which was affirmed by the CA, and was meted
the penalty of dismissal.
Ruling: In this case, the Sangguinang Bayan's
appropriation ordinance for the fiscal year 2013 indicated
a budget of P250,859,675.00 to be sourced from the general
fund and P279,565,093.62 to be sourced from the special fund.
Of these amounts, Section 4 of the appropriation ordinance
allocated P40,609,457.62 to the "Mayor's Office." While this
allocation contained no specific line-item, Section 1 of the same
ordinance provided for the incorporation of several documents
to be made as integral part thereof. Particularly, it included
the budget document denominated as "Budget of Expenditures
and Sources of Financing." A review of the records revealed
that among the attachments to the appropriation ordinance is
LBP Form No. 3, "Programmed Appropriation and Obligation
by Object of Expenditure," the first three (3) pages of which
pertained to the budget of the Office of the Mayor.
The Object of Expenditures for the Office of the Mayor
is categorized into three: (1) Current Operating Expenditures,
(2) Capital Outlay, and (3) Special Purpose Appropriation.
The Current Operating Expenditures is further divided into
two sub-categories: (1) Personal Services and (2) Maintenance
and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE). The subject line-item
"Consultancy Services" is found in the MOOE along with other
line-items such as travelling expenses, training expenses,
representation expenses, and intelligence expenses.
In effect, therefore, the subject line-item in this case,
like the other line-items in the appropriations ordinance,
is a specific allocation to a specific purpose for the specific
maintenance and operating expense of a specific office. In the
language used in Belgica, this line-item which is found in the
MOOE of the Office of the Mayor shall already be deemed
sufficiently specific.
More, the delineation propounded by the Court in
Verceles is likewise followed in the case at hand. The cost-in
this case P900,000.00, or contract-in this case the contract

Book I
General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

123

for professional services entered into by Germar, has been
properly and clearly identified in the appropriations ordinance.
It remains apparent that an authorization from the
Sangguniang Bayan, which is separate from the appropriations
ordinance for the fiscal year 2013, is not warranted. Germar's
action of entering into contracts of professional service with the
six (6) consultants could not be considered as a transgression
of an established and definite rule of action, nor could it be
considered a forbidden act, a dereliction of duty, or an unlawful
behavior. Neither is there any willful intent to violate the
law or any willful intent to disregard established rules for
clearly, Germar's action is within the parameters of the law as
established by the Court in the cases of Quisumbing and Verceles.
The decisions of the CA and Ombudsman are hereby
REVERSED and SET ASIDE.
SEC. 23. Authority to Negotiate and Secure
Local chief executives may, upon
authority of the sanggunian, negotiate and secure
financial grants or donations in kind, in support of
the basic services or facilities enumerated under
Section 17 hereof, from local and foreign assistance
agencies without necessity of securing clearance
or approval therefor from any department, agency,
or office of the National Government or from any
higher local government unit: Provided, That
projects financed by such grants or assistance with
national security implications shall be approved by
the national agency concerned: Provided, further,
That when such national agency fails to act on the
request for approval within thirty (30) days from
receipt thereof, the same shall be deemed approved.

Grants.

The local chief executive shall, within thirty
(30) days upon signing of such grant agreement or
deed of donation, report the nature, amount and
terms of such assistance to both Houses of Congress
and the President.
SEC. 24. Liability for Damages.
Local
government units and their officials are not exempt
from liability for death or injury to persons or
damage to property.

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Boo k I General Provisions
Title One -- Basic Principles

1.
The New Civil Code contains provisions on some liabilities
of local government units:

5.
In the performance of its governmental functions, a
municipal corporation, like the City of Manila, acts as an agent of
the State, and, as such, it is immune from suit unless consent thereto
has been given; such consent must be expressed in unequivocal
language. (Department of Public Services Labor Unions v. Court of

124

A.

Comm ents

"ART. 34. NCC. When a member of a city or municipal
police force refuses or fails to render aid or protection to
any person in case of danger to life or property, such peace
officer shall be primarily liable for damages, and the city or
municipality shall be subsidiarily responsible thereof. The civil
action herein recognized shall be independent of any criminal
proceedings, and a preponderance of evidence shall suffice to
support such action.
ART. 2189, NCC. Provinces, cities, and municipalities
shall be liable for damages for the death of, or injuries suffered
by, any person by reason of the defective condition of roads,
streets, bridges, public buildings, and other public works under
their control and supervision."
2.
Municipal corporations are said to possess two kinds of
functions: the public or governmental and the private or proprietary.
A municipal corporation is not liable for the acts of its officers
or agents in the performance of its governmental functions. The
doctrine is based upon the sovereign character of the state and its
agencies. But in the performance of its corporate functions, it is
to be regarded as a private corporation or individual so far as its
liability to third persons on contract or in tort is concerned. Where
the councilors acted without reason, they are personally liable.
The true test therefore is where the public corporation is
performing governmental functions as an agency of the state, it
shares the state's exemption from tort liability; where it is attending
to what are primarily local matters, it is liable. (Mendoza v. de Leon,

33 Phil. 508.)
3.
American courts generally consider liability for defects
in streets as an exception to the rule of immunity in case of
governmental functions, if it be shown that the municipality had
notice of the defect of the streets. (Todd v. City of Roy, 61 N. Y. 506.)
4.
A municipal corporation exercising proprietary functions
is on the same footing as a private corporation. Its governing board
or municipal council is not liable solidarily for acts committed by its
employees unless there is bad faith or wanton negligence on their
part. (Torio v. Fontanilla, 85 SCRA 599.)

125

Industrial Relations, 1 SCRA 316.)
6.
The municipality cannot be held liable for the torts by
its regular employee who was then engaged in the discharge of
governmental functions. (Municipality of San Fernando, La Union

v. Firme, 195 SCRA 692.)
B.

Additional Decided Cases

1.
It is not necessary for liability to attach to the City of
Manila that the defective road or street belong to it. It is sufficient
that it has either control or supervision over the street or road. (City

of Manila • Teotico, 22 SCRA 267,1968.)
2.
Defendant Province of Pangasinan is liable for
constructing a pumping plant in such close proximity to plaintiffs
residence practically rendering the same uninhabitable. Under
such circumstance, the maintenance of the nuisance is practically
tantamount to an expropriation. (Bengzon v. Province ofPangasinan,

62 Phil. 816, 1968.)
3.
The province is not liable for the acts of its driver assigned
in the District Engineers Office in the construction of roads which
is a governmental activity, who ran over a pedestrian. (Palafox v.

Province of Ilocos Norte, 102 Phil. 1186, 1958.)
4.
Since the holding of a town fiesta is an exercise of a
proprietary function, the Municipality of Malasiqui is liable for
any injury sustained on the occasion thereof. The stage constructed
collapsed and the deceased was pinned to death. (Toro • Fontanilla,

85 SCRA 599, 1978.)

of their prescribed powers and functions.
The President shall exercise supervisory
authority directly over provinces, highly urbanized

technical, or other forms of assistance to the
local government unit. Such assistance shall be
extended at no extra cost to the local government
unit concerned.
(d) National agencies and offices including

concerned, for his information and guidance,
monthly reports including duly certified budgetary
allocations and expenditures.

History

The central-local relationship is a product of its own peculiar
historical traditions. No generalizations are possible. Social forces
are the crucial determinants. In the Philippines, a peculiar blending
of the two extremes: complete centralization v. substantial local
autonomy is found.

Book I General Provisions
Title One Basic Principles

127

The principal determinants or factors of Philippine Centralism
are:
a.
Philippine political behavior: extreme respect for
authority. Men, not laws, constitute much of the real content of
authority. This is historical, i.e., from the Datu to the GovernorGeneral (Spanish) to the Governor-General (American) to the
President.
b.
Spanish destruction of early Philippine culture;
except insofar as it was adaptable to Spanish administration.
The Datu acted as agent of the Spanish initially. Later,
it methodically destroyed the basis of the barangay and
weakened the power of the Datu. The barangays were
consolidated into pueblos (towns) and these assumed most of
the barangay functions. Subsequently, the Spaniards changed
the name of this unit from barangay to barrio; and the cabeza
de barangay became known as the barrio lieutenant. Thus,
these two indigenous institutions, the barangay and datu were
transformed by the Spaniards into artificial entities lacking
historical popular roots.
c.
Lack of Popular Governmental tradition: unfamiliarity
of Filipinos with Western political concepts and institutions.
Even today, the central and local political entities are foreign
to Filipino culture. The centralized Spanish system involving
a chain of responsibility was deemed admirably suited to
the military government (American). Later civil authorities
replaced the military but, except for changing the name of all
pueblos to municipalities, giving them a corporate status in
Jaw, there were only half-hearted attempts to strengthen local
autonomy.
d.
Shortage of trained personnel for local government:
deficient in reading comprehension and job techniques. They
also lacked local funds. Therefore, there was continued central
intervention.
e.
Control through Administrative measure; review
of local budgets, financial assistance, field inspections and
periodic reports by local officials. There was also this threat of
removal and suspension by the President.
f.
Nationalism: desire for independence through unity.
Greater unity was believed to be achieved under a greater unit
of policy and administration under a centralized government.

Past and Present Causes.")

B.

Decided Cases

1.
The constitutional grant to the President of general
supervision over all local governments and to take care that the
laws be faithfully executed must be construed to authorize him to
order an investigation of the act or conduct of the petitioner Planas,
a member of the municipal board o (sic) the City of Manila, who
caused the publication in the local daily where she criticized the
acts of certain government officials in connection with the general
election of assemblymen held on Nov. 11, 1938. (Planas v. Gil, 67
Phil. 62, 1939.)
2.
The Secretary of the Interior is vested with authority
to order the investigation of the charges against petitioner and to
appoint a special investigator for the purpose. However, there is no
clear and express grant of power to the secretary to suspend Mayor
Villena of Makati, Rizal who is under investigation. (Villena v.
Secretary of Interior, 67 Phil. 451, 1939.)
3.
The power of the President to remove or suspend the
mayor of the City of Manila is confined to clisloyalty to the Republic
or, at the most, following the opinion of three justices, for causes
stipulated under Section 2078 of the Revised Administrative Code.
The suspension of the mayor for no other reason than the pendency
of a criminal case for libel, is outside the bounds of express or
unwritten law. General supervision does not contemplate control.
(Lacson v. Roque, 92 Phil. 456, 1953.)
4.
The department head, as agent of the President, does not
have control of local governments as that exercised by him over all
bureaus and offices under his jurisdiction. Likewise, his authority
to order the investigation of any act or conduct of any person in the
service of any bureau or office does not extend to local governments
over which the President exercises only general supervision.

129

MONDANO v. SILVOSA
97 Phil. 143, May 30, 1955, Padilla, J.
Facts: The petitioner is the duly elected and qualified
mayor of the municipality of Mainit, province of Surigao.
On 27 February 1954 Consolation Vda. de Mosende filed
a sworn complaint with the Presidential Complaints and
Action Committee accusing h.im of: (1) rape committed on her
daughter Caridad Mosende; and (2) concubinage for cohabiting
with her daughter in a place other than the conjugal dwelling.
On 6 March the Assistant Executive Secretary indorsed the
complaint to the respondent provincial governor for immediate
investigation, appropriate action and report.
On 10 April the petitioner appeared before the provincial
governor, in obedience to his summons and was served with
a copy of the complaint filed by the provincial governor with
the provincial board. On the same day, the provincial governor
issued Administrative Order No. 8 suspending the petitioner
from office. Thereafter, the Provincial Board proceeded to hear
the charges against the petitioner over h.is objection.

Held: Section 10, paragraph 1, Article VII, of the 1935
Constitution provides: "The President shall have control of
all the executive departments, bureaus, or offices, exercises
general supervision over all local governments as may be
provided by law, and take care that the laws be faithfully
executed." The authority of a Department Head to order the
investigation of any act or conduct of any person in the service
of any bureau or office under his departments is confined to
bureaus or offices under his jurisdiction and does not extend to
local governments over which, as already stated, the President
exercises only general supervision as may be provided by law.
In administrative law supervision means overseeing or
the power or authority of an officer to see that subordinate
officers perform their duties. If the latter fail or neglect to fulfill
them the former may take such action or step as prescribed
by law to make them perform their duties. Control, on the
other hand, means the power of an officer to alter or modify or
nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the
performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the
former for that of the latter.

130

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

In the endorsement to the provincial governor, the
Assistant Executive Secretary requested immediate investigation,
appropriate action and report on the complaint indorsed to
him, and called his attention to Section 2193 of the Revised
Administrative Code which provides for the institution of
juclicial proceedings by the provincial fiscal upon direction of
the provincial governor. If the endorsement of the Assistant
Executive Secretary be taken as a designation of the provincial
governor to investigate the petitioner, then he would only be
acting as agent of the Executive, but the investigation to be
conducted by him would not be that which is provided for in
Sections 2188, 2189 and 2190 of the Revised Administration
Code.
The charges preferred against the respondent are not
malfeasances or any of those enumerated or specified in
Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative Code, because
rape and concubinage have nothing to do with the performance
of his duties as mayor nor do they constitute or involve
"neglect of duty, oppression, corruption or any other form of
maladministration of office." True, they may involve moral
turpitude, but before the provincial governor and board may
act and proceed in accordance with the provisions of the
Revised Administrative Code referred to, a conviction by final
judgment must precede the filing by the provincial governor of
charges and trial by the provincial board. Even the provincial
fiscal cannot file an information for rape without a sworn
complaint of the offended party who is 28 years of age and the
crime of concubinage cannot be prosecuted but upon a sworn
complaint of the offended spouse.

jurisdiction pertains to the Provincial Governor and the Provincial
Board.
HEBRON v. REYES
104 Phil. 175, July 28, 1958, Concepcion, J.
Facts: Petitioner Hebron and respondent Reyes were
elected mayor and vice-mayor respectively, in the elections
held in 1951 for the orclinary four-year term. Petitioner
discharged the duties and functions as such mayor until May
24, 1954 when he received a communication from the Office
of the President informing him that administrative charges
for alleged oppression, grave abuse of authority and serious
misconduct had been filed against him. He was suspended
from office until the final termination of the administrative
proceedings. Respondent Reyes, as vice-mayor, was directed to
assume the office of acting mayor of Carmona, Cavite.

The writ of prohibition prayed for is granted.

Held: The issue in this case is whether or not a municipal
mayor could be removed or suspended directly by the President
regardless of the procedure set forth in the RAC. In the case
at bar, the Provincial Board of Cavite never had a chance to
investigate the charges against petitioner. From the [e]very
beginning the office of the Executive assumed authority to act
on said charges under such conditions as to give the impression
that the Provincial Governor and the Provincial Board, were
banned from exercising said authority. The Supreme Court is
unable to see, how the assumption of authority may be justified,
either under the power of general supervision or under the
duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. Under
the present law, the executive department of the national
government, in the exercise of its general supervision over
local governments, may conduct investigations with a view to
determining whether municipal officials are guilty of acts or
omissions warranting the administrative action referred to in
Secs. 2188-2191, as a means only to determine whether the
provincial governor and the provincial board should take such
action, and the Executive may take appropriate measures to
compel the provincial governor and the provincial board to take
said action, if the same is warranted and they failed to do so.

5.
The President may not directly assume jurisdiction
regarding the suspension or removal of a public officer. Such

However, the Executive may not deprive the provincial
governor and the provincial board of the power to exercise the
authority conferred upon them in Secs. 2188--2190 of the RAC,

The charges preferred against the petitioner, municipal
mayor of Mainit, province of Surigao, not being those or any of
those specified in Section 2188 of the Revised Administrative
Code, the investigation of such charges by the provincial board
is unauthorized and illegal, The suspension of the petitioner as
mayor of the municipality of Mainit is, consequently, unlawful
and without authority of Jaw.

132

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

for the procedure prescribed in said sections for the suspension
and removal of the municipal officials is mandatory, and in
the absence of a clear and explicit provision to the contrary,
relative particularly to municipal corporations, said procedure
is exclusive.
6.
Although heads of local governments may be under the
supervision of the Secretary of Local Governments, local governments
are not attached to the Department of Local Governments. Local
government units have their own legislative and executive powers
under the Local Government Code.

RADIA v. REVIEW COMMITTEE UNDER
EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 17
157 SCRA 749, January 29, 1988, Feliciano, J.
Ruling: Although heads of local governments like
provincial governors and municipal mayors may be under
the supervision of the Secretary of Local Governments, local
governments are not "attached to" the Department of Local
Governments in the same sense that Bureaus and Offices
under, for instance, the Department of Justice are attached
to that department. Provinces and Municipalities are
instrumentalities or units of local government vested with
their own legislative and executive powers under the Local
Government Code.
The present Local Government Code of 1991 likewise
provides for general supervision not control by the President
over local government units.
7.

What is the relation of the President to local governments?

Under the 1935 Constitution, Article VII, Section 10(1), the
President was authorized to "exercise general supervision over local
governments as may be provided by law." Thus, not only was the
President given merely supervisory powers (not control, but merely
ensuring that laws are followed,) but he possessed only so much
supervisory power as was given to him by statute. This is the power
relation that comes out very clearly in the leading case of Hebron u.
Reyes, 104 Phil. 175 (1958). Moreover, the inference could be drawn
from Pelaez v. Auditor General, 11 SCRA 569 (1965), that Congress
could not expand the power of the President to one of control.

Book I General Provisions
Title One - Basic Principles

133

The 1973 Constitution as amended does not state what the
relation should be between local governments and the President.
However, Article VII, Section 16 says: "All powers vested in the
President of the Philippines under the nineteen hundred and thirtyfive Constitution and laws of the land which are not herein provided
for or conferred upon any official shall be deemed, and are hereby,
vested, in the President, unless the Batasang Pambansa provides
otherwise." Thus, again, the relation of local governments with
executive power is determinable by the legislature. However, it is
submitted that is would not be within the powers of the Batasang
Pambansa to give the President powers amounting to control,
because the thrust of Article XI is towards greater and not lesser
local autonomy.
And the legislature through Section 14 of the Local Government
Code of 1983 has provided that "the President shall exercise general
supervision over local governments."
Local governments are subject, not to the control, but merely
to the general supervision of the President; it is to say the least,
doubtful that the latter could have made compliance with said
circular obligatory. (Serafica u. Treasurer of Ormoc City, 27 SCRA
1108.)
If the President himself exercises only "general supervision"
as may be provided by law over local officials, the Commissioner of
the Civil Service cannot be deemed to possess a greater prerogative,
being himself an official of a lower category in the executive branch.
(Villegas v. Subido, 30 SCRA 498.)
Section 4, Art. X of the 1987 Constitution provides that the
President, shall exercise general supervision over local governments.
Under Section 25, LGC of 1991, the President shall exercise
general supervision over local government units.
8.
As the entity exercising supervision over the Liga ng mga
Barangay, the DILG's authority over the Liga is limited to seeing
to it that the rules are followed, but it cannot lay down such rules
itself, nor does it have the discretion to modify or replace them. In
this particular case, the most that the DILG could do was review
the acts of the incumbent officers of the Liga in the conduct of the
elections to determine if they committed any violation of the Liga's
Constitution and By-laws and its implementing rules. Like the
local government units, the Liga ng mga Barangay is not subject to
control by the Chief Executive or his alter ego.

NATIONAL LIGA NG MGA BARANGAY
v.PAREDES
439 SCRA 130, September 27, 2004, Tinga, J.
Facts: On 11 June 1997, private respondent Manuel A.
Rayos [as petitioner therein], Punong Barangay of Barangay
52, District 11, Zone 5, District II, Caloocan City, filed a petition
for prohibition and mandamus, with prayer for a writ of
preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining order and
damages before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Caloocan,
alleging that respondent therein Alex L. David [now petitioner],
Punong Barangay of Barangay 77, Zone 7, Caloocan City and
then president of the Liga Chapter of Caloocan City and of the
Liga ng mga Barangay National Chapter, committed certain
irregularities in the notice, venue and conduct of the proposed
synchronized Liga ng mga Barangay elections in 1997.
On 17 July 1997, respondent Rayos filed a second petition,
this time for quo warranto, mandamus and prohibition, with
prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary
restraining order and damages, against David, Nancy Quimpo,
Presiding Officer of the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Caloocan
City, and Secretary Barbers.
Before the consolidation of the cases, on 25 July 1997,
the DILG through respondent Secretary Barbers, filed in SCA
No. C-512 an Urgent Motion, invoking the President's power
of general supervision over all local government units and
seeking the following reliefs:
a)
That the Department of the Interior and Local
Government (DILG), pursuant to its delegated power
of general supervision, be appointed as the Interim
Caretaker to manage and administer the affairs of the
Liga, until such time that the new set of National Liga
Officers shall have been duly elected and assumed
office; ...
Ruling: Even before the respondent Judge designated
the DILG as interim caretaker of the Liga, on 28 July 1997, the
DILG issued Memorandum Circular No. 97-176, directing local
government officials not to recognize David as the National
Liga President and his pronouncements relating to the affairs

Book I- General Provisions
Title One - Basic Principles

136

of the Liga. Not only was the action premature, it even smacked
of superciliousness and injudiciousness.
When the respondent judge eventually appointed the
DILG as interim caretaker to manage and administer the
affairs of the Liga, she effectively removed the management
from the National Liga Board and vested control of the Liga
on the DILG.
With his Department already appointed as interim
caretaker of the Liga, Secretary Barbers nullified the results
of the Liga elections and promulgated DILG Memorandum
Circular No. 97-193 dated 11 August 1997, where he laid
down the supplemental guidelines for the 1997 synchronized
elections of the provincial and metropolitan chapters and for the
election of the national chapter of the Liga ng mga Barangay;
scheduled dates for the new provincial, metropolitan and
national chapter elections; and appointed respondent Rayos as
president of Liga-Caloocan Chapter.
These acts of the DILG went beyond the sphere of general
supervision and constituted direct interference with the
political affairs, not only of the Liga, but more importantly,
of the barangay as an institution. The election of Liga officers
is part of the Liga's internal organization, for which the latter
has already provided guidelines. In succession, the DILG
assumed stewardship and jurisdiction over the Liga affairs,
issued supplemental guidelines for the election, and nullified
the effects of the Liga-conducted elections. Clearly, what
the DILG wielded was the power of control which even the
President does not have.
In this particular case, the most that the DILG could do
was review the acts of the incumbent officers of the Liga in
the conduct of the elections to determine if they committed
any violation of the Liga's Constitution and By-laws and its
implementing rules. If the National Liga Board and its officers
had violated Liga rules, the DILG should have ordered the
Liga to conduct another election in accordance with the Liga's
own rules, but not in obeisance to DILG-dictated guidelines.
Neither had the DILG the authority to remove the incumbent
officers of the Liga and replace them, even temporarily, with
unelected Liga officers.

The Court is convinced that the assailed order was issued
with grave abuse of discretion while the acts of the respondent
Secretary, including DILG Memorandum Circulars No. 97-176

Decided Cases

1.
The introduction of lotto in the province of Laguna is not
covered by Sections 26 and 27 (on Prior Consultations Required) of
the LGC.
LINA, JR. v. PANO
364 SCRA 76, August 30, 2001, Quisumbing, J.
Facts: (See supra)
Held: We hold that petitioners erred in declaring that
Sections 2(c) Declaration of Policy) and 27 (Prior Consultations
Required) of Republic Act 7160, apply mandatorily in the
setting up of lotto outlets around the country.
These apply only to national programs and/or projects
which are to be implemented in a particular local community.
Lotto is neither a program nor a project of the national
government, but of a charitable institution, the PCSO. Though
sanctioned by the national government, it is far fetched to say
that lotto falls within the contemplation of Sections 2(c) and 27
of the Local Government Code.
Section 27 of the Code should be read in conjunction with
Section 26 (Duty of National Government Agencies in the
Maintenance of Ecological Balance thereof).
The projects and programs mentioned in Section 27
should be interpreted to mean projects and programs whose
effects are among those enumerated in Sections 26 and 27, to
wit, those that: (1) may cause pollution; (2) may bring about
climatic change; (3) may cause the depletion of non-renewable
resources; (4) may result in loss of crop land, range-land, or
forest cover; (5) may eradicate certain animal or plant species
from the face of the planet; and (6) other projects or programs
that may call for the eviction of a particular group of people
residing in the locality where these will be implemented.
Obviously, none of these effects will be produced by the
introduction of lotto in the province of Laguna.

PICOP had claimed that it complied with the Local
Government Code requirement of obtaining prior approval of the
Sanggunian concerned by submitting a purported resolution of
the Province of Surigao del Sur indorsing the approval of PICOP's

138

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

application for IFMA conversion. We rule that this cannot be deemed
sufficient compliance with the foregoing provision. Surigao de! Sur
is not the only province affected by the area covered by the proposed
IFMA. PICOP's 'TLA No. 43 traverses the length and breadth not
only of Surigao de] Sur but also of Agusan de] Sur, Compostela
Valley and Davao Oriental.

ALVAREZ v. PICOP RESOURCES, INC.
508 SCRA 498, December 3, 2009, Chico-Nazario, J.
Facts: PICOP Resources, Inc. filed with the Department
of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) an application
to have its Timber License Agreement (TLA) No. 43 converted
into an Integrated Forest Management Agreement (IFMA). In
the middle of the processing of PICOP's application, however,
PICOP refused to attend further meetings with the DENR.
Instead, on 2 September 2002, PICOP filed before the RTC
of Quezon City a Petition for Mandamus against then DENR
Secretary Heherson T. Alvarez. PI COP seeks the issuance of a
privileged writ of mandamus to compel the DENR Secretary to
sign, execute and deliver an IFMA to PICOP.

Ruling: The Local Government Code provides:
SEC. 27. Prior Consultations Required. - No
project or program shall be implemented by government
authorities unless the consultations mentioned in
Sections 2(c) and 26 hereof are complied with, and
prior approval of the sanggunian concerned is obtained:
Provided, That occupants in areas where such projects are
to be implemented shall not be evicted unless appropriate
relocation sites have been provided, in accordance with
the provisions of the Constitution.
As stated in the assailed Decision, the common evidence
of the DENR Secretary and PICOP, namely, the 31 July 2001
Memorandum of Regional Executive Director (RED) Elias
D. Seraspi, Jr., enumerated the local government units and
other groups which had expressed their opposition to PICOP's
application for IFMA conversion:
PICOP had claimed that it complied with the Local
Government Code requirement of obtaining prior approval of
the Sanggunian concerned by submitting a purported resolution
of the Province of Surigao de] Sur indorsing the approval of

139

PICOP's application for IFMA conversion. We ruled that this
cannot be deemed sufficient compliance with the foregoing
provision. Surigao de] Sur is not the only province affected by
the area covered by the proposed IFMA. As even the Court of
Appeals found, PICOP's TLA No. 43 traverses the length and
breadth not only of Surigao de] Sur but also of Agusan del Sur,
Compostela Valley and Davao Oriental.
PICOP is indeed neither a national agency nor a
government-owned or controlled corporation. The DENR,
however, is a national agency and is the national agency
prohibited by Section 27 from issuing an IFMA without the
prior approval of the Sanggunian concerned.
The Motion For Reconsideration of PICOP Resources, Inc
is Denied.
3. The projects and programs mentioned in Section 27, LGC
should be interpreted to mean projects and programs whose effects
are among those enumerated in Sections 26 and 27. Preliminarily,
it appears that the present case (NIA immigration land project) does
not fall under any of these instances; ergo, there is neither a need
for prior consultations of concerned sectors nor prior approval of the
Sanggunian.

REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v. LAZO
737 SCRA 1, September 29, 2014, Peralta, J.
Facts: Respondents spouses Rogelio Lazo and Dolores
Lazo are the owners and developers of Monte Vista Homes
(Monte Vista), a residential subdivision located in Barangay
Paing, Municipality of Bantay, Ilocos Sur. Sometime in 2006,
they voluntarily sold to the National Irrigation Administration
(NIA) a portion of Monte Vista for the construction of an open
irrigation canal that is part of the Banaoang Pump Irrigation
Project (BPIP). The consideration of the negotiated sale was in
a total amount of P27,180,000.00 at the rate of P2,500.00 per
square meter.
Subsequently, respondents engaged the services of Engr.
Donno G. Custodio, retired Chief Geologist of the Mines and
Geosciences Bureau Department of Environment and Natural
Resources, to conduct a geohazard study on the possible effects
of the BPIP on Monte Vista. Engr. Custodio later came up with

140

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

a Geohazard Assessment Report (GAR) finding that ground
shaking and channel bank erosion are the possible hazards
that could affect the NIA irrigation canal traversing Monte
Vista and recommended construction of a buffer zone.
On December 22, 2006, the Sangguniang Bayan of
Bantay, Ilocos Sur approved Resolution No. 34, which adopted
the recommendations contained in the GAR. Among others, it
resolved that the GAR recommendations should be observed
and implemented by the concerned implementing agency of the
NIABPIP.
Respondent Rogelio Lazo brought to NIA's attention
Resolution No. 34 through his letters dated January 15, 2007,
September 5, 2007, and November 1, 2007. He specifically
asked for the implementation of the GAR recommendations
and the payment of just compensation for the entire buffer
zone involving an aggregate area of 14,381 sq. m., more or less.

of the Sanggunian. It was said that the Congress introduced
these provisions to emphasize the legislative concern "for the
maintenance of a sound ecology and clean environment."
The projects and programs mentioned in Section 27
should be interpreted to mean projects and programs whose
effects are among those enumerated in Section 26 and 27, to
wit, those that: (1) may cause pollution; (2) may bring about
climatic change; (3) may cause the depletion of non renewable
resources; (4) may result in loss of crop land, range-land, or
forest cover; (5) may eradicate certain animal or plant species
from the face of the planet; and (6) other projects or programs
that may call for the eviction of a particular group of people
residing in the locality where these will be implemented.
Preliminarily, it appears that the present case does not fall
under any of these instances; ergo, there is neither a need for
prior consultations of concerned sectors nor prior approval of
the Sanggunian.

When respondents' demands were not acted upon,
they decided to file a complaint for just compensation with
damages against NIA on January 31, 2008. Prior to the filing
of an Answer, respondents filed an Amended Complaint with
application for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and
preliminary injunction which the RTC granted.

The Petition is GRAN TED. The Order and Supplement
to the Order of RTC, Vigan City, Ilocos Sur, which granted
respondents' application for preliminary prohibitory and
mandatory injunction are DECLAR ED VOID AND OF NO
FORCE AND EFFECT.

Ruling: Under the Local Government Code, therefore,
two requisites must be met before a national project that
affects the environmental and ecological balance of local
communities can be implemented: prior consultation with the
affected local communities, and prior approval of the project by
the appropriate sanggunian. Absent either of these mandatory
requirements, the project's implementation is illegal.

Under R.A. No. 7227, the power plant project of SBMA
is not subject to the prior approval by the sanggunians, and the
SBMA's decision to approve the project prevails over the apparent
objections of the concerned sanggunians.

Section 2(c) of the Local Government Code declares
the policy of the State "to require all national agencies and
offices to conduct periodic consultations with appropriate
local government units, non-governmental and people's
organizations, and other concerned sectors of the community
before any project or program is implemented in their respective
jurisdictions." This provision applies to national government
projects affecting the environmental or ecological balance of
the particular community implementing the project. Exactly,
Sections 26 and 27 of the Local Government Code requires prior
consultations with the concerned sectors and the prior approval

PAJE v. CASINO
749 SCRA 39, February 3, 2015, Del Castillo, J.
Facts: On July 20, 2012, Hon. Teodoro A. Casino et al.,
filed before this Court a Petition for Writ of Kalikasan against
RP Energy, SBMA, and Hon. Ramon Jesus P. Paje, in his
capacity as Secretary of the D ENR.
On September 11, 2012, the Petition for Writ of Kalikasan
was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 00015 and raffled to the
Fifteenth Division of the CA. In the Petition, the Casino Group
alleged, among others, that the power plant project would
cause grave environmental damage; that it would adversely
affect the health of the residents of the municipalities of Subic,
Zambales, Morong, Hermosa, and the City of Olongapo; that

the Environment Clearance Certificate (ECC) was issued and
the Lease and Development Agreement (LDA) entered into
without the prior approval of the concerned sanggunians as
required under Sections 26 and 27 of the Local Government
Code (LGC); x x x.

development of the SSEZ. Such is in line with the objective of
RA 7227 to develop the SSEZ into a self-sustaining industrial,
commercial, financial and investment center. Hence, the
decision of the SBMA would prevail over the apparent
objections of the concerned sanggunians of the LG Us.

Ruling: Whether compliance with Section 27, in
relation to Section 26, of the LGC (i.e., approval of the
concerned sangguanian requirement) is necessary prior to the
implementation of the power plant project.

Significantly, the legislative deliberations on RA 7227,
likewise, support and confirm the foregoing interpretation.
Indubitably, the legislature rejected the attempts to engraft
Section 27's prior approval of the concerned sanggunian
requirement under the LGC into RA 7227. Hence, the clear
intent was to do away with the approval requirement of the
concerned sanggunians relative to the power of the SBMA to
approve or disapproved a project within the SSEZ.

Preliminarily, we note that Sections 26 and 27 of the LGC
contemplate two requirements: (1) prior consultations and (2)
prior approval of the concerned sanggunian.
In the case at bar, the Casino Group only questions the
alleged lack of the prior approval of the concerned sanggunians
under Section 27 of the LGC. Thus, we shall limit our discussion
to the resolution of this issue.

By virtue of the clear provisions of RA 7227, the project
is not subject to the aforesaid requirement and the SBMA's
decision to approve the project prevails over the apparent
objections of the concerned sanggunians. Thus, the LDAentered
into between SBMA and RP Energy suffers from no infirmity
despite the lack of approval of the concerned sanggunians.

Section 12of RA 7227 (Bases Conversion and Development
Act) sets out the basic policies underlying the creation of the
SSEZ. Indeed, as noted by the appellate court, Section 12(i)
expressly recognizes the basic autonomy and identity of the
LGUs comprising the SSEZ. However, the clause "[e]xcept as
herein provided" unambiguously provides that the LGUs do
not retain their basic autonomy and identity when it comes
to matters specified by the law as falling under the powers,
functions and prerogatives of the SBMA.

The Court Resolves to Deny the (Casino) Petition.
Article Two.- Relations with the Philippine
National Police
SEC. 28. Power of Local Chief Executives over
the Units of the Philippine National Police. - The

In the case at bar, we find that the power to approve or
disapprove projects within the SSEZ is one such power over
which the SMBA's authority prevails over the LGU's autonomy.
Hence, there is no need for the SMBA to secure the approval of
the concerned sanggunians prior to the implementation of the
subject project.
This interpretation is based on the broad grant of powers
to the SMBA over all administrative matters relating to the
SSEZ under Section 13 of RA 7227, as afore-discussed. Equally
important, under Section 14, other than those involving defense
and security, the SMBA's decision prevails in case of conflict
between the SBMA and the LGUs in all matters concerning
the SSEZ.
Clearly, the subject project does not involve defense or
security, but rather business and investment to further the

extent of operational supervision and control of
local chief executives over the police force, fire
protection unit, and jail management personnel
assigned in their respective jurisdictions shall
be governed by the provisions of Republic Act
Numbered Sixty-nine hundred seventy-five (R.A.
No. 6975), otherwise known as "The Department

thereto.

ANDAYA v. RTC
319 SCRA 696, December 3, 1999, Pardo, J.
Facts: Petitioner Andaya, Police Regional Director
submitted to the City Mayor, Cebu City a list of five (5)
eligibles for the mayor to choose one to be appointed as the
chief of police of Cebu City. The mayor did not choose anyone
from the list because the name of P/Chief Inspector Andres
Sarmiento was not included therein. Petitioner refused to
agree to Mayor Garcia's request to include the name of Major
Andres Sarmiento in the list of police officers for appointment.
Petitioner Andaya's refusal was based on his contention that
Major Sarmiento was not qualified for the position of City
Director (Chief of Police), Cebu City Police Command.
Held: Under Republic Act No. 6975, Section 51, the
mayor of Cebu City shall be deputized as representative of the
Commission (National Police Commission) in his territorial
jurisdiction, and as such, the mayor shall have authority
to choose the chief of police from a list of five (5) eligibles
recommended by the Police Regional Director. It is the
prerogative of the Regional Police Director to name the five (5)
eligibles without interference from local executives.
The authority of the mayor is very limited. In reality, he
has no power of appointment; he has only the limited power of
selecting one from among the list of five eligibles to be named
the Chief of Police. Actually, the power to appoint the Chief of
Police of Cebu City is vested in the Regional Director. Much
Jess may the mayor require the Regional Director, Regional
Police Command, to include the name of any officer, no matter
how qualified, in the list of five to be submitted to the mayor.
The purpose is to enhance police professionalism and to isolate
the police service from political domination.

Decided Case

1.
The intervening reclassification of the City of Cebu into an
HUC and the subsequent enactment of the 1991 Local Government
Code rendered the continued application of Section 3(b) of P.D. No.
198in disregard of the reclassification, unreasonable and unfair. The
Mayor of the City of Cebu is declared to be the appointing authority
of the Members of the Board of Directors of the Metro Cebu Water
District, not the provincial governor of Cebu province.

RAMA v. MOISES
812 SCRA 347, December 6, 2016, Bersamin, J.
Facts: On May 25, 1973, President Ferdinand E.
Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 198 (Provincial Water
Utilities Act of 1973). By virtue of P.D. No. 198, Cebu City
formed the Metro Cebu Water District (MCWD) in 1974.
Thereafter, the Cities of Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu and Talisay,
and the Municipalities of Liloan, Compostela, Consolacion, and
Cordova turned over their waterworks systems and services to
the MCWD. Since then, the MCWD has distributed water and
sold water services to said cities and municipalities. Section 3
(b) of P. D. No. 198, provides:
(b) Appointing authority. The person empowered to
appoint the members of the board of Directors of a local
water district, depending upon the geographic coverage and
population make-up of the particular district. In the event that
more than seventy-five percent of the total active water service
connections of a local water district are within the boundary
of any city or municipality, the appointing authority shall be
the mayor of that city or municipality, as the case may be;
otherwise, the appointing authority shall be the governor of
the province within which the district is located.

Ruling: Cebu City, already an HUC, was further
effectively rendered independent from Cebu Province pursuant
to Section 29 of the l 99 l Local Government Code.

146

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Hence, all matters relating to its administration, powers
and functions were exercised through its local executives led
by the City Mayor, subject to the President's retained power
of general supervision over provinces, HU Cs, and independent
component cities pursuant to and in accordance with Section
25 of the 1991 Local Government Code, a law enacted for
the purpose of strengthening the autonomy of the LGUs in
accordance with the 1987 Constitution.
We opine that although Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198
provided for substantial distinction and was germane to the
purpose of P.D. No. 198 when it was enacted in 1973, the
intervening reclassification of the City of Cebu into an HUC and
the subsequent enactment of the 1991 Local Government Code
rendered the continued application of Section 3(b) in disregard
of the reclassification unreasonable and unfair. Clearly,
the assailed provision no longer provided for substantial
distinction because, firstly, it ignored that the MCWD was
built without the participation of the provincial government;
secondly, it failed to consider that the MCWD existed to serve
the community that represents the needs of the majority of
the active water service connections; and, thirdly, the main
objective of the decree was to improve the water service while
keeping up with the needs of the growing population.
We deem it to be inconsistent with the true objectives of
the decree to still leave to the provincial governor the appointing
authority if the provincial governor had administrative
supervision only over municipalities and component cities
accounting for 16.92% of the active water service connection
in the MCWD. In comparison, the City of Cebu had 61.28% of
the active service water connections; Mandaue, another HUC,
16%; and Lapu Lapu City, another HUC, 6.8%. There is no
denying that the MCWD has been primarily serving the needs
of Cebu City. Although it is impermissible to inquire into why
the decree set 75% as the marker for determining the proper
appointing authority, the provision has meanwhile become
unfair for ignoring the needs and circumstances of Cebu City
as the LGU accounting for the majority of the active water
service connections, and whose constituency stood to be the
most affected by the decisions made by the MCWD's Board
of Directors. Indeed, the classification has truly ceased to be
germane or related to the main objective for the enactment of
P.D. No. 198 in 1973.

GALLEGO v. VERA
73 Phil. 453, November 24, 1941, Ozaeta, J.
Facts: Based upon the facts stated in the next
preceding paragraph, namely: (1) his registration as a voter
in Malaybalay, Bukidnon, (2) his having actually voted in
Malaybalay in the 1938 election for assemblymen, and (3) his
residence certificate for 1940 in Malaybalay, the trial court
and the Court of Appeals declared that the herein petitioner
Pedro Gallego had acquired a residence or domicile of choice
in the municipality of Malaybalay, Bukidnon, and had lost
his domicile of origin in the municipality of Abuyog, Leyte at
the time he was elected mayor of the latter municipality, and
that, therefore, his election was void following the decisions of
this Court in the cases of Tanseco u. Arteche, 57 Phil. 227, and
Nuval v. Guray, 52 Phil. 645.
Held: The term "residence" as used in the election
law is synonymous with "domicile," which imports not only
intention to reside in a fixed place but also personal presence
in that place, coupled with conduct indicative of such intention.
(Nuval v. Guray, 52 Phil. 645.) In order to acquire a domicile
by choice, there must concur: (1) residence or bodily presence
in the new locality, (2) an intention to remain, there, and (3)
an intention to abandon the old domicile. In other words, there
must be an animus non revertendi and an animus manendi.
The purpose to remain in or at the domicile of choice must be
for an indefinite period of time. The acts of the person must
conform with this purpose. The change of residence must be
voluntary; the residence at the place chosen for domicile must
be actual; and to the fact of residence there must be added the
animus manendi. (17 Am. Jur., Section 16, pages 599-601.)

In the light of these principles, we are persuaded that
the facts of this case weigh heavily against the theory that the
petitioner had lost his residence or domicile in Abuyog. We
believe he did not reside in Malaybalay with the intention of
remaining there indefinitely and of not returning to Abuyog.
He is a native of Abuyog. Notwithstanding his periodic
absences from there previous to 1937, when he was employed
as teacher in Samar, Agusan, and other municipalities of
Leyte, he always returned there. In the year 1937, he resigned
as a school teacher and presented his candidacy for the office
of mayor of said municipality. His departure therefrom after
his defeat in that election was temporary, and only for the
purpose of looking for employment to make up for the financial
drawback he had suffered as aresult of his defeat at the polls.
After he had found employment to Malaybalay, he did not take
his wife and children thereto notwithstanding the offer of a
free house by the Government.
Petitioner is a native of Abuyog, had run for the same
office of municipal mayor of said town in the election preceding
the one in question, had only been absent therefrom for about
two years without losing contact with his townspeople and
without the intention of remaining and residing indefinitely
in the place of his employment; and he was elected with an
overwhelming majority of nearly 800 votes in a third-class
municipality. These considerations we cannot disregard
without doing violence to the will of the people of said town.
Wherefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
reversed, with the costs of this instance against the respondent.
2.
The mere absence from one's residence or origin domicile
to pursue studies, engage in business, or practice his vocation, is
not sufficient to constitute abandonment or loss of such residence.
A previous registration as voter in a municipality other than that
in which he is elected is not sufficient to constitute abandonment or
loss of his residence or origin.
FAYPON v. QUIRINO
96 Phil. 294, December 22, 1954, Padilla, J.
Facts: A petition for quo warranto under Section 173 of
Republic Act No. 180, as amended, was dismissed by the CFI
of Ilocos Sur. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal. By a

164

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

petition for a writ of certiorari under Rule 46 the last judgment
is now before us for review.
The ground for the quo warranto petition is the
respondent's ineligibility for the office of Provincial Governor of
Ilocos Sur to which he was proclaimed elected by the provincial
board of canvassers in the elections held on 13 November 1951.
It is alleged that he lacks the residence in the province, as a
required in Section 2071 of the Revised Administrative Code.
Held: There is no question that he was born in the
municipality of Cagayan, Ilocos Sur, in June 1895; came to
Manila to pursue his studies; went to the United States for the
same purpose; returned to the Philippines in 1923; lectured in
the University of the Philippines; and engaged in newspaper
work in Manila, Iloilo, and later on again in Manila. There is
also no question that the respondent was proclaimed by the
provincial board of canvassers elected to the office of Provincial
Governor of Ilocos Sur with 49,107 votes cast for him as against
19,466 votes cast for the petitioner.
The crucial and pivotal fact upon which the petitioner
relies to have the judgment under reversed and set aside is
the registration of the respondent as voter in Pasay City in
1946 and 1947. In several cases we have ruled that mere
absence from one's residence or origin - domicile - to pursue
studies, engage in business, or practice his avocation, is not
sufficient to constitute abandonment or loss of such residence.
It is contended, however, that the respondent's registration
as voter in Pasay City in 1946 and 1947 in accordance with
the provisions of the Constitution and the laws on the subject,
implies and means that he was a resident thereof during the
six months immediately preceding such registration and of the
Philippine for one year; and that such begin the case he was
ineligible for the office to which he was elected, because -

Book I - General Provisions
Tle Two Elective Officials

be held, the citizen who left his birthplace to improve his lot
may desire to return to his native town to cast his ballot, but
for professional or business reasons, or for any other reason
he may not absent himself from the place of his professional
or business activities; so there he registers as voter as he
has the qualifications to be one and is not willing to give
up or lose the opportunity to choose the officials who are to
run the government especially in national elections. Despite
such registration, the animus revertendi to his home, to his
domicile or residence of origin, has not forsaken him. This
may be the explanation why the registration of a voter in a
place other than his residence of origin has not been deemed
sufficient to constitute abandonment or loss of such residence.
It finds justification in the natural desire and longing of every
person to return to the place of his birth. This strong feeling
of attachment to the place of one's birth must be overcome by
positive proof of abandonment for another.
Upon the authority of cases decided by this Court, we are
of the opinion and so hold that on the evidence found by the
Court of Appeals, the respondent has not lost his residence of
origin.
3.
Private respondent Emano was actually and physically
residing in Cagayan de Oro City while discharging his duties as
governor of Misamis Oriental. He owned a house in the city and
resided there together with his family. He even paid his 1998
community tax and registered as a voter therein. To all intents and
purposes of the Constitution and the law, he is a resident of Cagayan
de Oro City and eligible to run for mayor thereof.
TORAYNO, SR. v. COMELEC
337 SCRA 574, August 9, 2000, Panganiban, J.

No person shall be eligible to a provincial office unless at
the time of election he is a qualified voter of the province, has
been a bona fide resident therein for at least one year prior to
the election, and is not less than thirty years of age.

Facts: During the 1995 elections, Vicente Y. Emano was
re-elected provincial governor of Misamis Oriental. It was
his third consecutive term as governor of the province. In his
Certificate of Candidacy dated March 12, 1995, his residence
was declared to be in Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental.

A citizen may leave the place of his birth to look for
"greener pastures," as the saying goes, to improve his lot, and
that, of course includes study in other places, practice of his
avocation, or engaging in business. When an election is to

On June 14, 1997, while still the governor of Misamis
Oriental, Emano executed a Voter Registration Record in
Cagayan de Oro City (geographically located in the Province of
Misamis Oriental), a highly urbanized city, in which he claimed

156

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

twenty (20) years ofresidence. On March 25, 1998, he filed his
Certificate of Candidacy for mayor of the city, stating therein
that his residence for the preceding two (2) years and five (5)
months was at 1409 San Jose Street, Capistrano Subdivision,
Gusa, Cagayan de Oro City.
Petitioners claim that in discharging his duties as
provincial governor, private respondent remained a resident
of the province. They aver that residence is a continuing
qualification that an elective official must possess throughout
his term. Thus, private respondent could not have changed his
residence to Cagayan de Oro City while he was still governor
of Misamis Oriental.
Held: The pertinent provision sought to be enforced is
Section 39 of the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991, which
provides for the qualifications of local elective officials.
The COMELEC found that private respondent and his
family had actually been residing in Capistrano Subdivision,
Gusa, Cagayan de Oro City, in a house he had bought in 1973.
Furt hermore, during the three (3) terms (1988--1998) that he
was governor of Misamis Oriental, he physically lived in that
city, where the seat of the provincial government was located. In
June 1997, he also registered as voter of the same city. He paid
his. 1998 Community Tax in the city. These facts indubitably
prove that Vicente Y. Emano was a resident of Cagayan de
Oro City for a period of time sufficient to qualify him to run for
public office therein. Moreover, the COMELEC did not find any
bad faith on the part of Emano in his choice of residence.
Undeniably, Cagayan de Oro City was once an integral
part of Misamis Oriental and remains a geographical part of
the province. Not only it is at the center of the province; more
importantly, it is itself the seat of the provincial government.
As a consequence, the provincial officials who carry out their
functions in the city cannot avoid residing therein; much less,
getting acquainted with its concerns and interests. Vicente
Y. Emano, having been the governor of Misamis Oriental for
three (3) terms and consequently residing in Cagayan de Oro
City within that period, could not be said to be a stranger or
newcomer to the city in the last year of his third term, when he
decided to adopt it as his permanent place of residence.

Book I General Provisions
Title Two - Elective Officials

167

To all intents and purposes of the Constitution and the
law, he is a resident of Cagayan de Oro City and eligible to run
for mayor thereof.
There is no question that private respondent was the
overwhelming choice of the people of Cagayan de Oro City. He
won by a margin of about 30,000 votes. Thus, we find it apt to
reiterate the principle that the manifest will of the people as
expressed through the ballot must be given fullest effect.
The Petition is DISMISSED.
4.
Petitioner lost his domicile of origin in Oras, Eastern
Samar by becoming a U.S. citizen after enlisting in the U.S. Navy
in 1965. From then on and until November 10, 2000, when he
reacquired Philippine citizenship, petitioner was an alien without
any right to reside in the Philippines, save as our immigration laws
may have allowed him to stay as a visitor or as a resident alien.
COQUILLA v. COMELEC
385 SCRA 607, July 31, 2002, Mendoza, J.
Facts: Petitioner Teodulo Coquilla was born on February
17, 1938 of Filipino parents in Oras, Eastern Samar. He grew
up and resided there until 1965, when he joined the United
States Navy and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen.
On October 15, 1998, petitioner came to the Philippines
and took out a residence certificate, although he continued
making several trips to the United States. Subsequently,
petitioner applied for repatriation under R.A. No. 8171 to the
Special Committee on Naturalization. His application was
approved on November 7, 2000, and on November 10, 2000,
he took his oath as a citizen of the Philippines and was issued
Certificate of Repatriation No. 000737 on November 10, 2000,
and Bureau of Immigration Identification Certificate No.
115123 on November 13, 2000.
On November 21, 2000, petitioner applied for registration
as a voter of Butnga, Oras, Eastern Samar which was approved
on January 12, 2001. On February 27, 2001, he filed his
certificate of candidacy stating therein that he had been a
resident of Oras, Eastern Samar for "two (2) years."
On March 5, 2001, candidate Neil M. Alvarez sought
the cancellation of petitioner's certificate of candidacy
alleging material misrepresentation in Coquilla's certificate of

158

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

candidacy by stating that he had been a resident of Oras for
two (2) years when in truth he had resided therein for only
about six (6) months since November 10, 2000, when he took
his oath as a citizen of the Philippines.
The COMELEC was unable to render judgment on the
case before the elections on May 14, 2001. Meanwhile, petitioner
was voted for and received the highest number of votes (6,131)
against private respondent's 5,752 votes, or a margin of 379
votes. On May 17, 2001, petitioner was proclaimed mayor of
Oras by the Municipal Board of Canvassers. He subsequently
took his oath of office.
On July 19, 2001, the COMELEC (2nd Div.) ordered the
cancellation of petitioner's certificate of candidacy. COMELEC
en bane affirmed the order.
Held: Petitioner lost his domicile of origin in Oras by
becoming a U.S. citizen after enlisting in the U.S. Navy in
1965. From then on, and until November 10, 2000, when he
reacquired Philippine citizenship, petitioner was an alien
without any right to reside in the Philippines, save as our
immigration laws may have allowed him to stay as a visitor or
as a resident alien.
Indeed, residence in the United States is a requirement
for naturalization as a U.S. citizen under Title 8, §1427(a)
Requirements of naturalization (Residence of the United
States Code).
In Caas i v. Court of Appeals (191 SCRA 229, 1990), this
Court ruled that immigration to the United States by virtue
of a "green card," which entitles one to reside permanently
in that country, constitutes abandonment of domicile in the
Philippines. With more reason then does naturalization in a
foreign country result in an abandonment of domicile in the
Philippines.
By having been naturalized abroad, he lost his Philippine
citizenship and with it, his residence in the Philippines. Until
his reacquisition of Philippine citizenship on November 10,
2000, petitioner did not reacquire his legal residence in this
country.
Second, it is not true, as petitioner contends, that ho
reestablished residence in this country in 1998. The status
of being an alien and a non-resident can be waived either

Book [ - General Provisions
Title Two- Elective Officials

159

separately, when one acquires the status of a resident alien
before acquiring Philippine citizenship, or at the same time
when one acquires Philippine citizenship. As an alien, an
individual may obtain an immigrant visa under Section 13
of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1948 and an Immigrant
Certificate of Residence (ICR) and thus waive his status as a
non-resident. On the other hand, he may acquire Philippine
citizenship by naturalization under C.A. No. 473, as amended,
or, if he is a former Philippine national, he may reacquire
Philippine citizenship by repatriation or by an act of Congress,
in which case he waives not only his status as an alien but also
his status as a non-resident alien.
When petitioner entered the country in 1998, 1999 and
August 5, 2020, he did so as a visa-free balikbayan visitor
whose stay as such was valid for one (1) year only. Hence,
petitioner can only be held to have waived his status as an
alien and as a non-resident only on November 10, 2000 upon
taking his oath as a citizen of the Philippines under R.A. No.
8171. He lacked the requisite residency to qualify him for the
mayorship of Oras, Eastern Samar.
Here, what is involved is a false statement concerning
a candidate's qualification for an office for which he filed
the certificate of candidacy. This is a misrepresentation of
a material fact justifying the cancellation of petitioner's
certificate of candidacy. The cancellation of petitioner's
certificate of candidacy in this case is thus fully justified.
The petition is DISMISSED.
5.
It was only after reacquiring his Filipino citizenship
by virtue of R.A. No. 9225 on September 13, 2012 that petitioner
can rightfully claim that he re-established his domicile in Uyugan,
Batanes, if such was accompanied by physical presence thereat,
coupled with an actual intent to reestablish his domicile there.
However, the period from September 13, 2012 to May 12, 2013 was
less than the one-year residency required by law.
CABALLERO v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
771 SCRA 213, September 22, 2015, Peralta, J.
Facts: Petitioner Rogelio Caballero and private
respondent Jonathan Enrique V. Nanud, Jr. were both
candidates for the mayoralty position of the Municipality of

160

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Uyugan, Province of Batanes in the May 13, 2013 elections.
Private respondent filed a Petition to deny due course to or
cancellation of petitioner's certificate of candidacy alleging that
the latter made a false representation when he declared in his
COC that he was eligible to run for Mayor of Uyugan, Batanes
despite being a Canadian citizen and a non resident thereof.
Petitioner argued that prior to the filing of his COC on
October 3, 2012, he took an Oath of Allegiance to the Republic
of the Philippines before the Philippine Consul General in
Toronto, Canada on September 13, 2012 and became a dual
Filipino and Canadian citizen pursuant to Republic Act (RA)
No. 9225, otherwise known as the Citizenship Retention
and Reacquisition Act of 2003. Thereafter, he renounced
his Canadian citizenship and executed an Affidavit of
Renunciation before a Notary Public in Batanes on October 1,
2012 to conform with Section 5(2) of RA No. 9225. He claimed
that he did not lose his domicile of origin in Uyugan, Batanes
despite becoming a Canadian citizen as he merely left Uyugan
temporarily to pursue a brighter future for him and his family;
and that he went back to Uyugan during his vacation while
working in Nigeria, California, and finally in Canada.
Ruling: Petitioner was a natural born Filipino who
was born and raised in Uyugan, Batanes. Thus, it could be
said that he had his domicile of origin in Uyugan, Batanes.
However, he later worked in Canada and became a Canadian
citizen. In Coquilla • COMELEC, G.R. No. 151914, July 31,
2002, we ruled that naturalization in a foreign country may
result in an abandonment of domicile in the Philippines. This
holds true in petitioner's case as permanent resident status in
Canada is required for the acquisition of Canadian citizenship.
Hence, petitioner had effectively abandoned his domicile in the
Philippines and transferred his domicile of choice in Canada.
His frequent visits to Uyugan, Batanes during his vacation
from work in Canada cannot be considered as waiver of such
abandonment.
In Japzon v. COMELEC, 596 Phil. 354 (2009) wherein
respondent Ty reacquired his Philippine citizenship under RA
No. 9225 and run for Mayor of General Macarthur, Eastern
Samar and whose residency in the said place was put in issue,
we had the occasion to state, thus:

Bok I- General Provisions
Title Two- Elective Officials

161

[Petitioner's) reacquisition of his Philippine
citizenship under Republic Act No. 9225 had no
automatic impact or effect on his residence/domicile.
He could still retain his domicile in the USA, and he did not
necessarily regain his domicile in the Municipality of General
Macarthur, Eastern Samar, Philippines. Ty merely had the
option to again establish his domicile in the Municipality
of General Macarthur, Eastern Samar, Philippines, said
place becoming his new domicile of choice. The length of his
residence therein shall be determined from the time he made
it his domicile of choice, and it shall not retroact to the time of
his birth.
Hence, petitioner's retention of his Philippine citizenship
under RA No. 9225 did not automatically make him regain his
residence in Uyugan, Batanes. He must still prove that after
becoming a Philippine citizen on September 13, 2012, he had
reestablished Uyugan, Batanes as his new domicile of choice
which is reckoned from the time he made it as such.
The COMELEC found that petitioner failed to present
competent evidence to prove that he was able to reestablish his
residence in Uyugan within a period of one year immediately
preceding the May 13, 2013 elections. It found that it was only
after reacquiring his Filipino citizenship by virtue of RA No.
9225 on September 13, 2012 that petitioner can rightfully claim
that he re-established his domicile in Uyugan, Batanes, if such
was accompanied by physical presence thereat, coupled with
an actual intent to reestablish his domicile there. However, the
period from September 13, 2012 to May 12, 2013 was even less
than the one year residency required by law.
Petitioner had made a material misrepresentation by
stating in his COC that he is a resident of Uyugan, Batanes
for at least one (d) year immediately proceeding the day of the
election, thus, a ground for a petition under Section 78 of the
Omnibus Election Code. Section 74, in relation to Section 78,
of the OEC governs the cancellation of, and grant or denial of
due course to COCs.
The material representation contemplated by Section 78
refers to qualifications for elective office, such as the requisite
residency, age, citizenship or any other legal qualification
necessary to run for a local elective office as provided for in

162

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the Local Government Code. Furthermore, aside from the
requirement of materiality, the misrepresentation must
consist of a deliberate attempt to mislead, misinform, or hide
a fact which would otherwise render a candidate ineligible.
We, therefore, find no grave abuse of discretion committed
by the COMELEC in canceling petitioner's COC for material
misrepresentation.
The petition for certiorari is DISMISSED.
6.
There are specific acts performed by petitioner one year
before the elections, or by 13 May 2012, which clearly demonstrated
her animus manendi et revertendi. It was grave abuse of discretion
for COMELEC in cancelling petitioner's COC because she was
absent from her locality for four months preceding the elections.
DANO v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
802 SCRA 446, September 13, 2016, Sereno, J.
Facts: Petitioner Juliet Dano was a natural-born Filipino
who hailed from the Municipality of Sevilla, Province of Bohol.
She worked as a nurse in the US and thereafter acquired
American citizenship.
On 2 February 2012, she obtained a Community Tax
Certificate (CTC) from the municipal treasurer of Sevilla. On
30 March 2012, she took her Oath of Allegiance before the Vice
Consul of the Philippine Consulate in Los Angeles, California.
On 2 May 2012, petitioner went to Sevilla to apply for
voter's registration. Eight days later, she went back to the US
and stayed there until 28 September 2012. She claims that
she went there to wind up her affairs, particularly to sell her
house in Stockton, California, as well as her shares of stock
in various companies. Upon returning to the Philippines,
petitioner executed a Sworn Renunciation of Any and All
Foreign Citizenship on 30 September 2012.
On 4 October 2012, she filed her COC for mayor of
Sevilla. She represented herself therein as one who had been a
resident of Sevilla for 1 year and 11 days prior to the elections
of 13 May 2013, or from 2 May 2012. On 10 October 2012,
private respondent Marie Karen Joy Diga! filed a petition
with the COMELEC for the cancellation of petitioner's COC.

Book I General Provisions
Title Two Elective Officials

163

Private respondent was the daughter of Ernesita Digal, whom
petitioner would later best for the mayoralty position in the
2013 elections by a margin of 668 votes.
Ruling: Petitioner sufficiently established that she had
already reacquired her Philippine citizenship when she starte d
residing in Sevilla on 2 May 2012. The only controverted issue
was whether her absence from the locality for four months out
of the I year and 11 days she had stated in her COC rendered
her unable to fulfill the residence requirement.
Considering that the only material issue before COMELEC
was the completeness of the period of residence, it should not
have disregarded the following evidence showing specific acts
performed by petitioner one year before the elections, or by 13
May 2012, which clearly demonstrated her animus manendi et
revertendi:
1.

She made public her intention to run for the mayoralty
position. In preparation for this aspiration, and in
order to qualify for the position, she went through
the reacquisition process under Republic Act No.
9225.

2.

She started to reside in her ancestral home, and even
obtained a CTC, during the first quarter of 2012.

3.

She applied for voter's registration in Sevilla.

4.

She went back to the US to dispose of her properties
located there.

COMELEC's grave abuse of discretion lay in its failure
to fully appreciate petitioner's evidence and fully explained
absence from Sevilla. Instead, it made a legal conclusion that
a candidate who has been physically absent from a locality for
four out of the twelve months preceding the elections can never
fulfil the residence requirement under Section 39 of the LGC.
In addition, COMELEC cancelled petitioner's COC without
any prior determination of whether or not she had intended to
deceive or mislead the electorate. This omission also constitutes
grave abuse of discretion.
It must be emphasized that the denial of due course to or
the cancellation of, a COC must be anchored on a finding that
the candidate made a material representation that was false.

164

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

In the sphere of election laws, a material misrepresentation
pertains to a candidate's act done with the intention to gain
an advantage by deceitfully claiming possession of all the
qualifications and none of the disqualifications when, in
fact, the contrary is true. In Mitra u. Comelec, 636 Phil. 753
(2010) the cancellation of the COC was reversed, because
the COMELEC "failed to critically consider whether Mitra
deliberately attempted to mislead, misinform or hide a fact
that would otherwise render him ineligible for the position of
Governor of Palawan." Absent such finding, We cannot sustain
the cancellation of petitioner's COC.

The term "fugitive from justice" which, under the Rules
and Regulations Implementing the LGC, refers only to a person who
has been convicted of final judgment, is an inordinate and undue
circumscription of the law.

MARQUEZ v. COMELEC
243 SCRA 538, April 18, 1995, Vitug, J.
Facts: Bienvenido Marquez, a defeated candidate for
the elective position of Governor in the Province of Quezon in
the 11th May 1992 elections filed this petition for certiorari,
praying for the reversal of the resolution of the Commission
on Elections which dismissed his petition for quo warranto
against the winning candidate, herein private respondent
Eduardo Rodriguez, for being allegedly a fugitive from justice.
It is averred that at the time private respondent filed
his certificate of candidacy, a criminal charge against him for
insurance fraud or grand theft of personal property was still
pending before the Municipal Court of Los Angeles Judicial
District, County of Los Angeles, State of California, U.S.A.

Held: The core issue focuses on whether private respondent
who, at the time of the filing of his certificate of candidacy (and
to date), is said to be facing a criminal charge before a foreign
court and evading a warrant for his arrest comes within the
term "fugitive from justice" contemplated by Section 40(e) of
the Local Government Code and, therefore, disqualified from
being a [1candidate for, and thereby ineligible from holding on
to, an elective local office.
The Solicitor General, taking the side of petitioner,
expresses a like opinion and concludes that the phrase "fugitive
from justice" includes not only those who flee after conviction to
avoid punishment but likewise those who, after being charged,
flee to avoid prosecution. This definition truly finds support
from jurisprudence.
The Court believes and thus holds, that Article 73 of the
Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government
Code of 1991, to the extent that it confines the term "fugitive
from justice" to refer only to a person (the fugitive) "who has
been convicted by final judgment," is an inordinate and undue
circumscription of the law .
. Unfortunately, the COMELEC did not make any definite
finding on whether or not, in fact, private respondent is a
"fugitive from justice" as such term must be interpreted and
applied in the light of the Court's opinion. The omission is
understandable since the COMELEC dismissed outrightly

166

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the petition for quo warranto on the basis instead of Rule 73
of the Rules and Regulations promulgated by the Oversight
Committee. The Court itself, not being a trier of facts, is
thus constrained to remand the case to the COMELEC for a
determination of this unresolved factual matter.

Definition of fugitive from justice indicates that the intent
to evade is the compelling factor that animates one's flight from a
particular jurisdiction. At the time of Rodriguez departure from the
U.S. there was still no complaint and arrest warrant, much less
conviction. He is not a fugitive of justice.
RODRIGUEZ v. COMELEC
259 SCRA 296, July 24, 1996, Francisco, J.
Facts: Petitioner Eduardo Rodriguez and private
respondent Bienvenido Marquez, Jr., ran for the gubernatorial
post of Quezon Province in the May 1992 elections. Rodriguez
won and was proclaimed duly-elected governor. Marquez
challenged Rodriguez' victory via petition for quo warranto
before the COMELEC. Marquez revealed that Rodriguez
left the United States where a charge is pending against the
latter before the Los Angeles Municipal Court for fraudulent
insurance claims, grand theft and attempted grand theft of
personal property, making Rodriguez a "fugitive from justice"
which is a ground for disqualification/ineligibility under Section
40 (e) of the Local Government Code (R.A. 7160).
The COMELEC dismissed Marquez' quo warranto
petition in a resolution of February 2, 1993, and likewise denied
a reconsideration thereof. The Supreme Court reversed the
COMELEC's rulings and remanded the case to the COMELEC
to determine whether Rodriguez is a "fugitive from justice."
In the May 8, 1995 election, Rodriguez and Marquez
renewed their rivalry for the same position of governor. This
time, Marquez challenged Rodriguez' candidacy via petition
for disqualification before the COMELEC, based on the same
allegation that Rodriguez is a "fugitive from justice." This
petition for disqualification was filed by Marquez on April
11, 1995 when Rodriguez' petition for certiorari from where
the April 18, 1995 MAR QUEZ Decision sprung was still
then pending before the Court. On May 7, 1995 and after the
promulgation of the MAR QUEZ Decision, the COMELEC

Book I General Provisions
Title Two Elective Officials

167

promulgated a Consolidated Resolution for the quo warranto
case and the disqualification case finding Rodriguez as
"fugitive from justice" and ordering him to vacate the office
and disqualifying him from running for governor in the 1995
election.
Rodriguez again emerged as the victorious candidate in
the May 8, 1995 election for the position of governor. On May
10 and 11, 1995, Marquez filed urgent motions to suspend
Rodriguez' proclamation which the COMELEC granted on
May 11, 1995. The Provincial Board of Canvassers nonetheless
proclaimed Rodriguez on May 12, 1995. The COMELEC
Consolidated Resolution in EPC No. 92-28 and SPA No. 95089 and the May 11, 1995 Resolution suspending Rodriguez'
proclamation thus gave rise to the filing of the instant petition
for certiorari.

Held: The term "fugitive from justice" as a ground for
the disqualification or ineligibility of a person seeking to run
for any elective local position under Section 40(e) of the Local
Government Code, should be understood according to the
definition given in the MAR QUEZ Decision, to wit:
"A 'fugitive from justice' includes not only those who
flee after conviction to avoid punishment but likewise
those who, after being charged, flee to avoid prosecution."
The definition thus indicates that the intent to evade is the
compelling factor that animates one's fight from a particular
jurisdiction. And obviously, there can only be an intent to
evade prosecution of punishment when there is knowledge by
the fleeing subject of an already instituted indictment, or of a
promulgated judgment of conviction.
"
Rodriguez' case just cannot fit in this concept. There is
no dispute that his arrival in the Philippines from the US on
June 25, 1985, as per certifications issued by the Bureau of
Immigrations dated April 27 and June 26 of 1995, preceded
November 12, 1985 and of the issuance on even date of the
arrest warrant by that same foreign court, by almost five (5)
months. It was clearly impossible for Rodriguez to have known
about such felony complaint and arrest warrant at the time
he left the US, as there was in fact no complaint and arrest
warrant-much less conviction-to speak of yet at such

168

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Book I General Provisions
Title Two - Elective Officials

time. What prosecution or punishment then was Rodriguez
deliberately running away from with his departure from the
US? The very essence of being a "fugitive from justice" under
the MAR QUEZ Decision definition, is just nowhere to be found
in the circumstances of Rodriguez.
Intent to evade on the part of a candidate must therefore
be established by proof that there has already been a conviction
or at least, a charge has already been filed, at the time of
flight. Not being a "fugitive from justice" under this definition,
Rodriguez cannot be denied the Quezon Province governatorial
(sic) post.
3.
For candidates for local elective office with dual citizenship,
it should suffice if, upon the filing of their certificates of candidacy,
they elect Philippine citizenship to terminate their status as persons
with dual citizenship.

MERCADOv.MANZANO
307 SCRA 630, May 26, 1999, Mendoza, J.
Facts: Petitioner Ernesto S. Mercado and private
respondent Eduardo B. Manzano were candidates for vicemayor of the City of Makati in the May 11, 1998 elections. The
other one was Gabriel V. Daza III. The results of the election
were as follows:
Eduardo B. Manzano

103,853

Ernesto S. Mercado

100,894

Gabriel V. Daza III

54.275

The proclamation of private respondent was suspended in
view of a pending petition for disqualification filed by a certain
Ernesto Mamaril who alleged that private respondent was not
a citizen of the Philippines but of the United States.
The Second Division of the COMELEC granted the petition
of Mamaril, and ordered the cancellation of the certificate of
candidacy of private respondent on the ground that he is a dual
citizen and, under Sec. 40(d) of the Local Government Code,
persons with dual citizenship are disqualified from running for
any elective position.

169

The question presented is whether under our laws, he is
disqualified from the position for which he filed his certificate
of candidacy. Is he eligible for the office he seeks to be elected?
Held: The disqualification of private respondent Manzano
is being sought under Section 40 of the Local Government Code
of 1991 (R.A. No. 7160), which declares as "disqualified from
running for any elective local position: ... (d) Those with dual
citizenship." This provision is incorporated in the Charter of
the City of Makati.
Dual allegiance refers to the situation in which a person
simultaneously owes, by some positive act, loyalty to two
or more states. While dual citizenship is involuntary, dual
allegiance is the result of an individual's volition.
The phrase "dual citizenship" in R.A. No. 7160, Section
40(d) and in R.A. No. 7854, Section 20 must be understood
as referring to "dual allegiance." Unlike those with dual
allegiance, who must, be subject to strict process with respect
to the termination of their status, for candidates with dual
citizenship, it should suffice if, upon the filing of their certificates
of candidacy, they elect Philippine citizenship to terminate
their status as persons with dual citizenship considering that
their condition is the unavoidable consequence of conflicting
laws of different states.
By electing Philippine citizenship, such candidates at
the same time forswear allegiance to the other country of
which they are also citizens and thereby terminate their
status as dual citizens. It may be that, from the point of view
of the foreign state and of its laws, such an individual has
not effectively renounced his foreign citizenship. The record
shows that private respondent was born in San Francisco,
California on September 4, 1955, of Filipino parents. Since the
Philippines adheres to the principle ofjus sanguinis, while the
United States follows the doctrine ofjus soli, the parties agree
that, at birth at least, he was a national both of the Philippines
and of the United States.
By declaring in his certificate of candidacy that he
is a Filipino citizen; that he is not a permanent resident or
immigrant of another country; that he will defend and support
the Constitution of the Philippines; and bear true faith and
allegiance thereto; and that he does so without mental

170

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

reservation; private respondent has, as far as the laws of this
country are concerned, effectively repudiated his American
citizenship and anything which he may have said before as a
dual citizen.
On the other hand, private respondent's oath of allegiance
to the Philippines, when considered with the fact that he
has spent his youth and adulthood, received his education,
practiced his profession as an artist, and taken part in past
elections in this country, leaves no doubt of his election of
Philippine citizenship.
4. Those who have not served their sentence by reason of
the grant of probation which, we reiterate, should not be equated
with service of sentence, should not likewise be disqualified from
running for a local elective office because the two (2)-year period of
ineligibility under Section 40(a) of the Local Government Code does
not even begin to run.

MORENO v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
498 SCRA 547, August 10, 2006, Tinga, d.
Facts: Norma L. Mejes filed a petition to disqualify
Urbano Moreno from running for Punong Barangay on the
ground that the latter was convicted by final judgment of
the crime of Arbitrary Detention and was sentenced to suffer
imprisonment of Four (4) Months and One (1) Day to Two
(2) Years and Four (4) Months by the Regional Trial Court,
Branch 28 of Catbalogan, Samar on August 27, 1998. Moreno
filed an answer averring that the petition states no cause of
action because he was already granted probation.

Ruling: The resolution of the present controversy depends
on the application of the phrase "within two (2) years after
serving sentence" found in Sec. 40(a) of the Local Government
Code, which reads:
Sec. 40. Disqualifications. - The following persons
are disqualified from running for any elective local
position:
(a) Those sentenced by final judgment for an offense
involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable
by one (l) year or more of imprisonment, within

two (2) years after serving sentence.

Book I General Provisions
Title Two -- Elective Officials

171

The phrase "within two (2) years after serving sentence"
should have been interpreted and understood to apply both
to those who have been sentenced by final judgment for an
offense involving moral turpitude and to those who have been
sentenced by final judgment for an offense punishable by one
(1) year or more of imprisonment. The placing of the comma ,)
in the provision means that the phrase modifies both parts of
Sec. 40(a) of the Local Government Code.
The accessory penalties of suspension from public office,
from the right to follow a profession or calling, and that of
perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage,
attendant to the penalty of arresto mayor in its maximum
period to prision correccional in its minimum period imposed
upon Moreno were similarly suspended upon the grant of
probation.
It appears then that during the period of probation, the
probationer is not even disqualified from running for a public
office because the accessory penalty of suspension from public
office is put on hold for the duration of the probation.
Clearly, the period within which a person is under
probation cannot be equated with service of the sentence
adjudged. Sec. 4 of the Probation Law specifically provides that
the grant of probation suspends the execution of the sentence.
During the period of probation, the probationer does not serve
the penalty imposed upon him by the court but is merely
required to comply with all the conditions prescribed in the
probation order.
This is as good a time as any to clarify that those who have
not served their sentence by reason of the grant of probation
which, we reiterate, should not be equated with service of
sentence, should not likewise be disqualified from running
for a local elective office because the two (2)-year period of
ineligibility under Sec. 40(a) of the Local Government Code
does not even begin to run.
When Moreno was finally discharged upon the court's
finding that he has fulfilled the terms and conditions of his
probation, his case was deemed terminated and all civil rights
lost or suspended as a result of his conviction were restored to
him, including the right to run for public office.
The petition is GRANTED.

Jalosjos has indeed committed material misrepresentation
in his certificate of candidacy when he declared, under oath, that he
is eligible for the office he seeks to be elected to when in fact he is
not by reason of a final judgment in a criminal case, the sentence of
which he has not yet served. If the certificate of candidacy is void
ab initio, then legally the person who filed such void certificate of
candidacy was never a candidate in the elections at any time.
JALOSJOS, JR. v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
670 SCRA 572, October 9, 2012, Carpio, •
Facts: Dominador Jalosjos, r. and Agapito Cardino were
candidates for Mayor of Dapitan City, Zamboanga del Norte
in the May, 2010 elections. Jalosjos, Jr. won and Cardino was
second placer.
As backgrounder, Jalosjos and three (3) others were
accused of the crime of robbery on January 22, 1969 in Cebu
City. On April 30, 1970, of the then Circuit Criminal Court of
Cebu City found him and his co-accused guilty of robbery and
sentenced them to suffer the penalty of prision correccional
minimum to prision mayor maximum. Jalosjos appealed this
decision to the Court of Appeals but his appeal was dismissed
on August 9, 1973. It was only after a lapse of several years or
more specifically on June 17, 1985 that Jalosjos filed a Petition
for Probation before the RTC Branch 18 of Cebu City which
was granted by the court. But then, on motion filed by his
Probation Officer, Jalosjos' probation was revoked by the RTC
Cebu City on March 19, 1987 and the corresponding warrant
for his arrest was issued.
Surprisingly, on December 19, 2003, Parole and Probation
Administrator Gregorio F. Bacolod issued a Certification
attesting that respondent Jalosjos, Jr., had already fulfilled the
terms and conditions of his probation. This Certification was
the one used by respondent Jalosjos to secure the dismissal of
the disqualification case filed against him by James Adasa in
2004, docketed as SPA No. 04-235.
This prompted Cardino to call the attention of the
Commission on the decision of the Sandiganbayan dated
September 29, 2008 finding Gregorio F. Bacolod, former
Administrator of the Parole and Probation Administration,
guilty of violating Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 for issuing a

Book I- General Provisions
Title Two Elective Officials

173

falsified Certification on December 19, 2003 attesting to the
fact that respondent Jalosjos had fully complied with the terms
and conditions of his probation.
On 10 May 2010, the COMELEC First Division granted
Cardino's petition and cancelled Jalosjos' certificate of
candidacy.

Ruling: A sentence of prision mayor by final judgment
is a ground for disqualification under Section 40 of the Local
Government Code and under Section 12 of the Omnibus
Election Code. It is also a material fact involving the eligibility
of a candidate under Sections 74 and 78 of the Omnibus
Election Code. Thus, a person can file a petition under Section
40 of the Local Government Code or under either Section 12 or
Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code.
The penalty of prision mayor automatically carries with
it, by operation of law, the accessory penalties of temporary
absolute disqualification.
What is indisputably clear is that the false material
representation of Jalosjos is a ground for a petition under
Section 78. However, since the false material representation
arises from a crime penalized by prision mayor, a petition
under Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code or Section
40 of the Local Government Code can also be properly filed.
The petitioner has a choice whether to anchor his petition on
Section 12 or Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code, or on
Section 40 of the Local Government Code. The law expressly
provides multiple remedies and the choice of which remedy to
adopt belongs to the petitioner.
The COMELEC properly cancelled Jalosjos' certificate
of candidacy. A void certificate of candidacy on the ground
of ineligibility that existed at the time of the filing of the
certificate of candidacy can never give rise to a valid candidacy,
and much less to valid votes. Jalosjos' certificate of candidacy
was cancelled because he was ineligible from the start to run
for Mayor. Thus, Cardino ran unopposed. There was only one
qualified candidate for Mayor in the May 2010 elections Cardino - who received the highest number of votes.
Decisions of this Court holding that the second-placer
cannot be proclaimed winner if the first-placer is disqualified
or declared ineligible should be limited to situations where

174

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the certificate of candidacy of the first-placer was valid at the
time of filing but subsequently had to be cancelled because of
a violation of law that took place, or a legal impediment that
took effect, after the filing of the certificate of candidacy. If
the certificate of candidacy is void ab initio, then legally the
person who filed such void certificate of candidacy was never a
candidate in the elections at any time. All votes for such noncandidate are stray votes and should not be counted.
The Motion for Reconsideration in G .R. No. 193237 is
DENIED. Agapito J. Cardino ran unopposed in the May 2010
elections and thus received the highest number of votes for
Mayor. Let copies of this Decision be furnished the Secretaries
of the Department of Justice and the Department of Interior
and Local Government so they can cause the arrest of, and
enforce the jail sentence on, Dominador G. Jalosjos, Jr.
6. The reason for Arnado's disqualification to run for public
office during the 2010 elections-being a candidate without total
and undivided allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines-still
subsisted when he filed his CoC for the 2013 elections on October
1, 2012. Despite the petitions filed against him questioning his
qualification to run for public office in 2010, Arnado fled his CoC
on October 1, 2012 unmindful of any possible legal setbacks in his
candidacy for the 2013 elections and without executing another
Affidavit of Renunciation.
ARNADO v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
767 SCRA 168, August 18, 2015, Del Castillo, J.
Facts: Petitioner Arnado is a natural-born Filipino citizen
who lost his Philippine citizenship after he was naturalized as
citizen of the United States of America (USA). Subsequently,
and in preparation for his plans to run for public office in the
Philippines, Arnado applied for repatriation under Republic
Act No. 9225 (August 29, 2003) before the Consul General
of the Philippines in San Franciso, USA. He took an Oath
of Allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines on July 10,
2008 and, on even date, an Order of Approval of Citizenship
Retention and Re acquisition was issued in his favor. On April
3, 2009, Arnado executed an Affidavit of Renunciation of his
foreign citizenship.
On November 30, 2009, Arnado filed his Certificate of
Candidacy (CoC) for the mayoralty post of Kauswagan, Lanao

Book I General Provisions
Title Two Elective Officials

175

de! Norte for the May 10, 2010 national and local elections.
Linog C. Balua (Balua), another mayoralty candidate, however,
filed a petition to disqualify Arnado and/or to cancel his CoC on
the ground, among others, that Amado remained a US citizen
because he continued to use his US passport for entry to and
exit from the Philippines after executing aforesaid Affidavit of
Renunciation.
While Balua's petition remained pending, the May 10,
2010 elections proceeded where Arnado garnered the highest
number of votes for the mayoralty post of Kauswagan. He was
proclaimed the winning candidate.
On February 2, 2011, the Comelec En Banc rendered a
Resolution reversing the ruling of the Comelec First Division.
It held that Arnado's use of his US passport did not operate
to revert his status to dual citizenship. The Comelec En Banc
found merit in Arnado's explanation that he continued to
use his US passport because he did not yet know that he had
been issued a Philippine passport at the time of the relevant
foreign trips. The Comelec En Banc further noted that, after
receiving his Philippine passport, Arnado used the same for his
subsequent trips.
Casan Maquiling. another mayoralty candidate, then
sought recourse to this Court by filing a petition docketed as
G.R No. 195649.
While G.R. No. 195649 was pending, the period for
the filing of CoCs for local elective officials for the May 13,
2013 elections officially began. On October 1, 2012, Arnado
filed his CoC for the same position. Respondent Capitan
also filed his CoC for the mayoralty post of Kauswagan.
On April 16, 2013, this Court rendered its Decision in
Maquiling vs COMELEC, 696 SCRA 420 (2013). Voting 10-5,
it annulled and set aside the Comelec En Bane's February 2,
2011 Resolution, disqualified Arnado from running for elective
position, and declared Maquiling as the duly elected mayor of
Kauswagan, Lanao Del Norte in the May 10, 2010 elections.
In so ruling, the majority of the Members of the Court
opined that in his subsequent use of his US passport, Amado
effectively disavowed or recalled his April 3, 2009 Affidavit of
Renunciation.

176

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

On May 14, 2013, Arnado was proclaimed as the winning
candidate.
Unfazed, Capitan fled another Petition this time seeking
to nullify Arnado's proclamation. He argued that with the April
16, 2013 Decision of this Court in Maquiling, there is no doubt
that Amado is disqualified from running for any local elective
office. Hence, Arnado's proclamation is void and without any
legal effect.
On December 9, 2013, the Comelec En Banc affirmed the
ruling of the Comelec Second Division. It accordingly annulled
the proclamation of Arnado and declared Capitan as the duly
elected mayor of Kauswagan.

Ruling: In the case at bench, the Comelec Second
Division as affirmed by the Comelec En Banc, ruled that
Arnado failed to comply with the second requisite of Section
(2) of RA 9225 because, as held in Maquiling v. Commission on
Elections, his April3, 2009 Affdavitof Renunciation was deemed
withdrawn when he used his US passport after executing said
affidavit. Consequently, at the time he filed his CoC on October
1, 2012 for purposes of the May 13, 2013 elections, Arnado had
yet to comply with said second requirement. The Comelec also
noted that while Arnado submitted an affidavit dated May 9,
2013, affirming his April 3, 2009 Affidavit of Renunciation, the
same would not suffice for having been belatedly executed.
The Comelec En Banc did not err, nor did it commit
grave abuse of discretion, in upholding the Resolution of the
Comelec Second Division disqualifying Arnado from running
for public office. It is worth noting that the reason for Amado's
disqualification to run for public office during the 2010
elections-being a candidate without total and undivided
allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines-still subsisted
when he filed his CoC for the 2013 elections on October 1, 2012.
The Comelec En Banc merely adhered to the ruling of this
Court in Maquiling lest it would be committing grave abuse of
discretion had it departed therefrom.
The ruling in Maquiling is indeed novel in the sense
that it was the first case dealing with the effect of the use of a
foreign passport on the qualification to run for public office of a
natural-born Filipino citizen who was naturalized abroad and
subsequently availed of the privileges under RA 9225. It was

Book I General Provisions
Title Two - Elective Officials

177

settled in that case that the use of a foreign passport amounts
to repudiation or recantation of the oath of renunciation.
When Amado filed his CoC on October 1, 2012, he was
not totally unaware that the use of his US passport after he
had executed the Affidavit of Renunciation might have an
impact on his qualification and candidacy. In fact, at that time,
Maquiling had already reached this Court. But despite the
petitions filed against him questioning his qualification to run
for public office in 2010, Arnado filed his CoC on October 1,
2012 unmindful of any possible legal setbacks in his candidacy
for the 2013 elections and without executing another Affidavit
of Renunciation.
In fine, this Court finds no grave abuse of discretion on
the part of the Comelec En Banc in sustaining the Resolution
of the Comelec Second Division disqualifying Amado from
running in the May 13, 2013 elections and in accordingly
setting aside his proclamation as elected mayor of Kauswagan,
Lanao de! Norte and proclaiming Capitan as the duly elected
mayor of said municipality.
The instant Petition is hereby DISMISSED and the
assailed Comelec Resolutions are AFFIRMED.

On March 27, 1998, private respondent Capco filed a
certificate of candidacy for mayor of Pateros relative to the
May 11, 1998 elections. Petitioner Benjamin U. Borja, Jr., who
was also a candidate for mayor, sought Capco's disqualification
on the theory that the latter would have already served as
mayor for three consecutive terms by June 30, 1998, and would
therefore be ineligible to serve for another term after that.

May 1995 elections Lonzanida ran for mayor of San Antonio,
Zambales and was again proclaimed winner. He assumed office
and discharged the duties thereof. His proclamation in 1995
was however contested by his then opponent Juan Alvez who
filed an election protest before the Regional Trial Court of
Zambales, which in a decision dated January 9, 1997 declared
a failure of elections.

The Commission on Elections ruled in favor of petitioner.
However, on motion of private respondent, reversed the
decision and declared Capco eligible to run for mayor in the
May 11, 1998 elections. Hence, this is petition for certiorari.

Both parties appealed to the COMELEC. On November
13, 1997 the COMELEC resolved the election protest filed by
Alvez and after a revision and re-appreciation of the contested
ballots declared Alvez the duly elected mayor of San Antonio,
Zambales by plurality of votes cast in his favor totaling P1,720
votes as against 1,488 votes for Lonzanida. On February
27, 1998 the COMELEC issued a writ of execution ordering
Lonzanida to vacate the post, which he obeyed, and Alvez
assumed office for the remainder of the term.

Held: Under the Local Government Code, the vice-mayor
is the presiding officer of the sanggunian and he appoints all
officials and employees of such local assembly. He has distinct
powers and functions, succession to mayorship in the event of
vacancy therein being only one of them. It cannot be said of
him, as much as of the Vice-President in the event of a vacancy
in the Presidency, that, in running for vice-mayor, he also
seeks the mayorship. His assumption of the mayorship in the
event of vacancy is more a matter of chance than of design.
Hence, his service in that office should not be counted in the
application of any term limit.
To recapitulate, the term limit for elective local officials
must be taken to refer to the right to be elected as well as the
right to serve in the same elective position. Consequently, it
is not enough that an individual has served three consecutive
terms in an elective local office, he must also have been elected
to the same position for the same number of times before the
clisqualification can apply.
2.
The petitioner was not the duly elected mayor and that he
did not hold office for the full term; hence, his assumption of office
from 1995 to March 1998 cannot be counted as a term for purposes
of computing the three term limit. The Resolution of the COMELEC
finding him disqualified on this ground to run in the May 1998
mayoral elections should therefore be set aside.

LONZANIDA v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
311 SCRA 602, July 28, 1999, Gonzaga-Reyes, J.
Facts: Petitioner Romeo Lonzanida was duly elected
and served two consecutive terms as municipal mayor of San
Antonio, Zambales prior to the May 8, 1995 elections. In the

In the May 11, 1998 elections Lonzanida again filed his
certificate of candidacy for mayor of San Antonio. On April
21, 1998 his opponent Eufemia Muli timely filed a petition to
disqualify Lonzanida from running for mayor of San Antonio
in the 1998 elections on the ground that he had served three
consecutive terms in the same post. On May 13, 1998, petitioner
Lonzanida was proclaimed winner.

Ruling: The petition has merit.
Sec. 8, Art. X of the Constitution provides and Sec. 43 of
the Local Government Code (R.A. No. 7160) restates the same
rule:
Sec. 43. Term of Office.
(h) No local elective official shall serve for more
than three consecutive terms in the same position.
Voluntary renunciation of the office for any length of time
shall not be considered as an interruption in the continuity
of service for the full term for which the elective official
concerned was elected.
This Court held that the two conditions for the application
of the disqualification must concur: 1) that the official
concerned has been elected for three consecutive terms in the
same local government post and 2) that he has fully served
three consecutive terms.

182

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

It is not disputed that the petitioner was previously elected
and served two consecutive terms as mayor of San Antonio
Zambales prior to the May 1995 mayoral elections. In the May
1995 elections he again ran for mayor of San Antonio, Zam bales
and was proclaimed winner. He assumed office and discharged
the rights and duties of mayor until March 1998 when he was
ordered to vacate the post by reason of the COMELEC decision
dated November 13, 1997 on the election protest against the
petitioner which declared his opponent Juan Alvez, the duly
elected mayor of San Antonio. Alvez served the remaining
portion of the 1995-1998 mayoral term.
The two requisites for the application of the three term
rule are absent. First, the petitioner cannot be considered as
having been duly elected to the post in the May 1995 elections,
and second, the petitioner did not fully serve the 1995-1998
mayoral term by reason of involuntary relinquishment of office.
It has been repeatedly held by this court that a proclamation
subsequently declared void is no proclamation at all and while
a proclaimed candidate may assume office on the strength
of the proclamation of the Board of Canvassers he is only a
presumptive winner who assumes office subject to the final
outcome of the election protest. Petitioner Lonzanida did not
serve a term as mayor of San Antonio, Zambales from May
1995 to March 1998 because he was not duly elected to the
post; he merely assumed office as presumptive winner, which
presumption was later overturned by the COMELEC when
it decided with finality that Lonzanida lost in the May 1995
mayoral elections.
The petitioner vacated his post a few months before the
next mayoral elections, not by voluntary renunciation but in
compliance with the legal process of writ of execution issued
by the COMELEC to that effect. Such involuntary severance
from office is an interruption of continuity of service and thus,
the petitioner did not fully serve the 1995-1998 mayoral term.
In sum, the petitioner was not the duly elected mayor and
that he did not hold office for the full term; hence, his assumption
of office from 1995 to March 1998 cannot be counted as a term
for purposes of computing the three term limit. The Resolution
of the COMELEC finding him disqualified on this ground to
run in the May 1998 mayoral elections should therefore be set
aside.

The petition is granted. The assailed resolutions of the
COMELEC declaring petitioner Lonzanida disqualified to run
for mayor in the 1998 mayoral elections are hereby set aside.
3.
COMELEC's ruling that private respondent was not
elected for three (3) consecutive terms should be upheld. For nearly
two years he was a private citizen. The continuity of his mayorship
was disrupted by his defeat in the 1998 elections.
ADORMEO v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
376 SCRA 90, February 4, 2002, Quisumbing, J.
Facts: Private respondent Ramon Talaga, Jr. was elected
mayor of Lucena City in May 1992. He served the full term.
Again, he was re-elected in 1995-1998. In the election of 1998,
he lost to Bernard G. Tagarao. In the recall election of May 12,
2000, he again won and served the unexpired term of Tagarao
until June 30, 2001.
On March 2, 2001, petitioner Raymundo Adormeo filed
with the Office of the Provincial Election Supervisor, Lucena
City a Petition to Deny Due Course to or Cancel Certificate
of Candidacy and/or Disqualification of Ramon Y. Talaga, Jr.,
on the ground that the latter was elected and had served as
city mayor for three (3) consecutive terms as follows: (1) in the
election of May 1992, where he served the full term; (2) in the
election of May 1995, where he again served the full term; and,
(3) in the recall election of May 12, 2000, where he served only
the unexpired term of Tagarao after having lost to Tagarao in
the 1998 election.
On May 9, 2001, the COMELEC en bane ruled in favor of
private respondent Ramon Y. Talaga, Jr. It reversed the First
Division's ruling and held that l) respondent was not elected
for three (3) consecutive terms because he did not win in the
May 11, 1998 elections; 2) that he was installed only as mayor
by reason of his victory in the recall elections; 3) that his victory
in the recall elections was not considered a term of office and is
not included in the 3-term disqualification rule, and 4) that he
did not fully serve the three (3) consecutive terms, and his loss
in the May 11, 1998 elections is considered an interruption in
the continuity of his service as Mayor of Lucena City.
On May 19, 2001, after canvassing, private respondent
was proclaimed as the duly elected Mayor of Lucena City.

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Ruling: This Court has held that the two conditions for
the application of the disqualification must concur: a) that the
official concerned has been elected for three consecutive terms
in the same local government post and 2) that he has fully
served three consecutive terms.
Accordingly, COMELEC's ruling that private respondent
was not elected for three (3) consecutive terms should be
upheld. For nearly two years he was a private citizen. The
continuity of his mayorship was disrupted by his defeat in the
1998 elections.
The instant petition is hereby DISMISSED. The resolution
of public respondent Commission on Elections is AFFIRMED.

We hold that Hagedorn is qualified to run in the September
24, 2002 recall election for mayor of Puerto Princesa because he is
not running for immediate reelection following his three consecutive

service as mayor was involuntarily interrupted from June 30, 2001
to September 24, 2002 during which time he was a private citizen;
SOCRATES v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
391 SCRA 457, November 12, 2002, Carpio, J.
Facts: On July 2, 2002, 312 out of 528 members of the
then incumbent barangay officials of the Puerto Princesa
convened themselves into a Preparatory Recall Assembly at
the Gymnasium of Barangay San Jose from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00
noon. The PRA was convened to initiate the recall of Victorino
Dennis M. Socrates who assumed office as Puerto Princesa's
mayor on June 30, 2001. The members of the PRA designated
Mark David M. Hagedorn, president of the Association of
Barangay Captains, as interim chair of the PRA.
On the same date, the PRA passed Resolution No. 01-02
which declared its loss of confidence in Socrates and called for
his recall. The PRA requested the COMELEC to schedule the
recall election for mayor within 30 days from receipt of the
Recall Resolution.
On August 21, 2002, the COMELEC en bane promulgated
Resolution No. 5673 prescribing the calendar of activities
and periods of certain prohibited acts in connection with the

Book I General Provisions
Title 'Two - Elective Officials

185

recall election. The COMELEC fixed the campaign period from
August 27, 2002 to September 5, 2002 or a period of 10 days.
On August 23, 2002, Edward M. Hagedorn filed his
certificate of candidacy for mayor in the recall election.
On August 17, 2002, Ma. Flores F. Adovo and Merly
E. Gilo filed a petition before the COMELEC, to disqualify
Hagedorn from running in the recall election and to cancel his
certificate of candidacy.

Ruling: This three-term limit rule under the Constitution
is reiterated in Section 43 (b) of RA No. 7160, otherwise known
as the Local Government Code.
Clearly, what the Constitution prohibits is an immediate
reelection for a fourth term following three consecutive terms.
The Constitution, however, does not prohibit a subsequent
reelection for a fourth term as long as the reelection is not
immediately after the end of the third consecutive term. A recall
election mid-way in the term following the third consecutive
term is a subsequent election but not an immediate reelection
after the third term.
The framers of the Constitution thus clarified that a
Senator can run after only three years following his completion
of two terms. The framers expressly acknowledged that the
prohibited election refers only to the immediate reelection,
and not to any subsequent election, during the six-year period
following the two term limit. The framers of the Constitution
did not intend "the period of rest" of an elective official who has
reached his term limit to be the full extent of the succeeding
term.
In the case of Hagedorn, his candidacy in the recall
election on September 24, 2002 is not an immediate reelection
after his third consecutive term which ended on June 30,
2001. The immediate reelection that the Constitution barred
Hagedorn from seeking referred to the regular elections in
2001. Hagedorn did not seek reelection in the 2001 elections.
Hagedorn did not run for mayor in the 2001 elections.
Socrates ran and won as mayor of Puerto Princesa in the
2001 elections. After Hagedorn ceased to be mayor on June
30, 2001, he became a private citizen until the recall election
of September 24, 2002 when he won by 3,018 votes over his
closest opponent, Socrates.

We hold that Hagedorn is qualified to run in the September

The petitions in G.R. Nos. 154512, 154683, and 155083-84
are DISMISSED. The temporary restraining order issued by
this Court on September 24, 2002 enjoining the proclamation
of the winning candidate for mayor of Puerto Princesa in the
recall election of September 24, 2002 is lifted.
5.
To allow petitioner Latasa to vie for the position of city
mayor after having served for three consecutive terms as a municipal
mayor would obviously defeat the very intent of the framers when
they wrote this exception.

LATASA v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
417 SCRA 6OI, December 10, 2003, Azcuna, J.
Facts: Petitioner Arsenio A. Latasa, was elected mayor
of the Municipality of Digos, Davao de! Sur in the elections
of 1992, 1995, and 1998. During petitioner's third term,
the Municipality of Digos was declared a component city,
to be known as the City of Digos. A plebiscite conducted on
September 8, 2000 ratified Republic Act No. 8798 entitled,
"An Act Converting the Municipality of Digos, Davao del Sur
Province into a Component City to be known as the City ofDigos"
or the Charter of the City of Digos. This event also marked
the end of petitioner's tenure as mayor of the Municipality of
Digos. However, under Section 53, Article IX of the Charter,
petitioner was mandated to serve in a hold-over capacity as
mayor of the new City of Digos. Hence, he took his oath as the
city mayor.
On February 28, 2001, petitioner filed his certificate of
candidacy for city mayor for the May 14, 2001 elections. He
stated therein that he is eligible therefor, and likewise disclosed
that he had already served for three consecutive terms as
mayor of the Municipality of Digos and is now running for the
first time for the position of city mayor.
On March 1, 2001, private respondent Romeo M. Sunga,
also a candidate for city mayor in the said elections, filed
before the COMELEC a Petition to Deny Due Course, Cancel
Certificate of Candidacy and/or For Disqualification against
petitioner Latasa. Respondent Sunga alleged therein that

187

petitioner falsely represented in his certificate of candidacy
that he is eligible to run as mayor of Digos City since petitioner
had already been elected and served for three consecutive
terms as mayor from 1992 to 2001.

Ruling: True, the new city acquired a new corporate
existence separate and distinct from that of the municipality.
This does not mean, however, that for the purpose of applying
the subject Constitutional provision, the office of the municipal
mayor would now be construed as a different local government
post as that of the office of the city mayor. As stated earlier,
the territorial jurisdiction of the City of Digos is the same
as that of the municipality. Consequently, the inhabitants
of the municipality are the same as those in the city. These
inhabitants are the same group of voters who elected petitioner
Latasa to be their municipal mayor for three consecutive terms.
These are also the same inhabitants over whom he held power
and authority as their chief executive for nine years.
To allow petitioner Latasa to vie for the position of city
mayor after having served for three consecutive terms as
a municipal mayor would obviously defeat the very intent
of the framers when they wrote this exception. Should he
be allowed another three consecutive terms as mayor of the
City of Digos, petitioner would then be possibly holding office
as chief executive over the same territorial jurisdiction and
inhabitants for a total of eighteen consecutive years. This is the
very scenario sought to be avoided by the Constitution, if not
abhorred by it.
This Court has consistently ruled that the fact that a
plurality or a majority of the votes are cast for an ineligible
candidate at a popular election, or that a candidate is later
declared to be disqualified to hold office, does not entitle the
candidate who garnered the second highest number of votes
to be declared elected. The same merely results in making the
winning candidate's election a nullity. In the present case,
moreover, 13,650 votes were cast for private respondent Sunga
as against the 25,335 votes cast for petitioner Latasa. The
second placer is obviously not the choice of the people in that
particular election. In any event, a permanent vacancy in the
contested office is thereby created which should be filled by

succession.
The petition is DISMISSED.

It is true that the RTC-Daet, Camarines Norte ruled
in Election Protest Case No. 6850, that it was Francis' opponent
(Alegre) who "won" in the 1998 mayoralty race and, therefore, was
the legally elected mayor of San Vicente. However, that disposition,
it must be stressed, was without practical and legal use and value,
having been promulgated after the term of the contested office has
expired.

7. The failure-of-election factor does not obtain in the present
case. But more importantly, here, there was actually no interruption
or break in the continuity of Francis' service respecting the 19982001 term. Francis was never unseated during the term in question;
he never ceased discharging his duties and responsibilities as mayor
of San Vicente, Camarines Norte for the entire period covering the
1998-2001 term.

RIVERA III v. MORALES
523 SCRA 41, May 9, 2007, Sandoval-Gutierrez, J.

Facts: Private respondent Joseph Stanley Alegre and
petitioner Francis Ong were candidates who filed certificates
of candidacy for mayor of San Vicente, Camarines Norte in
the May 10, 2004 elections. Francis was then the incumbent
mayor.

Facts: On January 10, 2004, Attys. Venancio Q.
Rivera and Normandick De Guzman, petitioners, filed with
the Second Division of the COMELEC a petition to cancel
respondent Morales' Certificate of Candidacy on the ground
that he was elected and had served three previous consecutive
terms as mayor of Mabalacat. They alleged that his candidacy
violated Section 8, Article X of the Constitution and Section
43 (b) of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7160, also known as the Local
Government Code.

On January 9, 2004, Alegre filed with the COMELEC
Provincial Office a Petition to Disqualify, Deny Due Course
and Cancel Certificate of Candidacy of Francis. The petition to
disqualify was predicated on the three-consecutive term rule,
Francis having, according to Alegre, ran in the May 1995, May
1998, and May 2001 mayoralty elections and have assumed
office as mayor and discharged the duties thereof for three (3)
consecutive full terms corresponding to those elections.

Ruling: It is true that the RTC-Daet, Camarines Norte
ruled in Election Protest Case No. 6850, that it was Francis'
opponent (Alegre) who "won" in the 1998 mayoralty race
and, therefore, was the legally elected mayor of San Vicente.
However, that disposition, it must be stressed, was without
practical and legal use and value, having been promulgated
after the term of the contested office has expired. Petitioner
Francis' contention that he was only a presumptive winner
in the 1998 mayoralty derby as his proclamation was under
protest did not make him less than a duly elected mayor. His
proclamation by the Municipal Board of Canvassers of San
Vicente as the duly elected mayor in the 1998 mayoralty election
coupled by his assumption of office and his continuous exercise
of the functions thereof from start to finish of the term, should
legally be taken as service for a full term in contemplation of
the three-term rule.
The instant petitions are DISMISSED.

On May 24, 2004, after respondent Morales was proclaimed
the duly elected mayor of Mabalacat for the term commencing
July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2007, petitioner Anthony Dee, also a
candidate for mayor, filed with the RTC, Branch 61, Angeles
City a petition for quo warranto against the said respondent.
Petitioner alleged that respondent Morales, having served
as mayor for three consecutive terms, is ineligible to run for
another term or fourth term.
It is undisputed that respondent Morales was elected to
the position of mayor of Mabalacat for the following consecutive
terms: a) July 1, 1995 to June 30, 1998; b) July 1, 1998 to June
30, 2001; c) July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2004; d) July 1, 2004 to
June 30, 2007
Respondent Morales argued and the Comelec held that
the July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2007 term is not his fourth because
his second term, July 1, 1998 to June 30, 2001 to which he
was elected and which he served, may not be counted since his
proclamation was declared void by the RTC, of Angeles City.

Ruling: Respondent Morales is wrong. This Court,
through Mr. Justice Cancio C. Garcia, resolved the same issue

190

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

in Ong v. Alegre 479 SCRA 473, (2006) with identical facts,
thus:
"It is true that the RTC-Daet, Camarines Norte ruled
in Election Protest Case No. 6850, that it was Francis'
opponent (Alegre) who "won" in the 1998 mayoralty race
and, therefore, was the legally elected mayor of San
Vicente. However, that disposition, it must be stressed,
was without practical and legal use and value, having
been promulgated after the term of the contested office
has expired."
Here, respondent Morales was elected for the term July 1,
1998 to June 30, 2001. He assumed the position. He served as
mayor until June 30, 2001. He was mayor for the entire period
notwithstanding the Decision of the RTC in the electoral protest
case filed by petitioner Dee ousting him (respondent) as mayor.
To reiterate, as held in Ong v. Alegre, such circumstance does
not constitute an interruption in serving the full term.
In Labo v. Comelec, 211 SCRA 297 (1992) this Court has
ruled that a second place candidate cannot be proclaimed as a
substitute winner.
As a consequence of petitioner's ineligibility, a permanent
vacancy in the contested office has occurred. This should now
be filled by the vice-mayor in accordance with Section 44 of the
Local Government Code.
WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. Respondent
Morales' Certificate of Candidacy dated December 30, 2003 is
cancelled. In view of the vacancy in the Office of the Mayor
in Mabalacat, Pampanga, the vice-mayor elect of the said
municipality is hereby declared mayor and shall serve as such
for the remaining duration of the term July 1, 2004 to June 30,
2007.
8. While it is true that under R.A. No. 8806 the municipalities
of Sorsogon and Bacon were merged and converted into a city
thereby abolishing the former and creating Sorsogon City as a new
political unit, it cannot be said that for the purpose of applying
the prohibition in Section 2 of R.A. No. 9164, the office of Punong
Barangay of Barangay Panlayaan, Municipality of Sorsogon, would

now be construed as a different local government post as that of the
office of Punong Barangay of Barangay Panlayaan, Sorsogon City.
LACEDA, SR. v. LIMENA
571 SCRA 603, November 25, 2008, Quisumbing, J.
Facts: Petitioner Roberto Laceda, Sr., and private
respondent Randy L. Limena were candidates for Punong
Barangay of Barangay Panlayaan, West District, Sorsogon
City, during the October 29, 2007 Barangay and Sangguniang
Kabataan Elections. On October 23, 2007, Limena filed a
petition for disqualification and/or declaration as an ineligible
candidate against Laceda before the COMELEC, contending
that Laceda had already served as Punong Barangay for Brgy.
Panlayaan for three consecutive terms since 1994, and was
thus prohibited from running for the fourth time.
In his Answer, Laceda admitted having served as Punong
Barangay of Panlayaan for three consecutive terms. However,
he asserted that when he was elected for his first two terms,
Sorsogon was still a municipality, and that when he served
his third term, the Municipality of Sorsogon had already been
merged with the Municipality of Bacon to form a new political
unit, the City of Sorsogon, pursuant to Republic Act No. 8806.
Thus, he argued that his third term was actually just his first
in the new political unit and that he was accordingly entitled
to run for two more terms.

Ruling: Section 2 of Rep. Act No. 9164, like Section 43
of the Local Government Code from which it was taken, is
primarily intended to broaden the choices of the electorate of
the candidates who will run for office, and to infuse new blood
in the political arena by disqualifying officials from running
for the same office after a term of nine years. This Court has
held that for the prohibition to apply, two requisites must
concur: (1) that the official concerned has been elected for three
consecutive terms in the same local government post and (2)
that he or she has fully served three consecutive terms.
In this case, while it is true that under Rep. Act No.
8806 the municipalities of Sorsogon and Bacon were merged
and converted into a city thereby abolishing the former and
creating Sorsogon City as a new political unit, it cannot be said

192

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

that for the purpose of applying the prohibition in Section 2 of
Rep. Act No. 9164, the office of Punong Barangay of Barangay
Panlayaan, Municipality of Sorsogon, would now be construed
as a different local government post as that of the office of
Punong Barangay of Barangay Panlayaan, Sorsogon City.
The territorial jurisdiction of Barangay Panlayaan, Sorsogon
City, is the same as before the conversion. Consequently, the
inhabitants of the barangay are the same. They are the same
group of voters who elected Laceda to be their Punong Barangay
for three consecutive terms and over whom Laceda held power
and authority as their Punong Barangay. Moreover, Rep. Act
No. 8806 did not interrupt Laceda's term.
The COMELEC did not err nor commit any abuse of
discretion when it declared Roberto Laceda, Sr. disqualified
and cancelled his certificate of candidacy.
9. Petitioner did not fill in or succeed to a vacancy by
operation of law. He instead relinquished his office as Punong
Barangay during his third term when he won and assumed office
as Sangguniang Bayan member of Dauis, Bohol, which is deemed
a voluntary renunciation of the Office of Punong Barangay. He has
fully served his third term and cannot run for Punong Barangay in
the next election.

BOLOS, JR. v COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
581 SCRA 786, March 17, 2009, Peralta, J.
Facts: For three consecutive terms, petitioner was elected
to the position of Punong Barangay of Barangay Biking, Dauis,
Bohol in the Barangay Elections held in 1994, 1997 and 2002.
In May 2004, while sitting as the incumbent Punong
Barangay of Barangay Biking, petitioner ran for Municipal
Councilor of Dauis, Bohol and won. He assumed office as
Municipal Councilor on July 1, 2004, leaving his post as Punong
Barangay. He served the full term of the Sangguniang Bayan
position, which was until June 30, 2007.
Thereafter, petitioner filed his Certificate of Candidacy
for Punong Barangay of Barangay Biking, Dauis, Bohol in
the October 29, 2007 Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan
Elections.

193

Respondent Rey Angeles Cinconiegue, the incumbent

Punong Barangay and candidate for the same office, filed before
the COMELEC a petition for the disqualification of petitioner
as candidate on the ground that he had already served the
three-term limit. Hence, petitioner is no longer allowed to run
for the same position in accordance with Section 8, Article X of
the Constitution and Section 43 (b) of R.A. No. 7160.

Ruling: It is our finding that Nicasio Bolos, Jr.'s
relinquishment of the office of Punong Barangay of Biking,
Dauis, Bohol, as a consequence of his assumption to office as
Sangguniang Bayan member of Dauis, Bohol, on July 1, 2004,
is a voluntary renunciation.
Indeed, petitioner was serving his third term as Punong
Barangay when he ran for Sangguniang Bayan member and,
upon winning, assumed the position of Sangguniang Bayan
member, thus, voluntarily relinquishing his office as Punong
Barangay which the Court deems as a voluntary renunciation
of said office.
Petitioner erroneously argues that when he assumed the
position of Sangguniang Bayan member, he left his post as
Punong Barangay by operation of law; hence, he did not fully
serve his third term as Punong Barangay.
In this case, petitioner did not fill in or succeed to a
vacancy by operation of law. He instead relinquished his office
as Punong Barangay during his third term when he won and
assumed office as Sangguniang Bayan member of Dauis,
Bohol, which is deemed a voluntary renunciation of the Office
of Punong Barangay.
The petition is DISMISSED.
10. The Court notes that after the reapportionment of the
districts in Camarines Sur, the current Third District, which brought
Naval to office in 2010 and 2013, has a population of 35,856 less
than that of the old Second District, which elected him in 2004 and
2007. However, the wordings of R.A. 9716 indicate the intent of the
lawmakers to create a single new Second District from the merger
of the towns from the old First District with Gainza and Milaor. As
to the current Third District, Section 3(c) of R.A. 9716 used the word
"rename." Sustaining Naval's arguments would practically allow

194

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

him to hold the same office for 15 years. These are the circumstances
the Constitution explicitly intends to avert.
NAVAL v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
738 Phil. 506, July 8, 2014, Reyes, J.
Facts: From 2004 to 2007 and 2007 to 2010, Naval had
been elected and had served as a member of the Sanggunian,
Second District, Province of Camarines Sur.
On October 12, 2009, the President approved Republic Act
(R.A.) No. 9716 which reapportioned the legislative districts in
Camarines Sur.
Notably, 8 out of 10 towns were taken from the old Second
District to form the present Third District. The present Second
District is composed of the two remaining towns, Gainza and
Milaor, merged with five towns from the old First District.
In the 2010 elections, Naval once again won as among the
members of the Sanggunian, Third District. He served until
2013.
In the 2013 elections, Naval ran anew and was re-elected
as Member of the Sanggunian, Third District.
Ruling: As a result of the reapportionment made by R.A.
No. 9716, the old Second District ofCamarines Sur, minus only
the two towns of Gainza and Milaor, is renamed as the Third
District.
The Court notes that after the reapportionment of the
districts in Camarines Sur, the current Third District, which
brought Naval to office in 2010 and 2013, has a population of
35,856 less than that of the old Second District, which elected
him in 2004 and 2007. However, the wordings of R.A. No.
9716 indicate the intent of the lawmakers to create a single
new Second District from the merger of the towns from the old
First District with Gainza and Milaor. As to the current Third
District, Section 3(c) of R.A. No. 9716 used the word "rename."
Although the qualifier "without a change in its composition"
was not found in Section 3(c), unlike in Sections 3(d) and (e),
still, what is pervasive is the clear intent to create a sole new
district in that of the Second, while merely renaming the rest.

Book I G eneral Provisions
Title Two Elective Officials

195

In Naval's case, the words of R.A. No. 9716 plainly state
that the new Second District is to be created, but the Third
District is to be renamed. Verba legis non est recedendum.
The terms used in a legal provision to be construed compels
acceptance and negates the power of the courts to alter it,
based on the postulate that the framers mean what they say.
It likewise bears noting that the actual difference in the
population of the old Second District from that of the current
Third District amounts to less than 10% of the population of
the latter. This numerical fact renders the new Third District
as essentially, although not literally, the same as the old
Second District. Hence, while Naval is correct in his argument
that Sanggunian members are elected by district, it does not
alter the fact that the district which elected him for the third
and fourth time is the same one which brought him to office in
2004 and 2007.
The petition is DENIED.
11. The conversion of a municipality into a city does not
constitute an interruption of the incumbent official's continuity of
service. Since the COC of the winning candidate is void ab initio, the
second placer is entitled to the position.
HAL ILI v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
G.R. No. 231643, January 15, 2019, Carpio, J.
Facts: Petitioner Marino P. Morales was elected and
served as Mayor of the Municipality of Mabalacat, Pampanga
from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2010. He was elected again as
mayor during the 2010 elections. On 15 May 2012, or during
Morales' second term, Congress passed Republic Act No.
(RA) 10164, converting the Municipality of Mabalacat into a
component city. Thereafter, a plebiscite was held. In the 2013
elections, Morales ran again and was elected as mayor of the
new Mabalacat City. On 8 December 2015, Morales filed his
Certificate of Candidacy (COC) for the 2016 elections for mayor
of Mabalacat City.
Ruling: We have already ruled upon the same issue in
the case of Latasa v. COMELEC, 463 Phil. 296 (2008) (Latasa)
where we held that the conversion of a municipality into a city
does not constitute an interruption of the incumbent official's
continuity of service.

196

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Thus, contrary to Morales' arguments, the territorial
jurisdiction of Mabalacat City is the same as that of the
Municipality of Mabalacat. Also, the elective officials of the
Municipality of Mabalacat continued to exercise their powers
and functions until elections were held for the new city officials.
We find that Morales misrepresented his eligibility
because he knew full well that he had been elected, and had
served, as mayor ofMabalacat, Pampanga for three consecutive
terms; yet, he still certified that he was eligible to run for mayor
for the next succeeding term.
The rule on succession under Section 44 of RA 7160, as
espoused by Halili, would not apply if the permanent vacancy
was caused by one whose COC was void ab initio. In case of
vacancies caused by those with void ab initio COCs, the person
legally entitled to the vacant position would be the candidate
who garnered the next highest number of votes among those
eligible. In this case, it is Garbo who is legally entitled to the
position of mayor, having garnered the highest number of votes
among the eligible candidates. Thus, the COMELEC correctly
proclaimed Garbo as mayor of Mabalacat City.
We DISMISS the petitions for lack of merit and AFFIRM
the assailed Resolution of the Commission on Elections First
Division and the Resolution of the Commission Elections En
Banc.
12. The DILG's execution of the 0MB decisions for the
petitioner's dismissal clearly constituted loss of the petitioner's title
to the office. The dismissals were involuntary interruptions in the
petitioner's 2016-2019 term. As such, he cannot be considered to
have fully served a third successive term of office.
TALLAD O v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS

G.R. No. 246679, September 10, 2019, Bersamin, C.J.
Facts: Petitioner Edgardo Tallado was duly elected as
Governor of the Province of Camarines Norte in the 2010,
2013 and 2016 elections. He fully served his 2010-2013 and
2013--2016 terms. It is the turn of events in respect of the
petitioner's 2016-2019 term that has spawned the controversy
under review. Twice, the DILG implemented the decisions of
the Ombudsman dismissing Tallada in November, 2016 and
in 2018.

Book I- General Provisions
Title Two Elective Officials

197

Ruling: We conclude that the "interruption" of a term
exempting an elective official from the three-term limit rule
is one that involves no less than the involuntary loss of title to
office. The elective official must have involuntarily left his office
for a length of time, however short, for an effective interruption
to occur. This has to be the case if the thrust of Section 8,
Article X and its strint intent are to be faithfully served, i.e., to
limit an elective official's continuous stay in office to no more
than three consecutive terms, using "voluntary renunciation"
as an example and standard of what does not constitute an
interruption. Thus, based on this standard, loss of office by
operation of law, being involuntary, is an effective interruption
of service within a term.
The OMB's Rules mandated that decisions handed down
in administrative cases should be immediately executory
despite being timely appealed. Thus, it was clear that what
were to be executed were the decisions of the Ombudsman
without consideration as to their finality.
The DILG's execution of the 0MB decisions for the
petitioner's dismissal clearly constituted loss of the petitioner's
title to the office. The dismissals were involuntary interruptions
in the petitioner's 2016-2019 term. As such, he cannot be
considered to have fully served a third successive term of office.
In fine, the petitioner was not disqualified from seeking
the same elective post during the 2019 elections. The
COMELEC thus gravely abused its discretion in ordering the
cancellation of the petitioner's Certificate of Candidacy for the
2019 elections.
The Court GRANTS the petition for certiorari.
CHAPTER 2. Vacancies and Succession
SEC, 44. Permanent Vacancies in the Offices

of the Governor, Vice-Governor, Mayor, and ViceMayor.
(a) If a permanent vacancy occurs in the
office of the governor or mayor, the vice-governor
or vice mayor concerned shall become the governor
or mayor. If a permanent vacancy occurs in the
offices of the governor, vice-governor, mayor,

or vice mayor, the highest ranking sanggunian
member or, in case of his permanent inability, the

second highest ranking sanggunian member, shall

198

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

become the governor, vice-governor, mayor or vicemayor, as the case may be. Subsequent vacancies
in the said office shall be filled automatically by
the other sanggunian members according to their
ranking as defined herein.
(b) If a permanent vacancy occurs in the
office of the punong barangay, the highest ranking
sanggunian barangay member or, in case of his
permanent inability, the second highest ranking
sanggunian member, shall become the punong
barangay.
(c) A tie between or among the highest
ranking sanggunian members shall be resolved by
the drawing of lots.
(d) The successors as defined herein shall serve
only the unexpired terms of their predecessors.
For purposes of this Chapter, a permanent
vacancy arises when an elective local official fills a
higher vacant office, refuses to assume office, fails
to qualify, dies, is removed from office, voluntarily
resigns, or is otherwise permanently incapacitated
to discharge the functions of his office.
For purposes of succession as provided in
this Chapter, ranking in the sanggunian shall be
determined on the basis of the proportion of votes
obtained by each winning candidate to the total
number of registered voters in each district in the
immediately preceding local election.

Title Two - Elective Officials

the governor, leaving vacant his post as vice governor. Under
the law, Azana's position as vice-governor should be occupied
by the highest ranking Sangguniang member, a post being
contested by petitioner and private respondent.
The COMELEC certified private respondent James
Calisin as first in the order of ranking based on the number 'if
(sic) votes obtained by the Sanggunian members in relation to
the number of registered voters in the district. (Calisin - 28,335
votes of 129,793 registered voters is 21.83%; Victoria - 32,918
votes of 154,665 registered voters is 21.28%)
Petitioner Juan Victoria claims that the ranking of the
Sanggunian members should not only be based on the number
of votes obtained in relation to the total number of registered
voters, but also on the number of votes in the district who
actually voted therein. He further argues that a district
may have a large number of registered voters but only a few
actually voted, in which case the winning candidate would
register a low percentage of the number of votes obtained.
Conversely, a district may have a smaller number of registered
voter's (sic) turn[ ]out, in which case the winning candidate
would get a higher percentage of the votes. Applying this
formula, petitioner would come out to be the highest ranking
Sangguniang member.
Petitioner gives the following illustration:

for petitioner
121,423 (actually voted)

Held: The law is clear that the ranking in the Sanggunian
shall be determined on the basis of the proportion of the votes
obtained by each winning candidate to the total number of
registered voters of each district. It does not mention anything
about factoring the number of voters who actually voted. In

200

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

such case, the Court has no recourse but to merely apply the
law. The courts may not speculate as to the probable intent
of the legislature apart from the words. (Pascual v. Pascual-

Bautista, 207 SCRA 561 [1992].)
Petitioner's contention is therefore untenable considering
the clear mandate of the law, which leaves no room for other
interpretation. We are not unmindful of the practicality of
petitioner's interpretation but it must very well be addressed
to the legislative branch and not to this Court which has no
power to change the law.
WHEREFORE, the petition is DISMISSED.
2.
The vacancy in the position of vice-mayor due to the
ineligibility ofthe winning candidate should be filled up in accordance
with Section 44 of the LGC which provides that the highest ranking
sanggunian member shall become vice-mayor.

RECABO v. COMELEC
308 SCRA 793, June 21, 1999, Gonzaga-Reyes, J.
Facts: Private respondent Reyes, Jr., has filed a motion
in this Court to the effect that in the event this Court affirms
the non-qualification of petitioner Recabo, Jr., he should be
proclaimed the winner and assume the position of vice-mayor
of the Municipality of Mainit, Surigao del Norte. Apparently,
respondent Reyes, Jr. is counting on the certificate of votes to
establish that he is the second highest winning candidate.

Held: It is settled that the disqualification or nonqualification of the winner in a vice-mayoralty race does not
justify the proclamation of the defeated candidate who obtained
the second highest number of votes. Hence, in the event that
herein petitioner Kaiser Recabo, Jr. obtained the plurality of
votes in the elections for Vice-Mayor of the Municipality of
Mainit, the vacancy due to his ineligibility should be filled up
in accordance with Section 44 of the Local Government Code
of 1991 which provides that the highest ranking sanggunian
member shall become the vice-mayor.
We find that the respondent Commission did not act
without jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in
cancelling and denying due course to petitioner Recabo Jr.'s
certificate of candidacy.

BAUTISTA v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
414 SCRA 299, October 23, 2003, Carpio, J.
Facts: On 10 June 2002, Bautista filed his certificate
of candidacy for Punong Barangay in Lumbangan, Nasugbu,
Batangas for the 15 July 2002 barangay elections. On 11
July 2002, the COMELEC Law Department recommended
the cancellation of Bautista's certificate of candidacy since he
was not registered as a voter in Lumbangan. The COMELEC
en bane failed to act on the COMELEC Law Department's
recommendation before the barangay elections on 15July 2002.
During the 15 July 2002 barangay elections, Bautista
and private respondent Divina Alcoreza were candidates for
the position of Punong Barangay in Lumbangan. Bautista
obtained the highest number of votes (719) while Alcoreza
came in second with 522 votes, or a margin of 197 votes.

Ruling: According to Bautista's affidavit, he was
practically out of the country from 1995 until 2001. When the
certified list of voters ceased to be effective and operative after
the barangay elections in 1997, qualified voters had to register
again to vote in any election. Apparently, Bautista failed to
register during the general registration of voters conducted
by the COMELEC in 1997 since he was still out of the
country during that time. Republic Act No. 8189 ("The Voter's
Registration Act of 1996") provides for a system of continuing
registration of voters. Thus, Bautista should have registered
anew in the office of the Election Officer when he came back
to the Philippines in 2001 and learned that his name was no
longer included in the roster of registered voters.
It is thus clear that Bautista was remiss in his duty to
ensure his right to vote and to be voted for public office. As
early as 2001, he was already aware that his name was no
longer included in the roster of registered voters. Yet, Bautista
chose not to register anew that year despite his knowledge that
he needed to register as a voter in the barangay to run for the
office of Punong Barangay.

The Local Government Code provides for the rule
regarding permanent vacancy in the Office of the Punong
Barangay, thus:
SEC. 44. Permanent vacancies in the Offices of the
Governor, Vice-Governor, Mayor, and Vice-Mayor.
(b) If a permanent vacancy occurs in the office
of the punong barangay member, the highest ranking
sangguniang barangay member, or in the case of his
permanent disability, the second highest ranking
sanggunian member, shall become the punong barangay.
Since Bautista failed to qualify for the position of Punong
Barangay, the highest ranking sangguniang barangay member,
or in the case of his permanent disability, the second highest
ranking sangguniang member, shall become the Punong
Barangay
We DISMISS the petition. Petitioner Raymundo A.
Bautista is ineligible for the position of Punong Barangay
of Barangay Lumbangan for not being a registered voter
of Barangay Lumbangan. The proclamation of the second
placer Divina Alcoreza as winner in lieu of Bautista is void.
Instead, the highest ranking sangguniang barangay member
of Barangay Lumbangan shall assume the office of Punong
Barangay of Lumbangan for the unexpired portion of the term.

Respondent-judge patently erred in recognizing Omera as
the legitimate Barangay Chairman merely by virtue of the mayor's
appointment. Permanent vacancies in elective positions are filled

BOGABONG v. BALINDONG
A.M. No. RTJ-18-2537, August 14, 2019, Per Curiam
Facts: As the elected First Kagawad of Barangay
Bubonga Marawi, Marawi City, Lanao de! Sur in the July
2002 Barangay Elections, complainant Abdulsamad Bogabong
assumed office as Barangay Chairman in hold-over capacity
by operation of law due to the death of Dianisia P. Bacarat,
incumbent Chairman in holdover capacity due to failure of
elections on December 15, 2007. On April 9 and 10, 2008, the
DILG, Provincial Director Haroun Alrashid A. Lucman, Jr.

Book I- General Provisions
Title Two Elective Officials

203

issued Certifications to attest to complainant's assumption as
Barangay Chairman.
On April 10, 2008, however, Marawi City Mayor Fahad
U. Salic appointed a certain civilian, Omera Hadji Isa-Ali
(Omera) as Barangay Chairman. In a Certification dated May
7, 2008, Director Lucman recognized Omera as the legitimate
Barangay Chairman.
Complainant filed a letter-complaint before the DILG,
Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), to question
Omera's appointment. In a DILG-ARMM Resolution dated
May 5, 2009, complainant was again acknowledged as the
legitimate Barangay Chairman in hold-over capacity. By virtue
thereof, complainant again took over chairmanship in holdover capacity of Barangay Bubonga Marawi. As Chairman,
complainant was able to withdraw the May 2009 Internal
Revenue Allotment (IRA) of the baran gay.
This prompted Omera to file the quo warranto case
against complainant.
Thereafter, in his Decision dated August 24, 2009,
respondent-judge granted Omera's Petition for Quo Warranto
and held that complainant's right to the position was deemed
waived as he failed to assume office within one year and two
months after Bacarat's death.
Ruling: In this case, as found by the CA and the OCA,
respondent-judge's actions are more than mere errors of
judgment that can be excused and left to the judicial remedy of
review by the appellate court for correction.
Respondent-judge patently erred in recognizing Omera
as the legitimate Barangay Chairman merely by virtue of
the mayor's appointment. As held by the CA, basic is the rule
under existing and established laws that permanent vacancies
in elective positions are filled through automatic succession,
not by appointment.
Respondent-judge also patently erred in issuing a TRO
and WPI without requiring the applicant to post a bond.
Section 4, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court.
Lastly, respondent-judge also gravely erred when he
granted Omera's motion for execution pending appeal when
there was no evidence presented to justify the same.

Secretary, in the case of the sangguniang
panlalawigan and the sangguniang panlungsod

Where vacancy is caused by a Sanggunian Bayan member
not belonging to a political party, the Governor, upon recommendation
by the Sanggunian Bayan, appoints the replacement.

FARINAS v. BARBA
256 SCRA 396, April 19, 1996, Mendoza, J.
Facts: Carlita B. Domingo was a member of the
Sangguniang Bayan of San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte. On March 24,
1994, he resigned after going without leave to the United States.
The Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Ilocos Norte recommended
to Governor Rodolfo Farinas the appointment of petitioner Al
Nacino, vice Domingo. On June 8, 1994, petitioner Governor
appointed petitioner Nacino and swore him in office that same
day.
On the . other hand, respondent Mayor Barba upon
recommendation of the Sangguniang Bayan of San Nicolas,
appointed respondent Edward Palafox to the same position on
June 8, 1994. The next day, June 9, 1994, respondent Palafox
took his oath as member of the Sangguniang Bayan.
Held: Indeed there is no reason for supposing that
those who drafted Section 45 intended to make the manner
of filing vacancies in the Sanggunians, created by members
who do not belong to any political party, different from the
manner of filing such vacancies when created by members
who belong to political party or parties. The provision for the

206

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

cases where the temporary incapacity is due to
legal causes, the local chief executive concerned
shall also submit necessary documents showing
that said legal causes no longer exist.

first must approximate the provision for the second situation.
Any difference in procedure must be limited to the fact that
in the case of vacancies caused by those who have political
affiliations there is a party which can nominate a replacement
while there is none in the case of those who have no political
affiliation. Accordingly, where there is no political party to
make a nomination, the Sanggunian, where the vacancy occurs,
must be considered the appropriate authority for making
the recommendation, by analogy to vacancies created in the
Sangguniang Barangay whose members are by law prohibited
from having any party affiliation.

(c) When the incumbent local chief executive
is traveling within the country but outside his
territorial jurisdiction for a period not exceeding
three (3) consecutive days, he may designate in
writing the officer-in-charge of the said office.
Such authorization shall specify the powers and
functions that the local official concerned shall
exercise in the absence of the local chief executive
except the power to appoint, suspend, or dismiss
employees.

The upshot of this is that in the case at bar, since neither
petitioner Al Nacino nor respondent Edward Palafox was
appointed in the manner indicated in the preceding discussion,
neither is entitled to the seat in the Sangguniang Bayan of
San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte which was vacated by member
Carlito B. Domingo. For while petitioner Al Nacino was
appointed by the provincial governor, he was not recommended
by the Sangguniang Bayan of San Nicolas. On the other
hand, respondent Edward Palafox was recommended by the
Sangguniang Bayan but it was the mayor and not the provincial
governor who appointed him.

(d) In the event, however, that the local
chief executive concerned fails or refuses to issue
such authorization, the vice-governor, the city
or municipal vice-mayor, or the highest ranking
sangguniang barangay member, as the case may be,
shall have the right to assume the powers, duties,
and functions of the said office on the fourth (4th)
day of absence of the said local chief executive,
subject to the limitations provided in subsections
(c) hereof.

to, leave of absence, travel abroad, and suspension
from office, the vice-governor, city or municipal
vice mayor, or the highest ranking sangguniang
barangay member shall automatically exercise the
powers and perform the duties and functions of the
local chief executive concerned, except the power
to appoint, suspend, or dismiss employees which
can only be exercised if the period of temporary
incapacity exceeds thirty (30) working days.
(b) Said temporary incapacity shall terminate
upon submission to the appropriate sanggunian of
a written declaration by the local chief executive
concerned that he has reported back to office. In

BUNYE v. ESCAREAL
226 SCRA 332, September 10, 1993,
Grino-Aquino, J.
Facts: This petition for certiorari and prohibition was filed
by the petitioners, who are the municipal mayor, vice-mayor and
incumbent councilors or members of the Sangguniang Bayan
of Muntinlupa, Metro Manila. The petition seeks to annul
the resolution promulgated on May 11, 1993 by the Second
Division of the Sandiganbayan preventively suspending them
from office pending their trial for violation of Section 3(e) of
the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act under an information
alleging that said accused, while in the performance of their
official functions, forcibly took possession of the New Public
Market in Ala bang, Muntinlupa, Metro Manila, and thereafter
took over the operation and management of the aforesaid
public market starting August 19, 1988, despite the fact that
there was a valid and subsisting lease contract executed
on September 2, 1985 for a term of 25 years, renewable for
another 25 years, between the Municipality of Muntinlupa,
Metro Manila, represented by the former Municipal Mayor
Santiago Carlos, Jr., and the Kilusang Bayan sa Paglilingkod
ng mga Magtitinda ng Bagong Pamilihan ng Muntinlupa, Inc.
(Kilusang Magtitinda, for brevity), Cooperative represented by
its General Manager, then Amado G. Perez.
Petitioners assert that their preventive suspension will
"sow havoc and confusion in the government of the Municipality
of Muntinlupa, to the certain shattering of the peace and order
thereat," for without a mayor, vice-mayor and six (6) councilors,
the local government would be paralyzed.

Held: The Court finds no merit in those arguments.
Section 13 of R.A. No. 3019, as amended, unequivocally
provides that the accused public officials "shall be suspended
from office" while the criminal prosecution is pending in court.
In Gonzaga vs. Sandiganbayan, 201 SCRA 417, 426, this
Court ruled that such preventive suspension is mandatory;
there are no ifs and buts about it.
All told, preventive suspension is not violative of
the Constitution as it is not a penalty. In fact, suspension
particularly under Section 13 of Rep. Act 3019 is mandatory
once the validity of the information is determined.

The fear of the petitioners that the municipal government
of Muntinlupa will be paralyzed for ninety (90) days when
they (petitioners) are preventively suspended, is remote.
There will still remain eight (8) councilors who can meet as
the Sangguniang Bayan. The President or his alter ego, the
Secretary of Interior and Local Government, will surely know
how to deal with the problem of filling up the temporarily
vacant positions of mayor, vice-mayor and six councilors in
accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Code
R.A. 7160.

Under Section 46 of the Local Government Code, the vicemayor automatically assumes the powers and duties of the mayor in
case of the latter's temporary absence. The acting mayor may sue on
behalf of the municipality.

VELASCO v. SANDIGANBAYAN
691 SCRA 293, February 20, 2013, Perez, J.
Facts: A complaint for malversation and violation of the
Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act on the purchase of a
Road Grader was filed by then Mayor Philip Velasco against
former Mayor Pacifico Velasco, now petitioner. The Office of
the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon dismissed the complaint
for lack of probable cause. Then Acting Mayor Nicomedes Dela
Cruz moved for reconsideration. Petitioner filed a motion to
strike out the pleading grounded on the lack of legal personality
of Acting Mayor Dela Cruz to file the motion. The Office of the
Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon eventually denied the motion
for reconsideration.
However, upon instructions of the Deputy Ombudsman for
MOLEO, the Director of the Office of Chief Legal Counsel, after
reviewing the case, recommended the fling of an Information
for Technical Malversation. Petitioner, thus, fled an Omnibus
Motion for Reconsideration. The Office of the Special Prosecutor
denied petitioner's motion and filed the Information for
technical malversation before the Sandiganbayan.

Ruling: Petitioner Pacifico Velasco brings up the alleged
incapacity of Acting Mayor Dela Cruz to fle a motion for
reconsideration pertaining to the earlier 13 February 2004
Resolution which dismissed the complaint against him. This
argument cannot prosper. Acting Mayor Dela Cruz, in fact,

did possess the legal capacity to file the motion on behalf of
the local government unit he represented. Under Section 46
of the Local Government Code, the vice-mayor automatically
assumes the powers and duties of the mayor in case of the
latter's temporary absence.

(b) Whenever the application for leave of
absence herein above specified is not acted upon
within five (5) working days after receipt thereof,
the application for leave of absence shall be deemed
approved.

In fact, Acting Mayor Dela Cruz explained that at
that time he filed the motion, Mayor Philip Velasco was "on
official vacation leave and out of the country." It is likewise
incontrovertible that Mayor Philip Velasco instituted the
complaint in his capacity as then Mayor of Bacarra, Ilocos
Norte. Petitioner premises his challenge on legal standing on
the mere failure of the complainant to state in his complaint
that he was suing on behalf of the municipality. His argument
is specious. As correctly asserted by Mayor Philip Velasco in
his Comment/Opposition to the Motion to Strike, the property
sought to be recovered in the complaint will revert to the
municipality and not to him.
The instant petition for certiorari is DISMISSED.
SEC. 47. Approval of Leaves of Absence.

Comments

1.
Municipal ordinances are legislative acts passed by the
municipal council in the exercise of its law-making authority. They
are of permanent character as distinguished from resolutions, which
refer to its acts which are temporary in nature or which involve
ministerial duties. (Sinco, Philippine Political Law, pp. 721-725.)
The power to enact ordinances carries with it the power to
change or repeal them, provided that vested rights are not thereby
impaired and repeals are valid only when passed in a certain
manner which should be definite and should relate specifically
to the ordinance which should be repealed. No ordinance may be
changed by a mere resolution for a new ordinance is necessary to
effect a repeal and the mode provided in a charter or law for the
passage of ordinances should be strictly followed in the enactment
of measures intended to amend, repeal, or modify prior ones; so that
if ordinances are to be passed in written form, they may be repealed
only by means of written ordinances, and oral ordinances or written
resolutions purported to repeal prior ordinances may not, in such
cases, be considered valid enactments. (Ibid.)
An ordinance to be valid must not only be within the corporate
powers of the municipality to enact, but must also be passed
according to the procedure prescribed by law, and must be in
consonance with certain well-established and basic principles of law

212

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

of a substantive nature which require that a municipal ordinance
must not: 1) contravene the Constitution or any statute, 2) be unfair
or oppressive, 3) be partial or discriminatory, 4) prohibit but may
regulate trade, 5) be specific and consistent with public policy, and
6) be unreasonable. (Ibid.)
2.
The rationale of the requirement that the ordinances
should not contravene a statute is obvious. Municipal governments
are only agents of the national government. Local councils exercise
only delegated legislative powers conferred on them by Congress
as the national lawmaking body. The delegate cannot be superior
to the principal or exercise powers higher than those of the latter.
It is a heresy to suggest that the local government units can undo
the acts of Congress, from which they have derived their power in
the first place, and negate by mere ordinance the mandate of the
statute. (Magtajas v. Pryce Properties Corp., Inc., 234 SCRA 255.)
This basic relationship between the national legislature and
the local government units has not been enfeebled by the new
provisions in the Constitution strengthening the policy of local
autonomy. Without meaning to detract from that policy, we here
confirm that Congress retains control of the local government
units although insignificantly reduced degree now then under
our previous Constitutions. The power to create still includes the
power to destroy. The power to create still includes the power to
withhold or recall. True, there are certain notable innovations in
the Constitution, like the direct conferment on the local government
units of the power to tax, which cannot now be withdrawn by mere
statute. By and large however, the national legislature is still the
principal of the local government units, which cannot defy its will or
modify or violate it. (Ibid.)
3.
The municipal council cannot, by resolution, remove
the municipal mayor from office. And even if the feeling of the
inhabitants of a municipality be against an incumbent mayor, the
President cannot, as already stated, remove a municipal mayor
from office except for cause as provided by law and in the manner
prescribed therein. It is only at the proper time, by the exercise of
the citizen's right of suffrage at the periodic elections to be held,
that the people may directly exercise its power of removal with or
without cause. (Cometa v. Andanar, 95 Phil. 604.)
4.
"Decision" of committee of municipal council exonerating
policeman is not valid, such power is vested exclusively in the
council. (Marifosque v. Luna, 101 Phil. 1223.)

5.
Members of a municipal council may pass a resolution or
decision thereof only when duly assembled in session, as such body.
Their individual separate acts, when not gathered in session, held in
accordance with law are not acts of the council and do not carry the
authority thereof. It is well settled that corporate proceedings cannot
be conducted by individual councilors. There must be a meeting for
deliberation, consultation and corporate action. (Handbook on the
Law of Municipal Corporation by R. W. Cooley, pp. 154-155.)
6.
"The power of a municipal council must be exercised at a
meeting which is legally called. Action of all the members of council
separately is not the action of the council, and an agreement entered
into separately by the members of the council outside a regular
meeting is not binding." (Am. Jur., Vol. 37, p. 669.)
7.
After the rendition of the decision ordering the
reinstatements of the petitioner and the payment of their back
salaries, the municipal council of Guimba, Nueva Ecija passed
resolution assuming the responsibility for and authorizing and
inclusion of the back salaries in the budget. There, is however, no
ordinance appropriating the amount until the present. At most, the
resolutions were only proposals to have the amount included in the
"forthcoming budgets." A resolution is ordinarily a declaration of a
council, or a legislative body, evincing some purpose or intent to do
some act not the doing of the act itself. It is the intention to enter
upon some enterprise of public moment, something authorized by
law that it may do. (W.B. Gibson Co. v. Arren Metropolitan Housing
Authority, 29 N.E. 2D 236.) In the case at bar, the resolution
assuming the obligation is considered as merely an intention on
the part of the council to have the amount equivalent to the back
salaries of appellees, included in the budget. A resolution may have
the expression of intending, but in order to become effectual, it must
be expressed by legislative enactment, that is by ordinance. (City of
Owensboro v. Ed. of Trustees, etc., 301 Ky. 113, 190 SW [2d] 1005,
1008.) In this jurisdiction, all municipal legislation creating liability
should be embodied in an appropriation ordinance. (Section 2298,
Revised Administrative Code.) In the case under consideration, not
only was there no appropriation ordinance wherein the amounts
involved have been included in the budget of the municipality,
but the municipal council itself had subsequently disallowed the
inclusion of the same in the budget. The Revised Administrative
Code further provides that the disbursements of municipal funds
shall be made by the municipal treasurer, upon property executed

214

vouchers, pursuant to the budget. (Section 2300.) The Constitution
also provides that "no money shall be paid out of the Treasury, except
in pursuance of an appropriation made by law." (Article VI, Section
23, [2], Constitution of the Philippines.) (Discanso v. Gatmaytan, 109
Phil. 916.)
8.
It has been held that "even where the statute or municipal
charter requires the municipality to act by ordinance, if a resolution
is passed in []the manner and with the statutory formality required
in the enactment of an ordinance, it will be binding and effective as
an ordinance." (Favis v. City of Baguio, 27 SCRA 1060.)
9.
An ordinance intended solely to favor a person or group of
persons, is null and void for being partial. (Sarmiento v. Belderol, 2
SCRA 477.)
10. A municipal ordinance is not the same as a resolution
of the municipal council. Legislative acts passed by the municipal
council in the exercise of its lawmaking authority are denominated
ordinances. A resolution is less solemn and formal than an ordinance.
(Mascunana v. Prov'! Board of Negros Occidental, 79 SCRA 399.)
11. Whenever there is a conflict between an ordinance and
a statute, the ordinance must give way. (Primicias v. Municipality
of Urdaneta, Pangasinan, 93 SCRA 462.) A local legislative body
intending to control traffic in public highways is supposed to classify
first, and then mark them with proper signs, all to be approved by
the Land Transportation. (Ibid.)

215

Decided Case

1.
A vice-governor who is concurrently an acting governor
is actually a quasi-governor. For the purpose of exercising his
legislative prerogatives and powers, he is deemed a non-member of
the SP for the time being.
GAMBOA v. AGUIRRE
310 SCRA 867, July 20, 1999, Ynares-Santiago, J.
Facts: In the 1995 elections, Rafael Coscolluella, petitioner
Romeo J. Gamboa, Jr., and respondents Marcelo Aguirre, Jr.,
and Juan Y. Araneta were elected Negros Occidental Governor,
Vice-Governor and SP members, respectively. Sometime in
August of 1995, the governor designated Gamboa as Acting
Governor for the duration of the farmer's official trip abroad
until his return.
When the SP held its regular session on September
6, 1995, respondents questioned the authority of petitioner
Gamboa to preside therein in view of his designation as Acting
Governor and asked him to vacate the Chair. The latter,
however, refused to do so.
Held: A Vice-Governor who is concurrently an Acting
Governor is actually a quasi-Governor. This means, that for
purposes of exercising his legislative prerogatives and powers,
he is deemed as a non-member of the SP for the time being.
Being the Acting Governor, the Vice-Governor cannot
continue to simultaneously exercise the duties of the latter
office, since the nature of the duties of the provincial Governor
call for a fulltime occupant to discharge them. Such is not only
consistent with but also appears to be the clear rationale of
the new Code wherein the policy of performing dual functions
in both offices has already been abandoned. To repeat, the
creation of a temporary vacancy in the office of the Governor
creates a corresponding temporary vacancy in the office of the
Vice-Governor whenever the latter acts as Governor by virtue
of such temporary vacancy.
This event constitutes an "inability" on the part of the
regular presiding officer (Vice-Governor) to preside during the
SP sessions, which, thus, calls for the operation of the remedy
set in Article 49(b) of the Local Government Code
c oncerning
the election of a temporary presiding officer. The continuity of

216

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the Acting Governor's (Vice[-]Governor) powers as presiding
officer of the SP is suspended so long as he is in such capacity.
Under Section 49(b) "(i)n the event of the inability of the
regular presiding officer to preside at the sanggunian session,
the members present and constituting a quorum shall elect
from among themselves a temporary presiding officer."
2.
The Vice Governor, as the Presiding Officer, shall be
considered a part of the SP for purposes of ascertaining if a quorum
exists. In determining the number which constitutes as the majority
vote, the Vice Governor is excluded. The Vice Governor's right to vote
is merely contingent and arises only when there is a tie to break.

JAVIER v. CADIAO
799 SCRA 295, August 3, 2016, Reyes, J.
Facts: For the years 2007 to 2010, one of the herein
respondents, Vice Governor Rhodora J. Cadiao, was the
presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.
On the first regular session of the SP held on July 5, 2007,
the Lakas ng Tao-Christian Muslim Democrats (Lakas-CMD)
block was considered as the majority party. Among those who
belonged to the said party were J. Tobias M. Javier, Vincent
Piccio Ill (collectively, the petitioners), Vice Governor Cadiao
and SP member Benjamin E. Juanitas. Piccio was designated
as the Majority Floor Leader.
On the other hand, the Nationalist People's Coalition
(NPC) was considered as the minority party with four members,
including the herein respondent, Alfonso V. Combong, Jr.
However, another SP member, who won as an independent
candidate, allied with the NPC.
Additionally, the SP has three ex-officio members: the
President of the Councilors' League of Antique, the President
of the Association of Barangay Captains, and the President of
the Sangguniang Kabataan Federation.
Thereafter, for personal reasons, Juanitas left the majority
party and joined the NPC, which was then headed by Combong.
Vice Governor Cadiao followed suit. Subsequently realizing
that the NPC had gained superiority in numbers, Combong
proposed Resolution No. 42-2008 (Combong Resolution), which
sought to reorganize the standing committees of the SP. The

Book I General Provisions
Title 'Two Elective Officials

217

resolution was included as an "urgent matter" in the agenda of
the SP's fifth regular session.
During the SP's fifth regular session held on February
7, 2008, all the SP members were in attendance. Amidst fiery
arguments, the Combong Resolution was approved with seven
(7) voting in its favor, and six (6) against it. Consequently, Piccio
was replaced by Juanitas as Majority Floor Leader. Some of
the Lakas-CMD members were also divested of chairmanship
or membership in the SP's standing committees.
To challenge the legality of the passage of the Combong
Resolution, the Lakas-CMD block, composed of Javier, Piccio,
Rosie A. Dimamay, Errol T. Santillan, Edgar D. Denosta and
Carlos M. Palacios (plaintiffs), filed before the RTCa Complaint
for Injunction with Urgent Prayer for the Issuance of a
Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction.

Ruling: The Vice Governor, as the Presiding Officer, shall
be considered a part of the SP for purposes of ascertaining if a
quorum exists. In determining the number which constitutes
as the majority vote, the Vice Governor is excluded. The Vice
Governor's right to vote is merely contingent and arises only
when there is a tie to break.
In the instant petition, when the Combong Resolution
was deliberated upon, all the ten (10) regular and three (3)
ex-officio members, plus the Presiding Officer, were present.
Seven members voted for, while six voted against the Combong
Resolution. There was no tie to break as the majority vote had
already been obtained.
To hold that the Presiding Officer should be counted
in determining the required number of votes necessary to
uphold a matter before the SP shall be counter-productive. It
would admit deadlocks as ordinary incidents in the conduct of
business of the SP, which in effect incapacitates the said body
from addressing every issue laid before it. In the process, the
SP's responsiveness, effectivity and accountability towards the
affairs of the body politic would be diminished.
Verily, the Vice Governor, as the SP's Presiding Officer,
should be counted for purposes of ascertaining the existence of
a quorum, but not in the determination of the required number
of votes necessary to uphold a matter before the SP.

A.

Decided Case

1.
The law does not require the completion of the updating or
adoption of the internal rules of procedures before the Sanggunian
could act on any other matter like the enactment of an ordinance.

MALONZO v. ZAMORA
323 SCRA 875, January 28, 2000, De Leon, Jr., J.
Facts: Respondents maintain that Ordinance No. 0254,
Series of 1998 of the Sanggunian Panlungsod of Caloocan
City providing a supplemental budget was enacted without
sufficient compliance with the requirement of Section 50 of
the Local Government Code requiring that house rules be first
adopted or updated.
Held: The records satisfactorily show, however, that the
Sanggunian took up the matter of adopting a set of house rules
in its general meeting entitled, "Katitikan ng Karaniwang
Pulong ng Sangguniang Panlungsod na ginanap noong ika-2
ng Hulyo 1998 sa Bagong Gusali ng Pamahalaang Lungsod ng
Caloocan." During said meeting, the Sanggunian created an
Ad Hoc Committee composed of seven (7) members to study
the existing house rules. Thereafter, it enacted Ordinance No.
0254, Series of 1998.

As we have held in our Decision dated July 27, 1999,
such succession of events is legally permissible. The law does
not require the completion of the updating or adoption of the
internal rules of procedure before the Sanggunian could act
on any other matter like the enactment of an ordinance. It
simply requires that the matter of adopting or updating the
internal rules of procedure be taken up during the first day of
session. It would be inequitable to read something more into
the requirement of the law and use it as a basis for finding
petitioners guilty of misconduct, especially when the charge is
serious enough to warrant a penalty of suspension from office
for three (3) months without pay.

business, financial, or professional relationship or
any relation by affinity or consanguinity within the
fourth civil degree, which he may have with any
person, firm, or entity affected by any ordinance or
resolution under consideration by the sanggunian
of which he is a member, which relationship may
result in conflict of interest. Such relationship
shall include:

the ordinance or resolution on second and
third readings; and
(2) Disclosure shall be made when a
member takes a position or makes a privilege

investment, in the entity or firm to which the
ordinance or resolution may apply; and

SEC. 52. Sessions.
(a) On the frst day of
the session immediately following the election of
its members, the sanggunian shall, by resolution,
fix the day, time, and place of its regular sessions.
The minimum number of regular sessions shall be
once a week for the sangguniang panlalawigan,
sangguniang panlungsod, and sangguniang bayan,
and twice a month for the sangguniang barangay.

(2) Contracts or agreements with any
person or entity which the ordinance or
resolution under consideration may affect.

(b) When public interest so demands, special
sessions may be called by the local chief executive
or by a majority of the members of the sanggunian.

In the absence of a specific constitutional or
statutory provision applicable to this situation,
"conflict of interest" refers in general to one where
it may be reasonably deduced that a member of
a sanggunian may not act in the public interest
due to some private, pecuniary, or other personal
considerations that may tend to affecthisjudgement
to the prejudice of the service or the public.

(c) All sanggunian sessions shall be open to
the public unless a closed-door session is ordered
by an affirmative vote of a majority of the members
present, there being a quorum, in the public interest
or for reasons of security, decency, or morality. No
two (2) sessions, regular or special, may be held in
a single day.

(b) The disclosure required under this Act
shall be made in writing and submitted to the
secretary of the sanggunian or the secretary of the
committee of which he is a member. The disclosure
shall, in all cases, form part of the record of the
proceedings and shall be made in the following
manner:
(1) Disclosure shall be made before the
member participates in the deliberations
on the ordinance or resolution under
consideration: Provided, That, if the member
did not participate during the deliberations,
the disclosure shall be made before voting on

(d) In the case of special sessions of the
sanggunian, a written notice to the members shall
be served personally at the member's usual place of
residence at least twenty-four (24) hours before the
special session is held.
Unless otherwise concurred in by two-thirds

Comm ents

l.
The point raised by petitioner-appellant is the legality of
the enactment of the ordinance on February 28, 1958, without having
been included in the agenda for that day. Again, there is nothing
in the law that requires that matters discussed by the Municipal
Board be placed in the agenda. If there is any such requirement, it
is wholly parliamentary and procedural, noncompliance with which
does not affect the validity of the ordinance. (43 CJS 527.) (Subido
v. City of Manila, 108 Phil. 462.)
As to the question of nominal voting, there is authority to the
effect that "where the council or a municipality is composed of a
certain number of members, and it appears from the minutes of
a meeting that such number voted in favor of a resolution, this is
equivalent to stating that the members voted yes and it is substantial
and sufficient compliance with a statute requiring yea and nay votes
on any such resolution." (37 Am. Jur., pp. 756-757.) It appears from
the minutes of the Board meeting of February 28, 1958 that the
names of the members present as well as those who were absent
have been recorded, and that all those present took active part in
the debates and deliberations. At the end of the session, when the
presiding officer asked the members if there were any objections
to the approval of the proposed budget, only one councilor raised
an objection. The minutes, therefore could readily show who of the
members present in the deliberation voted pro and who voted con.
(Ibid.)
"While the mandatory prerequisites to enactment must be
substantially observed, exactness in the manner of enactment
may not be required, since noncompliance with merely formal
requirements in the manner of enactment ordinarily is considered
by the courts as no ground for declaring an ordinance void." (62 CJS

Decided Case

There is nothing in the law which prohibits that the three
readings of a proposed ordinance be held in just one session day.

MALONZO v. ZAMORA
323 SCRA 875, January 28, 2000, De Leon, Jr., J.
Facts: Respondents maintain that assuming that the
Sanggunian can legally take up matters pertaining to the

supplemental budget even before the adoption or updating of
its existing rules of procedure, the circumstances that preceded
the enactment of the supplemental budget were irregular since
there was undue haste in conducting the three (3) readings of
Ordinance No. 0254, Series of 1998, in one (d) session day.
Held: There is nothing in the law, however, which
prohibits that the three (3) readings of a proposed ordinance
be held in just one (1) session day. Respondents themselves
are aware of this. And it certainly is not the function of this
Court to speculate that the councilors were not given ample
time for reflection and circumspection before the passage of the
proposed ordinance by conducting the three (3) readings in just
one (1) day.
It might not be amiss to point out that the salaries of
the city employees were to be funded by the said ordinance
which embodied the supplemental budget for 1998, hence,
the urgency for its passage. Even the five (5) councilors who
abstained from voting for the passage of Ordinance 0254,
Series of 1998 took advantage of its benefits by submitting to
the office of petitioner Malonzo the names of the employees
assigned to their respective offices for salary and accounting
purposes.
SEC. 53. Quorum.
(a) A majority of all the
members of the sanggunian who have been elected
and qualified shall constitute a quorum to transact
official business. Should a question of quorum be
raised during a session, the presiding officer shall
imm ediately proceed to call the roll of the members
and thereafter announce the results.
(b) Where there is no quorum, the presiding
officer may declare a recess until such time as a
quorum is constituted or a majority of the members
present may adjourn from day to day and may
compel the imm ediate attendance of any member
absent without justifiable cause by designating
a member of the sanggunian, to be assisted by a
member or members of the police force assigned in
the territorial jurisdiction of the local government
unit concerned, to arrest the absent member and
present him at the session.

ordinance, an ordinance or resolution adopting
a local development plan and public investment
program, or an ordinance directing the payment
of money or creating liability. In such a case, the
veto shall not affect the item or items which are
not objected to. The vetoed item shall not take
effect unless the sanggunian overrides the veto in
the manner herein provided; otherwise, the item
or items in the appropriations ordinance of the
previous year corresponding to those vetoed, if any,
shall be deemed reenacted.

SEC. 54. Approval of Ordinances. - (a)
Every ordinance enacted by the sangguniang
panlalawigan,
sangguniang
panlungsod,
or
sangguniang bayan shall be presented to the
provincial governor or city or municipal mayor,
as the case may be. If the local chief executive
concerned approves the same, he shall affix his
signature on each and every page thereof; otherwise,
he shall veto it and return the same with his
objections to the sanggunian, which may proceed
to reconsider the same. The sanggunian concerned
may override the veto of the local chief executive
by two-thirds (2/3) vote of all its members, thereby
making the ordinance or resolution effective for all
legal intents and purposes.
(b) The veto shall be comm unicated by the
local chief executive concerned to the sanggunian
within fifteen (15) days in the case of a province, and
ten (10) days in the case of a city or a municipality;
otherwise, the ordinance shall be deemed approved
as if he had signed it
(c) Ordinances enacted by the sangguniang
barangay shall, upon approval by the majority of
all its members, be signed by the punong barangay.
SEC. 55. Veto Power of the Local Chief
Executive.
(a) The local chief executive may veto
any ordinance of the sangguniang panlalawigan,
sangguniang panlungsod, or sangguniang bayan
on the ground that it is ultra vires or prejudicial
to the public welfare, stating his reasons therefor
in writing.
(b) The local chief executive, except the
punong barangay, shall have the power to veto
any particular item or items of an appropriations

225

(c) The local chief executive may veto an
ordinance or resolution only once. The sanggunian
may override the veto of the local chief executive
concerned by two-thirds (2/3) vote ofall its members,
thereby making the ordinance effective even
without the approval of the local chief executive
concerned.

A.

Decided Case

1.
The approval of an ordinance where the local chief
executive affixes his signature is not a purely ministerial act. The
Mayor in fact has veto power. Here, the mayor took advantage of
his official position by signing the resolution the subject matter of
which was not taken up in the Sangguniang Bayan session. The
Sandiganbayan is directed to set the Criminal Case for arraignment
and trial.

DE LOS REYES v. SANDIGANBAYAN
281 SCRA 631, November 13, 1997, Romero, J.
Facts: Petitioner Mayor Oscar De los Reyes was
charged with the crime of falsification of a public document
specifically Resolution No. 57-S-92 of the Municipal Council of
Mariveles, Bataan. The complaint alleged that the resolution,
appropriating P8,500.00 for the terminal leave of two municipal
employees, was anomalous for not having been approved by the
said Council. It contended that its seeming passage was carried
out by petitioner in connivance with Sangguniang Bayan (SB)
Member Jesse Concepcion and SB Secretary Antonio Zurita.
After preliminary investigation, the deputized prosecutor of
Balanga, Bataan recommended the filing of an information

226

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

for Falsification of Public Document against petitioner and
Concepcion, excluding Zurita who died during the pendency
hereof.

Held: In an effort to exonerate himself from the charge,
petitioner argues that the deliberations undertaken and the
consequent passage of Resolution No. 57-S-92 are legislative in
nature. He adds that as local chief executive, he has neither the
official custody nor the duty to prepare said resolution. Hence,
he could not have taken advantage of his official position in
committing the crime of falsification as defined and punished
under Article 171 of the Revised Penal Code.
Petitioner would like to impress upon this Court that
the final step in the approval of an ordinance or resolution,
where the local chief executive affixes his signature, is purely
a mini sterial act. This view is erroneous. Article 109(b) of the
Local Government Code outlines the veto power of the Local
Chief Executive which provides: "Article 109 (b). The local chief
executive, except the punong barangay shall have the power to
veto any particular item or items of an appropriations ordinance,
an ordinance or resolution adopting a local development plan
and public investment program or an ordinance directing the
payment of money or creating liability."
Contrary to petitioner's belief, the grant of the veto power
confersauthority beyond the simple mechanical act of signing
an ordinance or resolution, as a requisite to its enforceability.
Such power accords the local chief executive the discretion to
sustain a resolution or ordinance in the first instance or to
veto it and return it with his objections to the Sanggunian,
which may proceed to reconsider the same. The Sanggunian
concerned, however, may override the veto by a two-thirds
(2/3) vote of all its members thereby making the ordinance
or resolution effective for all legal intents and purposes. It is
clear, therefore, that the concurrence of a local chief executive
in the enactment of an ordinance or resolution requires, not
only a flourish of the pen, but the application of judgment after
meticulous analysis and intelligence as well.
The minutes of the session reveal that petitioner
attended the session of Sangguniang Bayan on July 27, 1992.
It is evident, therefore, that petitioner approved the subject
resolution knowing fully well that "the subject matter treated

Book I- General Provisions
Title 'Two Elective Officials

227

therein was neither taken up and discussed nor passed upon
by the Sangguniang Bayan during the legislative session."
The Sandiganbayan is directed to set the Criminal Case
for arraignment and trial.
SEC. 56. Review of Component City and
Municipal Ordinances or Resolutions by the
Sangguniang Panlalawigan.
(a) Within three
(3) days after approval, the secretary to the
sanggunian panlungsod or sangguniang bayan
shall forward to the sangguniang panlalawigan
for review, copies of approved ordinances and the
resolutions approving the local development plans
and public investment programs formulated by the
local development councils.
(b) Within thirty (30) days after receipt of
copies of such ordinances and resolutions, the
sangguniang panlalawigan shall examine the
documents or transmit them to the provincial
attorney, or if there be none, to the provincial
prosecutor for prompt exami nation. The provincial
attorney or provincial prosecutor shall, within a
period often (10) days from receipt ofthe documents,
inform the sangguniang panlalawigan in writing of
his comm ents or recomm endation, which may be
considered by the sangguniang panlalawigan in
making its decision.
(c) If the sangguniang panlalawigan finds
that such an ordinance or resolution is beyond the
power conferred upon the sangguniang panlungsod
or sangguniang bayan concerned, it shall declare
such ordinance or resolution invalid in whole
or in part. The sangguniang panlalawigan shall
enter its action in the minutes and shall advise the
corresponding city or municipal authorities of the
action it has taken.
(d) If no action has been taken by the
sangguniang panlalawigan within thirty (30) days
after submission of such an ordinance or resolution,
the same shall be presumed consistent with law
and therefore valid.

SEC. 57. Review of Barangay Ordinances by the
Sangguniang Panlungsod or Sangguniang Bayan.
- (a) Within ten (10) days after its enactment,
the sangguniang barangay shall furnish copies
of all barangay ordinances to the sangguniang
panlungsod or sangguniang bayan concerned for
review as to whether the ordinance is consistent
with law and city or municipal ordinances.

(b) The secretary to the sanggunian concerned
shall cause the posting of an ordinance or
resolution in the bulletin board at the entrance of
the provincial capitol and the city, municipal, or
barangay hall in at least two (2) conspicuous places
in the local government unit concerned not later
than five (5) days after approval thereof.

(b) If the sangguniang panlungsod or
sangguniang bayan, as the case may be, fails to
take action on barangay ordinances within thirty
(30) days from receipt thereof, the same shall be
deemed approved.

The text of the ordinance or resolution shall
be disseminated and posted in Filipino or English
and in the language or dialect understood by the
majority of the people in the local government unit
concerned, and the secretary to the sanggunian
shall record such fact in a book kept for the purpose,
stating the dates of approval and posting.

(c) If the sangguniang panlungsod or
sangguniang bayan, as the case may be, finds the
barangay ordinances inconsistent with law or
city or municipal ordinances, the sanggunian
concerned shall, within thirty (30) days from
receipt thereof, return the same with its comm ents
and
recomm endations to
the
sangguniang
barangay concerned for adjustment, amendment,

barangay ordinance is suspended until such time
as the revision called for is effected.

(c) The gist of all ordinances with penal
sanctions shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation within the province where the
local legislative body concerned belongs. In the
absence of any newspaper of general circulation
within the province, posting of such ordinances
shall be made in all municipalities and cities of
the province where the sanggunian of origin is
situated.

SEC. 58. Enforcement of Disapproved Ordinances
or Resolutions.
Any attempt to enforce any
ordinance or any resolution approving the local
development plan and public investment program,
after the disapproval thereof, shall be sufficient
ground for the suspension or dismissal of the

independent component cities, the main features of
the ordinance or resolution duly enacted or adopted
shall, in addition to being posted, be published once
in a local newspaper of general circulation within
the city: Provided, That in the absence thereof the
ordinance or resolution shall be published in any
newspaper of general circulation.
A.

Comm ents

1.
It is first contended, by petitioner-appellant that the
budget ordinance after its veto by the City Mayor and subsequent
amendment by the Municipal Board of Manila, should have been
published again before its discussion in the executive session of
February 26 and 28, 1958. We note from a reading of Section 17,
R.A. No. 409, which provides for the legislative procedure to be

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

230

followed by the Municipal Board of Manila, that there really is a
requirement to publish each and every proposed ordinance, one
before it is enacted by the Municipal Board, and again after its
approval by the Mayor. But nowhere in the section is it provided that
pre-discussion publication must take place after every amendment
or modification on the proposed ordinance during the process
of its enactment. Indeed, it is not the intendment of the law that
everytime an amendment is introduced the proposed ordinance has
to be published again, for this would incur tremendous expense and
unnecessary delays in the passage of municipal legislation. (Subido

v. City of Manila, 108 Phil. 462.)
B.

Decided Case

1.
Where the publication of a proposed ordinance is made a
condition precedent for its adoption, the statute is mandatory and
the publication goes to the jurisdiction of the municipal council or
board. Ordinances adopted without such publication are therefore
null and void.

RODRIGUEZ v. CITY OF MANILA
46 Phil. 171, September 13, 1924, Ostrand, J.
Facts: An ordinance appropriating funds for the necessary
expenses of the government of the City of Manila during the
fiscal year ending December 1924, was published in the Official
Gazette in excerpt form only. The validity of the ordinance was
attacked on the ground that it was not published prior to its
adoption in two daily newspaper of general circulation in the
City of Manila as provided for in Sec. 2443 of Administrative
Code, and that the ordinance was not published in full before
its adoption and implementation, as required by Sec. 2443, but
that only extracts thereof were inserted in the Official Gazette.
Trial Court held the ordinance null and void.
Held: The Charter of the City of Manila provides that
proposed ordinances shall be published in two daily newspaper
of general circulation in the city. A later enactment, Act
No. 2930, however, provided that all public acts, notices or
advertisements, not of a judicial character, of the several
branches of the government service should be published in the
Official Gazette. Act No. 2930 repealed the provision of the
Charter of the City of Manila in regard to the publication of

Book I General Provisions
Title Two Elective Officials

231

ordinances and that publication in the O.G. is now sufficient
compliance with the law, but that an appropriation ordinance
should be published in full prior to its passage and that the
publication of excerpts only of the ordinance is not sufficient
and renders the ordinance null and void. When the publication
of a proposed ordinance is made a condition precedent for its
adoption, the statute is mandatory and the publication goes
to the jurisdiction of the municipal council or board. The
ordinance in question is null and void.
Provisions for the publication of ordinance after their
passage, though mandatory in form, are generally held
directory where the statute does not impliedly prescribe that
the ordinance shall not go into effect until the publication is
made. Where the publication of a proposed ordinance is made a
condition precedent for its adoption, that statute is mandatory
and the publication goes to the jurisdiction of the municipal
board.

Held: The pertinent portion of Section 60 of the Local
Government Code of 1991 provides:

An elective local official may be removed from
office on the grounds enumerated above by order of
the proper court.

"Section 60. Grounds for Disciplinary Actions. An
elective local official may be disciplined, suspended, or
removed from office on any of the following grounds:

Decided Cases

l.
The power to remove erring elective local officials from
service is lodged exclusively with the courts. Hence, Article 124b),
Rule XIX, of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local
Government Code, insofar as it vests power on the "disciplining
authority" to remove from office erring elective local officials, is void
for being repugnant to the last paragraph of Section 60 of the Local
Government Code of 1991. The Sangguniang Panlalawigan and the
office of the President have no power to dismiss Mayor Villapando.
PABLICO v. VILLAPANDO
385 SCRA 601, July 31, 2002, Ynares-Santiago, J.
Facts: On August 5, 1999, Solomon B. Maagad, and
Renato M. Fernandez, both members of the Sangguniang
Bayan of San Vicente, Palawan, fled with the Sangguniang
Panlalawigan of Palawan an administrative complaint against
respondent Alejandro A. Villapando, then Mayor of San
Vicente, Palawan, for abuse of authority and culpable violation
of the Constitution.
Complainants alleged that respondent, on behalf of the
municipality, entered into a consultancy agreement with
Orlando M. Tiape, a defeated mayoralty candidate in the May
1998 elections. They argue that the consultancy agreement
amounted to an appointment to a government position within
the prohibited one-year period under Article IX-B, Section 6, of
the 1987 Constitution.
On February 1, 2000, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of
Palawan found respondent guilty of the Administrative Charge
and imposed on him the penalty of dismissal from service.

XXX

XXX

XXX

An elective local official may be removed from office on the
grounds enumerated above by order of the proper court."
It is clear from the last paragraph of the aforecited
provision that the penalty of dismissal from service upon an
erring elective local official may be decreed only by a court of
law. Thus, in Salalima v. Guingona, 257 SCRA 55, we held that
"[t]he Office of the President is without any power to remove
elected officials, since such power is exclusively vested in the
proper courts as expressly provided for in the last paragraph of
the aforequoted Section 60."
Verily, the clear legislative intent to make the subject
power of removal a judicial prerogative is patent from the
deliberations in the Senate.
It is beyond cavil, therefore, that the power to remove
erring elective local officials from service is lodged exclusively
with the courts. Hence, Article 124(b), Rule XIX, of the Rules
and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code,
insofar as it vests power on the "disciplining authority" to
remove from office erring elective local officials, is void for
being repugnant to the last paragraph of Section 60 of the
Local Government Code of 1991. The law on suspension or
removal of elective public officials must be strictly construed
and applied. Where the disciplining authority is given only the
power to suspend and not the power to remove, it should not
be permitted to manipulate the law by usurping the power to
remove.
Petition is DENIED.

The Office of the Ombudsman has concurrent jurisdiction
with the Quezon City Council over administrative cases against
elective officials such as petitioner. The Ombudsman's Order
dismissing petitioner is valid.

LAXINA, SR. v. OMBUDSMAN
471 SCRA 542, September 30, 2005, Tinga, J.
Facts: On 13 March 2000, Evangeline Ursal brought
before the DILG a complaint-affidavit charging petitioner
Manuel Laxina, Sr. with grave misconduct for an alleged
attempted rape. Laxina, Sr was the Barangay Chairman of
Batasan Hills, Quezon City. However, the DILG referred the
complaint to the Quezon City Council for appropriate action.
Said complaint was docketed as Adm. Case No. 00-13.
Thereafter, on 30 March 2000, Ursal filed with the Office
of the Ombudsman a similar complaint-affidavit charging
petitioner with grave misconduct, docketed as 0MB ADM
Case No. 0-00-0350. Petitioner filed his counter-affidavit and
attached thereto the affidavits of two witnesses. Upon review,
and with the approval of the Ombudsman, petitioner was found
guilty of grave misconduct and meted the penalty of dismissal,
with forfeiture of material benefits, per its Memorandum
Order.

Ruling: Petitioner claims that the Ombudsman has no
jurisdiction over the case since the City Council had earlier
acquired jurisdiction over the matter. The Court is not
convinced.
The mandate of the Ombudsman to investigate
complaints against erring public officials, derived from both
the Constitution and the law gives it jurisdiction over the
complaint against petitioner. To fulfil this mandate, R.A. No.
6770, or the Ombudsman Act of 1989, was enacted, giving
the Ombudsman or his Deputies jurisdiction over complaints
on all kinds of malfeasance, misfeasance and non-feasance
against officers or employees of the government, x x x. On the
other hand, under R.A. No. 7160 or the Local Government
Code, the sangguniang panlungsod or sangguniang bayan
has disciplinary authority over any elective barangay official.
Without a doubt, the Office of the Ombudsman has concurrent
jurisdiction with the Quezon City Council over administrative
cases against elective officials such as petitioner.

Book I G eneral Provisions
'Title Two Elective Officials

235

The Ombudsman was not aware of the pending case before
the Quezon City Council when the administrative complaint
was filed before it. There was no mention of such complaint
either in the complaint-affidavit or in the counter-affidavit of
petitioner. Thus, the Ombudsman, in compliance with its duty
to act on all complaints against officers and employees of the
government, took cognizance of the case, made its investigation,
and rendered its decision accordingly.
Petitioner is estopped from questioning the jurisdiction
of the Ombudsman. A perusal of the records shows that
he participated in the proceedings by filing his counteraffidavit with supporting evidence. Neither did he inform
the Ombudsman of the existence of the other administrative
complaint of which he is presumably aware at the time the
proceedings in the Ombudsman were on-going. It was only
when the Ombudsman rendered an adverse decision that
he disclosed the proceedings before the Quezon City Council
and raised the issue of jurisdiction. Thus, it has been held
that participation in the administrative proceedings without
raising any objection thereto bars the parties from raising any
jurisdictional infirmity after an adverse decision is rendered
against them.
The petition is DENIED.
3.
The Sangguniang Panlungsod or Sangguniang Bayan
cannot order the removal of an erring elective barangay official from
office, as the courts are exclusively vested with this power under
Section 60 of the Local Government Code.

Facts: Petitioner Sangguniang Barangay is the legislative
body of Barangay Don Mariano Marcos, Bayombong, Nueva
Vizcaya. Respondent Severino Martinez is its incumbent
Punong Barangay.
On 5 November 2004, Martinez was administratively
charged with Dishonesty and Graft and Corruption by
petitioner through the filing of a verified complaint before the
Sangguniang Bayan as the disciplining authority over elective

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

barangay officials pursuant to Section 61 of Rep. Act No. 7160,
LGC. Petitioner filed with the Sangguniang Bayan an Amended
Administrative Complaint against Martinez on 6 December
2004 for Dishonesty, Misconduct in Office and Violation of the
Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act Petitioner alleged that
Martinez failed to submit and fully remit to the Barangay
Treasurer the income of their solid waste management project
since 2001 particularly the sale of fertilizer derived from
composting. He also failed to submit/remit to the barangay
treasurer the sale of recyclable materials taken from garbage
collection.
On 28 July 2005, the Sangguniang Bayan rendered its
Decision which imposed upon Martinez the penalty of removal
from office. The Decision was conveyed to the Municipal Mayor
of Bayombong, Nueva Ecija [Vizcaya - Ed.], Severino Bagasao,
for its implementation.
Ruling: Section 60 of the Local Government Code
conferred upon the courts the power to remove elective local
officials from office.
During the deliberations of the Senate on the Local
Government Code, the legislative intent to confine to the
courts, i.e., regional trial courts, the Sandiganbayan and the
appellate courts, jurisdiction over cases involving the removal
of elective local officials was evident.
In Salalima v. Guingona, Jr., 326 Phil. 847 (1996)
the Court en bane categorically ruled that the Office of the
President is without any power to remove elected officials,
since the power is exclusively vested in the proper courts as
expressly provided for in the last paragraph of Section 60 of the
Local Government Code.
Congress clearly meant that the removal of an elective
local official be done only after a trial before the appropriate
court, where court rules of procedure and evidence can
ensure impartiality and fairness and protect against political
maneuverings. Elevating the removal of an elective local official
from office from an administrative case to a court case may be
justified by the fact that such removal not only punishes the
official concerned but also, in effect, deprives the electorate of
the services of the official for whom they voted.

Book I- General Provisions
Title Two Elective Officials

237

As the law stands, Section 61 of the Local Government Code
provides for the procedure for the filing of an administrative
case against an erring elective barangay official before the
Sangguniang Panlungsod or Sangguniang Bayan. However,
the Sangguniang Panlungsod or Sangguniang Bayan cannot
order the removal of an erring elective barangay official from
office, as the courts are exclusively vested with this power
under Section 60, LGC. Thus, if the acts allegedly committed
by the barangay official are of a grave nature and, if found
guilty, would merit the penalty of removal from office, the case
should be filed with the regional trial court. Once the court
assumes jurisdiction, it retains jurisdiction over the case even
if it would be subsequently apparent during the trial that a
penalty less than removal from office is appropriate. On the
other hand, the most extreme penalty that the Sangguniang
Panlungsod or Sangguniang Bayan may impose on the errin g
elective barangay official is suspension; if it deems that the
removal of the official from service is warranted, then it can
resolve that the proper charges be filed in court.
The instant Petition is DENIED and the assailed Decision
of the Bayombong RTC is AFFIRMED.

SEC. 61. Form and Filing of Administrative
Complaints.
A verified complaint against any
erring local elective official shall be prepared as
follows:
(a) A complaint against any elective official of
a province, a highly urbanized city, an independent
component city or component city shall be filed
before the Office of the President;
(b) A complaint against any elective official of
a municipality shall be filed before the sangguniang
panlalawigan whose decision may be appealed to
the Office of the President; and
(c) A complaint against any elective barangay
official shall be filed before the sangguniang
panlungsod or sangguniang bayan concerned
whose decision shall be final and executory.

A.

Comments

1.
The power of investigating and deciding an Administrative
Case filed against a municipal official is not executive in nature. It is
lodged in the Provincial Board as a body, the performance of which
cannot be frustrated by the absence, fortuitous or deliberate, of the
Provincial Governor. (Castillo v. Villarama, 15 SCRA 42.)

B.

Decided Cases

1. Since the complaint was filed first in the Ombudsman, and
the Ombudsman opted to assume jurisdiction over the complaint,
the Ombudsman's exercise of jurisdiction is to the exclusion of the
sangguniang bayan exercising concurrent jurisdiction.

stage, from any investigatory agency of Government, the
investigations of such cases.
The primary jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to investigate
any act or omission of a public officer or employee applies only
in cases cognizable by the Sandiganbayan. In cases cognizable
by regular courts, the Ombudsman has concurrent jurisdiction
with other investigative agencies of government. Republic Act
No. 8249, otherwise known as An Act Further Defining the
Jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, limits the cases that are
cognizable by the Sandiganbayan to public officials occupying
positions corresponding to salary grade 27 and higher. The
Sandiganbayan has no jurisdiction over private respondent
who, aspunong barangay,is occupying a position corresponding
to salary grade 14 under Republic Act No. 6758, otherwise
known as the Compensation and Position Classification Act of
1989.

Facts: On 26 August 2003, the Ombudsman in Visayas
received a complaint for abuse of authority, dishonesty,
oppression, misconduct in office, and neglect of duty against
Rolson Rodriguez, punong barangay in Brgy. Sto. Rosario,
Binalbagan, Negros Occidental. On 1 September 2003, the
sangguniang bayan of Binalbagan, Negros Occidental, through
vice-mayor Jose G. Yulo, received a similar complaint against
Rodriguez for abuse of authority, dishonesty, oppression,
misconduct in office, and neglect of duty.

Under Section 61, Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise
known as the Local Government Code, the sangguniang
panlungsod or sangguniang bayan has disciplinary authority
over any elective barangay official.

The Ombudsman found Rodriguez guilty of dishonesty
and oppression and dismissed him.

Sec. 15. Powers, Functions, and Duties. - The
Ombudsman shall have the following powers, functions,
and duties:

In administrative cases involving the concurrent
jurisdiction of two or more disciplining authorities, the body
in which the complaint is filed first, and which opts to take
cognizance of the case, acquires jurisdiction to the exclusion of
other tribunals exercising concurrent jurisdiction. In this case,
since the complaint was filed first in the Ombudsman, and the
Ombudsman opted to assume jurisdiction over the complaint,
the Ombudsman's exercise of jurisdiction is to the exclusion of
the sangguniang bayan exercising concurrent jurisdiction.

(1) Investigate and prosecute on its own or on
complaint by any person, any act or omission of any
public officer or employee, office or agency, when such
act or omission appears to be illegal, unjust, improper,
or inefficient. It has primary jurisdiction over cases
cognizable by the Sandiganbayan and, in the exercise
of this primary jurisdiction, it may take over, at any

It is a hornbook rule that jurisdiction is a matter of law.
Jurisdiction, once acquired, is not lost upon the instance of the
parties but continues until the case is terminated. When herein
complainants first filed the complaint in the Ombudsman,
jurisdiction was already vested on the latter. Jurisdiction could
no longer be transferred to the sangguniang bayan by virtue of
a subsequent complaint filed by the same complainants.

Ruling: Section 15 of Republic Act No. 6770, otherwise
known as the Ombudsman Act of 1989, states:

Clearly, the Ombudsman has concurrent jurisdiction
with the sangguniang bayan over administrative cases against
elective barangay officials occupying positions below salary
grade 27, such as private respondent in this case.

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

As a final note, under Section 60 of the Local Government
Code, the sangguniang bayan has no power to remove an
elective barangay official. Apart from the Ombudsman, only
a proper court may do so. Unlike the sangguniang bayan, the
powers of the Ombudsman are not merely recommendatory.
The Ombudsman is clothed with authority to directly remove
an erring public official other than members of Congress and
the Judiciary who may be removed only by impeachment.
We GRANT the petition. We SET ASIDE the Decision
of the Court of Appeals. We AFFIRM the Decision of the
Ombudsman (Visayas).
2.
Sections 61 and 62 of the LGC, as the well as the IRRs,
provide that the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Camarines Sur
has jurisdiction over complaints fled against any erring municipal
official within is jurisdiction. The rules of procedure in investigating
municipal officials not being a tax measure nor providing penal
sanctions, need not be published.

VILLAFUERTE v. CORDIAL, JR.
G.R. No. 222450, July 7, 2020, Reyes, J. Jr., J.
Facts: On July 18, 2014, respondents, Mayor Constancio
Cordial,Jr. and Vice Mayor Irene BreisofCaramoan, Ca marines
Sur, were administratively charged with Grave Misconduct.
Dishonesty, and Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of
Service docketed as Administrative Case No. 003-2014 by Chief
of Task Force Sagip Kalkasan Fermin M. Mabulo (Mabulo),
Municipal Councilors Eduardo B. Bonita and Lydia Obias, and
former Municipal Councilor Romeo Marto. The complaint was
lodged before the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Camarines
Sur, through its Special Committee on Administrative Cases
(Special Committee) headed by Atty. Amador Simando.
In said Complaint, it was alleged that the respondents,
through the Sangguniang Bayan of Caramoan, Camarines
Sur, passed Resolution No 48 which requested for the removal
of Task Force Sagip Kalikasan in the entire Municipality of
Caramoan, Camarines Sur without the conduct of deliberation.
Prior to said incident, the Task Force Sagip Kalikasan
conducted an inspection in Barangay Gata, Caramoan,
Camarines Sur because of reported mining activities. Upon
inspection, the team found 30 people engaged in illegal mining

Title Two - Elective Officials

241

activities, holes where minerals were being extracted, and
machinery and equipment for mining and extraction. The
Chief of the Task Force, Mabulo, asked those involved if they
had the necessary permits; and as they failed to show him any,
he asked them to cease from operating.
In response to the Complaint, respondents filed a Motion
to Dismiss, assailing the jurisdiction of the Special Committee,
as well as its Rules of Procedure on the Investigation of
Administrative and Disciplinary Cases against Elected
Municipal Officials as embodied in Resolution No 13, Series of
2013 (Resolution No. 13-2013) for lack of publication.
The Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Camarines Sur
issued a Resolution dated December 16, 2014, recommending
that respondents be placed under preventive suspension for a
period of 60 days.
In a Decision dated January 13, 2015, the RTC construed
that the lack of publication of the Rules of Procedure embodied
in Resolution Nol 13-2013 stripped off the Sangguniang
Panlalawigan of Ca marines Sur ofjurisdiction over the conduct
of the administrative hearing against respondents.

Ruling: Municipal ordinances are not covered by the
Civil Code, but by the LGC.
The nature of municipal ordinances or resolutions which
require publication is embodied in Sections 59, 188 and 511 of
the LGC.
SEC. 59. Is on Effectivity of Ordinances or Resolutions.
SEC. 188 is on Publication of Tax ordinances and Revenue
measures. SEC. 511. ls on Posting and Publication of
Ordinances with Penal Sanctions.
In the instance case, what was being assailed is
Resolution No. 13-2013, which provides for the rules of
procedure concerning the conduct of investigation against
municipal officials in said province issued by the Sangguniang
Panlalawigan of Ca marines Sur. Clearly, it is neither penal in
nature as it does not provide for any sanction or punishment nor
a tax measure. It is merely interpretative of Title II, Chapter 4
of the LGC, which outlines the procedure when a disciplinary
action in instituted against an elective local official. Based on
the foregoing, Resolution No. 13-2013 need not be published.

242

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

The RTC erroneously concluded that the element of
publication is an essential element of the Sangguniang
Panlalawigan of Camarines Sur's jurisdiction over the
proceedings of the case. Jurisdiction over the subject matter,
on the other hand, is conferred by law and is determined by the
allegations in the complaint.
Sections 61 and 62 of the LGC, as well as Sections 125 and
126ofits Implementing Rules and Regulations or Administrative
Order No. 270, provide that the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of
Camarines Sur has jurisdiction over complaints filed against
any erring municipal official within is jurisidiction. Upon
the fling of said complaint, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan
shall require the filing of the respondent's verified answer.
Investigation shall ensue accordingly.
In this case, the allegations in the Complaint filed by
Mabulo, et al. against the respondents, as local municipal
officials of Caramoan, Camarines Sur, vested the Sangguniang
Panlalawigan of Camarines Sur of jurisdiction over the case.
The instant petition is hereby GRANTED. Accordingly,
the Decision and the Order of the RTC of San Jose Camarines
Sur, Branch 30 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.
SEC. 62. Notice of Hearing.
(a) Within seven
(7) days after the administrative complaint is
filed, the Office of the President or the sanggunian
concerned, as the case may be, shall require the
respondent to submit his verified answer within
fifteen (15) days from receipt thereof, and commence
the investigation of the case within ten (10) days
after receipt of such answer of the respondent.
(b) When the respondent is an elective
official of a province or highly urbanized city, such
hearing and investigation shall be conducted in the
place where he renders or holds office. For nil other
local elective officials, the venue shall be the place
where the sanggunian concerned is located.
(c) However, no investigation shall be held
within ninety (90) days imm ediately prior to any
local election, and no preventive suspension shall
be imposed within the said period. If preventive

Book I General Provisions
Title Two Elective Officials

suspension has been imposed prior to the 90-day
period imm ediately preceding local election, it
shall be deemed automatically lifted upon the start
of aforesaid period.
SEC. 63. Preventive Suspension.- (a) Preventive
suspension may be imposed.
(1) By the President, if the respondent
is an elective official of a province, a highly
urbanized or an independent component city;
(2) By the governor, if the respondent
is an elective official of a component city or
municipal; or
(3) By the mayor, if the respondent is an
elective official of the barangay.
(b) Preventive suspension may be imposed
at any time after the issues are joined, when the
evidence of guilt is strong, and given the gravity
of the offense, there is great probability that the
continuance in office of the respondent could
influence the witnesses or pose a threat to the safety
and integrity of the records and other evidence:
Provided, That any single preventive suspension
of local elective officials shall not extend beyond
sixty (60) days: Provided, further, That in the event
that several administrative cases are filed against
an elective official, he cannot be preventively
suspended for more than ninety (90) days within a
single year on the same ground or grounds existing
and known at the time of the first suspension.
(c) Upon expiration of the preventive
suspension, the suspended elective officials shall
be deemed reinstated in office without prejudice
to the continuation of the proceedings against him,
which shall be terminated within one hundred
twenty (120) days from the time he was formally
notified of the case against him. However, if the
delay in the proceedings of the case is due to his
fault, neglect or request, other than the appeal
duly filed, the duration of such delay shall not be

243

counted in computing the time of termination of
the case.
(d) Any abuse of the exercise of the power of
preventive suspension shall be penalized as abuse
of authority.
A.

Decided Case

1.
Section 63 of the Local Government Code does not govern
preventive suspensions imposed by the Ombudsman, which is a
constitutionally created office and independent from the Executive
branch of government. The Ombudsman's power of preventive
suspension is governed by R.A. No. 6770, otherwise known as "The
Ombudsman Act of 1989."
MIRANDA v. SANDIGANBAYAN
464 SCRA 165, July 27, 2005, Puno, J.

Facts: The Ombudsman placed petitioner Jose C.
Miranda (Mayor Miranda) then the mayor of Santiago City,
Isabela, under preventive suspension for six months from 25
July 1997 to 25 January 1998 for alleged violations of Republic
Act No. 6713, otherwise known as the Code of Conduct and
Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees.
Subsequently, then Vice Mayor Amelita S. Navarro
(Vice Mayor Navarro) filed a Complaint with the Office of the
Ombudsman (Ombudsman) on 1 December 1997 which was
docketed as OMB-1-97-2312. In the said Complaint, Vice Mayor
Navarro alleged that Mayor Miranda committed the following
acts on 24 November 1997 despite the continuing effectivity
of the Ombudsman's preventive suspension order: (a) issued
a memorandum addressed to Navarro advising her that he
was assuming his position as City Mayor; (b) gave directives
to the heads of offices and other employees; x x x Vice Mayor
Navarro contended that Mayor Miranda committed the felony
of usurpation of authority or official functions under Article
177 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).
On 28 October 1998, the Ombudsman filed with the
Sandiganbayan an Information against Mayor Miranda for
violation of Article 177 of the RPC, penalizing usurpation of
authority. On 28 November 2001, the prosecution filed before
the Sandiganbayan a motion to suspend Mayor Miranda

Book I - General Provisions
Title 'Two Elective Officials

245

pendente lite based on Section 13 of Republic Act No. 3019,
otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
In a Resolution dated 4 February 2002, the Sandiganbayan
preventively suspended Mayor Miranda from office for 90 days.

Ruling: The Sandiganbayan properly construed Section
13 of R.A. No. 3019 as covering two types of offenses: (1)
any offense involving fraud on the government; and (2) any
offense involving public funds or property. Contrary to the
submission of the petitioner, nothing in R.A. No. 3019 evinces
any legislative intent to limit Section 13 only to acts involving
fraud on public funds or property. The phrase "any offense
involving fraud upon government or public funds or property"
is clear and categorical. To limit the use of "government" as an
adjective that qualifies "funds" is baseless. The word "public"
precedes "funds" and distinguishes the same from private
funds. To qualify further "public funds" as "government" funds,
as petitioner claims is the law's intent, is plainly superfluous.
We are bound by the rule that a statute should be construed
reasonably with reference to its controlling purpose and its
provisions should not be given a meaning that is inconsistent
with its scope and object. R.A. No. 3019, commonly known as
the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, should be read to
protect the State from fraud by its own officials.
We further hold that the Sandiganbayan did not gravely
abuse its discretion when it ruled that petitioner's act fell
within the catch-all provision "xx x or for any offense involving
fraud upon government. The term "fraud" is defined, viz.:
An instance or an act of trickery or deceit esp. when
involving misrepresentation: an act of deluding.
Accused's acts therefore in assuming the duties and
function of the Office of the Mayor despite his suspension
from said office resulted to a clear disruption of office and
worst, a chaotic situation in the affairs of the government as
the employees, as well as the public, suffered confusion as to
who is the head of the Office. This actuation of herein accused
constitutes fraud which in general sense is deemed to comprise
anything calculated to deceive, including all acts, omissions,
and concealment involving a breach of legal or equitable duty,
trust or confidence justly reposed, resulting in damage to
another or by which an undue and unconscious advantage is

246

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

taken of another (37 Am. Jur. 2d 19 at Sec. 19). Hence, the
act complained of against accused herein falls in the catch
all provision "x x x or for any offense involving fraud upon
government xxx."
The dissenting opinion contends that the Ombudsman's
authority to preventively suspend local elective officials for 6
months is limited by Section 63(b) of the Local Government
Code. Under the latter law, petitioner can only be suspended for
a maximum period of 60 days. It then jumps to the conclusion
that petitioner could not have usurped authority because he
reassumed office after 60 days.
In Hagad v. Gozo-Dadole, 251 SCRA 242 (1995) and
Garcia v. Mojica, 314 SCRA 207 (1999) in Hagad, we held:
Respondent local officials contend that the 6-month
preventive suspension without pay under Section 24 of
the Ombudsman Act is much too repugnant to the 60-day
preventive suspension provided by Section 63 of the Local
Government Code to even now maintain its application.
The two provisions govern differently.
There is no reason to reverse this ruling. Our above ruling
is in accord with the intent of the law. It bears emphasis that
Senator Pimentel explained during the Senate deliberations
that the purpose of Section 63 of the Code is to prevent the
abuse of the power of preventive suspension by members
of the executive branch.
Section 63 of the Local Government Code does not govern
preventive suspensions imposed by the Ombudsman, which
is a constitutionally created office and independent from the
Executive branch of government. The Ombudsman's power of
preventive suspension is governed by Republic Act No. 6770,
otherwise known as "The Ombudsman Act of 1989,"
The instant petition is DISMISSED there being no
showing that the Sandiganbayan gravely abused its discretion
in issuing its Resolution of 4 February 2002, preventively
suspending the petitioner for 90 days.
2. The Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act implicitly
recognizes that the power of preventive suspension lies in the court
in which the criminal charge is filed. The provision of suspension

Boo k I G eneral Provisions
Title Two Elective Officials

247

pendente lite applies to all persons indicted upon a valid information
under the Act, whether they be appointive or elective officials. It
applies to a Municipal Mayor, a Governor, a Congressman. It is
mandatory for the court to place under preventive suspension a
public officer accused before it. However, the preventive suspension
may not be of indefinite period. The Court has thus laid down the
rule that preventive suspension may not exceed the maximum
period of ninety (90) days in consonance with [PD] No. 807, now
Section 52 of the Administrative Code of 1987.

NICART, JR. v. SANDIGANBAYAN
495 SCRA 73, July 14, 2006, Garcia, J.
Facts: An information was filed with the Sandiganbayan
against both petitioner Conrado Nicart, Jr., Mayor of San
Policarpio, Eastern Samar and Luz Ty, the Municipal Treasurer
for malversation of public funds amounting to P4,106,489.15.
Ruling: Given the separate resolutions adverted to dated
April 2 and June 20, 2001, the propriety of the preventive
suspension of petitioner effected through the assailed
Resolution of February 15, 2001 has become a moot issue, it
appearing that he has already served his suspension.
This is not say, however, that the assailed suspension
resolution of the Sandiganbayan, insofar as it imposed a 90day preventive suspension instead of the maximum 60 days
prescribed by Section 63 of the Local Government Code of 1991
(R.A. No. 7160), is flawed. Far from it. As may be noted, the
anti-graft court ordered the petitioner's suspension on the basis
of Section 13 of R.A. No. 3019, malversation of public funds
being an offense involving fraud against government funds and
is clearly included among the crimes contemplated under said
section. Be that as it may and given the presumptive validity
of the information in question, petitioner's urging for the Court
to strike down the suspension order cannot be granted. As the
Court articulated in Segovia v. Sandiganbayan, 288 SCRA
328 (1998) citing what then Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa
referred to therein as the "mass ofjurisprudence":
The Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act implicitly
recognizes that the power of preventive suspension lies
in the court in which the criminal charge is filed. The
provision of suspension pendente lite applies to all persons

concerned shall render a decision in writing
stating clearly and distinctly the facts and the
reasons for such decision. Copies of said decision
shall imm ediately be furnished the respondent and
all interested parties.

It is mandatory for the court to place under
preventive suspension a public officer accused before it.
XXX

(b) The penalty of suspension shall not exceed
the unexpired term of the respondent or a period of
six (6) months for every administrative offense, nor
shall said penalty be a bar to the candidacy of the
respondent so suspended as long as he meets the
qualifications required for the office.

However, the preventive suspension may not be
of indefinite period .... The Court has thus laid down
the rule that preventive suspension may not exceed the
maximum period of ninety (90) days in consonance with
[PD] No. 807, ... now Section 52 of the Administrative
Code of 1987."
In all, the petitioner has failed to demonstrate that grave
abuse of discretion tainted the issuance of the assailed order
and resolutions. We are thus denying the instant recourse to
clear the path for the Sandiganbayan to write finis, one way or
the other, to its Criminal Case No. 2467 4.
The petition is DISMISSED.

although the payments were made after the official's election,
reasoning that the payments were merely effected pursuant to
contracts executed before said re-election.

Facts: On July 22, 2014, a complaint/affidavit was filed
by Atty. Renato L. Bonda! and Nicolas "Ching" Enciso VI
before the Office of the Ombudsman against Jejomar Erwin
Binay, Jr. and other public officers and employees of the City
Government of Makati accusing them of Plunder and violation
of Republic Act No. (RA) 3019, as "The Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act," in connection with the five (5) phases of the
procurement and construction of the Makati City Hall Parking
Building (Makati Parking Building).

The condonation doctrine-which connotes this same
sense of complete extinguishment of liability as will be
herein elaborated upon-is not based on statutory law. It is
a jurisprudential creation that originated from the 1959 case
of Pascual v. Hon. Provincial Board of Nueva Ecija, 106
Phil. 466 (1959) (Pascual), which was therefore decided under
the 1935 Constitution

Ruling: The Court now examines the objections of the
Ombudsman against the CA's authority to issue the assailed
Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and Writ of Preliminary
Injunction (WPI against the implementation of the preventive
suspension order or Mayor Binay, Jr. incidental to that main
case.
The CA's March 16, 2015 Resolution which directed the
issuance of the assailed TRO was based on the case of Governor
Garcia, Jr. v. CA, 604 Phil. 677 (2009) (Governor Garcia, Jr.),
wherein the Court emphasized that "if it were established in
the CA that the acts subject of the administrative complaint
were indeed committed during petitioner [Garcia's] prior term,
then, following settled jurisprudence, he can no longer be
administratively charged."
Similarly, the CA's April 6, 2015 Resolution which
directed the issuance of the assailed WPI was based on the
condonation doctrine, citing the case of Aguinaldo v. Santos,
212 SCRA 768 (1992).
The CA observed that although there were acts which
were apparently committed by Binay, Jr. beyond his first
term, i.e., the alleged payments on July 3, 4, and 24, 2013,
corresponding to the services of Hillmarc's and MAN A-still,
Binay, Jr. cannot be held administratively liable therefor
based on the cases of Salalima v. Guingona, Jr., 257 SCRA
55 (1996) and Mayor Garcia v. Mojica, 314 SCRA 207 (1999)
wherein the condonation doctrine was applied by the Court

As there was no legal precedent on the issue at
that time, the Court, in Pascual, resorted to American
authorities and "found that cases on the matter are
conflicting due in part, probably, to differences in statutes and
constitutional provisions, and also, in part, to a divergence of
views with respect to the question of whether the subsequent
election or appointment condones the prior misconduct."
Without going into the variables of these conflicting
views and cases, it proceeded to state that:
The weight of authorities x x x seems to incline
toward the rule denying the right to remove one
from office because of misconduct during a prior
term, to which we fully subscribe.
The conclusion is at once problematic since this Court
has now uncovered that there is really no established weight
of authority in the United States (US) favoring the doctrine of
condonation, which, in the words of Pascual, theorizes that an
official's re-election denies the right to remove him from office
due to a misconduct during a prior term. In fact, as pointed out
during the oral arguments of this case, at least seventeen (17)
states in the US have abandoned the condonation doctrine.
The Ombudsman aptly cites several rulings of various US
State courts, as well as literature published on the matter, to
demonstrate the fact that the doctrine is not uniformly applied
across all state jurisdictions.
In this case, the Court agrees with the Ombudsman that
since the time Pascual was decided, the legal landscape has
radically shifted. Again, Pascual was a 1959 case decided
under the 1935 Constitution, which dated provisions do not

252

Title Two Elective Officials

reflect the experience of the Filipino People under the 1973 and
1987 Constitutions. Therefore, the plain difference in setting,
including, of course, the sheer impact of the condonation
doctrine on public accountability, calls for Pascual's judicious
re-examination.

affirmed in the cases following the same, such as Aguinaldo,
Salalima, Mayor Garcia, and Governor Garcia, Jr. which were
all relied upon by the CA.
It should, however, be clarified that this Court's
abandonment of the condonation doctrine should be prospective
in application for the reason that juclicial decisions applying or
interpreting the laws or the Constitution, until reversed, shall
form part of the legal system of the Philippines.

With the advent of the 1973 Constitution, the approach
in dealing with public officers underwent a significant change.
The new charter introduced an entire article on accountability
of public officers, found in Article XIII. Section l thereof
positively recognized, acknowledged, and declared that "[plublic
office is a pub lic trust," Accordingly, "[p]ublic officers
and employees shall serve with the highest degree of
responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, and
shall remain accountable to the people."

WHEREFORE, the petition is PARTLY GRANTED.

(a) The sangguniang panlalawigan, in the

After the turbulent decades of Martial Law rule, the
Filipino People have framed and adopted the 1987 Constitution,
which sets forth in the Declaration of Principles and State
Policies in Article II that "[t]he State shall maintain honesty
and integrity in the public service and take positive
and effective measures against graft and corruption."
Learning how unbridled power could corrupt public servants
under the regime of a dictator, the Framers put primacy on the
integrity of the public service by declaring it as a constitutional
principle and a State policy. More significantly, the 1987
Constitution strengthened and solidified what has been first
proclaimed in the 1973 Constitution by commanding public
officers to be accountable to the people at all times:

(b) The Office of the President, in the case of
decisions of the sangguniang panlalawigan and the
sangguniang panlungsod of highly urbanized cities
and independent component cities.
Decisions of the Office of the President shall
be final and executory.
SEC. 68. Execution Pending Appeal. An
appeal shall not prevent a decision from becoming
final or executory. The respondent shall be
considered as having been placed under preventive
suspension during the pendency of an appeal in the
event he wins such appeal. In the event the appeal
results in an exoneration, he shall be paid his salary
and such other emoluments during the pendency of
the appeal.

Section l. Public office is a public trust. Public officers
and employees must at all times be accountable to
the people, serve them with utmost responsibility,
integrity, loyalty, and efficiency and act with
patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.
That being said, this Court simply finds no legal authority
to sustain the condonation doctrine in this juriscliction. As can
be seen from this discourse, it was a doctrine adopted from
one class of US rulings way back in 1959 and thus, out of
touch from-and now rendered obsolete by-the current legal
regime. In consequence, it is high time for this Court to abandon
the condonation doctrine that originated from Pascual, and

are final, executory and unappealable. In this case, Lapid may
appeal because the ombudsman's decision imposed upon him the
penalty of one year suspension without pay.
LAP IDv. CA
334 SCRA 741, June 29, 2000, Gonzaga-Reyes, J.
Facts: On the basis of an unsigned letter dated July 20,
1998, allegedly originating from the "Mga Mamamayan ng
Lalawigan ng Pampanga," addressed to the NBI, the latter
initiated an "open probe" on the alleged illegal quarrying
in Pampanga and exaction of exorbitant fees purportedly
perpetrated by unscrupulous individuals with the connivance
of high-ranking government officials. The NB! Report was
endorsed to the respondent Ombudsman and was docketed as
OMB-1-98-2067.
On Oct. 26, 1998, a complaint was filed charging
petitioner Gov. Manuel M. Lapid, Vice-Governor Clayton
Olalia, Provincial Administrator Enrico Quiambao, Provincial
Treasurer Jovito Sabado, Mabalacat Municipal Mayor Marino
Morales and Senior Police Offcer 4 Nestor Tadeo with alleged
"Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial to the
Best Interest of the Service" for allegedly ''having conspired
between and among themselves in demanding and collecting
from various quarrying operators in Pampanga, a control
fee, control slip, or monitoring fee of P120.00 per truckload of
sand, gravel, or other quarry material, without a duly enacted
provincial ordinance authorizing the collection thereof and
without issuing receipts for its collection.
The said amount was over and above the P40.00 prescribed
as sand fee under the present provincial ordinance.
The Ombudsman issued an Order dated January 13, 1999
preventively suspending the petitioners for six (6) months
without pay pursuant to Sec. 24 of R.A. 6770. On Jan. 19, 1999,
the DILG implemented the suspension of petitioner Lapid.
On November 22, 1999, the Ombudsman rendered a
decision in the Administrative Case finding the petitioner
administratively liable for misconduct for which he is meted
out the penalty of one (l) year suspension without pay pursuant
to Section 25(2) of R.A. 6770 (Ombudsman Act of 1989).

Book I General Provisions
Title Two Elective Off6cials

255

Held: The question is whether the suspension is
immediately executory pending appeal. It is clear from Sec. 27
of R.A. 6770, the Ombudsman Act of 1989 and Sec. 7 of the
Rules of Procedure of the Ombudsman that the punishment
imposed upon petitioner, i.e., suspension without pay for one
year, is not among those listed as final and unappealable, hence,
immediately executory. Section 27 states that all provisionary
orders of the Office of the Ombudsman are immediately effective
and executory; and that any order, directive or decision of the
said Office imposing the penalty of censure or reprimand or
suspension of not more than one (1) month's salary is final and
unappealable. As such the legal maxim "inclusion unius est
exclusio alterus" finds application.
An appeal timely filed, such as the one filed in the instant
case, will stay the immediate implementation of the decision.
This finds support in the Rules of Procedure issued by the
Ombudsman itself which states that "(Dn all other cases, the
decision shall become final after the expiration of ten (10)
days from receipt thereof by the respondent, unless a motion
for reconsideration or petition for certiorari (should now be
petition for review under Rule 43) shall have been filed by him
as prescribed in Section 27 of R.A. 6770."
Petitioner was charged administratively before the
Ombudsman and accordingly the provisions of the Ombudsman
Act should apply in his case. Section 68 (Execution Pending
appeal) of the Local Government Code only applies to
administrative decisions rendered by the Office of the President
or the appropriateSanggunian against elective local government
officials. Similarly, the provision in the Administrative Code of
1987 mandating execution pending review applies specifically
to administrative decisions of the Civil Service Commission
involving members of the Civil Service.
And while in one respect, the Ombudsman Law, the
Administrative Code of 1987 and the Local Government Code
are in pari materia insofar as the three (3) laws relate or deal
with public officers, the similarity ends there. Considering
however, that petitioner was charged under the Ombudsman
Act, it is this law alone which should govern his case.
2.
The decisions of the Office of the President are final and
executory. No motion for reconsideration is allowed by law but the

256

Book I- General Provisions
Title 'Two Elective Officials

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

parties may appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals. The appeal,
however, does not stay the execution of the decision. Thus, the DILG
Secretary may validly move for its immediate execution.

CALINGIN v. COURT OF APPEALS
434 SCRA 173, July 12, 2004, Quisumbing, J.
Facts: The Office of the President issued a Resolution
dated March 22, 2001 in OP Case No. 00-1-9220 entitled Vice
Governor Danilo P. Lagbas, et al. versus Governor Antonio P.
Calingin (Misamis Oriental) suspending Gov. Calingin for 90
days. On April 30, 2001, Undersecretary Eduardo R. Soliman
of the DILG, by authority of Secretary Jose D. Lina, Jr., issued
a Memorandum implementing the said Resolution of the Office
of the President. On May 3, 2001, Gov. Calingin filed before the
Office of the President a Motion for Reconsideration.
The DILG Memorandum bore the authority of the
Commission on Elections (COMELEC) which granted an
exemption to the election ban in the movement of any public
officer in its Resolution No. 3992 promulgated on April 24,
2001.
On May 7, 2001, Gov. Calingin fled a petition for
prohibition before the Court of Appeals to prevent the DILG
from executing the assailed suspension order. However, on
May 11, 2001, the Court of Appeals dismissed the said petition
and by resolution issued on July 1, 2002, denied petitioner's
motion for reconsideration.
Petitioner contends that decisions of the Office of the
President on cases where it has original jurisdiction become
final and executory only after the lapse of 15 days from the
receipt thereof and that the filing of a Motion for Reconsideration
shall suspend the running of the said period in accordance with
Section 15, Chapter 3, Book VII of the Administrative Code of
1987.
Petitioner further contends that Section 67, Chapter 4 of
the Local Government Code (Rep. Act 7160), which provides
that decisions of the Office of the President shall be final and
executory, applies only to decisions of the Office of the President
on administrative cases appealed from the sangguniang
panialawigan, sangguniang panlungsod of highly-urbanized
cities and independent component cities, and sangguniang

257

bayan of municipalities within the Metro Manila Area. It does
not cover decisions on cases where the Office of the President
has original jurisdiction such as those involving a Provincial
Governor.

Ruling: In Lapid u. Court of Appeals, 334 SCRA 738
(2000) we held that it is a principle of statutory construction
that where there are two statutes that apply to a particular
case, that which was specially intended for the said case must
prevail. The case on hand involves a disciplinary action against
an elective local official. Thus, the Local Government Code is
the applicable law and must prevail over the Administrative
Code which is of general application. Further, the Local
Government Code of 1991 was enacted much later than the
Administrative Code of 1987. In statutory construction, all
laws or parts thereof which are inconsistent with the later law
are repealed or modified accordingly.
Besides, even though appeal to the Court of Appeals is
granted under Sec. 1, Rule 43 of the Revised Rules of Court,
Sec. 12, Rule 43 of the Revised Rules of Court in relation
to Sec. 68 of the Local Government Code provides for the
immediate execution pending appeal. Under the same case of
Lapid • Court of Appeals, we enunciated that the decisions
of the Office of the President under the Local Government
Code are immediately executory even pending appeal because
the pertinent laws under which the decisions were rendered
mandated them to be so.
In sum, the decisions of the Office of the President are
final and executory. No motion for reconsideration is allowed
by law but the parties may appeal the decision to the Court of
Appeals. The appeal, however, does not stay the execution of
the decision. Thus, the DILG Secretary may validly move for
its immediate execution.
The instant petition for review on certiorari is DENIED.

A.

Decided Cases

1.
It would be more in keeping with the intent of the recall
provision of the LGC to construe regular local election as one
referring to an election where the office held by the local elective
official sought to be recalled will be contested and filled by the
electorate. Barangay recall election cannot be barred by Sanggun.ian
Kabataan elections.

PARAS v. COMELEC
264 SCRA 49, November 4, 1996, Francisco, J.
Facts: Petitioner Danilo E. Paras is the incumbent
Punong Barangay of Pula, Cabanatuan City who won during
the last regular barangay election in 1994. A petition for his
recall as Punong Barangay was filed by the registered voters
of the barangay. Acting on the petition for recall, public
respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC) resolved to
approve the petition, scheduled the petition signing on October
14, 1995, and set the recall election on November 13, 1995. At
least 29 or 30% of the registered voters signed the petition, well
above the 25% requirement provided by law.
In a resolution dated January 5, 1996, the COMELEC,
for the third time, re-scheduled the recall election on January
13, 1996.
Citing Section 74(b0) of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise
known as the Local Government Code, which states that "no
recall shall take place within one (l) year from the date of

264

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the official's assumption to office or one (1) year immediately
preceding a regular local election," petitioner Danilo Paras
insists that the scheduled January 13, 1996 recall election is
now barred as the Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) election was
set by Republic Act No. 7808 on the first Monday of May 1996,
and every three years thereafter.
Petitioner cites Associated Labor Union u. LetrondoMontejo, 237 SCRA 621, where the Court considered the SK
election as a regular local election. Petitioner maintains that
as the SK election is a regular local election, hence no recall
election can be had for barely four months separate the SK
election from the recall election.
Held: We do not agree.
The evident intent of Section 74 is to subject an elective
local official to recall election once during his term of office.
Subscribing to petitioner's interpretation of the phrase
regular local election to include the SK election will unduly
circumscribe the novel provision of the Local Government Code
on recall, a mode of removal of public officers by initiation of
the people before the end of his term. And if the SK election
which is set by R.A. No. 7808 to be held every three years from
May 1996 were to be deemed within the purview of the phrase
"regular local election," as erroneously insisted by petitioner,
then no recall election can be conducted rendering inutile the
recall provision of the Local Government Code.
It would, therefore, be more in keeping with the intent
of the recall provision of the Code to construe regular local
election as one referring to an election where the office held by
the local elective official sought to be recalled will be contested
and be filled by the electorate.
Nevertheless, recall against Paras at this time is no longer
possible because of the limitation stated under Section 74(b) of
the Code considering that the next regular election involving
the barangay office concerned is barely seven (7) months away,
the same having been scheduled on May 1997.
2.
The term "recall" in Sec. 74(b) refers to the recall election
itself and does not include the convening of the PRA. The phrase
"regular local election" refers to the day of the regular local election
and not to the election period.

CLAUDIO v. COMELEC
331 SCRA 388, May 4, 2000, Mendoza, J.
Facts: Petitioner Jovito 0. Claudio, was the duly elected
mayor of Pasay City in the May 11, 1998 elections. He assumed
office on July1, 1998. On May 29, 1999, 1,073 members of the
Preparatory Recall Assembly (PRA) composed of barangay
chairmen, kagawads, and sangguniang kabataan chairmen
of Pasay City, adopted Resolution No. 01, S. 1999, entitled
"RESOLUTION TO INITIATE THE RECALL OF JOVITO
0. CLAUDIO AS MAYOR OF PASAY CITY FOR LOSS OF
CONFIDENCE."
The petition for recall was filed on July 2, 1999,
accompanied by an affidavit of service of the petition on the
Office of the City Mayor. The COMELEC granted the petition
for recall and dismissed the oppositions against it.
Held: Petitioner contends that the term "recall" in
Sec. 74(b) refers to a process, in contrast to the term "recall
election" found in Sec. 74(a), which obviously refers to an
election. He claims that "when several barangay chairmen met
and convened on May 19, 1999 and unanimously resolved to
initiate the recall, followed by the taking of votes by the PRA
on May 29, 1999 for the purpose of adopting a resolution 'to
initiate the recall of Jovito Claudio as Mayor of Pasay City for
loss of confidence,' the process of recall began" and, since May
29, 1999 was less than a year after he had assumed office, the
PRA was illegally convened and all proceedings held thereafter,
including the filing of the recall petition on July 2, 1999, were
null and void.
We can agree that recall is a process which begins with the
convening of the preparatory recall assembly or the gathering
of the signatures at least 25% of the registered voters of a local
government unit, and then proceeds to the filing of a recall
resolution or petition with the COMELEC, the verification of
such resolution or petition, the fixing of the date of the recall
election, and the holding of the election on the scheduled date.
However, as used in paragraph (b) of Sec. 74, "recall"
refers to the election itself by means of which voters decide
whether they should retain their local official or elect his
replacement, excluding the convening of the PRA and the filing
of a petition for recall with the COMELEC. The term "recall"
in paragraph (b) refers to the recall election and not to the
preliminary proceedings to initiate recall.

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

267

As the recall election in Pasay City is set on April 15,
2000, more than one year after petitioner assumed office as
mayor of that city, we hold that there is no bar to its holding
on that date.

by "gross violation of pertinent provisions of the Anti-Graft and
Corrupt Practices Act, gross violation of pertinent provisions of
the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials,
etc."

Petitioner contends, however, that the date set by the
COMELEC for the recall election is within the second period
of prohibition in paragraph (b). He argues that the phrase
"regular local elections" in paragraph (b) does not only mean
"the day of the regular local election" which, for the year 2001
is May 14, but the election period as well, which is normally
at least forty-five (45) days immediately before the day of the
election. Hence, he contends that beginning March 30, 2000, no
recall election may be held.

On 1 April 2014, the COMELEC promulgated Resolution
No. 9864. Resolution No. 9864 found the recall petition
sufficient in form and substance, but suspended the funding of
any and all recall elections until the resolution of the funding

This contention is untenable.
The law is unambiguous in providing that "[n]o recall
shall take place within ... one (l) year immediately preceding a
regular local election." Had Congress intended this limitation
to refer to the campaign period, which period is defined in the
Omnibus Election Code, it could have expressly said so.

SEC. 75. Expenses Incident to Recall Elections.
Al l expenses incident to recall elections shall

be borne by the COMELEC. For this purpose,
there shall be included in the annual General
Appropriations Act a contingency fund at the
disposal of the COMELEC for the conduct of recall
elections.
A.

Book I General Provisions
Title Two Elective Officials

Decided Case

1.
Considering that there is an existing line item
appropriation for the conduct of recall elections in the 2014 GAA,
we see no reason why the COMELEC is unable to perform its
constitutional mandate to "enforce and administer all laws and
regulations relative to the conduct of xx x recall."
GOH v. BAYRON
748 Phil. 282, November 25, 2014, Carpio, J.
Facts: On 17 March 2014, Goh filed before the COMELEC
a recall petition, docketed as SPA EM No. 14-004 (RCL), against
Mayor Bayron due to loss of trust and confidence brought about

issue.
On 28 April 2014, Mayor Bayron filed with the COMELEC
an Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration and for Clarification
which prayed for the dismissal of the recall petition for lack of
merit.
On 19 May 2014, Goh filed a Comment/Opposition (To
the 27 April 2014 Omnibus Motion for Reconsideration and
for Clarification) with Motion to Lift Suspension which prayed
for the COMELEC's denial of Mayor Bayron's 27 April 2014
Omnibus Motion, as well as to direct COMELEC's authorized
representative to immediately carry out the publication of the
recall petition against Mayor Bayron, the verification process,
and the recall election of Mayor Bayron.

Ruling: The 1987 Constitution expressly provides the
COMELEC with the power to "[e]nforce and administer all laws
and regulations relative to the conduct of an election, plebiscite,
initiative, referendum, and recall." The 1987 Constitution not
only guaranteed the COMELEC's fiscal autonomy, but also
granted its head, as authorized by law, to augment items in its
appropriations from its savings. The 2014 GAA provides such
authorization to the COMELEC Chairman.
Despite Resolution No. 9882's statement about the alleged
failure of the 2014 GAA to provide for a line item appropriation
for the conduct of recall elections, we hold that the 2014 GAA
actually expressly provides for a line item appropriation for the
conduct and supervision of recall elections. This is found in the
Programs category of its 2014 budget, which the COMELEC
admits in its Resolution No. 9882 is a "line item for the
'Conduct and supervision of elections, referenda, recall votes
and plebiscites.'" In addition, one of the specific constitutional
functions of the COMELEC is to conduct recall elections.
When the COMELEC receives a budgetary appropriation for

268

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

its "Current Operating Expenditures," such appropriation
includes expenditures to carry out its constitutional functions,
including the conduct of recall elections. Thus, in Socrates v.
COMELEC 440 Phil. 106 (2002) (Socrates), recall elections
were conducted even without a specific appropriation for recall
elections in the 2002 GAA.
Considering that there is an existing line item
appropriation for the conduct of recall elections in the 2014
GAA, we see no reason why the COMELEC is unable to perform
its constitutional mandate to "enforce and administer all laws
and regulations relative to the conduct of x xx recall." Should
the funds appropriated in the 2014 GAA be deemed insufficient,
then the COMELEC Chairman may exercise his authority to
augment such line item appropriation from the COMELEC's
existing savings, as this augmentation is expressly authorized
in the 2014 GAA.
The petition is GRANTED. We REVERSE and SET
ASIDE Resolution No. 9882, and DIRECT the Commission
on Elections to immediately carry out the recall elections of
Mayor Lucilo R. Bayron of Puerto Princesa City, Palawan in
accordance with the provisions of the Local Government Code
and COMELEC Resolution No. 7505.

A.

Decided Case

I.
Respondent is considered on AWOL, and therefore validly
dropped from the rolls because he neither: (a) reported for work at

274

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

his original post at the OCV; nor (b) filed leave applications during
the period he was contesting his reassignment to the Office of the
Mayor.

OFFICE OF THE CITY MAYOR OF ANGELES CITY,
PAMPANGA v. VILLAROMAN
G.R. No. 234630, June 10, 2019, Perlas-Bernabe, J.
Facts: Respondent Dr. Josefina E. Villaroman held a
permanent position as head of the Office of the City Veterinarian
of Angeles City, Pampanga. On December 2, 2014, petitioner
Office of the City Mayor of Angeles City, headed by then Mayor
Edgardo Pamintuan, issued Memorandum No. 33/12, which
reassigned respondent to his office and directed respondent to
report to the Mayor's secretary for specific assignments. In a
Letter dated December 15, 2014, respondent requested that
he be restored to his original post but to no avail. Claiming
that his reassignment amounted to constructive dismissal,
respondent filed a petition to annul Memorandum No. 33/12
before the Civil Service Commission (CSC).
On March 9, 2015, petitioner issued Memorandum
Order No. 17/03 dropping respondent's name from the roll
of employees on two grounds: (a) his absence without official
leave (AWOL) at the Mayor's office for more than 30 days,
specifically from December 4, 2014 to March 9, 2015; and
(b) his failure to submit his performance evaluation reports.
Moreover, respondent was not given productivity incentive
benefits and his name was deleted from the March 1-15, 2015
payroll.

Ruling: A perusal of Memorandum 17/03 shows that
respondent's dropping from the rolls was premised on his
failure to report for duty at the Mayor's office pursuant to a
reassignment order, which was subsequently declared void for
amounting to constructive dismissal based on the CSC Rules
on Reassignment. Jurisprudence is clear that a government
employee could not have incurred absences in his reassigned
station if his reassignment thereat was void, as in this case.
Thus, the Court finds that respondent could not be validly
dropped from the rolls merely for failing to report for work at
the Mayor's office.
This notwithstanding, respondent should still be
considered on AWOL, and therefore validly dropped from the

Book I General Provisions
Title Three Human Resources and Development

275

rolls because he neither: (a) reported for work at bis original
post at the OCV; nor (b) filed leave applications during the
period he was contesting his reassignment to the Office of the
Mayor.
In several cases wherein government employees were
given void reassignments to different workstations and
thereafter dropped from the rolls for failing to report thereat,
the Court did not consider those employees on AWOL
because they either (a) reported to their original workstations
while contesting their reassignment orders or (b) filed leave
applications for the period that they failed to report for work
at the reassigned station, even though those applications were
later denied or no leave applications were filed for subsequent
periods. None of these circumstances were extant in this case.
Instead, in this case, respondent, without any proper
authority or justifiable reason therefor, chose to report for work
at the ICTD, which, contrary to the CA's ruling, is an office
separate from the OCV and discharges functions different from
the latter. While the ICTD is concerned with information and
communications technology, the OCV deals with animal-related
activities and policies. To work for a specific public office, it is
necessary that the same be by virtue of a valid personnel action
made according to the proper procedure. Surely, an employee
cannot just decide in what office or department he or she will
work. Hence, given the lack of authority or justifiable reason,
respondent's performance of work in the ICTD cannot be
counted as attendance at work. Consequently, he is considered
on AWOL for his failure to report for work for more than thirty
(30) days, and therefore, correctly dropped from the rolls under
Memorandum No. 33/12.
The petition is GRAN TED. The Decision and the
Resolution of the Court of Appeals are hereby REVERSED
and SET ASIDE. Respondent Dr. Josefina E. Villaroman was
validly dropped from the rolls due to absence without official
leave or AWOL.

SEC. 89. Prohibited Business and Pecuniary
Interest.
(a) It shall be unlawful for any local
government official or employee, directly or
indirectly, to:
(1) Engage in any business transaction
with the local government unit in which he
is an official or employee or over which he
has the power of supervision, or with any of
its authorized boards, officials, agents, or
attorneys, whereby money is to be paid, or
property or any other thing of value is to be
transferred, directly or indirectly, out of the
resources of the local government unit to such
person or firm;
(2) Hold such interests in any cockpit or
other games licensed by a local government
unit;
(3) Purchase any real estate or other
property forfeited in favor of such local
government unit for unpaid taxes or assessment,

which is prohibited under Section 89(2) of the Local Government
Code of 1991, and is sentenced to pay a fine of Pl0,000.

TEVES v. SANDIGANBAYAN
447 SCRA 309, December 17, 2004, Davide, Jr., J.
Facts: The indictment reads; ''The undersigned Special
Prosecution Officer II, hereby accuses EDGAR Y. TEVES and
TERESITA TEVES of violation of Section 3(h) of Republic Act
No. 3019, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act, committed as follows:
That on February 4, 1992, in Valencia, Negros
Oriental, Philippines, accused Edgar Y. Teves, a public
officer, being then the Municipal Mayor of Valencia,
Negros Oriental, committing the crime-herein charged in
relation to, while in the performance and taking advantage
of his official functions, and conspiring and confederating
with his wife, herein accused Teresita Teves, did then
and there willfully, unlawfully and criminally cause the
issuance of the appropriate business permit/license to
operate the Valencia Cockpit and Recreation Center in
favor of one Daniel Teves, said accused Edgar Y. Teves
having a direct financial or pecuniary interest therein
considering the fact that said cockpit arena is actually
owned and operated by him and accused Teresita Teves."

Ruling: Section 3h) of the Anti-Graft Law provides:
XXX

(h) Directly or indirectly having financial or
pecuniary interest in any business, contract or transaction
in connection with which he intervenes or takes part in
his official capacity, or in which he is prohibited by the

application dated 6 January 1989 he stated that he is the
owner and manager of the said cockpit.

statute, the Anti-Graft Law has to yield to the LGC of 1991,
which is the later expression of legislative will.

His interest in the Valencia Cockpit is direct and is,
therefore, prohibited under Section 89(2) of the LGC of 1991,
which reads:

The Decision of the Sandiganbayan, First Division,
in Criminal Case No. 2337 is hereby MODIFIED in that (1)
EDGAR Y. TEVES is convicted of violation of Section 3h) of
Republic Act No. 3019, or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices
Act, for possession of pecuniary or financial interest in a
cockpit, which is prohibited under Section 89(2) of the Local
Government Code of 1991, and is sentenced to pay a fine of
P10,000; and 2) TERESITA Z. TEVES is hereby ACQUITTED
of such offense.

Section 89. Prohibited Business and Pecuniary
Interest. - (a) It shall be unlawful for any local
government official or employee, directly or indirectly,

to:
(2) Hold such interests in any cockpit or
other games licensed by a local government unit ....
The offense proved, therefore, is the second mode of
violation of Section 3(h) of the Anti-Graft Law, which is
possession of a prohibited interest.
Under what law should petitioner Edgar Teves be
punished? It must be observed that Section 3(h) of the AntiGraft Law is a general provision, it being applicable to all
prohibited interests; while Section 89(2) of the LGC of 1991 is a
special provision, as it specifically treats of interest in a cockpit.
Notably, the two statutes provide for different penalties. The
Anti-Graft Law, particularly Section 9, provides for punishment
by imprisonment of not less than six years and one month nor
more than fifteen years, perpetual disqualification from public
office, and confiscation or forfeiture in favor of the Government
of any prohibited interest.
On the other hand, Section 514 of the LGC of 1991
prescribes a lighter penalty: imprisonment for six months
and one day to six years, or a fine of not less than Three
thousand pesos (P3,000.00) nor more than Ten Thousand
Pesos (P10,000.00), or both such imprisonment and fine at the
discretion of the court.
Conformably with these rules, the LGC of 1991, which
specifically prohibits local officials from possessing pecuniary
interest in a cockpit licensed by the local government unit
and which, in itself, prescribes the punishment for violation
thereof, is paramount to the Anti-Graft Law, which penalizes
possession of prohibited interest in a general manner.
Moreover, the latter took effect on 17 August 1960, while the
former became effective on 1 January 1991. Being the earlier

2.
The mere fact of having pecuniary interest in the
subject transactions is already sufficient to make respondent
administratively liable for misconduct. Her acts constitute grave
misconduct with the penalty of dismissal from the service.
FIELD INVE STIGATION UNIT-OFFICE OF THE
DEPUTY OMBUDSMAN FOR LUZON v. CASTRO
G.R. No. 232666, June 20, 2018, Reyes, Jr., J.
Facts: On August 2, 1996, Raquel A. De Castro worked
as a Municipal Accountant for the Municipality of Bongabong,
Oriental Mindoro.
During the respondent's employment, the Municipality of
Bongabong transacted with Pink Plate's General Merchandise,
Pink Shop Computer Center and Pink Plate's Bistro all of
which were owned by respondent's husband. Moreover, the
Municipality of Bongabong transacted with Pink Splash Resort
which is registered in the name of respondent's daughter.
Among the transactions were:
a) Pink Shop Computer Center: Purchase of
computer accessories for use in RHU-North on 02/20/07
amounting to P11,167.85
b) Pink
Plates
General
Merchandise:
Purchase of t-shirts with print for use in legislative

d) Pink Splash Resort: Purchase of meals and
snacks for use in Brgy. Empowerment Seminar and
Training on 12/22/09 for Pl 74,720.00

vouchers is necessary to consummate the subject transaction
with the Municipality.

Subsequently, the Field Investigation Unit (FIU)-Office
of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon charged respondent for
Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the Service and
Grave Misconduct on October 1, 2013.

Her repeated certification on the disbursement vouchers
covering numerous transactions clearly shows flagrant
disregard of the law or rules. Simply put, the culpability of the
respondent has been clearly established. Her acts coupled with
the surrounding circumstances constitute Grave Misconduct.

Ruling: A careful perusal of the records shows that the
respondent, on more than one occasion, knowingly certified
and approved disbursement vouchers covering transactions
between the Municipality of Bongabong and Pink Enterprises.
She certified the same notwithstanding the fact that she
clearly had pecuniary interests, albeit indirect, therein. The
prohibition laid down in Sections 89 and 341 of R.A. No. 7160
are clear in this regard.
Notably, the appellate court maintained that the mere
fact of having pecuniary interest in the subject transactions is
already sufficient to make respondent administratively liable
for misconduct. The sole issue then that must be resolved is
whether or not the respondent's acts constitute simple or grave
misconduct.
In downgrading the respondent's liability from Grave
to Simple Misconduct, the CA clearly failed to consider the
respondent's repeated violation of the law which transpired for
four years from 2006 to 2010.
While the respondent is correct in her claim that the
initiative to enter into the subject transactions did not
come from her, she is wrong in asserting that she neither
intervened nor participated in the consummation of the subject
transactions. Chapter IV of R.A. No. 7160, specifically Section
344 thereof, states the basic requirements for disbursement of
local funds.
There are at least three primary conditions or
requirements that must be met before local funds can be
disbursed. First, the local budget officer must certify to the
existence of appropriation that has been legally made for the
purpose. Second, the local accountant must have obligated
said appropriation. Third, the local treasurer certifies to the
availability of funds for the purpose. From the foregoing it is
clear that the respondent's certification on the disbursement

The petition is GRANT ED. The CA Decision and Resolution
are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision of the
Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Luzon finding respondent
Raquel A. De Castro liable for Grave Misconduct with the
penalty of dismissal is hereby REINSTATED.
SEC. 90. Practice of Profession.
(a) All
governors, city and municipal mayors are
prohibited from practicing their profession or
engaging in any occupation other than the exercise
of their function as local chief executives.
(b) Sanggunian members may practice their
professions, engage in any occupation, or teach

That sanggunian members who are also members
of the Bar shall not:
(1) Appear as counsel before any court
in any civil case wherein a local government
unit or any office, agency, or instrumentality
of the government is the adverse party;
(2) Appear as counsel in any criminal
case wherein an officer or employee of the
national or local government is accused of an
offence comm itted in relation to his office;
(3) Collect any fee for their appearance
in administrative proceedings involving the
local government unit of which he is an official;
and
(4) Use property and personnel of the
Government except when the sanggunian
member concerned is defending the interest of
the Government.

Decided Cases

1.
While certain local elective officials (like governors,
mayors, provincial board members and councilors) are expressly
subjected to a total or partial proscription to practice their profession
or engage in any occupation, no such interdiction is made on the
punong barangay and the members of the sangguniang barangay.
Since they are excluded from any prohibition, the presumption
is that they are allowed to practice their profession. However, as
punong barangay, respondent should have therefore obtained the
prior written permission of the Secretary of Interior and Local
Government before he entered his appearance as counsel for
Elizabeth and Pastor.

CATU v. RELLOSA
546 SCRA 209, February 19, 2008, Corona, J.
Facts: Complainant Wilfredo M. Catu is a co-owner of a
lot and the building erected thereon located at 959 San Andres
Street, Malate, Manila. His mother and brother, Regina Catu
and Antonio Catu, contested the possession of Elizabeth
C. Diaz-Catu and Antonio Pastor of one of the units in the
building. The latter ignored demands for them to vacate the
premises. Thus, a complaint was initiated against them in the
Lupong Tagapamayapa of Barangay 723, Zone 79 of the 6'
District of Manila where the parties reside.
Respondent Atty. Vicente Rellosa as punong barangay of
Barangay 723, summoned the parties to conciliation meetmgs.
When the parties failed to arrive at an amicable settlement,
respondent issued a certification for the fling of the appropriate
action in court.
Thereafter, Regina and Antonio filed a complaint
for ejectment against Elizabeth and Pastor in the MTC of
Manila. Respondent entered his appearance as counsel for the
defendants in that case. Because of this, complainant filed the
instant administrative complaint, claiming that respondent

Book I General Provisions
Title Three Human Resources and Development

283

committed an act of impropriety as a lawyer and as a public
officer when he stood as counsel for the defendants despite the
fact that he presided over the conciliation proceedings between
the litigants as punong barangay.

Ruling: Section 7(b)(2) of RA 6713 prohibits public
officials and employees, during their incumbency, from
engaging in the private practice of their profession "unless
authorized by the Constitution or law, provided that such
practice will not conflict or tend to conflict with their official
functions." This is the general law which applies to all public
officials and employees.
For elective local government officials, Section 90 (Practice
of Profession) of RA 7160 governs. This is a special provision
that applies specifically to the practice of profession by elective
local officials. As a special law with a definite scope (that is, the
practice of profession by elective local officials), it constitutes
an exception to Section 7(b)(2) of RA 6713, the general law on
engaging in the private practice of profession by public officials
and employees.
Of the elective local officials, governors, city mayors
and municipal mayors are prohibited from practicing their
profession or engaging in any occupation other than the exercise
of their functions as local chief executives, This is because they
are required to render full time service. They should therefore
devote all their time and attention to the performance of their
official duties.
On the other hand, members of the sangguniang
panlalawigan, sangguniangpanlungsod or sangguniang bayan
may practice their professions, engage in any occupation, or
teach in schools except during session hours. In other words,
they may practice their professions, engage in any occupation,
or teach in schools outside their session hours. Unlike
governors, city mayors and municipal mayors, members of
the sangguniang panlalawigan, sangguniang panlungsod
or sangguniang bayan are required to hold regular sessions
only at least once a week. Since the law itself grants them the
authority to practice their professions, engage in any occupation
or teach in schools outside session hours, there is no longer any
need for them to secure prior permission or authorization from
any other person or office for any of these purposes.

Since barangay officials are excluded from any prohibition,
the presumption is that they are allowed to practice their
profession. And this stands to reason because they are not
mandated to serve full time. In fact, the sangguniang barangay
is supposed to hold regular sessions only twice a month.
Accordingly, as punong barangay, respondent was not
forbidden to practice his profession. However, he should have
procured prior permission or authorization from the head of his
Department, as required by civil service regulations.
A civil service officer or employee whose responsibilities do
not require his time to be fully at the disposal of the government
can engage in the private practice of law only with the written
permission of the head of the department concerned under
Section 12, Rule XVIII of the Revised Civil Service Rules.
As punong barangay, respondent should have therefore
obtained the prior written permission of the Secretary of Interior
and Local Government before he entered his appearance as
counsel for Elizabeth and Pastor. This he failed to do.
The failure of respondent to comply with Section 12, Rule
XVI II of the Revised Civil Service Rules constitutes a violation
of his oath as a lawyer: to obey the laws. Lawyers are servants
of the law, vires legis, men of the law. Their paramount
duty to society is to obey the law and promote respect for
it. To underscore the primacy and importance of this duty,
it is enshrined as the first canon of the Code of Professional
Responsibility.
In acting as counsel for a party without first securing the
required written permission, respondent not only engaged in
the unauthorized practice of law but also violated civil service
rules which is a breach of Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional
Responsibility:
Rule 1.01 - A lawyer shall not engage in
unlawful, dishonest, immoral or deceitful conduct.

OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION AND SUPPORT THE
ACTIVITIES OF THE INTEGRATED BAR.
Indeed, a lawyer who disobeys the law disrespects it. In
so doing, he disregards legal ethics and disgraces the dignity of
the legal profession.
Atty. Vicente G. Rellosa is hereby found GUILTY of
professional misconduct for violating his oath as a lawyer
and Canons 1 and 7 and Rule 1.01 of the Code of Professional
Responsibility. He is therefore SUSPENDED from the practice
of law for a period of six months effective from his receipt of
this resolution. He is sternly WARNED that any repetition of
similar acts shall be dealt with more severely.
Respondent is strongly advised to look up and take to
heart the meaning of the word delicadeza.
2. Pursuant to Sec. 90 (b), (1) of the Local Government
Code, Atty. Rambuyong, as sanggunian member, cannot appear as
counsel of a party adverse to the NPC, which is an instrumentality
of government.
REPUBLIC v. RAM BUYONG
632 SCRA 66, October 4, 2010, Del Castillo, J.
Facts: Alfredo Y. Chu filed a case for collection of a
sum of money and/or damages against the National Power
Corporation (NPC) docketed as Civil Case No. 1-197 with the
RTC of Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay. Appearing as counsel for Chu
is Atty. Richard B. Rambuyong who was then the incumbent
Vice-Mayor of Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay.
Thereafter, NPC led a Motion for Inhibition of Atty.
Rambuyong arguing that under Section 90 (b), (1) of Republic
Act (RA) No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government
Code, sanggunian members are prohibited "to appear as
counsel before any court wherein x x x any office, agency or
mstrumentahty of the government is the adverse party."
NPC contended that being a government-owned or controlled
corporation, it is embraced within the term "instrumentality."

For not living up to his oath as well as for not complying
with the exacting ethical standards of the legal profession,
respondent failed to comply with Canon 7 of the Code of
Professional Responsibility:

Ruling: The provisions of law relevant to the present
case is Sec. 90, LGC:

CANON 7. A LAWYE R SHALL AT ALL TIMES

SEC. 93. Partisan Political Activity.
No
local official or employee in the career civil service
shall engage directly or indirectly in any partisan
political activity or take part in any election,
initiative, referendum, plebiscite, or recall, except
to vote, nor shall he use his official authority or
influence to cause the performance of any political
activity by any person or body. He may, however,
express his views on current issues, or mention the
names of certain candidates for public office whom
he supports. Elective local officials may take part in
partisan political and electoral activities, hut it shall
he unlawful for them to solicit contributions from
their subordinates or subject these subordinates
to any of the prohibited acts under the Omnibus
Election Code.

(1) Appear as counsel before any court in any civil
case wherein a local government unit or any office, agency,
or instrumentality of the government is the adverse party;

Section 2 of the Administrative Code of 1987 is clear
and unambiguous. It categorically provides that the term
"instrumentality" includes government-owned or controlled
corporations. Hence there is no room for construction. All
that has to be done is to apply the law as called for by the
circumstances of the case. It is not disputed that the NPC is
a government-owned or controlled corporation. Therefore
following Section 2 of the Administrative Code of 1987, the
NPC is clearly an instrumentality of the government.
Finally, Section 446 of the Local Government Code
provides that "[t]he sangguniang bayan, the legislative body
of the municipality, shall be composed of the municipal vice
mayor as the presiding officer x xx." Thus, pursuant to Section
90 (b), (1) of the Local Government Code, Atty. Rambuyong,
as sanggunian member, cannot appear as counsel of a party
adverse to the NPC, which is an instrumentality of government.
The petition is GRAN TED. Atty. Rambuyong
disqualified from appearing in Civil Case No. 1-197.

SEC. 94. Appointment of Elective and Appointive
Local Officials; Candidates Who Lost in an Election.
(a) No elective or appointive local official shall

Unless otherwise allowed by law or by the
primary functions of his position, no elective or
appointive local official shall hold any other office or

SEC. 91. Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
(a) Officials and employees of local government
units shall file sworn statements of assets,
liabilities and net worth, lists of relatives within
the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity
in government service, financial and business
interest, and personnel data sheets as required by

shall, within one (1) year after such election, be
appointed to any office in the Government or any

Decided Cases

1.
Petitioner Mayor knew that when he appointed Alconaba,
who ran and lost under his ticket in the May 2004 elections. the
latter was covered by the one-year prohibition and thus not qualified
for appointment to any public office. Clearly, the Sandiganbayan

288

did not err in finding petitioner guilty of the crime of unlawful
appointments defined and penalized under Article 244 of the RPC.
ANACTA, JR. v. SANDIGANBAYAN
G.R. No. 219352, November 14, 2018, Carpio, J.
Facts: On 10 January 2005, petitioner, Fidel Anacta,
Jr. who was then the Municipal Mayor of Borongan, Eastern
Samar, appointed Atty. Reynaldo A. Alconaba as a member
of the Board of Directors of the Borongan Water District,
representing the professional sector. When the appointment
was referred to the Local Water Utilities Administration for
confirmation, LWUA declared Alconaba's appointment as void.
LWUA declared that Alconaba's appointment is prohibited
by law since it was made within one year from the 2004 May
elections in which Alconaba had lost in his bid for the position
of municipal councilor.
Petitioner was charged with violating Article 244 of the
RPC, in relation to Section 6, Article IX-B of the Constitution
and Section 94 of R.A. No. 7160.
The Sandiganbayan found petitioner guilty of the crime
of unlawful appointments defined and penalized under Article
244 of the RPC, and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of
imprisonment of arresto mayor in its medium period, that is 2
months and 1 day to 4 months, and a fine of Pl,000.
Ruling: In People u. Sandiganbayan, 581 Phil. 419
(2008), the Court held that legal disqualification under Article
244 of the RPC includes temporary disqualification such as the
one-year prohibition provided under Section 6, Article IX-B of
the Constitution and Section 94(b) of R.A. No. 7160.
The Borongan Water District is a government-owned or
controlled corporation, created under Presidential Decree (P.D.)
No. 198. In Davao City Water District v. CSC, 278 Phil. 605
(1991) the Court categorically ruled that local water districts
are government-owned or controlled corporations with original
charter.
Under Section 3(b) of P.D. No. 198, petitioner, as the
Municipal Mayor of Borongan in 2005, was the appointing
authority or the person empowered to appoint the members
of the Board of Directors of the Borongan Water District.
Petitioner Mayor knew that when he appointed Alconaba, who

SEC, 95. Additional or Double Compensation.No elective or appointive local official or employee
shall receive additional, double, or indirect

double, or indirect compensation.
SEC. 96. Permission to Leave Station.
(a) Provincial, city, municipal and barangay
appointive officials going on official travel shall
apply and secure written permission from their
respective local chief executives before departure.
The application shall specify the reasons for such
travel, and the permission shall be given or withheld
based on considerations of public interest, financial
capability of the local government unit concerned
and urgency of the travel.
Should the local chief executive concerned
fail to act upon such application within four (4)
working days from receipt thereof, it shall be
deemed approved.
(b) Mayors
of

use of public funds, permission from the Office of
the President shall be secured.
(d) Field officers of national agencies or offices
assigned in provinces, cities and municipalities
shall not leave their official stations without giving
prior written notice to the local chief executive
concerned. Such notice shall state the duration of
travel and the name of the officer whom he shall

absence.
A.

Decided Case

1. At that moment when petitioners were claiming
reimbursements, the required permissions of the Governor for
petitioners' travels to Manila were yet to be obtained and despite that,
petitioners still proceeded to approve the disbursement vouchers.
Given that the travels made by petitioners were unauthorized at the
time of reimbursements, then there was no legal obligation on the
part of the municipality to disburse the said claimed travel expenses
to the benefit of petitioners.
CABRERA v. PEOPLE
G.R. Nos. 1916110-14, July 29, 2019, Reyes, J., Jr., J.
Facts: See infra.
Ruling: Petitioners' second act constituting violation of
Section 3 (e) ofR.A. No. 3019 is the alleged illegal reimbursements
made by petitioners of the amount representing their expenses
for their alleged unauthorized travels.
Two acts are involved here: the unauthorized travels and
the illegal reimbursements.
Petitioners claim that their travels to Manila in 1998.-1999
were authorized by the Governor. To prove this fact, petitioners
adduce as evidence the testimony of then incumbent Governor
Mandanas who testified that he signed petitioners' permit
to travel on December 14, 2000. He also admitted that it is
his policy to allow all travels and sign any documents when
presented to him w hether before or after the travel dates.

Book I
General Provisions
Title Three Human Resources and Development

291

The pertinent provision of the LGC of 1991 is Section 96
on Permission To Leave Station.
As established, at the time the disbursement voucher
was approved by petitioners, there was yet no sufficient basis
that would justify the reimbursement of travel expenses. The
validity, propriety and legality of the claimed travel expense
can be justified if the travel itself is with the written permission/
approval of the Governor as mandated by the LGC of 1991. At
that moment when petitioners were claiming reimbursements,
the required permissions of the Governor for petitioners' travels
to Manila were yet to be obtained and despite that, petitioners
still proceeded to approve the disbursement vouchers. This was
the reason why a special audit was conducted in December 1999,
as the reimbursements made were questionable. Even the local
accountant noted beside her signature as to the absence of the
required travel order. Evidently, there was circumvention of
the rules and the procedure in claiming reimbursements. Given
that the travels made by petitioners were unauthorized at the
time of reimbursements, then there was no legal obligation on
the part of the municipality to disburse the said claimed travel
expenses to the benefit of petitioners.

It bears to stress that mere unauthorized travel does
not automatically equate to violation of Section 3(e) of RA No.
3019. There must be proof that the said unauthorized travel
caused undue injury to the government or that it amounts
to giving unwarranted benefit or advantage to a private
person or to oneself for that matter. The act of petitioners
in approving the disbursement vouchers without compliance
with the disbursement procedures (i.e., necessary supporting
documents, written permission of the governor authorizing
their travel) constitute bad faith and gross inexcusable
negligence in observing the law, causing undue injury to the
Municipality of Taal. The Municipality of Taal was effectively
deprived of the amounts of P27,651.83 and Pl 70,987.66
which petitioners Librada and Fe respectively reimbursed for
themselves. Indeed, there is no greater proof of undue injury to
the government when public funds are used for an unjustified
expense.
The Petition is DENIED. The Decision and Resolution of
the Sandiganbayan finding petitioners guilty of RA 3019 are
AFFIRMED.

the requirement in Section 99 of the Local Government Code of

the said law.

Camarines Sur, by then Secretary Ricardo T. Gloria of DECS
upon the endorsement of the Provincial School Board of
Camarines Sur; that despite the recommendation of Secretary
Gloria, President Fidel V. Ramos appointed respondent Corazon
Malaya to the position of Schools Division Superintendent
of Camarines Sur; that respondent's appointment was made
without prior consultation with the Provincial School Board, in
violation of Section 99 of R.A. 7160. Hence, petitioner prayed
that respondent's appointment be recalled and set aside for

The instant petition is DENIED.
SEC. 100. Meeting and Quorum; Budget.- (a)
The local school board shall meet at least once a
month or as often as may be necessary.
(b)

Held: Section 99 of the Local Government Code of 1991
applies to appointments made by the DECS. This is because
at the time of the enactment of the Local Government Code,
schools division superintendents were appointed by the DECS
to specific division or location. In 1994, the Career Executive
Service Board issued Memorandum Circular No. 21, Series of
1994, placing the positions of schools division superintendent
and Assistant Schools Division Superintendent within the
career executive service. Consequently, the power to appoint
persons to career executive service positions was transferred
from the DECS to the President. The appointment may not
be specific as to location. The prerogative to designate the
appointees to their particular stations was vested in the D ECS
Secretary, pursuant to the exigencies of the service, as provided
in Department of Education, Culture and Sports Order No. 75,
Series of 1996.

Any ofthe co-chairmen may call a meeting.

A majority of all its members shall constitute a
quorum. However, when both co-chairmen are
present in a meeting, the Local Chief Executive
concerned, as a matter of protocol, shall be given
preference to preside over the meeting. The division
superintendent, city superintendent or district
supervisor, as the case may be, shall prepare the
budget of the school board concerned. Such budget
shall be supported by programs, projects, and
activities of the school board for the ensuing fiscal
year. The affirmative vote of the majority of all the
members shall be necessary to approve the budget.
(c) The annual school board budget shall give
priority to the following:
(1) Construction, repair, and maintenance
of school buildings and other facilities of public
elementary and secondary schools;

In the case at bar, the appointment issued by President
Ramos in favor of respondent to the Schools Division
Superintendent position on September 3, 1996 did not specify
her station. It was Secretary Gloria who, in a Memorandum
dated November 3, 1997, assigned and designated respondent
to the Division of Camarines Sur, and petitioner to the Division
oflriga City.
We agree with the Civil Service Commission and the Court
of Appeals that, under the circumstances, the designation of
respondent as Schools Division Superintendent of Camarines
Sur was not a case of appointment. Her designation partook
of the nature of a reassignment from Iriga City, where she
previously exercised her functions as Officer-in-Charge-Schools
Division Superintendent, to Camarines Sur. Clearly, therefore,

Decided Case

I.
The salaries and personnel-related benefits of the
teachers appointed by the provincial school board of Cebu in
connection with the establishment and maintenance of extension
classes are declared chargeable against the Special Education Fund
of the province. However, the expenses incurred by the provincial

298

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

government for the college scholarship grants should not be charged
against the Special Education Fund, but against the General Funds
of the province of Cebu.

THE COMMISSION ON AUDIT v. PROVINCE OF CEBU
G.R. No. 141386, November 29, 2001, Ynares-Santiago, J.
Facts: The provincial governor of the province of Cebu,
as chairman of the Local School Board, under Section 98 of
the Local Government Code, appointed classroom teachers
who have no items in the DECS plantilla to handle extension
classes that would accommodate students in the public schools.
In the audit of accounts conducted by the Commission on
Audit (COA) of the Province of Cebu, for the period of January
to June 1998, it appeared that the salaries and personnelrelated benefits of the teachers appointed by the province for the
extension classes were charged against the provincial Special
Education Fund (SEF). Likewise charged to the SEF were the
college scholarship grants of the province. Consequently, the
COA issued Notices of Suspension to the province of Cebu,
saying that disbursements for the salaries of teachers and
scholarship grants are not chargeable to the provincial SEF.
Faced with the Notices of Suspension issued by the COA, the
province of Cebu, represented by its governor, filed a petition
for declaratory relief with the trial court. The court declared
the questioned expenses as authorized expenditures of the
SEF.
Held: Sec. 100 of the Local Government Code of 1991
provides for the priority of the annual school board budget.
The intent of the legislature is the controlling factor in
the interpretation of a statute. In this connection, the following
portions of the deliberations of the Senate on the second reading
of the Local Government Code on July 30, 1990 are significant.
"Continuing her interpellation, Ms. Raymundo then
adverted to subsection 4 of Section 101 [now Section 100,
paragraph (c)] and asked if the budget is limited only to the
three (3) priority areas mentioned. She also asked what is
meant by the phrase "maintenance of extension classes."
In response, Mr. De Pedro clarified that the provision is
not limited to the three (3) activities, to which may be added

Book I General Provisions
Title Four Local School Boards

299

other sets of priorities at the proper time. As to the extension of
classes, he pointed out that the school boards may provide out
of its own funds, for additional teachers or other requirements
if the National Government cannot provide funding therefor.
Upon Ms. Raymundo's query, Mr. de Pedro further explained
that support for teacher tools could fall under the priorities
cited and is covered by certain circulars."
Undoubtedly, the aforecited exchange of views clearly
demonstrates that the legislature intended the SEF to answer
for the compensation of teachers handling extension classes.
Even under the doctrine of necessary implication, the allocation
of the SEF for the establishment and maintenance of extension
classes logically implies the hiring of teachers who should, as a
matter of course be compensated for their services.
With respect, however, to college scholarship grants, a
reading of the pertinent laws of the Local Government Code
reveals that said grants are not among the projects for which
the proceeds of the SEF may be appropriated. It should be
noted that Sections l00(c) and 272 of the Local Government
Code substantially reproduced Section 1, of R.A. No. 5447.
But, unlike payment of salaries of teachers which falls within
the ambit of "establishment and maintenance of extension
classes" and "operation and maintenance of public schools,"
the "granting of government scholarship to poor but deserving
students" was omitted in Sections 100(c) and 272 of the Local
Government Code. Casus omissus pro omisso habendus est. It
is not for this Court to supply such grant of scholarship where
the legislature has omitted it.

SEC. 101. Compensation and Remuneration.
- The co-chairmen and members of the provincial,
city or municipal school board shall perform
the duties as such without compensation or
remuneration. Members thereof who are not
government officials or employees shall be entitled
to necessary traveling expenses and allowances
chargeable against the funds of the local school
board concerned, subject to existing accounting
and auditing rules and regulations.

CHAPTER 1. - Settlement of Boundary Disputes
SEC. 118. Jurisdictional Responsibility for

disputes between and among local government

To this end:
(a) Boundary disputes involving two (2) or

panlungsod or sangguniang bayan concerned.
(b) Boundary disputes involving two (2) or

highly urbanized cities, shall be jointly referred
for settlement to the respective sanggunians of the
parties.
(e) In the event the sanggunian fails to effect
an amicable settlement within sixty (60) days from
the date the dispute was referred thereto, it shall

A.

Decided Cases

1.
The Governor-General, pursuant to Act Number 17 48 has
full authority to promulgate rules defining and fixing the boundary
line between different municipalities. The Municipality of Cardona,
in not giving any ground why the aforementioned Act should be
deemed as unconstitutional, the presumption of its constitutionality
should be sustained. (Municipality of Cardona u. Municipality of
Binangonan, 34 Phil. 518, March 29, 1916.)
2.
Since there is no law providing for the exclusive
jurisdiction of any court or agency over the settlement of boundary
disputes between a municipality and an independent component city
of the same province, respondent court committed no grave abuse
of discretion in denying the Motion to Dismiss. RTCs have general
jurisdiction to adjudicate all controversies except those expressly
withheld from their plenary powers.
MUNICIPALITY OF KANANGA v. MAD RONA
402 SCRA 330, April 30, 2003, Panganiban, Jr., J.
Facts: A boundary dispute arose between the Municipality
of Kananga and the City of Ormoc. By agreement, the parties
submitted the issue to amicable settlement by a joint session
of the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Ormoc City and the
Sangguniang Bayan of Kananga on October 31, 1997.
No amicable settlement was reached. Instead, the
members of the joint session issued Resolution No. 97-01,
which in part reads:

Book I- General Provisions
Title Nine Other Provisions Applicable to Local Government Units

313

"x x x IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED x x x to pass
a resolution certifying that both the Sangguniang
Panlungsod of Ormoc City and the Sangguniang Bayan
of Kananga, Leyte have failed to settle amicably their
boundary dispute and have agreed to elevate the same to
the proper court for settlement by any of the interested
party (sic)."
To settle the boundary dispute, the City of Ormoc filed
before the RTC of Ormoc City (Branch 35) on September 2,
1999.
Ruling: There is no question that Kananga is a
municipality constituted under Republic Act No. 542. By virtue
of Section 442(d) of the LGC, it continued to exist and operate
as such.
However, Ormoc is not a highly urbanized, but an
independent component city created under Republic Act No.
179. Section 89 thereof reads:
"Sec. 89. Election ofprovincial governor and members
of the Prouincial Board of the Prouince of Leyte. -- The
qualified voters of Ormoc City shall not be qualified and
entitled to vote in the election of the provincial governor
and the members of the provincial board of the Province
of Leyte."
Section 118 of the LGC applies to a situation in which a
component city or a municipality seeks to settle a boundary
dispute with a highly urbanized city, not with an independent
component city. While Kananga is a municipality, Ormoc is
an independent component city. Clearly then, the procedure
referred to in Section 118 does not apply to them.
Nevertheless, a joint session was indeed held, but no
amicable settlement was reached. A resolution to that effect
was issued, and the sanggunians of both local government
units mutually agreed to bring the dispute to the RTC for
adjudication. The question now is: Does the regional trial court
have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the claim?
Since there is no law providing for the exclusive
jurisdiction of any court or agency over the settlement of
boundary disputes between a municipality and an independent
component city of the same province, respondent court

314

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

committed no grave abuse of discretion in denying the Motion
to Dismiss. RTCs have general jurisdiction to adjudicate all
controversies except those expressly withheld from their
plenary powers. They have the power not only to take judicial
cognizance of a case instituted for judicial action for the first
time, but also to do so to the exclusion of all other courts at that
stage. Indeed, the power is not only original, but also exclusive.
The Petition is DENIED and the challenged Order
AFFIRMED.
3.
Instead of assuming jurisdiction over the boundary
dispute, the COSLAP should have referred respondents' complaint
to the Sangguniang Panglungsod of Caloocan City and the
Sangguniang Bayan of San Jose del Monte. Their decision may be
appealed to the proper Regional Trial Court.
NATIONAL HOUSING AUTHORITY v. COMMISSION
ON THE SETTLEMENT OF LAN D PROBLEMS

505 SCRA 38, October 23, 2006, Sandoval-Gutierrez, J.
Facts: Since 1968, there has been an existing boundary
dispute between the Municipality of San Jose del Monte,
Bulacan and the City of Caloocan. In order to resolve the
long-challenged conflict, the Sangguniang Bayan of San Jose
de! Monte passed and approved Resolution No. 20-02-94 on
February 10, 1994 which recognizes the official boundary of
respondent municipality and the City of Caloocan.
On August 8, 1995, another Resolution was passed by
the Sangguniang Bayan of San Jose de! Monte recognizing
the geographic position and plane coordinates of Tala Estate,
Caloocan City contained in BM No. 11-24 as the "lot lines"
delineating the boundary between the Municipality of San Jose
de! Monte and Caloocan City. This prompted the Department
of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Region III to
conduct a relocation survey.
The Comprehensive Report states that the San Jose
de! Monte Sangguniang Bayan Resolutions contradict the
delineation embodied in SWO-41615 of the Tala Estate, a
598-hectare property allotted by the government mainly for
housing and resettlement site under the administration of the
National Housing Authority (NHA), pursuant to Presidential

Book I - General Provisions
Title Nine Other Provisions Applicable to Local Government Units

316

Proclamation No. 843 issued by then President Ferdinand E.
Marcos on April 26, 1971.
Unsatisfied with the report of the DENR, respondent
municipality filed a complaint with the Commission on
Settlement of Land Problems (COSLAP ), against petitioner
NHA and several residents of San Jose del Monte.
On June 22, 1998, the COSLAP rendered its Resolution
ruling that the correct boundary between respondents San
Jose de! Monte and Caloocan City is that specified in the twin
Resolutions of the Sangguniang Bayan of said respondents.

Ruling: There is no provision in Executive Order No.
561 (creating COSLAP ) that COSLAP has jurisdiction over
a boundary dispute between two local government units.
Under Republic Act No. 7160 or the Local Government Code,
the respective legislative councils of the contending local
government units have jurisdiction over their boundary
disputes. (Sections 118 and 119).
Rule III implementing the above provisions also provides
for the same jurisdiction of the LGU's respective legislative
councils.
Thus, instead of assuming jurisdiction over the case,
the COSLAP should have referred respondents' complaint
to the Sangguniang Panglungsod of Caloocan City and the
Sangguniang Bayan of San Jose del Monte. Their decision may
be appealed to the proper Regional Trial Court.
We rule that the COSLAP does not have jurisdiction
over the boundary dispute between San Jose de! Monte and
Caloocan City.
We GRANT the petition. The assailed Decision and
Resolution of the Court of Appeals are SET ASIDE.
4. The Province of Antique's Resolution stating that the
Province of Antique was not amenable to any form of settlement,
with the Province of Oriental Mindoro over jurisdictional right over
Liwagao Island effectively blocked any way to continue following
the steps in the IRR on settlement of boundary disputes. As such,
respondents' petition before the RTC must be upheld.

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

PROVINCE OF ANTIQUE v. CALAB OCAL
793 SCRA 13, June 8, 2016, Carpio, Acting C.J.
Facts: Sometime between the years 1978 and 1979,
Dolores Bago (Mayor Bago), then Mayor of the Municipality of
Bulalacao, Oriental Mindoro, agreed to lend the administration
of Liwagao Island to Oscar Lim (Mayor Lim), then Mayor of
the Municipality of Caluya, Antique. The agreement was made
orally and without executing any formal documents to this
effect. The condition attached to the agreement was that the
island would be returned upon termination of either party's
terms in office.
The terms of both mayors ended in 1987. Mayor Lim
allegedly returned Liwagao Island to the Municipality of
Bulalacao. However, the Municipality of Caluya continued to
exercise administration over the island.

to any form of settlement over the jurisdiction of Liwagao
Island and asserted that the same rightfully belongs to their
province.
Thereafter, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Oriental
Mindoro issued a resolution directing the Provincial Legal
Office to file the necessary legal action to claim Liwagao Island.
Thus, on 12 September 2012, respondents filed their
petition before the RTC of Roxas, Oriental Mindoro.
Ruling: Having established that the case involves a
boundary dispute, the procedure to resolve the same is that
established under Section, 118 Local Government Code.
Under the said law, "the respective legislative councils of
the contending local government units have jurisdiction over
their boundary disputes." Sections 118 and 119 of the Local
Government Code state:

On 15 April 2002, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan
of Oriental Mindoro passed a resolution confirming its
jurisdictional rights and dominion over Liwagao Island.
However, according to respondents, the Municipality of Caluya
and the Province of Antique continued to claim and exercise
authority over Liwagao Island.

SECTION
118. Jurisdictional Responsibility for
Settlement ofBoundary Dispute. B oundary disputes between
and among local government units shall, as much as possible,
be settled amicably. To this end:

Respondents Province of Oriental Mindoro's, et al., claim
that despite the fact that it is the Province of Oriental Mindoro
and the Municipality of Bulalacao that provide government
services to the island, petitioners "continued collecting real
property taxes" from Liwagao's inhabitants.

(c) Boundary disputes involving municipalities
or component cities of different provinces shall be
jointly referred for settlement to the Sanggunians of
the provinces concerned.

On 20 February 2012, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of
Oriental Mindoro passed Resolution No. 1454-2012 entitled
Resolution Calling for the Conduct of a Joint Session between
the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of the Province of Oriental
Mindoro and the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of the Province
of Antique for the Settlement of Jurisdictional Claim over the
Island of Liwagao.
Upon receiving a copy of Resolution No. 1454-2012, the
Vice Governor of Antique wrote the Sangguniang Panlalawigan
of Oriental Mindoro of her willingness to conduct a joint session
to settle the boundary dispute. However, on 25 May 2012, the
Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Antique issued Resolution No.
142-2012 informing Oriental Mindoro that it was not amenable

xxx

(e) In the event the Sanggunian fails to effect
an amicable settlement within sixty (60) days from the
date the dispute was referred thereto, it shall issue a
certification to that effect. Thereafter, the dispute shall be
formally tried by the Sanggunian concerned which shall
decide the issue within sixty (60) days from the date of the
certification referred to above.
SECTION 119. Appeal. -- Within the time and manner
prescribed by the Rules of Court, any party may elevate the
decision of the Sanggunian concerned to the proper Regional
Trial Court having jurisdiction over the area in dispute. The
Regional Trial Court shall decide the appeal within one (1) year
from the filing thereof. Pending final resolution of the disputed
area prior to the dispute shall be maintained and continued for
all legal purposes.

318

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Respondents' resort to filing a case before the RTC was
warranted under the circumstances of this case.
It must be emphasized that respondents followed the
procedure laid down in the Local Government Code. They took
all the necessary steps to settle the dispute within the procedure
set out in the law, and by all indication, was prepared to see
the matter thru in order to lay the issue to rest.
However, petitioners Province of Antique and
Municipality of Caluya failed to perform their concomitant
responsibility under the same law, leaving respondents with
no other recourse but to bring the matter to court. Petitioners
cannot demand that respondents now follow the procedure
when they themselves have made it impossible for any party to
follow the same. The Province of Antique's Resolution No. 1422012 dated 25 May 2012, stating that the Province of Antique
was not amenable to any form of settlement, effectively blocked
any way to continue following the steps in the IRR.
As such, respondents Province of Oriental Mindoro and
Municipality of Bulalacao petition before the RTC must be
upheld. Otherwise, they will be left without any recourse or
legal remedy to assert their claim over Liwagao Island. Such
uncertainty is unacceptable, as the fate of the island's residents
rests in the immediate resolution of the dispute.
The petition is DISMISSED. The RTC is ORDERED to
hear and decide the case with dispatch.
5.
Municipality of Sugpon's (Ilocos Sur) Notice of Appeal
was served on the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Province of
Benguet whose members were the same officials who constituted
the already defunct Joint Sanggunian. For Bakun to insist that the
Joint Sanggunian, after it became defunct should have been served
the Notice of Appeal is unreasonable, if not impossible.
MUNICIPALITY OF BAKUN, BENGUET v.
MUNICIPALITY OF SUGPON, ILOCOS SUR
G.R. No. 224335, March 2, 2020, Lazaro-Javier, J.
Facts: The Municipality of Bakun, Benguet and the
Municipality of Sugpon, Ilocos Sur both lay claim on a
1,118-hectare parcel of land found in the middle of their
respective territories.

Book I General Provisions
Title Nine Other Provisions Applicable to Local Government Units

319

In line with the provisions of the 1991 Local Government
Code (LGC) on boundary disputes, the issue was referred to
an Ad Hoc Joint Sanggunian of the Provinces of Benguet and
Ilocos Sur for resolution. Following the parties' failure to reach
a settlement, the Joint Sangguni an ordered them to submit
their respective position papers.
After due proceedings, the Joint Sanggunian, voting 4-3,
issued Joint Resolution No. 1, Series of 2014 adjudging the
land to Bakun. Aggrieved, the Province of Ilocos Sur, through
the Municipality of Sugpon served a Notice of Appeal to the
Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Province of Benguet.
Consequently, on May 20, 2014, Sugpon filed with
the RTC-Ilocos Sur its "Petition on Appeal". The RTC took
cognizance of the appeal which the CA affirmed.
Ruling: Here, Sugpon served on the Province of Benguet

a Notice of Appeal to the RTC. It also subsequently filed with
the RTC its corresponding "Petition on Appeal" setting forth
the statement of facts and law, the assigned errors, and the
arguments.
First. On its face, the Notice of Appeal conformed with
Rule 40 of the Rules of Court.
Second. Sugpon's Notice of Appeal was served on the
Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Province of Benguet whose
members were the same officials who constituted the already
defunct Joint Sanggunian. For Bakun to insist that the Joint
Sanggunian, after it became defunct should have been served
the Notice of Appeal is unreasonable, if not impossible.
Third. Sugpon's omission or failure to furnish Bakun a
copy of the Notice of Appeal is not fatal. Bakun's right to notice
and due process was never curtailed. It in fact received copy of
the Notice of Appeal from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of
Benguet. Following its receipt of the Notice of Appeal, Bakun
was even able to file a motion to dismiss the appeal before the
RTC.
The Court resolves to DENY the petition for review for
failure to adequately show that the Court of Appeals committed
reversible error in rendering its Decision and Resolution.

SUBIC BAY METROPOLITAN
AUTHORITY v. COMELEC
262 SCRA 492, September 26, 1996, Panganiban, J.
Facts: In April 1993, the Sangguniang Bayan of Morong,
Bataan passed Pambayang Kapasyahan Bilang 10, Serye
1993, expressing therein its absolute concurrence, as required
by Sec. 12 of R.A. 7227, (Bases Conversion and Development
Act) to join the Subic Special Economic Zone. On September
5, 1993, the Sangguniang Bayan submitted the Kapasyahan
to the Office of the President. Private Respondents Enrique
Garcia and Catalino Calimbas filed with the COMELEC an
Initiative petition to recall Pambayang Kapasyahan Blg. 10,
Serye 1993. Petitioner SMBA seeks to nullify the respondent
COMELEC's Orders denying the petitioner's plea to stop the
holding of a local initiative and referendum on the proposition
to recall the Kapasyahan.
Held: To begin with, the process started by private
respondents was an INITIATIVE but respondent COMELEC
made preparations for a REFERENDUM only. In fact, in the
body of the Resolution as reproduced in the footnote below,
the word "referendum" is repeated at least twenty-seven (27)
times, but "initiative" is not mentioned at all. The COMELEC
labeled the exercise as a "Referendum;" the counting of votes
was entrusted to a "Referendum Committee;" the documents
were called "referendum returns;" the canvassers, "Referendum
Board of Canvassers" and the ballots themselves bore the
description "referendum." To repeat, not once was the word
"initiative" used in said body of COMELEC Resolution No.
2848. And yet, this exercise is unquestionably an INITIATIVE.
Prescinding from the definitions under Secs. 120 and
126 of the Local Government Code, we gather that initiative
is resorted to (or initiated) by the people directly either
because the law-making body fails or refuses to enact the law,
ordinance, resolution or act that they desire or because they

324

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

want to amend or modify one already existing. On the other
hand, in a local referendum, the law-making body submits to
the registered voters for approval or rejection any ordinance or
resolution duly enacted by it.
From the above differentiation, it follows that there is
need for the COMELEC to supervise an initiative more closely,
its authority thereon extencling not only to the counting and
canvassing of votes but also to seeing to it that the matter or
act submitted to the people is in the proper form and language
so it may be easily understood and voted upon by the electorate.
This is especially true where the proposed legislation is lengthy
and complicated, and should thus be broken down into several
autonomous parts, each such part to be voted upon separately.
Care must also be exercised that "(n)o petition embracing more
than one subject shall be submitted to the electorate," although
"two or more propositions may be submitted in an initiative."

MARMETO v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
840 SCRA 581, September 26, 2017, Del Castillo, J.
Facts: On January 21, 2013, Oscar Marmeto filed in
behalf of the Muntinlupa People Power (MPP) a proposed
ordinance with the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Muntinlupa.
The proposal sought the creation of a sectoral council and the
appropriation of the amount of P200 million for the livelihood
programs and projects that would benefit the people of
Muntinlupa City.
On December 2, 2013, Marmeto filed a second proposed
ordinance with the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Muntinlupa.
Again, no favorable action was done by the Sanggunian within
30 days from the filing of the proposal, prompting Marmeto file
a second initiative petition with the Office of the City Election
Officer on February 10, 2014.

In sum, we hold that the respondent Commission should
be given an opportunity to review and correct its errors in
promulgating its orders and in preparing-if necessary-for
the plebiscite and that the said Commission had administrative
and initiatory quasi-judicial jurisdiction to pass upon the
question or whether the proposal is sufficient in form and
language, and whether such proposal or part/parts thereof
are clearly and patently outside the powers of the municipal
council ofMorong to enact, and therefore violative of law.

On April l, 2014, Marmeto filed a Supplemental Petition
to comply with the requirements of COMELEC Resolution No.
2300, which provided the Rules and Regulations Governing the
Conduct of Initiative on the Constitution, and Initiative and
Referendum on National and Local Laws.

COMELEC Resolution No. 2848 is ANNULLED and
SET ASIDE. The initiative on Pambayang Kapasyahan Big.
10, Serye 1993 is REMAN DED to the COMELEC for further
proceedings consistent with the foregoing discussion.

Ruling: In Goh v. Hon. Bayron, 748 Phil. 282 (2014)
the Court has definitely ruled the question of whether the
COMELEC may prevent the conduct of a recall election for
lack of specific budgetary allocation therefor.

2. The creation of a separate local legislative body is
ultra vires. Nothing in the LGC allows the creation of another
local legislative body that will enact, approve, or reject local laws
either through the regular legislative process or through initiative
or referendum. The sectoral council VMPP's proposed function
overlaps with the Local Development Council. Although comprised
of Muntinlupa residents and voters, Marmeto's MPP remains a
private organization and its members cannot be considered as
public officers who are burdened with responsibility for public funds
and who may be held administratively and criminally liable for the
imprudent use thereof.

Contrary to the COMELEC's assertions, the Court ruled
that the FY 2014 GAA "actually expressly provides for a line
item appropriation for the conduct and supervision of recall
elections."

On July 22, 2014, the COMELEC issued the assailed
Resolution No. 14-0509 which effectively dismissed
Marmeto's second initiative petition for lack of budgetary
allocation.

Although Goh involved the conduct of recall elections,
the P1.4 billion appropriation under the FY 2014 GAA was for
the "conduct and supervision of elections, referenda, recall
votes and plebiscites." The term "election" is comprehensive
enough to include other kinds of electoral exercises, including
initiative elections. Thus, the budgetary allocation for the
"regulation of elections" identified as the COMELEC's MFO

326

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

should necessarily also cover expenses for the conduct of
initiative elections.
The Court will proceed to rule on the issue of whether
Marmeto's propositions are within the power of the Sanggunian
to enact and thus be valid subjects of an initiative petition.
Marmeto's initiative petitions propose the following:
(1) The creation of a sectoral council composed of
12 members from various sectors who will serve as the
people's representatives for the implementation and
management of livelihood programs and projects;
(2) The sectoral council will also stand as the
people's representatives that will directly propose,
enact, approve, or reject ordinances through initiative or
referendum;
(3) An appropriation of P200 million to be allocated
for livelihood projects of the people and other purposes.
The net income from the projects will then be used for
the delivery of basic services and facility for Muntinlupa
residents;

Book I General Provisions

327

is rendered unnecessary by the task the COMELEC must
assume under the LGC. Section 122(c) of the LGC provides
that the COMELEC (or its designated representative) shall
extend assistance in the formulation of the proposition.

(B) The sectoral council VMPP's proposed function
overlaps with the Local Development Council
The law recognizes the right of the people to organize
themselves and encourages the formation of non-governmental,
community-based, or sectoral organizations that aim to promote
the nation's welfare. Even the LGC promotes relations between
the LGUs and people's and non-governmental organizations
(PO/NGOs), and provides various ways by which they can be
active partners in pursuing local autonomy.
The LGC requires the establishment in each LGU of
a local development council, whose membership includes
representatives of POs/NGOs operating within the LGU.
These local development councils are primarily tasked with
developing a "comprehensive multi-sectoral development plan"
in their respective LG Us.

(4) The MPP will create the implementing
guidelines and procedure for the utilization of the
appropriated funds, and conduct programs and project
feasibility studies.

(C) The LGC requires local government funds
and monies to be spent solely for public purposes, and
provides transparency and accountability measures to
ensure this end

These propositions, however, are either sufficiently
covered by or violative of the LGC for reasons explained below.

Marmeto' s petition proposes the appropriation of P200
million for the livelihood programs and projects of Muntinlupa
residents. Significantly, the utilization of this amount is
subject to the guidelines to be later implemented by
Manneto's MPP. That these guidelines will be drafted and
implemented subsequent to the initiative elections denies
the Muntinlupa residents of the opportunity to assess and
scrutinize the utilization of local funds, and gives Marmeto
and his organization an almost complete discretion in
determining the allocation and disbursement of the funds. It is
no justification that the funds will be used for public purposes
on the claim these will be applied to programs and projects
that will eventually redound to the benefit of the public.

(A) The creation of a separate local legislative
body is ultra vires
Under the LGC, local legislative power within the city is
to be exercised by the Sangguniang Panlungsod, which shall
be comprised of elected district and sectoral representatives.
The sectoral representatives, moreover, shall be limited to
three members, coming from enumerated/identified sectors.
Significantly, nothing in the LGC allows the creation of
another local legislative body that will enact, approve, or reject
local laws either through the regular legislative process or
through initiative or referendum. Even Marmeto's claim that
the sectoral council will not legislate but will merely "facilitate"
the people's exercise of the power of initiative and referendum

Our laws have put in place measures to ensure
transparency and accountability in dealing with public funds,
since "[p]ublic funds are the property of the people and must be

328

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

used prudently at all times with a view to prevent dissipation
and waste." These measures may be subverted or rendered
inapplicable when the management and utilization of the funds
is turned over to private persons or entities. Although comprised
of Muntinlupa residents and voters, Marmeto's MPP remains a
private organization and its members cannot be considered as
public officers who are burdened with responsibility for public
funds and who may be held administratively and criminally
liable for the imprudent use thereof.

LOCAL GOVERNMENT TAXATION

The Petition for certiorari and mandamus is DISMISSED.
CHAPTER 1. - General Provisions
SEC. 128. Scope.
The provisions herein
shall govern the exercise by provinces, cities,
municipalities, and barangays of their taxing and
other revenue- raising powers.
SEC. 129. Power to Create Sources of Revenue.
- Each local government unit shall exercise its
power to create its own sources of revenue and
to levy taxes, fees, and charges subject to the
provisions herein, consistent with the basic policy
of local autonomy. Such taxes, fees, and charges
shall accrue exclusively to the local government
units.
A.

Comm ents

1.
The new Code has invested the local government units
with increased powers to tax, thereby empowering them with a
wider capacity to raise their own revenues within their respective
territorial jurisdictions. Before the Local Government Code of
1983 and the present one of 1991, the authority of taxation to local
government units was very limited.
2.
"The power to levy taxes is not inherent in municipal
corporations. This applies equally well to license and occupation
taxes. The fact that the State creates municipal governments does
not by implication clothe them with the power to levy taxes. That
power must be conferred in clear terms, or must result by necessary
implication from the language made use of in the law. 'Whi le

taxation,' says the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, "is an incident
of sovereignty absolutely necessary to maintain government, the
authority to impose taxes depends upon express Legislative grant,
and not upon incidental governmental power. There is no such
thing as taxation by implication. The burden is always upon the
taxing authority to point to the act of assembly which authorizes
the imposition to the tax claimed. Taxation is a sovereign state
governmental power not possessed by municipalities or municipal
divisions unless delegated to them. In other words, municipalities
have no implied power of taxation and must look to the statutory
grant for such authority as they possess in the imposition of taxes."

Decided Cases

1.
The City of Manila has no power to compel property
holders to lease the portions of public sidewalks which adjoin their
lands and to impose a license fee equal to 1/2 of the assessed value
of the said portion of the sidewalk.
CU-UNJIENG v. PATSTONE
42 Phil. 818, February 21, 1922, Ostrand, J.
Facts: Sec. 2507 of the Administrative Code authorizes
the Municipal Board of the City of Manila to establish fire
limits, determine the kinds of buildings or structures that
may be erected within said limits, regulate the manner of
construction and repairing the same, and fix the fees for permits
for the construction, repair, or demolition of buildings and
structures. Under this provision, the Municipal Board passed
an ordinance requiring land owners desiring to erect buildings
upon their property along certain streets to build arcades over
the portions of the sidewalks adjoining their lands, and to pay
therefor by way of license fees, 1/2 of the assessed value of the
city land located within the arcades.
Plaintiff desires to erect a warehouse in Azcarraga St. but
was denied the permit, until he shall have made provision for
the construction of an arcade over the sidewalk in front of the
building, and until he has paid 1/2 of the assessed value of the
city land located within the arcade of said building.
Without the arcade, the normal fee would have been
P31.00, but with it, the fee is P525.60. Plaintiff refused to

Title One Local Government Taxation

331

obey both requisites on the ground that the ordinance was
unconstitutional for the council exceeded its powers. Plaintiff
filed a petition for mandamus, which was granted. Defendant
appealed.
Held: There are three kinds of licenses: 1) license for
regulation of useful occupations or enterprises. This is based
on the police power and in the absence of authority to tax for
revenue, the fee must be of a sufficient amount to include
expenses of issuing the license, cost of necessary inspection or
police surveillance, and other incidental expenses; 2) license
for regulation of non-useful occupations. This is also incidental
to police power, but the municipal corporation has noted
discretion in fixing the amount, provided it is not unreasonable,
oppressive, or tyrannical; 3) license for revenue only. It rests
upon the taxing power. Its only limitation is that there must
be no discrimination or oppression and the burden shall be
equally charged upon all persons in similar circumstances.
Legislative power in regard to taxes and licenses are not
inherent in municipal corporations but must be granted by
statute either expressly or by necessary implication. Like other
delegated powers, it must be strictly construed. Legislative
power to levy this license fee can only be based under Sec.
2444(h) of the Administrative Code, authorizing the City of
Manila to establish fire limits. determine the kinds of buildings
or structures that may be erected within said limits, and fix
the fees for permits for construction, repair or demolition or
buildings and structures.
In the case at bar, the fee exacted is a license fee for
revenue, which is not authorized under existing statutes. The
City of Manila has no power to compel property holders to
lease the portions of the public sidewalks wb..ich adjoin their
lands. In imposing a fee equal to 1/2 of the assessed value of
the portion of the sidewalk covered by the arcade in question,
the Municipal Board exceeded its powers. The construction of
buildings is a useful enterprise and the amount of the license fee
should therefore be limited to the cost of licensing, regulating
and surveillance. It does not appear that the cost would be
materially increased through the construction of the arcade,
and it is therefore clear that the excessive fee is imposed for
the purpose of revenue.

2.
There is no double taxation in imposing an occupation tax
where one tax is imposed by the State, by virtue of Section 201 of the
National Internal Revenue Code and one by the City of Manila, by
virtue of Ordinance No. 3398.

PUNSALAN v. MUN. BOARD OF THE
CITY OF MANILA
95 Phil. 46, May 26, 1956, Reyes, J.
Facts: The municipal Board of Manila passed Ordinance
No. 3398 imposing a municipal occupation tax on persons
exercising various professions in the city and penalizing nonpayment of said tax. The ordinance was enacted pursuant to
Sec. 18(1) of R.A. 409 which empowers the Municipal Board
to impose a municipal occupation tax not to exceed P50.00 per
annum on persons engaged in the various professions referred
therein. Among the professions taxed were those to which the
plaintiffs-two lawyers, a medical practitioner, a certified
public accountant, a dentist, and a pharmacist belong.
Having already paid their occupation tax under Sec. 201 of
the National Internal Revenue Code, plaintiffs, upon being
required to pay the additional tax prescribed in the ordinance,
paid the same under protest and then brought an action for the
annulment of said ordinance and the refund of taxes collected
but paid under protest.
Held: The argument against double taxation may not be
invoked where one tax is imposed by the state and the other
is imposed by the city, it being widely recognized that there
is nothing obnoxious in the requirement that license fees or
taxes be exacted with respect to the same occupation, calling or
activity by both the state and the political subdivisions thereof.
3.
A tax ordinance should not be singular and exclusive
as to exclude any subsequently established sugar central. Since
a subsequent sugar central cannot be subject to tax because the
ordinance points only to Ormoc Sugar, the ordinance is declared
unconstitutional.

ORMOC SUGAR CO., INC. v. TREAS. OF ORMOC CITY
22 SCRA 603, February 17, 1968, Bengzon, J.
Facts: In 1964, the Municipal Board of Ormoc City
passed an ordinance imposing on any and all products of
centrifugal sugar milled, the Ormoc Sugar Co., a municipal tax

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One Local Government Taxation

333

equivalent to 1 percent per export sale to the United States
and other foreign countries. Payments of said tax were made
under protests by Ormoc Sugar Co. Said company later filed a
complaint against the City of Ormoc alleging that the aforesaid
ordinance is unconstitutional for being violative of the equal
protection clause and the rule on uniformity of taxation. It
further alleged that the tax is neither a production nor a license
tax, which Ormoc City under its charter and under R.A. 2264
is authorized to impose, and that the tax amounts to a customs
duty, fee or charge in violation of Sec. 21) of R.A. 2264 because
the tax is on both the sale and export of sugar.

Held: The equal protection clause applies only to persons
or things identically situated and does not bar a reasonable
classification of the subject of legislation, and a classification is
reasonable when: 1)it is based on substantial distinctions which
make real differences; 2) these are germane to the purpose
of the law; 3) the classification applies not only to present
conditions but also to future conditions which are substantially
identical to those of the present; 4) the classification applies
only to those who belong to the same class.
A perusal of the requisites instantly shows that the
questioned ordinance does not meet them, for it taxes only
centrifugal sugar produced and exported by Ormoc Sugar Co.,
and none other. When the ordinance was enacted, said company
was the only sugar central in the City of Ormoc, but still the
classification to be reasonable should be in terms applicable
to future conditions as well. The taxing ordinance should not
be singular and exclusive as to exclude any subsequently
established sugar central of the same class as the Ormoc Sugar
Co., for the coverage of the tax. A subsequently sugar central,
as it is now, cannot be subject to the tax because the ordinance
expressly points only to Ormoc Sugar Co., as the entity to be
levied upon.
Said ordinance being short of the legal requirements, is
declared unconstitutional.
Ormoc Sugar Co., is entitled to a refund of the tax paid
under protest, but without interest because said tax was not
arbitrarily collected. At the time of the collection, the ordinance
provided a sufficient basis to preclude arbitrariness, the same
being presumed constitutional until declared otherwise.

from extending the levy of any kind of "taxes, fees or charges on

ultra vires and void.

PETRON CORPORATION v. TIANGCO
551 SCRA 484, April 16, 2008, Tinga, J.
Facts: Petron maintains a depot or bulk plant at the
Navotas Fishport Complex in Navotas. Through that depot,
it has engaged in the selling of diesel fuels to vessels used in
commercial fishing in and around Manila Bay. On 1 March
2002, Petron received a letter from the office of Navotas
Mayor, respondent Toby Tiangco, wherein the corporation was
assessed taxes "relative to the figures covering sale of diesel
declared by your Navotas Terminal from 1997 to 2001." The
stated total amount due was P6,259,087.62, a figure derived
from the gross sales of the depot during the years in question.
The computation sheets that were attached to the letter made
reference to Ordinance 92-03, or the New Navotas Revenue
Code (Navotas Revenue Code).
Ruling: Section 133(h) of the LGC reads as follows:
Sec. 133. Common Limitations on the Taxing
Powers of Local Government Units. -- Unless
otherwise provided herein, the exercise of the taxing
powers of provinces, cities, municipalities, and Barangays
shall not extend to the levy of the following:
XXX

(h) Excise taxes on articles enumerated under the
National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and taxes,
fees or charges on petroleum products;
Evidently, Section 133 prescribes the limitations on the
capacity of local government units to exercise their taxing
powers otherwise granted to them under the LGC. Apparently,
paragraph (h) of the Section mentions two kinds of taxes which
cannot be imposed by local government units, namely: "excise
taxes on articles enumerated under the National Internal
Revenue Code [(NIRC)], as amended;" and "taxes, fees or
charges on petroleum products."
Excise taxes, as imposed under the NIRC, do not pertain
to "the performance, carrying on, or exercise of an activity," at
least not to the extent of equating excise with business taxes.

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscnl Matters
Title One - Local Government Taxation

343

We next consider whether the clause "taxes, fees or
charges on petroleum products" in Section 133(h) precludes
local government units from imposing business taxes based on
the sale of petroleum products.
Section 133(h) states that local government units "shall
not extend to the levy ofxxx taxes, fees or charges on petroleum
products." Respondents assert that the phrase "taxes, fees or
charges on petroleum products" pertains to the imposition of
direct or excise taxes on petroleum products, and not business
taxes. If the phrase actually pertains to excise taxes, then it
would be an exercise in utter redundancy, since the preceding
phrase already prohibits the imposition of excise taxes on
articles already subject to such taxes under the NIRC, such as
petroleum products.
We can concede that a tax on a business is distinct from
a tax on the article itself, or for that matter, that a business
tax is distinct from an excise tax. However, such distinction
is immaterial insofar as the latter part of Section 133(h) is
concerned, for the phrase "taxes, fees or charges on petroleum
products" does not qualify the kind of taxes, fees or charges
that could withstand the absolute prohibition imposed by
the provision. The absence of such a qualification leads to
the conclusion that a11 sorts of taxes on petroleum products,
including business taxes, are prohibited by Section 133(h).
Where the law does not distinguish, we should not distinguish.
While Section 133(h) does not generally bar the imposition
of business taxes on articles burdened by excise taxes under
the NIRC, it specifica11y prohibits local government units from
extending the levy of any kind of "taxes, fees or charges on
petroleum products." Accordingly, the subject tax assessment
is ultra vires and void.
The Petition is GRANTED. The Decision of the RTC of
Malabon City is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the subject
assessment for deficiency taxes on petitioner is ordered
CANCELLED.

The City of Manila, through its City Treasurer, began
imposing and collecting the business tax under Section 21 (B)
of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, beginning January
1994.

Decided Case

Shipping and airline companies questioned this Code to
the Regional Trial Courts. These cases were consolidated in

1.
Section 133(j) of the LGC clearly proscribes LGUs from
imposing any tax on the gross receipts of transportation contractors,
persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by
hire, and common carriers by air, land or water.
CITY OF MAN ILA v. COLET
744 SCRA 265, December 10, 2014,
Leonardo-De Castro, J.
Facts: The Manila Revenue Code was enacted on June
22, 1993 by the City Council of Manila and approved on June
29, 1993 by then Manila Mayor Alfredo S. Lim (Lim). Section
21B) of said Code originally provided:
Section 21. Tax on Businesses Subject to the Excise,
Value-Added or Percentage Taxes Under the NIRC. • On any
of the following businesses and articles of commerce subject to
the excise, value-added or percentage taxes under the National
Internal Revenue Code, hereinafter referred to as NIRC, as
amended, a tax of three percent (3%) per annum on the gross
sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year is hereby
imposed:
XXX

B) On the gross receipts of keepers of garages,
cars for rent or hire driven by the lessee, transportation
contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight
for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water, except
owners of bancas and owners of animal-drawn two-wheel
vehicle.
Shortly thereafter, Ordinance No. 7807 was enacted by the
City Council of Manila on September 27, 1993 and approved by
Mayor Lim on September 29, 1993, already amending several
provisions of the Manila Revenue Code.

Ruling: Section 133(j) of the LGC clearly and
unambiguously proscribes LG Us from imposing any tax on the
gross receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged
in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and
common carriers by air, land, or water. Yet, confusion arose
from the phrase "unless otherwise provided herein," found at
the beginning of the said provision. The City of Manila and its
public officials insisted that said clause recognized the power
of the municipality or city, under Section 143(h) of the LGC, to
impose tax "on any business subject to the excise, value-added
or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue Code,
as amended." And it was pursuant to Section 143(h) of the
LGC that the City of Manila and its public officials enacted,
approved, and implemented Section 21(B) of the Manila
Revenue Code, as amended.
The Court is not convinced. Section 133(j) of the LGC
prevails over Section 143(h) of the same Code, and Section
21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was manifestly
in contravention of the former.
First, Section 133(j) of the LGC is a specific provision that
explicitly withholds from any LGU, i.e., whether the province,
city, municipality, or barangay, the power to tax the gross
receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged in the
transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common
carriers by air, land, or water.
In contrast, Section 143 of the LGC defines the general
power of the municipality (as well as the city, if read in relation
to Section 151 of the same Code) to tax businesses within its
jurisdiction. While paragraphs (a) to (g) thereof identify the
particular businesses and fix the imposable tax rates for each,
paragraph (h) is apparently the "catch-all provision" allowing
the municipality to impose tax "on any business, not otherwise

346

specified in the preceding paragraphs, which the sanggunian
concerned may deem proper to tax[.]"

(k) Taxes on premiums paid
reinsurance or retrocession;

The succeeding proviso of Section 143(h) of the LGC, viz.,
"Provided, That on any business subject to the excise, valueadded or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue
Code, as amended, the rate of tax shall not exceed two percent
(2%) of gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year[,]"
is not a specific grant of power to the municipality or city to
impose business tax on the gross sales or receipts of such a
business. Rather, the proviso only fixes a maximum rate of
imposable business tax in case the business taxed under Section
143(h) of the LGC happens to be subject to excise, value added,
or percentage tax under the N !RC.

(I) Taxes, fees or charges for the registration
of motor vehicles and for the issuance of all kinds of
licenses or permits for the driving thereof, except
tricycles;

Petitioner is already paying three (3%) percent common
carrier's tax on its gross sales/earnings under the National
Internal Revenue Code. To tax petitioner again on its gross
receipts in its transportation of petroleum business would
defeat the purpose of the Local Government Code.
Consistent with the foregoing legislative intent, Republic
Act No. 7716, more popularly known as the Expanded ValueAdded Tax (E-VAT) Law, which took effect after the LGC on
May 28, 1994, expressly amended the NIRC of 1977 and added
to Section 115 of the latter on "Percentage tax on carriers and
keepers of garages," the following proscription: "The gross
receipts of common carriers derived from their incoming
and outgoing freight shall not be subjected to the local taxes
imposed under Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the
Local Government Code of 1991."
Sec. 21 (B) of the Manila Revenue Code is declared null
and void.

(m) Taxes, fees, or other charges on Philippine
products actually exported, except as otherwise
provided herein;
(n) Taxes, fees, or charges on Countryside and

dully registered under R.A. No. 6810 and Republic
Act Numbered Sixty-nine hundred thirty-eight R.A.
No. 6938 otherwise known as the "Cooperatives
Code of the Philippines" respectively; and

The omnibus grant of power to municipalities and cities
under Section 143(h) of the LGC cannot overcome the specific
exception/exemption in Section 133(j) of the same Code. This is
in accord with the rule on statutory construction that specific
provisions must prevail over general ones.
It is clear that the legislative intent in excluding from
the taxing power of the local government unit the imposition
of business tax against common carriers is to prevent a
duplication of the so-called "common carrier's tax."

The Airport Lands and Buildings of the Manila

estate tax imposed by the City of Paranaque. All the real estate
tax assessments, including the final notices of real estate tax
delinquencies, issued by the City of Paranaque on the Airport Lands

MAN ILA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AUTHORITY v.
COURT OF APPEALS
495 SCRA 591, July 20, 2006, Carpio, J.
Facts: Petitioner Manila International Airport Authority
(MIAA) operates the Ninoy Aquino International Airport
(NALA) Complex in Paranaque City under Executive Order
No. 903, otherwise known as the Revised Charter of the Manila
International Airport Authority ("MIAA Charter"). Executive
Order No. 903 was issued on 21 July 1983 by then President

348

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Ferdinand E. Marcos. Subsequently, Executive Order Nos. 909
and 298 amended the MIAA Charter.
As operator of the international airport, MIAA
administers the land, improvements and equipment within
the NAIA Complex. The MIAA Charter transferred to MIAA
approximately 600 hectares of land, including the runways
and buildings ("Airport Lands and Buildings") then under
the Bureau of Air Transportation. The MIAA Charter further
provides that no portion of the land transferred to MIAA shall
be disposed of through sale or any other mode unless specifically
approved by the President of the Philippines.
On 28 June 2001, MIAA received Final Notices of Real
Estate Tax Delinquency from the City of Paranaque for the
taxable years 1992 to 2001.
On 17 July 2001, the City of Paranaque, through its
City Treasurer, issued notices of levy and warrants of levy
on the Airport Lands and Buildings. The Mayor of the City
of Paranaque threatened to sell at public auction the Airport
Lands and Buildings should MIAA fail to pay the real estate
tax delinquency. MIAA thus sought a clarification of OGCC
Opinion No. 061.
On 1 October 2001, MIAA filed with the Court of Appeals
an original petition for prohibition and injunction, with prayer
for preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order.
The petition sought to restrain the City of Paranaque from
imposing real estate tax on, levying against, and auctioning for
public sale the Airport Lands and Buildings. The petition was
docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 66878.
Ruling: We rule that MIAA 's Airport Lands and Buildings
are exempt from real estate tax imposed by local governments.

government instrumentality exercising not only governmental
but also corporate powers. Thus, MIAA exercises the
governmental powers of eminent domain, police authority
and the levying of fees and charges. At the same time, MIAA
exercises "all the powers of a corporation under the Corporation
Law, insofar as these powers are not inconsistent with the
provisions of this Executive Order."
A government instrumentality like MIAA falls under
Section 133(0) of the Local Government Code, which states:
SEC. 133. Common Limitations on the Taxing
Powers of Local Government Units. - Unless otherwise
provided herein, the exercise of the taxing powers
of provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays
shall not extend to the levy of the following:
xxXx

(0) Taxes, fees or charges of any kind
on the National Government, its agencies and
instrumentalities and local government units.
The Airport Lands and Buildings of MIAA, which its
Charter calls the "principal airport of the Philippines for
both international and domestic air traffic," are properties of
public dominion because they are intended for public use. As
properties of public dominion, they indisputably belong
to the State or the Republic of the Philippines.
As properties of public dominion, the Airport Lands
and Buildings are outside the comm erce of man. The
Court has ruled repeatedly that properties of public dominion
are outside the commerce of man.

MIAA is a government instrumentality vested with
corporate powers to perform efficiently its governmental
functions. MIAA is like any other government instrumentality,
the only difference is that MIAA is vested with corporate
powers.

Since the Airport Lands and Buildings are inalienable in
their present status as properties of public dominion, they are
not subject to levy on execution or foreclosure sale. As long as
the Airport Lands and Buildings are reserved for public use,
their ownership remains with the State or the Republic of the
Philippines.

When the law vests in a government instrumentality
corporate powers, the instrumentality does not become
a corporation. Unless the government instrumentality is
organized as a stock or non-stock corporation, it remains a

Section 234(a) of the Local Government Code exempts
from real estate tax any "[r]eal property owned by the Republic
of the Philippines."

350

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

This exemption should be read in relation with Section
133(0) of the same Code, which prohibits local governments
from imposing "[t]axes, fees or charges of any kind on the
National Government, its agencies and instrumentalities
x xx" The real properties owned by the Republic are titled
either in the name of the Republic itself or in the name of
agencies or instrumentalities of the National Government.
However, portions of the Airport Lands and Buildings
that MIAA leases to private entities are not exempt from real
estate tax. For example, the land area occupied by hangars
that MIAA leases to private corporations is subject to real
estate tax. In such a case, MIAA has granted the beneficial use
of such land area for a consideration to a taxable person and
therefore such land area is subject to real estate tax.
We GRANT the petition. We SET ASIDE the assailed
Resolutions of the Court of Appeals. We DECLAR E the Airport
Lands and Buildings of the Manila International Airport
Authority EXEMPT from the real estate tax imposed by the
City of Paranaque. We declare VOID all the real estate tax
assessments, including the final notices of real estate tax
delinquencies, issued by the City of Paranaque on the Airport
Lands and Buildings of the MIAA , except for the portions
that the Manila International Airport Authority has leased
to private parties. We also declare VOID the assailed auction
sale, and all its effects, of the Airport Lands and Buildings of
theMIAA .
(Note: The ruling in this case was reiterated in MIAA v.
City of Pasay, 583 SCRA 234 [2009] involving airport lands
and buildings located in Pasay City.)

or lease the light rail transit system of the country. For this
purpose, the LRTA acquired real properties and commenced
its operations in 1984.
Ruling: The LRTA bears the elemental characteristics
of a government instrumentality vested with corporate
powers. Consider:
One. The vesture of its corporate powers is found in
Article 2 of Executive Order 603 otherwise known as "Creating
a Light Rail Transit Authority, Vesting the same with Authority
to Construct and Operate the Light Rail Transit (LRT) project
and providing funds therefor,"
Two. The LRTA performs governmental functions.
It is primarily responsible for the construction, operation,
maintenance, and/or lease of light rail transit systems in the
country, giving due regard to the reasonable requirements of
the public transportation system of the country. As explained
in more detail below, the LRTA's functions are less commercial
than governmental, and more for public use and public welfare
than for profit-oriented services.
Three. The LRTA also enjoys operational autonomy,
as it ex.ists by virtue of a Charter, and its powers and functions
are vested in and exercised by its Board of Directors.
In sum, a government instrumentality though vested
with corporate powers are exempt from real property tax,
but the exemption shall not extend to taxable private entities
to whom the beneficial use of the government instrumentality's
properties has been vested.
Government entities falling under this category are
exempt from real property tax under Subsection 133 (0) of the
Code.

beneficial use of the government instrumentality's properties has

powers, such as the PHC. Indeed, it would be the height of absurdity
to levy the PHC's properties to answer for taxes the PHC does
not owe. This leaves the Quezon City Government with only one
recourse-judicial action for collection of real property taxes against
private individuals with beneficial use of the PH C's properties.

PHILIPPINE HEART CENTER v, THE LOCAL
GOVERNMENT OF QUEZON CITY
G.R. No. 225409, March 11, 2020, Lazaro-Javier, J.
Facts: In 1975, the Philippine Heart Center (PHC) was
established under Presidential Decree 6733 (PD 673) as a
specialty hospital mandated to provide expert comprehensive
cardiovascular care to the general public, especially the poor
and less fortunate in life.
The Quezon City Government, nonetheless, stood firm
on its position that the PH C was and still remained liable for
real property taxes since a major portion of its properties were
being leased to private individuals. Thus, on June 1, 2001, it
issued two (2) Final Notices of Tax Delinquency to the PHC.
On June 13, 2011, respondent Quezon City Treasurer issued a
Warrant of Levy for the PH C's failure to pay real property taxes
despite due notice. On July 7, 2011, after due publication, all
the properties were sold to the Quezon City Government, the
lone bidder during the public auction.

Ruling: Section 133(0) recognizes the basic principle that
local governments cannot tax the national government, which
historically merely delegated to local governments the power to
tax. While the 1987 Constitution now includes taxation as one
of the powers of local governments, local governments may only
exercise such power "subject to such guidelines and limitations
as the Congress may provide."
Section 234(a) of RA 7160 further exempts real property
owned by the Republic from real property taxes.
The Republic and its instrumentalities including the
PHC retain their exempt status despite leasing out their
properties to private individuals. The fact that PHC was short
of alienating its properties to private parties in relation to the
establishment, operation, maintenance and viability of a fully
functional specialized hospital, does not divest them of their
exemption from levy; the properties only lost the exemption

from being taxed, but they did not lose their exemption from
the means to collect such taxes.
Otherwise stated, local government units are precluded
from availing of the remedy of levy and sale at public auction
against properties owned by government instrumentalities,
whether or not vested with corporate powers, such as the PHC.
Indeed, it would be the height of absurdity to levy the PHC's
properties to answer for taxes the PH C does not owe. This
leaves the Quezon City Government with only one recourse
- judicial action for collection of real property taxes against
private individuals with beneficial use of the PH C's properties.
ACCORDINGLY, the petition is GRAN TED. The Court
of Appeals' Decision and Resolution are REVERSED and SET
ASIDE.

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

356

Held: It might be well to recall that local governments
do not have the inherent power to tax except to the extent
that such power might be delegated to them either by the
basic law or by statute. Presently, under Article X of the 1987
Constitution, a general delegation of that power has been given
in favor oflocal government units.
The 1991 Code explicitly authorizes provincial governments,
notwithstanding "any exemption granted by any law or other
special Jaw, ... (to) impose a tax on businesses enjoying a
franchise. (Sec. 137, LG.C.)
Under Sec. 193, the Local Government Code has effectively
withdrawn tax exemptions or incentives theretofore enjoyed by
certain entities.
The Code, in addition, contains a general repealing clause
in Section 534. PD 551 is thus repealed.
WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED.
SEC. 138. Tax on Sand, Gravel and Other
Quarry Resources. - The province may levy and
collect not more than ten percent (10%) of fair
market value in the locality per cubic meter of
ordinary stones, sand, gravel, earth, and other
quarry resources, as defined under the National
Internal Revenue Code, as amended, extracted
from public lands or from the beds of seas, lakes,
rivers, streams, creeks, and other public waters
within its territorial jurisdiction.
The permit to extract sand, gravel, and other
quarry resources shall be issued exclusively by the
provincial governor, pursuant to the ordinance of
the sangguniang panlalawigan.
The proceeds of the tax on sand, gravel, and
other quarry resources shall be distributed as
follows:
(1)

Province Thirty percent (30%);

(2) Component City of Municipality
where the sand, gravel, and other quarry
resources are Extracted - Thirty percent
(30%); and

Forty percent (40%).
A.

Decided Case

1.
A province has no authority to impose taxes on stones,
sand, gravel, earth, and other quarry resources extracted from
private lands.
PROVINCE OF BULACAN v. CA
299 SCRA 442, November 27, 1998, Romero, J.
Facts: Section 21 of"An Ordinance Enacting the Revenue
Code of the Bulacan Province" provides as follows: Imposition
of Tax. - There is hereby levied and collected a tax of 10% of
the fair market value in the locality per cubic meter of ordinary
stones, sand, gravel, earth and other quarry resources, such
but not limited to marble, granite, volcanic cinders, basalt, tuff
and rock phosphate, extracted from public lands or from beds
of seas, lakes, rivers, streams, creeks and other public waters
within its territorial jurisdiction."
Pursuant thereto, the Provincial Treasurer of Bulacan
assessed private respondent Republic Cement Corporation
for extracting limestone, shale and silica from several parcels
of private land in the province. Republic Cement formally
contested the same which was denied by the Provincial
Treasurer.
Held: The Court of Appeals erred in ruling that a
province can impose only the taxes specifically mentioned
under the Local Government Code. As correctly pointed out by
petitioners, Section 186 allows a province to levy taxes other
than those specifically enumerated under the Code, subject to
the conditions specified therein.
This finding, nevertheless, affords cold comfort to
petitioners as they are still prohibited from imposing taxes on
stones, sand, gravel, earth and other quarry resources extracted
from private lands. The tax imposed by the Province of Bulacan
is an excise tax, being a tax upon the performance, carrying on,
or exercise of an activity. A province may not, under Section
133 of Local Government Code, levy excise taxes on articles
already taxed by the National Internal Revenue Code.

358

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

It is clearly apparent from Section 151 of the NIRC
that the National Internal Revenue Code levies a tax on all
quarry resources, regardless of origin, whether extracted from
public or private land. Thus, a province may not ordinarily
impose taxes on stones, sand, gravel, earth and other quarry
resources, as the same are already taxed under the National
Internal Revenue Code. The province can, however, impose a
tax on stones, sand, gravel, earth and other quarry resources
extracted from public land because it is expressly empowered
to do so under the Local Government Code. As to stones, sand,
gravel, earth and other quarry resources extracted from private
land, however, it may not to do so, because of the limitation
provided by Section 133 of the Code in relation to Section 151
of the National Internal Revenue Code.
Given the above disquisition, petitioners cannot claim
that the appellate court unjustly deprived them of the power
to create their sources of revenue, their assessment of taxes
against Republic Cement being ultra vires, traversing as it
does the limitations set by the Local Government Code.
2.
Here, the tax is an excise tax imposed on the privilege
of extracting sand and gravel. And it is settled that provincial
governments can levy excise taxes on quarry resources independently
from the national government.

LEPANTO CONSOLIDATED MINING COMPANY v.
AMBANLOC
622 SCRA 229, June 29, 2010, Abad, J.
Facts: The national government issued to petitioner
Lepanto Consolidated Mining Company (Lepanto) a mining
lease contract covering, among others, its "TIKEM" leased
mining claim at Sitio Nayak, Barrio Palasan (Suy0c),
Municipality of Mankayan, Benguet. The contract granted
Lepanto the right to extract and use for its purposes all
mineral deposits within the boundary lines of its mining claim.
Upon inquiry, the Mines and Geo-sciences Bureau of the
Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)
advised Lepanto that, under its contract, it did not have to
get a permit to extract and use sand and gravel from within
the mining claim for its operational and infrastructure needs.
Based on this advice, Lepanto proceeded to extract and remove
sand, gravel, and other earth materials from the mining site.

Book II Loc al Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One Loc al Government Taxation

359

Lepanto used the quarried materials to back-fill stopesportions of the earth excavated as a result of mining-replacing
what had been mined to maintain the integrity of the ground.
It also used sand and gravel to construct and maintain concrete
structures needed in its mining operation, such as a tailings
dam, access roads, and offices. Its use of quarry resources,
readily available within its mining claim, was more practical
and cheaper than having to outsource them.
Respondent Mauricio Ambanloc, the provincial treasurer
of Benguet, sent a demand letter to Lepanto, asking it to pay the
province P1,901,893.22 as sand and gravel tax, for the quarry
materials that it extracted from its mining site from 1997 to
2000. Lepanto sent a letter-protest to the provincial treasurer,
but the latter denied the same, insisting on payment.
Ruling: Lepanto claims that the tax on sand and gravel
applied only to commercial extractions. In its case, it extracted
these materials for use solely in its mining operations. Lepanto
did not supply other users for some profit. Thus, its extractions
were not commercial and should not be subject to provincial
tax.
The question of Lepanto's liability for tax should be
determined based on the revenue measure itself, which in this
case, was the Revised Benguet Revenue Code (the revenue
code). The relevant provisions of this provincial revenue code
reads:
"Article D. Tax on Sand, Gravel and Other Quarry
Resources.
XXX

SECTION 3. Imposition of Tax. - There shall be
levied a tax of ten (10) percent of fair market value in the
locality per cubic meter of ordinary stones, sand, gravel,
earth, and other quarry resources, x x x applied for and
expected to be extracted or removed from public lands x x x
within the territorial jurisdiction of Benguet Province.
This provision may not apply in case of gratuitous
permits for government projects within Benguet
Province."

only commercial extractions since the provincial revenue code
referred to "fair market value of the resources," "quantity sold
or disposed," "amount left in stock," "selling price," and "buyers'
information."

no right to conduct his quarrying operations within the Permit Area.
Consequently, he is not entitled to any injunction.

Not necessarily. The provincial revenue code provides
that the subject tax had to be paid prior to the issuance of
the permit to extract sand and gravel. Its Article D, Section
2, enumerates four kinds of permits: commercial, industrial,
special, and gratuitous. Special permits covered only personal
use of the extracted materials and did not allow the permitees
to sell materials coming from his concession. Among applicants
for permits, however, only gratuitous permits were exempt
from the sand and gravel tax. It follows that persons who
applied for special permits needed to pay the tax, even though
they did not extract materials for commercial purposes. Thus,
the tax needed to be paid regardless of the applicability of the
administrative and reportorial requirements of that revenue
code.

Facts: On September 14, 2007, Joseph Lara obtained
an Industrial Sand and Gravel Permit (ISAG Permit) from
the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) of the DENR,
authorizing him to conduct quarrying operations in a twentyhectare area situated in Barangay Centro, Muncipality of
Peiiablanca, Cagayan (Permit Area) and extract and dispose
of sand, gravel, and other unconsolidated materials from
the Permit Area. For the same purpose, Lara obtained an
Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) from the DENR
Environmental Management Bureau (EMB).

Lepanto relies on the principle that when a company is
taxed on its main business, it is no longer taxable for engaging
in an activity that is but a part of, incidental to, and necessary
to such main business. Lepanto points out that, since it did
not extract and use sand and gravel as independent activities
but as integral parts of its mining operations, it should not be
subjected to a separate tax on the same.
But in the cases where this principle has been applied,
the taxes which were stricken down were in the nature of
business taxes. The reasoning behind those cases was that the
incidental activity could not be treated as a business separate
and distinct from the main business of the taxpayer. Here the
tax is an excise tax imposed on the privilege of extracting sand
and gravel. And it is settled that provincial governments can
levy excise taxes on quarry resources independently from the
national government.
The Court DENIES the petition and AFFIRMS the
decision of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc.

A governor's permit is a pre-requisite before one can
engage in a quarrying business in Cagayan. Records, however,
reveal that Lara admittedly failed to secure the same; hence, he has

On January 3, 2008, Jovy Balisi (Balisi), Lara's
representative, went to the Cagayan Provincial Treasurer's
Office (Treasurer's Office) to pay the extraction fee and other
fees for Lara's quarrying operations but she was directed to
first secure an Order of Payment from the Environmental and
Natural Resources Officer, petitioner Robert Adap (ENRO
Adap). However, when Balisi went to ENRO Adap, the latter
refused to issue an Order of Payment. Despite various pleas
from Balisi and Atty. Victoria N. Casauay (Atty. Casauay),
Lara's counsel, ENRO Adap remained adamant with his
refusal.
Lara commenced his quarryin g operations. Governor
Alvaro Antonio issued a Stoppage Order. Lara filed an Action
for Injunction against the officials of the Province of Cagayan.

Ruling: In order for an entity to legally undertake
a quarrying business, he must first comply with all the
requirements imposed not only by the national government,
but also by the local government unit where his business is
situated. Particularly, Section 138(2) of RA 7160 requires that
such entity must first secure a governor's permit prior to the
start of his quarryin g operations, viz.:

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

The permit to extract sand, gravel and other quarry
resources shall be issued exclusively by the provincial governor,
pursuant to the ordinance of the sangguniang panlalawigan.
In connection thereto, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan
of Cagayan promulgated Provincial Ordinance No. 2005-07,
Article H, Section 2H.04 of which provides:
SECTION 2H.04. Permit for Gravel and Sand
Extraction and Quarrying. - No person shall extract
ordinary stones, gravel, earth, boulders and quarry
resources from public lands or from the beds of seas,
rivers, streams, creeks or other public waters unless a
permit has been issued by the Governor (or his deputy as
provided herein) x x x
A plain reading of the afore-cited provisions clearly shows
that a governor's permit is a pre-requisite before one can engage
in a quarrying business in Cagayan. Records, however, reveal
that Lara admittedly failed to secure the same; hence, he has
no right to conduct his quarrying operations within the Permit
Area. Consequently, he is not entitled to any injunction.
The petition is GRANTED. Accordingly, the Decision of
the RTC of Tuguegarao City, Cagayan, is hereby REVERSED
and SET ASIDE.
SEC. 139. Professional Tax. (a) The province
may levy an annual professional tax on each person
engaged in the exercise or practice of his profession
requiring government examination at such amount
and reasonable classification as the sangguniang
panlalawigan may determine but shall in no case
exceed Three hundred pesos (P300.00).
(b) Every person legally authorized to
practice his profession shall pay the professional
tax to the province where he practices his
profession or where he maintains his principal
office in case he practices his profession in several
places: Provided, however, That such person who
has paid the corresponding professional tax shall
be entitled to practice his profession in any part
of the Philippines without being subjected to any

other national or local tax, license, or fee for the
practice of such profession.
(c) Any individual or corporation employing
a person subject to professional tax shall require
payment by that person of the tax on his profession
before employment and annually thereafter.
(d) The professional tax shall be payable
annually, on or before the thirty-first (31st) day of
January. Any person first beginning to practice
a profession after the month of January must,
however, pay the full tax before engaging therein.
A line of profession does not become exempt even
if conducted with some other profession for which
the tax has been paid. Professionals exclusively
employed in the government shall be exempt from
the payment of this tax.
(e) Any person subject to the professional tax
shall write in deeds, receipts, prescriptions, reports,
books of account, plans and designs, surveys and
maps, as the case may be, the number of the official
receipt issued to him.
SEC. 140. Amusement Tax.
(a) The province
may levy an amusement tax to be collected from
the proprietors, lessees, or operators of theaters,
cinemas, concert halls, circuses, boxing stadia, and
other places of amusement at a rate of not more
than thirty percent (30%) of the gross receipts from
admission fees.
(b) In the case of theaters or cinemas,
the tax shall first be deducted and withheld by
their proprietors, lessees, or operators and the
distributors of the cinematographic films.
(c) The holding of operas, concerts, dramas,
recitals, painting and art exhibitions, flower
shows, musical programs, literary and oratorical
presentations, except pop, rock, or similar concerts
shall be exempt from the payment of the tax herein
imposed.
(d) The sangguniang panlalawigan may

for the payment of tax. In case of fraud or failure
to pay the tax, the sangguniang panlalawigan may

it may deem appropriate.
(e) The proceeds from the amusement tax
shall he shared equally by the province and the
municipality where such amusement places are

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One - Local Government Taxation

365

Ruling: On October 10, 1991, the LGC of 1991 was
passed into law. The local government retained the power to
impose amusement tax on proprietors, lessees, or operators of
theaters, cinemas, concert halls, circuses, boxing stadia, and
other places of amusement at a rate of not more than thirty
percent (30%) of the gross receipts from admission fees under
Section 140 thereof. In the case of theaters or cinemas the
tax shall first be deducted and withheld by their proprietors,
lessees, or operators and paid to the local government before
the gross receipts are divided between said proprietors, lessees,
or operators and the distributors of the cinematographic
films. However, the provision in the Local Tax Code expressly
excluding the national government from collecting tax from the
proprietors, lessees, or operators of theaters, cinematographs,
concert halls, circuses and other places of amusements was no
longer included.
These reveal the legislative intent not to impose VAT on
persons already covered by the amusement tax.
To hold otherwise would impose an unreasonable burden
on cinema/theater houses operators or proprietors, who would
be paying an additional 10% VAT on top of the 30% amusement
tax imposed by Section 140 of the LGC of 1991, or a total of
40% tax.
The repeal of the Local Tax Code by the LGC of 1991
is not a legal basis for the imposition of VAT on the gross
receipts of cinema/theater operators or proprietors derived
from admission tickets. The removal of the prohibition under
the Local Tax Code did not grant nor restore to the national
government the power to impose amusement tax on cinema/
theater operators or proprietors.
Considering that there is no provision oflaw imposing VAT
on the gross receipts of cinema/theater operators or proprietors
derived from admission tickets, Revenue Memorandum
Circular RMC No. 28-2001 of BIR which imposes VAT on the
gross receipts from admission to cinema houses must be struck
down. We cannot overemphasize that RM Cs must not override
supplant, or modify the law, but must remain consistent and
in harmony with, the law they seek to apply and implement.

Resorts, swimming pools, bath houses, hot springs, and
tourist spots do not belong to the same category or class as theaters,
cinemas, concert halls, circuses, and boxing stadia where one seeks
admission to entertain oneself by seeing or viewing the show or
performances. It follows that they cannot be considered as among
the 'other places of amusement' contemplated by Section 140 of the
LGC and which may properly be subject to amusement taxes.

PELIZLOY REALTY CORPORATION v. THE
PROVINCE OF BENGUET
695 SCRA 491, April 10, 2013, Leonen, J.
Facts: Petitioner Pelizloy Realty Corporation owns Palm
Grove Resort, which is designed for recreation and which has
facilities like swimming pools, a spa and function halls. It is
located at Asin, Angalisan, Municipality of Tuba, Province of
Benguet.
On December 8, 2005, the Provincial Board of the Province
of Benguet approved Provincial Tax Ordinance No. 05-107,
otherwise known as the Benguet Revenue Code of 2005 Section
59, Article X of the Tax Ordinance levied a ten percent (10%)
amusement tax on gross receipts from admissions to "resorts,
swimming pools, bath houses, hot springs and tourist spots."

Ruling: The Court need not embark on a laborious effort
at statutory construction. Section 131(c) of the LGC already
provides a clear definition of 'amusement places':
(c) "Amusement Places" include theaters, cinemas,
concert halls, circuses and other places of amusement
where one seeks admission to entertain oneself by seeing
or viewing the show or performances,
Indeed, theaters, cinemas, concert halls, circuses, and
boxing stadia are bound by a common typifying characteristic in
that they are all venues primarily for the staging of spectacles
or the holding of public shows, exhibitions, performances, and
other events meant to be viewed by an audience. Accordingly,
'other places of amusement' must be interpreted in light of
the typifying characteristic of being venues "where one seeks
admission to entertain oneself by seeing or viewing the show
or performances" or being venues primarily used to stage
spectacles or hold public shows, exhibitions, performances, and
other events meant to be viewed by an audience.

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One -- Local Government Taxation

367

Considering these, it is clear that resorts, swimming pools,
bath houses, hot springs and tourist spots cannot be considered
venues primarily "where one seeks admission to entertain
oneself by seeing or viewing the show or performances." While
it is true that they may be venues where people are visually
engaged, they are not primarily venues for their proprietors
or operators to actively display, stage or present shows and/or
performances.
Thus, resorts, swimming pools, bath houses, hot springs
and tourist spots do not belong to the same category or class as
theaters, cinemas, concert halls, circuses, and boxing stadia.
It follows that they cannot be considered as among the 'other
places of amusement' contemplated by Section 140 of the LGC
and which may properly be subject to amusement taxes.
The petition for review on certiorari is GRANT ED.
3.
Under Section 14 of R.A. No. 9167, the income from the
amusement taxes levied by the covered LG Us did not and will under
no circumstance accrue to them, not even partially, despite being
the taxing authority therefor but will instead be given to producers
of graded films. Congress, therefore, clearly overstepped its plenary
legislative power, the amendment being violative of the fundamental
law's guarantee on local autonomy, as echoed in Section 130(d) of
the LGC.

require proprietors, lessees or operators of theatres, cinemas,
concert halls, circuses, boxing stadia, and other places of
amusement, to pay an amusement tax equivalent to thirty
percent (30%) of the gross receipts of admission fees to the

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Almost a decade later, or on June 7, 2002, Congress
passed RA 9167, creating the Film Development Council (q]f
the Philippines (FDCP) and abolishing the Film Development
Foundation of the Philippines, Inc. and the Film Rating Board.
Secs. 13 and 14 of RA 9167 provided for the tax treatment of
certain graded films as follows:
1.
Under Section 13: A grade "A" or "B" flm shall
entitle its producer to an Incentive equivalent to the
amusement tax imposed and collected on the graded films
by cities and municipalities in Metro Manila and other
highly urbanized and independent component cities in the
Philippines pursuant to Sections 140 to 151 of Republic
Act No. 7160 at the following rates:
1.
For grade "A" films - 100% of the
amusement tax collected on such film; and
2.
For grade "B" films - 65% of the amusement
tax collected on such films. The remaining thirtyfive (35%) shall accrue to the funds of the Council.
2.
Section 14: [- ]All revenue from the amusement
tax on the graded film x x x shall be deducted and
withheld by the proprietors, operators or lessees of
theaters or cinemas and remitted within thirty (30) days
from the termination of the exhibition to the Council
which shall reward the corresponding amusement tax to
the producers of the graded film within fifteen (15) days
from receipt thereof. Proprietors, operators and lessees of
theaters or cinemas who fail to remit the amusement tax
proceeds within the prescribed period shall be liable to a
surcharge equivalent to five percent (5%) of the amount
due for each month of delinquency which shall be paid to
the Council.
In said letters, the proprietors and cinema operators,
including private respondent Colon Heritage Realty Corp.
(Colon Heritage), operator of the Oriente theater, were given
ten (10) days from receipt thereof to pay the aforestated
amounts to FDCP.

Ruling: It is in the application of the adverted fourth
rule, Sec. 130 (d), LGC, that is-all revenue collected pursuant
to the provisions of the LGC shall inure solely to the benefit of,

and be subject to the disposition by, the LGU levying the tax,
fee, charge or other imposition unless otherwise specifically
provided by the LGC-upon which the present controversy grew.
In the case at bar, through the application and enforcement
of Sec. 14 of RA 9167, the income from the amusement
taxes levied by the covered LGUs did not and will under no
circumstance accrue to them, not even partially, despite being
the taxing authority therefor. Congress, therefore, clearly
overstepped its plenary legislative power, the amendment
being violative of the fundamental law's guarantee on local
autonomy, as echoed in Sec. 130(d) of the LGC.
It was argued that subject Sec. 13 of RA 9167 is a grant
by Congress of an exemption from amusement taxes in favor of
producers of graded films.
Both the burden and incidence of the amusement tax
are borne by the proprietors, lessors, and operators, not by
the producers of the graded films. The transfer of the amount
to the film producers is actually a monetary reward given to
them for having produced a graded film, the funding for which
was taken by the national government from the coffers of the
covered LGUs. Without a doubt, this is not an exemption from
payment of tax.
Judgment is hereby rendered in favor of Colon Heritage
Realty Corp. and against the Film Development council of the
Philippines, declaring Sections 13 and 14 of Republic Act No.
9167otherwise known as an Act Creating the Film Development
Council of the Philippines as invalid and unconstitutional.

Comments

1.
There being no showing, as the evidence does not show,
that the rate of the municipal taxes therein provided is excessive,
unjust, oppressive and confiscatory, their validity and legality must
be upheld. The rate of the taxes in both ordinances, to wit: P1,000
a year for "Class A Cinematographs having orchestra, balcony and
lodge seats" in Ordinance No. 61, series of 1946, and P2,000 for each
theater or cinematograph with gross annual receipts amounting to
P130,000, or more in Ordinance No. 10, series of 1947, under which
the "Cine Concepcion" falls, is not excessive but fair and just. It is
far from being oppressive and confiscatory. (Santos u. Aquino, 94
Phil. 65.)
2.
This Court will go slow in writing off an ordinance as
unreasonable unless the amount is so excessive as to be prohibitive.

Article Two. - Municipalities

Boo k II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One Local Government Taxation

Decided Case

1.
Under the Local Government Code of 1991, a municipality
is bereft of authority to levy and impose franchise tax on franchise
holders within its territorial jurisdiction. That authority belongs to
provinces and cities only. A franchise tax levied by a municipality
is, thus, null and void. The nullity is not cured by the subsequent
conversion of the municipality into a city.

By virtue of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7829, which took effect
on 25 January 1995, the Municipality of Pasig was converted
into a highly urbanized city to be known as the City of Pasig.
On 24 August 2001, the Treasurer's Office of the City
Government of Pasig informed the Manila Electric Company
(MERALCO), a grantee of a legislative franchise, that it is
liable to pay taxes for the period 1996 to 1999, pursuant to
Municipal Ordinance No. 25. The city, thereafter, on two
separate occasions, demanded payment of the said tax in the
amount of P435,332, 196.00, exclusive of penalties.
On 8 February 2002, MERAL CO protested.
Ruling: The power to impose franchise tax belongs to
the province by virtue of Section 137 of the LGC. On the other
hand, the municipalities are prohibited from levying the taxes
specifically allocated to provinces under Section 142 of the
LGC. Section 151 empowers the cities to levy taxes, fees and
charges allowed to both provinces and municipalities.
It is not disputed that at the time the ordinance in question
was enacted in 1992, the local government of Pasig, then a
municipality, had no authority to levy franchise tax. Article
6 of the Civil Code explicitly provides, "acts executed against
the provisions of mandatory or prohibitory laws shall be void,
except when the law itself authorizes their validity." Section 32
of Municipal Ordinance No. 25 is, thus, void for being in direct
contravention with Section 142 of the LGC. Being void, it
cannot be given any legal effect. An assessment and collection
pursuant to the said ordinance is, perforce, legally infirm.
The petitioner cites Sec. 45 of R.A. No. 7829 as legal
basis that gave curative effect upon Section 32 of Municipal
Ordinance No. 25. The cited law does not lend any help to the
City of Pasig's cause. It is crystal clear from the said law that

372

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

what shall continue to be in force after the conversion of Pasig
into a city are the municipal ordinances existing as of the time
of the approval of R.A. No. 7829. The provision contemplates
ordinances that are valid and legal from their inception; that
upon the approval of R.A. No. 7829, their effectivity and
enforcement shall continue.
A void ordinance cannot legally exist, it cannot have
binding force and effect. Such is Section 32 of Municipal
Ordinance No. 25 and, being so, is outside the comprehension
of Section 45 of R.A. No. 7829.
The petition is DENIED for lack of merit.
SEC. 143. Tax on Business. The municipality
may impose taxes on the following businesses:
(a) On manufacturers, assemblers, repackers,
processors, brewers, distillers, rectifiers, and
compounders of liquors, distilled spirits, and wines

Decided Cases

1.
How location is determined for purposes of identifying
the LGU entitled to collect taxes. This Court holds that the location
stated in the certificate of title be followed until amended through
proper judicial proceedings. Uniwide must pay the applicable taxes
and fees to Pasig for the subject years; and Cainta must reimburse
to Uniwide the taxes that the latter paid for said period.
MUNICIPALITY OF CAINTA v. CITY OF PASIG
828 SCRA 257, June 28, 2017, Martires, J.
Facts: Petitioner Uniwide conducted and operated
business in buildings and establishments constructed on
parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 72983, 74003, and PT74468 issued by the Registry of Deeds of Pasig City. In said
TCTs, the location of the parcels of land is indicated as being
in Pasig.

In 1989, Uniwide applied for and was issued a building
permit by Pasig for its building. Uniwide also secured the
requisite Mayor's Permit for its business from Pasig and
consequently paid thereto its business and realty taxes, fees,
and other charges from 1989 to 1996.
However, beginning 1997, Uniwide did not file any
application for renewal of its Mayor's Permit in Pasig nor paid
the local taxes thereto. Instead, it paid local taxes to Cainta
after the latter gave it notice, supported by documentary proof
of its claims, that the subject properties were within Cainta's
territorial jurisdiction.
Consequently, Pasig filed a case for collection of local
business taxes, fees, and other legal charges due for fiscal year
1997 against Uniwide with the RTC-Pasig on 28 January 1997.

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One Local Government Taxation

381

Uniwide, in tum, filed a third-party complaint against Cainta
for reimbursement of the taxes, fees, and other charges it had
paid to the latter in the event that Uniwide was adjudged liable
for payment of taxes to Pasig.
Ruling: Under the Local Government Code, local business
taxes are payable for every separate or distinct establishment
or place where business subject to the tax is conducted, which
must be paid by the person conducting the same. Section 150
therein provides the situs of taxation, and Sections 201 and
247 of the LGC, provides for real property taxes.
Since it is clear that local business taxes and realty
taxes are to be collected by the local government unit where
the business is conducted or the real property is located,
the primordial question presented before this Court is: how
is location determined for purposes of identifying the LGU
entitled to collect taxes.
This Court holds that the location stated in the certificate
of title should be followed until amended through proper
judicial proceedings.
In the case at bar, it is undisputed that the subject
properties are covered by TCTs which show on their faces
that they are situated in Pasig; that Uniwide's business
establishment is situated within the subject properties; that
the stated location has remained unchanged since their
issuance; that prior payments of the subject taxes, fees, and
charges have been made by Uniwide to Pasig; and that there
is no court order directing the amendment of the subject TCTs
with regard to the location stated therein. This gives Pasig the
apparent right to levy and collect realty taxes on the subject
properties and business taxes on the businesses conducted
therein.
The evidence presented by Cainta (i.e., Cadastral Survey
and Maps, Certification from the DENR) to sustain its claim
that the subject properties fall within its territorial jurisdiction
are more properly submitted for the appreciation of the RTCAntipolo, where the boundary dispute case is pending.
Without the adjudication of the RTC-Antipolo finally
determining the precise territorial jurisdiction of these local
government units (LGU), these documents alone cannot
automatically effect a modification or amendment to the stated

382

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

location in the TCTs for the purpose of exacting tax compliance,
as the taxpayer is entitled to rely on the location clearly
reflected in the certificate of title covering the properties.
Uniwide must pay the applicable taxes and fees to Pasig
for the subject years; and Cainta must reimburse to Uniwide
the taxes that the latter paid for said period.

apportioned among Alilem, Bakun, and Makati, such that each
local government unit (LGU) received 23.33%--Alilem and
Bakun as power plant sites and Makati as a "project office"
site. It is the sharing in the 70% portion that became the bone
of contention among the three LG Us.
The CTA Special First Division issued a Decision 16 on
November 8, 2013, disposing:

The petition is DENIED.
2.
Makati would have been entitled to share with LHC's
power plant sites in the 70% portion of the business tax if it could
be shown that the Makati office was a project office of LHC akin
to a factory. The enumeration itself-factory project office, plant,
or plantation-reveals the character of the office contemplated by
the provision. These are offices directly involved in production or
operations; hence, the inescapable conclusion that LHC's Makati
office was a mere administrative office.
CITY OF MAKA TI v. MUNICIPALITY OF BAKUN
G.R. No. 225226, July 7, 2020, Reyes, J. Jr., J.
Facts: The case sprang from a special civil action for
interpleader under Rule 62, fled before the RTC of Makati
City, on January 16, 2007. Luzon Hydro Corporation (LHC)
sought to compel the City of Maka ti, the Municipality of Alilem,
and the Municipality of Bakun to litigate among themselves
their conflicting claims on LHC's liability for local business tax
under Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7160.
LHC operates a hydroelectric power plant harnessing
the Bakun River that runs through the Provinces of [!]locos
Sur and Benguet. The major components of the facility, such
as the power station and switch yard are situated in Alilem,
!locos Sur. Other structures, such as the conveyance tunnel,
penstock, weir, intakes, and desander are located in Bakun,
Benguet. LHC maintained an office in Makati City.
In 2004, LHC began paying local business taxes to
Alilem, Bakun, and Makati. LHC pays Alilem the 30% portion
of its local business tax allocated for the site of the principal
office, conformably with Section (Sec.) 150 of R.A. No. 7160,
given that Alilem is specified as the location of LHC's principal
office in its Articles of Incorporation. For three years since
2004, the 70% portion of the local business tax was equally

WHEREFORE, x x x The Municipalities of Bakun
and Alilem are hereby declared the only local government
units entitled to equally share in the 70% allocation made
by LHC for the payment of its local business [tax].
Concurri ng with its Special First Division's findings and
conclusion, the CTA En Banc affirmed the decision.
Ruling: In tackling what constitutes a project office, it
was not erroneous for the CTA to cite Department of FinanceLocal Finance Circular No. 3-9528 dated May 22, 1995. On the
situs of tax, Sec. 5(a)(3) of the said circular defines a project
office as "equivalent to the factory of a manufacturer." While the
circular concerned applies to construction contractors, it was
nonetheless addressed to all Treasurers of LG Us, clarifying the
imposition of business taxes under Sec. 143 of R.A. No. 7160 for
a uniform application. While the circular addressed a different
economic activity from that of hydroelectric power generation,
its definition of a project office is a sound guide for parity of
reasoning.
The subject tax is a tax on business, particularly one that
is expressly imposed on gross sales recorded. For this reason, it
was relevant to the CTA's discussion to consider that invoices
or records of all sales are not handled by LHC's Makati office,
nor does it operate any aspect or primary purpose of LI-IC (sic)
as provided in its Articles of Incorporation.
The rules on tax allocation in relation to tax situs under
Sec. 150 of R.A. No. 7160 come into play when a business
subject to it does not operate a branch or sales office outside
of its principal office where all sales are recorded, but has a
factory, project office, plant, or plantation situated in different
localities, whether or not sales are made in these localities.
Thus, even if no sales were recorded or undertaken at LHC's
Makati office, Makati would have been entitled to share with
LHC's power plant sites in the 70% portion of the business

tax if it could be shown that the Makati office was a project
office ofLHC akin to a factory. The enumeration itself-factory
project office, plant, or plantation-reveals the character of the
office contemplated by the provision. These are offices directly
involved in production or operations; hence, the inescapable
conclusion that LHC's Makati office was a mere administrative
office.

calendar year within the city. Pursuant thereto, the petitioner
City Treasurer sent to private respondent a letter demanding
payment of the aforesaid franchise tax from MERALCO.

Finding no reversible error in the Decision and the
Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc the instant

Held: The pivotal issue is whether the City of San Pablo
may impose[s] a local franchise tax pursuant to the LGC upon
the Manila Electric Company which pays a tax equal to two
percent of its gross receipts in lieu of all taxes and assessments
of whatever nature imposed by any national or local authority
on savings or income.

Tax on Franchises

1.
The City of San Pablo has the power to impose a local
franchise tax on MERAL CO under the Local Government Code.
CITY GOVERNMENT OF SAN PABLO,
LAGUNA v. REYES
305 SCRA 353, March 25, 1999, Gonzaga-Reyes, J.
Facts: On October 5, 1992, the Sangunniang Panglunsod
of San Pablo City enacted Ordinance No. 56, the Revenue Code
of the City of San Pablo imposing a tax on business enjoying
a franchise, at a rate of fifty percent (50%) of one percent
(1%) of the gross annual receipts, which shall include both
cash sales and sales on account realized during the preceding

The private respondent MERAL CO filed this action before
the RTC to declare Ordinance No. 56 null and void insofar as it
imposes the franchise tax upon MERAL CO and to claim for a
refund of the taxes paid.

Sec. 151 of the Local Government Code provides the scope
of taxing power of cities which states that the city, may levy the
taxes, fees and charges which the province or municipality may
impose, such as a franchise tax.
Sec. 193 of the Local Government Code has withdrawn
tax exemption privileges previously given to certain entities,
while Sec. 534 (f) contains a general repealing clause. It is
our view that petitioners correctly relied on the provisions of
Sections 137 and 193 of the LGC to support their position that
Meralco's tax exemption has been withdrawn.
In interpreting statutory provisions on municipal fiscal
powers, doubts will have to be resolved in favor of municipal
corporations.
Therefore, the City of San Pablo has the power to impose
a local franchise tax on MERAL CO.
2.
Section 23 of R.A. No. 7925 (Public Telecommunications
Policy Act) cannot be considered as having amended PLDT's
franchise so as to entitle it to exemption from the imposition of local
franchise taxes.
PLDT v. CITY OF DAVAO
G.R. No. 143867, August 22, 2001, Mendoza, J.
Facts: On January 1999, petitioner Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co., Inc. (PLDT) applied for a Mayor's
Permit to operate its Davao Metro Exchange. Respondent

386

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

City of Davao withheld action on the application pending
payment by petitioner of the local franchise tax in the amount
of P3,681,985.72 for the first to the fourth quarter of 1999. In a
letter dated May 31, 1999, petitioner protested the assessment
of the local franchise tax and requested a refund of the
franchise tax paid by it for the year 1997 and the first to the
third quarters of 1998.

Held: Petitioner cites R.A. No. 7925, otherwise known as
the "Public Telecommunications Policy Act of the Philippines,"
Section 23 of which reads:
"Section 23. Equality of Treatment in the
Telecommunications Industry. - Any advantage, favor,
privilege, exemption, or immunity granted under existing
franchises, or may hereafter be granted, shall ipso facto
become part of previously granted telecommunications
franchises and shall be accorded immediately and
unconditionally to the grantees of such franchises:
Provided, however, That the foregoing shall neither apply
to or affect provisions of telecommunications franchises
concerning territory covered by the franchise, the life
span of the franchise, or the type of service authorized by
the franchise."
Petitioner then claims that Smart and Globe enjoy
exemption from the payment of the franchise tax by virtue of
their legislative franchises per opinion of the Bureau of Local
Government Finance of the Department of Finance. Finally,
it argues that because Smart and Globe are exempt from the
franchise tax, it follows that it must likewise be exempt from
the tax being collected by the City of Davao because the grant
of tax exemption to Smart and Globe ipso facto extended the
same exemption to it.
R.A. No. 7925 is a legislative enactment designed to set
the national policy on telecommunications and provide the
structures to implement it to keep up with the technological
advances in the industry and the needs of the public. There
is nothing in the language of Sec. 23 nor in the proceedings of
both the House of Representatives and the Senate in enacting
R.A. No. 7925 which shows that it contemplates the grant of
tax exemptions to all telecommunications entities, including
those whose exemptions had been withdrawn by the LGC
under Secs. 137 and 193.

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One - Local Government Taxation

387

In this case, the word "exemption" in Sec. 23 of R.A. No.
7925 could contemplate exemption from certain regulatory or
reporting requirements, bearing in mind the policy of the law.
It is noteworthy that, in holding Smart and Globe exempt from
local taxes, the BLGF did not base its opinion on Sec. 23 but on
the fact that the franchises granted to them after the effectivity
of the LGC exempted them from the payment of local franchise
and business taxes.
In the case of petitioner, the BLGF opined that Sec. 23
of R.A. No. 7925 amended the franchise of petitioner and in
effect restored its exemptions from local taxes. Petitioner
contends that courts should not set aside conclusions reached
by the Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF) because
its function is precisely the study of local tax problems and it
has necessarily developed an expertise on the subject.
The BLGF was created merely to provide consultative
services and technical assistance to local governments and the
general public on local taxation, real property assessment, and
other related matters, among others. The question raised by
petitioner is a legal question, to wit, the interpretation of Sec.
23 of R.A. No. 7925. There is, therefore, no basis for claiming
expertise for the BLGF that administrative agencies are said
to possess in their respective fields.
In sum, it does not appear that, in approving Sec. 23 of
R.A. No. 7925, Congress intended it to operate as a blanket
tax exemption to all telecommunications entities. Applying the
rule of strict construction of laws granting tax exemptions and
the rule that doubts should be resolved in favor of municipal
corporations in interpreting statutory provisions on municipal
taxing powers, we hold that Sec. 23 of R.A. No. 7925 cannot be
considered as having amended petitioner's franchise so as to
entitle it to exemption from the imposition of local franchise
taxes.
We hold that the petitioner is liable to pay local franchise
taxes in the amount of P3,681,985.72 for the period covering
the first to the fourth quarter of 1999 and that it is not entitled
to a refund of taxes paid by it for the period covering the first to
the third quarter of 1998.

Section 137 of the LGC clearly states that the LG Us can
impose franchise tax "notwithstanding any exemption granted by
any law or other special law." This particular provision of the LGC
does not admit any exception.

NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v.
CITY OF CABANATUAN
401 SCRA 259, April 9, 2003, Puno, J.
Facts: Pursuant to section 37 of Ordinance No. 165-92,
the respondent City of Cabanatuan assessed the petitioner
National Power Corporation a franchise tax amounting to
P808,606.41, representing 75% of 1% of the latter's gross
receipts for the preceding year.
Petitioner, whose capital stock was subscribed and paid
wholly by the Philippine Government, refused to pay the tax
assessment. It argued that the respondent has no authority to
impose tax on government entities. Petitioner also contended
that as a non-profit organization, it is exempted from the
payment of all forms of taxes, charges, duties or fees in
accordance with sec. 13 of Rep. Act No. 6395, as amended.

Ruling: Section 137 of the LGC clearly states that
the LGUs can impose franchise tax "notwithstanding any
exemption granted by any law or other special lao." 'This
particular provision of the LGC does not admit any exception.
In City Government of San Pablo, Laguna v. Reyes, 305
SCRA 353 (1999) MERALCO's exemption from the payment
of franchise taxes was brought as an issue before this Court.
The same issue was involved in the subsequent case of Manila
Electric Company v. Province of Laguna, 306 SCRA 750 (1999).
Ruling in favor of the local government in both instances, we
ruled that the franchise tax in question is imposable despite
any exemption enjoyed by MERAL CO under special laws.
It is worth mentioning that section 192 of the LGC
empowers the LGUs, through ordinances duly approved, to
grant tax exemptions, initiatives or reliefs. But in enacting
section 37 of Ordinance No. 165-92 which imposes an annual
franchise tax "notwithstanding any exemption granted by law
or other special law," the respondent city government clearly
did not intend to exempt the petitioner from the coverage
thereof.

CASURECO III can no longer invoke P.D. No. 269 to
evade payment of local taxes. The situs of taxation is the City of
Iriga, where CASURECO III has its principal office and from where
it operates, regardless of the place where its services or products are
delivered. Hence, franchise tax covers all gross receipts from Iriga
City and the Rinconada area.

CITY OF IRIGA v. CAMARINES SUR III
ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE, INC.
680 SCRA 236, September 5, 2012, Perlas-Bernabe, J.
Facts: CASURECO III is an electric cooperative duly
organized and existing by virtue of Presidential Decree PD) 269,
as amended, and registered with the National Electrification
Administration (NEA). It is engaged in the business of electric
power distribution to various end-users and consumers within
the City of Iriga and the municipalities of Nabua, Bato, Baao,
Buhi, Bula and Balatan of the Province of Camarines Sur,
otherwise known as the "Rinconada area."
On January 7, 2004, petitioner City of Iriga made a final
demand on CASURECO III to pay the franchise taxes due
for the period 1998-2003 and real property taxes due for the
period 1995-2003.

Ruling: PD 269, which took effect on August 6, 1973,
granted electric cooperatives registered with the NEA,
like CASURECO III, several tax privileges, one of which is
exemption from the payment of"all national government, local
government and municipal taxes and fees, including franchise,
fling, recordation, license or permit fees or taxes."
On March 10, 1990, Congress enacted into law RA 6938,
otherwise known as the "Cooperative Code of the Philippines,"
and RA 6939 creating the CDA. The latter law vested the power
to register cooperatives solely on the CDA, while the former

390

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

provides that electric cooperatives registered with the NEA
under PD 269 which opt not to register with the CDA shall not
be entitled to the benefits and privileges under the said law.
On January 1, 1992, the LGC took effect, and Section
193 thereof withdrew tax exemptions or incentives previously
enjoyed by "all persons, whether natural or juridical, including
government-owned or controlled corporations, except local
water districts, cooperatives duly registered under R.A. No.
6938, non-stock and non-profit hospitals and educational
institutions."
In Philippine Rural Electric Cooperatives Association,
Inc. (PHILRECA) v. The Secretary, Department of Interior and
Local Government, 403 SCRA 558 (2003) the Court held that
the tax privileges granted to electric cooperatives registered
with NEA under PD 269 were validly withdrawn and only
those registered with the CDA under RA 6938 may continue to
enjoy the tax privileges under the Cooperative Code.

Tax On Business

1.
We hold that condominium corporations are generally
exempt from local business taxation under the Local Government
Code, irrespective of any local ordinance that seeks to declare
otherwise.

YAMANE v. BA LEPANTO CONDOMINIUM
CORPORATION
474 SCRA 258, October 25, 2005, Tinga, J.

The LGC was enacted granting the local government
units, like petitioner, the power to impose and collect franchise
tax, under SEC. 137. (Franchise Tax) and SEC. 151. (Scope of
Taxing Powers).

Facts: Respondent BA-Lepanto Condominium Corporation
(the "Corporation") owns and holds title to the common and
limited common areas of the BA-Lepanto Condominium (the
"Condominium"), situated in Paseo de Roxas, Makati City.
Its membership comprises the various unit owners of the
Condominium. The Corporation is authorized, under Article V
of its Amended By-Laws, to collect regular assessments from
its members for operating expenses, capital expenditures on
the common areas, and other special assessments as provided
for in the Master Deed with Declaration of Restrictions of the
Condominium.

Thus, to be liable for local franchise tax, the following
requisites should concur: (1) that one has a "franchise" in the
sense of a secondary or special franchise; and (2) that it is
exercising its rights or privileges under this franchise within
the territory of the pertinent local government unit.

On 15 December 1998, the Corporation received a Notice
of Assessment signed by Luz Yamane, City Treasurer of Makati
City. The Notice of Assessment stated that the Corporation is
"liable to pay the correct city business taxes, fees and charges,"
computed as totaling P1,601,013.77 for the years 1995 to 1997.

There is a confluence of these requirements in the case
at bar. By virtue of PD 269, NEA granted CASURECO III a
franchise to operate an electric light and power service for a
period offifty (50) years from June 6, 1979, and it is undisputed
that CASURECO III operates within Iriga City and the
Rinconada area. It is, therefore, liable to pay franchise tax
notwithstanding its non-profit nature.

Ruling: Section 143 of the Code specifically enumerates
several types of business on which municipalities and cities
may impose taxes. These include manufacturers, wholesalers,
distributors, dealers of any article of commerce of whatever
nature; those engaged in the export or commerce of essential
commodities; contractors and other independent contractors;
banks and financial institutions; and peddlers engaged in the

Therefore, CASURECO III can no longer invoke PD 269
to evade payment of local taxes. Moreover, its provisional
registration with the CDA which granted it exemption for the
payment of local taxes was extended only until May 4, 1992.
Thereafter, it can no longer claim any exemption from the
payment of local taxes, including the subject franchise tax.

392

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

sale of any merchandise or article of commerce. Moreover, the
local sanggunian is also authorized to impose taxes on any
other businesses not otherwise specified under Section 143
which the sanggunian concerned may deem proper to tax.
The coverage of business taxation particular to the City
of Makati is provided by the Makati Revenue Code ("Revenue
Code"), enacted through Municipal Ordinance No. 92-072.
A careful examination of the Revenue Code shows
that while Section 3A.02(m) seems designed as a catch-all
provision, Section 3A.02(f), which provides for a different tax
rate from that of the former provision, may be construed to be
of similar import. Whil e Section 3A.02(f) is quite exhaustive in
enumerating the class of businesses taxed under the provision,
the listing, while it does not include condominium-related
enterprises, ends with the abbreviation "etc.," or "et cetera."
We do note our discomfort with the unlimited breadth and
the dangerous uncertainty which are the twin hallmarks of the
words "et cetera." Certainly, we cannot be disposed to uphold
any tax imposition that derives its authority from enigmatic
and uncertain words such as "et cetera."
Whatever capacity the Corporation may have pursuant
to its power to exercise acts of ownership over personal and
real property is limited by its stated corporate purposes, which
are by themselves further limited by the Condominium Act.
A condominium corporation, while enjoying such powers of
ownership, is prohibited by law from transacting its properties
for the purpose of gainful profit.
Accordingly, and with a significant degree of comfort,
we hold that condominium corporations are generally exempt
from local business taxation under the Local Government
Code, irrespective of any local ordinance that seeks to declare
otherwise.
Still, we can note a possible exception to the rule. It
is not unthinkable that the unit owners of a condominium
would band together to engage in activities for profit under
the shelter of the condominium corporation. Such activity
would be prohibited under the Condominium Act, but if the
fact is established, we see no reason why the condominium
corporation may be made liable by the local government unit
for business taxes. Even though such activities would be

Title One Local Government Taxation

393

considered as ultra vires, since they are engaged in beyond the
legal capacity of the condominium corporation, the principle
of estoppel would preclude the corporation or its officers and
members from invoking the void nature of its undertakings for
profit as a means of acquitting itself of tax liability.
Still, the City Treasurer has not posited the claim that
the Corporation is engaged in business activities beyond
the statutory purposes of a condominium corporation. The
assessment appears to be based solely on the Corporation's
collection of assessments from unit owners, such assessments
being utilized to defray the necessary expenses for the
Condominium Project and the common areas. There is no
contemplation of business, no orientation towards profit in this
case. Hence, the assailed tax assessment has no basis under
the Local Government Code or the Makati Revenue Code,
and the insistence of the city in its collection of the void tax
constitutes an attempt at deprivation of property without due
process of law.
The petition is DENIED.

When a municipality or city has already imposed a

CITY OF MAN ILA v. COCA-COLA BOTTLERS
PHILIPPINES, INC.
595 SCRA 299, August 4, 2009, Chico-Nazario, J.
Facts: Respondent Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.
is a corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing and
selling beverages, and which maintains a sales office in the
City of Manila.
Prior to 25 February 2000, respondent had been paying
the City of Manila local business tax only under Section 14 of
Tax Ordinance No. 7794, being expressly exempted from the
business tax under Section 21 of the same tax ordinance.

394

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANN OTATED

Petitioner City of Manila subsequently approved on
25 February 2000, Tax Ordinance No. 7988, amending
certain sections of Tax Ordinance No. 7794, particularly: (1)
Section 14, by increasing the tax rates applicable to certain
establishments operating within the territorial jurisdiction of
the City of Manila; and (2) Section 21, by deleting the proviso
found therein, which stated "that all registered businesses in
the City of Manila that are already paying the aforementioned
tax shall be exempted from payment thereof." Petitioner City
of Manila approved only after a year, on 22 February 2001,
another tax ordinance, Tax Ordinance No. 8011, amending Tax
Ordinance No. 7988.
Ruling: Double taxation means taxing the same property
twice when it should be taxed only once; that is, "taxing the
same person twice by the same jurisdiction for the same thing."
It is obnoxious when the taxpayer is taxed twice, when it should
be but once. Otherwise described as "direct duplicate taxation,"
the two taxes must be imposed on the same subject matter, for
the same purpose, by the same taxing authority, within the
same jurisdiction, during the same taxing period; and the taxes
must be of the same kind or character.
Using the aforementioned test, the Court finds that there
is indeed double taxation if respondent is subjected to the taxes
under both Sections 14 and 21 of Tax Ordinance No. 7794, since
these are being imposed: (1) on the same subject matter-the
privilege of doing business in the City of Manila; (2) for the
same purpose to make persons conducting business within
the City of Manila contribute to city revenues; (3) by the same
taxing authority-petitioner City of Manila; (4) within the
same taxing jurisdiction-within the territorial jurisdiction
of the City of Manila; (5) for the same taxing periods-per
calendar year; and (6) of the same kind or character-a local
business tax imposed on gross sales or receipts of the business.
The distinction petitioners attempt to make between the
taxes under Sections 14 and 21 of Tax Ordinance No. 7794 is
specious. The Court revisits Section 143 of the LGC, the very
source of the power of municipalities and cities to impose a
local business tax, and to which any local business tax imposed
by petitioner City of Manila must conform. It is apparent from
a perusal thereof that when a municipality or city has already
imposed a business tax on manufacturers, etc. of liquors,

Boo k II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One

395

distilled spirits, wines, and any other article of commerce,
pursuant to Section 143(a) of the LGC, said municipality or
city may no longer subject the same manufacturers, etc. to a
business tax under Section l 43(h) of the same Code. Section
143(h) may be imposed only on businesses that are subject to
excise tax, VAT, or percentage tax under the NIRC, and that
are "not otherwise specified in preceding paragraphs." In the
same way, businesses such as respondent's, already subject to
a local business tax under Section 14 of Tax Ordinance No.
7794 [which is based on Section 143(a) of the LGC], can no
longer be made liable for local business tax under Section 21
of the same Tax Ordinance [which is based on Section 143(h)
of the LGC].
The instant Petition for Review on Certiorari is hereby
DENIED.

Section 143(h) states that "on any business subject to
x x x value-added x x x tax under the National Internal Revenue
Code, as amended, the rate of tax shall not exceed two percent (2%)
of gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year" from the
lease of goods or properties. Hence, the 10% tax rate imposed by
Ordinance No. 9503-2005 clearly violates Section 143(h) of the Local
Government Code.

CAGAYAN ELECTRIC POWER AND LIGHT CO., INC. v.
CITY OF CAGAYAN DE ORO
685 SCRA 609, November 14, 2012, Carpio, J.
Facts: On January 10, 2005, the Sangguniang Panlungsod
of Cagayan de Oro passed Ordinance No. 9503-2005 imposing a
tax on the lease or rental of electric and/or telecommunication
posts, poles or towers by pole owners to other pole users at ten
percent (10%) of the annual rental income derived from such
lease or rental.
On September 30, 2005, appellant CEPALCO, purportedly
on pure question of law, filed a petition for declaratory relief
assailing the validity of Ordinance No. 9503-2005 before the
RTC of Cagayan de Oro City.
Ruling: We disagree with the City of Cagayan de Oro's
submission that Ordinance No. 9503-2005 is not subject
to the limits imposed by Sections 143 and 151 of the Local
Government Code. On the contrary, Ordinance No. 9503-2005

396

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

is subject to the limitation set by Section 143h). Section 143
recognizes separate lines of business and imposes different tax
rates for different lines of business. Let us suppose that one is a
brewer of liquor and, at the same time, a distributor of articles
of commerce. The brewery business is subject to the rates
established in Section 143(a) while the distribution business
is subject to the rates established in Section 143(b). The City
of Cagayan de Oro's imposition of a tax on the lease of poles
falls under Section 143(h), as the lease of poles is CEPALCO's
separate line of business which is not covered by paragraphs
(a) to (g) of Section 143. The treatment of the lease of poles as a
separate line of business is evident in Section 4(a) of Ordinance
No. 9503-2005. The City of Cagayan de Oro required CEPALCO
to apply for a separate business permit.
More importantly, because "any person, who in the course
of trade or business xx x leases goods or properties xxxshall be
subject to the value-added tax," the imposable tax rate should
not exceed two percent of gross receipts of the lease of poles
of the preceding calendar year. Section 143(h) states that "on
any business subject to x x x value-added x x x tax under the
National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the rate of tax
shall not exceed two percent (2%) of gross sales or receipts of the
preceding calendar year" from the lease of goods or properties.
Hence, the 10% tax rate imposed by Ordinance No. 9503-2005
clearly violates Section 143h) of the Local Government Code.
Finally, in view of the lack of a separability clause, we
declare void the entirety of Ordinance No. 9503-2005. Any
payment made by reason of the tax imposed by Ordinance No.
9503-2005 should, therefore, be refunded to CEPALCO. Our
ruling, however, is made without prejudice to the enactment
by the City of Cagayan de Oro of a tax ordinance that complies
with the limits set by the Local Government Code.
We GRAN T the petition. The Decision of the CA and the
Resolution are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Ordinance No.
9503-2006 is declared void.

Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) holding companies
established to own and hold the shares of stock of San Miguel
Corporation (SMC). On January 24, 2012, the Supreme
Court rendered its decision in Philippine Coconut Producers
Federation, Inc. v. Republic (COCOFED), docketed as G.R.
Nos. 177857-58 and 178793, declaring the CIIF companies,
including RA VI, and the CIIF block of SMC shares as "public
funds necessarily owned by the Government."
On January 17, 2013, RAVI filed with the RTC, a

claim for refund or credit of erroneously and illegally
collected local business taxes (LBT) for the taxable
year 2010. RA VI claimed that petitioners City of Davao, et.
al. erroneously and illegally collected LBT in the amount of
P503,346.00, corresponding to its dividends from its SMC
preferred shares, on the mistaken assumption that it is a nonbank financial intermediary (NBFI).

Ruling: Petitioners argue that RAVT's liability for LBT
finds basis under Section 143 (I) of the LGC, to wit:
SECTION 143. Tax on Business. T he municipality
may impose taxes on the following businesses:
xXxX

(f) On banks and other financial institutions,
at a rate not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of one percent
(1%) on the gross receipts of the preceding calendar
year derived from interest, commissions and discounts
from lending activities, income from financial leasing,
dividends, rentals on property and profit from exchange
or sale of property, insurance premium.
"Banks and other financial institutions" are de
fined under the same Code as to "include non-bank
financial intermediaries, lending investors, finance

398

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

and investment companies, pawnshops, money shops,
insurance companies, stock markets, stock brokers and
dealers in securities and foreign exchange, as defined under
applicable laws, or rules and regulations thereunder."
Essentially, LBT are taxes imposed by local government
units on the privilege of doing business within their
jurisdictions. To be sure, the phrase "doing business" means
some "trade or commercial activity regularly engaged in as a
means of livelihood or with a view to profit." Particularly,
the LBT imposed pursuant to Section 143 (f) is premised on
the fact that the persons made liable for such tax are banks
or other financial institutions by virtue of their being engaged
in the business as such. This is why the LBT are imposed on
their gross receipts from "interest, commissions and discounts
from lending activities, income from financial leasing,
dividends, rentals on property and profit from exchange or sale
of property, insurance premium."
In this case, it is clear that RA VI is neither a bank nor
other financial institution, i.e., an NBFI.
As observed in the COCOFED case, RA VI is a CIIF holding
company. The SMC preferred shares held by it are considered
government assets owned by the National Government for the
coconut industry. These SMC shares as well as any resulting
dividends or increments from said shares are owned by the
National Government and shall be used only for the benefit
of the coconut farmers and for the development of the coconut
industry.
Indeed, there is a stark distinction between a holding
company and a financial intermediary as contemplated under
the LGC, in relation to other laws. A "holding company'
is 'organized' and is basically conducting its business by
investing substantially in the equity securities of another
company for the purpose of controlling their policies
(as opposed to directly engaging in operating activities) and
'holding' them in a conglomerate or umbrella structure
along with other subsidiaries." While holding companies may
partake in investment activities, this does not per se qualify
them as financial intermediaries that are actively dealing in
the same. Financial intermediaries are regulated by the BSP
because they deal with public funds when they offer quasibanking functions. On the other hand, a holding company is

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Ttle One Local Government Taxation

399

not similarly regulated because any investment activities it
conducts are mere incidental operations, since its main purpose
is to hold shares for policy-controlling purposes.
RAVI's act of placing the dividends from the SMC
preferred shares in a trust account, which incidentally earns
interest, does not convert it into an active investor or dealer
in securities. As above-stated, the primary test is regularity of
function, not on an isolated basis, with the end in mind for selfprofit. Being restricted to managing the dividends of the SMC
preferred shares on behalf of the government, RA VI cannot
be said to be "doing business" as a bank or other financial
institution, i.e., an NBFI.
In sum, since RAVI is not a bank or other financial
institution, i.e., an NBFI, it cannot be held liable for LBT
under Section 143(1) of the LGC. However, this pronouncement
is without prejudice to RAVI's potential liability for other
taxes, whether national or local, should it so engage in other
profit-making activities aside from its management of the SMC
preferred shares, and the dividends resulting therefrom.
The petition is DENIED.
(Note: This ruling is reiterated in the case of City of Davao
v. AP Holdings, Inc., G.R. No. 245887, January 22, 2020.)

Amusement Tax

1.
In light of the Pelizloy Realty case, a golf course cannot be
considered a place of amusement. People do not enter a golf course
to see or view a show or performance. Petitioner also, as proprietor
or operator of the golf course, does not actively display, stage, or
present a show or performance. People go to a golf course to engage
themselves in a physical sport activity, i.e., to play golf.
ALTA VISTA GOLF AND COUNTRY CLUB v.
CITY OF CEBU
781 SCRA 335, January 20, 2016,
Leonardo-De Castro, J.
Facts: Petitioner is a non-stock and non-profit corporation
operating a golf course in Cebu City. On June 21, 1993, the
Sangguniang Panlungsod of Cebu City enacted City Tax:
Ordinance No. LXIX, the "Revised Omnibus Tax: Ordinance of
the City of Cebu" (Revised Omnibus Tax: Ordinance).

400

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Section 42 of the said tax ordinance on amusement tax
was amended by City Tax Ordinance Nos. LXXXI I and LXXXIV
which were enacted by the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Cebu
City on December 2, 1996 and April 20, 1998, respectively to
read as follows:
Section 42. Rate of Tax. - There shall be paid to the
Office of the City Treasurer by the proprietors, lessees or
operators of theaters, cinemas, concert halls, circuses and
other similar places of entertainment, an amusement tax
at the rate of thirty percent (30%), golf courses and polo
grounds at the rate of twenty percent (20%), of their gross
receipts on entrance, playing green, and/or admission
fees.
Respondent City Treasurer Teresita Camarillo sought
to collect from petitioner deficiency business taxes, fees, and
charges for the year 1998, totaling P2,981,441.52.
Ruling: The Local Government Code authorizes the
imposition by local government units of amusement tax under
Section 140, which provides:
Sec. 140. Amusement Tax.
(a) The province
may levy an amusement tax to be collected from the
proprietors, lessees, or operators of theaters,
cinemas, concert halls, circuses, boxing stadia, and
other places of amusement at a rate of not more than
thirty percent (30%) of the gross receipts from admission
fees.
The pronouncements of the Court in Pelizloy Realty

Corporation u. The Province of Benguet 695 SCRA 491 (2013)
are of particular significance to this case. The Court, in
Pelizloy Realty, declared null and void the second paragraph of
Article X, Section 59 of the Benguet Provincial Code, in so far
as it imposes amusement taxes on admission fees to resorts,
swimming pools, bath houses, hot springs, and tourist spots.
Applying the principle of ejusdem generis, as well as the ruling
in the PBA case, the Court expounded on the authority of local
government units to impose amusement tax under Section 140,
in relation to Section 131(c), of the Local Government Code, as
follows:
Thus, resorts, swimming pools, bath houses, hot
springs and tourist spots do not belong to the same
category or class as theaters, cinemas, concert halls,

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One Local Government Taxation

401

circuses, and boxing stadia. It follows that they cannot
be considered as among the 'other places of amusement'
contemplated by Section 140 of the LGC and which may
properly be subject to amusement taxes.
In light of Pelizloy Realty, a golf course cannot be
considered a place of amusement. As petitioner asserted, people
do not enter a golf course to see or view a show or performance.
Petitioner also, as proprietor or operator of the golf course, does
not actively display, stage, or present a show or performance.
People go to a golf course to engage themselves in a physical
sport activity, i.e., to play golf.
The amusement tax of 20% on the gross receipts on
entrance, playing green, and/or admission fees of golf courses
is void.
The Court GRAN TS the instant Petition.

Fees and Charges

1.
As the party assailing the ordinance, it was CEPALCO's
responsibility to prove the amount's excessiveness; it had the
burden to show that the fee was not commensurate with the cost
of regulation, inspection, and licensing. It failed to dismantle the
presumption of validity because it never established that the city
council abused its discretion in setting the amount of the fee at
P500.00.
CITY OF CAGAYAN DE ORO v. CAGAYAN
ELECTRIC POWER & LIGHT CO., INC.
G.R. No. 224825, October 17, 2018, A. Reyes, Jr., J.
Facts: On January 24, 2005, the petitioner City of
Cagayan de Oro through its local legislative council, enacted
Ordinance No. 9527-2005, which imposed an annual Mayor's
Permit Fee of Five Hundred Pesos (P500.00) on every electric or
telecommunications post belonging to public utility companies
operating in the city.
The respondent, Cagayan Electric Power & Light Co.,
Inc. (CEPALCO) is a public utility engaged in the distribution
of electric power and the owner of an estimated 17,000 utility
poles erected within Cagayan de Oro City. The ordinance
entailed that the electricity distributor would have to pay an
annual Mayor's Permit Fee of P8,500,000.00.

402

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Ruling: A cursory reading of the whereas clauses makes
it is apparent that the purpose of the ordinance is to
regulate the construction and maintenance of electric
and telecomm unications posts erected within Cagayan de
Oro City.
It is clear that the ordinance in this case serves a regulatory
purpose and is, hence, an exercise of police power. Nowhere in
the text of the ordinance is it shown that it was enacted to raise
revenue. On the contrary, the third whereas clause expressly
states the city's need to impose some form of regulation on the
construction of electric and telecommunications poles. As in
Smart Communications v. Municipality of Malvar, 722 Phil.
430 (2014) the fee is not imposed on the structure itself, but
on the activity subject of government regulation, which is the
installation and establishment of utility posts. Thus, it can be
concluded without argument that the ordinance imposes
a fee since it was enacted pursuant to the city's police
power and serves to regulate, not to raise revenue.
Section 130 lays down several underlying axioms that
must be adhered to by all fiscal impositions levied by municipal
corporations, thus: (3) not be unjust, excessive, oppressive or
confiscatory.
CEPALCO contended that the ordinance was null and
void due to the unjust, excessive, and confiscatory nature
of the Mayor's Permit Fee. In line with this contention, the
electricity distributor now bears the burden of showing that
the ordinance violates Sections 130, 147, and 186 of the Local
Government Code.
On the other hand, Section 147, when read in conjunction
with Section 151, places a general limitation on the amount
levied by regulatory fees imposed by cities, thus:such reasonable
fees and charges on business and occupation and, except as
reserved to the province in Section 139 of this Code, on the
practice of any profession or calling, commensurate with the
cost of regulation, inspec tion_and licensing before any person
may engage in such business or occupation, or practice such
profession or calling. Section 130 lays down several underlying
axioms, that must be adhered to by all fiscal impositions levied
by municipal corporations, thus: (3) not be unjust, oppressive,
or confiscatory.

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One Local Government Taxation

403

It can be gleaned from the foregoing that if a regulatory
fee produces revenue in excess of the cost of the regulation,
inspection, and licensing, it will be considered excessive, and
hence fail the test of judicial scrutiny.
A review of the proceedings before the trial court shows
that the allegation of the fee's unreasonableness was never
substantiated. In fact, the memorandum CEPALCO filed
before the trial court is bereft of any allegations showing
the impropriety of the amount exacted by the ordinance.
Besides the self-serving statement that the sum of P500.00
was disproportionate to the cost of regulation and inspection
of utility poles, CEPALCO showed nothing tending to prove
the fee's excessiveness. The electricity distributor simply
maintained that the amount was confiscatory, and prayed
that the ordinance be struck down for being unlawful and
unjustified.
Without evidence indicating that the amount of the
Mayor's Permit Fee is disproportionate to the cost ofregulation,
inspection, and licensing of utility poles located in Cagayan de
Oro City, the Court cannot agree with the CA's invalidation of
the ordinance.
As the party assailing the ordinance, it was CEPALCO's
responsibility to prove the amount's excessiveness; it had the
burden to show that the fee was not commensurate with the
cost of regulation, inspection, and licensing. Nevertheless,
for the reasons discussed above, it failed to dismantle the
presumption of validity because it never established that the
city council abused its discretion in setting the amount of the
fee at P500.00.

(5) days after the sale, the local treasurer shall make
a report of the proceeding in writing to the local
chief executive concerned. Should the property
distrained be not disposed of within one hundred
and twenty (120) days from the date of distraint,
the same shall be considered as sold to the local
government unit concerned for the amount of the
assessment made thereon by the Comm ittee on

a legal execution throughout the Philippines. Levy
shall be effected by writing upon said certificate
the description of the property upon which levy is

the occupant of the property in question.

(f Disposition of proceeds-The proceeds of
the sale shall be applied to satisfy the tax, including
the surcharges, interest, and other penalties
incident to delinquency, and the expenses of the
distraint and sale. The balance over and above
what is required to pay the entire claim shall be
returned to the owner of the property sold. The
expenses chargeable upon the seizure and sale
shall embrace only the actual expenses of seizure
and preservation of the property pending the sale,
and no charge shall be imposed for the services of
the local officer or his deputy. Where the proceeds
of the sale are insufficient to satisfy the claim,
other property may, in like manner, be distrained
until the full amount due, including all expenses, is
collected.
SEC. 176. Levy on Real Property.
After
the expiration of the time required to pay the
delinquent tax, fee, or charge, real property may
be levied on before, simultaneously, or after the
distraint of personal property belonging to the
delinquent taxpayer. To this end, the provincial,
city or municipal treasurer, as the case may be,
shall prepare a duly authenticated certificate
showing the name of the taxpayer and the amount
of the tax, fee, or charge, and penalty due from

In case the levy on real property is not issued
before or simultaneously with the warrant of
distraint on personal property, and the personal
property of the taxpayer is not sufficient to satisfy
his delinquency, the provincial, city or municipal
treasurer, as the case may be, shall within thirty
(30) days after execution of the distraint, proceed
with the levy on the taxpayer's real property. A
report on any levy shall, within ten (10) days after
receipt of the warrant, be submitted by the levying
officer to the sanggunian concerned.
SEC. 177. Penalty for Failure to Issue and
Execute Warrant.
Without prejudice to criminal
prosecution under the Revised Penal Code and
other applicable, laws, any local treasurer who
fails to issue or execute the warrant of distraint or
levy after the expiration of the time prescribed, or
who is found guilty of abusing the exercise thereof
by competent authority shall be automatically
dismissed from the service after due notice and
hearing.
SEC. 178. Advertisement and Sale.

thirty (30) days after levy, the local treasurer shall
proceed to publicly advertise for sale or auction
the property or a usable portion thereof as may
he necessary to satisfy the claim and cost of sale;

least thirty (30) days. It shall be affected by posting
a notice at the main entrance of the municipal
building or city hall, and in public and conspicuous

amount of taxes, fees, or charges, and penalties due
thereon, and the time and place of sale, the name
of the taxpayer against whom the taxes, fees, or
charges are levied, and a short description of the
property to be sold. At anytime before the date fixed
for the sale, the taxpayer may stay the proceedings
by paying the taxes, fees, or charges penalties and
interests. If he fails to do so, the sale shall proceed
and shall be held either at the main entrance of
the provincial, city or municipal building, or on
the property to be sold, or at any other place as
determined by the local treasurer conducting the
sale and specified in the notice of sale.
Within thirty (30) days after the sale, the local
treasurer of his deputy shall make a report of the
sale to the sanggunian concerned, and which shall
form part of his records. After consultation with
the sanggunian, the local treasurer shall make and
deliver to the purchaser a certificate ofsale, showing
the proceedings of the sale describing the property
sold, stating the name of the purchaser and setting
out the exact amount of all taxes, fees, charges, and
related surcharges, interest, or penalties: Provided,
however, That any excess in the proceeds of the sale
over the claim and cost of sales shall be turned over
to the owner of the property.
The local treasurer may, by ordinance duly
approved, advance an amount sufficient to defray
the costs of collection by means of the remedies
provided for in this Title, including the preservation
or transportation in case of personal property, and
the advertisement and subsequent sale, in cases of
personal and real property including improvements
thereon.

case the taxpayer fails to redeem the property as
provided herein, the local treasurer shall execute
a deed conveying to the purchaser so much of the

there is no bidder for the real property advertised
for sale as provided herein, or if the highest bid is
for an amount insufficient to pay the taxes, fees, or

and costs, the local treasurer conducting the sale
shall purchase the property in behalf of the local
government unit concerned to satisfy the claim and
within two (2) days thereafter shall make a report
of his proceedings which shall be reflected upon
the records of his office. It shall be the duty of the
Registrar of Deeds concerned upon registration
with his office of any such declaration of forfeiture
to transfer the title of the forfeited property to
the local government unit concerned without the

expenses, is collected.

Within one (1) year from the date of such
forfeiture, the taxpayer or any of his representatives

Charges.
Local government units may exercise
the power to levy taxes, fees or charges on any base
or subject not otherwise specifically enumerated
herein or taxed under the provisions of the National
Internal Revenue Code, as amended, or other
applicable laws: Provided, That the taxes, fees, or

Provided, further, That the ordinance levying such
taxes, fees or charges shall not be enacted without
any prior public hearing conducted for the purpose.
A.

Decided Cases

An ordinance levying taxes, fees or charges shall not be
enacted without any prior public hearing conducted for the purpose.
FIGUERRES v. CA
305 SCRA 206, March 25, 1999, Mendoza, J.
Facts: Petitioner Belen Figuerres is the owner of a parcel
of land located at Amarillo Street, Barangay Mauway, City of
Mandaluyong. In 1993, she received a notice of assessment
from the municipal assessor of the then Municipality of
Mandaluyong.
The assessment was based on Ordinance Nos. 119 and
125, and Ordinance No. 135, series of 1994, of the Sangguniang
Bayan of Mandaluyong. Ordinance No. 119, contains a schedule
of fair market values of the different classes of real property
in the municipality. Ordinance No. 125, on the other hand,
fixes the assessment levels applicable to such classes of real
property. Finally, Ordinance No. 135, amended Ordinance No.
119, by providing that only one third (1/3) of the increase in the
market values applicable to residential lands pursuant to the
said ordinance shall be implemented in the years 1994, 1995,
and 1996.
Petitioner brought a prohibition suit in the Court of
Appeals to stop them from enforcing the ordinances in question
on the ground that the ordinances were invalid for having been
adopted allegedly without public hearings and prior publication
or posting. The Court of Appeals threw out the petition.

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One Local Government Taxation

421

Held: Petitioner is right in contending that public
hearings are required to be conducted prior to the enactment
of an ordinance imposing real property taxes. R.A. No. 7160,
provides that an ordinance levying taxes, fees, or charges "shall
not be enacted without any prior public hearing conducted for
the purpose."
The lack of a public hearing is a negative allegation
essential to petitioner's cause of action in the present case. As
petitioner is the party asserting it, she has the burden of proof.
Since petitioner failed to rebut the presumption of validity in
favor of the subject ordinances and to discharge the burden
of proving that no public hearings were conducted prior to
the enactment thereof, we are constrained to uphold their
constitutionality or legality.
2.
Even assuming that petitioners received their notice
also on 6 August 1998, the "public hearing" was already scheduled,
and actually conducted, only five days later, on 11 August 1998.
This contravenes Article 277(b)(3) of the Implementing Rules and
Regulations of the Local Government Code which requires that
the public hearing be held no less than ten days from the time the
notices were sent out, posted, or published.
ONGSUCO v. MALONES
604 SCRA 499, October 27, 2009, Chico-Nazario, J.
Facts: Petitioners Evelyn Ongsuco, et al. are stall holders
at the Maasin Public Market, which had just been newly
renovated. In a letter dated 6 August 1998, the Office of the
Municipal Mayor informed petitioners of a meeting scheduled
on 11 August 1998 concerning the municipal public market.
Revenue measures were discussed during the said meeting,
including the increase in the rentals for the market stalls and
the imposition of "goodwill fees" in the amount of P20,000.00,
payable every month.
On 17 August 1998, the Sangguniang Bayan of Maasin
approved Municipal Ordinance No. 98.01, entitled "The
Municipal Revised Revenue Code." The Code contained a
provision for increased rentals for the stalls and the imposition
of goodwill fees in the amount of P20,000.00 and P15,000.00
for stalls located on the first and second floors of the municipal
public market, respectively.

Ruling: For the valid enactment of ordinances imposing
charges, certain legal requisites must be met. Section 186 of
the Local Government Code identifies such requisites including
"prior hearing conducted for the purpose."

respondent the jurisdiction to order petitioners' stalls at the
municipal public market vacant.
The instant Petition is GRANTED. Municipal Ordinance
No. 98-01 is DECLARED void and ineffective, and a writ
of prohibition is ISSUED commanding the Mayor of the
Municipality of Maasin, Iloilo, to permanently desist from
enforcing the said ordinance. Petitioners are also DECLAR ED
as lawful occupants of the market stalls they occupied at the
time they filed the Petition for Mandamus/Prohibition docketed
as Civil Case No. 25843. In the event that they were deprived
of possession of the said market stalls, petitioners are entitled
to recover possession of these stalls.

Section 277. Publication of Tax Ordinance and Revenue
Measures of the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
Local Government Code establishes in detail the procedure for
the enactment of such an ordinance including the "conduct of
public hearings."
It is categorical, therefore, that a public hearing be held
prior to the enactment of an ordinance levying taxes, fees, or
charges; and that such public hearing be conducted as provided
under Section 277 of the IRR of the LGC.

CA decision is AFFIRMED.

The notices sent to petitioners and other stall holders at
the municipal public market were sent out on 6 August 1998,
informing them of the supposed "public hearing" to be held on
11 August 1998. Even assuming that petitioners received their
notice also on 6 August 1998, the "public hearing" was already
scheduled, and actually conducted, only five days later, on 11
August 1998. This contravenes Article 277(b)(3) of the IRR of
the LGC which requires that the public hearing be held no less
than ten days from the time the notices were sent out, posted,
or published.

SEC. 187. Procedure for Approval and
Effectivity of Tax Ordinances and Revenue
Measures; Mandatory Public Hearing8.
The
procedure for approval of local tax ordinances
and revenue measures shall be in accordance with
the provisions of this Code: Provided, That public
hearings shall be conducted for the purpose prior
to the enactment thereof: Provided, further, That
any question on the constitutionality or legality
of tax ordinances or revenue measures may be
raised on appeal within thirty (30) days from the
effectivity thereof to the Secretary of Justice
who shall render a decision within sixty (60) days
from the date of receipt of the appeal: Provided,
however, That such appeal shall not have the effect
of suspending the effectivity of the ordinance and
the accrual and payment of the tax, fee, or charge
levied therein: Provided, finally, That within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the decision or the lapse
of the sixty-day period without the Secretary of
Justice acting upon the appeal, the aggrieved party
may file appropriate proceedings with a court of
competent jurisdiction.

When the Sangguniang Bayan of Maasin sought to
correct this procedural defect through Resolution No. 68, series
of 1998, dated 18 September 1998, respondent Mayor Mariano
Malones vetoed the said resolution. Although the Sangguniang
Bayan may have had the power to override respondent's veto,
it no longer did so.
The defect in the enactment of Municipal Ordinance No.
98 was not cured when another public hearing was held on 22
January 1999, after the questioned ordinance was passed by the
Sangguniang Bayan and approved by respondent on 17 August
1998. Section 186 of the Local Government Code prescribes
that the public hearing be held prior to the enactment by a
local government unit of an ordinance levying taxes, fees, and
charges.
Since no public hearing had been duly conducted prior
to the enactment of Municipal Ordinance No. 98-01, said
ordinance is void and cannot be given any effect. Consequently,
a void and ineffective ordinance could not have conferred upon

A.

Decided Cases

1.
Where the Secretary of Justice reviews, pursuant to law,
a tax measure enacted by a local government unit to determine if the
officials performed their functions in accordance with law, i.e., with

424

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the prescribed procedure for the enactment of tax ordinances and
the grant of powers under the Local Government Code, the same is
an act of mere supervision, not control.
DRILON v. LIM
235 SCRA 135, August 4, 1994, Cruz, J.
Facts: Pursuant to Sec 187 of the LGC, the Secretary of
Justice had, on appeal to him of four (4) oil companies and a
taxpayer, declared Ordinance No. 7794, the Manila Revenue
Code, null and void for noncompliance with the prescribed
procedure in the enactment of tax ordinances and for containing
certain provisions contrary to law and public policy.
The RTC of Manila revoked the Secretary's resolution and
sustained the ordinance, holding inter alia that the procedural
requirements had been observed. It declared Section 187 of
the Local Government Code as unconstitutional because of its
investure in the Secretary of Justice of the power of control over
local governments in violation of the policy of local autonomy
mandated in the Constitution and of the specific provision
therein conferring on the President of the Philippines only the
power of supervision over local governments.
Held: Section 187 authorizes the Secretary of Justice to
review only the constitutionality or legality of the tax ordinance
and, if warranted, to revoke it on either or both of these grounds.
When he alters or modifies or sets aside a tax ordinance, he
is not also permitted to substitute his own judgment for the
judgment of the local government that enacted the measure.
Secretary Drilon did set aside the Manila Revenue Code, but
he did not replace it with his own version of what the Code
should be. As we see it, that was an act not of control but of
mere supervision.
The issue of non-compliance with the prescribed
procedure in the enactment of the Manila Revenue Code is
another matter.
In his resolution, Secretary Drilon declared that there
were no written notices of public hearings on the proposed
Manila Revenue Code that were sent to interested parties as
required by Art. 276(b) of the Implementing Rules of the Local
Government Code, nor were copies of the proposed ordinance

Book II-- Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One Local Government Taxation

425

published in three (3) successive issues of a newspaper of
general circulation pursuant to Art. 276(a).
Judge Palattao found otherwise. He declared that all the
procedural requirements had been observed in the enactment
of the Manila Revenue Code. We have carefully examined
every one of these exhibits and agree with the trial court that
the procedural requirements have indeed been observed.
The judgment is hereby rendered REVERSING the
challenged decision of the RTC insofar as it declared Section
187 of the Local Government Code unconstitutional, but
AFFIRMING its finding that the procedural requirements in
the enactment of the Manila Revenue Code have been observed.
2.
Petitioner cannot validly claim lack of knowledge of
the approved ordinance. The filing of its appeal a year after the
effectivity of the subject ordinance is fatal to its cause. The 30-day
period stated in Section 187 of the LGC is mandatory.
HAGONOY MARKET VENDOR ASSOCIATION v.
MUNICIPALITY OF HAGONOY, BULACAN
367 SCRA 376, February 6, 2002, Puno, J.
Facts: On October 1, 1996, the Sangguniang Bayan of
Hagonoy, Bulacan, enacted an ordinance, Kautusan Big.
28, which increased the stall rentals of the market vendors
in Hagonoy. Article 3 provided that it shall take effect upon
approval. The subject ordinance was posted from November
4-25, 1996.
In the last week of November, 1997, the petitioner's
members were personally given copies of the approved
Ordinance and were informed that it shall be enforced in
January, 1998. On December 8, 1997, the petitioner's President
filed an appeal with the Secretary of Justice assailin g the
constitutionality of the tax ordinance.
The Secretary of Justice dismissed the appeal on the
ground that it was filed out of time, i.e., beyond thirty (30) days
from the effectivity of the Ordinance on October l, 1996, as
prescribed under Section 187 of the 1991 Local Government
Code.
Held: Sec. 187 of the 1991 Government Code requires
that an appeal of a tax ordinance or revenue measure should

426

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

be made to the Secretary of Justice within thirty (30) days from
effectivity of the ordinance and even during its pendency, the
effectivity of the assailed ordinance shall not be suspended.
In the case at bar, Municipal Ordinance No. 28 took effect
in October 1996. Petitioner filed its appeal only in December
1997, more than a year after the effectivity of the ordinance in
1996. Clearly, the Secretary of Justice correctly dismissed it for
being time barred.
The periods stated in Section 187 of the Local Government
Code are mandatory. Ordinance No. 28 is a revenue measure
adopted by the municipality of Hagonoy to fix and collect public
market stall rentals. Being its lifeblood, collection of revenues
by the government is of paramount importance. Hence, the
law provided a time limit for an aggrieved party to assail the
legality of revenue measures and tax ordinances.
Petitioner's bold assertion that there was no public hearing
conducted prior to the passage of Kautusan Big. 28 is belied
by its own evidence. In petitioner's two (2) communications
with the Secretary of Justice, it enumerated the various
objections raised by its members before the passage of the
ordinance in several meetings called by the Sanggunian for the
purpose. These show beyond doubt that petitioner was aware
of the proposed increase and in fact participated in the public
hearings therefor.
The Ordinance was posted during the period from
November 4-25, 1996 in three (3) public places, viz.: in front
of the municipal building, at the bulletin board of the Sta. Ana
Parish Church, and on the front door of the Office of the Market
Master in the public market. Posting was validly made in lieu
of publication as there was no newspaper of local circulation in
the Municipality of Hagonoy.
3.
To question the validity of the ordinance in court,
petitioners should have first filed an appeal within 30 days from
effectivity before the Secretary of Justice.
AALA v. UY

Facts: On November3, 2011, the Sangguniang Panlungsod
of Tagum City passed City Ordinance No. 516, s-2011, entitled
An Ordinance Approving the New Schedule of Market Values,

its Classification, and Assessment Level of Real Properties in
the City of 'Tagum. The ordinance was approved by Mayor Rey
T. Uy on November 11,2011 and was immediately forwarded to
the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Davao de] Norte for review.
On April 30, 2012, Engineer Crisanto Aala, et al., residents of
Tagum City filed before the SP their opposition.
On June 18, 2012, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of
Davao de! Norte issued Resolution No. 428 declaring as invalid
Sections III C1, 2, and 3, Sections III D (1) and (2), and Sections
G l(b) and 4(g) of City Ordinance No. 558, s-2012. It returned
the Ordinance to the SP of Tagum City, which passed City
Ordinance 558, S-2012. This was again declared invalid by the
SP of Davao de! Norte.
On July 9, 2012, the Sangguniang Panlungsod of
Tagum City passed Resolution No. 874, s-2012 declaring
City Ordinance No. 558, s-2012 as valid. The Sangguniang
Panlungsod ofTagum City cited as its basis Section 56(d) of the
LGC and DILG Opinion No. 151 dated November 25, 2010. It
argued that the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Davao de! Norte
failed to take action on City Ordinance No. 558, s-2012 within
30 days from its receipt on April 12, 2012. Hence, under Section
56(d) of the Local Government Code of 1991, City Ordinance
No. 558, s-2012 enjoys the presumption of validity.
On August 13, 2012, petitioners Asia, et. al., filed with
the Supreme Court their Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition
and Mandamus to nullify the ordinance.
Ruling: Under Section 187 of the Local Government
Code of 1991, aggrieved taxpayers who question the validity or
legality of a tax ordinance are required to file an appeal within
30 days from effectivity before the Secretary of Justice before
they seek intervention from the regular courts.
The questioned ordinance was published in July 2012.
Had petitioners immediately filed an appeal, the Secretary
of Justice would have had enough time to render a decision.
Section 187, LGC gives the Secretary of Justice 60 days to act
on the appeal. Within 30 days from receipt of an unfavorable
decision or upon inaction by the Secretary of Justice within
the time prescribed, aggrieved taxpayers may opt to lodge the
appropriate proceeding before the regular courts.

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

The "catch-22 situation" petitioners Crisanto Aala,
et al., allude to does not exist. Under Section 166 of the Local
Government Code of 1991, local taxes "shall accrue on the
first (1st) day of January of each year." When the questioned
ordinance was published in July 2012, the City Government
of Tagum could not have immediately issued real property tax
assessments. Hence, petitioners had ample time within which
to question the validity of the tax ordinance.
The Petition for Certiorari, Prohibition, and Mandamus
is DISMISSED.
SEC. 188. Publication of Tax Ordinances and
Revenue Measures. W ithin ten (10) days after their

Decided Cases

1.
Section 191 of the LGC will not apply because with the
assailed tax ordinance, there is no outright or unilateral increase of
tax to speak of. The assailed ordinance merely imposes and collects
the proper and legal tax due to the local government pursuant to the
LGC. The adjustment was not by virtue of a unilateral increase of
the tax rate of petitioners as retailers, but again, merely incidental
as a result of the correction of the classification of wholesalers and
retailers and its corresponding tax rates in accordance with the
provisions of the LGC.

MINDANAO SHOPPING DESTINATION
CORPORATION v. DUTERTE
826 SCRA 143, June 6, 2017, Peralta, J.
Facts: Petitioners Mindanao Shopping Destination
Corporation, et. al. are corporations engaged in the retail
business of selling general merchandise in Davao City.
On November 16, 2005, respondent Sangguniang
Panglungsod of Davao City (Sanggunian), after due notice and
hearing, enacted the assailed Davao City Ordinance No. 158-05,
Series of 2005, otherwise known as "An Ordinance Approving
the 2005 Revenue Code of the City of Davao, as Amended" The
Ordinance took effect after the publication in the Mindanao

Mercury Times.
Petitioners claimed that they used to pay only 50% of 1 %
of the business tax rate under the old Davao City Ordinance
No. 230, Series of; 1990, but in the assailed new ordinance,
it will require them to pay a tax rate of 1.5%, or an increase
of 200% from the previous rate. Petitioners believe that the
increase is not allowed under Republic Act (RA) No. 7160, The
Local Government Code (LGC).

Ruling: It can be shown that the assailed ordinance does
not violate the limitation imposed by Section 191 of the LGC on
the adjustment of tax rate for the following reasons:
Section 191 of the LGC will not apply because with the
assailed tax ordinance, there is no outright or unilateral
increase of tax to speak of. The resulting increase in the tax
rate for retailers was merely incidental. When Davao City
enacted the assailed ordinance, it merely intended to rectify

430

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the glaring error in the classification of wholesaler and retailer
in the old ordinance. Petitioners are retailers as contemplated
by the LGC. Petitioners never disputed their classification as
retailers. Thus, being retailers, they are subject to the tax rate
provided under Section 69 (d) and not under Section 69 (b) of
the assailed ordinance. In effect, under the assailed ordinance
as amended, petitioners as retailers are now assessed at the
tax rate of one and one-fourth (1 1/4%) percent on their gross
sales and not the fifty-five (55%) percent of one (1%) percent
on their gross sales since the latter tax rate is only applicable
to wholesalers, distributors, or dealers. While it may appear
that there was indeed a significant adjustment on the tax rate
of retailers which affected the petitioners, it must, however,
be emphasized that the adjustment was not by virtue of a
unilateral increase of the tax rate of petitioners as retailers,
but again, merely incidental as a result of the correction of the
classification of wholesalers and retailers and its corresponding
tax rates in accordance with the provisions of the LGC.
Davao City has already foregone a substantial loss
in revenues as a result of an unadjusted lower tax rate
for retailers. Dictated by justice and fairness, in its initial
attempt to implement the LGC, Davao City should, at the
very least, start with 1% (the minimum tax rate) as provided
under Section 143 (d) of the LGC. Considering that 11 years
had already elapsed from its implementing in 2006, Davao
City could adjust its tax rate twice now which will make its
adjusted tax rate for retailers pegged at 1.2%, in accordance
with Section 191 of the LGC. To clarify, from 2006-2011 (first
5 years), the initial tax rate should start with 1%; from 20112016 (next 5 years) - 1.1%, thus, for the years 2017-2021, the
tax adjustment is 1.21%. However, for this purpose, Davao City
should pass an ordinance to give effect to the above-discussed
tax adjustments.
The instant petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The
Decision and Resolution of the CA are hereby AFFIRMED
with MODIFICATION in so far as the tax rate of 1.25% to be
imposed on petitioners is REDUCED to 1.21%.
2.
Section 104 of Ordinance No. 8331 series of 2013 is NULL
and VOID insofar as it imposes more than 2.20% tax rate on gross
receipts on sales amounting to Php 50,000.00 up to Php 400,000.00.

DE LIMA v. CITY OF MANILA
G.R. No. 222886, October 17, 2018, A. Reyes, Jr., J.
Facts: On November 26, 2013, the City Council of Manila
passed Ordinance No. 8331, entitled "An Ordinance Enacting
the 2013 Omnibus Revenue Code of the City of Manila." It was
approved by Mayor Joseph Ejercito Estrada on December 3,
2013, and thereafter published in the Manila Times and Manila
Standard on December 6, 7, and 8, 2013. The Ordinance took
effect on December 9, 2013 and implemented by the City of
Manila (respondent) on January 2, 2014.
On January 6, 2014, operators of retail businesses in the
City of Manila-Mandurriao Star, Inc., Metro Manila Shopping
Mecca Corporation, SM Mart, Inc., Supervalue, Inc., and
Super Shopping Market, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as retail
business operators) filed an Appeal before Secretary of Justice
Leila M. De Lima (petitioner). Therein, the retail business
operators claimed that Section 104 of Ordinance No. 8331,
which imposed percentage tax on gross sales of retailers from
1% to 3%, is unconstitutional for being violative of Section 5,
Article X of the Constitution, and illegal for being excessive
and contrary to limitations set forth under Sections 130, 186,
and 191 of the Local Government Code of 1991 LG).
The retail business operators allege that the respondent
City of Manila increased the local business tax rates from
0.20% to 3% and 1% which is beyond the 10% limit on increase
provided under Sec. 191 0f the LGC.

Ruling: Since the respondent has already exercised its
taxing power under the LGC with the enactment of Ordinance
No. 7807, any subsequent increase would therefore have to
comply with Section 191 which limits the amount of adjustment
to not more than ten percent (10%) of the rates fixed under the
LGC and should be no more frequent than once every five (5)
years.
With the rates set by Section 143, upon tax on gross sales,
the maximum adjusted tax rate that can be imposed after the
initial implementation of the LGC, taking into consideration
Section 191, would be as follows:

Ordinance No. 8331 is invalid insofar as it imposes
more than the allowed adjustment for gross receipts or sales
amounting to Php 50,000.00 up to Php 400,000.00.
The Court is mindful that the interval of time between the
two ordinances is 20 years, Ordinance No. 7807 having been
enacted in 1993, and Ordinance No. 8331 in 2013. However,
this does not justify the accumulation of allowable increases
and then their subsequent one-time imposition. The option to
increase the tax rates under the LGC arises every five (5) years
reckoned from the enactment of the ordinance sought to be
adjusted. The decision of whether or not to exercise such option
falls upon the LGU, through their respective sanggunian
taking into consideration the status of each industry balanced
with the needs of their respective territory.
Judgment is hereby rendered DECLARING Section 104
of Ordinance No. 8331, series of 2013, NULL and VOID insofar
as it imposes more than 2.20% tax rate on gross receipts on
sales amounting to Php 50,000.00 up to Php 400,000.00.

Decided Cases

PHILIPPINE RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVES
ASSOCIATION, INC. v. SECRETARY
403 SCRA 558, June 10, 2003, Pun0, J.
Facts: On May 23, 2000, a class suit was filed by petitioners
in their own behalf and in behalf of other electric cooperatives
organized and existing under P.D. No. 269 who are members of
petitioner Philippine Rural Electric Cooperatives Association,
Inc. (PHILRECA). Petitioner PHILRECA is an association of
119 electric cooperatives throughout the country. Petitioners
Agusan de! Norte Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ANECO), Iloilo
I Electric Cooperative, Inc. (ILECO I) and lsabela I Electric
Cooperative, Inc. (ISELCO I) are non-stock, non-profit electric
cooperatives organized and existing under P.D. No. 269, as
amended, and registered with the National Electrification
Administration (NEA).
Petitioners contend that pursuant to the provisions of
P.D. No. 269, as amended, and the above-mentioned provision
in the loan agreements, they are exempt from payment of
local taxes, including payment of real property tax. With the
passage of the Local Government Code, however, they allege
that their tax exemptions have been invalidly withdrawn.
In particular, petitioners assail Sections 193 and 234 of the
Local Government Code on the ground that the said provisions
discriminate against them, in violation of the equal protection
clause. Further, they submit that the said provisions are
unconstitutional because they impair the obligation of
contracts between the Philippine Government and the United
States Government.

Ruling: The pertinent parts of Sections 193 and 234 of
the Local Government Code provide:
Section 193. Withdrawal ofTax Exemption Privileges.Unless otherwise provided in this Code, tax exemptions or
incentives granted to, or presently enjoyed by all persons,
whether natural or juridical, including government-owned

434

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

and controlled corporations, except local water districts,
cooperatives duly registered under R.A. No. 6938,
non-stock and non-profit hospitals and educational
institutions, are hereby withdrawn upon the effectivity
of this Code.
Section 234. Exemptions from real property tax.The
following are exempted from payment of the real property tax:
(d) All real property owned by duly registered
cooperatives as provided for under R.A. No. 6938;
and xx x
We hold that there is reasonable classification under the
Local Government Code to justify the different tax treatment
between electric cooperatives covered by P.D. No. 269, as
amended, and electric cooperatives under R.A. No. 6938.
First, substantial distinctions exist between cooperatives
under P.D. No. 269, as amended, and cooperatives under
R.A. No. 6938. These distinctions are manifest in at least two
material respects which go into the nature of cooperatives
envisioned by R.A. No. 6938 and which characteristics are not
present in the type of cooperative associations created under
P.D. No. 269, as amended.
Nowhere in P.D. No. 269, as amended, does it require
cooperatives to make equitable contributions to capital.
Petitioners themselves admit that to qualify as a member of
an electric cooperative under P.D. No. 269, only the payment
of a P5.00 membership fee is required which is even refundable
the moment the member is no longer interested in getting
electric service from the cooperative or will transfer to another
place outside the area covered by the cooperative. However,
under the Cooperative Code, the articles of cooperation of a
cooperative applying for registration must be accompanied with
the bonds of the accountable officers and a sworn statement of
the treasurer elected by the subscribers showing that at least
twenty-five per cent (25%) of the authorized share capital has
been subscribed and at least twenty-five per cent (25%) of the
total subscription has been paid and in no case shall the paidup share capital be less than Two thousand pesos (P2,000.00).
Under the charter of the CDA, or the primary government
agency tasked to promote and regulate the institutional

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One Local Government Taxation

435

development of cooperatives, it is the declared policy of the
State that:
[g]overnment assistance to cooperatives shall be
free from any restriction and conditionality that
may in any manner infringe upon the objectives and
character of cooperatives as provided in this Act. The State
shall, except as provided in this Act, maintain the policy
of noninterference in the management and operation of
cooperatives.
In contrast, P.D. No. 269, as amended by P.D. No. 1645,
is replete with provisions which grant the NEA, upon the
happening of certain events, the power to control and take over
the management and operations of cooperatives registered
under it.
The withdrawal by the Local Government Code under
Sections 193 and 234 of the tax exemptions previously enjoyed
by petitioners does not impair the obligation of the borrower,
the lender or the beneficiary under the loan agreements
executed by the NEA as borrower and USAID as lender, as in
fact, no tax exemption is granted therein.
The instant petition is DENIED.
2.
As SMAR T's franchise was made effective on March 27,
1992-after the effectivity of the LGC
S ection 193 will therefore
not apply in this case. But while Section 193 of the LGC will not
affect the claimed tax exemption under SMAR T's franchise, it is still
liable to pay local franchise and business taxes.
CITY OF ILOILO v. SMAR T COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
580 SCRA 332, February 27, 2009, Brion, J.
Facts: SMAR T received a letter of assessment dated
February 12, 2002 from petitioner City of Iloilo requiring it
to pay deficiency local franchise and business taxes (in the
amount of P764,545.29, plus interests and surcharges) which
it incurred for the years 1997 to 2001. SMAR T protested the
assessment by sending a letter dated February 15, 2002 to the
City Treasurer. It claimed exemption from payment of local
franchise and business taxes based on Section 9 of its legislative
franchise under Republic At (R.A.) No. 7294 (SMART's
franchise). Under SMAR T's franchise, it was required to pay

436

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

a franchise tax equivalent to 3% of all gross receipts, which
amount shall be in lieu of all taxes. SMAR T contends that the
"in lieu of all taxes" clause covers local franchise and business
taxes.
SMAR T similarly invoked R.A. No. 7925 or the
Public Telecommunications Policy Act (Public Telecoms
Act) whose Section 23 declares that any existing privilege,
incentive, advantage, or exemption grunted under existing
franchises shall ipso facto become part of previously grantedtelecommunications franchise. SMAR T contends that by virtue
of Section 23, tax exemptions granted by the legislature to other
holders of telecommunications franchise may be extended to
and availed ofby SMAR T.
Ruling: The petitioner posits that SMAR T's claim for
exemption under its franchise is not equivocal enough to
prevail over the specific grant of power to local government
units to exact taxes from businesses operating within its
territorial jurisdiction under Section 137 in relation to Section
151 of the LGC. More importantly, it claimed that exemptions
from taxation have already been removed by Section 193 of the
LGC.
We have indeed ruled that by virtue of Section 193 of the
LGC, all tax exemption privileges then enjoyed by all persons,
save those expressly mentioned, have been withdrawn effective
January 1, 1992the date of effectivity of the LGC. The first
clause of Section 137 of the LGC states the same rule. However,
the withdrawal of exemptions, whether under Section 193 or
137 of the LGC, pertains only to those already existing when
the LGC was enacted. The intention of the legislature was to
remove all tax exemptions or incentives granted prior to the
LGC. As SMAR T's franchise was made effective on March
27, 1992-after the effectivity of the LGC- Section 193 will
therefore not apply in this case.
But while Section 193 of the LGC will not affect the
claimed tax exemption under SMAR T's franchise, we fail to
find a categorical and encompassing grant of tax exemption to
SMAR T covering exemption from both national and local taxes:
R.A. No. 7294 does not expressly provide what kind of
taxes SMAR T is exempted from. It is not clear whether the "in
lieu of all taxes" provision in the franchise of SMAR T would
include exemption from local or national taxation. What is

Book II-- Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One Local Government Taxation

437

clear is that SMAR T shall pay franchise tax equivalent to three
percent (3%) of all gross receipts of the business transacted
under its franchise. But whether the franchise tax exemption
would include exemption from exactions by both the local and
the national government is not unequivocal.
Nothing is mentioned in Section 9 about local taxes. The
clear intent is for the "in lieu of all taxes" clause to apply only
to taxes under the National Internal Revenue Code and not to
local taxes. SMAR T's claim for exemption from local business
and franchise taxes based on Section 9 of its franchise is
therefore unfounded.
SMAR T additionally invokes the "equality clause" under
Section 23 of the Public Telecoms Act. Whether Section 23 of
the cited law extends tax exemptions granted by Congress to
new franchise holders to existing ones has been answered in
the negative in the case of PLDT v. City of Davao. The term
"exemption" in Section 23 of the Public Telecoms Act does
not mean tax exemption; rather, it refers to exemption from
certain regulatory or reporting requirements imposed by
government agencies such as the National Telecommunications
Commission.
We hereby GRANT the petition and REVERSE the
decision of the RTC and find SMAR T liable to pay the local
franchise and business taxes amounting to P764,545.29,
assessed against it by petitioner, plus the surcharges and
interest due thereon.

Decided Cases

1.
Petitioner should have, following Section 195, LGC either
appealed the assessment before the court of competent jurisdiction
or paid the tax and then sought a refund. Mandamus cannot lie to
compel the City Treasurer to accept as full compliance a tax payment
which in his reasoning and assessment is deficient and incorrect.
SAN JUAN v. CASTRO
541 SCRA 526, December 27, 2007, Carpio-Morales, J.
Facts: Romulo D. San Juan (petitioner), registered owner
of real properties in Rancho Estate I, Concepcion II, Marikina
City covered by TCT's with the consent of his wife, conveyed
on August 24, 2004, by Deed of Assignment, the properties
to the Saints and Angels Realty Corporation (SARC), then
under the process of incorporation, in exchange for 258,434
shares of stock therein with a total par value of P2,584,340.
Two hundred thousand (200,000) of the said shares of stock
with a par value of P2,000,000 were placed in San Juan's name
while the remaining 58,434 shares of stock with a par value
of P584,340 were placed in the name of his wife. On June 24,
2005, the SEC approved the Articles of Incorporation of SARC.
Respondent's representative thereafter went to the Office
of the Marikina City Treasurer to pay the transfer tax based
on the consideration stated in the Deed of Assignment. Ricardo
L. Castro (respondent), the City Treasurer, informed him,
however, that the tax due is based on the fair market value of
the property.

Ruling: Under Section 195 of the Local Government Code
which is quoted immediately below, a taxpayer who disagrees
with a tax assessment made by a local treasurer may file a
written protest thereof:
SECTION 195. Protest of Assessment. Wh en the
local treasurer or his duly authorized representative
finds that the correct taxes, fees, or charges have not been

440

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

paid, he shall issue a notice of assessment stating the
nature of the tax, fee, or charge, the amount of deficiency,
the surcharges, interests and penalties. Within sixty
(60) days from the receipt of the notice of assessment,
the taxpayer may file a written protest with the local
treasurer contesting the assessment; otherwise, the
assessment shall become final and executory. The local
treasurer shall decide the protest within sixty (60) days
from the time of its filing. If the local treasurer finds the
protest to be wholly or partly meritorious, he shall issue
a notice cancelling wholly or partially the assessment.
However, if the local treasurer finds the assessment to be
wholly or partly correct, he shall deny the protest wholly
or partly with notice to the taxpayer. The taxpayer
shall have thirty (30) days from the receipt of the
denial of the protest or from the lapse of the sixtyday (60) period prescribed herein within which to
appeal with the court of competent jurisdiction,
otherwise the assessment becomes conclusive and

unappealable.
Petitioner should thus have, following the earlier abovequoted Section 195 of the Local Government Code, either
appealed the assessment before the court of competent
jurisdiction or paid the tax and then sought a refund.
Petitioner did not observe any of these remedies available
to him, however. He instead opted to file a petition for
mandamus to compel respondent to accept payment of transfer
tax as computed by him.
Mandamus lies only to compel an officer to perform a
ministerial duty (one which is so clear and specific as to leave
no room for the exercise of discretion in its performance) but
not a discretionary function (one which by its nature requires
the exercise of judgment). Respondent's argument that "[m]
andamus cannot lie to compel the City Treasurer to accept
as full compliance a tax payment which in his reasoning and
assessment is deficient and incorrect" is thus persuasive.
The petition is DENIED.

2.
On March 8, 2007, or exactly thirty (30) days from its
receipt of the denial, respondent brought the action before the RTC
of Manila. Hence, respondent was justified in filing a claim for
refund after timely protesting and paying the assessment.

CITY TREASURER OF MANILA v. PHILIPPINE
BEVERAGE PARTNERS, INC.
G.R. No. 233556, September 11, 2019, Reyes, J. Jr., J.
Facts: On January 17, 2007, the petitioner City Treasurer
of Manila issued a Statement of Account (SOA) under Bill
No. 012007-33025 to Philippine Beverage Partners, Inc.
(respondent). The SOA showed that respondent is liable to pay
petitioner local business taxes and regulatory fees for the first
quarter of 2007 in the total amount of P2,930,239.82.
Ruling: In this case, after respondent received the
assessment on January 17, 2007, it protested such assessment
on January 19, 2007. After payment of the assessed taxes and
charges, respondent wrote petitioner another letter asking for
the refund and reiterating the grounds raised in the protest
letter. Then, on February 6, 2007, respondent received the
letter denying its protest.
On March 8, 2007, or exactly thirty (30) days from its
receipt of the denial, respondent brought the action before the
RTC of Manila. Hence, respondent was justified in filing a claim
for refund after timely protesting and paying the assessment.

As regards the second issue, Section 195 of the LGC
provides that "When the local treasurer or his duly authorized
representative finds that correct taxes, fees, or charges have
not been paid, he shall issue a notice of assessment stating the
nature of the tax, fee, or charge, the amount of deficiency, the
surcharges, interests and penalties." Thus, suffice it to say that
the issuance of a notice of assessment is mandatory before the
local treasurer may collect deficiency taxes from the taxpayer.
The notice of assessment is not only a requirement of due
process but it also stands as the first instance the taxpayer
is officially made aware of the pending tax liability. The local
treasurer cannot simply collect deficiency taxes for a different
taxing period by raising it as a defense in an action for refund
of erroneously or illegally collected taxes.

To reiterate, respondent, after it had protested and paid
the assessed tax, is permitted by law to seek a refund having
fully satisfied the twin conditions for prosecuting an action for
refund before the court.
Consequently, the CTA did not commit a reversible error
when it allowed the refund in favor of respondent.
WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED for lack of merit.
The Decision and Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals are
hereby AFFIRMED.
SEC. 196. Claim for Refund of Tax Credit.No case or proceeding shall be maintained in any
court for the recovery of any tax, fee, or charge
erroneously or illegally collected until a written
claim for refund or credit has been filed with the
local treasurer. No case or proceeding shall be
entertained in any court after the expiration of
two (2) years from the date of the payment of such
tax, fee, or charge, or from the date the taxpayer is
entitled to a refund or credit.
A.

Decided Cases

1.
While the case or proceeding for refund was filed by
petitioners within two (2) years from the time of payment, they,
however, failed to prove that they have fled a written claim for
refund with the local treasurer.
METRO MANILA SHOPPING MECCA
CORP. v. TOLEDO
697 SCRA 425, June 5, 2013, Perlas-Bernabe, J.
Facts: Sometime in October 2001, respondent Liberty

M. Toledo, as Treasurer of respondent City of Manila (City),
assessed petitioners Metro Manila Shopping Mecca Corp., et.
al. for their fourth quarter local business taxes pursuant to
Section 21 of City Ordinance No. 7794, as amended by City
Ordinance Nos. 7807, 7988, and 8011, otherwise known as
the "Revenue Code of the City of Manila". Consequently, on
October 20, 2001, petitioners paid the total assessed amount of
P5,104,281.26 under protest.
In a letter dated October 19, 2001, petitioners informed
the Office of the City Treasurer of Manila of the nature of the

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One Local Government Taxation

443

foregoing payment, assailing as well the unconstitutionality
of Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code. Petitioners' protest
was however denied on October 25, 2001.
On October 20, 2003, petitioners filed a case with the
RTC of Manila against respondents, reiterating their claim
that Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code is null and void.
Accordingly, they sought the refund of the amount of local
business taxes they previously paid to the City, plus interest.
Ruling: A perusal of Section 196 of the LGC reveals
that in order to be entitled to a refund/credit of local taxes,
the following procedural requirements must concur: first, the
taxpayer concerned must file a written claim for refund/credit
with the local treasurer; and second, the case or proceeding for
refund has to be filed within two (2) years from the date of the
payment of the tax, fee, or charge or from the date the taxpayer
is entitled to a refund or credit.
Records disclose that while the case or proceeding for
refund was filed by petitioners within two (2) years from the
time of payment, they, however, failed to prove that they
have filed a written claim for refund with the local treasurer
considering that such fact-although subject of their Request
for Admission which respondents did not reply to---had already
been controverted by the latter in their Motion to Dismiss and
Answer.
Records show that petitioners filed their Request
for Admission with the RTC and also served the same on
respondents, requesting that the fact that they filed a written
claim for refund with the City Treasurer of Manila be admitted.
Respondents, however, did not-and in fact, need not-reply
to the same considering that they have already stated in their
Motion to Dismiss and Answer that petitioners failed to file
any written claim for tax refund or credit. In this regard,
respondents are not deemed to have admitted the truth and
veracity of petitioners' requested fact.
Indeed, it is hornbook principle that a claim for a tax
refund/credit is in the nature of a claim for an exemption
and the law is construed in strictissimi juris against the one
claiming it and in favor of the taxing authority. Consequently,
as petitioners have failed to prove that they have complied

444

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

with the procedural requisites stated under Section 196 of the
LGC, their claim for local tax refund/credit must be dented.
The petition is DENIED.
2.
In local taxation, an assessment for deficiency taxes
made by the local government unit may be protested before the
local treasurer without necessity of payment under protest. But if
payment is made simultaneous with or following a protest against
an assessment, the taxpayer may subsequently maintain an act1on
in court, whether as an appeal from assessment or a claim for refund,
so long as it is initiated within thirty (30) days from either decision or
inaction of the local treasurer on the protest. Here, Cosmos brought
the action before the RTC exactly 30 days from receipt of the denial.
CITY OF MANILA v. COSMOS BOTTLING
CORPORATION
G.R. No. 196681, June 27, 2018, Martirez, J.
Facts: For the first quarter of 2007, the City of Manila
assessed Cosmos Bottling Corporation local business taxes
and regulatory fees in the total amount of P1,226,781.05, as
contained in the Statement of Account dated January 15,
2007. Cosmos protested the assessment through a letter dated
January 18, 2007, arguing that Tax Ordinance Nos. 7988 and
8011, amending the Revenue Code of Manila (RCM), have been
declared null and void. [Cosmos] also argued that the collection
of local business tax under Section 21 of the RCM in addition to
Section 14 of the same code constitutes double taxation.
Cosmos also tendered payment of only P131,994.23 which
they posit is the correct computation of their local business tax
for the first quarter of 2007. This payment was refused by the
City Treasurer. Cosmos also received a letter from the City
Treasurer denying their protest.
Cosmos motion for partial reconsideration was also
denied, hence, [the] Petition for Review [before the CTA].
Ruling: While the City of Manila could impose against
Cosmos a manufacturer's tax under Section 14 of Ordinance
No. 7794, or the Revenue Code of Manila, it cannot at the
same time impose the tax under Section 21 of the same code;
otherwise, an obnoxious double taxation would set in. The
petitioners erroneously argue that double taxation is wanting
for the reason that the tax imposed under Section 21 is

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One - Local Government Taxation

445

imposed on a different object and of a different nature as that
in Section 14. The argument is not novel. In The City ofManila
v. Coca-Cola Bottlers, Inc. (2009), 650 Phil. 143 (2010) the
Court explained- "When a municipality or city has already
imposed a business tax on manufacturers, etc. of liquors, etc.
pursuant to Sec. 143 (a), LGC, said municipality or city may
longer subject the same manufacturers, etc., to a business tax
under Sec. 143 (h) of the same Code."
In reality, Cosmos, being a manufacturer of beverages,
is similarly situated with Coca-Cola Bottlers, Inc. in the
cited cases, with the difference only in the taxable periods of
assessment. Thus, given that Cosmos is already paying taxes
under Section 14, of the Revenue Code of Manila (just like
Coca-Cola), it is not totally misplaced to consider the additional
imposition of a tax under Section 21 as constituting double
taxation, therefore excessive, warranting its refund to Cosmos
as the CTA Division has correctly ordered.
The taxpayers' remedies of protesting an assessment and
refund of taxes are stated in Sections 195 and 196 of the LGC.
Where an assessment is to be protested or disputed, the
taxpayer may proceed (a) without payment, or (b) with payment
of the assessed tax, fee or charge. Whether there is payment of
the assessed tax or not, it is clear that the protest in writing
must be made within sixty (60) days from receipt of the notice
of assessment; otherwise, the assessment shall become final
and conclusive. Additionally, the subsequent court action must
be initiated within thirty (30) days from denial or inaction by
the local treasurer; otherwise, the assessment becomes
conclusive and unappealable.
(a) Where no paym ent is made, the taxpayer's
procedural remedy is governed strictly by Section 195.
That is, in case of whole or partial denial of the protest,
or inaction by the local treasurer, the taxpayer's only
recourse is to appeal the assessment with the court
of competent jurisdiction. The appeal before the court
does not seek a refund but only questions the validity or
correctness of the assessment.
(b) Where payment was made, the taxpayer may
thereafter maintain an action in court questioning the
validity and correctness of the assessment (Section 195,
LGC) and at the same time seeking a refund of the taxes.

446

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

In truth, it would be illogical for the taxpayer to only
seek a reversal of the assessment without praying for the
refund of taxes. Once the assessment is set aside by the
court, it follows as a matter of course that all taxes paid
under the erroneous or invalid assessment are refunded
to the taxpayer.
Equally important is the institution of the judicial action
for refund within thirty (30) days from the denial of or
inaction on the letter-protest or claim, not any time later,
even if within two (2) years from the date of payment (as
expressly stated in Section 196). Notice that the filing of such
judicial claim for refund after questioning the assessment is
within the two-year prescriptive period specified in Section 196.
Note too that the filing date of such judicial action necessarily
falls on the beginning portion of the two-year period from the
date of payment. Even though the suit is seemingly grounded
on Section 196, the taxpayer could not avail of the full
extent of the two-year period within which to initiate
the action in court.
In this case, after Cosmos received the assessment
of Toledo on 15 January 2007, it forthwith protested such
assessment through a letter dated 18 January 2007. Constrained
to pay the assessed taxes and charges, Cosmos subsequently
wrote the Office of the City Treasurer another letter asking for
the refund and reiterating the grounds raised in the previous
submitted protest letter. In the meantime, Cosmos received on
6 February 2007 the letter of Toledo denying its protest. Thus,
on 8 March 2007, or exactly thirty (30) days from its receipt
of the denial, Cosmos brought the action before the RTC of
Manila.
The petition is DENIED for lack of merit.
3.
Petitioner's failure to file written claims of refund for all
of the taxes under Section 21(A) with respondent City Treasurer is
warranted under the circumstances.
INTERNATIONAL CONTAINER TERMINAL
SERVICES, INC. v. THE CITY OF MAN ILA
G.R. No. 185622, October 17, 2018, Leonen, J.
Facts: International Container, a corporation with its
principal place of business in Manila, renewed its business
license for 1999. It was assessed for two (2) business taxes: one

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title One Local Government Taxation

447

for which it was already paying, and another for which it was
newly assessed. It was already paying a local annual business
tax for contractors equivalent to 75% of 1 % of its gross receipts
for the preceding calendar year pursuant to Section 18 of
Manila Ordinance No. 7794. The newly assessed business tax
wss computed at 50% of 1 % of its gross receipts for the previous
calendar year, pursuant to Section 21 (A) of Manila Ordinance
No. 7794, as amended by Section 1(G) of Manila Ordinance
No. 7807. It paid the additional assessment, but filed a protest
letter dated July 15, 1999 before the City Treasurer of Manila.
When the City Treasurer failed to decide International
Container's protest within 60 days from the protest,
International Container filed before the RTC of Manila its
Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition against the City
Treasurer and Resident Auditor of Manila. The City Treasurer
and the Resident Auditor of Manila moved for the dismissal
of the Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition on the ground
that International Container had no cause of action, since it
had failed to comply with the requirements of Section 187 of
Republic Act No. 7160, LGC.
Ruling: When petitioner paid these taxes and filed
written claims for refund before respondent City Treasurer, the
subsequent denial of these claims should have prompted resort
to the remedy laid down in Section 196, specifically the filing
of a judicial case for the recovery of the allegedly erroneous or
illegally collected tax within the two (2)-year period.
Petitioner appealed the denial of the protest against
respondent City Treasurer's assessment and the action against
the denial of its claims for refund. For both issues, petitioner's
arguments are based on the common theory that the additional
tax under Section 21 (A) of Manila Ordinance No. 7794, as
amended by Section 1(G) of Manila Ordinance No. 7807, is
illegal double taxation. Hence, their joinder in one (1) suit was
legally appropriate and avoided a multiplicity of suits.

As correctly pointed out by petitioner, the filing of written
claims with respondent City Treasurer for every collection
of tax under Section 21 (A) of Manila Ordinance No. 7764,
as amended by Section 1(G) of Ordinance No. 7807, would
have yielded the same result every time. This is bolstered
by respondent City Treasurer's September 1, 2005 Letter, in
which it stated that it could not act favorably on petitioner's

448

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

claim for refund until there would have been a final judicial
determination of the invalidity of Section 21 (A).
Further, the issue at the core of petitioner's claims for
refund, the validity of Section 21 (A) of Manila Ordinance
No. 7794, as amended by Section l(G) of Manila Ordinance
No. 7807, is a question of law. When the issue raised by the
taxpayer is purely legal and there is no question concerning
the reasonableness of the amount assessed, then there is no
need to exhaust administrative remedies.
Petitioner's failure to file written claims of refund for all of
the taxes under Section 21 (A) with respondent City Treasurer
is warranted under the circumstances.
Similarly, petitioner complied with the second
requirement under Section 196 of the Local Government Code
that it must file its judicial action for refund within two (2)
years from the date of payment, or the date that the taxpayer
is entitled to the refund or credit. Among the reliefs it sought
in its Amended and Supplemental Petition before the Regional
Trial Court is the refund of any and all subsequent payments
of taxes under Section 21 (A) from the time of the filing of its
Petition until the finality of the case:

As acknowledged by respondent City Treasurer in her
September 1, 2005 Letter, petitioner's entitlement to the
refund would only arise upon a judicial declaration of the
invalidity of Section 21 (A) of Manila Ordinance No. 7794,
as amended by Section 1(G) of Manila Ordinance No. 7807.
This only took place when the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc
dismissed respondents' Petition for Review of the May 17,
2006 Decision of the Court of Tax Appeals Second Division,
rendering the judgment on the invalidity of Section 21 (A) final
and executory on July 2, 2007. Therefore, the judicial action for
petitioner's claim for refund had not yet expired as of the filing
of the Amended and Supplemental Petition.
The Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The
Decision and Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals are hereby
REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Court of Tax Appeals En
Banc is DIRECTED to proceed with the resolution on the
merits of C.T.A. EB No. 277 with due and deliberate dispatch.

A.

Decided Case

1.
Submarine or undersea communications cables are akin
to electric transmission lines which this Court has recently declared
in Manila Electric Company v. City Assessor and City Treasurer of
Lucena City, as "no longer exempted from real property tax" and
may qualify as "machinery" subject to real property tax under the
Local Government Code.

CAPITOL WIRELESS, INC. v. THE PROVINCIAL
TREASURER OF BATANGAS
791 SCRA 272, May 30, 2016, Peralta, J.
Facts: Petitioner Capitol Wireless Inc. (Capwire)
is a Philippine corporation in the business of providing
international telecommunications services. Capwire has signed
agreements with other local and foreign telecommunications
companies covering an international network of submarine
cable systems such as the Asia Pacific Cable Network System
(APCN). The agreements provide for co-ownership and other
rights among the parties over the network.
Petitioner Capwire claims that it is co-owner only of the socalled "Wet Segment" of the APCN, while the landing stations
or terminals and Segment E of APCN located in Nasugbu,
Batangas are allegedly owned by the PLDT. Moreover, it
alleges that the Wet Segment is laid in international, and not
Philippine, waters.
The Provincial Assessor had determined that the
submarine cable systems described in Capwire's Sworn

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Two Real Property Taxation

453

Statement of True Value of Real Properties are taxable real
property.

Ruling: Submarine or undersea communications cables
are akin to electric transmission lines which this Court has
recently declared in Manila Electric Company v. City Assessor
and City Treasurer of Lucena City, G.R. No. 166102 (Aug. 5,
2015) as "no longer exempted from real property tax" and may
qualify as "machinery" subject to real property tax under the
Local Government Code. To the extent that the equipment's
location is determinable to be within the taxin g authority's
jurisdiction, the Court sees no reason to distinguish between
submarine cables used for communications and aerial or
underground wires or lines used for electric transmission, so
that both pieces of property do not merit a different treatment
in the aspect of real property taxation.
Thus, absent any showing from Capwire of any express
grant of an exemption for its lines and cables from real property
taxation, then this interpretation applies and Capwire's
submarine cable may be held subject to real property tax.

It is not in dispute that the submarine cable system's
Landing Station in Nasugbu, Batangas is owned by PLDT
and not by Capwire. Obviously, Capwire is not liable for
the real property tax on this Landing Station. Nonetheless,
Capwire admits that it co-owns the submarine cable system
that is subject of the tax assessed and being collected by public
respondents. As the Court takes judicial notice that Nasugbu
is a coastal town and the surrounding sea falls within what the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UN CLOS)
would define as the country's territorial sea (to the extent of 12
nautical miles outward from the nearest baseline, under Part
II, Sections 1 and 2) over which the country has sovereignty,
including the seabed and subsoil, it follows that indeed a
portion of the submarine cable system lies within Philippine
territory and thus falls within the jurisdiction of the said local
taxing authorities. It easily belies Capwire's contention that
the cable system is entirely in international waters.
And as far as local government units are concerned, the
areas described above are to be considered subsumed under the
term "municipal waters" which, under the Local Government
Code, Sec. 131 (r) includes "not only streams, lakes, and
tidal waters within the municipality, not being the subject

454

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

of private ownership and not comprised within the national
parks, public forest, timber lands, forest reserves or fishery
reserves, but also marine waters included between two lines
drawn perpendicularly to the general coastline from points
where the boundary lines of the municipality or city touch
the sea at low tide and a third line parallel with the general
coastline and fifteen (15) kilometers from it." Although the
term "municipal waters" appears in the Code in the context
of the grant of quarrying and fisheries privileges for a fee by
local governments, its inclusion in the Code's Book II which
covers local taxation means that it may also apply as guide
in determining the territorial extent of the local authorities'
power to levy real property taxation.
Even under Capwire's legislative franchise, RA 4387,
which amended RA 2037, where it may be derived that there
was a grant of real property tax exemption for properties
that are part of its franchise, or directly meet the needs of its
business, such had been expressly withdrawn by the Local
Government Code, which took effect on January 1, 1992, under
Sections 193 and 234.
The petition is DENIED. The Court of Appeals' Decision
dated May 30, 2007 and Resolution dated October 8. 2007
dismissing Capwires' appeal of the RTC decision dismissing
Capwires' Petition are AFFIRMED.

Section 206 of the LGC categorically provides that every
person claiming exemption from real property taxes shall file with
the provincial, city or municipal assessor sufficient documentary
evidence in support of such claim. The burden of proving exemption
is upon whom the subject real property is declared. NPC's failure to
comply with the mandatory requirement of payment under protest
in accordance with Section 252 of the LGC was fatal to its appeal.
NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v.
PROVINCIAL TREASURER OF BENGUET
808 SCRA 595, November 14, 2016, Peralta, J.
Facts: NPC is a GOCC existing under R.A. No. 6395
with principal office address at NPC Office Building Complex,
Diliman, Quezon City. NPC was created to undertake the
development of power generation and production from
hydroelectric or other sources, and may undertake the
construction, operation and maintenance of power plants,
dams, reservoirs, and other works. It operates and maintains
the Binga Hydro-Electric Power Plant.

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Respondents Provincial Treasurer, et. al. are representatives
of the province of Benguet, a local government unit. Respondents
issued the subject assessment in their official capacities.
Sometime in May 2000, the Municipal Assessor of Itogon,
Benguet assessed NPC P62,645,668.80 real property tax for
the properties located within the Binga Hydro-Electric Power
Plant:
Ruling: Section 206 of the LGC categorically provides
that every person by or for whom real property is declared,
who shall claim exemption from payment of real property taxes
imposed against said property, shall file with the provincial,
city or municipal assessor sufficient documentary evidence
in support of such claim. The burden of proving exemption
from local taxation is upon whom the subject real property
is declared. By providing that real property not declared and
proved as tax-exempt shall be included in the assessment roll,
the above quoted provision implies that the local assessor
has the authority to assess the property for realty taxes, and
any subsequent claim for exemption shall be allowed only
when sufficient proof has been adduced supporting the claim.
Thus, if the property being taxed has not been dropped from
the assessment roll, taxes must be paid under protest if the
exemption from taxation is insisted upon.
The two letters requesting exemption from payment
of realty tax dated September 3, 2000 and April 19, 2001
addressed to respondent Municipal Assessor were filed beyond
the required thirty (30)-day period from the declaration of the
subject properties for realty tax purposes in May 2000. There
is also no showing that petitioner submitted together with the
said formal requests sufficient documents in support of such
claim. Significantly, in the proceedings below, respondents
categorically stated that petitioner failed to prove its claimed
tax exemption.
Based on the foregoing backdrop and the above-cited
jurisprudence, it is evident that NPC's failure to comply with
the mandatory requirement of payment under protest in
accordance with Section 252 of the LGC was fatal to its appeal.
The petition is DENIED for lack of merit. The CTA
Decision is AFFIRMED. The case is REMAN DED to the Local
Board of Assessment Appeals for further proceedings subject to
payment under protest of the assailed assessment.

the Assessor of Real Property Listed in Registry.
(a) To ascertain whether or not any real property

the Registrar of Deeds shall prepare and submit to
the provincial, city or municipal assessor, within
six (6) months from the date of effectivity of this

1.
Publication or posting of proposed fair market values of
real property by the local government unit is required.
FIGUERRES v. CA
305 SCRA 206, March 25, 1999, Mendoza, J.
Facts: (Supra)
Held: Petitioner is also right that publication or posting
of the proposed schedule of fair market values of the different
classes of real property in a local government unit is required
pursuant to R.A. No. 7160, Sec. 212. However, petitioner has
not presented any evidence to show that the subject ordinances
were not disseminated in accordance with these provisions
of R.A. No. 7160. On the other hand, the Municipality of
Mandaluyong presented a certificate, dated November 12,
1993, of Williard S. Wong, Sanggunian Secretary of the
Municipality of Mandaluyong that "Ordinance No. 125, S-1993
... has been posted in accordance with Section 59(b) of R.A.
No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of
1991." Thus, considering the presumption of validity in favor
of the ordinances and the failure of petitioner to rebut such
presumption, we are constrained to dismiss the petition in this
case.
2.
The schedule of values of real properties prepared solely
by the respondent municipal assessor in Pasig, Metro Manila
is illegal and void. The schedule must be prepared jointly by the
assessors in the district (Metropolitan Manila).

Facts: On 06 January 1994, respondent Assessor sent
a notice of assessment respecting certain real properties
of petitioners located in Pasig, Metro Manila. In a letter,
petitioners "request(ed) the Municipal Assessor to reconsider
the subject assessments."
Not satisfied, petitioners on 29 March 1994 fled with
the RTC of Pasig, Metro Manila a Petition for Prohibition to
declare null and void the new tax assessments and to enjoin
the collection of real estate taxes based on said assessments.

The court ruled that the schedule of market values and
the assessments based thereon prepared solely by respondent
assessor are valid and legal, they having been prepared in
accordance with the provisions of Sec. 212 of R.A. 7160. It
held also that said Code had effectively repealed the previous
law on the matter, Sec. 9 of P.D. 921, which required, in the
preparation of said schedule, joint action by all the city and
municipal assessors in the Metropolitan Manila area.

By this harmonization, both the preamble of P.D. 921
decreeing that the real estate taxes shall "not unduly burden
the taxpayer" and the "operative principle of decentralization"
provided under Sec. 3, R.A. 7160 encouraging local government
units to "consolidate or coordinate their efforts, services and
resources" shall be fulfilled. Indeed, the essence of joint local
action for common good so cherished in the Local Government
Code finds concrete expression in this harmonization.

Held: Sec. 9 of P.D. 921 requires that the schedule of
values of real properties in the Metropolitan Manila Area shall
be prepared jointly by the city assessors in the districts created
therein; while Sec. 212 of R.A. 7160 states that the schedule
shall be prepared "by the provincial, city and municipal
assessors of the municipalities within the Metropolitan Manila
Area for the different classes of real property situated in their
respective local government units for enactment by ordinance
of the sanggunian concerned.

How about respondents' claim that with the express
repeal of P.D. 464, P.D. 921being merely a "supplement" of
said P.D. cannot "exist independently on its own"? Quite the
contrary is true. By harmonizing P.D. 921 with R.A. 7160, we
have just demonstrated that it can exist outside of P.D. 464, as
a support, supplement and extension of R.A. 7160, which for
this purpose, has replaced P.D. 464.

It is obvious that harmony in these provisions is not
only possible, but in fact desirable, necessary and consistent
with the legislative intent and policy. By reading together and
harmonizing these two (2) provisions, we arrive at the following
steps in the preparation of the said schedule, as follows:
1.
The assessor in each municipality or city in the
Metropolitan Manila area shall prepare his/her proposed
schedule of values, in accordance with Sec. 212, R.A. 7160.
2.
Then, the Local Treasury and Assessment
District shall meet, per Sec. 9, P.D. 921. In the instant
case, that district shall be composed of the assessors in
Quezon City, Pasig, Marikina, Mandaluyong and San
Juan, pursuant to Sec. 1 of said P.D. In this meeting,
the different assessors shall compare their individual
assessments, discuss and thereafter jointly agree and
produce a schedule of values for their district, taking
into account the preamble of said P.D., that they should
evolve "a progressive revenue raising program that will
not unduly burden the taxpayers."
3.
The schedule jointly agreed upon by the
assessors shall then be published in a newspaper of
general circulation and submitted to the Sanggunian
concerned for enactment by ordinance, per Sec. 212,
R.A. 7160.

Since it is now clear that P.D. 921 is still a good law,
it is equally clear that this Court's ruling in the Mathay/
Javier /Puyat-Reyes cases is still the prevailing and applicable
doctrine. And, applying the said ruling in the present case, it
is likewise clear that the schedule of values prepared solely by
the respondent municipal assessor is illegal and void.
SEC. 213.Authority ofAssessor to Take Evidence.
For the purpose of obtaining information on
which to base the market value of any real property,
the assessor of the province, city or municipality
or his deputy may summon the owners of the
properties to be affected or persons having legal
interest therein and witnesses, administer oaths,
and take deposition concerning the property, its
ownership, amount, nature and value.
SEC. 214. Amendment of Schedule of Fair
Market Values. The provincial, city or municipal
assessor may recommend to the sanggunian
concerned amendments to correct errors in
valuation in the schedule of fair market values.
The sanggunian concerned shall, by ordinance, act
upon the recommendation within ninety (90) days
from receipt thereof.
SEC. 215. Classes of Real Property for
Assessment Purposes• For purposes of assessment,
real property shall be classified as residential,

Facts: Before the Court is a Petition for Review on

Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court filed by Manila
Electric Company (MERALCO), seeking the reversal of the
CA Decision and Resolution. The CA affirmed the Decision
of the Central Board of Assessment Appeals (CBAA) which,
in turn, affirmed with modification the Decision of the Local
Board of Assessment Appeals (LBAA) of Lucena City, Quezon

Province, as regards Tax Declaration Nos. 019-6500 and 0197394, ruling that MERALCO is liable for real property tax on
its transformers, electric posts (or poles), transmission lines,
insulators, and electric meters, beginning 1992.
Ruling: The Court finds that the transformers, electric
posts, transmission lines, insulators, and electric meters of
MERAL CO are no longer exempted from real property tax
under Sec 193, LGC, and may qualify as "machinery" subject
to real property tax under the Local Government Code under
Sec 199 (o), LGC. Nevertheless, the Court declares null
and void the appraisal and assessment of said properties of
MERALCO by the City Assessor in 1997 for failure to comply
with the requirements of the Local Government Code and,
thus, violating the right ofMERAL CO to due process.
Section 252 of the Local Government Code mandates that
"[n]o protest shall be entertained unless the taxpayer first pays
the tax." It is settled that the requirement of "payment under
protest" is a condition sine qua non before an appeal may be
entertained. Clearly, under the Local Government Code, even
when the assessment of the real property is appealed, the real
property tax due on the basis thereof should be paid to and/or
collected by the local government unit concerned.
In the case at bar, the City Treasurer of Lucena, in his
letter dated October 16, 1997, sought to collect from MERAL CO
the amount of P17,925,117.34 as real property taxes on its
machineries, plus penalties, for the period of 1990 to 1997,
based on Tax Declaration Nos. 019-6500 and 019-7394 issued
by the City Assessor of Lucena. MERALCO appealed Tax
Declaration Nos. 019-6500 and 019-7394 with the LBAA, but
instead of paying the real property taxes and penalties due, it
posted a surety bond in the amount of P17,925,117.34.
By posting the surety bond, MERALCO may be considered
to have substantially complied with Section 252 of the Local
Government Code for the said bond already guarantees the
payment to the Office of the City Treasurer of Lucena of the
total amount of real property taxes and penalties due on Tax
Declaration Nos. 019-6500 and 019-7394.
Accordingly, the LBAA herein correctly took cognizance
of and gave due course to the appeal of Tax Declaration Nos.
019-6500 and 019-7394 filed by MERALCO.

470

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Sec. 223, LGC further mandates that the taxpayer be
given a notice of the assessment of real property. A notice of
assessment, which stands as the first instance the taxpayer
is officially made aware of the pending tax liability, should be
sufficiently informative to apprise the taxpayer the legal basis
of the tax.
The Notice of Assessment dated October 20, 1997 issued
by the City Assessor gave a summary of the new/revised
assessment of the "machinery" located in "Quezon Avenue Ext.,
Brgy. Gulang-Gulang, Lucena City," covered by Tax Declaration
No. 019-7394, with total market value of P98,173,200.00 and
total assessed value of P78,538,560.00. The Property Record
Form basically contained the same information. Without
specific description or identification of the machinery covered
by said tax declaration, said Notice of Assessment and Property
Record Form give the false impression that there is only one
piece of machinery covered.
The City Assessor of Lucena simply lumped together all
the transformers, electric posts, transmission lines, insulators,
and electric meters ofMERAL CO located in Lucena City under
Tax Declaration Nos. 019-6500 and 019.-7394, contrary to the
specificity demanded under Sections 224 and 225 of the Local
Government Code for appraisal and assessment of machinery.
The City Assessor and the City Treasurer of Lucena did not
even provide the most basic information such as the number
of transformers, electric posts, insulators, and electric
meters or the length of the transmission lines appraised and
assessed under Tax Declaration Nos. 019-6500 and 019-7394.
There is utter lack of factual basis for the assessment of the
transformers, electric posts, transmission lines, insulators,
and electric meters of MERAL CO.
The Court PARTLY GRANTS the instant Petition and
ORDERS the CANCELLATION of the collection letter and
the Notice of Assessment of the City Treasurer of Lucena, but
WITHOUT PREJUDICE to the conduct of a new appraisal
and assessment of the same properties by the City Assessor of
Lucena in accord with the provisions of the Local Government
Code and guidelines issued by the Bureau of Local Government
Financing.

Napocor is clearly not vested with the requisite interest
to protest the tax assessment, as it is not an entity having the legal
title over the machineries. The "action" referred to in Section 226
(in relation to a protest of real property tax assessment) thus refers
to the local assessor's act of denying the protest filed pursuant to
Section 252. Without the action of the local assessor, the appellate
authority of the LBAA cannot be invoked. Napocor's action before
the LBAA was thus prematurely filed.
NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v.
PROVINCE OF QUEZON
611 SCRA 71, January 25, 2010, Brion, J.
Facts: The Province of Quezon assessed Mirant Pagbilao
Corporation (Mirant) for unpaid real property taxes in the
amount of P1.5 Billion for the machineries located in its power
plant in Pagbilao, Quezon. Napocor, which entered into a
Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) Agreement (entitled Energy
Conversion Agreement) with Mirant, was furnished a copy of
the tax assessment.
Napocor protested the assessment before the Local
Board of Assessment Appeals (LBAA), claiming entitlement to
the tax exemptions provided under Section 234 of the Local
Government Code (LGC),
Ruling: A BOT agreement is not a mere financing
arrangement. In Napocor v. CBAA, 57 SCRA 418 (2009)- a
case strikingly similar to the one before us, we discussed the
nature of BOT agreements.
Under this BOT concept, it is the project proponent
who constructs the project at its own cost and subsequently
operates and manages it. The proponent secures the return on
its investments from those using the project's facilities through
appropriate tolls, fees, rentals, and charges not exceeding those
proposed in its bid or as negotiated. At the end of the fixed term
agreed upon, the project proponent transfers the ownership of
the facility to the government agency. Thus, the government is
able to put up projects and provide immediate services without
the burden of the heavy expenditures that a project start up
requires.

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Two Real Property Taxation

473

A reading of the provisions of the parties' BOT Agreement
shows that it fully conforms to this concept. By its express
terms, Bauang Private Power Corporation (located in
Bauang, La Union) (BPPC) has complete ownership-both legal and beneficial-of the project, including the
machineries and equipment used, subject only to the
transfer of these properties without cost to NAPOCOR
after the lapse of the period agreed upon.
Consistent with the BOT concept and as implemented,
BPPC-the owner-manager-operator of the project-is
the actual user ofits machineries and equipment. BPPC's
ownership and use of the machineries and equipment
are actual, direct, and imm ediate, while NAPOCOR's is
contingent and, at this stage of the BOT Agreement, not
sufficient to support its claim for tax exemption. Thus,
the CTA committed no reversible error in denying NAPOCOR's
claim for tax exemption.
It was an ill-advised move for Napocor to directly file an
appeal with the LBAA under Section 226.The "action" referred
to in Section 226 (in relation to a protest of real property tax
assessment) thus refers to the local assessor's act of denying
the protest filed pursuant to Section 252. Without the action
of the local assessor, the appellate authority of the LBAA
cannot be invoked. Napocor's action before the LBAA was thus
prematurely filed.
We DENY the petitioner's motion for reconsideration.

therein or the assessor who is not satisfied with the
decision of the Board may, within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the decision of said Board, appeal to

In laying down the powers of the Local Board of
Assessment Appeals, R.A. 7160 provides in Sec. 229 (b) that "(t)he
proceedings of the Board shall be conducted solely for the purpose
of ascertaining the facts .... " It follows that appeals to this Board
may be fruitful only where questions of fact are involved. Here the
petitioners are questioning the very authority and power of the
assessor, acting solely and independently, to impose the assessment
and of the treasurer to collect the tax. Resort to judicial action is
proper.
NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v.
MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT OF NAVOTAS
741 SCRA 505, November 24, 2014, Peralta. J.
Facts: On November 16, 1988 and June 29, 1992,
petitioner National Power Corporation (NPC) entered into a
Build-Operate-and-Transfer Project Agreements (BOTs) with
Mirant Navotas I Corporation (MNC-I), for the construction,

476

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

operation and eventual transfer to petitioner of MNC-I's 200MW and MNC-II's 100-MW gas turbine power stations. During
the period of the agreement, the operation of the power stations
shall be under the actual and direct control and supervision of
petitioner. Consequently, petitioner has the obligation to pay for
all taxes, except business taxes, relative to the implementation
of the agreements.
On May 25, 2005, MNC-II received four notices from
respondent Municipal Treasurer of Navotas informing MNC-I
and MNC-II of their real property tax delinquencies for the
2nd, 3rd, and 4th quarters of calendar year 2003 and for the
calendar years 2004 and 2005.
In a letter dated July 26, 2005, petitioner NPC reiterated
to the Municipal Assessor of Navotas their position that the
subject properties are exempt from real property tax.
Ruling: When the legality or validity of the assessment is
in question, and not its reasonableness or correctness, appeals
to the LBAA, and subsequently to the CBAA, pursuant to
Sections 226 and 229 of the LGC, are not necessary.
Stated differently, in the event that the taxpayer
questions the authority and power of the assessor to impose
the assessment, and of the treasurer to collect the real property
tax, resort to judicial action may prosper.
In laying down the powers of the Local Board of
Assessment Appeals, R.A. 7160 provides in Sec. 229 (b) that
"(t)he proceedings of the Board shall be conducted solely
for the purpose of ascertaining the facts ..." I follows that
appeals to this Board may be fruitful only where questions of
fact are involved. Again, the protest contemplated under Sec.
252 of R.A. 7160 is needed where there is a question as to the
reasonableness of the amount assessed. Hence, if a taxpayer
disputes the reasonableness of an increase in a real estate
tax assessment, he is required to "first pay the tax" under
protest. Otherwise, the city or municipal treasurer will not act
on his protest. In the case at bench, however, the petitioners
are questioning the very authority and power of the assessor,
acting solely and independently, to impose the assessment
and of the treasurer to collect the tax. These are not questions
merely of amounts of the increase in the tax but attacks on the
very validity of any increase.

Book II - Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title 'Two Real Property Taxation

477

In the case at bar, the claim of petitioner essentially
questions the very authority and power of the Municipal
Assessor to impose the assessment and of the Municipal
Treasurer to collect the real property tax with respect to the
machineries and equipment located in the Navotas I and II
power plants. Certainly, it does not pertain to the correctness
of the amounts assessed but attacks the validity of the
assessment of the taxes itself.
The Court GRANTS the petition and SETS ASIDE the CA
Decision and Resolution. Moreover, this case is REMAND ED to
the RTC for determination of petitioner's claims for annulment
of Notice of Delinquency, Warrant of Levy, and Notice of Sale.

Decided Case

1.
The salary and other emoluments given to a government
employee who extends his services beyond the compulsory retirement
age is an expenditure or use of government funds, which is irregular
since it was incurred without adhering to established rules and

the requisite filing with the CSC for a request of extension of service
on account of an employee's compulsory retirement.
MONTENEGRO v. COMMISSION ON AUDIT

Facts: Atty. Camilo Montenegro was appointed as hearing
officer of the CBAA in the Visayas Field Office from February
26, 1993 until February 25, 1999, or for a term of six years.
Prior to the expiration of his term and for lack of qualified

applicants, the CBAA issued a Resolution dated February 15,
1999 that authorized Atty. Montenegro to continue service in
a holdover capacity indefinitely until his successor is chosen
pursuant to Section 230 of the Local Government Code (LGC).
On June 20, 2003, the CBAA issued another Resolution
that further authorized Atty. Montenegro to continue service
indefinitely despite his compulsory retirement on even date.
On July 12, 2005, Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 2005025 was issued against CBAA for P132,844.50, for the period
from July 1, 2003 to November 30, 2003 after his compulsory
retirement on June 30, 2003, which was found illegal without
the CSC[']s approval/resolution on the extension of his services
pursuant to CSC Memorandum Circular No. 27 S. 2001.
Atty. Montenegro, CBAA Chairman Cesar S. Gutierrez
(Gutierrez), Cynthia V. Macabuhay (Macabuhay) as Accountant
II, Angel P. Palomares, and Nelia C. Cabbab as Administrative
Officer III, all from CBAA, were determined liable for Notice
of Disallowance No. 2005-025; while only Gutierrez and
Macabuhay were adjudged liable under Notice of Disallowance
No. 2010-09-095.
Ruling: The Commission has issued CSC Resolution No.
011624 amending and clarifyin g Section 12, Rule XIII of CSC
MC No. 15, s. 1999, as follows:
Section 12. a) No person who has reached the compulsory
retirement age of 65 years can be appointed to any position in
the government, subject only to the exception provided under
sub-section (b) hereof.
However, in meritorious cases, the Commission may
allow the extension of service of a person who has reached
the compulsory retirement age of 65 years, for a period of six
(6) months only unless otherwise stated. Provided, that, such
extension may be for a maximum period of one (1) year for one
who will complete the fifteen (15) years of service required
under the GSIS Law.
A request for extension shall be made by the head of office
and shall be filed with the Commission not later than three (3)
months prior to the date of the official/employee's compulsory
retirement.

480

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Henceforth, the only basis for Heads of Offices to allow
an employee to continue rendering service after his/her 65th
birthday is a Resolution of the Commission granting the
request for extension. Absent such Resolution, the salaries
of the said employee shall be for the personal account of the
responsible official.
Services rendered during the period of extension shall no
longer be credited as government service. However; services
rendered specifically for the purpose of completing the 15
years of service under the GSIS Law shall be credited as part
of government service for purposes of retirement.
The salary and other emoluments given to a government
employee who extends his services beyond the compulsory
retirement age is an expenditure or use of government funds,
which is irregular since it was incurred without adhering to
established rules, regulations, procedural guidelines, policies,
principles, or practices that have gained recognition in law,
more particularly, the requisite filing with the CSC for a
request of extension of service on account of an employee's
compulsory retirement.
The appointing authority, Gutierrez and the other officials
found liable by the COA who authorized the. disbursement of the
salaries, emoluments, and benefits to Atty. Montenegro for the
services actually rendered by the latter despite noncompliance
with Civil Service Rules should be held accountable for the
amount covered in ND No. 2005-025.

A.

Decided Case

1.
Section 234 of the LGC withdraws previous exemptions
granted to natural and juridical persons, including government
owned and controlled corporations from payment of real property
tax. MCIA is liable for real property tax.
MACTAN CEBU INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT
AUTHORITY v. MARCOS
261 SCRA 667, September 11, 1996, Davide, Jr., J.
Facts: Petitioner Mactan Cebu International Airport
Authority (MCIAA ) was created by virtue of Republic Act No.
6958. Since the time of its creation, petitioner MCIAA enjoyed
the privilege of exemption from payment of realty taxes in
accordance with Section 14 of its Charter. On October 11,1994,
the City of Cebu demanded payment for realty taxes on several
parcels of land. Petitioner objected to such demand for payment
as baseless and unjustified, claiming in its favor the aforecited
Section 14 of R.A. No. 6958 which exempts it from payment of
realty taxes. It was also asserted that it is an instrumentality
of the government performing governmental functions, citing
Section 133 of the Local Government Code of 1991 which puts
limitations on the tax.ing powers of local government units.
Held: Section 193 of the LGC is the general provision on
withdrawal of tax exemption privileges. It provides: Withdrawal
of Tax Exemption Privileges.
Unless otherwise provided in
this Code, tax exemptions or incentives granted to, or presently
enjoyed by all persons, whether natural or juridical, including
government-owned or controlled corporations, except local
water districts, cooperatives duly registered under R.A. No.
6938, non-stock and non-profit hospitals and educational
institutions, are hereby withdrawn upon the effectivity of this
Code.

Book II-- Local 'Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Two - Real Property Taxation

483

There can be no question that under Section 14 ofR.A. No.
6958, the petitioner is exempt from the payment of realty taxes
imposed by the National Government or any of its political
subdivisions, agencies, and instrumentalities. Nevertheless,
since taxation is the rule and exemption therefrom the
exception, the exemption may thus be withdrawn at the
pleasure of the taxing authority. The only exception to this rule
is where the exemption was granted to private parties based on
material consideration of a mutual nature, which then becomes
contractual and is thus covered by the non-impairment claim
of the Constitution.
Finally, even if the petitioner was originally not a taxable
person for purposes of real property tax, in light of the foregoing
disquisitions, it had already become, even if it be conceded to be
an "agency" or "instrumentality" of the Government, a taxable
person for such purpose in view of the withdrawal in the last
paragraph of Section 234 of exemptions from the payment of
real property taxes, which, as earlier adverted to, applies to the
petitioner MCIA.
Accordingly, the position taken by the petitioner is
untenable. Reliance on Basco u. Philippine Amusement
and Gaming Corporation is unavailing since it was decided
before the effectivity of the LGC. Besides, nothing can
prevent Congress from decreeing that even instrumentalities
or agencies of the Government performing governmental
functions may be subject to tax. Where it is done precisely to
fulfill a constitutional mandate and national policy, no one can
doubt its wisdom.
2.
The grant by Proclamation No. 420 of tax exemption
(including real property taxes) and other privileges to the John Hay
SEZ is void for being violative of the Constitution.
JOHN HAY PEOPLES ALTERNATIVE
COALITION v. LIM
414 SCRA 356, October 24, 2003, Carpio-Morales, J.
Facts: Petitioners assail, in the main, the constitutionality
of Presidential Proclamation No. 420, Series of 1994,
"CREATING AND DESIGNATING a portion of the area
covered by the former Camp John [Hay] as THE JOHN HAY
Special Economic Zone pursuant to R.A. No. 7227.2

484

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

The City of Baguio at first tried to determine the real
property taxes which may be collected from real properties of
Camp John Hay. Later, it supported the issuance of Pres. Fidel
Ramos of PP No. 420.
Ruling: The second issue refers to petitioners' objection
against the creation by Proclamation No. 420 of a regime of tax
exemption within the John Hay SEZ. Petitioners argue that
nowhere in R.A. No. 7227 is there a grant of tax exemption to
SEZs yet to be established in base areas, unlike the grant
under Section 12 thereof of tax exemption and investment
incentives to the therein established Subic SEZ. The grant
of tax exemption to the John Hay SEZ, petitioners conclude,
thus contravenes Article VI, Section 28 (4) of the Constitution
which provides that "No law granting any tax exemption shall
be passed without the concurrence of a majority of all the
members of Congress."
It is clear that under Section 12 of R.A. No. 7227 it is
only the Subic SEZ which was granted by Congress with tax
exemption, investment incentives and the like. There is no
express extension of the aforesaid benefits to other SEZs still
to be created at the time via presidential proclamation.
The deliberations of the Senate confirm the exclusivity
to Subic SEZ of the tax and investment privileges accorded it
under the law, as the exchanges between our lawmakers show
during the second reading of the precursor bill of R.A. No.
7227 with respect to the investment policies that would govern
Subic SEZ which are now embodied in the aforesaid Section 12
thereof.
As gathered from the earlier-quoted Section 12 of R.A.
No. 7227, the privileges given to Subic SEZ consist principally
of exemption from tariff or customs duties, national and local
taxes of business entities therein (paragraphs (b) and (c)), free
market and trade of specified goods or properties (paragraph
d), liberalized banking and finance (paragraph f), and relaxed
immigration rules for foreign investors (paragraph g). Yet,
apart from these, the second sentence of Sec 3, Proclamation
No. 420 also makes available to the John Hay SEZ benefits
existing in other laws such as the privilege of export processing
zone-based businesses of importing capital equipment and
raw materials free from taxes, duties and other restrictions;
tax and duty exemptions, tax holiday, tax credit, and other

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscnl Matters
Title Two Real Property Taxation

485

incentives under the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987; and
the applicability to the subject zone of rules governing foreign
investments in the Philippines.
The challenged grant of tax exemption would circumvent
the Constitution's imposition that a law granting any tax
exemption must have the concurrence of a majority of all the
members of Congress. In the same vein, the other kinds of
privileges extended to the John Hay SEZ are by tradition and
usage for Congress to legislate upon.
The second sentence of Section 3 of Proclamation No.
420 is hereby declared NULL AND VOID and is accordingly
declared of no legal force and effect.
3.
The port facilities and appurtenances are the petitioner's
corporate patrimonial properties, not for public use, and that the
operation of the port and its facilities and the administration of its
buildings are in the nature of ordinary business. The petitioner is
clothed, under P.D. No. 857, with corporate status and corporate
powers in the furtherance of its proprietary interests. Clearly then,
the petitioner is a profit-earning corporation; hence, its patrimonial
properties are subject to tax
PHILIPPINE PORTS AUTHORITY v. CITY OF ILOILO
442 SCRA 175, November 11, 2004, Callejo, Sr., J.
Facts: On October 9, 1990, the respondent City of
Iloilo sent a "Notice of Sale of Delinquent Real Properties" to
petitioner Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) for non-payment
of real property taxes covering its facilities and edifices at the
Iloilo port for the years 1985-1989.
The respondent city was the only winning bidder at
the public auction conducted by the City Treasurer and the
Assessor. Consequently, the said properties were sold to it,
and, conformably with Section 76 of Presidential Decree (P.D.)
No. 464, a certificate of sale over the properties was executed
in its favor.
On November 16, 1990, the City Treasurer sent a "Notice
of Right to Redeem" to the petitioner advising it that it had
only until October 30, 1991 within which to redeem the
properties. The petitioner forthwith filed its complaint against
the respondents, the City of Iloilo, its City Treasurer and its
Assessor with the RTC of Iloilo City, for the nullification of

486

THE LOCAL GOVERNM ENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the assessment and the sale with a prayer for a temporary
restraining order and/or a writ of preliminary injunction.
The petitioner alleged, that the properties belonged to the
Bureau of Customs and/or the national government; hence, the
properties were exempt from the payment of realty taxes. To
support its argument, the petitioner cited Section 25 of P.D. No.
857, Section 40(a) of P.D. No. 464 and Section 1(e) of Executive
Order (E.O.) No. 93 issued on December 17, 1986.
Ruling: It was the intention of Congress to withdraw the
tax exemptions granted to or presently enjoyed by all persons,
including government-owned or controlled corporations, upon
the effectivity of the LGC as shown by Section 193 thereof:
Section 193. - Withdrawal of Tax Exemption
Privileges. - Unless otherwise provided in this Code, tax
exemptions or incentives granted to, or presently enjoyed
by all persons, whether natural or juridical, including
government-owned or controlled corporations, except local
water districts, cooperatives duly registered under R.A.
6938, non-stock and non-profit hospitals and educational
institutions, are hereby withdrawn upon the effectivity of
this Code.
Furthermore, under the repealing clause, Section 534(f) of
the LGC, all general and special laws, acts, decrees, or part or
parts thereof which are inconsistent with any of the provisions
of the law were repealed:
Section 534(f)- Repealing Clause. - All general and
special laws, acts, city charters, decrees, executive orders,
proclamations and administrative regulations, or part
or parts thereof which are inconsistent with any of the
provisions of this code are hereby repealed or modified
accordingly.
The clause partakes of the nature of a general repealing
clause because it fails to designate the specific act or acts
identified by number or title that are submitted to be repealed.
Thus, Section 25 of P.D. No. 857 and Section 40 of P.D.
No. 464 were repealed by Rep. Act No. 7160. We emphasized
the raison d'etre for the withdrawal of the exemption in Mactan
Cebu International Airport Authority v. Marcos, 261 SCRA
667 (1996).

It is wont to state that even under Section 40 of P.D. No.
464, the petitioner is considered a taxable person. The bare fact
that the port and its facilities and appurtenances are accessible
to the general public does not exempt it from the payment of real
property taxes. It must be stressed that the said port facilities
and appurtenances are the petitioner's corporate patrimonial
properties, not for public use, and that the operation of the port
and its facilities and the administration of its buildings are
in the nature of ordinary business. The petitioner is clothed,
under P.D. No. 857, with corporate status and corporate powers
in the furtherance of its proprietary interests.
Clearly then, the petitioner is a profit-earning corporation;
hence, its patrimonial properties are subject to tax._
The petition is DENIED.

Republic Act No. 7633 was enacted subsequent to the LGC.
Perfectly aware that the LGC has already withdrawn Bayantel's
former exemption from realty taxes, Congress opted to pass R.A.
No. 7633. Section 11 of R.A. No. 7633 states that "the grantee, its
successors or assigns shall be liable to pay the same taxes on their
real estate, buildings and personal property, exclusive of this
franchise, as other persons or corporations are now or hereafter
may be required by law to pay." This subsequent piece of legislation
is an express and real intention on the part of Congress to once
again remove from the LGC's delegated taxing power, all of the
franchisee's (Bayantel's) properties that are actually, directly and
exclusively used in the pursuit of its franchise.
CITY GOVERNMENT OF QUEZON CITY v.
BAYAN TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INC.
484 SCRA 169, March 6, 2006, Garcia, J.
Facts: Respondent Bayan Telecommunications, Inc.
(Bayantel) is a legislative franchise holder under Rep. Act No.
3259 (June 17, 1961) to establish and operate radio stations for
domestic telecommunications, radiophone, broadcasting and
telecasting.
On relevance of this controversy is the tax provision of
Rep. Act No. 3259, embodied in Section 14 thereof, which reads:
SECTION 14. (a) The grantee shall be liable to pay
the same taxes on its real estate, buildings and personal

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

488

property, exclusive of the franchise, as other persons or
corporations are now or hereafter may be required by law
topay.xxx
On January 1, 1992, Rep. Act No. 7160, otherwise known
as the "Local Government Code of 1991" LGC), took effect.
SEC. 234 LGC provides: - Exemptions from Real Property
Tax. The following are exempted from payment of the real
property tax:
XXX

XXX

XXX

Except as provided herein, any exemption from payment
of real property tax previously granted to, or enjoyed by, all
persons, whether natural or juridical, including governmentowned-or-controlled corporations is hereby withdrawn upon
effectivity of this Code.
On July 20, 1992, barely few months after the LGC
took effect, Congress enacted Rep. Act No. 7633, amending
Bayantel's original franchise. The amendatory law (Rep. Act
No. 7633) contained the following tax provision:
SEC. 11. The grantee, its successors or assigns
shall be liable to pay the same taxes on their real estate,
buildings and personal property, exclusive of this
franchise, as other persons or corporations are now
or hereafter may be required by law to pay. In addition
thereto, the grantee, its successors or assigns shall pay a
franchise tax equivalent to three percent (3%) of all gross
receipts of the telephone or other telecommunications
businesses transacted under this franchise by the grantee,
its successors or assigns and the said percentage shall be
in lieu of all taxes on this franchise or earnings thereof.
Provided, That the grantee, its successors or assigns shall
continue to be liable for income taxes payable under Title
II of the National Internal Revenue Code.
In 1993, the government of Quezon City, enacted City
Ordinance No. SP-91, S-93, the Quezon City Revenue Code
(QCRC), imposing, under Section 5 thereof, a real property
tax on all real properties in Quezon City, and, reiterating in
its Section 6, the withdrawal of exemption from real property
tax under Section 234 of the LGC, supra. Furthermore, much

Book II - Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Two Real Property Taxation

489

like the LGC, the QCRC, under its Section 230, withdrew tax
exemption privileges in general.
Ruling: There seems to be no issue as to Bayantel's
exemption from real estate taxes by virtue of the term "exclusive
of the franchise" qualifying the phrase "same taxes on its real
estate, buildings and personal property," found in Section 14,
supra, of its franchise, Rep. Act No. 3259, as originally granted.
The legislative intent expressed in the phrase "exclusive
of this franchise" cannot be construed other than distinguishing
between two (2) sets of properties, be they real or personal,
owned by the franchisee, namely, (a) those actually, directly
and exclusively used in its radio or telecommunications
business, and (b) those properties which are not so used. It
is worthy to note that the properties subject of the present
controversy are only those which are admittedly falling under
the first category.
However, with the LGC's taking effect on January 1, 1992,
Bayantel's "exemption" from real estate taxes for properties of
whatever kind located within the Metro Manila area was, by
force of Section 234 of the LGC expressly withdrawn. But, not
long thereafter, however, or on July 20, 1992, Congress passed
Rep. Act No. 7633 amending Bayantel's original franchise.
Worthy of note is that Section 11 of Rep. Act No. 7633 is a
virtual reenacment of the tax provision, i.e., Section 14, supra,
of Bayantel's original franchise under Rep. Act No. 3259.
The Court views this subsequent piece of legislation as
an express and real intention on the part of Congress to once
again remove from the LGC's delegated taxing power, all of the
franchisee's (Bayantel's) properties that are actually, directly
and exclusively used in the pursuit of its franchise.
The petition is DENIED.

Section 234(a) of R.A. No. 7160 states that properties
owned by the Republic of the Philippines are exempt from real
property tax "except when the beneficial use thereof has been
granted, for consideration or otherwise, to a taxable person."
Only those portions of the properties leased to taxable entities are
subject to real estate tax for the period of such leases. If the Republic
of the Philippines fails to pay the real property tax on these portions

490

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

then such portions may be sold at public auction to satisfy the tax
deficiency.

CITY OF PASIG v. REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
656 SCRA 271, August 24, 2011, Carpio, J.
Facts: Mid-Pasig Land Development Corporation
(MPLDC) owned two parcels ofland, with a total area of 18.4891
hectares, situated in Pasig City covered by TCTs. Portions of
the properties are leased to different business establishments.
In 1986, the registered owner ofMPLDC, Jose Y. Campos
(Campos), voluntarily surrendered MPLDC to the Republic of
the Philippines.
On 30 September 2002, the Pasig City Assessor's Office
sent MPLDC two notices of tax delinquency for its failure to pay
real property tax on the properties for the period 1979 to 2001
totaling P256,858,555.86. In a letter dated 29 October 2002,
Independent Realty Corporation (IRC) President Ernesto R.
Jalandoni (Jalandoni) and Treasurer Rosario Razon informed
the Pasig City Treasurer that the tax for the period 1979 to
1986 had been paid, and that the properties were exempt from
tax beginning 1987.
In letters dated 10 July 2003 and 8 January 2004, the
Pasig City Treasurer informed MPLDC and IRC that the
properties were not exempt from tax.

Ruling: Section 234(a) of Republic Act No. 7160 states
that properties owned by the Republic of the Philippines are
exempt from real property tax "except when the beneficial
use thereof has been granted, for consideration or
otherwise, to a taxable person." Thus, the portions of the
properties not leased to taxable entities are exempt from real
estate tax while the portions of the properties leased to taxable
entities are subject to real estate tax. The law imposes the
liability to pay real estate tax on the Republic of the Philippines
for the portions of the properties leased to taxable entities. It is,
of course, assumed that the Republic of the Philippines passes
on the real estate tax as part of the rent to the lessees.
In the present case, the parcels of land are not properties
of public dominion because they are not "intended for
public use, such as roads, canals, rivers, torrents, ports and

Boo k II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Two - Real Property Taxation

491

bridges constructed by the State, banks, shores, roadsteads."
Neither are they "intended for some public service or for the
development of the national wealth." MPLDC leases portions
of the properties to different business establishments. Thus,
the portions of the properties leased to taxable entities are not
only subject to real estate tax, they can also be sold at public
auction to satisfy the tax delinquency.
In sum, only those portions of the properties leased to
taxable entities are subject to real estate tax for the period of
such leases. Pasig City must, therefore, issue to respondent
new real property tax assessments covering the portions of
the properties leased to taxable entities. If the Republic of the
Philippines fails to pay the real property tax on the portions
of the properties leased to taxable entities, then such portions
may be sold at public auction to satisfy the tax delinquency.
The petition is PARTIALLY GRANT ED.

The Court agrees with PRA (formerly PEA) that the
subject reclaimed lands are still part of the public domain, owned by
the State and, therefore, exempt from payment of real estate taxes.

REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v.
CITY OF PARANAQUE
677 SCRA 246, July 18, 2012, Mendoza, J.
Facts: The Public Estates Authority (PEA) is a
government corporation created by P.O. No. 1084 which took
effect on February 4, 197 to provide a coordinated, economical
and efficient reclamation of lands, and the administration and
operation of lands belonging to, managed and/or operated by,
the government with the object of maximizing their utilization
and hastening their development consistent with public
interest.

On February 19, 2003, then Paranaque City Treasurer
Liberato M. Carabeo issued Warrants of Levy on Philippine
Reclamation Authority (PRA's) reclaimed properties (Central
Business Park and Barangay San Dionisio) located in
Pararaque City based on the assessment for delinquent real
property taxes made by then Paranaque City Assessor Soledad
Medina Cue for tax years 2001 and 2002.

492

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Ruling: It is clear from Section 234, LGC that real property
owned by the Republic of the Philippines (the Republic) is
exempt from real property tax unless the beneficial use thereof
has been granted to a taxable person. In this case, there is
no proof that PRA granted the beneficial use of the subject
reclaimed lands to a taxable entity. There is no showing on
record either that PRA leased the subject reclaimed properties
to a private taxable entity.
This exemption should be read in relation to Section
133(0) of the same Code, which prohibits local governments
from imposing "taxes, fees or charges of any kind on the
National Government, its agencies and instrumentalities x xx."
The Administrative Code allows real property owned by the
Republic to be titled in the name ofagencies or instrumentalities
of the national government. Such real properties remain owned
by the Republic and continue to be exempt from real estate tax.
The Court agrees with PRA that the subject reclaimed
lands are still part of the public domain, owned by the State
and, therefore, exempt from payment of real estate taxes.
Here, the subject lands are reclaimed lands, specifically
portions of the foreshore and offshore areas of Manila Bay.
As such, these lands remain public lands and form part of
the public domain. In the case of Chavez v. Public Estates
Authority and AMARI Coastal Development Corporation, 433
Phil. 506 (2002) the Court held that foreshore and submerged
areas irrefutably belonged to the public domain and were
inalienable unless reclaimed, classified as alienable lands open
to disposition and further declared no longer needed for public
service. The fact that alienable lands of the public domain were
transferred to the PEA (now PRA) and issued land patents or
certificates of title in PEA's name did not automatically make
such lands private. This Court also held therein that reclaimed
lands retained their inherent potential as areas for public use
or public service.
Only when qualified private parties acquire these
lands will the lands become private lands. In the hands of
the government agency tasked and authorized to dispose of
alienable of disposable lands of the public domain, these lands
are still public, not private lands.

Book II- Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title 'Two Real Property Taxation

493

Under Section 2, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution,
the foreshore and submerged areas of Manila Bay are part
of the "lands of the public domain, waters x x x and other
natural resources" and consequently "owned by the State." As
such, foreshore and submerged areas "shall not be alienated,"
unless they are classified as "agricultural lands" of the public
domain. The mere reclamation of these areas by PEA does not
convert these inalienable natural resources of the State into
alienable or disposable lands of the public domain. There must
be a law or presidential proclamation officially classifyin g
these reclaimed lands as alienable or disposable and open to
disposition or concession. Moreover, these reclaimed lands
cannot be classified as alienable or disposable if the law has
reserved them for some public or quasi-public use.
As the Court has repeatedly ruled, properties of public
dominion are not subject to execution or foreclosure sale. Thus,
the assessment, levy and foreclosure made on the subject
reclaimed lands by respondent, as well as the issuances of
certificates of title in favor of respondent, are without basis.
The petition is GRAN TED.
7.
The PEZA is an instrumentality of the national
government. Furthermore, the lands owned by the PEZA are real
properties owned by the Republic of the Philippines. The City of
Lapu-Lapu and the Province of Bataan cannot collect real property
taxes from the PEZA.

CITY OF LAPU-LAPU v. PHILIPPINE ECONOMIC
ZONE AUTHORITY
742 SCRA 524, November 26, 2014, Leonen, J.
Facts: In the letter dated March 25, 1998, the City of
Lapu-Lapu, through the Office of the Treasurer, demanded
from the PEZA 32,912,350.08 in real property taxes for the
period from 1992 to 1998 on the PEZA's properties located in
the Mactan Economic Zone.
After the City of Lapu-Lapu had demanded payment of
real property taxes from the PEZA, the Province of Bataan
followed suit. In its letter dated May 29, 2003, the Province,
through the Office of the Provincial Treasurer, informed the
PEZA that it would be sending a real property tax billing to

494

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the PEZA. Arguing that the PEZA is a developer of economic
zones, the Province claimed that the PEZA is liable for real
property taxes under Section 24 of the Special Economic Zone
Act of 1995.

Ruling: The PEZA cannot be taxed for real property taxes
even if it acts as a developer or operator of special economic
zones. The PEZA is an instrumentality of the national
government exempt from payment of real property taxes under
Section 133(0) of the Local Government Code. As this court
said in Manila International Airport Authority, "there must be
express language in the law empowering local governments to
tax national government instrumentalities. Any doubt whether
such power exists is resolved against local governments."
Even the PEZA's lands and buildings whose beneficial
use have been granted to other persons may not be taxed
with real property taxes. The PEZA may only lease its lands
and buildings to PEZA-registered economic zone enterprises
and entities. These PEZA-registered enterprises and entities,
which operate within economic zones, are not subject to real
property taxes. Under Section 24 of the Special Economic
Zone Act of 1995, no taxes, whether local or national, shall be
imposed on all business establishments operating within the

economic zones.
In lieu of revenues from real property taxes, the City of
Lapu-Lapu collects two-fifths of 5% final tax on gross income
paid by all business establishments operating within the
Mactan Economic Zone:
For its part, the Province of Bataan collects a fifth of the
5% final tax on gross income paid by all business establishments
operating within the Freeport Area of Bataan.
Petitioners, therefore, are not deprived of revenues
from the operations of economic zones within their respective
territorial jurisdictions.
All told, the PEZA is an instrumentality of the national
government. Furthermore, the lands owned by the PEZA are
real properties owned by the Republic of the Philippines. The
City of Lapu-Lapu and the Province of Bataan cannot collect
real property taxes from the PEZA.
The consolidated petitions are DENIED.

METROPOLITAN WATERWORKS SEWERAGE
SYSTEM v. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
OF QUEZON CITY
G.R. No. 194388, November 7, 2018, Leonen, J.
Facts: This resolves a Petition for Review on Certiorari
assailing the October 19, 2010 Decision of the Court of Appeals,
which held that the Local Government of Quezon City may
assess real property taxes on Metropolitan Waterworks and
Sewerage System's properties located in Quezon City.

Ruling: After the promulgation of Manila International
Airport Authority v. Court of Appeals, 528 Phil. 181 (2006)
then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo issued Executive
Order No. 596, which recognized this Court's categorization of
"government instrumentalities vested with corporate powers."
Section 1 of Executive Order No. 596 states:
Section l. The Office of the Government Corporate
Counsel (OGCC) shall be the principal law office of all
GOCCs, except as may otherwise be provided by their
respective charter or authorized by the President, their
subsidiaries, corporate offsprings, and government
acquired asset corporations. The OGCC shall likewise be
the principal law office of "government instrumentality
vested with corporate powers" or "government corporate
entity', as defined by the Supreme Court in the case of
"MIAA vs. Court of Appeals, City of Paranaque, et al.",
supra, notable examples of which are: Manila International
Airport Authority (MIAA ), Mactan International Airport
Authority, the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA),
Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC),
Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Services (MWSS),
Philippine Rice Research Institute (PRRI), Laguna Lake
Development Authority (LLDA), Fisheries Development
Authority (FDA), Bases Conversion Development
Authority (BCDA), Cebu Port Authority (CPA), Cagayan
de Oro Port Authority, and San Fernando Port Authority.

496

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Under this provision, petitioner MW SS is categorized
with other government agencies that were found to be exempt
from the payment of real property taxes.
In 2011, Congress passed Republic Act No. 10149 or
the GOCC Governance Act of 2011, which adopted the same
categorization and explicitly lists petitioner together with the
other government agencies that were previously held by this
Court to be exempt from the payment of real property taxes:
(n) Government Instrumentalities with Corporate
Powers (GICP)/Government Corporate Entities (GCE)
refer to instrumentalities or agencies of the government,
which are neither corporations nor agencies integrated
within the departmental framework, but vested by law
with special functions or jurisdiction, endowed with some
if not all corporate powers, administering special funds,
and enjoying operational autonomy usually through
a charter including, but not limited to, the following:
the Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA),
the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA), the Philippine
Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC), the Metropolitan
Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), the Laguna
Lake Development Authority (LLDA), the Philippine
Fisheries Development Authority (PFDA), the Bases
Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA), the
Cebu Port Authority (CPA), the Cagayan de Oro Port
Authority, the San Fernando Port Authority, the Local
Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) and the Asian
Productivity Organization (APO).
The Executive and Legislative Branches, therefore, have
already categorized petitioner not as a government-owned and
controlled corporation but as a Government Instrumentality
with Corporate Powers/Government Corporate Entity like the
Manila International Airport Authority and the Philippine
Fisheries Development Authority. Privileges enjoyed by
these Government Instrumentalities with Corporate Powers/
Government Corporate Entities should necessarily also extend
to petitioner. Hence, petitioner's real property tax exemption
under Republic Act No. 6234 is still valid as the proviso of
Section 234 of the Local Government Code is only applicable to
government-owned and -controlled corporations.

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Two Real Property Taxation

Thus, petitioner MWSS is not liable to respondent Local
Government of Quezon City for real property taxes, except if the
beneficial use of its properties has been extended to a taxable
person.
Respondents have not alleged that the beneficial use of
any of petitioner's properties was extended to a taxable person.
In the absence of any allegation to the contrary, petitioner's
properties in Quezon City are not subject to the levy of real
property taxes.
The Petition is GRANTED.

Tax exemptions and privileges claimed by NPC cannot be
recognized since it is not the actual, direct, and exclusive user of the
facilities, machinery and equipment subject of the cases.

NATIONAL POWER CORPORATION v.
THE PROVINCE OF PANGASINAN
G.R. No. 210191, March 4, 2019, Reyes, J. Jr., J.
Facts: On May 20, 1994, petitioner NPC entered into an
Energy Conversion Agreement (ECA) with CEPA Pangasinan
Electric Limited (CEPA), a private corporation, for the
construction, operation, and maintenance of the Sual CoalFired Thermal Power Plant, whereby CEPA agreed to supply
a coal-fired thermal power station to NPC on a Build-OperateTransfer (BOT) basis to generate electricity, which electricity
will in turn be sold exclusively to NPC. CEPA subsequently
became Mirant Sual Corporation (Mirant) and now also known
as Team Energy Power Holdings Corporation (Team Energy).
For purposes of this case, we shall use "Mirant" to refer to
CEPA, Mirant, or Team Energy as the company was called
"Mirant" when this case started with the LBAA.
NPC religiously paid real property taxes from 1998 up
to the first quarter of 2003 for the land, buildings, machinery,
and equipment pertaining to the power plant. Notably, said
machinery and equipment were declared in the name of Mirant
under Tax Declaration No. 3694. On the second quarter of 2003,
NPC stopped paying said taxes, purportedly pursuant to the
provisions of R.A. No. 7160, which grants certain exemptions
from iteal property tax liabilities.

498

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

This prompted the Office of the Municipal Treasurer
of Sual, Pangasinan to issue a Notice of Assessment dated
September 10, 2003 for the payment of real property taxes
thereon.
Ruling: The Court has concluded that the tax exemptions
and privileges claimed by NPC cannot be recognized since it
is not the actual, direct, and exclusive user of the facilities,
machinery and equipment subject of the cases.
In this case, NPC is neither the owner nor the possessor
or beneficial user of the subject facilities. Hence, it cannot be
considered to have any legal interest in the subject property to
clothe it with the personality to question the assessment and
claim for exemptions and privileges.
Records clearly show that NPC is yet to be the owner of
the subject facilities.
Further, as correctly observed by the LBAA, there is
nothing in the ECA which expressly grants the NPC the
right or authority to use directly or indirectly the power
plant and the facilities therein during the cooperation period.
Article 5 of the ECA specifically provides that Mirant has the
responsibility to manage, operate, and maintain the power
plant until the Transfer Date. Such acts of management,
operation, maintenance, and repair are inherent in and
are necessary and incidental to Mirant's ownership and
actual use of the power plant and the facilities therein.
Clearly, as it is, during the subject taxable period, Mirant
is still the owner and actual user of the subject facilities.
In all, the LBAA and the CBAA, as affirmed by the CTA,
correctly denied NPC's claim for exemptions and entitlement
to privileges under R.A. No. 7160.
The petition is DENIED. The Decision of the Court of Tax
Appeals is hereby AFFIRMED.
10. Since the method employed by the respondent City in
collecting the realty taxes due
through the warrant of levy and
the eventual public auction of a property of public dominion- is not
sanctioned by law, then it is no longer necessary for the petitioner
to file a surety bond as a condition precedent to suspend the tax
collection.

PRIVATIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OFFICE v.
COURT OF TAX APPEALS
G.R. No. 211839, March 18, 2019, J. Reyes, J.
Facts: The Privatization and Management Office (PMO)
(petitioner), the Province of Leyte and the Philippine Tourism
Authority (PTA) are the owners of the Leyte Park Hotel, Inc.
(LPHI), a real property with improvement situated within the
territorial and taxing jurisdiction of private respondent City
Government of Tacloban (respondent City).
The facilities of LPHI were leased out to Unimaster
Conglomeration, Inc. (UCI) for a monthly rental of P300,000.00
for a period of 12 years. Meanwhile, respondent City sent
several demand letters to UCI for it to pay the real property
taxes of LPHI in the amount of P23,377,353.08.
Ruling: The petitioner PMO recognized the fact - which
was affirmed in the CTA En Banc Decision dated August 22,
2014, that as a government entity, it is exempt from payment
of real property taxes pursuant to Section 234(a) of the 1991
Local Government Code or R.A. No. 7160. The said provision
also provides that when the beneficial use of the real property
owned by the Republic or any of its political subdivision, is
vested to a taxable person, the real property is subject to tax.
Petitioner, together with the PTA and the Province of Leyte,
had already admitted that they are co-owners of the subject
property and they were leasing the same to UCI, a private
entity pursuant to a Contract of Lease dated September 15,
1994.
While it is correct for the respondent City to assess
UCI of the unpaid real property taxes, it is, however, a clear
contravention of the law to proceed with the issuance of the
warrant of levy against the subject property in order to place
it for public auction. This method of collection of the deficiency
of real property taxes prejudiced not UCI, the private entity
who is directly charged with the payment of the tax, but the
petitioner, the PTA and the Province of Leyte, the government
entities who owned the land.
Being a property of public dominion, the subject property
cannot be subject of public auction sale, notwithstanding its
realty tax delinquency. This means that the respondent City
has to satisfy its realty tax claims by serving the accrued realty

600

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

tax assessment upon UC!, as the taxable beneficial user of the
subject property and in case of UCFs non-payment, through
any means other than the sale at public auction of the leased
property.
Since the method employed by the respondent City in
collecting the realty taxes due - through the warrant of levy
and the eventual public auction ofa property of public dominion
- is not sanctioned by law, then it is no longer necessary for
the petitioner to file a surety bond as a condition precedent to
suspend the tax collection.
To repeat, the purpose of the surety bond is to ensure that
the tax due will be paid if and when the case is finally decided
against the taxpayer. Indeed, the Republic of the Philippines
need not give this security as it is presumed to be always
solvent and able to meet its obligations. Thus, the petitioner,
being an agent of the national government, is not required to
put up a bond because to do so would be to indirectly require
the state to submit such bond. Since the petitioner had already
filed the required surety bond with the CTA, it is just proper
to order the CTA to release the same for reasons as discussed
in this decision.
The Petition for Certiorari is GRANTED.
11. Under R.A. 9500, the parcel of land owned by UP currently
leased to Ayala Land, Inc. is exempt from real property tax. This
tax exemption, however, applies only to "assets of the University
of the Philippines," referring to assets owned by UP. Under the
Contract of Lease between UP and ALI, all improvement on the
leased land "shall be owned by, and shall be for the account of the
LESSEE [ALI]" during the term of the lease. The improvements
are not "assets" owned by UP; and thus, UP's tax exemption under
R.A. 9500 does not extend to these improvements during the term of
the lease.

assessed value of P499,500,000.00 effective 2009."
UP filed the present case before this Court within 60 days
from receipt of the 11 July 2014 Final Notice of Delinquency.
Ruling: One source of UP's exemption from tax comes
from its character as a government instrumentality. Section
133(0) of the Local Government Code states that, unless
otherwise provided by the Code, the exercise of taxing powers
of the local government units shall not extend to levy of taxes,
fees or charges of any kind on government instrumentalities.
However, a combined reading of Sections 205 and 234 of
the Local Government Code, also provides for removal of the
exemption to government instrumentalities when beneficial
use of a real property owned by a government instrumentality is
granted to a taxable person. Stated differently, when beneficial
use of a real property owned by a government instrumentality
is granted to a taxable person, then the taxable person is not
exempted from paying real property tax on such property.
This is the doctrine used by the City Assessor and the City
Treasurer in the present set of facts. The City Assessor and
the City Treasurer concluded that ALI is liable for the real
property tax on the land that it leased from UP.
Republic Act No. 9500, however, gave a specific tax
exemption to UP which covers the land subject of the present
case. The City Assessor and the City Treasurer overlooked this
specific exemption awarded to UP by Republic Act No. 9500.
The legislative authority given to UP by Republic Act No. 9500
is the point where the present case differs from our ruling in
National Power Corporation v. Province of Quezon (NPC case)
610 Phil. 456 (2009).
The enactment and passage of Republic Act No. 9500
in 2008 superseded Sections 205(d) and 234(a) of the Local
Government Code. Before the passage of Republic Act No.

9500, there was a need to determine who had beneficial use
of UP's property before the property may be subjected to real
property tax. After the passage of Republic Act No. 9500,
there is a need to determine whether UP's property is used for
educational purposes or in support thereof before the property
may be subjected to real property tax.

is permanently restrained from levying on or selling at public
auction the parcel of land covered by TCT No. RT-107350
(192689) to satisfy the payment of the real property tax
delinquency.

Section 22 of Republic Act No. 9500, previously quoted
above, allows UP to lease and develop its land subject to
certain conditions. The Contract of Lease between UP and
ALI shows that there is an intent to develop "a prestigious
and dynamic science and technology park, where research and
technology-based collaborative projects between technology
and the academe thrive, thereby becoming a catalyst for the
development of the information technology and information
technology-enabled service." The development of the subject
land is clearly for an educational purpose, or at the very least,
in support of an educational purpose.

SEC. 235. Additional Levy on Real Property for
the Special Education Fund (SEF). -- A province
or city or a municipality within the Metropolitan
Manila Area, may levy and collect an annual tax
of one percent (1%) on the assessed value of real
property which shall be in addition to the basic real
property tax. The proceeds thereof shall exclusively
accrue to the Special Education Fund (SEF).

Considering that the subject land and the revenue
derived from the lease thereof are used by UP for educational
purposes and in support of its educational purposes, UP should
not be assessed, and should not be made liable for real property
tax on the land subject of this case. Under Republic Act No.
9500, this tax exemption, however, applies only to "assets of
the University of the Philippines," referring to assets owned
by UP. Under the Contract of Lease between UP and ALI, all
improvement on the leased land "shall be owned by, and shall
be for the account of the LESSEE [ALI]" during the term of the
lease. The improvements are not "assets" owned by UP; and
thus, UP's tax exemption under Republic Act No. 9500 does
not extend to these improvements during the term of the lease.
The petition is GRAN TED. We DECLAR E the University
of the Philippines EXEMPT from real property tax imposed
by the City Treasurer of Quezon City on the parcel of land
covered by TCT No. RT-107350 (192689), which is leased to
Ayala Land, Inc. Accordingly, we declare VOID the Statement
of Delinquency date 27 May 2014 as well as the Final Notice of
Delinquency date 11 July 2014 issued by the City Treasurer of
Quezon City to the University of the Philippines in connection
with the parcel of land covered by TCT No. RT-107350

CHAPTER 5• Special Levies on Real Property

A.

Decided Case

1.
In Section 235 LGC, the additional levy of 1% for special
education fund is prefixed with "may." Having established the
propriety of imposing an additional levy for the special education
fund at the rate of 0.5%, instead of 1% it follows that there was
nothing erroneous in the Municipality of Narra's having acted
pursuant to Section 48 of the Ordinance.
DEMAALA v. COMMISSION ON AUDIT
750 SCRA 612, February 17, 2015, Leonen, J.
Facts: The Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Palawan
enacted a Provincial Ordinance entitled "An Ordinance
Approving and Adopting the Code Governing the Revision of
Assessments, Classification and Valuation of Real Properties
in the Province of Palawan" (Ordinance). The Ordinance
provides for an additional levy on real property tax for the
special education fund at the rate of one-half percent or 0.5%
as follows: Section 48 - Additional Levy on Real Property Tax
for Special Education Fund. There is hereby levied an annual
tax at the rate of one-half percent (1/2%) of the assessed value
property tax. The proceeds thereof shall exclusively accrue to
the Special Education Fund (SEF).
In conformity with Section 48 of the Ordinance, the
Municipality of Narra, Palawan, with Lucena Demaala as
mayor, collected from owners of real properties located within

504

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

its territory an annual tax as special education fund at the rate
of 0.5% of the assessed value of the property subject to tax.
Th.is collection was effected through the municipal treasurer.
On post-audit, the Audit Team Leader issued an Audit
Observation Memorandum in wh.ich he noted supposed
deficiencies in the special education fund collected by the
Municipality of Narra. He questioned the levy of the special
education fund at the rate of only 0.5% rather than at 1%, the
rate stated in Section 235 of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise
known as the Local Government Code of 1991.
Regional Cluster Director Sy issued Notice of Charge
(NC) No. 2004-04-101 dated August 30, 2004 in the amount
of P1,125,416.56. He held Demaala, the municipal treasurer
of Narra, and all special education fund payors liable for the
deficiency in special education fund collections.
Ruling: Section 235 of the Local Government Code
allows provinces and cities, as well as municipalities in Metro
Manila, to collect, on top of the basic annual real property tax,
an additional levy which shall exclusively accrue to the special
education fund:
The special education fund is not an original creation
of the Local Government Code. It was initially devised by
Republic Act No. 5447. The rate of 1% is also not a detail that
is original to the Local Government Code.
The operative phrase in Section 235's grant to
municipalities in Metro Manila, cities, and provinces of the
power to impose an additional levy for the special education
fund is prefixed with "may," thus, "may levy and collect an
annual tax of one percent (1%)."
Section 235's permissive language is unqualified.
Moreover, there is no limiting qualifier to the articulated rate
of 1% which unequivocally indicates that any and all special
education fund collections must be at such rate.
At most, there is a seeming ambiguity in Section 235.
Consistent with what has earlier been discussed however, any
such ambiguity must be read in favor of local fiscal autonomy.
Having established the propriety of imposing an
additional levy for the special education fund at the rate

Book II Local 'Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Two - Real Property Taxation

606

of 0.5%, it follows that there was nothing erroneous in the
Municipality of Narra's having acted pursuant to Section 48 of
the Ordinance. It could thus not be faulted for collecting from
owners of real properties located within its territory an annual
tax as special education fund at the rate of 0.5% of the assessed
value subject to tax of the property. Likewise, it follows that it
was an error for respondent to hold petitioner personally liable
for the supposed deficiency in collections.
The Petition is GRANTED.
SEC. 236. Additional Ad Valorem Tax on Idle
Lands.
A province or city, or a municipality
within the Metropolitan Manila Area, may levy an
annual tax on idle lands at the rate not exceeding
five percent (5%) of the assessed value of the
property which shall be in addition to the basic
real property tax.
SEC. 237. Idle Lands, Coverage• For purposes

(1/2) of which remain uncultivated or unimproved
by the owner of the property or person having
legal interest therein. Agricultural lands planted
to permanent or perennial crops with at least fifty
(50) trees to a hectare shall not be considered idle
lands. Lands actually used for grazing purposes
shall likewise not be considered idle lands;
(b) Lands, other than agricultural, located
in a city or municipality, more than one thousand
(1,000) square meters in area one-half (1/2) 0f which
remain unutilized or unimproved by the owner
of the property or person having legal interest
therein.
Regardless of land area, this Section shall
likewise apply to residential lots in subdivisions
duly approved by proper authorities, the ownership
of which has been transferred to individual owners,

606

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

who shall be liable for the additional tax: Provided,
however, That individual lots of such subdivisions,
the ownership of which has not been transferred
to the buyer shall be considered as part of the
subdivision, and shall be subject to the additional
tax payable by subdivision owner or operator.
SEC. 238. Idle Lands Exempt from Tax.A province or city or a municipality within the
Metropolitan Manila Area may exempt idle lands
from the additional levy by reason of force majeure,
civil disturbance, natural calamity or any cause or
circumstance which physically or legally prevents
the owner of the property or person having legal
interest therein from improving, utilizing or
cultivating the same.
SEC. 239. Listing of Idle Lands by the Assessor.
- The provincial, city or municipal assessor
shall make and keep an updated record of all
idle lands located within his area of jurisdiction.
For purposes of collection, the provincial, city or
municipal assessor shall furnish a copy thereof
to the provincial city or city treasurer who shall
notify, on the basis of such record, the owner of the
property or person having legal interest therein of
the imposition of the additional tax.
SEC. 240. Special Levy by Local Government
Units.
A province, city or municipality may
impose a special levy on the lands comprised within
its territorial jurisdiction specially benefited by
public works projects or improvements funded by
the local government unit concerned: Provided,
however, That the special levy shall not exceed sixty
percent (60%) of the actual cost of such projects
and improvements, including the costs of acquiring
land and such other real property in connection
therewith: Provided, further, That the special
levy shall not apply to lands exempt from basic
real property tax and the remainder of the land
portions of which have been donated to the local
government unit concerned for the construction of
such projects or improvements.

cost thereof, specify the metes and bounds by
monuments and lines and the number of annual
installments for the payment of the special levy
which in no case shall be less than five (5) nor more
than ten (IO) years. The sanggunian concerned
shall not be obliged, in the apportionment and
computation of the special levy, to establish a
uniform percentage of all lands subject to the
payment of the tax for the entire district, but it may
fix different rates for different parts or sections
thereof, depending on whether such land is more
or less benefited by the proposed work.
SEC. 242. Publication of Proposed Ordinance
Imposing a Special Levy.
Before the enactment
of an ordinance imposing a special levy, the
sanggunian concerned shall conduct a public
hearing thereon; notify in writing the owners of
the real property to be affected or the persons
having legal interest therein as to the date and
place thereof and afford the latter the opportunity
to express their positions or objections relative to

apportioned, computed, and assessed according
to the assessed valuation of the lands affected as
shown by the books of the assessor concerned,
or its current assessed value as fixed by said
assessor if the property does not appear of record
in his books. Upon the effectivity of the ordinance
imposing special levy, the assessor concerned shall
forthwith proceed to determine the annual amount
of special levy assessed against each parcel of land
comprised within the area especially benefited
and shall send to each landowner a written notice
thereof by mail, personal service or publication in
appropriate cases.

the sanggunian concerned may grant a discount
not exceeding twenty percent (20%) of the annual
tax due.

We do not agree. Although as a rule, administrative
remedies must first be exhausted before resort to judicial
action can prosper, there is a well-settled exception in cases
where the controversy does not involve questions of fact but
only of law. In the present case, the parties, even during the
proceedings in the lower court on 11 April 1994, already agreed
"that the issues in the petition are legal," and tbus, no evidence
was presented in said court.

SEC. 252. Payment Under Protest.- (a) No

city treasurer or municipal treasurer, in the case
of a municipality within Metropolitan Manila Area,
who shall decide the protest within sixty (60) days

A.

Decided Case

1.
The protest contemplated under Section 252 of R.A. No.
7160 is needed where there is a question as to the reasonableness of
the amount assessed, not where the question raised is on the very
authority and power of the assessor to impose the assessment and of
the treasurer to collect the tax.
TYv.TRAMPE
250 SCRA 500, December 1, 1995, Panganiban, J.
Facts: (See supra)
Held: Respondents argue that this case is premature
because petitioners neither appealed the questioned assessments
on their properties to the Board of Assessment Appeals,

511

t

I

In laying down the powers of the Local Board of
Assessment Appeals, R.A. 7160 provides in Sec. 229(b) that
"(t)he proceedings of the Board shall be conducted solely for
the purpose of ascertaining the facts .." I follows that appeals
to this Board may be fruitful only where questions of fact are
involved. Again, the protest contemplated under Sec. 252
of R.A. 7160 is needed where there is a question as to the
reasonableness of the amount assessed. Hence, if a taxpayer
disputes the reasonableness of an increase in a real estate
tax assessment, he is required to "first pay the tax'' under
protest. Otherwise, the city or municipal treasurer will not act
on his protest. In the case at bench however, the petitioners
are questioning the very authority and power of the assessor,
acting solely and independently, to impose the assessment
and of the treasurer to collect the tax. These are not questions
merely of amounts of the increase in the tax but attacks on the
very validity of any increase.
But in the instant proceedings, there are no such factual
issues. Therefore, there is no reason to require petitioners to
exhaust the administrative remedies provided in R.A. 7160 nor
to mandate a referral by this Court to said Board.
Judgment is hereby rendered and SETTING ASIDE the
questioned Decision of respondent Judge, DECLAR ING as
null and void the questioned Schedule of Market Values for
properties in Pasig City prepared by respondent Assessor,
as well as the corresponding assessments and real estate tax
increases based thereon; and ENJOINING the respondent
Treasurer from collecting the real estate tax increases made
on the basis of said schedule and assessments.

2.
Petitioner's failure to comply with the mandatory
requirement of payment under protest for real property tax
assessments in accordance with Section 252 of the LGC of 1991 was
fatal to its appeal.
CAMP JOHN HAY DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION v.
CENTRAL BOARD OF ASSESSMENT APPEALS
706 SCRA 547, October 2, 2013, Perez, J.
Facts: In a letter dated 21 March 2002, respondent City
Assessor of Baguio City notified petitioner Camp John Hay
Development Corporation about the issuance against it of
thirty-six (36) Owner's Copy of Assessment of Real Property
(ARP), with ARP Nos. 01-07040-008887 to 01-07040-008922
covering various buildings of petitioner and two (2) parcels of
land owned by the Bases Conversion Development Authority
(BCDA) in the John Hey Special Economic Zone (JHSEZ),
Baguio City, which were leased out to petitioner Camp John
Hay Development Corporation.
In response, petitioner questioned the assessments in
a letter dated 3April 2002 for lack of legal basis due to the
City Assessor's failure to identify the specific properties and
its corresponding assessed values. The City Assessor replied
in a letter dated 11 April 2002 that the subject ARPs (with an
additional ARP on another building bringing the total number
of ARPs to thirty-seven [37]) against the buildings of petitioner
located within the JHSEZ were issued on the basis of the
approved building permits obtained from the City Engineer's
Office of Baguio City and pursuant to Sections 201 to 206 of RA
No. 7160 or the LGC of 1991.
Consequently, on 23 May 2002, petitioner filed with the
Board of Tex Assessment Appeals (BTAA) of Baguio City en
appeal under Section 226 of the LGC of 1991 challenging the
validity end propriety of the issuances of the City Assessor.
The appeal was docketed as Tax Appeal Case No. 2002003. Petitioner claimed that there was no legal basis for the
issuance of the assessments because it was allegedly exempted
from paying taxes, national end local, including reel property
taxes, pursuant to RA No. 7227, otherwise known es the Bases
Conversion and Development Act of 1992.

Ruling: Section 252 emphatically directs that the
taxpayer/real property owner questioning the assessment

Book II - Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Two Real Property Taxation

513

should first pay the tax due before his protest can be entertained.
As a matter of fact, the words "paid under protest" shell be
annotated on the tax receipts. Consequently, only after such
payment has been made by the taxpayer may he file a protest
in writing (within thirty (30) days from said payment of tax) to
the provincial, city, or municipal treasurer, who shall decide
the protest within sixty (60) days from its receipt. In no case is
the local treasurer obliged to entertain the protest unless the
tax due has been paid.
Secondly, within the period prescribed by law, any owner
or person having legal interest in the property not satisfied
with the action of the provincial, city, or municipal assessor
in the assessment of his property may file an appeal with the
LBAA of the province or city concerned, es provided in Section
226 of RA No. 7160 or the LGC of 1991. Thereafter, within
thirty (30) days from receipt, he may elevate, by filing a notice
of appeal, the adverse decision of the LBAA with the CBAA,
which exercises exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide all
appeals from the decisions, orders, end resolutions of the Loca l
Boards involving contested assessments of real properties,
claims for tax refund and/or tax credits, or overpayments of
taxes.
Petitioner considered the 11 April 2002 letter as the
"action" referred to in Section 226 which speaks of the local
assessor's act of denying the protest filed pursuant to Section
252. However, applying Dr. Oliveres v. Mayor Marquez,
482 Phil. 183 (2004 in the present case, it is evident that
petitioner's failure to comply with the mandatory requirement
of payment under protest in accordance with Section 252 of the
LGC of 1991 was fatal to its appeal.
Notwithstanding such failure to comply therewith, the
BTAA elected not to immediately dismiss the case but instead
took cognizance of petitioner's appeal subject to the condition
that payment of the real property tax should first be made
before proceeding with the hearing of its appeal, as provided
for under Section 7, Rule V of the Rules of Procedure Before the
LBAA. Hence, the BTAA simply recognized the importance of
the requirement of "payment under protest" before an appeal
may be entertained, pursuant to Section 252, and in relation
with Section 231 of the same Code es to non-suspension of
collection of the realty tax pending appeal.

tax. The provincial or city treasurer, or a treasurer
of a municipality within the Metropolitan Manila
Area, as the case may be, when issuing a warrant of
levy shall prepare a duly authenticated certificate
showing the name of the delinquent owner of the
property or person having legal interest therein,
the description of the property, the amount of
the tax due and the interest thereon. The warrant
shall operate with the force of a legal execution
throughout the province, city or a municipality
within the Metropolitan Manila Area. The warrant
shall be mailed to or served upon the delinquent
owner of the real property or person having legal
interest therein, or in case he is out of the country or
cannot be located, to the administrator or occupant
of the property. At the same time, written notice of
the levy with the attached warrant shall be mailed
to or served upon the assessor and the Registrar of
Deeds of the province, city or municipality within
the Metropolitan Manila Area where the property
is located, who shall annotate the levy on the tax
declaration and certificate of title of the property,
respectively.

SEC. 260. Advertisement and Sale.
Within
thirty (30) days after service of the warrant of
levy, the local treasurer shall proceed to publicly
advertise for sale or auction the property or a
usable portion thereof as may be necessary to
satisfy the tax delinquency and expenses of sale.
The advertisement shall be effected by posting a
notice at the main entrance of the provincial, city
or municipal building, and in a publicly accessible
and conspicuous place in the barangay where the
real property is located, and by publication once a
week for two (2) weeks in a newspaper of general
circulation in the province, city or municipality
where the property is located. The advertisement
shall specify the amount of the delinquent tax, the
interest due thereon and expenses of sale, the date
and place of sale, the name of the owner of the real
property or person having legal interest therein,
and a description of the property to be sold. At any
time before the date fixed for the sale, the owner
of the real property or person having legal interest
therein may stay the proceedings by paying the
delinquent tax, the interest due thereon and the
expenses of sale. The sale shall be held either at the
main entrance of the provincial, city or municipal
building, or on the property to be sold, or at any
other place as specified in the notice of the sale.

The levying office shall submit a report on the
levy to the sanggunian concerned within ten (10)
days after receipt of the warrant by the owner of the
property or person having legal interest therein.
SEC. 259. Penalty for Failure to Issue and
Execute Warrant. - Without prejudice to criminal
prosecution under the Revised Penal Code and
other applicable laws, any local treasurer or his
deputy who fails to issue or execute the warrant
of levy within one (1) year from the time the tax
becomes delinquent or within thirty (30) days
from the date of the issuance thereof, or who is
found guilty of abusing the exercise thereof in
an administrative or judicial proceeding shall be
dismissed from the service.

Within thirty (30) days after the sale, the local
treasurer or his deputy shall make a report of the
sale to the sanggunian concerned, and which shall
form part of his records. The local treasurer shall
likewise prepare and deliver to the purchaser a
certificate of sale which shall contain the name of
the purchaser, a description of the property sold,
the amount of the delinquent tax, the interest due
thereon, the expense of sale and a brief description
of the proceedings: Provided, however, That
proceeds of the sale in excess of the delinquent tax,
the interest due thereon, and the expenses of sale
shall be remitted to the owner of the real property
or person having legal interest therein.

advertisement and sale.

A.

Decided Cases

1.
The public auction of land to satisfy delinquency in the
payment of real estate tax derogates or impinges on property rights
and due process. Thus, the steps prescribed by law are mandatory
and must be strictly followed; if not, the sale of the real property
is invalid and does not make its purchaser the new owner. Strict
adherence to the statutes governing tax sales is imperative not only
for the protection of the taxpayers, but also to allay any possible
suspicion of collusion between the buyer and the public officials
called upon to enforce the laws.
SALVA v. MAGPILE
844 SCRA 586, November 8, 2017, Peralta, J.
Facts: Sometime in 1968, respondent Ildefonso P.
Magpile (Magpile) acquired a 262-square-meter parcel of
land situated in Makati City, Metro Manila. His title thereto,
Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 215195, was registered
on February 19, 1968 and bears "2118 Apolinario, Makati,
Rizal" as his postal address. He transferred to and resided in
the subject property. On June 30, 1980, he filed with the Office
of the Municipal Assessor of Makati a Sworn Statement of the
True Current and Fair Market Value of the land covered by
TCT No. 215195 as well as the improvements made thereon. In
the Sworn Statement, he wrote "1772 Evangelista, Bangkal,
Makati, M.M." as his postal address.
Magpile failed to pay the real property taxes due on the
subject property from 1998 up to 2006. As a result, the City
Treasurer of Makati sent him billing statements, notice of
realty tax delinquency, and warrants of levy at the address
"2118 Apolinario St., Bangkal, Makati City," On May
24, 2006, the subject property was sold at a public auction for
1'200,000.00 to petitioner Katherine Rose Salva (Salva) as the
highest bidder.
Almost two years after, on March 5, 2008, Magpile,
through his daughter, Ma. Socorro Magpile-Del Rosario as

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
'Title Two- Real Property Taxation

519

attorney-in-fact, filed a petition with the Maka ti RTC to declare
as null and void the auction sale and to cancel the certificate of
sale issued in favor of Salva.
Ruling: The burden to prove compliance with the validity
of the proceedings leading up to the tax delinquency sale is
incumbent upon the buyer or the winning bidder, which, in this
case, is the respondent Katherine Salva.
In this case, the notice of tax delinquency was not
proven to have been posted and published in accordance
with the requirements of Sec. 254, LGC. Likewise, she failed
to substantiate the fact that the notice was published. The
Affidavit of Publication of the newspaper's publisher as well
as the issues of the newspaper where the notice was published
were not presented as proof.
The notice of delinquency, which was allegedly sent via
registered mail, was improperly addressed. We agree with
Magpile's contention that the billing statements, notice of
realty tax delinquency, and warrants of levy were all sent by
the City Treasurer to "2118 Apolinario St., Bangkal, Makati
City," which is an address other than the one indicated in
his tax records. Notably, TCT No. 215195 showed Magpile's
address as "2118 Apolinario, Makati, Rizal," while the Sworn
Statement stated his address as "1772 Evangelista, Bangkal,
Makati, M.M." In the absence of a registry return card or an
affidavit of service, it cannot be definitely ascertained that
the documents were in fact received by Magpile or any of his
authorized representative.
Further, Salva did not adduce evidence to show that
Magpile received the warrant of levy. That the delinquent
taxpayer must be actually notified of such warrant is implied
from Section 258, which explicitly directs the levying officer
to "submit a report on the levy to the sanggunian concerned
within ten (10) days after receipt of the warrant by the owner of
the property or person having legal interest therein." Contrary
to the opinion of the RTC, "[it] is essential that there be an
actual notice to the delinquent taxpayer, otherwise, the sale.
is null and void although preceded by proper advertisement or
publication. This proceeds from the principle of administrative
proceedings for the sale of private lands for non-payment of
taxes being in personam."

520

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Moreover, Salva did not care to prove that notice of the
levy with the attached warrant was mailed to or served upon the
Assessor and the Register of Deeds of Makati as required under
Sec. 258, LGC and the auction sale was advertised through
posting and publication as required under Sec. 260, LGC all of
which she could have easily verified had she inquired to and
coordinated with the Office of the City Treasurer of Makati.
The public auction of land to satisfy delinquency in the
payment of real estate tax derogates or impinges on property
rights and due process. Thus, the steps prescribed by law are
mandatory and must be strictly followed; if not, the sale of
the real property is invalid and does not make its purchaser
the new owner. Strict adherence to the statutes governing tax
sales is imperative not only for the protection of the taxpayers,
but also to allay any possible suspicion of collusion between the
buyer and the public officials called upon to enforce the laws.
The petition for review on certiorari is DENIED. The
CA Decision and Resolution which reversed the RTC Decision
Branch 150, Makati City, are AFFIRMED. Pursuant to Section
267 of R.A. 7160, considering the invalidity of the sale at public
auction of the real property covered by TCT No. 215195, the
entire amount deposited by respondent Ildefonso P. Magpile
shall be paid to petitioner Katherine Rose Salva.
2.
The requirements for tax delinquency sale under R.A. No.
7160 are mandatory. The tax delinquency sale is null and void.

SOLCO v. MEGAWORLD CORPORATION
G.R. No. 213669, March 5, 2018, Tijam, J.
Facts: Megaworld Corporation was the registered
owner of parking slots covered by Condominium Certificates
of Title (CCT) Nos. 593823 (Two Lafayette property) and
64023 (Manhattan property) located in Two Lafayette
Square Condominium and Manhattan Square Condominium,
respectively, in Makati City.
For failure to pay real property taxes thereon from the
year 2000 to 2008, the City Government of Makati issued a
Warrant of Levy over the subject properties. On December 20,
2005, the properties were sold at a public auction, wherein
Jerome Solco (Solco) emerged as the highest bidder in the

Book II - Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title 'Two Real Property Taxation

521

amount of P33,080.03 for the Two Lafayette property and
P32,356.83 for the Manhattan property.
On the same day, the City Government ofMakati issued
the certificates of sale to Solco. There being no redemption by
Megaworld, a Final Deed of Conveyance was executed by the
local treasurer dated February 22, 2007.
As the CCTs are still under Megaworld's name and the
owner's duplicate copies of the same are still in Mega world's
possession, Solco filed a Petition for Issuance of Four New
Condominium Certificates of Title and to Declare Null and
Void Condominium Certificates of Title Nos. 593823 and 64023
before the RTC of Makati docketed as LRC Case No. M-5031.
Megaworld filed a Comment on/Opposition to the Petition
with Compulsory Counterclaims.

Ruling: Sections 254, 258, and 260 of RA 7160 provide
for the rules on delinquency sales.
The record is barren of any proof that the warrant of levy
was served upon Megaworld or Abdullah Dimaporo as the
beneficial owner/possessor, either personally or by registered
mail. As correctly observed by the CA, the acknowledgment
portion of the warrant of levy is blank and does not indicate
any signature or printed name of Megaworld's representative
or Dimaporo to prove the receipt of the same. Also, the warrant
of levy on its face shows that it was issued on December 20,
2005, which was also the date of the auction sale. Indeed, it
is highly irregular that the warrant of levy was issued on the
same date of the auction sale. It is essential that there be an
actual notice to the delinquent taxpayer, otherwise, the sale is
null and void even if it be preceded by proper advertisement or
publication.
There was likewise no evidence presented and offered
that a written notice of levy with the attached warrant was
mailed to or served upon the assessor and the of Deeds for the
latter to be able to annotate the levy on the tax declaration and
the title, respectively. In this case, the inscription of the Notice
of Levy on the CCT No. 593823 was dated January 5, 2006 or
16 days after the auction sale. Such annotation was done on
the same date that the Certificate of Sale was inscribed on the
title. Further, the reportorial requirements to the Sanggunian

522

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

to be done by the levying officer and the local treasurer,
respectively, were not proven to be complied with. Clearly,
these are violation of RA 716O's provisions above-cited.
At the risk of being repetitive, it bears stressing that
the requirements for tax delinquency sale under RA 7160 are
mandatory.
The instant petition is DENIED. The CA Decision and
Resolution are hereby AFFIRMED. Respondent Megaworld
Corporation is ORDERED to deposit with the trial court the
amount to be paid to petitioner Jerome Solco, pursuant to
Section 267 of Republic Act No. 7160, as the buyer in the tax
delinquency sale adjudged to be null and void in this case.
3.
A buyer ofreal property, at a real property tax delinquency
sale conducted by the City of Caloocan did not acquire any valid
right to petition the trial court for the cancellation of the owner's
title and take possession of the latter's property, on the ground,
among others, that the notice and warrant of levy were sent by the
city to the wrong address and the owner was thus never made aware
of the levy and delinquency sale of its property by the city.
CRUZ v. CITY OF MAKATI
G.R. No. 210894, September 12, 2018, Del Castillo, J.
Facts: Petitioner Noemi Cruz and her husband,
Hermenegildo T. Cruz, were the registered owners of a
124.38-square meter condominium unit, Unit 407, Cityland
Condominium 10, Tower II, 146 H.V. Dela Costa Street,
Makati City which was levied upon by the respondent City of
Makati for non-payment of real property taxes thereon after
their designated employee-representative failed to remit the
entrusted tax payments amounting to P201,231.17 to the city
and appeared to have absconded with the money instead.
Eventually, the subject property was auctioned off
and sold to respondent Laverne Realty and Development
Corporation (Laverne) as the highest bidder for P370,000.00.
Petitioners failed to redeem the subject property,
prompting Laverne to file in 2009, before the Makati RTC
Branch 148, LRC Case No. M-5237 a petition to surrender
the owner's duplicate copy of the title to the subject property
(Condominium Certificate of Title No. 44 793).

623

Previously, or in 2007, petitioners filed before Makati
RTC Branch 62 Civil Case No. 07-1155, a Complaint for
annulment of the Laverne sale with prayer for injunctive relief
and damages and costs.

Ruling: The public auction of land to satisfy delinquency
in the payment of real estate tax derogates or impinges on
property rights and due process. Thus, the steps prescribed by
law are mandatory and must be strictly followed; if not, the sale
of the real property is invalid and does not make its purchaser
the new owner. Strict adherence to the statutes governing tax
sales is imperative not only for the protection of the taxpayers,
but also to allay any possible suspicion of collusion between the
buyer and the public officials called upon to enforce the laws.
(Salva w. Magpile, G.R. No. 220440, November 8, 2017.)
Respondent Laverne Realty utterly failed to show
compliance with the requirements of Sections 254, 258 and 260
LGC. First, no evidence was adduced to prove that the notice of
levy was ever received by the CSDC. There was no proof either
that such notice was served on the occupant of the property.
It is essential that there be an actual notice to the delinquent
taxpayer, otherwise, the sale is null and void although preceded
by proper advertisement or publication. This proceeds from the
principle of administrative proceedings for the sale of private
lands for non-payment of taxes being in personam.
Second, the notice of tax delinquency was not proven to
have been posted at the Makati City Hall and in Barangay
Dasmarii'ias, Makati City, where the property is located. It
was not proven either that the required advertisements were
effected in accordance with law.
The holding of a tax sale despite the absence of the
requisite notice, as in this case, is tantamount to a violation
of the delinquent taxpayer's substantial right to due process.
(Corporate Strategies Development Corp. v. Agjo, 747 Phil. 607,
2014.)
The Petition is GRANTED. The CA and RTC Decisions
are reversed. The Civil Case is reinstated and the RTC of
Makati is ordered to continue with the proceedings.
SEC. 261. Redemption of Property Sold.
Within one (1) year from the date of sale, the owner
of the delinquent real property or person having

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

624

legal interest therein, or his representative, shall
have right to redeem the property upon payment to
the local treasurer of the amount of the delinquent
tax, including the interest due thereon, and the
expenses of sale from the date of delinquency to
the date of sale, plus interest of not more than
two percent (2%) per month on the purchase price
from the date of the sale to the date of redemption.
Such payment shall invalidate the certificate of
sale issued to the purchaser and the owner of the
delinquent real property or person having legal
interest therein shall be entitled to a certificate
of redemption which shall be issued by the local
treasurer or his deputy.
From the date of sale until expiration of the
period of redemption, the delinquent real property
shall remain in the possession of the owner or
person having legal interest therein who shall be
entitled to the income and other fruits thereof.
The local treasurer or his deputy, upon receipt
from the purchaser of the certificate of sale, shall
forthwith return to the latter the entire amount
paid by him plus interest of not more than two
percent (2%) per month. Thereafter, the property
shall be free from the lien of such delinquent tax,
interest due thereon and expenses of sale.
A.

Decided Case

1.
The counting of the one year redemption period of property
sold at public auction for its tax delinquency should be counted from
the date of annotation of the certificate of sale in the proper Register
of Deeds.
CITY MAYOR v. RIZAL COMMERCIAL BANKING
CORPORATION
624 SCRA 469, August 3, 2010, Peralta, J.
Facts: The spouses Roberto and Monette Naval obtained a
loan from respondent RCBC, secured by a real estate mortgage
of properties covered by TCT Nos. N-167986, N-167987, and
N-167988. In 1998, the real estate mortgage was later foreclosed
and the properties were sold at public auction with respondent

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
TYtle Two - Real Property Taxation

525

as the highest bidder. The corresponding Certificates of
Sale were issued in favor of respondent on August 4, 1998.
However, the certificates of sale were allegedly registered only
on February 10, 2004.
Meanwhile, on May 30, 2003, an auction sale of tax
delinquent properties was conducted by the City Treasurer of
Quezon City. Included in the properties that were auctioned
were two (2) townhouse units covered by TCT Nos. N-167986
and N-167987 and the parcel of land covered by TCT No.
N-167988. For these delinquent properties, Alvin Emerson S.
Yu was adjudged as the highest bidder. Upon payment of the
tax delinquencies, he was issued the corresponding Certificate
of Sale of Delinquent Property.
On February 10, 2004, the Certificate of Sale of Delinquent
Property was registered with the Office of the Register of Deeds
of Quezon City.
On June 10, 2004, respondent tendered payment for all
of the assessed tax delinquencies, interest, and other costs of
the subject properties with the Office of the City Treasurer,
Quezon City. However, the Office of the City Treasurer refused
to accept said tender of payment.
Ruling: City Ordinance No. SP-91, S-93 otherwise
known as the Quezon City Revenue Code of 1993, is explicit
that the one-year redemption period should be counted from
the date of the annotation of the sale of the property at the
proper registry. At first glance, this provision runs counter to
that of Section 261 of R.A. No. 7160 which provides that the
one year redemption period shall be counted from the date of
sale of the tax delinquent property. There is, therefore, a need
to reconcile these seemingly conflicting provisions of a general
law and a special law.
To harmonize the provisions of the two laws and to
maintain the policy of the law to aid rather than to defeat the
owner's right to redeem his property, Section 14 (a), Paragraph
7 of City Orclinance No. SP-91, S-93 should be construed as
to define the phrase "one (1) year from the date of sale" as
appearing in Section 261 of R.A. No. 7160, to mean "one (1)
year from the date of the annotation of the sale of the property
at the proper registry."

626

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Consequently, the counting of the one (1) year redemption
period of property sold at public auction for its tax delinquency
should be counted from the date of annotation of the certificate
of sale in the proper Register of Deeds. Applying the foregoing to
the case at bar, from the date of registration of the Certificate of
Sale of Delinquent Property on February 10, 2004, respondent
had until February 10, 2005 to redeem the subject properties.
Hence, its tender of payment of the subject properties' tax
delinquencies and other fees on June 10, 2004, was well within
the redemption period, and it was manifest error on the part of
petitioners to have refused such tender of payment.
The petition is DENIED.
SEC. 262. Final Deed to Purchaser.
In
case the owner or person having legal interest
therein fails to redeem the delinquent property as
provided herein, the local treasurer shall execute
a deed conveying to the purchaser said property,
free from lien of the delinquent tax, interest due
thereon and expenses of sale. The deed shall briefly
state the proceedings upon which the validity of
the sale rests.
SEC. 263. Purchase of Property by the Local
Government Units for Want of Bidder.
In case
there is no bidder for the real property advertised
for sale as provided herein, or if the highest bid is
for an amount insufficient to pay the real property
tax and the related interest and costs of sale the
local treasurer conducting the sale shall purchase
the property in behalf of the local government
unit concerned to satisfy the claim and within
two (2) days thereafter shall make a report of his
proceedings which shall be reflected upon the
records of his office. It shall be the duty of the
Registrar of Deeds concerned, upon registration
with his office of any such declaration of forfeiture
to transfer the title of the forfeited property to
the local government unit concerned without the
necessity of an order from a competent court.
Within one (1) year from the date of such
forfeiture, the taxpayer or any of his representative
may redeem the property by paying to the local

treasurer the full amount of the real property tax
and the related interest and the costs of sale. If the
property is not redeemed as provided herein, the
ownership thereof shall be fully vested on the local
government unit concerned.
SEC. 264. Resale ofReal Estate Taken for Taxes,
Fees, or Charges.
The sanggunian concerned
may, by ordinance duly approved and upon notice
of not less than twenty (20) days, sell and dispose
of the real property acquired under the preceding
Section at public auction. The proceeds of the
sale shall accrue to the general fund of the local
government unit concerned.

may be repeated if necessary until the full amount
due, including all expenses, is collected.
SEC. 266. Collection of Real Property Tax
Through the Courts. - The local government unit
concerned may enforce the collection of the basic
real property tax or any other tax levied under
this Title by civil action in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The civil action shall be filed by the
local treasurer within the period prescribed in
Section 270 of this Code.
SEC. 267. Action Assailing Validity of Tax Sale.
No court shall entertain any action assailing
the validity of any sale at public auction of real
property or rights therein under this Title until
the taxpayer shall have deposited with the court
the amount for which the real property was sold,
together with interest of two percent (2%) per
month from the date of sale to the time of the
institution of the action. The amount so deposited
shall be paid to the purchaser at the auction sale if
the deed is declared invalid but it shall be returned
to the depositor if the action fails. Neither shall
any court declare a sale at public auction invalid
by reason of irregularities or informalities in the
proceedings unless the substantive rights of the
delinquent owner of the real property or the person
having legal interest therein have been impaired.

Decided Case

1.
The CA erred in taking cognizance of the case. Section 267
of R.A. 7160 explicitly provides that a court shall not entertain any
action assailing the validity of sale at public auction of real property
unless the taxpayer deposits with the court the amount for which
the real property was sold, together with interest of two percent (2%)
per month from the date of sale to the time of the institution of the
action. A perusal of the records would show that BRC was properly
notified of its tax delinquency and of the proceedings relative to the
auction sale; hence, its right as a taxpayer and the owner of the
subject property was adequately protected.
GAMILLA v. BURGUNDY REALTY CORPORATION
760 SCRA 237, June 22, 2015, Mendoza, J.
Facts: Respondent Burgundy Realty Corporation (BRC)
was the registered owner of a condominium unit with a total
floor area of thirty (30) square meters, covered by Condominium
Certificate of Title (CCT No. 5708, located at B. Gonzales,
Loyola Heights, Diliman, Quezon City (subject property).
On July 28, 2005, the City Treasurer sent the Final Notice
of Delinquency to BRC as the real estate tax on the subject
property remained unpaid and had been included in the list of
delinquent real properties.
Thereafter, the Warrant of Levy was issued by the City
Treasurer on the subject property and caused its inscription
and annotation on Tax Declaration No. D-056-08799. The
Notice of Levy was then annotated on CCT No. 5708 and
registered with the Register of Deeds (RD).
On September 15, 2005, the public auction was conducted
and petitioner Ofelia Gamilla (Gamilla) was declared the
highest bidder. On September 30, 2005, a certificate of sale was
issued in her favor. Subsequently, the City Treasurer caused
the annotation of the certificate of sale with the RD.
Subsequently, Gamilla fled a petition for the cancellation
of CCT No. 5708 with the RTC praying for the issuance of a
new CCT.
BRC opposed the petition contending that the auction
sale failed to comply with the requirements of Section 176 of
Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7160.

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title 'Two- Real Property Taxation

529

Ruling: On the first issue, the CA erred in taking
cognizance of the case. Section 267 of R.A. No. 7160 explicitly
provides that a court shall not entertain any action assailing
the validity or sale at public auction of real property unless the
taxpayer deposits with the court the amount for which the real
property was sold, together with interest of two percent (2%)
per month from the date of sale to the time of the institution
of the action. This condition is a jurisdictional requirement,
the nonpayment of which warrants the dismissal of the action.
Considering that BRC did not make such deposit, the RTC
should not have acted on the opposition of BRC.
The second issue is on the notice of delinquency under
Sections 176 and 178 of R.A. No. 7160.
In the present case, a perusal of the records would show
that BRC was properly notified of its tax delinquency and of
the proceedings relative to the auction sale; hence, its right as a
taxpayer and the owner of the subject property was adequately
protected.
The records bear out that the statement of delinquency
was sent to BRC stating that the realty tax on the subject
property had not been paid from years 1997 to 2004 and
including the computation of the amount of the taxes due
and penalties. BRC, in fact, acknowledged the receipt of this
statement of delinquency in its opposition before the RTC. It,
however, contended that such statement was not the notice
required by law.
The argument is not tenable. Though the statement of
delinquency was not captioned as "Notice of Delinquency," its
contents nonetheless sufficiently informed BRC of its deficiency
in real property taxes and the penalty with a reminder to
settle its tax obligation immediately in order to avoid legal
inconvenience. Furthermore, aside from this statement of
delinquency, the City Treasurer sent to BRC, through personal
service, the Final Notice of Delinquency, dated July 28, 2005.
In the said notice, BRC was again reminded of its unpaid
realty taxes and penalties and was informed that the subject
property was included in the list of delinquent real properties
and was scheduled for auction on September 15, 2005. This
final notice was followed by the Warrant of Levy, both of which
were received by Arlene Tayag, on behalf of BRC.
The petition is GRAN TED.

If there is competent evidence that the realty tax due on
the property subject of the tax sale has been seasonably and fully

located in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig City, which are covered by TCT
1033-P and 1034-P (subject two lots). The total assessed market
value of the subject two lots is P13,692,000.00 (P6,870,000.00
for the first lot and P6,822,000.00 for the second lot) as shown
in their tax declarations.
The City Government of Taguig sent two letters dated
November 6, 2007 to BHC, requiring the settlement of real
property taxes on the subject two lots for the years 2005, 2006,
and the 4" quarter of 2007 in the amounts of P414,132.18
and P411,238.68 within the month of November 2007 to avoid
penalties of 2% per month.
BHC paid P825,370.86 to the City Treasurer's Office of
Taguig City for which Official Receipt No. 8625735 V dated
November 29, 2007 was issued.
However, even prior to the November 6, 2007 letters, the
subject two lots had already been declared delinquent pursuant
to a Notice of Delinquency posted on October 22, 2007, levied
upon through a Warrant of Levy on September 26, 2007,
advertised for sale on November 5, 2007 and November 12,
2007 by public auction to satisfy the taxes, penalties due and
costs of sale in the amounts of P224,670.48 and P223,100.73
for the subject two lots, respectively, and were sold at public
auction to respondent Mark Anthony M. Litonjua (Litonjua)
on November 15, 2007 for P6,901,523.00 and Pl0,601,523.00,
respectively.

Ruling: The precondition for the operation of Section 267
is the realty tax delinquency of the property. If the property
is current in its realty tax or not realty tax delinquent, then
it should not be the subject of a sale at public auction as
contemplated in Section 267.
In the present case, the very issue raised in the Petition is
the invalidity of the auction sales on the ground that the subject

Book II - Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Two-- Real Property Taxation

531

properties are not tax delinquent. On the assumption that the
subject two lots are not tax delinquent, then there is no need
for the deposit requirement under Section 267 because the
realty taxes due on the subject two lots have already been paid
and there are no tax delinquencies to be collected or satisfied.
The unfairness of the deposit requirement as it is applied
in this case is clear.
For the first property, the deposit amount required
under Section 267, if followed, is "the amount for which
the real property was sold" - P6,901,523.00, "together with
interest of two percent (2%) per month from the date of sale
to the time of the institution of the action" - P4,140,913.80.
Interest per month is P138,030.46 or 2% of P6,901,523.00.
P138,030.46 multiplied by 30 months is P4,140,913.80, the
interest component of the deposit. Thus, the required deposit
is a staggering P11,042,436.80 or 49 times the tax delinquency
penalty and costs ofsale.
For the second property, the deposit being required is
so much more. Given that the bid amount is P10,601,523.50,
the 2% interest per month amounts to P212,030.47. Total
interest for 30 months is P6,360,914.10. Thus, the required
deposit under Section 267 is a more staggering amount of
P16,962,437.60 or 76 times the tax delinquency, penalty and
costs ofsale.
For both properties, the deposit being required from BHC
is P28,004,874.40.
It must also be noted that the billing letters dated
November 6, 2007 mention "Real Property Tax from year
2005 to 2006 and the 4% Quarter of 2007" and the Final Bills
of Sale refer to "the real property tax x x x accrued for the
years 4 Qtr. 2005-2007 and has not been paid and remained
delinquent." The payment was made by BHC on November 29
2007 which was well within the due date for the payment of
the installment for the 4quarter of 2007 pursuant to Section
250 of the LGC

If there is competent evidence that the realty tax due on
the property subject of the tax sale has been seasonably and
fully paid, then the deposit requirement under Section 267 does
not serve its intended purpose and ceases to be jurisdictional.

I.
The authority to expend the Special Education Fund
(SEF) for the operation and maintenance of extension classes of
public schools carries with it the authority to utilize the SEF not only
for the salaries and allowances of the teaching personnel, but those
of the non-teaching personnel alike who were hired as a necessary
and indispensable auxiliary to the teaching staff.
PROVINCE OF CAMA RINES SUR v. THE
COMMISSION ON AUDIT
G.R. No. 227926, March 10, 2020, Reyes, J. Jr., J.
Facts: To accommodate the growing number of enrollees
in public schools, petitioner Province of Camarines Sur with
Governor Miguel Luis R. Villafuerte started hiring in 1999
temporary teaching personnel to handle extension classes of
existing public schools, as well as non-teaching personnel in
connection with the establishment and maintenance of these
extension classes. The salaries of the personnel hired were
charged to the Special Education Fund (SEF).
Ruling: As for the non-teaching personnel, the Court
agrees with the petitioner that the authority to expend the
SEF for the operation and maintenance of extension classes
of public schools carries with it the authority to utilize the
SEF not only for the salaries and allowances of the teaching
personnel, but those of the non-teaching personnel alike who
were hired as a necessary and indispensable auxiliary to the
teaching staff. It is beyond question that the services of these
non-teaching personnel are essential to the sound and efficient
operation and maintenance of these extension classes. Without
them, it would be impossible to hold these extension classes

(a) On the first year of the effectivity of this
Code, thirty percent (30%);
(b) On the second year, thirty-five percent
(35%); and
(c) On the third year and thereafter, forty

Provided, That in the event that the National

be entitled to receive the amount equivalent to the

A.

Decided Case

1.
The President cannot direct LGUs to reduce their
expenditures by 25%. This will interfere with local autonomy. Also,
there are requisites before the President may interfere in local fiscal
matters.
PIMENTEL, JR. v. AGUIRRE
336 SCRA 201, July 19, 2000, Panganiban, J.
Facts: Petitioner Aquilino Q. Pimentel Jr. questions the
validity of Section 1 of Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 372 of
President Fidel V. Ramos.
Issue: Whether Section 1 of A.O. 372, insofar as it
"directs" LGUs to reduce their expenditures by twenty-five
percent (25%) is a valid exercise of the President's power of
general supervision over local governments.
Held: Local fiscal autonomy does not rule out any manner
of national government intervention by way of supervision, in
order to ensure that local programs, fiscal and otherwise, are
consistent with national goals. Significantly, the President, by
constitutional fiat, is the head of the economic and planning
agency of the government. However, under the Constitution,
the formulation and the implementation of such policies and
programs are subject to "consultations with the appropriate
public agencies, various private sectors, and local government
units." The President cannot do so unilaterally.
Consequently, under Section 284, Local Government
Code there are several requisites before the President may
interfere in local fiscal matters: (1) an unmanaged public
sector deficit of the national government; (2) consultations
with the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of
Representatives and the presidents of the various local leagues;
and (3) the corresponding recommendation of the secretaries of
the Department of Finance, Interior and Local Government,
and Budget and Management. Furthermore, any adjustment
in the allotment shall in no case be less than thirty percent

Book II - Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Three Shares of Local Government Units in the
Proceeds of National Taxes

541

(30%) of the collection of national internal revenue taxes of the
third fiscal year preceding the current one.
Petitioner points out that respondents failed to comply with
these requisites before the issuance and the implementation of
A.O. 372. At the very least, they did not even try to show that
the national government was suffering from an unmanageable
public sector deficit. Neither did they claim having conducted
consultations with the different leagues of local governments.
Without these requisites, the President has no authority to
adjust, much less to reduce, unilaterally the LGU's internal
revenue allotment.
While the wordings of Section 1 of A.O. 372 have a rather
commanding tone, and while we agree with petitioner that
the requirements of Section 284 of the Local Government
Code have not been satisfied, we are prepared to accept the
solicitor' general's assurance that the directive to "identify and
implement measures ... that will reduce total expenditures
... by at least twenty-five percent (25%) of authorized regular
appropriation" is merely advisory in character, and does not
constitute a mandatory or binding order that interferes with
local autonomy.
The Petition is GRANTED. Respondents and their
successors are hereby permanently PROHIBITED from
implementing Administrative Order Nos. 372 and 43,
respectively dated December 27, 1997 and December 10, 1998,
insofar as local government units are concerned.
2.
The phrase national internal revenue taxes engrafted in
Section 284, LGC is undoubtedly more restrictive than the term
national taxes written in Section 6, Article X, 1987 Constitution.
As such, Congress has actually departed from the letter of the
1987 Constitution stating that national taxes should be the base
from which the just share of the LGU comes. Such departure is
impermissible and unconstitutional.
MANDANAS v. OCHOA, JR.
G.R. No. 199802, July 3, 2018, Bersamin, J.
Facts: G.R. No. 199802 (Mandanas, et al.) is a special
civil action for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus assailing
the manner the General Appropriations Act (GAA) for FY 2012
computed the IRA for the LGUs.

542

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Mandanas, et al. allege herein that certain collections of
NIRTs by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) - specifically: excise
taxes, value added taxes (VATs) and documentary stamp taxes
(DSTs) - have not been included in the base amounts for the
computation of the IRA.
In G.R. No. 208488, Congressman Enrique Garcia, Jr.,
the lone petitioner, seeks the writ of mandamus to compel the
respondents thereat to compute the just share of the LG Us on
the basis of all national taxes.
It is noted that named as common respondents were the
then incumbent Executive Secretary, Secretary of Finance,
the Secretary of the Department of Budget and Management
(DBM), and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. In addition,
Mandanas, et al. impleaded the National Treasurer, while
Garcia added the Commissioner of Customs.

Ruling: Section 6, Article X the 1987 Constitution
textually commands the allocation to the LG Us of a just share
in the national taxes, viz..'
Section 6. Local government units shall have a just
share, as determined by law, in the national taxes which
shall be automatically released to them.
Section 6, when parsed, embodies three mandates,
namely: (1) the LGUs shall have a just share in the national
taxes; (2) the just share shall be determined by law; and (3) the
just share shall be automatically released to the LG Us.
Congress has sought to carry out the second mandate of
Section 6 by enacting Section 284, Title III (Shares of Local
Government Units in the Proceeds of National Taxes), of the
LGC.
Although the power of Congress to make laws is plenary
in nature, congressional lawmaking remains subject to the
limitations stated in the 1987 Constitution. The phrase
national internal revenue taxes engrafted in Section 284 is
undoubtedly more restrictive than the term national taxes
written in Section 6. As such, Congress has actually departed
from the letter of the 1987 Constitution stating that national
taxes should be the base from which the just share of the LGU
comes. Such departure is impermissible. Verba legis non est

Book II
Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title 'Three Shares of Local Government Units in the
Proceeds of National Taxes

643

recedendum (from the words of a statute there should be no
departure). Equally impermissible is that Congress has also
thereby curtailed the guarantee of fiscal autonomy in favor of
the LGUs under the 1987 Constitution.
What the phrase national internal revenue taxes as used
in Section 284 included are all the taxes enumerated in Section
21 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), as amended
by R.A. No. 8424, viz.:
Section 21. Sources of Revenue. - The following
taxes, fees and charges are deemed to be national internal
revenue taxes: (a) Income tax; (b) Estate and donor's
taxes; (c) Value-added tax; (d) Other percentage taxes;
(e) Excise taxes; (f) Documentary stanlp taxes; and (g)
Such other taxes as are or hereafter may be imposed and
collected by the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
In view of the foregoing enumeration of what are the
national internal revenue taxes, Section 284 has effectively
deprived the LGUs from deriving their just share from other
national taxes, like the customs duties.
Strictly speaking, customs duties are also taxes because
they are exactions whose proceeds become public funds.
According to Garcia v. Executive Secretary, G.R. No. 101273,
July 3, 1992 customs duties is the nomenclature given to taxes
imposed on the importation and exportation of commodities
and merchandise to or from a foreign country. Although
customs duties have either or both the generation of revenue
and the regulation of economic or social activity as their
moving purposes, it is often difficult to say which of the two
is the principal objective in a particular instance, for, verily,
customs duties, much like internal revenue taxes, are rarely
designed to achieve only one policy objective. We further note
that Section 102(00) of R.A. No. 10863 (Customs Modernization
and TariffAct) expressly includes all fees and charges imposed
under the Act under the blanket term of taxes.
It is clear from the foregoing clarification that the
exclusion of other national taxes like customs duties from the
base for determining the just share of the LGUs contravened
the express constitutional edict in Section 6, Article X the 1987
Constitution.

Facts: (See Main Decision)
Ruling: In recapitulation, the national taxes to be
included in the base for computing the just share the LGUs
shall henceforth be, but shall not be limited to, the following:
1.
The NIRTs enumerated in Section 21 of the
NIRC, as amended, to be inclusive of the VATs, excise
taxes, and DSTs collected by the BIR and the BOC, and
their deputized agents;

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

2.

Tariff and customs duties collected by the BOC;

3.
50% of the VATs collected in the ARMM, and
30% of all other national taxes collected in the ARMM;
the remaining 50% of the VA Ts and 70% of the collections
of the other national taxes in the ARMM shall be the
exclusive share of the ARMM pursuant to Section 9 and
Section 15 of R.A. No. 9054;
4.
60% of the national taxes collected from the
exploitation and development of the national wealth; the
remaining 40% will exclusively accrue to the host LGUs
pursuant to Section 290 of the LGC;
5.
85% of the excise taxes collected from locally
manufactured Virginia and other tobacco products; the
remaining 15% shall accrue to the special purpose funds
pursuant created in R.A. No. 7171 and R.A. No. 7227;
6.
The entire 50% of the national taxes collected
under Section 106, Section 108 and Section 116 of the
NIRC in excess of the increase in collections for the
immediately preceding year; and
7.
5% of the franchise truces in favor of the national
government paid by franchise holders in accordance with
Section 6 of R.A. No. 6631 and Section 8 of R.A. No. 6632.
The court has expressly mandated the prospective
application of its ruling.
It becomes unavoidable to ask when the adjusted amounts
will be granted in favor of LGUs. The OSG suggests that the
adjusted amounts be given to the LG Us starting with the 2022
budget cycle.
The suggestion of the OSG is well taken.
The adjusted amounts can be deemed effective only after
this ruling has lapsed into finality, which is procedurally
to be reckoned only from the denial of the OSG's motion for
reconsideration through this resolution. From then onwards,
and as ruled herein, the ju.st share should be based on all
national taxes collected on "the third fiscal year preceding." In
the absence of any amendment by Congress, the rates fixed in
Section 284 of the LGC, as herein modified shall control.

any lien or holdback that may be imposed by the
National Government for whatever purpose.
(b) Nothing in this Chapter shall be

A.

Decided Case

1.
The President cannot order the withholding of 10% of the
LGUs internal revenue allotments. This encroaches on the fiscal
autonomy of local governments and violates the Constitution and
the LGC.
PIMENTEL, JR. v. AGUIRRE
336 SCRA 201, July 19, 2000, Panganiban, J.
Facts: Petitioner Aquilino Q. Pimentel Jr. questions the
validity of Section 4 of Administrative Order (A.O.) No. 372 of
President Fidel V. Ramos.
Issue: Whether Sec. 4 of A.O. 372 which withholds 10% of
LG Us internal revenue allotments is valid.
Ruling: Section 4 of A.O. 372 cannot, be upheld. A basic
feature of local fiscal autonomy is the automatic release of

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Three - Shares of Local Government Units in the
Proceeds of National Taxes

551

the shares of LGUs in the national internal revenue. This is
mandated by no less than the Constitution (Sec. 6 of Art. X).
The Local Government Code (Sec. 286) specifies further that
the release shall be made directly to the LGU concerned within
five (6) days after every quarter of the year and "shall not be
subject to any lien or holdback that may be imposed by the
national government for whatever purpose." As a rule, the term
"shall" is a word of command that must be given a compulsory
meaning. The provision is, therefore, imperative.
Section 4 of A.O. 372, however, orders the withholding,
effective January 1, 1998 of 10 percent of the LGUs' IRA
"pending the assessment and evaluation by the Development
Budget Coordinating Committee of the emerging fiscal
situation" in the country. Such withholding clearly contravenes
the Constitution and the law. Although temporary, it is
equivalent to a holdback which means "something held back or
withheld, often temporarily." Hence, the "temporary" nature of
the retention by the national government does not matter. Any
retention is prohibited.
In sum, while Section 1 of A.O. 372 may be upheld as an
advisory effected in times of national crisis, Section 4 thereof
has no color of validity at all. The latter provision effectively
encroaches on the fiscal autonomy of local governments.
Concededly, the President was well-intentioned in issuing his
Order to withhold the LG Us' IRA, but the rule of law requires
that even the best intentions must be carried out within the
parameters of the Constitution and the law. Verily, laudable
purposes must be carried out by legal methods.
Respondents and their successors are hereby permanently
PROHIBITED from implementing Administrative Order Nos.
372 and 43, insofar as local government units are concerned.
2.
The entire process involving the distribution and release
of the LGSEF is constitutionally impermissible. The LGSEF is part
of the IRA or "just share" of the LG Us in the national taxes. To subject
its distribution and release to the vagaries of the implementing
rules and regulations, including the guidelines and mechanisms
unilaterally prescribed by the Oversight Committee from time to
time, as sanctioned by the assailed provisos in the GAAs of 1999,
2000 and 2001 and the OCD resolutions, makes the release not
automatic, a flagrant violation of the constitutional and statutory

552

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

mandate that the "just share" of the LG Us "shall be automatically
released to them. Any amendment to the Local Government Code
of 1991 should be done in a separate law, not in the appropriations
law, because Congress cannot include in a general appropriation
bill matters that should be more properly enacted in a separate
legislation.

PROVINCE OF BATANGAS v. ROMULO
429 SCRA 736, May 27, 2004, Callejo, J.
Facts: The Province of Batangas, represented by its
Governor, Hermilando I. Mandanas, filed the present petition
for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus to declare as
unconstitutional and void certain provisos contained in the
General Appropriations Acts (GAA) of 1999, 2000 and 2001,
insofar as they uniformly earmarked for each corresponding
year the amount of five billion pesos (1'5,000,000,000.00) of the
Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) for the Local Government
Service Equalization Fund (LGSEF) and imposed conditions
for the release thereof.
Under Rep. Act No. 8760, otherwise known as the GAA
of 2000, the amount of P111,778,000,000 was allotted as the
share of the LG Us in the internal revenue taxes. As in the GAA
of 1999, the GAA of 2000 contained a proviso earmarking five
billion pesos of the IRA for the LGSEF. This proviso, found
in Item No. l, Special Provisions, Title XXXV II -- A. Internal
Revenue Allotment, was similarly worded as that contained in
the GAA of 1999.
The Oversight Committee, in its Resolution No. OCD2000-023 dated June 22, 2000, adopted the following allocation
scheme governing the five billion pesos LGSEF for 2000:
1.
The PhP3.5 Billion of the CY 2000 LGSEF shall
be allocated to and shared by the four levels of LG Us, i.e.,
provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays, using
the following percentage-sharing formula agreed upon
and jointly endorsed by the various Leagues of LG Us:
For Provinces 26% or I' 910,000,000
For Cities 23% or 806,000,000
For Municipalities 35% or 1,225,000,000
For Barangays 16% or 560,000,000

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Three - Shares of Local Government Units in the
Proceeds of National Taxes

653

Provided that the respective Leagues representing
the provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays shall
draw up and adopt the horizontal distribution/sharing
schemes among the member LGUs whereby the Leagues
concerned may opt to adopt direct financial assistance
or project-based arrangement, such that the LGSEF
allocation for individual LGU shall be released directly to
the LGU concerned;
xxx

Ruling: The assailed provisos in the GAAs of 1999, 2000
and 2001 and the OCD resolutions violate the constitutional
precept on local autonomy.
Section 6, Article X of the Constitution provides: Local
government units shall have a just share, as determined by
law, in the national taxes which shall be automatically released
to them.
When parsed, it would be readily seen that this provision
mandates that (1) the LGUs shall have a "just share" in the
national taxes; (2) the "just share" shall be determined by law;
and (3) the "just share" shall be automatically released to the
LGUs.
The Local Government Code of 1991, among its salient
provisions, underscores the automatic release of the LGUs'
"just share" in this wise:
Sec. 18. Power to Generate and Apply Resources
x xx; to have a_just share in national taxes which shall be
automatically and directly released to them without need
of further action;
Sec. 286. Automatic Release of Shares. (a) The share
of each local government unit shall be released, without
need of any further action, directly to the provincial,
city, municipal or barangay treasurer. as the case may
be, on a quarterly basis within five (5) days after the end
of each quarter, and which shall not be subject to any
lien or holdback that may be imposed by the national
government for whatever purpose
(b) Nothing in this Chapter shall be understood
to diminish the share of local government units under
existing laws.

654

THE LOCAL GOVERNM ENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

The entire process involving the distribution and release
of the LGSEF is constitutionally impermissible. The LGSEF
is part of the IRA or "just share" of the LGUs in the national
taxes. To subject its distribution and release to the vagaries
of the implementing rules and regulations, including the
guidelines and mechanisms unilaterally prescribed by the
Oversight Committee from time to time, as sanctioned by the
assailed provisos in the GAAs of 1999, 2000 and 2001 and the
OCD resolutions, makes the release not automatic, a flagrant
violation of the constitutional and statutory mandate that the
"just share" of the LGUs "shall be automatically released to
them."
Indeed, the Oversight Committee exercising discretion,
even control, over the distribution and release of a portion of
the IRA, the LGSEF, is an anathema to and subversive of the
principle of local autonomy as embodied in the Constitution.
The assailed provisos in the GAAs of 1999, 2000 and 2001
and the OCD resolutions cannot amend Section 285 of the
Local Government Code of 1991 which specifics how the IRA
shall be allocated among the LG Us.
However, this percentage sharing is not followed with
respect to the five billion pesos LGSEF as the assailed OCD
resolutions, implementing the assailed provisos in the GAAs of
1999, 2000 and 2001, provided for a different sharing scheme.
For example, for 1999, P2 billion of the LGSEF was allocated
as follows: Provinces - 40%; Cities - 20%; Municipalities
- 40%. For 2000, P3.5 billion of the LGSEF was allocated in
this manner: Provinces - 26%; Cities - 23%; Municipalities 35%; Barangays - 26%. For 2001, P3 billion of the LGSEF was
allocated, thus: Provinces - 25%; Cities - 25%; Municipalities
- 35%; Barangays - 15%.
A general appropriations bill is a special type oflegislation,
whose content is limited to specified sums of money dedicated
to a specific purpose or a separate fiscal unit. Any provision
therein which is intended to amend another law is considered
an "inappropriate provision." The category of "inappropriate
provisions" includes unconstitutional provisions and provisions
which are intended to amend other laws, because clearly these
kinds of laws have no place in an appropriations bill.

Increasing or decreasing the IRA of the LGUs or
modifying their percentage sharing therein, which are fixed
in the Local Government Code of 1991, are matters of general
and substantive law. To permit Congress to undertake these
amendments through the GAAs, as the respondents contend,
would be to give Congress the unbridled authority to unduly
infringe the fiscal autonomy of the LGUs, and thus put the
same in jeopardy every year. This, the Court cannot sanction.
The petition is GRANTED. The assailed provisos
in the General Appropriations Acts of 1999, 2000 and
2001, and the assailed OCD Resolutions, are declared
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
3.
The General Appropriations Act provisions: XXXVI I and
LIV Special Provisions 1 and 4 of the Year 2000 GAA, are hereby
declared unconstitutional insofar as they set apart a portion of the
IRA, in the amount of PIO Billion, as part of the UNPROGRAMM ED

shall be released only when the original revenue targets

There is no substantial difference between the withholding
of IRA involved in Pimentel and that in the present case,
except that here it is the legislature, not the executive, which
has authorized the withholding of the IRA. The distinction
notwithstanding, the ruling in Pimentel remains applicable.
As explained above, Article X, Section 6 of the Constitution
- the same provision relied upon in Pimentel - enjoins both
the legislative and executive branches of government. Hence,
as in Pimentel, under the same constitutional provision, the
legislative is barred from withholding the release of the IRA.

based on a quarterly assessment to be conducted by certain
committees which the GAA specifies, namely, the Development
Budget Coordinating Committee, the Committee on Finance of
the Senate, and the Committee on Appropriations of the House
of Representatives.
On August 22, 2000, a number of non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and people's organizations, along with
three barangay officials filed with this Court the petition at bar,
for Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus With Application
for Temporary Restraining Order, against respondents then
Executive Secretary Ronalda Zamora, et. al. challenging
the constitutionality of above-quoted provision of XXX VII
(ALLOCATIONS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS)
referred to by petitioners as Section 1, XXXVI I (A), and LIV
(UNPROGRAMM ED FUND) Special Provisions 1 and 4 of the
GAA (the GAA provisions).

The petition is GRANT ED. XXXVI I and LIV Special
Provisions 1 and 4 of the Year 2000 GAA are hereby declared
unconstitutional insofar as they set apart a portion of the IRA,
in the amount of PlO Billion, as part of the UNPROGRAMM ED
FUND.
SEC. 287. Local Development Projects.
Each local government unit shall appropriate
in its annual budget no less than twenty percent
(20%) of its annual internal revenue allotment for
development projects. Copies of the development
plans of local government units shall be furnished
the Department of Interior and Local Government.

Ruling: Article X, Section 6 of the Constitution provides:
SECTION 6. Local government units shall have a
just share, as determined by law, in the national taxes
which shall be automatically released to them.
Petitioners argue that the GAA violated this constitutional
mandate when it made the release of IRA contingent on
whether revenue collections could meet the revenue targets
originally submitted by the President, rather than making the
release automatic.
As the Constitution lays upon the executive the duty to
automatically release the just share of local governments in
the national taxes, so it enjoins the legislature not to pass laws
that might prevent the executive from performing this duty.
To hold that the executive branch may disregard constitutional
provisions which define its duties, provided it has the backing
of statute, is virtually to make the Constitution amendable by
statute - a proposition which is patently absurd.
To interpret the term automatic release in such a broad
manner would be inconsistent with the ruling in Pimentel u,
Aguirre , 336 SCRA 201 (2000). In the said case, the executive
withheld the release of the IRA pending an assessment very
similar to the one provided in the GAA. This Court ruled that
such withholding contravened the constitutional mandate of
an automatic release.

A.

Decided Case

1.
A reading of MC No. 2010-138 shows that it is a mere
reiteration of an existing provision in the LGC. It was plainly
intended to remind LGUs to faithfully observe the directive stated
in Section 287 of the LGC to utilize the 20% portion of the IRA for
development projects. In common understanding, development
means the realization of desirable social, economic and environmental
outcomes essential in the attainment of the constitutional objective
of a desired quality of life for all.

in his capacity as then Secretary of DILG issued:
(a) Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2010-83 dated
August 31, 2010, pertaining to the full disclosure of local
budget and finances, and bids and public offerings;

658

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

(b) MC No. 2011-08 dated January 13, 2011,
pertaining to the strict adherence to Section 90 of Republic
Act (R.A.) No. 10147 or the General Appropriations Act of
2011.
On December 2, 2010, the respondent issued MC No. 2010138, reiterating that 20% component of the IRA shall be utilized
for desirable social, economic and environmental outcomes
essential to the attainment of the constitutional objective of a
quality of life for all. It also listed the following enumeration of
expenses for which the fund must not be utilized, viz:
1.
Administrative expenses such as cash gifts,
bonuses, food allowance, medical assistance, uniforms,
supplies, meetings, communication, water and light,
petroleum products, and the like;
2.
3.
foreign;

Salaries, wages or overtime pay;
Travelling expenses, whether domestic or

4.
Registration or participation fees in training,

5.
Construction, repair or refinishing of administrative offices;
6.
Purchase of administrative office furniture,
fixtures, equipment or appliances; and
7.
Purchase, maintenance or repair of motor
vehicles or motorcycles, except ambulances.
Ruling: A reading of MC No. 2010-138 shows that it
is a mere reiteration of an existing provision in the LGC. It
was plainly intended to remind LG Us to faithfully observe the
directive stated in Section 287 of the LGC to utilize the 20%
portion of the IRA for development projects. It was, at best,
an advisory to LG Us to examine themselves if they have been
complying with the law. It must be recalled that the assailed
circular was issued in response to the report of the COA that
a substantial portion of the 20% development fund of some
LGUs was not actually utilized for development projects but
was diverted to expenses more properly categorized as MOOE,
in violation of Section 287 of the LGC. This intention was

Book II - Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Three Shares of Local Government Units in the
Proceeds of National 'Taxes

569

highlighted in the very first paragraph of MC No. 2010-138,
which reads:
Section 287 of the Local Government Code mandates
every local government to appropriate in its annual
budget no less than 20% of its annual revenue allotment
for development projects. In common understanding,
development means the realization of desirable social,
economic and environmental outcomes essential in the
attainment of the constitutional objective of a desired
quality of life for all.
That the term development was characterized as the
"realization of desirable social, economic and environmental
outcome" does not operate as a restriction of the term so as
to exclude some other activities that may bring about the
same result. The definition was a plain characterization of the
concept of development as it is commonly understood.
The same clarification may be said of the enumeration
of expenses in MC No. 2010-138. The enumerated items
comprised the expenses which the COA perceived to have been
improperly earmarked or charged against the development
fund based on the audit it conducted.
As in MC No. 2010-138, the Court finds nothing in two
other questioned issuances of the respondent, i.e., MC Nos.
2010-83 and 2011-08, that can be construed as infringing
on the fiscal autonomy of LGUs. It is inconceivable how the
publication of budgets, expenditures, contracts and loans and
procurement plans ofLGUs required in the assailed issuances
could have infringed on the local fiscal autonomy of LGUs.
Firstly, the issuances do not interfere with the discretion of
the LG Us in the specification of their priority projects and the
allocation of their budgets. The posting requirements are mere
transparency measures which do not at all hurt the manner
by which LGUs decide the utilization and allocation of their
funds.
The Court believes that the supervisory powers of
the President (thru the DILG Secretary) are broad enough
to embrace the power to require the publication of certain
documents as a mechanism of transparency.
The petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit.

REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES v.
PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT OF PALAWAN
G.R. No. 170867, December 4, 2018, Tijam, J.
Facts: On December 11, 1990, the Republic of the
Philippines through the Department of Energy, entered into
Service Contract No. 38 with Shell Philippines Exploration B.V.
and Occidental Philippines, Incorporated (collectively SPEX/
OXY), as Contractor, for the exclusive conduct of petroleum
operations in the area known as "Camago-Malampaya" located
offshore northwest of Palawan. Exploration of the area led to
the drilling of the Camago-Malampaya natural gas reservoir
about 80 kilometers from the main island of Palawan and 30
kms from the platform.

Units.
Local government units shall, in addition

gas project was inaugurated.

to the internal revenue allotment, have a share of
forty percent (40%) of the gross collection derived
by the national government from the preceding
fiscal year from mining taxes, royalties, forestry
and fishery charges, and such other taxes, fees, or
charges, including related surcharges, interests, or
fines, and from its share in any co-production, joint
venture or production sharing agreement in the
utilization and development of the national wealth
within their territorial jurisdiction.

Ruling: Under Section 25, Article II of the 1987
Constitution, "(t)he State shall ensure the autonomy of local
governments." In furtherance of this State policy, the 1987
Constitution conferred on LGUs the power to create its own
sources of revenue and the right to share not only in the
national taxes, but also in the proceeds of the utilization of
national wealth in their respective areas as found in Sections
5, 6, and 7 of Article X of the 1987 Constitution.

Decided Case

1.
Unless clearly expanded by Congress, the LGU's
territorial jurisdiction refers only to its land area. Utilization of
natural resources found within the land area as delimited by law
is subject to the 40% LGU share. The court declares that under
existing law, the Province of Palawan is not entitled to share in the
proceeds of the Camago-Malampaya natural gas project located 80
kilometers from the main island of Palawan.

The Local Government Code gave flesh to Section 7,
Article X of the 1987 Constitution under Secs 18, 289, 290 and
291.
The Local Government Code does not define the term
"territorial jurisdiction." Provisions therein, however, indicate
that territorial jurisdiction refers to the LGUs territorial
boundaries.
The intention, therefore, is to consider an LGUs
territorial jurisdiction as pertaining to a physical location or
area as identified by its boundaries. This is also clear from
other provisions of the Local Government Code, particularly
Sections 292 and 294, on the allocation of LGUs' shares from

562

Title Three- Shares of Local Government Units in the
Proceeds of National Taxes

the utilization of national wealth, which speak of the location
of the natural resources:

the following formula whichever will produce a
higher share for the local government unit:

An LGUs territorial jurisdiction refers to its territorial
boundaries or to its territory. The territory of LGUs, in turn,
refers to their land area, unless expanded by law to include
the maritime area. Accordingly, only the utilization of natural
resources found within the land area as delimited by law is
subject to the LGU's equitable share under Sections 290 and 291
of the Local Government Code. This conclusion finds support in
the deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission which
cited, as examples of national wealth the proceeds from which
the LGU may share, which were all found inland.

(a) One percent (1%) of the gross sales or
receipts of the preceding calendar year; or

Accordingly, unless Congress, with the approval of the
political units directly affected, clearly extends an LGU's
territorial boundaries beyond its land area, to include marine
waters, the seabed and the subsoil, it cannot rightfully share in
the proceeds of the utilization of national wealth found therein.
There is no law clearly granting the Province of Palawan
territorial jurisdiction over the Camago-Malampaya reservoir.
As defined in its organic law, the Province of Palawan
is comprised merely of islands. The continental shelf, where
the Camago-Malampaya reservoir is located, was clearly not
included in its territory. Under Palawan's charter, therefore,
the Camago-Malampaya reservoir is not located within its
territorial boundaries.
WHEREFORE, the Petition in is GRANTED. The
Decision of the RTC of the Province of Palawan, is REVERSED
and SET ASIDE. The Court declares that under existing law,
the Province of Palawan is not entitled to share in the proceeds
of the Camago-Malampaya natural gas project.

concerned within five (5) days after the end of each

Although Section 302 of the Local Government Code
does not contain a proviso similar to that of the BOT Law, the
constitutional restrictions on land ownership automatically apply
even though not expressly mentioned in the Local Government
Code.
CHAVEZ v. PUBLIC ESTATES AUTHORITY
G.R. No. 133250, July 9, 2002, Carpio, J.
Facts: On April 27, 1998, petitioner Frank I. Chavez
as a taxpayer, filed the instant petition contending that the
government stands to lose billions of pesos in the sale by PEA
of the reclaimed lands to AMARI. Petitioner assails the sale
to AMAR I of lands of the public domain as a blatant violation
of Section 3, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution prohibiting
the sale of alienable lands of the public domain to private
corporations.
Held: The constitutional prohibition. in Section 3, Article
XII of the 1987 Constitution is absolute and clear: "Private
corporations or associations may not hold such alienable lands
of the public domain except by lease ..." Even Republic Act
No. 6957 (BOT Law), cited by PEA and AMAR I as legislative
authority to sell reclaimed lands to private parties, recognizes
the constitutional ban. Section 6 of R.A. No. 6957 states:
"Sec. 6. Repayment Scheme. - For the financing,
construction, operation and maintenance of any
infrastructure projects undertaken through the buildoperate-and-transfer arrangement or any of its variations
pursuant to the provisions of this Act, the project
proponent... may likewise be repaid in the form of a
share in the revenue of the project or other non-monetary
payments, such as, but not limited to, the grant of a
portion or percentage of the reclaimed land, subject to the
constitutional requirements with respect to the ownership
of the land..."

A private corporation, even one that undertakes the
physical reclamation of a government BOT project, cannot
acquire reclaimed alienable lands of the public domain in view
of the constitutional ban. Section 302 of the Local Government
Code, also mentioned by PEA and AMAR I, authorizes local
governments in land reclamation projects to pay the contractor
or developer in kind consisting of a percentage of the reclaimed
land, to wit:
"Section 302. Financing, Construction, Maintenance,
Operation, and Management of Infrastructure Projects by
the Private Sector...

In case of land reclamation or construction of industrial
estates, the repayment plan may consist of the grant of a
portion or percentage of the reclaimed land or the industrial
estate constructed."
Although Section 302 of the Local Government Code
does not contain a proviso similar to that of the BOT Law, the
constitutional restrictions on land ownership automatically
apply even though not expressly mentioned in the Local
Government Code.
Thus, under either the BOT Law or the Local Government
Code, the contractor or developer, if a corporate entity, can
only be paid with leaseholds on portions of the reclaimed land.
If the contractor or developer is an individual, portions of the
reclaimed land, not exceeding twelve (12) hectares of nonagricultural lands, may be conveyed to him in ownership in
view of the legislative authority allowing such conveyance. This
is the only way these provisions of the BOT Law and the Local
Government Code can avoid a direct collision with Section 3,

A.

Decided Case

1.
The Mayor of Victoria, Negros Occidental's refusal and
continued refusal to pay the travel expense allowance incurred by
petitioner Nessia should not be construed as an act of disapproval
of the claims, since the said claims exceeded the budgetary
appropriations. But the mayor may still be held liable for damages
for malicious inaction because he should have either included the
said claim in the general budget he is bound to submit, or prepared
a special budget for the claim and urged the municipal council to
appropriate the sum necessary therefore.
NESSIA v. FERMIN
220 SCRA 615, March 30, 1993, Bellosillo, J.
Facts: Article 27 of the Civil Code accords judicial relief to
"[a]ny person suffering material or moral loss because a public
servant or employee refuses or neglects, without just cause,
to perform his official duty." This the trial court applied in
finding respondent Jesus M. Fermin, Mayor of Victoria, Negros
Occidental, liable for damages for maliciously refusing to act
on vouchers of petitioner Jose V. Nessia covering the latter's
claim for reimbursement of travel expense allowances as the
Deputy Municipal Assessor of Victorias. The Court of Appeals
however ruled that evidence as well as the complaint itself did
not establish unjust inaction, hence, it reversed the court a quo
and dismissed the case for lack of cause of action.
Held: We do not agree that the allegations in the
compliant alluded to, i.e., "plaintiff presented the said claims to

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Five Loca l Fiscal Administration

585

the defendant Mayor Jesus Fermin, but refused and continued
to refuse the payments thereof and "defendants refused and
continue to refuse to pay," could be construed as admission of
the act of disapproval of the claims. Refusal to pay is not inferred
solely from disapproval of claims but from inaction thereon as
well. Accordingly, the said allegations cannot be considered as
contradictory to Nessia's theory of unjust inaction.
On the defense of lack of appropriation, while it is true
that Fermin may not be compelled by mandamus to approve
vouchers because they exceeded the budgetary appropriations,
he may, nevertheless, be held liable for damages under Art. 27
for malicious inaction because he did not act on the vouchers.
This provision against official inaction finds its ally in Sec.
3 par. (D), of R.A. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as the
"Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act," which criminalizes
"[n]eglecting or refusing, after due demand or request,
without sufficient justification, to act within a reasonable time
on any matter pending before him for the purpose of x x x
discriminating against any interested party."
Indeed, respondent could have, and should have, either
included the claim of petitioners herein in the general budget
he is bound to submit, pursuant to Section 2295 of the Revised
Administrative Code, or prepared a special budget for said
claim, and urged the municipal council to appropriate the sum
necessary therefor. In any event if the municipal mayor fails
or refuses to make the necessary appropriation, petitioners
may bring an action against the municipality for the recovery
of what is due them and after securing a judgment therefor,
seek a writ of mandamus against the municipal council and
the municipal mayor to compel the enactment and approval of
the appropriate ordinance necessary therefor. (19 R.C.L. 1951-1952; 34 Am. Jur.,950-951; 35 Am. Jur., 21.)"
The decision of the trial court is REINSTATED and
AFFIRMED.
SEC. 319. Legislative Authorization of the
On or before the end of the current
fiscal year, the sanggunian concerned shall enact,
through an ordinance, the annual budget of the local
government unit for the ensuing fiscal year on the
basis of the estimates of income and expenditures
submitted by the local chief executive.

SEC. 320. Effectivity of Budgets. - The
ordinance enacting the annual budget shall take
effect at the beginning of the ensuing calendar year.
An ordinance enacting a supplemental budget,
however, shall take effect upon its approval or on
the date fixed therein. The responsibility for the
execution of the annual and supplemental budgets
and the accountability therefor shall be vested
primarily in the local chief executive concerned.

outlays shall continue and remain valid until
fully spent, reverted or the project is completed.
Reversions of continuing appropriations shall not
be allowed unless obligations therefor have been
fully paid or otherwise settled.

SEC. 321. Changes in the Annual Budget.
All budgetary proposals shall be included and
considered in the budget preparation process.
After the local chief executive concerned shall have
submitted the executive budget to the sanggunian,
no ordinance providing for a supplemental budget
shall be enacted, except when supported by funds
actually available as certified by the local treasurer
or by new revenue sources.
A supplemental budget may also be enacted
in times of public calamity by way of budgetary
realignment to set aside appropriations for the
purchase of supplies and materials or the payment
of services which are exceptionally urgent or
absolutely indispensable to prevent imminent
danger to, or loss of, life or property, in the
jurisdiction of the local government unit in or in
other areas declared in a state of calamity by the
President. Such ordinance shall clearly indicate
the sources of funds available for appropriations,
as certified under oath by the local treasurer and
local accountant and attested by the local chief
executive, and the various items of appropriations
affected and the reasons for the change.
SEC. 322. Reversion of Unexpended Balances
of Appropriations, Continuing Appropriations.
Unexpended balances of appropriations authorized
in the annual appropriations ordinance shall revert
to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund
at the end of the fiscal year and shall not thereafter
be available for expenditure except by subsequent
enactment. However, appropriations for capital

The balances of continuing appropriations
shall be reviewed as part of the annual budget
preparation and the sanggunian concerned may
approve, upon recomm endation of the local chief
executive, the reversion of funds no longer needed
in connection with the activities funded by said
continuing appropriations subject to the provisions
of this Section.
SEC. 323. Failure to Enact the Annual
Appropriations.
In case the sanggunian
concerned fails to pass the ordinance authorizing
the annual appropriations at the beginning of
the ensuing fiscal year, it shall continue to hold
sessions, without additional remuneration for
its members, until such ordinance is approved,
and no other business may be taken up during
such sessions. If the sanggunian still fails to
enact such ordinance after ninety (90) days from
the beginning of the fiscal year, the ordinance
authorizing the appropriations of the preceding
year shall be deemed reenacted and shall remain
in force and effect until the ordinance authorizing
the proposed appropriations is passed by the
sanggunian concerned. However, only the annual
appropriations for salaries and wages of existing
positions, statutory and contractual obligations,
and essential operating expenses authorized in the
annual and supplemental budgets for the preceding
year shall be deemed reenacted and disbursement
of funds shall be in accordance therewith.
In the implementation of such reenacted
ordinance, the local treasurer concerned shall exclude
from the estimates of income for the preceding fiscal
year those realized from nonrecurring sources, like
national aids, proceeds from loans, sale of assets,
prior year adjustments, and other analogous

587

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

sources of income. No ordinance authorizing
supplemental appropriations shall be passed in
place of the annual appropriations.
In case the revised income estimates be less
than the aggregate reenacted appropriations, the
local treasurer concerned shall accordingly advise
the sanggunian concerned which shall, within ten
(10) days from the receipt of such advice, make the
necessary adjustments or reductions. The revised
appropriations authorized by the sanggunian
concerned shall then be the basis for disbursements.
A.

Decided Case

1.
The mere failure of the local government to enact a
budget did not make all its disbursements illegal. Section 323 of the
LGC provides for the automatic reenactment of the budget of the
preceding year, in case the Sanggunian fails to enact one within the
first 90 days of the fiscal year. Hence, the contention in the present
case that money was paid out of the local treasury without any valid
appropriation must necessarily fail.
VILLANUEVA v. OPLE
475 SCRA 539, November 18, 2005, Panganiban, J.
Facts: On December 8, 2003, Petitioners Cesar T.
Villanueva, et. al. filed a Joint Affidavit-Complaint before
the Office of the Ombudsman. They charged incumbent
Mayor Felix V. Opie and Vice-Mayor Josefina R. Contreras of
Hagonoy, Bulacan, of violation of Section 3(e) of RA No. 3019
or the "Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act," in relation to
Sections 305-(a), 318 and 351 of the Local Government Code
LGC).
Petitioners alleged that the annual budget for Fiscal
Year (FY) 2003 of the Municipality of Hagonoy had been
submitted by Mayor Ople-through Vice-Mayor Contreras
to the Sangguniang Bayan of Hagonoy, only on June 11, 2003,
instead of on October 16 of the preceding year, as mandated
by Section 318, paragraph 2 of Book II, Title V, Chapter III of
the LGC. They added that Vice-Mayor Contreras had failed to
refer the budget to the chief legal counsel of the municipality;
and that, together with the other incumbent members of the

Book II- Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Ttle Five Local Fiscal Administration

689

Sangguniang Bayan, she had instead sought the approval of
the alleged "Illegal Annual Budget for 2003."
On the theory that no enabling resolution had been
enacted authorizing expenditures of the municipality to be
based on the annual budget for the preceding year, petitioners
claimed that the disbursement of public funds during the
period January 1, 2003 to July 11, 2003 and/or August 27, 2003
had been illegal. They therefore prayed that respondents be
held liable for the illegal disbursements done in the discharge
of official functions, through evident bad faith and/or gross
negligence that had caused undue injury to the Municipality
of Hagonoy, Bulacan.
Ruling: The Court finds no grave abuse in the manner
in which the deputy ombudsman exercised his discretion.
Evidently, he had sufficient bases for his finding that there was
no probable cause.

First, the mere failure of the local government to enact
a budget did not make all its disbursements illegal. Section
323 of the LGC provides for the automatic reenactment of the
budget of the preceding year, in case the Sanggunian fails to
enact one within the first 90 days of the fiscal year. Hence,
the contention in the present case that money was paid out
of the local treasury without any valid appropriation must
necessarily fail.
Second, Section 323 states that only the annual
appropriations for salaries and wages, statutory and
contractual obligations, and essential operating expenses are
deemed reenacted. Petitioner failed to identify disbursements
that had gone beyond this coverage.
Third, petitioners failed to substantiate their allegations
that the government had suffered undue injury. They concluded
that there had been undue injury simply on the basis of their
unsubstantiated claims of illegal disbursements. Having failed
to prove any unlawful expenditure, the claim of undue injury
must necessarily fail.

Fourth, petitioners relied solely on Section 318 of the
LGC, which allegedly exposed the mayor to criminal liability
for delay in submitting a budget proposal.
Under Sec. 318, LGC criminal liability for delay in
submitting the budget is qualified by various circumstances.

690

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

For instance, the mayor must first receive the necessary
financial documents from other city officials in order to be
able to prepare the budget. In addition, criminal liability must
conform to the provisions of the LGC and other applicable
laws. Noteworthy is the fact that petitioners failed to present
evidence that would fulfill these qualifications stated in the
law.
Under the present factual milieu, petitioners clearly
failed to establish the elements of a violation of Section 3(e) of
the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act:
The Petition is hereby DENIED, and the assailed
Resolution and Order are AFFIRMED.
SEC. 324. Budgetary Requirements.
The
budgets of local government units for any fiscal
year shall comply with the following requirements:
(a) The aggregate amount appropriated shall
not exceed the estimates of income;
(b) Full provision shall be made for all
statutory and contractual obligations of the local
government unit concerned: Provided, however,
That the amount of appropriations for debt
servicing shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of
the regular income of the local government unit
concerned;
(c) In the case of provinces, cities, and
municipalities, aid to component barangays shall
be provided in amounts of not less than One
thousand pesos (P1,000.00) per barangay; and
(d) Five percent (5%) of the estimated
revenue from regular sources shall be set
aside as an annual lump sum appropriation
for unforeseen expenditures arising from the
occurrence of calamities; Provided, however, That
such appropriation shall be used only in the areas
declared in a state of calamity by the President.

Section 335 of R.A. 7160. Ownership of the sidewalks in a private
subdivision belongs to the subdivision owner/developer until it is
either transferred to the government by way of donation or acquired
by the government through expropriation.
ALBON v. FERNANDO
494 SCRA 141, June 30, 2006, Corona, J.
Facts: In May 1999, the City of Marikina undertook a
public works project to widen, clear and repair the existing
sidewalks of Marikina Greenheights Subdivision. It was

698

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Title Five Local Fiscal Administration

undertaken by the city government pursuant to Ordinance No.
59, s. 1993.

7160 which mandates LGUs to efficiently and effectively
provide basic services and facilities. The law speaks of
infrastructure facilities intended primarily to service the
needs of the residents of the LG U and "which are funded out
of municipal funds." It particularly refers to "municipal roads
and bridges" and "similar facilities."

On June 14, 1999, petitioner Aniano A. Albon filed
with the RTC of Marikina, Branch 73, a taxpayer's suit for
certiorari, prohibition and injunction with damages against
respondents City Mayor Bayani F. Fernando, City Engineer
Alfonso Espirito, Assistant City Engineer Anaki Madera! and
City Treasurer Natividad Cabalquinto.

Applying the rules of ejusdem generis, the phrase "similar
facilities" refers to or includes infrastructure facilities like
sidewalks owned by the LGU. Thus, RA 7160 contemplates that
only the construction, improvement, repair and maintenance of
infrastructure facilities owned by the LGU may be bankrolled
with local government funds.

Ruling: The ruling in the 1991 White Plains Association
decision relied on by both the trial and appellate courts was
modified by this Court in 1998 in White Plains Association v.
Court ofAppeals, 297 SCRA 547 (1998). Citing Young v. City of
Manila, 73 Phil. 537 (1991) this Court held in its 1998 decision
that subdivision streets belonged to the owner until donated
to the government or until expropriated upon payment of just
compensation.

This case is hereby ordered REMAND ED to the RTC of
Marikina City for the reception of evidence to determine (1)
whether V.V. Soliven, Inc. has retained ownership of the open
spaces and sidewalks of Marikina Greenheights Subdivision
or has donated them to the City of Marik ina and (2) whether
the public has full and unimpeded access to, and use of, the
roads and sidewalks of the subdivision. The Marikina City
RTC directed to decide the case with dispatch.

Moreover, under subdivision laws, lots allotted by
subdivision developers as road lots include roads, sidewalks,
alleys and planting strips. Thus, what is true for subdivision
roads or streets applies to subdivision sidewalks as well.
Ownership of the sidewalks in a private subdivision belongs to
the subdivision owner/developer until it is either transferred
to the government by way of donation or acquired by the
government through expropriation.

SEC. 336. Use of Appropriated Funds and
Savings.
Funds shall be available exclusively
for the specific purpose for which they have
been appropriated. No ordinance shall be passed
authorizing any transfer of appropriations from
one item to another. However, the local chief
executive or the presiding officer of the sanggunian
concerned may, by ordinance, be authorized to
augment any item in the approved annual budget
for their respective offices from savings in other
items within the same expense class of their
respective appropriations.

Section 335 of RA 7160 is clear and specific that no public
money or property shall be appropriated or applied for private
purposes. This is in consonance with the fundamental principle
in local fiscal administration that local government funds and
monies shall be spent solely for public purposes.
In Young v. City of Manila, the City of Manila undertook
the filling of low-lying streets of the Antipolo Subdivision, a
privately-owned subdivision. The Court ruled that as long
as the private owner retained title and ownership of the
subdivision, he was under the obligation to reimburse to the
city government the expenses incurred in land-filling the
streets.
Therefore, the use of LGU funds for the widening and
improvement of privately-owned sidewalks is unlawful as it
directly contravenes Section 336 of RA 7160. This conclusion
finds further support from the language of Section 17 of RA

699

Decided Cases

1.
There was no valid augmentation made in CY 2001 that
could have covered the cost of the second MOA. In contrast to the CYs
2001 and 2003 appropriation ordinances, which expressly authorized
the governor to realign, revise, modify, or change items in the
annual budget, Section 26 of the CY 2002 appropriation ordinance

600

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

is couched in a markedly different language. The SP effectively
withheld from Verceles the authority to make augmentations by
requiring its approval for all realignments of funds.

VERCELES, JR. v. COMMISSION ON AUDIT
802 SCRA 504, September 13, 2016, Brion, J.
Facts: (See supra)
Ruling: Under Section 336, the general rule is that funds
shall be available exclusively for the specific purpose for which
they have been appropriated. The exception is when the local
chief executive is authorized by ordinance to augment any item
in the approved annual budget from savings in other items
within the same expense class.
Article 454 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing
the LGC states that augmentation implies the existence in
the budget of an item, project, activity, or purpose with an
appropriation which upon implementation or subsequent
evaluation of needed resources is determined to be deficient.
The question is whether the grant of authority to the local
chief executive to augment items in the annual budget can be
belatedly granted.
Second MOA (2001 EDF)
There was no valid augmentation made in CY 2001 that
could have covered the cost of the second MOA.

items in the annual budget of the LGU. Applying Araullo,
the appropriation ordinance of a given fiscal year must
expressly authorize the local chief executive before he can
make augmentations in that particular year, or at the very
least, he must be authorized by ordinance before he can make
augmentations.
Verceles posits that the authority to augment items in
the approved annual budget may be given retroactively, that
is, after the augmentations have been made. He cites Section 8
of the CY 2003 appropriation ordinance of the province, which
states,
Section 8. Authority to Augment Items and Figures
in the Budget and Ratification of Previous Acts of the
Provincial Governor. - The Provincial Governor is
hereby authorized to effect and is hereby considered
to have been authorized, and the Sangguniang
Panlalawigan hereby approves and ratifies all
augmentations of items and figures in the CY 2003
Budgetthatincludesthe20%EconomicDevelopment
Fund (EDF) for CY 2003, and previous budgets and
20% [EDFs], and all modifications, revisions, thereof
that may be considered as augmentations, all which
may be or have been warranted due to, but not limited
to, actual or possible shortfall in the revenue collections
of the province and the IRA due it xxx. [emphasis and
underscoring supplied)

As discussed above, the CY 2001 appropriation ordinance
did not identify the specific projects or items to be funded by the
EDF. How could Verceles transfer savings from nonexistent
items (in the EDF) to augment the tree seedlings propagation
project? The project that was supposed to be augmented was
also not identified in the CY 2001 appropriation ordinance.

We affirm the COA's disallowance of the fourth and fifth
MOAs on the following grounds:

The augmentation was legally impossible as there were
no items from which savings could have been generated from
and there was no item to which such savings could have been
transferred. The second MOA was thus correctly disallowed.

Exceptions are strictly construed and apply only
so far as their language fairly warrants, with all doubts
being resolved in favor of the general proviso rather
than the exception. As an exception to the general rule,
all the requirements for a valid augmentation must be
strictly complied with. One such requirement is that the
local chief executive must be authorized by an ordinance.
Consistent with the strict construction approach, we rule that

Fourth and Fifth MOAs (2002 EDF)
Section 336 of the LGC requires an implementing
ordinance so that the local chief executive can augment

First, the power of the local chief executive to augment
items under Section 336 of the LGC is a mere exception to the
general rale that funds shall be available exclusively for the
specific purpose for which they have been appropriated.

602

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the requisite "authorized by ordinance" does not necessarily
and automatically include "ratified by ordinance."
The exception clause of Section 336 states: "the local
chief executive ... may, by ordinance, be authorized to augment
any item in the approved annual budget .... The key phrase is
"by ordinance, be authorized to augment." We must therefore
interpret this phrase in a manner that does not easily erode
the basic principle that funds shall be available exclusively for
the specific purpose for which they have been appropriated.
To "authorize" means "to empower; to give a right or
authority to act." It means "to endow with authority or effective
legal power, warrant or right; to permit a thing to be done in
the future."
Thus, strictly speaking, the governor must be duly
authorized before he can make augmentations. We highlight the
words "to augment" suggesting that what is being authorized is
an act that has yet to happen.
Nevertheless, our ruling in the present case should not
be taken to mean that the LGC prohibits the ratification of
previously unauthorized augmentations. We only want to
underscore the necessity of an existing authority before the
local chief executive can make augmentations. The Court
recognizes that there may be narrow instances where past
augmentations can be shown to have fully complied with all the
requisites (except for the authority by ordinance requisite) for
a valid augmentation, in which cases, ratification is allowed.
Such is not the case here as will be explained next.
Second, the all-encompassing nature of the blanket
ratification by the SP of all the augmentations made in the
past budgets rendered such ratification ineffective.
We note the very broad wording of Section 8 of CY 2003
appropriation ordinance. Without qualification, it approved all
past augmentations regardless of whether such augmentations
could have been legally permissible. By the expedient passing
of the CY 2003 appropriation ordinance, the SP presumed that
all requisites for augmentation were complied with, effectively
bypassing the said requisites. This cannot be allowed as there
are strict requirements before augmentations can be made; the
existence of actual savings is just one example.

Book II -- Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Five Local Fiscal Administration

603

To cite a case in point, the 2001 augmentation of the EDF
that purportedly funded the second MOA could not have been
validly ratified by the SP because there were no identified
items under the 2001 EDF from which savings could have been
generated; there were also no items to which such savings
could have been realigned.
Third, Section 26 of the CY 2002 appropriation ordinance
of the province provides that "[a]ll realignments of fund shall
be approved by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan."
In contrast to the CYs 2001 and 2003 appropriation
ordinances, which expressly authorized the governor to
realign, revise, modify, or change items in the annual budget,
Section 26 of the CY 2002 appropriation ordinance which
states that "all realignments of fund shall be approved by
the Sangguniang Panlalawigan" is couched in a markedly
different language. The SP effectively withheld from Verceles
the authority to make augmentations by requiring its approval
for all realignments of funds.
Section 103 of the Government Auditing Code declares
that expenditures of government funds or uses of government
property in violation of law or regulations shall be a personal
liability of the official or employee found to be directly
responsible therefor.
The public official's personal liability arises only if the
expenditure of government funds was made in violation of
law. In this case, Verceles' acts of: (1) making augmentations
without prior authority and (2) entering into a contract on
behalf of the province without requisite authority were in
violation of the LGC.
In summary, and except for the incorrectly disallowed
third MOA, we find that the COA's assailed decision was
made in faithful compliance with its mandate and in judicious
exercise of its general audit power as conferred on it by the
Constitution.
WHEREFORE, we PARTLY GRANT the petition and
accordingly MODIFY the decision and resolution of the COA,
such that the Notices of Disallowance which covered the third
MOA, dated May 6, 2002, between the Province of Catanduanes
and the Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office,
are ANNULLED.

SEC. 337. Restriction Upon Limit ofDisbursement.

FERNANDEZ v. COMMISSION ON AUDIT
G.R. No. 205389, November 19, 2019, Inting, d.

- Disbursement in accordance with appropriations
in the approved annual budget may be made from
any local fund in the custody of the treasurer,
but the total disbursements from any local fund
shall in no case exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
uncollected estimated revenue accruing to such
local fund in addition to the actual collections:
Provided, however, That no cash overdraft in any
local fund shall be incurred at the end of the fiscal
year.

Facts: (See infra)
Ruling: The COA also observed the lack of an
appropriation ordinance for the realignment of funds. This
contravenes RA 7160 or the "Local Government Code (LGC)
of 1991," which entails the passage of an ordinance in order
for a local government to realign its budget. The pertinent
provisions are Sections 336 and 346 thereof.
As stated in Section 336 of the LGC, the general rule is
that funds shall be available exclusively for the specific purpose
for which they have been appropriated. The exception to this
is when the local chief executive is authorized by ordinance to
augment any item in the approved annual budget from savings
in other items within the same expense class.

In case of emergency arising from a typhoon,
earthquake, or any other calamity, the sanggunian
concerned may authorize the local treasurer to
continue making disbursements from any local
fund in his possession in excess of the limitations
herein provided, but only for such purposes and
amounts included in the approved annual budgets.

In this case, 3"' SP Resolution No. 2009-105 and 1st
Resolution No 2001-45, which purportedly granted petitioner
and Gullas the authority to represent the City of Talisay in all
contracts and memoranda of agreement made pursuant to a law
or ordinance, do not have the force of the required ordinance
that must expressly authorize the local chief executive to make
augmentations or realignments in the city budget. Likewise, SP
Resolution No. 2006-79, purportedly ratifying the realignment
of funds to finance the computerization project through the
aforesaid EOs issued by petitioner and Gullas, has no curative
effect.
It must also be emphasized that the power of the local
chief executive to augment items under Section 336 of the
LGC is a mere exception to the general rule that funds shall
be available exclusively for the specific purpose for which they
have been appropriated. "Exceptions are strictly construed and

the total purchase price caused gross and manifest disadvantage to
the Province of Quirino.
CASTILLO-CO v. SANDIGANBAYAN
G.R. No. 184766, August 15, 2018, A. Reyes, Jr., J.

Facts: On June 27, 1997, Junie E. Cua, Representative
of the Province of Quirino and the Chairman of the Committee
on Good Government of the House of Representatives, filed
a letter-complaint before the Office of the Ombudsman
against the petitioner, Gov. Co, and the Provincial Engineer
of the Province of Quirino, Virgilio Ringor (Engr. Ringor), for
violations of Section 3(e) and (g) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt
Practices Act, Frauds Against the Public Treasury, and
Malversation of Public Funds.
Rep. Cua alleged that irregularities attended the purchase
of heavy equipment by the Provincial Government of Quirino
from Nakajima Trading Co., Ltd. (Nakajima Trading)
According to Rep. Cua, prior to contracting with Nakajima
Trading and in order to fund the purchase, Gov. Co entered into
a loan agreement with the Philippine National Bank (PNB)
by virtue of a resolution of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan of
Quirino. The resolution authorized Gov. Co to obtain a loan to
fund the purchase of brand new heavy equipment.
However, on January 11, 1996, Gov. Co entered into an
agreement to purchase reconditioned heavy equipment instead,
with the Province of Quirino as the buyer and Nakajima
Trading as the seller.
The letter-complaint also alleged that Gov. Co agreed to
advance 40% of the total purchase price before the delivery of
the machinery would be effected, in violation of the prohibition
on advance payments found in Section 338 of the Local
Government Code of 1991.

Ruling: The inclination of the Province of Quirino, as
shown by Resolution No. 120 and Resolution No. 06-A, was
evidently to procure brand new heavy machinery. To its
prejudice, however, Gov. Co caused the expenditure of public
funds allotted for that purpose on reconditioned equipment
instead. Worse, she did so knowingly.

,
I

i

607

By purchasing reconditioned instead of brand new heavy
equipment in contravention of the terms of her authority,
Gov. Co entered into a contract grossly and manifestly
disadvantageous to the Province of Quirino. Such disadvantage
was brought about because the province had set aside public
funds for brand new heavy machinery only to receive used
albeit reconditioned equipment.
The evidence of the prosecution showed that the
telegraphic transfer of 40% of the total contract price was
effected on January 24, 1996, while the heavy equipment
was initially delivered on April 10, 1996. Thus, the Provincial
Government of Quirino paid public funds to Nakajima Trading
before the latter delivered to it the heavy machinery subject of
the contract.
Gov. Co effected the payment of P15,881,115.50, or 40%
percent of the total contract price, before delivery by Nakajima
Trading. The prosecution maintained that the advance
payment was a clear and unequivocal breach of Section 338 of
the Local Government Code. The Sandiganbayan, for its part,
held that this constituted gross and manifest disadvantage to
the government.
The purpose of the prohibition against advance payments
is to ensure the receipt of goods or the performance of services.
Section 338 of the Local Government Code seeks to prevent
situations where private suppliers can easily abscond with
public funds.
When a local government unit makes an advance
payment, it risks pecuniary loss in the event of non-delivery or
non performance by the party with which it contracts.
The Court finds that, here, the mere risk of losing such
a substantial amount of money (i.e., P15,881,115.50) caused
gross and manifest disadvantage to the Province of Quirino.
The findings of the Sandiganbayan show that Nakajima
Trading failed to comply with a stipulation in the agreement,
which provided that the complete delivery of the heavy
equipment had to be within ninety (90) days from the date
payment was received. The record reveals that, through a
letter of credit, full payment had been effected on February
14, 1996. Thus, the Japanese supplier had until May 14, 1996
to perform its obligation under the contract. However, it failed

608

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

to do so. Nakajima Trading delivered the equipment in three
(3) separate shipments. According to the Sandiganbayan, these
shipments were made on April 10, 1996, June 10, 1996, and
June 24, 1996. Clearly, therefore, complete delivery was not
made in accordance with the terms of the contract.
The petition is DENIED. The Sandiganbayan Decision
and Resolution, are AFFIRMED. The petitioner, Josie CastilloCo, is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of Six (6)
years and One (1) month, as minimum, to Six (6) years and
Nine (9) months, as maximum, with perpetual disqualification
from public office.

Decided Cases

1.
Since payment should not be made to a contractor without
the prior inspection of the project by the Inspectorate Team, the
members thereof who sign the certificate of inspection participate
in the use and application of local government funds (in this case,
the Special Education Fund of the Province of Oriental Mindoro).
Thus, if there is an irregularity in the performance of this duty, they
may be held liable for any loss that is incurred by the government
as a consequence thereof. In this case, there was such irregularity
when petitioner and other members of the Team attested to the
100% completion of the projects notwithstanding their undisputed
deficiencies.

LEYCANO v. COMMISSION ON AUDIT
482 SCRA 360, February 10, 2006, Carpio-Morales, J.

t

I
I

II

l

Facts: Petitioner Manuel Leycano, Jr. was the Provincial
Treasurer of Oriental Mindoro and a member of the Provincial
School Board (PSB) of that province. During his tenure, he was
appointed by the PSB as a member of its Inspectorate Team.
In the year 1995, several checks were issued to various
private contractors in connection with the repair, rehabilitation,
and construction projects covered by the Special Education
Fund (SEF) of Oriental Mindoro in 25 public schools.
The Special Audit Team found deficiencies in the projects,
hence, it issued the questioned Notices of Disallowance holding
petitioner, along with Sangguniang Panlalawigan Member
Remedios Marasigan and Schools Division Superintendent
Benjamin Cruz, liable for signing the Certificates of Inspection
relative to the projects and thereby falsely attesting to their
100% completion.
Ruling: Petitioner admits having signed the Certificate
of Inspection in which he attested that the projects were 100%
completed. Significantly, he does not dispute the finding of
the COA that the subject projects were not completed. He
alleges, however, that the COA overlooked the fact that the
PSB merely intended the Inspectorate Team, of which he was
a member, to perform monitoring functions, leaving the strict
implementation and supervision of the projects in the hands of
the Provincial Engineering Office. He thus concludes that he
is not the accountable officer and instead points to the Project
Engineer and Provincial Engineer, who are in charge of the
supervision and control of PSB Projects.
The flow chart clearly shows that, after the PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION stage, the project must be inspected by
the PROJECT INSPECTORATE TEAM before there can be
ACCEPTANCEtrURNOVER and thereafter, PAYMENT. It
can be deduced from the flow chart that prior examination of
the project by the Inspectorate Team is necessary before there
can be acceptance or turnover of PSB projects and payment to
the contractors concerned.
In light of this function of the Inspectorate Team, its
members may be held liable by the COA for any irregular

610

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

expenditure of the SEF if their participation in such
irregularity can be established. While petitioner, in his capacity
as member of the Inspectorate Team, is not an accountable
officer as contemplated in Section 101 of P.D. No. 1445, he
may, nonetheless, be held liable by the COA under the broad
jurisdiction vested on it by the Constitution "to examine, audit,
and settle all accounts pertaining to the revenue and receipts
of, and expenditures or uses of funds and property, owned or
held in trust by, or pertaining to, the Government."
Furthermore, Section 340 of the Local Government Code
(LGC) clearly provides:
SECTION 340. Persons Accountable for Local
Government Funds. An y officer of the local government
unit whose duty permits or requires the possession or
custody of local government funds shall be accountable
and responsible for the safekeeping thereof in conformity
with the provisions of this Title. Other local officers who,
though not accountable by the nature of their duties, may
likewise be similarly held accountable and responsible for
local government funds through their participation in the
use or application thereof.
Since, as earlier noted, payment should not be made
to a contractor without the prior inspection of the project by
the Inspectorate Team, the members thereof who sign the
certificate of inspection participate in the use and application
of local government funds (in this case, the Special Education
Fund of the Province of Oriental Mindoro). Thus, if there is
an irregularity in the performance of this duty, they may be
held liable for any loss that is incurred by the government as a
consequence thereof. In this case, there was such irregularity
when petitioner and other members of the Team attested to
the 100% completion of the projects notwithstanding their
undisputed deficiencies.
The petition is DISMISSED.
2.
Under Section 340, LGC Gov. Padaca is accountable for
public funds through her individual participation in the use and
application thereof. The Ombudsman held that Padaca's giving
preference to EDWINLFl in the release of P25 Million without
stipulations in the MOA as to the amount of the contract, the cost

estimates, and terms of reference, etc. is as good as permitting,
through abandonment or negligence, the latter to take such funds.
PADACA v. MORALES
G.R. No. 201800, August 8, 2018, Reyes, Jr., J.
Facts: In his Complaint dated February 26, 2007,
Santiago Respicio alleged that in January 2006, the Provincial
Government of Isabela obtained a loan from the DBP, in the
amount of P35 Million for the purpose of funding the Priority
Agricultural Modernization Project of the province of Isabela.
From the said amount, P25 Million was released to Economic
Development for Western Isabela and Northern Luzon
Foundation, Inc., (EDWINLFI), a private foundation headed
by Municipal Councilor Servando Soriano as Chairman,
Dionisio Pine as Manager, and Provincial Government Legal
Officer, Atty. Johnas Lamorena as Director. The full amount
of the loan, along with the interests and documentary stamp
taxes, was paid using the Economic Development Fund of the
province.
Respicio further stated that, to replenish the amount
taken from the Economic Development Fund, Padaca
caused the release of the same amount from the unreleased
approved loans of the provincial government from the previous
administration. Hence, the complaint against Provincial
Administrator Ma. Theresa Flores, then Provincial Treasurer
William Nicolas, Atty. Lamorena, Gov. Padaca, Soriano, and
Pine for violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019, Illegal Use of
Funds, and Malversation of Public Funds.
Ruling: Based on its investigation, the Ombudsman
found that Padaca engaged the services of EDWINLFI to
manage Isabela's provincial rice program without due regard
to the rules on government procurement and notwithstanding
that the MOA was yet to be ratified by the SP. The Ombudsman
also noted that the fact that EDWINLFI's officers include
Soriano (Municipal Councilor) and Atty. Lamorena (Provincial
Government's Legal Officer), engenders a suspicion as to the
regularity of the transaction. Thus, the Ombudsman concluded
that there is probable cause to believe that through manifest
partiality, Padaca gave unwarranted preference and benefits
to EDWINLFI in the discharge of her official function as
governor of the Province of Isabela, which is penalized under

612

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. Concomitantly, Soriano and
Pine were charged based on their collaborative actions in
the implementation of the Provincial Rice Program, which
according to the Ombudsman, indicate the ex.istence of common
design to obtain unwarranted benefits at the expense of the
Provincial Government.
The Ombudsman also found probable cause to charge the
petitioners for Malversation of Public Funds. It discussed that
based on Section 340 of the Local Government Code, Padaca is
accountable for public funds through her individual participation
in the use and application thereof. The Ombudsman held that
Padaca's giving preference to EDWINLFI in the release of P25
Million without stipulations in the MOA as to the amount of
the contract, the cost estimates, and terms of reference with
respect to the scope of services for the implementation of the
provincial rice program, including terms of repayment of the
funds in favor of the provincial government and accountability
of EDWINLFI for such funds, is as good as permitting, through
abandonment or negligence, the latter to take such funds.
Again, the charge against Soriano and Pine was due to their
personal and deliberate participation in the transaction.
With the foregoing, the Court concurs with the
Sandiganbayan that no grave abuse of discretion amounting
to lack or excess in jurisdiction can be attributed to the
Ombudsman, as the latter's finding of probable cause rests on
substantial basis.
The consolidated petitions are hereby DISMISSED for
lack of merit. The Resolutions of the Office of the Ombudsman

BAYA v. SANDIGANBAYAN
G.R. Nos. 204978-83, July 6, 2020, Leonen, J.
Facts: Ignacio Baya was a Board Member of the
Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Zamboanga Sibugay. In 2001,
the provincial government implemented the "Aid to the Poor"
program to grant financial assistance to its poor constituents.
Funds for the Program came from the savings in Personnel
Services (PS) and Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses
(MOOE) of the province's regular budget.
In an audit report submitted on February 19, 2004, COA
confirmed that there were anomalies in the implementation
of the "Aid to the Poor" program. The scheme essentially
consisted of the Governor, Vice-Governor, and Zamboanga
Sibugay's Board Members allegedly giving financial assistance
from their own pockets, then seeking reimbursement of the
amounts: from the realigned funds. Reimbursement forms
were submitted thereafter, and the disbursement vouchers
were approved either by the Governor or by the Vice-Governor.
In reality, however, the beneficiaries were non existent (sic),
and the officials used the realigned funds for their own benefit.
Specifically with respect to Board Member Baya, he
was found to have requested for the reimbursement of a
total of P60,000.00. The amount was allegedly given to 18
named beneficiaries, 14 of whom were found to be fictitious.
The 14 were not listed as residents of the area incticated in
the application forms, and the Municipal Local Government
Operations Officers deployed to the supposed residences of the
beneficiaries did not find them there.
Ruling: This Court finds that the Sandiganbayan did not
gravely abuse its discretion in denying petitioner's Motion for
Judicial Determination of Probable Cause.
We reject petitioner's argument that he cannot be charged
with malversation because he was not an accountable officer
who had custody of the funds appropriated by him. Section 340
of the Local Government Code provides for persons accountable
for local government funds.
It is clear that not only those with actual possession
of custody of the local government funds are considered
accountable persons. Local government officials become

accountable public officers either: (1) because of the nature of
their functions; or (2) on account of their participation in the
use or application of public funds.
Despite not having actual custody of the municipality's
funds, petitioner participated in their use or application
by directing how the funds should actually be applied. In
petitioner's case, his certification that the supposed beneficiaries
were indigent and in need of financial assistance led to the use
of the funds for the "Aid to the Poor" program.
Petitioner cannot pass blame to the Provincial Social
Work and Development Office, the office that allegedly had
actual custody of the funds and approved of his reimbursement
requests. Were it not for his certification in the Disbursement
Vouchers and Reimbursement Expense Receipts, the Provincial
Social Work and Development Office would not have approved
the application for reimbursement.
All told, there is no grave abuse of discretion in the finding
of probable cause against petitioner, both for malversation of
public funds and violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No.
3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.
The petition for Certiorari is DISMISSED.

Decided Case

Public officials who are directly responsible for, or
participated in making the illegal expenditures, as well as those
who actually received the amounts therefrom-in this case, the

SILAN G v. COMMISSION ON AUDIT
770 SCRA 110, September 8, 2015, Perlas-Bernabe, J.
Facts: On November 13, 2007 and February 4, 2008, the
LGU of Tayabas, Quezon entered into Collective Negotiation
Agreements (CNAs) with the Unyon ng mga Kawani ng
Pamahalaang Lokal ng Tayabas (UNGKAT), an employees'
organization of the LGU of Tayabas, Quezon duly registered
with the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE)
and the Civil Service Commission (CSC), per Certificate of
Registration No. 827 dated June 14, 2001, which conferred
upon it "the right to be certified" as the sole representative of
the LGU ofTayabas, Quezon's rank-and-file employees.
Thereafter, oron February 11, 2008, the local Sanggunian,
whose members include herein petitioners Venerando R.
Rea, Luzviminda B. Cuadra, Maria Cielito V. Zeta, Estelito
M. Querubin, and Lyka Monika J. Oabel, (local Sanggunian
members) passed City Ordinance No. 08-03 appropriating
the amount of P9,230,434.49 for the payment of the 2008 CNA
Incentive to the rank-and-file employees of Tayabas, Quezon
to be sourced from the LGU's Maintenance and Other Operating
Expenses (MOOE) savings for 2007. However, for failure to

616

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

submit the required documents, the Office of the Auditor of
COA, Province of Quezon (Office of the Auditor) issued Notice
of Suspension (NS) No. 2008-001-101(08) dated December
17, 2008, anchored on the non-registration of the CNA with the
CSC and the absence of cost-cutting measures herein.
Disputing the suspension, petitioner Faustino A. Silang
(Silang), City Mayor of Tayabas, Quezon, through a letter
dated February 9, 2009, submitted the letter dated January 28,
2009 of then UNGKAT President petitioner Enrico T. Nanez
(Nanez). In the letter, Nanez argued that the non-registration
of the CNA with the CSC was not a bar to the payment of the
2008 CNA Incentive and that the cost-cutting measures were
provided in the Minutes of the Meeting dated September 26,
2007, prior to the CNA-signing on November 13, 2007.
Meanwhile, on February 11, 2009, the local Sanggunian
passed Ordinance No. 09-01 appropriating the amount of
P39,867,161.00 for the payment of the 2009 CNA Incentive
to be sourced from the LGU's MOOE savings for 2008. As the
2009 CNA Incentive was suffering from the same infirmities as
the 2008 CNA Incentive, among them, the fact that UNGKAT
was not accredited by CSC at the time of the execution of
the CNA, the Office of the Auditor issued ND No. 2009-002101-(09) dated March 6, 2009 disallowing the amount of
P19,933,510.00 representing the 2009 CNA Incentive.
Ruling: Item No. 5.1 of DBM Budget Circular No. 200601 clearly requires accreditation with the CSC for the purpose
of collective negotiations prior to the grant of CNA Incentives.
Records show that UNGKAT, the rank-and-file employees'
organization of the LGU of Tayabas, Quezon, had no CSC
accreditation when the CNAs were executed on November 13,
2007 and February 4, 2008. In fact, it was accredited with the
CSC only on January 14, 2009, as evidenced by CSC Resolution
No. 090087 of even date.
As such, the 2008 and 2009 CNA Incentives granted to
UNG KAT under the CNAs executed on November 13, 2007 and
February 4, 2008 must clearly be disallowed for UNGKAT's
lack of CSC accreditation at that time.
Moreover, as the MOOE savings from which the CNA
Incentives may be sourced was computed from September
2007, or two (2) months before the first CNA was signed on

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Five Local Fiscal Administration

617

November 13, 2007, the 2008 CNA Incentive cannot be granted
in view of Item 7.1.2 of DBM Budget Circular No. 2006-01
which requires that the savings be reckoned from the date of
the signing of the CNA.
Section 342, of the LGC states that the superior officer
directing, or the department head participating in the illegal
or improper use or application or deposit of government funds
or property, shall be jointly and severally liable with the local
treasurer, accountant, budget officer, or other accountable
officer for the sum or property so illegally or improperly used,
applied or deposited.
Clearly, therefore, public officials who are directly
responsible for, or participated in making the illegal
expenditures, as well as those who actually received the
amounts therefrom - in this case, the disallowed CNA Incentives
- shall be solidarity liable for their reimbursement.
By way of exception, however, passive recipients or
payees of disallowed salaries, emoluments, benefits, and
other allowances need not refund such disallowed amounts if
they received the same in good faith. Stated otherwise,
government officials and employees who unwittingly received
disallowed benefits or allowances are not liable for their
reimbursement if there is no finding of bad faith.
The petition is PARTLY GRANTED. The COA Decision
dated December 21, 2012 and the Resolution dated March 13,
2014 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION in that
the petitioners who are rank-and-file employees of the local
government unit of Tayabas, Quezon need not refund the
disallowed amounts of P9,230,434.20 and P19,933,510.00 as
2008 and 2009 Collective Negotiation Agreement Incentives
(CNA), respectively. However, petitioners Faustino A. Silang,
et. al. as approving officers; Enrico T. Nanez, et. al. as officers
of the Unyon ng mga Kawani ng Pamahalaang Lokal ng
Tayabas (UNGKAT); and Raymundo L. Constantino, et. al.
as members of UNGKAT'S Board of Directors, are solidarity
liable to refund the disallowed amounts, without prejudice to:
(a) any finding of administrative liability for the grant of the
disallowed 2008 and 2009 CNA Incentives; and (b) any finding
pertaining to any other public official or person who may be
held liable for the return of such illegal disbursement but were
not impleaded in this case.

I.
The specific clause in Section 344 which provides that

which states that "approval of the disbursement voucher by the
local chief executive himself shall be required whenever local funds

DEL ROSARIO v. SHAIKH
G.R. No. 206249, December 10, 2019, Reyes, J. Jr., J.
Facts: On December 11, 2007, the synchronized elections
for the officers and members of the Liga ng mga Barangay ng
Pilipinas (Liga) Chapters in Municipalities and Component
Cities were held. On the same day, and prior to the actual
elections, the Punong Barangays of Bagac conducted an
election meeting for the election of officers and members of the
Board of Directors of the Liga Municipal Chapter of Bagac,
Bataan (Liga-Bagac Chapter). The meeting was attended
by the Punong Barangays from the 14 Barangays of Bagac,
including Ernesto N. Labog (Labog) and herein respondent
Eva T. Shaikh (Shaikh).
However, during the election meeting, Labog, together
with 5 other Punong Barangays and Oscar M. Ragindin
(Ragindin), Municipal Local Government Operations
Officer (MLGOO) of Bagac and Chairperson of the Board of
Election Supervisors (BES), walked out. Despite this, the
remaining eight Punong Barangays proceeded with the
election and elected Shaikh as the President of the LigaBagac Chapter. Consequently, James Marty L. Lim (Lim),
National President of the Liga, issued a Certificate of
Confirmation dated December 27, 2007 in favor of Shaikh.
In a letter dated April 14, 2008, Mayor Del Rosario
declined the request relative to Shaikh's claimed salaries and
allowances. In denying the release of Shaikh's salaries and
allowances, Mayor Del Rosario noted Labog's adverse claim to
the office being occupied by Shaikh.
On March 4, 2009, Shaikh filed a Petition for mandamus
seeking, among others, to compel Mayor Del Rosario and ViceMayor Teopengco to sign the documents necessary for the
release of her salaries and other emoluments.
The CA Decision provides:
"WHEREFORE, mandamus on Appeal is hereby
GRANTED. The November 4, 2009 Decision of the RTC

620

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

ofBalanga City, Bataan, is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.
Accordingly, respondents are hereby ordered to release
the salaries, emoluments and benefits due to Eva T.
Shaikh for the period she actually rendered her services
as ex-officio member of the Sangguniang Bayan of Bagne,
Bataan."
Ruling: In Atienza u. Villarosa, 497 Phil. 689 (2005)
(Atienza), the Court ruled that the specific clause in Section 344
which provides that "[v]ouchers and payrolls shall be certified
to and approved by the head of the department or office who
has administrative control of the fund concerned" prevails over
the clause in the same section which states that "approval of
the disbursement voucher by the local chief executive himself
shall be required whenever local funds are disbursed."

621

However, Shaikh failed to comply with the procedure
for substitution under Section 17, Rule 3 of the 1997 Revised
Rules of Civil Procedure.
The CA acted in excess of its jurisdiction when it
rendered the September 7, 2012 Decision and the March 6,
2013 Resolution against Vice-Mayor Teopengco and Bontuyan,
despite the fact that they ceased to be the proper parties to
the mandamus case even prior to said dates - Vice-Mayor
Teopengco was no longer the Vice-Mayor of Bagac as of noon
of June 30, 2010, following his loss in the 2010 May elections,
while Bontuyan ceased to be the Municipal Budget Officer
of Bagac after her retirement on April 2, 2011. Likewise, the
September 7, 2012 Decision could not be enforced against ViceMayor Teopengco and Bontuyan's successors in office as doing
so would be in violation of their constitutional rights to due
process.

In the said case, the Court also noted under Section 39
of the Manual on the New Government Accounting System for
Local Government Units, the authority and duty to approve
vouchers for expenditures for the operation of the Sanggunian
pertain to the Vice-Governor or the Vice-Mayor, as the case
may be.

Review on Certiorari is GRANTED. The Decision and the
Resolution of the Court of Appeals are SET ASIDE.

Following these, the Court held that the Vice-Governor,
as the presiding officer of the Sangguniang Panlalawigan,
has the administrative control over the funds of the said local
legislative body. As such, it is also the Vice-Governor which
has the authority to sign all warrants drawn on the provincial
treasury for the expenditures appropriated for the operation of
the Sangguniang Panlalawigan.

of obligations shall be drawn by the local treasurer
and countersigned by the local administrator. In
case of temporary absence or incapacity of the
foregoing officials, these duties shall devolve upon
their immediate assistants.

The pronouncements in Atienza also find application to
this case. As already stated, as the presiding officer of the
Sangguniang Bayan of Bagac, it is the Vice-Mayor of Bagac
who has administrative control over its funds. This means
that it is also the Vice-Mayor of Bagac who has the duty and
authority to approve the vouchers and payrolls of the officers
and employees of the Sangguniang Bayan of Bagac. Naturally,
the payrolls which approval belongs to the Vice-Mayor include
the payrolls of the members of the Sangguniang Bayan of
Bagac, whether sitting as a regular member or in an ex-officio
capacity. This is only proper considering that the continued
performance by the members of the Sangguniang Bayan of
their duties is necessary for the continued operation of the
Snngguniang Bayan.

local treasurer discloses a shortage in cash which
should be on hand, it shall be the duty of the
examining officer to seize the office and its contents
and notify the COA, the local chief executive
concerned, and the local accountant. Thereupon,
the examining officer shall imm ediately turn over
to the accountable officer next-in-rank in the local
treasury service, unless the said officer is likewise
under investigation, the office of the treasurer and
its contents, and close and render his accounts
on the date of turnover. In case the accountable

auditor shall take full possession of the office and
its contents, close and render his accounts on the
date of taking possession, and temporarily continue

that the local treasurer is restored or a successor
has been duly designated. The local treasurer or
accountable officer found with such shortage shall
be automatically suspended from office.

On December 8, 2017, finding probable cause, the
Ombudsman issued resolutions against Chipoco, Balais,
Sabijon, Villamil, Antoque, Eslabon and Buganutan.

Facts: On November 26, 2010, then Mayor Wilfredo S.
Balais sold his Nissan Patrol Wagon 2001 model to Eduardo
A. Ayunting for P500,000.00. On January 28, 2011, Ayunting
sold the subject vehicle to the local government unit of the
Municipality of Labason, Zamboanga de! Norte, represented
by then Vice Mayor Virgilio J. Go (Go), for P960,000.00.

Ruling: The Ombudsman was able to substantiate its
finding of probable cause against petitioners. The Ombudsman
pointed out that the acts and/or omissions of petitioners
satisfied the elements of Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019 and
Article 171(2) of the RPC.

Thereafter, Roberto R. Galon filed a Complaint-Affidavit
dated August 22, 2011 with the Ombudsman against petitioners
Melchor J. Chipoco, in his capacity as then municipal treasurer
and Bids and Awards Committee (BAC) chairperson; Christy
C. Buganutan, in her capacity as then municipal accountant;
Ceriaco P. Sabijon, Thelma F. Antoque, and Aida P. Villamil, in
their capacity as then BAC members; and Glenda G. Eslabon,
in her capacity as then BAC secretariat, charging them with
violation of Sections 3(e), 3g), and 3(h) of Republic Act (R.A.)
No. 3019, or the "Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act"; R.A.
No. 9184, or the "Government Procurement Reform Act";
Government Auditing Rules and Regulations; R.A. No. 6713;
Article 21 7 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC); and Presidential
Decree No. 1829.
Also impleaded were Balais, in his capacity as then
municipal mayor; Go, in his capacity as municipal vice mayor;
Riza T. Melicor, et al., in their capacity as then members of
the Sangguniang Bayan, Ernesto B. Ramirez, in his capacity
as then legislative staff officer of the Sangguniang Bayan; the
state auditor; the general services officer; and Ayunting as the
vendor of the subject vehicle.
In OMB-M-C-11-0356-1, the Ombudsman found probable
cause against Balais, Go, and Ayunting for violation of Section
3(e) of R.A. No. 3019. While the case was being tried in the
Sandiganbayan, Ayunting turned as a state witness. On the
basis of Ayunting's letter to the Ombudsman and the attached
documents thereto, private respondent filed another ComplaintAffidavit dated February 5, 2016. Private respondent posited
that with these new documents, there is sufficient evidence to
hold the other local government officials named in his earlier
complaint-affidavit as respondents liable as conspirators. This
case was docketed as OMB-M-C-16-0112.

First, Chipoco, Buganutan, Sabijon, Eslabon, and Villamil
were public officers performing official functions at the time of
the negotiations and sale. Even if Thelma Antoque was just
an observer during the proceedings in the BAC, she failed to
submit a report as legally required thereby assenting to the
irregularities.
Second, the Ombudsman found that there was bad
faith on the part of Chipoco, Sabijon, Antoque, Eslabon, and
Villamil when they specifically procured, in violation of Section
18 of R.A. No. 9184, the subject vehicle previously owned by
Balais and when they made it appear in the documents that a
bidding was conducted even if there was none. On the part of
Buganutan, it was found that she allowed the disbursement
and procurement notwithstanding the obvious infirmity of the
supporting documents.
Last, it was clarified that there was unwarranted benefit
when petitioners recommended the award of the sale of the
subject vehicle to Ayunting/Oro Cars even if the latter did not
submit its bid. As aptly put by the Ombudsman, "they gave it a
benefit without justification."
With respect to the falsification by a public officer,
employee, or a notary public under Article 171 of the RPC, the
following are the elements of this crime: (1) the offender is a
public officer, employee, or a notary public; (2) the offender
takes advantage of his or her official position; and (3) the
offender falsifies a document by committing any of the acts of
falsification under Article 171. Article 171 (2) provides that "[c]
ausing it to appear that persons have participated in any act
or proceeding when they did not in fact so participate" is an act
of falsification.
As resolved by the Ombudsman, the foregoing elements
were met when it seemingly appeared in the Notice of Award,

630

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Abstract of Bids as Read, and Minutes of Opening of Bids
that Oro Cars, Eves Display Center, and Catmon Car Sales
participated in the procurement of the subject vehicle yet
these establishments categorically denied participation in the
bidding process. The Ombudsman elucidated that petitioners
bad control over the said documents in their respective
capacities and that they signed these notwithstanding the
utter falsities therein.
The petition is DISMISSED and the prayer for temporary
restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction is
DENIED. The Resolution and Order issued by the Office of the
Ombudsman are AFFIRMED.
2.
The Ombudsman found that by authorizing Mayor
Bendana to enter into a direct contracting procedure with Amellar
Solutions, petitioners (Sangguniang Bayan members) usurped the
authority of the Bids and Awards Committee, which had the sole
authority to recommend the method of procurement.
ORNALES v. OFFICE OF THE DEPUTY
OMBUDSMAN FOR LUZON
G.R. No. 214312, September 5, 2018, Leonen, J.
Facts: On August 5, 2004, the Sangguniang Bayan of
Lemery, Batangas issued Resolution No. 04-1048, authorizing
Mayor Raul Bendana to "acquire a proprietary information
technology project [for] Lemery, Batangas; source the
appropriate funds; contract a loan or enter into a financing
scheme; and enter into a contract with [Amellar Solutions]
through direct contracting (single source procurement)
procedure."
On August 31, 2004, Bendana and Amellar Solutions
executed an agreement for the computerization of Lemery's
revenue generation system.
On November 14, 2005, Roberto Ricalde, et al. filed a
complaint affidavit before the Office of the Ombudsman. They
accused members of the Sangguniang Bayan of violating
Republic Act No. 3019, and Republic Act No. 9184, or the
Government Procurement Reform Act, when they authorized
Bendana to enter into a direct contract with Amellar Solutions.
The accused members were Niego Suayan, Melecio Vidal,
Christopher Jones Bello, Ivan Ornales, Shirley Atienza, Eguia,

631

Magnaye, Vergara, De Castro, and Vice Mayor Geraldine
Ornales.
Ruling: Public respondent found that all the elements of
the crime punishable under Section 3, paragraphs (e) and (g) of
Republic Act No. 3019 existed. Petitioners did not deny being
public officers when the acts complained of were committed.
Furthermore, clear preference was given to Amellar Solutions
with the direct contracting mode of procurement, bypassing
the usual mode of public bidding and leading to a gross
disadvantage to the government.
The Ombudsman properly performed its duty when it
found probable cause to charge petitioners with violation
of Article 177 of the Revised Penal Code, or usurpation of
authority or official functions.
Public respondent found that by authorizing Mayor
Bendana to enter into a direct contracting procedure with
Amellar Solutions, petitioners (Sangguniang Bayan members)
usurped the authority of the Bids and Awards Committee,
which had the sole authority to recommend the method of
procurement. Public respondent established that:
By passing the afore-said Resolution, the respondents,
in effect, conferred upon themselves functions which,
under R.A. No. 9184, (Government Procurement Reform
Act) only the [Bids and Awards Committee] can perform.
And by passing the same, respondent local legislative
officials revised and rendered ineffective the power and
authority granted by the Procurement Law to the [Bids
and Awards Committee].
Clearly, public respondent's findings of probable cause
were not arrived at capriciously or with grave abuse of
discretion. There is no reason to reverse its Joint Resolution
and Order.
The Petition for Review is DENIED. The Court of Appeals
Resolutions are AFFIRMED.
SEC. 365. Rule on Awards.
Awards in the
procurement of supplies shall be given to the
lowest complying and responsive bid which meets
all the terms and conditions of the contract or
undertaking.

Decided Case

l.
The investigating team observed circumstances strongly
indicating that public biddings were not actually conducted for
the entire computerization project. The Notices of Disallowance
issued by COA disallowing the payments for the project are
affirmed. However, since the citizens benefited, PowerDev should be
compensated under the principle of quantum meruit.
FERNANDEZ v. COMMISSION ON AUDIT
G.R. No. 205389, November 19, 2019, Inting, J.
Facts: The present case involves two contracts entered
into by the City Government of Talisay, Province of Cebu, to
wit: 1) the computerization project, which took place in 2002 to
2003, during the term of Eduardo R. Gullas as Mayor ofTalisay
City; and 2) the purchase of liquid fertilizers, which took place
in 2005 to 2006, during the term of Socrates C. Fernandez
(petitioner) as Mayor of Talisay City.
The City of Talisay, after allegedly conducting a public
bidding, awarded its computerization project to PowerDev
Corporation (PowerDev).
However, the Audit Team Leader (ATL) of the COA,
Talisay City, questioned the foregoing project. Having found
deficiencies, including lack of the required documents, the ATL
issued Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) Nos. 2004-001
and 2005-01, which resulted in suspensions of payments and
later to Notices of Disallowances.
The ATL also question the price of 3,333 bottles of liquid
fertilizer purchased by the City of Talisay at P900,00 per liter
or a total of P2,999,700.00. The highest price obtained by
the ATL through canvass and actual purchase from Pacifica
Agrivet was P171.00 per liter plus 10% thereof, or P188.10.
Thus, the unit overprice was P711.90. Subsequently, the ATL
issued ND No. 2007-002 dated July 23, 2007, disallowing the
amount of P2,372,762.70 (or the unit overprice of P711.90
multiplied by 3,333 units).
Ruling: The investigating team observed circumstances
strongly indicating that public biddings were not actually
conducted for the entire computerization project.
In his petition, petitioner Mayor Fernandez strongly
insists that "the bidding process and the disbursement of

Book II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Six Property and Supply Management
in the Local Government Units

633

the expense for the information Technology Project of the
City of Talisay were all done in accordance with law and at
no disadvantage to the government whatsoever. Quite the
contrary, however, he admits in his Memorandum that the City
of Talisay directly contracted with PowerDev. He asserts that"
[t]he choice of directly contracting with PowerDev brought
advantages to the City as it expedited the process, and most
importantly is that the desired and much needed automation
of its processes were accomplished in a short period of time.
Anent the contention that the City of Talisay validly
resorted to direct contracting as an alternative method of
procurement, the Court finds it to be unworthy of consideration.
It is evident that such claim is a mere afterthought. Petitioner
has not clearly shown any of the allowed conditions for direct
contracting.

The GOA also did not err in disallowing the overprice in
the purchase of liquid fertilizers. As found by the COA, the
investigation of the special audit team revealed irregularities
attending the bidding process.
The first BAC Minutes [dated December 16, 2005), which
was attached to support Disbursement Voucher (DV) No. [sic]
DV No. 300-0512-2510 for the payment to Gracias Industries
does not include in the listing of the lowest bidders the name
Gracias Industries. Instead, it lists as lowest bidder for liquid
fertilizer Joseth Trading. This is the last entry of bidders on
the second page and signed by Geralie P. Alob, the designated
recorder of the BAC meeting.
Subsequently, the City of Talisay submitted a folder of
documents in support of its defense against the disallowance.
This time, it submitted another BAC Minutes [likewise dated
December 16, 2005], but instead of Joseth Trading as the lowest
bidder recorded therein, it was Gracias Industries already.
Also, this time the lowest bidder for the liquid fertilizer is not
anymore the last entry of the BAC minutes, but an additional
five (5) entries of lowest bidders for different products and
services were included, which did not appear in the BAC
minutes attached to the DV.
The team hereby puts in issue the authenticity of the
said two BAC Minutes. This discrepancy, if not satisfactorily
explained by the City of Talisay, including its Designated
Recorder of the BAC meeting, raises serious doubt as to the

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

634

authenticity of these particular bidding documents and of the
alleged bidding itself.
As found by the COA, the lowest price per liter of the liquid
fertilizer, as offered in the alleged bidding and purchased by the
City of Talisay, was P900.00. On the other hand, the highest
selling price per liter obtained by the ATL through canvass
and actual purchase from Pacifica Agrivet, was Pl 71.00 per
liter plus 10% thereof, or P188.10. Hence, there appears a
considerably huge unit overprice of P7 l l.90, which the Court
cannot brush aside.
The petition for certiorari is DISMISSED. The Decision and
Resolution of the Commission on Audit are AFFIRMED.
SEC, 366. Procurement without Public Bidding.
- Procurement of supplies may be made without
the benefit of public bidding under any of the
following modes:
(a)

Personal canvass of responsible merchants;

(b)

Emergency purchase;

(c)

Negotiated purchase;

(d) Direct purchase from manufacturers or
exclusive distributors; and
(e)
A.

Purchase from other government entities.

Decided Case

1.
Petitioners' case does not qualify under the exceptions
provided by law for procurement without public bidding. 'Thus,
petitioners should have conducted a competitive public bidding on
the procurement of the medicines for the municipality in order to
avoid suspicions of irregularity. Petitioners, as mayors, should have
acted in a circumspect manner to observe the law in order to promote
transparency in the handling of government funds. As things stand,
there was no public bidding that was conducted.
CABRERA v. PEOPLE
G.R. Nos. 1916110-14, July 29, 2019, Reyes, J. Jr., J.
Facts: Petitioners Mayor Librado M. Cabrera (January
30, 1998 to June 30, 1998) and Mayor Fe M. Cabrera (July
28,1998 to July 6, 1999) together with accused Luther H.

635

Leonor, (Municipal Councilor) as public officers, were charged
in four separate Informations with violation of Section 3(e) of
R.A. No. 3019.
Leonor, despite being the Municipal Councilor, acted as
the authorized representative of DLI as he was the one who
received all payments due and signed all pertinent documents
of the transactions.
Ruling: In the instant case, Librado Cabrera's and Fe
Cabrera's violation of the aforesaid Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019
basically hinges on the awarding of procurement contract (for
the purchase of medicines) to a private person (DLI) without
the benefit of competitive public bidding as provided under the
LGC, as referred to in Criminal Cases Nos. 27555 and 27557.
As to petitioners' claim that the purchases were emergency
purchases (Sec. 368, LGC) - While Fe Cabrera was able to show
the Purchase Request dated August 25, 1998, issued by the
Head of the Municipal Health Office, Dr. Adolfo Magistrado,
the request was incomplete in details. There was likewise no
Certification that at the time of the procurement, the price
contracted for, was the lowest and that there was availability
of funds as required by the IRR. No such purchase request was
presented by Librado.
As to petitioners' claim that they made direct purchase
from DLI as it is a duly licensed manufacturer of medicines in
the Philippines (Sec. 370, LGC) such barren allegation is not
sufficient. We cannot accept hook, line and sinker, the ruling
of the Ombudsman that DLI is a duly licensed manufacturer of
medicines. Courts, generally, do not take judicial notice of the
evidence presented in other proceedings. There must be proof
establishing that DLI is indeed a duly licensed manufacturer
of medicines in the Philippines.
Neither did petitioners show that they conducted a
canvass of prices in order to obtain the lowest of prices of
the known manufacturers for the same quality of medicines
needed. Petitioners conveniently skipped the requirement of
canvass before making the purchases. Section 370 of the LGC
imposes a duty that a canvass of the known manufacturers first
be conducted before the purchase is made, so as to ensure that
the local government would spend the lowest possible price for
such purchase. Since petitioners are claiming exemption to the
requirement of public bidding, the burden of proof lies upon

636

Boo k II Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters
Title Six Property and Supply Management
in the Local Govomment Units

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

them to show that there is no qualified manufacturer but DLI
which could offer the best possible price for the government.

Provinces and Cities and Municipalities within
the Metropolitan Manila Area:

For failure to comply with the procedure, petitioners' case
does not qualify under the exceptions provided by law. Thus,
petitioners should have conducted a competitive public bidding
on the procurement of the medicines for the municipality in
order to avoid suspicions of irregularity. Petitioners, as mayors,
should have acted in a circumspect manner to observe the law
in order to promote transparency in the handling of government
funds. As things stand, there was no public bidding that was
conducted.

First and Second Class

Third and Fourth Class

One hundred thousand
Pesos (P100,000.00)

Fifth and Sixth Class

Fifty thousand pesos
(P50,000.00)

It was established in this case and admitted by
petitioners, that DLI is a corporation whose stockholders,
directors and officers are the relatives of Librado. Petitioners
refusal to conduct public bidding and to award the contract to
the winning bidder, smack of favoritism and bias in favor of
DLI. Indeed, nothing demonstrates manifest partiality more
than the awarding of procurement contract to second degree
relatives, either by consanguinity or affinity, without the
benefit of competitive public bidding.
By choosing DLI without public bidding, petitioners
evidently give unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference
in favor of private persons, through manifest partiality.
Petition is denied. The decision and resolution of the
Sandiganbayan fnding petitioners guilty of violation of RA
3019 are affirmed.
SEC. 367. Procurement through Personal
Canvass.
Upon approval by the Committee
on Awards, procurement of supplies may be
effected after personal canvass of at least three (3)
responsible suppliers in the locality by a committee
of three (3) composed of the local general services
officer or the municipal or barangay treasurer, as
the case may be, the local accountant, and the head
of office or department for whose use the supplies

A.

Decided Case

1.
A local chief executive could only resort to a negotiated
purchase under Section 366 of R.A. No. 7160 and COA Resolution
Nos. 95-244 and 95-244-A, if the following two requisites are

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

640

present: (1) public biddings have failed for at least two consecutive
times and; (2) no suppliers have qualified to participate or win in the
biddings. The Sandiganbayan correctly ruled that by procuring the
subject truck through a negotiated purchase without public bidding,
petitioner failed to comply with the above stated procedure.

ONG v. PEOPLE
601 SCRA 47, September 25, 2009,
Ynares-Santiago, J.
Facts: On August 12, 1996 petitioner Felicitas Ong in
her capacity as Mayor of Angadanan, Isabela, bought an Isuzu
dump truck for P750,000.00 from Josephine Ching for the use
of the municipality.
On March 26, 1997, a letter-complaint was filed against
petitioner by her successor, Mayor Diosdado Siquian and
several other Sangguniang Bayan members before the Office of
the Ombudsman, accusing her of malversation of public funds
and property in connection with several alleged irregularities
committed during her term as Mayor of Angadanan, including
the purchase of the dump truck for being grossly overpriced.
On August 14, 1997, Graft Investigation Officer I Germain
G. Lim found no probable cause to hold petitioner liable for the
charges. Upon reconsideration however, she was indicted for
violation of Sec. 3 (e) of RA No. 3019, as amended, with respect
to the acquisition of the dump truck.

J

Ruling: COA Resolutions Nos. 95-244 and 95-244-A are
implementing guidelines which must be read and applied in
conjunction with Republic Act No. 7160 Section 356 thereof
states the general rule that the acquisition of supplies by the
local government units shall be through competitive bidding.
The only instances when public bidding requirements can be
dispensed with are provided under Section 366 which includes
a negotiated purchase.
Negotiated purchase is further qualified by Section 369,
LGC.
Thus, a local chief executive could only resort to a
negotiated purchase under Section 366 of RA No. 7160 and
COA Resolution Nos. 95-244 and 95-244-A, if the following two
requisites are present: (1) public biddings have failed for at

Book II
Local Taxation and Fiscal Matters

641

least two consecutive times and; (2) no suppliers have qualified
to participate or win in the biddings.
The Sandiganbayan correctly ruled that by procuring the
subject truck through a negotiated purchase without public
bidding, petitioner failed to comply with the above stated
procedure. Indeed, as the local chief executive, petitioner is not
only expected to know the proper procedure in the procurement
of supplies, she is also duty bound to follow the same and her
failure to discharge this duty constitutes gross and inexcusable
negligence.
Price quotations obtained from several suppliers as well
as the testimonies of Ramon de Guzman Sevilla, Ruben Lappay
and Mirasol Lappay proved that the dump truck purchased by
petitioner was over-priced. Hence, had petitioner observed the
proper procurement procedure, the municipality of Angadanan
could have acquired a dump truck similar to, if not better
than the one originally bought, at a much lower price of not
more than P500,000.00. Without doubt, petitioner's negligence
caused undue injury to the government while at the same time
gave unwarranted benefits to Josephine Ching.
The petition is DENIED. The Decision of the
Sandiganbayan finding petitioner Felicitas P. Ong guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic
Act No. 3019 and sentencing her to suffer the penalty of six (6)
years and one (1) month, as minimum, to ten (dO) years and
one (1) day, as maximum, with perpetual disqualification from
holding public office and with order to return the amount of
P250,000.00, is AFFIRMED.

Procurement may be made

THE BARANGAY
CHAPT ER 1• Role and Creation of the Barangay
SEC. 384. Role of the Barangay. As the basic
political unit, the barangay serves as the primary
unit of government policies, plans, programs,
projects, and activities in the community, and as
a forum wherein the collective views of the people
may be expressed, crystallized and considered, and
where disputes may be amicably settled.
SEC, 385. Manner of Creation.
A barangay
may be created, divided, merged, abolished, or its
boundary substantially altered, by law or by an
ordinance of the sangguniang panlalawigan or
sangguniang panlungsod, subject to approval by
a majority of the votes cast in a plebiscite to be
conducted by the COMELEC in the local government
unit or units directly affected within such period of
time as may be determined by the law or ordinance
creating said barangay. In the case of creation
of barangays by the sangguniang panlalawigan,
the recommendation of the sangguniang bayan
concerned shall be necessary.
A.

Decided Case

1.
Section 68 of the Revised Administrative Code has been
repealed by R.A. No. 2370 which states that barrios may not be
created, nor their boundaries increased except by an Act of Congress
or of the corresponding provincial board upon the petition of the
648

649

majority of the voters in the areas affected and the recommendation
of the council of the municipality in which the proposed barrio is
situated. The Executive Orders issued by the President creating
33 municipalities are deemed unconstitutional. The denial to the
President of the power to create a barrio negates the bigger power to
create a municipality.
PELAEZ v. AUDITOR GENERAL
15 SCRA 569, December 24, 1965, Concepcion, J.
Facts: In October 1964, the President acting pursuant
to Sec. 68, RAC issued a series of Executive Orders, creating
33 municipalities. Petitioner Pelaez, instituted this action to
restrain the respondent from passing in audit any expenditure
of public funds in the implementation of said Executive Orders
on the ground that they are null and void upon the basis that
Sec. 68 has been impliedly repealed by R.A. 2370 which provides
that barrios may not be created or their boundaries altered
nor their names changed except by an Act of Congress or of
the corresponding provincial board upon petition of a majority
of the voters in the area affected and the recommendation of
the council of the municipality in which the proposed barrio is
situated.
Petitioner argues accordingly that if the President under
R.A. 2370 cannot even create a barrio, it follows that the
more he could not create a municipality which is composed
of several barrios since barrios are units of municipalities.
Respondent answers in the affirmative upon the theory that a
new municipality can be created without creating new barrios
such as by placing old barrios under the jurisdiction of a new
municipality.
Held: The cogency and force of petitioner's argument
is too obvious to be denied or even questioned. Since R.A.
2370 took effect on January l, 1960, the statutory denial of
the presidential authority to create a new barrio implies a
negation of the bigger power to create a municipality which
consists of several barrios. Whereas the power to fix a common
boundary, in order to avoid or settle conflicts of jurisdiction
between adjoining municipalities, as provided in Sec. 68, RAC,
may partake of an administrative nature, involving as it does
the adoption of means and ways to carry into effect the law
creating said municipality, the authority to create municipal

650

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

corporations is essentially legislative in nature for municipal
corporations are purely the creatures of statutes.
SEC. 68. RAC, insofar as it grants to the President the
power to create municipalities, does not meet the well-settled
requirements for a valid delegation of the power to fix the
details in the enforcement of a law. For although Congress may
delegate to another branch of the government the power to fill
in the details in the execution, enforcement or administration
of law, it is essential that the said law: a) be complete in itself
setting forth therein the policy to be executed, carried out or
implemented by the delegate; and b) to fix a standard, the
limits of which are sufficiently determinate or determinableto which the delegate must conform in the performances of his
functions. R.A. does not enunciate any policy to be carried out
or implemented by the President.
The 1935 Constitution gives only "general supervision"
of local governments by the President. This provision repeals
SEC. 68, RAC.
The Executive Orders are unconstitutional.
2.
A case involving a boundary dispute between local
government units presents a prejudicial question which must first be
decided before plebiscites for the creation of the proposed barangays
may be held.
CITY OF PASIG v. COMELEC
314 SCRA 179, September 10, 1999, Ynares-Santiago, J.
Facts: These are two (2) petitions which both question the
propriety of the suspension of plebiscite proceedings pending
the resolution of the issue of boundary disputes between the
Municipality of Cain ta and the City of Pasig.
G.R. No. 125646 involves the proposed Barangay
Karangalan while G.R. No. 128663 involves the proposed
Barangay Napico both in the City of Pasig. The City of Pasig
claims these areas as part of its jurisdiction/territory, while the
Municipality of Cainta claims that these proposed barangays
encroached upon areas within its own jurisdiction/territory.

Held: We agree with the position of the COMELEC
that Civil Case No. 94-3006 involving the boundary dispute
between the Municipality of Cainta and the City of Pasig

Book III Local Government Units
Title One 'The Barangay

651

presents a prejudicial question which must first be decided
before plebiscites for the creation of the proposed barangays
maybe held.
The City of Pasig argues that there is no prejudicial
question since the same contemplates a civil and criminal
action and docs not come into play where both cases are civil,
as in the instant case. While this may be the general rule, this
Court has held in Vidad u. RTC of Negros Oriental, Br. 42,
227 SCRA 271, that, in the interest of good order, we can very
well suspend action on one case pending the final outcome of
another case closely interrelated or linked to the first.
Here, while the City of Pasig vigorously claims that the
areas covered by the proposed Barangays Karangalan and
Napico are within its territory, it cannot deny that portions
of the same area are included in the boundary dispute case
pending before the RTC of Antipolo. Surely, whether the
areas in controversy shall be decided as within the territorial
jurisdiction of the Municipality of Cainta or the City of Pasig
has material bearing to the creation of the proposed Barangays
Karangalan and Napico. Indeed, a requisite for the creation
of a barangay, is for its territorial jurisdiction to be properly
identified by metes and bounds or by more or less permanent
natural boundaries.
Therefore, the plebiscite on the creation of Barangay
Karangalan should be held in abeyance pending final
resolution of the boundary dispute between the City of Pasig
and the Municipality of Cainta by the RTC of Antipolo City.
In the same vein, the plebiscite held on March 15, 1997 to
ratify the creation of Barangay Napico, Pasig City, should be
ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.
SEC. 386. Requisites for Creation.
(a)
A barangay may be created out of contiguous
territory which has a population of at least Two
thousand (2,000) inhabitants as certified by the
National Statistics Office except in cities and
municipalities within Metro Manila and other
metropolitan political subdivisions or in highly

shall be deemed as persons in authority in their
jurisdictions, while other barangay officials
and members who may be designated by law or
ordinance and charged with the maintenance of
public order, protection and security of life and
property, or the maintenance of a desirable and
balanced environment, and any barangay member
who comes to the aid of persons in authority, shall

thereof shall not reduce the population of the
original barangay or barangays to less than the
minimum requirement prescribed herein.
To enhance the delivery of the basic services
in the indigenous cultural communities, barangays
may be created in such communities by an Act of
Congress, notwithstanding the above requirement.
(b) The territorial jurisdiction of the new
barangay shall be properly identified by metes
and bounds or by more or less permanent natural
boundaries. The territory need not be contiguous if
it comprise two (2) or more islands.
(c) The governor or city mayor may prepare
a consolidation plan for barangays, based on
the criteria prescribed in this section, within his
territorial jurisdiction. The plan shall be submitted
to the sangguniang panlalawigan or sangguniang
panlungsod concerned for appropriate action .In
the case of municipalities within the Metropolitan

In addition to the Punong Barangay, the members of the
Sangguniang Barangay, or Kagawads, and members of the Lupong
Tagapayapa are now considered not merely as agents of, but as
persons, in authority.

PEOPLE v. SION
277 SCRA 127, August 11, 1997, Davide, Jr., J.
Facts: In its decision in Criminal Case No. D-10796
dated 20 January 1993, the RTC of Dagupan City decreed
as follows: "WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused Felipe
Sion alias Junior" and Federico Disu alias Miguel Disu guilty
beyond reasonable doubt as principals of the crime of Murder
pursuant to Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code, and in view
of the attendance of the aggravating circumstance of cruelty
which is not offset by any mitigating circumstance, the two (2)
accused are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion
Perpetua, and to indemnify jointly the heirs of the victim the
sum of P50,000.00 and to pay the costs of the proceedings."
Held: We agree with appellants that appellant Sion
is entitled to the benefit of the mitigating circumstance
of voluntary surrender, which requires that "the offender
voluntarily surrendered himself to a person in authority."
In the afternoon of 17 October 1991, appellant Sion
"presented" himself to Kagawad Modesto Lagman, a Barangay
Kagawad of Brgy. Binday, San Fabian, Pangasinan, who
in turn, "escorted and surrendered" him to the police in the
poblacion.
We disagree with appellee's submission that there was no
voluntary surrender because appellant Sion surrendered to a

654

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

mere barangay "Kagawad" or Sangguiang Barangay member
and not to the police authorities, implying that the former is
not a person in authority. This ignores Section 388 of the Local
Government Code of 1991 which expressly provides, in part,
that "[f]or purposes of the Revised Penal Code, the punong
barangay, sangguniang barangay members and members of
the lupong tagapamayapa in each barangay shall be deemed as
persons in authority in their jurisdictions." This law expands
the definition of a person in authority under the Revised
Penal Code, wherein among the barangay officials, only the
barangay captain or chairman, now called Punong Barangay,
is expressly considered a person, in authority, as provided in
Article 152 thereof. Thus, in addition to the Punong Barangay,
the members of the Sangguniang Barangay, or Kagawads, and
members of the Lupong Tagapayapa are now considered not
merely as agents of, but as persons, in authority.
2.
The aggravating circumstance of disregard of respect due
to the offended party on account of his rank cannot be appreciated
where there is no proof of the specific fact or circumstance that the
accused deliberately intended to insult the rank of the victim as
barangay captain.
PEOPLE v. PENA
291 SCRA 606, July 1, 1998, Davide, Jr., J.
Facts: On 31 May 1993, the trial court promulgated its
decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:
"IN
VIEW
OF
THE
FOREGOING
CONSIDERATIONS, judgment is hereby rendered,
finding the accused Juan Pena, GUILTY, beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of Murder, defined and
penalized under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code,
qualified by treachery, aggravated by disregard of the
respect due the offended party on account of his rank,
and evident premeditation mitigated by the voluntary
surrender of the accused, hereby sentencing the accused to
suffer RECLUSION PERPETUA, with all the accessories
of the law, and to indemnify the heirs of Isidro Odiada,
also known 88 Proceso Odiada, the sum of P87,000.00 88
actual damages, P50,000.00 for the death of the victim,
with costs against the accused."

Book III- Local Government Units
Title One_ The Barangay

655

Held: We cannot uphold the lower court's finding of the
aggravating circumstance of disregard of respect due to the
offended party on account of his rank. There is no doubt that
the victim was of higher rank than the accused since the former
was the barangay captain, while the latter, as chief barangay
tanod, was the former's subordinate. However, there is no proof
of the specific fact or circumstance that the accused deliberately
intended to insult the rank of the victim as barangay captain.
3.
Melchor Recto was a barangay chief tanod; however, at
the crime scene he was a mere bystander. Apparently, he was not
acting and had no occasion to act in the performance of his official
duties that afternoon. Thus, the attack on him did not amount to
direct assault. The trial court was correct in ruling that the attack
on Percival Orbe
then a barangay captain, a person in authority
amounted to qualified direct assault, because he was attacked
on the occasion of the performance of his duty. At the time, he was
attempting to pacify appellant and to keep the peace between the
two groups. Considering that Antonio Macalipay was a kagawad
who was in the actual performance of his duties when he was shot
the attack on him constituted direct assault.
"
PEOPLE v. RECTO
G.R. No. 129069, October 17, 2001, Panganiban, J.
Facts: The Informations in Criminal Case Nos. 1970 and
1971 charged appellant Julio Recto with direct assault with
frustrated murder committed against Barangay Chief Tanod
Melchor Recto and Barangay Captain Percival Orbe.
The Information in Criminal Case No. 1972, which
charged appellant with direct assault with murder, committed
against Barangay Kagawad Antonio Macalipay.
Ruling: The victim, Melchor Recto
being then the
barangay chief tanod of Ambulong, Magdiwang, Romblon
- was clearly an agent of a person in authority. However,
contrary to the findings of the trial court, he was not "engaged
in the performance of his official duties" at the time he was shot.
Neither was he attacked "on the occasion of such performance,"
as we will now show.
It must be emphasized that Melchor Recto was on his way
home when he happened to pass by the bodega of the Rance
couple. He testified as follows:

656

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Book III -- Local Government Units
Title One The Barangay

657

Melchor explained that when appellant's group arrived,
it was Barangay Captain Percival Orbe and Kagawad Antonio
Macalipay who talked to the group. Melchor did not do anything
to avert the tension. He only watched what was transpiring
and later hid himself when the first shot was fired.

WHEREFORE, the Decision dated April 2, 1997, issued
by the RTC of Romblon, is hereby MODIFIED as follows:

Thinking that appellant had already left the bodega,
Melchor, while hiding inside the old bathroom for several
minutes, decided to jump out of a broken down window and ran
towards the national road.

Second, in Criminal Case No. 1971, appellant is
hereby CONVICTED of the complex crime of qualified
direct assault with attempted homicide.

Clearly, from his arrival at the scene of the crime to
his departure therefrom, Melchor was not engaged in the
performance of his official duties. Neither was he attacked on
the occasion thereof.
Unquestionably, Melchor Recto was a barangay chief
tanod; however, at the crime scene he was a mere bystander.
Apparently, he was not acting and had no occasion to act in
the performance of his official duties that afternoon. Thus, the
attack on him did not amount to direct assault.
In Criminal Case No. 1971, the trial court was correct in
ruling that the attack on Percival Orbe
then a barangay
captain, a person in authority
amounted to qualified direct
assault, because he was attacked on the occasion of the
performance of his duty. At the time, he was attempting to
pacify appellant and to keep the peace between the two groups.
In Criminal Case No. 1972, appellant does not question
the finding of the trial court that he shot Antonio Macalipay.
However, he submits that it erred in finding the presence of the
qualifying circumstance of treachery. We agree.
Appellant was seen holding a balisong or fan knife during
the heated confrontation, before he pulled out the shutgun and
pointed it at the other group. Macalipay, in a bold yet foolish
attempt, stepped forward in front of appellant and told him:
"Ayosan ta lang inu? (No, don't, because we will just settle
this)." And "[s]imultaneously with the last word in the phrase
[']don't because we will just settle this, [']" appellant fired his
gun, killing the victim.
Considering that Antonio Macalipay was a kagawad who
was in the actual performance of his duties when he was shot,
the attack on him constituted direct assault.

First, in Criminal Case No. 1970, appellant is hereby
CONVICTED of attempted homicide.

Third, in Criminal Case No. 1972, appellant is
hereby CONVICTED of qualified direct assault with
homicide aggravated by the use of a weapon.

A barrio captain is considered under R.A. 3590, otherwise
known as the Revised Barrio Charter, a person in authority. As
such, he may arrest and detain persons within legal limits.
MILO v. SALANGA
152 SCRA 113, July 20, 1987, Gancayco, J.
Held: Under Republic Act No. 3590, otherwise known as
the Revised Barrio Charter, the powers and duties of a barrio
captain includes the following: to look after the maintenance
of public order in the barrio and to assist the municipal mayor
and the municipal councilor in charge of the district in the
performance of their duties in such barrio; to look after the
general welfare of the barrio; to enforce all laws and ordinances
which are operative within the barrio; and to organize and lead
an emergency group whenever the same may be necessary for
the maintenance of peace and order in the barrio.
Upon the barrio captain depends the maintenance
of public order in the barrio. For public disorder therein,
inevitably people blame him.

If there is a disturbing act to said order or a threat
to disturb public order, what can the barrio captain do?
Understandably, he resorts to peaceful measures. He may take
preventive measures like placing offenders under surveillance

necessary he may subject them to the full force of law.
He is a peace officer in the barrio considered under the

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

ALQUIZOLA, SR. v. OCOL
313 SCRA 273, August 27, 1999, Vitug, J.
Facts: Petitioner Ramon Alquizola, Sr., won the post of
Punong Barangay of Barangay 'Tubod, Iligan City, in the 12th
of May 1997 barangay elections. Respondents Gallardo Ocol,
Camilo Penaco, Saturnina Mendoza, Rafael Ardiente, Vicente
Caseres, Ricardo Zosa III, and Sirad Umpa were appointees of
the former punong barangay of Barangay Tu bod. The first two
occupying the positions of barangay treasurer and barangay
secretary, respectively, with the rest being barangay utility
workers.
The RTC of Iligan City ordered petitioner Ramon
Alquizola, Sr., to cease and desist from dismissing respondents
and replacing them with his co-petitioners.

Held: The Code under Sec. 389 explicitly vests on the
punong barangay, upon approval by a majority of all the
members of the sangguniang barangay, the power to appoint
or replace the barangay treasurer, the barangay secretary, and
other appointive barangay officials. This provision is reinforced,
in the case of the secretary and the treasurer, by the provisions
of Section 394 and Section 395 of the Local Government Code.
Verily, the power of appointment is to be exercised
conjointly by the punong barangay and a majority of all the
members of the sangguniang barangay. Without such conjoint
action, neither an appointment nor a replacement can be
effectual.
Applying the rule that the power to appoint includes the
power to remove, one that the Court finds no cogent reason
to now depart from, the questioned dismissal from office
of the barangay officials by the punong barangay without
the concurrence of the majority of all the members of the
Sangguniang Barangay cannot be legally justified.
The instant petition is DENIED.
3.
Considering that Atty. Parawan's role as a barangay
captain, was a peacekeeping officer of his barangay and therefore in
direct conflict with the role of providing competent legal assistance to
appellant who was accused of committing a crime in his jurisdiction,

Title One The Barangay

661

Atty. Parawan could not be considered as an independent counsel of
appellant, when the latter executed his extrajudicial confession.

PEOPLE v. TOMAQUIN
G.R. No. 129069, July 23, 2004, Austria-Martinez, J.
Facts: Appellant, Elizar Tomaquin was investigated by
SPO2 Mario Monilar of the Homicide Section, Ramos Police
Station in Cebu City. After being apprised of his constitutional
rights, appellant told SPO2 Monilar that he was willing to
confess and asked Atty. Parawan, the barangay captain, to
assist him. SPO2 Monilar called Atty. Parawan but the latter
told him that he will be available in the afternoon. Wben Atty.
Parawan arrived at 2:00 in the afternoon, he conferred with
appellant for around fifteen minutes. Atty. Parawan then
called SPO2 Monilar and told him that appellant was ready to
give his statement. Appellant's extrajudicial confession, which
was taken down completely in the Cebuano dialect.
After trial, the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City (Branch
18) (RTC for brevity) rendered its decision on October 24, 1997,
convicting appellant Elizar Tomaquin of the crime of Murder.

Ruling: The crucial issue in this case is whether or
not the extrajudicial confession executed by appellant, with
the assistance of Atty. Fortunato Parawan, is admissible in
evidence against him.
Section 12, Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides:
(1) Any person under investigation for the
commission of an offense shall have the right to be informed
of his right to remain silent and to have competent and
independent counsel preferably of his own choice. If the
person cannot afford the services of counsel, he must be
provided with one. These rights cannot be waived except
in writing and in the presence of counsel.
The words "competent and independent counsel in the
constitutional provision is not an empty rhetoric. It stresses
the need to accord the accused, under the uniquely stressful
conditions of a custodial investigation, an informed judgment
on the choices explained to him by a diligent and capable
lawyer.

662

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

As heretofore stated, Atty. Fortunato Parawan, at that
time, was the barangay captain of Barangay Lorega, Cebu
City. Under Sec. 389 of the 1991 Local Government Code, a
barangay captain performs certain duties and functions.
Simply put, Atty. Parawan, as barangay captain, is called
upon to enforce the law and ordinances in his barangay and
ensure peace and order at all times.
In fact, as barangay captain, Atty. Parawan is deemed
a person in authority under Article 152 of the Revised Penal
Code.
Considering that Atty. Parawan's role as a barangay
captain, was a peacekeeping officer of his barangay and
therefore in direct conflict with the role of providing competent
legal assistance to appellant who was accused of committing a
crime in his jurisdiction, Atty. Parawan could not be considered
as an independent counsel of appellant, when the latter
executed his extrajudicial confession. What the Constitution
requires is the presence of an independent and competent
counsel, one who will effectively undertake his client's defense
without any intervening conflict of interest.
Neither does Atty. Parawan qualify as a competent
counsel, i.e., an effective and vigilant counsel. An "effective and
vigilant counsel" necessarily and logically requires that the
lawyer be present and able to advise and assist his client from
the time the confessant answers the first question asked by
the investigating officer until the signing of the extrajudicial
confession.
Records also show that appellant was presented to SPO2
Monilar in the morning of December 16, 1996. When appellant
intimated that he was willing to confess and requested the
presence of Atty. Parawan, SPO2 Monilar called up Atty.
Parawan and informed him of appellant's decision. Atty.
Parawan arrived at the Ramos Police Station only at 2:00 in the
afternoon. By the time Atty. Parawan arrived, the investigation
had already started and SPO2 Monilar had already asked and
elicited information from appellant. Worse, Atty. Parawan
merely "observed" during the entire investigation and failed to
advise or explain to appellant the questions being propounded
by SPO2 Monilar. He did not even bother to ask appellant if

Book III Local Government Units
Title One The Barangay

663

the extrajudicial confession he was about to execute was being
voluntarily given.
Clearly, Atty. Parawan failed to meet the exacting
standards of an independent and competent counsel as required
by the Constitution. Thus, the extrajudicial confession executed
by appellant, even if gospel truth, is deemed an uncounselled
confession and therefore, inadmissible in evidence.
Appellant Elizar Tomaquin is hereby ACQUITTED.
4.
This prescribed legal framework governing the release and
disbursement of IRA funds to the respective barangays disabuses
from the notion that a barangay chairman, relying solely on his
authority as a local executive, has the right to demand physical
possession of the IRA funds allocated by the national government to
the barangay. The right to demand for the funds belongs to the local
government itself through the authorization of their Sanggunian.
LUCMAN v. MALAWI
G.R. No. 159794, December 19, 2006, Tinga, J.
Facts: This is a petition for review challenging the decision
of the trial court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals, granting the
petition for mandamus filed by herein respondents Alimatar
Malawi, et al., Barangay Chairmen (or Punong Barangay) of
several barangays in the province of Lanao de! Sur.
The petition for mandamus filed by respondents before
the trial court is rooted in their claim that they were deprived
of their Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA) for the 24 and
3"' quarters of 1997. Respondents further alleged that these
same funds were released by petitioner, Maclaring Lucman as
Manager of Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), the depositary
bank, to third persons.
All respondents were not allowed to withdraw the IRA
funds from the opened accounts, owing to the absence of the
requisite Accountant's Advice.
Ruling: Clearly, this case was not initiated by the
barangays themselves. Neither did the barangay chairmen
file the suit in representation of their respective barangays.
Nothing from the records shows otherwise. On this score alone,
the case in the lower court should have been dismissed.

664

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Even if the barangays themselves had filed the case, still
it would not prosper. The case involves government funds and
as such, any release therefrom can only be done in accordance
with the prevailing rules and procedures.
The Government Accounting and Auditing Manual
(GAAM) provides that the local treasurers shall maintain
the depositary accounts in the name of their respective local
government units with banks. Under the Local Government
Code, the treasurer is given the power, among others, to: (1)
keep custody of barangay funds and properties; and (2) disburse
funds in accordance with the financial procedures provided
by the Local Government Code. The same manual defines
disbursements as constituting all cash paid out during a given
period either in currency or by check.
Sec. 344 of the Local Government Code further provides
for certain requirements in cases of disbursements.
Thus, as a safeguard against unwarranted disbursements,
certifications are required from: (a) the local budget officer
as to the existence and validity of the appropriation; (b) the
local accountant as to the legal obligation incurred by the
appropriation; (c) the local treasurer as to the availability of
funds; and (d) the local department head as to the validity,
propriety and legality of the claim against the appropriation.
This prescribed legal framework governing the release
and disbursement of IRA funds to the respective barangays
disabuses from the notion that a barangay chairman, relying
solely on his authority as a local executive, has the right to
demand physical possession of the IRA funds allocated by the
national government to the barangay. The right to demand for
the funds belongs to the local government itself through the
authorization of their Sanggunian.
Considering the implications of this action of possibly
depriving several local government units of their IRAs, the
Court took the initiative to request the COMELEC to issue
certifications on who were the duly elected chairmen of the
barangays concerned. The COMELEC issued to this Court a
list of the elected barangay chairmen which confirmed the reelection ofrespondents as barangay chairmen of their respective
barangays. If withdrawals were indeed made, whether by
the respondents or by impostors, the matter deserves to be

investigated since public funds are involved. Accordingly, we
refer the matter to the DILG for investigation and appropriate
action.
The petition is GRANTED.
5.
His open interference in a legitimate police activity. and
defiance of the police's authority only show his clear intent to violate
the law; in fact, he reneged on his first obligation as the grassroot
official tasked at the first level with the enforcement of the law.
ALEJANDRO v. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN
G.R. No. 173121, April 3, 2013, Brion, J.
Facts: On May 4, 2000, the Head of the Non-Revenue
Water Reduction Department of the Manila Water Services,
Inc. (MWSI) received a report from an Inspectorate and Special
Projects team that the Mico Car Wash (MICO), owned by
Alfredo Rap Alejandro, has been illegally opening an MWSI
fire hydrant and using it to operate its car-wash business in
Binondo, Manila.
On May 10, 2000, the MWSI, in coordination with the
PNP-CIDG, conducted an anti-water pilferage operation
against MICO.
The PNP.CIDG discovered that MICO's car-wash boys
indeed had been illegally getting water from an MWSI fire
hydrant. The PNP.CIDG arrested the car-wash boys and
confiscated the containers used in getting water. At this point,
the petitioner Franklin Alejandro, Alfredo's father and the
Barangay Chairman or punong barangay of Barangay 293,
Zone 28, Binondo, Manila, interfered with the PNP-CIDG's
operation by ordering several men to unload the confiscated
containers. This intervention caused further commotion and
created an opportunity for the apprehended car-wash boys to
escape.
Ruling: At the outset, we point out that the maintenance
of peace and order is a function of both the police and the
Barangay Chairman, but crime prevention is largely a police
matter. At the time when the police officers were hauling
the confiscated equipment, they were creating a commotion.
As Barangay Chairman, the petitioner was clearly in the
performance of his official duty when he interfered. Under
Section 389(b)(3) of RA 7160, the law provides that a punong

666

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

barangay must "maintain public order in the barangay and, in
pursuance thereof, assist the city or municipal mayor and the
sanggunian members in the performance of their duties and
functions." The PNP.CIDG's anti-water pilferage operation
against the car-wash boys was affecting the peace and order of
the community and he was duty-bound to investigate and try
to maintain public order.
After the petitioner introduced himself and inquired about
the operation, the police officers immediately showed their
identifications and explained to him that they were conducting
an anti-water pilferage operation. However, instead of assisting
the PNP-CIDG, he actually ordered several bystanders to defy
the PNP-CIDG's whole operation. The petitioner's act stirred
further commotion that unfortunately led to the escape of the
apprehended car-wash boys.
Examined side by side, police authority is superior to
the punong barangay's authority in a situation where the
maintenance of peace and order has metamorphosed into crime
prevention and the arrest of criminal offenders.
In this case, a criminal act was actually taking place and
the situation was already beyond the general maintenance
of peace and order. The police was, at that point, under the
obligation to prevent the commission of a crime and to effect
the arrest, as it actually did, of criminal offenders.
Sufficient records exist to justify the imposition of a higher
penalty against the petitioner. His open interference in a
legitimate police activity. and defiance of the police's authority
only show his clear intent to violate the law; in fact, he reneged
on his first obligation as the grassroot official tasked at the first
level with the enforcement of the law.
What we can conclusively confirm is that the petitioner
violated the law by directly interfering with a legitimate police
activity where his own son appeared to be involved. This act
qualifies the misconduct as grave. Section 52(A)(3), Rule IV
of the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the
Civil Service provides that the penalty for grave misconduct is
dismissal from the service.
We hereby DENY the petition for lack of merit. Alejandro's
dismissal is affirmed.

The Barangay Protection Order (BPO) issued by the
Punong Barangay or, in his unavailability, by any available
Barangay Kagawad, merely orders the perpetrator to desist from (a)
causing physical harm to the woman or her child; and (2) threatening
to cause the woman or her child physical harm. Such function of the
Punong Barangay is, thus, purely executive in nature, in pursuance
of his duty under the Local Government Code to "enforce all laws
and ordinances," and to "maintain public order in the barangay."
GARCIA v. DRILON
G.R. No. 179267, June 25, 2013, Perlas-Bernabe, J.
Facts: On March 8, 2004, after nine (9) years of spirited
advocacy by women's groups, Congress enacted Republic Act
(R.A.) No. 9262, entitled "An Act Defining Violence Against
Women and Their Children, Providing for Protective Measures
for Victims, Prescribing Penalties Therefor, and for Other
Purposes." It took effect on March 27, 2004.
R.A. 9262 is a landmark legislation that defines and
criminalizes acts of violence against women and their children
(VAWC) perpetrated by women's intimate partners, i.e,
husband; former husband; or any person who has or had a
sexual or dating relationship, or with whom the woman has a
common child. The law provides for protection orders from the
barangay and the courts to prevent the commission of further
acts of VAWC; and outlines the duties and responsibilities
of barangay officials, law enforcers, prosecutors and court
personnel, social workers, health care providers, and other local
government officials in responding to complaints of VAWC or
requests for assistance.
A husband is now before the Court assailing the
constitutionality of R.A. 9262 as being violative of the equal
protection and due process clauses, and an undue delegation of
judicial power to barangay officials.
Ruling: Petitioner contends that protection orders involve
the exercise of judicial power which, under the Constitution, is
placed upon the "Supreme Court and such other lower courts as
may be established by law" and, thus, protests the delegation
of power to barangay officials to issue protection orders. The
pertinent provision reads, as follows:
SEC. 14. Barangay Protection Orders (BPOs); Who
May Issue and How. - Barangay Protection Orders

668

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

(BPOs) refer to the protection order issued by the
Punong Barangay ordering the perpetrator to desist from
committing acts under Section 5 (a) and (b) of this Act.
A Punong Barangay who receives applications for a BPO
shall issue the protection order to the applicant on the
date of filing after ex parte determination of the basis of
the application. If the Punong Barangay is unavailable to
act on the application for a BPO, the application shall be
acted upon by any available Barangay Kagawad. If the
BPO is issued by a Barangay Kagawad, the order must be
accompanied by an attestation by the Barangay Kagawad
that the Punong Barangay was unavailable at the time of
the issuance of the BPO. BPOs shall be effective for fifteen
(15) days. Immediately after the issuance of an ex parte
BPO, the Punong Barangay or Barangay Kagawad shall
personally serve a copy of the same on the respondent, or
direct any barangay official to effect its personal service.
The parties may be accompanied by a non-lawyer advocate
in any proceeding before the Punong Barangay.
As clearly delimited by the aforequoted provision, the BPO
issued by the Punong Barangay or, in his unavailability, by any
available Barangay Kagawad, merely orders the perpetrator to
desist from (a) causing physical harm to the woman or her child;
and (2) threatening to cause the woman or her child physical
harm. Such function of the Punong Barangay is, thus, purely
executive in nature, in pursuance of his duty under the Local
Government Code to "enforce all laws and ordinances," and to
"maintain public order in the barangay" (Sec. 389, LGC).
We have held that "(t)he mere fact that an officer is
required by law to inquire into the existence of certain facts
and to apply the law thereto in order to determine what his
official conduct shall be and the fact that these acts may affect
private rights do not constitute an exercise of judicial powers."
In the same manner as the public prosecutor ascertains
through a preliminary inquiry or proceeding "whether there is
reasonable ground to believe that an offense has been committed
and the accused is probably guilty thereof," the Punong
Barangay must determine reasonable ground to believe that
an imminent danger of violence against the woman and her
children exists or is about to recur that would necessitate the
issuance of a BPO. The preliminary investigation conducted

669

by the prosecutor is, concededly, an executive, not a judicial,
function. The same holds true with the issuance of a BPO.
Petition is DENIED for lack of merit.

The complete destruction of the basketball ring by the
petitioners barangay officials is justified neither by law or ordinance
nor even by equity or necessity, which makes the act illegal and
petitioners liable. And even as an action to maintain public order, it
was done excessively and was unjustified.

CRUZ v. PANDACAN HIKER'S CLUB, INC.
778 SCRA 385, January 11, 2016, Peralta, J.

Facts: Petitioner Natividad C. Cruz (Cruz) was Punong
Barangay or Chairperson of Barangay 848, Zone 92, City of
Manila. On November 10, 2006, around five o'clock in the
afternoon, and along Central Street, Pandacan, Manila, within
the vicinity of her barangay, she allegedly confronted persons
playing basketball with the following statements:
Bakit nakabukas ang (basketball) court? Wala
kayong karapatang maglaro sa court na 'to, barangay
namin ito! xx rxx xx Wala kayong magagawa. Ako ang
chairman dito. Mga walanghiya kayo, patay gutom! Hindi
ako natatakot! Kaya kong panagutan lahat!
Then, she allegedly gave an order to the other petitioner,
Barangay Tanod Benjamin dela Cruz (Dela Cruz), to destroy
the basketball ring by cutting it up with a hacksaw which
Dela Cruz promptly complied with, thus, rendering the said
basketball court unusable.
The acts of petitioners prompted the filing of a Complaint
(for Malicious Mischief, Grave Misconduct, Conduct Prejudicial
to the Best Interest of the Service and Abuse of Authority)
before the Prosecutor's Office and the Office of the Ombudsman
by the group that claims to be the basketball court's owners
herein respondents Pandacan Hiker's Club, Inc. (PHC) and its
president Priscila Ilao (Ilao).

Ruling: We agree with the appellate court that the
petitioners' actions, though well-intentioned, were improper
and done in excess of what was required by the situation and
fell short of the aforementioned standards of behavior for
public officials.

670

Book III - Local Government Units
Title One The Barangay

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

It is clear from the records that petitioners indeed cut or
sawed in half the subject basketball ring, which resulted in the
destruction of the said equipment and rendered it completely
unusable. Petitioners also moved instantaneously and did not
deliberate nor consult with the Sangguniang Barangay prior to
committing the subject acts; neither did they involve any police
or law enforcement agent in their actions. They acted while
tempers were running high as petitioner Cruz, the Barangay
Chairperson, became incensed at the removal of the steel bar
and padlock that was earlier used to close access to the ring
and at the inability or refusal of respondents' group to return
the said steel bar and padlock to her as she had ordered.
Clearly, the complete destruction of the basketball ring by
the petitioners barangay officials is justified neither by law or
ordinance nor even by equity or necessity, which makes the act
illegal and petitioners liable. And even as an action to maintain
public order, it was done excessively and was unjustified. Where
a less damaging action, such as the mere padlocking, removal
or confiscation of the ring would have sufficed, petitioners
resorted to the drastic measure of completely destroying and
rendering as unusable the said ring, which was a private
property, without due process. Such an act went beyond what
the law required and, in being so, it tarnished the image and
integrity of the offices held by petitioners and diminished the
public's confidence in the legal system.
The petition is DENIED. The Court of Appeals Decision
finding petitioner liable for conduct prejudicial to the best
interest of the service and penalizing her with suspension of 6
months and 1 day is Affirmed.

Article 213(2) of the RPC injunction against the "payment

against "receiving ... objects of a nature different from that provided

no collection of any object is ever allowed.
REYNES v. OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN
G.R. No. 223405, February 20, 2019, Leonen, J.
Facts: In an Affidavit-Complaint, Carlos Reynes
alleged that Barangay Captain Lucresia Amores of Barangay
Marigondon, Lapu-Lapu City collected increased monthly
garbage collection fees amounting to P2,000.00, even without

671

any ordinance or statute, or any other regulation authorizing
its collection, and despite the City of Lapu-Lapu already
collecting its own garbage fees.
In dismissing the charge of illegal exactions as penalized
under Article 213(2) of the Revised Penal Code, Atty. Mernado
of the Office of the Ombudsman gave a one (1)-paragraph
explanation:

.J

t

I

<

Complainant failed to present the Ordinance on garbage
fees. Thus, there is lack of evidence that respondent Amores
demanded payment of sums different from or larger than
that authorized by law. The payment complainant made to
Barangay Marigondon appeared to be a donation as reflected
in the Official Receipt issued. Complainant did not bother to
question why the payments he made were reflected in the
Official Receipt as donations. Also, complainant failed to
show any proof that the donation he gave to the barangay is
prohibited by law.
Ruling: As punong barangay, private respondent Amores
was chief executive of a local government unit. She was head
of Barangay Marigondon, administered it, and oversaw the
discharge of all its functions. She was tasked with "[e)nforc[ing)
all laws and ordinances which are applicable within the
barangay[;] [m]aintain[ing] public order[;) [and) [p)romot[ing)
the general welfare of the barangay[.)" More on point, it was
her duty to "[e]nforce laws and regulations relating to pollution
control and protection of the environment[,) [and] [e]nsure the
delivery of basic services as mandated under Section 17 of
[the Local Government] Code." Among these basic services
are "[s]ervices and facilities related to general hygiene and
sanitation, beautification, and solid waste collection[.)"
Contrary to Atty. Mernado's conclusion, the evidence
sustains a "reasonable belief that private respondent Amores
"[d]emand[ed] ... the payment of sums different from or larger
than those authorized by law."
Atty. Mernado failed to realize that Article 213(2)'s of the
RPC injunction against the "payment of sums different from
or larger than those authorized by law" and against "receiving
... objects of a nature different from that provided by law"
admits of situations when no payment is ever permitted, or no
collection of any object is ever allowed. These situations may

672

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

arise through an explicitly stated legal prohibition, or through
a law's mere silence. In the latter case, the law plainly declines
to name any authorized manner of payment or collection. By
its reticence, it signals that there is no permissible payment
or collection. When the law enables no form whatsoever of
payment or collection, a public officer's demand for payment
of any sum, or insistence on collecting any object, is a legal
breach. It is a punishable violation of Article 213(2).
Respondent Amores violated Art. 213 (2) by her mere
act of demancling payment when there is no ordinance, law or
regulation permitting her to received anything.
The Petition is PARTLY GRAN TED. The assailed
Resolution and Order issued by the Ombudsman (Visayas)
are SET ASIDE insofar as they dismissed the charge against
private respondent Amores for violating Article 213(2) of the
Revised Penal Code. The Ombudsman (Visayas) is clirected
to file before the proper court the necessary information for
violation of Article 213(2) of the Revised Penal Code against.

Decided Case

l.
A resolution of the Barangay Council for soliciting
contributions to buy a statue of the barangay's patron saint and the
use of such fund for said purpose does not violate the Constitution's
provision prohibiting the use of public funds for religious purposes.
GARCES v. ESTENZO
104 SCRA 510, May 25, 1981, Aquino, J.
Facts: On March 23, 1976, the barangay council of
Valencia, Ormoc City adopted Resolution No. 5, "reviving the
traditional socio-religious celebration" every fifth day of April
"of the feast day of Senor San Vicente Ferrer, the patron saint
of Valencia."
The resolution designated the members of nine (9)
committees who would take charge of the festivity and provided
for: (1) the acquisition of the image of San Vicente Ferrer; and
(2) the construction of a waiting shed as the barangay's projects.
Funds for the two (2) projects would be obtained through the
"selling of tickets and cash donations."
On March 26, 1976, the barangay council passed
Resolution No. 6 which specified that Councilman Tomas
Cabatingan, the hermano mayor of the fiesta, would be the
caretaker of the image which would remain in his residence for
one (1) year, and until the election of his successor as chairman
of the next feast day.
Funds were raised by means of solicitations and cash
donations of the barangay residents and those of the neighboring
places of Valencia. The waiting shed was constructed and the
wooden image of San Vicente Ferrer was acquired.
On April 5, 1976, the image was temporarily placed in
the altar of the Catholic church of Barangay Valencia so that

Held: The contention of the petitioners is that the
resolutions contravene the constitutional provisions that "no
law shall be made respecting an establishment of religion" and
that "no public money or property shall ever be appropriated,
applied, paid, or used, directly or indirectly, for the use,
benefit, or support of any sect, church, denomination, sectarian
institution. x x x (Sec. 8, Article IV and Sec. 18(2/, Article VIII,

Constitution.)
That contention is glaringly devoid of merit. The
questioned resolutions do not directly or indirectly establish
any religion, nor abridge religious liberty, nor appropriate
public money or property for the benefit of any sect, priest or
clergyman. The image was purchased with private funds, not
with tax money. The construction of a waiting shed is entirely
a secular matter.
The wooden image was purchased in connection with the
celebration of the barrio fiesta honoring the patron saint, San
Vicente Ferrer, and not for the purpose of favoring any religion
nor interfering with religious matters or the religious beliefs of
the barrio residents. One of the highlights of the fiesta was the
mass. Consequently, the image of the patron' saint had to be
placed in the church when the mass was celebrated.
If there is nothing unconstitutional or illegal in holding
a fiesta and having a patron saint for the barrio, then any
activity intended to facilitate the worship of the patron saint
(such as the acquisition and display of his image) cannot be
branded as illegal.
There can be no question that the image in question
belongs to the barangay council. Father Osmena's claim that it
belongs to his church is wrong. The barangay council, as owner
of the image, has the right to determine who should have
custody thereof.

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

The History of Katarungang Pambarangay

On January 27, 1978, then President Ferdinand E. Marcos
issued P.D. 1293 Creating a Katarungang Pambarangay Commission
to Study the Feasibility of Resolving Disputes at the Barangay Level.
The Commission was composed of the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court as Chairman, and the Secretary of Justice, the
Secretary of National Defense, the Secretary of Local Government
and Community Development, the Secretary of Education and
Culture, the President of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, and
the Director of the U.P. Law Center as members.
Chief Justice Fred Ruiz Castro of the Supreme Court, who
conceived the idea of barangay justice, chaired the meetings of the
Commission. The other members of the Commission were Minister
of Justice Vicente Abad Santos, Minister of National Defense
Juan Ponce Enrile, Minister of Local Government and Community
Development Jose A. Rono, Minister of Education and Culture
Juan L. Manuel, President Marcelo B. Fernan of the IBP and Dean
Froilan M. Bacungan, Director of the U.P. Law Center.
On June 11, 1978, President Marcos issued Presidential Decree
No. 1508 Establishing A System of Amicably Settling Disputes at
the Barangay Level.
On February 10, 1979, the Katarungang Pambarangay Rules
took effect. These Rules governed the establishment, administration,
and operation of the Lupong Tagapayapa and the Pangkat ng
Tagapagkasundo as well as the procedures in settling disputes
among barangay members through mediation, conciliation and
arbitration. On May 12, 1983, B.P. 377, the Local Government Code
of 1983 took effect. Book II, Title One Chapter 9, Sec. 114 of said
1983 Code merely referred to P.D. 1508 as the governing law on
Katarungang Pambarangay.

On October 10, 1991, R.A. 7160, the Local Government Code
of 1991 was signed into law. Chapter 7, Title One, Book III of said
Code provides for the Revised Katarungang Pambarangay Law.
This repealed P.D. 1508 and is now the governing law on
the subject. However, the jurisprudence built thereon may still
be applicable in cases where the provisions, of P.D. 1508 were
reproduced in the 1991 Local Government Code. (Uy v. Contreras,
237 SCRA 167, 1994.)
The present Katarungang Pambarangay Implementing Rules
and Regulations were promulgated by the Department of Justice
and published in pages 3300--3315, Volume 88, No. 22 of the Official
Gazette, June 1, 1992.

THE MUNICIPALITY
CHAPTER 1. - Role and Creation
of the Municipality
SEC. 440. Role of the Municipality.
The
municipality, consisting of a group of barangays,
serves primarily as a general purpose government
for the coordination and delivery of basic, regular
and direct services and effective governance of the
inhabitants within its territorial jurisdiction.
SEC. 441. Manner ofCreation. A municipality
may be created, divided, merge, abolished, or its
boundary substantially altered only by an Act of
Congress and subject to the approval by the majority
of the votes cast in the plebiscite to be conducted
by the COMELEC in the local government unit or
units directly affected. Except as may otherwise
be provided in the said Act, the plebiscite shall be
held within one hundred twenty (120) days from
the date of its effectivity.
SEC. 442. Requisites of Creation.
(a) A
municipality may be created if it has an average
annual income, as certified by the provincial
treasurer, of at least Two million five hundred
thousand pesos (P2,500,000.00) for the last two
(2) consecutive years based on the 1991 constant
prices; a population of at least twenty-five thousand
(25,000) inhabitants as certified by the National
Statistics Office; and a contiguous territory of at
least fifty (50) square kilometers as certified by the
Lands Management Bureau; Provided, That the
creation thereof shall not reduce the land area,
population or income of the original municipality
695

696

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

or municipalities at the time of said creation to
less than the minimum requirements prescribed
herein.
(b) The territorial jurisdiction of a newlycreated municipality shall be properly identified by
metes and bounds. The requirement on land area
shall not apply where the municipality proposed to
be created is composed of one (1) or more islands.
The territory need not be contiguous if it comprises
two (2) or more islands.
(c) The average annual income shall include
the income accruing to the general fund of the
municipality concerned, exclusive of special funds,
transfers and non-accruing income.
(d) Municipalities existing as of the date of
the effectivity of this Code shall continue to exist
and operate as such. Existing municipal districts
organized pursuant to presidential issuances or
Executive Orders and which have their respective
set of elective municipal officials holding office
at the time of the effectivity of this Code shall
henceforth be considered as regular municipalities.

A.

Decided Cases

1.
Section 442(d) of the Local Government Code converted
municipal districts organized pursuant to presidential issuances or
executive orders into regular municipalities. Curative laws, which in
essence are retrospective, and aimed at giving "validity to acts done
that would have been invalid under existing laws, as if existing laws
have been complied with," are validly accepted in this jurisdiction.
MUNICIPALITY OF SAN NARCISO,
QUEZON v. MENDEZ, SR.
239 SCRA II, December 6, 1994, Vitug, J.
Facts: On 20 August 1959, President Carlos P. Garcia,
issued, pursuant to the Revised Administrative Code, as
amended, Executive Order No. 353 creating the municipal
district of San Andres, Quezon, by segregating from the
municipality of San Narciso of the same province, the barrios
of San Andres, Mangero, Alibijaban, Pansoy, Camflora and
Tala along with their respective sitios.

Book III-- Local Government Units
Title Two The Municipality

697

By virtue of Executive Order No. 174, dated 05 October
1965, issued by President Diosdado Macapagal, the municipal
district of San Andres was later officially recognized to have
gained the status ofa fifth class municipality beginning0l July
1963 by operation of Section 2 of Republic Act No. 1515. The
executive order added that "(t)he conversion of this municipal
district into (a) municipality as proposed in House Bill No.
4864 was approved by the House of Representatives."
On 05 June 1989, the Municipality of San Narciso filed
a petition for quo warranto with the RTC of Gumaca, Quezon,
against the officials of the Municipality of San Andres. The
petition sought the declaration of nullity of Executive Order
No. 353 invoking the ruling of this Court in Pelaez v. Auditor

General 15 SCRA 569.
Held: At the present time, all doubts on the dejure standing
of the municipality must be dispelled. Under the Ordinance
(adopted on 16 October 1986) apportioning the seats of the
House of Representatives, appended to the 1987 Constitution,
the Municipality of San Andres has been considered to be one
of the twelve (12) municipalities composing the Third District
of the province of Quezon.
Equally significant is Section 442(d) of the Local
Government Code to the effect that municipal districts
"organized pursuant to presidential issuances or executive
orders and which have their respective sets of elective municipal
officials holding office at the time of the effectivity of (the) Code
shall henceforth be considered as regular municipalities." No
pretension of unconstitutionality per se of Section 442(d) of the
Local Government Code is preferred. It is doubtful whether
such a pretext, even if made, would succeed. The power to
create political subdivisions is a function of the legislature.
Congress did just that when it has incorporated Section 442(d)
in the Code.
Curative laws, which in essence are retrospective, and
aimed at giving "validity to acts done that would have been
invalid under existing laws, as if existing laws have been
complied with," are validly accepted in this jurisdiction, subject
to the usual qualification against impairment of vested rights.
All considered, the de jure status of the Municipality of
San Andres in the province of Quezon must now be conceded.

The municipality of Alicia should benefit from the effects
of Section 442(d) of the Local Government Code, and should be
considered a regular, de jure municipality.
THE MUNICIPALITY OF CANDIJAY, BOHOL v. CA
251 SCRA 530, December 28, 1995, Panganiban, J.
Facts: The lower court's decision, declared "barrio/
barangay Pagahat as within the territorial jurisdiction of the
plaintiff municipality of Candijay, Bohol, therefore, said barrio
forms part and parcel of its territory, therefore, belonging to
said plaintiff municipality," and further permanently enjoined
defendant municipality of Alicia "to respect plaintiffs control,
possession and political supervision of barangay Pagahat and
never to molest, disturb, harass its possession and ownership
over the same barrio."
On appeal, the respondent Court reversed the ruling of
the lower court. Petitioner's motion for reconsideration having
been rejected by the respondent Court, petitioner came to this
Court. After deliberating on the petition, comment and reply,
this Court is not persuaded to grant due course to the petition.
Held: We noted that petitioner commenced its collateral
attack on the juridical personality of respondent municipality
on 19 January 1984 (or some thirty-five years after respondent
municipality first came into existence in 1949) during
the proceedings in the court a quo. It appears that, after
presentation of its evidence, herein petitioner asked the trial
court to bar respondent municipality from presenting its
evidence on the ground that it had no juridical personality.
Petitioner contended that Executive Order No. 265 issued by
President Quirino on September 16, 1949 creating respondent
municipality is null and void ab initio, inasmuch as Section 68
of the Revised Administrative Code, on which said Executive
Order was based, constituted an undue delegation of legislative
powers to the President of the Philippines, and was therefore
declared unconstitutional, per this Court's ruling in Pelaez v.

Auditor General.
Respondent municipality of Alicia was created by virtue
of Executive Order No. 265 in 1949. And various governmental
acts throughout the years all indicate the State's recognition
and acknowledgment of the existence thereof. For instance,

Book III - Local Government Units
Title Two T he Municipality

699

under Administrative Order No. 33 above-mentioned, the
Municipality of Alicia was covered by the 7th Municipal Circuit
Court of Alicia-Mabini for the province of Bohol. Likewise,
under the Ordinance appended to the 1987 Constitution,
the Municipality of Alicia is one of twenty municipalities
comprising the Third District of Bohol.
The Municipality of Alicia should benefit from the effects
of Section 442(d) of the Local Government Code, and should
henceforth be considered as a regular, de jure municipality.

Municipalities created by Executive Orders which are not
judicially annulled may become de
facto Municipal corporations.
The municipalities judicially dissolved in cases such as Pelaez,
San Joaquin, and Malabang, remain inexistent, unless recreated
through specific legislative enactments, as done with the eighteen
(18) municipalities certified by the DILG. Those municipalities
derive their legal personality not from the presidential issuances
or executive orders which originally created them or from Section
442(d), but from the respective legislative statutes which were
enacted to revive them.
CAMID v. OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT
448 SCRA 711, January 17, 2005, Tinga, J.
Facts: The factual antecedents derive from the
promulgation of our ruling in Pelaez u. Auditor General in 1965.
As discussed therein, then President Diosdado Macapagal
issued several Executive Orders creating thirty-three (33)
municipalities in Mindanao. Among them was Andong in
Lanao de! Sur which was created by virtue of Executive Order
No. 107.
The Court unanimously held that the challenged
Executive Orders were null and void. Nevertheless, the core
issue presented in the present petition is the continued efficacy
of the judicial annulment of the Municipality of Andong.
Petitioner Sultan Osop B. Camid (Camid) represents
himselfas a current resident ofAndong, suing as a private citizen
and taxpayer whose locus standi "is of public and paramount
interest especially to the people of the Municipality of Andong,
Lanao de! Sur." He alleges that Andong "has metamorphosed
into a full-blown municipality with a complete set of officials

700

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

appointed to handle essential services for the municipality and
its constituents," even though he concedes that since 1968, no
person has been appointed, elected or qualified to serve any of
the elective local government positions of Andong.
Ruling: From this survey of relevant jurisprudence, we can
gather the applicable rules. Pelaez and its offspring cases ruled
that the President has no power to create municipalities, yet
limited its nullificatory effects to the particular municipalities
challenged in actual cases before this Court. However, with
the promulgation of the Local Government Code in 1991, the
legal cloud was lifted over the municipalities similarly created
by executive order but not judicially annulled. The de facto
status of such municipalities as San Andres, Quezon; Alicia,
Bohol; and Sinacaban, Misamis Occidental was recognized
by this Court, and Section 442(b) of the Local Government
Code deemed curative whatever legal defects to title these
municipalities had labored under.
Is Andong similarly entitled to recognition as a de facto
municipal corporation? It is not. There are eminent differences
between Andong and municipalities such as San Andres,
Alicia and Sinacaban. Most prominent is the fact that the
executive order creating Andong was expressly annulled by
order of this Court in 1965. If we were to affirm Andong's de
facto status by reason of its alleged continued existence despite
its nullification, we would in effect be condoning defiance of a
valid order of this Court.
We thus assert the proper purview to Section 442(d) of
the Local Government Code-that it does not serve to affirm
or reconstitute the judicially dissolved municipalities such as
Andong, which had been previously created by presidential
issuances or executive orders. The provision affirms the legal
personalities only of those municipalities such as San Narciso,
Alicia, and Sinacaban, which may have been created using the
same infirm legal basis, yet were fortunate enough not to have
been judicially annulled. On the other hand, the municipalities
judicially dissolved in cases such as Pelaez, San Joaquin,
and Malabang, remain inexistent, unless recreated through
specific legislative enactments, as done with the eighteen (18)
municipalities certified by the DILG. Those municipalities
derive their legal personality not from the presidential

Book III Local Government Units
Title Two The Municipality

701

issuances or executive orders which originally created them or
from Section 442(d), but from the respective legislative statutes
which were enacted to revive them.
The Petition is DISMISSED.
CHAPTER 2. Municipal Officials in General
SEC.
443.
Officials of the Municipal
Government.
(a) There shall be in each
municipality a municipal mayor, a municipal vicemayor, sangguniang bayan members, a secretary
to the sangguniang bayan, a municipal treasurer,
a municipal assessor, a municipal accountant, a
municipal budget officer, a municipal planning and
development coordinator, a municipal engineer/
building official, a municipal health officer and a
municipal civil registrar.
(b) In addition thereto, the mayor may
appoint a municipal administrator, a municipal
legal officer, a municipal agriculturist, a municipal
environment and natural resources officer, a
municipal social welfare and development officer,
a municipal architect, and a municipal information
officer.
(c)

The sangguniang bayan may:

(1) Maintain existing offices not mentioned in subsections (a) and (b) hereof;
(2) Create such other offices as may be
necessary to carry out the purposes of the
municipal government; or
(3) Consolidate the functions of any
office with those of another in the interest of
efficiency and economy.
(d) Unless otherwise provided herein, heads
of departments and offices shall be appointed
by the municipal mayor with the concurrence
of the majority of all the sangguniang bayan
members, subject to the civil service law, rules and
regulations. The sangguniang bayan shall act on

702

the appointment within fifteen (15) days from the
date of its submission; otherwise, the same shall be
deemed confirmed.

A municipal corporation is generally given by its charter the
power to remove any of its officers from his office; however, even
if the charter does not expressly confer upon it this power, the
municipal corporation has an implied power of removal unless the
charter definitely takes it away from the corporation. The power of
removal is the power to remove any municipal officer from his office,
exercised by the corporation itself through its governing body, which
power is one of the common-law incidents to the idea of incorporation,
and the same power may be exercised by the council or governing
body of the municipal corporation for a just cause having immediate
relation with the official functions of the officer; but as to offenses
having no such relation but which render the officer infamous and
unfit for any office, they must first be judicially established before
the corporation may remove the offending officer. (Ibid.)

(e) Elective and appointive municipal officials
shall receive such compensation, allowances and
other emoluments as may be determined by law
or ordinance, subject to the budgetary limitations
on personal services as prescribed in Title Five,
Book Two of this Code: Provided, That no increase
in compensation of the mayor, vice-mayor, and
sangguniang bayan members shall take effect
until after the expiration of the full term of all the
elective local officials approving such increase.
A.

703

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Comments

1.
A municipal officer is one who holds a position of trust in
the municipal government, with definite municipal powers, duties,
and privileges, the performances and exercise of which involves
the use of discretion. His office is created by a statute or ordinance,
he receives his salary from the municipal funds, and subject to
the municipal obligations and discipline. A municipal employee is
one who discharges municipal duties of a ministerial character or
performs his functions under the direction of a superior. Business
agents are persons who manage business activities undertaken by
municipalities for profit or for the accommodation of their citizens,
as distinguished from public officers. (Sinco, Philippine Political
Law[J962],pp. 713-717.)
The state legislature only has the inherent power to create
municipal offices, not municipal corporations unless it is granted by
law either expressly or by necessary implications, but the creation
of an office by the municipal corporations may be effected only by
ordinance not by resolution. The power to create an office carries
with it the power to abolish it unless the contrary is provided in
the statute. The absolute repeal of a municipal charter abolishes
all municipal positions, but an office created by statute may not be
abolished by an ordinance unless there is an authority to that effect.
The Civil Service law does not preclude the abolition of an office
by the municipal corporations when done in good faith and not to
conceal the discharge of the incumbent in violation of Civil Service
Rules, but the intention to abolish must, however, be clear. (Ibid.)

The municipal council or board is the governing body
of a municipal corporation, possessing both legislative and
administrative functions, through which a municipal corporation
acts and which takes charge of its corporate affairs. Its functions are
said to be legally performed by it when its members come together
and arrive at a decision in a meeting duly convened, but they are
devoid of any legal effect if performed or determined by individual
action of its members acting separately in different places and not
called together in a meeting. The minutes of the council or board
have the same probative force as other public records, which may
not be corrected by succeeding councils or boards; but corporate acts
may be proved by other competent evidence, it being said that rights
are not to be prejudiced by corporate records which might have been
carelessly kept. (Ibid.)
Majority of the council or board constitutes a quorum, and for
the passage of any ordinance Philippine law requires a majority of all
the council or board members in regularly organized municipalities,
which same requirement holds for the passage of resolutions creating
any indebtedness on the part of the municipality; but for all other
resolutions, a majority of those present is sufficient. (Ibid.)
A municipal officer, as a general rule, is disqualified to enter
into any municipal contract or transaction with the municipality in
which he has a financial interest, direct or indirect, for on account of
his occupying a position of trust and confidence his action is subject
to the rule which renders voidable a transaction of an agent with
himself, or in which he has an interest adverse to the principal, the

704

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

prohibition having for its aim the prevention of any case of collusion,
fraud or undue influence in the award of municipal contracts or
privileges. (Ibid.)
B.

Decided Cases

1.
Under Section 443(a) and (d), LGC the head of a
department or office in the municipal government, such as the
Municipal Budget Officer, shall be appointed by the mayor with
the concurrence of the majority of all Sangguniang Bayan members
subject to civil service law, rules and regulations. Per records, the
appointment of petitioner was never submitted to the Sangguniang
Bayan for its concurrence or, even if so submitted, no such
concurrence was obtained. Verbal concurrence is not allowed.
MONTUERTO v. TY
567 SCRA 670, October 6, 2008, Nachura, J.
Facts: On March 17, 1992, petitioner was issued an
appointment as Municipal Budget Officer by the then Mayor
Supremo T. Sabitsana of the Municipality of Almeria, Biliran.
On March 24, 1992, her appointment was approved as
permanent by Gerardo Corder, Acting Civil Service Commission
Field Officer.
On January 14, 2002, the Sangguniang Bayan of Almeria,
Biliran passed Sangguniang Bayan (SB) Resolution No. 01S-2002 entitled "A Resolution Requesting the Civil Service

Commission Regional Office, to Revoke the Appointment of
Mrs. Melanie P. Montuerto, Municipal Budget Officer of the
Municipality of Almeria, Biliran for Failure to Secure the
Required Concurrence from the Sangguniang Bayan."
Ruling: The law is clear. Under Section 443(a) and
(d) of Republic Act R.A) No. 7160 or the Local Government
Code, the head of a department or office in the municipal
government, such as the Municipal Budget Officer, shall be
appointed by the mayor with the concurrence of the majority
of all Sangguniang Bayan members subject to civil service
law, rules and regulations. Per records, the appointment of
petitioner was never submitted to the Sangguniang Bayan for
its concurrence or, even if so submitted, no such concurrence
was obtained. Such factual finding of quasi-judicial agencies,
especially if adopted and affirmed by the CA, is deemed final

Book III Local Government Units
Title Two -- The Municipality

705

and conclusive and may not be reviewed on appeal by this
Court. This Court is not a trier of facts and generally, does not
weigh anew evidence already passed upon by the CA. Absent
a showing that this case falls under any of the exceptions to
this general rule, this Court will refrain from disturbing the
findings of fact of the tribunals below.
Moreover, we agree with the ruling of the CA that the
verbal concurrence allegedly given by the Sanggunian, as
postulated by the petitioner, is not the concurrence required
and envisioned under R.A. No. 7160. The Sanggunian, as
a body, acts through a resolution or an ordinance. Absent
such resolution of concurrence, the appointment of petitioner
failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of Section
443(a) and (d) of R.A. No. 7160. Without a valid appointment,
petitioner acquired no legal title to the Office of Municipal
Budget Officer, even if she had served as such for ten years.
Accordingly, the CSC has the authority to recall the
appointment of the petitioner.
The instant Petition is DENIED.
2. Section 443 of the LGC provides for the optional position
of the MENRO in the municipality. The provision subjects the
appointment of the MENRO to several conditions. The requirement
for the appropriation ordinance is consistent with the fundamental
principle of fiscal administration enunciated in Section 305 of the
LGC that "[n]o money shall be paid out of the local treasury except
in pursuance of an appropriations ordinance or law."
CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION v. UNDA
839 SCRA 569, September 13, 2017, Bersamin, J.
Facts: Outgoing Mayor Aminullah D. Arimao of the
Municipality of Masiu, Lanao de) Norte had appointed
respondent Samad M. Unda as the Municipal Environmental
and Natural Resources Officer (MENRO) for the Municipality
of Masiu, Lanao Del Sur on March 8, 2007. After the 2007 local
elections, petitioner Nasser P. Pangandaman, Jr. assumed
office as the newly-elected Municipal Mayor of Masiu. He
soon discovered that the local government unit (LGU) had not
enacted any annual budget for the years 2006 and 2007, and had
operated on the basis of the reenacted 2005 annual budget; and

706

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

that nine municipal employees, including the respondent, had
been midnight appointees whose appointments had been based
on a non-existing budget. Inasmuch as said appointees were not
reporting to work, Mayor Pangandaman ordered their salaries
withheld. Later on, he filed a petition for the annulment of
the appointments by the Civil Service Commission (CSC), and
the case was referred to the CSC Regional Office-Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao (CSCRO-ARMM).
Ruling: Pursuant to Section 443, LGC there ought to
be no question that the appointment of the respondent as the
MENRO was but optional on the part of the Municipality of
Masiu, and that such appointment required the concurrence
of the Sangguniang Bayan, as well as the adoption of the
appropriation ordinance to fund the payment of his salaries
and other emoluments.
Section 443 of the LGC expressly includes the position of
the MENRO in the municipality. Nonetheless, the provision
subjects the appointment of the MENRO to several conditions,
namely: (1) the concurrence by the majority of the sangguniang
bayan as provided in its paragraph (d); and (2) the adoption
of an ordinance setting the compensation, allowances and
other emoluments conformably with its paragraph (e). The
requirement for the appropriation ordinance is consistent with
the fundamental principle of fiscal administration enunciated
in Section 305 of the LGC that "[n]o money shall be paid out
of the local treasury except in pursuance of an appropriations
ordinance or law."
The fact that the Sangguniang Bayan of Masiu had no
appropriation ordinances for the years 2006 and 2007 relative
to the position of the MENRO belied the respondent's claim.
His reliance on Resolution No. 29 dated October 24, 2005 did
not suffice. Under Section 306(b) of the LGC, an appropriation
is defined as the "authorization made by ordinance, directing
the payment of goods and services from local government
funds under specified conditions or for specific purposes." Also,
Section 305 and Section 443(d) of the LGC specifically refer
to an ordinance, not to a resolution. Thus, the appropriation
for the office of the MENRO could have only been through an
ordinance. The adoption of Resolution No. 29 dated October 24,
2005 was inherently inadequate for the purpose.

Book III
Local Government Units
Title Two The Municipality

707

With the respondent's appointment as the MENRO having
been rendered ineffective by the lack of the appropriation
ordinance, he was nonetheless a de facto officer whose acts
were as valid as those performed by a de jure officer. A de facto
officer is one who is in possession of an office, and is discharging
his duties under color of authority, by which is meant authority
derived from an appointment, however irregular or informal,
so that the incumbent is not a mere volunteer. Consequently,
where there is no de jure officer, a de facto officer who, in good
faith, has possession of the office and discharges the duties
pertaining thereto, is legally entitled to the emoluments of the
office, and may in an appropriate action recover the salary, fees
and other compensations attached to the office.
The Court GRANTS the petition for review on certiorari
and reverses the CA ruling declaring U ndas appointment valid.

Macandile, being the sister of Mayor Dator, is clearly
within the scope of the prohibition against nepotism from being hired
under a contract of services and job order as Chief Administrative
Officer and then designated as Municipal Administrator.
DATOR v. MORALES
G.R. No. 237742, October 8, 2018, Tijam, J.
Facts: The case stemmed from a complaint filed on
May 2, 2016 by complainant Moises B. Villasenor against the
incumbent Mayor of Lucban, Quezon, petitioner Celso Olivier
T. Dator, and Maria Lyncelle D. Macandile, also of Lucban,
Quezon for grave misconduct, grave abuse of authority and
nepotism.
It was alleged that in his immediately preceding term,
Dator hired his sister, Macandile, as Chief Administrative
Officer through a Job Order and designated her as Municipal
Administrator through Special Order (S.O.) No. 2, Series of
2014, dated March 1, 2014. There was no appointment paper
that was submitted to the Sangguniang Bayan for the required
confirmation pursuant to Sec. 443(d) of the Local Government
Code (LGC).
It was also alleged that Macandile lacked the
qualifications of a Municipal Administrator and her Job Order
stated that "the above-named hereby attests that he/she is not

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Book III Local Government Units
Title Two The Municipality

709

related within the third degree (fourth degree in case of LGUs)
of consanguinity or affinity to the 1) hiring authority and/or 2)
representatives of the hiring agency" when in truth and in fact
she is the sister of Dator.
"

We agree with the 0MB that Macandile's designation
as Chief Administrative Officer was irregular as it was in
clear violation of CSC Resolution No. 020790. Dator was thus
properly held liable for simple misconduct.

Ruling: The position of a Municipal Administrator is
unique, because, while it is coterminous with the appointing
authority and highly confidential in character, it is required
that the appointee must meet the qualifications enumerated
under Sec. 480 of the LGC. The position does not fall within
the confidential/personal staff contemplated under Section 1(e)
Rule X of CSC MC No. 40, series of 1998 (Revised Omnibus
Rules on Appointments and Other Personnel Actions which
dispenses with the eligibility and experience requirements.

The Ombudsman's Decision is hereby AFFIRMED in so
far as it finds petitioner Celso Olivier T. Dator GUILTY of
SIMPLE MISCONDUCT, with modification that the petitioner
is meted with the penalty of ONE MONTH and ONE DAY
SUSPENSION.

CSC Resolution No. 020790 clearly states the prohibition
of hiring those covered under the rules on nepotism through a
contract of service and job order:
Section 4. Prohibitions --The following are prohibited
from being hired under a contract of services and job
order.
a.
Those who have been previously dismissed
from the service due to commission of an administrative
offense;
b.
Those who are covered under the rules on
nepotism;
c.
Those who are being hired to perform functions
pertaining to vacant regular plantilla positions;
d.
Those who have reached the compulsory
retirement age except as to consultancy services.
Nepotism is defined as an appointment issued in favor
of a relative within the third civil degree of consanguinity or
affinity of any of the following: (d) appointing authority; (2)
recommending authority; (3) chief of the bureau or office; and
(4) person exercising immediate supervision over the appointee.
Macandile, being the sister of Mayor Dator, is clearly
within the scope of the prohibition from being hired under a
contract of services and job order.

UNITED DUMANGAS PORT DEVELOPMENT
CORPORATION v. PHILIPPINE PORTS AUTHORITY
766 SCRA 373, August 12, 2015, Peralta, J.
Facts: On December 1, 2000, respondent Philippine
Ports Authority granted petitioner United Dumangas Port
Development Corporation (UDPDC) a permit to operate the
cargo handling services at the Port of valid for one (1) year.
Thereafter, PPA issued UDPDC several holders authorities to
continue its services thereon. On May 28, 2003, PPA granted
UDPDC a three (3)-month extension from June 1, 2003 to
August 31, 2003. UDPDC, however, continued its operations
even after the extension. Meanwhile, on July 14, 2005, PPA
conducted a public bidding for the cargo handling services at
the port wherein UDPDC did not participate despite notice.
When the winning bidder was selected, the losing bidder filed
an action, docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 92950, to set aside the
result of the public bidding.
On November 18, 2005, UDPDC filed before the RTC
of Dumangas, Iloilo, an Amended Petition for Certiorari and
Prohibition with Prayer for the Issuance of TRO and Writ of
Preliminary Injunction challenging the PPA Memorandum
Order No. 43-2005 and seeking an injunction against its
implementation, docketed as Special Civil Action Case No. 05024.
On March 27, 2006, UDPDC moved for the reconsideration
of the dismissal of its petition. Thereafter, on March 29, 2006,
the Municipality of Dumangas (MOD) filed a Petition-inIntervention pursuant to a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
providing for the devolution of port management functions
from the PPA to the LGUs concerned.
On March 4, 2009, PPA and the Municipality of
Dumangas submitted a Compromise Agreement they executed
on December 3, 2008.
In its Decision dated December 4, 2009, the CA upheld
the validity of the Compromise Agreement.

712

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Ruling: The petition is partly meritorious. A perusal of
the provisions of the Compromise Agreement, as well as the
circumstances surrounding its execution, negates its validity.
The resolutions purportedly authorizing Municipal
Mayor Golez to enter into the Compromise Agreement still
cannot be given credence. Under Section 444(b)0)(vi) of the
LGC, the municipal mayor may represent the municipality in
all its business transactions and sign, on its behalf, contracts
and obligations made pursuant to law or ordinance. However,
a mere resolution, such as those issued by the Sangguniang
Bayan herein, does not suffice to approve PPA's claim of
Php 111,930,282.28 against MOD for no rights can be conferred
by and be inferred from a resolution, which is nothing but an
embodiment of what the law-making body has to say in the
light of attendant circumstances. Contrary to the appellate
court's stance, that Mayor Golez was elected by the people of
MOD does not excuse him from acting within the parameters
set by law. Thus, while it is true that compromise agreements
between the parties in civil cases are not only allowed but even
encouraged, in order for them to be binding on the parties,
however, they must be executed in accordance with applicable
law and jurisprudence.
On this score, alone, the Compromise Agreement must
be nullified for being entered into without complying with the
provisions of law. Yet, a substantial reading of the same further
demands its nullification as its terms are highly irregular and
manifestly disadvantageous to the MOD. It bears stressing
that under the Compromise Agreement, the Municipality of
Dumangas suddenly became indebted to PPA for the costs
of improvements it allegedly introduced on the port in the
amount of Php 111,930,282.28. This obligation to reimburse
PPA, however, was never asserted throughout the proceedings,
not even on PPA's appeal to the CA. Neither was there any
evidence submitted to substantiate the claim.
Premises considered, the instant petition is PARTLY
GRAN TED.

ROBLE ARRASTRE, INC. v. VILLAF LOR
499 SCRA 434, August 22, 2006, Chico-Nazario, J.
Facts: Petitioner Roble Arrastre, Inc. is a cargo handling
service operator, authorized by the Philippine Ports Authority
through Permit No. M92-005 to provide and render arrastre
and stevedoring services at the Municipal Port of Hilongos,
Leyte, and on all vessels berthed thereat, from 7 September
1992 to 15 September 1993. For the years 1992 and 1993,

718

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

petitioner was granted Business Permits No. 349 and No. 276,
respectively, by respondent Altagracia Villaflor as Municipal
Mayor of Hilongos, Leyte.
On 14 December 1993, pending final consideration of
petitioner's application for renewal with the PPA Office,
Manila, the PPA through its Port Manager Salvador L. Reyna
of the Tacloban Port Management Office issued a 90-day holdover authority to petitioner. Stated therein was the proviso
that notwithstanding the 90-day period aforementioned, the
authority shall be deemed ipso facto revoked if an earlier
permit/contract for cargo handling services is granted or
sooner withdrawn or cancelled for cause pursuant to PPA
Administrative Order No. 10-81. On 27 January 1994, while
the 90-day hold-over authority was in effect, petitioner filed
with respondent mayor an application for the renewal of its
Business Permit No. 276. However, the same was denied.
Aggrieved by the denial, petitioner filed with the RTC, a
Petition for Mandamus with Preliminary Mandatory Injunction
against respondent mayor, raising the primary ground that the
refusal to issue the business license sought for was a neglect to
perform an act which the law enjoins her to do, by virtue of the
office she occupies.
Ruling: We make a determination of the nature of the
power of respondent mayor to grant petitioner a permit to
operate an arrastre service. Central to the resolution of the
case at bar is a reading of Section 444(b)(3)(iv) of the Local
Government Code of 1991.
Section 444(b)(3)(iv) of the Local Government Code of
1991, whereby the power of the respondent mayor to issue
license and permits is circumscribed, is a manifestation of the
delegated police power of a municipal corporation. Necessarily,
the exercise thereof cannot be deemed ministerial. As to the
question of whether the power is validly exercised, the matter
is within the province of a writ of certiorari, but certainly, not
of mandamus.
Petitioner's petition for mandamus is incompetent against
respondent mayor's discretionary power. Thus:
"Discretion," when applied to public functionaries,
means a power or right conferred upon them by law or
acting officially, under certain circumstances, uncontrolled

by the judgment or conscience of others. A purely
ministerial act or duty in contradiction to a discretional
act is one which an officer or tribunal performs in a given
state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to
the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or
the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or
impropriety of the act done. If the law imposes a duty
upon a public officer and gives him the right to decide
how or when the duty shall be performed, such duty is
discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministerial
only when the discharge of the same requires neither the
exercise of official discretion or judgment (sic)
The Petition is DENIED.
2.
The DENR is not the sole government agency vested
with the authority to issue permits relevant to the transportation of
salvaged forest products, considering that, pursuant to the general
welfare clause, LGUs may also exercise such authority. Also, the
permits to transport were meant to complement and not to replace
the Wood Recovery Permit issued by the DENR. In effect, Ruzol
required the issuance of the subject permits under his authority as
municipal mayor and independently of the official functions granted
to the DENR.
RUZOL v. SANDIGANBAYAN
696 SCRA 742, April 17, 2013, Velasco, Jr., J.
Facts: Leovegildo Ruzol was the mayor of General Nakar,
Quezon from 2001 to 2004. Earlier in his term, he organized a
Multi-Sectoral Consultative Assembly composed of civil society
groups, public officials and concerned stakeholders with the
end in view of regulating and monitoring the transportation of
salvaged forest products within the vicinity of General Nakar.
Consequently, from 2001 to 2004, two hundred twentyone (221) permits to transport salvaged forest products were
issued to various recipients, of which forty-three (43) bore the
signature of Ruzol while the remaining one hundred seventyeight (178) were signed by his co-accused GuillermoT. Sabiduria
(Sabiduria), then municipal administrator of General Nakar.
On June 2006, on the basis of the issued Permits to
Transport, 221 Informations for violation of Art. 177 of the
RPC or for Usurpation of Authority or Official Functions were
filed against Ruzol and Sabiduria.

720

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Ruling: The claim of DENR's supposedly exclusive
mandate is easily negated by the principle of local autonomy
enshrined in the 1987 Constitution in relation to the general
welfare clause under Sec. 16 of the LGC of 1991.
The requirement of permits to transport salvaged forest
products from the Municipal Mayor is not a manifestation
of usurpation of DENR's authority but rather an additional
measure which was meant to complement DENR's duty
to regulate and monitor forest resources within the LGU's
territorial jurisdiction.
Ruzol insists that the Permit to Transport partakes
the nature of transport fees levied by the municipality for
the use of public roads. In this regard, he argues that he has
been conferred by law the right to issue subject permits as
an incident to the LGU's power to create its own sources of
revenue pursuant to Secs. 153 and 186 of the LGC:
Ruzol further argued that the permits to transport were
issued under his power and authority as Municipal Mayor
under Sec. 444 of the same law[."]
(iv) Issue licenses and permits and suspend or revoke
the same for any violation of the conditions upon which
said licenses or permits had been issued, pursuant to law or
ordinance;
XXX

vii) Adopt adequate measures to safeguard and conserve
land, mineral, marine, forest, and other resources of the
municipality; provide efficient and effective property and
supply management in the municipality; and protect the funds,
credits, rights and other properties of the municipality.
Ruzol is correct to a point. Nevertheless, We find that an
enabling ordinance is necessary to confer the subject permits
with validity. The power to levy fees or charges under the LGC
is exercised by the Sangguniang Bayan through the enactment
of an appropriate ordinance. It is likewise expressly stated in
Sec. 444(0)(3)(iv) of the LGC that the authority of the municipal
mayor to issue licenses and permits should be "pursuant to a
law or ordinance."
Ruzol's insistence that his actions are pursuant to the
LGU's devolved function to "manage and control communal

Book III Local Government Units
Title Two -The Municipality

721

forests" under Sec. 17 of the LGC and DAO 1992-30 is specious.
As can be gleaned from the same Sec. 17 of the LGC, the LGU's
authority to manage and control communal forests should be
"pursuant to national policies and is subject to supervision,
control and review of DENR."
In the present case, the records are bereft of any
showing that these requirements were complied with. Thus,
in the absence of an established communal forest within the
Municipality of General Nakar, there was no way that the
subject permits to transport were issued as an incident to the
management and control of a communal forest.
This is not to say, however, that compliance with
abovementioned statutory requirements for the issuance of
permits to transport foregoes the necessity of obtaining the
Wood Recovery Permit from the DENR. As earlier discussed,
the permits to transport may be issued to complement, and
not substitute, the Wood Recovery Permit, and may be used
only as an additional measure in the regulation of salvaged
forest products. To elucidate, a person seeking to transport
salvaged forest products still has to acquire a Wood Recovery
Permit from the DENR as a prerequisite before obtaining the
corresponding permit to transport issued by the LGU.
The foregoing notwithstanding, Ruzol cannot be held
guilty of Usurpation of Official Functions as defined and
penalized under Art. 177 of the RPC.
Ruzol required the issuance of the subject permits under
his authority as municipal mayor and independently of the
official functions granted to the D ENR. The records are likewise
bereft of any showing that Ruzol made representations or false
pretenses that said permits could be used in lieu of, or at the
least as an excuse not to obtain, the Wood Recovery Permit
from the DENR.
Accused Leovegildo R. Ruzol is, thus, ACQUITTED on
the basis of reasonable doubt of the crimes as charged.
3. Having failed to apply for and secure the necessary
business permit to operate in 2014 on account of his inability to
obtain the required barangay clearance due to non-compliance with
a requirement standard, Dimson may not legally operate his poultry
farm in the Municipality of Lubao, Pampanga, thereby, warranting
the issuance by Mayor Cayabyab of the COO and the Closure Order.

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

CAYABYAB v. DIMSON
830 SCRA 520, July 10, 2017, Perlas-Bernabe, J.
Facts: Respondent Jaime C. Dimson is the owner of a
poultry farm located in Barangay Prado Siongco, Lubao,
Pampanga (subject poultry farm) which had been operating for
more than 30 years. In January 2014, he applied for a barangay
clearance with the office of petitioner Prado Siongco Barangay
Chairman Angelito L. David, preparatory to his application
for a business permit, and was informed that the issuance
thereof is conditioned on a prior ocular inspection of the subject
poultry farm by the Office of the Mayor of Lubao, Pampanga,
Mayor Cayabyab. However, despite the conduct of an ocular
inspection, Chairman David refused to issue the clearance;
hence, no business permit was issued in favor of Dimson.
On April 29, 2014, Dimson received a CDO dated April 28,
2014 from the Office of Mayor Cayabyab, directing him to desist
from further conducting any poultry farming on the grounds of:
(a) lack of a Barangay Business Permit and a Mayor's Permit;
(b) lack of a pollution control officer; (c) foul odor being emitted
by the subject poultry farm that offended passing motorists,
and for which complaints were filed by those affected.
Ruling: A business permit must be secured from the
municipal business permits and licensing office in order for the
business to legally operate in the locality. While poultry farming
is admittedly a legitimate business, it cannot operate without
a business permit, which expires on the 31st of December of
every year and must be renewed before the end of January of
the following year.
In the present case, there is no showing that Dimson filed
any application for renewal of his business permit to operate
the subject poultry farm in 2014, apparently due to his failure
to secure the necessary barangay clearance which was not
issued based on complaints of foul odor being emitted by the
said farm. Records show that complaints from neighboring
barangays were received by the office of Mayor Cayabyab
bewailing the foul odor coming from the said farm, which was
confirmed upon ocular inspection conducted by the Health and
Sanitation Office of the Municipality of Lubao, Pampanga.
Not having passed the necessary sanitation standard,
there was, therefore, a prima facie valid reason for the

Book III.--- Local Government Units
Title Two T he Municipality

723

withholding of the required barangay clearance, which is a
prerequisite to the renewal of Dimson's business permit to
operate.
Having failed to apply for and secure the necessary
business permit to operate in 2014 on account of his inability to
obtain the required barangay clearance due to non-compliance
with a requirement standard, Dimson may not legally operate
in the Municipality of Lubao, Pampanga, thereby, warranting
the issuance by Mayor Cayabyab of the CDO and the Closure
Order.
The petition is GRANTED.
4.
Petitioner's issuance of the questioned permits proceeds
from his belief, erroneous as it is, that he is authorized under Section
444(b)(3)(iv) of the Local Government Code to issue the same.
VILLAROSA v. PEOPLE
G.R. Nos. 233155-63, June 23, 2020, Peralta, C.J.
Facts: On October 4, 2011 Ruben Soledad the Provincial
Environment and Natural Resources Officer of Occidental
Mindoro filed, before the Office of the Ombudsman, a Complaint
against petitioner Mayor Jose Villarosa of San Jose, Occidental
Mindoro, for Usurpation of Authority, Violation of Section 138
LGC for Grave Abuse of Authority in Office, Grave Misconduct,
Dishonesty, Conduct Prejudicial to the Best Interest of the
Service and Violation of Republic Act No. 6713, the Code of
Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and
Employees.
In his Complaint, Soledad alleged that despite
petitioner's, knowledge that he lacks the requisite authority
to issue extraction permits to quarry operators, petitioner,
nonetheless, proceeded to issue several permits to several
operators who were conducting quarry operations in San Jose.
Under the LGC, extraction permits in a municipality can only
be issued by the Provincial Government.
Ruling: The prosecution alleges that petitioner is guilty
of evident bad faith. However, the Court agrees with petitioner
and finds that there is no sufficient evidence to prove that he
is guilty of evident bad faith the 3 element in Sec. 3(e) of
RA 3019.

724

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Book III- Local Government Units
Title Two The Municipality

First, since he was not furnished copies of the Cease
and Desist Orders (CDOs) nor was he previously notified of
their issuance, petitioner was the one who took initiative in
clarifying the validity of the said CDOs by writing a letter to
Soledad and informing him of his position on the issue and the
legal bases of such position.
Second, from the tenor of his letter to Soledad and the
Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Occidental Mindoro, petitioner
was emphatic in his belief and reasoning, albeit mistakenly,
that, under the Local Government Code he wields authority, as
Municipal Mayor, to issue the questioned permits.
Third, there is no showing that petitioner personally
gained anything by his issuance of the questioned extraction
permits. In fact, it was not disputed that all the pertinent taxes
and fees in the issuance of the said permits were collected and
the respective shares of the Provincial Government and the
barangay were properly remitted and appropriated by them.
In this regard, Justice Marvic Mario Victor F. Leonen, in
his Dissenting Opinion, posits that petitioner's alleged "brazen
act of granting permits without any basis in law gives rise to a
presumption of bad faith" on the part of respondent.

First, petitioner's issuance of the questioned permits
proceeds from his belief, erroneous as it is, that he is authorized
under Section 444 (b)3)(iv) of the Local Government Code to
issue the same. A cursory reading of this provision would readily
show that there is in fact, basis to conclude that respondent, as
municipal mayor, has authority to issue permits and licenses,
although such power is not applicable in the present case.
Hence, it would be inaccurate to say that petitioner's act of
granting permits has no basis, whatsoever in law as to make
petitioner guilty of evident bad faith.

Mayor Pilapil's instrusion and warrantless inspection on

under the said act and executive rule.

PILAPIL, JR. v. CU
G.R. No. 228589, August 27, 2020, Peralta, C.J.
Facts: The Bicol Chromite and Manganese Corporation
(BCMC) is the holder of Mineral Production Sharing Agreement
(MPSA) No. 211-2005-V. The MPSA granted unto BCMC the
right to mine a specific site located in Barangay Himagtocon,
Lagonoy, Camarines Sur.
In 2009, BCMC entered into an Operating Agreement
with Prime Rock Philippines Company (Prime Rock) allowing
the latter to, among others, operate the aforesaid mining site.
However, on January 31, 2011, the Mines and Geosciences
Bureau - Regional Offce 5 (MBG RO5) issued a Cease and
Desist Order (COO) against Prime Rock enjoining the latter
from engaging in any mining activities.
Around six (6) months after the issuance of the COO,
petitioner Delfin R. Pilapil, Jr. (Mayor Pilapil) - then mayor
of the municipality of Lagonoy - received reports about
the existence of an illegal mining operation in Barangay
Himagtocon. Mayor Pilapil supposedly also received reports
that Prime Rock had filed an appeal against the COO. To verify
these reports and to ensure that the COO is not being violated,
petitioner decided to conduct an ocular inspection of the mining
site operated by BCMC and Prime Rock.
Inventory of the seized items yielded 41 sacks of
explosives with an aggregate weight of 1,061 kilos, and 4 1/2
rolls of safety fuses (subject explosives). The subject explosives
were then kept at the Explosive Magazine, Provincial Public
Safety Management Company in Tigaon, Camarines Sur, for
safekeeping.
On August 26, 2011, the Camarines Sur Police Provincial
Office of the Philippine National Police issued a Certification
stating that, as per the records in its office, no permit to
transport or withdraw explosives had been issued to Prime
Rock.
An Information of illegal possession of explosives was
lodged before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Camarines
Sur against certain officers and employees of BCMC and
Prime Rock. Among those accused in the said Information were
respondent Lydia Cu, the president of BCMC, and one Manuel
Ley the president of Prime Rock.

On October 22, 2013, the R'TC issued an Order finding
probable cause to hold Cu, Ley, Go, Loo and Chuntong for trial,
and reinstating the September 28, 2012 warrants of arrest
against them.

described under Section 185 of the RIRR. The second, on the
other hand, may be conducted by a provincial governor or city
mayor, in addition to the regional director of the MGB.
Verily, Mayor Pilapil's intrusion and warrantless
inspection on the mining site operated by BCMC and Prime
Rock find absolutely no justification under the Mining Act
and its RIRR. A municipal mayoron his own and acting by
himself-has no authority to order and conduct any of the
administrative inspections sanctioned under the said act and
executive rule. The illegality of the aforesaid ocular inspection
means that Mayor Pilapil and his team were not in a lawful
position when they were able to view the subject explosives.

Ruling: Section 444(b)3)(iv) of the LGC does not-whether expressly or impliedly-authorize a municipal
mayor to conduct warrantless inspections of mining sites. The
petitioners, in that sense, misconstrued the case of Hon. Lim v
Court of Appeals, 435 Phil. 857 (2002). The Power of a mayor
"to inspect and investigate private commercial establishments
for any violation of the conditions of their [business] licenses
and permits" which was recognized in Lim, could not extend
to searches of mining sites in view of the unique inspection
scheme over such sites established under R.A. No. 7942, or the
Mining Act, and its RIRR.

Since the subject explosives have been unequivocally
seized in violation of the constitutional proscription against
unreasonable searches and seizures, they are properly
regarded by the CA as "fruits of a poisonous tree" subject to
the exclusionary principle set forth in Section 3b), Article Ill
of the Constitution. The subject explosives are inadmissible
and may not be considered as evidence for any purpose in any
proceeding-including as bases for a finding of probable cause
to arrest and detain an accused for trial.

Mining operations in the country are principally
regulated by the Mining Act and its RIRR. As part and parcel
of their regulatory thrust the said act and executive rule
did allow the government-through particular agencies or
officials, for specific purposes and subject to define limitations
or conditions-to enter and conduct inspections in mining sites
and areas. These administrative inspections, duly authorized
and reasonably limited by statute and regulation, are examples
of inspections sanctioned by the State in the exercise of its police
power that, as aforementioned, may be considered as among
the instances of valid warrantless searches.

Without the subject explosives, the indictment for illegal
possession of explosives and, ultimately, the warrant of arrest
against Cu will have no leg to stand on.
The consolidated petitions are DENIED. The Decision
and the Resolution of the Court of Appeals are AFFIRMED.

As they now stand, however, the Mining and Act and its
RIRR do not confer any authority upon a municipal mayor to
conduct any kind of inspection on any mining area or site. Most
of the administrative inspections sanctioned under the Mining
Act and its RIRR fall under the exclusive responsibility of the
MGB
e ither through its Director, one of its regional directors
or an authorized representative of the said officials There are
only two outliers to this norm-the first is the environmental
monitoring and audit of mining sites under Section 174 of the
RIRR, and the second is the inspection of mining permit areas
that are covered by a Quarry, Sand and Gravel, Government
Gratuitous, Guano, or Gemstone Gathering Permit pursuant
to Sections 80(a)(5), 80(b)(6), 87(d) and 94(a) of the same
regulation. The first has to be carried out by an MMT as

OLIVAREZ v. SANDIGANBAYAN
248 SCRA 700, October 4, 1995, Regalado, J.
Facts: On December 15, 1992, Baclaran Credit
Cooperative, Inc. (BCCI, through its board member Roger
de Leon, charged petitioner Paranaque Mayor Dr. Pablo R.
Olivarez with Violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices
Act for unreasonably refusing to issue a mayor's permit despite
request and follow-ups to implement Paranaque Sangguniang
Bayan Resolution No. 744, Series of 1992 which petitioner
himself approved on October 6, 1992.
Resolution No. 744 authorized BCCI to set up a night
manufacturer's fair during the Christmas fiesta celebration
of and at Baclaran for 60 days from November 11, 1992 to
February 15, 1993 for which they will use a portion of the
service road of Roxas Boulevard from the corner of Opena to
Rivera Streets.
Held: We are convinced that there exists probable cause
as to warrant the filing of charges against herein petitioner for
a violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019.
Petitioner's main defense is that BCCI was not issued a
mayor's permit by reason of its failure to apply therefor and
to comply with the conditions set forth in Sangguniang Bayan
Resolution No. 744. There are several flaws to this argument.
First. The purported absence of an application for the
issuance of a permit is actually more apparent than real.
Initially, petitioner claims that he could not grant a permit to
BCCI, which was allegedly demanding an exclusive authority to
operate, on the pretext that he can be held liable for a violation of
Republic Act No. 3019 for giving unwarranted benefits to BCCI
to the detriment of other Baclaran based vendor's associations.
Subsequently, but in the same vein, petitioner tries to justify
the 'issuance of an executive order granting a permit to the
unidentified Baclaran-based vendors' associations, in that
the same did not cause injury to BCCI since the authority to
operate given to the latter is not exclusive.

Book III - Local Government Units
Title Two --- The Municipality

729

It would appear, therefore, that petitioner had taken it
upon himself to categorize and determine the exclusivity or
non-exclusivity of the authority to operate granted to BCCI,
depending on whether or not it would suit his purpose or
predilection.
Second. It is asserted that the executive order granting a
permit to the Baclaran-based vendors' associations was issued by
supposedly in the best interest of the municipality as evidenced
by its earnings from the night fair of Pl3,512,948.00. While the
avowed purpose may prove noble, still it miserably pales in
contrast to what appears to be bad faith or manifest partiality
on the part of petitioner in refusing to grant a permit to BCCI.
Petitioner could not plausibly demonstrate how the issuance of
a permit to BCCI would so adversely affect public interest as
to warrant its denial. On the contrary, the Sangguniang Bayan
of Paranaque had even passed a resolution, which notably was
approved by herein petitioner, expressly allowing BCCI to hold
the night fair. This is concrete proof that the grant of authority
to operate in favor of BCCI was not at all contrary to law and
public policy, nor was it prejudicial to public interest.
Lastly, it may not be amiss to add that petitioner, as a
municipal mayor, is expressly authorized and has the power to
issue permits and licenses for the holding of activities for any
charitable or welfare purpose, pursuant to Section 444(b)(3) (iv
and v) of RA 7160. Hence, he cannot really feign total lack of
authority to act on the letter-application of BCCI.
The petition is DISMISSED.

Decided Case

l.
The summary removal of private complainants' makeshift
homes constructed in their private property by the demolition team
beaded by Brgy. Chairman Simbulan and Capt. Evasco upon the
instruction of Mayor Cuerpo was made in blatant disregard of
private complainants' right to due process and was done without
observance of the applicable laws on demolition.
CUERPO v. PEOPLE
G.R. No. 203382, September 18, 2019, Reyes, J. Jr., J.
Facts: Leticia B. Nanay, et al. are among the ninety-three
(93) families and members of "Samahang Magkakapitbisig
(Samahan), who used to occupy a parcel of land in Barangay
(Brgy.) Valencia, Quezon City as informal settlers. In order to
force them to vacate the property, a case was filed before the
MeTC of Quezon City. But to reach a peaceful resolution of
the case, the parties entered into a "Kasunduan" to the effect
that all the 93 families would voluntarily vacate the property
in exchange for P2,250,000.00 as financial assistance.
On September 2, 2002 in view of Mayor Pedro Cuerpo of
Montalban, Rizal refusal to allow the 93 families to relocate in
Brgy Burgos, Montalban, Rizal, the private complainants filed
a case for Mandamus and Prohibition before the RTC of San
Mateo, Rizal.
On December 23, 2002, with the financial assistance
given to them, the Samahan was able to purchase the piece of
land located in Brgy. Burgos, Rodriguez, Rizal. The sale was
registered with the Registry of Deeds of Marikina City and
TCT No. 436865 was issued to the families. The lot was then
subdivided among the 93 families.
On September 22, 2003, because of the Fifth Alias Writ
of Demolition issued by the MeTC of Quezon City, Branch 355,
in CV Case No. 35-15452, the 93 families including private
complainants were forced to leave Barangay Valencia, Quezon
City; moved to their purchased lot and built temporary shelters
made of lumber and tarpaulin despite the lack of building or
development permit. On even date, Brgy. Capt. Simbulan, upon
the order of Mayor Cuerpo, arrived and asked for their permit.
When they told him they have none, Brgy. Capt. Simbulan

Book III-- Local Government Units
Title Two The Municipality

731

informed them that there will be a demolition that afternoon.
At around 1:30 p.m., a demolition team consisting of Special
Weapons and Tactics and Police Officers led by Capt. Evasco
arrived. The demolition team dismantled the makeshift homes
and took away lumber, tarpaulin, plywood, and appliances.
Private complainants filed a complaint, claiming that
these demolitions were committed with evident bad faith and
manifest partiality, which deprived them of the lawful use of
their land without due process of law or any legal basis or court
order. Consequently, an Information was filed before the Office
of the Ombudsman, where petitioners Pedro Cuerpo, et. al.
were charged of violating Section 3(e) of R.A. No. 3019.
Ruling: Section 10, Article XIII of the 1987 Constitution
provides the Philippine policy on eviction and demolition:
Urban or rural poor dwellers shall not be evicted nor their
dwellings demolished, except in accordance with law and a just
and humane manner.
In accordance with this policy, Section 28, Article VII of
R.A. No. 7279 The Urban Housing and Development Act of
1992, states:
Sec. 28. Eviction and Demolition.
Eviction or
demolition as a practice shall be discouraged. Eviction or
demolition, however, may be allowed under the following
situations:
(a) When persons or entities occupy danger
areas such as esteros, railroad tracks, garbage dumps,
riverbanks, shorelines, waterways, and other public
places such as sidewalks, roads, parks, and playgrounds;
(b) When government infrastructure projects with
available funding are about to be implemented; or
(c) When there is a court order for eviction and
demolition.
In the execution of eviction or demolition orders
involving underprivileged and homeless citizens, the
following shall be mandatory:
(1) Notice upon the effected persons or
entities at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of
eviction or demolition;

732

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Summary eviction and demolition are also allowed.
However, they are permitted only in cases pertaining to
identified professional squatters, squatting syndicates and
new squatter families, which are not the case here.
"Professional squatters" refer to individuals or groups
who occupy lands without the express consent of the landowner
and who have sufficient income for legitimate housing. They
are persons who have previously been awarded homelots
or housing units by the Government but who sold, leased or
transferred the same to settle illegally in the same place or in
another urban area, and non-bona fide occupants and intruders
of lands reserved for socialized housing.
"Squatting syndicates", on the other hand, refers to groups
of persons engaged in the business of squatter housing for
profit or gain. While "new squatter" refers to individual groups
who occupy land without the express consent of the landowner
after March 28, 1992. Their structures shall be dismantled
and appropriate charges shall be filed against them by the
proper authorities if they refuse to vacate the premises. (IRR
Governing Summary Eviction.)
Records are bereft of information that any of the 93
families as members of the Samahan, including private
complainants, were identified by the Local Government
Unit as squatter families, thus, they cannot be considered
professional squatters or members of a squatting syndicate.
Neither can they be considered new squatter families because
the construction of makeshift homes was made on their own
property.
Petitioners' acts were clearly committed with evident
bad faith. The demolition of private complainants' houses
was precipitated by the refusal of Municipal Engr. Fernando
Rono to issue a building permit for failure of the 93 families to
secure a development permit. The summary removal of private
complainants' makeshift homes constructed in their private
property by the demolition team headed by Brgy. Chairman
Simbulan and Capt. Evasco upon the instruction of Mayor
Cuerpo was made in blatant disregard of private complainants'
right to due process and was done without observance of the
applicable laws on demolition.
The Sandiganbayan correctly sentenced petitioners
Cuerpo, et. al. to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for an

Comments

1.
A municipal mayor is justified in ordering the closure of a
cabaret which operates within the prohibited radius from a chapel
devoted to religious services held with regularity. (Martelino v.
Estrella, 7 SCRA 827.)
2.
Mayor's refusal to issue business permits will not be
interfered with unless abusive. (Enriquez, Jr. v. Bidin, 47 SCRA

B.

Decided Cases

1.
The city ordinance of Manila which imposes a fee of
fifty pesos (P50.00) to enable aliens to be employed in the city is
a revenue measure. The said ordinance is unreasonable because it
failed to consider valid differences in situations among aliens who
are required to pay it. The power of the municipal mayor to issue
permits and licenses must not violate the equal protection clause.
VILLEGAS v. HIU CHIONG TSAI PAO HO
86 SCRA 270, November 10, 1978, Fernandez, J.
Facts: The Municipal Board of Manila passed Ordinance
No. 6537 which "prohibits aliens from being employed or to
engaged or participate in any position or occupation or business
enumerated therein, whether permanent, temporary or casual,
without first securing an employment permit from the Mayor
of Manila and paying the permit fee of P50.00 except persons
employed in the diplomatic or consular missions of foreign

Title Two -- The Municipality

735

countries, or in the technical assistance programs of both
the Philippine Government and any foreign government, and
those working in their respective households, and members of
religious orders or congregations, sect or denomination, who
are not paid monetarily or in kind."
Held: The contention of the City is not correct. While
the first part of the ordinance may be regulatory as far as the
requirement of obtaining a permit is concerned; the second
part which requires the payment of fifty pesos (P50.00) as
employee's fee is not regulatory but a revenue measure. There
is no logic or justification in exacting fifty pesos (P50.00) from
aliens who have been cleared for employment. The purpose of
the ordinance is to raise money under the guise of regulation.
The ordinance also violates the equal protection clause.
Although the equal protection clause of the Constitution does
not forbid classification, it is imperative that the classification
should be based on real and substantial differences having a
reasonable relation to the subject of the particular legislation.
The ordinance is not only excessive but it fails to consider valid
substantial differences in situation among the aliens required
to pay it. The same amount of P50.00 is being collected from
every employed alien, whether he is casual or permanent, part
time or full time or whether he is a lowly employee or a highly
paid executive.
The ordinance is also void because it constitutes undue
delegation of legislative power to the Mayor. The ordinance
does not lay down any criterion or standard to guide the Mayor
in the exercise of his discretion in the issuance or denial of an
alien employment permit.
The ordinance also violates the right to life. Requiring
a person before he can be employed to get a permit from the
Mayor who may withhold or refuse it at will is tantamount to
denying him the basic right to the people in the Philippines
to engage in a means of livelihood. While it is true that the
Philippines as a State is not obliged to admit aliens within its
territory, once an alien is admitted, he cannot be deprived of life
without due process of law. This guarantee includes the means
of livelihood. The shelter of protection under due process and
equal protection clause is given to all persons, both aliens and
citizens.

Regarding the validity of the resolution which imposes a
1% contribution from all threshers and in the absence of a decision
declaring it invalid, its legality would have to be presumed. As
executive officials of the municipality, they have the duty to enforce
it as long as it had not been repealed by the Sangguniang Bayan or
annulled by the courts.
TUZONv.CA
212 SCRA 738, August 12, 1992, Cruz, J.
Facts: The Sangguniang Bayan of Camalaniugan,
Cagayan, adopted Resolution No. 9 authorizing the municipal
treasurer to enter into an agreement to all thresher operators
who/which will apply for a permit to donate one percent (1%)
of all the palay threshed by them with the view of using the
funds to be raised for the construction of a Sports and Nutrition
Center. To implement the resolution the incumbent municipal
treasurer prepared a document for signature of all thresher/
owner/operator applying for a mayor's permit.
Soon thereafter, private respondent Saturnino T. Jurado
sent his agent to the treasurer's office to pay the license fee of
Two hundred eighty-five pesos (P285.00) for thresher operators.
The treasurer refuse the payment and required him to secure a
mayor's permit. For his part, Mayor Domingo Tuzon said that
Jurado should first comply with Resolution No. 9 and sign the
agreement before a permit could be issued. Jurado ignored the
requirement. Instead, he sent the Two hundred eighty-five
pesos (P285.00) license fee by postal order to the municipal
treasurer, who, however, returned the said amount for failure
to comply with Resolution No. 9.
Held: While it would appear from the wording of the
resolution that the municipal government merely intends to
"solicit" the one percent (1%) contribution from the threshers,
the implementing agreement seems to make the donation
obligatory and a condition precedent to the issuance of the
mayor's permit. This goes against the nature of a donation,
which is an act of liberality and is never obligatory.
If, on the other hand, it is to be considered a tax ordinance,
then it must be shown, in view of the challenge raised by private
respondent, to have been enacted in accordance with the
requirements of the Local Tax Code. These would include the
holding of a public hearing on the measure and its subsequent

737

approval by the Secretary of Finance, in addition to the usual
requisites for publication of ordinances in general.

The Court is convinced that the petitioners acted within
the scope of their authority and in consonance with their honest
interpretation of the resolution in question. We agree that it
was not from them to rule on this validity. In the absence of
a judicial decision declaring it invalid, its legality would have
to be presumed (in fact, both the trial court and the appellate
court said that there was nothing wrong with it). As executive
officials of the municipality, they had the duty to enforce it as
long as it had not been repealed by the Sangguniang Bayan or
annulled by the courts.

No liability, whether civil or criminal may be imputed to
a Mayor who, in entering into a contract, merely complied with the
mandate of resolutions passed by the Sanggunian Bayan.
CONSTANTINO v. DESIERTO
288 SCRA 654, April 13, 1998, Narvasa, C.J.
Facts: The Sangguniang Bayan of Malungon, Sarangani
Province, adopted and issued Resolution No. 21 which
authorized Mayor Constantino "to enter into a negotiated
contract representing the Municipality.... (with) any company
dealing with heavy equipment." The resolution, however,
contained no parameters as to rate of rental, period of lease
and purchase price.
Accordingly, Mayor Constantino entered into an
agreement with a firm called the Norlovanian Corporation,
for the lease by the municipality of seven (7) units of heavy
equipment of the types specified in the Resolution. Resolution
No. 38 "unanimously approved" on April 18, 1996 by the
Sangguniang Bayan of Malungon
"requesting the Mayor
Constantino, to operate the newly acquired heavy equipment
leased". The mayor directed that the heavy equipment be
operated and used in various projects.
However, operation came to a halt barely two (2) months
later by virtue of Resolution No. 4 7 "stopping all forms of
unauthorized payment/expenditures relative to the illegally
acquired pool of heavy equipment by the Municipality of
Malungon."
Meanwhile, an information for Violation of the Anti-Graft
and Corrupt Practices Act against both Mayor Constantino

738

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

and Norberto Lindong, was filed before the Sandiganbayan on
August 8, 1996, with due approval of Ombudsman Desierto.
Under date of October 22, 1996, Graft Investigation
Officer Buena handed down a Resolution finding the petitioner
"GUILTY of grave misconduct, prejudicial to the best interest of
the service, and gross neglect of duty,"and ordering his dismissal
from the service. That Resolution was, on recommendation of
Deputy Ombudsman Gervacio, Jr. approved by Ombudsman
Desierto.
Held: The Mayor's contention is that no liability, whether
criminal or administrative, may be imputed to him since he
merely complied with Resolution No. 21 and Resolution No.
38, and that the charges leveled against him are politically
motivated. Examination of the records show that the evidence
against him is inadequate to warrant his dismissal from the
service on the specified grounds of grave misconduct, conduct
prejudicial to the best interest of the service and gross neglect
of duty.
Resolution No. 47, stopped all "rental payment/
expenditures relative to the pool of heavy equipment of the
Norlovanian Company." The stoppage was based on prior
resolutions of the Council-allegedly setting down the terms
under which the heavy equipment should be acquired, and
which terms were supposedly violated by the Mayor. Butunaccountably and again indicative of bad faith, if not malice,
on the part of private respondents-Resolution No. 47 made
absolutely no reference to the two (2) resolutions which on their
face justify the Mayor's contract with Norlovanian Corporation.

The Municipality of San Nicolas, represented by Mayor
Rodrigo, entered into an agreement with Philwood Construction
for the electrification of Barangay Caboloan, San Nicolas, for
the sum of P486,386.18.
Petitioners received a Notice of Disallowance from the
Provincial Auditor of Pangasinan, who found that as per COA
(Commission on Audit) evaluation of the electrification project,
only 60.0171% of the project (equivalent to P291,915.07) was
actually accomplished. On 10 January 1994, the Provincial
Auditor filed a criminal complaint for estafa before the
Ombudsman against petitioners. An information was filed
against petitioners for violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act
No. 3019 before the Sandiganbayan.
The prosecution moved to suspend petitioners pendente
lite. Petitioners opposed the motion on the ground that
the Sandiganbayan lacked jurisdiction over them. The
Sandiganbayan ruled otherwise.
Held: After a meticulous scrutiny of petitioners'
arguments, we find the petition devoid of merit.
Petitioners question the jurisdiction ofthe Sandiganbayan.
They contend that Mayor Rodrigo occupies a position of

jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.

(DBM) pursuant to Republic Act No. 6758, otherwise known
as the "Compensation and Position Classification Act of 1989,"
lists under Salary Grade 27, the position of "Municipal Mayor

I."
Petitioners conclude that Mayor Rodrigo, at the time of
the commission of the alleged crime, was occupying a Grade 24
position and, thus, not within the Sandiganbayan's original and
exclusive jurisdiction, as defined in Section 2 of R.A. No. 7975.
This is a simplistic, and altogether incorrect, interpretation of
the law.
The DBM drafted the 1989 Index of Occupational
Services, Position Titles and Salary Grades, later revised in
1997. In both versions, the position of Municipal Mayor was

740

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Book III Local Government Units
Title Two The Municipality

741

assigned a Salary Grade 27. Petitioner mayor's position having
been classified as Grade 27 in accordance with R.A. No. 6758,
and having been charged with violation of Section 3(e) of
R.A. No. 3019, petitioner is subject to the jurisdiction of the
Sandiganbayan.

Ruling: In finding probable cause for the crime of
Technical Malversation, the Ombudsman based its findings
on the strength of the evidence submitted by the private
complainant, as well as the weak defense of the petitioners,
thus:

5.
Mayor Villarosa, et. al. applied the Tobacco Fund to the
purchase of vehicles, Christmas lights, meals and snacks of newlyelected Barangay Captains and SK Chairpersons, medicines, and
gravel and sand. There is probable cause for technical malversation
under Article 220, RPC.

Respondents were public officers who received
from Occidental Mindoro's Congressional Representative
a portion of the province's share in the revenue from the
tobacco excise tax for proper administration. Pursuant
to RA 8240, the local government unit's share in
the proceeds should be used solely for cooperative,
livelihood and/or agro-industrial projects that
enhance the quality of agricultural products, develop
alternative farming systems, or enable tobacco farmers to
manage and own post-harvest enterprises like cigarette
manufacturing and byproduct utilization. The clear
intention to limit the use of such proceeds to the abovementioned specific purposes was further made known to
and disseminated among Governors, Municipal and City
Mayors, Sanggunian Members and all other concerned
officials through Joint Circular No. 2009-1 dated 3
November 2009 entitled "Guidelines and Procedure on
the Release of the Share of Local Government Units
Producing Burley and Native Tobacco Products from
the Fifteen Percent (15%) of the Incremental Revenue
Collected from the Excise Tax on Tobacco Products."

VILLAROSA v. OMBUDSMAN
G.R. No. 221418, January 23, 2019, Peralta, J.
Facts: Private respondent Rolando C. Basilio filed
criminal and administrative complaints with the Ombudsman
against petitioners Jose Villarosa, Municipal Mayor; Pablo
Alvaro, Municipal Accountant; and Carlito Cajayon, Municipal
Treasurer; all of San Jose, Occidental Mindoro, for Malversation
of Public Funds defined and penalized under Article 220 of
the Revised Penal Code (RPC); violation of Section 3 (a), (e),
(g) and (i) of R.A. No. 3019; violation of R.A. No. 8240; grave
abuse of authority; grave misconduct; dishonesty; and conduct
prejudicial to the best interest of the service.
According to Basilio, petitioner Villarosa, together with
petitioners Alvaro and Cajayon, approved the use of the
municipality's "Trust Fund" derived from tobacco excise taxes
(Tobacco Fund) under R.A. No. 8240 to finance the regular
operations of the municipality. It was also alleged that the
expenses of the municipality which the Tobacco Fund was
made to account for were not within the purpose for which
said fund was created. Petitioner Villarosa was further alleged
to have procured ten (10) "reconditioned" multi-cab vehicles
amounting to P2,115,000.00, but the invitation to bid and the
contracts executed therefor did not indicate that said vehicles
were "reconditioned."
In its Joint Resolution dated March 23, 2015, the
Ombudsman found probable cause to indict petitioners for
Technical Malversation and violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A.
No. 3019.

Notwithstanding the mandate of the law and the circular,
respondents applied the Tobacco fund to the purchase of
vehicles, Christmas lights, meals and snacks of newlyelected Barangay Captains and SK Chairpersons,
medicines, and gravel and sand. They also used said
fund for the maintenance of a PNP vehicle and other
service vehicle, for bus rentals, and various other
municipal activities.
Alvaro's and Cajayon's defense of merely performing
ministerial duties is unavailing. Both were not unaware of the
expenses the municipality charged against the Tobacco Fund.
As Accountant and Treasurer, both are expected to possess
special knowledge of the nature of the different funds under a
local government unit's administration, as well as the purposes
and limitations for their use. In this instance, both would have
known the mandate of RA 8240 and even Joint Circular No.

742

2009-1; and should have been adamant against using the
Tobacco Fund for purposes not conforming therewith.
The Joint Resolution and Order of the Office of the
Ombudsman are AFFIRMED only insofar as its finding of
probable cause against petitioners for the crime of Technical
Malversation.

TADENA v. PEOPLE
G.R. No. 228610, March 20, 2019, J. Reyes, Jr., J.
Facts: On 17 October 2001, the accused Floro T. Tadena,
then the Municipal Mayor of Sto. Domingo, Ilocos Sur, wrote a
letter to the members of the [Sangguniang Bayan] requesting
for the creation of the position of a Municipal Administrator.
On 11 January 2002, the Sangguniang Bayan deliberated
on Tadena's request and passed the Second Version. Paragraph
(a) of the 4w "Whereas Clause" thereof stated that:
"(a) The position "MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATOR"
shall not be created unless 2% of the Mandatory 5%
Salary Increase for 2002 be implemented"
On 14 January 2002, the SB Secretary, Rode! M. Tagorda,
transmitted a copy of the Second Version to Tadena for his
information, approval and appropriate action.
On 23 January 2002, the Office of the Municipal Mayor
returned the copy of the Second Version with Tadena's
signature but the first page thereof was substituted and an
apparent change in paragraph (a) of the 40 "Whereas Clause"
was noted, to wit:

"(a) The position ''MUNICIPAL ADMINISTRATOR"
shall be created and the 2% of the Mandatory 5% Salary
Increase for 2002 be implemented."
On July 4, 2014, the Ombudsman filed an Information
against Tadena and charged him of falsification of public
document under Article 171, paragraph 6 of the Revised Penal
Code (RPC).

Book III Local Government Units
Title Two - The Municipality

743

On September 15, 2016, the Sandiganbayan rendered
a Decision in Criminal Case No. SB-14-CRM-0327, finding
Tadena guilty.
Ruling: In the prosecution of falsification by a public
officer, employee, or notary public under Article 171 of the
RPC, the following are the elements:
a.
The offender is a public officer, employee, or
notary public;
b.
The offender takes advantage of his/her official
position;
6.
Making any alteration or intercalation in
a genuine document which changes its meaning;
The alteration changed the meaning of the Second Version
of the municipal ordinance and represented a false intention
of the local legislative body. The SB correctly observed that
the Sangguniang Bayan originally wanted the creation of
the municipal administrator's office to be dependent on the
implementation of the 2% of the 5% mandatory salary increase
for 2002. However, after the alteration, Tadena made it appear
that the creation of the municipal administrator's office was
independent from the implementation of the mandatory salary
increase. Clearly, the alteration departed from the intention of
the Sangguniang Bayan, removed the condition imposed, and
conveyed an untruthful idea.
The petition is DENIED. The Decision and the Resolution
of the Sandiganbayan are AFFIRMED.

A.

Decided Cases

1.
Abolition of an office must be done in good faith in order
not to be covered by the protection of the security of tenure clause by
the Constitution.
GINSON v. MUNICIPALITY OF MURCIA
158 SCRA 1, February 8, 1988, Sarmiento, J.
Held: It is true that abolition of office neither means
removal nor separation from office and is not covered by the
protection of the security of tenure clause of the Constitution.
This principle, however, carries with it a caveat. That the
abolition is done in good faith.
2.
The municipality's compensation-setting power in Section
447 of R.A. No. 7160 to grant ECA, ACA, MAME, and MAMA cannot
prevail over Section 12 of R.A. No. 6758 or the SSL. No law or
administrative issuance, much less the [SSL]. authorizes the grant
of (the] subject benefits.
MADERA v. COMMISSION ON AUDIT
G.R. No. 244128, September 8, 2020, Caguioa, J.
Facts: In December 2013, the Municipality of Mondragon,
Northern Samar passed and approved Sangguniang Bayan
(SB) Ordinance No. 08and SB Resolutions Nos. 41, 42, 43 and
48 all series of 2013, granting various allowances to its officials
and employees. These allowances are: 1) Economic Crisis
Assistance (ECA), 2) Monetary Augmentation of Municipal
Agency (MAMA), 3) Agricultural Crisis Assistance (ACA), and
4) Mitigation Allowance to Municipal Employees (MA-ME).
These allowances in question amounted to P7,706,253.10.
The Audit Team Leader (ATL) and the Supervising
Auditor (SA) of the Municipality issued a total of 11 Notices of
Disallowance (NDs) dated February 20, 2014 for the grant of
the ECA, MAMA, ACA and MAME.

748

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

The persons held liable under the NDs were as follows:
Mario M. Madera (Madera), Municipal Mayor; Beverly C.
Mananguite (Mananguite), Municipal Accountant; Carissa D.
Galing (Galing), Municipal Treasurer; and Josefina 0. Pelo
(Pelo), Municipal Budget Officer; and all other payees as stated
in the NDs.
Ruling: The Court upholds the NDs against the subject
allowances, finding no grave abuse of discretion on the part of
the COA in affirming the disallowance. The Court quotes with
approval the following pronouncements by the COA:
Section 447 (a) (1) (viii) of RA No. 7160 provides:
SEC. 447. Powers, Duties, Functions and
Compensation.
(a)
(1) (viii) Determine the positions and
salaries, wages, allowances and other emoluments
and benefits of officials and employees paid wholly
or mainly from municipal funds and provide for
expenditures necessary for the proper conduct of
programs, projects, services, and activities of the
municipal government;
Section 12 of RA No. 6758, the SSL, states:
Consolidation ofAllowances and Compensation.
Al l allowances, except for representation and
transportation allowances; clothing and laundry
allowances; subsistence allowance of marine officers
and crew on board government vessels and hospital
personnel; hazard pay; allowances of foreign
service personnel stationed abroad; and such other
additional compensation not otherwise specified
herein as may be determined by the DBM, shall
be
deemed included in the standardized salary rates

herein prescribed x xx."
The municipality's compensation-setting power in
Section 447 of RA No. 7160 to grant ECA, ACA, MAM E, and
MAMA cannot prevail over Section 12 of RA No. 6758 or the
SSL. No law or administrative issuance, much less the [SSLI,
authorizes the grant of [the] subject benefits.
In view of the foregoing, the Court upholds the NDs
against the ECA, ACA, MAM E, and MAMA .

749

In view of the foregoing discussion, the Court pronounces:
1.
If a Notice of Disallowance is set aside by the
Court, no return shall be required from any of the persons
held liable therein.
2.
If a Notice of Disallowance is upheld, the rules
on return are as follows:
a.
Approving and certifying officers who
acted in good faith, in regular performance of official
functions, and with the diligence of a good father of
the family are not civilly liable to return consistent
with Section 38 of the Administrative Code of 1987.
b.
Approving and certifying officers who are
clearly shown to have acted in bad faith, malice,
or gross negligence are, pursuant to Section 43 of
the Administrative Code of 1987, solidarily liable
to return only the net disallowed amount which, as
discussed herein, excludes amounts excused under
the following sections 2c and 2d.
c.
Recipients
whether
approving
or
certifying officers or mere passive recipients are
liable to return the disallowed amounts respectively
received by them, unless they are able to show that
the amounts they received were genuinely given in
consideration of services rendered.
d.
The Court may likewise excuse the return
of recipients based on undue prejudice, social justice
considerations, and other bona fide exceptions as it
may determine on a case to case basis.
Examined under the rubric of the rules above, the Court
holds that petitioners approving and certifying officers need
not refund the disallowed .amounts inasmuch as they had
acted in good faith. The Court accepts the arguments raised by
the petitioners as badges of good faith.
First, a review of the SB Resolutions and Ordinance used
as basis for the grant of the subject allowances shows that these
were primarily intended as financial assistance to municipal
employees in view of the increase of cost on prime commodities,
shortage of agricultural products, and the vulnerability of

750

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Title 'Two- The Municipality

safety and protection of all municipal
government property, public documents,
or records such as those relating to
property
inventory,
land-ownership,
records of births, marriages, deaths,
assessments, taxation, accounts, business
permits, and such other records and
documents of public interest in the
offices and departments of the municipal
government;

their municipality to calamities and disasters such as typhoon
Yolanda.
Second, that these additional allowances had been
customarily granted over the years and there was no previous
disallowance issued by the COA against these allowances
further bolster petitioners' claim of good faith.
Notably, since the issuance of the NDs in 2014, the
Municipality has stopped giving these allowances to their
employees.

(xi) When the finances of the
municipal government allow, provide for
additional allowances and other benefits
to judges, prosecutors, public elementary
and high schools teachers, and other
national government officials stationed in
or assigned to the municipality;

Third, petitioners relied on the Resolutions and Ordinance
of the Sangguniang Bayan which have not been invalidated;
hence, it was within their duty to execute these issuances
in the absence of any contrary holding by the Sangguniang
Panlalawigan or the COA.
Thus, petitioners-approving and certifying officers are
shielded from civil liability for the disallowance under Section
38 of the Administrative Code of 1987.
As for the payees, the Court notes that the COA Proper
already excused their return; hence, they no longer appealed.
In any case, while they are ordinarily liable to return for having
unduly received the amounts validly disallowed by COA, the
return was properly excused not because of their good faith but
because it will cause undue prejudice to require them to return
amounts that were given as financial assistance and meant to
tide them over during a natural disaster.
The petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED. The COA
Decision affirming the Notices of Disallowance in the total
amount of P7,706,253.10 is AFFIRMED with MODIFICATION
that petitioners need not refund the said disallowed amount.
(ix) Authorize the
payment of
compensation to a qualified person not
in the government service who fills up a
temporary vacancy or grant honorarium
to any qualified official or employee
designated to fill a temporary vacancy
in a concurrent capacity at the rate
authorized by law;
(x) Provide a mechanism and the
appropriate funds therefore, to ensure the

Decided Case

1.
We hereby affirm the power of the Municipality of Naujan
to grant the questioned allowance to petitioner Judge Leynes
in accordance with the constitutionally mandated policy of local
autonomy and the provisions of the Local Government Code of 1991.
LEYNES v. THE COMMISSION ON AUDIT
418 SCRA 180, December 11, 2003, Corona, J.
Facts: Petitioner Judge Tomas C. Leynes who, at present,
is the presiding judge of the Regional Trial Court of Calapan
City, Oriental Mindoro, Branch 40 was formerly assigned
to the Municipality of Naujan, Oriental Mindoro as the sole
presiding judge of the Municipal Trial Court thereof. As such,
his salary and representation and transportation allowance
(RATA) were drawn from the budget of the Supreme Court. In
addition, petitioner received a monthly allowance of P944 from
the local funds of the Municipality of Naujan starting 1984.
On May 7, 1993, the Sangguniang Bayan unanimously
approved Resolution No. 101 increasing petitioner judge's
monthly allowance from P944 to P1,600 starting May 1993.
On February 17, 1994, Provincial Auditor Salvacion
M. Dalisay sent a letter to the Municipal Mayor and the
Sangguniang Bayan of Naujan directing them to stop the

752

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

payment of the P1,600 monthly allowance or RATA to petitioner
judge and to require the immediate refund of the amounts
previously paid to the latter. She opined that the Municipality
of Naujan could not grant RATA to petitioner judge in addition
to the RATA the latter was already receiving from the Supreme
Court.
Ruling: The main issue ... is whether or not the
Municipality of Naujan, Oriental Mindoro can validly provide
RATA to its Municipal Judge, in addition to that provided by
the Supreme Court.
Section 447(a)1)xi) of RA 7160, the Local Government
Code of 1991, provides: (xi) When the finances of the municipal
government allow, provide for additional allowances and
other benefits to judges, prosecutors, public elementary and
high school teachers, and other national government officials
stationed in or assigned to the municipality;
Respondent COA, however, contends that the above
section has been repealed, modified or amended by National
Compensation Circular (NCC) No. 67 dated January 1, 1992,
RA 7645 (the General Appropriations Act of 1993) and Local
Budget Circular (LBC) No. 53 dated September 1, 1993.
The prohibition in NCC No. 67 is only against the dual
or multiple collection of RATA by a national official from the
budgets of two or more national agencies. Stated otherwise,
when a national official is on detail with another national
agency, he should get his RATA only from his parent national
agency and not from the other national agency he is detailed to.
Since the other source referred in the controversial prohibition
is another national agency, said prohibition clearly does not
apply to LG Us like the Municipality of Naujan.
Though LBC No. 53 of the DBM may be considered within
the ambit of the President's power of general supervision over
LGUs, we rule that Section 3, paragraph (e) thereofis invalid.
RA 7160, the Local Government Code of 1991, clearly provides
that provincial, city and municipal governments may grant
allowances to judges as long as their finances allow. Section 3,
paragraph (e) of LBC No. 53, by outrightly prohibiting LGUs
from granting allowances to judges whenever such allowances
are (1) also granted by the national government or (2) similar
to the allowances granted by the national government, violates

Book III - Local Government Units
Title Two - The Municipality

763

Section 447(a)0)(xi) of the Local Government Code of 1991. As
already stated, a circular must conform to the law it seeks to
implement and should not modify or amend it.
We hereby affirm the power of the Municipality of Naujan
to grant the questioned allowance to petitioner Judge Leynes
in accordance with the constitutionally mandated policy of
local autonomy and the provisions of the Local Government
Code of 1991. We also sustain the validity of Resolution No.
101, Series of 1993, of the Sangguniang Bayan of Naujan for
being in accordance with the law.
The petition is hereby GRANTED. The decision of COA is
hereby SET ASIDE and Section 3, paragraph (e) of LBC No. 53
is hereby declared NULL and VOID.
(xii) Provide for legal assistance
to barangay officials who, in the
performance of their official duties or
on the occasion thereof, have to initiate
judicial proceedings or defend themselves
against legal action; and
(xiii) Provide for group insurance
or additional insurance coverage for
barangay officials, including members
of barangay tanod brigades and other
service units, with public or private
insurance companies, when the finances
of the municipal government allow said
coverage;
(2) Generate and max imize the use of
resources and revenues for the development
plans, program objectives and priorities of the
municipality as provided for under Section
18 of this Code with particular attention to
agro-industrial development and countryside
growth and progress, and relative thereto,

and upon the majority vote of all the
members of the sangguniang bayan,
enact ordinances levying taxes, fees and

Comments

1.
The Municipal Board of Manila, in the exercise of
police power, may reasonably regulate professions and business
enterprises within its territorial limits when public health, safety
and welfare so demand. The prohibition against installation of gas
stations within 500 meters from each other seeks not only to prevent
ruinous competition among merchants, but also to protect the public
from harm or danger that may be occasioned by the inflammable
substance. (Javier v. Earnshaw, 64 Phil. 626, 1937.)
2.
An ordinance prohibiting the construction of a building
because it would destroy the view of the public plaza is oppressive,
since it would permanently deprive the owners thereof the right to
use their property. (People v. Fajardo, 104 Phil. 443,1956.)
3.
An ordinance which prohibits the disconnection of any
electrical wire connected to any consumer's building with the power
plant without the consent of the consumer, except in case of fire,
clear and positive danger to the residents, or order of the authorities,
is an unwarranted exercise of power for the general welfare to
the extent that deprives the company of its property without due
process. (Butuan Sawmill, Inc. v. City of Butuan, I6 SCRA 755.)
4.
Municipal Ordinance No. 4841 of the City of Manila,
regulating rentals of lots and buildings for residential purposes
is declared illegal and unconstitutional inasmuch as the same
generally entails a curtailment of the liberty, the rights and/or the
property of persons, which are protected and even guaranteed by
the Constitution. (Homeowners' Association of the Philippines, Inc.
v. Municipal Board of the City of Manila, 24 SCRA 856.)

Facts: Plaintiff leased from the Insular Government a
certain parcel of land in Cebu and had an approved plan for a
building thereon. But defendant municipality refused to issue
the necessary permit on the ground that under Ordinance No. 3

756

Book III Local Government Units
Title Two -- The Municipality

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

767

of the City of Cebu, it was provided that every building erected
in McClernand Street and its parallels towards the sea shall be
of three stories: the first four meters in height, the second three
meters, and the last four meters. Its front shall be in harmony
with the ornamentation adopted by the municipality for this
street and no permit shall be issued that does not fulfill the
above conditions.

A.

Held: The defendant's theory is that Ordinance No. 3 is
valid and is authorized under Sec. 39(1) of the Municipal Code
which provides that the municipal council shall establish fire
limits, prescribe the kind of building that may be constructed
within the limits and issue permits for erection of the same. The
law is so abstract and contains no detailed provision regarding
the manner of exercising the alleged power in question. This
being so, the exercise must be subjected to the requirements
of reason and public expediency that in the absence of definite
provisions must serve as a guide. It is absurd to suppose that
the power can be exercised without limitation.

"Not only does the State effectuate its purposes through the
exercise of the police power, but the municipalities does also. Like
the State, the police power of a municipal corporation extends to
all matters affecting the peace, order, health, morals, convenience,
comforts, and safety of its citizens-the security of social orderthe best and highest interests of the municipality. The best
considered decisions have tended to broaden the scope of action of
the municipality in dealing with police offenses. 'The public welfare
is rightly made the basis of construction." (Ebona v. Municipality of
Daet, 85 Phil. 369.)

In this case, it is not reasonable to require the plaintiff to
erect more than one storey or display a special ornamentation.
The municipality is ordered to issue the permit requested by
the plaintiff.

B.

(vii) Adopt a comprehensive land use
plan for the municipality: Provided, That
the formulation, adoption, or modification
of said plan shall be in coordination with
the approved provincial comprehensive
land use plan;
(viii) Reclassify land within the
jurisdiction of the municipality, subject
to the pertinent provisions of this Code;
(ix) Enact
integrated
zoning
ordinances in consonance with the
approved comprehensive land use plan,
subject to existing laws, rules and
regulations; establish fire limits or
zones, particularly in populous centers;
and regulate the construction, repair or
modification of buildings with said fire
limits or zones in accordance with the
provisions of the Fire Code;

Comm ents

. 1.
"Although such regulation often interferes with an owner's
desires as to the use of his property and hamper his freedom in regard
it, they have generally been sustained as valid exercises of the police
power, provided that there is nothing arbitrary or unreasonable in
the laying out of the zones, and that no uncontrolled discretion is
vested in an officer as to the grant or refusal of building permits."

Decided Cases

1.
The Municipality of Cabanatuan, by virtue of Section 2238
of the Administrative Code has the authority to enact a zonification
ordinance and to regulate motor engines which may be installed
within the said zone.

PEOPLE v. CRUZ
54 Phil. 24, November 12, 1924, Villareal, J.
. Facts: The Municipal Council of Cabanatuan passed an
ordinance establishing a zone within which no engine of any
kind is to be allowed for installation. Cruz was charged and
convicted with a violation of said ordinance.
Held: It is a matter definitely settled by both Philippine
and American jurisprudence that municipal corporations may,
in the exercise of their power, enact ordinances or regulations
on zonification. Within the powers granted to municipal
councils in Sec. 2238 of the Administrative Code, the municipal
council of Cabanatuan was authorized to enact the zonification
ordinance. Appellant's contention that the municipal council
does not have the power to enact said ordinance is, therefore,
untenable.
Considering the activities of modern life, and the progress
of mechanical engineering, said authority must be construed

758

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

to extend to the motor engines, since both kinds of engines are
dangerous in their handling and operation, and have the same
end, namely, the development of motor power for industrial
purposes. As to the contention that the power to regulate
does not include the power to prohibit, it will be seen that the
ordinance does not prohibit the installation of motor engines
within the municipality of Cabanatuan, but only within
the zone fixed therein. If the Municipality of Cabanatuan
is authorized to establish said Zone, it is also authorized to
provide what kind of engines may be installed therein. In
banning the installation in said zone of all engines not excepted
in the ordinance, the municipal did no more than regulate their
installation by means of zonification.
2.
The City of Manila has the authority, in consonance with
its police power to forbid the plaintiff to continue the manufacture
of a sauce known as "toyo" in an area which has been declared
residential.
SENG KEE & CO. v. EARNSHAW
56 Phil. 204, October 21, 1931, Imperial, J.
Facts: Upon suggestion from the Department of Health,
the Municipal Board of Manila enacted an ordinance dividing
the city into zones, residential and industrial; with provisions
that certain trades and industries within the city regarded
as noxious may be conducted only in the industrial zone. The
manufacture of 'toyo' was included in the classification of
noxious industries.

Book III Local Government Units
Title Two The Municipality

7569

territory into residential and industrial zones, and to prescribe
that offensive and unwholesome trades and occupation are to
be established exclusively in industrial zones as provided by
the ordinance.
It is a matter definitely settled that municipal corporations
may, in the exercise of their police power, enact ordinances
or regulations on zonification. From that power, it cannot be
denied that the City of Manila has authority, in consonance
with police power, of forbidding plaintiff to continue the
manufacture of 'toyo' in the zone where it is now situated
which has been declared residential, without providing for any
compensation. These provisions of the ordinance in question
do not in fact deprive the residents of Manila of their property
without just compensation, for it deprives them neither of the
ownership nor of the possession thereof, but simply restricts
them from the use of such property at certain places for the
good of the majority of the inhabitants. Provisions of the
Constitution protect the citizen in his right to engage in any
lawful business, but it does not prevent legislation intended to
regulate useful occupations which, because of their nature or
location, may prove injurious or offensive to the public.
3.
Sangguniang Bayan Resolution No. 2006-004 is not a
zoning ordinance nor a comprehensive land use plan adopted by the
Municipal Council of San Antonio, Nueva Ecija and approved by the
BLURB prior to June 15, 1988. The subject properties remain to be
agricultural and are not exempt from the Comprehensive Agrarian
Reform Law.

Plaintiff was engaged in the manufacture of 'toyo.' At the
end of the 4-year period, the time provided by the ordinance
for those already established firms in residential to transfer to
industrial zones, plaintiff was refused a license and asked to
move elsewhere because he could not be permitted to continue
in that zone. Upon its refusal to transfer, it was charged
with violation of said ordinance. Plaintiff claimed that said
ordinance is void because it deprives owners of their property
without just compensation.

Facts: Subject of the instant controversy are parcels of
land located at Barangay San Mariano, San Antonio, Nueva
Ecija, and registered under the names of Elfeda, Albert,
Napoleon, Eden, Severiano, Celia, and Leo, all surnamed
Marcelo.

Held: The validity of the ordinance in question cannot be
put in issue for the same flows from the police power inherent
in every legislature, and here delegated to the City of Manila.
There can be no doubt that the city has the power to divide its

Ruling: Petitioners, anchor their application for
exemption from coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian
Reform Law on the issuances of three government agencies that
purportedly reclassified the properties as residential: the NHA,

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the Sangguniang Bayan, and the HLURB. Unfortunately,
none of these pieces of documentary evidence prove that the
properties were classified or reclassified as residential prior to
June 15, 1988, the cffectivity of R.A. 6657, the Comprehensive
Agrarian Reform Law.

Sangguniang Bayan Resolution No. 2006.004 is not a
zoning ordinance or a comprehensive land use plan adopted
by the Municipal Council of San Antonio, Nueva Ecija and
approved by the HLURB prior to June 15, 1988.
By its terms, Sangguniang Bayan Resolution No. 2006004 does not purport to delineate an area or district in the
municipality as residential pursuant to the municipal council's
power under Section 3 of the Local Autonomy Act of 1959 or
under Section 447 of the Local Government Code of 1991. It
is not even a comprehensive land use plan as it is curiously
property-specific. The Resolution does not even purport to be
an ordinance approving petitioners' application for subdivision
and development of the subject properties for non-agricultural
use. Instead, Sangguniang Bayan Resolution No. 2006004, appears to be, is an acquiescence to the request made
by the petitioners to ratify and recognize their properties as
residential. These "ratification" and "recognition" are in turn,
speciously predicated upon a MAR O certification that there is
no agricultural tenancy over the properties and upon the NHAissued certificate of registration and license to sell which, as
established, covered a different property. Also, the Resolution
was passed only in 2006.
Indubitably, petitioners fail to discharge the burden
of proving that the properties were classified in the zoning
ordinance and land use plan as residential, and that such zoning
ordinance and land use plan were approved by the HLURB
prior to June 15, 1988. At the very least, petitioners ought to
have established that the subject properties were classified
or reclassified as residential by any authorized government
agency prior to June 15, 1988. But even this, petitioners fail
to discharge. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that the
subject properties remain to be agricultural and are therefore,
not exempt from the coverage of the CARL.
The petition is DENIED. The Decision and the Resolution
of the Court of Appeals are AFFIRMED.

Decided Cases

The Municipal Board of Manila can increase the annual
license fees of first class and second class hotels and motels by 150%
and 200% respectively since it is settled that municipal licenses may
be issued for regulation or restriction of non-useful occupations or
enterprises and for revenue purposes.
ERMITA-MALATE HOTEL & MOTEL OPERATORS
ASSOCIATION v. CITY MAYOR OF MANILA
20 SCRA 849, July 31, 1967, Fernando, J.
Facts: The Municipal Board of Manila enacted Ordinance
No. 4760 which among others, imposes a license fee of P6,000
per annum for first class hotels and motels, and P4,500 per

Book III .-- Local Government Units
Title Two The Municipality

763

annum for second class hotels and motels. Petitioner, an
association of 18 member-operators, question the imposition of
the said fee as violative of the Constitution.
Held: Ordinance No. 4 760 imposes an increase of the
annual license fees equivalent to 150% for first-class hotels
and motels and more than 200% for second-class hotels and
motels. The increase, however, was intended to discourage
establishments of such kind from operating for purposes other
than legal and at the same time, to increase the income of the
city government.
Furthermore, it is settled law that municipal licenses
could be classified into those imposed for regulating occupations
or regular enterprises, for the regulation or restriction of nonuseful occupations or enterprises, and for revenue purposes
only. Licenses for non-useful occupations are incidental to the
police power, and the right to exact such a fee may be implied
from the power to license and regulate, but in fixing the
amount of license fee for non-useful occupations the municipal
corporations are allowed a wide discretion in this class of
cases. Aside from applying the well-known legal principle that
municipal ordinances must not be unreasonable, oppressive, or
tyrannical, courts have, as a general rule, declined to interfere
with such discretion. The desirability of imposing restraint
upon the number of persons who might otherwise engage in
non-useful enterprises is, of course, generally an important
factor in the determination of the amount of this kind of license.
Much discretion is given to municipal corporations
in determining the amount of license fees to be imposed for
revenue. The mere fact that some individuals in the community
may be deprived of their present business or a particular mode
of earning a Jiving cannot prevent the exercise of police power.
Persons licensed to pursue occupations which may be in public
need and interest be affected by the exercise of police power
embark in those occupations subject to the disadvantages
which may result in the exercise of that power.
The attack against the validity of the challenged ordinance
cannot be considered a success.

The tax sought to be levied by the Municipal Board of
Manila, though called a property tax, is in reality a license tax on
motor vehicles which is beyond the power of the Municipal Board to
impose.
PHILIPPINE TRANSIT ASS'N v.
CITY TREASURER OF MAN ILA
83 Phil. 722, May 27, 1949, Reyes, J.
Facts: Plaintiff, an organization of public utility truck
operators, challenges the legality of Ordinance No. 2939 of the
City of Manila on the ground that it is beyond the power of
the Municipal Board of the city to enact, and it offends against
the rule on uniformity of taxation. Said ordinance imposes a
property tax on motor vehicles at a rate based exclusively on
the nature of their use, whether private or for hire, and on
their passenger capacity. Defendant replies that the ordinance
imposes a property tax on motor vehicles which is expressly
authorized by the City Charter.
Taking notice that the City of Manila is expressly
authorized by Sec. 2444(n) of the Administrative Code to
levy property tax on motor vehicles, while on the other hand,
it may not exact a license fee or tax for the operation or use
of motor vehicles in public highways, since that is forbidden
by Sec. 7(b) of the Motor Vehicle Law, the vital question for
determination is whether that tax imposed by the ordinance
under consideration is a property tax or a license tax.
Held: The difference between the license and the
property tax is well established. The license tax represents the
permission conceded to do an act, is not supposed to be imposed
for revenue, and is in the main for police purposes. A property
tax, on the other hand, is a tax in the ordinary sense, assessed
according to the value of the property.
It is to be noticed from the provisions of the questioned
ordinance that the tax imposed on motor vehicles is not fixed
according to their value. The tax rate is based exclusively on
the nature of their use, whether private or for hire, and on
their passenger capacity. When it is recollected that the value
of a motor vehicle does not depend upon those factors alone but
also upon its make, age, condition, or state of preservation, the
claim that this tax is an ad valorem tax, or a tax on property
assessed according to its value, would be hard to accept. On the

Book III Local Government Units
Title Two The Municipality

765

other hand, the factors taken into account in fixing the rate of
the tax are those that would naturally be material in fixing a
license fee for the use of the highways, for the tax rate appears
to be based on the size or passenger capacity of the vehicle and
the nature of the use to which it is devoted.
The tax in question, therefore, is not a property tax but
a license tax imposed upon the privilege of operating motor
vehicles on the streets of the City of Manila. This conclusion is
further strengthened by the fact that motor vehicles registered
and kept out of the city are made subject to the tax if they
are regularly used inside the city, and by the further fact that
taxes are set aside for the exclusive repair, maintenance, and
construction of streets and bridges of the City of Manila, as
provided under Sec. 3 of the ordinance. The tax in question
being a license tax and not a property tax, that same is beyond
the power of the Municipal Board of Manila to impose, so
that the ordinance creating it must be declared illegal on that
ground.

PROCTER & GAMBLE, PHIL. v.
MUNICIPALITY OF JAGNA
94 SCRA 894, December 28, 1979,
Melencio-Herera, J.
Facts: The Municipality of Jagna, Bohol imposed storage
fees on all exportable copra deposited in bodegas within the
jurisdiction of the municipality. The validity of the ordinance
was challenged in this case as ultra uires and void.
Held: The validity is upheld under the broad authority
given to municipalities by law to impose and collect municipal
license taxes. Considering that licenses may be for: 1)
regulation of useful corporations, 2) restriction of non-useful
enterprises; and 3) revenue. The Court found it unnecessary to
determine whether the storage fees were for revenue purposes
or reimbursement for services of supervision. The buying and
selling and the storing of copra could properly be regulated
under the power given to it by the general welfare clause of the
Revised Administrative Code.

94 SCRA 533, December 14, 1979, Santos, J.
Facts: When Ortigas and Co. sold two lots in highways
Hills, Mandaluyong, Rizal, the original buyers agreed to the
stipulation that the lots shall be used exclusively for residential
purposes. Subsequently, however, on February 4, 1960, the
municipal council of Mandaluyong passed Resolution No. 27
declaring the area where the lots were located as a commercial
and industrial zone. Two years later, the defendant bank
acquired the lots and in 1963 commenced the construction of
a commercial building. Ortigas and Co. filed action to enjoin
construction.
Which shall prevail-the restrictive covenant in the
purchase agreement or the municipal ordinance?
Held: Resolution No. 27 was a legitimate exercise of police
power "the most essential, insistent, and illimitable of powers"
and "in a sense, the greatest and most powerful attribute of
government." The Court reiterated the PLOT ruling that police
power "is elastic and must be responsive to various social
conditions; it is not confined with narrow circumscriptions
of precedents resting on past conditions; it must follow the
legal progress of a democratic way of life." It took notice of the
commercial and industrial development along E. delos Santos
Avenue and found the resolution a valid exercise of police
power.
On the non-impairment of contracts issue, the Court found
the resolution a "legitimate response to a felt public need. The
non-impairment clause may not bar the municipality's exercise
of police power. The Court also reiterated the Phil-Am Life Ins.

1.
The Philippine Gamefowl Commission cannot directly
exercise the power to license cockpits which in effect usurps the
authority directly conferred by law on the municipal authorities.
PHILIPPINE GAMEFOWL COMMISSION v. IAC
146 SCRA 294, December 17, 1986, Cruz, J.
Facts: This case involves a conflict if jurisdiction between
the Philippine Gamefowl Commission and the municipal
government of Bogo, Cebu, both of which claim the power to
issue licenses for the operation of cockpits in the said town.
Held: According to the Local Government Code, the
municipal mayor has the power to "grant licenses and permits
in accordance with existing laws and municipal ordinances and
revoke them for violation of the conditions upon which they
have been granted," and the Sangguniang Bayan is authorized
to "regulate cockpits, cockfighting and the keeping or training
of gamecocks, subject to existing guidelines promulgated by
the Philippine Gamefowl Commission."
A study of the above-cited powers shows that it is the
municipal mayor with the authorization of the Sangguniang
Bayan that has the primary power to issue licenses for the
operation of ordinary cockpits. Even the regulation of cockpits
is vested in the municipal officials, subject only to the guidelines

768

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

laid down by the Philippine Gamefowl Commission. Its power
is limited only to international derbies and does not extend to
ordinary cockpits. Over the latter kind of cockpits, it has the
power not of control but only of review and supervision.
The power of supervision does not allow the supervisor
to annul the acts of the subordinate, for that comes under
the power of control. What it can do only is to see to it that
the subordinate performs his duties in accordance with law.
The power of review is exercised to determine whether it is
necessary to correct the acts of the subordinate.
Even the powerofreviewvested in the Philippine Gamefowl
Commission by P.D. 1802-A may have been modified by the
Local Government Code, which becomes effective on February
14, 1983. Under the Code, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan
is suppose (sic) to examine the ordinances, resolutions and
Executive Orders issued by the municipal government and to
annul the game, but only on one ground, to wit, that it is beyond
the powers of the municipality or ultra vires. Significantly, no
similar authority is conferred in such categorical terms on the
Philippine Gamefowl Commission regarding the licensing and
regulation cockpits by the municipal government.
In ordering the respondent municipal officials to cancel
the mayor's permit in favor of Santiago A. Sevilla and to issue
another one in favor of Acusar, the PGC was exercising not
the powers of supervision and review but the power of control,
which had not been conferred upon it.
2.
There being noorclinance allowing in general the operation
of cockpit, Resolution No. 049, S. 1998, authorizing petitioner to
establish, operate and maintain a cockpit in Bula, Camarines Sur
cannot be implemented. To compel respondent to issue the mayor's
permit would not only be a violation of the explicit provisions
of Section 447 of the Local Government Code of 1991, but would
also be an undue encroachment on respondent's administrative
prerogatives.

authorizing petitioner Rolando N. Canet to establish, operate

Title Two The Municipality

769

and maintain a cockpit in Sitio, Cabaya, San Roque, Bula,
Camarines Sur.
Subsequently, the Sangguniang Bayan passed Orclinance
No. 001, Series of 1999, entitled "An Ordinance Regulating the
Operation of Cockpits and Other Related Game-Fowl Activities
in the Municipality of Bula, Camarines Sur and Providing
Penalties for any Violation to (sic) the Provisions Thereof."
Upon transmittal to respondent Mayor Julieta A. Decena of
the said municipality, it was noted that the Ordinance does not
contain rules and regulations on cockfighting and other related
game fowl activities and a separability clause. The Ordinance
was returned to the Sangguniang Bayan. In Resolution No.
078, Series of 1999, Sangguniang Bayan resolved to withdraw,
set aside and shelf indefinitely Ordinance No. 001, Series of
1999.
Meanwhile, petitioner, relying on Resolution No. 049,
Series of 1998, of the Sangguniang Bayan, filed an application
for a mayor's permit to operate, establish and maintain a cockpit
in Sitio Cabuya, San Roque, Bula, Camarines Sur. Respondent
Mayor Julieta Decena denied the application on the ground,
among others, that under the Local Government Code of 1991,
the authority to give licenses for the establishment, operation
and maintenance of cockpits as well as the regulation of
cockfighting and commercial breeding of gamecocks is vested
in the Sangguniang Bayan.
Therefore, she cannot issue the said permit inasmuch
as there was no ordinance passed by the Sangguniang Bayan
authorizing the same.
On July 26, 1999, petitioner filed a complaint against
respondent Mayor with the RTC of Pili, Camarines Sur,
which was docketed as Special Civil Action No. P-84-99, for
Mandamus and Damages with Application for Preliminary
Mandatory Injunction.
Ruling: The pertinent provision of law in contention is
Section 447 (a) (3) (v) of the Local Government Code of 1991
(Republic Act No. 7160), which provides for the powers of the
Sangguniang Bayan, to wit:

existing rights should not be prejudiced.
Petitioner admits that there is no ordinance in Bula,
Camarines Sur which authorizes the grant of a mayor's permit
to operate and maintain a cockfighting arena. However, he
invokes Resolution No. 049, S. 1998, wherein the Sangguniang
Bayan authorized him to operate a cockpit. Furthermore, he
cites Municipal Tax Ordinances Nos. 01, S. 1989, and 05, S.
1993, which generally provide for the issuance of a mayor's
permit for the operation of businesses.
Municipal Tax Ordinances Nos. 01, S. 1989 and 05, S.
1993 contain general provisions for the issuance of business
permits but do not contain specific provisions prescribing the
reasonable fees to be paid in the operation of cockpits and other
game fowl activities.
It was Ordinance No. 001, S. 1999 which provided for
the collection of application filing fees, ocular inspection fees,
mayor's permit fees, filing fees for the institution of complaints,
entrance fees and special derby assessments for the operation
of cockpits. This Ordinance, however, was withdrawn by the

TAN v. PERENA

Facts: On 8 November 1995, petitioner Leonardo Tan
(Tan) applied with the Municipal Gamefowl Commission for the
issuance of a permitllicense to establish and operate a cockpit
in Sitio Combado, Bagay, in Daanbantayan, Cebu Province. At
the time of his application, there was already another cockpit
in operation in Daanbantayan, operated by respondent Socorro
Y. Perefia (Perefia), who was the duly franchised and licensed
cockpit operator in the municipality since the 1970s. Perefia's
franchise, per records, was valid until 2002.
The Municipal Gamefowl Commission favorably
recommended to the mayor of Daanbantayan, petitioner
Lamberto Te (Te), that a permit be issued to Tan. On 20 January
1996, Te issued a mayor's permit allowing Tan "to establish/
operate/conduct" the business of a cockpit in Combado, Bagay,
Daanbantayan, Cebu for the period from 20 January 1996 to
31 December 1996.

There being in effect no ordinance allowing the operation
of a cockpit, Resolution No. 049, S. 1998, authorizing petitioner
to establish, operate and maintain a cockpit in Bula, Camarines
Sur cannot be implemented. Suffice it to state in this regard
that to compel respondent to issue the mayor's permit would
not only be a violation of the explicit provisions of Section
447 of the Local Government Code of 1991, but would also
be an undue encroachment on respondent's administrative
prerogatives.

This act of the mayor served as cause for Perefia to file
a Complaint for damages with a prayer for injunction against
Tan, Te, and Roberto Uy, the latter allegedly an agent of
Tan. Perefia alleged that there was no lawful basis for the
establishment of a second cockpit.

Even on the assumption that there is in fact a legislative
gap caused by such an omission, neither could the Court
presume otherwise and supply the details thereof, because a
legislative lacuna cannot be filled by judicial fiat.

(v) Any law to the contrary notwithstanding, authorize
and license the establishment, operation, and maintenance of

prejudiced;

The petition is hereby DENIED.

While the sanggunian retains the power to authorize and

In arguing that Section 5(b) of the Cockfighting Law
has been repealed, petitioners cite the following provisions of
Section 447(a)(3)(v) of the Local Government Code:

Ruling: Is the one-cockpit-per-municipality rule under
the Cockfighting Law clearly and convincingly irreconcilable
with Section 447(a)(3)(v) of the Local Government Code? The
clear import of Section 447(a)(3)(v) is that it is the sangguniang

772

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

bayan which is empowered to authorize and license the
establishment, operation and maintenance of cockpits, and
regulate cockfighting and commercial breeding of gamecocks,
notwithstanding any law to the contrary. The necessity of the
qualifying phrase "any law to the contrary notwithstanding"
can be discerned by examining the history of laws pertaining to
the authorization of cockpit operation in this country.
Given the historical perspective, it becomes evident
why the legislature found the need to use the phrase "any
law to the contrary notwithstanding" in Section 447(a)(3)v).
However, does the phrase similarly allow the Sangguniang
Bayan to authorize more cockpits than allowed under Section
6(d) of the Cockfighting Law? Certainly, applying the test of
implied repeal, these two provisions can stand together. While
the sanggunian retains the power to authorize and license
the establishment, operation, and maintenance of cockpits,
its discretion is limited in that it cannot authorize more than
one cockpit per city or municipality, unless such cities or
municipalities have a population of over one hundred thousand,
in which case two cockpits may be established. Considering
that Section 447(a)(3)(v) speaks essentially of the identity of
the wielder of the power of control and supervision over cockpit
operation, it is not inconsistent with previous enactments that
impose restrictions on how such power may be exercised. In
short, there is no dichotomy between affirming the power and
subjecting it to limitations at the same time.
A municipal ordinance must not contravene the
Constitution or any statute, otherwise it is void. Ordinance
No. 7 unmistakably contravenes the Cockfighting Law in
allowing three cockpits in Daanbantayan. Thus, no rights can
be asserted by the petitioners arising from the Ordinance.
The petition is DENIED.
4.
Under Section 447(a)(3)(v) of the LGC, it is the
Sangguniang Bayan which is empowered to "authorize and license
the establishment, operation and maintenance of cockpits, and
regulate cockfighting and commercial breeding of gamecocks."
"A license authorizing the operation and exploitation of a cockpit
is not property of which the holder may not be deprived without
due process of law, but a mere privilege that may be revoked when

public interests so require." Having said that, petitioner's allegation
that he was deprived of due process has no leg to stand on.
DUv.JAYOMA
670 SCRA 333, April 23, 2012, Del Castillo, J.
Facts: On July 7, 1988, the Sangguniang Bayan of the
Municipality of Mabini, Bohol, enacted Municipal Ordinance
No. 1, series of 1988, requiring the conduct of a public bidding
for the operation of a cockpit in the said municipality every
four years.
For the period January 1, 1989 to December 31, 1992,
the winning bidder was Engr. Edgardo Carabuena. However,
due to his failure to comply with the legal requirements for
operating a cockpit, the Sangguniang Bayan on December 1,
1988 adopted Resolution No. 127, series of 1988, authorizing
petitioner Danilo Du to continue his cockpit operation until the
winning bidder complies with the legal requirements.
On July 9, 1997, upon discovering that petitioner has been
operating his cockpit in violation of Municipal Ordinance No.
1, series of 1988, the Sangguniang Bayan passed Municipal
Resolution No. 065, series of 1997, suspending petitioner's
cockpit operation effective upon approval.
Ruling: Even if petitioner Du was able to get a business
permit from respondent mayor for the period January 1,
1997 to December 31, 1997, this did not give him a license to
operate a cockpit. Under Section 447(a)(3)(v) of the LGC, it
is the Sangguniang Bayan which is empowered to "authorize
and license the establishment, operation and maintenance of
cockpits, and regulate cockfighting and commercial breeding
of gamecocks." Considering that no public bidding was
conducted for the operation of a cockpit from January 1, 1993
to December 31, 1997, petitioner cannot claim that he was
duly authorized by the Sangguniang Bayan to operate his
cockpit in the municipality for the period January 1, 1997 to
December 31, 1997. Respondent members of the Sangguniang
Bayan, therefore, had every reason to suspend the operation
of petitioner's cockpit by enacting Municipal Resolution No.
065, series of 1997. As the chief executive of the municipal
government, respondent mayor was duty-bound to enforce the
suspension of the operation of petitioner's cockpit pursuant to
the said Resolution.

A license to operate a cockpit is a mere privilege. In
addition, it is well enshrined in our jurisprudence that "a
license authorizing the operation and exploitation of a cockpit
is not property of which the holder may not be deprived
without due process of law, but a mere privilege that may be
revoked when public interests so require." Having said that,
petitioner's allegation that he was deprived of due process has

Decided Case

1.
While municipal councils have the power to declare and
abate a nuisance, they do not have the power to find as a fact a
particular thing as a nuisance when such thing is not a nuisance per
se. Such determination may only be decided by courts of law.
ILOILO ICE & COLD STORAGE CO. v. MUNICIPAL
COUNCIL OF ILOILO
24 Phil. 471, March 26, 1913, Trent, J.
Facts: Plaintiff constructed an ice and cold storage in
the Municipality of Iloilo under the authority granted by the
municipal council. Subsequently, certain residents complained
to the municipal council that the smoke emitted by the plant
is injurious to their health and comfort. The municipal council
created a committee to investigate the subject of the complaint.
Upon receipt of the report of the committee that the
complaint was well-founded, the municipal council passed a
resolution directing the plaintiff to proceed with the elevation
of its smokestack within one month, and if not done. the
municipal president will execute the order requiring the closing
or suspension of operations of said establishment. Thereupon,
plaintiff instituted an action to enjoin defendants from carrying
out said resolution.
Held: It is clear that municipal councils have, under
the Municipal Code, the power to declare and abate nuisance,
but it is equally clear that they do not have the power to find
as a fact that a particular thing is a nuisance when such
thing is not a nuisance per se. Nor they can authorize the
extrajudicial condemnation and destruction of that thing as
a nuisance which in its nature, situation or use is not such.
These things must be determined in the ordinary courts of
law, the determination being a question of fact. The question
of nuisance can conclusively be decided, for all legal purposes,
by the established courts of law or equity alone, and that the
officers, or boards organized by force of municipal charters,
cannot, to any degree, control such decision.
In the case at bar, it is certain that the ice factory, of the
plaintiff is not a nuisance per se. It is a legitimate industry,

776

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

beneficial to the people, and conducive to their health and
comfort. If it be in fact a nuisance due to the manner of its
operation, that question cannot be determined by a mere
resolution of the municipal council. The petitioner is entitled
to a fair and impartial hearing before a judicial tribunal.
Resolution of the municipal council is declared invalid being
enacted beyond the municipal council's powers.

Decided Cases

1.
The Municipality of Cebu has the right to enact ordinances
relating to sanitation and public health. Absent any evidence
that the defendant was treated differently from the others in the
application of the ordinance, the same shall be deemed valid.
U.S. v. ABENDAN
24 PI. 165, January 24, 1913, Moreland, J.
Facts: Art. 6 of the Municipal ordinance of Cebu, as
amended provides: "It shall be the duty of the owner, agent, or
other person in possession and in control of any lot, building,
or place, declared to be in bad sanitary condition by the chief
sanitary officer, or his representative, to comply with any order
duly issued in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance,
requiring repairs, improvements, alterations, or necessary
construction, or to put the place designated in sanitary
condition within the time specified in said order."
Appellant was convicted for a violation of said ordinance
for his refusal to comply with the order issued by the department
of sanitation to make certain repairs and perform certain
works which were of great necessity for the preservation of the

Book III - Local Government Units
Title Two- The Municipality

777

sanitary condition of said house. Appellant claimed that the
ordinance is unreasonable and oppressive.
Held: Paragraph jj, Sec. 39 of the Municipal Code
provides: "Make such ordinances and regulations not repugnant
to law, as may be necessary to carry into effect and discharge
the powers and duties conferred by this Act, and such as it
shall deem necessary and proper to provide for the health and
safety, promote the prosperity, improve the morals, peace,
good order, comfort, and convenience of the municipality and
its inhabitants, and for the protection of property therein; and
enforce obedience thereto with such lawful fines or penalties as
the municipal council may prescribe."
The municipality of Cebu, as is seen from the quotation
of the general municipal law, has the right to enact ordinances
relating to sanitation and public health. The ordinance as set
out is an enactment clearly within the purview of the statute
authorizing it.
From the evidence of the case, it does not appear that the
defendant was treated differently from other persons in the
locality, or that he was required to do a thing that the others
had not been required to do, or that he had in any way been
discriminated against in the application of the ordinance, or
that its application was oppressive or unreasonable to him.
The ordinance in question is valid. The City of Cebu at
the time the ordinance was enacted had full authority from the
legislature to enact an ordinance upon the subject embraced
within it.
2.
The ordinance of the City of Manila regulating the use of
sewers and drains in the city is a valid exercise of police power.

Facts: Case is the owner of a certain house within

very bad, and he was directed to make connections with the
new sewer system. He failed to comply. The service of notices

plaintiff was made in compliance with the ordinance of the

offensive to public health and decency, and this is really what
Subsection (1) of Sec. 39 of the Municipal Code amounts to.

Held: The particular ordinance, now under consideration,
was clearly designed to preserve and protect the health,
comfort, and convenience of the inhabitants of the thickly
populated City of Manila, and therefore, in its scope, falls
directly under what is generally known as the police power of
the government.

'There is no provision in the Municipal Code which

U.S. v. GASPAY
33 Phil. 96, December 24, 1915, Araullo, J.
Facts: The Municipality of Pastrana, Leyte passed
Ordinance No. 87 which provided that every owner of a lot
situated in front of a municipal street should periodically, or
every 15 days, clear 1/2 of the street lying in front of and parallel
with his lot. Defendant was twice charged and convicted with
violation of said ordinance for refusing to clean 1/2 of the street
lying in front of and parallel with his lot for more than 15 days,
which half of the street was then overgrown with weeds and in
an unsanitary condition.
Held: There is no provision in the Municipal Code
which authorizes municipal councils to force residents of a
municipality to clean any part of a public street in front of their
respective properties, or which empowers municipal councils
to enact ordinances to that effect. The provisions of Sec. 39 6)
(1) of said Code do not warrant the inference that municipal
councils possess those powers, or that they are authorized to
impose that obligation upon the residents of the municipality.
The duty of cleaning the streets and public squares and
maintaining them in a cleanly and sanitary condition is a
public service which devolves upon the municipal council to
provide and perform either by administration, lease, or by
some other means. It is a duty and power which is related to
that of the same municipal council to punish, by means of the
proper municipal ordinances, those persons who convert the

ASS'N v. CITY MAYOR OF MANILA
20 SCRA 849, July 31, 1967, Fernando, J.
Facts: The Municipal Board of Manila enacted an
ordinance which increased the license fee for motels; requires
any person who enters any motel, hotel, or lodging houses to

780

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Book III Local Government Units
Title Two -- The Municipality

fill up a form prescribed in a lobby open to public view; provides
that the premises of such hotels should be open for inspection
by the City Mayor or authorized representative; prohibits
any person less than 18 years old from being accepted in such
hotels unless accompanied by parents; and makes it unlawful
for such establishments to lease any room or portion thereof
more than twice every 24 hours. Petitioner, a corporation of 18
members, questions the validity of the ordinance claiming it to
be violative of the due process clause of the Constitution.
Held: A police measure specially aimed to safeguard
public morals is immune from any imputation of nullity
that, on its face, it is fatally defective as being repugnant to
the due process clause of the Constitution, resting purely on
conjecture and unsupported by anything of substance. To hold
otherwise would be to unduly restrict and narrow the scope
of police power, which has been properly characterized as the
most essential, insistent, and the least !imitable of powers,
extending as it does to all the great public needs.
The challenged ordinance was precisely enacted to
minimize the alarming increase of the rate of prostitution,
adultery, and fornication in Manila traceable in part to the
existence of motels, which provides a necessary atmosphere
for clandestine entry, presence and exit and thus become the
ideal haven for prostitutes and thrill seekers. The challenged
ordinance then proposes to check the clandestine harboring of
transient and guest by requiring them to fill up a form in a lobby
open to public view, shattering the privacy that characterizes
the registration of transient and guest. With its commendable
purpose, the ordinance is within the police power of the City of
Manila.

The law in question reads partly:

"Sec. 1. The municipal or city board or council of each chartered
city and the municipal council of each municipality and municipal
district shall have the power to regulate or prohibit by ordinance,
the establishment, maintenance and operation of nightclubs,
cabarets, dancing schools, pavilions, cockpits, bars, saloons, bowling
alleys, billiard pools and other similar places of amusement within
its territorial jurisdictions: Provided, however, That no such places
of amusement mentioned herein shall be established, maintained
and/or operated within a radius of five hundred lineal meters from
any public buildings, schools, hospitals and churches." (Provincial
Governor of Rizal v. Encarnacion, 96 Phil. 967.)
As the records show beyond doubt that the building of the
Tropical Night Spot stands less than five hundred meters from three
public schools, it may not be reopened for business without violating
the above statutory enactment. (Ibid.)
2.
A local government council cannot prohibit the
establishment of nightclubs and cabarets. It may regulate their
operations. (De la Cruz v. Paras, 123 SCRA 569.)
Judiciary may set aside legislation which clearly invades
personal or property rights, e.g., prohibition on establishment of
cabarets, dance halls, and nightclubs. Where title of a law empowers
a local council to regulate places of amusement, its amendment to

title would give rise to a constitutional question on titling of bills.

Bayan cannot prohibit establishment of cabarets. (Ibid.)

PHYSICAL THERAPY ORGANIZATION OF THE
PHILIPPINES v. MUNICIPAL BOARD OF MANILA
101 Phil. 1142, August 30, 1957, Montemayor, J.
Facts: The Municipal Board of Manila promulgated
an ordinance regulating the operation of massage clinics in
Manila. Petitioner files an action questioning the validity of
said ordinance on the ground that it restricts the practice of
licensed massagists, and that the City of Manila is without
authority to regulate the operation of massage clinics, said
authority being withdrawn from it and vested in the Director
of Health, who exercises supervision over the practice of
massage. Petitioners also alleged that the licensed fee of P1OO
for the operation of massage clinic is unreasonable. Judgment
for respondent; hence, this appeal.
Held: The purpose of the ordinance is not to regulate
the practice of massage, much less to restrict the practice of
such persons. The end sought to be obtained is to prevent the
commission of the immorality and the practice of prostitution in
an establishment masquerading as a massage clinic where the
operation thereof offers to massage or manipulate superficial
parts of the bodies of customers for hygienic or aesthetic
purposes.
The Charter of Manila gives legislative powers to the
Board of Manila to enact all ordinances it may deem necessary
and proper for the promotion of the morality, peace, and good
order of the city as well as its inhabitants, especially the general
welfare. This is generally referred to as the general welfare
clause, a delegation in statutory form of the police power, under

the morality, peace, and general welfare of its inhabitants.

in other operations. However, much discretion is given to
municipal corporations in determining the amount of the said
fee without considering it as a tax for revenue purposes.

PRIMICIAS v. MUNICIPALITY OF URDANETA
93 SCRA 462, October 18, 1979, De Castro, J.
Facts: Plaintiff was charged with violating an ordinance
which prescribed a speed limit for vehicular traffic of 20
kilometers per hour through crowded streets approaching
intersections at blind corners passing school zones or thickly
populated areas. Plaintiff filed an action for the annulment of
the ordinance on the ground that it is contrary to the Land
Transportation and Traffic Code.
Held: An essential requisite for an ordinance to be valid is
that it must not contravene the law. The Land Transportation
and Traffic Code prescribes the speed limits depending on
the classification of streets and on the type of vehicle. The
ordinance mentions only one of the four classifications of its
streets. Under the Land Transportation and Traffic Code,
a municipal council intending to regulate traffic is supposed
to classify the streets first and mark them with proper signs,
with the approval of the Land Transportation Commissioner.
In this case, there is no showing such approval was secured.
Besides, the ordinance does not distinguish between passenger
cars and motorcycles on one hand and motor trucks and buses
on the other hand. The Land Transportation and Traffic Code
specifies the speed limit for each kind of vehicle.
The ordinance contravened Republic Act No. 4136, the
Land Transportation and Traffic Code. Municipal Ordinances
being inferior in status and subordinate to the laws of the State,
they must give way whenever they conflict with a statute. The
municipality did not make any classification of thoroughfares
as required by the Code and imposed a speed limit without
regard as to whether or not the thoroughfare was an open
country road, a through street or boulevard, a municipal street

786

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

with light traffic, or a crowded street approaching intersections
at blind corners, passing school zones or stationary vehicles-the
four classifications in the Code, each with a different speed
limit. Unlike the Code, the ordinance lumped up all vehicles
indiscriminately. The municipality also failed to have its control
over public highways approved by the Land Transportation
Commissioner.
The ordinance was a speed trap for unwary motorists for
which Urdaneta had become notorious.

To be valid and enforceable, an ordinance regulating
land transportation and traffic rules should comply with the prerequisites under Section 38 of R.A. 4136. Here, these pre-requisites

3, 2014, enacted Ordinance No. 688, Series of 2014, known as
the "Speed Limit Ordinance." It prescribes speed limits for
all types of vehicles traversing this stretch of the national
highway, viz.:

speeding. He was running at seventy kilometers per hour
(70 kph) along the expanse of the highway bordering Crossing
Acmonan to Crossing Cebuano which had a maximum speed
set of 40 kph per the Ordinance. He was fined Php1,000.00
which he paid under protest.
Two (2) days later, on October 8, 2014, respondent filed
before the RTC Polomolok, South Cotabato, a petition for
declaratory relief, annulment of the Speed Limit Ordinance,
and damages, with prayer for temporary restraining order.
Ruling: RA No. 4136, the Land Transportation and
Traffic Code, relevantly states:
Section 35. Restriction as to Speed. -(b) Subject to the provisions of the preceding
paragraph the rate of speed of any Motor vehicle shall not
exceed the following:

second offense, and fine of Php2,000.00 or thirty (30)-day
imprisonment or both for the third offense.

Section 38. Classification of Highways. -- Public
highways shall be properly classified for traffic purposes
by the provincial board, municipal board or city council
having jurisdiction over them, and said provincial board,
municipal board or city council shall provide appropriate
signs therefor, subject to the approval ofthe Commissioner.
It shall be the duty of every provincial, city and municipal
secretary to certify to the Commissioner the names,
locations, and limits of all "through streets" designated as
such by the provincial board, municipal board or council.
To be valid and enforceable, an ordinance regulating
land transportation and traffic rules should comply with the
following prerequisites under Section 38 of RA No. 4136:
(1) The LGU must first classify its public highways
according to the categorization provided in Section 35 of
RA No. 4136;
(2) The public highways, after having been
classified, must be specially marked. Logically, such
markings must be visible to the public;
(3) The secretary of the local government unit
shall certify to the Land Transportation Office the names,
locations and limits of all "through streets" designated as
such by the respective local government unit's legislative
body;
(4) The classification of public highways and
posting signs must both be approved by the Land
Transportation Office.
Here, these prerequisites were altogether not complied
with insofar as Ordinance No. 688 is concerned.
We revisit our Decision in the strikingly similar case of

Primicias v. the Municipality of Urdaneta, Pangasinan,
182 Phil. 42 (1979). In that case, We affirmed the ruling of

Book III

Title Two - The Municipality

789

the Court of First Instance of Lingayen, Pangasinan which
declared void the ordinance passed by the Municipality of
Urdaneta which prescribes speed limits along the national
highways within its jurisdiction. We affirmed the nullity of the
ordinance because of its failure to comply with the prerequisites
of classification of streets, posting of signs, and approval by the
LTO, as provided in RA No. 4136.
We adhere to the hierarchy of legal rules-municipal
ordinances are inferior in status and subordinate to the laws of
the State. Thus, in case of conflict between an ordinance and a
statute, the ordinance must be set aside. So must it be.
The petition for review on certiorari is DENIED.

maintenance and repair of an efficient

Facts: Petitioners assail the constitutionality of R.A.
7675, "An Act Converting the Municipality of Mandaluyong
into a Highly Urbanized City to be known as the City of
Mandaluyong." (February 9, 1994.)
Prior to the enactment of the assailed statute, the

congressional representative of this legislative district,

they had nothing to do with the change of status of neighboring
Mandaluyong.
The petition is DISMISSED.

Pursuant to R.A. 7160, a plebiscite was held on April 10,
1994. The people ofMandaluyong ratified the law.

SEC. 450. Requisites for Creation.
(a) A
municipality or a cluster of barangays may be
converted into a component city if it has an average
annual income, as certified by the Department
of Finance, of at least Twenty million pesos
(P20,000,000.00) for the last two (2) consecutive
years based on 1991 constant prices, and if it has
either of the following requisites:

Petitioners now come before this Court, contending that
R.A. No. 7675, specifically Article VIII, Section 49 thereof, is
unconstitutional for being violative of the Constitution.
Held: Contrary to petitioners' assertion, the creation of a
separate congressional district for Mandaluyong is not a subject
separate and distinct from the subject of its conversion into a
highly urbanized city but is a natural and logical consequence
of its conversion into a highly urbanized city. Verily, the title
of R.A. No. 7675. "An Act Converting the Municipality of
Mandaluyong Into a Highly Urbanized City of Mandaluyong"
necessarily includes and contemplates the subject treated
under Section 49 regarding the creation of a separate
congressional district for Mandaluyong. There is no violation
of the "one-subject-one bill" rule under the Constitution.

(i) a contiguous territory of at least one
hundred (100) square kilometers, as certified
by the Lands Management Bureau; or
(ii) a population of not less than one
hundred fifty thousand (P150,000) inhabitants,
as certified by the National Statistics Office:
Provided, That, the creation thereof shall not
reduce the land area, population, and income of the
original unit or units at the time of said creation
to less than the minimum requirements prescribed
herein.

Proceeding now to the other constitutional issues raised
by petitioners to the effect that there is no mention in the
assailed law of any census to show that Mandaluyong and San
Juan had each attained the minimum requirement of 250,000
inhabitants to justify their separation into two legislative
districts, the same does not suffice to strike down the validity
of R.A. No. 7675. The said Act enjoys the presumption of having
passed through the regular congressional processes, including
due consideration by the members of Congress of the minimum
requirements for the establishment of separate legislative
districts. At any rate, it is not required that all laws emanating
from the legislature must contain all relevant data considered
by Congress in the enactment of said laws.
Petitioners contend that the people of San Juan should
have been made to participate in the plebiscite on R.A. No.
7675 as the same involved a change in their legislative district.
The contention is bereft of merit since the principal subject
involved in the plebiscite was the conversion of Mandaluyong
into a highly urbanized city. The matter of separate district
representation was only ancillary thereto. Thus, the inhabitants
of San Juan were properly excluded from the said plebiscite as

not apply where the city proposed to be created is

more islands.

the income accruing to the general fund, exclusive
of special funds, transfers, and non-recurring
income.

R.A. 9009 (February 24, 2001) provides:

SECTION 1. Section 450 of Republic Act No. 7160,
otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991, is
hereby amended to read as follows:

this Act and every three (3) years thereafter, the threshold
amount of Four hundred million pesos (P400,000,000.00) shall
be increased by five percent (5%).

"Section 450. Requisites for Creation.- (a) A
municipality or a cluster of barangays may be converted
into a component city if it has a locally generated average
annual income, as certified by the Department of Finance,
of at least One hundred million pesos (P100,000,000.00)

R.A. 11683 (April 10, 2022) further amends Section 450,
LGC as amended by R.A. 9009.
The main amendments of R.A. 11683 are:
1.
"A municipality or a cluster of barangays with a
locally generated average annual income, as certified by the
Department of Finance, of at least Four hundred million
pesos (P400,000,000.00) for the last two (2) consecutive years
based on 2012 constant prices may also be converted into a

conversion into cityhood."
B.

Comments

Under R.A. 9009 (February 24, 2001), income for conversion
into a component city was increased from P20,000,000.00 to
Pl00,000,000.00. It is required that there shall be a contiguous
territory of at least 100 square kilometers or a population of not less
than 150,000 inhabitants.
Under R.A. 11683 (April 10, 2022), which further amends Sec.
450, LGC, as amended by R.A. 9009, a municipality or a cluster of
barangays with locally generated average annual income of at least
P400,000,000.00 may also be converted into a component city if it has
either a population of at least 100,000 inhabitants or a contiguous
territory of at least 100 hundred square kilometers.
C.

Decided Cases

1.
Internal Revenue Allotments are items of income because
they form part of the gross accretion of funds of the local government
unit. They are included in computing the average annual income
required to become a city.
ALVAREZ v. GUINGONA
252 SCRA 695, January 31, 1996,
Hermosisima, Jr., J.
Facts: Of main concern to the petitioners is whether

R.A. 7720 is constitutionally infirm. R.A. 7720 is entitled "An
Act Converting the Municipality of Santiago, lsabela into
an Independent Component City to be known as the City of
Santiago." Petitioners claim that the Municipality of Santiago
has not met the minimum average annual income required
under Sec. 450 of the Local Government Code.
Petitioners asseverate that the Internal Revenue
Allotments are not actually income but merely transfers and/

798

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

or budgetary aid from the national government and that they
fluctuate, increase, or decrease, depending on factors like
population, land, and equal sharing. Hence, the certification
issued by the Bureau of Local Government Finance of the
Department of Finance, which indicates Santiago's average
annual income to be Php 20,974,581.97 is inaccurate as the
Internal Revenue Allotments were not excluded from the
computation.
Held: Petitioners asseverations are untenable because
IRA's form part of the income of Local Government Units.
The funds generated by LGU's from local taxes, IRA's and
national wealth utilization proceeds accrue to the general fund
of the local government and are used to finance its operations
subject to specified modes of spending the same as provided in
the Local Government Code and its implementing Rules and
Regulations. For instance, not less than twenty percent (20%)
of the IRA's must be set aside for local development projects.
As such, for purposes of budgetary preparation, which budget
should reflect the estimates of the income of the LGU, among
others, the IRA's and the share in the national utilization
proceeds are considered items of income.
This is as it should be, since income is defined in the Local
Government Code to be all revenues and receipts collected or
received forming the gross accretions of funds of the LGU. The
IRA's are items of income because they form part of the gross
accretion of the funds of the LGU. The IRA's regularly and
automatically accrue to the local treasury without need of any
further action on the part of the LGU. They thus constitute
income which the local government can invariably rely upon as
the source of much needed funds.
2.
The 16 Cityhood Bills do not violate Article X, Section
10 of the Constitution. Congress saw the wisdom of exempting
respondent municipalities from complying with the higher income
requirement of P100,000,000.00 imposed by the amendatory
R.A. 9009.
LEAGUE OF CITIES OF THE PHILIPPINES v.
COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
658 Phil. 275, February 15, 2011, Bersamin, J.
Facts: These cases were initiated by the consolidated
petitions for prohibition filed by the League of Cities of the

Book III - Local Government Unite
Tile Three The City

799

Philippines (LCP), City of Iloilo, City of Calbayog, and Jerry
P. Treiias, assailing the constitutionality of the sixteen (16)
laws, each converting the municipality covered thereby into
a component city (Cityhood Laws), and seeking to enjoin
the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) from conducting
plebiscites pursuant to the subject laws.
Ruling: Prior to the amendment under R.A. 9009
(June 30, 2001), Section 450 of the LGC required only an average
annual income, as certified by the Department of Finance, of
at least P20,000,000.00 for the last two (2) consecutive years,
based on 1991 constant prices.
Clearly, based on the exchanges in the Senate
deliberations, Congress intended that those with pending
cityhood bills during the 11th Congress would not be covered
by the new and higher income requirement of PlO0 million
imposed by RA. 9009.
The exemption clauses found in the individual Cityhood
Laws are the express articulation of that intent to exempt
respondent municipalities from the coverage of R.A. No. 9009.
Even if we were to ignore the exchange between then
Senate President Drilon and Senator Pimentel, it cannot be
denied that Congress saw the wisdom of exempting respondent
municipalities from complying with the higher income
requirement imposed by the amendatory R.A. No. 9009.
Indeed, these municipalities have proven themselves viable
and capable to become component cities of their respective
provinces. It is also acknowledged that they were centers of
trade and commerce, points of convergence of transportation,
rich havens of agricultural, mineral, and other natural
resources, and flourishing tourism spots.
Undeniably, R.A. No. 9009 amended the LGC. But it is
also true that, in effect, the Cityhood Laws amended R.A. No.
9009 through the exemption clauses found therein. Since the
Cityhood Laws explicitly exempted the concerned municipalities
from the amendatory R.A. No. 9009, such Cityhood Laws are,
therefore, also amendments to the LGC itself. For this reason,
we reverse the November 18, 2008 Decision and the August 24,
2010 Resolution on their strained and stringent view that the
Cityhood Laws, particularly their exemption clauses, are not
found in the LGC.

the National Statistics Office, and with the latest
annual income of at least Fifty Million Pesos
(P50,000,000.00) based on 1991 constant prices, as
certified by the city treasurer, shall be classified as
highly urbanized cities.

Indeed, substantial distinction lies in the capacity and
viability of respondent municipalities to become component
cities of their respective provinces. Congress, by enacting
the Cityhood Laws, recognized this capacity and viability of
respondent municipalities to become the State's partners in
accelerating economic growth and development in the provincial
regions, which is the very thrust of the LGC, manifested by the
pendency of their cityhood bills during the 11th Congress and
their relentless pursuit for cityhood up to the present. Truly,
the urgent need to become a component city arose way back in
the 11th Congress, and such condition continues to exist.

(b) Cities which do not meet the above
requirements shall be considered component cities
of the province in which they are geographically
located. If a component city is located within the
boundaries of two (2) or more provinces, such city
shall be considered a component of the province of
which it is used to be a municipality.

WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration of
the "Resolution" dated August 24, 2010, dated and filed on

CENIZA v. COMELEC
95 SCRA 763, January 28, 1980, Concepcion, J.
Facts: Batas Big. 51 called for the election of local officials
on Jan. 30, 1980 and, in connection therewith, classified
chartered cities into "highly urbanized" and "component"
cities on the basis of their regular income (P40 million). The

residents, as the requirement in Art. XI, Sec. 2 of the 1973
Constitution is prospective in character.

registered voters of component cities could vote in the election
of the province of which that city is a component if their charter
so provided, while voters in the highly urbanized cities were not
allowed to participate or vote in the elections of the province in
which such cities are located.

(4) Neither can Batas Blg. 51 and the Charter
of Mandaue be said to be enacted for a gerrymandering
purpose. "Gerrymandering"is a term employed to describe
an apportionment of representative districts so contrived
as to give an unfair advantage to a party in power. The
statutes here do not involve an apportionment. Nor has
it been shown that the exclusion of voters in the affected
cities give an unfair advantage of candidates of the party
in power. As the Solicitor General has pointed out, it may
even be that the majority of the city voters thus excluded
are supporters of the administration candidates.

Cebu City, with an income P51,603,147.64, was classified
as a highly urbanized city, while Mandaue, with Jess than P40
million income was classified as a component city, the voters
of which, because of its charter provisions, were not allowed to
vote in the elections of Cebu Province.
Petitioners, as taxpayers and registered voters of Cebu and
Mandaue cities, filed an action for prohibition and mandamus
and sought to stop the election in the affected provinces or to
allow voters to vote in provincial elections. They contended
that: (1) the classification of cities in the basis of income was
unreasonable; (2) that the voters were deprived of the right to
participate in the affairs of the government of the provinces;
(3) that the charter of Mandaue had not been ratified in a
plebiscite by the local residents; and (4) that the statutes in
question were enacted for a gerrymandering purpose.
Held: (1) The classification of cities in Batas Blg. 51 is
based on substantial distinction. The revenue of a city would
show whether it is capable of independent existence. Cities
with smaller income need the continued support of provincial
government thus justifying the continued participation of the
voters in that election of provincial officials. It is true that
Mandaue is classified as a component city but because of the
provision of its charter, its registered voters are not allowed
to vote in the elections of the Province of Cebu, while other
component cities are, because their charters allow them to do
so, but this difference in treatment is a matter of legislative
discretion. (Teves • COMELEC, 90 Phil. 370.)

province in the administration of their affairs. Such being
the case it is but just and proper to limit the selection and
election of provincial officials to the voters of the province
whose interest are affected and exclude the voters of
highly-urbanized cities.

effect on June 21, 1969, did not have to be ratified by the

The Court rules that conversion to an HUC is substantial
alternation of boundaries governed by Section 10, Art. X and
resultantly, said provision applies, governs and prevails over

UMALI v. COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
G.R. No. 203974, August 22, 2014, Velasco, Jr., J.
Facts: On July 11, 2011, the Sangguniang Panglungsod of
Cabanatuan City passed Resolution No. 183-2011, requesting
the President to declare the conversion of Cabanatuan City
from a component city of the province of Nueva Ecija into a
highly urbanized city (HUC). Acceding to the request, the
President issued Presidential Proclamation No. 418, Series of
2012, proclaiming the City of Cabanatuan as an HUC subject

804

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

to "ratification in a plebiscite by the qualified voters therein,
as provided for in Section 453 of the Local Government Code
of 1991."
Respondent COMELEC, acting on the proclamation,
issued the assailed Minute Resolution No. 12-0797 which
reads:
WHEREFORE, the Commission RESOLVED, as it
hereby RESOLVES, that for purposes of the plebiscite for
the conversion of Cabanatuan City from component city
to highly-urbanized city, only those registered residents of
Cabanatuan City should participate in the said plebiscite.
In due time, petitioner Aurelio M. Umali, Governor
of Nueva Ecija, filed a Verified Motion for Reco nsideration,
maintaining that the proposed conversion in question will
necessarily and directly affect the mother province of Nueva
Ecija.

Ruling: First, the Court's pronouncement in Miranda vs.
Aguirre, 314 SCRA 603 (1999) is apropos and may be applied
by analogy. While Miranda involves the downgrading, instead
of upgrading, as here, of an independent component city into a
component city, its application to the case at bar is nonetheless
material in ascertaining the proper treatment of conversions.
In that seminal case, the Court held that the downgrading of
an independent component city into a component city comes
within the purview of Sec. 10, Art. X of the Constitution which
requires "a plebiscite in the political units directly affected."
The Court rules that conversion to an HUC is substantial
alternation of boundaries governed by Sec. 10, Art. X and
resultantly, said provision applies, governs and prevails over
Sec. 453 of the LGC.
The conversion into an HUC carries the accessory of
substantial alteration of boundaries and that the province
of Nueva Ecija will, without a doubt, suffer a reduction in
territory because of the severance of Cabanatuan City. The
residents of the city will cease to be political constituencies
of the province, effectively reducing the latter's population.
Taking this decrease in territory and population in connection
with the above formula, it is conceded that Nueva Ecija will
indeed suffer a reduction in IRA given the decrease of its

Book III Local Government Units
Title Three The City

805

multipliers' values as assessed by the Regional Director of the
DBM for Region III.
The province of Nueva Ecija will suffer a substantial
reduction of its share in IRA once Cabanatuan City attains
autonomy. In view of the economic impact of Cabanatuan City's
conversion, petitioner Umali's contention, that its effect on the
province is not only direct but also adverse, deserves merit.
Moreover, his claim that the province will lose shares in
provincial taxes imposed in Cabanatuan City is well-founded.
This is based on Sec. 151 of the LGC.
Aside from the alteration of economic rights, the political
rights of Nueva Ecija and those of its residents will also be
affected by Cabanatuan's conversion into an HUC. Notably,
the administrative supervision of the province over the city
will effectively be revoked upon conversion.
Duties, privileges and obligations appertaining to HUCs
will attach to Cabanatuan City if it is converted into an HUC.
This includes the right to be outside the general supervision
of the province and be under the direct supervision of the
President. An HUC is not subject to provincial oversight
because the complex and varied problems in an HUC due to
a bigger population and greater economic activity require
greater autonomy. The provincial government stands to lose
the power to ensure that the local government officials of
Cabanatuan City act within the scope of its prescribed powers
and functions, to review executive orders issued by the city
mayor, and to approve resolutions and ordinances enacted by
the city council. The province will also be divested ofjurisdiction
over disciplinary cases concerning the elected city officials
of the new HUC, and the appeal process for administrative
case decisions against barangay officials of the city will also
be modified accordingly. Likewise, the registered voters of the
city will no longer be entitled to vote for and be voted upon as
provincial officials.
The Petition is Granted. COMELEC is hereby ordered to
conduct a plebiscite for the purpose of converting Cabanatuan
City into a Highly Urbanized City to be participated in by the
qualified registered voters of Nueva Ecija within 120 days from
the finality of this Decision.

Decided Cases

1.
The preliminary injunction issued by the RTC sought to
restrain the City of Cagayan de Oro from opening the sealed bids
for the South Diversion Road and PCDG Cargo Bridge Project. The
said venture, which is covered by the Build-Operate-and-Transfer
Law, is clearly a national government project within the meaning of
R.A. 8975. Therefore, the subject writ of preliminary injunction is,
by operation of law, void, and of no force and effect.

Book III- Local Government Units
Title Three - The City

809

Diversified International, Inc. Under the said contract,
petitioner undertook to design, finance, and construct the
City's South Diversion Road and PCDG Cargo Bridge Project
for P635,999,929.79 payable in US dollars at the exchange rate
of P37.50 to a dollar.
Pursuant to the contract and upon petitioner's request,
the City released P23,000,000 to cover the expenses for
topographic surveys, feasibility studies, design development
and preliminary engineering.
However, before petitioner could continue with the
implementation of the contract, respondent Vicente Y. Emano,
was declared winner in the election for mayor during the May
1998 elections. Mayor Emano created a special committee
to investigate the alleged irregular release of the amount of
P23,000,000 to petitioner. The special committee found the
contract grossly disadvantageous to the government.
Thus, in December 2000, an amended Build and Transfer
Contract was forged between petitioner and the City. The
amendment retained the project cost of P635,999,929. 79 less
the initial payment of P23,000,000, but made it payable in
Philippine pesos instead of US dollars.
Meanwhile, petitioner assigned all its rights, obligations,
and interests in the original and amended contracts in favor of
White Horse Trading Development and Construction (Whi te
Horse, for brevity) for a consideration of P25,000,000. The
City accordingly passed an ordinance confirming the said
assignment. Thereafter, the City sent a notice to White Horse
to commence work.
While work on the project was underway, Whi te Horse
failed to comply with the cash consideration as agreed upon
under the deed of assignment. Hence, petitioner rescinded the
assignment with due notice to the City.

COURT OF APPEALS
532 Phil. 296, August 31, 2006, Quisumbing, J.

However, Mayor Emano refused to recognize the same and
instead, rescinded the amended contract between petitioner
and the City. Forthwith, the City caused the publication of
invitation to licensed contractors to pre-qualify and bid for the
same project.

Facts: On March 18, 1998, respondent City of Cagayan
de Oro, through its then Mayor, Pablo P. Magtajas, entered
into a Build and Transfer Contract with petitioner GV

Claiming that the rescission of the amended contract was
unlawful, petitioner filed with the RTC of Cagayan de Oro City
a Complaint for specific performance, injunction and damages

810

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

against the City. In its complaint, petitioner prayed that a
temporary restraining order be immediately issued against the
commission of the acts complained of, including the opening of
the sealed bids for the project.
Ruling: Whether the City may be stopped by preliminary
prohibitory injunction from awarding through public bidding
the completion of the South Diversion Road and PCDG Cargo
Bridge Project.
R.A. 8975 delineated more clearly the coverage of the
prohibition. Quoted below are its relevant provisions:
SEC. 2. Definition of Terms.(a) "National government projects" shall
refer to all current and future national government
infrastructure, engineering works and service contracts,
including projects undertaken by government-owned
and controlled corporations, all projects covered by
Republic Act No. 6957, as amended by Republic Act
No. 7718, otherwise known as the Build-Operateand-Transfer Law, and other related and necessary
activities, such as site acquisition, supply and/or
installation of equipment and materials, implementation,
construction, completion, operation, maintenance,
improvement, repair and rehabilitation, regardless of the
source of funding.
SEC. 3. Prohibition on the Issuance of Temporary
Restraining Orders, Preliminary Injunctions and
Preliminary Mandatory Injunctions.
No court,
except the Supreme Court, shall issue any temporary
restraining order, preliminary injunction or preliminary
mandatory injunction against the government, or any of
its subdivisions, officials or any person or entity, whether
public or private, acting under the government's direction,
to restrain, prohibit or compel the following acts:
(b) Bidding or awarding of contract/project of the
national government as defined under Section 2 hereof;
Based on the aforequoted provisions, a preliminary
injunction issued by any court, other than the Supreme Court,
for the purpose of restraining the bidding or awarding of a
national government project, is void.

811

In this case, the preliminary injunction issued by the RTC
sought to restrain the City of Cagayan de Oro from opening
the sealed bids for the South Diversion Road and PCDG Cargo
Bridge Project. The said venture, which is covered by the BuildOperate-and-Transfer Law, is clearly a national government
project within the meaning of Rep. Act No. 8975. Therefore, the
subject writ of preliminary injunction is, by operation of Jaw,
void and of no force and effect.
The petition is DISMISSED.
2. Build-Operate-Transfer projects of local government
units are covered by R.A. 8975. The dismissal by the trial court of
the complaint due to petitioners' lack of personality to file suit is
erroneous. Petitioners, as members of the City Council of Cagayan
De Oro, may file a case to question a contract entered into by the city
mayor allegedly without the City Council's authority. City councilors
may file a suit for the declaration of nullity of a contract on the
basis that the city mayor had no authority to do so because the city
mayor's authority to bind the city to obligations must emanate from
the City Council.

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

This complaint was filed against City Government of
Cagayan De Oro and the incumbent Cagayan De Oro City
officials, in their personal and official capacities: Mayor
Jaraula; Vice Mayor Vicente Y. Emano; Councilors Ramon
Tabor, Reynaldo Advincula, Ian Mark Nacaya, President Elipe,
Emmanuel Abejuela, Alfonso Goking, Alden Bacal, Alexander
Dacer, Marycor Calizo, Aaron Neri, Adrian Barba, Ian Caesar
Acenas, Simeon Licayan, Karen Vi Poquita, Dante Pajo; and
Mega Farm and See.
Ruling: The RTC correctly denied the issuance of a
temporary restraining order against the Agora Complex BOT
Contract.
That Build-Operate-Transfer projects of local government
units are covered by Republic Act No. 8975 was affirmed in GV
Diversified International, Inc. v. Court ofAppeals, 532 Phil. 296
(2006). The issuance of a temporary restraining order against
the opening of sealed bids for a "Build and Transfer Contract"
with Cagayan De Oro City was found to be in violation of
Republic Act No. 8975:
The dismissal by the trial court of the complaint due
to petitioners' lack of personality to file suit is erroneous.
Petitioners, as members of the City Council of Cagayan De
Oro, may file a case to question a contract entered into by the
city mayor allegedly without the City Council's authority.
The real party in interest which may file a case,
questioning the validity of a contract entered into by the city
mayor, who is alleged to have no authority to do so, is the city
itself. It is the local government unit which stands to be injured
or benefited by any judgment that may be made in this case.
The city councilors merely represent the city in the suit.
The lower court's fundamental error was in treating
plaintiffs' complaint as a personal suit on their own behalf
and applying the test in such cases that plaintiffs should
show personal interest as parties who would be benefited or
injured by the judgment sought. Plaintiffs' suit is patently not
a personal suit. Plaintiffs clearly and by the express terms of
their complaint filed the suit as a representative suit on behalf
and for the benefit of the city of Cebu.
City councilors may file a suit for the declaration of nullity
of a contract on the basis that the city mayor had no authority

to do so because the city mayor's authority to bind the city to
obligations must emanate from the City Council. Under Title
III, Chapter III, Article I, Section 455(b)(l)(vi) of Republic Act
No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code,
the city mayor may sign all bonds, contracts, and obligations
on behalf of a city only upon authority of the sanggumang
panlungsod or pursuant to law or ordinance:
Petition is partially granted. The dismissal of the
Complaint by the RTC is Reversed, the denial of the issuance
of the TRO is Affirmed, and the case is remanded to the RTC
for further proceedings.

Gochan & Sons and the Cebu City may enter into
a modified land swap in that the former must pay an amount
corresponding to the difference in value between the private and
public lands involved. In doing so, the Cebu City would, in effect, be
receiving properties of commensurate value to the property it would
be giving in exchange.
FELIX GOCHAN & SONS REALTY CORPORATION v.
COMMISSION ON AUDIT
G.R. No. 223228, April 10, 2019, Reyes, J. Jr., J.
Facts: On December 14, 2005, the Sangguniang
Panlungsod of Cebu issued Resolution No. 05-1676 approving
the proposed land swap between Gochan & Sons and Cebu City
and authorizing the city mayor to sign and execute a Deed of
Exchange with Gochan & Sons. In the said trade, Gochan &
Sons will give its Banawa and Lorega Properties to Cebu City
in place of the latter's Lahug Property. The possible ejectment
case Gochan & Sons may file against the Banawa Elementary
School, to the prejudice of the school children and the city
government itself, motivated the parties to agree to the land
swap.
Consequently, a Deed of Exchange was made between
the parties with Gochan & Sons' President Louise Y. Gochan
and Cebu City Mayor Tomas R. Osmena acting as their
representatives. The COA Legal and Adjudication Office-Local
Sector recommended the approval of the exchange after Gochan
& Sons' properties were initially valued at P37,966,550.00 and
Cebu City's Lahug Property only at P34,883,600.00.

Sometime in 2008, an inspection was made on the
properties subject of the exchange in compliance with the
directives from the COA. As a result of the inspection,
a committee composed of COA assistant commissioners
recommended a reappraisal of the properties involved. After
the reappraisal, it was discovered that the value of Gochan &
Sons' properties were about 45% lower compared to the Lahug
Property.

declare void land swap deals where the private individual
offers land of lesser value to the government. It only defined
a land swap deal in such terms to ensure that the LGUs are
never placed at a disadvantage, i.e., they would only receive
land of equal or higher value. Nevertheless, the provision does
not preclude parties into agreeing that the private individual
pay an additional amount in case the value of the private land
is lesser compared to the public land involved in a land swap.

In its Decision No. 2009-049 dated June 5, 2009, the COA
held that it did not favor the approval of the Deed of Exchange.
It opined that the exchange of properties would violate Republic
Act (R.A.) No. 7279 because the property owned by Cebu City
was more valuable than what Gochan & Sons had offered in
exchange. The difference of P20 M is substantial.

Thus, Gochan & Sons and the Cebu City may enter into
a modified land swap in that the former must pay an amount
corresponding to the difference in value between the private
and public lands involved. In doing so, the Cebu City would,
in effect, be receiving properties of commensurate value to the
property it would be giving in exchange.

Ruling: The Court finds that the COA, in declaring the
Deed of Exchange between Cebu City and Gochan & Sons void
for lack of COA's prior approval, had acted in excess of its audit
jurisdiction.

The petition is GRANT ED. The COA Resolutions are
REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Deed of Exchange between
Felix Gochan & Sons Realty Corporation and the City
Government of Cebu is APPROVED, subject to the payment
by Felix Gochan &: Sons Realty Corporation of the amount of
P20,137,000.00 to the City Government of Cebu.

There is no law which requires that the Deed of Exchange
should be previously approved by the COA, otherwise, it would
be null and void.
R.A. No. 7279 (Urban Development and Housing Act
if 1992) provides for various modes of land acquisition to be
utilized for the purposes provided therein, one of which is land
swapping. Section 3(j) of R.A. No. 7279, defines land swapping
as the "process of land acquisition by exchanging land for
another piece of land of equal value, or for shares of stock in
a government or quasi-government corporation whose book
value is of equal value to the land being exchanged, for the
purpose of planned and rational development and provision
for socialized housing where land values are determined based
on land classification, market value and assessed value taken
from existing tax declarations: Provided, That more valuable
lands owned by private persons may be exchanged with less
valuable lands to carry out the objectives of this Act."
Based on the evaluation of three different appraisers, the
value of Cebu City's property was more than P20 Million than
Gochan & Sons' properties combined.
A closer reading of the aforementioned provision, however,
reveals that Sec 3 (j) of RA 7279 did not expressly prohibit or

(vii) Carry out such emergency
measures as may be necessary during and
in the aftermath of man-made and natural

judicial proceedings against any official

of his official duties;
A.

Decided Case

1.
Respondent Pajaro, as the city treasurer, was the head
of the Office of the Treasurer while petitioner, a senior revenue
collector, was an officer under him. The city treasurer is the proper
disciplining authority who could investigate petitioner and issue a
preventive suspension order against him.
GARCIA v. PAJARO
G.R. No. 141149, July 5, 2002, Panganiban, J.
Facts: Petitioner SEBASTIAN GARCIA. 61, married,
employee at the City Treasurer's Office, Dagupan City and
resident of Lucao, Dagupan City, has been employed thereat
since June 15, 1974 as Revenue Collector appointed to that
position by then City Mayor Cipriano Manaois.
Petitioner claims that the officer empowered to institute
disciplinary proceedings against him is the city mayor of
Dagupan-not the city treasurer. He further asserts that
under Section 78 of the Local Government Code of 1983, the
city treasurer does not have the power to discipline him.
Held: In the case [] at bar, the city treasurer is the
proper disciplining authority referred to in Section 47 of the
Administrative Code of 1987. The term "agency" refers to any
of the various units of the government including a department,
a bureau, an office, an instrumentality, a government-owned
or controlled corporation, or a local government or a distinct
unit therein. Respondent Pajaro, as the city treasurer, was
the head of the Office of the Treasurer; while petitioner, a
senior revenue collector, was an officer under him. Thus, the
city treasurer is the proper disciplining authority who could
investigate petitioner and issue a preventive suspension order
against him.
Petitioner's contention that it is only the city mayor who
may discipline him is not persuasive. Section 455(b-1-x) of the
1991 Local Government Code states that the city mayor "may
cause to be instituted administrative or judicial proceedings

Book III Local Government Units
Title Three -The City

817

against any official or employee of the city." This rule is not
incongruent with the provisions of the 1987 Administrative
Code, which authorizes the heads of agencies to discipline
subordinate employees. Likewise, the old Local Government
Code does not vest in city mayors the sole power to discipline
and to institute criminal or administrative actions against any
officers or employees under their jurisdiction. In fact, there is no
provision under the present Local Government Code expressly
rescinding the authority of the Department of Finance to
exercise disciplinary authority over its employees. By the same
token, there is nothing that prohibits the city treasurer from
filing a complaint against petitioner.
In the present case, Respondent Pajaro was authorized
to issue the assailed Preventive Suspension Order against
petitioner, because the latter was charged with gross neglect
of duty, refusal to perform official duties and functions, and
insubordination-grounds that allowed the issuance of such
Order, as provided by Section 51 of the 1987 Administrative
Code. Clearly, the city treasurer acted within the scope of his
power when he commenced the investigation and issued the
assailed Order.
(i) Examine the books, records and
other documents of all offices, officials,
agents and employees of the city and,
in aid of his executive powers and
authority, require all national officials
and employees stationed in or assigned
to the city to make available to him such
books, records, and other documents in
their custody, except those classified by
law as confidential;
(xii) Furnish copies of Executive
Orders issued by him, to the provincial
governor in the case of component City
Mayors, to the Office of the President in
the case of highly-urbanized City Mayors,
and their respective metropolitan council
chairman in the case of mayors of cities
in the Metropolitan Manila Area and
other metropolitan political subdivisions,

within seventy-two (72) hours after their

(xiii) Visit component barangays of
the city at least once every six (6) months
to deepen his understanding of problems
and conditions, listen and give appropriate
counsel to local officials and inhabitants,
inform the component barangay officials
and inhabitants of general laws and
ordinances which especially concern
them, and otherwise conduct visits and
inspections to ensure that the governance
of the city will improve the quality of life
of the inhabitants;
(xiv) Act on leave applications of
officials and employees appointed by him
and the comm utation of the monetary
value of their leave credits in accordance
with law;
(xv) Authorize officials trips of city
officials and employees outside of the city
for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days;

Decided Cases

1.
The fact that a party acquiesced in the special conditions
imposed by the City Mayor in subject business permit does not
preclude it from challenging the said imposition, which is ultra vires
or beyond the ambit of authority of the City Mayor. Ultra uires acts
or acts which are clearly beyond the scope of one's authority are null
and void and cannot be given any effect.
ACEBEDO OPTICAL COMPANY , INC. v. CA
329 SCRA 314, March 31, 2000, Purisima, J.
Facts: Petitioner applied with the Office of the City
Mayor of Iligan for a business permit. Respondent City Mayor

822

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

issued Business Permit No. 5342 subject to the following
conditions: [.)
"l. Since it is a corporation, Acebedo cannot put up
an optical clinic but only a commercial store;
2.
Acebedo cannot examine and/or prescribe
reading and similar optical glasses for patients, because
these are functions of optical clinics;
3.
Acebedo cannot sell reading and similar
eyeglasses without a prescription having first been made
by an independent optometrist (not its employee,) or
independent optical clinic. x x x
On December 5, 1988, private respondent Samahan ng
Optometrist Sa Pilipinas (SOPI), Iligan Chapter, lodged a
complaint against the petitioner before the Office of the City
Mayor, alleging that Acebedo had violated the conditions set
forth in its business permit and requesting the cancellation
and/or revocation of such permit.
On July 19, 1989, the City Mayor after investigation sent
petitioner a Notice of Resolution and Cancellation [cf] Business
Permit effective as of said date and giving petitioner three (3)
months to wind up its affairs.

Held: A business permit is issued primarily to regulate
the conduct of business and the City Mayor cannot, through the
issuance of such permit, regulate the practice of a profession,
like that of optometry. Such a function is within the exclusive
domain of the Professional Regulation Commission and the
Board of Examiners in Optometry.
The contention that the business permit was a contract
between Iligan City and petitioner was therefore binding
between them and that petitioner is estopped from questioning
the same are untenable. A license or permit is not in the nature
of a contract but a special privilege.
"x xx a license or a permit is not a contract between
the sovereign and the licensee or permitee, and is not
a property in the constitutional sense, as to which the
constitutional proscription against impairment of the
obligation of contracts may extend. A license is rather
in the nature of a special privilege, of a permission or
authority to do what is within its terms. It is not in any
way vested, permanent or absolute."

823

It is therefore decisively clear that estoppel cannot apply
in this case. The fact that petitioner acquiesced in the special
conditions imposed by the City Mayor in subject business permit
does not preclude it from challenging the said imposition, which
is ultra uires or beyond the ambit of authority of respondent
City Mayor. Ultra vires acts or acts which are clearly beyond
the scope of one's authority are null and void and cannot be
given any effect. The doctrine of estoppel cannot operate to give
effect to an act which is otherwise null and void or ultra vires.
The respondent City Mayor is hereby ordered to reissue
petitioner's business permit in accordance with law and with
this disposition.
2.
Mayor Lim had no authority to close down Bistro's
business or any business establishment in Manila without due
process of law.
LIMv. CA
G.R. No. 111397, August 12, 2002, Carpio, J.
Facts: On December 7, 1992, Bistro Pigalle, Inc. filed
before the trial court a petition for mandamus and prohibition,
against Lim in his capacity as Mayor of the City of Manila.
Bistro filed the case because policemen under Lim's instructions
inspected and investigated Bistro's license as well as the
work permits and health certificates of its staff. This caused
the stoppage of work in Bistro's night club and restaurant
operations (The New Bangkok Club and the Exotic Garden
Restaurant). Lim also refused to accept Bistro's application for
a business license, as well as the work permit applications of
Bistro's staff, for the year 1993.

Held: The authority of mayors to issue business licenses
and permits is beyond question. The law expressly provides for
such authority under Section 11(1), Article II of the Revised
Charter of the City of Manila and on the other hand, Section
466(3)(iv) of the Local Government Code.
From the- language of the two laws, it is clear that the
power of the mayor to issue business licenses and permits
necessarily includes the corollary power to suspend, revoke or
even refuse to issue the same. However, the power to suspend
or revoke these licenses and permits is expressly premised on
the violation of the conditions of these permits and licenses.

824

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

The laws specifically refer to the "violation of the condition(s)"
on which the licenses and permits were issued. Similarly, the
power to refuse to issue such licenses and permits is premised
on noncompliance with the prerequisites for the issuance of
such licenses and permits. The mayor must observe due process
in exercising these powers, which means that the mayor must
give the applicant or licensee notice and opportunity to be
heard.
True, the mayor has the power to inspect and investigate
private commercial establishments for any violation of the
conditions of their licenses and permits. However, the mayor
has no power to order a police raid on these establishments
in the guise of inspecting or investigating these commercial
establishments. Lim acted beyond his authority when he
directed policemen to raid the New Bangkok Club and the
Exotic Garden Restaurant.
Lim has no authority to close down Bistro's business or
any business establishment in Manila without due process
of law. Lim cannot take refuge under the Revised Charter of
the City of Manila and the Local Government Code. There
is no provision in these laws expressly or impliedly granting
the mayor authority to close down private commercial
establishments without notice and hearing, and even if there
is, such provision would be void. The due process clause of
the Constitution requires that Lim should have given Bistro
an opportunity to rebut the allegations that it violated the
conditions of its licenses and permits. In the instant case, we
find that Li m's exercise of this power violated Bistro's property
rights that are protected under the due process clause of the
Constitution.

The mayor did not issue the permit of the radio station for
political reasons. The respondent officials are directed to immediately

NEWSOUNDS BROADCASTING NE'IWORK v. DY
583 SCRA 333, April 2, 2009, Tinga, J.
Facts: Bombo Radyo Philippines ("Bombo Radyo")
operates several radio stations under the AM and FM band
throughout the Philippines. These stations are operated by

Book III- Local Government Units
Title Three The City

825

corporations organized and incorporated by Bombo Radyo,
particularly petitioners Newsounds Broadcasting Network,
Inc. ("Newsounds") and Consolidated Broadcasting System,
Inc. ("CBS"). Among the stations run by Newsounds is Bombo
Radyo DZNC Cauayan (DZNC), an AM radio broadcast station
operating out of Cauayan City, Isabela. CBS, in turn, runs Star
FM DWIT Cauayan ("Star FM'), also operating out of Cauayan
City, airing on the FM band.
DZNC and Star FM operated as radio stations. Both
stations successfully secured all necessary operating
documents, including mayor's permits from 1997 to 2001.
During that period, CDC paid real property taxes on the
property based on the classification of the land as commercial.
All that changed beginning in 2002. On 15 January of that
year, petitioners applied for the renewal of the mayor's permit.
Then City Zoning Administrator-Designate Bagnos Maximo
(Maximo) required petitioners to submit "either an approved
land conversion papers from the Department of Agrarian
Reform (DAR) showing that the property was converted from
prime agricultural land to commercial land, or an approved
resolution from the Sangguniang Bayan or Sangguniang
Panglungsod authorizing the re-classification of the property
from agricultural to commercial land." Petitioners had never
been required to submit such papers before, and from 1996 to
2001, the Office of the Municipal Planning and Development
Coordinator of Cauayan (OMPDC) had consistently certified
that the property had been classified as commercial.
Due to this refusal by Maximo to issue the zoning
clearance, petitioners were unable to secure a mayor's permit.
Petitioners filed a petition for mandamus with the Regional
Trial Court (RTC) of Cauayan City to compel the issuance of
the 2002 mayor's permit.

Ruling: That the acts imputed against respondents
constitute a prior restraint on the freedom of expression of
respondents who happen to be members of the press is clear
enough. There is a long-standing tradition of special judicial
solicitude for free speech, meaning that governmental action
directed at expression must satisfy a greater burden of
justification than governmental action directed at most other
forms of behavior.

826

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Prior to 2002, petitioners had not been frustrated in
securing the various local government requirements for the
operation of their stations. It was only in the beginning of
2002, after the election of respondent Ceasar Dy as mayor of
Cauayan, that the local government started to impose these
new requirements substantiating the conversion of CDC's
property for commercial use. Petitioners admit that during
the 2001 elections, Bombo Radyo "was aggressive in exposing
the widespread election irregularities in Isabela that appear
to have favored Respondent Dy and other members of the Dy
political dynasty." Respondents' efforts to close petitioners'
radio station clearly intensified immediately before the May
2004 elections, where a former employee of DZNC Bombo
Radyo, Grace Padaca, was mounting a credible and ultimately
successful challenge against the incumbent Isabela governor,
who happened to be the brother of respondent Dy. It also bears
notice that the requirements required of petitioners by the
Cauayan City government are frankly beyond the pale and not
conventionally adopted by local governments throughout the
Philippines.
In the case of Cauayan City, the authority to require a
mayor's permit was enacted through Ordinance No. 92-004,
enacted in 1993 when Cauayan was still a municipality.
Nothing in Ordinance No. 92-004 requires, as respondents
did, that an applicant for a mayor's permit submit "either
an approved land conversion papers from the DAR showing
that its property was converted from prime agricultural
land to commercial land, or an approved resolution from the
Sangguniang Bayan or Sangguniang Panglungsod authorizing
the re-classification of the property from agricultural to
commercial land." The aforecited provision which details the
procedure for applying for a mayor's permit does not require any
accompanying documents to the application, much less those
sought from petitioners by respondents. Moreover, Ordinance
No. 92-004 does not impose on the applicant any burden to
establish that the property from where the business was to
operate had been duly classified as commercial in nature.
WHEREFORE, the petitions are GRANTED. The decisions
of the CA and RTC of Cauayan City are hereby REVERSED
and SET ASIDE. The instant petition for mandamus is hereby
GRANTED and respondents are directed to immediately issue

petitioners' zoning clearances and mayor's permits for 2004 to
petitioners.
Respondents Caesar G. Dy, Felicisimo G. Meer,

Respondent had no clear and unmistakable legal right
to operate its bingo operations at the onset. Respondent failed to
establish that it had duly applied for the proper permit for bingo
operations with the Office of the Mayor and, instead, merely relied
on the questionable claim stub to support its claim. It is not entitled
to the damages which it is demanding from petitioners local officials.
CITY OF BACOLOD v. PHUTURE VISIONS, CO., INC.
G.R. No. 190289, January 17, 2018, Velasco, Jr., J.
Facts: Phuture Visions, Co., Inc. was incorporated in 2004.
In May 2005, its Articles of Incorporation (AOI) was amended
to, among others, include the operation of lotto betting stations
and/or other gaming outlets as one of its secondary purposes.
Eventually, it applied with the Philippine Amusement and
Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) for an authority to operate
bingo games at the SM City Bacolod Mall (SM Bacolod), as well
as with SM Prime Holdings (SM Prime) for the lease of a space
in the said building. Phuture was issued a provisional Grant of
Authority (GOA) on December 5, 2006 by PAGCOR, subject to
compliance with certain requirements, and received an Award
Notice from SM Prime on January 10, 2007.
Phuture commenced bingo operations at SM Bacolod on
March 2, 2007, prior to the issuance of the actual hard copy of
the mayor's permit. However, at around 6:10 a.m. of March 3,
2007, respondent learned that its bingo outlet was padlocked
by agents of the Office of the City Legal Officer and that a
copy of a Closure Order dated March 2, 2007 was posted at the
entrance of the bingo outlet[.)

Ruling: Respondent had no clear and unmistakable legal
right to operate its bingo operations at the onset. Respondent

828

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

Book III • Locnl Government Units
Title Three The City

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

failed to establish that it had duly applied for the proper permit
for bingo operations with the Office of the Mayor and, instead,
merely relied on the questionable claim stub to support its claim.
The trial court also found that the application form submitted
by respondent pertained to a renewal of respondent's business
for "Professional Services, Band/Entertainment Services"
located at "RH Bldg., 26th Lacson St." and not at SM Bacolod.
These factual findings by the trial court belie respondent's
claim that it had the right to operate its bingo operations at
SM Bacolod.

(vi) Require owners of illegally
constructed houses, buildings or other
structures to obtain the necessary permit,
subject to such fines and penalties as may
be imposed bylaw or ordinance, or to make
necessary changes in the construction of
the same when said construction violates
any law or ordinance, or to order the
demolition or removal of the said house,
building or structure within the period
prescribed by law or ordinance;

Certainly, respondent's claim that it had applied for a
license for bingo operations is questionable since, as it had
admitted in its Petition for Mandamus and Damages, the
primary purpose in its AOI was only amended to reflect bingo
operations on February 14, 2007 or more than a month after it
had supposedly applied for a license for bingo operations with
the Office of the Mayor.

(vii) Adopt adequate measures to
safeguard and conserve land, mineral,
marine, forest, and other resources of the
city;
(viii) Provide efficient and effective
property and supply management in the
city; and protect the funds, credits, right
and other properties of the city; and

Petitioners, in ordering the closure of respondent's bingo
operations, were exercising their duty to implement laws and
ordinances which include the local government's authority to
issue licenses and permits for business operations in the city.
This authority is granted to them as a delegated exercise of the
police power of the State.
Injury alone does not give respondent the right to recover
damages, but it must also have a right of action for the legal
wrong inflicted by petitioners. In order that the law will give
redress for an act causing damage, there must be damnum et
injuria that act must be not only hurtful, but wrongful.
Considering that respondent had no legal right to operate
the bingo operations at the outset, then it is not entitled to the
damages which it is demanding from petitioners.
The petition is hereby GRANTED.
(v) Issue permits, without need
of approval therefor from any national
agency, for the holding of activities
for any charitable or welfare purpose,
excluding prohibited games of chance or
shows contrary to law, public policy and
public morals;

829

(ix) Institute or cause to be instituted
administrative or judicial proceedings for
violation of ordinances in the collection of
taxes, fees or charges, and for the recovery
of funds and property; and cause the city
to be defended against all suits to ensure
that its interests, resources and rights
shall be adequately protected;
A.

Decided Case

1.
The mayor has the authority to file suits "for the recovery
of funds and property" on behalf of the city, even without the prior
authorization from the Sanggunian. This conclusion is strengthened
by the fact that nowhere in the enumerated powers and duties of the
Sanggunian can one find the requirement of such prior authorization
in favor of the mayor for the purpose of filing suits on behalf of the
city.
CITY OF CALOOCAN v. COURT OF APPEALS
489 SCRA 45, May 3, 2006, Tinga, J.
Facts: On 02 August 1990, the Sangguniang Panlungsod
(Sanggunian) of Caloocan City passed Ordinance No. 068

830

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

s. 1990 authorizing the city mayor, then Mayor Macario
Asistio, Jr. to negotiate and enter into a contract of sale of the
patrimonial property of the city comprising of 22,685.82 square
meters covered by TCT No. 54327. Thereafter, on 06 September
1990, Mayor Asistio, on behalf of Caloocan City, and Jose C. Go
of Ever Gotesco (Gotesco), executed a Deed of Absolute Sale
over the aforementioned property for P136,114,800.00.
However, the Commission on Audit (COA) disapproved
the Deed of Sale. Nonetheless, on motion for reconsideration,
the COA approved the proposed sale on the condition that
the selling price is pegged at P8,926.39 per square meter, or
P182,085,078.30 for the entire property. As a consequence
thereof, on 23 October 1997, the Sanggunian passed an
ordinance amending Ord. No. 068, directing that an amended
deed of absolute sale be executed between the City and Gotesco,
the terms and conditions of which be pursuant to the COA
decision. The ordinance was initially vetoed by then incumbent
mayor, Reynaldo 0. Malonzo (Malonzo), on the ground that
since the deed of sale earlier executed was valid and subsisting
it was not incumbent upon him to execute an amended deed of
conveyance over the same property; the Sanggunian, however,
passed Resolution No. 0609 overriding the veto.
On 16 April 1998, Caloocan City filed a petition for
prohibition with application for preliminary injunction and
prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order before
the RTC of Caloocan, docketed as Civil Case No. C-18308.
During the pendency of this suit, another case, docketed as
Civil Case No. C-18337, was filed for annulment of sale and
cancellation of title.
Gotesco moved for the dismissal of Civil Case No. 18337,
but its motion was denied by the trial court through its Order
dated 31 July 1998. A motion for reconsideration was filed by
Gotesco but it was likewise denied.
Ruling: The main question before us is the propriety
of the dismissal of Civil Case No. C-18337 on the ground of
forum-shopping. However, before dealing with this issue, the
Court shall first resolve the dispute regarding the authority of
a mayor to file cases on behalf of his city.
Sec. 455 of the Local Government Code provides, among
others, the powers and duties of a city mayor.

Book III Local Government Units
Title Three The City

831

From the foregoing, it is clear that the mayor has the
authority to file suits "for the recovery of funds and property"
on behalf of the city, even without the prior authorization
from the Sanggunian. This conclusion is strengthened by
the fact that nowhere in the enumerated powers and duties
of the Sanggunian can one find the requirement of such prior
authorization in favor of the mayor for the purpose of filing
suits on behalf of the city. Civil Case No. C-18308 was filed
by Malonzo to enjoin the registration of what he deemed to be
an anomalous deed of sale, while Civil Case No. C-18337 was
instituted to annul the Deed of Absolute Sale and to cancel
the title issued to Gotesco. Obviously, these suits were tiled,
initially to preserve, and subsequently to recover, the property
subject of the said suits, to protect the interests of the City
of Caloocan over the said parcel of land. Thus, it can be said
that the institution of Civil Cases Nos. C-18308 and C-18337
was made within the bounds of Malonzo's authority as the city
mayor.
However, being the proper party to file such suits, the
mayor must necessarily be the one to sign the certification
against forum-shopping, and not the City Legal Officer, who,
despite being an official of the City, was merely its counsel
and not a party to the case. Thus, the Court of Appeals was
correct in holding that the certification against forum-shopping
in Civil Case No. C-18337 is defective for having been signed
by the City Legal Officer and not by Malonzo. This factor alone
could well have led to the dismissal of Civil Case No. C-18337.
However, an even more compelling reason dictates that Civil
Case No. C-18337 must be dismissed at all events. This is
forum-shopping.
The Court finds that the cases involve the same principal
parties, to wit: the City of Caloocan and Gotesco Investments,
Inc., while the other parties were merely impleaded as nominal
parties. As this Court has previously held, absolute identity of
parties is not required. It is enough that there is substantial
identity of parties.
The adjudication of this case is without prejudice to the
resolution of the issues in the consignation case, Civil Case No.
C-18274, if not yet resolved already.
The petition is DISMISSED.

OSMENA v. GARGANERA
G.R. No. 231164, March 20, 2018, Tijam, J.
Facts: Sometime in 2011, the Cebu City Local
Government (City Government) resolved to close the Inayawan
landfill per Cebu City Sangguniang Panlunsod (SP) Resolution
and Executive Order of former Cebu City Mayor Michael Rama
(former Mayor Rama). The Inayawan landfill was partially
closed and all wastes from Cebu City were disposed in a
privately operated landfill in Consolacion. On June 15, 2015,
through former Mayor Rama's directive, Inayawan landfill was
formally closed.
In 2016, however, under the administration of Mayor
Osmena, the City Government sought to temporarily open
the Inayawan landfill, through a letter dated June 8, 2016, by
then Acting Cebu City Mayor Margot Osmena (Acting Mayor
Margot) addressed to Regional Director Engr. William Cuiiado
(Eng. Cuiado) of the Environmental Management Bureau
(EMB) of the DENR.
Thus, in July 2016, the Inayawan landfill was officially
reopened by Acting Mayor Margot.
On September 23, 2016, Joel Capili Garganera for and
on his behalf, and in representation of the People of the Cities
of Cebu and Talisay and the future generations, including
the unborn (respondent) filed a petition for writ of kalikasan
with prayer for the issuance of a Temporary Environmental
Protection Order (TEPO) before the CA.
Ruling: Petitioner Osmena argues that respondent
Garganera brushed aside the 30-day prior notice requirement
for citizen suits under R.A. 9003 and R.A. 8749.
Here, the present petition for writ of kalikasan under
the Rules of Procedure in Environmental Cases (RPEC) is a
separate and distinct action from R.A. 9003 (Ecological Solid
Waste Management Act of 2000) and R.A. 8749 (The Philippine
Clean Air Act of 1999). A writ of kalikasan is an extraordinary
remedy covering environmental damage of such magnitude
that will prejudice the life, health, or property of inhabitants
in two or more cities or provinces.
Given that the writ of kalikasan is an extraordinary
remedy and the RPEC allows direct action to this Court and the
CA where it is dictated by public welfare, this Court is of the

834

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

view that the prior 30 day notice requirement for citizen suits
under R.A. 9003 and R.A. 8749 is inapplicable. It is ultimately
within the Court's discretion whether or not to accept petitions
brought directly before it.
The Court is convinced from the evidence on record that
the respondent has sufficiently established the aforementioned
requirements for the grant of the privilege of the writ of
kalikasan. The record discloses that the City Government's
resumption of the garbage dumping operations at the Inayawan
landfill has raised serious environmental concerns.
The air and water quality impact assessment of the EMB
Compliance Evaluation Report (CER) dated August 18, 2016,
made remarks that the air quality poses a threat to nearby
surroundings/habitat while the water quality (leachate) poses
threat of water pollution.
Prescinding from the above, the EMB, DOH, Mr. Amancio
Dongcoy, a representative from the DENR-EMB, and the Cebu
and Talisay residents are all in agreement as to the need
of closing the lnayawan landfill due to the environmental
violations committed by the City Government in its operation.
The Court, while it have the jurisdiction and power to
decide cases, is not precluded from utilizing the findings and
recommendations of the administrative agency on questions
that demand "the exercise of sound administrative discretion
requiring the special knowledge, experience, and services of the
administrative tribunal to determine technical and intricate
matters of fact.
The petition is DENIED. The CA Decision and Resolution
which granted the privilege of the writ of kalikasan and
ordered petitioner Mayor 'Tomas R. Osmena, in his capacity as
City Mayor of Cebu and/or his representatives, to permanently
cease and desist from dumping or disposing of garbage or solid
waste at the lnayawan landfill and to continue to rehabilitate
the same, are hereby AFFIRMED.

Decided Cases

1.
A quorum of the Sangguniang Panlungsod should be
computed based on the total composition of the Sangguniang
Panlungsod. In this case, the Sangguniang Panlungsod of La
Carlota City, Negros Occidental is composed of the presiding officer,
ten (10) regular members, and two (2) ex officio members, or a total
of thirteen (13) members. A majority of the 13 "members" of the
Sangguniang Panlungsod, or at least seven (7) members, is needed
to constitute a quorum to transact official business. Since seven
(7) members (including the presiding officer) were present on the
March 17, 2004 regular session of the Sangguniang Panlungsod,
clearly there was a quorum such that the irrevocable resignation of
respondent was validly accepted.

Facts: On March 18, 2004, [the] then Vice-Mayor Rex
R. Jalandoon of La Carlota City, Negros Occidental appointed
Atty. Rex G. Rojo (or Rojo) who had just tendered his resignation
as member of the Sangguniang Panlungsod the day preceding
such appointment, as Sangguniang Panlungsod Secretary. The
status of the appointment was permanent. The next day, March
19, 2004, the Vice-Mayor submitted Rojo's appointment papers
to the Civil Service Commission Negros Occidental Field Office
(CSCFO-Negros Occidental) for attestation. In a Letter dated
March 24, 2004, the said CSCFO wrote Jalandoon to inform
him of the infirmities the office found on the appointment
documents. In view of the failure of the appointing authority
to comply with the directive, the said CSCFO considered the
appointment of Rojo permanently recalled or withdrawn, in a
subsequent Letter to Jalandoon dated April 14, 2004.

Ruling: On 10 October 1991, the Congress approved RA
7160 or the Local Government Code. Under Sec. 49, RA 7160,
the city vice-mayor, as presiding officer, is a member of the

Sangguniang Panlungsod.
Sec. 457, RA 7160 clearly states that the Sangguniang
Panlungsod "shall be composed of the city vice-mayor
as presiding officer, the regular sanggunian members, the
president of the city chapter of the liga ng mga barangay, the
president of the panlungsod na pederasyon ng mga sangguniang
kabataan, and the sectoral representatives, as members."
Black's Law Dictionary defines "composed of" as "formed of"
or "consisting of." As the presiding officer, the vice-mayor
can vote only to break a tie. In effect, the presiding officer
votes when it matters the most, that is, to break a deadlock
in the votes. Clearly, the vice-mayor, as presiding officer, is a
"member" of the Sangguniang Panlungsod considering that he
is mandated under Section 49 of RA 7160 to vote to break a tie.
To construe otherwise would create an anomalous and absurd
situation where the presiding officer who votes to break a tie
during a Sanggunian session is not considered a "member" of
the Sanggunian.
A quorum of the Sangguniang Panlungsod should be
computed based on the total composition of the Sangguniang
Panlungsod. In this case, the Sangguniang Panlungsod of La
Carlota City, Negros Occidental is composed of the presiding
officer, ten (10) regular members, and two (2) ex officio
members, or a total of thirteen (13) members. A majority of
the 13 "members" of the Sangguniang Panlungsod, or at least
seven (7) members, is needed to constitute a quorum to transact
official business. Since seven (7) members (including the
presiding officer) were present on the 17 March 2004 regular
session of the Sangguniang Panlungsod, clearly there was a
quorum such that the irrevocable resignation of respondent
was validly accepted.
On the issue that Rojo's appointment was issued during the
effectivity of the election ban, the Court agrees with the finding
of the Court of Appeals and the Civil Service Commission that
since the respondent's appointment was validly issued on 18
March 2004, then the appointment did not violate the election
ban period which was from 26 March to 9 May 2004. Indeed,
the Civil Service Commission found that despite the lack of
signature and certification ofthe Human Resource Management

It is not competent for the Sangguniang Panlungsod of
Cagayan de Oro City to enact Ordinance 3353 (prohibiting the use

MAGTAJAS v. PRYCE PROPERTIES CORP., INC.
234 SCRA 255, July 20, 1994, Padilla, J.
Facts: When the Philippine Amusement and Gaming
Corporation (PAGCOR) opened a branch in Cagayan de Oro
City, there was an instant opposition from different sectors of
the community, including the local government. In fact, the

840

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

mayor of the City of Cagayan de Oro brought this petition
attacking, among others, gambling as intrinsically harmful
and citing various provisions of the Constitution and several
decisions of the Court expressive of the general and official
disapprobation of the vice.
They invoke the State policies on the family and the
proper upbringing of the youth and call attention to the old
case of U.S. v. Salaveria (39 Phil. 102) which sustained a
municipal ordinance prohibiting the playing of panguingue.
The petitioners decry the immorality of gambling. They also
impugn the wisdom of P.D. 1869 (which they describe as "a
martial law instrument") in creating PAGCOR and authorizing
it to operate casinos.
Held: Under Sec. 458 of the Local Government Code, local
government units are authorized to prevent or suppress, among
others, "gambling and other prohibited games of chance."
Obviously, this provision excludes games of chance which are
not prohibited but in fact permitted by law. The petitioners
are less than accurate in claiming that the Code could have
excluded such games of chance but did not. In fact, it does. The
language of the section is clear and unmistakable. Under the
rule of noscitur a sociis, a word or phrase should be interpreted
in relation to, or given the same meaning of, words with which
it is associated. Accordingly, we conclude that since the word
"gambling" is associated with "and other prohibited games of
chance," the word should be read as referring to only illegal
gambling which, like the other prohibited games of chance,
must be prevented or suppressed.
This basic relationship between the national legislature
and the local government units has not been enfeebled by the
new provisions in the Constitution strengthening the policy,
we here confirm that Congress retains control of the local
government units although in significantly reduced degree now
than under our previous constitutions. The power to grant still
includes the power to destroy. The power to grant still includes
the power to withhold or recall. True, there are certain notable
innovations in the Constitution, like the direct conferment on
the local government units of the power to tax, which cannot
now be withdrawn by mere statute. By and large, however, the
national legislature is still the principal of the local government
units, which cannot defy its will or modify or violate it.

Book III - Local Government Unite
Title Three -- The City

841

We hold that the power of PAGCOR to centralize and
regulate all games of chance, including casinos on land and sea
within the territorial jurisdiction of the Philippines, remains
unimpaired. P.D. 1869 has not been modified by the Local
Government Code, which empowers the local government units
to prevent or suppress only those forms of gambling prohibited
bylaw.
Casino gambling is authorized by P.D. 1869. This decree
has the status of a statute that cannot be amended or nullified
by a mere ordinance. Hence, it was not competent for the
Sangguniang Panlungsod of Cagayan de Oro City to enact
Ordinance No. 3353 prohibiting the use of buildings for the
operation of casinos and Ordinance No. 3375-93 prohibiting
the operation of casinos. For all their praiseworthy motives,
these ordinances are contrary to P.D. 1869 and the public policy
announced therein and are therefore ultra vires and void.
(vi) Protect the environment and
impose appropriate penalties for acts
which endanger the environment, such
as dynamite fishing and other forms of
destructive fishing, illegal logging and
smuggling of logs, smuggling of natural

which result in pollution, acceleration of
eutrophication of rivers and lakes or of
ecological imbalance;
(vii) Subject to the provisions of
this Code and pertinent laws, determine
the powers and duties of officials and
employees of the city;
(viii) Determine the positions and
the salaries, wages, allowances and other
emoluments and benefits of officials and

when Marikina became a city on December 6, 1996. Pursuant to
Republic Act No. 7160, the Local Government Code of 1991, the
legislative body of Marikina passed Ordinance No. 21, series
of 1995; Ordinance No. 9, series of 1996; and Orclinance No.
200, series of 1996, which approved the budget allocations for
Marikina for calendar years 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively.
Allotted in each of these were allowances and benefits granted
to COA personnel assigned to Marikina, including petitioner.

() Provide a mechanism and
appropriate funds therefor, to ensure
the safety and protection of all city
government property, public documents,
or records such as those relating to
property inventory, land ownership,

assessments, taxation, accounts, business
permits, and such other records and
documents of public interest in the offices
and departments of the city government;

The Special Audit Team learned of the allowances given
to COA personnel by the City of Marikina and it declared these
to have been received in violation of Section 18 of Republic
Act No. 6758, An Act Prescribing a Revised Compensation

for Other Purposes, COA Memorandum 89-584 and COA
Chairman's lndorsement dated March 23, 1995.

Decided Case

Section 18 of Republic Act No. 6758 provides the following:
"SECTION 18. Additional Compensation of
Commission on Audit Personnel and of Other Agencies.
In order to preserve the independence and integrity of the
Commission on Audit (COA), its officials and employees
are prohibited from receiving salaries, honoraria, bonuses,
allowances or other emoluments from any government
entity, local government unit, and government-owned
and controlled corporations, and government financial
institution, except those compensation paid directly by
the COA out of its appropriations and contributions.

1.
Under the Local Government Code, local legislative bodies
may provide for additional allowances and other benefits to national
government officials stationed or assigned to their municipality or
city. This authority, however, is not without limitation, as it does
not include the grant of benefits that runs in conflict with other
statutes, such as R.A. 6758, which prohibits COA personnel from
receiving allowances from LG Us.

benefits to judges, prosecutors, public elementary
and high school teachers, and other national
government officials stationed in or assigned to the
city;

844

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Petitioner argues that as an employee of the COA,
stationed in the City of Marikina, he falls under the phrase
"other national government officials" and is thus entitled
to whatever additional allowances and benefits the City of
Marikina may give such officials.
With regard to the prohibitions found in Republic Act No.
6758 and COA Memorandum 89-584, petitioner submits that
these have been necessarily repealed by the Local Government
Code, which is a later law, citing the repealing clause found in
Section 534 (f) thereof:
Ruling: In the case at bar, the two statutes can easily
be harmonized. Under the Local Government Code, local
legislative bodies may provide for additional allowances and
other benefits to national government officials stationed or
assigned to their municipality or city. This authority, however,
is not without limitation, as it does not include the grant of
benefits that runs in conflict with other statutes, such as
Republic Act No. 6758. The exception stated in these laws
must be read together with the Local Government Code, so as
to make both the Code and these laws equally effective and
mutually complementary.
Petitioner next argues that Section 18 of Republic Act No.
6758 violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.
Petitioner ignores the well-accepted meaning of the equal
protection clause. This clause does not preclude classification
of individuals who may be accorded different treatment under
the law as long as the classification is reasonable and not
arbitrary.
Indeed, there are valid reasons to treat COA officials
differently from other national government officials. The
primary function of an auditor is to prevent irregular,
unnecessary, excessive or extravagant expenditures of
government funds. To be able properly to perform their
constitutional mandate, COA officials need to be insulated
from unwarranted influences, so that they can act with
independence and integrity. As extensively discussed in
Tejada v. Domingo, 205 SCRA 138 (1992) the prohibition
under Section 18 of Republic Act No. 6758 was designed
precisely to serve this purpose. The removal of the temptation
and enticement the extra emoluments may provide is designed
to be an effective way of vigorously and aggressively enforcing

Book III --- Local Government Units
Title Three - The City

846

the Constitutional provision mandating the COA to prevent
or disallow irregular, unnecessary, excessive, extravagant, or
unconscionable expenditures or uses of government funds and
properties.
This Court affirms COA Decision No. 2000-266 finding
petitioner guilty of neglect of duty, simple misconduct and
violation ofreasonable office rules and regulations and ordering
him to pay a fine equivalent to one month and one day's salary,
and to refund the amount he received without authority from
the City of Marikina. The amount to be refunded, however,
will have to be recomputed by the COA in conformity with this
decision.
(xii) Provide legal assistance to
barangay officials who, in the performance
of their official duties or in the occasion
thereof, have to initiate judicial proceedings
or defend themselves against legal action;
and
(xiii) Provide for group insurance
or additional insurance coverage for all
barangay officials, including members of
barangay ta nod brigades and other service
units, with public or private insurance
companies, when the finances of the city
government allow said coverage.
(2) Generate and maximize the use of
resources and revenues for the development
plans, program objectives and priorities of
the city as provided for under Section 18 of
this Code, with particular attention to agroindustrial development and city-wide growth
and progress, and relative thereto, shall:
(i) Approve
the

against owners and operators of businesses, including herein

(Petron), from operating in the designated commercial zone-an
industrial zone prior to the enactment of Ordinance No. 8027

rights to life, security and safety of the inhabitants of Manila;"
(2) that it had passed the tests of a valid ordinance; and (3) that
it is not superseded by Ordinance No. 8119. Declaring that
it is constitutional and valid, the Court accordingly ordered
its immediate enforcement with a specific directive on the
relocation and transfer of the Pandacan oil terminals.

even if the contents have been lessened. In the absence of any
convincing reason to persuade this Court that the life, security
and safety of the inhabitants of Manila are no longer put at
risk by the presence of the oil depots, we hold that Ordinance
No. 8187 in relation to the Pandacan Terminals is invalid and
unconstitutional.

Highlighting that the Court has so ruled that the
Pandacan oil depots should leave, herein petitioners now
seek the nullification of Ordinance No. 8187, which contains
provisions contrary to those embodied in Ordinance No. 8027.
Violations of the right to health and the right to a healthful
and balanced environment are alleged.

WHEREFORE, in light of all the foregoing, Ordinance
No. 8187 is hereby declared UNCONSTITUTIONAL and
INVALID with respect to the continued stay of the Pandacan
Oil Terminals.

Ruling: The Local Government Code of 1991 expressly
provides that the Sangguniang Panlungsod is vested with
the power to "reclassify land within the jurisdiction of the
city" (Sec 458 (a) 2) II, LGC) subject to the pertinent
provisions of the Code. It is also settled that an ordinance may
be modified or repealed by another ordinance. These have been
properly applied in G.R. No. 156052, where the Court upheld
the position of the Sangguniang Panlungsod to reclassify the
land subject of the Ordinance, and declared that the mayor
has the duty to enforce Ordinance No. 8027, provided that
it has not been repealed by the Sangguniang Panlungsod or
otherwise annulled by the courts. In the same case, the Court
also used the principle that the Sanguniang Panlungsod is in
the best position to determine the needs of its Constituentsthat the removal of the oil depots from the Pandacan area is
necessary "to protect the residents of Manila from catastrophic
devastation in case of a terrorist attack on the Pandacan
Terminals."
Both law and jurisprudence support the constitutionality
and validity of Ordinance No. 8027. Without a doubt, there are
no impediments to its enforcement and implementation. Any
delay is unfair to the inhabitants of the City of Manila and its
lenders who have categorically expressed their desire for the
relocation of the terminals. Their power to chart and control
their own destiny and preserve their lives and safety should
not be curtailed by the intervenors' warnings of doomsday
scenarios and threats of economic disorder if the ordinance is
enforced.
The same best interest of the public guides the present
decision. The Pandacan oil depot remains a terrorist target

The incumbent mayor of the City of Manila is hereby
ordered to CEASE and DESIST from enforcing Ordinance
No. 8187. In coordination with the appropriate government
agencies and the parties herein involved, he is further ordered
to oversee the relocation and transfer of the oil terminals out of
the Pandacan area.
As likewise required in G.R. No. 156052, the intervenors
Chevron Philippines, Inc., Pilipinas Shell Petroleum

Decided Case

1.
An ordinance prohibiting theater owners to require
children between seven (7) and twelve (12) years old to pay the full
price of admission and instead charge only half of the admission
price is unconstitutional. A police measure for the regulation of the
conduct, control and operation of business should not encroach upon
the legitimate and lawful exercise by the citizens of their property
rights.
BALACUIT v. CFI OF AGUSAN DEL NORTE
163 SCRA 182, June 30, 1988, Gancayco, J.
Facts: Ordinance 640 passed by the Municipal Board
of the City of Butuan makes it "unlawful for any person
engaged in the business of selling admission tickets to any
movie or other public exhibitions,
+
to require children
between seven (7) and twelve (12) years of age to pay full
payment for admission tickets intended for adults, but should
charge only one-half of the value of the said tickets."
A violation of the ordinance carries a penalty or fine of
not Jess than Two hundred pesos (P200) but not more than Six
thousand pesos (P6,000) or an imprisonment of not less than
two months or not more than six months or both such fine and
imprisonment.
Held: The operation of theaters, cinematographs and
other places of public exhibition are subject to regulation by

852

the municipal council in the exercise of delegated police power
by the local government.

(iii) Provide for and set the terms and
conditions under which public utilities
owned by the city shall be operated by
the city government, and prescribed the
conditions under which the same may
be leased to private persons or entities,
preferably cooperatives;

Thus, an ordinance prohibiting first-run cinematographs
from selling tickets beyond their seating capacity was upheld
as constitutional for being a valid exercise of police power. Also,
an ordinance prohibiting admission of two (2) or more persons
in the movie houses and other amusement places with the use
of only one (1) ticket is a valid regulatory police measure not
only in the interest of preventing fraud insofar as municipal
taxes are concerned but also in accordance with public health,
public safety, and the general welfare.
The ordinance here is not justified by any necessity for
the public interest. The evident purposes of the ordinance is
to help ease the burden of cost on the part of the parents who
have to shell out the same amount of money for the admission
of their children, as they would for themselves.
A reduction in the price of admission would mean
corresponding savings for the parents; however, the theater
owners are the ones made to bear the cost of these savings.
The ordinance does not make the theater owners suffer the
loss of earnings but it likewise penalizes them for failure to
comply with it. Furthermore, there will be difficulty in its
implementation because children over twelve (12) years of age
could pass off their age as below (12) years in order to avail the
benefit of the ordinance. The ordinance does not provide a safe
guard against this undesirable practice and as such, the city
suggest that birth certificates be exhibited by the moviehouse
patrons to prove the age of children. This is not practicable.
The ordinance is unreasonable if not unduly oppressive upon
the business of the theater owners. Moreover, there is no
discernible relation between the ordinance and the promotion
of public health, safety, morals and the general welfare.
A police measure for the regulation of the conduct,
control and operation of business should not encroach upon
the legitimate and lawful exercise by the citizens of their
property rights. The right of the owner to fix a price at which
his property shall be sold or used is an inherent attribute of
the property itself and, as such, within the protection of the
due process clause. Hence, the proprietors of a theater have a
right to manage their property in their own way, to fix what
prices of admission they think most for their own advantage,
and that any person who did not approve could stay away.

Decided Case

I.
The power to regulate billboards within its territorial
jurisdiction has been delegated by Congress to the city government
via the Davao City Charter. This direct and specific grant takes
precedence over requirements set forth in another law of general
application, in this case the National Building Code. Ordinance No.
092-2000 is a valid exercise of police power. However, the demolition
orders violate the 60-day notice period provided by the Ordinance.
EVASCO, JR. v. MONTANEZ
G.R. No. 199172, February 21, 2018,
Leonardo-De Castro, J.
Facts: On August 8, 2000, the city government of Davao
(City Government), through its Sangguniang Panlungsod,
approved Ordinance No. 092-2000 entitled "An Ordinance
Regulating the Construction, Repair, Renovation, Erection,
Installation and Maintenance of Outdoor Advertising Materials
and For Related Purposes." (sic)
As early as 2003, the City Engineer of Davao City (City
Engineer) started sending notices of illegal construction to
various outdoor advertising businesses, including Ad & Promo
Management (APM), owned by herein respondent Alex P.
Montanez that constructed the billboards in different areas
within the city. The City Engineer reminded the entities to
secure a sign permit or apply for a renewal for each billboard
structure as required by Ordinance No. 092-2000.
In February and March 2006, the City Engineer issued
orders of demolition directing erring outdoor advertising

854

businesses, including APM, to "voluntarily dismantle" their
billboards that violate Ordinance No. 092- 2000 within three
days from receipt of the order. Otherwise, the city government
shall summarily remove these structures without further
notice. In the orders of demolition dated March 17, 2006,
the summary removal was scheduled on March 30, 2006 at
8:30 a.m.

representatives of the people of Davao City. In local affairs, acts
of local officials must be upheld when it is clear that these were
performed squarely within the statutory authority granted to
them and in the exercise of their sound discretion.
We note that petitioner City Engineer issued orders of
demolition that required erring outdoor advertising businesses
to correct the defects of their structures within three days
from receipt of notice. Otherwise, the billboard will be
summarily removed. In said orders dated March 17, 2006 and
September 25, 2008, the summary removal operations were
March 30, 2006 and October 8, 2008, respectively. These orders
of demolition, however, violate Section 45 of the ordinance
inasmuch as the orders do not observe the reglementary
periods granted to erring billboard owners. Section 45 clearly
gives the owners at least 60 days to correct any defect suffered
by their structures and altogether comply with the ordinance
requirements.

With the impending demolition of APM's billboard
structures, respondent Montanez sought recourse before the
RTC, of Davao City on March 28, 2006 and filed a petition for
injunction and declaration of nullity of Ordinance No. 092-2000
and order of demolition dated March 17, 2006 with application
for a writ of preliminary injunction and temporary restraining
order docketed as Sp. Civil Case No. 31, 346-06.
The CA declared Secs. 7, 8, 37 and 45 of the Ordinance
null and void for being contrary to PD 1096 or the National
Building Code of the Philippines.

The instant petition is GRANT ED. The CA Decision is
Reversed and Set Aside.

Ruling: The power to regulate billboards within its
territorial jurisdiction has been delegated by Congress to the
city government via RA 4354, the Davao City Charter. This
direct and specific grant takes precedence over requirements
set forth in another law of general application, in this case the
National Building Code.

(v) Any law to the contrary
notwithstanding, authorize and license
the
establishment,
operation,

should not be prejudiced;

An ordinance constitutes a valid exercise of police power
if: (a) it has a lawful subject such that the interests of the
public generally, as distinguished from those of a particular
class, require its exercise; and (b) it uses a lawful method
such that its implementing measures must be reasonably
necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose and not
unduly oppressive upon individuals.
First, Ordinance No. 092-2000 seeks to regulate all signs
and sign structures based on prescribed standards as to its
location, design, size, quality of materials, construction and
maintenance to: (a) safeguard the life and property of Davao
City's inhabitants; (b) keep the surroundings clean and orderly;
(c) ensure public decency and good taste; and (d) preserve a
harmonious aesthetic relationship of these structures as
against the general surroundings.

LAND TRANSPORTATION OFFICE v.
CITY OF BUTUAN
322 SCRA 805, January 20, 2000, Vitug, J.
Facts: The Court is asked in this instance to resolve the
issue of whether under the present set up the power of the
Land Registration Office to register, tricycles in particular,
as well as to issue licenses for the driving thereof, has been
likewise devolved to local government units.
The RTC of Butuan City held that the authority to
register tricycles, the grant of the corresponding franchise, the
issuance of tricycle drivers' license, and the collection of fees
therefor had all been vested in the Local Government Units.
Accordingly, it decreed the issuance of a permanent writ of
injunction against LTO, prohibiting and enjoining LTO, as
well as its employees and other persons acting in its behalf,
from (a) registering tricycles and (b) issuing licenses to drivers
of tricycles. The Court of Appeals, on appeal sustained the trial
court. Hence, this petition.

Held: The petition is impressed with merit. The
Department of Transportation and Communications,
through the LTO and the LTFRB, has since been tasked
with implementing laws pertaining to land transportation.
The LTO is a line agency under the DOTC whose powers and
functions, pursuant to the Land Transportation and Traffic
Code, as amended, deals with the registration of all motor
vehicles and the licensing of drivers thereof. The LTFRB, upon
the other hand, is the governing body tasked by E.O. No. 202,
to regulate the operation of public utility or "for hire" vehicles
and to grant franchises or certificates of public convenience.
Finely put, registration and licensing functions are vested in
the LTO while franchising and regulatory responsibilities had
been vested in the LTFRB.
Under the Local Government Code, certain functions of
the DOTC were transferred to the LGUs, thus: SECTION 468.
Powers, Duties, Functions and Compensation. (4) Subject to
the guidelines prescribed by the Department of Transportation
and Communications, regulate the operation of tricycles and
grant franchises for the operation thereof within the territorial
jurisdiction of the city. LG Us indubitably now have the power
to regulate the operation of tricycles-for-hire and to grant
franchises for the operation thereof. Nevertheless it may not

Book III Local Government Units
Title 'Three - The City

857

be amiss to state that under Article 458 (a)(3-VI) of the Local
Government Code, the power of LG Us to regulate the operation
of tricycles and to grant franchises for the operation thereof is
still subject to the guidelines prescribed by the DOTC.
To construe the tax provisions of Section 133 indistinctively
would result in the repeal to that extent of LTO's regulatory
power which evidently has not been intended. If it were
otherwise, the law could have just said so in Sections 447 and
458 of the Local Government Code in the same manner that the
specific devolution of LTFRB's power on franchising of tricycles
has been provided. Repeal by implication is not favored.
The power over tricycles by the LGUs is the power
to regulate their operation and to grant franchises for the
operation thereof. The exclusionary clause contained in the
tax provisions of Section 133(1) of the Local Government Code
must not be held to have had the effect of withdrawing the
express power of LTO to [•]cause the registration of all motor
vehicles and the issuance of licenses for the driving thereof.
(vii) Upon approval by a majority
vote of all the members of the sangguniang
panlungsod: grant a franchise to any
person partnership, corporation, or
cooperative to do business within the
city; establish, construct, operate and
maintain ferries, wharves, markets or
slaughterhouses; or undertake such other
activities within the city as may be
allowed by existing laws: Provided, That,
cooperatives shall be given preference in
the grant of such franchise;

of land, buildings and structures within the
city in order to promote the general welfare
and for said purpose shall:

Facts: Private respondent Malate Tourist Development
Corporation (MTDC) is a corporation engaged in operating
hotels, motels, hostels and lodging houses. It built and opened
Victoria Court in Malate which was licensed as a motel
although duly accredited with the Department of Tourism as a
hotel. [On] 28 June 1993, MTDC fled a Petition for Declaratory
Relief with Prayer for a Writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or

court impleading as defendants, herein petitioners City of
Manila, Hon. Alfredo S. Lim (Lim), Hon. Joselito L. Atienza,
and the members of the City Council of Manila (City Council).
MTDC prayed that the Ordinance, insofar as it includes motels
and inns as among its prohibited establishments, be declared
invalid and unconstitutional.
Enacted by the City Council on 9 March 1993 and approved
by petitioner City Mayor on 30 March 1993, Ordinance No.
7783 provides:
SECTION 1. Any provision of existing laws and
ordinances to the contrary notwithstanding, no person,

West, pursuant to P.D. 499 be allowed or authorized
to contract and engage in, any business providing
certain forms of amusement, entertainment,
services and facilities where women are used as
tools in entertainment and which tend to disturb
the community, annoy the inhabitants, and
adversely affect the social and moral welfare of the

comm unity, such as but not limited to: l. Sauna Parlors;
2. Massage Parlors; 3. Karaoke Bars; 4. Beerhouses;
5. Night Clubs; 6. Day Clubs; 7. Super Clubs;
8. Discotheques; 9. Cabarets; 10. Dance Halls; 11. Motels;
12. Inns.
Under Sec. 2 of the Ordinance, the city officials are
prohibited from issuing permits or licenses to the above
businesses. Sec. 3 thereof, gives 3 months for the owners/
operators to wind up operations, to transfer to any place
outside of the Ermita-Malate Area, or to convert to other
kinds of business allowable within the area. Sec. 4 provides for
imprisonment or fine and closure.
Ruling: Under Section 458 (a) (4) (iv), with respect to
cafes, restaurants, beerhouses, hotels, motels, inns, pension
houses, lodging houses, and other similar establishments, the
only power of the City Council to legislate relative thereto is
to regulate them to promote the general welfare. The Code
still withholds from cities the power to suppress and prohibit
altogether the establishment, operation and maintenance of
such establishments.
Similarly, the City Council exercises regulatory powers
over public dancing schools, public dance halls, sauna baths,
massage parlors, and other places for entertainment or
amusement as found in the first clause of Section 458 (a) 4 (vii).
Its powers to regulate, suppress and suspend "such other events
or activities for amusement or entertainment, particularly
those which tend to disturb the community or annoy the
inhabitants" and to "prohibit certain forms of amusement or
entertainment in order to protect the social and moral welfare
of the community" are stated in the second and third clauses,
respectively of the same Section. The several powers of the City
Council as provided in Section 458 (a) 4 (vii) of the Code, it is
pertinent to emphasize, are separated by semi-colons (;), the
use of which indicates that the clauses in which these powers
are set forth are independent of each other albeit closely
related to justify being put together in a single enumeration
or paragraph. These powers, therefore, should not be confused,
commingled or consolidated as to create a conglomerated and
unified power of regulation, suppression and prohibition.
The Congress unequivocably specified the establishments
and forms of amusement or entertainment subject to

Book III - Local Government Units
Title Three - The City

861

regulation . among which are beerhouses, hotels, motels,
inns, pension houses, lodging houses, and other similar
establishments (Section 458 [a] 4 [iv]), public dancing schools,
public dance halls, sauna baths, massage parlors, and other
places for entertainment or amusement (Section 458 [a] 4
[vii]). This enumeration therefore cannot be included as among
"other events or activities for amusement or entertainment
particularly those which tend to disturb the community or
annoy the inhabitants" or "certain forms of amusement or
entertainment" which the City Council may suspend, suppress
or prohibit.
Notably, the City Council was conferred powers to prevent
and prohibit certain activities and establishments in another
section of the Code, Section 458 (a) 1 (v) which provides:
(v) Enact ordinances intended to prevent,
suppress and impose appropriate penalties for habitual
drunkenness in public places, vagrancy, mendicancy,
prostitution, establishment and maintenance of houses
of ill repute, gambling and other prohibited games of
chance, fraudulent devices and ways to obtain money or
property, drug addiction, maintenance of drug dens, drug
pushing, juvenile delinquency, the printing, distribution
or exhibition of obscene or pornographic materials or
publications, and such other activities inimical to the
welfare and morals of the inhabitants of the city;

If it were. the intention of Congress to confer upon
the City Council the power to prohibit the establishments
enumerated in Section 1 of the Ordinance, it would have so
declared in uncertain terms by adding them to the list of the
matters it may prohibit under the above-quoted Section. The
Ordinance now vainly attempts to lump these establishments
with houses of ill-repute and expand the City Council's powers
in the second and third clauses of Section 458 (a) 4 (vii) of
the Code in an effort to overreach its prohibitory powers. It
is evident that these establishments may only be regulated in
their establishment, operation and maintenance.
It is important to distinguish the punishable
activities from the establishments themselves. That these
establishments are recognized legitimate enterprises can be

862

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANN OTATED

gleaned from another Section of the Code. Section 131 under
the Title on Local Government Taxation expressly mentioned
proprietors or operators of massage clinics, sauna, Turkish and
Swedish baths, hotels, motels and lodging houses as among
the "contractors" defined in paragraph (h) thereof. The same
Section also defined "amusement" as a "pleasurable diversion
and entertainment," "synonymous to relaxation, avocation,
pastime or fun;" and "amusement places" to include "theaters,
cinemas, concert halls, circuses and other places of amusement
where one seeks admission to entertain oneself by seeing or
viewing the show or performances." Thus, it can be inferred
that the Code considers these establishments as legitimate
enterprises and activities. It is well to recall the maxim reddendo
singula singulis which means that words in different parts of
a statute must be referred to their appropriate connection,
giving to each in its place, its proper force and effect, and, if
possible, rendering none of them useless or superfluous, even if
strict grammatical construction demands otherwise. Likewise,
where words under consideration appear in different sections
or are widely dispersed throughout an act the same principle
applies.

An ordinance of Quezon City requiring memorial park
operators to set aside at least six percent (6%) of their cemetery
for charity burial of deceased persons is not a valid exercise of
police power, and one that constitutes taking of property without
just compensation. (City of Government of Quezon City v. Ericta, 12
SCRA 759.)

All considered, the Ordinance invades fundamental
personal and property rights and impairs personal privileges. It
is constitutionally infirm. The Ordinance contravenes statutes;
it is discriminatory and unreasonable in its operation; it is not
sufficiently detailed and explicit that abuses may attend the
enforcement of its sanctions. And not to be forgotten, the City
Council under the Code had no power to enact the Ordinance
and is therefore ultra vires, null and void.

(Note: The Court declared that the Ordinance also infringes
the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the
Constitution.)

An ordinance which prohibits the sale of fresh meat

CO KIAM v. CITY OF MANILA
69 Phil. 649, February 28, 1955, Reyes, A., J.
Facts: Ordinance No. 3563 of the City of Manila bans
the sale of fresh meat outside the city markets. Plaintiffs are
Chinese citizens doing business in the city, selling both fresh
and refrigerated meat in their stores outside the city markets.
At the time the ordinance in question was enacted, there was
already Ordinance 3555 forbidding the sale of fresh meat
around the city markets within two hundred (200) meters from
the boundaries thereof, and, to comply with that ordinance,
plaintiffs had their stores located at more than that distance
from any city market. But the new ordinance prohibits the
sale of fresh meat anywhere outside of the city markets, thus
making illegal for plaintiffs to continue vending fresh meat in
their aforementioned stores. Plaintiffs brought this action to
annul the ordinance.

Held: The City of Manila is expressly authorized by its
charter to establish, maintain and regulate public markets
and slaughterhouses and prohibit or permit the establishment
or operation thereof by private persons. It is also specifically
empowered to regulate the sale of meat. And in addition, it
has the authority, in the exercise of its police power under
the general welfare clause, to enact all ordinances it may
deem necessary and proper for the sanitation and safety, the
furtherance of the prosperity, and the promotion of the morality,
peace, good order, comfort, convenience, and general welfare
of the city and its inhabitants. An ordinance which prohibits
the sale of fresh meat except at the public market does not
prohibit the business of vending meat but merely localize the
sale thereof, confining the sale to the city public markets with
a view to facilitating police inspection and supervision in the
interest of public health.
The mere fact that some individuals in the community
may be deprived of their present business or a particular mode
of earning a living cannot prevent the exercise of the police
power. Persons licensed to pursue occupations which may
in the public need and interest be affected by the exercise
of police power embark in those occupations subject to the
disadvantages which may result from the legal exercise of that
power. Ordinance in question is valid.

44 SCRA 405, February 28, 1972, Reyes, J.B.L., J.
Facts: In 1968, City Ordinance No. 6696 was approved
raising the market stall fees to be charged in all city markets.
Petitioners brought action questioning the legality of said
ordinance on the ground that the city charter of Manila only
authorizes the collection of fees and the raise in the market
stall fees will make this a source ofrevenue. While the case was
pending, the Municipal Board approved Ordinance No. 6767
lowering the market stall fees as provided for by Ordinance No.
6696, but still much higher than the old rate. The legality of
the second ordinance was subjected to the same attack. Lower
court upheld the validity of the ordinances in question. Hence,
this appeal.
Held: The question to be resolved is whether the
enactment of Ordinance No. 6767 was in the exercise of the
governmental or the proprietary function of the city, being
agreed by the parties that if the enactment was governmental,
the city may only collect such fees as would cover supervision of
the markets stalls, but if proprietary, the city may charge said
fees for revenue purposes.
Assuming, ad arguendo, that under Sec. 18(cc) of R.A.
409, respondent is only authorized to charge reasonable fees
for the use of public markets, in an amount sufficient to cover
the cost of supervision, maintenance and regulation, still the
power was broadened by R.A. 2264 (The Local Autonomy Act).
Sec. 2 of which grants all chartered cities, municipalities and
municipal districts authority to impose municipal license taxes
or fees upon persons engaged in any occupation or business or
exercising privileges in chartered cities.
Persons selling in public markets are engaged in
occupation or business (in the sense of engaging in human
activity for profit). Therefore, it can impose fees above or in
addition to the amount needed to reimburse it for strictly
supervisory services.

While the ordinances enacted by the City of Manila is
dominant, it's dominant force loses continuity when it approaches
the realm of "ordinances levying or imposing taxes, fees and other
charges" in particular. The Local Tax Code prevails over the Charter
of the City of Manila.
BAGATSING v. RAMIREZ
74 SCRA 306, December 17, 1976, Martin, J.
Facts: The City of Manila passed an ordinance increasing
the fees for markets stall. An association of market vendors
challenged the validity on the ground that it was not published
in the newspaper of general circulation before it was enacted,
as required by the Charter of the City of Manila.
Held: The provisions of the Charter of the City of Manila
in question which requires publication before enactment is
general, for it applies to all kinds of ordinances, irrespective of
their nature and scope. On the other hand, the provisions of the
Local Tax Code which requires publication after the approval
of ordinances imposing charges, fees and other charges by
publication in a newspaper or posting in public is particular.
Hence, the latter prevails. The ordinance is valid.

A market which is permitted to operate under government
license for service to the general public is a public market, whether
the building on which it is housed or the land upon which it is built
is of private or public ownership. Hence, it is subject to the local
government's supervision and control.
CRUZv.CA
153 SCRA 142, November 18, 1987, Gutierrez, Jr., J.
Held: The establishment and maintenance of public
markets is by law among the legislative powers of the City of
Manila. Since the operation of the Padre Rada Market was
authorized by a Municipal Board resolution and approved by
the City Mayor, as provided by law, it follows that a withdrawal
of the whole or a portion from use as a public market must be
subject to the same joint action of the Board and the Mayor. The
Mayor of Manila, by himself, cannot provide for the opening,
operations, and closure of a public market.
A market is a "public market" when it is dedicated to the
service of the general public and is operated under government

supervision as a public utility, whether it is owned by the
government or any instrumentality thereof or by any private
individual. A public market may be the object of individual
ownership or lease, subject to municipal supervision and
control.

If a market has been permitted to operate under
government license for service of the general public, it is "public
market" whether the building that houses it or the land upon
which it is built is of private or public ownership.
The Padre Rada market is a public market which
happens to be privately-owned and privately operated. As such
public market, it should be subject to the local government's
supervision and control. Its conversion into a private market or
its closure must follow the procedures laid down by law.

necessary for the police power of the State to step in for the
benefit of all. Reasonable restrictions have to be provided for
the use of thoroughfares. The operation of public service may
be subjected to restraints and burdens, in order to secure
the general comfort. Public welfare lies at the bottom of any
regulatory measure designed to relieve congestion of traffic,
which is a menace to public safety. As a corollary, measures
calculated to promote the safety and convenience of the people
using the, thoroughfares by the regulation of vehicular traffic,
present a proper subject for the exercise of police power.

1.
Ordinance 4968 of the City of Manila regulating the
entry of provincial buses and jeepneys to Manila, to prevent traffic
congestion is a valid ordinance.
LUQUE v. VILLEGAS
30 SCRA 408, November 28, 1969, Sanchez, J.
Facts: Petitioners are passengers from the provinces who
ride on buses plying along the routes between said provinces
and Manila, public service operators operating PUB and PUJ
vehicles from the provinces with terminals in Manila, and
PUB and PUJ or AC operators operating within Manila and
suburbs. Petitioners here questioned the constitutionality
of Ordinance No. 4986 of the City of Manila which provided
that provincial passenger buses and jeepneys shall be allowed
to enter Manila only in certain entry points and routes and
certain hours except Sundays and holidays on the ground
that the regulations in question destroy their vested right to
operate inside Manila and also impair the vested rights of bus
passengers to be transported directly to downtown Manila.

A.

Held: Petitioner's possession of valid and subsisting
certificates of public convenience do not place in them a vested
right to operate their PUBs to and from Manila, for the very
nature of a certificate of public convenience does not fall
within the concept of vested rights. The accepted view is that
a certificate of public convenience constitutes neither franchise
nor a contract, confers no property right, and is mere license or
privilege. Such certificate is subject to the regulatory powers of
the Public Service Commission.

I.
The terms encroachment and obstacles used in Section 458
of the LGC, were broad enough to include illegally parked vehicles
or whatever else obstructed the streets, alleys and sidewalks. which
were precisely the subject of Ordinance No. 1664 in avowedly aiming
to ensure "a smooth flow of vehicular traffic in all the streets in the
City of Cebu at all times" (Section 1). The clamping of the illegally
parked vehicles was a fair and reasonable way to enforce the
ordinance against its transgressors; otherwise, the transgressors
would evade liability by simply driving away.

The right of passengers to be transported to downtown
Manila directly is not impaired for such right, to a great extent,
is dependent upon the manner public service are allowed to
operate within a given area, regulations imposed upon public
services being directly affecting bus passengers.
If petitioners have enjoyed the privilege of having been
allowed to operate within Manila or transported directly even
before the war, it is because circumstances allow. But times
have changed. Vehicles have increased in number and traffic
congestion has moved from bad to worse or from tolerable
to critical. It is because of all of these that it has become

Decided Cases

LEGASPI v. CITY OF CEBU
711 SCRA 791, December 10, 2013, Bersamin, J.
Facts: On January 27, 1997 the Sangguniang Panlungsod
of the City of Cebu enacted Ordinance No. 1664 to authorize the
traffic enforcers of Cebu City to immobilize any motor vehicle
violating the parking restrictions and prohibitions defined in
Ordinance No. 801 (Traffic Code of Cebu City).
On July 29, 1997, Atty. Bienvenido Jaban (Jaban, Sr.) and
his son Atty. Bienvenido Douglas Jaban (Jaban, Jr.) brought
suit in the RTC in Cebu City against the City of Cebu, seeking

870

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the declaration of Ordinance No. 1644 as unconstitutional for
being in violation of due process and for being contrary to Jaw.
Their complaint alleged that on June 23, 1997, Jaban,
Sr. had properly parked his car in a paying parking area on
Manalili Street, Cebu City to get certain records and documents
from his office; that upon his return after less than 10 minutes,
he had found his car being immobilized by a steel clamp, and
a notice being posted on the car to the effect that it would be a
criminal offense to break the clamp; that he had been infuriated
by the immobilization of his car because he had been thereby
rendered unable to meet an important client on that day; that
his car was impounded for three days, and was informed at the
office of the CITOM that he had first to pay P4,200.00 as a fine
to the City Treasurer of Cebu City for the release of his car.
On August 11, 1997, Valentino Legaspi (Legaspi) likewise
sued in the RTC the City of Cebu,T.C. Sayson, Ricardo Ha pi tan
and John Does to demand the delivery of personal property,
declaration of nullity of the Traffic Code of Cebu City, and
damages.
Ruling: The Jabans contend that Ordinance No. 1664,
by leaving the confiscation and immobilization of the motor
vehicles to the traffic enforcers or the regular personnel of
the Philippine National Police (PNP) instead of to officials
exercising judicial authority, was violative of the constitutional
guaranty of due process. On his part, Legaspi likewise
contends that Ordinance No. 1664 violated the constitutional
guaranty of due process for being arbitrary and oppressive;
and that its provisions conferring upon the traffic enforcers the
absolute discretion to be the enforcers, prosecutors, judges, and
collectors all at the same time were vague and ambiguous.
The contentions of the petitioners cannot be sustained.
Even under strict scrutiny review, Ordinance No. 1664 met
the substantive tests of validity and constitutionality by its
conformity with the limitations under the Constitution and
the statutes, as well as with the requirements of fairness and
reason, and its consistency with public policy.
To us, the terms encroachment and obstacles used in
Section 458 of the LGC, supra, were broad enough to include
illegally parked vehicles or whatever else obstructed the
streets, alleys and sidewalks, which were precisely the subject

Book III Local Government Units
Tile 'Three - The City

871

of Ordinance No. 1664 in avowedly aiming to ensure "a smooth
flow of vehicular traffic in all the streets in the City of Cebu at
all times" (Section 1).
Considering that traffic congestions were already retarding
the growth and progress in the population and economic centers
of the country, the plain objective of Ordinance No. 1664 was
to serve the public interest and advance the general welfare in
the City of Cebu. Its adoption was, therefore, in order to fulfill
the compelling government purpose of immediately addressing
the burgeoning traffic congestions caused by illegally parked
vehicles obstructing the streets of the City of Cebu.
The petitioners further assert that drivers or vehicle
owners affected by Ordinance No. 1664 like themselves were
not accorded the opportunity to protest the clamping, towing,
and impounding of the vehicles, or even to be heard and to
explain their side prior to the immobilization of their vehicles;
and that the ordinance was oppressive and arbitrary for that
reason.
Notice and hearing are the essential requirements
of procedural due process. Yet, there are many instances
under our laws in which the absence of one or both of such
requirements is not necessarily a denial or deprivation
of due process. Among the instances are the cancellation of
the passport of a person being sought for the commission of
a crime, the preventive suspension of a civil servant facing
administrative charges, the distraint of properties to answer
for tax delinquencies, the padlocking of restaurants found
to be unsanitary or of theaters showing obscene movies, and
the abatement of nuisance per se. Add to them the arrest of a
person in flagrante delicto.
The clamping of the petitioners' vehicles pursuant to
Ordinance No. 1664 (and of the vehicles of others similarly
situated) was of the same character as the aforecited established
exceptions dispensing with notice and hearing. As already said,
the immobilization of illegally parked vehicles by clamping the
tires was necessary because the transgressors were not around
at the time of apprehension. Under such circumstance, notice
and hearing would be superfluous. Nor should the lack of a
trial-type hearing prior to the clamping constitute a breach of
procedural due process. In other words, the prior intervention
of a court of law was not indispensable to ensure a compliance
with the guaranty of due process.

872

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

To reiterate, the clamping of the illegally parked vehicles
was a fair and reasonable way to enforce the ordinance against
its transgressors; otherwise, the transgressors would evade
liability by simply driving away.
The Court DENIES the petitions.
2.
A certificate of public convenience does not vest property
rights to its holder to conduct business along the route covered in it.
This privilege is subject to compliance with local traffic regulations,
because the LTFRB authority to issue such certificates is only
supplemented to the right of local governments to control and
regulate traffic in their localities.
BAGONG REPORMAN G SAMA HAN NG MGA
TSUPER AT OPERATOR SA ROTANG PASIG QUIAP O
v. CITY OF MAN DALUYONG
G.R. No. 218593, June 15, 2020, Leonen, J.
Facts: In filing the Petition for Injunction, Bagong
Repormang Samahan sought to enforce its members' rightful
passage through the road under the Shaw Boulevard-EDSA
flyover and to enjoin the City of Mandaluyong from violating
the right. It hinged this right based on its members certificates
of public convenience to ply along this route.
Allegedly, the group's drivers were prohibited from
passing under the Shaw Boulevard-EDSA fyover where they
would usually load and unload passengers. It added that the
city's traffic enforcers would harass its members by issuing
several ordinance violation receipts for "obstruction," "no seat
belt," "disobedience," and "out of route." Yet, the group claimed,
no ordinance expressly prohibited them from passing under
the flyover; thus, the prohibition violated their certificates of
public convenience.
For its part, the City of Mandaluyong invoked Ordinance
No. 358, Series of 2005, or the City's Traffic Management
Code. Under the Ordinance, it noted, the Traffic and Parking
Management Office is authorized to adjust the turning points
and terminals of public utility buses and jeepneys. deepneys
and buses are prohibited from loading and unloading along
the Shaw Boulevard-EDSA crossing area because of traffic
congestion.

Ruling: It is settled that a certificate of public convenience
issued by the LTFRB is a mere license or privilege. It (sic) does
not vest property rights on the routes covered in it.
As early as 1966, Lagman v. City of Manila, 123 Phil.
1439 (1966) clarified that the authority to issue certificates of
public convenience does not remove a local government's power
to regulate traffic in its locality. A grantee is still required to
comply with national laws and municipal ordinances.
Petitioner, therefore, failed to establish its members' clear
legal right to pass under the Shaw Boulevard-EDSA flyover.
In Legaspi v[] City of Cebu, 723 Phil. 90 (2013) this Court
emphasized that local governments are given broad latitude in
crafting traffic rules and regulations because they are familiar
with the conditions of their localities.
Pursuant to the Local Government Code, in 2005,
respondent City of Mandaluyong enacted Ordinance No. 358,
or the Traffic Management Code of the City of Mandaluyong.
It is clear, therefore, that the regulation does not violate
the certificates of public convenience of petitioner's members. It
is a valid exercise of respondent City of Mandaluyong's power
under the Local Government Code to address traffic congestion
under the Shaw Boulevard-EDSA flyover. Thus, the second
requisite for a final injunction-that there had been a violation
of right-it is also absent in this case.
The petition is DENIED for lack of merit.

COMMISSION ON AUDIT
723 SCRA 77, April 22, 2014, Leonen, J.
Facts: Ordinance No. 08, series of 2009, of General
Santos City was passed together with its implementing rules
and regulations, designed "to entice those employees who were
unproductive due to health reasons to avail of the incentives
being offered therein by way of early retirement package."
Ordinance No. 08, Section 6. GenSan SERVES PostRetirement Incentives provides:

876

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Upon availment of early retirement, a qualified employee
shall enjoy the following in addition to the above incentives: (a)
Cash gift of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) for the sickly
employees; (b) Lifetime free medical consultation at General
Santos City Hospital; (c) Annual aid in the maximum amount
of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00), if admitted at General
Santos City Hospital; and (d) 14 karat gold ring as a token.

Ruling: The COA decision was anchored on Section
28, paragraph (b) of Commonwealth Act No. 186, otherwise
known as the Government Service Insurance Act, as amended
by Republic Act No. 4968. This proscribes all supplementary
retirement or pension plans for government employees:
(b) Hereafter, no insurance or retirement plan for
officers or employees shall be created by any employer. All
supplementary retirement or pension plans heretofore in
force in any government office, agency, or instrumentality
or corporation owned and controlled by the government, are
hereby declared inoperative or abolished: Provided, That the
rights of those who are already eligible to retire thereunder
shall not be affected.
The text of the ordinance indicates its purpose of
encouraging employees, especially those who are unproductive
due to health reasons, to avail of the program even before they
reach the compulsory retirement age. Section 6 provides for a
form of severance pay to those who availed of GenSan SERVES,
which was executed in good faith.
We should not be misled by the use of the term "retirement"
in Section 6 in determining the nature of the benefits it provides.
Labels are not determinative of substantive content. It is the
purpose behind these incentives, as read from the text of the
ordinance and as inferred from the effect of the ordinance as
applied, which must govern.
The purpose of Section 6 is also different from the benefits
proscribed in Conte v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 116422,
November 4, 1996 and the nature of its benefits must be taken
in the context of its rationale. The benefits provided in Section
6 serve its purpose of inducing petitioner city's employees,
who are unproductive due to health reasons, to retire early.
Respondent Commission on Audit's observation that the benefit
provided is broader than that provided in Conte v. Commission

Book III - Local Government Units
Title Three -- The City

877

on Audit fails to take this rationale into consideration.
Furthermore, the benefits under GenSan SERVES were only
given to a select few-the sickly and unproductive due to health
reasons. Certainly, this negates the position that the benefits
provide for supplementary retirement benefits that augment
existing retirement laws.
SECTION 458, LGC provides:
(xiv) Provide for the care of disabled persons,
paupers, the aged, the sick, persons of unsound mind,
abandoned minors, juvenile delinquents, drug dependents,
abused children and other needy and disadvantaged
persons, particularly children and youth below eighteen
(18) years of age; and, subject to availability of funds,
establish and provide for the operation of centers and
facilities for said needy and disadvantaged persons[.]
This is also consistent with the constitutional mandate
for a comprehensive approach to health development, with
priority for the needs of the sick:
Thus, the cash gift for the sickly employees, lifetime free
medical consultation in petitioner city's hospital, and other
similar benefits under Section 6 of the ordinance are valid.
The proscription under Section 28, paragraph (b) of
Commonwealth Act No. 186, as amended, does not apply to
Section 6 of the ordinance. Consequently, the Commission on
Audit acted with grave abuse of discretion when it declared the
entire ordinance void and of no effect.
The petition is PARTIALLY GRANT ED.

maintenance and improvement ofjails and

Facts: RA 1899June 22, 1957, authorized the reclamation
of foreshore lands by chartered cities and municipalities.
On May 6, 1958, invoking said law the Pasay City Council
passed Ordinance No. 121, for the reclamation of 300 hectares
of foreshore lands in Pasay City, empowering the City Mayor
to award and enter into reclamation contracts, and prescribing
terms and conditions therefor. The said Ordinance was amended

Republic Real Estate Corporation to reclaim foreshore lands of

On April 24, 1959, the Pasay City and RREC entered
into an Agreement for the reclamation of the foreshore lands
in Pasay City. On December 19, 1961, the Republic of the
Philippines ("Republic") filed a Complaint for Recovery of

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

On March 5, 1962, the Republic of the Philippines filed an
Amended Complaint questioning subject Agreement between
Pasay City and RREC on the grounds that the subject-matter
of such Agreement is outside the commerce of man, that its
terms and conditions are violative of RA 1899, and that the
said Agreement was executed without any public bidding.
On October 11, 1997, the Cultural Center of the Philippines
("CCP") whose CCP Complex now stands on part of the
reclaimed land, filed a Petition in Intervention, theorizing that
it has a direct interest in the case being the owner of subject
nine (9) lots titled in its (CCP) name, which the respondent
Court of Appeals ordered to be turned over to Pasay City.
Held: Erroneous and unsustainable is the opinion of the
CA that under RA 1899, the term "foreshore lands" includes
submerged areas. The respondent court unduly stretched
and broadened the meaning of "foreshore lands," beyond
the intentment of the law, and against the recognized legal
connotation of "foreshore lands."
We reiterate what was said in Ponce v. Gomez (L-21870)
and Ponce v. City of Cebu (L-22669) that the term "foreshore"
refers to "that part of the land adjacent to the sea which is
alternately covered and left dry by the ordinary flow of the
tides." It does not include submerged areas.
The subject matter of Pasay City Ordinance No. 121, as
amended by Ordinance No. 158, and the Agreement under
attack, is outside the intendment and scope of RA 1899, and
therefore ultra vires and null and void.
What is worse, the same Agreement was vitiated by the
glaring absence of a public bidding. Following the applicable
provision of law and hearkening to the dictates of equity, that
no one, not even the government shall unjustly enrich oneself/
itself at the expense of another, we believe and so hold, that

The provision in Article 9(2) of the Rules and Regulations
Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991 stating, "The
land area requirement shall not apply where the proposed province
is composed of one (1) or more islands," is declared VALID.

NAVARRO v. ERMITA
G.R. No 180050, April 12, 2011, Nachura, J.
Facts: On October 2, 2006, the President of the Republic
approved into law Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9355 (An Act
Creating the Province of Dinagat Islands). On December 3,
2006, the COMELEC conducted the mandatory plebiscite
for the ratification of the creation of the province under the
Local Government Code LGC). The plebiscite yielded 69,943
affirmative votes and 63,502 negative votes. With the approval
of the people from both the mother province of Surigao del
Norte and the Province of Dinagat Islands (Dinagat), the
President appointed the interim set of provincial officials who
took their oath of office on January 26, 2007. Later, during the
May 14, 2007 synchronized elections, the Dinagatnons elected
their new set of provincial officials who assumed office on July
1, 2007.

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

On November 10, 2006, petitioners Rodolfo G. Navarro,
Victor F. Bernal and Rene 0. Medina, former political leaders
of Surigao de) Norte, filed before this Court a petition for
certiorari and prohibition (G.R. No. 175158) challenging the
constitutionality of R.A. No. 9355.
They pointed out that when the law was passed, Dinagat
had a land area of 802.12 square kilometers only while the LGC
requires at least 2,000 square kilometers and a population of
only 106,951, failing to comply with Section 10, Article X of the
Constitution and of Section 461 of the LGC.
On February 10, 2010, the Court rendered its Decision
granting the petition then denied the MRs.
Ruling: It bears scrupulous notice that with respect
to the creation of barangays, land area is not a requisite
indicator of viability. However, with respect to the creation
of municipalities, component cities, and provinces, the three
(3) indicators of viability and projected capacity to provide
services, i.e., income, population, and land area, are provided
for.
But it must be pointed out that when the local government
unit to be created consists of one (1) or more islands, it is exempt
from the land area requirement as expressly provided in Section
442 and Section 450 of the LGC if the local government unit to
be created is a municipality or a component city, respectively.
This exemption is absent in the enumeration of the requisites
for the creation of a province under Section 461 of the LGC,
although it is expressly stated under Article 9(2) of the LGCIRR.
There appears neither rhyme nor reason why this
exemption should apply to cities and municipalities, but not
to provinces. In fact, considering the physical configuration of
the Philippine archipelago, there is a greater likelihood that
islands or group of islands would form part of the land area of a
newly-created province than in most cities or municipalities. It
is, therefore, logical to infer that the genuine legislative policy
decision was expressed in Section 442 (for municipalities)
and Section 450 (for component cities) of the LGC, but was
inadvertently omitted in Section 461 (for provinces). Thus,
when the exemption was expressly provided in Article 9(2)
of the LGC-IRR, the inclusion was intended to correct the

Book III - Local Government Units
Title Four The Province

885

congressional oversight in Section 461 of the LGG--and to
reflect the true legislative intent. It would, then, be in order for
the Court to uphold the validity of Article 9(2) of the LGC-IRR.
This interpretation finds merit when we consider the
basic policy considerations underpinning the principle of local
autonomy.
WHEREFORE, the Court resolved to:
GRANT the lntervenors' Motion for Reconsideration
of the Resolution dated May 12, 2010. The May 12, 2010
Resolution is RECONSIDERED and SET ASIDE. The
provision in Article 9(2) of the Rules and Regulations
Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991 stating,
"The land area requirement shall not apply where the
proposed province is composed of one (1) or more islands,"
is declared VALID. Accordingly, Republic Act No. 9355
(An Act Creating the Province of Dinagat Islands) is
declared as VALID and CONSTITUTIONAL, and the
proclamation of the Province of Dinagat Islands and the
election of the officials thereof are declared VALID.
The petition is DISMISSED.
SEC. 462. Existing Sub provinces.
Existing
sub-provinces are hereby converted into regular
provinces upon approval by a majority of the
votes cast in a plebiscite to be held in the said
sub-provinces and the original provinces directly
affected. The plebiscite shall be conducted by
the COMELEC simultaneously with the national
elections following the effectivity of this Code.
The new legislative districts created as a result
of such conversion shall continue to be represented
in Congress by the duly elected representatives
of the original districts out of which said new
provinces or districts were created until their own
representatives shall have been elected in the next

hereinbefore provided, and shall also appoint

Comm ents

1.
In Grino • COMELEC, 213 SCRA 673, the Supreme
Court ruled that the COMELEC erred in disallowing the voters
of the sub-province of Guimaras to vote for the provincial voters
of mother province Iloilo during the May 11, 1992 elections held
simultaneously with the plebiscite. However, since there was an
overwhelming vote for approval of the conversion of Guimares into a
regular province and with the appointment of the provincial officials
of Guimaras by the President, there is no more legal basis for the
calling of a special election for the voters of Guimares to vote for the
provincial officials of Iloilo.

Decided Cases

1.
As a result of the reorganization of the provincial
government of Aldan, these sixteen private respondents have been
demoted by their assignment to positions which are lower than
those they previously held, or which, though of equivalent salary
grade and step, drastically changes the nature of their work without
a showing by petitioner of the existence of a valid cause for such
demotion, which in effect is a removal.

890

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

CABAGNOT v. CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION
223 SCRA 59, June 3, 1993, Romero, J.
Facts: On September 21, 1988, the new organizational
structure and staffing pattern of the provincial government
of Aldan was approved by the Joint Commission on Local
Government Personnel Administration (JCLGPA) thru the
Director of the Bureau of Local Government Supervision.
The reorganization provided 364 regular plantilla
positions from the previous 339 with the office of the Governor
allocated 144 from the previous 60 positions.
Petition Corazon Cabagnot, Governor of Aldan seeks
reversal of Civil Service Commission Resolutions ordering the
reinstatement of private respondents to their former positions
in the Province of Aldan.

Held: The CSC found that sixteen (16) of the seventeen
(17) private respondents were demoted because of the wide
disparity between the former positions held by them and the
positions to wh.ich they were proposed by petitioner.
We hold that, as a result of the reorganization of
the provincial government of Aklan, these sixteen private
respondents have been demoted by their assignment to
positions which are lower than those they previously held, or
which, though of equivalent salary grade and step, drastically
changes the nature of their work without a showing by
petitioner of the existence of a valid cause for such demotion,
which in effect is a removal, determined after due notice and
hearing.
Assigning an employee to a lower position in the same
service which has a lower rate of compensation is a clear case
of demotion tantamount to removal when no cause is shown for
it or when it is not a part of any disciplinary action. Petitioner
stresses the fact that since private respondents would be
receiving the same rate of salary they were receiving before
the reorganization, therefore they are not demoted. In the
case of Floreza v. Ongpin, 182 SCRA 692, we ruled that there
was demotion even if Floreza was allowed to receive the same
salary as his previous higher position. Similarly, we find that
private respondents, notwithstanding non-diminution of their
salary, have been demoted. This arbitrariness has no place in

Book III
Local Government Units
Title Four - The Province

891

a government that nurtures the constitutional mandates of
security of tenure and due process.
To summarize: with respect to the sixteen private
respondents, respondent Commission committed no grave
abuse of discretion in ordering that they be "immediately
appointed and restored to their positions or positions of
comparable or equivalent rank without loss of seniority
rights with back salaries reckoned from dates they should
properly have been appointed thereto effective the date of the
reorganization of said province."
2.
The Provincial Governor appoints the provincial health
officer if the latter's salary comes from provincial funds. If the
provincial health officer's salary comes mainly from regional funds,
then the ARMM Local Code applies, in wh.ich case the Regional
Governor is the appointing power but he must appoint only from
among the three nominees of the Provincial Governor. Moreover,
the Provincial Governor exercises supervision and control over
the provincial health officer because the ARMM Local Code has
classified him as a provincial government official. This is now the
present state of the law on the appointment of provincial health
officers in the ARMM.

Facts: This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari seeking
the reversal of the decision and resolution of the Court of
Appeals which granted the Petition for a Writ of Quo Warranto
filed against petitioners Dr. Lampa I. Pandi and Dr. Jarmila B.
Macacua in favor of respondent Dr. Amer A. Saber.
The CA declared Saber entitled to the position of Officerin-Charge of the Integrated Provincial Health Offce-Amai
Pakpak General Hospital ("IPHO-APGH" for brevity), Lanao

Issue: Who is empowered to appoint the provincial health
officer of Lanao de! Sur-the Provincial Governor, the Regional
Governor or the ARMM Secretary of Health.
Held: The Local Government Code of 1991 took effect
on January 1, 1992. Unlike the 1984 LGU Code, the 1991
LGU Code made, for the first time, the provincial health

892

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

officers one of the officials of the provincial government to be
appointed by the provincial governor if his salary came mainly
from provincial funds under Sections 463 and 465. Congress
expressly made the devolved powers and functions under the
1991 LGU Code as the basic minimum for all local government
units in the ARMM precisely to put them on equal footing with
local government units outside of the ARMM. Congress was
aware that the 1991 LGU Code took effect after the Organic
Act of 1989 became law, and therefore the devolved powers
and functions under the 1991 LGU Code could not have been
incorporated into the Organic Act of 1989. Congress was also
aware that the Supreme Court had ruled, in Mata/am u.
Pangandaman, GR 114676, May 16, 1995 that the 1991 LGU
Code "being a general law, may not be made to prevail over a
special law or code" like the ARMM Local Code. Section 3 of
Article III and Section 1 of Article IV of the Organic Act of2001
corrected th.is imbalance in the devolved powers and functions
between local government units within and those outside of
the ARMM.
The passage of the Organic Act of 2001 means that the
powers and functions of a Provincial Governor under the 1991
LGU Code are now enjoyed, as a minimum, by a Provincial
Governor in the ARMM. Thus, the Provincial Governor
appoints the provincial health officer if the latter's salary
comes from provincial funds. If the provincial health officer's
salary comes mainly from regional funds, then the ARMM
Local Code applies, in which case the Regional Governor is
the appointing power but he must appoint only from among
the three nominees of the Provincial Governor. Moreover, the
Provincial Governor exercises supervision and control over the
provincial health officer because the ARMM Local Code has
classified him as a provincial government official. This is now
the present state of the law on the appointment of provincial
health officers in the ARMM. This is actually the same as the
Jaw after the effectivity of the ARMM Local Code but prior to the
passage of the Organic Act of 2001. The only difference is that
the Regional Assembly cannot amend the ARMM Local Code
to reduce or diminish this power of the Provincial Governor
because this devolved power, emanating from the 1991 LGU
Code, is now part of the Organic Act of 2001.

Decided Case

1.
Respondent provincial governor is not endowed with the
power to call upon the armed forces at his own bidding. In issuing
the assailed proclamation, Governor Tan exceeded his authority
when he declared a state of emergency and called upon the Armed
Forces, the police, and his own Civilian Emergency Force.
KULAYAN v. TAN
675 SCRA 482, July 3, 2012, Sereno, J.
Facts: On 15 January 2009, three members from the
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) were
kidnapped in the vicinity of the Provincial Capitol in Patikul,
Sulu. Andres Notter, a Swiss national and head of the ICRC in
Zamboanga City, Eugenio Vagni, an Italian national and ICRC
delegate, and Marie Jean Lacaba, a Filipino engineer, were
purportedly inspecting a water and sanitation project for the
Sulu Provincial Jail when inspecting a water and sanitation
project for the Sulu Provincial Jail when they were seized by
three armed men who were later confirmed to be members
of the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG). The leader of the alleged
kidnappers was identified as Raden Abu, a former guard at
the Sulu Provincial Jail. News reports linked Abu to Albader
Parad, one of the known leaders of the Abu Sayyaf.
On 31 March 2009, Governor Tan issued Proclamation
No. 1, Series of 2009 (Proclamation 1-09), declaring a state
of emergency in the province of Sulu. It cited the kidnapping
incident as a ground for the said declaration, describing it as a
terrorist act pursuant to the Human Security Act (RA. 9372).
It also invoked Section 465 (b) (1) (vii) of the Local
Government Code of 1991 (R.A. 7160), which bestows on
the Provincial Governor the power to carry out emergency
measures during man-made and natural disasters and
calamities, and Sec. 465 (b) (2) (vi) to call upon the appropriate
national law enforcement agencies to suppress disorder and
lawless violence.
In the same Proclamation, respondent Tan called upon
the PNP and the Civilian Emergency Force (CEF) to set up
checkpoints and chokepoints impose curfew, conduct general
search and seizures including arrests, and other actions
necessary to ensure public safety.

of Patikul, Sulu, filed the present Petition for Certiorari and
Prohibition, claiming that Proclamation 1-09 was issued
with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction, as it threatened fundamental freedoms guaranteed
under Article III of the 1987 Constitution.

Paragraph 2, subparagraph (vi) of the same provision
is equally inapplicable for two reasons. First, the Armed
Forces of the Philippines does not fall under the category of
a "national law enforcement agency," to which the National
Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) and its departments belong.

Ruling: Respondent provincial governor is not endowed
with the power to call upon the armed forces at his own bidding.
In issuing the assailed proclamation, Governor Tan exceeded
h.is authority when he declared a state of emergency and
called upon the Armed Forces, the police, and his own Civilian
Emergency Force. The calling-out powers contemplated under
the Constitution is exclusive to the President. An exercise by
another official, even if he is the local chief executive, is ultra
vires, and may not be justified by the invocation of Section 465of
the Local Government Code, as will be cliscussed subsequently.
Respondent governor characterized the kidnapping of
the three ICRC workers as a terroristic act, and used this
incident to justify the exercise of the powers enumerated under
Proclamation 1-09. He invokes Section 465, in relation to
Section 16, of the Local Government Code, which purportedly
allows the governor to carry out emergency measures and call
upon the appropriate national law enforcement agencies for
assistance. But a closer look at the said proclamation shows
that there is no provision in the Local Government Code nor in
any law on which the broad and unwarranted powers granted
to the Governor may be based.
We find, and so hold, that there is nothing in the Local
Government Code which justifies the acts sanctioned under the
said Proclamation. Not even Section 465 of the said Code, in
relation to Section 16.
Respondents cannot rely on paragraph 1, subparagraph
(vii) of Article 465 above, as the said provision expressly refers
to calamities and disasters, whether man-made or natural. The
governor, as local chief executive of the province, is certainly

Second, there was no evidence or even an allegation
on record that the local police forces were inadequate to
cope with the situation or apprehend the violators. If they
were inadequate, the recourse of the provincial governor
was to ask the assistance of the Secretary of Interior and
Local Government, or such other authorized officials, for the
assistance of national law enforcement agencies.
Pursuant to the national policy to establish one police
force, the organization of private citizen armies is proscribed
under Section 24 of Article XVIII of the Constitution.
Additionally, Section 21 of Article XI states that, "The
preservation of peace and order within the regions shall be
the responsibility of the local police agencies wh.ich shall be
organized, maintained, supervised, and utilized in accordance
with applicable laws. The defense and security of the regions
shall be the responsibility of the National Government."
Taken in conjunction with each other, it becomes clear
that the Constitution does not authorize the organization of
private armed groups similar to the CEF convened by the
respondent Governor. The framers of the Constitution were
themselves wary of armed citizens' groups.
Thus, with the discussions in the Constitutional
Commission as guide, the creation of the Civilian Emergency
Force (CEF) in the present case, is also invalid.
The instant petition is GRANTED. Judgment is rendered
commanding respondents to desist from further proceeclings
m implementing Proclamation No. 1, Series of 2009, and
its Implementing Guidelines. The said proclamation and

been issued in grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or
excess of jurisdiction.

Decided Case

1.
The dry metric ton threshold set by the law ensures
that small scale mining activities will not result in environmental
damage. Gov. Reyes' gross, inexcusable negligence caused undue
injury to the Province of Palawan, as it exposed the province to
various environmental threats resulting from irresponsible mining.

REYES v. PEOPLE
G.R. No. 2327172, September 18, 2019, Leonen, J.
Facts: This Court resolves a Petition for Review on
Certiorari filed by Mario Joel T. Reyes (Reyes), then Governor
of Palawan, assailing the Decision and Resolution of the
Sandiganbayan, which found him guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, or
the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, when he renewed
the small scale mining permit of a mining company despite it
violating the terms and conditions of its previous permit. He
also assails the Sandiganbayan Resolution revoking his bail
due to previous violations of the conditions of bail and for
possibility of flight.

Ruling: Petitioner Governor was tasked with approving
the permits for small scale mining operations within the
province DENR Administrative Order No. 96-40 (1996) and
Sec. 8, Revised IRR of RA 7942 (Philippine Mining Act of 1995).
Subject to Section 8 of the Act and pursuant to the
Local Government Code and other pertinent Jaws, the Local
Government Units (LGUs) shall have the following roles in
mining projects within their respective jurisdictions:
b.
In coordination with the Bureau/Regional
Office(s) and subject to valid and existing mining rights,
to approve applications for small-scale mining, sand and
gravel, quarry, guano, gemstone gathering and gratuitous
permits and for industrial sand and gravel permits not
exceeding five (5) hectares.
This Court proceeded to resolve the main issue of the
proper interpretation of "ore" within the context of the dry
metric ton threshold.
In this case, the Sandiganbayan found that from May 30,
2005 to April 3, 2006, Platinum Group transported a total of

902

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

203,399.135 dry metric tons of nickel ore under Olympic Mines'
SSMP PLW No. 37 and Platinum Group's SSMP PLW No. 39.
This is clearly beyond the 100,000-dry metric ton threshold of
the combined permits, a fact that petitioner does not dispute.
His act of renewing Olympic Mines' Small Scale Mining
Permits, despite a blatant violation of the terms of the permit,
was correctly characterized as gross, inexcusable negligence.
Petitioner, as provincial governor, signs the ore transport
permits of small scale miners. Therefore, it can be presumed
that unlike the Provincial Mining Regulatory Board, petitioner
was aware of the amounts of ore being transported by Olympic
Mines. Had he taken the slightest care, he would have taken
the Provincial Mining Regulatory Board's recommendation
together with the amounts in the Ore Transport Permits and
realized that he should not have renewed Olympic Mines'
Small Scale Mining Permit after all.
Petitioner, as the local chief executive, had the duty
to act within the best interests of his constituents and to
safeguard the environment's natural resources. The dry metric
ton threshold set by the law ensures that small scale mining
activities will not result in environmental damage. Petitioner's
gross inexcusable negligence, thus, caused undue injury to
the Province of Palawan, as it exposed the province to various
environmental threats resulting from irresponsible mining.
There was. thus, no error in the Sandiganbayan's exercise
of its discretion to cancel petitioner's bail.
WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED. Petitioner Reyes
is found GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of violation of
Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019. He is sentenced to an
indeterminate penalty of imprisonment of six (6) years and one
(1) month, as minimum, to eight (8) years, as maximum, with
perpetual disqualification from holding public office.
(vi) Provide efficient and effective
property and supply management in the
province; and protect the funds, credits,

The basis for division of the province of Guimaras into two
(2) provincial districts is the number of inhabitants of the province
concerned and not the number of listed or registered voters.
HERRERA v. COMELEC
318 SCRA 336, November 17, 1999, Purisima, J.
Facts: Petitioners assail a portion of Resolution 2950 of
the COMELEC dividing the province of Guimares into two
(2) provincial districts and apportioning eight (8) elective
Sangguniang Panlalawigan seats therefor. Petitioners aver
that the apportionment of the Province of Guimaras into two
districts is not equitable due to disproportionate representation.
It is claimed that the districting embodied in Resolution 2950
results in the disparity of representation in that, in the first
district, there is a ratio of one board member per 18,739 voters
while in the second district, the ratio is one board member per
14,050 voters.

Held: Petitioners contention is untenable. Under RA
7166 and COMELEC Resolution 2313, the basis for division
of districts shall be the number of inhabitants of the province
concerned and not the number of registered or listed voters as
theorized by the petitioners. Thus the COMELEC did not act
with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the assailed Resolution
because clearly, the basis for the districting is the number of
inhabitants of the Province of Guimaras by municipality based
on the official 1995 Census of Population as certified to by
Tomas Africa, Administrator of the National Statistics Office.

GABRIEL v. PROVINCIAL BOARD OF PAMPANGA
50 Phil. 686, September 17, 1927, Malcolm, J.
Facts: In 1905, the municipal council of Angeles adopted
Ordinance No. 138 relating to the installation of steam
engines. In 1906, another resolution was adopted declaring a
zone consisting of the poblacion within which is prohibited the
installation of steam engines.
In 1925, Gabriel requested authorization from the
municipal council to set up a ricemill pursuant to the 1905
Ordinance, which was approved under Resolution No. 137.
Subsequently, Resolution No. 237 was passed declaring the site
selected by Gabriel as outside the radius or square designated
by the 1906 resolution. Certain citizens however protested.

Book III- Locnl Government Units
Title Four - The Province

907

Both resolutions were sent to the provincial board for approval.
Said board disapproved the resolutions of the municipality of
Angeles.
Held: The Municipal Law, as revised, grants to the
municipal council certain legislative powers of discretionary
character among which is authority to regulate the
establishment of steam boilers within the municipality. But
when municipal action was taken, it then became incumbent on
the provincial board to pass on the legality ofthe proceedings. But
the only ground upon which a provincial board may declare any
municipal resolution, order or ordinance invalid is when such
resolution, ordinance or order is beyond the powers conferred
upon the council. Absolutely no other ground is recognized by
the law. A strictly legal question is before the provincial board
on its consideration of any municipal resolution, ordinance or
order. The provincial disapproval of any resolution, ordinance
or order must be premised specifically upon the fact that such
resolution, ordinances or order is outside the scope of the legal
power conferred by law.
The ordinance of Angeles in 1905 and its resolution in
1906 were general in nature, and have never been modified or
set aside. They should, therefore, receive equable application.
The two (2) resolutions of Angeles in 1925 merely gave
specific effect to the 1905 ordinance and the 1906 resolution.
The disapproval resolution of the provincial board was not
predicated on any legal consideration. It was grounded on
a mistaken finding of fact, diametrically opposed to the
municipal viewpoint and entirely inconsistent with the true
state of affairs, which disclosed that the ricemill of Gabriel was
outside of the restricted district. The provincial board's act was
ultra [w}ires.

The grant and release of the hospitalization and health
care insurance benefits given to petitioner's officials and employees

Sangguniang Panlalawigan. Since petitioner's grant and release
of the questioned disbursement without the President's approval
did not violate the President's directive in A.O. No. 103, which
applies only to the Executive Branch, the COA then gravely abused
its discretion in applying A.O. No. 103 to disallow the premium
payment for the hospitalization and health care insurance benefits
of petitioner's officials and employees.
PROVINCE OF NEGROS OCCIDENTAL v.
COMMISSIONERS
631 SCRA 431, September 28, 2010, Carpio, J.
Facts: On 21 December 1994, the Sangguniang
Panlalawigan of Negros Occidental passed Resolution No.
720-A allocating P4,000,000 of its retained earnings for the
hospitalization and health care insurance benefits of 1,949

Philam Care Health System Incorporated (Philam Care).
Petitioner Province of Negros Occidental, represented
by its then Governor Rafael L. Coscolluela, and Philam Care
entered into a Group Health Care Agreement involving a total
payment of P3,760,000 representing the insurance premiums
of its officials and employees. The total premium amount was
paid on 26 January 1996.

910

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

The Provincial Auditor issued Notice of Suspension
No. 97-001-101 suspending the premium payment because
of lack of approval from the Office of the President (OP) as
provided under Administrative Order No. 103 (AO 103) dated
14 January 1994. The Provincial Auditor explained that the
premium payment for health care benefits violated Republic
Act No. 6758 (RA 6758), otherwise known as the Salary
Standardization Law.

Ruling: We disagree with the COA. From a close reading
of the provisions of AO 103, petitioner did not violate the rule
of prior approval from the President since Section 2 states that
the prohibition applies only to "government offices/agencies,
including government-owned and/or controlled corporations,
as well as their respective governing boards." Nowhere is it
indicated in Section 2 that the prohibition also applies to LG Us.
The requirement then of prior approval from the President
under AO 103 is applicable only to departments, bureaus,
offices and government-owned and controlled corporations
under the Executive branch. In other words, AO 103 must be
observed by government offices under the President's control
as mandated by Section 17, Article VII of the Constitution.
Being an LGU, petitioner is merely under the President's
general supervision pursuant to Section 4, Article X of the
Constitution.
Since LGUs are subject only to the power of general
supervision of the President, the President's authority is
limited to seeing to it that rules are followed and laws are
faithfully executed. The President may only point out that
rules have not been followed but the President cannot lay
down the rules, neither does he have the discretion to modify or
replace the rules. Thus, the grant of additional compensation
like hospitalization and health care insurance benefits in the
present case does not need the approval of the President to be
valid.
Thus, consistent with the state policy of local autonomy
as guaranteed by the 1987 Constitution, under Section 25,
Article II and Section 2, Article X, and the Local Government
Code of 1991, (Sec. 468 (a) (1) VII) we declare that the grant
and release of the hospitalization and health care insurance
benefits given to petitioner's officials and employees were

Boo k III Local Government Units

911

validly enacted through an ordinance passed by petitioner's

Sangguniang Panlalawigan.
In sum, since petitioner's grant and release of the
questioned disbursement without the President's approval did
not violate the President's directive in AO 103, the COA then
gravely abused its discretion in applying AO 103 to disallow
the premium payment for the hospitalization and health care
insurance benefits of petitioner's officials and employees.
We GRANT the petition. We REVERSE AND SET ASIDE

Municipal Treasurer who is reassigned to the Provincial
Treasurer's Office shall continue to receive her RATA.

DEPARTMENT OF BUDGET AND
MANAGEMENTv.LEONES
616 SCRA 72, March 18, 2010, Carpio, J.

(1) Advise the governor or mayor, as the
case may be, the sanggunian, and other local
government and national officials concerned
regarding disposition of local government
funds and on such other matters relative to
public finance;

Facts: Before 1996, respondent Olivia D. Leones
(respondent) was the Municipal Treasurer of Bacnotan, La
Union. In December 1996, respondent was reassigned to
the Office of the Provincial Treasurer, La Union, pending
resolution of administrative cases filed against her. As
Municipal Treasurer, respondent received, on top of her salary,
representation and transportation allowance (RATAJ. The
Municipality of Bacnotan stopped paying RATA to respondent
upon her reassignment to the Provincial Government.

(2) Take custody and exercise proper
management of the funds of the local
government unit concerned;

After unsuccessfully obtaining administrative relief,
respondent filed a mandamus suit with the RTC of San
Fernando City, La Union against petitioner DBM and then

920

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

mayor of Bacnotan, Ma. Minda Fontanilla, to compel payment
ofRATA.

Ruling: Paragraphs (d) and (e) of Section 470 of Republic
Act No. 7160 (RA 7160), the Local Government Code of 1991,
provide the functions of ''The treasurer":
Thus, irrespective of the level of the local government
unit involved, no distinction exists in the functions of local
treasurers except in the technical supervision by the provincial
treasurer over subordinate treasury offices. Logically, the
employees in all local treasuries perform comparable functions
within the framework of Section 70 (d) and (e). Hence, the
DBM's casual claim that "the facts at hand do not reflect that
the functions performed by respondent during the period of her
reassignment were comparable to those she performed prior to
her reassignment" finds no basis in fact or in law. In terms of
performing comparative functions, the reassignment here is no
different from that of a RA TA-entitled officer of the Department
of Science and Technology who, as Chief of the Finance and
Management Division, was reassigned to the Directors' Office,
Finance and Management Service Office. We considered the
officer entitled to RATA despite the reassignment for lack of
basis for the non-payment, Padolina v. Fernandez, 396 Phil.
615 (2000).
Before disposing of this matter, we highlight the element
of inequity undergirding the DBM's case. By insisting that, as
requisite for her receipt of RATA, respondent must discharge
her office as Bacnotan's treasurer while on reassignment at
the La Union treasurer's office, the DBM effectively punishes
respondent for acceding to her reassignment. Surely, the law
could not have intended to place local government officials like
respondent in the difficult position of having to choose between
disobeying a reassignment order or keeping an allowance. As
we observed in a parallel case:
[O]n petitioner's contention that RATA should be
allowed only if private respondent is performing the
duties of her former office, the CSC correctly explained
that private respondent was "reassigned to another office
and thus her inability to perform the functions of her
position as Division Chief is beyond her control and not of
her own volition. x xx"
We DENY the petition.

Cesa, the city treasurer, cannot rely on good faith based
on the act of a subordinate where the documents that would support
the subordinate's action (Bacasmas countersignature) were not
even in his (Cesa's) possession for examination. Her conviction of
violation of Section 3 (e) of R.A. 3019 is affirmed.

JACA v. PEOPLE
689 SCRA 270, January 28, 2013, Brion, J.
Facts: Before the Court are the petitions for review on
certiorari assailing the December 16, 2004 decision and the
February 1, 2005 resolution of the Sandiganbayan in Criminal
Case No. 24699, finding Alan C. Gaviola, Edna J. Jaca,
Eustaquio B. Cesa (collectively, petitioners) and Benilda N.
Bacasmas guilty of violating Section 3(e) of Republic Act (RA)
No. 3019.
The petitioners occupied appointive positions in the
different divisions of the Cebu City government at the time
material to the controversy: Gaviola was the City Administrator;
Cesa was the City Treasurer; Bacasmas was the Chief Cashier
of the Cash Division, which is under the Office of the City
Treasurer, and Jaca was the City Accountant.
On March 4, 1998, City Auditor Rodolfo Ariesga created
a team of auditors. The audit team's cash examination covered
the period from September 20, 1995 to March 5, 1998. The
team conducted an examination of the cash and other accounts
in Badana's custody. The audit team reported that Badana
incurred a cash shortage of P18,527,137.19. Based on the
procedure in the processing of cash advances, the audit team
found out that the failure of the petitioners to observe the
provisions of Presidential Decree (PD) No. 1445, RA No. 7160
and the rules and regulations governing the grant, utilization
and liquidation of cash advances under Commission on Audit
(COA) Circular Nos. 90-331, 92-382 and 97-002"facilitated,
promoted, if not encouraged, the commission of malversation
of public funds."
On March 13, 1998, Cebu City Mayor Alvin Garcia filed
with the Office of the Ombudsman-Visayas (Ombudsman) a
complaint against Badena for malversation of public funds and
for violation of RA Nos. 3019 and 6713. The complaint resulted
in administrative and criminal investigations against Cesa,
Jaca and Gaviola.

922

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Ruling: Under Section 470 of RA No. 7160, the City
Treasurer is tasked with, inter alia, the following duties: (1) to
take custody of and exercise proper management of the funds
of the local government unit concerned; and (2) to take charge
of the disbursement of all local government funds and such
other funds the custody of which may be entrusted to him by
law or other competent authority. It is from the viewpoint of
Cesa's duties as a City Treasurer that Cesa's good faith should
be measured, not simply from the fact that he acted because
a subordinate from his office is the one asking for a cash
advance. By certifying that the cash advances were "necessary
and lawful and incurred under his direct supervision," Cesa
cannot escape the obligation to determine whether Badana
complied with Section 89 of PD No. 1445, although the same
requirement would have to be ultimately determined by the
City Accountant. Section 89 of PD No. 1445 reads:
Sec. 89. Limitations on cash advance. - No cash
advance shall be given unless for a legally authorized
specific purpose. A cash advance shall be reported on
and liquidated as soon as the purpose for which it was
given has been served. No additional cash advance shall
be allowed to any official or employee unless the previous
cash advance given to him is settled or a proper accounting
thereof is made.
The same requirement is reiterated in RA No. 7160:
Section 339. Cash Advances.
No cash advance
shall be granted to any local official or employee, elective
or appointive, unless made in accordance with the
rules and regulations as the Commission on Audit may
prescribe. [italics supplied]
Cesa's claim that he precisely required Bacasmas to affix
her initials first on Box A before he actually signed it cannot
exonerate him because Bacasmas herself admitted that the
"practice" then was simply to approve the written request
of the paymaster without requiring the presentation of the
supporting documents from the requesting paymaster.
As the immediate superior of Badana and who affixes her
initials before accused Cesa signs Box A, Bacasmas' testimony
clearly establishes a "practice" in the Office of the Cash Division
of simply relying on the request of the paymaster without

Book III - Local Government Units
Title Five Appointive Local Officials Common to All
Municipalities, Cities, and Provinces

923

actually requiring the submission of the necessary documents
in support of the request. Contrary to Cesa's claims, he was
not trivially signing Box A of the disbursement voucher as
a mere requesting party; he has performed a vital role in its
processing and the consequent disbursement of public funds.
The instruction at the back of the voucher itself states that:
1.

XX X

6.
Box A shall be signed by the responsible officer
having direct supervision and knowledge of the facts of
the transaction.
In view of the clear duty of the City Treasurer to exercise
proper management of the funds of the local government, Cesa's
insistence that he merely followed the established "procedures
and systems"which can only refer to the "practice" observed
in the Office of the Cash Division-all the more negated his
defense of good faith. He cannot rely on good faith based on the
act of a subordinate where the documents that would support
the subordinate's action (Bacasmas countersignature) were not
even in his (Cesa's) possession for examination.
Similarly, even ordinary diligence in the performance of
his duties as City Treasurer should have prompted Cesa to
determine if the cash advance requested is "necessary' not only
as to its purpose but also as to its amount to ensure that local
funds are properly spent up to the last centavo.
Decision of conviction is affirmed.
3.
Revenue Regulation No. 2-98 identifes the Provincial
Treasurer in provinces, the City Treasurer in cities, the Municipal
Treasurer in municipalities, Barangay Treasurer in barangays,
Treasurers of government-owned or -controlled corporations
(GOCCs), and the Chief Accountant or any person holding similar
position and performing similar function in national government
offices, as persons required to deduct and withhold the appropriate
taxes on the income payments made by the government. The
Governor, City Mayor, Municipal Mayor, Barangay Captain and
Heads of Office in government agencies, government-owned or
controlled corporations and other governments cannot be required
to withhold and remit withholding taxes.

CONFEDERATION FOR UNITY, RECOGNITION AND
ADVANCEMENT OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES
(COURAGE) v. COMMISSIONER,
BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE
G.R. No. 213446, July 3, 2018, Caguioa, d.
Facts: On August 6, 2014, petitioners Confederation
for Unity, Recognition and Advancement of Government
Employees (COURAGE), et al., filed a Petition for Prohibition
and Mandamus, imputing grave abuse of discretion on the
part of respondent BIR Commissioner in issuing Revenue
Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 23-2014. According to petitioners,
RMO No. 23-2014 classified as taxable compensation, the
following allowances, bonuses, compensation for services
granted to government employees, which they alleged to
be considered by law as non-taxable fringe and de minimis
benefits.

Ruling: Section VI of RMO No. 23-2014 reads:
VI. PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR WITHHOLDING
The following officials are duty bound to deduct, withhold
and remit taxes:
a)
For Office of the Provincial Governmentprovince
the Chief Accountant, Provincial Treasurer
and the Governor;
b)
For Office of the City Government-cities
the
Chief Accountant, City Treasurer and the City Mayor;
c)
For Office of the Municipal Governmentmunicipalities
the Chief Accountant, Municipal
Treasurer and the Mayor;
d)
Office of the Barangay
and Barangay Captain;

Barangay Treasurer

e)
For NGAs, GOCCs and other Government
Offices, the Chief Accountant and the Head of Office
or the Official holding the highest position (such as the
President, Chief Executive Officer, Governor, General
Manager).
To recall, the Government of the Philippines, or any
political subdivision or agency thereof, or any GOCC, as an

925

employer, is constituted by law as the withholding agent,
mandated to deduct, withhold and remit the correct amount of
taxes on the compensation income received by its employees.
In relation thereto, Section 82 of the National Internal
Revenue Code (NIRC) of 1997, as amended, states that the
return of the amount deducted and withheld upon any wage
paid to government employees shall be made by the officer or
employee having control of the payments or by any officer or
employee duly designated for such purpose. Consequently,
Revenue Regulation (RR) No. 2-98 identifies the Provincial
Treasurer in prouinces, the City Treasurer in cities, the
Municipal Treasurer in municipalities, Barangay Treasurer
in barangays, Treasurers of government-owned or -controlled
corporations (GOCCs), and the Chief Accountant or any person
holding similar position and performing similar function in
national gouernment offices, as persons required to deduct and
withhold the appropriate taxes on the income payments made
by the government.
However, nowhere in the NIRC of 1997, as amended, or
in RR No. 2-98, as amended, would one find the Provincial
Governor, Mayor, Barangay Captain and the Head of
Government Office or the "Official holding the highest position
(such as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Governor,
General Manager)" in an Agency or GOCC as one of the officials
required to deduct, withhold and remit the correct amount
of withholding taxes. The BIR Commissioner, in imposing
upon these officials the obligation not found in law nor in the
implementing rules, did not merely issue an interpretative rule
designed to provide guidelines to the law which it is in charge
of enforcing; but instead, supplanted details thereon-a power
duly vested by law only to respondent Secretary of Finance
under Section 244 of the NIRC of 1997, as amended.
Moreover, respondents' allusion to previous issuances
of the Secretary of Finance designating the Governor, etc. as
officers required to deduct and withhold, is bereft of legal basis.
Since the 1977 NIRC and Executive Order No. 651, which
allegedly breathed life to these issuances, have already been
repealed with the enactment of the NIRC of 1997, as amended,
and RR No. 2-98, these previous issuances of the Secretary of
Finance have ceased to have the force and effect of law.

CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petitions and
Petitions-in Interventions are PARTIALLY GRANTED.
Section VI of Revenue Memorandum Order No. 23-2014 is
DECLAR ED null and void insofar as it names the Governor,
City Mayor, Municipal Mayor, Barangay Captain, and
Heads of Office in government agencies, government-owned
or -controlled corporations, and other government offices, as
persons required to withhold and remit withholding taxes.
Sections III, IV, and VII of RMO No. 23-2014 are
DECLARED valid inasmuch as they merely mirror the
provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as
amended. However, the Court cannot rule on petitioners' claims
of exemption from withholding tax on compensation income
because these involve issues that are essentially factual or
evidentiary in nature, which must be raised in the appropriate
administrative and/or judicial proceeding.
The Court's Decision upholding the validity of Sections III
and IV of the assailed RMO is to be applied only prospectively.

'Treasurer Estalilla's responsibility in the disbursement

ESTALILLA v. COMMISSION ON AUDIT
G.R. No. 217448, September 18, 2019, Bersamin, C.J.
Facts: This case emanated from the Contract for the
Hauling of Garbage entered into by and between the then
Municipality of Cabuyao, Laguna and J.O. Batallones Trading
and Construction on March 18, 2003 and May 1, 2005. The
Sangguniang Bayan of Cabuyao had approved both contracts
through Pambayang Kapasyahan Bilang 048-2004 and
Pambayang Kapasyahan Bilang 067-2005.
After audit, the Audit Team Leader (ATL) of the
Municipality of Cabuyao issued Audit Observation Memoranda
(AOM) dated February 16, 2003 and September 13, 2005 upon
discovering that payments totaling P35,591,200.00 for the
2004 garbage collections had been charged against the 2005
appropriation.

Regional Cluster Director Eden D. Tingson Rafanan later
on issued Notice of Disallowance (ND) No. 2008-0430-101(05)
dated November 18, 2008 in the amount of Pl8,676,200.00
and ND No. 2008-044-101(04) dated November 25, 2008 in the
amount of P16,915,000.00 on the ground that the expenditures
had been improperly charged against the 2005 annual budget
contrary to Section 305(a), Section 305(1) and Section 350 of
Republic Act No. 7160 (The Local Government Code) in relation
to Section 85 of Presidential Decree No. 1445 (Auditing Code

of the Philippines).
Ruling: Section 351 of the Local Government Code
provides that expenditures of funds or use of property in
violation of law shall be the personal liability of the official
or employee responsible therefor. In that regard, in Section
16 of Circular No. 2009-006, the COA has listed the factors
to be considered in determining the liability of public officers
for disallowances, namely: (1) the nature of the disallowance/
charge; (2) the duties and responsibilities of Officers/employees
concerned; (3) the extent of their participation in the disallowed/
charged transaction; and (4) the amount of damage suffered by
or loss to the Government.
In Circular No. 2006-002, the COA has further defined
the responsibilities of the public officers involved in the
disbursement of local government funds.
The foregoing rendered clear that Estalilla's responsibility
in the disbursement process should only be limited because all
that she had done was to certify whether or not funds were
available for the purpose of the expenditure. This limitation
is based on Section 344 of Republic Act No. 7160 (The Local
Government Code), which relevantly states:
Section 344. Certification, and Approval of,
Vouchers. N o money shall be disbursed unless the local
budget officer certifies to the ex.istence of appropriation
that has been legally made for the purpose, the local
accountant has obligated said appropriation, and the
local treasurer certifies to the availability of funds
for the purpose. xxx
There is no showing that Estalilla issued a false
certification which would have invalidated the disbursement.
As such, the COA gravely abused its discretion in holding

928

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

her personally liable under NDs without finding that she had
certified falsely to the availability of funds.
The Court GRANTS the petition for certiorari; SETS
ASIDE the decision of the Commission on Audit and
MODIFIES the Notice of Disallowance Nos. 2008-0430-101(05)
and 2008-044-101(04), the Notices of Finality of Decision and

1.
Respondent possesses the minimum qualifications for the
position of City Government Department Head III. Moreover, his
promotion from a Salary Grade 18 to a Salary Grade 27 position
was a "very meritorious case" since he has gone through a deep
selection process. Respondent Herminia Dela Cruz's appointment
as City Assessor of Muntinlupa with the item of City Government
Department Head III, therefore, is valid.

Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz) as City Assessor of the City Government
of Muntinlupa in a permanent capacity on December 28,
2006. The City Assessor is given the item of City Government
Department Head III.
In Resolution No. 06-361, majority of the members of

to take final action on its appointments, the appointment of
Dela Cruz was considered attested to by the Civil Service
Commission.
Angel A. Abad (Abad), Local Assessment Operations
Officer V in the Office of the City Assessor, wrote the Civil
Service Commission and requested the disapproval of Dela
Cruz's appointment as City Government Department Head
III. Abad alleged that the position of City Government
Department Head III corresponded to Salary Grade 27, nine
(9) salary grades higher than Dela Cruz's former position as
Local Assessment Operations Officer III with Salary Grade

'THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

18. According to Abad, Dela Cruz's appointment violated Item
15 of Civil Service Commission Memorandum Circular No. 3,
Series of 2001, which prohibits the promotion of an employee
to a position more than three (3) salary grades above his or her
former position:
Ruling: For local government units, the appointment
of an assessor is mandatory. In the City Government of
Muntinlupa, the City Assessor is given the item of City
Government Department Head Ill under the City's 2007
Personnel Schedule. As provided in Section 472(a) of the Loca l
Government Code of 1991, the assessor must possess certain
qualifications.
The Civil Service Commission-National Capital Region
and the Civil Service Commission agree that respondent
possesses the minimum qualifications under the law for the
position of City Government Department Head III:

Book III Local Government Units
Title Five Appointive Local Officials Common to AI
Municipalities, Cities, and Provinces

SEC. 473. Assistant Assessor.
(a) No person
shall be appointed assistant assessor unless he
is a citizen of the Philippines, a resident of the
local government unit concerned, of good moral
character, a holder of a college degree preferably
in civil or mechanical engineering, comm erce or
any related course from a recognized college or
university, and a first grade civil service eligible or
its equivalent. He must have acquired experience
in assessment or in any related field for at least
three (3) years in the case of the provincial or city
assistant assessor, and one (1) year in the case of
the municipal assistant assessor.
The appointment of an assistant assessor
is optional for provincial, city and municipal
governments.

A comparative evaluation of the qualifications of Dela
Cruz as indicated in his Personal Data Sheet (PDS) vis-a-vis
the qualification standards for the position of City Assessor
III shows that he meets all the requirements for appointment
thereto. Likewise, he satisfies the requirements prescribed
by RA 7160. Hence, Dela Cruz qualifies for the issuance of
permanent appointment as City Assessor III.

(b) The assistant assessor shall assist the
assessor and perform such other duties as the latter
may assign to him. He shall have the authority
to administer oaths on all declarations of real
property for purposes of assessment.

Still, the next-in-rank rule is a rule of preference on who
to consider for promotion. The rule does not give employees
next in rank a vested right to the position next higher to
theirs should that position become vacant. Appointment is a
discretionary power of the appointing authority. So long as
the appointee possesses the qualifications required by law, the
appointment is valid.

SEC. 474. Qualifications, Powers and Duties•
(a) No person shall be appointed accountant unless
he is a citizen of the Philippines, a resident of the
local government unit concerned, of good moral
character, and a certified public accountant. He
must have acquired experience in the treasury or
accounting service for at least five (6) years in the
case of the provincial or city accountant, and three
(3) years in the case of the municipal accountant.
The appointment of an accountant is mandatory
for the provincial, city and municipal governments.

Respondent possesses the minimum qualifications for the
position of City Government Department Head III. Moreover,
his promotion from a Salary Grade 18 to a Salary Grade
27 position was a "very meritorious case" since he has gone
through a deep selection process. Respondent Herminia Dela
Cruz's appointment as City Government Department Head III,
therefore, is valid.
The Petition for Review on Certiorari is DENIED.

A.

Decided Case

I.
Aside from Jaca (the City Accountant's) admission that
she knowingly affixed her signature in Box B of the disbursement
voucher contrary to what it certifies, i.e., all previous cash advances
had been liquidated and accounted for. the amount requested was
consistently way above the total amount covered by the supporting
payrolls, thereby allowing Badana to have accumulated excess funds
in her hand. Her conviction of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. No.
3019 is affirmed.
JACA v. PEOPLE
689 SCRA 270, January 28, 2013, Brion, J.
Facts: (Supra)
Ruling: RA No. 7160 charges the city accountant with
both the accounting and internal audit services of the local
government unit and, among others, to (1) install and maintain
an internal audit system in the local government unit; (2)
review supporting documents before the preparation of
vouchers to determine the completeness of the requirements;
(3) prepare statements of cash advances, liquidation, salaries,
allowances, reimbursements and remittances pertaining to
the local government unit; (4) prepare statements of journal
vouchers and liquidation of the same and other adjustments
related thereto; (5) post individual disbursements to the
subsidiary ledger and index cards; and (6) maintain individual
ledgers for officials and employees of the local government unit
pertaining to payrolls and deductions.
As the City Accountant, Jaca is presumed conversant
with the pertinent COA rules and regulations in granting cash
advances, i.e., COA Circular No. 90-331, COA Circular No. 92382 and COA Circular No. 97-002, but which were consistently
not observed by the petitioners.
1.
No additional cash advance shall be allowed to
any official or employee unless the previous cash advance
given him is first settled or a proper accounting thereof is
made.
.'

936

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

2.
The cash advance shall be equal to the net
amount of the payroll for a pay period.

3.

The cash advance shall be supported by the
following documents:
- Payroll or list of payees with their net payments
4.
The accountable officer shall liquidate his cash
advance as follows: salaries, wages, etc. - within five days
after each 15 days/end of the month pay period.
The Court is not persuaded by Jaca's argument that she
was merely avoiding any delay in the payment of salaries of
local government employees when she consequently failed
to observe the COA rules on the period of liquidation of cash
advances. The Sandiganbayan correctly observed that as
the City Accountant, foremost of her duties is to ensure that
the local funds out of which the salaries of local government
employees would be paid are properly accounted for. As
Cesa implicitly argued, the creation of the Office of the City
Accountant serves an important function of pre-audit in the
chain of processing cash advances of individual paymasters.
A pre-audit is an examination of financial transactions
before their consumption or payment; a pre-audit seeks to
determine, among others, that the claim is duly supported
by authentic underlying pieces of evidence. If the setup then
prevailing in the Cebu City government directly conflicts
with the COA regulations, Jaca should have, at the very
least, informed the City Mayor of the risk in the process of
disbursement of local funds or at least she should have set up
an internal audit system-as was her duty[-)to check against
possible malversation offunds by the paymaster.
In the present case, aside from daca's admission that she
knowingly affixed her signature in Box B of the disbursement
voucher contrary to what it certifies, i.e., all previous cash
advances had been liquidated and accounted for, the amount
requested was consistently way above the total amount covered
by the supporting payrolls, thereby allowing Badana to have
accumulated excess funds in her hands.
Conviction affirmed.

Decided Case

1.
While the Local Autonomy Act did not expressly vest on
provincial governments the power to abolish the office of a provincial
engineer, absent any contrary provision, that authority should
be deemed embraced by implication from the power to create it.
Abolition of an office is not per se objectionable, but this rule carries
a caveat that the act is done in good faith.

JAVIER v. CA
232 SCRA 673, June 1, 1994, Vitug, J.
Facts: On April 19, 1974, Provincial Engineer Maximiano
Sentina and forty (40) officials and employees of the Office of
the Provincial Engineer filed a petition for mandamus and
damages against the entire Provincial Board of Antique. The
petition was anchored on the hypothesis that the abolition of
the Office of the Provincial Engineer was a circumvention of
the constitutional mandate on security of tenure and intended
only to weed out provincial officials and employees who opposed
the Provincial Board's candidacy in the 08th November 1971
election.
Respondents, denying petitioners' ascriptions, insisted
that the abolition of the Office of the Provincial Engineer was
motivated instead by a provision of Presidential Decree No. 17,
which lowered the internal revenue allotment to the road and
bridge fund of the province from 50% to 17.5% thereby leaving
an inadequate allotment for materials, salaries and operating
expenses of the Office of the Provincial Engineer. Respondents
averred that the power of the Provincial Board to create an
office carried with it the power to abolish it.

Held: Section 18 of Republic Act No. 5185 (Local
Autonomy Act), then still in force, empowered provincial
governments to create, among other positions, the office of
a provincial engineer. While the law did not expressly vest
on provincial governments the power to abolish that office,
absent, however, any contrary provision, that authority should
be deemed embraced by implication from the power to create it.
Section 23 of the Act, in fact expressed that an "implied power

942

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

of the province xx x (should) be liberally construed in its favor"
and "(a)ny fair and reasonable doubt as to the existence of the
power should be interpreted in favor of local government and it
should be presumed to exist."
We must rule then that the power of the province of
Antique to abolish the office in question did exist at the time.
The real debatable issue focuses on the real reasons behind the
questioned action of the provincial board. An abolition of office
is not per se objectionable but this rule carries a caveat that the
act is done in good faith.
We see a situation where the abolition of the office
could have well been justified except for the convexity of
circumstances attendant to the decision process taken by the
board. We are not prepared, however, to conclude a clear case
of bad faith on the part of respondents.
In lieu of reinstatement, the Provincial Government
of Antique is ordered to pay the employees back salaries
equivalent to five (5) years.
Article Eight. The Health Officer

(a) No person shall be appointed health officer

A.

Decided Case

1.
The local government code, the provision of which he may
be assumed to know, provides that a government health officer has
the duty, among others, to be in the frontline of the delivery of health
services, particularly during and in the aftermath of man-made and
natural disasters and calamities. Here, petitioner abandoned his
position when it needed him.

ESTAMPA, JR. v. CITY GOVERNMENT OF DAVAO
621 SCRA 774, June 21, 2010, Abad, J.
Facts: On February 1, 2001, the City Government of
Davao appointed petitioner Dr. Edilberto Estampa, Jr. as
Medical Officer VI at its City Health Office. The position
made him head of a Task Force Unit assigned to deal with

Book III
Local Government Units
Title Five Appointive Local Officials Common to All
Municipalities, Cities, and Provinces

945

any untoward event taking place in the city and Disaster
Coordinator for the Davao City Health Office under the Davao
City Disaster Coordinating Council.
On March 4, 2003, at around 6 p.m., a powerful bomb
exploded at the passengers' terminal of the Davao International
Airport, killing 22 persons and injuring 113others. Dr. Estampa
had just arrived home at that time and was taking care of his
one-year-old daughter. He learned of the bombing incident
between 7 to 8 p.m. His wife arrived at 9 p.m. from her work at
the Davao Medical Center where most of the bombing victims
were brought for treatment. She prevailed on Dr. Estampa to
stay home and he did.
On November 12, 2004, the City Legal Officer found
Dr. Estampa guilty of "grave" neglect of duty and recommended
his dismissal. On February 8, 2005, the city mayor approved
the recommendation and dismissed Dr. Estampa.

Ruling: Dr. Estampa claims that the city failed to show
that he had an obligation to respond to the Davao City bombing
and that no one advised him of his duties and responsibilities
as city health office's Coordinator to the Disaster Coordinating
Council. But Dr. Estampa cannot claim ignorance of his duties.
The local government code, the provision of which he may be
assumed to know, provides that a government health officer
has the duty, among others, to be in the frontline of the delivery
of health services, particularly during and in the aftermath
of man-made and natural disasters and calamities, Sec. 478
(b) (5), LGC. [ ]Furthermore, as Medical Officer VI, one of his
specified duties was "to act as head of a task force unit for any
untoward events in his area of responsibility." It was precisely
because of his position as Medical Officer VI that he had been
designated Disaster Coordinator for his office.
When Dr. Estampa accepted his post and swore to
perform his duties, he entered into a covenant with the city to
act with dedication, speed, and courage in the face of disasters
like the bombing of populated places in the city. As the CA
pointed out, the bombing incident on March 4, 2003 caused so
many deaths and injuries that the victims had to be farmed out
among several hospitals in the city. Plainly, the City needed
public health officers to come to the rescue of the victims in
whatever way their sufferings or those of their families could

946

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

be assuaged. As disaster coordinator, the city needed Dr.
Estampa to organize and coordinate all efforts to meet the
emergency. Yet, although he knew of the bombing, he chose to
stay at home.
In his letter-explanation, Dr. Estampa justified his
absence from the emergency rooms of the hospitals to attend
to the bombing victims with the claim that he needed to attend
to his family first. Initially, he could not leave his one-yearold daughter because they had no house help. When his wife
arrived from work shortly, he also could not leave because she
was six months pregnant. Further, a bomb was found some
meters from their apartment a few weeks earlier. Dr. Estampa
said in his letter that he was unable from the beginning to give
full commitment to his job since he gave priority to his family.
He simply was not the right person for the job of disaster
coordinator.
Dr. Estampa's defense is not acceptable. A person's duty to
his family is not incompatible with his job-related commitment
to come to the rescue of victims of disasters. Disasters do not
strike every day. Besides, knowing that his job as senior medical
health officer entailed the commitment to make a measure of
personal sacrifice, he had the choice to resign from it when he
realized that he did not have the will and the heart to respond.
Assuming that he had a one-year-old daughter in the
house, he could have taken her to relatives temporarily while
his wife was still on her way from work. But he did not. And
when his wife arrived shortly at 9 p.m., he still did not leave
under the pretext that his wife was six months pregnant. Yet,
he had in fact permitted her to work away from home up to
the evening. What marked his gross irresponsibility was that
he did not even care to call up his superior or associates to
inform them of his inability to respond to the emergency. As
a result, the city health office failed to provide the needed
coordination of all efforts intended to cope with the disaster.
Who knows? Better coordination and dispatch of victims to the
right emergency rooms could have saved more lives.
The Court finds no excuse for reinstating Dr. Estampa to
the position he abandoned when it needed him.
The Court DISMISSES the petition.

Decided Cases

I.
While the Court views the City Administrator Gaviola's
failure to inquire further before affixing his signature despite the
absence of the "particulars of payment" in the disbursement vouchers
as negligence on his part, to additionally affix his signature despite
the lack of supporting documents only shows a gross and inexcusable
disregard of the consequences of his act as approving authority. His
conviction of violation of Section 3(e) of R.A. 3019 is affirmed.

JACA v. PEOPLE
689 SCRA 270, January 28, 2013, Brion, J.
Facts: (Supra)
Ruling: In his defense, City Administrator Gaviola
invokes our ruling in Arias v. Sandiganbayan, 259 Phil. 794
(I989) and argues that he signed Box C of the disbursement
vouchers (i) only after his co-accused had previously affixed
their signatures and (ii) only if they were complete with
supporting documents.
In the seminal case of Arias v. Sandiganbayan involving
the prosecution and conviction of a public official for violation
of RA No. 3019, the Court ruled:
"We would be setting a bad precedent if a head of
office plagued by all too common problems-dishonest or
negligent subordinates, overwork, multiple assignments
or positions, or plain incompetence-is suddenly swept

Book III Local Government Units
Title Five - Appointive Local Officials Common to All
Municipalities, Cities, and Provinces

951

into a conspiracy conviction simply because he did not
personally examine every single detail, painstakingly
trace every step from inception, and investigate the
motives of every person involved in a transaction before
affixing his signature as the final approving authority.
We can, in retrospect, argue that Arias should have
probed records, inspected documents, received procedures, and
questioned persons. It is doubtful if any auditor for a fairly
sized office could personally do all these things in all vouchers
presented for his signature. The Court would be asking for the
impossible. All heads of offices have to rely to a reasonable
extent on their subordinates and on the good faith of those who
prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into negotiations. xxx
There has to be some added reason why he should examine
each voucher in such detail. Any executive head of even small
government agencies or commissions can attest to the volume of
papers that must be signed. There are hundreds of documents,
letters, memoranda, vouchers, and supporting papers that
routinely pass through his hands. The number in bigger offices
or departments is even more appalling.
There should be other grounds than the mere signature
or approval appearing on a voucher to sustain a conspiracy
charge and conviction."
The Court has since applied the Arias ruling to determine
not only criminal, civil and administrative liability, but even
the existence of probable cause to file an information in the
context of an allegation of conspiracy.
The Arias ruling squarely applies where, in the
performance of his official duties, the head of an office is
being held to answer for his act of relying on the acts of his
subordinate. In its Memorandum, the prosecution submitted
that the petitioners were the heads of the three "independent"
offices at the time material to the controversy, i.e., the Office of
the City Treasurer, the Office of the City Accountant and the
Office of the City Administrator. On this point alone, Gaviola's
reliance on Arias already stands on shaky grounds.
The signatures of the other petitioners, however, are only
part of the picture. Gaviola's reliance on these alone does not
establish good faith if the bare signatures on the voucher and

952

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the written request from the paymaster are all that he has
with him when he affixed his signature on Box C.
Amidst conflicting assertions, the Sandiganbayan gave
credence to the prosecution's evidence that the disbursement
vouchers did not have the required supporting documents when
Gaviola affixed his signature. Whi le the vouchers themselves
indicate that it had gone through the Internal Control Office,
allegedly for a determination of the completeness of the
supporting documents before Peiia finally turned it over to
Ga viola, the Sandiganbayan gave emphasis on Gaviola's failure
to present evidence that he indeed requested the submission of
the supposed attachments from the COA and put a premium
on Chan's testimony.
As described by the prosecution, the offices involved in
the processing of cash advances are technically independent
of each other; one office does not form part of, or is strictly
under, another. Thus, each has independent functions to
perform to ensure that the funds of the local government are
disbursed properly and are well accounted for. While the Court
views Gaviola's failure to inquire further before affixing his
signature despite the absence of the "particulars of payment"
in the disbursement vouchers as negligence on his part, to
additionally affix his signature despite the lack of supporting
documents only shows a gross and inexcusable disregard of
the consequences of his act as approving authority. If Gaviola
bothered to glance at the supporting documents, he could have
signaled to his co-accused that their acts or omissions opened
an opportunity for Badana to commit malversation that would
result in a loss to the local government's coffers.
Conviction is affirmed.
2.
The administrator position demands a close intimate
relationship with the office of the governor (its appointing authority)
to effectively develop, implement and administer the different
programs of the province. To emphasize the close relations that
the provincial administrators' functions have with the office of the
governor, R.A. 7160 even made the provincial administrator position
coterminous with its appointing authority. Administrator Gonzales'
termination for lack of confidence is lawful.

953

PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT OF CAMARINES
NORTE v. GONZALES
701 SCRA 635, July 23, 2013, Brion, J.
Facts: Beatriz Gonzales was appointed as the provincial
administrator of the Province of Camarines Norte by then
Governor Roy A. Padilla, Jr. on April l, 1991. Her appointment
was on a permanent capacity. On March 8, 1999, Governor
Jess B. Pimentel sent Gonzales a memorandum directing her
to explain in writing why no administrative charges should be
filed against her for gross insubordination/gross discourtesy
in the course of official duties, and conduct grossly prejudicial
to the best interest of the service; this was later on captioned
as Administrative Case No. 001. After Gonzales submitted
her comment, an Ad Hoc Investigation Committee found
her guilty of the charges against her, and recommended to
Governor Pimentel that she be held administratively liable.
On September 30, 1999, Governor Pimentel adopted the Ad
Hoc Investigation Committee's recommendation and dismissed
Gonzales.
Gonzales appealed Governor Pimentel's decision to the
Civil Service Commission (CSC). The CSC issued Resolution
No. 001418 modifying Governor Pimentel's decision, finding
Gonzales guilty of insubordination and suspending her for six
months. This decision was appealed by Governor Pimentel,
which the CSC denied in its Resolution No. 001952.
Gonzales then filed a motion for execution and clarification
of Resolution No. 001418, in which she claimed that she had
already served her six-month suspension and asked to be
reinstated. The CSC issued Resolution No. 002245, which
directed Gonzales' reinstatement.
Governor Pimentel reinstated Gonzales as provincial
administrator on October 12, 2000, but terminated her services
the next day for lack of confidence. He then wrote a letter to
the CSC reporting his compliance with its order, and Gonzales'
subsequent dismissal as a confidential employee. In h.is letter,
Governor Pimentel cited Resolution No. 0001158, where the
CSC ruled that the provincial administrator position is highly
confidential and is coterminous in nature.
Ruling: Section 480(b) of RA 7160 now mandates
constant interaction between the provincial administrator and
the provincial governor.

954

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

As the CSC correctly noted in Resolution No. 0001 158, the
administrator position demands a close intimate relationship
with the office of the governor (its appointing authority) to
effectively develop, implement and administer the different
programs of the province. The administrator's functions are to
recommend to the Sanggunian and to advise the governor on all
matters regarding the management and administration of the
province, thus requiring that its occupant enjoy the governor's
full trust and confidence.
To emphasize the close relations that the provincial
administrators' functions have with the office of the governor,
RA 7160 even made the provincial administrator position
coterminous with its appointing authority. This provision, along
with the interrelations between the provincial administrator
and governor under Section 480, renders clear the intent
of Congress to make the provincial administrator position
primarily confidential under the non-career service category of
the civil service.
Congress' reclassification of the provincial administrator
position in RA 7160 is a valid exercise of legislative power that
does not violate Gonzales' security of tenure.
Congress, through RA 7160, did not abolish the provincial
administrator position but significantly modified many of its
aspects. It is now a primarily confidential position under the
non-career service tranche of the civil service.
Thus, Gonzales' permanent appointment as provincial
administrator prior to the enactment of RA 7160 is immaterial
to her removal as provincial administrator. For purposes of
determining whether Gonzales' termination violated her right
to security of tenure, the nature of the position she occupied
at the time of her removal should be considered, and not
merely the nature of her appointment at the time she entered
government service.
Gonzales was reinstated as ordered, but her services were
subsequently terminated under the law prevailing at the time
of the termination of her service; i.e., she was then already
occupying a position that was primarily confidential and
had to be dismissed because she no longer enjoyed the trust
and confidence of the appointing authority. Thus, Gonzales'
termination for lack of confidence was lawful. She could no

Book III Local Government Unit
Title Five • Appointive Local Officials Common to AII
Municipalities, Cities, and Provinces

955

longer be reinstated as provincial administrator of Camarines
Norte or to any other comparable position. This conclusion,
however, is without prejudice to Gonzales' entitlement to
retirement benefits, leave credits, and future employment in
government service.
We hereby GRANT the petition and REVERSE the
Decision of the Court of Appeals.

3: .

The implementation of a closure order may be considered
well within the function of a Municipal Administrator.

BAYGAR v. RIVERA
A.C. No. 8959, October 7, 2020, Hernando, J.
Facts: In her petition, Risie Baygar alleges that Atty.
Claro Rivera committed act constitutive of a Violation of the
Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility
(CPR). At the time of the commission of the act complained of,
Atty. Rivera was the Municipal Administrator of Binangonan
Rizal.
'
Risie alleged that in the morning of March 9, 2010,
officers from the Business Permit and Licensing Office (BPLO)
of Binangonan went to the sari-sari store of her father, Rodolfo
Baygar and informed them that they need to secure a business
permit for their billiard table and a videoke machine.
In the evening of March 17, 2010, Atty. Rivera, together
with BPLO officers, health office, and members of the
Binonganan Police and Special Action Unit, returned to the
store to implement a Closure Order. However, Risie noticed
that the Closure Order was dated March 18, 2010. When she
returned the Closure Order back to them, the enforcers changed
the date and added the phrase "w/BILLIARD." Thereafter,
Atty. Rivera ordered that seizure of billiard accessories to
which Risie protested since the Closure Order did not include
the seizure of the said items. However, Atty. Rivera allegedly
threatened Risie with imprisonment instead of just seizing the
items. Meanwhile, an altercation ensued between Rodolfo and
R. Collantes a member of Atty. Rivera's team, as Rodolfo did
not want to give up the items that were being seized.
This prompted Risie and her father to file various cases
against Atty. Rivera. Aside from this complaint for disbarment,

956

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Rodolfo also instituted an administrative case against Atty.
Rivera before the Civil Service Commission (CSC) and criminal
complaints for Falsification of Public Documents and Robbery
before the Provincial Prosecutor of Rizal.
In its Resolution No. XXI-2014-474 dated August 9, 2014,
the IBP Board of Governors (BOG) adopted with modification
the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating
Commissioner by increasing the period of suspension to one
year.
Ruling: The Court disagrees with the findings and
recommendation of the IBP. A judicious review of the
allegations of Risie failed to show that Atty. Rivera committed
acts constitutive of a Violation of the Lawyer's Path and the
CPR.
According to IBP, it was error on the part of Atty. Rivera
to have criminally charged Risie for violating Municipal
Ordinance No. 2006-006 because she is not the owner of the
business subject of the closure order. We disagree. Whether to
include Risie or not in the charge is purely discretionary on the
part of Atty. Rivera.
Next, the IBP recommends that Atty. Rivera should
be held administratively liable for seizing other items that
are not included in the seizure order and for permanently
implementing the Closure Order. We again disagree. As we
see it, Atty. Rivera was merely implementing the local tax
ordinance when he enforced the Closure and Seizure Orders
on the businesses operated by the Baygar family without the
necessary business permit.
To stress, Atty. Rivera's acts could not be considered as
violations of the Lawyer's Oath and the CPR. Atty. Rivera
was merely performing his official duties as Municipal
Administrator of the Municipality of Binangonan, particularly
the implementation of the Closure Order against the businesses
operated by the Baygar family and matters related thereto.
As Municipal Administrator, one of his duties is to "assist
in the coordination of the work of all the officials of the local
government unit, under the supervision, direction, and control
of the governor or mayor, and for this purpose, he may convene
the chiefs of offices and other officials of the local government
unit."

A.

Decided Cases

1. Representation by a private law firm of a municipality is
not allowed. (Ramos v. Court ofAppeals, 108 SCRA 728.)
The legislative intent to prohibit a municipality from
employing private counsel in its lawsuits is further implemented
by Section 3 of the Local Autonomy Act, R.A. 2264, which provides
that the municipal attorney, as head of the legal division or office of
a municipality, "shall act as legal counsel of the municipality and
perform such duties and exercise such powers as may be assigned to
him by the council." (Ibid.)
View that a municipality or province may hire a competent
counsel if it feels the case is of such importance that services of
the fiscal and/or municipal attorney would be inadequate and the
assistance of private counsel is offered gratis. (Ibid.)
2. Only the provincial fiscal, provincial attorney, and
municipal attorney should represent a municipality in lawsuits.
Private lawyers may not represent municipalities on their own,
and neither may they do so even in collaboration with authorized
government lawyers.

960

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

RAMOSv.CA
269 SCRA 34, March 3, 1997, Panganiban, J.

Facts: Petitioners filed a petition before the court for the
Declaration of Nullity of Municipal Ordinances No. 91 (1976)
and No. 7 (1990) and the contract of lease over a commercial
arcade to be constructed in the municipality of Bali[v]ag,
Bulacan. The Provincial Fiscal initially appeared for the
municipality. Petitioners questioned the personality of Atty.
Roberto Romanillos to appear as counsel of the respondent
municipality, and to declare null and void the proceedings
participated in and undertaken by Atty. Romanillos.
Atty. Romanillos and Atty. Regalado, the Provincial
attorney, filed a joint motion stating, among others, that
Atty. Romanillos was withdrawing as counsel for respondent
municipality and that Atty. Regalado, as his collaborating
counsel for respondent municipality, is adopting the entire
proceedings participated in/undertaken by Atty. Romanillos.
Respondent Judge issued the Order now being assailed which
denied petitioners' motion to disqualify Atty. Romanillos as
counsel for respondent municipality and to declare null and
void the proceedings participated in by Atty. Romanillos.
Held: Section 1683 of the Revised Administrative Code
provides: Duty of fiscal to represent provinces and provincial
subdivisions in litigation.
The provincial fiscal shall
represent the province and any municipality or municipal
district thereof in any court, except in cases whereof (sic)
original jurisdiction is vested in the Supreme Court or in cases
where the municipality or municipal district in question is a
party adverse to the provincial government or to some other
municipality or municipal district in the same province. When
the interests of a provincial government and of any political
division thereof are opposed, the provincial fiscal shall act on
behalf of the province.
When the provincial fiscal is disqualified to serve any
municipality or other political subdivision of a province,
a special attorney may be employed by its council. Under
the above provision, complemented by Section 3, Republic
Act No. 2264, the Local Autonomy Law, only the provincial
fiscal and the municipal attorney can represent a province or
municipality in their lawsuits. The provision is mandatory.

Book III-- Local Government Units
Title Five - Appointive Local Officials Common to All
Municipalities, Cities, and Provinces

961

The municipality's authority to employ a private lawyer is
expressly limited only to situations where the provincial fiscal
is disqualified to represent it.
In sum, although a municipality may not hire a private
lawyer to represent it in litigations, in the interest of substantial
justice however, we hold that a municipality may adopt the work
already performed in good faith by such private lawyer, which
work is beneficial to it: () provided that no injustice is thereby
heaped on the adverse party; and (2) provided further that no
compensation in any guise is paid therefor by said municipality
to the private lawyer. Unless so expressly adopted, the private
lawyers work cannot bind the municipality.
3.
In view of the damages sought which, if granted, could
result in personal liability, respondents could not be deemed to have
been improperly represented by private counsel. No error may thus
be attnbuted to the appellate court when it recognized the right of
respondents to be represented by private counsel.
MAN CENIDO v. COURT OF APPEALS
330 SCRA 419, April 12, 2000, Quisumbing, J.

Facts: On September 6, 1990, private respondent [herein
petitioner] Eduardo Mancenido filed an action for mandamus
and damages with the RTC of Camarines Norte, against the
petitioners provincial board of Camarines Norte, the school
board, provincial governor, provincial treasurer, and provincial
auditor to pay the teacher's claim for unpaid salary increases.
For our resolution now is the following issue: (1) Whether

a private counsel may represent municipal officials sued in
their official capacities.

Ruling: Sec. 481, Article 11, Title V of the Local
Government Code (R.A. No. 7160) provides for the appointment
of a legal officer.
The Court has previously ruled on the representation of a
local government unit by a private attorney. In Municipality of
Bocaue v. Manotok, 93 Phil. 173 (1953), and succeeding cases,
we held that only when the provincial fiscal is disqualified
may the municipal council be authorized to hire the services
of a special attorney. We reiterated this in De Guia v. Auditor
General, 44 SCRA 169 (1972). In Enriquez, Sr. vu. Gimenez,

962

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

107 Phil 932 (1960), we enumerated the instances when the
provincial public prosecutor is disqualified from representing
a particular municipality, i.e., when the jurisdiction of a case
involving the municipality lies with the Supreme Court, when
the municipality is a party adverse to the provincial government
or to some other municipality in the same province, and when
in a case involving the municipality, the provincial prosecutor,
his spouse, or his child is involved as a creditor, heir, legatee,
or otherwise.
But do these rulings equally apply to local government
officials? In Alinsug v. RTC, Br. 58, San Carlos City, Negros
Occidental, 225 SCRA 559 (1993), we laid down the rule that,
in resolving whether a local government official may secure the
services of private counsel in an action filed against him in his
official capacity, the nature of the action and the relief sought are
to be considered. In Albuera v. Torres, 192 Phil. 211 (1957), we
approved the representation by private counsel of a provincial
governor sued in his official capacity, where the complaint
contained other allegations and a prayer for moral damages,
which, if due from the defendants, must be satisfied by them
in their private capacity. In Province of Cebu v. Intermediate
Appellate Court, 147 SCRA 447 (1987), we declared that where
rigid adherence to the law on representation would deprive a
party of his right to redress for a valid grievance, the hiring of
private counsel would be proper.
The present case had its origins in Civil Case No. 5864
filed before the RTC of Camarines Norte, Branch 38, for
mandamus and damages, Notwithstanding the fact that the
trial court granted mandamus, petitioners appealed to the
Court of Appeals since the trial court did not award damages.
In view of the damages sought which, if granted, could result
in personal liability, respondents could not be deemed to have
been improperly represented by private counsel. No error may
thus be attributed to the appellate court when it recognized the
right of respondents to be represented by private counsel.
The instant petition is hereby DENIED.
4.
Because of the vacancy in the Office of the City Legal
Officer, the City Prosecutor's appearance as counsel of Urdaneta
City is proper. The City Prosecutor remains as the city's legal adviser
and officer for civil cases, a function that could not yet be transferred

Title Five Appointive Local Offcials Common to All

963

to the city legal officer. The private law firm's appearance is not
justified as there is no claim for damages against the officials. That
the firm is counsel of the Mayor in his criminal cases is of no moment.

ASEAN PACIFIC PLANNERS v. CITY OF URDANETA
566 SCRA 219, September 23, 2008, Quisumbing, J.
Facts: This case stemmed from a Complaint for
annulment of contracts filed by respondent Waldo C. Del
Castillo, in his capacity as taxpayer, against respondents City
of Urdaneta and Ceferino J. Capalad doing business under
the name JJEFWA Builders, and petitioners Asean Pacific
Planners (APP) represented by Ronilo G. Goco and Asean
Pacific Planners Construction and Development Corporation
(APPCDC) represented by Cesar D. Goco.
Del Castillo alleged that then Urdaneta City Mayor
Rodolfo E. Parayno entered into five contracts for the
preliminary design, construction and management of a four.
storey twin cinema commercial center and hotel involving
a massive expenditure of public funds amounting to P250
million, funded by a loan from the Philippine National Bank
(PNB). For minimal work, the contractor was allegedly paid
P95 million. Del Castillo also claimed that all the contracts
are void because the object is outside the commerce of men.
The object is a piece of land belonging to the public domain
and which remains devoted to a public purpose as a public
elementary school. Additionally, he claimed that the contracts,
from the feasibility study to management and lease of the
future building, are also void because they were all awarded
solely to the Goco family.
In their Answer, APP and APPCDC claimed that the
contracts are valid. Urdaneta City Mayor Amadeo R. Perez,
Jr., who filed the city's Answer, joined in the defense and
asserted that the contracts were properly executed by then
Mayor Parayno with prior authority from the Sangguniang
Panlungsod. Mayor Perez also stated that Del Castillo has no
legal capacity to sue and that the complaint states no cause
of action. For respondent Ceferino J. Capalad, Atty. Oscar C.
Sahagun filed an Answer with compulsory counterclaim and
motion to dismiss on the ground that Del Castillo has no legal
standing to sue.

964

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Respondents Norberto M. Del Prado, Jesus A. Ordono
and Aquilino Maguisa became parties to the case when they
jointly filed, also in their capacity as taxpayers, a Complaintin-Intervention adopting the allegations of Del Castillo.
After pretrial, the Lazaro Law Firm entered its
appearance as counsel for Urdaneta City and filed an Omnibus
Motion with prayer to (l) withdraw Urdaneta City's Answer;
(2) drop Urdaneta City as defendant and be joined as plaintiff;
(3) admit Urdaneta City's complaint; and (4) conduct a new
pre-trial. Urdaneta City allegedly wanted to rectify its position
and claimed that inadequate legal representation caused its
inability to file the necessary pleadings in representation of its
interests.
Ruling: Section 481(a) of the Local Government Code
(LGC) of 1991 mandates the appointment of a city legal officer.
Under Section 48l(b)(3)(i) of the LGC, the city legal officer is
supposed to represent the city in all civil actions, as in this
case, and special proceedings wherein the city or any of its
officials is a party. In the case of Urdaneta City, however, the
position of city legal officer is still vacant, although its charter
was acted way back in 1998.
Because ofsuch vacancy, the City Prosecutor's appearance
as counsel of Urdaneta City is proper. The City Prosecutor
remains as the city's legal adviser and officer for civil cases,
a function that could not yet be transferred to the city legal
officer. Under the circumstances, the RTC should not have
allowed the entry of appearance of the Lazaro Law Firm vice
the City Prosecutor.
And we have consistently held that a local government
unit cannot be represented by private counsel as only public
officers may act for and in behalf of public entities and public
funds should not be spent to hire private lawyers. Pro bono
representation in collaboration with the municipal attorney
and prosecutor has not even been allowed.
Neither is the law firm's appearance justified under the
instances listed in Mancenido v[,] CA, 330 SCRA 419 (2000),
when local government officials can be represented by private
counsel, such as when a claim for damages could result in
personal liability. No such claim against said officials was made
in this case. Note that before it joined the complainants, the

city was the one sued, not its officials. That the firm represents
Mayor Perez in criminal cases, suits in his personal capacity,
is of no moment.
We Deny the entry of appearance of the Lazaro Law Firm
as counsel of Urdaneta City.
5. The municipal council sought the services of a lawyer
because the dispute was between the municipality (Tiwi) and
province (Albay) so much so that it fell under the exception provided
in Section 48l(b)(3)(i) of the LGC which permits a local government
unit to employ the services of a special legal officer.
MUNICIPALITY OF TIWI v. BETITO
624 SCRA 623, July 9, 2010, Del Castillo, J.

Facts: The present controversy arose when respondent
Atty. Antonio Betito sought to enforce the Contract of Legal
Services after rendering the aforementioned legal services
which allegedly benefited Tiwi.
In his complaint for sum of money, Respondent claims
that he handled numerous cases which resulted to the recovery
of Tiwi's share in the realty taxes. As a result of these efforts,
Tiwi was able to collect the amount of P110,985,181.83 and
another P35,594,480.00 from the NPC as well as other amounts
which will be proven during the trial. Under the Contract
of Legal Services, respondent is entitled to 10% of whatever
amount that would be collected from the NPC. However,
despite repeated demands for the Sangguniang Bayan of
Tiwi to pass an appropriate ordinance for the payment of his
attorney's fees, the former refused to pass the ordinance and to
pay what is justly owed him.
Ruling: The wording of Resolution No. 15-92 of the
Sangguniang Bayan of Tiwi, Albay is clear. Its title and
whereas clauses, previously quoted above, indicate that
the hiring of a lawyer was for the sole purpose of executing
the judgment in National Power Corporation v. Province of
Albay, 186 SCRA 198 (1990), that is, to allow Tiwi to recover
its rightful share in the unpaid realty taxes of NPC. In his
Complaint, respondent admits that he was furnished and read
a copy of the said resolution before he entered into the subject
contract. He cannot now feign ignorance of the limitations of

966

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the authority of Mayor Corral to enter into the subject contract
and the purpose for which his services were employed.
We cannot accept respondent's strained reading of
Resolution No. 15-92 in that the phrase "to represent the
interest of the Municipality of'Tiwi and its Barangays" is taken
to mean such other matters not related to the execution of the
decision in National Power Corporation u. Province ofAlbay. It
could not have been the intention of the Sangguniang Bayan
of TYwi to authorize the hiring of a lawyer to perform general
legal services because this duty devolves upon the municipal
legal officer. The council sought the services of a lawyer
because the dispute was between the municipality (Tiwi) and
province (Albay) so much so that it fell under the exception
provided in Section 481(b)(3)(i) of the LGC which permits a
local government unit to employ the services of a special legal
officer. Thus, the provisions of paragraph 4 of the Contract of
Legal Services to the contrary notwithstanding, the basis of
respondent's compensation should be limited to the services
he rendered which reasonably contributed to the recovery of
Tiwi's share in the subject realty taxes.
In sum, the allegations and admissions in the pleadings
are sufficient to rule that Mayor Corral was duly authorized to
enter into the Contract of Legal Services. However, the legal
services contemplated therein, which are properly compensable,
are limited to such services which reasonably contributed to
the recovery of Tiwi's rightful share in the unpaid realty taxes
of NPC. Paragraph 4 of the Contract of Legal Services, insofar
as it covers legal services outside of this purpose, is therefore
unenforceable.
While the foregoing issues may be settled through the
admissions in the pleadings, the actual attorney's fees due to
respondent cannot still be determined.
The petition is GRANTED. The Decision of the Court
of Appeals are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. This case is
REMANDED to the trial court for further proceedings to
determine the reasonable amount of attorney's fees which
respondent is entitled to in accordance with the guidelines set
in this Decision.

6. The CA committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to
lack or excess ofjurisdiction in issuing the assailed resolutions which
obligated the OSG to represent the Municipality of Saguiran. Such
ruling disregarded the provisions of the LGC that vested exclusive
authority upon legal officers to be counsels of local government
units.
OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL v.
COURT OF APPEALS
725 SCRA 498, June 9, 2014, Reyes, J.
Facts: The Municipality of Saguiran was named a
respondent in a petition for mandamus filed with the RTC
of Lanao del Sur by the former members of the Sangguniang
Bayan of Saguiran, namely, Macmod P. Masorong, Amrosi
MacoteSamporna (sic), Alanie L. Dalama, Hassan P. AmaiKurot and Cadalay S. Rataban. Therein petitioners sought to
compel the Municipality of Saguiran to pay them the aggregate
amount of P726,000.00, representing their unpaid terminal
leave benefits under Section 5 of the CSC Memorandum
Circular Nos. 41, Series of 1998 and 14, Series of 1999. The
Municipality of Saguiran sought the trial court's dismissal
of the petition through its Verified Answer with Affirmative
Defenses and Counterclaim which was signed by Municipal
Mayor Hadjah Rasmia B. Macabago and Municipal Treasurer
Hadji Mautinter Dimacaling.

On January 6, 2009, the RTC issued an Order dismissing
the petition on the ground that the act being sought by therein
petitioners was not a ministerial duty. The RTC explained
that the payment of terminal leave benefits had to undergo
the ordinary process of verification, approval or disapproval by
municipal officials. It, nonetheless, directed the Municipality
of Saguiran to include in its general or special budget for the
year 2009 the subject claims for terminal leave benefits.
Dissatisfied with the RTC's directive for the inclusion of
the subject claims in the municipality's budget, the Municipality
of Saguiran partially appealed the order of the RTC to the CA.
On December 14, 2009, the appellate court issued a notic (sic)
requiring the OSG to fle a memorandum for the Municipality
of Saguiran within a non-extendible period of 30 days.
Ruling: The OSG's powers and functions are defined
in the Administrative Code of 1987 (Administrative Code),

968

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

particularly in Section 35, Book IV, Title III, Chapter 12
thereof, which reads:
Sec. 35. Powers and Functions. - The Office of the
Solicitor General shall represent the Government of
the Philippines, its agencies and instrumentalities and
its officials and agents in any litigation, proceeding,
investigation or matter requiring the services of a lawyer.
When authorized by the President or head of the office
concerned, it shall also represent government-owned or
controlled corporations. The Office of the Solicitor General
shall constitute the Jaw office of the Government and, as
such, shall discharge duties requiring the services of a
lawyer. It shall have the following specific powers and
functions:
(1) Represent the Government in the Supreme
Court and the Court ofAppeals in all criminal proceedings;
represent the Government and its officers in the Supreme
Court, the Court of Appeals, and all other courts or
tribunals in all civil actions and special proceedings in
which the Government or any officer thereof in his official
capacity is a party;
On the matter of counsels' representation for the
government, the Administrative Code is not the only law that
delves on the issue. Specifically for local government units,
the LGC limits the lawyers who are authorized to represent
them in court actions, as the law defines the mandate of a local
government unit's legal officer. Book III, Title V, Article XI,
Section 481 of the LGC.
Evidently, this provision of the LGC not only identifies the
powers and functions of a local government unit's legal officer.
It also restricts, as it names, the lawyer who may represent
the local government unit as its counsel in court proceedings.
Being a special law on the issue of representation in court that
is exclusively made applicable to local government units, the
LGC must prevail over the provisions of the Administrative
Code, which classifies only as a general law on the subject
matter.
Given the foregoing, the CA committed grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess ofjurisdiction in issuing
the assailed resolutions which obligated the OSG to represent

Book III Local Government Units
Title Five Appointive Local Officials Common to All
Municipalities, Cities, and Provinces

969

the Municipality of Saguiran. Such ruling disregarded the
provisions of the LGC that vested exclusive authority upon
legal officers to be counsels oflocal government units. Even the
employment of a special legal officer is expressly allowed by the
law only upon a strict condition that the action or proceeding
which involves the component city or municipality is adverse
to the provincial government or to another component city or
municipality.
The petition is GRANTED. The Resolutions of the Court
ofAppeals are ANNULLED and SET ASIDE. The Legal Officer
of the Municipal Government of Saguiran, Lanao de! Sur, or if
there is none, the Provincial Attorney of the Province of Lanao
de! Sur, and not the Office of the Solicitor General, has the
duty to represent the local government unit as counsel in CAG.R. SP No. 02816-MIN.

Decided Case

I. On the element of bad faith and manifest partiality,
Caunan made it appear that the compost equipment subject of P.O.
No. 0005031 was in the official custody of the government by signing
the disbursement voucher and issuing a memorandum receipt for
compost equipment which was not in fact delivered.
CAUNAN v. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES
784 SCRA 693, February 24, 2016, Reyes, J.
Facts: On August 15, 2000, Dra. Magnolia Punzalan
(Punzalan), as the then Chairman of Barangay Marcelo Green,
requested for the purchase of Compost Garbage and Recycling
Equipment (compost equipment) from the City Government
of Paranaque (City Government), intended to be used in their
barangay. However, her request was not acted upon even after
she finished her term in 2002.
In a letter dated October 21, 2002, Punzalan repudiated
that she received the delivery of compost equipment in
Barangay Marcelo Green; she likewise disclaimed the signature
purporting to be hers on the documents attached to the letter
of inquiry.

988

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

To clear her name, Punzalan lodged a complaint before the
Ombudsman. After preliminary investigation, an Information
was filed before the Sandiganbayan against the following:
Silvestre De Leon (De Leon), City Treasurer; Antonio Abad III
(Abad), City Administrator; Caunan, the Officer-in Charge of
the General Services Offices; and Ricardo Adriano (Adriano),
the proprietor of Julia Enterprises for violation of Section 3(e)
of R.A. No. 3019.
Accused [Caunan] is found guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of having violated [R.A. No.] 3019, Section 3 (e).
Ruling: First, it is undisputed that Caunan is a public
officer, as she is the Officer in Charge of the Department of
General Services of the City Government. [ ]Under the Local
Government Code of 1991, the general services officer performs
all functions pertaining to supply and property management
in the local government unit concerned[,] (Sec. 490). The
duties and functions of a general services officer were further
expounded by the Sandiganbayan:
The functions of accused Caunan as the General Services
Officer of the City of Paranaque are:
1) As the General Services Officer of the City of
Paranaque, she is mandated under the Local Government
Code to "(t)ake custody of and be accountable for all
properties, real or personal, owned by the local government
unit".
For the transaction/purchase in this case, it was
accused Caunan as the General Services Officer who
acted as the purchasing officer for the City of Paranaque.
3) On the point bearing on the delivery and
inspection of purchased items, Section 114 of the Rules
and Regulations on Supply and Property Management
specifically provides that "(a)ll items to be inspected
shall be accepted first by the general services officer,
municipal or barangay treasurer, as the case may be."
x x x Thus, the equipment (supposedly delivered) to be
inspected should have first been accepted by her, as the
purchasing officer.
Second, on the element of bad faith and manifest
partiality, Caunan made it appear that the compost equipment

Municipalities, Cities, and Provinces

989

subject of P.O. No. 0005031 was in the official custody of the
government by signing the disbursement voucher and issuing
a memorandum receipt for compost equipment which was not
in fact delivered.
Thus, no delivery under P.O. No. 0005031 was made
resulting to a loss of P861,600.00 on the part of the government
for which Caunan must be held liable. As the general services
officer concerned, she participated in the issuance ofdocuments
which facilitated the payment of undelivered compost
equipment.
The petition is DENIED.

Decided Cases

1.
The COMELEC has no jurisdiction over election protests
of elections of the offices of the katipunan ng mga barangay. The
respondent Local Governments Secretary likewise has nojurisdiction
to hear election protest involving officers of the Federation of
Associations of Barangay Councils (FABC). The recourse of the
parties is to the ordinary courts.

TAULE v. SANTOS
200 SCRA 512, August 12, 1991, Gancayco, J.
Facts: On June 18, 1989, the Federation of Associations
of Barangay Councils (FABC) of Catanduanes, composed
of eleven (11) members, in their capacities as Presidents
of the Association of Barangay Councils in their respective
municipalities, convened in Virac, Catanduanes with six
members in attendance for the purpose of holding the election
of its officers.
On June I9, 1989, respondent Leandro I. Verceles,
Governor of Catanduanes, sent a letter to respondent Luis
T. Santos, the Secretary of Local Government, protesting the
election of the officers of the FABC and seeking its nullification
in view of alleged flagrant irregularities in the manner it was
conducted.
Petitioner Ruperto Taule as President of the ABC, filed his
comment on the letter-protest of respondent Governor denying

992

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

the alleged irregularities and denouncing said respondent
Governor for meddling or intervening in the election of FABC
officers which is a purely nonpartisan affair and at the same
time requesting for his appointment as a member of the
Sangguniang Panlalawigan of the province being the duly
elected President of the FABC in Catanduanes.
Held: The Court agrees with the Solicitor General-that
the jurisdiction of the COMELEC is over popular elections, the
elected officials of which are determined through the will of the
electorate.
The jurisdiction of the COMELEC does not cover protests
over the organizational setup of the katipunan ng mga
barangay composed of popularly elected punong barangays
as prescribed by law whose officers are voted upon by their
respective members. The COMELEC exercises only appellate
jurisdiction over election contests involving elective barangay
officials decided by the Metropolitan or Municipal Trial Courts
which likewise have limited jurisdiction. The authority of the
COMELEC over the katipunan ng mga barangay is limited by
law to supervision of the election of the representative of the
katipunan concerned to the sanggunian in a particular level
conducted by their own respective organization.
The Secretary of Local Government is likewise not vested
with jurisdiction to entertain any protest involving the election
of officers of the FABC.
The Court holds that in assuming jurisdiction over the
election protest filed by respondent Governor and declaring
the election of the officers of the FABC on June 18, 1989 as
null and void, the respondent Secretary acted in excess of
his jurisdiction. The respondent Secretary not having the
jurisdiction to hear an election protest involving officers of the
FABC, the recourse of the parties is to the ordinary courts. The
Regional Trial Courts have the exclusive original jurisdiction
to hear the protest (B .P Big. (sic) 129, Sec. I 9, provides as
follows "Jurisdiction in Civil cases. Regional Trial Courts
shall exercise original jurisdiction: x x z (6) In all cases not
within the exclusive jurisdiction of any court, tribunal, person
or body exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions.[]")

Book III Local Government Units
Title Six - Leagues of Local Government Units and Elective Officials

993

Nevertheless, the Court holds that the issue ofthe validity
of the elections should now be resolved in order to prevent any
unnecessary delay that may result from the commencement of
an appropriate action by the parties.
The elections were declared null and void primarily for
failure to comply with Section 2.4 of DLG Circular No. 89-09
which provides that "the incumbent FABC President or the
Vice-President shall preside over the reorganizational meeting,
there being a quorum."
It is admitted that neither the incumbent FABC
President nor the Vice-President presided over the meeting
and elections but Alberto P. Molina, Jr., the Chairman of the
Board of Election Supervisors/Consultants. Thus, there was a
clear violation of the aforesaid mandatory provision. On this
ground, the elections should be nullified.
Under Sec. 2.3.2. 7 of the same circular it is provided
that a Board of Election Supervisors/Consultants shall be
constituted to oversee and or witness the canvassing of votes
and proclamation of winners.
In case at bar, PGOO Alberto Molina, the Chairman
of the Board, presided over the elections. There was direct
participation by the Chairman of the Board in the elections
contrary to what is dictated by the rules. Worse, there was no
Board of Election Supervisors to oversee the elections in view
of the walk out staged by its two other members, the Provincial
COMELEC Supervisor and the Provincial Treasurer. The
objective of keeping the election free and honest was therefore
compromised.
The Court therefore finds that the election of officers of
the FABC held on June 18, 1989 is null and void for failure
to comply with the provisions of DLG Circular No. 89-09. A
new election of officers of the federation is hereby ordered to be
conducted immediately in accordance with the governing rules
and regulations.
The resolution of respondent Secretary dated August 4,
1989 is hereby SET ASIDE for having been issued in excess of
jurisdiction.

2.
The creation of additional positions in the National
Liga ng Mga Barangay and its chapters is authorized by the Local
Government Code.
VIOLA v. ALUNAN III
277 SCRA 409, August 15, 1997, Mendoza, J.

Facts: Petitioner Cesar G. Viola brought this action as
barangay chairman of Bgy. 167, Zone 15, District II, Manila
against then Secretary oflnterior and Local Government Rafael
M. Alunan III, Alex L. David, president/secretary general of
the National Liga ng mga Barangay, and Leonardo L. Angat,
president of the City of Manila Liga ng Mga Barangay, to
restrain them from carrying out the elections for the questioned
positions on July 3, 1994.
Petitioner's contention is that the positions in question
are in excess of those provided in the Local Government Code
(RA. No. 7160), Sec. 493 of which mentions as elective positions
only those of president, vice president, and five members of
the board of directors in each chapter at the municipal, city,
provincial, metropolitan political subdivision, and national
levels.
Petitioner argues that, in providing for the positions offirst,
second and third vice presidents and auditor for each chapter,
Secs. 1-2 of the Implementing Rules expanded the number
of positions authorized in Sec. 493 of the Local Government
Code in violation of the principle that implementing rules and
regulations cannot add or detract from the provisions of the
law they are designed to implement.

Held: Petitioner's contention that the additional
positions in question have been created without authority of
law is untenable. To begin with, the creation of these positions
was actually made in the Constitution and By-laws of the Liga
ng mga Barangay, which was adopted by the First Barangay
National Assembly on January 11, 1994. The post of executive
vice president is in reality that of the vice president in Sec.
493 of the LGC, so that the only additional positions created
for each chapter in the Constitution and By-laws are those of
first, second and third vice presidents and auditor. Contrary to
petitioner's contention, the creation of the additional positions
is authorized by the Sec. 493, LGC.

Book III Local Government Units
Title Six Leagues of Local Government Units and Elective Officials

996

This provision in fact requires and not merely authorizes
the board of directors to "create such other positions as it
may deem necessary for the management of the chapter" and
belies petitioner's claim that said provision limits the officers of
a chapter to the president, vice president, five members of the
board of directors, secretary, and treasurer.
We hold that Sec. 493 of the Local Government Code, in
directing the board of directors of the liga to "create such other
positions as may be
d eemed necessary for the management of
the chapter[s]," embodies a fairly intelligible standard. There
is no undue delegation of power by Congress. Nor is it correct
to say that Sec. 493, in providing that additional positions to
be created must be those which are "deemed necessary for the
management of the chapter," contemplates only appointive
positions. Management positions are not necessarily limited
to appointive positions. Elective officers, such as the president
and vice president, can be expected to be involved in the
general administration or management of the chapter. Hence,
the creation of other elective positions which may be deemed
necessary for the management of the chapter is within the
purview of Sec. 493.
Petition is DISMISSED.
3.
In authorizing the filing of the petition for review of the
decision of the Board of Election Supervisors (BES) with the regular
courts, the DILG Secretary in effect amended and modified the
GUIDELINES promulgated by the National Liga Board and adopted
by the LIGA which provides that the decision of the BES shall be
subject to review by the National Liga Board. The amendment of the
GUIDELINES is more than an exercise of the power of supervision
but is an exercise of the power of control, which the President nor
the DILG Secretary does not have over the LIGA.
BITO-ONON v. FERNANDEZ
350 SCRA 732, 7/31/01, Gonzaga-Reyes, J.

Facts: Petitioner, Joel Bito-Onon is the duly elected
Barangay Chairman of Barangay Tacras, Narra, Palawan and
is the Municipal Liga Chapter President for the Municipality
of Narra, Palawan. The private respondent, Elegio Quejano,
Jr. on the other hand, is the duly elected Barangay Chairman
of Barangay Rizal, Magsaysay, Pala wan and is the Municipal

996

THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT
CODE OF 1991 ANNOTATED

Liga Chapter President for the Municipality of Magsaysay,
Palawan.
Both Onan and Quejano were candidates for the position
of Executive Vice-President in the August 23, 1997 election
for the Liga ng Barangay Provincial Chapter of the province
of Palawan. Onan was proclaimed the winning candidate in
the said election prompting Quejano to file a post proclamation
protest with the Board of Election Supervisors (BES), which
was decided against him on August 25, 1997. Not satisfied with
the decision of the BES, Quejano filed a Petition for Review of
the decision of the BES with the RTC of Palawan and Puerto
Princesa City. On April 26, 1999, Onan filed a motion to dismiss
the Petition raising the issue of jurisdiction claiming that the
RTC had no jurisdiction to review the decisions rendered by
the BES.
Held: The DILG memorandum circular reads, insofar as
pertinent, as follows:
"Any post-proclamation protest must be filed with
the BES within twenty-four (24) hours from the closing of
the election. The BES shall decide the same within fortyeight (48) hours from receipt thereof. The decision of the
BES shall be final and immediately executory without
prejudice to the filing of a Petition for Review with the
regular courts of law."
On the other hand, the NLB GUIDELINES provides that
the BES shall have the following among its duties:
"To resolve any post-proclamation electoral protest
which must be submitted in writing to this Board within
twenty-four (24) hours from the close of election; provided
said Board shall render its decision within forty-eight
(48) hours from receipt hereof; and provided further
that the decision must be submitted to the National
Liga Headquarters within twenty-four (24) hours from
the said decision. The decision of the Board of Election
Supervisors in this respect shall be subject to review by
the National Liga Board the decision of which shall be
final and executory."
Does the President's power of general supervision extend
to the liga ng mga barangay, which is not a local government
unit? We rule in the affirmative. In Opinion No. 41, Series of

Book III - Local Government Units
Title Six Leagues of Local Government Units and Elective Officials

997

1995, the Department of Justice ruled that the Jiga ng mga
barangay is a government organization, being an association,
federation, league or union created by law or by authority oflaw,
whose members are either appointed or elected government
officials.
The ligas are primarily governed by the provisions of the
Local Government Code. However, their respective constitution
and bylaws shall govern all other matters affecting the internal
organization of the liga not otherwise provided for in the Local
Government Code provided that the constitution and bylaws
shall be suppletory to the provisions of Book III, Title VI of
the Local Government Code and shall always conform to the
provisions of the Constitution and existing laws.
Having in mind the foregoing principles, we rule that
Memorandum Circular No. 97-193 of the DILG insofar as it
authorizes the filing a Petition for Review of the decision of the
BES with the regular courts in a post proclamation electoral
protest is of doubtful constitutionality. We agree with both
the petitioner and the Solicitor General that in authorizing
the filing of the petition for review of the decision of the BES
with the regular courts, the DILG Secretary in effect amended
and modified the GUIDELINES promulgated by the National
Liga Board and adopted by the LIGA which provides that the
decision of the BES shall be subject to review by the National
Liga Board. The amendment of the GUIDELINES is more than
an exercise of the power of supervision but is an exercise of the
power of control, which the President does not have over the
LIGA. The public respondent judge therefore committed grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction
in not dismissing the respondent's Petition for Review for
failure to exhaust all administrative remedies and for lack of
jurisdiction.
Petition is hereby GRANTED.
4. In National Liga ng mga Barangay v. Paredes (supra)
the Supreme Court ruled that the DILG's authority over the Liga
is limited to seeing to it that the rules are followed. Like local
government units, the Liga is not subject to control by the Chief
Executive or his alter ego.

A.

Decided Case

1.
The rule is settled that unless "holding over be expressly
or impliedly prohibited, the incumbent may continue to hold over
until someone else is elected and qualified to assume the office."

GALAROSA v. VALENCIA
227 SCRA 728, November 11, 1993, Davide, Jr., J.
Facts: Petitioner Raul A. Galarosa is the incumbent
president of the katipunang bayan or Association of Barangay
Councils (ABC) of Sorsogon, province of Sorsogon, and was
appointed as a member of the Sangguniang Bayan (SB) of
Sorsogon pursuant to E.O. No. 342 in relation to Section 146 of
Batas Pambansa Blg. 337 the Local Government Code of 1983.
The salient issue in this case is whether or not Galarosa
can continue to serve as a member of the SB beyond 30 June
1992, the date when the term of office of the elective members
of the SB of Sorsogon expired. The respondent Judge ruled that
GALAROSA could not; Galarosa thinks otherwise and asks us
to set aside the decision of the court a quo.
Held: Section 494 of the Local Government Code of
1991 provides for the ex officio membership in the respective
sanggunians of the duly elected presidents of the liga at the
municipal, city and provincial levels, including the component
cities and municipalities of Metropolitan Manila. The liga
referred to therein is the liga ng mga barangay. Section 491 of
the Code provides for its creation and purpose.
Every barangay is represented in the liga ng mga barangay
by the punong barangay, or in his absence or incapacity, by

Book III Local Government Units
Title Six Leagues of Local Government Units and Elective Officials

999

a sanggunian member duly elected for the purpose among its
members.
Immediately prior to the passage ofthe Local Government
Code of 1991, the katipunang bayan or ABC in a municipality
was composed of the barangay captains who were elected in
the barangay elections of 28 March 1989 held pursuant to R.A.
No. 6679. In the case at bar, it is presumed that Galarosa was
an elected punong barangay in the municipality of Sorsogon
and was later elected president of the ABC of Sorsogon.
There is no law which prohibits ABC Presidents from
holding over as members of the sangguniang bayan. On the
contrary, the Implementing Rules and Regulations, prepared
and issued by the Oversight Committee upon specific mandate
of Section 533 of the Local Government Code, expressly
recognizes and grants that hold-over authority to ABC
presidents. Pertinent portions are paragraphs (d) and (f),
Article 210 of the IRR.
The application of the hold-over doctrine in both the
aforementioned provisions of the IRR and the issuances of the
DILG should be upheld. The rule is settled that unless "holding
over be expressly or impliedly prohibited, the incumbent
may continue to hold over until some one else is elected and
qualified to assume the office." This rule is demanded by the
"most obvious requirements of public policy, for without it
there must frequently be cases where, from a failure to elect or
a refusal or neglect to qualify, the office would be vacant and
the public service entirely suspended."
Since the term of office of the punong barangays elected
in the 28 March 1989 election and the term of office of the
presidents of the ABC have not yet expired and taking into
account the special role conferred upon and the broader powers
and functions invested in the barangays by the Code as a basic
political unit, it would be in harmony with sound logic to
infer that the Code never intended to deprive the barangays
of their representation in the sangguniang bayan during the
interregnum when the liga has yet to be formally organized
with the election of its officers.
Galarosa can validly hold over as a member of the
sangguniang bayan of Sorsogon, Sorsogon.

provisions of this Code are hereby repealed or

A.

Decided Cases
1. The provisions of the LGC do not necessarily repeal
the laws creating the LLDA and granting the latter water rights
authority over Laguna de Bay and the lake region.
LAGUNA LAKE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY v. CA
251 SCRA 42, December 7, 1995, Hermosisima, Jr., J.
Facts: Republic Act No. 4850 created the "Laguna Lake
Development Authority." This Government Agency is supposed
to accelerate the development and balanced growth of the
Laguna Lake area. The Authority sent notices to the concerned
owners of the illegally constructed fishpens, fishcages and
other aqua-culture structures advising them to dismantle their
respective structures within ten (10) days from receipt thereof,
otherwise, demolition shall be effected.
Reacting thereto, the affected fishpen owners filed
injunction cases against the Authority before various Regional
Trial Courts.
Held: The provisions of Republic Act No. 7160 do not
necessarily repeal the aforementioned laws creating the
Laguna Lake Development Authority and granting the latter
water rights authority over Laguna de Bay and the lake
region. The Local Government Code of 1991 does not contain
any express provision which categorically and expressly repeal
the charter of the Authority. It has to be conceded that there
was no intent on the part of the legislature to repeal Republic
Act No. 4850 and its amendments. The repeal of laws should
be made clear and expressed. Considering the reasons behind
the establishment of the Authority, which are environmental
protection, navigational safety, and sustainable development,
there is every indication that the legislative intent is for the
Authority to proceed with its mission.
The power of the local government units to issue fishing
privileges was clearly granted for revenue purposes. On the

Book IV-- Miscellaneous and Final Provisions

other hand, the power of the Authority to grant permits for
fishpens, fishcages and other aqua-culture structures is for
the purpose of effectively regulating and monitoring activities
in the Laguna de Bay region and for lake quality control and
management. It does partake of the nature of police power
which is the most pervasive, the least !imitable and the most
demanding of all State powers including the power of taxation.
Accordingly, the charter of the Authority which embodies a
valid exercise of police power should prevail over the Local
Government Code of 1991 on matters affecting Laguna de Bay.
Removal from the Authority of the aforesaid licensing authority
will render nugatory its avowed purpose of protecting and
developing the Laguna Lake Region.
2. There is nothing in the LGC to indicate that it has repealed
the provisions of the Ombudsman Act. Repeals by implication are
not favored.
HAGAD v. GOZO-DADOLE
251 SCRA 242, December 12, 1995, Vitug, J.

Facts: The controversy stemmed from the filing ofcriminal
and administrative complaints, on 22 July 1992, against
herein respondents Mayor Alfredo Ouano. The respondents
were charged with having violated R.A. No. 3019. Respondents
prayed for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that
the Ombudsman supposedly was bereft of jurisdiction to
try, hear and decide the Administrative Case filed against
them since, under Section 63 of the Local Government Code
of 1991, the power to investigate and impose administrative
sanctions against said local officials, as well as to effect their
preventive suspension, had now been vested with the Office of
the President.
Held: There is nothing in the Local Government
Code to indicate that it has repealed, whether expressly or
impliedly, the pertinent provisions of the Ombudsman Act.
The two statutes on the specific matter in question are not so
inconsistent, let alone irreconcilable, as to compel us to only
uphold one and strike down the other. Well-settled is the rule
that repeals of laws by implication are not favored, and that
courts must generally assume their congruent application. The
two laws must be absolutely incompatible, and a clear finding
thereof must surface, before the inference of implied repeal

may be drawn. Certainly, Congress would not have intended
to do injustice to the very reason that underlies the creation of
the Ombudsman in the 1987 Constitution which "is to insulate
said office from the long tentacles of officialdom."

While no pangkat was constituted, it is not denied that
the parties met at the office of the barangay chairman for
possible settlement. The efforts of the barangay chairman,
however, proved futile as no agreement was reached. Although
no pangkat was formed, we believe that there was substantial
compliance with the law.

3. PD. No. 1508 on the Katarungang Pambarangay has
been repealed by codification in the LGC of 1991.

SEC. 535. Separability Clause. - If, for any
reason or reasons, any part or provisions of this
Code shall be held to be unconstitutional or invalid,
other parts or provisions hereof which are not
affected thereby shall continue to be in full force
and effect.

DIUv. CA
251 SCRA 472, December 19, 1995, Regalado J.
Facts: It appears that on several occasions from January
8, 1988 up to and until April 18, 1989, private respondent
Patricia Pagba purchased on credit various articles of
merchandise from petitioners' store at Naval, Biliran, all
valued at P7,862.55. Private respondents failed to pay despite
repeated demands. Petitioners brought the matter before
the Barangay Chairman of Naval and the latter set the case
for hearing, but private respondents failed to appear. When
the case was again set for hearing, the parties appeared but
they failed to reach an amicable settlement. Accordingly,
the barangay chairman issued a Certification to File Action.
Petitioners then filed their complaint for a sum of money before
the Municipal Trial Court of Naval.
Held: It must be noted that Presidential Decree No. 1508
has been repealed by codification in the Local Government
Code of 1991 which took effect on January 1, 1992. The basic
complaint was filed by petitioners before the trial court on July
10, 1991 before the effectivity of the Local Government Code.
Nevertheless, Sections 4 and 6 of the former law have been
substantially reproduced in Sections 4 l0(b) and 412.
In the case at bar, it is admitted that the parties did have
confrontations before the Barangay Chairman although they
were sent to the pangkat as the same was not constituted.
Their meetings with said barangay chairman were not fruitful
as no amicable settlement was reached. This prompted the
issuance of the Certification to File Action.
According to private respondent, however, the above
certification is "falsified" since no pangkat was constituted.
She, therefore, insists that petitioners have not complied with
the mandatory provision of Presidential Decree No. 1508 on
compulsory arbitration. We disagree.

SEC. 536. Effectivity Clause. This Code shall
take effect on January first, nineteen hundred
ninety-two, unless otherwise provided herein,
