TITLE X
AGENCY
Chapter 1

a

NATURE, FORM, AND KINDS OF AGENCY
Art. 1868. By the contract of agency a person binds
himself to render some service or to do something in
representation or on behalf of another, with the consent or
authority of the latter.

COMMENT:
(1) Defective Definition of the Contract of Agency

The definition of AGENCY given in Art. 1868 is very
broad, and therefore, defective.
(a)

(NOTE: What the agent really does for the principal
is a JURIDICAL ACT, and not merely a material one. In
other words, while an agent may exercise discretionary
powers, the lessee of services ordinarily performs only
ministerial functions.)

i
i

i
(b)
i

I

I

As worded, the definition includes the relationship of
master and servant, of employer and employee, of lessor
and independent contractor. The servant, the employee,
and the independent contractor all render some work or
service in representation or on behalf of another.

As worded, it would seem that the agent must always
expressly represent the principal. This is not necessarily
so, for sometimes an agent does not disclose his principal;
he may even act in behalf of himself, but here the principal
would still be BOUND “when the contract involves things
BELONGING to the principal.” (Art. 1883, 2nd par., Civil
Code)
1

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1868

specifications. An agent receives a commission upon the
successful conclusion of a sale. Upon the other hand, a
broker earns his pay merely by bringing the buyer and
the seller together, even if no sale is eventually made.

(THUS, Justice J.B.L. Reyes had stated that “this

article does not draw clearly the distinction between
lease of services and agency without representation.
The laborer also does something or renders service on
behalf of another. The true essence of the distinction, it
is submitted, lies in that the agent enters or is designed
to enter judicial relations, with or without representation
of the principal.’’ [Justice Jose B.L. Reyes’ Observation
on the new Civil Code, XVI Lawyers Journal, March 31,
1951, p. 138])

Bert Osmefia and Associates
v. Court of Appeals
GR 56545, Jan. 28, 1983

(2) Other Definitions
(a)

“An agency may be defined as a contract either express
or implied upon a consideration, or a gratuitous
undertaking, by which one of the parties confides to the
other, the management of some business to be transacted
in his name or on his account, and by which that other
assumes to do the business and renders an account of it.”
(2 Am. Jur. 13)

(b)

“Agency is the relationship which results from the
manifestation of consent by one person to another that
the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control,
and consented by the other so to act.” (Restatement of the
Law of Agency, Sec. 1)

(c)

“Agency is an act which one person gives to another the
power to do something for the principal and in his name.”
(French Civil Code; Holland, Jurisprudence, 12th Ed.,

When a man designates himself as the seller in a
contract of sale (and not merely as the agent of the seller),
and he alone signs the contract, he will be regarded as the
seller with resultant liabilities as such {e.g., for damages).
Alfred Hahn v. Court of Appeals and Bayerische
Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft (BMW)
GR 113074, Jan. 22, 1997
78 SCAD 240

FACTS: As to the service centers and showrooms
which he said he had put up at his own expense, petitioner
Hahn said that he had to follow BMW specifications as
exclusive dealer of BMW in the Philippines. According to
Hahn, BMW periodically inspected the service to see to it
that BMW standards were maintained. Indeed, it would
seem from BMW’s letter to Hahn that it was for Hahn’s
alleged failure to maintain BMW standards that BMW
was terminating Hahn’s dealership.

HELD: The fact that Hahn invested his own money
to put up these service centers and showrooms does not
necessarily prove that he is not an agent of BMW. For
as noted, there are facts in the record which suggest
that BMW exercised control over Hahn’s activities
as a dealer and made regular inspections of Hahn’s
premises to enforce compliance with BMW standards and

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

302-303)

(3) Roman Law

In Roman Law, there was the contract of mandatum
where one person called mandans authorized another called
the mandatarius to do something for him This originated from
the obligation or right of a son or a slave to represent the pater
familias. (Holland, Jurisprudence, pp. 302-303)
(NOTE: In Spanish, the principal is called mandante,
while the agent is referred to as the mandatario. The contract
itself is a mandato.)
(4) Importance of Agency

It enables a man to increase the range of his individual
and corporate activity by enabling him to be constructively
present in many places and to carry on diverse activities at the
same time. (Mechem, Outlines of Agency, 3rd Ed., p. 5)

40 Phil. 471

Smith, Bell & Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals
GR 110668, Feb. 6, 1907
79 SCAD 38

FACTS: W.G. Philpotts, a stockholder of the
Philippine Manufacturing Co., wanted to inspect the
corporate books through his agent, but the Company
refused, stating that this right to inspect the books was
purely personal, and could not be exercised through an
agent. Philpotts petitions for a writ of mandamus to
compel the PMC to show its books to his agent.

Every cause of action ex contractu must be founded
upon a contract, oral or written; either express or implied.
The only involvement of petitioner in the subject contract of
insurance was having its name stamped at the bottom left
portion of the policy as “Claim Agent.” Without anything
else to back it up, such stamp cannot even be deemed by the
remotest interpretation to mean that petitioner participated
in the preparation of said contract. Hence, there is no privity
of contract, and correspondingly there can be no obligation
or liability, and, thus, no cause of action against petitioner

HELD: Mandamus can be issued, for the inspection
can be done through an agent. This is in conformity with
the general rule that what a man may do in person, he
may do through another. Nothing in the Corporation Law
is contrary to this general rule.

attaches.
The Insurance Code is quite clear as to the purpose and
role of a resident agent. Such agent, as a representative of
the foreign insurance company, is tasked only to receive legal
processes on behalf of its principal and not to answer personally

(NOTE: Some acts cannot, however, be made
through an agent. An example is the making of a will,
since this is considered a strictly personal act under the

for any insurance claims.

law.)

(5) History

(7) Parties to the Contract

Formerly, there was a difference between a commercial
agency or commission on the one hand, and a civil agency on
the other. A commercial agency was entered into for commercial
purposes; the civil agency, for other objectives.
Today, however, there is no more commercial agency or
commission in view of the repeal by the new Civil Code of the
Code of Commerce provisions thereon. (Art. 2270) Therefore,
today, whether the agency be for a civil or a commercial
purpose, it is now called a civil agency, and is governed by the
Civil Code.

The two parties to the contract are the principal and the
agent.

Definitions:
(a)
,

(b)

Principal — he whom the agent represents and from
whom he derives authority; he is the one primarily
concerned in the contract. (Sec. 3, 2 C.J. 420)

—

Agent
he who acts or stands for another. Usually, he
is given full or partial discretion, but sometimes he acts
under a specific command. (Bishop on Contracts, Sec.
1027)

(6) Characteristics

Agency is a principal, nominate, bilateral, preparatory,
commutative, and generally onerous contract.
(b) Generally, it is also a representative relation, not a status
since agency is not inherent or permanent.
(c) It is a fiduciary relation since it is based on trust and
confidence. (See Severino v. Severino, 44 Phil. 343)
(a)

4

(NOTE: He, therefore, acts in another's name. If

he acts under another name, that is, if he pretends to be
someone else, he is not an agent, for here he certainly acts
in his own name.)
(NOTE: An agent may have his own agent, who is
thus referred to as sub-agent.)

6

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

18fl8

Gelano v. Court of Appeals
L-39050, Feb. 24, 1981
103 Phil. 90
The word “trustee” as used in the corporation
statute must be understood in the general concept, and
may include the attorney prosecuting the case filed by the
corporation.
(8) Capacity of the Principal

In genera], if he is capacitated to act for himself, he can
act through an agent. He must, therefore, be capacitated
to give consent. (2 C.J. 429-430) If any special capacity is
needed, it is he who must possess it and not the agent, for
the latter merely acts in his behalf.
(b) The principal may be natural or a juridical person. (As
a matter of fact, a private corporation and a partnership
ran only act through agents.) (Mechem, p. 33)
(a)

(c)

(d)

(NOTE: A social club or any other organization
cannot act as a principal if it has no juridical personality.
Individual members thereof can be bound only if an
express or implied agency has been consented to by each
of them.)
Generally, an emancipated minor can be a principal. So,
may a married woman. As a matter of fact, the husband
may appoint her as agent or administrator of his capital or
of the conjugal partnership. Similarly, a married woman
may appoint her husband as an agent of her paraphernal
property.

A husband, as administrator of the conjugal partnership

(Art. 165, Civil Code) is in that sense an agent who can

bind conjugal property, subject to legal restrictions,
such as those imposed by Art. 166, Civil Code. Thus, a
conveyance of conjugal real property without the needed
consent of the wife is VOIDABLE, and the wife is given
ten years within which to bring an action for annulment.
(Rodolfo Lanuza v. Martin de Leon, L-22331, June 6,
1967) Ratification may of course be made by the wife.

Art. 1868

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(9) Capacity of an Agent

His capacity is, in general, the same as in the law of
contracts, that is, he must be able to bind himself, but only
insofar as his obligations to his principal are concerned. Insofar
as third persons are concerned, however, it is enough that his
principal be the one capacitated, for generally an agent assumes
no personal liability. Usually, therefore, the contract with a
stranger is valid, even if the agent be a minor so long as his
principal is capacitated. However, as between them (principal
and agent), the minor-agent can set up his incapacity, provided
he is not in estoppel.

Mendoza v. De Guzman
33 O.G. 1505

FACTS: P appoints A, a minor, as his agent to sell certain
goods. A sells the goods to a buyer B. P, afterwards, seeks to
disaffirm the sale, and brings an action to recover the goods
on the ground that A’s act was void, as an infant cannot be an
agent. Judgment for whom and why?

HELD: Judgment should be for the buyer B and against
the principal P. The agent A is deemed to be an extension of
the personality of the principal, who himself is of legal age.
Hence, P cannot avoid the contract on the ground of the agent’s
incapacity.

Gelano v. Court of Appeals
L-39050, Feb. 24, 1981
A lawyer who has been defending the interests of a
corporation may, in the case of a litigation in court still pending

after the expiration of the three-year period after dissolution,
still continue as TRUSTEE of the corporation at least with
respect to the matter in litigation. This would be in substantial
compliance with the law which allows the conveyance of the
properties of a corporation to a trustee to enable it to prosecute
and defend suits by or against the corporation beyond the
three-year period.

was also authorized to get profits as a result of whatever
improvements may be introduced. One day, the son
purchased certain materials which he needed for the

constitute his son his agent. The relationship between

lessor and lessee, not that of principal and agent.

in the name of the
principal.

Art. 1868

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

FACTS: Quiroga granted Parsons (in the Visayas)
exclusive right to sell “Quiroga” bed in the Visayas.
Quiroga was to furnish beds to Parsons, and would
demand the price sixty days from shipment, minus a
commission or deduction of 25%. Parsons agreed not to
sell any other kind of bed, and to pay the price as agreed
upon.

ISSUE: Is this a contract of agency to sell, or a
contract of sale?

HELD: This is a contract of SALE. In order to classify
contract,
a
due regard must be given to its essential
clauses. In the contract in question, what was essential,
as constituting its cause and subject matter, is that
Quiroga was to furnish the Parsons with the beds, which
the latter might order at the price stipulated. The price
agreed upon was the one determined by Quiroga with a
certain discount. Payment was to be made at the end of
sixty days. These are precisely the essential features of a
contract of purchase and sale. There was the obligation
on the part of Quiroga to supply the beds, and on the part
of Parsons to pay their price. These features exclude the
legal conception of an agency or order to sell whereby the
mandatory or agent received the thing to sell it, but does
not pay its price. Instead, he is supposed to deliver to the
principal the price he obtains from the sale of the thing to
a third person, and if he does not succeed in selling it, he

returns it. By virtue of the contract between Quiroga and
Parsons, the latter, on receiving the beds, was necessarily
obliged to pay their price within the term fixed, without
any other consideration, and regardless as to whether he
had or had not sold the beds.

Gonzalo Puyat and Sons, Inc. v. Arco
Amusement Co.
72 Phil. 402

FACTS: Gonzalo Puyat and Sons was the exclusive
agent of an American Piano Company, the Starr Piano
Company of Richmond, Indiana, U.S.A. The Arco
Amusement entered into a contract with Puyat and Sons,
whereby the latter would order, on behalf of the Arco
Amusement Company, certain sound equipment. It was
also agreed that the company would pay Puyat and Sons
a 10% commission, plus all expenses.
Puyat and Sons cabled the U.S. company for the
price without discount. The price given was Pl,700.
Puyat and Sons, with the approval of the Amusement
Company, placed the order when it came. Puyat and
16

Art. 1868

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Sons received Pl,700 from the company plus 10%. Puyat
and Sons, however, did NOT reveal to the Amusement
Company that the former was always given a DISCOUNT
by the U.S. Company. When the amusement Company
discovered that the Pl,700 was only the list price, and not
the net price, it sued Puyat and Sons for reimbursement
of the difference, on the ground that the latter was only
its AGENT in obtaining the equipment. Puyat and Sons
however countered that the contract was not an agency to
buy, but was one of sale.

ISSUE: Is the contract between them a sale, or an
agency to buy?
HELD: The contract between them is a SALE, and
not an agency to buy; therefore, Puyat and Sons will not
be required to reimburse the difference. It is clear from
the facts that had there been a change of price upwards
or a mistake, Puyat and Sons would have been required to
give the equipment to the Arco Amusement Co. at only the
agreed amount of Pl,700 plus 10%. It follows, therefore,
that Puyat and Sons could not have been an agent of
the Amusement Company, for a true agent is entitled
to indemnity for damages incurred in carrying out the
agency without fault, that Puyat and Sons was to receive
a 10% commission, this does not necessarily make it an
agent of the Amusement Company. The provision only
meant that the Amusement Company bound itself to pay
an additional price. This stipulation is not incompatible
with the contract of purchase and sale.

Moreover, since it is an admitted fact that Puyat
and Sons was the agent of the U.S. Company, it is out of
the ordinary for it to be also the agent of the Amusement
Company. Seldom is the seller also the agent of the buyer.
{NOTE: A similar ruling was made in a WHISKY

transaction in Velasco v. Universal Trading Co., Inc., 45

O.G. 4504.)

(11) ‘Agent’ and ‘Broker’ Distinguished

Manuel B. Tan, Gregg M. Tecson and Alexander
Saldana v. Eduardo R. Gullas and Norma S. Gullas
GR 143978, Dec. 3, 2002
An agent receives a commission upon the successful
conclusion of a sale. Upon the other hand, a broker earns his
pay merely by bringing the buyer and the seller together, even
if no sale is eventually made. (Alfred Hann v. CA & Bayerische
Motorer Worke Aktiengesellschaft [BMW], 266 SCRA 537

.

Advance Paper Corp. v. Arma
Traders Corp.
712 SCRA 313
I

A broker is “one who is engaged, for others, on a
commission, negotiating contracts relative to property with
the custody of which he has no concern; the negotiator between
other parties, never acting in his own name but in the name of
those who employed him. A broker is one whose occupation is
to bring the parties together, in matters of trade, commerce, or
navigation.” (Schmid & Oberly v. RJL Martinez Fishing Corp.,
166 SCRA 493 [1988])

ISSUE: In the absence of a corporate charter or by
law provision is a company president presumed to have the
authority to act with the domain of the general objectives of its
business and within the scope of his/her authority?
HELD: Yes. The doctrine of apparent authority provides
that a corporation will be stopped from denying the agent’s
authority if it knowingly permits one of its officers or any other
agent to act within the scope of an apparent authority, and it
holds him out to the public as possessing the power to do those
acts.

(15) ‘Assumed Agency*

Persons dealing with an “assumed agency” whether the
assumed agency be a general or special one, are bound to their
moral, if they would hold the principal liable, to ascertain
out only the fact of agency, but also the nature and extent of
authority, and in case either is controverted the burden of proof
is upon them to establish it. (Recio v. Ateris ofSps. Aguedo &

Republic Gas Corp. v. Petron Corp.
698 SCRA 666

The existence of the corporate entity does not shield
from prosecution the corporate agent who knowingly and
intentionally caused the corporation to commit a crime.
Thus, petitioners in the case at bar, cannot hide behind
the back of the separate corporate personality of the corporation
to escape criminal liability.

or showrooms, and to enable the traders to facilitate sales
on-the-spot, as-is-where-is, without having to inconvenience
the owners with random viewing and inspections of their

vehicles.
For this kind of arrangement, an agency relationship is
created between the vehicle owners, as principals, and the
car traders, as agents.
Art. 1869. Agency may be express, or implied from the
acts of the principal, from his silence or lack of action, or
his failure to repudiate the agency, knowing that another
person is acting on his behalf without authority.
Agency may be oral, unless the law requires a specific
form.

appoint a new agent. Moreover, he remained silent for
nine years, all the while allowing Antonio to administer
the property.

ISSUE: Was Antonio the agent of De la Pefia?
HELD: Yes. From the facts given, this is a clear case
of an implied agency. In permitting Antonio to administer,
De la Pefia created in Antonio’s favor an implied agency.
(NOTE: In Gutierrez Hermanos v. Orense, 28 Phil.
571, it was held that if an owner of land testifies that he
consented to its sale by a hitherto unauthorized person,
such person becomes his agent. The principal now has the
duty of fulfilling the obligations contracted by the agent
in pursuit of such agency.)

the same, he is responsible for the agent’s acts, the latter
having become his agent for that purpose.)

FACTS: The properties of De la Pefta were being

reasons of health, informed De la Pefia that he (Federico)
was turning over the administration to Antonio Hidalgo.
Federico also informed his principal that he had conferred

that in case this would not be sufficient, De la Pena could

A good instance of implied acceptance in No. (1) would
be when the offeree writes a letter acknowledging the receipt
of the offer, but offers no objection to the agency. If he does
not write such a letter, it may be because he simply wants to
ignore the offer, or he may have forgotten about it, or he is
still undecided; hence, in this latter case, it would be unfair to
presume acceptance.
Another instance of implied acceptance is when the silent
offeree begins to act under the authority conferred upon him.
(George v. Sandel, 18 La. Ann. 535) Indeed, acceptance can be
implied from acts which carry out the agency. (Art. 1870)

his silence or inaction according to the circumstances.

ISSUE: Did C act as A’s agent?

be inferred from his acts.

COMMENT:
Another Form of Implied Agency

—

Note that, here, the persons are “present"
meaning
“face to face,” or conversing with each other through mobile
cellphone.
Art. 1872. Between persons who are absent, the
acceptance of the agency cannot be implied from the silence
of the agent except:

Art. 1873. If a person specifically informs another or
states by public advertisement that he has given a power
of attorney to a third person, the latter thereby becomes a
duly authorized agent, in the former case with respect to
the person who received the special information, and in the
latter case with regard to any person.

(1) When the principal transmits his power of attorney
to the agent, who receives it without any objection;

(2)

When the principal entrusts to him by letter or
telegram a power of attorney with respect to the business in
which he is habitually engaged as an agent, and he did not
reply to the letter or telegram.

COMMENT:
Rules if the Parties are “Absent* (Not “Present”)
In No. (1) as distinguished from No. (2), just because the
offeree did not reply does not mean that the agency has been
accepted. For if this would be equivalent to implied acceptance,
there would be no difference between No. (1) and No. (2).

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1873

In an agency by estoppel (caused for instance by
estoppel on the part of the agent), the “agent” is not
a true agent; hence he has no rights as such. (See 2
C.J. 444-445)
t

(b) As to third persons:
1)
If the estoppel is caused by the principal, he is
liable, but only if the third person acted on the
misrepresentation; in an implied agency, the
'■
principal is always liable. (See 2 C.J. 444-445)
2)
If the estoppel is caused by the agent, it is only the
agent who is liable, never the alleged principal; in an
implied agency, the agent is never personally liable.

(2) Comment of Justice J.B.L. Reyes

2)

To forestall fraud, the following paragraph must be added
to Art. 1873.
“But, revocation made in any manner shall be effective
against all persons having actual knowledge thereof.” (Obser¬
vations on the new Civil Code, 16 Lawyer’s Journal, p. 138)

t

(3) Problem

A company wrote a circular letter to its customers
introducing a certain X as its duly authorized agent. One
customer then dealt with the company through X. One day,
Xs authority was revoked, but the customer continued to deal
through X since it never was informed by circular or otherwise
of the revocation.
ISSUE: Is the Company still liable for %’s acts even after
the revocation of the agency?
ANS.: Yes, for the customer was in good faith, not having
been informed by circular or otherwise, of the revocation. ( See
Compania Gen. de Tabacos v. Diaba, 20 Phil. 321 and Rallos v.
Yangco, 20 Phil. 269)

Thus, our Supreme Court in Macke, et al. v. Camps, 7
Phil. 553, has said: “One who clothes another with apparent
authority as his agent, and holds him out to the public as such,
cannot be permitted to deny the authority of such person to act
as his agent, to the prejudice of innocent third parties dealing
with such person in good faith, and in the honest belief that he
is what he appears to be.”
(5) Agency by Estoppel Distinguished from Implied Agency
(a)

As between the principal and the agent:
1)

In an implied agency, the agent is a true agent, with
rights and duties of an agent.

Art. 1874. When a sale of a piece of land or any interest
therein is through an agent, the authority of the latter shall
be in writing; otherwise, the sale shall be void.

COMMENT:
(1) Agency to Sell Land or Any Interest Therein

(4) Agency by Estoppel

If A leads B to believe that C is his (A’s) agent, when
as a matter of fact such is not true, and B acts on such
misrepresentation, A cannot disclaim liability, for he has
created an agency by estoppel.

Art. 1874

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

I

Note that this refers to the sale of a “piece of land or any
interest therein.” “Any interest therein” includes usufruct,
easement, etc. Does it also include “buildings”? Strictly
speaking it does not, but if this would be the construction, it
would follow that in an agency to sell a building, it does not
have to be in writing. Could this have been the intent of the
Code Commission?
(2) Effect if the Article is Violated

'

Note also that if Art. 1874 is violated, the sale is VOID,
not merely unenforceable. Therefore, the principal cannot
technically RATIFY. If he does so, there should be no retroactive
effect.

Rosario S. Juat, et al. v. Land Tenure
Administration
L-17080, Jan. 28, 1961

Under Com. Act 539, the President is authorized to
acquire private lands and thereafter subdivide the same into
small lots for resale at reasonable prices to their bona fide
tenants or occupants. The act of the Secretary of Agriculture
and Natural Resources in making the sale has the same effect
as if done by the President himself by virtue of the legal truism
that the acts of a department secretary are presumed to be the
acts of the Chief Executive. (See Villena v. Sec. of Interior, 67
Phil. 461 and Donnelly v. Agregado, L-4510, May 31, 1954)
Art. 1875. Agency is presumed to be for a compensation,
unless there is proof to the contrary.

COMMENT:

Art. 1875

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

FACTS: Fiege and Brown acted as the agents of Smith,
Bell and Co., for the sale of machinery. It was agreed that the
agents were to receive one-half of the profits derived from the
sale of the machines. They were able to sell the goods, and
as soon as the customers’ contracts were signed, the agents
demanded their 50% fee, although the buyers had not yet paid
for the machines.

ISSUE: Were they entitled to their share as soon as the
properties were sold?

HELD: No, because the machines had not yet been paid
for. Said the court: “Until such time as the company made a
profit on a given contract, plaintiff’s commission was not earned
as to that contract. There was no profit through the mere
signing of the contract by the purchaser and its acceptance by
the company. There would not be any profit until the purchaser
paid all the money and complied with his contract. Until such
time as the company realized a profit on the contract, there
was nothing to share or divide.”

(1) Agency is Presumed to be Onerous

Under the old Civil Code (Art. 1711), agency was presumed
to be gratuitous. In the present Code, agency is presumed to be
for a compensation.
(2) Form of Compensation

Compensation may be in the form of gratuitous use by
the agent of the principal’s real estate. (Acuna v. Larena, 57
Phil. 630) In the absence of stipulation, the agent is entitled
to compensation only after he has completely or substantially
completed his obligation as agent. (Arts. 1233, 1234) The
compensation may be contingent or dependent upon the
realization of profit for the principal. This is so in case there is
a stipulation to this effect.

26

(3) Brokers

A broker is one who in behalf of others, and for a commission
or fee, negotiates contracts relative to property (with the
custody of which he has no concern). He is the negotiator
between parties, never acting in his own name, but in the
name of those who employ him; he is strictly a middleman, and
for some purposes, the agent of both parties. Indeed, he is one
whose occupation is to bring parties together to bargain, or to
bargain for them in matters of trade, commerce, or navigation.
(Behn, Meyer and Co., Ltd. v. Nolting and Garcia, 35 Phil. 274
[1916])

Although a broker is an agent, he is distinguishable from
an agent generally by reason of the fact that his authority is of
a special and limited character in most respects. As to physical
activities, he is an independent contractor. (8 Am. Jur. 991)

(4) Compensation of Brokers

Since his only job is to bring together the parties to
a transaction (Pac. Com. Co. v. Yatco, 68 Phil. 398), it
follows that if the broker does not succeed in bringing the
mind of the purchaser and the vendor to an agreement
with reference to the terms of a sale, he is not entitled to
a commission. (Rocha v. Prats and Co., 43 Phil. 397)
(b) The doctrine stated above is true even if the sale can later
on be effected between buyer and seller, BUT, through
a DIFFERENT broker. The first broker can be called
UNSUCCESSFUL even if it was he who first interested
the purchaser in the sale, negotiated with him, and even
indirectly influenced him to come to terms. The fact
remains that he did not succeed in bringing about the
sale. It was the second broker that accomplished the sale.
(Quijano v. Esguerra, et al., 40 O.G. [11th SJ p. 166) Even
if no subsequent broker had intervened, still if authority
of the first broker had already been withdrawn prior to
the sale, such broker is not entitled to any fee. (See Reyes,
et al. v. Mosqueda, et al., 53 O.G. 2158, L-8669, May 25,
(a)

1956)
(c)

(d)

So long as the sale is pushed through, the broker is entitled
to a commission, even if the sale had been temporarily
delayed due to the principal’s lack of tact. The important
thing is that the sale really eventually was entered into.
(Ysmael and Co., Inc. v. William Lines, Inc., L-9614, May
12, 1952) Indeed, a broker should not be made to suffer
for the consequences of the principal’s lack of tact in
handling a delicate situation. (Ibid.)

A broker, however, is not entitled to recover his expenses
during the negotiations for the sale, such expenses having
been incurred at his own risk, and in consideration of the
commission agreed upon. (Ysmael and Co., Inc. v. William
Lines, Inc., L-9614, May 12, 1952)

Reyes, et al. v. Mosqueda and the Court
of Appeals
L-8699, May 25, 1956, 53 O.G. 2158

FACTS: Mosqueda authorized a certain Mrs. Reyes
to sell his land for P7.50 a square meter, promising to
28

(

give her a 5% commission. Reyes found a buyer (Lim) who
wanted to pay only P7.30 per square meter, but Mosqueda
refused to sell at this price. He then wanted to withdraw
the authority, but Reyes asked for one more day to find
another buyer. This request was granted, but when Reyes
failed to find another buyer the next day, Mosqueda
informed her that he was cancelling her authority to
look for a buyer. Subsequently, Lim contacted Mosqueda
personally, and the two were able to agree on the sale.
When Reyes learned of this, she asked Mosqueda for her
5% commission, on the ground that the sale had been
perfected through her efforts. Mosqueda refused to pay.
Hence, this action was instituted by Reyes.

HELD: Reyes is not entitled to any commission,
the
actual sale was made without her intervention.
for
Furthermore, her authority to sell had already been
withdrawn prior to the sale. It is true that there are times
when the principal cannot revoke the authority given to
a broker, as when the negotiations through the broker’s
efforts have reached such a stage that it would be unfair to
deny the commission earned. This is especially true when
the property owner acts in bad faith, and revokes the
authority only to evade the payment of the commission.
In this case, however, Mosqueda did not act in bad faith
in cancelling the authority to Reyes.
(NOTE: If the principal breaks off from negotiations
with a buyer brought by the agent in order to deliberately
deal later with the buyer personally, this is evident bad
faith. In such a case, justice demands compensation for
the agent. [See Infante v. Cunanan, et al., 93 Phil. 691
and Perez de Tagle v. Luzon Surety Co., C.A., 38 O.G.
1213])

Perez de Tagle v. Luzon Surety Co.
(C.A.) 38 O.G. 1213
FACTS: The Luzon Surety Co. wanted to sell in
Ermita, Manila, a house and lot for P15,000. Tagle, a
licensed real estate broker, asked the Company if it was
willing to pay a commission of 5%. The Company suggested
that Tagle first find a buyer, and then make an offer stating
his (Tagle’s) fees. Tagle found a prospective buyer, one

Rodriquez. Rodriquez signed a letter prepared by Tagle,
offering to pay P14,000. Tagle delivered this offer to the
Company and asked for a 5% commission. The Company
then promised to take up the matter with its Board of
Directors. Finally, Tagle was informed that the buyer’s
offer was REJECTED by the Company. Subsequently,
however, Tagle discovered that the Company had dealt

with Rodriquez personally, and had accepted the latter’s
offer (with the same terms and conditions as those made
through Tagle). Tagle wanted to get his commission, but
the Company refused. Hence, this action was brought.

*

Art. 1877. An agency couched in general terms comprises
only acts of administration, even if the principal should
state that he withholds no power or that the agent may
execute such acts as he may consider appropriate, or even
though the agency should authorize a general and unlimited
management.

HELD: Tagle is entitled to the 5% usual commission,
which incidentally is the amount he has demanded for his
services. It is evident under the facts that Tagle’s service
were taken advantage of by the Company, and it cannot
now justly refuse to compensate him.
{NOTE: The court cited the rule that “a broker is
entitled to a commission on a sale effected by the owner
to the person produced by the broker after the breaking of
the original negotiations, if the breaking up was a mere
subterfuge, and the sale was in fact brought about by
what the broker had done.”)
{NOTE, HOWEVER, that “where the person
introduced by the broker is not able, ready, and willing
to buy on the terms prescribed by the owner, the broker
is not entitled to compensation on a sale subsequently
made on those terms by the principal to the same person
through another broker.” [Quijano v. Esguerra, 40 O.G.

COMMENT:
According to Justice J.B.L. Reyes, the acts referred to in
this Article can be reduced to three:
(a) acts of strict dominion or ownership (as distinguished
from acts of mere administration)
(b) gratuitous contracts
(c)

contracts where personal trust or confidence is of the
essence of the agreement. (J.B.L. Reyes, Observations on
the new Civil Code, 16 L.J. 138)

PNB v. Court of Appeals
70 SCAD 37
(1996)

Where payment has been made to an agent, aside
from proving the existence of a Special Power of Attorney,
it is also necessary for evidence to be presented regarding
the nature and extent of the alleged powers and authority
granted to the agent.
34

This refers to a clear mandate (express or implied)
specifically authorizing the performance of the act, and must
therefore be distinguished from an agency couched in general
terms. (See Strong v. Repide, 6 Phil. 680) A general power of
attorney may however include a special power if such special
power is mentioned or referred to in the general power, e.g., “I
authorize you to sell ALL my properties.” (This does not need
a special power to sell for each property involved, since such
special power has already been given.)
(NOTE: In general, the execution of a power of attorney
does not need the intervention of any notary public. [Barretto

(4) Re Paragraph 1

Note that if the payment is usually considered an act
of administration, no special power of attorney is needed. It
should be noted, however, that some acts of administration
carry with them the exercise of acts of dominion, e.g., the sale
by an administrator of fertile land or the products of the land.

Dominion Insurance Corp. v.
Court of Appeals, Rodolfo S. Guevarra
and Fernando Austria
GR 129919, Feb. 6, 2002

FACTS: The instruction of petitioner as principal could
not be any clearer. Respondent Guevarra was authorized to
pay the claim of the insured, but payment shall come from the
revolving fund or collection in his possession.
ISSUE: Is the payment of claims an act of administration?
35

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1878

HELD: No. The settlement of claims is not included
among the acts enumerated in the Special Power of Attorney
(SPA) under Art. 1878; neither is it of a character similar to
acts enumerated therein. Under said Art. 1878, special power
of attorney are necessary in the following cases including, inter
alia: to make such payments as are not usually considered as
acts of administration, or any other act of strict dominion.
An SPA is required before respondent Guevarra could
settle the insurance claims of the insured. Guevarra’s authority
to settle claims is embodied in the Memorandum of Management
Agreement dated Feb. 18, 1987 which enumerates the scope of
Guevarra’s duties and responsibilities as agency manager for

San Fernando, Pampanga. In settling the claims, respondent
Guevarra’s authority is limited by the written standard
authority to pay, which provides that payment shall come from
respondent Guevarra’s revolving fund or collection.
By the contract of agency, a person binds himself to
render some service or to do something in representation
or on behalf of another, with the consent or authority of the
latter. (Art. 1869) The basis for agency is representation.
(Bordador v. Luz, 347 SCRA 154 [1997]) On the part of the
principal, there must be an actual intention to appoint or an
intention naturally inferable from his words or actions. On
the part of the agent, there must be an intention to accept the
appointment and act on it, and in the absence of such intent,
there is generally no agency. (Victorias Milling Co., Inc. v. CA,
333 SCRA 663 [2000]) A perusal of the SPA would show that
petitioner (represented by third-party defendant [Austria] and
respondent by Guevarra intended to enter into a principalagent relationship. Despite the word “special” in the title of the
document, the contents reveal that what was constituted was
actually a general agency.)
Agency comprises all the business of the principal (Art.
1876), but, couched in general terms, it is limited only to acts of
administrations. (Art. 1877) A general power permits the agent
to do all acts for which the law does not require a special power.
Thus, the acts enumerated in the Special Power of Attorney
cited in the case at bar, do not require an SPA. As already
alluded to, Art. 1878 enumerates the instances when an SPA
is required.

B.H. Macke, et al. v. Camps

FACTS: Camps, the owner of the Washington Cafe,
left Mr. Flores in charge as managing agent of the Cafe. As
manager, Flores purchased goods for the Cafe from Macke, et

HELD: Yes. Flores, as managing agent of the Washington
Cafe, had authority to buy such reasonable quantities of
supplies as might from time to time be necessary in carrying
on the business of the Cafe.
Scope of Authority to Purchase:

Where an agent’s power to purchase is general and
unrestricted, he has implied authority to do whatever is usual
and necessary in the exercise of such power. He may determine
the usual find necessary details of the contract, agree upon
the price, modify or rescind the contract of purchase, accept
delivery for his principal, give directions for the delivery of the
property purchased, and may borrow money to pay for the care

and preservation of the property purchased (Art. 1878, par . 7);
but he has NO special power to settle a contest between his
principal and a third person as to the ownership of the goods
purchased, or to agree to an account stated, or to do anything
not usual and necessary to the exercise of such authority.

(14) Re Paragraph 11

Director of Public Works v. Sing Jaco, et al.
53 Phil. 205

FACTS: Tan Ong Sze gave a power of attorney to Mariano
de la Rama to sell or to lease her property and generally “to
perform and execute all and every lawful and reasonable act
as fully and effectually as I might or could do if personally
present.” With the authorization, Rama signed in behalf of
his principal a security bond in favor of the government in
connection with the purchase of certain materials dredged
from a fish pond. When the buyer failed to pay, suit was
instituted against Tan Ong Sze on the strength of the contract
of suretyship (security bond). Tan contended that she was NOT
bound by such contract.

Where the agency is a special one, or is restricted to
purchases upon certain terms and conditions, the agent has no
authority to purchase upon different terms and conditions from
those authorized or to modify or rescind a contract of purchase
made by the principal. (2 C.J. 588-590)
(9) Re Paragraph 6

The making of customary gifts is considered here as an
act of administration only.

Note that the exception here refers to the latter act,
namely, “borrow,” not “loan.”

L-32116, April 21, 1981

For a person to be able to borrow money in behalf of
another, the latter must give him a special power of attorney.

regarded as having been made through an agent.

Note here that the lease of real property is referred to,
and not the lease of personal property. Note also that if the
lease of the real property is for one year or less, the act is one
of mere administration.

Reason: The principal has to personally have trust and
confidence in the proposed partners.

HELD: Tan is NOT bound, for the power of attorney given
De la Rama did not authorize him to create an obligation in
the nature of surety binding on his principal. The power to
execute a contract of so exceptional a nature as a contract of
suretyship or guaranty cannot be inferred from the general
words contained in Rama’s power of attorney.

47 Phil. 594
FACTS: A businesswoman authorized her husband to
“loan or borrow any sum of money or fungible things at the rate
of interest and for the time and under the conditions which
he might deem convenient.” Later the husband mortgaged his
wife’s property as security for HIS own personal debt. Was he
authorized to do so?

HELD: No, for it is evident from the face of the instrument
that the whole purpose of the power of attorney was to
authorize the husband to look after the interest of his wife and
the business, and not for his own interest.

GR 143978, Dec. 3, 2002

FACTS: Following the stipulation in the Special Power
of Attorney, petitioners contend that they are entitled to a 3%
commission for the sale of the land in question. Petitioners
maintain that their commission should be based on the price at
which the land was offered for sale, i.e., P530 per square meter.
ISSUE: How much commission are petitioners entitled

to?

HELD: The actual purchase price for which the land was
sold was only P200 per sq.m. Therefore, equity be based on this
price. To rule otherwise would constitute unjust enrichment on
the part of the petitioners as brokers.

Petitioners, as brokers, should be entitled to the
commission whether or not the sale of the property subject

Ordinarily, the mortgage can be made only on the
present property of the principal, and not on hereafter
acquired property (acquired after the execution of the
power of attorney) but the contrary can be stipulated upon.
It is essential, however, that at the time of the execution
of the mortgage itself, the principal must already be the
owner; otherwise, the mortgage is VOID. (Art. 2085 and

(3) Jurisprudence

Bicol Savings and Loan Association
v. Court of Appeals, et al.
GR 85302, March 31, 1989
,

The pivotal issue is the validity of the extrajudicial
foreclosure sale of the mortgaged property instituted by
petitioner bank which, in turn, hinges on whether or not the
agent-son exceeded the scope of his authority in agreeing to
a stipulation in the mortgage deed that petitioner bank could
extrajudicially foreclose the mortgaged property.

The sale proscribed by a special power to mortgage under
Art. 1879 is a voluntary and independent contract, and not an
auction sale resulting from extrajudicial foreclosure, which
is precipitated by the default of a mortgagor. Absent that
default, no foreclosure results. The stipulation granting an
authority to extrajudicially foreclose a mortgage is an ancillary
stipulation supported by the same cause or consideration for
the mortgage and forms an essential or inseparable part of that
bilateral agreement. The power to foreclose is not an ordinary
agency that contemplates exclusively the representation of the
43

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

principal by the agent but is primarily an authority conferred
upon the mortgagee for the latter’s own protection. That power
survives the death of the mortgagor. In fact, the right of the
mortgagee bank to extrajudicially foreclose the mortgage after
the death of the mortgagor, acting through his attomey-in-fact,
did not depend on the authorization in the deed of mortgage
executed by the latter.
The right existed independently of said stipulation and is
clearly recognized in Sec. 7 , Rule 86 of the Rules of Court, which
grants to a mortgagee three remedies that can be alternatively
pursued in case the mortgagor dies, to wit: (1) to waive the
mortgage and claim the entire debt from the estate of the
mortgagor as an ordinary claim; (2) to foreclose the mortgage
judicially and prove any deficiency as an ordinary claim; and
(3) to rely on the mortgage exclusively, foreclosing the same at
any time before it is barred by prescription, without right to
file a claim for any deficiency. It matters not that the authority
to extrajudicially foreclose was granted by an attorney-infact and not by the mortgagor personally. The stipulation
in that regard, although ancillary, forms an essential part
of the mortgage contract and is inseparable therefrom. No
creditor will agree to enter into a mortgage contract without
that stipulation intended for its protection. Petitioner bank,
therefore, in effecting the extrajudicial foreclosure of the
mortgaged property, merely availed of a right conferred by law.
The auction sale that followed in the wake of that foreclosure
was but a consequence thereof.

(2) Reason for the Article

Art 1880

t'

Art. 1880. A special power to compromise does not
authorize submission to arbitration.

COMMENT:
(1) Special Power to Compromise

An agent authorized to compromise can do anything which
the principal himself can do to effect a settlement (See 2
C.J. 652-653) unless there is a contrary legal provision, as
in this Article.
(b) A special power to submit to arbitration does not authorize
the power to compromise. This is the logical inference
that can be made from Art. 1880.
(a)

44

Art. 1881

Reason why a special power to compromise does not
authorize submission to arbitration.
A principal may authorize his agent to compromise
because of absolute confidence in the latter’s judgment and
discretion to protect the former’s rights and obtain for him the
best bargain in the transaction. If the transaction would be left
in the hands of an arbitrator, said arbitrator may not enjoy the
trust of the principal. A fundamental principle of agency shall
have been violated, namely, that an agent must possess the
trust and confidence of the principal. (See 11 Manresa 471)
(3) Special Power to Submit to Arbitration

When an agent is specifically empowered to submit a
matter to arbitration, the arbitral award binds the principal,
provided the agent acted within the scope of his authority.
In the case of Cox v. Fay, 54 Vt. 446, it was held that if the
principal had specifically designated who the arbitrators should
be, the agent has no authority to submit the question to other
arbitrators. However, when no designation had been made by
the principal and on the contrary, the agent was authorized
to submit the controversy to ANYONE, it was held that the
agent could agree to an arrangement for the appointment of
ADDITIONAL arbitrators; moreover, it would be permissible
for the agent to agree that an award could be validly made by
LESS than the FULL number of the arbitrators selected. (See
Security Livestock Ins. Ass’n. v. Brigg, 22 III. A. 107)

Art. 1881. The agent must act within the scope of his
authority. He may do such acts as may be conducive to the
accomplishment of the purpose of the agency.

COMMENT:
(1) Fundamental Principles of Agency
There are two very important principles of a true agency:
(a) The agent must act within the scope of his authority.
(b) The agent must act in behalf of his principal.
45

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

1881

(NOTE: It is therefore conceivable that an agent
may act under the two conditions given, or under only one
of them, or under neither. Thus, four instances may arise:
1)
2)
3)
4)

The agent acts with authority and in behalf of the
principal.
The agent acts with authority but in behalf of himself
(not the principal).
The “agent” acts without authority but in behalf of a
“principal.’
The “agent” acts without authority and in his own
behalf [not a “principal”].)
(NOTE: In (3) and (4), “agent” and “principal”

apply. (Nat. Bank v. Agudelo, 58 Phil. 655)

In PRINCIPAL’S behalf — VALID (principal is

In AGENTS behalf— APPLY Art. 1883 (generally
not binding on principal; agent and stranger are the

With Authority but in Agent’s Behalf:
P authorized A to sell his (P’s) car. A then sold the car
in his (A’s) own name, without disclosing who the principal
was. Ordinarily, the agent can only have recourse against
the buyer, and the buyer can have recourse only against
the agent under Art. 1883. HOWEVER, in this particular
case, since the car belonged to the principal, P can have
recourse against the buyer and the buyer can have
recourse against P. (See exception in the second paragraph
of Art. 1883)

(2) Effects

1)

With Authority and in Principal’s Behalf:
P authorized A to sell his (P’s) car. A then sold the
car in P’s name. The transaction is VALID. A assumes no
personal liability. (See Lorca v. Dineros, L-10919, Feb. 28,
1958)

such.)

(a)

Art. 1881

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

THE TRUE EXAMPLE IS GIVEN HEREUNDER:
If P authorized A to find for him (P) a singing
engagement at the Manila Grand Opera House, and A acts
in his own (A’s) behalf, that is, A wanted to sing, and he
got the job, only A and the Opera House would be bound
to each other. This example clearly illustrates the general
rule referred to in the second paragraph of Art. 1883.
(c)

Without Authority but in “Principal’s” Behalf:
Without P’s authority, A sold P’s car to a buyer in
P’s behalf. The transaction, insofar as P is concerned is
unauthorized, hence unenforceable. (Art. 1403, No. 1) P
is therefore not bound, unless he ratifies the transaction.
Without the necessary ratification, the buyer can have
a claim only against the alleged agent A. The moment a
ratification is made, A steps out of the picture, since he
would no longer be personally liable, and now it is P who
will have to deal with the buyer.

(d)

Without Authority and in ‘Agent s’ Behalf:
A, without authority from P, and representing
himself to be the owner of P’s car, sold it to a buyer.
Here, A acted without authority. Moreover, he acted in
his own behalf. It is clear that the transaction (sale) is
valid, provided that at the time delivery is to be made, the
“agent” can transfer legally the ownership of the thing.
Otherwise, he will be held liable for breach of warranty
against eviction. It is also clear that only A is liable to
an innocent purchaser. Here, Art. 1883 does NOT apply
because Art. 1883 presupposes AUTHORITY. (See Nat.
Bank v. Agudelo, 58 Phil. 655)

led by the principal’s conduct or words to believe
that the “agent” was really authorized, when in fact
he was not. The effect here is as if there was really
authority).

Examples of Implied Authority:

If an agent is authorized to collect a debt, he usually
is also impliedly authorized to employ an attorney
as counsel, and to bring suit for the enforcement of
the payment. (See 2 C.J. 633-643)

the debt by legal means,” he has the right to institute

In the very nature of things, an agent cannot sell
hemp in a foreign (or even in our) country without
making some kind of a contract, and if he has
authority to sell, it would carry with it authority

contract of sale. (Robinson, Fleming and Co. v. Cruz

An agent or attorney-in-fact who is authorized
to pay the debts of the principal and to employ
an attorney to defend the interests of the latter is
naturally impliedly empowered to pay the fees of the
attorney for services rendered in the interest of said
principal. Moreover, he is empowered to effect the
payment of the fees by assignment to the attorney
of the judgment awarded to his principal. (See Mun.
Council of Iloilo v. Evangelista, 55 Phil. 290)
(NOTE: True, there can be no valid assignment
of things in litigation in favor of the participating
lawyers Art. 1491 , No. 5 — but after the litigation,
there can be such an assignment.)

(

(2 C.J. 658)
5)

Authority to collect does not carry with it authority
to receive partial payment (Heitsch v. Minneapolis
Threshing Mach. Co., 150N. W. 457), nor the authority

to accept commercial paper as payment of the debt (2
Am. Jur. 135-136) It should be noted, however, that
although receipt of a check is unauthorized, still if
the agent is able to collect the monetary equivalent,
the payment should be considered GOOD, and the
debt is therefore extinguished. (2 Am. Jur . 135-136)

ISSUE: Did Francisco have authority to sell the land?

(NOTE: If an agent is authorized to conduct a
business involving the acceptance of checks or notes,
there is naturally an implied authority to accept and
to indorse such commercial paper as will come to the
agent in the course of the business. [2 C.J. 628-629])
(5) Some Cases

HELD: Francisco had no authority to sell. His only
authority was to look for a buyer, and to present the terms of
the proposed sale to the Company for its approval. Inasmuch
as the act was not authorized, it follows that the Company

cannot be held liable.

'

Hermann and Co. v. Donaldson Sim & Co.

1 Phil. 63

FACTS: Germann and Co. authorized its agent
Kommerzell to direct and administer its commercial business,
and, among others, “to collect sums of money and exact their
payment by legal means.” With this authority, can the agent
principal’s name, bring a court action for collection?

(

HELD: Yes. The collection of a claim is necessarily a part
of administration, but even if it be regarded as an act of strict
ownership, still the right to exact payment by legal means
carries with it the right to sue in court for collection. Indeed, it
cannot be reasonably supposed that it was the intention of the
principal to withhold from his agent a power so essential to the
efficient management of the business entrusted to his control
as that to sue for the collection of debts.

Linan v. Puno, et al.
31 Phil. 259
FACTS: Linan authorized in a public instrument a
certain Puno “to administer the interest I possess within this
municipality, purchase, sell, collect and pay, as well as sue and
be sued before any authority, appear before the courts of justice
and administrative officers in any proceeding or business
concerning the good administration and advancement of my
said interests.” Under this document, Puno sold a parcel of
land belonging to Linan. Linan, however, said that he merely
granted Puno the right to administer, not the right to sell.

ISSUE: Did Puno have authority to sell the land?
HELD: Yes, in view of the precise words used in the
document, which granted authority not only to administer, but
also to sell. The clear words of the document should prevail,
considering the fact that Puno presumably acted in good faith
and in accordance with his power as he understood it.

Villa v. Garcia Bosque

FACTS: Villa authorized Pirretas to sell her printing
establishment and book store partly for cash and partly on

credit, with two sureties for the buyer. The two sureties
were France and Goullete. Subsequently, Pirretas left the
Philippines but before doing so, he executed a document
transferring to Figueras Hermanos the authority to collect the
sums still due from the buyer. While acting as such agent,
Figueras entered into an agreement with the buyer, relieving
France and Goulette from all liabilities and sureties. When the
buyer later on failed to pay, Villa sued the buyer and the two
sureties.
ISSUE: Could the sureties still be liable despite their
release by Figueras Hermanos?
HELD: Assuming that Pirretas could validly substitute
Figueras Hermanos in his place, still the authority granted by
him to Figueras Hermanos was merely to collect, not release
the sureties. It follows that Figueras Hermanos could not
discharge any of the debtors without payment, or to novate the
contract, by releasing the sureties. In fact, the terms of the
substitution clearly indicate the limited extent of the authority
of Figueras Hermanos. Therefore, the sureties have not been
relieved of their obligation, and are consequently still liable.

Katigbak v. Tai Hing Co.
52 Phil. 622

FACTS: In 1921, Po Tecsi authorized Gabino-Barreto Po
Ejap to sell any land that “might belong” to him (Po Tecsi).
In 1923, Gabino-Barreto sold his own land to Po Tecsi. In
1924, Gabino-Baretto sold the same land to Katigbak on the
strength of the authority conferred on him in 1921. The sale
was impugned on the theory that the power of attorney had
been executed long before Po Tecsi became the owner of the

land.
ISSUE: Did Gabino-Barreto act within the scope of his
authority.

HELD: Yes, in view of the words “might belong”
(pertenezcen) instead of the word “belong” (pertenecen). The use
of the subjunctive mood indicates that Po Tecsi referred not
only to the property he had at the time of the execution of the
power, but also such as he might afterwards have during the
time it was in force. (See 2 C.J., p. 614)

FACTS: A forged a power of attorney in his favor, and
on its alleged strength, he mortgaged land belonging to the
purported makers of the power of attorney. He was then able
to register the mortgages thus made. What is the effect of the
mortgages and the registration thereof?
HELD: The mortgages and their registration are
absolutely null and void, and cannot in any way affect the
rights of the registered owners.
Yu Eng Yu v. A.C. Ransom Philippine Corp.
(Court of Appeals) 40 O.G. Supp., Aug. 23, 1941, p. 65

FACTS: Without P’s authority, A sold the business
establishment of P in P’s name in favor of a buyer. What right
if any has the buyer?
HELD: The buyer has no title to the property, since the
sale was unauthorized and therefore unenforceable. His only
remedy is to proceed against A.

Markham v. Jandon
41 N.Y. 235
FACTS: The plaintiff usually transacted with a broker
through the “margin plan” whereby the broker would extend
credit to the plaintiff in buying stocks for him, but the stocks
were to be in possession of the broker. A short while after
certain stocks had been purchased in behalf of the plaintiff,
the broker notified the plaintiff that his (the plaintiffs) margin
was insufficient, and that unless additional money would be
deposited, he the broker, would sell the stocks even if by virtue
of such sale, the plaintiff would lose. When the plaintiff failed
to give the needed money, the broker sold the stocks. The
plaintiff now sues the broker for damages. The broker offered
to prove the existence of a custom of their local board of brokers
authorizing the sale of stock once the margin is exhausted.

ISSUE: Was the broker authorized to sell the stock?
HELD: No, the broker was not authorized to sell the stock.
The transaction between the plaintiff and the broker amounts
53

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1881

to a pledge of the stocks. And it is well-settled that although the
pledgor defaults, the pledgee does not automatically become the
owner of the property. Ownership is still with the pledgor. The
pledgee must therefore comply with all the requirements of the
law so that his claim can be satisfied. A custom not sanctioned
by law cannot prevail over the law.

Keeler Elec. Co. v. Rodriguez
44 Phil. 1
Payment to an unauthorized “agent” does not extinguish
one’s obligation, for the payment is not valid. Payment to
an authorized person is at the payor’s risk. Indeed, persons
dealing with an assumed agent, whether the assumed agency
is general or a special one, are bound at their peril, if they
would hold the principal, to ascertain not only the fact of the
agency, but also the nature and extent of the authority and in
case either is controverted, the burden of proof is upon such
persons to establish it.
Caram, Jr. v. Laureta
L-28740, Feb. 24, 1981

If agents, acting for a principal, purchased property in
bad faith, the principal (under the rules of agency) must be
presumed to have also acted in bad faith.
(6) Doctrine of Agency by Necessity

Strictly speaking, an agency can never be created by
necessity. What is meant by the phrase “agency by necessity” is,
however, this: that by virtue of the existence of an emergency,
the authority of an agent is correspondingly enlarged in order
to cope with the exigencies or the necessities of the moment.
In the case of Vandalia R. Co. v. Bryan, 60 Ind. App. 233, five
conditions were laid down for “authority of agency by necessity”
(agent ex necessitate):
(a)

the real existence of an emergency,

(b)

inability of the agent to communicate with the principal;

(c)

the exercise of the additional authority for the principal’s
own protection;
54

Art. 1881

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(d)

the adoption of fairly reasonable means, premises duly
considered;

(e)

the ceasing of the authority the moment the emergency
no longer demands the same.
Example:

If a bus conductor is seriously hurt, the driver is
authorized to engage the services of a physician, in the
company’s name, so that the conductor may survive. This
is really for the best interest of all concerned. (See Terre
Haute v. McMurray, 98 Ind. 358 for an analogous case)
{!) ‘Authority* Distinguished from ‘Power*

While ‘authority’ and ‘power’ may be often used as
synonymous terms, still there is a slight distinction in that
authority may be considered the cause, while power is the
effect. In other words, authority emanates from a principal,
and is given to the agent, who thus becomes empowered. The
agent who is thus authorized now possesses power.
{NOTE: Power may thus be express, implied, or
incidental.)

{NOTE: A power of attorney or letter of attorney is
authority given in writing. [1 Mechem, Sec. 35] The agent given
the power of attorney may be referred to as an attorney in fact.
[1 Mechem, Sec. 35])

{NOTE: Attorneys-at-law are agents, being distinguished
from agents generally by reason of the fact that their authority
is of a special and limited character in most respects. (2 Am.
Jur. 14) Therefore, notice to counsel of a party is notice to the

latter, and the time to appeal from the dismissal of the client’s
complaint should be counted from the notice to said counsel,
even if the client was not notified of the dismissal. [Valeriano,
et al. v. Kerr, et al., L-10657, May 16, 1958 and Perez v.
Araneta, L- 11728, May 16, 1958] But, notice to the client being
represented by counsel, is not notice in law. [Visayan Surety &
Ins. Co. v. Central Bank, L- 12139, Sept. 17, 1958])

Art. 1882. The limits of the agent’s authority shall not

a manner more advantageous to the principal than that
specified by him.

COMMENT:
(1) When Agent’s Performance of Authority is Deemed Still

Authorized
This is justified because of the greater benefit that would
accrue to the principal. “Advantageous,” however, does not
only refer to a financial gain, which may be offset by a moral or
ethical loss.

Art. 1883

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(3) Sale at a Lower or Higher Price
The agent should not sell things received by him from
his principal at a price less than that fixed by the latter. But
there is NO prohibition against his selling the goods at a
better price, if said price can be obtained. (Tan Tiong Teck v.
Com. de Valores y Bolsas, 40 O.G. [6th S] p. 125, 69 Phil. 425)

However, the conditions of the sale must remain unaltered,
hence authorization to sell for cash does not carry with it
authorization to sell on credit, even if by such device a higher
price can be obtained. (See Art. 1905)

(4) Bar

An agent with general powers for administration, desirous
of improving the financial condition of his principal’s business,
sold a piece of land belonging to his principal for double the
price that appeared in an inventoiy prepared by the principal
before leaving the place. Do you think the agent has exceeded
his power? Why?
ANS.: Yes, the agent has exceeded his powers despite the
fact that the price obtained was double the value of the property.
The important fact is that he made a sale, a transaction which
requires a special power of attorney. (Art. 1878) As a mere
administrator, he had no right to alienate.

Art. 1883. If an agent acts in his own name, the principal
has no right of action against the persons with whom the
agent has contracted; neither have such persons against the
principal.
In such case, the agent is the one directly bound in
favor of the person with whom he has contracted, as if the
transaction were his own, except when the contract involves
things belonging to the principal.

The provisions of this article shall be understood to be
without prejudice to the actions between the principal and
agent.

object for PIOO.OOO, but he is able to get P100.000 cash for the

(1) Agency With an Undisclosed Principal

This Article speaks of a case where the agent WAS
AUTHORIZED, but instead of acting in behalf of the principal,

he acts in his own behalf. Thus, Art. 1883 does not apply if the
agent was unauthorized or he acts in excess “of his authority.”
(See Nat. Bank v. Agudelo, 58 Phil. 655)
(NOTE: Refer to Comments Nos. 1, 2, and 3 under Art.
1881.)

(2) Example of the General Rule

Jose asked Pedro to borrow money from Juan. Pedro did
not disclose to Juan that he (Pedro) was borrowing in Jose’s
behalf; that is, Pedro borrowed in his own name. Can Juan ask
Jose to pay the debt?
AMS..- No. Only Pedro has the duty to pay Juan.
Philippine Bank of Commerce v. Jose M. Aruego
L-25836-37, Jan. 31, 1981
102 Phil. 530
If an alleged agent signs a bill of exchange without
indicating thereon that he was signing as an agent or
representative of the Philippine Education Foundation
Company (of which he was president), he is personally liable.
(3) Example of the Exception

A principal told his agent to sell his (the principal’s) car
for him (the principal). The agent sold it to a third party. The
agent acted in his own name. Can the third party sue the
principal in case the car has hidden defects?

ANS.: Yes. In this case, although the agent acted in his own
name, still the sale involved a car belonging to the principal.
Here, we apply the exception stated in the second paragraph of
Art. 1883. As a matter of fact, the sale is completely valid.
(4) When Agent Transacts Business in His Own Name

If an agent transacts business in his own name, it is
not necessary for him to state who is the principal, and he is
directly liable as if the business were for his own account, to
the person with whom he transacts the same. (Lim v. Ruiz y
Rementeria, 15 Phil. 367)
58

Art. 1888

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(5) When Authorized Agent Buys in His Own Name But

Really in Behalf of His Principal

If an authorized agent buys in his own name but really
in behalf of his principal, the seller has the option to look to
EITHER for payment unless:

he trusted the agent exclusively,
(b) or by the usage and understanding of business, the
agent only is held;
(c) or unless the special circumstances of the case reveal
that only the agent was intended to be bound and the seller
knew it, or was chargeable with knowledge of it. (Wing Lee v.
Bark “Monogahela," 44 Phil. 464)
(a)

(6) When Authority of Agent is Doubtful

If it cannot be determined whether or not the agent
was authorized, or had disclosed a principal, the action must
be directed against both the “agent” and the “principal.”
(Beaumont v. Prieto, 41 Phil. 670)
(7) Regarding "Things Belonging to the Principal”

This means that in the case of this exception, the
agent’s apparent representation yields to the principal’s true
representation; and that, in reality and in effect, the contract
must be considered as entered into between the principal and
the third person and consequently, if the obligations belong to
the former, to him alone must also belong the rights arising
from the contract. (Sy-Juco and Viardo v. Sy-Juco, 40 Phil.
634)

Examples:
(a)

If the agent buys with money belonging to the principal,
was authorized to so buy but acted in his own name, the
principal nevertheless has a right of action against the
seller, and the seller has a right of action against the
principal. (See Sy-Juco and Viardo v. Sy-Juco, supra)

(b)

The Philippine rule is that where merchandise is bought
from an agent with an undisclosed principal, and without
59

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1883

knowledge on the part of the buyer that the seller is
merely an agent, the buyer takes title to the merchan¬
dise and the principal cannot maintain successfully an
action against him for the recovery of the merchandise
or for damages, but can only proceed against the agent.
(Awad v. Filma Mercantile Co., 49 Phil. 816)
(NOTE: In the abovementioned case, the agent was
authorized to sell; this is why the transaction is valid. Had the

agent not been authorized, the whole transaction would have
been null and void, considering the fact that he acted in his

own name.)

The exception provided for in the second
paragraph of Art. 1883 cannot be invoked if the contract of sale
did not cover property of the supposed principal, but involved
the property of a third person. [See Lion Tek Goan v. Jose
Azores, 42 O.G. 2840J)
(NOTE:

OBLIGATIONS OF THE AGENT
}>

«i

Art. 1884. The agent is bound by his acceptance to carry
out the agency and is liable for the damages which, through
his non-performance, the principal may suffer.
He must also finish the business already begun on the
death of the principal, should delay entail any danger.

COMMENT:
(1) Duty of Agent to Carry Out the Agency

An agent who does not carry out the agency is liable for
damages. Upon the other hand, if he fulfills his duty, he is
not personally liable unless he so binds himself.

Bank of the Phil. Islands v. Pineda
GR 62441, Dec. 14, 1987
The agents of a disclosed principal, the owner of a ship,
cannot be held liable for repairs made on the vessel to keep
them in good running condition in order to earn revenue, if
there is no showing that said agents exceeded their authority.
(2) Liability of Lawyer Who Fails to Perfect an Appeal

The mere fact that a lawyer fails to perfect an appeal
of his client does not give rise to damages in the absence of
showing that the decision which became final was unjust.
(Heridia v. Salinas, 10 Phil. 157)
(3) Effect of Principal’s Death

Angel was Pedro’s agent. Angel was performing a business
of the agency when suddenly Pedro died. Although as a rule,

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

the death of the principal extinguishes the agency, Angel is
obliged to finish the business already begun if delay should
entail any danger. (Art. 1884, par. 2)

COMMENT:
Stipulation for Agent to Advance Necessary Funds

Example:
(4) Agent Who Sells to Himself

An agent who has been authorized to sell some
merchandise is not allowed to bind the principal by selling
to himself (the agent) directly or indirectly. Hence, if an
agent, through his own sub-agent, buys from the principal,
the principal is not required to fill such orders unless said
principal ratifies the sale after he has had full knowledge of
the facts of the case. (Barton v. Leyte Asphalt, 46 Phil. 938)

Art. 1885. In case a person declines an agency, she is
bound to observe the diligence of a good father of a family
in the custody and preservation of the goods forwarded to
him by the owner until the latter should appoint an agent.
The owner shall as soon as practicable either appoint an
agent or take charge of the goods.

Angel is Pedro’s agent. Both agreed that Angel would
advance the necessary funds, but later Pedro became insolvent.
Is Angel still bound to furnish such necessary funds?

ANS.: No more, in view of the principal’s insolvency.

Art 1887. In the execution of the agency, the agent shall
act in accordance with the instructions of the principal.
In default thereof, he shall do all that a good father of a
family would do, as required by the nature of the business.
COMMENT:
(1) Agent’s Duty to Follow Instruction

(a)

Instruction, as we have already seen, differ from
authority.

(b)

In commenting upon this Article (Art. 1887), Dalloz, after
laying down the admitted proposition that the acts of
an agent beyond his limited powers are invalid, states
three qualifications which would bind the principal:
1)

where the principal’s acts have contributed to deceive
a third person in good faith;

2)

where the limitations upon the power created by
the principal could not have been known by a third
person; and
where the principal has placed in the hands of
the agent instruments signed by him in blank

as possible:

by taking charge of the goods.

(2) Effect If Agent Follows Instruction

If an agent carrying out the orders of the principal carried
out the instruction he has received from said principal, he
63

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1887

cannot be held responsible for the failure of his principal to
accomplish the object of the agency unless the said agent
exceeded his authority or has acted with negligence, deceit, or
fraud. (Gutierrez Hermanos v. Oria Hermanos, 30 Phil. 491)
(3) Clarity of Instructions

"

It is the duty of the principal, if he desires an authority
executed in a particular manner to make his terms so clear and
unambiguous that they cannot reasonably be misconstrued. If
he does this, it is the agent’s duty to the principal to execute
the authority strictly and faithfully; and third persons who
know of the limitations, or who from the circumstances of
the case ought to have known of them can claim no rights
against the principal based upon their violation. (1 Mechem
on Agency, Sec. 792)

(4) Different Interpretations Re Instructions

If on the other hand, the authority be couched in such
uncertain terms as to be reasonably susceptible of two
different meanings, and the agent in good faith and without
negligence adopts one of them, the principal cannot be heard
to assert, either as against the agent or against third persons
who have, in like good faith and without negligence, relied
upon the same construction, that he intended the authority
to be executed in accordance with the other interpretation.
If in such a case, the agent exercises his best judgment and
an honest discretion, he fulfills his duty, and though a loss
ensues, it cannot be cast upon the agent. (Mechem on Agency,

Sec. 793)
(5) How Instructions Are to Be Construed

An instrument conferring authority is generally, it
is said, to be construed by those having occasion to act in
reference to it, as a “plain man acquainted with the object
in view, and attending reasonably, to the language used, has
in fact, construed it. He is not bound to take the opinion of
an attorney concerning the meaning of a word not technical
and apparently employed in a popular sense.” (1 Mechem on
Agency, Sec. 793)
64

Art. 1888

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(6) How Execution May Fail

The execution of the authority in a given case may fail,
either:
(a) because the agent has negligently failed to fully exercise
his authority;
(b) or because he has exceeded it. (1 Mechem on Agency,

Sec. 159)
(7) Excessive Execution

If there has been a complete execution of the power and
the excess can be distinguished and disregarded, the authorized
portion may be given effect. (1 Mechem on Agency, Sec. 159)
Art. 1888. An agent shall not carry out an agency if
its execution would manifestly result in loss or damages
to the principal.

COMMENT:
(1) When Agency Should Not Be Carried Out
(a)

The reason for the Article is because an agent should
exercise due diligence.

(b)

Furthermore, the agent must presumably act for the
benefit, and not to the detriment of the principal.

(c)

“Manifestly” means that the execution would damage
ANY principal.

(2) Example

P instructed his agent A to charter a boat from Japan
to Manila and to load the principal’s goods with the specific
instructions to sail from Japan to Manila on Feb. 14, 2005,
and to thereafter sell the goods upon arrival in Manila. The
weather report on the date of the scheduled departure showed
that a strong typhoon was directly going to cross the path of
the boat. Considering the circumstances, it would be safe to
sail only after one week. In the meantime, the prices of the
goods at Manila went down by 50%. P thus fell short of the
profits he expected to realize. Would A be liable to P?
65

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 1889-1890

ANS.: No. A would not be liable to P because had A
carried out the agency, it would have resulted in loss or
damage to his principal (P).

Art. 1889. The agent shall be liable for damages if,
there being a conflict between his interests and those of
the principal he should prefer his own.

COMMENT:
(1) Rule If Agent Prefers His Own Interests

The Article applies whether the agency is onerous or
gratuitous for here the law does not distinguish.

and not allow him to be lender and borrower at the same
time The temptation to insert terms unfavorable to the
principal is too great, and lending money involves other
considerations besides rate of interest. [Observations on
the new Civil Code, XVI Lawyer’s Journal 138J)
(b) Angel has been authorized to lend money at interest.
May Angel borrow the money for himself?
ANS.: No, unless the principal consents. Reason for
the law: The agent may not be a good borrower or he
may be insolvent or he may not be a good risk. There
is danger here that the interests of the principal would
be jeopardized.
(2) Benefit of Principal

(2) Example

P owns a Mercedes Benz car, model 2005. He appoints
A to sell the car. A also is an owner of a Mercedes car of the
samp model as P’s. X a third person, is interested in buying
either P’s or A’s car for P12 million — an attractive price.
If A sells his own car (and not that of P’s), P may sue A for
damages for it is clear that A has preferred his own interest.
Art. 1890. If the agent has been empowered to borrow
money, he may himself be the lender at the current rate of
interest. If he has been authorized to lend money at interest,
he cannot borrow it without the consent of the principal.

COMMENT:
(1) Authority to Borrow or Lend Money

Examples:
(a)

Art 1891

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Angel was authorized to borrow money. May Angel lend
his own money to the principal?

ANS.: Yes, at the current rate of interest. Reason:
Principal suffers no injury.
{NOTE: Justice J.B.L. Reyes has questioned the
wisdom of Art. 1890. He says: “It is preferable that the
agent be not permitted to occupy inconsistent positions,
66

The borrowing of the money must be for the benefit of
the principal, and not for the agent’s personal benefit.
(3) Prohibition to Purchase

It should be noted that under Art. 1491, agents cannot
acquire by purchase, even at public or judicial auction, either
in person or through the mediation of another, the property
whose administration or sale may have been entrusted to
them, unless the consent of the principal has been given.

Art. 1891. Every agent is bound to render an account
of his transactions and to deliver to the principal whatever
he may have received by virtue of the agency, even though
it may not be owing to the principal.

Every stipulation exempting the agent from the
obligation to render an account shall be void.

COMMENT:
(1) Duty of Agent to Account

Example of par. 1:

An overprice received by the agent for goods he was to
sell at a certain price.
67

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1891

(NOTE: Hie Article does not apply to the case of solutio
indebiti for in such cases, recovery can be had by the payor
against the agent himself. Therefore, the agent, for the
meantime, can keep what had been given to him by error.)

still this fact will not excuse him from the duty of accounting
promptly for the funds received. (In re Bamberger,
49 Phil.

962)

(4) No Co-Ownership Over Funds Despite Right

Commission

Domingo v. Domingo

42 SCRA 131
FACTS: An agent did not reveal to his principal that
he (the agent) was able to obtain a secret profit from the
transaction in the nature of a bonus, gratuity, or personal
benefit. Does he still have the right to collect the commission
that ordinarily should be due to him?

HELD: No more, on account of his breach of loyalty to
the principal. The forfeiture of the commission will take place,
even if the principal does not suffer any injury by reason of
such breach of loyalty. It does not even matter that the agency
was a gratuitous one, or that the principal obtained better
results, or that usage or custom allows the receipt of such a
bonus. Indeed, an agent has an absolute duty to make a full
disclosure or accounting to his principal of all transactions
and material facts that may have some relevance with the
agency.
(2) Stipulation Exempting Agent from Duty to Account

Reason for par. 2:
Against public policy because it would be conducive to
fraud.

to

Although the agent is entitled to receive a commission,
this fact by itself would not make him a co-owner regarding
the money that have been collected. Co-ownership is not
established. The relationship of principal and agent subsists.
If the agent subtracts from the money more than what he is
entitled to obtain as his commission, it cannot be denied that
he has committed estafa. (U.S. v. Reyes, 36 Phil. 791)
(5) Agent Should Not Profit for His Own Account

Neither an agent nor a trustee is allowed to make a
profit for his own benefit as long as the agency exists or
the trust relations continue. To hold otherwise would be to
countenance an unlawful inducement. Thus, if an agent should
conceal certain facts from his own principal, he should under
no condition be permitted to profit thereby. A principal, on the
other hand, is entitled to recover from the agent what may
be due him (the principal) as a consequence of the agency.
(Ojinaga v. Estate of Perez, 9 Phil. 185)
(6) Doctrines on the Duty to Account

(a)

Whoever administers another’s affairs must render an
account because of the representative relation and because
of the fiduciary position. (See Dorman v. Crooks State
Bank, 225 N.W. 661)

(3) Duty to Deliver Funds

If nothing in the contract of agency provides otherwise,
this Art. 1891 imposes on the agent the obligation to deliver to
his principal all funds collected on his (the principal’s) account.
(U.S. v. Kiene, 7 Phil. 736) As a matter of fact, lawyers are
required to render a prompt accounting for money or property
received by them on behalf of their clients. Failure to do this
constitutes professional misconduct. While it is true that the
lawyer may perhaps possess a lien on the money in his hands
money that had been collected on behalf of the clients

(c)

If an agent refuses to account when it is his duty to do
so, the principal may at once terminate the agency and
sue for the balance due. (2 C.J. 738-739). If the principal
dies, the agency is extinguished, BUT the duty to account
subsists, and can be demanded by the principal's heirs
or legal representatives. (See 11 Manresa 513)
The principal, or his legal representative, has the right to
pass upon the correctness of the accounting. (11 Manresa

(7) Some Cases

United States v. Kiene
7 Phil. 736
FACTS: An insurance agent named Kiene refused count
to his principal, the China Mutual Life Insurance Company,
for approximately Pl,500 which came to him in the course
of the agency. Because he refused to turn over the amount
and to account for them, he was prosecuted for estafa. His
only defense was the allegation that no law compelled him
to deliver the amount referred to.
HELD: He is guilty because the duty to turn over the
fund is stated in Art. 1891 of the Civil Code.
United States v. Igpuara
27 Phil. 619
FACTS: Igpuara, an agent for Juana Montilla and
Eugenio Veraguth had in his possession P2,498 belonging
to the principals. At the time the accounts were settled, he
executed the following instrument:
“We hold at the disposal of Eugenio Veraguth the sum
Iloilo,
of P2.498, the balance from Juana Montilla’s sugar
Company.”
Jose Igpuara, for Ramirez and
June 26, 1911
On Aug. 23, 1911, Veraguth demanded the return of
the amount but the agent failed to do so. When Igpuara was
accused of estafa, he claimed no crime had been committed,
and that he was civilly liable because the contract referred
to above was in the nature of a loan.
HELD: The contract was not a loan, otherwise the lender
could not recover until after the expiration of a legal stipulated

—

—

Art. 1891

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

period. Indeed, the money in the possession of the agent but
at the principal’s disposal acquired the character of a deposit
demandable at any time. Moreover, Igpuara could not lawfully
dispose of it without incurring criminal responsibility for
appropriating or diverting to his own use another’s property.
Inasmuch as he has abused the confidence reposed in him by
his misappropriation of the money, there is no doubt that he
is guilty of estafa.

Ojinaga v. Estate of Perez
9 Phil. 185

FACTS: Ojinaga’s properties were being administered
by Perez. Perez rendered an accounting showing a profit of
Pl,700. He then turned the amount to Ojinaga who knew
that the profits were much more, about P12.000. But, Ojinaga
accepted the accounting without any protest. When Ojinaga
died, his heirs wanted the accounting set aside on the ground
of fraud.

HELD: The accounting cannot be set aside on the ground
of fraud, for although Ojinaga knew of the true amount of
the profits, still, he approved the accounting report.
-I
Severino v. Severino
44 Phil. 343

FACTS: An agent, Guillermo Severino, for his brother
Melecio Severino, registered the latter’s land in his (the
agent’s) own name, and was granted a Torrens Title therefor.
Years after the decree became final, the estate of Melecio
(now dead) sued for reconveyance of the land but Guillermo
claimed ownership over it by virtue of the registration under
his name. It was proved however that Guillermo was only
the trustee, administrator, or agent of Melecio with respect
to the land.

HELD: Reconveyance can be made. The relations were
fiduciary in nature and the agent is estopped from acquiring
or asserting a title adverse to that of his principal. True,
Guillermo is the owner insofar as third persons are concerned,
but not insofar as his principal is concerned. The remedy of
reconveyance does not mean the reopening of the decree of
71

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1892

registration. That can no longer be done since the one-year
period has already prescribed. But reconveyance can still
be done. Surely, no reason of public policy demands that a
person guilty of fraud or breach of trust be permitted to use
his certificate of title as a shield against the consequences of
his own wrong.
(To the same effect: Consunji v. Tison, 15 Phil. 81; Uy
Aloe v. Cho Jan Ling, 19 Phil. 202; and Sy-Juco and Viardo
v. Sy-Juco, 40 Phil. 634)

Art. 1892. The agent may appoint a substitute if the
principal has not prohibited him from doing so; but he shall
be responsible for the acts of the substitute:
(1) When he was not given the power to appoint one;
(2) When he was given such power, but without
designating the person, and the person appointed was
notoriously incompetent or insolvent
All acts of the substitute appointed against the
prohibition of the principal shall be void.

COMMENT:
(1) Appointment of Substitute for the Agent
(a)

(b)

A is Rs agent. In their contract of agency, nothing
was mentioned as to whether or not A could appoint
a substitute. A appointed S as his substitute. Is the
appointment of the substitute valid?
ANS.: Yes, but A shall be responsible for the acts
of the substitute. (1st par., Art. 1892)
In problem (a), suppose the substitute violated the

instructions of P, whom can P hold liable?
ANS.: P can hold A liable (Art. 1892) and P can
also hold S liable. (Art. 1893)
(c) A is Rs agent. A asked P for permission to appoint a
substitute, but A did not mention who the substitute
would be. P agreed. Now, the substitute violated P’s
instructions as well as A’s instructions, causing damage
72

Art. 1893

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

to P. Can P hold A liable for the substitute’s actuations,
in case for example, the substitute is insolvent?
ANS.: It depends. If the substitute appointed by A
was at the time of appointment notoriously incompetent
or insolvent, then P can hold A liable, subsidiarily or even
primarily. If the substitute at the time of appointment
was neither notoriously incompetent or insolvent, then
P cannot hold A liable, either primarily or subsidiarily.
(Art. 1892, No. 2)
(d)

A is Rs agent. A was prohibited by P to appoint a
substitute. Nevertheless, A appointed S as substitute.
S sold goods belonging to P to B, who was a purchaser
in good faith. Is the sale valid?

ANS.: The sale is completely null and void. The law
says that all acts of the substitute appointed against the
prohibition of the principal shall be void. (Last par., Art.
1892)

(2) Soundness of the Article

Is Art. 1892 sound?

ANS.: Yes, for while ordinarily the agent upon whom
the principal has reposed confidence must do the act himself,
still the principal need not fear prejudice for in some cases,
he can still exact responsibility from his agent. (11 Manresa
518-519)

Art. 1893. In the cases mentioned in Nos. 1 and 2 of the
preceding article, the principal may furthermore bring an
action against the substitute with respect to the obligations
which the latter has contracted under the substitution.

COMMENT:
(1) When the Principal Can Sue the Substitute
(a)

Under the premises given in the Article the principal
can sue both the agent and the substitute.

This is one exception to Art. 1311 respecting the privity
of contracts.

(2) Art. 1311 (Who Are Bound by Contracts)

'

Contracts take effect only between the parties, their
assigns and heirs, except in case where the rights and
obligations arising from the contract are not transmissible
by their nature, or by stipulation or by provision of law. The
heir is not liable beyond the value of the property he received
from the decedent.
If a contract should contain some stipulation in favor
of a third person, he may demand its fulfillment provided
he communicated his acceptance to the obligor before its
revocation. A mere incidental benefit or interest of a person
is not sufficient. The contracting parties must have clearly
and deliberately conferred a favor upon a third person.

Art. 1894. The responsibility of two or more agents,
even though they have been appointed simultaneously, is
not solidary, if solidarity has not been expressly stipulated.

COMMENT:

,.

Joint Not Solidary Liability
(a) The liability referred to here as well as in the next Article
is the liability of the agents towards the principal, and
not that towards third parties.
(b) The liability is indeed joint and personal, but only if
each can act separately. But, if it be essential that all
agents act, and one is unable to do so, then that one is
the ONLY agent liable.

Art. 1895. If solidarity has been agreed upon, each of the
agents is responsible for the non-fulfillment of the agency,
and for the fault or negligence of his fellow agents, except
in the latter case when the fellow agents acted beyond the
scope of their authority.

.

COMMENT:

When Solidarity Has Been Agreed Upon
(a) Example: P appointed A and B as agents. Solidarity
between the agents was agreed upon. Through B’s fault,
the agency was not fulfilled. Can P sue A for damages?
74

Arte. 1896-1897

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

ANS.: If B acted within the scope of his authority,
A, being solidary agent, can be made responsible for the
entire damages, without prejudice to his right later on
to recover from the erring agent.
(b)

x-

Example where one acts beyond the scope of his authority:
two solidary agents were appointed to sell the Cadillac
car of the principal. Unfortunately, one of them sold the
Mercury automobile. Here, the innocent agent cannot be
liable at all to the principal, even if solidarity had been
agreed upon.

Art. 1896. The agent owes interest on the sums he has
applied to his own use from the day on which he did so,
and on those which he still owes after the extinguishment
of the agency.

COMMENT:
Liability of the Agent for Interest
(a) Under the old Civil Code, after the word “agency,” there
was the clause “from the time he is put in default.” Under
the new Civil Code, said clause had been eliminated.
(b) This Article is without prejudice to a criminal action
that may be brought because of conversion.
"* (c) On the other hand, there is no liability for interest on
sums which have not been converted for the agent’s own
use (De Borja v. Borja, 58 Phil. 811), unless of course,
“ '
at the expiration of the agency, the agent still owes the
principal certain sums. (2nd part, Art. 1896)

Art. 1897. The agent who acts as such is not personally
liable to the party with whom he contracts, unless he
expressly binds himself or exceeds the limits of his authority
without giving such party sufficient notice of his powers.

COMMENT:
(1) No Personal Liability for Agent
(a)

Reason for the law: Said agent who acts as agent does
not represent himself but the principal.
75

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1897

In case of acts by the agent in excess of authority, the
principal cannot be bound unless he ratifies the act.
(c) If an agent obligates himself personally, aside from acting
in behalf of his principal, both are bound. (Tuazon v.
Orozco, 5 Phil. 596)
(d) If an executor or administrator of the estate of a
deceased person, without proper court authority, makes
a contract regarding said estate, he imposes upon himself
a personal obligation. This is true even though in signing
the contract, he has described himself as administrator
or executor, with the intent to bind the estate. (Pacific
Commercial Co. v. Hernaez, et al., 51 Phil. 494)
(b)

(e)

Even if an agent has bound himself to pay the debt, this
fact will not relieve from liability a principal for whose
benefit the debt has been incurred. The further liability
of the agent can be considered as a further security in
favor of the creditor, and will not preclude or eliminate
the liability of the principal. (Tuazon v. Orozco, supra)

(f)

It is manifest upon the simplest principles of jurisprudence
that one who has intervened in the making of a contract as
an agent cannot be permitted to intercept and appropriate
the thing which the principal is bound to deliver. If he
does this, this would make performance by the principal
impossible. In any event, the agent must be prohibited
to perform any positive act that could prevent fulfillment
on the part of his principal. Good faith towards the other
contracting party requires this much. (National Bank v.
Welch, Fairchild and Co., 44 Phil. 780)

(2) Proper Parties to the Suit

An action against a person who merely acted in behalf of
another should be dismissed. The suit should be against the
principal, not against the agent, except where the agent acts
in his own name or exceeds the limit of his agency. (Lorca
v. Dineros, L-10919, Feb. 28, 1958; Singh v. Dulce, 49 Phil.
563; and Macias and Co. v. Warner, Barnes & Co., 43 Phil.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Jovito R. Salonga v. Warner, Barnes
and Co., Ltd.
L-2246, Jan. 31, 1951
FACTS: In 1946, Westchester Fire Insurance Co. of New
York entered into a contract with Tina J. Gamboa, whereby
said company insured one case of rayon yardage which said
Gamboa shipped from San Francisco, California, on steamer
“Clavis Victory,” to Manila and consigned to Jovito Salonga,
plaintiff herein. According to the contract of insurance, the
insurance company undertook to pay to the sender or her
consignee the damages that may be caused to the goods shipped
subject to the condition that the liability of the company will
be limited to the actual loss which the insured may suffer, not
to exceed the sum of P2.000. When the shipped goods arrived
in Manila, there was a shortage in the shipment amounting to
Pl,723.12. In Oct., plaintiff filed a claim for damages against
the American President Lines, agents of the ship “Clavis
Victory” demanding settlement; and when apparently no
action was taken on his claims, plaintiff demanded payment
thereof from Warner, Barnes and Co., Ltd. as agent of the
Insurance Co. in the Philippines and his agent having refused
to pay the claim, plaintiff instituted the present action. The
defendant, among other defenses, claimed that it cannot be
made responsible because it had no contractual relation with
either the plaintiff or his consignor. Should the defendant
pay?

HELD: The defendant is not obliged to pay. It is a wellknown rule that a contractual obligation or liability, or an
action ex contractu, must be founded upon a contract: oral or
written, either express or implied. This is axiomatic. If there
is no contract, there is no corresponding liability, and no
cause of action may arise therefrom. The defendant did not
take part, directly or indirectly, in the contract in question.
The contract is purely bilateral, binding only upon Gamboa
and the insurance company. In the case of Morris and Co.
v. Warner, Barnes and Co., 43 Phil. 155, it was held that
even in the case of an agent who signs for his company, said
agent, as long as he acts within the scope of his authority,
does not assume personal liability for a contract entered into
by him in behalf of his principal. It was also held that in
77

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 1898

such a case, only the principal was bound. In this case, this
principle acquires added force and effect when we consider
the fact that the defendant did not sign the contract as agent
of the foreign insurance company.
(3) Authority to Sell All of the Principal’s Property

A power of attorney allowing the agent to sell all the
property of the principal is sufficient to validate the sale
of any single parcel of land which may be included in said
properties. (Jimenez v. Rabat, 38 Phil. 378)
(4) Authority to Agree on Certain Stipulations

If an agent is authorized generally to sell merchandise, he
is also allowed to include in the contract of sale the stipulation
which are customary in the trade in such goods. (Robinson,
Fleming and Co. v. Cruz and Tan Chong Say, 49 Phil. 42)

Art. 1898. If the agent contracts in the name of the
principal, exceeding the scope of his authority, and the
principal does not ratify the contract, it shall be void if
the party with whom the agent contracted is aware of the
limits of the powers granted by the principal. In this case,
however, the agent is liable if he undertook to secure the
principal’s ratification.

so authorized. Give the status of the sale.
ANS.: Even as between the agent and the third person,
such a sale is completely null and void. However, if the agent
had promised to obtain the principal’s ratification, said agent
would be liable in case of failure to obtain such ratification.
If ratification has been obtained, then the principal would be
bound.

Art. 1899. If a duly authorized agent acts in accordance
with the orders of the principal, the latter cannot set up
the ignorance of the agent as to circumstances whereof he
himself was, or ought to have been, aware.

(1) Effect of Agent’s Ignorance

(a)

This Article is based on equity, for after all the agent
had complied with his duty.

COMMENT:
(1) Contracts Entered Into in Excess of Authority

This Article refers only to the liability of the agent
towards the third person. It is clear that under the
premises given, the principal is not at all bound, except
of course if there is subsequent ratification by him.
(b) Therefore “it shall be void” refers to the tie between the
agent and the third party. Regarding the principal, other

(b)

Notice that for this article to apply, the authority must
be in writing.

PROBLEM
QUESTION: The scope of the agent’s authority is what
appears in the written terms of the power of attorney. While
third persons are bound to inquire into the extent or scope
of the agent’s authority, are they required to go beyond the
terms of the written power of attorney?
ANSWER: No. Third persons cannot be adversely affected
by an understanding between the principal and his agent as
to the limits of the latter’s authority. In the same way, third
persons need not concern themselves with instructions given
by the principal to his agent outside of the written power
of attorney. (Siredy Enterprises, Inc. v. CA and Conrado de
Guzman, GR 129039, Sept. 17, 2002)
(2) Example

P gave his agent A a power of attorney, wherein was
written A’s right to sell 2 parcels of land belonging to P. P
and A however had an understanding to the effect that A
should only sell one parcel of land. A sold both. P did not
ratify the contract. Is P bound by the sale of both parcels?

ANS.: Yes. While it is true that a third-party deals with
an agent at his (the third party’s) own risk, and while it is the
duty of the third party to investigate the extent of an agent’s
authority, nevertheless, in this case the power of attorney as
written showed complete authorization. It is unfair to demand
that the third person inquire further than the terms of said
power of attorney as written. To hold otherwise would be to
open the door to countless frauds and machinations.

Art. 1901. A third person cannot set up the fact that the
agent has exceeded his powers, if the principal has ratified,
or has signified his willingness to ratify the agent’s acts.

(2) Case

Cruz v. Court of Appeals
GR 85685, Sept. 11, 1991
FACTS: In its complaint Purefoods alleged that Lauro
Cruz applied for a credit line, which was approved, and Lauro
Cruz made various purchases. The unpaid account of Lauro
Cruz, according to Purefoods, amounted to P55.246. The
parties who signed the credit application card as applicants,
however, are ME Cruz who signed over the printed words
“Name of Signatory” and Marilou Cruz who signed over the
printed words “Authorized Signature.” The application card
indicated Mang Uro Store, as the Trade Name; and Lauro
Cruz as owner and manager. Lauro Cruz contends that he did
not sign any of the invoices attached to the complaint. The
trial court ordered Lauro Cruz to pay Purefoods
P55.246 as
unpaid account plus interest. The Court of Appeals sustained
the trial court.
HELD: The Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals’
decision and held that the trial court even without laying
the factual premises made a sweeping conclusion that it
was
Lauro Cruz who applied for a credit line with Purefoods. But
as correctly pointed by Lauro Cruz, the documents themselves
show that he did not sign any of them. The credit application
card is a form prepared and supplied by Purefoods. There is
no evidence, much less an allegation that it was Lauro
who
filled up the entries in said form. It is logical to presume that
the parties who signed it made the entries.
81

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1903

“

Since on the face of the document, the owner-manager
of the Mang Uro Store which is written on the column
Trade Name is Lauro Cruz and not the parties signing
the same, it was incumbent upon Purefoods to inquire into
the relationship of the signatories to Lauro or satisfy itself
as to their authority to act for or represent Lauro. Under
the circumstances, Lauro had no participation and the two
applicants could have acted without authority from him or
as his duly authorized representatives. In either case, for
the protection of its interest, Purefoods should have made
the necessary inquiry verification as to the authority of the
applicants and to find out from them whether Lauro is both
the owner and manager or merely the owner or the manager,
for that is what owner/manager in its form could signify.

Art. 1903. The commission agent shall be responsible

possession the goods of the principal.
(4) Presumption as to When the Damage to the Goods

This Article gives a presumption to the effect that
the damage to the merchandise were suffered while in the
possession and custody of the agent; such a presumption is
only a disputable one however. (3 Echavarri 105)

(1) ‘Commission Agent’ Defined

(2) Distinction between a Commission Agent and a Broker

A commission agent is one engaged in the purchase
and sale for a principal of personal property, which for this
purpose, has to be placed in his possession and at his disposal.
He has a relation not only with his principal, and the buyers
or sellers, but also with the property which constitutes the
object of the transaction.
A broker, upon the other hand, maintains no relation
with the thing which he purchases or sells. He is supposed to
be merely a go-between, an intermediary between the seller
and the buyer. As such, he does not have either the custody
or the possession of the thing that he disposes of. His only

the principal can demand from said agent the sum of Pl 00,000
cash. However, should the agent eventually collect the entire
P120,000, he can keep this entire sum of P120,000. In other
words, he gets an ultimate personal gain of P20,000. This
situation must not be confused with the case of an agent who,
being authorized to sell for P100,000 cash, sells the property
for P120,000 cash. Here, the entire P120,000 must be turned

ordinary commission (P4,000). He was also paid a guaranteed
commission of 5% (P2,000). His total profit would be, therefore,

(2) When Agent Is Not Liable in Case of Failure to Collect

If a commission agent without a guarantee commission
should prove he exercised due diligence in the collection of the
credit, and the credit is not collected for example, because of the
fault of the third party, the agent is freed from responsibility.
In such an eventuality, the debtor can be directly proceeded
against by the principal. The principal need not fear in this
case that the debtor can put up defenses which he (the debtor)
could have set up against the agent. (See 3 Echavarri 111)

Does Art. 1907 include both cash and credit sales?
ANS.: Yes, since the law makes no distinction. Moreover,
there are cash sales which may give a short term or period.

One way of showing due diligence is by making use at

If the agent receives a guarantee commission, he cannot
put up the defense that the debtor-third person possesses
property. This is precisely the risk the commission agent
assumed. This bother need not worry the principal. (See
Echavarri 112)

Art. 1909. The agent is responsible not only for fraud,
but also for negligence, which shall be judged with more or
less rigor by the courts, according to whether the agency
was or was not for a compensation.

the credits of his principal at the time when they become
due and demandable shall be liable for damages, unless he

(2) Duty of Agent to Insure

If an agent is instructed to insure the goods under his
custody, and he does not do so, he is responsible, but if no
such obligation has been imposed by the principal, the agent
cannot be held liable because the obligation to insure is not
one of the duties required by the law to be performed by the
agent. (International Films [China] v. Lyric Film Exchange,

Art. 1909

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(3) Some Decided Cases

International Films (China) v.
Lyric Film Exchange
63 Phil. 778

FACTS: The Lyric Film Exchange leased a film entitled
“Monte Carlo Madness" from the International Films (China)
through the latter’s agent named Gabelman. After the film
had been shown, the Exchange through Vicente Albo, chief
of its film department, asked the company where the film
was to be returned. Gabelman replied that the film should
be deposited in the vaults of the Exchange. Later, the film
was destroyed by accidental fire without fault on the part
of the Exchange or its employees. The Exchange had NOT
insured the film, but there was NO stipulation that it should
do so. International Films (China) then sued the Exchange
for damages.

HELD: Granting that Albo of the Exchange was a sub¬
agent of International Films insofar as the custody of the
film was concerned, still Albo and the Exchange were not in
any way negligent. The fact that the film was not insured
against fire does not constitute fraud or negligence on the
part of the defendant company because, as a sub-agent, it
had received no instruction to that effect from its principal
and the insurance of the film does not form a part of the

obligation imposed upon it by law.

Tan Tiong Teck v. La Comision de Valores

FACTS: A stock broker was ordered by his client, Tan
Tiong Teck, to sell the former’s mining shares (10,000) for
at least P0.15 each on June 15, 1957. Although the price
prevailing that day was P0.17-1/2 for each share, the broker
nevertheless still sold the shares for only P0.15 each. Is the
broker liable for the difference?
HELD: Yes, for an agent must act with the prudence of

price for the shares. The broker is, therefore, liable to his
principal.

7 Phil. 563

FACTS: Nepomuceno instructed his agent Heredia to
buy good real estate for P2,000, but unfortunately, although
Heredia was careful, the land he purchased had a questionable
title. Nepomuceno sued Heredia for the recovery of the P2,000.

HELD: The agent is not liable, for he had exercised
reasonable care and diligence in the pursuit of the agency.
Gutierrez Hermanos v. Oria
Hermanos and Co.
30 Phil. 491

FACTS: Oria Hermanos authorized its agent Gutierrez
Hermanos to insure against all war risks a stock of hemp in
Catarman, Samar. The agent complied with the instructions,
and had the goods insured with a London Company through
the latter’s Philippine representative, Stevenson & Co. The
hemp was eventually seized by insurgents, but the insurance
company refused to pay on the ground of certain fraudulent
concealments on the part of Oria Hermanos, the insured. When
Oria Hermanos could not recover in court the amount of the
insurance indemnity, it sued its agent for damages, including
the amount of the insurance indemnity, the premiums paid
and the expenses of litigation.

HELD: The agent should not be held liable, for it had
faithfully complied with all the instructions that had been
given to it. There was neither negligence nor deceit on the
part of the agent.

(the robbery) took place without the agent’s fault. Proof on this

point can be arrived at by mere preponderance of evidence.

with her merchandise but was dismayed to learn later that
the defendants had not paid for or registered any display
space in her name, nor were they authorized by the State
Fair Director to recruit participants. She said she incurred
losses as a result for which the defendants should be held
solidarity liable. Defendants denied White’s allegation that
they had deceived her. No display space was registered in her
name as she was only supposed to share the spaced leased
by Hontiveros. She was not allowed to display her goods in
that space because she had not paid her balance of $1,750 in
violation of their contract. Bedia made the particular averment
that she did not sign the participation contract on her own
behalf but as an agent of Hontiveros and that she had later
returned the advance payment of $500 to White. The trial
court dismissed the complaint against Hontiveros, but found
Bedia liable for fraud and awarded White actual and moral
damages. The Court of Appeals sustained the trial court.
ISSUE: In what capacity did Bedia enter into the
participation contract with White? Both the trial and appellate
courts held she was acting in her own personal behalf.
92

Art. 1911

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

,

HELD: The Supreme Court reversed and set aside the
decision of the Court of Appeals saying that Bedia acted as
agent of Hontiveros and held that White acknowledged that
Bedia was only acting for Hontiveros when it recruited her
as a participant in the Texas State Fair and charged her a
partial payment of $500. This amount was to be forfeited to
Hontiveros in case of cancellation by her of the agreement.
The fact that the contract was typewritten on the letterhead
stationery of Hontiveros bolsters this conclusion in the absence
of any showing that said stationery had been illegally used
by Bedia. Hontiveros itself has not repudiated Bedia’s agency
as it would have if she had really not signed in its name. In
the answer it filed with Bedia, it did not deny the latter’s
allegation that she was only acting as its agent when she
solicited White’s participation. If White had any doubt about
the capacity in which Bedia was acting, what she should
have done was verify the matter with Hontiveros. She did
not. Instead, she simply accepted Bedia’s representation that
she was an agent of Hontiveros and dealt with her as such.
Hence, White cannot now hold Bedia liable for acts performed
by her for and imputable to Hontiveros as her principal.
Since Bedia was not acting beyond the scope of her authority
when she entered into the Participation Contract on behalf
of Hontiveros, it is the latter that should be held answerable
for any obligation arising from the agreement. By moving to
dismiss the complaint against Hontiveros, White virtually
disarmed herself and forfeited whatever claim she might have
proved against the latter under the contract signed for it by
Bedia.

Art. 1911. Even when the agent has exceeded his
authority, the principal is solidarity liable with the agent
if the former allowed the latter to act as though he had
full powers.

(1) Liability of Principal Because of Estoppel

Reason for the law: The principal may be said to be in
estoppel and therefore innocent third persons should not be
prejudiced. It cannot be denied that here, the principal failed
to adapt the needed measures to prevent misrepresentation.
93

Arte. 1912-1913

(2) Solidary Liability

This is an instance when solidarity is imposed by law.
It would seem, however, that this Article is unjust for if the
agent is considered innocent and acting within the scope of
his authority, he should be exempted from liability. (See Art.

COMMENT:
Principal to Compensate Agent for Damages

1897)

(a)

This Article is based on equity, and applies even if the
agency be gratuitous, as a matter of fact, even more so.

(b)

Naturally, this Article can be made use of only if the
agency exists, otherwise the Article cannot apply. In such
a case, the supposed agent is not acting on behalf of a
true principal, and the reason for the law would cease.
(Albaladejo y Cia v. Phil. Refining Co., 45 Phil. 556)

Art. 1912. The principal must advance to the agent,
should the latter so request, the sums necessary for the
execution of the agency.
Should the agent have advanced them, the principal
must reimburse him therefor, even if the business or
undertaking was not successful, provided the agent is free
from all fault.

The reimbursement shall include interest on the sums
advanced, from the day on which the advance was made.

COMMENT:
(1) Advancing of Necessary Funds
(a) Failure of the agency through no fault of the agent must
be borne solely by the principal. It is unfair to hold this
failure against an innocent agent.
(b) Even if the agency be gratuitous, this Article will
also apply; hence, the agent will still be entitled to
reimbursement and interest. This is so because the
reimbursement and interest spoken of in this Article do
not refer to compensation or commission. (See Fortis v.
Gutierrez Hermanos, 6 Phil. 100)
(2) Broker’s Fee

A broker is entitled to a commission if the sale is effected,
but not if there is no perfected transaction. (See Perez v. Luzon

Art. 1915. If two or more persons have appointed an

COMMENT:
(1) Solidary Liability of Principals
Solidarity is the rule under this Article because of
the common transaction. Thus, even if the agent has been
appointed separately, the rule should apply in the interest of

justice.

solidary liability. Of course, if X pays the Pl ,500,000,
he can recover reimbursement of P500.000 each from Y
and W.
(b)

C, D, and E appoint F as their agent to sell their separate
houses. The liability of C, D and E are merely joint
and not solidary even if the appointment is made in
one instrument. This is because this is NOT a common
transaction or undertaking.

(8) Case

‘7,

Constante Amor de Castro v. Court of Appeals
•

GR 115838, July 18, 2002

The rule in Art. 1915 applies even when the appointments
were made by the principals in separate acts, provided that
they are for the same transaction. The solidarity arises from
the common interest of the principals, and not from the act
of constituting agency.

> t

By virtue of this solidarity, the agent can recover from
any principal the whole compensation and indemnity owing
to him by the others. The parties, however, may, by express
agreement, negate this solidary responsibility. The solidarity
does not disappear by the mere partition effected by the
principals after the accomplishment of the agency.
If the undertaking is one in which several are interested,
but only some create the agency, only the latter are solidarity
liable, without prejudice to the effects of negotiorum gestio
with respect to the others. And, if the power granted includes
various transactions some of which are common and others
are not, only those interested in each transaction shall be
liable for it.

“(i]n such cases [labor only contracting], the person

QUESTION (When Both Principal and Agent Contract
with Respect to the Same Thing)
On Jan. 31, 2000, A who owns a piece of agricultural land
gave a general power of attorney to B. On Feb. 20, 2005, A,
without the knowledge of B, executed in favor of C a special
power of attorney to sell said piece of land. On Feb. 25, 2005,
B as attomey-in-fact of A, executed a deed of sale in favor
of D. On the same date, Feb. 25, 2005, C, under the special
power given by A, sold the same piece of land to E.
Assuming that the vendees have not yet registered their
respective documents or have taken possession of the land,
which of the two sales is valid and enforceable and who is
responsible for damages if any? Reasons.

ANS.: The sale by C in favor of E is valid and enforceable
because C was specifically granted authority to sell. B, who
only had a general power of attorney had NO right to sell,
since selling ordinarily is not a mere act of administration.
Moreover, under Art. 1878, a special power of attorney is
needed to effectuate a sale. If anyone is liable for damages,
it is certainly B who performed an unauthorized thing.

Ordinarily, the death of the principal terminates the
agency, even if a period had been stipulated and such period
has not yet ended. (See Gabin, et al. v. Villanueva, CA., 5 O.G.
5749) However, under Art. 1931, “anything done by the agent,
without knowledge of the death of the principal or of any other
cause which extinguishes the agency, is VALID and shall be
fully effective with respect to third persons who may have
contracted with him in good faith.” (See Manuel Buason, et al.

(3) By the death, civil interdiction, insanity or
insolvency of the principal or of the agent;

FACTS: Dayao authorized in 1930 his agent Bayuga
to sell a particular parcel of land. This authority to sell was
annotated on the original certificate of title of the registered
land. Dayao died in 1934, and in 1939, his children sold the
land to Buason. This sale was never registered. In 1944,
Bayuga, who did not know of the death of Dayao, sold the same
land to Panuyas, an innocent purchaser for value. This 1944
sale was duly registered. Buason now seeks to cancel the sale
to Panuyas.

entrusted or accepted the agency;

By the accomplishment of the object or purpose of
the agency;

better right to the land. In case of double sale of land, he, who
first recorded the sale in good faith, has a better right. While it
is true that the death of Dayao in 1934 terminated the agent’s
authority to sell the land, still under Art. 1738 of the old Civil
Code, “anything done by the agent, without knowledge of the
death of the principal or of any other cause which extinguishes

who is not a party thereto, it being obligatory only on the
principal who created the agency.) (New Manila Lumber

principal can still revoke, but he can be held liable for

Agency for Contracting With Specified Persons
(a) So that innocent third parties may not be prejudiced, the
principal who fails to give the notification can be held

If the first agent is not notified of the appointment of the
second agent, it is understood that the first agency still
exists. (Garcia v. De Manzano, 39 Phil. 577)

The rule applies only in case of incompatibility, because
it may be that the only desire of the principal is for him and
the agent to manage the business together. In case of true
inconsistency, the agency is revoked, for there would no longer
be any basis therefor. (11 Manresa 574)

such revocation may be express or implied, and may be availed
of even if the period fixed in the contract of agency has not
yet expired. As the principal has this absolute right to revoke
the agency, the agent cannot object thereto; neither may he
claim damages arising from such revocation, unless it is shown
that such was done in order to evade the payment of agent’s
commission.

In the case at bar, CMS appointed DRACOR as its agent for
the sale of its logs to Japanese firms. Yet, during the existence
of the contract of agency, DRACOR admitted that CMS sold its
logs directly to several Japanese firms. This act constituted an
implied revocation of the contract of agency under Art. 1924 of
the Civil Code. And since the contract of agency was revoked
by CMS when it sold its logs to Japanese firms without the
intervention of DRACOR, the latter is no longer entitled to its
commission from the proceeds of such sale and is not entitled to

retain whatever moneys it may have received as its commission
for said transactions. Neither would DRACOR be entitled to
collect damages from CMS, since damages are generally not
awarded to the agent for the revocation of the agency, and the
case at bar is not one falling under the exception mentioned,
which is to evade the payment of the agent’s commission.

Be it noted that the act of a contractor who, after
executing powers of attorney in favor of another empowering
the latter to collect whatever amounts may be due to him from
the Government, and, thereafter, demanded and collected from
the government the money the collection of which he entrusted

to his attomey-in-fact, constituted revocation of the agency in

While a contract of agency is generally revocable at will
as it is primarily based on trust and confidence, Art. 1927 of
the Civil Code provides the instances when an agency becomes
irrevocable.
(2) When an Agency Cannot Be Revoked

This enumerates three instances of irrevocability:
(a)
i1 •>

•

.

If a bilateral contract depends upon the agency.
<

EXAMPLE 1: P wanted to make A his surety so P
made A his agent as a sort of inducement to safeguard him
from eventual loss. Under American Law, this is referred
to as an agency or authority necessary to effectuate a
security; it is also an agency or authority coupled with an
interest. (2 C.J. 530-531 )

EXAMPLE 2: A power to sell, where the property is
delivered to the agent to dispose of it for the protection
of himself and other creditors is an authority coupled
with an interest, and therefore irrevocable, provided the
107

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1927

interest is indicated in the power of attorney. (Del Rosario
v. Abad, 104 Phil. 648)
EXAMPLE 3: If the agency is only a clause or a part
of a reciprocal contract. Reasons: The contract itself and,
therefore, also the clause on the agency, cannot generally
be revoked except through mutual consent. (11 Manresa
572)

(b)

If the agency is the means of fulfilling an obligation
already contracted.
EXAMPLE: Sonia is indebted to Concepcion for
the purchase of a diamond headband. But, Sonia in the
meantime has no money. So, she appoints Concepcion as
her agent to collect from Maria some money which Maria
owes her (Sonia), which money, in turn, will be applied
to the purchase price of the headband. It is clear that
Sonia cannot revoke the agency here, unless she first pays
Concepcion.

(3) Case

FACTS: S and B entered into a shipping agency
contract whereby S has been appointed as a shipping
agent for B. Later, B opened its own branch office which,
in effect, revoked the contract of agency.
HELD: The revocation of the contract of agency is
not sanctioned by law because the agency is the means by
which S could fulfill his obligation.

two years in order to pay the company for its help in acquiring
the vessels, at the end of said two years, the Government may
end the agency. (De la Rama Steamship Co. v. Tan, et al., 99
Phil. 1034)
Art. 1928. The agent may withdraw from the agency
by giving due notice to the principal. If the latter should
suffer any damage by reason of the withdrawal, the agent
must indemnify him therefor, unless the agent should base
his withdrawal upon the impossibility of continuing the
performance of the agency without grave detriment to
himself.

AFTER the interest terminates. So, if the Government allows

so also may an agent withdraw under Art. 1928.

Reasons of health can justify withdrawal by the agent.
(De la Rama u. Hidalgo, 16 Phil. 450)

(2) Effect When Agent Sues Principal

When an agent files a complaint against the principal for
a monetary claim in the former’s favor, dignity and decorum
will not ordinarily permit the continuation of the agency. Such
a complaint is therefore equivalent to withdrawal of the agent
from the agency. (Valera v. Velasco, 51 Phil. 695)
Art. 1929. The agent, even if he should withdraw from
the agency for a valid reason, must continue to act until
the principal has had reasonable opportunity to take the
necessary steps to meet the situation.

Art. 1930. The agency shall remain in full force and
effect even after the death of the principal, if it has been
constituted in the common interest of the latter and of the
agent, or in the interest of a third person who has accepted
the stipulation in his favor.

This Article speaks of an agency:

coupled with a common interest;

coupled with the interest of a third person who has
accepted the stipulation in his favor.

EXAMPLE of COMMON interest:
Zenaida borrows from Jose, and as security, entrusts to
Jose a ring, which Jose can sell in case Zenaida fails to pay the
debt at the time of maturity. Even if Zenaida dies, the agency
of Jose would still remain. (See Pasno v. Ravina, et al., 54 Phil.
378)

EXAMPLE of Interest of a THIRD PERSON:
Melady sells his land to Bravo and appoints Bravo his
agent in paying with the purchase price what Melady owes
Arellano, a third person. Here, even when Melady dies, the
agency of Bravo continues to exist.

(2) Agency Coupled With an Interest

It is a well-settled general rule that if the authority of
an agent is coupled with an interest, it is not revocable by the
death, act, or condition of the principal, unless there is some
agreement to the contrary between the parties. This is a wellrecognized exception to the rule that the death of the principal
revokes the authority of an agent appointed by him. (2 Am.
Jur. 61-63) However, it must be noted that an agent whose
agency is coupled with an interest cannot stand on a better
ground than a partner appointed as manager in the articles
of partnership insofar as revocability of authority or power is
110

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1930

concerned. Inasmuch as a partner appointed as manager in the
articles of partnership can be divested of his power if there is
a just or lawful cause, it follows that an agent whose agency
is coupled with an interest can also be stripped of his power of
attorney, if there is a JUST CAUSE. (Coleongco v. Claparols,
L-18616, March 31, 1964)
(3) Nature of the Agent’s Interest

In order that a power may be irrevocable because it is
coupled with an interest, it is necessary that the interest shall
be in the subject matter of the power and not in the proceeds
which will arise from the exercise of the power. The person
clothed with the power must derive under the instrument
creating it, or from the nature of the relation, a present or
future interest in the thing or subject itself on which the power
is to be exercised, and not merely that which is produced by the
exercise of the power. (2 Am. Jur. 61-63)
(4) Interest is Not the Share in the Profits or the Commission

Power has been held NOT to be coupled with an interest
where the interest arises out of commission or out of the
proceeds of a transaction as where the agent’s interest
is merely his right to receive, by way of compensation, a
certain percentage of the proceeds. (2 C.J. 532-533)
(b) But, a power to make a collection or sale out of the
proceeds to pay an existing debt due to the agent from
the principal is a power coupled with an interest, as it
is also an interest, as is also an authority to the agent to
reimburse himself from such proceeds for advances made
to the principal. It has also been held that authority to
loan money and to collect the same and account for all
over a given percent, which the agent is to retain as his
compensation is authority coupled with an interest. (2
(a)

C.J. 532-533)

(5) The Entire Agreement to Be Construed

Whether an interest which will make the agency or power
irrevocable exists in a particular case is to be determined from
the entire agreement between the parties, and from the facts
111

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1930

and circumstances attending the relation existing between the
parties. The terminology used by the parties is not controlling;
even though an agency or power is made in terms irrevocable,
that fact will not prevent its revocation by the principal where
the agency or power is not in fact, coupled with an interest.
Nor will the fact of a stipulation in the instrument that the
intention of the grantor of the power is that it shall be construed
as a power of attorney coupled with an interest in the subject
matter thereof prevent its revocation. (2 Am. Jur. 61-63)
Eulogio del Rosario, et al. v. Abad and Abad
104 Phil. 648

FACTS: In 1937, Tiburcio del Rosario borrowed from
Primitive Abad P2,000 with 12% interest payable in 1941.
Tiburcio mortgaged the improvements of a parcel of land in
favor of his creditor. On the same day that he obtained the loan,
Tiburcio executed an “irrevocable special power of attorney
coupled with an interest” in favor of Abad, the mortgagee,
authorizing him among other things, to sell and convey the
parcel of land, without however indicating in the document the
purpose of the agency to sell. In 1945, the mortgagor died, with
the debt still unpaid. In 1947, Primitive, acting as attorneyin-fact of Tiburcio, sold the land to his (Primitive's) son in
consideration of Pl and the extinguishment of the mortgage
debt. The heirs of Tiburcio claim that the sale is not valid
for it was made after Tiburcio’s death, and they now desire
to recover the possession and ownership of the land. Abad,
however, counters that death did not extinguish the agency
because by express provision of the power of attorney it was
irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

HELD: The sale is not valid because the principal had
already died when it was made. The agency was certainly not
one coupled with an interest. The mere mention of the interest
in the power of attorney is not enough. The power of attorney
should have stated what precisely the interest consisted of.
The mere fact that the improvements on the land had been
mortgaged in favor of Abad, which fact, incidentally, was not
even mentioned in the power of attorney, is immaterial. The
mortgage of the improvements had nothing to do with the
power of attorney. The proper remedy of Abad is to foreclose
112

Arte. 1931-1932

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

the mortgage, and not to avail himself of the power of attorney.
As the agency was not coupled with an interest, it ended on
Tiburcio’s death, and the subsequent sale of the land cannot be
considered valid.

Art. 1931. Anything done by the agent, without
knowledge of the death of the principal or of any other
cause which extinguishes the agency, is valid and shall be
fully effective with respect to third persons who may have
contracted with him in good faith.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Agent’s Act Without Knowledge of the

Termination of the Agency

Note that the law here requires the third persons to be
in good faith. If in bad faith, they cannot be protected. (See
Buason v. Panuyas, 105 Phil. 795, cited under Art. 1919)
(2) Rule in Case Business was Already Begun

Under the second paragraph of Art. 1884, the agent “must
also finish the business already begun on the death of the
principal should delay entail any danger.”

Art. 1932. If the agent dies, his heirs must notify the
principal thereof, and in the meantime adopt such measures
as the circumstances may demand in the interest of the

latter.

COMMENT:
(1) Death of the Agent
If the heirs of the dead agent are unable to give notice, one
good measure for them to do is to consign the object or property
of the agency in court. In this way, they can still protect the

interests of the principal, who trusted their predecessor in
interest. The heir’s duty arises from what may be termed as a
presumed agency or tacit agency or an agency by operation of
law. (See 11 Manresa 588)

(2) Effect of Agent’s Death in Case of Agency Coupled with

an Interest

।

In an agency coupled with an interest, does the death of
the agent terminate the agency?

ANS.: Generally, the agent’s death ends the agency for it
should not be continued by one upon whom the principal has
reposed no confidence (See 11 Manresa 586-587), but under
American Law, when the agency is coupled with an interest,
it has been held that the agent’s death does not terminate the
agency; such a power may be subsequently exercised by his
personal representative, at least insofar as may be essential to
protect the interests of the estate of the agent. (2 C.J. 551)

TITLE XI
LOAN
(1) Introductory Comment

I

Title XI of the Civil Code begins the subject known in law
courses as “credit transactions.” “Credit” in this connection
refers to belief or trust by a person in another’s ability to
comply with an obligation; and “credit transactions” refers to
the contracts or agreements based on said trust or credit.
(2) Scope of Credit Transactions

The subject involves:
(a) The PRINCIPAL contracts of loan (both commodatum
and mutuum) and deposit (these are of course founded on
“belief or “faith” or “trust”).
(b) The ACCESSORY contracts which generally depend on
the existence of the aforementioned contracts and which
tends to strengthen said “belief” or “trust” because of the

security given:

(c)

personal guaranty (a person’s personal credit is
involved as in guaranty proper and suretyship)
2) real guaranty (here the “belief” is strengthened with
the use of property if real property, the contracts of
real mortgage and antichresis; if personal property,
the contracts of pledge and chattel mortgage).
Preference and concurrence of credits.

Bailment of Loan
Insofar as the borrower is concerned, the cause is the
acquisition of the thing; insofar as the lender is concerned,
it is the right to require the return of the same thing or
its
equivalent. If despite the issuance of a check to the prospective
borrower, the money is not given, there is NO contract of loan.
(Monte de Piedad v. Javier, et al., CA.
36 O.G. 2176)
to ‘LOANS’

The ability to borrow money or thing by virtue of
the
confidence or trust reposed by a lender that the borrower will
pay what he may promise (People v. Concepcion,
44 Phil. 126)
is called “CREDIT” derived from the
Latin “credere,” meaning
“to

to return a thing deposited rendered the depositary liable to
imprisonment, but this would not be the case if the contract is
one of loan and not of deposit. Now then, one Plaza deposited
with Chuatongco a sum of money, to be repaid with interest.
The Court ordered the latter to deposit in the Postal Savings
Bank in the name of the giver of the money. Chuatongco failed
to comply with this and he was therefore ordered jailed. Was

the arrest and imprisonment proper?
HELD: No, because this was a loan and not a deposit.
Although it was not expressly agreed that Chuatongco could
use the money, this can nevertheless be inferred from the fact
that Chuatongco was obliged to pay interest.

Government v. Phil. Sugar Estate Dev. Co.
38 Phil. 15

FACTS: Under the Corporation Law, a sugar corporation
cannot invest in a corporation dealing with real estate, but
can grant a loan to the latter. If a corporation should do this,
its franchise can be revoked. Now then, the Philippine Sugar
Estate Dev. Co. delivered to the Tayabas Land Company about
P300,000 which the government contended to be contribution
119

Art. 1933

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

of the sugar company to the land company, but which the sugar
company alleged to be a mere loan. In the contract, no date was
fixed for the return of the money; furthermore, there would be
no interest or profit till after the principal had been paid.

HELD: The money was given as an investment and not as
a loan. It is difficult to see how this contract can be considered
a loan. There was no date fixed for the return to be made for
the money. Furthermore, the sugar company was not to receive
anything for the use of said sum until after the capital had
been fully repaid, which is not consistent with the general
idea of loan. It is not impossible to provide that the capital be
repaid, but the usual method is to pay the interest first.
(11) ‘Loan’ Distinguished from Discounting of a Paper*

To discount a paper is a mode of loaning money, with
these distinctions:
(a) In a discount, interest is deducted in advance, while in a
loan, interest is taken at the expiration of a credit;
(b) A discount is always on double-name paper, a loan is
generally on single-name paper. (People v. Concepcion, 44

Art. 1934. An accepted promise to deliver something
by way of commodatum or simple loan is binding upon the
parties, but the commodatum or simple loan itself shall not
be perfected until the delivery of the object of the contract.
COMMENT:
(1) Nature of the Contract of Loan

Commodatum and loan are real contracts. They are
perfected by the delivery of the object loaned. On the other
hand, consensual contracts are perfected by mere consent
(Art. 1316, Civil Code)

The borrower and the lender must of course consent
either personally or through an authorized agent, as in every
obligation founded upon a contract. However, the necessary
acceptance need not be actual but may be implied from
circumstances. (3 RCL 81)
(4) Consensual Contract of Future Loans

Aside from the real contracts of commodatum and loan,
there can also be a consensual contract created by an accepted
promise to deliver something by way of commodatum or simple
loan.
Example: A promised to lend Pl,000,000 to B. The
promise was accepted by B. This contract (consensual) is
already binding upon the parties so that if A does not fulfill his
promise, B has the right to demand compliance thereof. But
note here, that the real contract of loan does not yet exist.
(5) MCQ

A loan agreement contains the following provision:

“Interest: The Borrower shall pay interest, computed
and compounded monthly. The Lender shall have the right to
adjust the interest rate on the Loan every 30 days from date
hereof based on changes in: (i) prevailing interest rates of the
top three commercial banks in the Ortigas Center in Pasig
City for similar loans and time deposits; (ii) Philippine pesoeuro exchange rate; (iii) inflation rate; and (iv) other relevant
economic and financial factors.”

Is the provision valid?

A.

Yes, because there is a reasonable adjustment
formula.

B.

Yes, because of the principle of autonomy of
contracts.

C.

No, because there is no declaration clause.

D.

No, because it violates the mutuality of contracts.

(2) Need for Delivery

To effect either a commodatum or a mutuum, a delivery,
either real or constructive, is essential. This is so because
unless there is delivery, the borrower in commodatum (for
example) cannot exercise due diligence over the thing loaned.

Commodatum is a real, principal, essentially gratuitous,
personal

contract where one of the parties (called the bailor

non-consumable object, so that the latter may USE the same
for a certain period and later return it. (See Arts. 1933 and
1935)

(2) Example of Commodatum Involving Land

(8) What Bailee (Borrower) in Commodatum Acquires

Commodatum gives the right to the use (jus utendi)
and not the right to the fruits (jus fruendi); otherwise, the
contract may be one of usufruct. But of course, a stipulation
that the bailee may make use of the fruits of the thing loaned
is valid. (Art. 1940) In such a case, however, the right to get
the fruits is merely incidental and not the main cause of the

'

contract.
(4) Spanish Terms

Bailor in commodatum (lender) is called comodatario
in Spanish, bailee in commodatum (borrower) is termed
comodante.

Art. 1936. Consumable goods may be the subject of
commodatum if the purpose of the contract is not the
consumption of the object, as when it is merely for exhibition.

COMMENT:
Bailor (Lender) Need Not Be the Owner
Reason for the law: The contract of commodatum does
not transfer ownership. All that is required is that the bailor
has the right to the use of the property which he is lending,
and that he be allowed to alienate this right to use. Hence,
in lease for example, a lessee may become a sub-lessor, unless
he has been expressly prohibited to do so in the contract of
lease. (Art. 1650, Civil Code)

Note that this provision has a counterpart in the contract
of lease, except when they are merely to be exhibited or when
they are accessory to an industrial establishment. (Art. 1645)

(2) Counterpart in the Contract of Lease

1

A borrowed B’s land so that he can erect thereon a small
barong-barong to be used for the time that A works in B’s
province. If there is no rental this is a case of commodatum,
but if rental is paid, this would be a lease.
(NOTE: In one case a person asked his brother’s
permission to erect on the latter’s land a house. The Supreme
Court said that this was not a commodatum since no time
for the use of land was specified. And this was so, even if the
parties had denominated the contract as commodatum, for
contracts must be interpreted by their constitutive elements as
defined and denominated by law, and not by the name given
by the parties. [Mina v. Pascual, 25 Phil. 540] However, under
the Civil Code the contract may be regarded as a particular
namely a PRECARIUM. [See Art.

COMMENT:
(1) Subject Matter of Commodatum
Usually, only non-consumable goods may be the object
of a commodatum for the thing itself should not be consumed
and must be returned, but when a jar of vinegar is given
merely for exhibition, the thing itself is not consumed. It is
only used ad ostentationem. Note that the vinegar in this case
is non-fungible, for the same vinegar must be returned.

,

FACTS: Mercado, the occupant of a stall in the Batangas
market, allowed Aguilar to occupy the same gratuitously with
the promise of Aguilar to return it upon demand. Aguilar
claims that Mercado has no right to demand because Mercado,
being a mere lessee of the Batangas municipality had no right
to cede its occupancy in commodatum.
129

Art 1939

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

HELD: Mercado had the right to give it in commodatum.
If a lessee, by a contract of a sub-lease, may transfer to another
the enjoyment of the thing leased for a consideration, there
is no reason why he should be unable to cede gratuitously
its use to the commodatory. Aguilar should return the stall.
Art. 1939. Commodatum is purely personal in character.

Consequently:
(1) The death of either the bailor or the bailee
extinguishes the contract;
(2) The bailee can neither lend nor lease the object
of the contract to a third person. However, the members of
the bailee’s household may make use of the thing loaned,
unless there is a stipulation to the contrary, or unless the
nature of the thing forbids such use.

COMMENT:
(1) Personal Nature of Commodatum
Under the old Civil Code, the obligations and rights
arising from the commodatum descended to the heirs of both
contracting parties unless the loan was made in consideration
of the person of the borrower. (Art. 1742, old Civil Code) The
new Civil Code changes this rule by considering commodatum
as purely personal. (Art. 1939, new Civil Code) This is so even
if commodatum is a real contract (Arts. 1316 and 1934) and
constitutes an exception to the rule that all rights acquired
by virtue of an obligation are transmissible. (Art. 1178, Civil

Arts 1940-1941

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

the children of B in his household may use the same unless
there is a stipulation to the contrary. But, said component
cannot be used as a chair, because the nature of the thing
forbids such use.

Art. 1940. A stipulation that the bailee may make use
of the fruits of the thing loaned is valid.

COMMENT:
(1) Does Bailee Have the Right to Use the Fruits?
(a)
\

As a rule, the bailee is not entitled to the fruits, otherwise
the contract may be one of usufruct. It should be noted
that the right to use is distinct from the right to enjoy
the fruits, since under the law, fruits should as a rule
pertain to the owner of the thing producing the fruits.
(Art. 441, Civil Code)

However, to stipulate that the bailee makes use of the
fruits would not destroy the essence of a commodatum,
for liberality is still the actual cause or consideration of
the contract.

(b)

(2) Example

A is the bailee in commodatum of B’s land. Incidentally,
they may stipulate that A can get some lanzones from a
lanzones tree on the land. Unless there is such a stipulation,
A would not be entitled to the lanzones.

OBLIGATIONS OF THE BAILEE

Art. 1941. The bailee is obliged to pay for the ordinary
expenses for the use and preservation of the thing loaned.

COMMENT:
(1) Duty of Borrower to Pay Ordinary Expenses

the identical thing (Art. 1933), so he is obliged to take care
of the thing with, as a rule, the diligence of a good father

from that for which it has been loaned;
(2) If he keeps it longer than the period stipulated, or
after the accomplishment of the use for which commodatum
has been constituted;

Paragraph 5
This amounts to an act of ingratitude

A misuse or abuse of the property is ordinarily a

Art. 1943. The bailee does not answer for the deterioration
of the thing loaned due only to the use thereof and without
his fault.

COMMENT:
Non-liability for Deterioration Without Fault
The reason for the Article is obvious.

Art. 1944. The bailee cannot retain the thing loaned on
the ground that the bailor owes him something, even though
it may be by reason of expenses. However, the bailee has a
right of retention for damages mentioned in Article 1951.

A commodatum is for a certain time. (Art. 1933) This is

This is based on equitable grounds for otherwise, the bailee

A bailor usually lends his property because he does not
need it. Hence, the reason for the exception. NOTE that the
return may be only temporary, but it can also be permanent.
This is so because the law uses “its return (meaning permanent)
or temporary use.” “Or temporary use” was a phrase added
by the Code Commission. The gratuitous use by the borrower
must yield the necessity of the lender. This follows naturally
from the gratuitous nature of a commodatum. (Art. 1948)

OBLIGATIONS OF THE BAILOR
Art. 1946. The bailor cannot demand the return of
the thing loaned till after the expiration of the period
stipulated, or after the accomplishment of the use for which
the commodatum has been constituted. However, if in the
meantime, he should have urgent need of the thing, he may
demand its return or temporary use.

In case of temporary use by the bailor, the contract
of commodatum is suspended while the thing is in the

Art 1948. The bailor may demand the immediate return
of the thing if the bailee commits any act of ingratitude
specified in Article 765.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Commission of Act of Ingratitude

The bailor can demand IMMEDIATE RETURN.

(a)

As a rule, the extraordinary expenses should be paid by
the bailor because it is he who profits by said expenses;
otherwise, the thing borrowed would be destroyed.

Cb)

Generally, notice is required because the bailor should
be given discretion as to what he wants to do with his
own property.

(2) Reason for the Second Paragraph (Actual Use by Bailee)

(2) Grounds of Ingratitude

This is an equitable solution. The bailee pays one half
because of the benefit derived from the use of the thing loaned
to him, and the bailor pays the other half because he is the
owner and the thing will be returned to him (Report of the
Code Commission, p. 151)

Art. 765 provides:

“The donation may also be revoked at the instance of
the donor, by reason of ingratitude in the following cases:
“(1) If the donee should commit some offense against
the person, the honor or the property of the donor, or of his
wife or children under his parental authority;

“(2) If the donee imputes to the donor any criminal
offense, or any act involving moral turpitude, even though

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Bailor’s Abandonment or Giving of the Object

Example:

For extraordinary expenses on A’s car, B the borrower
spent P125.000. A cannot exempt himself from payment thereof
by just giving B the thing borrowed.
(2) Reason for the Law

EXAMPLE:

A lent B a Fisher & Paykel, the electric connections of
which were defective. If although he knows said defect, A does
not inform B thereof, A will be liable in case B is injured by
reason thereof.

The value of the thing borrowed might be less than the
value of the expenses or damages.

(2) Reason for the Law

When a person lends, he ought to confer a benefit, and
not to do a mischief. If he does not reveal the flaws, he is
liable for his bad faith. ( Gagnon v. Dana, 39 Ail. 982)
(NOTE: But the obligation of a gratuitous lender goes no
further than this, and he cannot therefore be made liable for
not communicating anything which he did not know, whether
he ought to have known it or not. [Gagnon v. Dana, supra])

(3) Right of Retention

For the damages spoken of in this Article, the bailee has
the right of retention until paid of said damages. (Art. 1944,

(4) Nature of the Flaws

It is evident that the flaws referred to in this Article
are hidden defects, not obvious ones.

(1) Ownership Passes in Mutuum

Ownership passes to the borrower, but, of course, he must
pay later.

(2) If a loan money is given only sometime after the
execution of a mortgage, the mortgage is still valid. After
all, the promissory note is only evidentiary of the debt. The
late execution of the promissory note does not mean that the
mortgage had no consideration.
(2) Similarity to Abnormal Usufruct

Mutuum is similar to an abnormal usufruct.
Republic v. Jose Grijaldo
L-20240, Dec. 31, 1965

FACTS: In 1943, Jose Grijaldo borrowed money from a
bank, evidenced by five promissory notes, and secured by a
chattel mortgage on the standing crops on his land. During the
war, the crops were destroyed as a result of enemy action.

ISSUE: Must the borrower still pay?
HELD: Yes, for his obligation was to pay a generic thing
money representing the loan with interest. The chattel
mortgage on the crops simply stood as security for the fulfillment
of his obligations, and therefore, the loss of the crops did NOT
extinguish his obligation to pay, because the account can still
be paid from sources other than said mortgaged crops.

much is Castro liable?

The “behest” nature of the loans could not be reasonably

blame the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC), the Regional Trial
Court (RTC), and the Court of Appeals (CA) for their failure to
understand or release the fact that a monthly credit statement
of account does not always necessarily involve purchases or
transactions made immediately prior to the issuance of such
statement?

HELD: (1) Credit card arrangements are simple loan
arrangements between the card issuer and the cardholder.
142

Art. 1954

(2)

No. The Supreme Court held that-

“(clertainly, it may be that the cardholer did not at
all use the credit card for the month, and the statement
of account sent to him or her refers to principal, inter¬
est, and penalty charges incurred from past transactions
which are too multiple or cumbersome to enumerate but
nonetheless remain unsettled by the cardholder.

—

Since a credit card is
“any card, plate, coupon book, or other credit device
existing for the purpose of obtaining money, goods, prop¬
erty, labor or devices or services or anything of value on
credit.” - it is considered an access device.
Under Sec. 9 (a) and (e) of RA 8484, the possession and
use of an access device is not illegal. Rather what is prohibited
is the possession and use of a counterfeit access device. Thus,
both possession and use, respectively, of a counterfeit access
device, are punishable by imprisonment.

of this Code.
If what was loaned is a fungible thing other than money,
the debtor owes another thing of the same kind, quantity
and quality, even if it should change in value. In case it is
impossible to deliver the same kind, its value at the time of
the perfection of the loan shall be paid.

(a)

Liability is governed by Arts. 1249 and 1250.

(b)

Art. 1249. The payment of debts in money shall be made
in the currency stipulated, and if it is not possible to
deliver such currency, then in the currency which is legal

The delivery of promissory notes payable to order,
or bills of exchange or other mercantile documents shall
produce the effect of payment only when they have been
cashed, or when through the fault of the creditor they
have been impaired.

In the meantime, the action derived from the original
obligation shall be held in abeyance.

expressly stipulated in writing.

COMMENT:

Pua v. Lo Bun Tiong
708 SCRA 571
Art. 1956, which refers to monetary interest, specifically
mandates that no interest shall be due unless it has been
expressly stipulated in writing.
(2) Formality for Interest (for Use of the Money)

The interest must be stipulated in WRITING. For
example, A borrowed Pl,000,000 from B. No mention was
made of interest. No interest can be charged. But if interest
had been stipulated upon, but no rate was mentioned, then it
is 12% per annum provided of course that the agreement as to
interest was made in writing.
(3) Kinds of Interest

Interest may be paid either as compensation for the use of
the money (monetary interests) or as damages (compensatory
interest). Article 1956 refers to interest for use of the money.
(4) How Interest Arises

•

The right to interest arises only by virtue of a contract
or by virtue of damages for delay or failure to pay principal
on which interest is demanded. (Barretto v. Santa Marina, 37

Phil. 568)

(5) When Interest Earns Interest

A borrowed from B five sacks of rice. At the time the loan
was perfected, each sack cost Pl,800. Even if at the time of
payment the price would change, five sacks of the same kind and

Interest due shall earn legal interest from the time it is

(6) Interest by Way of Damages
(a)

(7) Consolidation

Part of a contract said: “The first installment (payable in
three months) shall have no interest.” But, debtor was in
default. Should he pay interest for damages?
HELD: Yes, not interest for compensation but
interest for damages. “The trial court appears to have
considered that this stipulation deprived the plaintiff
of the right to interest after default, and no interest
whatever was allowed by him upon this installment.
This was error. The stipulation that this installment
should draw no interest was made in the expectation that
the obligation would be paid upon the date stipulated.
After default occurred, the defendant became liable for
interest as damages regardless of the statement that his
installment should draw no interest. This statement in
the contract was evidently intended merely to govern the
rights of the parties with respect to interest for the three¬
month period between the making of the contract and
the date when the installment was to become due. With
respect to the plaintiffs right to interest after default, the
situation is to be treated precisely as if nothing had been
said about interest at all.” (Zobel v. City of Manila, 47

Art. 1956

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Part of the contract reads: “The five latter installments
shall draw interest at the rate offivepercentper annum, payable
to the creditors upon the date when they shall respectively fall
due.” Debtor was in default. How will interest be computed?

I

I

HELD: Interest must be allowed thereon at the contract
rate of 5% per annum from the date of the contract; and the
interest that had accrued up to the date of the filing of the
complaint must be consolidated as to that date with the capital,
after which the whole shall bear interest at the contract rate of
five percent per annum until paid. Where interest is contracted
for at a given rate, the contract of obligation to pay interest is
not merged in the judgment but remains in full force until the
debt is paid. The circumstances that the rate stipulated was
less than the lawful rate does not alter the case. (Zobel v. City
of Manila, supra)

(8) Municipal Corporations are Liable for Interest

A municipal corporation does not enjoy immunity
from liability for interest when assessed as damages for the
non-payment of a debt, to the same extent as the national
government. (Zobel v. City of Manila, supra)

Phil. 169)
(b)

(c)

(9) Interest During the Moratorium Laws

In contracts for the payment of a sum of money, the
measure of damages for delay is limited to the interest
provided for by law. The deprivation of an opportunity
for making money, which might have proved beneficial or
might have been ruinous is of too uncertain a character to
be weighed in the even balances of the law. (Lopez v. Del
Rosario, 44 Phil. 98)

,

—

Art. 2209
If the obligation consists in the payment
of a sum of money, and the debtor incurs in delay, the
indemnity for damages, there being no stipulation to the
contrary, shall be the payment of the interest agreed
upon, and in the absence of stipulation, the legal interest,
which is six percent per annum. (The rate BEFORE was
12% per annum, but as per BSP Circular No. 799 the rate
NOW is 6% effective July 1, 2013.)
146

Interest ran during the moratorium laws. If debtors had
wanted to avoid liability for all the interest falling due during
the time that the moratorium laws were in effect, they could
have renounced the benefits of the said laws and paid the debts,
or in the very least paid the interest as they accrued. (Warner,
Barnes & Co. v. Yasay, et al., G.R. No. L-12984, July 26, 1960)
What the moratorium laws suspended was the running of the
period of prescription of actions. (Republic v. Grijaldo, L-20240,
Dec. 31, 1965) Interest during the war years however can be
eliminated if the creditors were enemies of the Japanese, for
their payment to them could not have been made. (Ibid.)

(10) Computations for Compensatory Damages

'

As already stated, this is interest not imposed for the use
of the money, but to serve as penalty or damages for the breach
147

3)

of contractual obligations. This kind of interest need not be
stipulated in writing, for the law gives the rate (6% per annum)
in the absence of agreement as to the penalty. (Art. 2209, Civil
Code) In the following examples, legal interest was computed
at 6% per annum. (Note, however that today the legal rate
is 6% per annum, per BSP Circular No. 799, effective July 1,

interest as penalty for the default (6% per year for a
period of three years since he has been in default
for three years).

(NOTE: In the problem given, no interest is charged
on the accrued interest — interest that has accumulated up
to the time demand is made because here the demand was
only extrajudicial. If the demand had been judicial, there
would have been an additional interest on the accrued
interest. The law says that “interest due shall earn legal
interest from the time it is judicially demanded, although
the obligation may be silent upon this point.” [Art. 2212,
Civil Code])

ANS.: B is not liable for interest for the use of
the money (since this was not stipulated in writing)
BUT he is Hable for interest in view of his default, as a
punishment or penalty by way of damages for his breach
of the contract. Please note that there is default after a
demand is made (either judicially or extrajudicially). (Art.
1169, Civil Code) The interest here given as penalty is
since there was no stipulation as to
6% per annum
the penalty. (Art. 2209, Civil Code) B has been in default
for two years (counted from the demand). Hence, he is
liable for interest (6%) for two years: 6% of Pl,000,000 =
P60,000 per year, P60.000 times two (years) = P120.000.
This is the interest that he must pay. (Ibid.)

Nakpil and Sons, et al. v. Court of Appeals
GR 47861, Resolution on Motion

for Reconsideration

FACTS: In a decision of the Supreme Court, finding
the architect and the contractor liable for gross negligence
(equivalent to bad faith) in effecting the plans and construction
of a building, imposed upon defendants a solidary indemnity
in favor of the plaintiff. The court added that “upon failure to
pay on such finality, 12% interest per annum shall be imposed
upon aforementioned amounts from finality until paid.” On
motion for reconsideration, the defendants alleged that the
interest of 12% per annum imposed on the total amount of the
monetary award contravenes the law, since there is neither
loan nor forbearance. Denying the motion for reconsideration,
the Supreme Court

—

HELD: It is true that in the instant case, there is neither
a loan or a forbearance, but then no interest is actually being
imposed provided the sums referred to in the judgment are paid
upon the finality of the judgment. It is delay in the payment of
such final judgment that will cause the imposition of interest.
The rate of interest is imposed on the total sum, from the
filing of the complaint until paid; in other words, as part of the
judgment for damages.

Art. 1957. Contracts and stipulations, under any cloak
or device whatever, intended to circumvent the laws against
usury shall be void. The borrower may recover in accordance
with the laws on usury.

COMMENT:
(1) Usury Law Should Not Be Circumvented
The Article is self-explanatory.
(2) What Constitutes Usury

Herrera v. Petrophil Corp.
GR 48349, Dec. 29, 1986
To constitute usury, there must be a loan or forbearance.
And something must be exacted for the use of money in excess
of and in addition to interest allowed by law.
Thus, the elements of usury are: (1) a loan express or
implied; (2) understanding between the parties that the money
lent shall or may be returned; (3) for such loan a greater rate of
151

Art. 1958

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

interest that is allowed by law shall be paid or agreed to be paid
as the case may be; and (4) corrupt intent to take more than the
legal rate for the use of money. Unless these four things concur
in every transaction, no case of usury can be declared.

(2) ‘Interest’ Is A Matter of Law

In Sy v. Local Government of Quezon City (697 SCRA
621), the Supreme Court had occasion to say that interest

—

“runs as a matter of law and follows from the right of the
landowner to be placed in as good position as many can
accomplish, as of the date of the taking.”

(3) Repeal of Usury Law

Central Bank (Bangko Sentral) Circular 905 has repealed
the Usury Law. Today, there is no more maximum rate of
interest. The rate will just depend on the mutual agreement of
the parties.

Liam Law v. Olympic Sawmill Co.
and Elino Lee Chi
L-30771, May 28, 1984

For some time now, usury has been legally non-existent.
Interest can now be charged as lender and borrower may agree

upon.

Art. 1959. Without prejudice to the provisions of Article

2212, interest due and unpaid shall not earn interest. However,
the contracting parties may by stipulation capitalize the

interest due and unpaid, which as added principal, shall
earn new interest.

COMMENT:
(1) When Accrued Interest Earns Interest

The general rule is that accrued interest (interest due and
unpaid) will not bear interest, BUT
(a)

if there is agreement to this effect (Art. 1959), or

(b)

if there is judicial demand. (Art. 2212)

(2017)

THEN such accrued interest will bear interest at the
legal rate (Art. 2212) unless, a different rate is stipulated.
(Hodges v. Regalado, 69 Phil. 588)

Although the Usury Law has been effectively repealed,
courts may still reduce iniquitous or unconscionable rates
charged for the use of money.

not revealed in disclosure statements issued by banks, even
if stipulated in the promissory notes, cannot be given effect
under the Truth in Lending Act.

Compound interest is interest on accrued interest. It is
valid to charge compound interest, but there must be a written
agreement to this effect; otherwise said compound interest

it be the interest charged upon judicial demand. (Art. 2212)

(3) Usury Law Not Violated

inflame the avarice and harden the heart of the creditor.
Some allowance must be made for the indolence of mankind.
(15RCL36)

The interest on accrued or capitalized interest is not
considered interest on the original principal, and should not
be considered usurious, if, when added to the original interest,
the sum should exceed the rates allowed by the Usury Law.
(Villareal v. Alvayda, 46 Phil. 277) In that case, the original
principal was P30.000 which had earned P3.600 at 12% interest
for one year. The parties added the P3,600 to the original
P30,000, and thus constituted thereon a new principal debt.
The debtor did not want to pay on the ground that the contract
was usurious.
HELD: There is nothing illegal here. As a matter of fact,
the Supreme Court in a subsequent case held: “It is well settled
in this jurisdiction that when there is an express agreement to
charge interest on interest, such fact should not be taken into
consideration in determining whether or not the stipulated
interest exceeds the limit prescribed by the Usury Law.”
(Gov’t, v. Conde, 61 Phil. 714 and Gov’t, v. Vaca & Calderon,
64 Phil. 6)

(6) Case

Antonio Tan v. Court of Appeals and Cultural
Center of the Phils.
GR 116285, Oct. 19, 2001

FACTS: Petitioner avers that there is no legal basis for
imposition
of interest on the penalty charge for the reason
the
that the law only allows imposition of interest on monetary
interest but not the charging of interest on penalty. He claims
that since there is no law that allows imposition of interest on
penalties, the penalties should not earn interest.

ISSUE: May interest on penalties be validly imposed?

HELD: Penalty clauses can be in the form of penalty or
compensatory interest. The compounding of the penalty or
compensatory interest is sanctioned by and allowed pursuant
to the above-quoted provision of Art. 1959 of the new Civil Code
considering that:

(4) When Compound Interest Cannot Be Demanded

Notice, however, that the agreement on compound interest
must be expressly made. In one case, the following words were
used: “Interest, to be computed upon the still unpaid capital
of the loan, shall be paid monthly, at the end of each month.”
Does this allow compound interest?
HELD: No. The language which we have quoted above
does not justify the charging of interest upon interest, so far
as interest on the capital is concerned. The provision quoted
merely requires the debtor to pay interest monthly at the end
of each month, such interest be computed upon the capital of
the load not yet paid. Clearly, this provision does not justify the
charging of compound interest upon the interest accruing upon
the capital monthly. (Co Unjieng v. Mabalacat Sugar Co., 54
Phil. 976)
(5) Reason Why Compound

Interests are Not Allowed
Except in the Cases Provided for by Law
Debts would accumulate with a rapidity beyond all
ordinary calculation and endurance. It would tend also to
154

Art. 1960

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

1. There is an express stipulation in the promissory
note permitting the compounding of interest; and
2. Art. 2212 of the new Civil Code provides that “[i]
nterest due shall earn legal interest from the time it is judicially
demanded, although the obligation may be silent upon this

point.”

1

Art. 1960. If the borrower pays interest when there has
been no stipulation therefor, the provisions of this Code
concerning solutio indebiti, or natural obligations, shall be
applied as the case may be.

COMMENT:
(1) Payment of Interest When There is No Stipulation
(a)

A borrower borrowed money. No interest was stipulated.
If by mistake he pays, then this will be a question of
undue payment or solutio indebiti. We should then apply
the rules on the subject.
155

Art. 1961

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(b)

If a borrower borrows money and orally agrees to pay legal
interest at 10% per annum, there is really no obligation
to pay since the interest was not agreed upon in writing.
If he nevertheless pays because he considers it his moral
obligation to pay said interest, he cannot recover the
interest that he has given voluntarily. This will now be
a natural obligation, and the provisions on said subject
should apply.

(2) Effect of Stipulations Authorizing Iniquitous or Uncons¬

cionable Interests

Advocates for Truth in Lendings,
Inc. v. Bangko Sentral Monetary Board
188 SCRA 530

Said stipulations have been invariably struck down for
being contrary to morals, if not against to law.

In a usurious loan with mortgage, the right to foreclose
the mortgage subsists, and this right can be exercised by the
creditor upon failure by the debtor to pay the debt due. The
debt due is considered as without the stipulated excessive
interest, and the legal interest of 12% per annum will be added
in place of the excessive interest formerly imposed.

Art. 1961

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

other laws, prospective effect should be given to it, where
such construction may be permitted. Laws adopted after
the execution of a contract, changing or altering the rate of
interest, cannot apply to such a contract without violating the
provision of the Constitution which prohibits the adoption of a
law impairing the obligations of a contract. (U.S. v. Conde, 42
Phil. 766)
(3) Criminal Liability

A lender and a borrower agreed that the rate of interest
on an unsecured loan would be higher than 14% per annum.
But actually, the lender only received the lawful rate. Is the
lender guilty of usury by the mere fact that he agreed to charge
a usurious rate?

HELD: Yes. Under Sec. 3 of the Usury Law, the prohibition
is deemed to comprehend not only the taking or receiving of a
higher rate of interest than 14% per annum if such loan is not
secured in the manner provided in said section, but also the
act of agreeing on such rate of interest. To this extent, it differs
from Sec. 2, under which a mere agreement to pay usurious
interest is not criminal. (People v. Bemarte, C_A. 36 O.G. 2720)
(4) When Usury Law Does Not Apply

Art. 1961. Usurious contracts shall be governed by the
Usury Law and other special laws, so far as they are not
inconsistent with this Code.

COMMENT:
(1) Usury Law

Act 2655, as amended, is our Usury Law, and was enacted
on Feb. 24, 1916. The law was passed to curb usury, since the
taking of excessive interest for the loan of money has been
regarded with abhorrence from the earliest times. (U.S. v.
Constantino, 39 Phil. 552)
(2) Rules on Construction

Since the Usury Law is penal in nature, it should be
construed strictly. (Dickerman v. Pay, 7 Am. Rep. 156) Like

A contract for the lease of property is not a loan; hence, the
rental paid is not governed by the Usury Law. (Tolentino
v. Gonzales, 50 Phil. 58)
(b) The increase of the price of a thing sold on credit over its
cash sale price is not interest within the purview of the
Usury Law, if the sale is made in good faith and not as a
mere pretext to cover a usurious loan. (Manila Trading v.
Tamaraw, 47 Phil. 513) Such price is the selling price for
a sale made on the installment plan.

(a)

(5) Compound Interest

In one case, it was held that an express agreement to
charge compound interest is not to be taken into consideration
in determining whether or not the stipulated interest exceed
the limit prescribed by the Usury Law. (Gov’t, v. Conde, 61 Phil.
714) This was changed by a subsequent case which held that

156

157

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 1961

charging compound interest violates the Usury Law when the
sums charged as such added to the stipulated interest exceeds
the average rate of interest that may legally be charged for a
loan. (Hodges v. Salas, 63 Phil. 567) In a still later case, the
Supreme Court reverted to the ruling in the Conde Case. (Gov’t
v. Vaca and Calderon, 64 Phil. 6)

usurer has committed a crime and must therefore be
penalized by barring him from the recovery of his capital.
(b)

(6) Advance Interest

Charging interest in advance is permissible provided said
interest does not correspond to interest for more than one year.
(Hodges v. Salas, 63 Phil. 567)

Under Arts. 1175 and 1957, the Usury Law prevails; and
under Sec. 6 of said Usury Law (Act 2655), the person
paying the usurious interest “may recover the whole
interest, commission, premiums, penalties, surcharges
paid and delivered” as long as the action for recovery is
instituted within two years after such payment and the
delivery (that is, all interest paid within the last two
years prior to litigation may be recovered).
(NOTE: It should be noted that under both theories,
legal interest on the interest may also be recovered.)

(7) How Much Interest Can Debtor Recover

(NOTE: As has already been said, as of today, the
Usury Law no longer exists.)

If a debtor has paid usurious interest, how much can he
get back from his creditor?

(8) Lawful Interest Rates

ANS.:
(a)

Art. 1961

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Under Art. 1961, in case of conflict between the new Civil
Code and the Usury Law, the new Civil Code applies,
and therefore, the interest in excess of 12% or 14% may
be recovered, with interest. (Art. 1413) However, in the
case of Angel Jose Warehousing v. Chelda Enterprises
& David Syjuico, L-25704, April 24, 1968, the Supreme
Court, ruled that the ENTIRE interest can be recovered
by the debtor, for such a stipulation is VOID (thus, it is
as if there is NO STIPULATION as to interest). On the
other hand, the principal contract of loan by itself is valid,
hence this may be recovered by the creditor. In case of
demand, and if the debtor is in default, said principal debt
earns interest from the date of the demand. This interest
is not by way of compensation but by way of damages.

Sanchez v. Buenviaje
GR 57314, Nov. 29, 1983
Under the Usury Law (now repealed), the lender
at usurious rates can still recover the principal (not the
interest). Justice Ramon Aquino (later to become Chief
Justice) consents because there should be no unjust
enrichment by the borrower. Justice Makasiar (later to
become Chief Justice) dissents on the theory that the
158

Interest rates are now fixed from time to time by the
Monetary Board.

While the Usury Law ceiling on interest rates was lifted

said circular could possibly be read as granting carte blanche
159

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1961

authority to lenders to raise interest rate to levels which would
either enslave their borrowers or lead to a hemorrhaging of
their assets. At any rate, galloping increases in interest rate
unilaterally imposed by a bank on a customer’s loan, over
the latter’s vehement protests, are arbitrary. An increase in
interest rates from 18% to 68% is excessive and unconscionable.
Where the escalation clause of the credit agreement in the
instant case required that the same be made “within the limits
allowed by law,” it obviously referred specifically to legislative
enactments not administrative circulars. Escalation clauses
are not basically wrong or legally objectionable so long as they
are not solely potestative but based on reasonable and valid
grounds.

(1) Provisions in the Code of Commerce

The provisions on commercial deposits found in the Code
of Commerce have been repealed. (Art. 2270, [2], Civil Code)
(2) When Contract of Deposit is Perfected

(S) Characteristics of the Contract of Deposit

(a)

A deposit, being a real contract, is perfected by delivery
(Art. 1316, Civil Code), but an agreement to constitute a

deposit is merely consensual, and is therefore binding upon
mere consent. (Art. 1963, Civil Code)

(3) Purposes of the Contract

The principal purpose of a deposit is the safekeeping of
the thing delivered (Art. 1962), but this does not mean that
the depositary can never use it. He can, in two instances:
(a)

with the express permission of the depositor,

(b)

when the preservation of the thing deposited requires
its use, it must be used but only for that purpose. (Art.
1977, Civil Code)
162

made in compliance with a legal obligation.
(Art. 1966, Civil Code)

It is a real contract perfected by delivery. (Art. 1316, Civil
Code) (Nonetheless, there can be consensual contract to
make or to constitute a deposit. [Art. 1963, Civil Code])

The principal purpose is the safekeeping of the thing
delivered. (Art. 1962) (Thus, if the safekeeping is merely
secondary, the contract is not a deposit but some other
contract like one of lease or commodatum. [Ibid.])
(c) The depositary cannot use the thing deposited except:
1) with the express permission of the depositor; or
2) when the preservation of the thing deposited
requires its use (but then it must be used only for
that purpose. [Art. 1977, Civil Code])

(b)

(d)

Only movable things can be the object of a deposit. (Art.
1966, Civil Code)
163

Art. 1962

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(e)

It is a gratuitous contract, except when there is an
agreement to the contrary or unless the depositary is
engaged in the business of storing goods. (Art. 1965,
Civil Code)
The contract is either unilateral or bilateral, according
to whether it is gratuitous or compensated (onerous).

(9) Balance of a Commission Account

NOTE, however, that the balance of a commission account
remaining in the possession of the agent at the principal’s
disposal acquires at once the character of a deposit which the
former must return or restore to the latter at any time it is
demanded. The agent cannot lawfully dispose of it without
incurring criminal responsibility for appropriating or diverting
to his own use another’s property. It could only become his as
a loan, if so expressly agreed by its owner who would then be
obligated not to demand it until the expiration of the legal or
stipulated period for the loan. (U.S. v. Igpuara, 7 Phil. 619)

;

A deposit is a real contract and is not perfected until
the delivery of the object of the obligation. (Art. 1316, Civil
Code) Where there has been no delivery, there is merely an
agreement to deposit, a personal obligation to do. Hence, it
has been truly said that a contract of future deposit is merely
consensual. Such contract is, however, binding.
(2) Necessity of an Agreement

It should be noted, however, that an offer to constitute
a deposit in the future is binding only when said offer is
accepted. Note that the law uses the term agreement. Without
said agreement, there is no contract at all whether real or
consensual. This doctrine is, however, applicable merely to
voluntary deposits.

Generally, deposit is GRATUITOUS.
Exceptions:
(a) when there is a contrary agreement;
166

A deposited his goods with B. Compensation was agreed
upon, but the rate was not fixed. How much should be given?
ANS.: In such a case (because there was no stipulation
as to how much should be paid), the compensation should
be fixed according to the current rates in the place where
the deposit was constituted. If the goods were delivered in
one place but actually deposited in another place, the rate
of compensation shall be that of the place where the things
were delivered, because that would be the place where the
contract was perfected. (8 Echavarri 180)
(3) When Contract is Really One of Loan

When the thing delivered can be used by the depositary
and he is obliged to pay interest for said use, it follows that
the contract cannot be considered a deposit but a loan or
mutuum. Notice here that we cannot consider this an onerous
deposit for in the problem presented, it is the depositary who
pays interest or remuneration. (Aquino v. Deala, 63 Phil. 582)
Art. 1966. Only movable things may be the object of a
deposit.

COMMENT:
(1) Why Only Movable Things May Be the Object of a

Deposit

The object of a deposit is the safekeeping of a thing, for
without such safekeeping it may be lost or it may disappear
or be stolen. This will not happen in real property (unless
of course what is meant by loss is destruction). Hence, only
movable things may be the object of a deposit.

A watchman’s services may, of course, be leased to guard
real estates.

A voluntary deposit is that wherein the delivery of the
object is made by the will of the depositor.

(2) Reason for the First Sentence

To emphasize the difference of a voluntary deposit from
the necessary deposit, it is obvious that this complete freedom
of action is absent in the latter.
(3) Depositor Need Not Be the Owner

Generally, the depositor must be the owner. The second
sentence admits the validity of a deposit which has not been
made by the true owner. As a matter of fact, the law provides
that the “depositary cannot demand that the depositor prove
his ownership of the thing deposited.” (Art. 1984, 1st par.,
Civil Code) After all, a depositor does not transfer ownership
over the subject matter.

(4) Interpleader’ Defined

Whenever conflicting claims upon the same subject matter
are or may be made against a person who claims no interest
whatever in the subject matter, or an interest which in whole
or in part is not disputed by the claimants, he may bring an
action to compel them to interplead and litigate their several
claims among themselves. (Sec. 1, Rule 63, Revised Rules of

(2) Capacity of Depositary

The depositary himself must be sui juris capacitated
to enter into binding contracts. He is subject to all the
obligations of a depositary. The law says that “persons who
are capable cannot allege the incapacity of those with whom
they contracted.” (Art. 1379, Civil Code)

Court)

(5) Example of Interpleader

A and B each claiming to be the sole owner of a bicycle,
deposited the same with C. C should later on deliver it to the
one to whom it belongs. The action which would settle the
conflicting claims would be in the nature of an interpleader.

OBLIGATIONS OF THE DEPOSITARY
Art. 1972. The depositary is obliged to keep the thing
safely and to return it, when required, to the depositor, or
to his heirs and successor or to the person who may have
been designated in the contract. His responsibility, with
regard to the safekeeping and the loss of the thing, shall
be governed by the provisions of Title I of this Book.
If the deposit is gratuitous, this fact shall be taken
into account in determining the degree of care that the
depositary must observe.

COMMENT:

(1) Principal Obligations of the Depositary

The safekeeping and the return of the thing, when
required, are the two principal obligations of the depositary.
(NOTE: Title I of Book IV refers to obligations and
contracts. [Arts. 1156-1304])
(2) Duty of Safekeeping

(a)

If the contract does not state the diligence which is to
be observed in the performance, that of a good father of
a family shall be required. (Art. 1175, par. 2)
(b) The depositary is responsible if the loss occurs through
his fault (Art. 1172), but as a rule, not if the loss is
through a fortuitous event. (Art. 1174)
172

Art. 1973

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(3) Effect if Deposit is Gratuitous or Onerous

Paragraph 2 — More care is required if the deposit is for
a compensation than if it is gratuitous. But even if gratuitous,
care must still be exercised. (11 Manresa 666)
Examples:

A fire destroyed something deposited. It was proved that
the fire was neither intentional nor caused by the fault of the
depositary, who as a matter of fact had even attempted to
save the goods.

HELD: Depositary is not liable. (La Sociedad Dalisay v.
De los Reyes, 55 Phil. 452)
The depositary who was in charge of some cattle failed
to prove that the loss occurred either without fault on his
part or by reason of caso fortuito.
HELD: He is liable. (Palacio v. Sudario, 7 Phil. 275)
(4) Owner Bears Loss

In case of non-fault on the part of the depositary, the
depositor-owner bears the loss because of the maxim “res perit
domino.* (Rizares v. Hemaez, 40 Phil. 981)
(5) Duty of Owner of Rice Mill

The owner of a rice mill who, in accordance with customs
prevailing in the trade, receives palay and converts the same
into rice, and sells the products for his own benefit has the
obligation to account for said palay to the owner, at the price
prevailing at the time demand is made. (Baron v. David, 51
Phil. 1)

(1) Deposit With a Third Person

(1) When Depositary may Change the Way of the Deposit

(a)

Examples:

Example:

A deposited a car with B. B then deposited the
same car with C. Is this allowed?

A deposited a car with B in garage No. 1. If B builds
garage No. 2, which is better than the first, B may put the
car in garage No. 2. However, B should first notify A and wait
for the latter’s decision, unless delay would cause danger.

ANS.: No, unless there is a stipulation that such
deposit can be done.
(b)

(2) Reason for the Law

Another example:

A deposited a car with B. A allowed B to deposit
the car with a third person. B then deposited the car
with C. If through Cs carelessness, the car is destroyed,
would B be liable to A?

ANS.: Yes, provided that C is a person manifestly
careless or unfit; otherwise, no. However, had C been
an employee of B, B is no doubt liable, whether C was
manifestly careless or not, for under the law the depositary
is responsible for the negligence of his employees.
(2) Reason of the First Sentence of the Article

The depositary is, as a rule, not allowed to deposit the
thing with a third person because a deposit is founded on
the fact that the depositor has precisely chosen a particular
depositary by virtue of the latter’s qualifications, and because
of the trust and confidence reposed on him by the depositor.
(NOTE: This is similar to the agent’s liability for the
acts of a substitute. [Art. 1898, Civil Code])

Art. 1974. The depositary may change the way of the
deposit if under the circumstances he may reasonably
presume that the depositor would consent to the change
if he knew of the facts of the situation. However, before
174

This is in accordance with the rule that generally, the
depositary must take care of the thing with the diligence of
a good father of a family.

Art. 1975. The depositary holding certificates, bonds,

securities or instruments which earn interest shall be bound
to collect the latter when it becomes due, and to take such
steps as may be necessary in order that the securities may
preserve their value and the rights corresponding to them
according to law.
The above provision shall not apply to contracts for
the rent of safety deposit boxes.

COMMENT:
(1) Duty of Depositary to Collect Interest on Intangible

Properties

Example:
A deposits with B a negotiable promissory note bearing
interest, which interest is due every six months. When that
day comes, B should collect the interest. This is logically
essential in the exercise of due diligence by the depositary
in taking good care of the thing deposited.

(2) Duty to Collect the Capital Also

not only while his (actual) grain is in the common store, but
as long as any grain is so stored, and if the owner of the
warehouse puts his own grain into the mass, he becomes, as
to such grain a tenant, in common of the entire body of grain
with other owners. (Drudge v. Loiter, 18 Ind. App. 694)

Under this Article, the depositary is obliged to collect,
when due, not only the interest, but also the capital itself,
and to return whatever may have been received or collected,
to the depositor. (Espeo de Hinojosa, 480-481) Naturally, this
would not be the case should there be a contrary agreement.

(NOTE: The rule stated in Art. 1976 is similar to the
provision on commixtion.)

(3 Malagarriaga 315)

(3) Reason for the Second Paragraph

I
j

Here, the renter of the box is supposed to have control
over the box and the contents thereof, and the real owner of
said boxes should therefore not have the duty imposed in the
first paragraph. As a matter of fact, this is really a lease of
a thing (the box) and not a contract of deposit.

COMMENT:
Generally, Depositary Cannot Use

COMMENT:
(1) Right of Depositary to Commingle

(b)

A received from B a deposit of four cavans of rice; and
from C, a deposit of seven cavans of the same kind of
rice. A can commingle the 1 1 cavans and B and C would
be the co-owners of the mixture in the proportion of four
to seven. This can be done unless there is a stipulation
to the contrary.
This provision is particularly applicable to a warehouseman,
who may commingle goods if authorized by agreement
or by custom. (Sec. 25, Warehouse Receipts Law)

(2) Reason for the Proportional Co-ownership

This is so from the necessity of the case because as soon
as the goods are intermingled, each person’s portion loses its
identity and can no longer be distinguished or separated from
the common mass. He becomes a tenant in common (co-owners),
176

Art. 1977. The depositary cannot make use of the thing
deposited without the express permission of the depositor.
Otherwise, he shall be liable for damages.
However, when the preservation of the thing deposited
requires its use, it must be used but only for that purpose.

Art. 1976. Unless there is a stipulation to the contrary,
the depositary may commingle grain or other articles of the
same kind and quality, in which case the various depositors
shall own or have a proportionate interest in the mass.

Generally, the use of the thing is not allowed in the
depositary.

(b)

EXAMPLE of paragraph 3: A radio-phonograph set must
occasionally be used so that it may function properly.
This use for preservation is implicitly granted, in view
of the nature of the thing deposited.

Art. 1978. When the depositary has permission to use
the thing deposited, the contract loses the concept of a
deposit and becomes a loan or commodatum, except where
safekeeping is still the principal purpose of the contract.
The permission shall not be presumed, and its existence
must be proved.

COMMENT:
(1) When Depositary Has Permission to Use

A deposited a sum of money with B who later was
authorized to use the same. The contract becomes one of loan.

millers. Even supposing that the palay had been delivered in
the character of a deposit, subject to future sale or withdrawal
at the plaintiffs election, nevertheless, if it was understood
that the defendant might mill the palay and he has in fact
appropriated it to his own use, he is, of course, bound to
account for its value, because under the law such a deposit loses
the concept of deposit and becomes a loan. By appropriating
the thing, the bailee becomes responsible for its value. The
defendant should be liable for the whole quantity delivered,
without deducting the 360 that were burned.

A deposited five kilos of sugar with B. B was authorized to
use the sugar, but safekeeping was still the principal purpose
of the contract. This is still a deposit but an irregular one,
hence it is called an irregular deposit.
{NOTE: The irregular deposit was in the Spanish laws
before the old Civil Code, but was abolished in the old Civil
Code. This abolition was criticized by Manresa. [11 Manresa
696-697] The new Civil Code restores it. Like mutuum, an
irregular deposit is concerned with consumable things which
are given by weight, number, or measure, but unlike mutuum,
it is demandable at the will of the depositor, for whose benefit
the deposit has been constituted.)

(4) Deposit of Palay
।

(3) Presumption

The law creates the presumption that in a deposit, the
permission to use is not presumed, except when such use is
needed for preservation. Therefore, a person who alleges that
permission or authority to use the thing deposited has been
given, has the burden of proving his allegation. (Par. 3, Art.

Baron v. David
51 PhiL 1

FACTS: Pablo David was the owner of a rice mill in
Pampanga. Silvestra and Guillermo Baron delivered around
2,000 cavans of palay to him, with the understanding that
he (David) was free to convert them into rice, and dispose
of them at his pleasure. After sometime, the rice mill was
burned, including its contents of around 360 cavans of palay.
This action was brought to recover the value of said cavans.
HELD: The owner of the rice mill who in conformity with
customs prevailing in the trade receives palay and converts
it into rice, selling the product for his own benefit, must
account for the palay to the owner at the price prevailing at
the time demand is made. The destruction of the rice mill
with its contents by fire after the palay thus deposited had
been milled and marketed, does not affect the liability of the

Delgado v. Bonnevie and Arandez
23 PhiL 308
FACTS: Palay was deposited so that it would be threshed
into rice. Is this a deposit or a hire of services?
HELD: While the deposit of palay was converted into a
hire of services, yet, after the object of the hiring (conversion
into rice) has been fulfilled, the rice continued to be a deposit
in the possession of the thresher for them to return to the
plaintiff-owner upon demand.

(6) When Deposit of Money is Really a Loan
(a)

Where money, consisting of coins of legal tender, is
deposited with a person, and the latter is authorized
by the depositor to use and dispose of the same, the
agreement thus entered into between the depositor and
the depositary is not a contract of deposit but a loan.
(Javellana v. Lion, et al., 11 Phil. 141)
(b) Evidence showing that interest had been offered as
compensation for the use of money deposited leads one to
the conclusion that the contracts, although denominated
by the parties as deposit is really one of loan. (Co Agricola
v. Nepomuceno, 56 Phil. 283)

(6) No Prescription of Demand for Return

Can the right to demand the return of the thing deposited
prescribe?

179

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 1979-1980

ANS.: Things received on deposit do not prescribe, for the
depositary cannot claim that ownership of the thing deposited
was transferred to him, but simply the custody thereof. The
possession of the depositary, as such, is not adverse to that
of the depositor. (Delgado v. Bonnevie, supra) The Civil Code
states that possession, in order to ripen into prescription, must
among other things be in the concept of an owner, public,
peaceful, and uninterrupted. (Art. 1118, Civil Code) Adverse
possession can, of course, give rise to prescription.
Art 1979. The depositary is liable for the loss of the
thing through a fortuitous event:
If it is so stipulated;
(2) If he uses the thing without the depositor’s
permission;
(3) If he delays its return;
(4) If he allows others to use it, even though he himself
may have been authorized to use the same.

COMMENT:
Liability for Fortuitous Event
Generally, the depositary is not liable for fortuitous
events. The Article gives the four exceptions.

Art. 1980. Fixed, savings, and current deposits of money
in banks and similar institutions shall be governed by the
provisions concerning simple loan.

COMMENT:
(1) Bank Deposits
(a) A bank can compensate a debtor’s debt with a debtor’s
deposit because insofar as the deposit is concerned, the
relationship between them is that of debtor and creditor,
not depositary and depositor. (Gullas v. Phil. Natl. Bank,
62 Phil. 619)

compensation.)

FACTS: The Monetary Board (MB) of the Central
Bank (now Bangko Sentral) closed the Manila Banking
Corp. (MBC) on May 22, 1987 (a Friday) under MB
Resolution 505. Said Resolution prohibited MBC to
do business and placed its assets and affairs under
receivership. On May 25, 1987 (a Monday), respondent
was at MBC at 9 a.m. for the purpose of preterminating
71 of his “Golden Time Deposits” (GTD) certificates with
an aggregate value of Pl,115,889.96. He redeposited the
same into new GTDs in denominations of P40.000 or
less.
The Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC)
refused to pay deposits because it said transactions
were not made “in the usual course of business,” as
understood in its Charter. It said that respondent might
have learned of the MB Resolution, hence he acted in
bad faith. PDIC theorizes that after MBC had exhausted
its cash and could no longer sustain further withdrawal
transactions, it instead issued new GTDs as “payment”
for respondent’s preterminated GTDs.
HELD: The PDIC Charter provides that the term
“deposit” means the unpaid balance of money or its
equivalent received by a bank in the usual course of
business and for which it has given or is obliged to give
credit to a commercial, checking, savings time, and thrift
account or which is evidenced by its certificate of deposit.
(Sec. 3, RA 3591)
The Supreme Court, in the instant case, rejected
PDIC’s argument, opining respondent should be given
the benefit of doubt that he was not aware the MB
Resolution had been passed, given the necessity of
confidentiality of placing a banking institution under
receivership. Appointment of a receiver may be made
by the MB without notice and hearing, but its action
is subject to judicial review to ensure protection of
the banking institution. One can just imagine the dire
consequences of prior hearing: Bank runs would be the

order of the day, resulting in panic and hysteria. In the
process, fortunes may be wiped out and disillusionment
will run the gamut of the entire banking community.
(b) A depositor is disputably presumed to be the owner of the
funds standing in his name in a bank deposit. (Fulton
Iron Works v. China Banking Corporation, 55 Phil. 208)
(c) If a depositor incurs an overdraft, the same cannot be
charged against an account placed under his name, that
has a notation that it is held in trust for another. (Fulton
Iron Works v. China Banking Corporation, 55 Phil. 208)
(d) If a trustee of some funds in a bank withdraws them
and misappropriates the same, the bank cannot be liable
if it acted in good faith. (7 C.J. 644)
(e) Current and savings deposits are loans to a bank because
it can use the same. (Tian Tiong Tick v. American
Apothecaries, 38 O.G. 889)

Thus, a stockholder cannot inspect its books, otherwise
its charter would be violated. Only the Central Bank
(Bangko Sentral) can inspect.
(2) Distressed Banks

Serrano v. Central Bank
L-30511, February 14, 1980
The recovery of time deposits from a distressed bank
as damages should be in the Court of First Instance
well
as
(now Regional Trial Court) in an ordinary action, not a
petition for mandamus and prohibition. Bank deposits are
really loans, and failure to return the same is failure to pay
an obligation as a debtor, not a breach of trust (for there is
no trust, constructive or otherwise). Incidentally, the Central
Bank (Bangko Sentral) has no obligation to pay the deposits
in an insolvent bank.

Concurring (J. Ramon Aquino): The depositor’s remedy
is to file his claim in the liquidation proceeding of the Bank.

Rural Bank of Caloocan v. Court of Appeals
L-32116, April 21, 1981

(3) Exemption from Payment of Interest

A bank must exercise the highest order of care and
prudence in dealing with would-be borrowers since it
is engaged in a business affected with public interest.
The consent of alleged co-makers or guarantors must
be strictly ascertained to prevent adverse effects on our
banking system.

The Overseas Bank of Manila v. Court of Appeals
L-49353, June 11, 1981
Banks are not required to pay interest on deposits for
the period during which they are not allowed to operate by
the Central Bank (Bangko Sentral). This is demanded by
fairness. However, interests that had accrued prior to the
suspension should be paid by the bank, for after all, it had
made use them of the money deposited.

Ong Sip v. Prudential Bank and Trust Co.
GR 27328, May 30, 1983
A post-dated check cannot at all be regarded as a
check. A bank cannot therefore deduct from a client’s
checking (current) account post-dated checks which have
been issued by the depositor (at least not until the date
indicated on the check).

COMMENT:
Return of the Thing Deposited

The Article is self-explanatory.
(b) If a property owner whose property has been judicially
attached sells the same but fails to deliver the money
to the attorney of the creditors, and instead deposits
the sum in court, he is guilty neither of estafa nor of
malversation. (U.S. v. Rastrollo, 1 Phil. 22)

(a)

When it becomes necessary to open a locked box or
receptacle, the depositary is presumed authorized to do so, if
the key has been delivered to him; or when the instructions
of the depositor as regards the deposit cannot be executed
without opening the box or receptacle. (Art. 1982)
Example:
A instructed B to take insurance on the thing deposited.
C, the agent of the Insurance Company, insurer, asks B
to give him opportunity to examine the thing deposited to
appraise its insurable value, and also to estimate the risks
the Company would assume, so that he may decide the rate
of premium to be imposed. Since the thing deposited is in a
box, may B open the box?
ANS.: Yes, B may open the box or receptacle for this is
the only possible way by means of which B may follow the
instruction of A. (Ibid.)

(c)

If a sale fails to materialize because of circumstances
beyond control, any earnest money given by way of
deposit or advance payment must be returned. (Litton,
et al. v. Luzon Surety Co., Inc., et al., 90 Phil. 783)

(d)

Article 1896 provides: “The agent owes interest on the
sums he has applied to his own use from the day on
which he did so, and on those which he still owes after
the extinguishment of the agency.”

Art. 1984. The depositary cannot demand that the
depositor prove his ownership of the thing deposited.

Nevertheless, should he discover that the thing has
been stolen and who its true owner is, he must advise the
latter of the deposit.

Art. 1982. When it becomes necessary to open a locked
box or receptacle, the depositary is presumed authorized
to do so, if the key has been delivered to him; or when the
instructions of the depositor as regards the deposit cannot
be executed without opening the box or receptacle.

If the owner, in spite of such information, does not
claim it within the period of one month the depositary
shall be relieved of all responsibility by returning the thing
deposited to the depositor.

If the depositary has reasonable grounds to believe that
the thing has not been lawfully acquired by the depositor;
the former may return the same.

be returned except to the persons who may have the

COMMENT:
(1) When Deposit Must Be Returned

,

As a rule, the thing deposited should be returned at the
will of the depositor. This is true whether a period has been
stipulated or not.

Reason: The term is for the sole benefit of the depositor
and he may therefore demand that the thing be returned
191

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Ait. 1989

notwithstanding the non-expiration of the term. It is submitted,
however, that when a time has been stipulated, and the deposit
is for a compensation, the term in this case would be for the
benefit of both depositor and depositary. In this case, while
the depositor may still demand the thing at will, he should
pay the depositary the corresponding indemnity, unless of
course a breach of confidence on the part of the depositary
makes it imperative for the depositor to immediately demand
the return of the thing.

(1) Justifiable Reason for Returning
(a)

(b)

(NOTE: Other just causes include serious danger to
the property, or an unbearably long time of deposit. The
cause must be real, not imaginary. [11 Manresa 699]}

(b)

In (a), suppose A refuses to receive the car, what should
B do?

i

ANS.: B may secure its consignation from the court.
(Consignation is the act of depositing the things due
at the disposal of judicial authority. [Art. 1258, par. 1,
Civil Code])

Should the depositary have been notified of the opposition
of a third person to the return or the removal of the
thing deposited. Reason: The oppositor may claim to be
the owner.
>

(2) Problem

A deposited with B a car. B is to be paid for the deposit.
If B has to leave the Philippines for medical treatment abroad,
is he allowed to return the car to A even before the expiration
of the term specified?

(3) Liability for Damages

Should the depositary return the thing despite the
attachment or the opposition, he should respond for damages.
He should therefore not return in these two cases. The law
clearly gives him his course of action, namely, to inform the
depositor of the opposition or of the attachment. Of course,
should the opposition or the attachment be later withdrawn
or discharged, the depositary should now return the subject
matter of the deposit upon demand therefor by the depositor.

Example:

A gratuitously deposited with B a car. B is later on
appointed minister to a foreign city. It is clear in this
case that B may return the car to A, even before the
time designated. The depositary B in the problem has
justifiable reason for not keeping the thing deposited.

(2) Exceptions to the General Rule

When the thing is judicially attached while in the
depositary’s possession. Reason: The property will be
subject to judicial orders.

COMMENT:

(NOTE: It has been held that when there is no fixed
period for the return, withdrawal can be made at any time

ANS.: Although apparently, the depositary is not
granted that right inasmuch as the deposit has been made
for a compensation, it is believed that the depositary in a
case like this will be allowed to return the car provided that
a proportional reduction in the compensation is made; for
otherwise, if it is really imperative for B to go abroad, who
will take care of the car? The law must not be construed to
take effect an absurdity.

Art. 1989. Unless the deposit is for a valuable
consideration, the depositary who may have justifiable
reasons for not keeping the thing deposited may, even
before the time designated, return it to the depositor; and
if the latter should refuse to receive it, the depositary may
secure its consignation from the court.

him P200,000 therefor. This P200.000 must be given by B in

of the car, but it is also clear that he should not unjustly

have sold the thing which he did not know was deposited,
shall only be bound to return the price he may have received
or to assign his right of action against the buyer in case
the price has not been paid him.

Article 1992 does not apply when the deposit is onerous,
for in such a case, the depositary is obliged to spend,
without the right of reimbursement, for the necessary
expenses for preservation. He has no right to seek
reimbursement because said expenses are deemed
included in the compensation. There can, however, be a
contrary stipulation.

expenses and not the useful ones or those for mere luxury
or pleasure or ostentation.

The provision is under Sec. 2 which deals with
“obligations of the depositary."

Example:

of B, not knowing that the car had been merely deposited
with his father, sold the car to D, in the belief that he
(C) had inherited the same from his (Cs) father. What
will be Cs liability?

ANS.: It depends:

If C has already been paid by D, then C should
return to A the price received.

depositary of the same, or the latter was aware of it without
advice from the depositor.

In the example in No. (1), the bomb may have
been placed by an assassin while the car was still in
the depositor’s possession.
(b) If at the time the deposit was made, the depositor knew
of the danger BUT he notified the depository of the
same. Reason: Here, the depository may be said to have
assumed the risk.

Art. 1995

(2) Pledge by Operation of Law

A car containing a small bomb inside the machine was
deposited with a depositary. Should an explosion occur and
he suffers loss therefrom, the depositor must reimburse him
for said loss.

(a)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

If at the time the deposit was made, the depositary was
aware of the danger, even though he had not been notified
by the depositor. Reason: There is also an assumption
of risk here.

Art. 1994. The depositary may retain the thing in pledge
until the full payment of what may be due him by reason
of the deposit.

Article 1994 gives an example of a pledge created by
operation of law. As a matter of fact, the thing deposited but
now pledged may even be sold after the requirements and
formalities in the case of sales of things pledged have been
complied with. If, for example, the thing is sold for Pl,000,
although the debt is only P200, the balance of P800 must be
returned to the depositor. (See Art. 2121, Civil Code)
(3) Query

Under Art. 1994, suppose the depositary voluntarily
returns the thing deposited to the depositor even if the latter
has not yet fully paid him (depositary) what may be due him
(depositary), may the depositary still bring an action to recover
said fees, compensation, or expenses from the depositor?
ANS.: Yes. In this case, the depositary has only lost the
right of retention by way of pledge, but surely not the right
to recover what may be due him.

Art. 1995. A deposit is extinguished:
(1) Upon the loss or destruction of the thing deposited;
(2) In case of a gratuitous deposit, upon the death of
either the depositor or the depositary.

COMMENT:
(1) Extinguishment of Deposit

Example:

COMMENT:
(1) Right of Retention by Depositary

Example:

A deposited with B a car. If the deposit is gratuitous, B
may nevertheless retain the car in pledge until, for example, he
has been reimbursed the necessary expenses he had incurred
for its preservation. If the deposit is for a compensation, and
the compensation has not yet been paid, he may nevertheless
still retain the car in pledge.
196

A deposited a car with B. If the car is destroyed by a

fortuitous event, the deposit is extinguished.
(2) Effect of Death

The death of either the depositor or the depositary
extinguishes the deposit if it is gratuitous, but the thing
deposited must of course be returned. When the law says
“extinguished” it really means that the depositary need not
be a depositary any longer.

“The creditor cannot use the thing
pledged, without the authority of the owner, and if he should

the hotel-keeper liable?

ANS.: Yes, provided that he had previously been informed
about the cellular phone, and provided furthermore that the
traveller followed any precaution that may have been given
by the hotel-keeper or his substitutes regarding the care and
vigilance of said property.
(2) ‘Innkeeper’ Defined

The keeper of an inn for the lodging of travellers and
passengers for a reasonable compensation. He is distinguished
from the proprietor of other public houses of entertainment in
that he publicly holds out his place as one where all transient
persons who choose to come will be received as guests. (Holstein

the term guests instead of travellers. For purposes of the
provisions on this kind of necessary deposit, the two terms
are synonymous. (Holstein v. Phillips, supra)
201

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 1999

(5) Reasons for the Liability of the Hotels or Inns
(a)

(b)

It is a good policy to encourage travel;

Travellers and strangers must of necessity trust in the
honesty and vigilance of the innkeeper and those in his
employ;

(c)

The opportunity and temptation to connive with evildisposed persons and to afford facilities in stealing the
goods of those in his house;

(d)

The innkeeper is as a rule better able to protect himself
against loss than the guest who is practically helpless
to enforce his rights. (Holstein v. Phillips, supra)

(6) When Liability Begins

Liability or responsibility by the hotel or innkeeper
commences as soon as there is an evident intention on the
part of the travellers to avail himself of the accommodations
of the hotel or inn. It does not matter whether compensation
has already been paid or not, or whether the guest has already
partaken of food and drink or not.

personal property of the guests caused by the servants or
employees of the keepers of hotels or inns as well as by

As a rule, the master is responsible for the acts of servants
or employees of the hotel provided of course that notice
has been given and the proper precautions taken.

(b)

The master is also liable for the acts of strangers, like
malicious mischief or theft.

(7) Meaning of Effects

All kinds of personal property, like jewelry, fountain
pens, and cash.
(8) Nature of Precautions to Be Given to the Guests

They may be given directly or orally to the guests, or
they may be typed, mimeographed, or printed on posters which
are usually set up and posted both in the lobby as well as
in the individual rooms. Note however that “the hotel-keeper
cannot free himself from responsibility by posting notices to
the effect that he is not liable for the articles brought by the
guest.” (Art. 2003, 1st sentence, Civil Code)

Art. 1999. The hotel-keeper is liable for the vehicles,
animals and articles which have been introduced or placed
in the annexes of the hotel.

The master should be exempted in case:
(a) there has, for example, been robbery by intimidation of
persons, or
‘
(b) a fortuitous event, like flood.
(3) Problem

A was guest in B’s hotel. C, a drunkard, entered the hotel
and destroyed A’s personal belongings despite the fact that
A had given proper notice and had followed all precautions.
Will B be liable?

ANS.: Yes. This is an act of a stranger, not considered a
force majeure under this provision of the law. The management

COMMENT:
(1) Instances When Hotel-keeper is Not Liable

Since the law does not distinguish what kind of acts are
referred to, it may be inferred that the acts mentioned in the
Article be either the result of a voluntary malicious act or
simply of negligence.
(2) Examples

In the middle of the night, A went up the fire escape,
slowly raised a guest’s window, went inside the room, and
stole the guest’s shoes. Is the hotel-keeper liable?
ANS.: Yes. He should have seen to it that no thief could
enter the building without being noticed, for example, by a
watchman. This is a case of robbery with force upon things.
(2) Query

—
(b) Acts of visitors of the guest — A while entertaining B in
his room suddenly noticed that B was hurling his (A’s)

(a)

radio into the street, or that C, another visitor had just
departed taking away with him A’s shoes.
(c)

The bell boy of a hotel, at the point of a gun, asked the
watchman of a hotel’s safe to open it for him. The bell boy
then runs away taking with him some jewelry deposited in
said safe by the guests. Will the hotel-keeper be liable?

ANS.: Yes. It is true that here the robbery was committed
with use of arms, but then the bell boy was the servant of
the hotel-keeper. The latter will be liable, not because of Art.
2001 which evidently refers to a stranger, but because of Art
2000.
(3) Reason for Article 2001

The innkeeper is bound to keep his house safe from the
intrusion of thieves, day and night, and if they are allowed
to gain access to the house, and specially without the use of
such force as will show its marks upon the house, it is fairly
presumable that the innkeeper is at fault.

Art. 2002. The hotel-keeper is not liable for compensation
if the loss is due to the acts of the guest, his family, servants

or visitors, or if the loss arises from the character of the
things brought into the hotel.
204

Act of the guest himself
when turning on his radio,
he may have forgotten to attach the transformer.

—

Acts of the guest’s own servant
the servant may have
appropriated the thing for himself. (Do not confuse this
with the acts of the hotel-keeper’s servant.)

Art. 2003. The hotel-keeper cannot free himself from
responsibility by posting notices to the effect that he is not
liable for the articles brought by the guest. Any stipulation
between the hotel-keeper and the guest whereby the
responsibility of the former as set forth in Articles 1998 to
2001 is suppressed or diminished shall be void.

A’s effects. Subsequently, a bell boy stole A’s watch. B will
still be liable.

things brought into the hotel by the guest, as a security for
credits on account of lodging, and supplies usually furnish

A was a transient in B's hotel. A left without settling
his account but forgot one valise in the hotel. B can retain
said valise as security for the payment of A’s account.
(2) Right to Sell

Has the hotel owner the right to sell the valise? In other
words, is there a right of retention here by way of pledge?
According to a member of the Code Commission, this
right of retention is in the nature of a pledge created by
operation of law, and thus the hotel-keeper is allowed the
power of sale under Arts. 2121 and 2122 of the new Civil
Code. (VI Capistrano, Civil Code of the Phil., p. 402)

It does not exist when the debtor is not a guest of the

The garnishment of property to satisfy a writ of execution
“operates as an attachment and fastens upon the property a
lien which the property is brought under the jurisdiction of the
court issuing the writ. It is brought into custodia legis, under
the sole control of such court. Property is in the custody of
the court when it has been seized by an officer either under
a writ of attachment on mesne process or under a writ of
execution. A court which has control of such property, exercises
exclusive jurisdiction over same. No court, except one having
supervisory control or superior jurisdiction in the premises
has a right to interfere with and change that possession.

will be equal, for under the law of intestacy, the share of
the surviving spouse is the same as the share of each of the
legitimate children. (Art. 996, Civil Code)

surrendering must be with the husband’s consent (insofar
as his P250,000 is concerned), and with the court’s consent
(insofar as the minor child’s share of P250,000 is concerned).
In the interest of the minor child, the parent needs judicial

alienation or encumbrance. (Nario v. Phil-Am Life, L-22796,

succession cannot apply here, for the insurance indemnity does
not partake of a donation. Therefore, it cannot be considered
as an advance of the inheritance. For the same reason, it is
not subject to collation. (See Del Vai v. Del Vai, supra)
(NOTE: The rule in the United States, however, is
different. There, it has been held that if the beneficiary
predeceases the insured, the proceeds of the indemnity must
go, not to the estate of the beneficiary, but to the estate of
the insured. [McKinney v. Depoy, N.S. {2nd} 250])

An insurance contract is a contract off adhesion which
must be construed liberally in favor of the insured and strictly
against the insurer in order to sab guard the farmer’s interest.

(8) Accident Insurance

Although a life insurance is, generally speaking, distinct
and different from an accident insurance, still when one of the
risks insured against in the latter is the death of the insured
by accident, such accident insurance may also be regarded
as a life insurance. (Gallardo v. Morales, L-12189, April 29,

Manila Bankers Life Insurance
Corp. v. Aban

(9) Measure of the Vested Interest of Insurance Beneficiary

Insurers cannot be allowed to collect premiums on
insurance policies, use these amounts collected and invert
the same through the years, generally profits and returns
therefrom for their own benefit, and thereafter conveniently
deny insurance claims by questioning the authority or integrity
of their own agents or the insurance policies they issued to
their premium-paying clients.

The vested interest or right of the beneficiaries in a life
insurance policy should be measured on its full face value,
and not on its cash surrender value. The reason is clear. In
case of death of the insured, said beneficiaries are paid on
the basis of its face value, and in case the insured should
discontinue paying premiums, the beneficiaries may continue
paying them, and they are entitled to automatic extended terms
or paid-up insurance options, etc. (Delfin Nario & Alejandra
Santos-Nario v. Phil. American Life Insurance Co., L-22796,
June 26, 1967)

Art. 2012. Any person who is forbidden from receiving
any donation under Article 739 cannot be named beneficiary
of a life insurance policy by the person who cannot make
any donation to him, according to said article.

Disposition or Alienation

If a wife insures herself for P600.000 and designates
her husband and minor child as irrevocable beneficiaries, her
act of obtaining a loan on said policy and her subsequent act

her minor child’s property rights, and are not merely acts
of management or administration. To be valid, the act of

The law discourages gambling, hence the provisions of
Art. 2014.
(2) Promissory Note Issued Because of Gambling

A promissory note issued because of a gambling debt
will not produce any effect in the hands of the winner, but
if indorsed in favor of an innocent third party, recovery can
be had from the indorser who will be in estoppel. (Rodriguez
v. Martinez, 5 Phil. 67; see Palma v. Canizares, 1 Phil. 602)
(3) Money Lent to a Gambler

If I lend money to a person, and he later gambles and
loses it, I can still recover from him the amount of the loan
even if the gambling took place at my home. This is because
the loan is NOT the result of gambling. (Vasquez v. Florence,
5 Phil. 183) Similarly, if a gambler borrows from me to pay
a winner, I can still recover from him, for I did not win the
money by gambling.
(4) Instance Where Article is Not Applicable

Ban v. Intermediate Appellate Courts
GR 66272, Oct. 17, 1986

FACTS: A organized mahjong sessions for recreation
in which B was a constant participant. On several occasions
B borrowed from A various amounts to pay off his mahjong
losses, promising to pay the same on demand. A sued B to
recover the amounts borrowed. B alleged that the alleged
indebtedness was a gambling debt, and therefore A cannot
legally collect it.

Arte. 2015-2017

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

HELD: Article 2014 does not apply to a case where the
maintainer of a gambling house sues a gambler to recover
money which the latter had borrowed from the former to
pay off gambling debts incurred in favor of others. Even if
plaintiff is admittedly the operator of the gambling joint, his
alleged subsidiary liability cannot arise absent a direct suit
against those primarily liable for defendant’s losses, namely,
the mahjong winners, and absent furthermore said winners’
proven liability to pay.

Art. 2015. If cheating or deceit is committed by the
winner, he, and subsidiarily the operator or manager of the
game bring house, shall pay by way of exemplary damages,
not less than the equivalent of the sum lost, in addition to

the latter amount. If both the winner and the loser have
perpetrated fraud, no action for recovery can be brought
by either.

COMMENT:
Effect of Cheating
According to the Code Commission, “it is provided that
exemplary damages should be paid in the above case in order
that cheating in a game of chance may be properly discouraged
and punished.” (Report of the Code Commission, p. 153)

Art. 2016. If the loser refuses or neglects to bring an
action to recover what has been lost, his or her creditors,
spouse, descendants or other persons entitled to be
supported by the loser may institute the action. The sum
thereby obtained shall be applied to the creditors’ claims, or
to the support of the spouse or relatives, as the case may be.

COMMENT:
Rule if Loser Does Not Bring the Action to Recover
Note the persons who may subsidiarily bring the action.
With respect to creditors, recovery is only to the extent of the
credit.

Art. 2017. The provisions of Articles 2014 and 2016
apply when two or more persons bet in a game of chance,
although they take no active part in the game itself.

may recover what he has paid.
COMMENT:

Where the Transactions Partake of Gambling and Thus
Void
If a certain share of stock is sold today in the Philippine
Stock Exchange for P19 per share and it is agreed between
X and Y that X will deliver to Y 10 days from now (or on
Feb. 14) 1,000 shares of said stock at the price prevailing on
said date, i.e., on Feb. 14, and on that the date the price is
already P23 per share (or a gain of P4 per share or P4.000
for the 1,000 shares), it is understood that X has gained
P4,000 and this amount should be given by Y to X. If, upon
the other hand, instead of a gain, the price decreases, e.g.,
by P3 on Feb. 14, it is understood that X has lost P3 a share
or a total of P3,000, which amount X must give to Y. Both
transactions partake of gambling and are regarded as null
and void. (Dr. Edgardo C. Paras, Economics for Lawyers, Rex
Book Store, 1993, pp. 203-204)

It would seem that in these contests, there can be
prohibition on betting. What the law does not include, it
excludes.

The Revised Penal Code (Art. 195) expressly prohibits

LIFE ANNUITY

1

Art. 2021. The aleatory contract of life annuity binds
the debtor to pay an annual pension or income during the
life of one or more determinate persons in consideration
of a capital consisting of money or other property, whose
ownership is transferred to him at once with the burden of
the income.

(1) Example of Life Annuity

Jose gave Mariano a parcel of land with the condition that
the latter will give Jose an annual pension or income as long
as Jose lives. Jose is both the annuitant (giver of the capital)
and the beneficiary. Ownership of the land is immediately
transferred to Mariano with the burden of the pension.
(2) Life Annuity Distinguished from Life Insurance

Life annuity differs from life insurance in that the annual
income is not payment of interest on the capital given, but
as the consideration for the transfer of the ownership of the
capital. (12 Manresa 62)

Art. 2022. The annuity may be constituted upon the
life of the person who gives the capital, upon that of a third
person, or upon the lives of various persons, all of whom
must be living at the time the annuity is established.
It may also be constituted in favor of the person or
persons upon whose life or lives the contract is entered into,
or in favor of another or other persons.

Art. 2023. Life annuity shall be void if constituted upon

contract was entered into, or who was at that time suffering
from an illness which caused his death within twenty days
following said date.

COMMENT:
When the Contract of Life Annuity is Void
The Article gives us two instances when the contract is
VOID.
Art. 2024. The lack of payment of the income due does
not authorize the recipient of the life annuity to demand
the reimbursement of the capital or to retake possession of
the property alienated, unless there is a stipulation to the
contrary. He shall have only a right judicially to claim the
payment of the income on arrears and to require a security
for the future income, unless there is a stipulation to the
contrary.

creditors, the latter may ask for the execution or attachment
of the property.

COMMENT:

Attachment of the Annuity
Note that the annuity cannot be attached by creditors
of the recipient if there be a stipulation to this effect, but the
creditors of the person who constituted the annuity may ask for

Art. 2028. A compromise is a contract whereby the

COMMENT:
(1) Essence of Compromise

According to the Code Commission, the element of
“reciprocal concessions” is the very heart and life of every
compromise. (Report of the Code Commission, p. 164)
(2) Concept of a ‘Compromise Agreement’

Art. 2028 of the Civil Code defines a compromise agree¬

ment as

—

“a contract whereby the parties, by making reciprocal
concessions, avoid a litigation or put an end to one
already commenced” (Magsaysay Maritime Corp. v. De
Jesus, 838 SCRA 329 [2017].) (See Chiguita Brands,
Inc. v. Omelio, 826 SCRA 223 [2017]); (See also Cathay
Land, Inc. v. Ayala Land, Inc., 836 SCRA 490 [2017]).

It is settled that a client may enter into a compromise
agreement with the adverse party to terminate the litigation
before a judgment is rendered therein, and if the compromise
agreement is found to be in order and not contrary to law,
morals, good customs, and public policy its judicial approval

is in order. (BDO, Unibank, Inc. formerly Equitable [PCIB])
v. Nebres, 831 SCRA 783 [2017])
Upon approval, a judgment upon a compromise is im¬
mediately executory, not even subject to appeal. (Team Image
Entertainment, Inc. v. Solar Team Entertainers, Inc., 839
SCRA 501 [2017])
Earlier on, in Malvar v. Kraft Foods Philippines, Inc.
(705 SCRA 242 [2013]), it was held that the opposing party
would be liable if they were shown to have connived with the
client in the execution of the compromise agreement, with the
intention of depriving the intervenor of its attorney’s fees.
(BDO Unibank, supra)

In Cathay Land (supra), it was ruled that when the
terms of agreement are so clear and explicit that they do not
justify an attempt to read into it any alleged intention of the
parties the terms are to be understood literally just as they
appear on the face of the contract.
While a compromise is not one of the grounds prescribed
by the Revised Penal Code for the extinction of criminal li¬
ability (Team Image, supra), be it recalled that Chavez v.
Presidential Comm, on Good Government (299 SCRA 744
[1998]) and Benedicto v. Board of Administrators (207 SCRA
659 [1992]), ironically cited by Team Image (supra), are both
clear that compromise is encouraged only in civil cases. (Team

(6) When Agreement is Not Really a Compromise

Merced v. Roman Catholic Archbishop
L-24614, Aug. 17, 1967

FACTS: The lessees of a parcel of land (for an indefinite
period) were occupying the premises for several years. One day,
they were given notice to vacate, whereupon they went to court
to have it fix the period of the lease and to have the lessees’
rights determined insofar as the improvements are concerned.
A so-called “compromise agreement” was reached whereby the
court was given discretion to fix the term, but the attorney who
signed in behalf of the lessees had not been so authorized.
ISSUE: Does the agreement bind the lessees?

226

HELD: Yes. It is immaterial that the attorney was
unauthorized for what he signed in their behalf was NOT really
a compromise. There were no reciprocal concessions given,
and what was agreed upon is merely what the law provides.
Upon the other hand, a true compromise requires the grant of
reciprocal concessions.
227

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(7) Cases

Landoil Resources Corp., et al. v.
Hon. Tensuan, et al.
GR 77733, Dec. 20, 1988
Jurisprudence in a long line of decisions has established
without question that compromise agreements reached by the
parties in a case and filed before either the Court of Appeals
or the Supreme Court, have been approved and/or sustained
by this Court. Thus, it has been held that a compromise may
supersede all agreements and proceedings that had previously
taken place and may constitute a final and definite settlement
of the controversies by and between the parties. From the time
a compromise is validly entered into, it becomes the source of
the rights and obligations of the parties thereto, the purpose
of a compromise being precisely to replace and terminate
controverted claims.

attorney’s intervention.
On consideration of equity and fairness, the Supreme
Court disproves of the tendencies of clients compromising their
cases behind the backs of their attorneys for the purpose of
[unreasonably] reducing or completely setting to naught the
stipulated contingent fees.

(9) Effect of a ‘Compromise’

Cathay Land, Inc. v. Ayala Land, Inc.
836 SCRA 490

FACTS: An agreement was entered into by R.B. Liner, Inc.
and its union (Reformist Union) in the nature of a compromise
agreement, i.e., “an agreement between two or more persons,
who, for preventing or putting an end to a lawsuit adjust
their difficulties by mutual consent in the manner which they
agree on, and which every one of them prefers to the hope of
gaining, balanced by the danger of losing.” In said agreement,
each party made concessions in favor of the other to avoid a
protracted litigation.
HELD: While the Supreme Court does not abandon the
rule that “unfair labor practice acts are beyond and outside the
sphere of compromises,” the agreement herein was voluntarily
entered into and represents a reasonable settlement, thus, it
binds the parties.

(2017)

Art. 2028 of The Civil Code provides that

—

“[a] compromise is a contract whereby the parties, by
making reciprocal concessions, avoid a litigation or put an
end to one already commenced.”

It has the effect and authority of res judicata upon the
parties, but there shall be no execution except in compliance
with a judicial compromise.

COMMENT:
(1) Duty of the Court to Persuade Litigants to Compromise

The reason for this duty is obvious: litigation must, if
possible, be avoided or minimized.
(2) Right of Attorney to Compromise for His Client

The Rules of Court require a “special authority” before an
attorney can compromise in behalf of his client. The authority
may be in writing, or may be oral, but in case of an oral authority
the same must be duly established by evidence other than the
self-serving assertion of counsel himself that such authority
had been given to him orally. (Home Insurance Co. v. United
States Lines, Co., et al., L-25693, Nov. 15, 1967)
(3) The Case of Richard Gordon

Richard J. Gordon v. Court of Appeals
GR 134900, Sept 1, 1998

In open court during the hearing, a civil settlement has
been encouraged for a dignified exit of an achiever and smooth
assumption of a successor, for a settlement still accords with
Arts. 2028 and 2029 of the Civil Code.
Article 2028 provides: “A compromise is a contract
whereby the parties, by making reciprocal concessions, avoid
a litigation or put an end to one already commenced.” Article
2029 states: “The court shall endeavor to persuade the litigants
in a civil case to agree upon some fair compromise.”

suspended:
If willingness to discuss a possible compromise is

the offer.
The duration and terms of the suspension of the civil
action or proceeding and similar matters shall be governed
by such provisions of the rules of court as the Supreme Court
shall promulgate. Said rules of court shall likewise provide
for the appointment and duties of amicable compounders.

COMMENT:
(1) Suspension of Civil Action or Proceeding

Under the Revised Rules of Court, this Article on
suspension is reproduced substantially.
(2) Motion to Dismiss

The Revised Rules of Court mentions as one of the grounds
to dismiss the fact that no attempt has been made to arrive
at a compromise. (Rev. Rules of Court, Rule 16) In cases where
the law allows a compromise, the fact that an attempt to arrive
at one has been made
should be stated in the complaint
otherwise, the complaint can be dismissed. Of course, if no
compromise is allowed by law (as in the case of future support),
the condition precedent does not apply.

(3) Postponements

While postponements must be discouraged, still they can
be allowed when the parties are trying to reach an amicable
settlement. (PNB v. De la Cruz, L-1002, April 16, 1958)
(4) Offers to Arbitrate Not Included

This Article does not include offers to arbitrate. It refers
only to a compromise, upon terms that the court can ascertain
and determine if they are reasonable. A compromise could
dispense with a trial; but an arbitration would merely prolong
the case, since the arbiter’s decision would remain appealable.

Arts. 2032-2033

COMMENT:
(1) Generally, No Compromise on Criminal Aspect

If a crime has been committed, there can be a compromise
on the civil liability but not generally on the criminal
liability, because the social and public interest demands the
punishment of the offender. (U.S. v. Leano, 6 Phil. 368 and
U.S. v. Mendozana, 2 Phil. 353 and U.S. v. Heery, 25 Phil. 600)

While under Art. 225 of the Family Code the widow is
the legal administratrix of the property pertaining to the
children under parental authority, said Article does not
give her authority as legal administratrix to compromise
their claims for indemnity arising from their father’s death
“for a compromise has always been deemed equivalent to
an alienation (transigere est alienare), and is an act of
strict ownership that goes beyond mere administration.”
(Visaya, et al. v. Suguitan, et al., L-8300, Nov. 18, 1955
and People v. Verano, L-15805, Feb. 28, 1961)

(2) When Compromise is Allowed

In some crimes, there can be a sort of compromise as
in the case of crimes against chastity and violations of the
Internal Revenue Code. Thus, the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue may enter into a contract of compromise regarding
civil and criminal liability arising under the Internal Revenue
Code or any other law administered by the Bureau of Internal
Revenue. (Koppel Phil. v. Collector, L-1977, Sept. 21, 1950)

However, in a civil case, the compromise must be entered
into before or during litigation, never after final judgment.
(Rovero v. Amparo, 91 Phil. 228) The compromise during
litigation may even be in the form of a “confession of judgment.”

Art. 2033. Juridical persons may compromise only in
the form and with the requisites which may be necessary to
alienate their property.

i

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2034

Art. 2034

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

HELD: There is no law which prohibits a person who
has incurred damages by reason of the act of another from
waiving whatever rights he may have against the latter. If
the act causing damage to another also constitutes a crime,
the civil liability arising from the criminal act may also be
validly waived. What is not allowed in this jurisdiction is
to compromise or waive the criminal aspect of a case. The
reason or principle underlying the difference between rights
which may be waived and rights which may not be waived are
personal, while those rights which may not be waived involve
public interest which may be affected. In a compromise or a
waiver of the civil aspect of the case, the restriction imposed by
law is that it must be entered into before or during litigation,
never after final judgment. A compromise on the civil aspect
of a case is valid even if it turns out to be unsatisfactory to
either or both of the parties. Express condonation by the
offended party has the effect of waiving civil liability with
regard to the interest of the injured party. For, civil liability
arising from an offense is extinguished in the same manner
as other obligations, in accordance with the provisions of the
civil law. It is true that the minimum amount of compensatory
damages for death that may be awarded to plaintiff at the time
of the death of his son is P12.000. However, for reasons stated
in the “Sinumpaang Salaysay,” plaintiff voluntarily released
defendant from his civil obligations. Said affidavit executed by
plaintiff, releasing the defendant from additional civil liability
arising from the death of the former’s son, is legal. It is not
contrary to law, morals, good customs, public policy or public
order. Consequently, he can no longer institute a complaint
to recover damages arising from the same incident subject of
the affidavit. A party to the settlement cannot be allowed to
renege on his undertaking therein after receiving the benefits
thereof as long as the parties entered into the settlement
voluntarily and intelligently, the courts are bound to respect
the agreement.

Republic v. Marcelo B. Garay
L-21416, Dec. 31, 1965

FACTS: The Government sued Garay for alleged income
tax deficiency. Garay filed a pleading (which was ALSO signed
by the counsel for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue),
entitled “confession of judgment.” The Commissioner, in
turn, signified his willingness to allow the payment of the
deficiency in installments. The trial judge then rendered a
decision requiring the defendant to pay in accordance with
the “confession of judgment.” The Government filed a motion
requesting that the decision be amended to include surcharges
and interests, for which allegedly Garay had become liable in
view of his admission of tax deficiency. The court amended the
decision by requiring legal interest but refused to include the
surcharge. The Government appealed the case.

HELD: The lower court’s decision should be affirmed for
the “confession of judgment,” under the fact stated, partook
of the nature of a compromise. In consideration of Garay’s
admission of delinquency and the Commissioner’s willingness
to allow payment on installments, both parties had agreed to
put an end to the litigation, through the rendition of a judgment
incorporating said stipulations. The decision appealed from is
one based on a compromise agreement.
Dasalla, Sr. v. CFI
GR 51461, April 26, 1991

FACTS: For the death of his son who died when the
passenger jeepney driven and owned by Sumangil featured in
an accident, Dasalla sued Sumangil for damages. Sumangil in
his answer prayed for the dismissal of the complaint, claiming
that his civil obligation to Dasalla was already settled.
The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground
that the obligation had been fully paid as shown by the
“Sinumpaang Salaysay” executed by Dasalla.

(3) Compromise in Criminal Tax Cases

ISSUE: Whether the “Sinumpaang Salaysay” which was
made the basis of the dismissal of the complaint is contrary
to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs, or
prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law.

In criminal case, the compromise entered into between
the taxpayer and the Commissioner must be made PRIOR to
the filing of the information in court (payment may of course
be made later). Before the compromise reaches the office of the

Fiscal (now Prosecutor), the Fiscal’s (Prosecutor’s) consent is
not required after it reaches the office of the Fiscal (Prosecutor),
but PRIOR to the filing of the information in court, the consent
of Fiscal (Prosecutor) is required. AFTER the filing of the
information in court, there can be no COMPROMISE, with
or without the consent of the Fiscal (Prosecutor). (People v.
Magdaluyo, L-16236, April 20, 1961) Unlike the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue, the Commissioner of Customs is today
NOT authorized to compromise. (People v. Ignacio Desiderio,
L-20805, Nov. 29, 1965)
Art. 2035. No compromise upon the following questions:
(1) The civil status of persons;
(2) The validity of a marriage or a legal separation;
(3) Any ground for legal separation;
(4) Future support;
(5) The jurisdiction of courts;
(6) Future legitime.

COMMENT:
(1) Questions on Which There Can Be No Valid Compromise
The Article mentions 6 instances or questions where a
compromise is VOID.

Art. 2036

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(4) Support

Future conventional (not legal) support may be the subject
of compromise, for conventional support is after all based on a
contract.
(5) Jurisdiction of Courts

The “jurisdiction” of a court refers to the power of a
court to hear and determine a case. To ascertain whether
jurisdiction is present or not, the provisions of the law and
the Constitution, not the Rules of Court, should be inquired
into. (See Auyong Hian v. Court of Tax Appeals, L-25181, Jan.
11, 1967) Jurisdiction of courts over the subject matter cannot
be considered by the parties. (Nepomuceno v. Carlos, 9 Phil.
194) Upon the other hand, parties cannot deprive a court of its
jurisdiction. (Molina v. De la Riva, 6 Phil. 12 and International
Harvester Co. v. Hamburg American Line, 42 Phil. 845)

One Heart Sporting Club, Inc. v.
The Court of Appeals
GR 53790, Oct 23, 1981

After voluntarily submitting a cause and encountering
an adverse decision on the merits, it is too late for the loser
to question the jurisdiction or power of the court. It is an
“undesirable practice” to accept a judgment only if it is favorable
and to attack it for lack of jurisdiction when adverse.

(2) Status

Tan, et al. v. Republic
L-27713, Feb. 10, 1981

Civil status of the parents and the filiation of the children
cannot be ordered and recorded in the Civil Registry in mere
summary proceedings.
(3) Recognition of Illegitimate Child

Recognition of an illegitimate child is not prohibited. And
if a child has already been recognized, and there is no dispute
concerning his status, his share in the inheritance proceedings
may be the subject of compromise. (Lajom v. Viola, 73 Phil.
563)

236

Solidum v. Sta. Maria
Administrative Case 1858, Dec. 26, 1984

Civil liability may be compromised, but not the criminal
offense.

Art. 2036. A compromise comprises only those objects
which are definitely stated therein, or which by necessary
implication from its terms should be deemed to have been
included in the same.
A general renunciation of rights is understood to refer
only to those that are connected with the dispute which was
the subject of the compromise.

COMMENT:
(1) What a Compromise Can Deal With
(a) those objects definitely stated therein
according to the terms stated
(b) those included implicitly

—

(2) Effect of General Renunciation of Rights
Even if the renunciation is GENERAL it is understood to
refer only to rights connected with the DISPUTE involved, and
not to other rights.
(3) Strict Construction of a Compromise Agreement

A compromise must be strictly construed (Ferrer v.
Ignacio, 39 Phil. 446); and can include only those expressly or
impliedly included therein. (Art. 2036) Therefore, just because
a lessee renounces possession does not mean that she waives
her right of redemption granted by another agreement. (Vitug
Dimatulac v. Coronel, 40 Phil. 686) Where a compromise
agreement is onerous, the doubt should be settled in favor of
the greatest reciprocity of interest. (Rodriguez, et al. v. Belgica,
et al., L-10801, Feb. 28, 1961)

International Hotel Corp., et al. v.
Hon. Elias Asuncion
L-39669, March 10, 1975

Art. 2037. A compromise has upon the parties the effect
and authority of res judicata; but there shall be no execution
except in compliance with a judicial compromise.

l. h.

u.

(1) Res Judicata Effect of a Compromise

A compromise, being a contract, has the effect of res
judicata only if there has been no vitiated consent. (Scjona v.
238

Sheriff, L-5603, Aug. 24, 1954) And, therefore, it is not exactly
the same as the res judicata referred to in the law of procedure.
Generally, however, the compromise binds the parties even
without judicial approval. (Meneses v. De la Rosa, 17 Phil. 34)
However, if there is no judicial approval, it can be enforced
only by a court litigation, not by execution. (Art. 2037; Salazar
v. Jarabe, 91 Phil. 596) Incidentally, a compromise or amicable
settlement before a court of justice, even if reduced to writing
is NOT VALID unless signed by the parties. (Simeon O. Cruz,
et al. v. Court of Agrarian Relations, et al., L-121131-32, Dec.
29, 1965)

Cruz, et al. v. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al.
GR 72806, Jan. 9, 1989

It is hornbook knowledge that a judgment on compromise
has the effect of res judicata on the parties and should not be
disturbed except for vices of consent or forgery.
To challenge the same, a party must move in the trial
court to set aside the said judgment and also to annul the
compromise agreement itself, before he can appeal from that
judgment.
(2) Judicial Compromise

A court cannot include in a compromise judgment terms
which have not been agreed upon between the parties except
if the same are required by law or by the Rules to be included
or are necessary consequences of the stipulations. This grave
abuse of discretion can be corrected by certiorari.

COMMENT:

Art. 2037

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

If a compromise is approved by the court, a stipulation
therein is considered a court order, and if not complied with, the
non-performance may be considered contempt of court.( Marquez
v. Marquez, 73 Phil. 74) Indeed, a compromise agreement
submitted by the parties to the court for approval with the
request that judgment be rendered in accordance therewith,
and accordingly approved by the court and incorporated into
its decision, is not merely a contract which may be enforced
by ordinary action for specific performance, but is part and
parcel of the judgment and may, therefore, be enforced as
such, by writ of execution. (Tria v. Lirag, L-13994, April 29,
1961) In fact, even if judicially approved, a writ of execution is
necessary for the enforcement of a judicial compromise. (Ibid,
and Adriano Amante v. Court of Agrarian Relations & Sergio
Pama, L-21283, Oct. 22, 1966) If the compromise agreement
or the court itself fails to state when the stipulations in the
239

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2037

compromise are supposed to be fulfilled, the court may fix the
period, thus giving full force to the agreement. (Alano v. Cortes,
L-15276, Nov. 28, 1960; See Art. 1197 of the Civil Code)

Republic v. Court of Appeals
L-47381 and L-47420, Jan. 31, 1985

When there is a compromise agreement that is submitted
to a court, a decision may be rendered based on said compromise.

Federis v. Sunga
L-34893, Jan. 17, 1985
One may consent by estoppel to a judicial compromise.
And by virtue of such consent, he cannot generally subsequently
appeal the judicial compromise to a higher court.
(3) Judgment Generally Not Appealable

A judgment on compromise is not generally appealable
and may therefore be immediately executory, unless a motion
is filed to set aside the error on the ground of vitiated consent,
in which case an appeal may be taken from a court order
denying the motion to set aside the compromise. (Masters
Tours and Travel Corp. v. Court of Appeals, 219 SCRA 321
[1993]) The reason for the rule is that when both parties enter
into an agreement to end a pending litigation and request that
a decision be rendered approving said agreement, it is only
natural to presume that such action constitutes an implicit, as
undeniable as an express, waiver of the right to appeal against
the decision. For a party to reserve under the circumstances,
the right to appeal against said decision, is to adopt an attitude
of bad faith which courts cannot countenance. (Serrano, et al.
v. Reyes, et al., L-16163, Dec. 29, 1960) To be entitled to appeal
from a judgment approving a compromise, a party must move,
not only to set aside said judgment, but also to annul or set
aside, the compromise itself, on the ground of fraud, mistake,
or duress, vitiating his consent to said compromise. (Ibid.) The
claim that a judgment based on a compromise is not a decision
in contemplation of law simply because it does not contain any
finding of fact or law is untenable, for the reason that, when a
compromise agreement is approved by a court, and the same
is embodied in a decision the theory is that the court merely
240

Art. 2037

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

adopts the statement of facts and of law reached therein,
thereby doing nothing except to impress its approval. (Pedro
Manioque, et al. v. Ceferino F. Cayco, et al., L-l 7059, Nov. 29,
1965)

(4) Judgment by Wage Administration Service

A judgment rendered by the Wage Administration Ser¬
vice, without an agreement to arbitrate, is not a judgment
at all that can be enforced through a writ of execution. It is
nothing more than a finding that the claim is meritorious and

justifies the filing of a complaint in court. (Cebrero u. Talaman,
L-11924, May 16, 1968, applying Sec. 14 of the Services Code
of Rules and Regulations, and Sec. 9, to implement RA 602
and Gomez v. North Camarines Lumber Co., L-l 1945, Aug. 18,
1958) An order of the WAS investigator dismissing the claim
“without prejudice" does not bar a subsequent action filed in
court for the same. (Winch v. Kiener Co., Ltd., L-11884, Oct. 27,
1958)

(5) When Judgment on Compromise is Void

A judgment based upon a compromise entered into by
an attorney without specific authority from the client is null
and void. Such judgment may be impugned, and its execution
restrained in any proceeding by the party against whom it is
sought to be enforced. (Jacinto v. Montesa, L-23098, Feb. 28,
1967)

(6) Effect of a Judicial Compromise on Persons Not Original

Parties

Rodriguez v. Alikpala
L-38314, June 25, 1974

FACTS: To put an end to a court action, a motion for
a judgment on compromise was filed. In the compromise
agreement, third parties were sureties. All the parties to the
compromise, including the sureties (who were not original
parties to the case) asked for the approval of the compromise.
Later, a judgment based on such compromise was rendered.
When the defendants failed to comply with its provisions,
a motion for execution was filed, and granted, against the
241

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2038

defendants and the sureties. The sureties now complain,
alleging that the writ of execution cannot be issued against
their properties because they were not parties to the case. Can
the writ be issued against their properties?
HELD: Yes, because they had joined the others in asking
for a judgment on compromise, and they are therefore now in
estoppel.

The presence of invalid stipulations in a compromise
agreement does not render void the whole agreement,
where such invalid stipulations are independent of
the rest of the terms of the agreement and can easily
be separated therefrom without doing violence to the
manifest intention of the parties. (Velayo v. Court of
Appeals, et al., 107 Phil. 587)

(2) Modification of a Judgment on Compromise

Bobis v. Provincial Sheriff of Camarines Norte
GR 29838, March 18, 1983

If a writ of execution is issued to enforce a judgment
based on a compromise, the writ cannot be enforced against
a person who although a party to the case, was not a party to
the compromise agreement, and who in fact had been absolved
from liability.
Art. 2038. A compromise in which there is mistake,
fraud, violence, intimidation, undue influence, or falsity of
documents, is subject to the provisions of Article 1330 of this

Code.
However, one of the parties cannot set up a mistake offact
as against the other if the latter, by virtue of the compromise
has withdrawn from a litigation already commenced.

If a court renders a judgment on compromise, it generally
cannot modify the compromise unless the parties consent or
unless there is a hearing to determine the presence or absence
of vitiated consent. (Yboleon v. Sison, 59 Phil. 281)
Art. 2039. When the parties compromise generally on
all differences which they might have with each other, the
discovery of documents referring to one or more but not
to all of the questions settled shall not itself be a cause for
annulment or rescission of the compromise, unless said
documents have been concealed by one of the parties.
But, the compromise may be annulled or rescinded if it
refers only to one thing to which one of the parties has no
right, as shown by the newly*discovered documents.

to set aside the compromise, even if the compromise was
approved by the court. (Saminiada v. Mata, 92 Phil. 426)

of the existence of the final judgments. (See Rovero v. Amparo,

City of Zamboanga v. Mandi
GR 86760, April 30, 1991

FACTS: On Feb. 11, 1982, Zamboanga City lodged
a complaint for eminent domain against Julian over the
latter’s lot. The expropriation was intended to expand the
Pasonanca Park. The trial court gave the city authority
244

Art 2041

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

to take possession of the property upon payment of just
compensation fixed at P0.18 per square meter, or P10,428.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment. On Feb. 12,
1987, Julian filed a notice of appeal to the Supreme Court.
On March 16, 1987, Julian wrote the OIC Mayor, stating,
inter alia, that pending appeal, they were accepting the
offer of the City to buy the lot at P3.00 per square meter.
The Sangguniang Panglunsod adopted a resolution on
May 13, 1987 authorizing the OIC Mayor to enter into a
compromise agreement for the acquisition of the lot for P3
per square meter subject to the approval of the Supreme
Court. On June 4, 1987, the Agreement was signed.
On the same date, the parties filed with the Supreme
Court a motion to approve compromise agreement. On
Jan. 6, 1988, notwithstanding the non-approval yet of
the compromise agreement by the Supreme Court, the
Sangguniang Panglunsod authorized the OIC Mayor
to sign for and on behalf of the City the Deed of Sale
covering the acquisition by the City of the lot at P3.00
per square meter. The resolution did not impose any
condition of prior approval by the Supreme Court. And
so it was that pursuant to the authorization granted, the
Deed was signed by the parties on Jan. 11, 1988 for and in
consideration of P170.595 at P3 per square meter. On Feb.
4, 1988, the City received a copy of the Entry of Judgment
of the Appellate Court showing that it had become final
and executory on Feb. 21, 1987. Significantly, the Entry
of Judgment was made only on Jan. 26, 1988. On March
21, 1988, on the ground that the City was reneging on
the Compromise Agreement, Julian instituted before the
RTC a petition for mandamus praying that the City be
made to comply with the agreement “particularly to pay
Julian P170.595 for the purchases of the lot.” The Judge
issued the writ, approved the sale entered into between
the parties as a result of the Compromise Agreement,
and ordered the City to pay P170.595 for the property
at P3 per square meter. The judge relied on the ruling
that a final judgment may be novated by the subsequent
agreement of the parties.
HELD: The Supreme Court found the writ of
mandamus properly issued and dismissed the City’s
245

Art. 2041

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

petition and held that it is true that in its resolution of
May 13, 1987, the City had authorized the execution of
the Compromise Agreement and the Deed of Sale “subject
to the approval of the Supreme Court.” However, the
subsequent acts of the parties clearly show that the City
was no longer insisting on the suspensive condition.
Thus, with the Judge’s decision “immediately after the
filing of notice of appeal to the Supreme Court, the QIC
Mayor negotiated for the purchase of the subject at P3
per square meter “to prevent a lengthy litigation at the
Supreme Court and where respondent City also paying
the same price of P3 to other adjoining lot owners.”

Julian thereupon accepted the City’s offer. Further, the
subsequent Sangguniang Panglunsod resolution did
away with that condition. To cap it all, the Deed was
signed by the parties fully cognizant that such approval
had not been obtained. By virtue of the settlement thus
arrived at, Julian abandoned his appeal to the Supreme
Court and withdrew from a pending litigation. All these
developments transpired before the entry of the Appellate
Court. Judgment was made on Jan. 26, 1988. To all intents
and purposes, new rights and obligations as between the
parties had been created of their own volition. There was
an animus novandi and an obvious intent to supersede
the previous agreement in the Eminent Domain case.
With this, the decision must be deemed to have been
novated by the parties themselves, with the result that
the original decision had lost force and effect. The finality
of the appellate court decision which was unknown to
the parties at the time of settlement, neither produced
any legal effect since the appeal had effectively been
withdrawn. There was no longer any lower court decision
that could be the subject of an appeal. The City maintains
that it was not aware of the abandonment of the appeal
for which reason it entered into the compromise. This is
not accurate since it was made known that the dismissal
of the appeal was being made as a reciprocal concession
for the settlement. Besides, under Art. 2038 of the Civil
Code, “one of the parties can not set up mistake of fact
against the other if the latter, by virtue of the compromise
246

Art. 2041

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

has withdrawn from a litigation already commenced.”
It may be conceded that the City was unaware that the
judgment in the Eminent Domain case had attained
finality. Ignorance of a judgment is not a valid ground for
attacking a compromise. The course of action should have
been an action for rescission which has not been availed of
here. Article 2040 of the Civil Code explicitly provided: “If
after a litigation has been decided by a final judgment, a
compromise should be agreed upon, either or both parties
being unaware of the existence of the final judgment, the
compromise may be rescinded.” Ignorance of a judgment
which may be revoked or set aside is not a valid ground for
attacking a compromise. Julian was well within his right
in seeking the enforcement of the compromise through a
petition for mandamus on the strength of Art. 2041 of the
Civil Code, providing that: “If one of the parties fails or
refuses to abide by the compromise, the other party may
either enforce the compromise or regard it as rescinded
and insist upon his original demand.”
(b)

or rescind it and insist on his original demand.

In either case, damages may be recovered if there
should be additional injury caused by failure to abide by
the terms of the compromise.
Barreras, et al. v. Hon. Garcia, et al.
L-44715-16, Jan. 26, 1989

While the approval of the compromise agreement
by the court dismisses the case, or considers it closed,
the law, however, anticipates situations wherein the
parties refuse to comply with the terms of a compromise
agreement.
Clearly, therefore, when a party fails or refuses
to abide by the compromise, the other party may either
enforce the compromise by a writ of execution, or regard
it as rescinded and insist upon his original demand.
Non-fulfillment of the terms of the compromise justifies
execution.

Art. 2042. The same persons who may enter into a

The Court has consistently ruled that a party to a
compromise cannot ask for a rescission after it has enjoyed its
benefits.

COMMENT:
(1) ‘Arbitration’ Defined

Arbitration is the process whereby by mutual agreement
a third party decides a dispute between two persons.

r

Mindanao Portland Cement Corp. v. McDonough
L-23390, April 24, 1967
FACTS: In a contract, there was a provision requiring
arbitration in case of certain disputes concerning materials,
plans, etc. After a particular dispute, one party went to court to
compel the other to submit the matter to arbitrators.
ISSUE: May the court decide the dispute on the merits?

„

HELD: No. All it can do, in this summary proceeding to
enforce the arbitration proviso, is to determine whether or
not the parties should really go to the arbitrators. Arguments
on the merits must not be addressed to the court, but to the
arbitrators.

Bengson v. Chan
L-27283, July 29, 1977

FACTS: In a contract for the construction of a condominium
building, it was expressly agreed that should there be any
dispute, a board of arbitrators must first be resorted to before
taking any judicial action. The owner went to court because the
building was not finished on time, but there was no prior resort
to arbitration.
ISSUE: Will the case now be dismissed?
248

249

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2042

HELD: No, the case will not be dismissed, although there
was no prior resort to arbitration. This is so because under the
arbitration law, in a case like this, what the court should do is
to refer the matter to the arbitrators who are supposed to be
selected by the parties.
Allied Ranking Corp. v. Court of Appeals and BPI
GR 123871, Aug. 31, 1998

FACTS: By participating in the clearing operations of
the Philippine Clearing House Corporation (PCHC), petitioner
agreed to submit disputes of this nature to arbitration.
ISSUE: Can PCHC invoke the jurisdiction of the trial
courts without a prior recourse to the PCHC Arbitration
Committee?
HELD: No. Having given its free and voluntary consent
to the arbitration clause, petitioner cannot unilaterally take
it back according to its whim. In the world of commerce,
especially in the field of banking, the promised word is crucial.
Once given, it may no longer be broken. Arbitration as an
alternative method of dispute resolution is encouraged by the
Supreme Court. Aside from unclogging judicial dockets, it also
hastens solutions especially of commercial disputes.

LM Power Engineering Corp. v. Capitol Industrial
Construction Groups, Inc.
GR L-141833, March 26, 2003
. ,
FACTS: In a dispute involving electrical work at the
Third Part of Zamboanga, petitioner took over some of the work
contracted to petitioner. Allegedly, the latter failed to finish it
because of the inability to procure materials. Upon completion
of its task under the contract, petitioner killed respondent in
an amount contested for its accuracy by respondent. The latter
also took refuge in the termination clause of the contract. That
clause allowed it to set-off the cost of the work that petitioner
had failed to undertake due to termination or takeover
against the amount it owed the latter.
Because of the dispute, petitioner filed a complaint with
the Regional Trial Court (RTC) for collection of the amount
representing alleged balance due it under the contract. Instead
of filing an answer, respondent filed a motion to dismiss,

—

250

—

Art. 2042

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

alleging the complaint was premature because there was no
prior recourse to arbitration. The RTC denied the motion and
after trial, it directed respondent to pay petitioner the amount
of the claim.
Petitioner claims there is no conflict regarding interpre¬
tation or implementation of the agreement. Without having to
resort to prior arbitration, it is entitled to collect the value of
services rendered through an ordinary action for collection of a
sum of money from respondent. Upon the other hand, respon¬
dent contends there is need for prior arbitration as provided in
the agreement.
ISSUE: Whether or not certain provisions of the
agreement could be applied to the facts owing to parties’
incongruent position regarding the dispute.
HELD: The instant case involves technical discrepancies
that are better left to an arbitral body that has expertise in
those areas. In any event, the inclusion of an arbitration clause
in a contract does not ipso facto divest the courts of jurisdiction
to pass upon the findings of arbitral bodies, because awards
are still judicially reviewable under certain conditions. And
because there was no prior referral to arbitration, the Supreme
Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals directing
the parties to refer their dispute for arbitration in accordance
with their contract.
Be that as it may, alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
methods — like arbitration, mediation, negotiation, and
are encouraged by the Supreme Court. By
conciliation
enabling parties to resolve their disputes amicably, they
provide solutions that are less consuming, less tedious, less
confrontational, and more productive of goodwill and lasting

Arbitration, as an alternative mode of settling disputes,
has long been recognized and accepted in our jurisdiction.( Chap.

also expressly authorizes arbitration of domestic disputes.
Foreign arbitration as a system of settling commercial
disputes of an international character was likewise recognized
when the Philippines adhered to the United Nations
“Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
Arbitral Awards of 1958,” under the May 10, 1965 Resolution
71 of the Philippine Senate, giving reciprocal recognition and
allowing enforcement of international agreements between
parties of different nationalities within a contracting state.

(4) Some Observations

“In all international commercial arbitration cases,” it
has been observed that “parties always agree, either in their
arbitration agreements or in their agreed arbitration rules,
that the award to be rendered by the arbitrator shall be final
and binding.” (Arthur P. Autea, "International Commercial
Arbitration: The Philippine Experience," Philippine Law
Journal, Vol. 77, No. 2, Dec. 2002, p. 145) In fact, both the
Philippine Civil Code (Art. 2044) and the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules (Art. 32[2]), respectively, recognize the
validity of any stipulation that the arbitrator’s award or
decision “shall be final” and “binding on the parties” with the
latter “undertak[ing] to carry out the award without delay.”

Lamentably, however, “losing parties not only appeal but
also assail the factual findings (See Sec. 24, The Arbitration
Law) and appreciation of evidence by the arbitrator “in the hope
of re-litigating anew what the arbitrator had already settled.
(Autea, "Infl Comm’ I Arbitration: The Phil. Experience,’ supra)
Question of Fact and of Law Re Arbitral Awards
Asset Privatization Trust v. Court of Appeals
300 SCRA 579
(1998)

As a rule, the award of an arbitrator cannot be set aside for
mere errors of judgment either as to the law or as to the facts.
Courts are without power to amend or overrule merely because
of disagreement with matters of law or facts determined by the
arbitrators. They will not review the findings of law and fact
contained in an award, and will not undertake to substitute
their judgment for that of the arbitrators, since any other rule
would make an award the commencement, not the end, of
litigation.

Errors of law and fact, or an erroneous decision of matters
submitted to the judgment of the arbitrators, are insufficient to
invalidate an award fairly and honestly made. Judicial review
of an arbitration is, thus, more limited than judicial review
of a trial. Nonetheless, the arbitrator’s award is not absolute
and without exceptions. The arbitrators cannot resolve issues
256

Art. 2044

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

beyond the scope of the submission agreement. Parties to such
an agreement are bound by the arbitrators’ award only to the
extent and in the manner prescribed by the contract and only
if the award is rendered in conformity thereto.
(5) The Matter of ‘Filing Fee’

Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. (SIOL) v. Asuncion
170 SCRA 274
(1989)

It is not simply the filing of the complaint or appropriate
initiatory pleading but the payment of the prescribed docket
fee, that vests a trial court with jurisdiction over the subject
matter or nature of the action.
(.NOTE: At any time within one month after the award is
made, any party to the controversy which was arbitrated may
apply to the court having jurisdiction for an order confirming
the award. [Sec. 23, The Arbitration Law])

(6) Court to Decide All Motions, Petitions, or Applications

Within 10 Days After Hearing

The court shall decide all motions, petitions, or
applications filed under the provisions of the Arbitration Law,
within 10 days after such motions, petitions, or applications
have been heard by it. (Sec. 6, The Arbitration Law)
(NOTE: “While some Philippine courts are able to see

through the dilatory tactics of the losing party, and eventually
uphold the enforcement of the foreign arbitral award, the
sad part is that they are unable to resolve the dilatory issues
within the 10-day period under Sec. 6 of the Arbitration Law.
Section 6 is honored more in the breach than in the observance.
It is probably not an exaggeration to state that it is hardly
observed at all. But if Sec. 6 were to be consciously observed by
Philippine courts, the delay that losing parties may interpose
will be short-lived and will not succeed in frustrating the
enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.” [A.P. Autea, “Infl
Comm’I Arbitration: The Phil. Experience,” supra, p. 149])

only interfere with great reluctance to anticipate or nullify the
action of the arbitrator.” [Cited in A.P. Autea, “Inf I Comm’l
Arbitration: The Phil. Experience,” op. cit., p. 154])

(1993)

Since there obtains a written provision for arbitration as
well as failure on respondent’s part to comply therewith, the
court rightly ordered the parties to proceed to their arbitration
in accordance with the terms of their agreement. (Sec. 6, The
Arbitration Law [RA 876])
Respondent’s arguments touching upon the merits of
the dispute are improperly raised. They should be addressed
to the arbitrators. The duty of the court in this case is not to
resolve the merits of the parties’ claims but only to determine if
they should proceed to arbitration or not. (Mindanao Portland
Cement Corp. v. McDonough Construction Co. of Florida, 19
SCRA 808 [1987])
(7) Inclusion of Third Parties as Additional Parties to

Defeat an Arbitration Clause
Toyota Motor Phils. Corp. v. Court of Appeals
216 SCRA 236
(1992)

The contention that the arbitration clause has become
dysfunctional because of the presence of third parties is
untenable. (See the following cases: Associate Bank v. CA, 233
SCRA 137 [1994]; Allied Banking Corp. v. CA, 294 SCRA 803
[1998); and Home Bankers Savings & Trust Co. v. CA, 318
SCRA 558 [1999])
(NOTE: In the cases of Associate Bank v. CA, supra
and Allied Banking Corp. v. CA, supra, the Supreme Court
dismissed a third-party complaint and directed the parties
therein to arbitrate, regardless of the related principal action
that was then pending in court. [Cited in A.P. Autea, “Infl
Comm’l Arbitration: The Phil. Experience,” supra, p. 155]
In Home Bankers Savings & Trust Co., supra, it was held:
“Arbitration, as an alternative method of dispute resolution
is encouraged. Aside from unclogging judicial dockets, it also
hastens solutions especially of commercial disputes. The Court
looks with favor upon such amicable arrangements and will

(8) The Del Monte Case

The relatively recent case of Del Monte Corp.-USA v.
CA (351 SCRA 373 [2001]), according to an acknowledged
authority on international arbitration practice, “gave rise to
the
a new problem in international commercial arbitration

—

,

inclusion of third parties as additional parties to defeat an
arbitration clause." (A.P. Autea, “Infl Comm’l Arbitration: The
Phil. Experience," supra, p. 149) He submits that the decision
of the Supreme Court in the Del Monte case threatens to
radically depart from establish jurisprudence in the subject
of arbitration consistently observed by the precedent cases
earlier alluded to in Associated Bank v. CA, Allied Banking
Corp. v. CA, and Home Bankers Savings & Trust Co. v. CA,
and which all spr[u]ng from the landmark case of Toyota Motor
Phils. Corp. v. CA. (Ibid., p. 155) He adds that “(w]ith the Del
Monte decision, the pronouncement [earlier quoted] in Home
Bankers Savings & Trust Co. v. CA, inevitably fades into
history.” (Ibid., p. 154)

Del Monte Corp.-USA v. Court of Appeals
351 SCRA 373
(2001)

FACTS: Under a distributorship agreement, Del Monte
Corp.-USA (“Del Monte”) appointed Montebueno Marketing,
Inc. (“Montebueno”) as sole and exclusive distributor of the
former’s products in the Philippines.
The agreement provided for the following arbitration
clause re governing law and arbitration:
“This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
the State of California and/or, if applicable, the United
States of America. All disputes arising out of or relating
in this agreement or the parties’ relationship, including
the termination thereof, shall be resolved by arbitration
in the City of San Francisco, State of California, under
the Rules of American Arbitration Association.
259

Art. 2044

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

•

“The arbitration panel shall consist of three members,
one of whom shall be selected by [Del Monte], one of whom
shall be selected by [Montebueno], and third of whom
shall be selected by the other two members and shall have
relevant experience in the industry. The parties further
agree that neither shall commence any litigation against
the other arising out of this Agreement or the termination
thereof as to any matter not subject to arbitration or with
respect to any arbitration proceeding or award, except
in a court located in the State of California. Each party
consents to jurisdiction over it by and exclusive venue in
such a court.”

Montebueno, et al., filed a complaint against Del Monte,
et al., for violation of Arts. 20, 21 and 23 of the Civil Code.
The former alleged that the latter’s products continued to be
brought into the country by parallel importers despite the
appointment of Montebueno as sole and exclusive distributor
of Del Monte products thereby causing them (Montebueno, et
al.) great embarrassment and substantial damage. Del Monte,
et al. filed a “Motion to Suspend Proceedings” invoking the
arbitration clause in the distributorship agreement and Sec. 7
of the Arbitration Law (RA 876) re stay of civil action.

The trial court deferred consideration of the motion
rationalizing that “the grounds alleged therein do not
constitute [grounds for] the suspension of the proceedings as
this action is for damages with prayer for the issuance of [a]
Writ of Preliminary Attachment and not on the distributorship
agreement.” Subsequently, however, the trial court issued an
order denying the motion based on the ground that it “will
not serve the ends of justice and to allow said suspension
will only delay the determination of the issues, frustrate the
quest of the parties for a judicious determination of their
respective claims, and/or deprive and delay their rights to seek
redress.” But, in so disposing, the trial court had occasion to
contravene the doctrine laid down in Puromines, Inc. v. Court
of Appeals (220 SCRA 281 [1993]), where it was ruled: “Since
there obtains a written provision for arbitration as well as
failure on respondent’s part to comply therewith, the court
rightly ordered the parties to proceed to their arbitration in
accordance with the terms of their agreement. (Sec. 6, RA
260

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2044

876) Respondent’s arguments touching upon the merits of the

dispute are improperly raised. They should be addressed to the
arbitrators. The duty of the court in this case is not to resolve
the merits of the parties’ claims but only to determine if they
should proceed to arbitration or not.” (Ibid., citing Mindanao
Portland Cement Corp. v. McDonough Construction Co. of
Florida, L-23390, 19 SCRA 808 [1967])

On appeal, the Court of Appeals (CA) affirmed the trial
court on the ground that the alleged damaging acts required
the interpretation of Art. 21 of the Civil Code and that in
determining whether Del Monte, et al. had violated said
provision would require a full-blown trial. Del Monte filed
a Motion for Reconsideration but the motion was denied.
Thereupon, Del Monte filed a petition for certiorari with the
Supreme Court, and which the latter denied on Feb. 7, 2001.
In affirming the CA, the highest tribunal also directed the trial
court to proceed with the hearing of the case.

In holding that the arbitration clause in the distributorship
agreement only applied to the parties thereto, the Supreme
Court opined that only parties to the Agreement, i.e., petitioners
[Del Monte Corp.-USA (DMC-USA)] and its Managing Director
for Export Sales Paul E. Derby, Jr. and private respondents
[Montebueno Marketing, Inc.] and its Managing Director Lily
Sy are bound by the Agreement and its arbitration clause as
they are the only signatories thereto. Petitioners Daniel Collins
and Luis Hidalgo, and private respondent [Salvosa Foods,
Inc.], not parties to the Agreement cannot even be considered
assigns or heirs of the parties, are not bound by the Agreement

and the arbitration clause therein.

Consequently, referral to arbitration in the State
of California pursuant to the arbitration clause and the
suspension of the proceedings in Civil Case 2637-MN pending
the return of the arbitral award could be called for but only
as to petitioners DMC-USA and P.E. Derby, Jr., and private
respondents Montebueno and L. Sy, and not as to the other
parties in this case. This is consistent with the case of Heirs of
Augusto L. Salas, Jr. v. Laperal Realty Corp. (320 SCRA 610
[1990]), which superseded that of Toyota Motor Phils. Corp. v.
Court of Appeals (216 SCRA 236 [1992]).
261

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2044

[216 SCRA 236 (1992)], the Del Monte Case [supra] needs to

In Toyota, Motor Phils. Corp. v. CA(supra), “the contention
that the arbitration clause has become dysfunctional because
of the presence of third parties is untenable [considering that]
contracts are respected as the law between the contracting
parties [and] as such, the parties are thereby expected to abide
with good faith in their contractual commitments.” However,
in Salas, Jr. v. Laperal Realty Corp, (supra), only parties to the
agreement, their assigns or heirs have the right to arbitrate
or could be compelled to arbitrate. In recognizing the right of
the contracting parties to arbitrate or to compel arbitration,
the splitting of the proceedings to arbitration as to some of the
parties on one hand and trial for the others upon the other
hand, or the suspension of trial pending arbitration between
some of the parties, should not be allowed as it would, in
effect, result in multiplicity of suits, duplicitous procedure and

be revisited. The Salas case [supra] which was rendered by
a division (of the Court], cannot overturn the doctrine laid
down in [the] Toyota case [supra], which was rendered by
another division, without running afoul with the mandatory
provision under Art. VII, Sec. 4[3] of the 1987 Phil. Const.,
which reads that cases or matters heard by a division shall be
divided or resolved with the concurrence of a majority of the
Members who actually took part in the deliberations on the
issues in the case and voted thereon, and in no case, without
the concurrence of at least three of such Members. When the
required number is not obtained, the case shall be decided en
banc. Provided, That no doctrine or principle of law laid down
by the court in a decision rendered en banc or in division may
be modified or reversed except by the court sitting en banc.
The case of Republic v. Delos Angeles [159 SCRA 264 (1988)],
declared this constitutional provision as mandatory.” [A.P.
Autea, “International Commercial Arbitration: The Philippine
Experience," Philippine Law Journal, Vol. 77, No. 2, Dec. 2002,
p. 156J)

unnecessary delay.

Accordingly, the object of arbitration is to allow the
expeditious determination of a dispute. Clearly, the issue
before this Court could be speedily and efficiently resolved
in its entirety if simultaneous arbitration proceedings and
trial, or suspension of trial pending arbitration are allowed.
The interest of justice would only be served if the trial court
hears and adjudicates the case in a single albeit complete
proceedings.
Del Monte, et al. filed a Motion for Reconsideration
which
was denied by the Supreme Court in a Resolution
but
dated July 18, 2001. Held the Court: “The inclusion of third
parties to defeat the arbitration clause presupposes bad faith.
And bad faith is never presumed. In the instant case, it is not
alleged nor even hinted at that the inclusion of third parties
was specifically and intentionally done to negate the effect of
the arbitration clause. Consequently, the pronouncement of
the Court in Salas, Jr. v. Laperal Realty Corp, (supra) that
only parties to the agreement, their assigns or heirs have the
right to arbitrate, or could be compelled to arbitrate, must be
adopted."
(NOTE: “With the declaration of the Supreme Court in
Del Monte Corp.-USA v. CA [351 SCRA 373 (2001)] that “the

GUARANTY
Chapter 1

NATURE AND EXTENT OF GUARANTY

Art. 2047. By guaranty a person, called the guarantor,
binds himself to the creditor to fulfill the obligation of the
principal debtor in case the latter should fail to do so.
If a person binds himself solidarity with the principal
debtor, the provisions of Section 4, Chapter 3, Title I of this
Book shall be observed. In such case the contract is called a
suretyship.

INTRODUCTORY COMMENT:
(1) Guaranty in the Broad Sense

Guaranty may be:
(a)

(b)

personal guaranty;
or real guaranty.

COMMENT:
(1) Guaranty in the Strict Sense

(2) Personal Guaranty

This Article refers to guaranty properly so-called, or
guaranty in the strict sense. The first paragraph defines this
contract of guaranty. The parties thereto are the guarantor
and the creditor. Strictly speaking, the contract between the
debtor and the guarantors is called the contract of indemnity.

This may be in the form of:
(a) guaranty (properly so-called or guaranty in the strict
sense)
(b)

suretyship (one where the surety binds himself solidarity,
not subsidiarily, with the principal debtor). (See The
Manila Insurance Co., Inc. v. Amurao, 688 SCRA 609

FACTS: PAG and CJV were charged with and
convicted of estafa. The people’s evidence
a receipt

—

reads:

—

“Received from MJL one diamond ring, which I
agree to sell for P85.000 on commission basis and pay her
in the following manner: P85.000 — post-dated check.
It is understood that in the event the above post-dated
check is dishonored on its due date, the total payment
265

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2047

of the above item, shall become immediately due and
demandable without awaiting further demand.
“I guarantee that the above check will be sufficiently
funded on the due date.
(SGD) PAG I guarantee jointly and severally.” (SGD)
CJV
HELD: The joint and several undertaking assumed
by CJV in a separate writing below the main body of the
receipt merely guaranteed the civil obligation of PAG to
pay MJL the value of the ring in the event PAG failed
to return the article. It cannot be construed as assuming
any criminal responsibility consequent upon the failure of
PAG to return the right or deliver its value.

When a person acts merely as a guarantor of the
obligation assumed by another to a third person for the
return of such third person’s right or the delivery of its
value, whatever liability was incurred by the principal
obligor for defaulting on such obligation, that of the
guarantor consequent upon such default is merely civil,
not criminal. It is error therefore, to convict the guarantor
of estafa.
(b)

Generally, there must be a meeting of the minds between
said parties. (PNB v. Garcia, 47 Phil. 662; Texas [Phil.] Co.
v. Alonzo, 73 Phil. 90) In general, therefore, the creditor
must notify the guarantor that the former is accepting the
guaranty, unless the guaranty is not merely an offer but
a direct and unconditional one. In such a case, all that is
required is for the creditor to act upon the promise; no
prior notice is needed to indicate his acceptance. (Visayas
Surety and Insurance Corporation v. Laperal, 69 Phil.
688) Reason: In a sense, the contract may be said to be
unilateral. (Ibid.)

It is consensual, nominate, accessory, unilateral (in that
only the guarantor is obligated to the creditor and not vice
versa). (See Texas [Phil.] Co. v. Alonzo, 73 Phil. 90)
(d) As to form, the contract of guaranty is governed by the
Statute of Frauds, being a special promise to answer for
(c)

266

the debt, default, or miscarriage of another.” (See Art.
1403, No. 2) Hence, an oral promise of guaranty is not
enforceable. (See Nolasco Brothers, Inc. v. Villarino, CA
17616-R, Aug. 8, 1958)
(3) Guarantor Distinguished from Surety

’

•

NOTE:
A guarantor is the insurer of the solvency of the debtor
and thus binds himself to pay if the principal is unable to
pay while a surety is the insurer of the debt, and he obligates
himself to pay if the principal does not pay. (FGU Insurance
Corp. v. Roxas, 836 SCRA 16 [2017])

(4) Surety Distinguished from a Solidary Debtor

A surety is almost the same as a solidary debtor, except

that the latter is himself a principal debtor. In all applicable
provisions, the provisions of this Title also apply to a surety.
(Manila Surety and Fidelity Co. v. Batu Construction & Co., et

al., 53 O.G. 8836)
(5) Procedure for Enforcement of Surety’s Liability

The procedure for the enforcement of the surety’s liability
under a bond for delivery of personal property is described
in Sec. 8, Rule 58 and Sec. 20, Rule 57 of the Revised Rules
of Court. (Luneta Motor Co. v. Antonio Menendez, L-16880,
April 30, 1963) In this Luneta Motor Co. case, the Court had

Ongkiko v. BPI Express Card Corp.
486 SCRA 206

FACTS: By executing an undertaking, petitioner solidarity
obliged himself to pay respondent all the liabilities incurred
under the credit card account, whether under the principal,
renewal, or extension card issued, regardless of the charges or
novation in the terms and conditions in the issuance and use of
the credit card.
ISSUE: Whether or not the surety is bound by the
liabilities of the principal until it has been fully paid.
HELD: Yes, for under the circumstances, the suretyship
agreement is a continuing one. Thus, in a similar case, the
Supreme Court exhorted prospective sureties to exercise
caution in signing treaty undertakings prepared by credit card
companies, and to read carefully the terms and conditions of
the agreement. (See Molino v. Security Diners International

The relationship is one of principal and surety

of suretyship is in essence accessory or collateral to a valid
principal obligation, the surety's liability to the creditor is
he is directly and
immediately primary, and absolute

Art. 2052

Art. 2052. A guaranty cannot exist without a valid
obligation.
Nevertheless, a guaranty may be constituted to
guarantee the performance of a voidable or an unenforceable
contract. It may also guarantee a natural obligation.

COMMENT:
(1) Can a Guaranty Exist Even Without a Valid Principal
Obligation
A guaranty is merely an accessory contract, so if the
principal obligation is void, the guaranty is also void. (De la
Rosa v. De Borja, 53 Phil. 990) However, by express provision
of the second paragraph, a guaranty can be valid even if the
principal obligation is:
(b)

voidable;
unenforceable;

(c)

natural.

(a)

(2) Consideration

The consideration of the guaranty is the same as the
consideration of the principal obligation. As long as the
principal debtor receives some benefit, this is all right even
if the guarantor himself has NOT received any benefit. (Phil.

Industries Corp. (WPIC) executed a “continuing guaranty” in
favor of Investment & Underwriting Corp, of the Phils. (IUCP),
jointly and severally guaranteeing payment of sums obtained
and to be obtained from IRI from IUCP. For failure of IRI and
WPIC to pay what IUCP had paid to Manilabank under IUCP
and IRI’s “continuing surety agreements,” IUCP, through its
successor Atrium Capital Corp. (ACC), filed a case against
them before the Manila RTC.
272

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(

,

Art. 2053

The trial court ordered IRI and WPIC to jointly and
severally pay Interbank (successor of ACC) the amount of
their indebt(ed]ness, plus, interest, liquidated the damages,
attorney’s fees, and litigation expenses. The Court of Appeals
(CA) affirmed the trial court’s ruling and denied the motion for
reconsideration filed by WPIC. On appeal, the Supreme Court
affirmed the CA’s decision.
HELD: WPIC, as guarantee, is bound by the same
consideration that makes the contract effective between
principal parties thereto. In this case, the “continuing
guaranty” would cover sums obtained and/or to be obtained
by IRI from Interbank. Hence, the contract of suretyship in
this case has both retrospective and prospective application.
Furthermore, since the “continuing guaranty” embodies an
express remuneration of the right of excussion, WPIC can be
proceeded against without first exhausting all the properties of
IRI.

Art. 2053. A guaranty may also be given as security for
future debts, the amount of which is not yet known; there
can be no claim against the guarantor until the debt is
liquidated. A conditional obligation may also be secured.

COMMENT:
(1) Guaranty for Present and Future Debts

There can be a guaranty for:
(a) present debts;
(b)

future debts (even if the amount is not yet known). (Art.
2053) Therefore, a bond posted to secure additional credit
that the principal debtor had applied for is not void just
because the said bond was signed and filed before the
additional credit was extended by the creditor. (Naric v.
Fodas, et al., L-11517, April 30, 1958)

(2) Liquidated Debt

A debt is already considered liquidated under this Article

not for more than the principal debtor, both as regards the
amount and the onerous nature of the conditions.
Should he have bound himself for more, his obligations
shall be reduced to the limits of that of the debtor.

COMMENT:
(1) Obligation of Guarantor May Be Less, But Not More

Than Obligation of Principal Debtor
Example:

FACTS: Petitioners assert that the suretyship agreement
they signed is void because there was no principal obligation
at the time of signing as the principal obligation was signed 6
months later.

A borrowed from B PIO million. No mortgage was
constituted. C guaranteed to B the payment of A’s debt, and to
show his sincerity, C even mortgaged his land in favor of B. If
A cannot pay, and C cannot pay, may B foreclose the mortgage
on O’s land?

HELD: The law allows a suretyship agreement to secure
future loans even if the amount is not yet known. (See Art.

ANS.: No. The obligation of C being merely accessory
to A's debt, it should not be more onerous than the latter. If
the principal debt is not secured by a mortgage, the guaranty
should also not be secured by a mortgage; otherwise, this would
be making the guarantor’s liability more onerous than that of
the principal debtor.

2053, Civil Code)

Of course, a surety is not bound under any particular
principal obligation until that principal obligation is bom. But
there is no theoretical or doctrinal difficulty inherent in saying
that the suretyship agreement itself is valid and binding
even before the principal obligation intended to be secured
thereby is boro, any more than there would be in saying that
obligations which are subject to a condition precedent are valid
and binding before the occurrence of the condition precedent.

Comprehensive or continuing surety agreements are,
in fact, quite commonplace in present-day financial and
commercial practice. A bank or financing company which
anticipates entering into a series of credit transactions with a
particular company, commonly requires the projected principal
debtor to execute a continuing surety agreement along with
its sureties. By executing such an agreement, the principal
places itself in a position to enter into the projected series of
transactions with its creditor. With such suretyship agreement,
there would be no need to execute a separate surety contract or
bond for each financing or credit accommodation extended to
the principal debtor.

Art. 2085, “Third persons who are not parties to the principal
obligation may secure the latter by pledging or mortgaging
their own property.” It is, of course, understood that one who
mortgages his property to guarantee another’s debt without
expressly assuming personal liability for such debt, CANNOT

Pacific Ranking Corp. v. Intermediate
Appellate Court
GR 72275, Nov. 13, 1991

FACTS: Celia Regala obtained from Pacific Banking
Corp, a Pacificard Credit Card under the terms and conditions
issued by the bank. On the same date, Roberto Regala, Jr.,
spouse of Celia, executed a “Guarantor’s undertaking” in
favor of the bank, which provides: “I/We, the undersigned,
hereby agree, jointly and severally with Celia Syjuco Regala
to pay the Pacific Banking Corporation upon demand any
and all indebtedness, obligations, charges, or liabilities due
and incurred by said Celia Syjuco Regala with the use of the
Pacificard or renewal thereof issued in his favor by the Pacific
Banking Corporation. Any changes of or Novation in the terms
and conditions in connection with the issuance or use of said
Pacificard, or any extension of time to pay such obligations,
charges or liabilities shall not in any manner release me/us
from the responsibility hereunder, it being understood that the
undertaking is a continuing one and shall subsist and bind me/
us until all the liabilities of the said Celia Syjuco Regala have
been fully satisfied or paid.” Celia as such Pacificard holder,
had purchased goods or services on credit under her Pacificard,
for which Pacific Bank advanced the cost amounting to
P92,803.98 at the time of the filing of complaint. In view of
Celia’s failure to settle her account, demand was sent to her
and to Roberto Regala under his “guarantor’s” undertaking.
Later, Pacific sued both Celia and Roberto. The trial court
rendered judgment against both Celia and Roberto who were
ordered jointly and severally to pay the bank P92,803.98 with
interest at 14% per annum from the time of demand until the
principal is fully paid plus 15% of the principal obligation as

attorney’s fees. The Court of Appeals modified the trial court’s
decision. Roberto was made liable only to the extent of the
monthly credit limit granted to Celia, i.e., at P2,000 a month
and only for advances made during the one-year period of the
card’s effectivity counted from Oct. 29, 1975 to Oct. 29, 1976.

HELD: The Supreme Court set aside the decision of the
Court of Appeals and reinstated that of the trial court and held
that the undertaking signed by Roberto Regala, Jr., although
denominated “Guarantor’s Undertaking” was in substance a
276

Art. 2054

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

t

severally with the debtor Celia Regala “to pay the Pacific
Banking Corporation upon demand, any and all indebtedness,
obligations, charges or liabilities due and incurred by said
Celia Syjuco Regala with the use of Pacificard or renewals
thereof issued in her favor by Pacific Banking Corporation.”
This undertaking was also provided as a condition in the
issuance of the Pacificard to Celia. Under Art. 2054 of the Civil
Code, “a guarantor may bind himself for less, but not for more
than the principal debtor, both as regards the amount and the
onerous nature of the conditions.” The credit limit granted
to Celia Regala was P2,000 per month and that Celia Regala
succeeded in using the card beyond the original period of its
effectivity, Oct. 29, 1979. However, Roberto’s liability should
not be limited to that even. As surety of his wife, he expressly
bound himself up to the extent of the debtor’s indebtedness,
likewise expressly waiving any discharge in case of any change
or novation in the terms and conditions in connection with the
issuance of the Pacificard credit card. Roberto in fact made
his commitment as a surety a continuing one, binding upon

himself until all the liabilities of Celia have been fully paid.
(2) Problems

(a)

A borrowed from B Pl million. Can C act as surety and
guarantee the payment and limit his liability to merely

P300.000?
ANS.: Yes, the guarantor or the surety can bind
himself for less than the principal debtor.
(b) In case (a), suppose A can pay only P900,000, can B get
anything from C?
ANS.: Yes, B can still get P100.000 from C. Out of
the Pl million debt, P700.000 was unsecured; P300.000
was secured (by the suretyship). It follows that, applying
the rule of application of payments, the payment of the
P900.000 should first be applied to the unsecured debt of
P700,000, and the remaining P200.000 should be applied
to the secured debt. This is so because the unsecured
debt is clearly more onerous than the secured one. It
follows that since only P200.000 of the secured debt has
277

Art. 2064

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

been paid, the creditor can still claim from the surety the
amount of Pl 00,000.
{NOTE: This does not contradict the statement that
the guarantor of the surety may bind himself for less than
the principal debt. After all, in the problem presented
the surety bound himself to pay up to P300,000. Had the
principal debtor been completely insolvent, the creditor
could only ask for P300,000 from the surety.
The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that:
“Where in a bond the debtor and surety have bound
themselves solidarity, but limiting the liability of
the surety to a lesser amount than that due from the
principal debtor, any such payment as the latter may
have on account of such obligation must be applied first
to the unsecured portion of the debt, for, as regards the
principal debtor, the obligation is more onerous as to the
amount not secured.” [Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation v. Aldanese, 48 Phil. 990])
(3) Rule if a Person Has Two Debts

When a person has two debts, one as a sole debtor, and
another as solidary co-debtor, his more onerous obligation to
which first payment is to be applied, is the debt as sole debtor.
(8 Manresa 290)

Commonwealth of the Phil. v. Far Eastern
Surety and Insurance Co.
83 Phil. 305
FACTS: The Far Eastern Surety & Insurance Co., Inc.
bound itself to pay jointly and severally with the principal
debtor the sum of P10,000 although the debt was realty
P11.230. The principal debtor was able to pay P10,000 only.
When sued, the Far Eastern Surety claimed that inasmuch as
the P10,000 had been fully satisfied, the surety cannot now
be held liable for the balance. It alleged that as surety it had
agreed to guarantee the payment of merely Pl 0,000.
ISSUE: Is said surety liable for the balance?
HELD: Yes, since in a case like this, we have to apply
the rule on the application of payments. The P10,000 already
278

Art. 2055

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

given should first be applied to the unsecured portion and the
balance to the secured debt.
(4) Rule if Debt is Increased

If the indebtedness is increased without the guarantor’s
consent, he is completely released from the obligation as
guarantor or surety. (Nat. Bank v. Veraguth, 50 Phil. 253)
(5) Liability of Guarantor for Interest

If a guarantor upon demand fails to pay, he can be held
liable for interest, even if in thus paying, the liability becomes
more than that in the principal obligation. The increased
liability is not because of the contract but because of the default
and the necessity of judicial collection. It should be noted,
however, that the interest runs from the time the complaint is
filed, not from the time the debt becomes due and demandable.
(Tagana v. Aldanese, 43 Phil. 582 and Plaridel Surety & Insur.
Co. v. P.I. Galang Machinery Co., 53 O.G. 1449)
(6) Effect of a Penalty Clause

If a surety bond has a penalty clause (in case of a violation
of a condition), said penalty may be demanded in the proper
case even if its value is MORE than the amount of the principal
debt. ( General Insurance & Surety Corp. v. Republic, L-13873,
Jan. 31, 1963)
Art. 2055. A guaranty is not presumed; it must be express
and cannot extend to more than what is stipulated therein.
If it be simple or indefinite, it shall comprise not only the
principal obligation, but also all its accessories, including
the judicial costs, provided with respect to the latter, that
the guarantor shall only be liable for those costs incurred
after he has been judicially required to pay.

COMMENT:
(1) Form of the Contract
To be enforceable, the contract of guaranty (between the
guarantor and the creditor) must be in writing, since this is “a
special promise to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage
279

Art 2066

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

of another.” (Art. 1403, Civil Code) Hence, an oral guaranty
is unenforceable. (Nolasco Brothers, Inc. v. Villarino, CA-GR
17616R, Aug. 8, 1958)
(.NOTE: Even if oral, however, the defense may be
WAIVED by the guarantor, since it is well known that the
defense of the Statute of Frauds is waivable.)

Be it noted therefore that the guaranty must be EXPRESS
(it is not presumed).

PNB v. Court of Appeals, Luzon Surety Co^ et al.
GR 33174, July 4, 1991

FACTS: On Aug. 6, 1955, Estanislao Depusoy, doing
business under the name of E.E. Depusoy Construction and the
Director of Public Works, entered into a building contract for
the construction of the GSIS building, Depusoy to furnish all
materials, labor, plans and supplies needed in the construction.
Depusoy applied for credit accommodation with the PNB. This
was approved subject to the conditions that he would assign all
payments to be received from the Bureau of Public Works of
the GSIS to the Bank, furnish a surety bond, and the surety to
deposit PIO,000 to the PNB. The total accommodations granted
to Depusoy was P100,000. This was later extended by another
PIO,000 and P25.000, but in no case should the loan exceed
Pl 00,000. In compliance with the conditions, Depusoy executed
a Deed of Assignment of all money to be received by him
from the GSIS. Luzon thereafter executed two surety bonds,
one for P40.000 and the other for P60,000. Under the credit
accommodation, Depusoy received on Jan. 14, 1957, P50.000
from the bank which he promised to pay in installments on the
dates therein indicated. On Jan. 17, 1957, he received another
P50.000 under the same conditions. Under the arrangement,
all payments made by GSIS were payable to the PNB. The
checks, however, were not sent directly to the PNB. Depusoy
received them. In turn, he delivered the checks to the bank.
PNB then applied the money thus received, first, to the checks,
and the balance to the current account of Depusoy with the
bank. A total of Pl,309,461 was paid by the GSIS to the bank
for the account of Depusoy. Of this amount P246.408 was paid
for the importation of construction materials and Pl,063,408
was received by the Loans and Discounts Department of
280

Art. 2066

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

the Bank. Depusoy defaulted in his building contract with
the Public Works Bureau. In 1957, the Bureau rescinded its
contract with Depusoy. No further amounts were thereafter
paid by the GSIS to the bank. Depuso/s loan remained unpaid,
including interest, amounting to P100.000. The PNB then sued
Depusoy and Luzon. The trial court dismissed the case against
Luzon, saying that the surety bonds it issued guaranteed
only the faithful performance of the deed of assignments, and
nothing else. That the bonds were extended by letters did not
change their conditions. The Court of Appeals affirmed the
trial court’s decision with the modification that Depusoy shall
pay 10% interest on the amount of the judgment.
HELD: The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of
Appeals’ decision and explained that the 10% interest should
be considered as and for attorney’s fees. The Court held that
the bonds executed by Luzon were to guarantee the faithful
performance of Depusoy of his obligation under the Deed of
Assignment and not to guarantee the payment of the loans
or the debt of Depusoy to the bank to the extent of P100.000.
The language of the bonds is clear. It leaves no room for
interpretation. Even if there had been any doubt on the terms
and conditions of the surety agreement, the doubt should
be resolved in favor of the surety. As concretely put in Art.
2055 of the Civil Code, a guaranty is not presumed, it must be
expressed and cannot extend to more than what is stipulated
therein.

National Marketing Corporation v. Gabino
Marquez, et al.
L-25553, Jan. 31, 1969
FACTS: Gabino Marquez owed the Namarco a
certain amount of money for the purchase of a tractor and
a rice thresher. The Plaridel Surety and Insurance Co.
281

Art. 2055

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

signed the contract as surety, binding itself solidarity with
Marquez and waiving any prior demand on the debtor.
When Marquez failed to pay, Namarco sued the surety
more than 10 years after the maturity date, although from
time to time written extrajudicial demands for payments
had been made. The surety was asked to pay not only the
original amount but also the interests thereon. Previous
to the suit against the surety, the surety had not been
informed of the demand against Marquez. The surety
thus alleges three defenses, namely:
(a)

that the action has prescribed,

(b)

that it had not been informed of the demand against
Marquez, and

(c)

that assuming it was liable for the principal debt,
there should not be any liability for the interest.

HELD:
(a)

EXAMPLES:
(a) If the surety makes himself liable only if the creditor
informs him of the debtor’s default within a certain
period, and notification is not done, the surety is not
liable. (Santos v. Mejia, 94 Phil. 211)
(b) If a surety guarantees that the debtor will “render an
accounting,” and the debtor realty does so, but does not

deliver the money supposed to be given to the creditor, the
surety is not liable for he did not guarantee the delivery of
the money. (Uy Aloo v. Cho Jan Ling, 27 Phil. 247)

'

The action has not prescribed because under Art.
1115 of the Civil Code, one way of interrupting the
prescription of actions is by a written extrajudicial
demand by the creditor.

(b)

The surety had waived in the contract any
notification of demand on the debtor, and even if it
had not so waived, still it had bound itself solidarity .

(c)

The surety is liable not only for the principal debt
but also for the interest because under Art. 2055,
par. 2 of the Civil Code
if the guaranty be simple
or indefinite, it shall comprise not only the principal
obligation but also all its accessories, including
judicial costs, provided with respect to the latter,
that the guarantor shall only be liable for those
costs incurred after he had been judicially required
to pay.

—

(3) Strictly Construed

A guaranty is strictly construed against the creditor and
in favor of the guarantor or surety.
282

Art. 2056

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(c)

If a surety guarantees a “delivery of a firearm upon
demand,” he does not necessarily guarantee that the
firearm will be produced for inspection. (Gov't, v. Herrero,
38 Phil. 410)

(d)

A surety is liable only for the obligations of the debtor
stipulated upon, not for prior obligations, unless this
retroactive effect had been clearly agreed upon. (Bank of
the Phil. Islands v. Forester, 49 Phil. 843)

(e)

If a surety binds itself only for a limited period, it can not
be held liable generally beyond said time limit. (Santos v.
Media, 94 Phil. 211)
A guarantor is not liable for past defaults of the debtor.
Reason: a guaranty has only a prospective, not retroactive
effect, unless the contract clearly indicates a contrary
intent. (Bueno contra Ambrosio, 87 Phil. 225) Thus, also,
a guaranty generally secures only the debts contracted
AFTER the guaranty takes effect. (El Vencedor v. Canlas,
44 Phil. 699) This is a consequence of the statutory
directive that a guaranty is not presumed, but must
be express and cannot extend to more than what is
stipulated. (See Traders Insurance & Surety Co., Inc. v.
Dy Eng Giok, L-9073, Nov. 17, 1958)

(3) Liability of Heirs if the Guarantor Dies

If a guarantor dies, his heirs are still liable, to the
extent of the value of the inheritance because the obligation
is not purely personal, and is therefore transmissible. It is
not personal because all the guarantor is interested in is the
recovery of the money, regardless of its giver. (Estate ofHemady
v. Luzon Surety & Ins. Co., 53 O.G. 2786)
(NOTE: An action against a guarantor who dies during
pendency of the same, being one for the recovery of money
or debt, should be dismissed, but may be instituted in the
proceeding for the settlement of his estate. [Villegas v. Zapanta
and Zorilla, L-11056, Dec. 26, 1958] Even if the action had not

EFFECTS OF GUARANTY
Section 1

EFFECTS OF GUARANTY BETWEEN THE
GUARANTOR AND THE CREDITOR

he has not pledged nor mortgaged his own property to
the creditor for the satisfaction of the principal obligation
for clearly, a mortgagor is not entitled to the benefit of
exhaustion (Southern Motors, Inc. v. Barbosa, 99 Phil.
263);
(c) he does not fall in the cases enumerated in Art. 2059
(See Jaucian v. Querol, 38 Phil. 707);
(d) he complies with Art. 2060. (See Garcia v. Lianco, C.A.,
50 O.G. 1145)

(b)

(2) Bar Question

INTRODUCTORY COMMENT:
In general, the effects between the guarantor and the creditor
are the following:
The guarantor is entitled to the benefit of excussion
(benefit of exhaustion) of the debtor’s properties except
in the cases mentioned under Art. 2059, and provided
that the guarantor follows Art. 2060.
(2) A compromise between the creditor and the principal
debtor benefits but does not prejudice the guarantor.
(Art. 2063, Civil Code)
(3) If there should be several guarantors, they are in general
entitled to the benefit of division (pro-rata liability). (See
Art. 2065, Civil Code)
(1)

Art. 2058. The guarantor cannot be compelled to pay
the creditor unless the latter has exhausted all the property
of the debtor, and has resorted to all the legal remedies
against the debtor.

What do you understand by excussion!
ANS.: By excussion is meant the right of the guarantor
to have all the properties of the debtor and all legal remedies
against him first exhausted before he can be compelled to pay
the creditor. (See Art. 2058)
(NOTE: A mortgagor is NOT entitled to the benefit of
excussion of the property of the principal debtor. [Saavedra
v. Price, 68 Phil. 699 and Southern Motors, Inc. v. Barbosa,
99 Phil. 263])
(3) Duty of Creditor

If a creditor wants to hold the guarantor liable, he (the
creditor) must do the following:

2059;
(b)

COMMENT:
(1) Benefit of Excussion
Generally, a guarantor has the right to demand
exhaustion of the debtor’s assets (BENEFIT OF EXCUSSION
OR EXHAUSTION OR SIMPLY EXCUSSION) provided:
(a) he sets it up as defense before judgment is rendered
against himself (guarantor) (See Saavedra v. Price, 68
Phil. 699);
286

exhaust all the property of the debtor (Art. 2058) unless
the guarantor is not entitled to such benefit under Art.

(c)

resort to all the legal remedies against the debtor (Art.
2058) (This includes SUIT against the debtor.) (See Wise
and Co., Inc. v. Tanglao, 63 Phil. 372);
prove that the debtor is still unable to pay (See Wise
and Co., Inc. v. Tanglao, 63 Phil. 372);
(NOTE: Just because the debtor has been declared
insolvent in insolvency proceeding this does not mean
that the debtor cannot pay, for part of the debtor’s assets
may still be available to the creditor. One good way of
proving inability to pay is to prove an UNSATISFIED

notify the guarantor of the debtor’s inability to pay,
otherwise if the guarantor is prejudiced by lack of notice,
he cannot be made to pay, unless of course there is a
WAIVER on the part of the guarantor. (Roces Hermanos,
Inc. v. China Insurance and Surety Co., Inc., Aug. 9,
1941 issue of the Official Gazette, p. 1257)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(2) Additional Instances When Guarantor is NOT Entitled

to the Benefit of Excussion

(a)

if the guaranty is in a judicial bond (Art. 2084)

(b)

if Art. 2060 is not complied with

(c)

if the principal debt is a natural, voidable, or unenforceable
obligation. (See Art. 2062, where there can still be
guaranty but generally the principal debtor would not
be liable.)

•

(4) Query

Suppose the guarantor has already been sued, will a
writ of execution be rendered against him?
ANS.: Not necessarily, for it is essential to sue first
and exhaust his assets. (Southern Motors, Inc. v.
debtor
the
Barbosa, 99 Phil. 263)

Art. 2059. This excussion shall not take place:
(1) If the guarantor has expressly renounced it;
(2) If he has bound himself solidarity with the debtor;
(3) In case of insolvency of the debtor;
(4) When he has absconded, or cannot be sued
within the Philippines unless he has left a manager or
representative;
(5) If it may be presumed that an execution on the
property of the principal debtor would not result in the
satisfaction of the obligation.

If there are still assets in the Philippines belonging to
the absconding debtor, said assets may be attached. (Rule
57, Revised Rules of Court)

Art. 2060. In order that the guarantor may make use
of the benefit of excussion, he must set it up against the
creditor upon the latter’s demand for payment from him,
and point out to the creditor available property of the
debtor within Philippine territory, sufficient to cover the
amount of the debt.

COMMENT:
Requisites Before Guarantor Can Make Use of Excussion

Guarantor must set it up when the creditor demands
payment.
(NOTE: The demand can be made only AFTER a
judgment has been rendered against the principal debtor.

as the debtor this does not mean that the creditor has
already made the demand on the guarantor. [Vda. de
Syquia v. Jacinto, 60 Phil. 861])

Art. 2061. The guarantor having fulfilled all the
conditions required in the preceding article, the creditor
who is negligent in exhausting the property pointed out
shall suffer the loss, to the extent of said property, for the
insolvency of the debtor resulting from such negligence.
COMMENT:
Effect of Creditor’s Negligence
The Article says that the negligent creditor suffers the
loss to the extent of the value of the property pointed out by
the guarantor but not exhausted by the creditor.

Art. 2062. In every action by the creditor, which must
be against the principal debtor alone, except in the cases
mentioned in Article 2059, the former shall ask the court to
notify the guarantor of the action. The guarantor may appear
so that he may, if he so desire, set up such defenses as are
granted him by law. The benefit of excussion mentioned in
Article 2058 shall always be unimpaired, even if judgment
should be rendered against the principal debtor and the
guarantor in case of appearance by the latter.

COMMENT:
(1) Generally Suit Must Be Against Principal Debtor Alone
As expressly worded in the Article, the creditor must
generally sue ONLY the principal debtor (except, of course,
when the guarantor is not entitled to the benefit of excussion).
The Article applies, however, only to cases accruing after the
effectivity of the new Civil Code. Under the old law, suit could
be filed against BOTH, but even then, the judgment must
specify that the guarantor’s liability was only SUBSIDIARY
generally. (De Leon v. Ching Leng, L-7122, Jan. 29, 1959)
It is clear therefore that no writ of execution could issue
against the guarantor’s properties, unless the principal debtor
was unable to pay. (Ibid.; see Arroyo v. Jungsay, 34 Phil. 589)
(2) Suit by the Creditor to Recover the Debt

While the guarantor MUST be notified, he does NOT
have to appear for the law uses the phrase “may appear.”

for the same is divided among all. The creditor cannot
claim from the guarantors except the shares which they
are respectively bound to pay, unless solidarity has been
expressly stipulated.
291

Art. 2066

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

The benefit of division against the co-guarantors ceases
in the same cases and for the same reasons as the benefit
of excussion against the principal debtor.
/

This Article speaks of the BENEFIT OF DIVISION.

each will be held responsible for only P200.000 provided
the benefit of division exists.

The same instances when the benefit of excussion ceases.

Section 2
EFFECTS OF GUARANTY BETWEEN THE
DEBTOR AND THE GUARANTOR
Art. 2066. The guarantor who pays for a debtor must
be indemnified by the latter.
The indemnity comprises:
(1) The total amount of the debt;
(2) The legal interests thereon from the time the
payment was made known to the debtor, even though it
did not earn interest for the creditor;
(3) The expenses incurred by the guarantor after
having notified the debtor that payment had been demanded
of him;
(4) Damages, if they are due.

COMMENT:

Since a guaranty is a strict indemnity, he can recover
only what was paid plus losses and damages, including costs
and interest. (Tagawa v. Aldanese and Union Guarantee Co.,

"

Art. 2067. The guarantor who pays is subrogated by
virtue thereof to all the rights which the creditor had
against the debtor.

results by operation of law from the act of payment and
there is no necessity for the guarantor to ask the creditor

Art. 2070

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

The effect is indicated in this Article.

Urrutia and Co. v. Moreno and Reyes
28 Phil. 260
FACTS: The creditor sued both the principal debtor
and the surety. The property of the principal debtor was
sold under execution, and the surety paid the judgment
shortly afterwards. The surety now wanted to redeem
the properties of the debtor which had been sold. The
surety alleged the right of subrogation.
HELD: The surety did not have the right to redeem.
While he was subrogated to the rights of the creditor,
he was not subrogated to the rights of the debtor.

Ad. 2068. If the guarantor should pay without notifying
the debtor, the latter may enforce against him all the
defenses which he could have set up against the creditor
at the time the payment was made.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect if Guarantor Pays Without Notifying Debtor
The effect is set forth in the Article.

(2) Reason for the Article

There was no need for the advance payment. (Manresa)
(3) Ratification By the Debtor

Ratification by the debtor may be express or implied.
Art. 2070. If the guarantor has paid without notifying the
debtor, and the latter not being aware of the payment, repeats
the payment, the former has no remedy whatever against

the debtor, but only against the creditor. Nevertheless,
in case of a gratuitous guaranty, if the guarantor was
prevented by a fortuitous event from advising the debtor
of the payment, and the creditor becomes insolvent, the
debtor shall reimburse the guarantor for the amount paid.

COMMENT:
(1) Payment By Both the Guarantor and the Debtor

Examples:
(a)

(2) Reason for the Article

The liability of the guarantor being merely subsidiary, he
should really wait till after the debtor has tried to comply. The
guarantor should not, through his own fault or negligence, be
allowed to jeopardize the rights of the debtor. By paying the
debt without first notifying the debtor, the guarantor deprives
the debtor of the opportunity to set up defenses against the
creditor. (Manresa)

Art. 2069. If the debt was for a period and the
guarantor paid it before it became due, he cannot demand

reimbursement of the debtor until the expiration of the
period unless the payment has been ratified by the debtor.
294

A owes B P100.000 with C as guarantor. C paid the
P100,006 to B when the debt fell due, but C did this
without first notifying A. Not being aware of the payment
by C, A repeated the payment. Can C recover from A?

ANS.: No. C cannot recover from A. C has no remedy
whatever against A, the debtor. Cs only remedy is to
recover from B, the creditor. (1st sentence, Art. 2070)
(b)

Suppose in example (a), the guaranty was gratuitous,
and suppose the only reason C was not able to notify A
was because of a fortuitous event, what are Cs rights?

ANS.: C must still recover from B. But if B, the
creditor, is insolvent, then A, the debtor, shall reimburse
C, the guarantor, for the amount paid. This is therefore a
different case from that presented in example (a), because
295

Art. 2071

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

in said example, even if B, the creditor, is insolvent A
does not have to reimburse C, the guarantor, because
under the facts of the case, C is clearly at fault for
having no justifiable reason for not advising the debtor
of the payment.
•

(2) Gratuitous Guaranty

*

>'

i

Note that the second sentence of Art. 2070 is applicable
only in case of a gratuitous guaranty. It is clear that it should
not be applied if the guaranty is onerous or for a compensation.
The law favors a gratuitous guarantor because he receives
nothing extra for his efforts and obligations, and it would be
rather unfair if under the premises given, he cannot recover
from the principal debtor, who should not indeed unjustly
enrich himself at the expense of another.
•• u
(3) Comment of Manresa

The object of Art. 2070 is to prevent the guarantor from
impairing the rights of the principal debtor. The latter should,
therefore, not be denied the right to pay his creditor, if he
has not been previously notified of the payment made by the
guarantor, and consequently, payment by the debtor under
such circumstances should produce the same effect as if no
payment had been made by the guarantor. As to the liability
of the creditor to return to the guarantor what that latter
has paid, no sound principle of law can be invoked against
it. No one should be allowed to enrich himself unduly to the
prejudice of another. (Manresa, vol. 12)

(2)

Art. 2071. The guarantor, even before having paid, may
proceed against the principal debtor:
(1)

When he is sued for the payment;
296

In case of insolvency of the principal debtor;

When the debtor has bound himself to relieve him
guaranty
the
within a specified period, and this period
from
has expired;
(4) When the debt has become demandable, by reason
of the expiration of the period for payment;
(3)

(5) After the lapse of ten years, when the principal
obligation has no fixed period for its maturity, unless it be
of such nature that it cannot be extinguished except within
a period longer than ten years;

(6) If there are reasonable grounds to fear that the
principal debtor intends to abscond;
(7) If the principal debtor is in imminent danger of
becoming insolvent.
In all these cases, the action of the guarantor is to
obtain release from the guaranty, or to demand a security
that shall protect him from any proceedings by the creditor
and from the danger of insolvency of the debtor.

COMMENT:
(1) Rights of Guarantor Before Payment

(4) Applicable Only When Debtor Had Not Previously

Authorized the Guarantor to Pay
It is believed that the preceding comments (Nos. 1 to 3)
on the Article apply only when the debtor had not previously
authorized the guarantor to pay. For in such a case, the
debtor must now inquire from the guarantor whether or not
the latter has already paid.

Art. 2071

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

,

It should be noted that Art. 2071 differs from Art. 2066.
Art. 2071 refers to the rights of the guarantor before payment,
whereas Art. 2066 refers to his rights after payment. Article
2071 does not give the guarantor the right to obtain a money
judgment in his favor, for the simple reason that he has not
yet paid, whereas in Art. 2066, a money judgment would be
proper since in this case, there has already been a payment.
Art. 2071 is of the nature of a preliminary remedy, whereas
Art. 2066 is a substantive right. Art. 2066 gives a right of
action, which without the provisions of the other might be
worthless. (Kuenzle & Streiff v. Tan Sunco, 16 Phil. 670 and
Perez v. Baria, 52 Phil. 197) In Art. 2071, the guarantor has
either of two rights:
(a)

to obtain release from the guaranty;

(b)

to demand security.
297

Art. 2071

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(2) Problems
(a)

of the debt, which debt being one he could be called upon to
pay at any time, it remains only to say, in this connection,
that the only procedure known under our present practice to
enforce that right is by action. (Kuenzle and Streiff v. Tan
Sunco, supra) Of course, this action may be in the form of a
cross-claim against his co-defendant, the debtor. (Pan Asiatic
Commercial Co., Inc. v. World Wide Insurance & Surety Co.,
Inc., CA-GR 12083-R, June 30, 1956)

A borrowed P900.000 from B. C is the guarantor. The
debt has already fallen due, for the term has already
expired. Is C allowed to bring an action against A even
before C had paid B?
ANS.: Yes. (Art. 2071, par. 4) The purpose is to obtain
release from the guaranty, or to demand a security that

shall protect him from any proceedings by the creditor
and from the danger of insolvency of the debtor. (Art.
2071, 1st par.) The purpose is certainly not to recover
money, since the guarantor has not yet paid. (Kuenzle
and Streiff v. Tan Sunco, 16 Phil. 670) If a trial judge
should render a money judgment for the guarantor in
a case like this, it is clear that such a judgment would
be erroneous.

(4) Problem

The creditor failed to make a demand upon the principal
debtor although the debt was already due. The guarantor,
afraid that the principal debtor might sooner or later become
insolvent, brought an action against the creditor to compel
said creditor to make the demand upon the principal debtor.
Will the action prosper?

There would be no reason for it. And, furthermore,
such a money judgment is not among the remedies
enumerated in this provision of the law. (Perez v. Barcia,
62 Phil. 197)

.
(b)

ANS.: No, the action will not prosper because the remedy
of the fearful guarantor should be against the principal debtor
in accordance with Art. 2071. (Banco Espartol v. Donaldson
Sim & Co., 6 Phil. 418)

In problem (a), suppose the guarantor wins in this action,
and suppose, for example, he obtains a security from the
principal debtor, would this be proper?

ANS.: Yes, this would be proper for such a remedy
is one of those enumerated. And, therefore, a judgment on
this point is proper, BUT he ought not to be allowed to
realize on said judgment to the point of actual collection of
the same until he (the guarantor) has satisfied or caused
to be satisfied the obligation the payment of which he
assumed. Otherwise, a great opportunity for collusion
and improper practices between the guarantor and the
principal debtor would be offered which might result in
injury and prejudice to the creditor who holds the claim
against them. (Kuenzle and Streiff v. Tan Sunco, supra)

L-43862, January 13, 1989

(3) How Guarantor or Surety Can Enforce the Rights Under

The principal debtors, defendants-appellants herein, are
simultaneously the same persons who executed the Indemnity
Agreement. The position occupied by them is that of a
principal debtor and indemnitor at the same time, and their
liability being joint and several with the plaintiff-appellee’s,
the Philippine National Bank may proceed against either for
fulfillment of the obligation as covered by the surety bonds.
There is, therefore, no principle of guaranty involved and,
therefore, the provisions of Art. 2071 do not apply. Otherwise
stated, there is more need for the plaintiff-appellee to exhaust
all the properties of the principal debtor before it may proceed
against defendants-appellants.

It being evident that the purpose of this article is to give
the guarantor or surety a remedy in anticipation of the payment

The trial court did not err in ordering defendantsappellants to pay jointly and severally the plaintiff the sum
of P100,000 plus 15% as attorney’s fees.

(5) The Nature of the Remedies

The remedies provided for under Art. 2071 are alternative
remedies in favor of the guarantor at his election and the
guarantor who brings an action under this Article must choose
the remedy and apply for it specifically. (Tuason v. Machuca,
46 PhU. 561)
(6) Applicability of the Article to Sureties

Article 2071, despite its use of the term “guarantor"
can apply also to a “surety.” (Atok Finance Corp. v. CA, 41
SCAD 450 [1993]) The reference in Art. 2047 to the provisions
of Sec. 4, Ch. 3, Title I, Book IV of the new Civil Code, on
solidary obligations, does not mean that suretyship, which
is a solidary obligation, is withdrawn from the applicable
provisions governing guaranty. (Manila Surety and Fidelity

Arts. 2072-2073

the latter was to file a bond in favor of the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue to secure payment of the tax by Reyes.
The Company then filed the bond. In consideration of the
bond, Reyes signed an indemnity agreement whereby he
bound himself to indemnify the Company, upon its demand,
even BEFORE the surety shall have paid the Government.
Because of Reyes’ failure to pay the tax, the Company became
liable on its bond. Prior to payment to the Government, the
Company sought indemnity from Reyes. Reyes countered that
the provision in the contract requiring him to pay even before
the Company has paid the tax is void because it is contrary
to law and public policy.
HELD: The agreement is valid and does not in any way
militate against the public good; neither is it contrary to the
policy of the law. Therefore, in accordance with the indemnity
agreement, the surety may demand from Reyes, even before
paying to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. (See also
Security Bank v. Globe Assurance, 58 O.G. 3708, April 30,
1962)

If an indemnity bond executed by a debtor in favor of
the surety provides that “said indemnity shall be paid to the
company as soon as it becomes liable for the payment of any
amount under the bond, whether or not it shall have paid such
sum or sums of money, or any part thereof,” it cannot be said
that the surety’s action against the debtor is premature just
because the debtor has not yet been made actually liable in
view of a pending case. The fact that the creditor has actually
filed an action in court demanding payment from the surety
under the bond it has posted is more than enough to entitle
the surety to enforce the indemnity agreement executed by the
debtor. (Manila Surety and Fidelity Co., Inc. v. Cruz, L-10414,
April 18, 1958 and Alto Surety and Ins. Co. v. Aguilar, L-5626,
March 16, 1954)

Art. 2072. If one, at the request of another, becomes a
guarantor for the debt of a third person who is not present,
the guarantor who satisfies the debt may sue either the
person so requesting or the debtor for reimbursement.

the same debtor and for the same debt, the one among them

Art. 2073

who has paid may demand of each of the others the share
which is proportionally owing from him.
If any of the guarantors should be insolvent, his share
shall be borne by the others, including the payer, in the
same proportion.
The provisions of this article shall not be applicable,
unless the payment has been made in virtue of a judicial
demand or unless the principal debtor is insolvent.

COMMENT:
(1) Right of Guarantor Who Pays

This Article is applicable only when there has been
payment. If there has been no payment by way of the
guarantors, this Article cannot be applied. Furthermore, this
payment must have been made:
(a)

in virtue of a judicial demand;

(b)

or because the principal debtor is insolvent.

(2) Example of Par. 1

A, B, and C are B’s guarantors. D was insolvent, and A had
to pay the whole debt. Later, A can demand from B and C
1/3 of the debt from each. This is so because A’s share is
supposed to be also 1/3. Of course, each of them can later
demand proportional reimbursement from the principal debtor.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2074

(4) Distinguished from Benefit of Division

This Article should not be confused with the article giving
as a rule to several guarantors the benefit of division (Art.
2065) for in said article, there has been no payment as yet.
Moreover, in Art. 2073, the payment must have been made
because of judicial proceedings or because the principal debtor
was insolvent. (Cacho v. Valles, 45 Phil. 107)
Art. 2074. In the case of the preceding article, the co¬
guarantors may set up against the one who paid, the same
defenses which would have pertained to the principal debtor
against the creditor, and which are not purely personal to
the debtor.

COMMENT:
Right of Co-guarantors Against the Guarantors Who

Paid

The Article gives the co-guarantors the SAME defenses
which would have pertained to the principal debtor.
EXCEPTION: defenses purely personal to the debtor (like
fraud or force).

Art. 2075. A sub-guarantor, in case of the insolvency of
the guarantor for whom he bound himself, is responsible
to the co-guarantors in the same terms as the guarantor.

COMMENT:

(3) Example of Par. 2

A, B, and C are O’s guarantors of a debt of P300,000
in favor of E. Since D was insolvent, A paid P300,000 to E.
Under par. 1, he can therefore demand P100,000 each from
B and C. But B is insolvent. How much can A demand from

C?

Liability of Sub-guarantors to Co-guarantors

The Article is self-explanatory.
Note that the Article applies if the guarantor is INSOL¬
VENT.

ANS.: P150.000. A cannot demand the extra P100,000

(share of B) from C because in that way, C would have a
greater burden. The law provides that the insolvent guarantor’s
share (B) must be borne by the others (including the payer
A) proportionally.

Chapter 3

EXTINGUISHMENT OF GUARANTY

If a surety contract expires, the principal is no
longer bound to pay the premiums. This is true even
if there is a pending lawsuit involving a liability that
arose while the surety agreement was still subsisting.

Art. 2076. The obligation of the guarantor is extinguished
at the same time as that of the debtor, and for the same
causes as all other obligations.

Art. 2077. If the creditor voluntarily accepts immovable
or other property in payment of the debt, even if he should
afterwards lose the same through eviction, the guarantor
is released.

COMMENT:

COMMENT:

(1) Two Causes for Extinguishment of the Guaranty
(a)

direct (when the guaranty itself is extinguished,
independently of the principal obligation)

(b)

indirect (when the principal obligation ends, the accessory
obligation of guaranty naturally ends). (Manresa) (See
Shannon v. Phil. Lumber & Trans. Co., 61 Phil. 876)

(2) Effect of Novation
(a)

If a contract is novated without the guarantor’s consent,
the guaranty ends. (Barretto u. Albo, 62 Phil. 593; Natl.
Bank v. Veraguth, 50 Phil. 253)

(b)

Therefore, a novation where the debtor is substituted
or where the credit is increased, releases the guarantor
who did not consent thereto. (Barretto v. Albo, 62 Phil.
593; Nat. Bank v. Veraguth, 50 Phil. 253)
(NOTE: Consent, however, on the part of the
guarantor may be given expressly or implicitly before
or after the novation. [NAR1C v. Guillioso, et al., {CAJ
53 O.G. 4151])
(NOTE: If the interest rates are increased without
the guarantor’s consent, he is not liable for the increase,

but is liable still for the principal obligation and the
original rate of interest. [Bank of the P.I. v. Albaladgjo
y Cia, 53 Phil. 141])
304

Effect of Dacion En Pago
(a) Note that the dacion en pago here refers to both
IMMOVABLE or OTHER (personal) PROPERTY.
(b) Eviction revives the principal obligation, but NOT the
guaranty, for the creditor here took the risk.

Art. 2078. A release made by the creditor in favor of
one of the guarantors, without the consent of the others,
benefits all to the extent of the share of the guarantor to
whom it has been granted.

COMMENT:
Release by Creditor in Favor of One of the Guarantors
Example: A, B, C, and D are co-guarantors for Pl,000,000.
A is released with the consent of B, C, and D. B, C, and D
will each be responsible for P333.330, or 1/3 of Pl,000,000.
If A is released without the consent of B, C, and D, then B,
C, and D will each be responsible for only P250.000. This is
the clear intention of the law. There is an opinion which says
that the remaining P750.000 should be divided among the 4
of them, making B, C, and D liable for only P187.500 each.
This clearly is wrong because what was released was only
P250,000. Even if B, C, and D will each give, the total under
this second opinion would be only P562,500. This cannot have
been the intention of the law. (See Comments of Manresa)
305

Art. 2079

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2079. An extension granted to the debtor by the
creditor without the consent of the guarantor extinguishes
the guaranty. The mere failure on the part of the creditor
to demand payment after the debt has become due does not
of itself constitute any extension of time referred to herein.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(b)

(1) Effect of Extension Granted By the Creditor
'

Example:
A owed B PIO million payable in 10 years. C was the
guarantor. B extended without the consent of C the period to
12 years. The obligation of C as guarantor is extinguished.

(2) Comment of Manresa

K

The object of the provision is to avoid prejudice to
the guarantor. If the payment is delayed on account of the
extension, the principal debtor may become insolvent and
the guarantor’s right to reimbursement would be rendered
useless. (Vol. 12)
Philippine General Ins. Co. v. Mutuc
L-19632, Nov. 13, 1974

,

'

FACTS: In a surety bond, the sureties bound themselves
to be liable in case of extension or renewal of the bond, without
the necessity of executing another indemnity agreement for
the purpose and without the necessity of their being notified
of such extension or renewal. Is the agreement valid?
HELD: Yes, the agreement is valid; there is nothing in
it that militates against the law, good customs, good morals,
public order, or public policy.

(3) Failure of Creditor to Demand Payment
(a)

The reason for the second sentence is that, after all, the

guarantor would not be prejudiced since his recourse
would be to avail himself of the right granted under Art.
2071. (Banco Espanol v. Donaldson Sim & Co., 5 Phil.

418)

306

Deferring the filing of the action does not imply a change
in the efficacy of the contract or liability of any kind on the
part of the debtor. It is merely
without demonstration
or proof to the contrary
respite, courtesy, leniency,
passivity, inaction. It does not constitute novation, because
this must be express. The receipt of interest stipulated
in the same contract after the obligation has become due
does not constitute novation, it being merely a compliance
with the obligation itself. It would however be different,
if the interest has been paid in advance, covering a
definite period, because in that case, his action would be
barred during said period by his own act, which would
have created a new term of the obligation, and a tacit
extension of time. (Banco Espanol v. Donaldson Sim &
Co., 5 Phil. 418)

General Insurance and Surety Corp. v. Republic
L-13873, Jan. 31, 1963

FACTS: On May 15, 1954, the Central Luzon
Educational Foundation, Inc. and the General Insurance
Surety Corp, posted in favor of the Department of
Education a bond required by said Department. The
Foundation was operating the Sison and Aruego College
of Urdaneta, Pangasinan. The bond in the amount of
P10,000 was posted “to guarantee the adequate and
efficient administration of said school or college, and
the observance of all regulations... and compliance with
all obligations including the payment of the salaries
of all its teachers and employees, past, present, and
future...” It appeared that on the date of the execution
of the bond, the Foundation was indebted to two of its
teachers for salaries, to wit: Remedios Laoag, for the sum
of P695.64 and H.B. Arandia, for the sum of P820, or
a total of Pl,515.64. On Feb. 4, 1955, Remedios Laoag
and the Foundation agreed that the latter would pay
the former’s salaries, which were then already due, on
March 1, 1955. When the demand for said amount was
refused, the Solicitor General in behalf of the Republic
of the Philippines, filed a complaint for the forfeiture
of the bond. The Surety, however, maintained that it
307

was already released from the obligations under the
bond, inasmuch as Remedios Laoag extended the time
to March 1, 1965. In support of this proposition, the
Surety cited Art. 2079. It also contended that it cannot
be made to answer for more than the unpaid salaries of
H.B. Arandia, which it claimed, amounted to only P820
because of Art. 2054, which provides that “a guarantor
may bind himself for less, but not for more than the
principal debtor both as regards the amount, and the
onerous nature of the conditions. Should he have bound
himself for more, his obligations shall be reduced to the
limits of that of the latter.”

surety company. The last extension expired in Nov. 1960
(the end of the first semester of the school year 19601961). Because the surety company did not know of this
extension and its date of expiration, it was not able to

effectuate the Chinese’s departure from the Philippines.
Sometime later (on June 13, 1961), deportation
proceedings were instituted against the Chinese; on the
same day, a warrant of arrest was issued against him,
and the surety bond was declared forfeited. Three days
later (June 16, 1961), the surety company surrendered
the Chinese. The company then sought the lifting of
the order of confiscation, alleging that the only reason
it could not comply with the bond was because of the
extensions granted by the Immigration Commissioner
extensions not made known to the company.

ISSUES: (a) Was the guaranty extinguished by
the extension granted by Remedios Laoag? (b) Was the
surety liable for the whole amount of the bond?
HELD: (a) Article 2079 is not applicable because
the supposed extension of time was granted, not by
the Department of Education or by the Government
but by the teachers. As already stated, the creditors of
the bond were not the teachers, but the Department of
Education or the government, (b) The Surety is liable for
the whole amount of the bond. The penal nature of the
bond suffices to dispose of this claim. The conditions for
the bond having been violated, the Surety must answer
for the penalty.

—

ISSUE: Should the bond be forfeited?
HELD: Yes, the bond should be forfeited because
of the following reasons:
(1) The surety company was not able to comply with the
duty to effectuate the departure of the Chinese on
or before the expiration date of the last extension.
While it is true that the extensions were made
by the Commissioner of Immigration, still these
were allowed by the terms of the bond (the said
Commissioner being allowed to grant a period for
such departure).

a certain Chinese student admitted temporarily to the
Philippines “would actually depart from the Philippines
on or about April 7, 1958, OR within such period as

installments are concerned. It is well settled that where
a guarantor is liable for different payments such as
installments of rent, or upon a series of promissory notes,
an extension of time as to one or more will not affect
the liability of the guarantor for the others. (Basque, 49

Concurring opinion of Justice A. Dizon ( with whom Justice
J£.L. Reyes concurs):

'

Article 2079 of the Civil Code, an extension granted
to the debtor by the creditor without the consent of the
guarantor extinguishes the guaranty. BUT, this provision
does not apply to the instant case because under the terms
of the bond, the surety had agreed that the Chinese would
depart from the Philippines on or before April 7, 1958 OR
within such period as, in his discretion, the Commissioner
of Immigration or his authorized representative may
properly allow.” This amounts to company’s consent to
all the extensions granted to the Chinese.

Art 2082. The bondsman who is to be offered in virtue
of a provision of law or of a judicial order shall have
the
qualifications prescribed in Article 2056 and in special
laws.

COMMENT:

;

(1) Qualification of a Bondsman

See Rule 114, Sec. 9, Revised Rules of Court.
*

(2) The Bond
(a)

A bond merely stands as a guaranty (solidary guaranty)
for a principal obligation, which exists independently of
said bond, the latter being merely an accessory obligation.
(Valencia v. RFC, et al., L-10749, April 25, 1958)
(b) A bond being for the benefit of the
creditor (in some
cases, the government), it follows that the creditor can
legally waive a bond requirement. This may be done
for example by extending the principal contract once or
twice, despite the expiration of the bond originally set
up. (Board of Liquidators v. Floro, et al., L-15155, Dec.
29, 1960)
(c)

If a bond is given to suspend the execution of a final
decree, the object is impossible, hence the bond is void.
The surety company would therefore incur no obligation
under such a bond. (Republic Savings Bank v. Far Eastern
Surety, L-14959, Aug. 31, 1960)
Singson v. Babida
L-30096, Sept. 27, 1977

Surety bonds should be signed not only by the
sureties but also by the principal obligors (the defendants
in a case, for example). If not signed by the latter, the
314

Arts. 2083-2084

surety bonds are void, there being no principal obligation
(which is of course the cause or consideration of such
surety bonds).
(3) Right to Be Heard

A bondsman or surety must be given an opportunity to be
heard; otherwise, the writ of execution issued is void. (Luzon
Surety Co. v. Guerrero, 17 SCRA 400 [1966] and Luzon Surety
Co. v. Beson, et al., L-26865-66, Jan. 30, 1970) Even when
execution is proper, the party against whom it is directed is
still entitled to a hearing if he wants to show subsequent
facts that would make the execution unjust (Luzon Surety
Co. v. Beson, et cd., L-26865-66, Jan. 30, 1970 and Abellana
v. Dosdos, 13 SCRA 244 [1965]) (See, however, Sy Bang v.
Mendez, Sr., 226 SCRA 770 [1993]), where the rules do not
require a hearing on the approval of the bond, provided that
the Judge is satisfied with the solvency of the surety.)
Art. 2083. If the person bound to give a bond in the
cases of the preceding article, should not be able to do so,
a pledge or mortgage considered sufficient to cover his
obligation shall be admitted in lieu thereof.

COMMENT:
Rule if the Bond is Not Given
Note that instead of the bond, a pledge or a mortgage
may be made.

Art. 2084. A judicial bondsman cannot demand the
exhaustion of the property of the principal debtor.
A sub-surety in the same case, cannot demand the
exhaustion of the property of the debtor or of the surety.

COMMENT:
(1) No Right to Excussion

A judicial bondsman, being a surety, is not entitled to
the benefit of excussion granted a guarantor. The benefit is
also denied a sub-surety.
315

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Ait. 2084

(2) Liability of Surety if Creditor was Negligent in

Collecting
A surety is still liable even if the creditor was negligent
in collecting from the debtor. As stated in American
Jurisprudence, “the contract of suretyship is not that the
obligee will see that the principal pays the debt or fulfills the
contract, but that the surety will see that the principal pays
or performs.” (50 Am. Jur. 904 and Judge Advocate General
v. Court of Appeals & Alto Surety Co., L-10671, Oct. 23, 1958)
(3) Effect of Violation by Creditor of Terms of the Surety

Agreement

A violation by the creditor of the terms of the surety
agreement entitles the surety to be released therefrom.
(Associated Ins. & Surety Co. v. Bacolod Murcia Milling Co.,
L12334, May 22, 1959) However, where an assurance company
has profited in the issuance of the bond by the receipt of the
premium paid, it cannot later go back and assail the validity
of the bond which it had furnished for a premium on the
mere allegation or ground that the release of a prisoner was
unauthorized under the provisions of law. (People v. Enriquez,
et al., L-13006, Feb. 29, 1960)
(4) Bond Filed for Aliens’ Stay

If a surety bond filed for an alien’s stay in the country is
forfeited because of violation of its conditions, its subsequent
unauthorized cancellation through mistakes or fraud does not
relieve the surety. A bond surrendered through mistake or
fraud may, therefore, be considered as a valid and subsisting
instrument. (Far Eastern Surety and Ins. Co. v. Court of
Appeals, L-12019, Oct. 16, 1958)
(5) Rule When Performance is Rendered Impossible

Even when a surety’s performance of the bond is rendered
impossible by an act of God, or of the obligee, or of the law,
it is the surety’s duty to inform the court of the happening of
the event so that it may take action or decree in the discharge
of the surety. Thus, if the surety took no such steps, it is
316

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2084

equally chargeable with negligence in this connection. (People
v. Otiak Omal & Luzon Surety Co., Inc., L-14457, June 30,
1961)

(6) Obligation of Surety to Keep the Accused Under His

Surveillance
It is well settled that the surety is the jailer of the accused,
and is responsible for the latter’s custody. Therefore, it is not
merely his right but his obligation to keep the accused at
all times under his surveillance. (People v. Tuising, 61 Phil.
404) A trial court has no authority to relieve the bonding
company from a part of its liability under the bail bond by
ordering a mere trial confiscation of the bond, where the body
of its principal has not been surrendered to the court despite
several extensions of time granted said company to produce
him. For it is the bonding company’s responsibility to produce
the accused before the court whenever required. Failure to do
so is indisputably complete breach of the guaranty. (People
v. Gantang Kasim and Luzon Surety Co., L-12624, May 25,
1960) However, if three days after the forfeiture of the bond,
the accused immediately submitted to the jurisdiction of the
court giving weighty reasons for his failure to appear, the
amount to be forfeited really may be reduced to a certain
degree. (People v. Cruz & Globe Assurance, L-15214-15, Oct.
26, 1960)

People v. Ignacio Sanchez, et al.
L-34222, Jan. 24, 1974

FACTS: The defendant in a criminal case was convicted,
but did not appear for execution of the judgment. He was
ordered arrested, and his appeal bond was ordered confiscated.
When the surety caught the accused, the surety asked that
judgment on the bond be reduced. May this be done?
HELD: Yes, and the reduction would generally depend
on the discretion of the judge.
House v. De La Costa
68 Phil. 742

FACTS: A brought an action for the recovery of a sum
of money from B. In the meantime, a certain property of B
317

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2084

was attached. B obtained a discharge of the attachment by
offering bondsman, C. C undertook to guarantee the return
of the property to the cost should B lose the case. Pending
the case, A bought said property from B. A won the case but
B failed to pay. Hence, A brought this action against C for
the liability under the bond. Is C liable?
HELD: C is no longer liable. It is true, C guaranteed the
return of the property but then he cannot do so now because
A himself has already bought said property. A’s own act has
made performance by the surety impossible.
(7) Special Act on Performance Bonds

Act 3688, regulating PERFORMANCE BONDS, when
speaking of the place where the action on the bond must be
brought, simply deals with VENUE which is a procedural,
not a jurisdictional, matter. (Navarro v. Aguila, 66 Phil. 604)
In case of inconsistency, the provision of Act 3688 must be
deemed repealed by those of Com. Act 103, insofar as they deal
with the settlement of “all questions, matters, controversies,
or disputes arising between and or affecting employers and
employees or laborers.” (Phil. Surety and Ins. Co. v. Tiburcio,
L-12766, May 25, 1960)

COMMENT:
(1) Consideration of Pledge or Mortgage
,

318

Pledges and mortgages are accessory contracts; therefore,
their consideration is the same as the consideration of the
principal obligation. (China Banking Corp. v. Lichauco, 46
Phil. 460) If the principal contract is void, so also is the
pledge given as security therefor.

(5) Essential Requisites for Pledge and Mortgage

(2) Ownership

The pledgor or the mortgagor must be the owner,
otherwise the pledge or mortgage is VOID. (National Bank
v. Palma Gil, 55 Phil. 639) Future property therefore
cannot be mortgaged or pledged because of the lack of
ownership. (Dilag v. Heirs of Resurrection, 76 Phil. 650)
(b) An agent cannot therefore pledge or mortgage in his own
name the property of the principal, otherwise the contract
is VOID. BUT the agent can do so, in the name of the
principal, for here the real pledgor or mortgagor is the
principal. Hence, if the agent is properly authorized, the
contract is VALID. (See Arenas v. Raymundo, 19 Phil.

The pledgor or mortgagor need not be the debtor or

(d) If a forger pledges or mortgages another’s property, the
pledge or mortgage is VOID, unless the land concerned

FACTS: Petitioners contends that because he did not
give his consent to the real estate mortgage (his signature
having been forged), then the mortgage is void and produces
no force and effect.
Not only was it proven in the trial court that the
signature of the mortgagor had been forged, but also that
somebody else an impostor—had pretended to be the former
when the mortgagee made an ocular inspection of the subject
property. The Court of Appeals, for its part, faulted petitioner

HELD: To be able to address the issue, it is crucial
to determine whether herein respondent was an innocent
mortgagee for value.” The answer is no, because he failed
to observe due diligence in the grant of the loan and in the
execution of the real estate mortgage (GSIS v. CA, 287 SCRA
204 [1998]) for which he must bear the consequences of his
negligence.
For instance, respondent’s testimony negated his assertion
he
that exercised due diligence in ascertaining the identity of
the alleged mortgagor when he made an ocular inspection of
the mortgaged property. And since he knew that the property
was being leased, respondent should have made inquiries
about the rights of the actual possessors; he could have easily
verified from the lessees whether the claimed owner was,
indeed, their lessor.
Petitioner’s act of entrusting and delivering his TCT
and Residence Certificate (now known as “Community Tax
Certificate”) to Salvador was only for the purpose of helping
him find a money lender. Not having executed a power of
attorney in his favor, he clearly did not authorize her to be
his agent in procuring the mortgage. He only asked her to
look for possible money lenders. (See Art. 1878, Civil Code)
As between petitioner and respondent, the failure of the
latter to verify essential facts was the immediate cause of
his predicament. If he were an ordinary individual without
any expertise or experience in mortgages and real estate
dealings, his failure to verify essential facts would probably
322

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 2086

have been understandable. However, he has been in the
mortgage business for seven years. Assuming that both parties
were negligent, respondent should bear the loss. His superior
knowledge of the matter should have made him more cautious
before releasing the loan and accepting the identity of the
mortgagor. (See Uy v. CA, 246 SCRA 703 [1993])

Given the particular circumstances of this case, the
negligence of petitioner is not enough to offset the fault of
respondent himself in granting the loan. The former should not
be made to suffer for respondent’s failure to verify the identity
of the mortgagor and the actual status of the subject property
before agreeing to the real estate mortgage. Respondent’s own
negligence was the primary, immediate, and overriding reason
that put him in his present predicament.

To summarize, both law and equity favor petitioner.
Three reasons are adduced, to wit:
1.

The relevant legal provision, Art. 2085, requires that the
mortgagor be the absolute owner of the thing mortgaged.
Here, the mortgagor was an impostor who executed the
contract without the knowledge and consent of the owner.

2.

Equity dictates that a loss brought about by the
concurrent negligence of two persons shall be borne by
one who was in the immediate, primary, and overriding
position to prevent it. Herein respondent, who is engaged
in the business of lending money secured by real estate
mortgages, could have easily avoided the loss by simply
exercising due diligence in ascertaining the identity of
the impostor who claimed to be the owner of the property
being mortgaged.

3.

Equity merely supplements, not supplants, the law. The
former cannot contravene or take the place of the latter.
In any event, respondent is not precluded from
availing himself of proper remedies against Salvador
and her cohorts.
(NOTA BENE: A Torrens certificate serves as
evidence of an indefeasible title to the property in favor
of the person whose name appears therein. The Torrens

323

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

system does not create or vest title. It only confirms
and records title already existing and vested. It does
not protect a usurper from the true owner. It cannot be
a shield for the commission of fraud. It does not permit
one to enrich himself at the expense of another. [Adriano
v. Pangilinan, supra])
(7) A DST is not an Imposition on the Document Itself but

on the Privilege to Enter into a Taxable Transaction
of Pledge

Michel J. Lhuillier Pawnshop, Inc. v.
Commissioner of Internal Revenue
501 SCRA 450
(2006)

FACTS: The law is clear and needs no further
interpretation. No law on legal hermeneutics could change
the fact that the entries contained in a pawnshop ticket spell
out a contract of pledge, and that the exercise of the privilege
to conclude such a contract is taxable under Sec. 195 of the
National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC).
Section 195 of the NIRC imposes DST on every pledge
regardless of whether the same is “conventional pledge”
governed by the new Civil Code or one that is governed by
the provisions of Presidential Decree (PD) 114.
It should be pointed out that the NIRC provisions on
the Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) has been amended by RA
9243. Among the highlights thereof were the amendments
to Sec. 199 thereof, which incorporated 12 more categories
of documents in addition to the initial categories exempted
from DST. Expression unius est exclusio alterius. The omission
of pawnshop tickets only means that it is not among the
documents exempted from the DST.
ISSUES: (1) When we say that a DST on pledge is an
excise tax on the exercise of a right to transfer obligations,
rights, or properties incident thereto, does it mean an
imposition on the document itself?; (2) Are all pledges subject
to DST?; and (3) Are “good faith” and “honest belief* that
one is subject to tax on the basis of previous interpretation
324

Art. 2086

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

of government agencies tasked to implement the tax law,
sufficient justifications to delete the imposition of surcharges
and interests?
HELD: (1) No. It is not an imposition on the document
itself but on the privilege to enter into a taxable transaction.
Pledge is among the privileges, the exercise of which is
subject to the DST. Thus, for purposes of taxation, the same
pawn ticket is proof of an exercise of a taxable privilege of
concluding a contract of pledge. More so, it is the exercise
of the privilege to enter into an accessory contract of pledge,
as distinguished from a contract of loan. (2) Section 195
of the NIRC unqualifiedly subjects all pledges to the DST,
unless there is a law exempting them in clear and categorical
language. For one who claims an exemption from tax payments
rests, the burden of justifying the exemption by words too
plain to be mistaken and too categorical to be misinterpreted
and (3) yes, and such is the settled rule.

investors” for the purpose of imposing the 5% percentage tax.

(c) Article 2052.
“A guaranty cannot exist without a valid obligation.
Nevertheless, a guaranty may be constituted

unenforceable contract. It may also guarantee a natural
obligation.”

(a)

325

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2087

Art. 2087. It is also of the essence of these contracts
that when the principal obligation becomes due, the things
in which the pledge or mortgage consists may be alienated
for the payment to the creditor.

COMMENT:
(1) Right to Have the Property Alienated So that the Debt

May Be Paid
This Article does not mean that the creditor automatically
become the owner, if at the time the debt falls due, the debt
is still unpaid. It only means that the property pledged or
mortgaged may be sold (to anybody, including the creditor) so
that from the proceeds of such alienation the debt might be
paid. (See Villarama v. Crisostomo, [CA..] 54 O.G. 6894 and
El Hogar Filipino v. Paredes, 45 Phil. 178) If a loan from the
GSIS is obtained by installments, but the debtor-mortgagor
signed a promissory note for every release (of the money),
providing that the loan shall earn interest, said money released
immediately earns interest, even if the entire loan had not yet
been given. Insurance on the property mortgaged, by express
stipulation of the GSIS contract, is also chargeable against
the debtor. If under the terms of the contract, there can be an
extrajudicial foreclosure upon non-fulfillment on its condition,
said stipulation can be given effect. (Jose C. Zulueta v. Hon.
Andres Reyes, et al., L-21807, May 29, 1967)

(2) Violations of Conditions May Authorize Immediate

Foreclosure
As a rule, the mortgage can be foreclosed only when the
debt remains unpaid at the time it is due, but the violation of
certain conditions in the mortgage may authorize immediate
foreclosure. (Gov’t, of the P.I. v. Espejo, 57 Phil. 496) Hence,
if a mortgage contract prohibits the mortgagor to execute a
lease or a second mortgage on the property without the written
consent of the mortgagee, a violation of this condition would
make the mortgage debt due and demandable, and would
entitle the mortgagee immediately to bring an action for the
foreclosure of the mortgage. (Vasquez v. Jocson & Araneta,
62 Phil. 537) Regarding the stipulations that may be agreed
326

Art. 2087

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

upon, would it be lawful to stipulate in a mortgage of real
property that the property can be sold at a public auction
without judicial proceeding in case the mortgage debt is not
paid within the time stipulated?

ANS.: Yes. (Lopez & Javelona v. El Hogar Filipino, 47
Phil. 247) As a matter of fact, the extrajudicial foreclosure
of mortgages is authorized by Act 3135, passed on March 6,
1924. The silence of the Rules of Court as to extrajudicial
foreclosure of mortgage on real property does not operate to
blot out such a remedy. The right to extrajudicial foreclosure
when so stipulated in a mortgage is established by substantive
law. (11 Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, p. 234)
The Supreme Court has even declared that the power of the
mortgagee to sell the mortgaged property to satisfy his credit
survives after the death of the mortgagor. Property which is
however in custodia legis, cannot be extrajudicially foreclosed,
because this is not provided for in Act 3135. (Pasno v. Ravina,
54 Phil. 378)
(3) Price

'

Just because the price is considered inadequate this does
not mean that the foreclosure sale should be cancelled. It would
be otherwise if the price were shocking. (See Bank of P.I. v.
Green, 52 Phil. 249) It has been held that the price of P8.375
at the public auction for property assessed at P19.140 is not
so shocking to the conscience as to warrant the cancellation
of a sale which was carried out with the formalities of the

law, especially where the mortgagor had been given ample
opportunity, to sell the property at a higher price. (Go Letting
& Sons, etc. v. Leyte Land Transportation Co., et al., L-8887,
May 28, 1958)

El Hogar Filipino v. Phil. NatT Bank
64 Phil. 582
FACTS: Property was mortgaged to the El Hogar Filipino.
With the consent of the mortgagee, it was mortgaged for the
second time to the Philippine National Bank (PNB) (junior
mortgagee). When the mortgage was foreclosed, the proceeds
realized were just enough to pay off the first mortgage. Has
the PNB still a lien on the property?
327

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2087

HELD: No more. The security in favor of the PNB, as
second creditor and mortgagee, was extinguished. Its only
right under the mortgage, aside from the right to repurchase,
would have been to apply to the payment of its credit the
excess of the proceeds of the sale after the payment of
that of the El Hogar Filipino, such being the effect of the
subordination of its mortgage to that of the latter. However,
there was no excess and so the mortgage in favor of the PNB
was extinguished because it cannot be enforced by said bank
beyond the total value of the mortgaged land. Consequently,
the land passed to the purchaser (at the foreclosure sale) free
from the mortgage in favor of the PNB. The bank’s claim that
the second mortgage in its favor stands to the prejudice of the
purchaser is untenable particularly because, as the purchaser
in this case is the first mortgagee itself (El Hogar Filipino),
the result, inverting the legal effects of two mortgages would
practically be to convert the second mortgage into a first
mortgage, and the first mortgage into second mortgage.
(NOTE: Although there is no more mortgage in favor of
the PNB, this does not mean that the debtor should not pay
his debt any more in favor of the PNB.)

,

taxes, conveys only such title as was vested in the delinquent
taxpayer. Such sale cannot affect the rights of other lien
holders unless by the procedure adopted, they had been given

an opportunity to defend their rights.
(NOTE: Although as a rule, there is an implied warranty
against eviction, this does not render liable a sheriff auctioneer,
mortgagee, pledgee, or other person professing to sell by
virtue of authority in fact or law, for the sale of a thing in
which a third person has a legal or equitable interest. [Last
paragraph, Art. 1547] Note also that “if the property is sold
for non-payment of taxes due and not made known to the
vendee before the sale, the vendor is liable for eviction.” [Art.
1551])

Art. 2088. The creditor cannot appropriate the things
given by way of pledge or mortgage, or dispose of them.
Any stipulation to the contrary is null and void.

A borrowed from B a sum of money. A offered his house
by way of a mortgage. It was expressly stipulated in the
contract that upon non-payment of the debt on time, the
house would belong to B. Is the stipulation valid?

ANS.: No, such a stipulation (pacto comisorio) is
null and void. “This forfeiture clause has traditionally
not been allowed because it is contrary to good morals
and public policy.” (Report of the Code Commission, p.
156; See Perez v. Cortez, 35 Phil. 211 and Tan Chun Tic
v. West Coast Life Ins. Co., 54 Phil. 361)
(b)

It is true that a debtor, instead of paying in cash, can
just alienate in favor of his creditor property to satisfy the
debt (dation in payment) but it would be illegal for the
debtor to previously authorize the creditor to appropriate
the property pledged or mortgaged as the latter’s own
in payment of the debt. It is true that the property
may be alienated in favor of anybody in order that the
debt may be paid, as long as the formalities of the law
329

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 2088

'•

are complied with, and it is true that even the creditor
himself may get the property but he cannot become the
owner automatically just because the debtor does not pay
his debt. To provide for automatic ownership would be
to stipulate a pactum commissorium. In one case, the
Supreme Court held: “The stipulation in the mortgage
that the land covered thereby shall become the property
of the mortgagee upon failure to pay the debt within the
period agreed upon, constitutes a pactum commissorium
and is therefore null and void.” (Tan Chun Tic v. West
Coast Life, 54 Phil. 361) Similarly, a stipulation that in
case of non-payment, the mortgaged property would be
considered full payment “without further action in court,”
is null and void, being “pactum commissorium.’ (Reyes
V. Nebrija, 98 Phil. 639)

(2) Cases

Warner, Barnes and Co. v. Buenaflor and Macoy
(CjL) 36 O.G. 3290

FACTS: A pledged his property in favor of B to secure
a loan. It was expressly stipulated in the contract that the
pledgee could purchase the things pledged at the current
purchase price if the debt was not paid on time. Is this a
valid stipulation?
HELD: Yes. What is prohibited by Art. 2088, dealing
with pacto comisorio, is the automatic appropriation by the
creditor or pledgee in payment of the loan at the expiration
of the period agreed upon. The reason for the prohibition
is that the amount of the loan is ordinarily much less than
the real value of the things pledged. Where there is express
authorization of the pledgee to purchase the things pledged at
the current market price, the contract would not come within
the prohibition.
(NOTE: If a mortgagor promises to sell the property to the
mortgagee upon default, this is merely a personal obligation,
and does not bind the land. Hence, he can still sell the land
to a stranger BUT he would be liable for damages. [Guerrero
v. Yhigo & CA, 96 Phil. 37])

330

Art. 2088

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Banjo v. Salmon
15 Phil. 436
The creditor is not allowed to appropriate to himself the
thing held as pledge or under mortgage, nor can he dispose of
the same as owner. He is merely entitled, after the principal
obligation becomes due, to move for the sale of the things
pledged, in order to collect the amount of the claim from the

proceeds.
Dalay v. Aquiatin and Maximo
47 Phil. 951

FACTS: A document contained this clause: “If I cannot
pay the aforesaid amount when the date agreed upon comes,
the same shall be paid with the lands given, as security...”
The issue is: does this partake of the nature of pacto comisorio
and therefore in violation of Art. 2088?
HELD: Two things are prohibited under Art. 2088: (1)
the appropriation by the creditor of the things given by way
of pledge or mortgage; and (2) the disposition thereof by the
creditor. The stipulation quoted does not authorize either one
or the other. Clearly, it does not authorize the creditor to
dispose of the properties mortgaged. Neither does it authorize
him to appropriate the same. What it says is merely a promise
to pay the debt with such properties, if at its maturity, the
debt remains unsatisfied. It is merely a promise made by the
debtor to assign the property given as security in payment
of the debt, a promise accepted by the herein creditor. There
is no doubt that under the law, a debtor may make an
assignment of his properties in payment of debt. (Art. 1255,
Civil Code) And the assignment is not made unlawful by the
fact that the said properties are mortgaged, because the title
thereto remains in the debtor; nor is a promise to make such
an assignment in violation of the law. Therefore, Art. 2088
is not applicable to the stipulation in question.
(NOTE: “We disagree to such holding of the court.
While it is true that in form said stipulation may not be
considered a pactum commissorium, it is nonetheless true that
it has the same effect which pactum commissorium produces.
Furthermore, it places the debtor at a great disadvantage.
331

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Ait. 2088

In case the property is mortgaged for an amount very much
lower than its real value, the creditor would have the benefit
of acquiring the same at a very low price. Upon the other
hand, if the property mortgaged is sold and the proceeds of
the sale are more than the amount of the loan, the claim of
the creditor is paid, and the balance of the sale is given to
the debtors.” [Ventura, Land Registration and Mortgages, p.
368])

Furthermore, is this not tantamount to a forfeiture? For,
suppose the lands are worth, let us say, four times the mortgage
debt, should the creditor be allowed to get the entire lands
for himself? If so, is this not forfeiture (of three-fourths of the
value of the land) speaking of which the Code Commission
says: “This forfeiture clause has traditionally been outlawed,
because it is contrary to good morals and public policy.”
(Report of the Code Commission, p. 156) Moreover, the new
Civil Code presumes in certain cases a contract with pacto de
retro, to be an equitable mortgage precisely for the purpose of
preventing an indirect violation of Art. 2088, which prohibits
a pacto comisorio. If we are to hold that the creditor in the
problem presented would be entitled to the whole land, what
then would be the use of introducing reforms in the "pacto de
retro problems”? If it is claimed, however, that the creditor
would not be entitled to the whole land, what then is the
meaning of the clause “If I cannot pay the aforesaid amount
when the date agreed upon comes, the same shall be paid
with the lands given as security”? Suppose, the debtor does
not want to pay with the land, cannot under the premises
given, the court compel him to do so? And if this is done, is
this not practically countenancing a forfeiture?

—

It is true that the law allows an assignment in favor of
creditor for the payment of a debt but this assignment is made
only afterwards, not at the time the obligation is constituted.
If, however, the clause is construed to mean that the land
will be responsible for the payment of the debt, that is, if the
land is worth four times the debt, the creditor should return
three-fourths of the value of the price, this construction in
our opinion would be legal for in this case there would be no
unwarranted forfeiture.

A. Francisco Realty & Development Corp. v.
Court of Appeals and Sps. Romulo SA. Javillonar
and Erlinda P. Javillonar
GR 125055, Oct. 30, 1998

FACTS: Petitioner granted a loan to respondent spouses,
in consideration of which the latter executed a promissory
note, a deed of mortgage, and an undated deed of sale of
the mortgaged property in favor of petitioner as mortgagee.
As respondent spouses failed to pay the interest, petitioner
registered the sale of the land in its favor and a new transfer
certificate of title was issued in its name. Respondent spouses
likewise failed to pay the principal loan. When respondent
spouses refused to vacate the property, petitioner filed an
action for possession before the trial court.

The trial court rendered a decision in favor of petitioner
but, upon appeal, was reversed by the Court of Appeals (CA).
On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed with modification the

CA’s decision.
HELD: The stipulations in the promissory notes providing
that, upon failure of respondent spouses to pay interest,
ownership of the property would be automatically transferred to
petitioner and the deed of sale in its favor would be registered
in its name constitute in substance pactum commissorium,
which is prohibited under Art. 2088. The subject transaction
being void, the registration of the deed of sale, by virtue
of which petitioner was able to obtain a certificate of title
covering the subject lot, must also be declared void.
(3) Mortgagee Cannot Sell During Existence of Principal

Obligation
Is a mortgagee allowed during the existence of the
principal debt, to sell the property mortgaged to him?
ANS.: No, because this would certainly be an act of
disposition. The answer would be the same even if the contract
allows the sale, for in such a case, said stipulation would be
null and void.

(4) Case

Hechanova v. Adil
GR 49940, Sept. 25, 1986
A deed of mortgage which contains a stipulation that
in case the mortgagor fails to pay the debt secured by the
mortgage, the mortgagee shall become the owner of the
property is null and void.

Art. 2089. A pledge or mortgage is indivisible, even
though the debt may be divided among the successors in
interest of the debtor or of the creditor.
Therefore, the debtor’s heir who has paid a part of the
debt cannot ask for the proportionate extinguishment of the
pledge or mortgage as long as the debt is not completely
satisfied.
Neither can the creditor’s heir who received his share
of the debt return the pledge or cancel the mortgage, to
the prejudice of the other heirs who have not been paid.
From these provisions is excepted the case in which,
there being several things given in mortgage or pledge,
each one of them guarantees only a determinate portion
of the credit.

Art. 2090

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

A borrowed Pl million from B, secured by a mortgage on
A’s land. B died leaving two children, R and T. A paid
R, P50O.00O. Is R allowed to cancel the mortgage?

ANS.: No. (Par. 3, Art. 2089)
(2) Example of the Exception

A borrowed Pl,000,000 from B, secured by the pledge
of a ring for a debt of P200,000; find by a mortgage on A’s
land, for the balance of P800,000. If A pays P200.000, can he
demand the return of the ring?
ANS.: Yes, because in this case the ring guaranteed only
P200,000. (Pars. 3 and 4, Art. 2089)
(3) Mortgage on Both a House and Its Lot

If a mortgage is constituted on a house and its lot,
both should be sold TOGETHER at the foreclosure, and not
separately. (Bisayas, et al. v. Lee, et al., [CA..] 53 O.G. 1518)
Similarly, if the mortgage is on two lots, the mortgagee can
demand the sale of either or both. This is because the mortgage
is INDIVISIBLE. (Aquino v. Macondray and Co., 97 Phil. 731)
(4) Non-Applicability to Third Persons

The indivisibility of a mortgage does not apply to third
persons. (Nat. Bank v. Agudelo, 58 Phil. 655)

The debtor, in this case, shall have a right to the
extinguishment of the pledge or mortgage as the portion
of the debt for which each thing is specially answerable is
satisfied.

Art. 2090. The indivisibility of a pledge or mortgage is
not affected by the fact that the debtors are not solidarity
liable.

(1) Indivisibility of a Pledge or Mortgage

(1) Indivisibility Applies Even if Debtors are not Solidary

Examples:
(a)

The Article explains itself.

A borrowed Pl,000,000 from B, secured by a mortgage on
A’s land. A died leaving children, X and Y. X paid P50,000
to B. Can X ask for the proportionate extinguishment of
the mortgage?

ANS.: No (Par. 2, Art. 2089), but of course the debt
is now only half. Indeed, a mortgage is indivisible, but
the principal obligation may be divisible.

(2) Case

Ong v. Intermediate Appellate Court
GR 74073, Sept. 13, 1991

FACTS: Madrigal Shipping Co., Inc. was granted a
P2,094,000 loan by Solidbank payable on or before July 27,
335

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2091

1978, at 10% interest per annum. As security, Madrigal pledged
in favor of the bank a barge and a tugboat. Madrigal failed
to pay its obligation to Solidbank. When the bank was to
sell the pledged properties, it found out that the tugboat and

,

the barge had surreptitiously been taken from Pasig River,
where they were moored and towed to the North Harbor,
without the knowledge and consent of the bank. Meanwhile,
Ong bought the barge which was subject of the pledge from
Ocampo, a successful bidder in a public auction by virtue of
a writ of execution issued by the National Labor Relations
Commission, in a labor case. The Bank then sued Ong for
replevin with damages before the Regional Trial Court. The
trial court ordered the seizure of the barge upon posting of a
bond in the sum of Pl,000,000. Thereafter, the court ordered
Ong to put up a counterbond of P400.000 executed in favor
of Solidbank; otherwise, the latter’s motion to release the
property subject of replevin will be granted. The Court of
Appeals sustained the trial court.

ISSUE: Whether the contract of pledge entered into by
and between Solidbank and Madrigal is binding on Ong. Ong
rely heavily on the fact that the contract of pledge by and
between Solidbank and Madrigal was not recorded under Secs.
804 and 809 of the Tariff and Customs Code and argue that
it is not binding on third persons, like Ong.
HELD: The Supreme Court affirmed the appellate court’s
decision and held that all the requisites for a valid pledge
has been complied with. The pledge agreement is a public
agreement, the same having been notarized. The pledge was
delivered to Solidbank which had it moored at the Pasig River
where it was guarded by a security guard. Madrigal, owner
of the barge, pledged the vessel and tugboat to securing its
obligation to the bank in the amount of P2,094,000. No payment
was made by Madrigal as pledgor. Therefore, Solidbank has
the right to it until it is paid. Solidbank is obviously a lawful
and rightful possessor of the personal property pledged.

Art. 2091. The contract of pledge or mortgage may
secure all kinds of obligations, be they pure or subject to
a suspensive or resolutory condition.
336

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2092

COMMENT:
The Kinds of Obligations Which a Pledge or a Mortgage
May Secure

The Article is self-explanatory.

Art. 2092. A promise to constitute a pledge or mortgage
gives rise only to a personal action between the contracting
parties, without prejudice to the criminal responsibility
incurred by him who defrauds another, by offering in pledge
or mortgage as unencumbered, things which he knew were
subject to some burden, or by misrepresenting himself to
be the owner of the same.

COMMENT:
(1) A Promise to Constitute a Pledge or Mortgage

A borrowed P10 million from B. A promised to execute a
mortgage to guarantee this debt. The promise was accepted.
Suppose A has not yet constituted the mortgage, can we say
that there already exists a mortgage here?

—

ANS.: No, there is no mortgage as yet no real right has
been created. What exists, however, is a personal right of B to
demand the constitution of the mortgage. Thus, in one case,
inasmuch as the debtor had made a promise to constitute
a pledge and inasmuch as the promise had been accepted
by the creditor-bank, it was held that the bank could have,
under Art. 2082, compelled the fulfillment of the agreement.
(See Mitsui Bussan Kaisha v. Hongkong & Shanghai Bank,
36 Phil. 27)
(2) Judicial Declaration of Lien is Sufficient

It has been held that though there is nothing wrong in
requiring the debtor to execute the mortgage, still in certain
cases a judicial declaration of the existence of the lien would be
sufficient. For “a court of equity never requires an unnecessary
thing, and in this case, all the rights of the creditor will
be adequately protected by declaring that the indebtedness
recognized by the debtor, constitutes a lien in the nature of a
mortgage upon the Hacienda Salvacion, it appearing that the
registration of the whole has been effected. It is a maxim of
337

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2092

jurisprudence that equity regards that has done which ought
to be done, and in obedience to this precept, as between the
parties to this record, the property must be considered to be
subject to the same lien, as if the mortgage which had been
agreed to be made had been actually executed.” (Laplana v.
Garchitorena Chereau, 48 Phil. 163)

Chapter 2
I

(3) Double Remedies

Is it inconsistent to ask in one action that: (a) the
mortgage be constituted; or (b) the indebtedness be paid?
HELD: No, they are not inconsistent. (Laplana v.
Garchitorena Chereau, supra)

f

PLEDGE

.

Art. 2093. In addition to the requisites prescribed
in Article 2085, it is necessary, in order to constitute the
contract of pledge, that the thing pledged be placed in the
possession of the creditor, or of a third person by common
agreement.

(4) Estafa

Any person who, pretending to be the owner of any real
property, shall convey, sell, encumber, or mortgage the same
shall be guilty of estafa. (Art. 316, par. 1, Revised Penal Code)
This crime has three constituent elements:
(1) the property should be real property, for otherwise,
the crime might be theft or another crime, but not

estafa;

.

the offender must have pretended to be the owner,
that is, he should not have been in good faith;
otherwise, deceit or fraud would not be present;
and
(3) the fictitious owner must have executed some acts
of ownership to the prejudice of the true owner.
(2)

(5) Another Instance of Estafa

Any person who, knowing that real property is
encumbered, shall dispose of the same as unencumbered, is
also guilty of estafa. (Art. 316, par. 2, Revised Penal Code) It
is essential in a case like this that fraud or deceit be practiced
upon the vendee at the time of the sale. (People v. Mariano,
40 O.G. [45] No. 8, p. 91)
(6) Ownership Not a Necessary Element of Estafa

The Supreme Court in Hernandez v. CA, 228 SCRA 429
(1993), held that ownership is not a necessary element of the
crime of estafa.
338

COMMENT:
(1) Thing Pledged Must Be in Possession of the Creditor or

a Third Person By Common Agreement
This requisite is most essential and is characteristic of
a pledge without which the contract cannot be regarded as
entered into because precisely in this delivery lies the security of
the pledge. (Manresa) Indeed, if Art. 2093 is not complied with,
the pledge is VOID. (El Banco Espahol-Filipino v. Peterson, 7
Phil. 409) Until the delivery of the thing, the whole rests in
an executory contract, however strong may be the engagement
to deliver it, and the “pledgee” acquires no right of property
in the thing. (U.S. v. Terrel, 2 Phil. 222) Hence, if a pledgee
fails or neglects to take this property into his possession, he
is presumed to have waived the right granted him by the
contract. (U.S. v. Terrel, supra) Furthermore, mere taking of
possession is insufficient to continue the pledge. The pledgee
must continue in said possession. (Pacific Commercial Co. v.
National Bank, 49 Phil. 237) Furthermore, mere symbolical
delivery is insufficient. There must be actual possession
actual delivery of possession. (Betita v. Ganzon, 49 Phil. 87)

—

(2) Effectivity Against Third Persons

A pledgee shall not take effect against third persons if a
description of the thing pledged and the date of the pledge do
not appear in a public instrument. (Art. 2096)
339

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2094

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(3) Symbolic Delivery

Although we have seen that symbolic delivery is not
sufficient, still if the pledgee, before the pledge, had the thing
already in his possession, then the requirement of the law
has been satisfied. For then, said pledgee would be in actual
possession. The same thing may be said in case the thing
pledged is in the possession of a third person by common
agreement. (See Art. 2093)

Has the contract of pledge been perfected in this case?
HELD: Yes, since C became the depositary by common
agreement. (Banco Espanol-Filipino v. Peterson, et al., 7 Phil.
409)

Betita v. Ganzon
49 Phil. 87

In case of doubt as to whether a transaction is a
pledge or a dation in payment, the presumption is in favor
of a pledge, the latter being the lesser transmission of
rights and interests.

340

Certificates of stock or of stock dividends, under the
Corporation Code, are quasi-negotiable instruments in
the sense that they may be given in pledge to secure an
obligation.

The Manila Banking Corp. v. Teodoro, et al.
GR 53955, Jan. 13, 1989

Art. 2094. All movables which are within commerce may
be pledged, provided they are susceptible of possession.

—

(c)

HELD: The pledge is not valid for failure to deliver
possession, but even granting its validity, it can only refer
to the personal property and not to the real property.

FACTS: Buhayan pledged to Betita four carabaos which
Buhayan owned but which were actually in the possession
of Jacinto. Betita never took possession of the carabaos.
Furthermore, nothing in the contract stated that Jacinto was
by common consent made the depositary in Betita’s behalf. Has
a pledge been lawfully constituted here?
HELD: No. The delivery of possession of the property
pledged requires actual possession and a mere symbolic
delivery is insufficient.

Only movables can be pledged (including incorporeal
rights See Art. 2095).

Real property cannot be pledged. A pledge cannot include
a lien on real property. (Pac. Com. Co. v. Phil. Natl. Bank,
49 Phil. 236)

FACTS: The Gulf Plantation Co., to secure a loan not
exceeding P165,000, constituted a pledge in favor of the
Philippine National Bank. The document was prepared
on the customary blank form of pledge. It was entered
into on Aug. 24, 1918, and endorsed on Feb. 24, 1921 by
the Register of Deeds with the words “received this 24th
day of Feb. 1921, at 9:30 AM.” The property was never
placed in the possession of the bank. Furthermore, the
property consisted of some bales of hemp, and the rest
were all real properties consisting of buildings and lands.

In one case, A pledged to B the goods found in a warehouse
formerly rented by A. By common consent, it was agreed that C,
a depositary, would take charge of the goods in the warehouse.

What May Be Pledged

Art. 2094

In the province of Tarlac, a sugar fanner couple from
Hacienda Luisita borrowed money from Don Pepe, the local
merchant who charges usurious interests. To guarantee
payment, they left their stock option certificate issued by the
Hacienda management with the merchant, for him to hold until
they pay the loan. Is there a: i) contract of pledge; ii) contract of
mortgage; iii) contract of antichresis; or, iv) none of the above?
341

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arte. 2095-2096

ANS.: None of the above. There is no pledge because only
movable property may be pledged. (Art. 2094, Civil Code) If at
all, there was a pledge of the paper or document constituting
the stock option certificate as movable by itself, but not of
the sugar land which the certificate represents. There is no
mortgage because no deed or contract was executed in the
manner required by law for a mortgage. (Arts. 2085-2092,
2124-2131, id.) There is no contract of antichresis because no
right to the fruits of the property was given to the creditor.
(Art. 2132, id.)

To be precise, a contract of simple loan was entered into
with security arrangement agreed upon by the parties which is
not one of them abovementioned.
Art 2095. Incorporeal rights, evidenced by negotiable
instruments, bills of lading, shares of stock, bonds, warehouse
receipts and similar documents may also be pledged. The
instrument proving the right pledged shall be delivered to
the creditor, and if negotiable, must be indorsed.

Art. 2096

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

COMMENT:
(1) Effectivity of Pledge Against Third Persons
(a)

A public instrument must be made.

(b)

The instrument must contain the DESCRIPTION of the
thing pledged and the DATE of the pledge.

(2) Reason for the Law

A debtor in bad faith may attempt to conceal his property
by simulating a pledge thereof with an accomplice. Article 2096
is, of course, mandatory in character.
(3) Mere Delivery Not Sufficient

To affect third persons, mere delivery of possession is
insufficient. “This provision (Art. 2096) has been interpreted in
the sense that for the contract to affect third persons, it must
appear in a public instrument in addition to delivery of the
thing pledged.” (Bachrach Motor Co. v. Lacson Ledesma, 64
Phil. 681)
(4) Assignee Under the Insolvency Law

COMMENT:
(1) Pledge of Incorporeal Rights
(a)

The instrument proving the right pledged must be
DELIVERED.

(b)

If negotiable, said instrument must be ENDORSED.

(2) Pledge Certificate

A pledge certificate by itself is not a negotiable instrument,
and therefore even if delivered and endorsed to an assignee,
he would have no right to redeem the property, unless the
creditor-pledgee consents. (Concepcion v. Agenda Emperios de
A. Aguirre, [CA.] 63 O.G. 1431)

Art. 2096. A pledge shall not take effect against third
persons if a description of the thing pledged and the date of
the pledge do not appear in a public instrument,

342

An assignee of a person under the Insolvency Law is a
third person within the meaning of Art. 2096 of the Civil Code.
This is because the assignee insofar as the collection of credits
is concerned, is the representative of the creditors and not of
the bankrupt. Furthermore, when goods or merchandise have
been pledged to secure the payment of a debt of a particular
creditor, the other creditors of the pledgor are “third persons”
with relation to the pledge contract and pledgor and pledgee.
(Te Pate v. Ingersoll, 43 Phil. 394)
(5) Problem

A is indebted to B, so A pledges his diamond ring to B. The
ring is delivered to B, but in the public instrument executed,
there is no description of the ring, and the date of the pledge
does not appear. If A sells the ring to C, does C have to respect
the pledge in favor of Bl
ANS.: No. C does not have to respect the pledge since as
to him, the pledge is not effective and valid. (Art. 2096)
343

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 2097-2098

(6) Effect if No Public Instrument is Made

When the contract of pledge is not recorded in a public
instrument, it is void as against third persons; the buyer of
the thing pledged is a third person within the meaning of the
article. The fact that the person claiming as pledgee has taken
actual physical possession of the thing sold will not prevent
the pledge from being declared void insofar as the innocent
stranger is concerned. (Tec Bi and Co. v. Chartered Bank of
India, Australia and China, 16 O.G. 908; Ocejo, Perez and Co.

v. International Bank, 37 Phil. 631)
Art. 2097. With the consent of the pledgee, the thing
pledged may be alienated by the pledgor or owner, subject to
the pledge. The ownership of the thing pledged is transmitted
to the vendee or transferee as soon as the pledgee consents
to the alienation, but the latter shall continue in possession.

COMMENT:
Pledgor May Alienate Thing Pledged

EXAMPLE:
A pledged his diamond ring with B. A may sell the ring
provided that B consents. The sale is, however, subject to the
pledge, that is, the pledge would bind third persons if Art. 2096
has been followed. If C buys the ring, the ownership of the ring
is transferred to him, as soon as B consents to the sale but B
shall continue to be in possession of the ring.

Art. 2098. The contract of pledge gives a right to the
creditor to retain the thing in his possession or in that of a
third person to whom it has been delivered, until the debt is
paid.

Art. 2099

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(2) Rule Under the Old Law

Under the old Civil Code, the second paragraph of the
equivalent article (1866, old Civil Code) granted the creditor
the right to retain the property pledged as guaranty for any
other obligation of the debtor. But said second paragraph has
been eliminated. “It is thought that said provision was unjust.
If the creditor wants the original pledge to apply also to the
new claim, he should so demand at the time the later obligation
is entered into. It cannot be fairly presumed that the debtor
consented to the new pledge.” (Report of the Code Commission,
p. 156)
EXAMPLE: A borrowed Pl,000,000 from B. As security, A
pledged his diamond ring. Later, A borrowed P200,000. When
the first debt fell due, A paid the Pl,000,000 and demanded the
return of the ring. But B wants to retain the ring until he has
been paid the remaining debt of P200.000.

ISSUE: Does B have the right to retain the ring?
ANS.: Under the old Civil Code, yes; but under the new
Civil Code, no.
(3) No Double Pledge

Property which has been lawfully pledged to a creditor
cannot be pledged to another as long as the first one subsists.
(Mission de San Vicente v. Reyes, 19 Phil. 524) This is so, for
otherwise, how can the thing pledged be delivered to the second
creditor? It must be noted that if the first pledgee or creditor

gives up the possession of the property pledged, such pledge is
thereby extinguished notwithstanding the continuation of the
principal obligation guaranteed by the pledge. (See Art. 2110,

Civil Code)

A owes B Pl,000,000. As security, A pledged his diamond
ring with B. B has the right to retain the ring until the

COMMENT:
Duty of Pledgee to Take Care of Thing Pledged
(a)

(b)

When the possession of property belonging to a debtor
is delivered to a creditor simply as a guaranty for
the payment of a debt, the title does not pass to the
temporary possessor, who has no right to damage or to
destroy, and is liable for any injury he may cause. (Bonjoc
v. Cuison, 13 Phil. 301) But the pledgee should not be
held responsible for fortuitous events except if there is a
contrary stipulation, or when the nature of the obligation
requires the assumption of risk. (Art. 1174, Civil Code)

If the pledgee has exercised all the care and diligence which
the law requires of her, she cannot be held responsible for
the theft of the jewelry pledged with her. Had the theft
occurred as a result of her fault or negligence, she would
have been liable. (San Jose and Carlos v. Ruiz, 71 Phil.
541)

Cruz and Serrano v. Chua A.H. Lee
54 Phil. 10

FACTS: Cornelio Cruz pledged valuable jewelry to the
Monte de Piedad which gave him two pawn tickets. These two
pawn tickets were in turn pledged by him to Chua A.H. Lee.
The tickets could be renewed from time to time upon payment
of the proper interest. Lee renewed them once, but did not
continue as time passed. Eventually, the tickets lost their
value.
ISSUE: Is Lee responsible for the loss of the value of the
tickets?

HELD: Yes. The principal question requiring decision
in the case before us is one of law, namely, whether a person
who takes a pawn ticket in pledge is bound to renew the ticket
from time to time, by the payment of interest, or premium, as
required by the pawnbroker, until the rights of the pledgor are
finally foreclosed. It must be borne in mind that the ordinary
pawn ticket is a document by virtue of which the property in
the thing pledged passes from hand to hand by mere deliveiy
of the ticket, and the contract of pledge is therefore absolvable
to bearer. It results that one who takes a pawn ticket in pledge
346

Arts. 2100-2101

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

,

acquires domination over the pledge; and it is the holder who
must renew the pledge if it is to be kept alive. The law (Art.
2099) contemplates that the pledgee may have to undergo
expenses in order to prevent the pledge from being lost; and
these expenses the pledgee is entitled to recover from the
pledgor. From this, it follows that where the pledge is lost by
a failure like this failure of the pledgee to renew the loan
he is liable for the resulting damage. Nor, in this case, was
the duty of the pledgee destroyed by the fact that the pledgee
had obtained a judgment for the debt of the pledgor which was
secured by the pledge. The duty to use the diligence of a good
father of the family in caring for the pledge subsists as long as
the pledged article remains in the power of the pledgee.

he receives with those which are owing him; but if none are

is due, he shall apply it to the principal. Unless there is a
stipulation to the contrary, the pledge shall extend to the
interest and earnings of the right pledged.
In case of a pledge of animals, their offspring shall
pertain to the pledgor or owner of the animals pledged, but
shall be subject to the pledge, if there is no stipulation to the

When Pledgor May Require That the Object Be Deposited
With a Third Person
The Article explains itself.

Art. 2107. If there are reasonable grounds to fear the
destruction or impairment of the thing pledged, without the
fault of the pledgee, the pledgor may demand the return of
the thing, upon offering another thing in pledge, provided
the latter is of the same kind as the former and not of inferior
quality, and without prejudice to the right of the pledgee
under the provisions of the following article.
The pledgee is bound to advise the pledgor, without
delay, of any danger to the thing pledged.

COMMENT:

,

EXAMPLE: A pledged canned goods with B. Because the
goods were in danger of deterioration, B sold them for
P20.000. Who owns the P20.000?
ANS.: A owns the P20.000, but B shall keep the
money as security in the same manner as the canned
goods originally pledged.

(b)

Note that the sale under this Article must be a “public
sale.” Note also that here the pledgee is without fault.

Art. 2109. If the creditor is deceived on the substance
or quality of the thing pledged, he may either claim another
thing in its stead, or demand immediate payment of the
principal obligation.

When Destruction or Impairment is Feared, Without the
Fault of the Pledgee
This Article is applicable if the danger arises without
fault or negligence on the part of the pledgee. Two remedies
are granted, one for the pledgor; the other, for the pledgee.

to the pledgor or owner, the pledge is extinguished. Any
stipulation to the contrary shall be void.
If subsequent to the perfection of the pledge, the thing
is in the possession of the pledgor or owner, there is a prima

pledgee. This same presumption exists if the thing pledged is

(1) Return of Thing Pledged

P100.000. It was agreed that after a week, B would return
351

Art. 2111

the ring although the debt would be paid only after one year.
It was also agreed that although A would once more be in
possession of the ring, the pledge would continue. After a
week, B, as stipulated, returned the ring. Has the pledge been
extinguished?
ANS.: Yes. (Par. 1, Art. 2110) The stipulation about the
continuation of the pledge is VOID.
(2)

When Thing Pledged is Found in the Possession of the
Pledgor or Owner
A pledged with B a Mont Blanc- Meisterstuck fountain
pen. A week later, the pen was found in A’s possession. There
is presumption here that B has returned the fountain pen and
that therefore the pledge has been extinguished. May this
presumption be rebutted?
ANS.: Yes, since the presumption is merely prima facie.
For example, B may have returned the pen and asked that it be
substituted; or a stranger may have stolen the pen, and given
it to A. (1st sentence, 2nd paragraph, Art. 2110)

(2) Form Needed Statement in Writing
Notice that renunciation or the abandonment must be
in writing. An oral waiver is not sufficient. But if the pledgee
orally renounces the pledge, and returns the thing pledged to
the pledgor, the pledge is thereby extinguished, not because of
Art. 2111, but because of Art. 2110, first paragraph.

Art. 2112. The creditor to whom the credit has not been
satisfied in due time, may proceed before a Notary Public
to the sale of the thing pledged. This sale shall be made at
a public auction, and with notification to the debtor and
the owner of the thing pledged in a proper case, stating the
amount for which the public sale is to be held. If at the first
auction the thing is not sold, a second one with the same
formalities shall be held; and if at the second auction there
is no sale either, the creditor may appropriate the thing
pledged. In this case he shall be obliged to give an acquittance
for his entire claim.

Art. 2111. A statement in writing by the pledgee that he

necessary, the pledgee becoming a depositary.

the ring. Later, although the principal obligation had not been
paid, B wrote on a private document that he was renouncing
the pledge. A did not accept this renunciation, and the ring
remained in B’s possession. Has the pledge been extinguished.

The debt is already due.
(b) There must be the intervention of a notary public.
(c) There must be a public auction (if at the first, it is not sold,

order. (Decision of the Supreme Court of Spain on Oct. 21, 1902,
94 Jur. Civil 364) Hence, a stipulation in a mortgage conferring
a power of sale upon the mortgagee in default of payment is
valid. (El Hogar Filipino v. Paredes, 45 Phil. 178)

ANS.: No, because there must be a second auction.
(b) Suppose at the second auction, the thing pledged is not
sold, may the pledgee now appropriate the thing for
himself?
ANS.: Yes. In this case, he shall be obliged to give an
acquittance for his entire claim?
If he believes that the pledged thing is worth much more
than the principal debt, should the pledgee give the excess?
ANS.: No. It is his right to get the whole value of the
thing. (Contrast with the rule in case it was sold.) (Art. 2115) If
the value happens to be less and the pledgee appropriates the
thing for himself, is he entitled to any deficiency judgment?
ANS.: No. He is obliged to cancel the entire obligation.
After all, why did he accept a pledge of something worth less
than the principal obligation?

(NOTE: Act 3135 allows the extrajudicial foreclosure
of mortgages, but the procedure set forth therein must be
followed. The creditor himself is not authorized to conduct the
sale for the law itself provides that the sale shall be under the
direction of the sheriff of the province, the justice or auxiliary
justice of the peace of the municipality. The El Hogar case was
decided prior to the passage of Act 3135. This Act is still in
force.)

(5) Rule When Pledgee is Expressly Authorized to Sell Upon

Default
If in the contract of pledge, the pledgee is authorized to
sell upon default, the requirements in this Article (Art. 2112)
must be complied with; if the conditions of the sale are set forth
already in the contract, Art. 2112 does not have to be observed.
(See Tan Chun Tic v. West Coast Life Ins. Co., 54 Phil. 361)

(4) Rule Under the Old Law

Article 1859 of the old Civil Code (Art. 2088 of the new
Civil Code) prohibits the creditor from appropriating to himself
the things pledged or mortgaged, and from disposing of them;
but this does not mean that a stipulation is prohibited whereby
the creditor is authorized in case of non-payment within the
term fixed by the parties to sell the thing mortgaged at public
auction, or to adjudicate to himself the same, in case of failure
of said sale, nor is there any reason whatever to prevent it; on
the contrary, Art. 1872 (now Art. 2112 of the new Civil Code)
expressly authorized this procedure in connection with pledge,
even if it may not have been expressly stipulated. (Resol. of
the General Director of Registries of July 12, 1901, 92 Jur.
Civil 1 03) This power to sell does not imply an appropriation
thereof, but is merely a derivative of the authority granted the
contracting parties. This is not against the law, since what
the law prohibits is only the acquisition by the creditor of the
property mortgaged, merely by reason of the non-payment of
the debt, and the above-stated stipulation simply authorizes
him to sell it with the aforesaid conditions, which authorization
is inherent in ownership and is not against morals and public
354

Art 2113

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 2113. At the public auction, the pledgor or owner
may bid. He shall, moreover, have a better right if he should

,

Right of Pledgor and Pledgee to Bid at the Public
Auction
EXAMPLE: A pledged his diamond ring with B. The debt
was not paid on time, and a public auction took place. Can A
bid? Can B bid?
ANS.: Yes, A can bid. Furthermore, he shall have a better
right if he should offer the same terms as the highest bidder.
Reason for the preference: after all, the thing belongs to him.
Yes, B may also bid but his offer shall not be valid if he is the
only bidder.
355

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arts. 2114-2115

Art. 2114. All bids at the public auction shall offer to pay
the purchase price at once. If any other bid is accepted, the
pledgee is deemed to have received the purchase price, as
far as the pledgor or owner is concerned.

COMMENT:
Nature of the Bids at the Public Auction
The bids must be for CASH — for said bids “shall offer
to pay the purchase price AT ONCE.” Even if a purchase on
installment is accepted by the pledgee, the sale is still for
cash— insofar as the pledgor or owner is concerned?
Art 2115. The sale of the thing pledged shall extinguish
the principal obligation, whether or not the proceeds of the
sale are equal to the amount of the principal obligation,
interest and expenses in a proper case. If the price of the sale
is more than said amount, the debtor shall not be entitled
to the excess, unless it is otherwise agreed. If the price
of the sale is less, neither shall the creditor be entitled to
recover the deficiency, notwithstanding any stipulation to

the contrary.

COMMENT:
Rules if the Price At the Sale is More or Less Than the
Debt
excess goes to the creditor,
(a) If the price at sale is MORE
unless the contrary is provided. (This is rather unfair,
because the pledgor is the OWNER.)
(b) If the price is LESS
creditor does NOT get the
deficiency. A contrary stipulation is VOID.

FACTS: A debtor pledged to his surety piece jewelry to
indemnify the latter in case it (the surety) would be obliged to

(1) “Real Mortgage” Defined

It is a contract in which the debtor guarantees to the
creditor the fulfillment of a principal obligation, subjecting
for the faithful compliance therewith a real property in case
of non-fulfillment of said obligation at the time stipulated. (12
Manresa, p. 460)
(2) Etymological Definition

Mortgage is derived from two French words, “mart" and
"gage." These are equivalent to the Latin terms mortuum
uadium. The word “mort” means “dead”, and the term “gage”
means “pledge.” Thus, literally, a mortgage is a dead or
unproductive pledge. (Sturpe u. Kopp, 201, No. 412, 99 S.W.

and such other loans or other advances already obtained or

HELD: Mortgages given to secure future advancements are
valid and legal contracts. The amounts named as consideration
in said contract do not limit the amount for which the mortgage
may stand as security if from the four corners of the instrument
the intent to secure future and other indebtedness can be
gathered. Where the annotation on the back of a certificate of
title about a first mortgage states “that the mortgage secured
the payment of a certain sum of money plus interest plus
other obligations arising thereunder” there is no necessity for
any notation of the later loans on the mortgagors’ title. It is
incumbent upon any subsequent mortgagee or encumbrancee
of the property in question to examine the books and records

A mortgagee usually does NOT possess the land mortgaged;
however, even if he does possess it, say, by agreement, he
cannot acquire the property by prescription, for his possession
is not in the concept of an owner. (Daoare v. Aglutay, et al., CA,
L-16114-R, Oct. 20, 1956) And even if the obligation is not paid
at maturity, the mortgagee cannot appropriate the property
for himself. Any stipulation to the contrary is prohibited. (Rosa
Naval, et al. v. Genaro Homeres, CA, L-19482-R, May 30, 1959)

Prudencio v. Court of Appeals
GR 34539, July 14, 1986
The mortgage cannot be separated from the promissory
note for it is the latter which is the basis of determining whether
the mortgage should be cancelled. Without the promissory note
which determines the amount of indebtedness, there would be
no basis for the mortgage.
Prudential Bank v. Panis
GR 50008, Aug. 31, 1987

FACTS: In 1971, FAM secured a loan from BANK To
secure its payment, FAM executed in favor of BANK a real
estate mortgage over a two-storey, semi-concrete building. The
property conveyed by way of mortgage includes the right of
occupancy on the lot where the mortgaged building is erected.
The BANK knew that FAM had already filed a sales application
patent over the lot. The mortgage was registered under the
provision of Act 3344. In May, 1973, FAM secured an additional
loan from BANK To secure its payment, FAM executed in
favor of the BANK another deed of real estate mortgage over
366

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2124

the same properties previously mortgaged. In April 1973, the
Secretary of Agriculture issued the same patent over the land,
the possessory rights over which were mortgaged to BANK.
When FAM failed to pay the debt, the deeds of mortgage were
foreclosed extrajudicially. The BANK bought the property as
the highest bidder. The trial court declared as void the deeds of
real estate mortgage in favor of BANK.
ISSUE: May a valid real estate mortgage be constituted
on the building erected on the land belonging to another?
HELD: On petition for certiorari, the Supreme Court
modified the trial court’s judgment by declaring the mortgage
for the first loan valid, but ruling that the mortgage for the
additional loan void, without prejudice to any appropriate
action, the Government may take against FAM. While it is
true that mortgage of land necessarily includes, in the absence
of stipulation of the improvements thereon, buildings, still a
building by itself may be mortgaged apart from the land on
which it has been built. Such a mortgage would still be a real
estate mortgage, for the building would still be considered
immovable property even if dealt with separately and apart
from the land. In the same manner, possessory rights over said
properties before title is vested on the grantee, may be validly
transferred or conveyed as in a deed of mortgage.
The original mortgage was executed before the issuance
of the final patent and before the government was divested of
its title to the land, an event which takes effect only on the
issuance of the sales patent and its subsequent registration
in the Office of the Register of Deeds. Hence, the mortgage
executed by FAM on his own building erected on the land
belonging to the government is to all intents and purposes
a valid mortgage. The restrictions expressly mentioned on
FAM’S title (Secs. 121, 122 and 124, Public Land Act) refer
to land already acquired under the Public Land Act, or any
improvement thereon. Hence, they have no application to the
assailed mortgage which was executed before such eventuality.
Likewise, Sec. 2 of RA 730, also a restriction appearing on the
face of FAM’s title has no application, despite its reference
to encumbrance or alienation before the patent is issued
because it refers specifically to encumbrance or alienation on
the land itself and does not mention anything regarding the
366

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2124

improvements existing thereof. But it is a different matter,
as regards the second mortgage for additional loan, which
mortgage was executed after the issuance of the sales patent
and of the original certificate of title. This falls squarely under
the prohibitions stated in Secs. 121, 122 and 124 of the Public
Land Act and Sec. 2 of RA 730, and is, therefore, void.

Pari delicto may not be invoked to defeat the policy of
the State. Neither may the doctrine of estoppel validate a void
contract. As between parties to a contract, validity cannot be
given to it by estoppel if it is prohibited by law or is against
public policy. No citizen is competent to barter away what
public policy by law seeks to preserve. This pronouncement
covers only the previous transaction already alluded to and
does not pass upon any new contract between the parties. It
should not preclude new contracts that may be entered into
between BANK and FAM that are in accordance with the
requirements of law. But any new transaction would be subject
to whatever steps the government may take for the reversion
of the land in its favor.
Serfino v. Court of Appeals
GR 40868, Sept 15, 1987

FACTS: A parcel of land patented in the name of
Casamayor was sold for Nemesia Baltazar. Nemesia sold the
same lot to Lopez Sugar Central. In 1956, the land was sold at
public auction by the Provincial Treasurer for tax delinquency.
Notice of the public auction was sent to Casamayor but none
to Nemesia or the Lopez Sugar Central. The land was sold to
Serfino as the highest bidder. After the transfer certificate
of title had been issued in the name of Serfino, he declared
the property in his name, continuously paid the taxes and
introduced improvements thereon. Under these circumstances,
the PNB extended a loan to Serfino secured by the land in
question on the strength of the title in the name of Serfino
and after a spot investigation by one of the fact inspectors who
made a report of his investigation. After the execution of a real
estate mortgage in favor of the PNB duly annotated on Serfino’s
certificate of title, the bank loaned Serfino P5,000. The Bank
relied on the certificate of title, the genuineness of which is not
in issue.
367

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2124

In a suit filed by the Lopez Sugar Central, the trial court
declared the tax sale void for lack of notice of the same to the
actual owner, and ordered the cancellation of Serfino s title, but
declared the mortgage valid and ordered Lopez Sugar Central
to pay the PNB the amount secured by the mortgage. The Court
of Appeals modified the judgment by nullifying the mortgage
in favor of the PNB and exempted Lopez Sugar Central from
paying the PNB, the amount of the mortgage loan.

HELD: The mortgagee bank had every right to rely on
the transfer certificate of title as it was a sufficient evidence
of ownership of the mortgagor. At the time the mortgage was
executed, it has no way of knowing the existence of another
genuine title covering the same land in question. The fact that
the public auction sale of the disputed property was not valid
(for lack of notice of the auction sale to the actual owner) cannot
in any way be attributed to the mortgagee’s (PNB’s) fault. The
PNB is entitled to the payment of the mortgage loan.
Danao v. Court of Appeals
GR 48276, Sept. 30, 1987
For non-payment of a note secured by mortgage, the
creditor has a single cause of action against the debtor. This
single cause of action consists in the recovery of the credit with
execution of the security. The creditor in his action may make
two demands, the payment of the debt and the foreclosure of
the mortgage. But both demands arise from the same cause, the
non-payment of the debt and for that reason, they constitute
a single cause of action. Though the debt and the mortgage
constitute separate agreements, the latter is subsidiary to the
former and both refer to one and the same obligation.
A mortgage creditor may elect to waive his security and
bring, instead, an ordinary action to recover the indebtedness
with the right to execute a judgment on all the properties of the
debtor, including the subject matter of the mortgage, subject to
the qualification that if he fails in the remedy by him elected,
he cannot pursue further the remedy he has waived. He may
institute against the mortgage debtor a personal action for
debt or a real action to foreclose the mortgage. He may pursue
either of the two remedies, but not both.

Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals,
Sps. Antonio So Hu and Soledad del Rosario and
Sps. Mateo Cruz and Carlita Ronquillo
GR 126908, Jan. 16, 2003

FACTS: PNB’s application for foreclosure, filed on July
15, 1985, was based on the Spouses Cruz’s third mortgage
deed. However, Spouses So Hu had already paid on March 18,
1983 the principal obligation secured by the third mortgage.

HELD: Foreclosure is only valid where the debtor is in
default in the payment of his obligation. In the instant case,
PNB foreclosed the third mortgage even when the obligation,
the Third Loan, secured by the mortgage has been completely
paid prior to the foreclosure.
Obviously, the property could no longer be foreclosed to
satisfy an extinguished obligation. Since the full amount of the
Third Loan was paid as early as March 18, 1983, extinguishing
the loan obligation under the principal contract, the mortgage
obligation under the accessory contract has likewise been
extinguished.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2124

As part of said proceedings, petitioners filed with the
Pasay RTC a petition for issuance of an arrest order against the
vessel. At the same time, crew members, herein respondents,
filed a case against the vessel for collection of their unpaid
wages, overtime pay, allowances, and other benefits due them
with the Manila RTC. Both trial courts (Pasay and Manila)
issued warrants against the vessel.
Petitioners subsequently filed a motion to intervene
with the Manila RTC solely for the purpose of opposing the
claim of crew members. Petitioners averred that by reason of
their mortgage lien, they are so situated as to be adversely
affected by the collection case. Notwithstanding respondents’
opposition, the motion was granted.

Requirements for intervention are the following:

1.

It must be shown that movant has legal interest in the
matter of litigation. Interest which entitles a person to
intervene in a suit between other parties must be in the
matter of litigation and of such direct and immediate
character that intervenor will either gain or lose by direct
legal operation and effect of judgment. Otherwise, if
persons not parties to the action were allowed to intervene,
proceedings would become unnecessarily complicated,
expressive, and interminable and this would be against
the policy of the law. The words, “an interest in the
subject,” mean a direct interest in the cause of action
as pleaded, one that would put intervenor in a legal
position to litigate a fact alleged in the complaint without
establishment of which plaintiff could not recover.

(24) An Obligation Is Not Secured By a Mortgage

Paradigm Development Corp, of the Phil. v. BPI
826 SCRA 267
(2017)
•

Unless it comes fairly within the terms of the mortgage
contract, an obligation is not secured by a mortgage.

It is well-settled that while a real estate mortgage may
exceptionally secure future loans or advancements, these future
debts must be specifically described in the mortgage contract.

Art. 2125. In addition to the requisites stated in Article
2085, it is indispensable, in order that a mortgage may be
validly constituted, that the document in which it appears

be recorded in the Registry of Property. If the instrument is
not recorded, the mortgage is nevertheless binding between
the parties.

372

•

Under Art. 1875 of the old Civil Code, an unrecorded
mortgage was not effective, valid, and binding even
between the contracting parties themselves. (Art.
1875, old Civil Code; Julian v. Lutero, 49 Phil. 703)
But an unrecorded mortgage on land, which were
not registered either under the Torrens system
or under the Spanish Mortgage Law, was valid,
binding, and effective between the parties. (Matute
v. Banzali, 62 Phil. 256) Under the new Civil Code,
however, even if the mortgage is not recorded, the
mortgage, whether land is registered under the
Torrens System, Spanish Mortgage Law, or not at
all registered is nevertheless binding between the
parties. (Art. 2125, new Civil Code)
Reyes v. De Leon
GR 22331, June 6, 1967

FACTS: The owner of a house sold it a retro
at a very low price with the stipulation that if not
paid or redeemed at the time stipulated, the right
to redeem would be forfeited and ownership would
automatically pass to the buyer. The period was later
extended. During this period, the owner mortgaged

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 2126

the property to another person. This mortgagee
recorded the mortgage under Act 3344. The buyer
a retro brought this action for consolidation of the
a retro transaction. But the mortgagee intervened
stating that his right should prevail.
HELD: The intervenor should prevail. The
first transaction is actually an equitable mortgage
in view of the grossly inadequate price and the
pactum commissorium (as the automatic transfer
of ownership). As between the two mortgages, the
latter one should prevail, for it was recorded, while
the equitable mortgage was not. Be it noted that the
second mortgagee was a mortgagee in good faith.

(4) Rule in Case of Legal Mortgages

In case of legal mortgages (where the law establishes a
mortgage in favor of certain persons) the persons entitled have
no other right than to demand the execution and the recording
of the document in which the mortgage is formalized. This is
in conformity with the rule established under the law on Form
of Contracts which reads: “If the law requires a document of
some other special form, the contracting parties may compel
each other to observe that form, once the contract had been
perfected. This right when exercised simultaneously with the
action upon the contract is valid and enforceable.”
(6) Effect of Registration

Tan v. Valdehueza
L-38745, Aug. 5, 1976

Even if not registered in the Registry of
Property, a mortgage is valid between the parties
and the mortgagee has the right to foreclose the
mortgage, as long as no innocent third parties are
involved.
(2) Comment of the Code Commission

“An additional provision is made that if the instrument of
mortgage is not recorded, the mortgage is nevertheless binding
between the parties.” (Report of the Code Commission, p. 159)
(3) Effect of a Signed Mortgage

Once a mortgage has been signed in due form, the
mortgagee is entitled to its registration as a matter of right.
By executing the mortgage, the mortgagor is understood to
have given his consent to its registration, and he cannot be
permitted to revoke it unilaterally. The validity and fulfillment
of contracts cannot be left to the will of one of the contracting
parties. (Gonzales v. Basa, et al., 73 Phil. 704) And the legal
presumption of sufficient cause or consideration supporting

a contract, even if such cause is not stated therein, cannot
be overcome by a simple assertion of lack of consideration.
(Samanilla v. Cqjucom, et al., L-13683, March 31, 1960)
374

Art. 2126

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

.

A mortgage, whether registered or not is binding between
the parties, registration being necessary only to make the same
valid against third persons. In other words, registration only
operates as a notice of the mortgage to others, but neither adds
to its validity nor converts an invalid mortgage into a valid one
between the parties. If the purpose of registration is merely
to give notice, the question regarding the effect or invalidity
of instrument are expected to be decided AFTER, not before
registration. It must follow as a necessary consequence that
registration must first be allowed and the validity or the effect
litigated afterwards. (Samanilla v. Cajucom, et al., L-13683,
March 31, 1960)

Art. 2126. The mortgage directly and immediately
subjects the property upon which it is imposed, whoever
the possessor may be to the fulfillment of the obligation for
whose security it was constituted.

COMMENT:
(1) Meaning of Property Being Subjected to the Mortgage

The Article simply means that a mortgage is a real right
following the property. Therefore, if a mortgagor sells the
property, the buyer must respect the mortgage (if registered,
or if he knows of its existence).
376

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2127

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(2) Non-responsibility of Buyer for the Deficiency

If in the above example, the creditor forecloses the
mortgage, the buyer will not be responsible for the deficiency,
if any, for the encumbrance is only on the property itself. The
exception of course would be in the case of novation, where
all the parties consent to the buyer’s assumption of personal
liability. (See McCullough and Co., Inc. v. Veloso and Sema, 46
Phil. 1)

If the mortgage be replaced by a surety bond, the lien
would be converted into a right in personam. Naturally, the
mortgagee’s rights under the mortgage would be diminished.

Article 2126 applies even if the mortgagor is NOT the
principal debtor. (He, for example, mortgaged the property to
guarantee another’s debt.) (Lack v. Alonzo, 14 Phil. 630)

i

A mortgage on the land includes present and future
houses thereon, unless the houses are exempted by express

(2) Some Doctrines

(4) Transfer of Property to Another

•

If a mortgagor, without the creditor’s consent, transfers
the property and the debt to another, the mortgagor would still
be personally liable, for the attempted novation here would not
be valid in view of the lack of consent on the part of the creditor.
On the other hand, the mortgage on the property can still be
foreclosed upon, in view of the real nature of a mortgage. (See
Angelo v. Dir. of Lands, 49 Phil. 838 and Me Cullough & Co.,
Inc. v. Veloso & Serna, 46 Phil. 1)

Art. 2127

(a)

“Growing fruits” naturally should exclude those already
harvested before the obligation falls due. (See Afable v.

If equipment on a mortgaged land is temporarily removed,
the mortgage continues on said equipment. (Serra v. Natl.
'•
Bank, 45 Phil. 907)
(c) Land, with an old house, was mortgaged. Later, the
house was replaced by a new and more expensive one. In
' the absence of a contrary stipulation, the new house is
bn
covered by the mortgage. (Phil. Sugar Estate Dev. Co. v.
Campos, 36 Phil. 85)
(d) Under the old Code, a mortgage lien on the fruits of the
land may be defeated by the superior lien given to the
person who advanced credit for the seeds and expenses
of cultivation and harvesting. (Par. 11, Art. 2241; Serra
v. Natl. Bank, 45 Phil. 907) It would seem, however,

P100,000. Marcial then sold the land to Alfredo. When the debt
falls due, Rodrigo may demand payment from Marcial; and if
Marcial fails to pay, Rodrigo may now demand from Alfredo.
If Alfredo does not pay, the mortgage may be foreclosed. Of
course, if there is a deficiency, Alfredo cannot be held liable for
such deficiency, in the absence of a contrary stipulation. (See

(1) What Special Laws Govern

The Article explains itself.

(4) Stipulation Requiring Prior Consent of Mortgagee

A stipulation wherein the mortgagor is required to get
the consent of the mortgagee before subsequently mortgaging
the property is valid and binding when the land is registered
under the Torrens system. But if the property was originally
registered under the Spanish Mortgage Law, then such
a stipulation is not valid and may be disregarded by the
mortgagor. (Philippine Industrial Co. v. El Hogar Filipino, 43

Phil. 336)
Bonnevie v. Court of Appeals
GR 49101, Oct 24, 1983
FACTS: A mortgagor sold his mortgaged lot to a buyer
without the consent of the mortgagee (the contract required
said consent). The buyer assumed the mortgage, also without
the mortgagee’s knowledge and consent. If later, both the
mortgagor and the buyer offer to redeem the property by
paying the debt, whose offer must the mortgagee accept?

HELD: The offer of the mortgagor, not the offer of the
buyer whose purchase and whose assumption of mortgage had
not been authorized by the mortgagee.
(5) Second Mortgage

If the making of a second mortgage, except with the
written consent of the mortgagee is prohibited, and the contract
states the penalty for such a violation, namely, “the violation
gives the mortgagee the right to immediately foreclose the
mortgage,” the violation does not give the first mortgagee the
right to treat the second mortgage as null and void. (Sim Janco
v. Bank of the Phil.)

(2) Upset Price

A stipulation in a contract which fixes a tipo or upset price,
at which the property will be sold at a foreclosure proceedings
is null and void. This stipulation violates Sec. 3, Rule 70 of the
Rules of Court (now Rule 68) which provides that the property
mortgaged should be sold to the highest bidder. Hence, even
if the contract contains such a stipulation, the sale of the
property must take place, and the property should be awarded
to the highest bidder. (Bank of the Philippines v. Yulo, 31 Phil.
472)

(3) Insurance

The mortgagee and the mortgagor both have insurable
interest in the property, and therefore they may insure the
same. (See San Miguel Brewery v. Law Union & Rock Ins. Co.,
40 Phil. 647)
(4) “Equity of Redemption” Distinguished from “Right of

Redemption”
(a) Equity of redemption
This is the right of the mortgagor
to redeem the mortgaged property after his default in the
performance of the conditions of the mortgage but before
the sale of the mortgaged property.

may exercise his equity of redemption at any time before
the judicial sale is confirmed by the court. [Raymundo v.
Sunico, 25 Phil. 365])

Right of redemption This is the right of the mortgagor
to purchase the property within a certain period after it
was sold for the purpose of paying the mortgage debt.

IFC Service Leasing and Acceptance
Corporation v. Venancio Nera
L-21720, Jan. 30, 1967

FACTS: A mortgagee (the IFC Service Leasing and
Acceptance Corporation) filed with the Sheriffs office a
verified petition for the extrajudicial foreclosure of the
mortgage. On Oct. 27, 1961, after notice and publication,
the property (consisting of a house and lot) was sold to
the Corporation as highest bidder (for P28.451.77.) One
year later (Oct. 27, 1962), the period of redemption having
expired (Oct. 27, 1962), the ownership of the property was
consolidated in the name of the Corporation, to which a
new title (Transfer Certificate of Title 65575) was issued.
If the mortgagee now wants to obtain possession of the
property, does it have to institute a regular action for its
recovery, or is it enough to ask for a writ of possession?

HELD: It is enough to ask for a writ of possession.
Section 35 of Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court
expressly states that “if no redemption be made within
12 months after the sale, the purchaser, or his assignee,
is entitled to a conveyance and possession of the property.
The possession of the property shall be given to the
purchaser or last redemptioner by the same officer unless
a third party is actually holding the property adversely
to the judgment debtor.” In fact, there is no law in this
jurisdiction whereby the purchaser at the sheriffs
sale of real property is obliged to bring a separate and
independent suit for possession after the one-year period
of redemption has expired and after he had obtained the
sheriffs certificate of title. (Tan Soo Huat t». Ongwico, 63

Pedro Dimasacat and Ernesto Robles
v. Court of Appeals, et al.
L-26575, Feb. 27, 1969

FACTS: Rafael O. Lagdameo mortgaged with the
Philippine National Bank contiguous parcels of land with
an approximate area of 7,236 square meters situated in
Quezon Province.
Later, Lagdameo sold to Ernesto Robles 250 square
meters (undivided), and to Pedro Dimasacat, 381 square
meters (also undivided) of the parcels of land involved.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2131

The two sales were not registered. Upon Lagdameo’s
failure to pay, the PNB foreclosed the mortgage. Within
the one-year period of redemption, however, Robles and
Dimasacat wanted to redeem the ENTIRE lot (7,236
square meters) from the Bank, in view of their fear that
Lagdameo had no money with which to effectuate the
redemption. Because of the PNB’s refusal, the two buyers
sued both the PNB and Lagdameo. In the meantime,
Lagdameo was able to redeem the entire lot, without
prejudice however, to the pending suit that had been
brought by the two buyers.

V

ISSUES:
(a)

Could the two buyer (Robles and Dimasacat) redeem
the entire lot?

(b)

Now that Lagdameo has redeemed the property,
what are the rights of Robles and Dimasacat?

HELD:
(a)

The two buyers could redeem only the shares they
had bought from Lagdameo, not the entire lot. (See
in this connection Magno v. Viola, 61 Phil. 80)

(b)

Since Lagdameo has already redeemed the entire
lot (the sales in favor of Robles and Dimasacat), the
three (Lagdameo, Robles, and Dimasacat) should be
considered as CO-OWNERS, to the extent of their
respective shares, without prejudice to the right to
effectuate a physical partition eventually.

FACTS: A mortgage of registered land was
extrajudicially foreclosed on March 10, 1960 when
the property was purchased at the public auction

Development Bank of the Philippines v.
Mirang
L-29130, Aug. 8, 1975
If a mortgagor desires to redeem his property
after the same has been sold at public auction
(extrajudicial foreclosure) he should pay the amount
of the loan at the time such sale was made, and
not just the price at which the property was sold.
This is because, if the property be sold at less than
the amount of the indebtedness, the mortgagee is
entitled to recover the deficiency. Be it noted that a
mortgage is a security, not the satisfaction by itself of
an obligation. What is extinguished by foreclosure is
indeed not the loan (for here, there was only partial
performance), but only the mortgage lien. Thus
under the law, in the absence of a provision in Act
3135 prohibiting recovery of the deficiency after an
extrajudicial foreclosure of a real estate mortgage,
the mortgagee is as of right, entitled to recover the
deficiency.

In Re Petition for the Cancellation of
of Encumbrances Appearing in Transfer

L-27358, Feb. 20, 1981

The CFI (now RTC), acting as a land registration
court, CANNOT in summary proceedings under
Sec. 112 of the Land Registration Law cancel
encumbrances on TCTs (like an attachment lien and
the first mortgage, both of which are alleged to have
prescribed). There should be adversary proceedings
in an ordinary civil action. If in this case there
had previously been such an ordinary civil action,
summary proceedings under Sec. 112 can be allowed.

Act 3135 (re extrajudicial foreclosure of a
mortgage) requires publication of the notice once
a week for three consecutive weeks. This does not
require a period of three full weeks.
Thus, a publication on June 30, July 7, and
July 14 satisfies the requirement although only 14

publication.

Hi-Yield Realty, Inc. v.
Court of Appeals, etc.
GR 138978, Sept. 12, 2002
FACTS: In compliance with an order, petitioner
submitted to the trial court a detailed computation
of the total redemption price as of March 17, 1994.
Private respondent received his copy on March 24,
1994 and, therefore, had until April 8, 1994 to pay
the redemption price in full. He, however, failed to
pay it by that date. Instead, on April 8, 1994, private
respondent filed an “Urgent Motion for Extension of
Time” with the trial court asking for an extra time
of 45 days within which to pay the redemption price.
He reasoned out that his debtor to augment his cash
on hand and that he was then waiting for a bank
loan for P150,000. Private respondent simply did
not have sufficient money to tender; he experienced
difficulty in raising the money to redeem the
foreclosed property.

.,

ISSUE: Is financial hardship a ground to
extend the period of redemption?

HELD: No. While respondent may have elicited
the sympathy of the trial court, the Supreme Court,
on its part, ruled that it cannot, however, be blind to
the rights of petitioner. For it was serious error to
make the final redemption of the foreclosed property
dependent on the financial condition of private
respondent.
After all, the opportunity to redeem the subject
property was never denied to private respondent.
His timely formal offer through judicial action to
redeem was likewise recognized. But that is where
it ends. Every succeeding motion or petition cannot
be sanctioned and granted, especially if frivolous
or unreasonable filed by him because this would
manifestly and unreasonably delay the final
resolution of ownership of the subject property.

—

The Supreme Court said it “cannot be clearer
on this point: as a result of the trial court’s grant
of a 45-day extended period to redeem almost
nine years have elapsed with both parties’ claims
over the property dangling in limbo, to the serious
impairment of petitioner’s rights,” thus, it “cannot
help but call the trial court’s attention to the
prejudice it has unwittingly caused the petitioner. It
was really all too simple. The trial court should have
seen, as, in fact, it had already initially seen, that
the 45-day extension sought by private respondent
on April 8, 1994 was just a play to cover up his lack

of funds to redeem the foreclosed property.”

either judicially or extrajudicially is governed by special laws
which provide for payment of all amount owed by debtor. This
special protection given to DBP is not accorded to judgment
creditors in ordinary civil actions.
ISSUES: (1) How much should a mortgagor pay to redeem
a real property mortgaged to and subsequently foreclosed by
DBP?; and (2) Must he pay the bank the entire amount he owed
the latter on date of sale with interest on total indebtedness at
agreed rate on the obligation, or is it enough for purposes of
redemption that he reimburse the amount of purchase with 1%
monthly interest thereon, including other expenses defrayed
by purchases at the extrajudicial sale?

HELD: (1) Where real property is mortgaged to and
foreclosed judicially or extrajudicially by DBP, the right of
redemption may be exercised only by paying to DBP all the
amount owed by borrower on date of sale, with interest on
total indebtedness at rate agreed upon in the obligation from
said date unless bidder has taken material possession of the
property or unless this has been delivered to him, in which
case proceeds of the property shall compensate interest. This
rule applies whether the foreclosed property is sold to DBP
or another person at public auction, provided, of course, the
property was mortgaged to DBP.
(2) Where property is sold to persons other than
mortgagee, the procedure is for DBP in case of redemption to
return to bidder the amount it received from him as a result of
the auction sale with corresponding interest by the debtor.
The foregoing rule is embodied consistently in the charter
of DBP (RA 2081) and its predecessor agencies — Agricultural
and Industrial Bank (AIB) (RA 459) and Rehabilitation Finance
Corp. (RFC) (RA 85).

Chapter 4

ANTICHRESIS
Art. 2132. By the contract of antichresis the creditor
acquires the right to receive the fruits of an immovable of
his debtor, with the obligation to apply them to the payment
of the interest, if owing, and thereafter to the principal of
his credit.

COMMENT:

(1) “Antichresis” Defined

(2) Characteristics

(a)

i

Antichresis is an accessory contract and gives a real right.

(Santa Rosa v. Noble, 35 O.G. 2724)

(b)

It is a formal contract because it must be in writing',
otherwise, it is VOID. (Art. 2134)

(3) Distinguished from “Pledge” and “Mortgage”
(a)
u

It differs from a pledge because the latter refers only to
personal property, whereas antichresis deals only with

immovable property.
(b) It differs from mortgage because in the latter, there is NO
RIGHT to the FRUITS.
(NOTE: While the creditor in antichresis is entitled
to the fruits, still the fruits must be applied to the interest,
if owing. [Art. 2132J)
'■

388

(NOTE: In both antichresis and mortgage, the
property may or may not be delivered to the creditor.
In general, however, in mortgage, the property is NOT
DELIVERED whereas in antichresis, the property is
DELIVERED.)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2132

(4) Problem

A borrower obtained a loan, and delivered the property as
security so that the creditor may use the fruits. But no interest
was mentioned; and it was not stated that the fruits would be
applied to the interest first and then to the principal. What
kind of a contract is this?

ANS.: This is a real mortgage, not an antichresis. (Salcedo
v. CelestUa, 66 Phil. 372) What characterizes a contract of
antichresis is that the creditor acquires the right to receive
the fruits of the property of his debtor, with the obligation to
apply them to the payment of interest, if any is due, and then
to the principal of his credit and when such a covenant is not
made in the contract, the contract cannot be an antichresis.
(Alojada v. Lim Siongco, 51 Phil. 339; see Adrid, et al. v.
Morga, et al., L-13299, July 25, 1960, where the Court held
that the mere taking of land products in lieu of the receipt of
interest originally stipulated upon does not necessarily convert
the contract into one of an antichresis in view of the lack of
provision in the contract specifically authorizing the receipt of
the fruits.)

law. (Santa Rosa v. Noble, 35 O.G. 2724; see Art. 2138)

interest shall be specified in writing; otherwise, the contract

i

'■>

The claim that an instrument of antichresis had been
executed by the parties’ predecessors-in-interest in the
latter part of 1930, based on testimonial evidence, cannot be
considered legally sufficient. On or about 1930, an express
contract of antichresis would have been unusual.

Ramirez v. Court of Appeals
GR 38185, Sept 24, 1986

An antichretic creditor cannot acquire by prescription the
land surrendered to him by the debtor. The creditor is not a
possessor in the concept of owner but a mere holder placed in
possession of the land by the owner. Hence, their possession
cannot serve as a title for acquiring dominion
390

The amount of the PRINCIPAL and the INTEREST must
be in WRITING. This is mandatory, therefore, if not in writing,
the contract of antichresis is VOID.
(2) Principal Obligation

Even if the antichresis is VOID, the principal obligation
may still be VALID.

Art. 2135. The creditor, unless there is a stipulation to
the contrary, is obliged to pay the taxes the charges upon
the estate.

He is also bound to bear the expenses necessary for the

If the creditor does not pay the taxes, the debtor is

(3) Rule if the Fruit are Insufficient

Since the first paragraph provides for responsibility on
the part of the creditor, it follows that he has to pay for the
taxes and charges, even if the fruits be insufficient. This duty is
implied also from the second paragraph of Art. 2136. However,
insofar as they can be deducted from the fruits, it is as if the
debtor is really paying for such taxes and necessary repairs.
Art. 2136. The debtor cannot reacquire the enjoyment
of the immovable without first having totally paid what he

contrary.

An antichretic creditor is entitled to be reimbursed for his
expenses for machinery and other improvements on the land,
and for the sums paid as land taxes. (Magdangal v. Lichauco,

fruits.
Art. 2137. The creditor does not acquire the ownership
of the real estate for non-payment of the debt within the
period agreed upon.
Every stipulation to the contrary shall be void. But the
creditor may petition the court for the payment of the debt

the interest upon the debt be compensated with the fruits of
the property which is the object of the antichresis, provided
that if the value of the fruits should exceed the amount of

1)
That they be constituted to secure the fulfillment of
the principal obligation;
2)
That the pledgor or mortgagor be the absolute owner

not affected by the fact that the debtors are not solidarity
liable.

(d)

Article 2091. The contract of pledge or mortgage may
secure all kinds of obligations, be they pure or subject to a
suspensive or resolutory condition.

Third persons who are not parties to the
principal obligation may secure the latter by
pledging or mortgaging their own property.
(b)

Article 2089. A pledge or mortgage is indivisible, even
though the debt may be divided among the successors in
interest of the debtor of the creditor.
Therefore, the debtor’s heir who has paid a part of
the debt cannot ask for the proportionate extinguishments
of the pledge or mortgage as long as the debt is not
completely satisfied.

Neither can the creditor’s heir who received his share
of the debt return the pledge or cancel the mortgage, to
the prejudice of the other heirs who have not been paid.

From these, provisions is excepted the case in which,
there being several things given in mortgage or pledge
each one of them guarantees only a determinate portion
of the credit.
The debtor, in this case, shall have a right to the
extinguishment of the pledge or mortgage as the portion

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
(b) Validity as against Third Persons:

Chapter 5

„

CHATTEL MORTGAGE
Art. 2140. By a chattel mortgage, personal property is
recorded in the Chattel Mortgage Register as a security for
the performance of an obligation. If the movable, instead of
being recorded, is delivered to the creditor or a third person,
the contract is a pledge and not a chattel mortgage.

COMMENT:
(1) Requisites for the Form of a Chattel Mortgage
(a) Validity between the Parties:
The personal property must be RECORDED or
REGISTERED in the Chattel Mortgage Register. (Art.
2140)
(NOTE: Registration in the Day

Book is NOT
enough; it must be in the Chattel Mortgage Register. (See
Associated Insurance and Surety Co., Inc. v. Lim Ang, et
al. [CA.] 52 O.G. 5218; BUT SEE ALSO Salcedo v. Lim
Ang, et al., 54 O.G. 5153])
(NOTE: To be valid between the parties, is recording
or registration in the Chattel Mortgage Register required?
According to one school of thought, YES, because of the

wording of Art. 2140; according to another school, NO, for
after all Sec. 4 of the Chattel Mortgage Law states that the
recording or registration is only for effectivity as against
third persons, and there is nothing incompatible between
this Sec. 4 and Art. 2140; UNLESS the latter [Art. 2140]
will be regarded as a DEFINITION. [See Standard Oil
Co. v. Jaramillo, 44 Phil. 630] The author is inclined to
answer that the registration is required even for validity
between the parties because of the express wording of Art.
2140 and because such article may be regarded as the
DEFINITION of a Chattel Mortgage.)
396

The same as (a). Moreover, the registration must
be accompanied by an affidavit of good faith. [Secs. 4
and 5, Chattel Mortgage Law, Act No. 5108] A mortgage
constituted on a car, in order to affect third persons
should be registered not only in the Chattel Mortgage
Registry but also in the Motor Vehicles Office as required
by Sec. 5(e) of the Revised Motor Vehicles Law. (Borlough
v. Fortune Enterprises, Inc., L-9451, March 29, 1957 and
Aleman, et al. u. De Catera, et al., L-13693-94, March
5, 1961) Thus, as between a chattel mortgagee, whose
mortgage is not recorded in the MVO, and an innocent
purchaser for value of a car who registers the car in his
name, it is obvious that the latter is entitled to preference.
(Montano v. Lim Ang, L- 13057, Feb. 27, 1963)
(2) Definition

A chattel mortgage is an accessory contract by virtue of
which personal property is recorded in the Chattel Mortgage
Register as a security for the performance of an obligation.
(Art. 2140)
(NOTE: Under the old law, it was considered a conditional
sale. The Code Commission considered the old definition
defective. [Report of the Code Commission, p. 158])

(3) When Mortgage Must Be Registered in Two Registries

If under the Chattel Mortgage Law, the mortgage must
be registered in two registries (as when the mortgagor resides
in one province, but the property is in another), the registration
must be in BOTH; otherwise, the chattel mortgage is VOID.
(See Malonzo v. Luneta Motor Co., et al., CA., 52 O.G. 5566)
(4) House as the Subject Matter of a Chattel Mortgage

May a house constructed on rented land be the subject of
a chattel mortgage? State your reasons. (BAR)

ANS.: Generally no, because the house is real property.
(Art. 415, Civil Code and Leung Yee v. Strong Machinery Co.,
37 Phil. 644) This is so even if the house belongs to a person

other than the owner of the land.
397

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2140

However, in the following instances there may be such a
chattel mortgage:
(a)

If the parties to the contract agree and no third persons
are prejudiced. (Evangelista v. Abad, [CA.] 36 O.G. 291;
Tomines v. San Juan, [CA.] 45 O.G. 2935) This is really
because one who has so agreed is ESTOPPED from
denying the existence of the chattel mortgage.
(NOTE: Insofar as third persons are concerned,
the chattel mortgage on the building even if registered is
VOID. [Leung Yee v. Strong Machinery Co., 37 Phil. 644;
Evangelista v. Alto Surety and Ins. Co., Inc., L-11139,

April 23, 1958])
(b)

If what is mortgaged is a house intended to be demolished
or removed for here, what are really mortgaged are the
MATERIALS thereof, hence, mere personal property. (3
Manresa, p. 19)

Navarro v. Pineda
L-18456, Nov. 30, 1963

FACTS: Pineda executed a chattel mortgage on his
two-storey residential house erected on a lot belonging to
another, to secure an indebtedness. The debt was not paid
on the date due, hence, the plaintiff sought to foreclose the
chattel mortgage on the house. Pineda argued however
that since only movables can be the subject of a chattel
mortgage (Sec. 1, Act 3952), the mortgage in question,
which is the basis of the present action, cannot give rise to
an action for foreclosure, because it is a nullity. He cited
Art. 416, which classifies a house as immovable property
whether the owner of the land is or is not the owner of
the building. He further invoked the ruling in the case
of Lopez v. Oroza (L-10817-8, Feb. 8, 1958) which held
that “a building is an immovable property, irrespective of
whether or not said structure and the land on which it is
adhered to belong to the same owner.” (See Leung Yee v.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2140

as to them, the chattel mortgage is VALID. Besides, the
Court, speaking of the size of the house said, “The house
was small and made of light material, sawali, and wooden
posts; and built on the land of another.”
(NOTE: The Court distinguished this case from
previous ones. In the lya case [Associated Insurance
v. lya, L-10837, May 30, 1958], the Court said that the
house was built of strong materials, permanently adhered
on the owner’s own land. In the Lopez case, the building
was a theater. In said cases, third persons assailed the
validity of the mortgage; in this Navarro case, it was a
party attacking it.)
(6) If Executed by a Wife

If the wife alone, without the prior consent or authority
of the husband, enters into a contract of chattel mortgage
respecting conjugal property, said contract is of doubtful
validity. (Serra v. Rodriguez, 56 SCRA 538)
(6) Cases

Servicewide Specialists, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
70 SCAD 529, 256 SCRA 649
(1996)

Where the Chattel Mortgage does not authorize the
mortgagee to apply previous payments for the car to the
insurance, the mortgagee has to send notice to the mortgagor
[if it] decides to convert any of the installments made by the

latter for the renewal of the insurance.

FACTS: DBP complied with the mandatory posting of the
notices of the auction sale of the personal properties. There was
no postponement of the auction sale of the personal properties
and the foreclosure took place as scheduled.

property by the parties to the contract themselves. Hence,

(7) Evidence of Indebtedness

Capulong v. People
818 SCRA619
(2017)

ISSUES: (1) In a chattel mortgage of a vehicle, why should
the so-called “Official Receipt and Certificate of Registration
(OR-CR) be considered as evidence of indebtedness; and (2)
In case of default in payment, why should the mortgaged
property be sold at public auction?
HELD: (1) This is because the OR-CR serves as part and
parcel of the entire mortgage documents, without which the
mortgage’s right to foreclose cannot be effectively enforced.
The reason is for its proceeds to be able to satisfy
inter alia, the payment of the obligation secured by the
mortgage.
(2)

Art. 2141. The provisions of this Code on pledge, insofar
as they are not in conflict with the Chattel Mortgage Law,
shall be applicable to chattel mortgages.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 2141

ANS.:
(a)

Generally, YES, the mortgagee is entitled to recover the
deficiency from the mortgagor.

REASON: Although the Chattel Mortgage Law
contains no provision on this point, still previous court
decision have held that there can be a recovery. The
Chattel Mortgage Law therefore read in the light of these
decisions, allows such a recovery. Therefore, the new Civil
Code provisions on pledge prohibiting recovery do NOT
apply. (Ablaza v. Ignacio, L-11460, May 23, 1958)
(b) An exception to the aforementioned rule may be found
in Art. 1484, which speaks of a chattel mortgage as
security for the purchase of personal property payable in
installments. Here, no deficiency judgment can be asked.
Any agreement to the contrary shall be VOID.
(3) No Registry of Buildings

There is no legal compulsion to register, as notice to third
persons, transactions over buildings that do not belong to the
owners of the lands on which they stand. There is no registry of
buildings in this jurisdiction apart from the land. (Manalansan
v. Manalang, et al., L-13646, July 26, 1960)
(4) No Necessity of Very Detailed Description of the Chattel

Mortgage

Very detailed descriptions of a chattel mortgage are
not required. All that is needed is a description which would

and investigation to identify the property mortgaged. (Saldafia

(5) Ownership of

Redemption
(2) Deficiency Judgments

Where the proceeds from the sale of mortgaged property

the mortgagee entitled to recover the deficiency from the
mortgagor? State the rule, and the exception, if any. (BAR)

Rentals Accrued During Period of
Tumalad v. Vicencio
41 SCRA 143

FACTS: Under Sec. 6 of Act 3135 as amended, after the
auction sale of the property involved in a chattel mortgage,
the debtor-mortgagor has a period of one year within which to
401

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2141

redeem the property sold at the extrajudicial foreclosure sale.
During this period, if the property should produce rentals, who
is entitled to them?
HELD: They should go to the debtor-mortgagor, because
it is the latter who as owner of the property is entitled to said
rents. This is so even if the rentals had been collected by the
purchaser.

(6) Chattel Mortgagee Preferred Over Judgment Creditor
of Mortgagor

Northern Motors, Inc. v. Hon. Jorge Coquia
L-40018, Aug. 29, 1975

"

. J

FACTS: As security for the payment of installments of
a number of taxicabs, the Manila Yellow Taxicab Company
executed chattel mortgages on the vehicles in favor of the
seller, Northern Motors. In the meantime, a judgment creditor
(the Tropical Commercial Co.) of the taxicab company was able
through the sheriff to levy on the vehicles. Northern Motors,
being the chattel mortgagee, filed a third-party claim with the
sheriff, alleging it has preferential rights over the vehicles.

—

ISSUE: Who has a preferential lien over the vehicles
the chattel mortgagee or the judgment creditor who has levied
on the cars?

HELD: The chattel mortgagee (Northern Motors) has
the preferential lien. As long as the mortgage debt is not yet
paid, the judgment creditor of the mortgagor can only levy
on the debtor’s equity or right of redemption. Unless the
purchaser at the levy-on-execution sale pays the mortgage
debt, he cannot obtain possession over the properties, nor can
he obtain delivery thereof. The levy by the sheriff is therefore
wrong in taking possession of the vehicles. Because the chattel
mortgages were registered, we can say that the mortgagee
(Northern Motors) has the symbolical possession of the taxes.
Thus, the chattel mortgagee’s lien can be asserted in the same
case where a judgment has been rendered resulting in the levy
of the mortgaged property, instead of ventilating its lien in
an independent action. (Note: The decision of March 21, 1975,
which did not prohibit the sheriff from going ahead with the
execution sale, was reconsidered and set aside.)

(3) Examples of Quasi-Contracts

COMMENT:
(1) Definition of “Quasi-Contracts”

Quasi-contracts are lawful, voluntary, and unilateral acts
which generally require a person to reimburse or compensate
another in accordance with the principle that no one shall be
unjustly enriched or benefited at the expense of another. (See
Art. 2142)
Union Insurance Society of Canton v.
Court of Appeals
73 SCAD 163
(1996)

To order private respondent to pay petitioner the value
of the vessels is one without legal basis and could result in
uiyust enrichment of petitioner. For it is error to make private
respondent pay petitioner the value of three vessels or to order
the return of the vessels to petitioner without the sale first
being rescinded.

(4) Example of a Situation When There is No Quasi-contract
'
>

n

A person who makes constructions on another’s property
by virtue of a contract entered into between him and the lessee
(NOT the lessor-owner) of the property cannot, despite the
lessee’s insolvency, recover the value of said constructions from
the lessor-owner on the ground of “undue enrichment” on the
part of such lessor-owner. This is NOT a quasi-contract. Firstly,
the construction was not a “purely voluntary act” or a “unilateral
act” on the part of the builder, for he had constructed them in
compliance with a bilateral obligation he had undertaken with
the lessee. Secondly, having become privy to the lessee’s rights
under the lease contract, his rights as builder will be governed
by the provisions of said lease contract, under whose terms,
the improvements made on the property would be given to the
lessor. Thirdly, if ever there was enrichment on the part of the
lessor-owner, it was not “undue.” For the builder can blame no
405

Art. 2142

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

one except himself. What he should have done at the beginning
was to obtain a bond from the lessee. He did not. Now that the
lessee cannot pay, he should not be allowed to proceed against
the lessor. (Lao Chit v. Security Bank and Trust Co., et al.,
L-11028, April 17, 1959)
(5) Case Where There was No Unjust Enrichment
,(

Permanent Concrete Products v.
Donato Teodoro, et al.
L-29766, Nov. 29, 1968
FACTS: Clementina Vda. de Guison hired Teodoro and
Associates to construct a building for her for the lump sum
of P44.000. The contractor explicitly agreed in the written
contract between them that “all of the labor and materials
shall be supplied by me.” During the construction, hollow
blocks were supplied by a company, the Permanent Concrete
Products, Inc. When no payment was received, the supplier
sued both Guison (as owner) and Teodoro (as contractor) for
the purchase price. Teodoro alleges, among other things, that
it should be the owner who should pay for the hollow blocks
since the same redounded to her benefit, otherwise she would
be unjustly enriched at the expense of the supplier.
,
ISSUE: Who should pay for the hollow blocks?
HELD: The contractor, Teodoro, must pay for in the
contract he expressly assumed the cost of all materials. While
the owner got the benefit of the hollow blocks, it does not
necessarily follow that she was enriched at the expense of
the Permanent Concrete Products, Inc. After all, she paid the
P44.000 agreed upon as the lump sum.
(6) “Quasi-contract” Included in the
Concept “Implied

Contracts”

Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co.
v. Absolute Mgt. Corp.
688 SCRA 225
The term “implied contracts,” as used in Philippine reme¬
dial law, originated from the common law
where obligations

SOLUTIO INDEBITI

Puyat and Sons v. Sarmiento
L-17447, April 30, 1963

FACTS: Plaintiff held an action for the refund of
retail dealer’s taxes paid by it WITHOUT PROTEST to
the City of Manila. May such a tax (which should not have
been paid at all) be recovered although no protest had
been made?
HELD: Yes. The taxes collected from the plaintiff by
the City of Manila were paid through error or mistake.
This is manifest from the reply of the defendant that the
sales of manufactured products at the factory site are not
taxable either under the Wholesaler’s Ordinance or under
the Retailer’s Ordinance. This makes the act of payment
under the category of solutio indebiti. Being such a case,
protest is not required as a conditio sine qua non for its
application.
(NOTE: Payment by a joint co-debtor for the benefit
of another co-debtor or co-surety is NOT solutio indebiti
but a payment by a person interested in the fulfillment
of the obligation under Art. 1236. [Monte de Piedad v.

Globe Mackay Cable and Radio Corp., et al.
v. NLRC, et al.
GR 74156, June 29, 1988
FACTS: Globe Mackay used to compute and pay its
monthly cost-of-living allowance (COLA) on the basis of 30
days a month ever since the law mandated the payment of
COLA. Upon the effectivity of Wage Order 6, which increased
the COLA by P3 a day, starting Oct. 3, 1984, the company
complied. However, in computing said allowance, management
multiplied the P3 additional COLA by 22 days, which is the
number of working days a month in the company. This was
a departure from the company’s long-standing practice of
multiplying the daily COLA by 30 days.
The union objected to management’s unilateral act of
using this new multiplier as it clearly diminishes the monthly
414

5,

i

Art. 2165

allowance accruing to each employee. It is the union’s position
that what the company did was tantamount to a unilateral
withdrawal of benefits which is supposedly contrary to law.
The union raised this issue in the grievance system. A series of
grievance proceedings proved futile.
The union filed a complaint against the company and
its president and vice-president who were sought to be held
personally liable for alleged illegal deduction, underpayment,
unpaid allowance, supposed violations of Wage Order 6. The
arbiter decided in favor of management, saying there are 22
working days, and “to compel the respondent company to use 30
days in a month to compute the allowance and retain 22 days
for vacation and sick leave, overtime pay and other benefits
is inconsistent and palpably unjust...” The arbiter likewise
held that since the president and vice-president acted in their
corporate capacity, they could not be impleaded, much less
held personally liable.

The union appealed to the National Labor Relations
Commission (NLRC), which reversed the arbiter and ruled
that the company was indeed guilty of illegal deduction based
on the following considerations: First, the NLRC held that the
P3 daily COLA under Wage Order 6 should be computed and
paid based on 30 days instead of 22, since employees paid on
monthly basis are entitled to COLA on Saturdays, Sundays,
and legal holidays “even if unworked.” Second, the NLRC
pointed out that the full allowance enjoyed by the employees
before the CBA constituted a voluntary employer practice
which supposedly cannot be unilaterally withdrawn. Third,
the NLRC deemed it proper that the president and the vicepresident were impleaded.
Management raised the case to the Supreme Court. The
court reversed the NLRC and reinstated the arbiter’s ruling.
The court called attention to the uniform provisions in Wage
Orders 2, 3, 5, and 6 which declared that “all covered employees
shall be entitled to their daily living allowance during the days
that they are paid their basic wage even if unworked.” It was
therefore clarified that “... the payment of COLA is mandated
only for the days that the employees are paid their basic wage*

is evidenced by a promissory note. Jose’s brother, Ricardo,
thinking that it was he who was the true debtor paid the
Pl,000,000 to Liwayway. The latter thinking in good faith that
Ricardo was the true debtor received the Pl,000,000. She then
destroyed the promissory note. If it should turn out later that
the payment by Ricardo was a mistake, is Liwayway obliged to
return the Pl,000,000 to Ricardo?
ANS.: No, she will not be so obliged by express provision
of the instant article. The remedy of Ricardo will be to get
reimbursement from Jose, the true debtor.

Art. 2163. It is presumed that there was a mistake in
the payment if something which had never been due or had
already been paid was delivered; but he from whom the
return is claimed may prove that the delivery was made out
of liberality or for any other just cause.

paid unduly may proceed only against the true debtor or the

BPI’s payment of the proceeds of the subject check was

Such payment on the BPI’s part to respondents was
clearly made by mistake, giving rise to the quasi-contractual

Regardless of its relationship with the doctor, the hospital
may be held directly liable to the patient for its own negligence
or failure to follow established standard of conduct to which it
should conform as a corporation.

While in theory, a hospital as a juridical entity cannot
practice medicine, in reality it utilizes doctors, surgeons,
and medical practitioners in the conduct of its business of

facilitating medical and surgical treatment. Within that
reality, three legal relationships exist:

In the case at bar, the Court still employs the “control test”
to determine theexistence of an employer-employee relationship
between hospital and doctor. Control as a determinative factor
is testing the employer-employee relationship between doctor
and hospital under which the hospital could be held vicariously
liable to a patient in medical negligence cases is a requisite fact
to be established by preponderance of evidence.
Two factors that determine apparent authority, thus:
1. the hospital’s implied manifestations to the patient
which led the latter to conclude that the doctor was
the hospital’s agent; and
2. the patient’s reliance upon the conduct of the
hospital and the doctor, consistent with ordinary

QUASI-DELICTS
Art. 2176. Whoever by act or omission causes damage
to another, there being fault or negligence, is obliged to pay
for the damage done. Such fault or negligence, if there is
no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties, is
railed a quasi-delict and is governed by the provision of this
Chapter.

(d)

(b)

Presence of fault or negligence (lack of due care). (See
Dela Liana v. Biong, 711 SCRA 522)
(NOTE: In the absence of fault or negligence,
there can be NO award for damages. Mere suspicion or
speculation without proof cannot be the basis of such an
award. [Rebullida v. Estrella, CA., L-15256-R, June 24,

Courts distinguish between the active “cause” of the
harm and the existing “conditions” upon which the cause
operated. If the defendant has created only a passive static
condition which made the damage possible, the defendant
is said not to be Hable. But so far as the fact of causation
is concerned, in the sense of necessary antecedents which
have played an important part in producing results, it is
quite impossible to distinguish between active forces and
passive situations, particularly since, as is invariably the
case, the latter are the result of the other active forces
which have gone before.

HELD: Yes. The premise for the employer’s liability

liability is primary and can only be negated by showing
due diligence in the selection and supervision of the
employee, a factual matter that must be shown.

Phoenix Construction, Inc. v. Intermediate

COMMENT:

Art. 2176

!

•

Example:
The defendant who spills gasoline about the
premises creates a condition; but the act may be culpable
because of the danger of fire. When a spark ignites the
gasoline, the condition has gone quite as much as to bring
about the fire as the spark. Since that is the very risk
which the defendant has created, the defendant will not
escape responsibility. Even the lapse of a considerable
time during which the “condition” remains static will not
necessarily affect liability: one who digs a trench on the
highway may still be liable to another who falls into it a
month afterward.
“Cause” and “condition” still find occasional mention
in the decisions. But the distinction is now almost entirely
discredited. So far as it has any validity at all, it must
refer to the type of case where the forces set in operation
by the defendant have come to rest in a position of
427

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2176

apparent safety, and some new force intervenes. But even
in such cases, it is not the distinction between “cause” and
“condition” which is important, but the nature of the risk
and the character of the intervening cause.
(e)

No pre-existing contractual relation. (12 Manresa 613614; Algara v. Sandejas, 27 Phil. 284) Indeed, quasi-delict
or culpa aquiliana is an independent source of obligation
between two persons not so formerly bound by juridical
tie. (Batangas Laguna Tayabas Co., Inc., et al. v. Court
of Appeals, et al., L-33138-39, June 27, 1975) Of course, it
has been ruled that tort liability can exist even if there are
already contractual relations (Air France v. Carrascoso,
L-21438, Sept. 28, 1966), BUT this should be interpreted
to mean that the tort liability itself does not arise because
of the contract, but because of some other fact.
(NOTE: The person responsible [tortfeasor] is
liable even if he does not know the identity of the victim.

it happened, was the very thing sought to be prevented by
the statute or ordinance.

full and unlimited use of a company car, said company,
based on the principle of bonus pater familias, ought to
be jointly and severally liable with the former for the
injuries caused to third persons.
Once evidence is introduced showing that the
employer exercised the required amount of care in
selecting its employees, half of the employer’s burden is
overcome, but the question of diligent supervision depends
on the circumstances of employment. Ordinarily, evidence
demonstrating that the employer has exercised diligent
supervision of its employee during the performance of the
latter’s assigned tasks would be enough to relieve him of
the liability imposed by Art. 2180 in relation to Art. 2176
of the Civil Code.

his control an instrumentality extremely dangerous in
character, such as dangerous weapons or substances.

Bernabe Africa, et al. v. Caltex, et al.
L-12986, March 31, 1966
FACTS: A fire broke out at a Caltex service station. It
started while gasoline was being hosed from a tank trunk into
the underground storage, right at the opening of the receiving
tank where the nozzle of the hose had been inserted. The fire
destroyed several houses. Caltex and the station manager were
sued.
ISSUE: Without proof as to the cause and origin of the
fire, would the doctrine of res ipsa loquitor apply such that the
defendants can be presumed negligent?

HELD: Yes, for the gasoline station was under the care
of the defendant, who gave no explanation at all regarding the
fire. It is fair to reasonably infer that the incident happened
because of their want of care.
Republic v. Luzon Stevedoring Corporation
L-21749, Sept. 29, 1967

FACTS: A barge belonging to the Luzon Stevedoring
Company rammed against one of the wooden supports of the
old Nagtahan Bridge (a stationary object). What presumption
arises?
HELD: There arises the presumption that the barge was
negligent (doctrine of res ipsa loquitor, meaning the thing
speaks for itself). This is evident because the bridge (at that
433

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 2176

time) was an immovable, stationary object, adequately provided

with openings for the passage of watercraft. The doctrine can
indeed be applied, for in the ordinary course of events, such a
ramming would not occur if proper care is used.
NIA, et al. v. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al.
GR 73919, Sept. 18, 1992

On the issue of negligence, plaintiffs through the
testimonies of Andres Ventura, Florentino Ventura, and
Prudencio Martin showed that the NIA constructed irrigation
canals on the landholdingfs] of the plaintiffs by scraping away
the surface of the landholdingfs] to raise the embankment of
the canal. As a result of the said construction, in 1967, the
landholdings of the plaintiffs were inundated with water.
Although it cannot be denied that the irrigation canal of
the NIA is a boon to the plaintiffs, the delay of almost seven
years in installing the safety measures such as the check
gates, drainage[s], ditches, and paddy drains has caused
substantial damage to the annual harvest of the plaintiffs. In
fact, Engineer Carlitos, witness for the defendant declared that
these improvements were made only after the settlement of the
claim of Mrs. Virginia Tecson, which was sometime in 1976 or
1977, while the irrigation canal was constructed in 1976.
The testimonies of the plaintiffs essentially corroborated
by a disinterested witness in the person of Barangay Captain
Prudencio Martin, proved that the landholdings of the
complainants were inundated when the NIA irrigation canal
was constructed without safety devices thereby reducing their
annual harvest of 30 cavans per hectare (portions flooded).
The failure, therefore, of the NIA to provide the necessary
safeguards to prevent the inundation of plaintiffs’ land*
holdingfs] is the proximate cause of the damages to the poor
farmers.

Upon the other hand, the defendant maintains that the
cause of inundation of plaintiffs’ landholdings was the check
gate of the Cinco-cinco creek, known as Tombo check gate.
However, evidence showed that this check gate existed long
before the NIA irrigation canal was constructed and there
were no complaints from the plaintiffs until the canal of the
434

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

u'

Art. 2176

NIA was built. The uncontested testimony of barrio captain
Prudencio Martin that the former name of the sitio where the
plaintiffs’ landholdings were located was “Hilerang Duhat” but
was changed to Sitio Dagat-dagatan because of the inundation
was not without justification.

practice as they were able to establish through expert testimony
that the physicians who attended to petitioner’s husband
exercised the necessary care, within the reasonable average
merit among ordinarily good physicians, in treating him under
circumstances pertaining at that time.
Further, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not apply in
a suit against a physician or surgeon which involves the merit
of diagnosis or a scientific treatment. It is generally restricted
to situations in malpractice cases where a layman is able to
say, as a matter of common knowledge and observation, that
the consequences of professional care were not as such as
would ordinarily have followed if due care had been exercised.
(Ramos v. CA, 321 SCRA 584 [1999])
(4) Damnum Absque Injuria

This means that “although there was physical damage,
there was no legal injury.” Hence, if a carefully driven car hurts
a pedestrian because lightning temporarily blinded the driver,
the pedestrian cannot recover damages, for legally while he
has been DAMAGED, there was NO INJURY or NO FAULT in
view of the fortuitous event. (See Board of Liquidators v. Kalaw,
436

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2176

GR 18805, Aug. 14, 1967, where the Court ruled that while
the National Coconut Corporation was not able to deliver the
copra it had promised to deliver, and therefore caused damage
to the buyers, still nobody can legally be blamed because the
non-delivery was caused by typhoon. This is a case of damnum
absque injuria.)

Farolan v. Solmac Marketing Corp.
GR 83589, March 13, 1991
FACTS: Farolan was then the Acting Commissioner of
Customs, while Parayno was then the Acting Chief, Customs
Intelligence and Investigation Division. They were sued in their
official capacities as officers in the government. Nevertheless,
they were both held personally liable for the awarded damages
“since the detention of the goods by defendants (Farolan and
Parayno) was irregular and devoid of legal basis, hence, not
done in the regular performance of official duty." Solmac
Marketing was the assignee and owner of an importation
of Clojus Recycling Plastic Products of 202,204 kilograms of
what is technically known as polypropylene film, valued at
US$69,250.05. The importation, consisting of 17 containers,
arrived in December 1981. Upon application for entry, the
Bureau of Customs asked Solmac for its authority from any
government agency to import the goods described in the Bill of
Lading. Solmac presented a Board of Investment Authority for
polypropylene film scrap. However, upon examination of the
shipment by the National Institute of Science and Technology,
it turned out that the fibers of the importation were oriented
in such a way that the materials were stronger than OPP film
scrap. The Clojus shipment was not OPP film scrap, as declared
by Solmac to the Bureau of Customs and BOI Governor
Bautista, but oriented polypropylene the importation of which
is restricted, if not prohibited, under Letter of Instruction 658B. Considering the shipment was different from what had been
authorized by the BOI and by la w, Parayno and Farolan withheld
the release of the importation. Parayno wrote the BOI asking
for the latter’s advice on whether or not the importation may
be released. Thereafter, Solmac filed the action for mandamus
and injunction with the trial court, which ordered Farolan
436

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES
i .i

Art. 2176

and Parayno to release the importation. Solmac appealed only
insofar as the denial of the award of damages is concerned.
Parayno and Farolan did not appeal. The CA ordered Farolan
and Parayno solidarity liable in their personal capacity to pay
Solmac temperate damages in the sum of P100.000, exemplary
damages in the sum of the P100.000 and P50,000 as attorney’s
fees and expenses of litigation.

HELD: The Supreme Court set aside and annulled the
decision of the Court of Appeals, and held that there is no
convincing proof showing the alleged bad faith of Farolan and
Parayno. On the contrary, the evidence bolstered their claim of
good faith. First, there was the report of the NIST that, contrary
to what Solmac claimed, the importation was not OPP film
scraps but oriented polypropylene, a plastic product of stronger
material, whose importation to the Philippines was restricted,
if not prohibited. It was on the strength of this finding that they
withheld release of the importation for being contrary to law.
Second, on many occasions, the Bureau of Customs sought the
advice of the BOI on whether the subject importation might be
released. Third, up to the time of the trial there was no clear¬
cut policy on the part of the BOI regarding the entry into the
Philippines of oriented polypropylene. Even the highest officers
of the BOI were not in agreement as to what proper course
to take on the subject of the various importations of Oriented
Polypropylene (OPP) and Polypropylene (PP) withheld by
the Bureau of Customs. The conflicting recommendations of
the BOI prompted petitioners to seek final clarification from
the former with regard of its policy on the importations. The
confusion over the disposition of the importation obviates bad
faith. When a public officer takes his oath of office, he binds
himself to perform the duties of his office faithfully and to use
reasonable skill and diligence, and to act primarily for the
benefit of the public. Thus, in the discharge of his duties, he
is to use that prudence, caution, and attention which careful
men use in the management of their affairs. That petitioners
acted in good faith in not immediately releasing the imported
goods is supported by substantial evidence, independent of the
presumption of good faith, which was not successfully rebutted.
Here, prudence dictated that petitioners first obtain from the
BOI the latter’s definite guidelines regarding the disposition
437

Art. 2176

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

of the various importations of oriented polypropylene and
polypropylene then being withheld at the Bureau of Customs.
These cellophane film products were competing with locally
manufactured polypropylene and oriented polypropylene as
raw materials which were then already sufficient to meet
local demands. Hence, their importation were restricted, if not
prohibited. Thus, petitioners could not be said to have acted
in bad faith in not immediately releasing the imported goods
without obtaining the necessary clarificatory guidelines from
the BOI. As public officers, petitioners had the duty to see to
it that the law they were tasked to implement, i.e., LOI 658-B,
was faithfully complied with. But even if petitioners committed
a mistake in withholding the release of the importation because
it was composed of film scraps, nonetheless, it is the duty of
the Court to see to it that public officers are not hampered
in the performance of their duties or in making decisions for
fear of personal liability for damages due to honest mistake.
Whatever damages they may have caused as a result of such
an erroneous interpretation, if any at all, is in the nature of a
damnum absque injuria.
(5) Last Clear Chance

The doctrine of “last clear chance” is to the effect that even
if the injured party was originally at fault (as when he was on
the wrong side of a street) still if the person who finally caused
the accident had the “last clear opportunity” to avoid striking
him, he who could have prevented the injury is still liable if he
did not take advantage of such opportunity or chance.
Other names for the doctrine of “last clear chance”
include “doctrine of discovered peril”; “doctrine of supervening
negligence”; “the humanitarian doctrine.”
In the case of Ong v. Metropolitan Water District (104
Phil. 398), the Court applying 38 Am. Jur. 900, said that
according to third doctrine “the negligence of the plaintiff does
not preclude (or prevent) a recovery for the negligence of the
defendant where it appears that the defendant by exercising
reasonable care and prudence might have avoided injurious
consequences to the plaintiff notwithstanding the plaintiffs
negligence.”
438

Art. 2176

Ong v. Metropolitan Water District
104 Phil. 398

FACTS: A visitor was drowned in a swimming resort due
to his own negligence and despite measures on the part of the
resort authorities to save him. Is the resort liable?
HELD: No, the resort is NOT liable. While it is duty

bound to provide for safety measures, still it is not an absolute
insurer of the safety of its customers or visitors. The doctrine
of “last clear chance” cannot apply if the:
(a) negligence of the plaintiff is concurrent with the
negligence of the defendant;
(b) party charged is required to act instantaneously,
(c)

iiyury cannot be avoided despite the application at
all times of all the means to avoid the injury (after
the peril is or should have been discovered), at least
in all instances where the previous negligence of the
party charged cannot be said to have contributed to
the injury at all.

Picart v. Smith
37 Phil. 809
FACTS: A person driving an automobile on a bridge saw
a man on horseback riding towards him but on the wrong side
of the bridge. The driver sounded his horn several times; the
horse-rider made no move to go to the correct side; the driver
continued in his original direction until it was too late to avoid
a collision. Is the auto driver liable?

HELD: Yes, for although the horse-rider was originally at
fault, it was the auto driver who had the last clear chance to
avoid the injury by merely swerving, while still some distance
away, to the other part of the bridge. “Where both parties are
guilty of negligence, but the negligent act of one succeeds that
of the other by an appreciable interval of time, the one who has
the last reasonable opportunity to avoid the impending harm
and fails to do so, is chargeable with the consequences, without
reference to the prior negligence of the other party.” That is the
doctrine known as the “last clear chance.”

Contractual Relations
Air France v. Carrascoso
L-21438, Sept. 28, 1966

Phoenix Construction, Inc. v. Intermediate
Appellate Court
GR 65295, March 10, 1987
The last clear chance doctrine of the common law was
imported into our jurisdiction, but it is a matter for debate
whether, or to what extent, if has found its way into the Civil
Code of the Philippines. The historical function of that doctrine
in the common law was to mitigate the harshness of another
common law doctrine or rule that of contributory negligence.

FACTS: An airplane passenger despite his first-class
ticket, was illegally ousted from his first-class accommodation,
and was compelled to take a seat in the tourist compartment.
ISSUE: May he recover damages from the carrier on the
ground of tort?

—

The common-law rule of contributory negligence pre¬
vented any recovery at all by the plaintiff who was also negli¬
gent, even if the plaintiffs negligence was relatively minor as
compared with the wrongful act or omission of the defendant.
The common-law notion of last clear chance permitted courts
to grant recovery to a plaintiff who had also been negligent,
provided, that the defendant had the last clear chance to avoid
the casualty and failed to do so. It is difficult to see what role,
if any, the common-law has clear chance doctrine has to play
in a jurisdiction where the common-law concept of contributory
negligence as an absolute bar to recover by the plaintiffs, has
itself been rejected, as it has been in Art. 2179.

Art. 2176

(J ’
> '

HELD: Yes, because although the relation between a
passenger and a carrier is contractual both in origin and
nature, the act that breaks the contract may also be a tort.
(NOTE: It would seem here that the Court has in a sense
modified somehow Art. 2176 which defines “quasi-delict,” for
under said article, it is important that “there is no pre-existing
contractual relation between the parties.” Be it noted however
that in this case, the Court referred to the liability as one
arising from tort, and not one arising from a contract.)

L-24837,

FACTS: Because of a mistake committed by a clerk in
the Bank of the Philippine Islands, the current or checking
account of Julian Singson was frozen by the said Bank, and the
depositor’s checks were dishonored. Singson complained. When
the Bank realized it had committed a mistake, it apologized to
Singson, and restored the checking account. Singson, however,
sued for damages. It was alleged by the Bank that there would
be no liability for the negligence or quasi-delict in view of
the existence of contractual relations between the Bank and
Singson; that moreover, the Bank had immediately corrected
its error.
J

In a civil law jurisdiction like ours, there is no general
concept of “last clear chance” that may be extracted from its
common-law matrix and used as a general rule in negligence
cases. Under Art. 2179, the task of a court, in technical terms, is
to determine whose negligence the plaintiffs or defendant’s
was the legal or proximate cause of the injury. The task
is not simply or even primarily an exercise in chronology or
physics, as one may imply by the use of terms like “last” or
“intervening.” The relative location in the continuum of time of
the plaintiffs and the defendant’s negligent acts or omissions,
is only one of the relevant factors that may be taken into
account. Of more fundamental importance are the nature of
the negligent act or omission of each party and the character
and gravity of the risks created by such act or omission for the
rest of the community.

ISSUE: Can Singson recover?

Art. 2176

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

HELD: Yes, damages may be recovered by Singson,
despite the existence of contractual relations because the
act that breaks the contract may also be a tort or a quasi¬
delict, as in this case. However, considering the rectification
immediately made by the Bank, an award of nominal damages
in the amount
the amount of which need not be proved
of Pl,000 in addition of attorney’s fees in the sum of P500, will
suffice to vindicate plaintiffs rights. (See Arts. 2208 and 2221,

(7) Non-Liability

Ng v. Republic
L-31935, Jan. 24, 1980

Art. 2177

In the case at bar, as the claimed negligent act of petitioner
was not premised on the breach of any law, and not to mention
the incontestable fact that no pre-existing contractual relation
was averred to exist between the parties, Art. 2176 - instead of
Arts. 19, 20 and 21 - of the Civil Code should govern.

(8) An Unregistered Deed of Sale

Equitable Leasing Corp. v.
Lucita Suyom, et al.
GR 143360, Sept. 5, 2002

ISSUE: Can the petitioner, a registered owner of a motor
vehicle be held liable for the acts of the driver employed by
its former lessee who has become the owner of that vehicle by
virtue of an unregistered Deed of Sale?

HELD: Yes. In an action based on quasi-delict, the
registered owner of a motor vehicle is solidarily liable for
uyuries and damages caused by the negligence of the driver,
in spite of the fact that the vehicle may have already been the
subject of an unregistered Deed of Sale in favor of another
person.

Unless registered with the Land Transportation Office
(LTO), the sale, while valid and binding between the parties,
does not affect third parties, especially the victims of accidents
involving the said transport equipment.
442

Art. 2177. Responsibility for fault or negligence under
the preceding article is entirely separate and distinct from
the civil liability arising from negligence under the Penal
Code. But the plaintiff cannot recover damages twice for the
same act or omission of the defendant.

COMMENT:
(1) Culpa Aquiliana Distinguished From Civil Liability

Arising From a Crime

See Table under the preceding Article.
(2) Effect of Acquittal in a Criminal Case

Acquittal from an accusation of criminal negligence
whether on reasonable doubt or not, shall not be a bar to a
subsequent civil action. (Report of the Code Com., p. 62 and
Chan v. Yatco, L-11163, April 30, 1958) Reason: The evidence
in the criminal case may not be sufficient for a conviction,
but sufficient for a civil liability, where mere preponderance
443

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2177

i

of evidence is sufficient. Moreover, the basis of liability is
different in the two cases: in a criminal case, the liability is
subsidiary to the criminal case, the liability is subsidiary to
the criminal punishment; in a case of culpa aquiliana, the
liability is primary. (TS, Nov. 22, 1940 and See Calo, et al. v.
Peggy, L-10756, March 29, 1958]) However, under the Revised
Rules of Court, the civil action must have been RESERVED,
otherwise the civil case will NOT prosper. (Rule 111)
Marcia v. Court of Appeals
GR 34529, Jan. 27, 1983

If in a criminal case for reckless imprudence resulting in
physical injuries, the accused is acquitted because he was not
negligent and the incident was a “pure accident,” a separate
civil action should be dismissed.
(NOTE: Here, the court said that Art. 33 of the Civil Code
speaks only of intentional or malicious acts. It forgot that Art.
2177 read together with Art. 2176 provides for an independent
civil action for negligent acts. However, the conclusions reached
by the court may be justified on the ground that there was also
no negligence in this present case.)

(3) Query

If a hurt pedestrian files a criminal case against the driver
of a common carrier, is he allowed at the same time (or at any
stage during the pendency of the criminal case) to bring a civil
action based on culpa aquiliana?
ANS.: It would seem that the correct answer to this
problem is YES provided that a RESERVATION to bring the
civil case had been set up in the criminal case. (See Rule 111,
Revised Rules of Court) In other words, in a case like this it is
not essential to first terminate the criminal case before the civil
case of quasi-delict is brought. Indeed, the civil liability that
may arise from culpa aquiliana was never intended by the law
to be merged in the criminal action. The criminal prosecution
is not a condition precedent to the enforcement of the civil
right. (Batangas, Laguna, Tayabas Bus Co., Inc., et al. v. Court
of Appeals, et al., L-33138-9, June 27, 1975)

Art 2177

Batangas, Laguna, Tayabas, Bus Co., Inc. v.
Court of Appeals, et al.
L-33138-39, June 27, 1975
FACTS: As a result of the recklessness of a driver (Ragan)
of a bus of BLTB Company in overtaking a cargo truck, the bus
crashed into an automobile coming from the opposite direction,
resulting to death and physical injuries to the passengers of
the automobile. A criminal case was brought, but during its
pendency, a civil case based on culpa aquiliana under Art.
2177 of the Civil Code was filed.
ISSUE: Can the civil action of culpa aquiliana proceeds
independently of the pending criminal case, or must the
judgment in the criminal case be first awaited before proceeding
with the civil case?

HELD: The civil case of culpa aquiliana can proceed
independently of the pending criminal case. This is expressly
allowed under Art. 2176 and Art. 2177 of the Civil Code, because
culpa aquiliana is an independent source of obligations. The
case of Corpus v. Paje, L-26737, July 31, 1969 does not apply
because the statement therein that no independent civil
action lies in a case of culpa aquiliana or reckless imprudence
(because Art. 33 of the Civil Code does not mention reckless
imprudence) is really not doctrinal in character, lacking as it
does, one vote to make it an expression of the court opinion.
(NOTE: In fact, while it is true that Art. 33 makes no
mention of negligence, Art. 2177 refers to negligence or culpa
aquiliana and makes the suit an independent civil action.)
(4) Rule under the 1985 Rules of Court, as Amended

While Art. 2177 gives an independent civil action,
still the Revised Rules of Court required that if a criminal
case be instituted first, the independent civil action is also
automatically instituted unless there is an express reservation
or waiver. (Rule 111) If, on the other hand, the civil case of
culpa aquiliana is first brought, the subsequent institution
of the criminal case will NOT SUSPEND the civil action
otherwise, it cannot then be called independent. Moreover, the
very institution of the civil case ahead of the criminal action
satisfied the requirement of “reservation.”

Art. 2177

Garcia v. Florido

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

The accused objected to the allowance on the theory that in the
City Court (original court), no reservation had been made, thus
the civil aspect should be deemed included in the criminal suit,
conformably with Rule 111 of the Revised Rules of Court. The
CFI (RTC) maintained that the civil case should be allowed,
because with the appeal the judgment of the City Court had
become vacated (said court was then not a court of record) and
in the CFI (RTC) the case was to be tried anew (trial de novo).
This ruling of the CFI (RTC) was elevated to the Supreme
Court on certiorari.

m

L-35095, Aug. 31, 1973

FACTS: After a vehicular accident, the victims were
brought to the hospital for treatment. In the meantime, the
police authorities filed a criminal case of reckless imprudence
resulting in physical injuries, WITHOUT making a reservation
as to the civil aspect. When the victims became well enough to
go to court, they decided to file a civil case despite the pendency
of the criminal case.
ISSUE: Should the civil case be allowed despite the
pendency of the criminal proceedings?

HELD: Yes, for while it is true that a reservation should
have been made under Rule 111 of the Revised Rules of Court
(through such rule has been assailed by SOME in this respect
as virtually eliminating or amending the “substantive” right
of allowing an “independent civil action,” as ordained by the
Civil Code) still the Rule does not state when the reservation is
supposed to be made. Here, the victims had no chance to make
the reservation (for they were still at the hospital); moreover,
the trial has not even begun. It is therefore not yet too late to
make the reservation; in fact, the actual filing of the civil case,
though at this stage, is even better than the making of the
reservation.

ISSUE: May a civil case still be brought despite the
appeal in the criminal case?

HELD: Yes, for three reasons.

,

(a)

'■

FACTS: Francisco Abellana was driving a cargo truck
when he hit a motorized pedicab. Four of the passengers of
the pedicab were injured. He was accused in the City Court of
Ozamis for his reckless imprudence (no reservation was made
as to any civil action that might be instituted); he was convicted.
He then appealed to the Court of First Instance (Regional Trial
Court). During the pendency of the appeal (and in fact, before
trial in the CFI [RTC]) the victims decided to make a waiver
reclaim for damages in the criminal case, and RESERVATION
with respect to the civil aspects. The victims then in another
Branch of the CFI (RTC) allowed the FILING of the civil case.
446

Firstly, with the appeal, the original judgment of
conviction was VACATED; there will be a trial de novo
in the CFI. A trial that has not even began, therefore, a
reservation can still be made and a civil action can still be

allowed.

Secondly, to say that the civil action is barred because no
reservation (pursuant to Rule 111) had been made in the
City Court when the criminal suit was filed is to present
a grave constitutional question, namely, can the Supreme
Court, in Rule 111 amend or restrict a SUBSTANTIVE
right granted by the Civil Code? This cannot be done.
The apparent literal import of the Rule cannot prevail.
A judge “is not to fall prey,” as admonished by Justice
Frankfurter, “to the vice of literalness.”
Thirdly, it would be UNFAIR, under the circumstances
if the victims would not be allowed to recover any civil
liability, considering the damage done to them.

—

when a criminal case is filed, is there a need of
was
making a reservation if it is desired to sue later on an
independent civil action?
447

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2177

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 103 of the Revised Penal Code. Further, there is no res
judicata because the responsibility of an employer in culpa
aquiliana (the civil case) is different from his liability in culpa
criminal (the subsidiary civil liability in the criminal case). The
only limitation is that while it is possible that in both cases the
employer can be held liable, actual recovery for damages can be
availed of only once.

HELD: There is NO NEED, because the civil case is
one considered as an “independent civil action.”

which requires the reservation., even if an independent
civil action is involved?)
(5) No Double Recovery

Padua, et al. v. Robles, et al.
L-40486, Aug. 29, 1975

FACTS: Because of the recklessness of a taxi-driver, a
boy (Padua) was killed. A criminal case was instituted against
Punzalan, the taxi-driver. At the same time, a civil action for
damages was filed against both the driver and the owner of the
taxi (Robles). The two cases were raffled off to the same judge
for decision. In the civil case, the taxi-cab owner (company)
was not made to pay anything (ostensibly because it was
able to prove due diligence in the selection and supervision of
employees) but the taxi-driver, who was found negligent, was
held liable for damages (P12,000 for actual damages, P5.000
for moral and exemplary damages, and P10,000 for attorney’s
fees). In the criminal case, the judge convicted the taxi-driver,
but with reference to his civil liability, the court did not fix
any sum, stating only that the “civil liability of the accused
is already determined and assessed in the civil case.” When
the judgment in the civil case became final and executory,
the parents of the victim sought its execution, but the writ
issued against the driver was returned unsatisfied because of
his insolvency. The parents now sued the employer to enforce
his subsidiary liability under the Revised Penal Code because
of the driver’s conviction. Robles, the employer pleaded res
judicata.

ISSUE: Can the employer still be held liable?

HELD: Yes, the employer can still be held liable because
the judgment in the criminal case, in talking of the driver’s
civil liability, made reference to the decision in the civil case,
relative to the driver’s financial accountability. It is this
amount for which the employer is subsidiarily liable under

.

GR 145391, Aug. 26, 2002

FACTS: The petition premises the legal controversy in
this wise: “In a certain vehicular accident involving two parties,
each one of them may think and believe that the accident was
caused by the fault of the other. The first party, believing
himself to be the aggrieved party, opted to file a criminal
case for reckless imprudence against the second party. Upon
the other hand, the second party, together with the operator,
believing themselves to be the real aggrieved parties, opted in
turn to file a civil case for quasi-delict against the first party
who is the very private complainant in the criminal case.”
ISSUE: Whether or not an accused in a pending criminal
case for reckless imprudence can validly filed, simultaneously
and independently, a separate civil action for quasi-delict
against private complainant in the criminal case.
HELD: Par. 6, Sec. 1 of the present Rule III of the Rules
of Court was incorporated in the Dec. 1, 2000 Amended Rules
precisely to address the issue. Under this provision, the accused
is barred from filing a counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party
complaint in the criminal case. However, the same provision
states that “any cause of action which could have been the
subject (of the counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party
complaint) may be litigated in a separate civil action.” The
present Rule III mandates the accused to file his counterclaim
in a separate civil action which shall proceed independently
of the criminal action, even as the civil action of the offended
party is litigated in the criminal action.
449

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art, 2177

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

The accused can file a civil action for quasi-delict for the
same act or omission he is accused of in the criminal case. This
is expressly allowed in par. 6, Sec. 1 of the present Rule III
which states that the counterclaim of the accused “may be
litigated in a separate civil action.” This is only fair for two
reasons:
1.

The accused is prohibited from setting up any
counterclaim in the civil aspect that is deemed instituted
in the criminal case. The accused is, therefore, forced to
litigant separately his counterclaim against the offended
party. If the accused does not file a separate civil action
for quasi-delict, the prescriptive period may set in since
the period continues to run until the civil action for quasidelict is filed.

2.

The accused, who is presumed innocent, has a right to
invoke Art. 2177, in the same way that the offended
party can avail of this remedy which is independent of
the criminal action. To disallow the accused from filing
a separate civil action for quasi-delict, while refusing to
recognize his counterclaim in the criminal case, is to deny
him due process of law, access to the courts, and equal
protection of the law.

Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) in the Casupanan & Capitulo
case (supra) issued the order of dismissal on Dec. 28, 1999
or before the amendment of the rules. The Revised Rules
on Criminal Procedure must be given retroactive effect
considering the well-settled rule that “statutes regulating
the procedure of the court will be construed as applicable
to actions pending and undetermined at the time of their
passage. Procedural laws are retroactive in that sense
and to that extent. [People v. Arrojado, 350 SCRA 679

Art. 2178. The provisions of Articles 1172 to 1174 are also
applicable to a quasi-delict.

COMMENT:
(1) Applicability of Some Provisions on Negligence

The civil action based on quasi-delict filed separately,
is, thus, proper.
{.NOTE: More than half-a-century has passed since
the Civil Code introduced the concept of a civil action
separate and independent from the criminal action
although arising from the same act or omission. The
Supreme Court, however, has yet to encounter a case of
conflicting and irreconcilable decisions of trial courts, one
hearing the criminal case and the other the civil action
for quasi-delict. The fear of conflicting and irreconcilable
decisions may be more apparent than real. In any event,
there are sufficient remedies under the Rules of Court to
deal with such remote possibilities. [Avelino Casupanan
& Roberto Capitulo v. Marioi Llavore Laroya, supra])

Art. 2178

Article 1172
Responsibility arising from negligence
in the performance of every kind of obligation is also
demandable, but such liability may be regulated by the
courts, according to the circumstances.

(b)

Article 1173
The fault or negligence of the obligor
consists in the omission of that diligence which is required
by the nature of the obligation and corresponds with
the circumstances of the persons, of the time and of the
place. When negligence shows bad faith, the provisions of
Articles 1171 and 2201, paragraph 2 shall apply.

which is to be observed in the performance, that which is
expected of a good father of a family shall be required.

(2) Effect of Contributory Negligence of Plaintiff

Ronquillo, et al. v. Singson

(a)

(CA) L-22612-R, April 22, 1959

FACTS: A man ordered a ten-year-old boy, Jose Ronquillo,
to climb a high and rather slippery santol tree, with a promise
to give him part of the fruits. The boy was killed in the act of
climbing. Is the person who ordered him liable?

HELD: Yes, in view of his negligent act in making the
order. He did not take due care to avoid a reasonably foreseeable
injury to the ten-year-old boy. The tree was a treacherous one,
a veritable trap. His act was clearly a departure from the
standard of conduct required of a prudent man. He should have
desisted from making the order. Since he failed to appreciate
the predictable danger and aggravated such negligence by
offering part of the fruits as a reward, it is clear that he should
be made to respond in damages for the actionable wrong
committed by him.
Vda. de Imperial, et al. v. Herald Lumber Co.
L- 14088-89, L-14112, Sept. 30, 1961
Undertaking an airplane or helicopter flight without
sufficient fuel is a clear case of negligence. Moreover, the
piloting of a helicopter by an unlicensed individual violates
Civil Aviation Regulations.

Art. 2179. When the plaintiff’s own negligence was the
immediate and proximate cause of his injury, he cannot
recover damages. But if his negligence was only contributory,
the immediate and proximate cause of the injury being
the defendant’s lack of due care, the plaintiff may recover
damages, but the courts shall mitigate the damages to be
awarded.

COMMENT:
(1) Effect of Sole Cause of Injury is a Person’s Own

Negligence

It is understood that if the sole cause is the plaintiff’s own
fault, there can be no recovery. (TS, May 31, 1932)
452

If this was the PROXIMATE cause of the accident, there
can be no recovery. (Taylor v. Manila Electric Co., 16 Phil.

8)

(b)

If the PROXIMATE cause was still the negligence of
the defendant, the plaintiff can still recover damages,
BUT the amount of damages will be mitigated due to his
contributory negligence. (Art. 2179) Thus, if he contributes
to the aggravation of the injury, damages in his favor will
be reduced. (Rakes v. Atlantic Gulf and Pacific Co., 7 Phil.
359; Bernal v. House, 54 Phil. 327; and Del Rosario u.
Manila Electric Co., 57 Phil. 478)
(NOTE: The courts have held that in CRIMES
committed through reckless imprudence, the defense
of contributory negligence does NOT apply. One cannot
allege the negligence of another to evade the effects of his
own negligence. [People v. Orbeta, 43 O.G. 3175; People
v. Quinones, 44 O.G. 1520; and People v. Cabusao, CA.,
L20191-R, Sept. 7, 1958J)

(3) Proximate Cause

It is that adequate and efficient cause which in the
natural order of events, and under the particular circumstances
surrounding the case, would naturally produce the event. (3
Bouvier’s Law Dictionary 434)
Saturnino Bayasen v. Court of Appeals
L-25785, Feb. 28, 1981

While being driven at a moderate speed, a passenger
jeep skidded and fell into a precipice. It was proved that the
proximate cause of the tragedy was the skidding of the rear
wheels of the jeep. Is the driver guilty of negligence?

HELD: No, for there was no negligence. Cars may skid on
greasy or slippery roads without the driver’s fault. Skidding
means partial or complete loss of control of the car under
circumstances not necessarily implying negligence. It may
occur without fault.

Phoenix Construction, Inc. v. Intermediate
Appellate Court
GR 65295, March 10, 1987
If the intervening cause is one which in ordinary human
experience is reasonably to be anticipated, or one which the
defendant has reason to anticipate under the particular
circumstances, the defendant may be negligent, among other
reasons, because of failure to guard against it; or the defendant
may be negligent only for that reason.
Example:

One who sets a fire may be required to foresee that an
ordinary, usual and customary wind arising later will spread
it beyond the defendant’s own property, and therefore to take
precautions to prevent that event. The person who leaves
combustible or explosive material exposed in a public place
may foresee the risk of fire from some independent source. In
all of these cases, there is an intervening cause combining with
the defendant’s conduct to produce the result, and in each case
the defendant’s negligence consists in failure to protect the
plaintiff against that very risk.
The defendant cannot be relieved from liability by the
fact that the risk or a substantial and important part of the
risk, to which the defendant has subjected the plaintiff has
indeed come to pass. Foreseeable intervening forces are within
the scope of the original risk, and hence of the defendant’s
agreed negligence. The courts are quite, generally, agreed
that the intervening causes which fall fairly in this category
will not supersede defendant’s responsibility. A defendant will
be required to anticipate the usual weather of the vicinity,
including all ordinary forces of nature such as usual wind or
rain, or snow or frost or fog or even lightning. One who leaves

an obstruction on the road or a railroad track should foresee
that a vehicle or a train will run into it.
The risk created by the defendant may include the
intervention of the foreseeable negligence of others. The
standard of reasonable conduct may require the defendant to
protect the plaintiff against “that occasional negligence which
is one of the ordinary incidents of human life, and therefore to
be anticipated.”
454

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2179

Example:

A defendant who blocks the sidewalk and forces the
plaintiff to walk in a street where the plaintiff will be exposed
to the risks of heavy traffic becomes liable when the plaintiff is
run down by a car, even though the car is negligently driven.
One who parks an automobile on the highway without lights at
night is not relieved of responsibility when another negligently

drives into it.

Phoenix Construction, Inc. v. Intermediate
Appellate Court
GR 65295, March 10, 1987
FACTS: At about 1:30 a.m., LD was on his way home
from a cocktails-and-dinner meeting with his boss. During the
cocktails, LD had taken a “shot or two” of liquor. LD was driving
his car and had just crossed the intersection, not far from his
home when his headlights suddenly failed. He switched his
headlights on “bright” and thereupon he saw a Ford dump
truck looming some 2-1/2 meters away from his car. The dump
truck, owned by Phoenix Construction, Inc. was parked on the
right hand side of the street (i.e., on the right hand side of a
person facing in the same direction toward which LD’s car was
proceeding), facing the oncoming traffic. The dump truck was
parked askew (not parallel to the street curb) in such manner
as to stick out onto the street, partly blocking the way of
oncoming traffic. There were no lights nor any so-called “early
warning” reflector devices set anywhere near the dump truck,
front or rear. LD tried to avoid a collision by swerving his car to
the left but it was too late and his car smashed into the dump
truck. LD suffered physical injuries including some permanent
facial scars, a “nervous breakdown” and loss of two gold bridge
dentures.

LD sued Phoenix and its driver claiming that the legal
and proximate cause of his injuries was the negligent manner
in which phoenix’s driver had parked the dump truck. Phoenix
and its driver countered that the proximate cause of LD’b
injuries was his own recklessness in driving fast at the time of
the accident, while under the influence of liquor, without his
headlights on and without a curfew pass. Phoenix also sought
to establish that it had exercised due care in the selection and
455

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2179

supervision of the driver. The trial court rendered judgment
in favor of LD. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision but
modified the award of damages.

On petition for review, the Supreme Court found that LD
was negligent the night of the accident. He was hurrying home
that night and driving faster than he should have been. Worse,
he extinguished his headlights at or near the intersection, as
he approached his residence, and thus did not see the dump
truck that was parked askew and sticking out onto the road
lane. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court agreed with the trial
court and the appellate court that the legal and proximate
cause of the accident and of LD’s injuries was the wrongful and
negligent manner in which the truck was parked. The Supreme
Court

—

HELD: There was a reasonable relationship between

the dump truck driver’s negligence on the one hand and the
accident and LD's injuries on the other hand. The collision of
LD’s car with the dump truck was a natural and foreseeable
consequence of the truck driver’s negligence. The truck driver’s
negligence far from being a “passive and static condition” was
an indispensable and efficient cause. The collision between
the dump truck and LD’s car would in all probability not have
occurred had the dump truck not been parked askew without
any warning lights or reflector devices. The improper parking
of the dump truck created an unreasonable risk of injury for
anyone driving and for having so created this risk the truck
driver must be held responsible. LD’s negligence, although
later in point of time than the truck driver’s negligence, and
therefore closer to the accident, was not an efficient intervening
or independent cause. What Phoenix and its driver describe
as an “intervening cause” was no more than a foreseeable
consequence of the risk created by the negligent manner
in which the truck driver had parked the dump truck. LD’s
negligence was not of an independent and overpowering nature
as to cut, as it were, the chain of causation in fact between
the improper parking of the dump truck and the accident, nor
to sever the juris vinculum of liability. LD’s negligence was
“only contributory.” The immediate and proximate cause of the
injury remained the truck driver’s “lack of due care.” Hence,
LD may recover damages though such damages are subject to
mitigation by the courts.
456

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2179

The last clear chance doctrine of the common law, imported
into our jurisdiction, has no role to play in a jurisdiction where
the common law concept of contributory negligence as an
absolute bar to recovery by the plaintiffs has itself been rejected
in Art. 2179. Our law on quasi-delicts seeks to reduce the risks
and burdens of living in society and to allocate them among
the members of society. The truck driver’s proven negligence
creates a presumption of negligence on the part of his employer
in supervising its employees properly and adequately.
(4) Examples of Proximate Cause
(a)

If a passenger boxes a bus driver who subsequently loses
control of the vehicle, the act of the passenger is the
proximate cause.

If the Meralco leaves an exposed live wire, and subsequent
electrocution follows because somebody touches the wire,
the negligence of the Meralco is the proximate cause. (TS,
Feb. 24, 1928)
(c) If somebody neglects to cover his ditch (filled with hot
water) and a child carelessly falls into it, the negligence is
the proximate cause, though the contributory negligence
of the child would reduce the amount of recoverable
damages. (Bernal and Enverso v. House & Tacloban
Electric and Ice Plant, 54 Phil. 327)
(d) If the damaged vehicle was driven by a reckless driver
who made the vehicle travel at a very high rate of speed
and on the wrong side of the road, it is clear that this
negligence was the proximate cause of the collision.

(5) Case

Metro Manila Transit Corp, and Apolinario Ajoc
v. Court of Appeals, etc.
GR 141089, Aug. 1, 2002
FACTS: Petitioners were found liable for the death of
Fiorentina Sabalburo by the trial court in a vehicular accident
involving a passenger bus owned by petitioner, Metro Manila
457

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2179

Transit Corp. (MMTC) and driven by petitioner Apolinario
Ajoc. Accordingly, petitioners were ordered to pay damages to
private respondents.

Petitioners reasonably appealed to the Court of Appeals

(CA), insisting that the accident was solely the fault of the
victim since she suddenly crossed a very busy street with

complete disregard for her safety and in violation of traffic
rules and regulations designed to protect pedestrians. The CA
affirmed the trial court’s decisions. Petitioners then moved
for reconsideration, but the CA denied their motion in its
resolution of Dec. 10, 1999. Hence, the present petition.

ISSUE: Whether or not Art. 2179 as an exception to
Art. 2176 is applicable in the instant case.
HELD- Records support private respondents’ claim that
the MMTC bus was being driven carelessly. As found by the
trial court and affirmed by the CA, the victim and her com¬
panions were standing on the island of Andrew Ave., waiting
for the traffic light to change so they could cross. Upon seeing
the red light, the victim and her companions started to cross.
It was then when petitioner Ajoc, who was trying to beat the
red light, hit the victim. As the court a quo noted, Ajoc’s claim
that “he failed to see the victim and her companions proves
his recklessness and lack of caution in driving his vehicle.”
Findings of fact of the trial court, especially when
affirmed by the CA, are binding and conclusive on the Supreme
Court. (Austria v. CA, 327 SCRA 668 [2000]) Moreso, as in
the case at bar, where petitioners have not adequately shown
that the courts below overlooked or disregarded certain facts
or circumstances of such import as would have altered the
outcome of the case. Contrary to petitioners’ insistence, the
applicable law in this case is Art. 2176 and not Art. 2179.
(6) When a Failure to Act Is Deemed the ‘Proximate Cause’

Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital v. Capanzana
821 SCRA 258
(2017)

A failure to act may be the proximate cause if it plays
a substantial part in bringing about an injury.
458

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

Art. 2180. The obligation imposed by Article 2176 is

demandable not only for one’s own act or omissions, but also
for those of persons for whom one is responsible.

The father, and, in case of his death or incapacity, the
mother, are responsible for the damages caused by the minor
children who live in their company.

Guardians are liable for damages caused by the minors
or incapacitated persons who are under their authority and
live in their company.
The owners and managers of an establishment or
enterprises are likewise responsible for damages caused by
their employees in the service of the branches in which the
latter are employed or on the occasion of their functions.

Employers shall be liable for the damages caused by
their employees and household helpers acting within the
scope of their assigned tasks, even though the former are
not engaged in any business or industry.

The State is responsible in like manner when it acts
through a special agent; but not when the damage has
been caused by the official to whom the task done properly
pertains, in which case what is provided in Article 2176 shall
be applicable.
Lastly, teachers or heads of establishments of arts and
trades shall be liable for damages caused by their pupils
and students or apprentices, so long as they remain in their
custody.

The responsibility treated of in this article shall cease
when the person herein mentioned prove that they observed
all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent
damage.

(2) Reason for the Liability

Negligence in supervision. (See Bahia v. Litonjua, 30

(NOTE: This negligence is PRESUMED but may be
rebutted by proof of diligence. [See last paragraph, Art. 2180])
(3) Solidarily Liability

The person responsible for the act (like the minor), and the
person exercising supervision (like the parents) are solidarily
liable. (Art. 2194; Araneta, et al. v. Arreglado, et al., 104 Phil.
529) Indeed, the liability of the guardian or master is primary
and direct, NOT subsidiary. (Barredo v. Soriano, 73 Phil. 607)
(NOTE: The mother is liable only if the father is dead
or incapacitated, hence, if the father is alive and all right, the
mother should not be joined as party defendant. [Romano, et

Maria Teresa Cuadra v. Alfonso Monfort
L-24101, Sept 30, 1970

FACTS: While playing inside a schoolyard, a 13-year-old
girl playfully tossed as a joke a girl’s headband at her 12-yearold girl classmate. The latter, who was surprised by the act,
turned around only to have her eyes hit. One eye eventually
became blind after unsuccessful surgical operations thereon.
The victim then sued the culprit’s father for damages. Is the
defendant liable.

HELD: No, the culprit’s father is not liable, for he could
not have prevented the damage in any way. The child was
at school where she ought to be under the supervision of the
school authorities.
(DISSENTING OPINION of Justice Antonio Barredo:

The culprit’s father should be held liable for no proof was
presented that he even warned the child not to play dangerous
460

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

jokes on her classmates; the burden of proof of non-negligence
must be on the part of the culprit’s parents or guardians.)
(NOTE: In the said case, no suit was brought against the
school authorities, the teacher in charge, or the school itself.)

Libi, et al. v. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al.
GR 70890, Sept. 18, 1992
The civil liability of parents for quasi-delicts of their
minor children, as contemplated in Art. 2180 of the Civil
Code, is primary and not subsidiary. In fact, if we apply Art.
2194 of said code which provides for solidary liability of joint
tortfeasors, the persons responsible for the act or omission, in
this case, the minor and the father and, in case of his death or
incapacity, the mother, are solidarily liable. Accordingly, such
parental liability is primary and not subsidiary; hence, the
last paragraph of Art. 2180 provides that “[t]he responsibility
treated of in this article shall cease when the persons herein
mentioned prove that they observed all the diligence of a good
father of a family to prevent damage.” To hold that the civil
liability under Art. 2180 would apply only to quasi-delicts and
not to criminal offenses would result in the absurdity that in
an act involving mere diligence, the parents would be liable
but not where the damage is caused with criminal intent. The
liability of the parents for felonies committed by their minor
children is likewise primary, not subsidiary. (See Art. 101 of
the Revised Penal Code) It bears stressing, however, that the
Revised Penal Code provides for subsidiary liability only for
persons causing damages under the compulsion of irresistible
force or under the impulse of an uncontrollable fear; innkeepers,
tavernkeepers, and proprietors of establishments; employers,
teachers, persons, and corporations engaged in industry; and
principals, accomplices, and accessories for the unpaid civil
liability of their co-accused in the other classes.

Under the foregoing considerations, therefore, it is hereby
ruled that the parents are and should be held primarily liable
for the civil liability arising from criminal offenses committed
by their minor children under their legal authority or control,
or who live in their company, unless it is proven that the
former acted with the diligence of a good father of a family to
461

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 2180

prevent such damages. In the case at bar, whether the death
of the hapless Julie Ann Gotiong was caused by a felony or
a quasi-delict committed by Wendell Libi, respondent court
did not err in holding petitioners liable for damages arising
therefrom. Subject to the preceding modifications relied upon
by it, therefore, and on the bases of the legal imperatives
herein explained, the Court is conjoined in its findings that said
petitioners failed to duly exercise the requisite diligentissimi
patris families to prevent such damages.
(4) Owners and Managers

Phil. Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc., et al. v.
Phil. Am. Forwarders, Inc., et al.
L-25142, March 25, 1975
FACTS: An action for damages was brought against the
Phil Am Forwarders, Inc. because of the alleged negligence of
the driver. Included as defendants were the corporation, and
a certain Balingit, the manager of the corporation. A motion
was filed to dismiss the case against the manager Balingit
on the ground that while indeed he was the manager, he was
also a mere employee of the company. Now then, under the
fourth paragraph of Art. 2180, the law speaks of “owners and
managers” as being liable.

ISSUE: Should Balingit be released from the complaint?
HELD: Yes, because the term ‘manager’ in Art. 2180
(fourth paragraph) is used in the sense of employer, not
employee. Hence, there is no cause of action against Balingit.
(5) Employers
(a)

(b)

In paragraph 5, note that the employers can be liable
even if “not engaged in any business or industry." If a
complaint, therefore, makes no reference to such business
or industry, there is still a cause of action, and the
complaint should NOT be dismissed. (Ortaliz v. Echarri,
101 Phil. 947)

It should be noted, too, that paragraph 5 refers to
“employees and household helpers," not to strangers. So if

a stranger should drive another’s car without the latter’s
462

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

consent, the owner is NOT liable, even if he is engaged in
an industry. (Duquillo v. Bayot, 67 Phil. 131)
(c)

One who hires an “independent contractor” but controls
the latter’s work, is responsible also for the latter’s
negligence. (See Cuison v. Norton and Harrison Co., 55
Phil. 18)

(d)

The registered owner of a public utility vehicle continues
to be its owner if he leases it to another without the
permission of the Public Service Commission. Therefore,
even if the driver of the lessee is negligent, the registered
owner can still be held liable. (Timbol v. Osias, et al.,
96 Phil. 989; Montoya v. Ignacio, L-5868, Dec. 29, 1953)
Indeed, to exempt from liability, the owner of a public
vehicle who operates it under the “boundary system” on
the ground that he merely leases it to the driver would not
only be to abet a flagrant violation of the Public Service
Law but also to place the riding public at the mercy of
reckless and irresponsible drivers: “reckless” because the
measure of their earnings would depend largely upon the
number of trips they make and hence, the speed at which
they drive; and “irresponsible” because most, if not all of
them, are in no position to pay damages they might cause.
(Magboo v. Bernardo, L-16790, April 30, 1963)

Vinluan v. Court of Appeals
L-21477-81, April 29, 1966

FACTS: A passenger of a bus was hurt because
of the negligence of the driver of the bus as well as the
negligence of the driver of another vehicle. Who should be
liable?

HELD: According to the court, four persons are liable:
the owner of the bus, the driver of the bus, the owner of
the other vehicle, and the driver of said other vehicle
notwithstanding the
and their liability is SOLIDARY
fact that the liability of the bus company is predicated
on a CONTRACT, while the liability of the owner and
driver of the other vehicle is based on a QUASI-DELICT.
(Observation: The bus driver can be excused on the
basis of culpa contractual for the contract of common

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

carriage was not with him, but with the bus company;
nonetheless, he can be held liable on the basis of culpa
aquiliana, there being no pre-existing contract between
him and the passenger. Note also that the owner of the
other vehicle can be excused if he can prove due diligence
in the selection and supervision of his driver, under Art.
2180, last paragraph, unless at the time of the collision,
said owner was also in his vehicle, in which case,
notwithstanding due care in selection and supervision, he
would still be liable, if he could have, by use of diligence

prevented the misfortune. (See Art. 2184)

Ramos v. Pepsi-Cola
L-22533, Feb- 9, 1967

FACTS: A driver of Pepsi-Cola is admittedly
negligent in a vehicular collision. Suit was brought by the
other car owner against both the driver and Pepsi-Cola.
But Pepsi-Cola was able to prove diligence in selection ( no
culpa in eligiendo) and supervision (no culpa in vigilando)
of the driver. For instance, it was proved that Pepsi-Cola
had carefully previously examined the erring driver as
to his qualifications, record of service, and experience. Is
Pepsi-Cola still liable?

HELD: No, otherwise it would have been liable
solidarity with the driver. In Philippine torts, we do not
follow the doctrine of respondeat superior (where the
negligence of the servant is the negligence of the master).
Instead, we follow the rule of bonus pater familias (good
father of a family). The negligence of the employer here
indicated in the last paragraph of Art. 2180, is only
presumptive; it can therefore be rebutted, as in this case.

Bernardo Jocson and Maria D. Jocson v.
Redencion Glorioso
L-22686, Jan. 30, 1968

FACTS: For the death of a three-year-old boy who
was run over by a passenger jeepney, two actions were
filed by the parents: the first, against the owner and the
driver for culpa aquiliana, and the other, against the
driver for homicide through reckless imprudence, the
464

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

criminal action having been instituted while the civil case
was pending trial. The civil case was dismissed; but the
criminal case resulted in a conviction for homicide through
reckless imprudence. Aside from the prison sentence
imposed, the driver was also ordered to indemnify the
heirs of the deceased the sum of P6,000 with subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency. A writ for the
execution of the civil liability was returned unsatisfied
due to the insolvency of the accused. The parents of the
victim then sued the owner of the jeepney, pursuant to
Art. 103 of the Revised Penal Code. The owner claims that
the previous dismissal of the culpa aquiliana case should
now prevent the application of the subsidiary liability of
an owner under the Revised Penal Code. Is this claim
correct?

HELD: The claim is not correct. After all, the culpa
aquiliana case had a different cause of action from this
case involving the subsidiary liability of an employer for
an employee’s criminal act. In other words, we have the
controlling rule that once there is a conviction for a felony,
final in character, the employer, according to the plain and
explicit command of Art. 103 of the Revised Penal Code, is
subsidiarity liable, if it be shown that commission thereof
was in the discharge of the duties of such employee.
Malipol v. Tan
L-27730, Jan. 21, 1974
54 SCRA 202
(1974)

FACTS: Labsan, a driver of a gasoline tanker, used
in the business of his employer, Tan, hit a pedestrian,
causing the latter’s death. In the civil action filed by
the heirs of the victim against both Labsan and Tan, no
allegation was made that a crime had been committed.
The trial court found the driver reckless, and so it held
Tan primarily liable on the basis of a quasi-delict, without
prejudice to the right of Tan to demand reimbursement
from the driver.
ISSUE: Is the imposition of primary liability on Tan

proper?

St. Francis High School v. Court of Appeals
GR 82465, Feb. 25, 1991

FACTS: Ferdinand Castillo, a freshman student at
the St. Francis High School wanted to join a school picnic
at the beach. Ferdinand’s parents, because of short notice,
did not allow their son to join but merely allowed him to
bring food to the teachers for the picnic, with the directive
that he should go back home after doing so. However,
because of the persuasion of the teachers, Ferdinand went
on with them to the beach. During the picnic and while
the students, including Ferdinand, were in the water, one
of the female teachers was apparently drowning. Some of
the students, including Ferdinand, came to her rescue,
but in the process, it was Ferdinand himself who drowned.
Ferdinand’s parents sued the school and the teachers
for damages allegedly incurred from the death of their
13-year-old son. Contending that the death of their son
was due to the failure of defendants to exercise the proper
diligence of a good father of the family in preventing their
son’s drowning, they (Ferdinand’s parents) prayed for
actual moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees and
expenses for litigation. The trial court found in favor of
plaintiffs and against the teachers, ordering all of them
to pay plaintiffs P30.000 as actual damages, P20.000 as
moral damages, P15.000 as attorney’s fees and to pay the
costs. However, the court dismissed the case against the
school. The Court of Appeals (CA) ruled that the school
and the teachers are guilty of negligence and liable for
Ferdinand’s death.
466

Art. 2180

,
i,

HELD: The Supreme Court set aside the decision of
the Court of Appeals insofar as the school and teachers are
concerned, but the portion of the said decision dismissing
their counterclaim there being no merit, is affirmed. It
then held that if at all petitioners are liable for negligence,
this is because of their own negligence or the negligence
of people under them. Here, petitioners are neither guilty
of their own negligence or guilty of the negligence of those
under them. Hence, they cannot be said that they are
guilty at all of any negligence. Consequently, they cannot
be held liable for damages of any kind. At the outset,
Ferdinand’s parents allowed him to join the excursion.
The fact that his father gave him money to buy food for
the picnic even without knowing where it will be held, is
a sign of consent for Ferdinand to join the same. The CA
committed an error in applying Art. 2180 of the Civil Code
in rendering the school liable for the death of Ferdinand.
In the case at bar, the teachers/petitioners were not in
the actual performance of their assigned tasks. The
incident happened not within the school premises, not on
a school day and most importantly while the teachers and
students were holding a purely private affair, a picnic.
The incident happened while some members of the class
of the school were having a picnic at the beach. This
picnic had no permit from the school head or its principal
because this picnic was not a school sanctioned activity,
neither is it considered as an extra-curricular activity.
Mere knowledge by petitioner/principal of the planning
of the picnic by the students and planning of the picnic by
the students and their teachers does not in any way show
467

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

acquiescence or consent to the holding of the same. The
application, therefore, of Article 2180 has no basis in law
and neither is it supported by any jurisprudence. If we
were to affirm the findings of the appellate court on this
score, employers will forever be exposed to the risk and
danger of being hailed to court to answer for the misdeeds
or omissions of the employees even if such act or omission
be committed while they were not in the performance of
their duties. No negligence could be attributable to the
teachers to warrant the award of damages to Ferdinand’s
parents. The class adviser of the class where Ferdinand
belonged did her best and exercised diligence of a good
father of a family to prevent any untoward incident or
damages to all the students who joined the picnic. In fact,
she invited the P.E. instructors and scout masters who
have knowledge in first aid application and swimming.
Moreover, the petitioners brought life savers in case of
emergency. Petitioners did all what is humanly possible
to save the child. No moral or exemplary damages may be
awarded in favor of Ferdinand’s parents. The case does
not fall under any of the grounds to grant moral damages.
Petitioners are not guilty of any fault or negligence.
Hence, no moral damages can be assessed against them.
While it is true that Ferdinand’s parents did give their
consent to their son to join the picnic, this does not mean
that petitioners were already relieved of their duty
to observe the required diligence of a good father of a
family in ensuring the safety of the children. But here,
petitioners were able to prove that they had exercised
that required diligence. Hence, the claim for moral or

exemplary damages becomes baseless.

Figuracion Vda. de Maglana, et al. v.
Judge Francisco Z. Consolacion and
Afisco Insurance Corp.
GR 60506, Aug. 6, 1992
The liability of AFISCO based on the insurance
contract is direct, but not solidary with that of Destrajo
which is based on Art. 2180 of the Civil Code. As such,
petitioners have the option either to claim the P15,000
468

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

from AFISCO and the balance from Destrajo or enforce the
entire judgment from Destrajo, subject to reimbursement
from AFISCO to the extent of the insurance coverage.
While the petition seeks a definitive ruling only
on the nature of AFISCO’s liability, this Court noticed

that the lower court erred in the computation of the
probable loss of income. Using the formula: 2/3 of (80-56)
x P12.000, it awarded P28.800. Upon recomputation,
the correct amount is P192.000. Being a “plain error,”
this Court opt to correct the same. (Sec. 7, Rule 51, Rules
of Court) Furthermore, in accordance with prevailing
jurisprudence, the death indemnity is hereby increased to

P50.000.
Go v. Intermediate Appellate Court
GR 68138, May 13, 1991

FACTS: Floverto Jazmin, an American citizen and
retired employee of the U.S. Federal Government, had
been a visitor in the Philippines since 1972 residing in
Mangatarem, Pangasinan. As a pensionado of the U.S.
Government, he received annuity checks in the amounts
of $67 for disability and $620 for retirement through the
Mangatarem Post Office. On Aug. 22, 1975, Agustin Go,
as branch manager of Solidbank in Baguio City, allowed a
person named “Floverto Jazmin” to open Savings Account
No. BG5206 by depositing two U.S. treasury checks in the
amounts of $1810 and $910 respectively equivalent to the
total amount of P20,565.69 both payable to the order of
Floverto Jazmin of Mangatarem, Pangasinan and drawn
on the First National City Bank, Manila. The Savings
Account was opened in the ordinary course of business.
The bank, through Go, required the depositor to fill up the
information sheet for new accounts to reflect his personal
circumstances. The depositor indicated therein that he was
Floverto Jazmin with mailing address at Mangatarem,
that he was a Filipino citizen and a security officer of the
US army; that he was married to Milagros Bautista; and
that his initial deposit was P3,565. He wrote CSA 138134
under remarks or instructions and left blank the spaces
under telephone number, residence certificate, passport,
469

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

bank and trade performance as to who introduced him to
the bank. The depositor’s signature specimens were also
taken. Thereafter, the deposited checks were sent to the
drawee bank for clearance. Inasmuch as Solidbank did
not receive any word from the drawee bank, after three
weeks it allowed the depositor to withdraw the amount
indicated in the checks. On June 29, 1976, or more than
a year later, the two dollar checks were returned with
notation that the amounts were altered. So Go reported
the matter to the Philippine Constabulary in Baguio
City. On Aug. 3, 1976, Jazmin received radio messages
requiring him to appear before the PC headquarters in
Benguet for investigation regarding the complaint filed
by Go against him for estafa. Initially, Jazmin was
investigated by the constabulary officers in Lingayen, and
later in La Trinidad. Eventually, the investigators found
that the person named “Floverto Jazmin” who made the
deposit and withdrawal with Solidbank was an impostor.
Floverto Jazmin’s name was used by a syndicate to encash
the checks. On Sept. 23, 1976, Jazmin sued Agustin Go
and the Solidbank for moral and exemplary damages in
the amount of P90.000 plus attorney’s fees. The trial court
ordered Go and CBTC to pay Jazmin P6.000 as moral
damages, P3,000 as exemplary damages and P1.000 as
attorney’s fees. The appellate court disallowed the moral
and exemplary damages and granted nominal damages.

HELD: The Supreme Court affirmed the decision
of the Court of Appeals and held that here, the damages
in the form of mental anguish, moral shock and social
humiliation were suffered by Jazmin only after the filing
of Go’s complaint with the PC. It was only then that he
had to bear the inconvenience of traveling to Benguet
and Lingayen for the investigation as it was only then
that he was subjected to embarrassment for being a
suspect in the unauthorized alteration of the treasury
checks. Hence, it is understandable why Go appears to
have overlooked the factors antecedent to the filing of the
complaint to the Constabulary authorities and to have to
put undue emphasis on the appellate court’s statement
that “denouncing a crime is not negligence.” Although
470

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

there should be no penalty on the right to litigate and
error alone in the filing of a case be it before the courts
or the proper police authorities, is not a ground for moral
damages, under the peculiar circumstances of this case,
Jazmin is entitled to an award of damages. It would
be unjust to overlook the fact that Go’s negligence was
the root of all the inconvenience and embarrassment
experienced by Jazmin, albeit they happened after the
filing of the complaint with the Constabulary authorities.
Go’s negligence in fact led to the swindling of his employer.
Had Go exercised the diligence expected of him as a bank
officer he would have noticed the disparity between
the payee’s name and address on the treasury checks
involved and the name of the depositor appearing in the
bank’s records. The situation would have been different
if the treasury checks were tampered with only as to
their amounts because the alteration would have been
unnoticeable and hard to detect as the herein altered
check bearing the amount of $913 shows. But the error in
the name and address of the payee was patent and could
not have escaped the trained eyes of bank officers and
employees. Hence, the bank through its employees was
grossly negligent in handling the business transaction
herein.
In crimes and quasi-delicts, the defendant shall be
liable for all damages which are the natural and probable
consequences of the act or omission complained of. It is not
necessary that such damages have been foreseen or could
have reasonably been foreseen by the defendant. As Go’s
negligence was the root of the complained inconvenience
and embarrassment, Go is liable to Jazmin for damages.
Under the fifth paragraph of Art. 2180 of the Civil Code,
employers shall be liable for the damages caused by their
employees acting within the scope of their assigned tasks.
Pursuant to this provision, the bank is responsible for the
acts of its employee, unless there is proof that it exercised
the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent the
damage. Hence, the burden of proof lies upon the bank
and it cannot disclaim liability in view of its own failure
to prove not only that it exercised due diligence to prevent
471

damage but that it was not negligent in the selection and
supervision of its employees.
George Mckee and Ararelo Koh Mckee v.
Intermediate Appellate Court, Jaime
Tayag and Rosalinda Manalo
GR 68102, July 16, 1992

In the case at bar, as employers of the truck driver,
the private respondents are, under Art. 2180 of the Civil
Code, directly and primarily liable for the resulting
damages. The presumption that they are negligent flows
from the negligence of their employee. That presumption,
however, is only juris tantum, not juris et de jure. Their
only possible defense is that they exercised all the diligence
of a good father of a family to prevent the damage.
The diligence of a good father referred to means that
diligence in the selection and supervision of employees.
The answers of the private respondents in Civil Cases
Nos. 4477 and 4478 did not interpose this defense. Neither
did they attempt to prove it.

San Miguel Corp. v. Heirs of Sabiano
Inguito and Julius Ouano
GR 141716, July 4, 2002

FACTS: San Miguel Corp. (SMC) entered into a
Time Charter Party Agreement with Julius Ouano, doing
business under the name and style J. Ouano Marine
Services. Under the terms of the agreement, SMC
chartered the M/V Dona Roberta owned by Julius Ouano
for a period of two years, from July 1, 1989 to May 31,
1991, for the purpose of transporting SMC’s beverage
products from its Mandaue City plant to various points in
Visayas and Mindanao.
On Nov. 11, 1990, during the term of the charter,
SMC issued sailing orders to the Master of the M/V Dofia
Roberta, Capt. Sabiano Inguito. In accordance thereto,
Inguito obtained the necessary sailing clearance from the
Philippine Coast Guard. Loading of the cargo on the M/V
472

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

Dona Roberta was completed at 8:30 p.m. of Nov. 11, 1990.
However, the vessel did not leave Mandaue City until 6 a.m.
of the following day, Nov. 12, 1990. Meanwhile at 4 a.m. of
Nov. 12, 1990, typhoon Ruping was spotted moving in the
general direction of Eastern Visayas. At 7 a.m., Nov. 12,
1990, one hour after the M/V Dona Roberta departed from
Mandaue City, SMC Radio Operator Rogelio P. Moreno
contacted Inguito through radio and advised him to take
shelter. The latter replied that the ship will proceed since
the typhoon was far away anyway. At 2 p.m. that same
day, while the vessel was two kms., Abeam Boljoon Pt.,
Moreno again communicated with Inguito and advised
him to take shelter. The captain responded that the ship
can manage. Hearing this, Moreno immediately tried to
get in touch with Rico Ouano to tell him that Inguito did
not heed their advice. Rico was out of his office, however,
so Moreno left the message with the secretary.
Again Moreno contacted Inguito at 4 p.m. of Nov. 12,
1990. By then the vessel was already 9.5 miles southeast
of Balicasag Island heading towards Sulauan Pt. Moreno
reiterated the advice and pointed out it will be difficult
to take shelter after passing Balicasag Island as the ship
was approaching an open sea. Still, the captain refused
to heed his advice. At 8 p.m., the vessel was 38 miles
southeast of Balicasag Island, and Westsouth winds were
now prevailing. At 10 p.m., the M/V Dona Roberta was
25 miles approaching Sulauan Pt. Moments later, power
went out in Moreno’s office and resumed at 11:40 p.m.
He immediately made a series of calls to the M/V Dofia
Roberta but he failed to get in touch with anyone in the
vessel.

At 1:15 a.m., Nov. 13, 1990, Inguito called Moreno
over the radio and requested him to contact Rico, son of
Julius Ouano, because a helicopter is needed to provide
rescue. The vessel was about 20 miles west of Sulauan
Pt. Upon being told by SMC’s radio operator, Rico turned
on his radio and read the distress signal from Inguito.
When he talked to the captain, the latter requested for
a helicopter to provide rescue. Rico talked to the Chief

Engineer who informed him that the crew can no longer
stop the water from coming into the vessel because the
crew members were feeling dizzy from petroleum fumes.
At 2:30 a.m. of Nov. 13, 1990, WV Dona Roberta sank.
Out of the 25 officers and crew on board the vessel, only
five survived. On Nov. 24, 1990, shipowner Julius Ouano,
in lieu of the captain who perished in the sea tragedy, filed
a Marine Protest. Heirs of the deceased captain and crew,
as well as survivors of the ill-fated M/V Dona Roberta
filed a complaint for tort against SMC and Julius Ouano
at the RTC of Lapu-Lapu City, Br. 27. Julius Ouano filed
am answer with crossclaim, alleging that the proximate
cause of the loss of the vessel and its officers and crew
was the fault and negligence of SMC, which had complete
control and disposal of the vessel as charterer and which
issued the sailing order for its departure despite being
forewarned of the impending typhoon. Thus, he prayed
that SMC indemnify him for the cost of the vessel and the
unrealized rentals and earnings thereof.

and Ouano filed separate motions for reconsideration,
which were denied by the CA for lack of merit.

SMC countered that it was Ouano who had the
control, supervision, and responsibilities over the vessel’s
navigation. This notwithstanding, and despite knowledge
of the incoming typhoon, Ouano never bothered to initiate
contact with his vessel. Contrary to his allegation, SMC
argued that the proximate cause of the sinking was
Ouano’s breach of his obligation to provide SMC with
a seaworthy vessel duly manned by competent crew
members. SMC interposed counterclaims against Ouano
for the value of the cargo lost in the sea tragedy. After
trial, the court a quo rendered judgment finding that the
proximate cause of the loss of the M/V Dona Roberta was
attributable to SMC. Both SMC and Ouano appealed to
the Court of Appeals (CA). SMC argued that as mere
charterer, it did not have control of the vessel and that the
proximate cause of the loss of the vessel and its cargo was
the negligence of the ship captain. For his part, Ouano
complained of the reduced damages awarded to him by
the trial court. On Dec. 10, 1998, the CA modified the
decision appealed from, declaring defendant-appellants

The fact that there was an approaching typhoon is
of no moment. It appears that for one previous occasion,
SMC issued a sailing order to the captain of the M/V
Doha Roberta, but the vessel cancelled its voyage due
to a typhoon. Likewise, it appears from the records that
SMC issued the sailing order on Nov. 12, 1990, before the
typhoon, “Ruping” was first spotted at 4 a.m. of Nov. 12,
1990. Consequently, Ouano should answer for the loss of
lives and damages suffered by heirs of the officers and
crew members who perished on board the M/V Dona
Roberta, except Capt. Inguito. The award of damages
granted by the CA is affirmed only against Ouano, who
should also indemnify SMC for the cost of the lost cargo,
in the total amount of P10,278,542.40.

SMC and Julian C. Ouano jointly and severally liable to

474

ISSUE: Under Arts. 1176 and 2180, owners
and managers are responsible for damages caused by
negligence of a servant or an employee, the master
or employer is presumed to be negligent either in the
selection or in the supervision of that employee. May this
presumption be overcome? If so, how?
HELD: Yes. This presumption may be overcome only
by satisfactorily showing that the employer exercised
the care and diligence of a good father of a family in the
selection and supervision of its employee. (PestaHo v.
Sumayang, 346 SCRA 870 [2000])

In the instant case, the Supreme Court does not find
the SMC liable for the losses incurred. The contention
that it was the issuance of the sailing order by SMC which
was the proximate cause of the sinking is untenable.

‘Charter Party Distinguished from‘Affreightment
A charter party is a contract by virtue of which the
owner or agent of a vessel binds himself to transport
merchandise or persons for a fixed price. It has also been
defined as a contract by virtue of which the owner or the
agent of the vessel leases for a certain price the whole
475

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

or a portion of the vessel for the transportation of goods
or persons from one port to another. (SMC v. Heirs of S.
Inguito & J. Ouano, supra)
It may either be a: (1) bareboat or demise charter or
(2) contract of affreightment. Under a demise or bareboat
charter, the charterer mans the vessel with his own
people and becomes, in effect, the owner of the ship for
the voyage or service stipulated, subject to liability for
damages caused by negligence. (Caltex [Phils.], Inc. v.
Sulpicio Lines, Inc., 315 SCRA 709 [1999])
In a contract of affreightment, upon the other hand,
the owner of the vessel leases part or all of its space to
haul goods for others. It is a contract for special service
to be rendered by the owner of the vessel. Under such
contract the ship owner retains the possession, command
and navigation of the ship, the charterer or freighter
merely having use of the space in the vessel in return for
his payment of the charter hire. (National Food Authority
v. CA, 311 SCRA 700 [1999]) Otherwise put, a contract
of affreightment is one by which the owner of a ship or
other vessel lets the whole or part of her to a merchant or
other person for the conveyance of goods, on a particular
voyage, in consideration of the payment of freight. (SMC
v. Heirs of Inguito & Ouano, supra)
A contract of affreightment may be either time
charter, wherein the leased vessel is leased to the charter
for a fixed period of time, or voyage charter, wherein
the ship is leased for a single voyage. In both cases, the
charterer provides for the hire of the vessel only, either for
a determinate period of time or for a simple or consecutive
voyage, the ship owner to supply the ship’s store, pay
for the wages of the master of the crew, and defray the

expenses for the maintenance of the ship. (Ibid.)

If the charter is a contract of affreightment, which
leaves the general owners in possession of the ship as
owner for the voyage, the rights and responsibilities of
ownership rest on the owner. The charterer is free from
liability to third persons in respect of the ship. (Caltex

Under what is known as the emergency rule, one who
suddenly finds himself in a place of danger, and is required
to act without time to consider the best means that may

of negligence, if he fails to adopt what subsequently and
upon reflection may appear to have been a better method,
unless the emergency in which he finds himself is brought
about by his own negligence.

‘Labor-Only’ Contracting

Napocor v. Court of Appeals
GR 119121, Aug. 14, 1998

FACTS: A vehicle owned by a company and driven by
a driver supplied by the “labor-only” contractor figured in
an accident and both were sued by the heirs of the victims.
Petitioner Napocor insists that the responsibilities of the
employer contemplated in a “labor-only” contract should
be restricted to the workers and cannot be expanded to
cover liabilities for damages to third persons resulting
from the employee’s tortious acts under Art. 2180 of the
Civil Code that provides that employers are liable for
the damages caused by their employees and household
helpers acting within the scope of their assigned tasks.
Petitioner theorizes that its liability is limited only to
compliance with the substantive labor provisions on
and does not
working conditions, rest periods, wages
extend to liabilities suffered by third persons.

—

HELD: Napocor’s position is incorrect since the
action brought by the heirs of the victims of the vehicular
accident was premised on the recovery of damages as a
result of a quasi-delict against both Napocor and Phesco.
Hence, it is the Civil Code and not the Labor Code that
is the applicable law. The present controversy is not a
labor dispute on conditions of employment between an
477

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(6) Liability of Teachers and Heads of Establishment (of
Arts and Trades)

employee and an employer. It is a claim for damages for
injury caused by the negligent acts of an employee and his
employer.

1 ।

..

Under the factual milieu of the case, respondent
Phesco, Inc. was engaged in “labor-only” contracting visa-vis petitioner Napocor and as such, it is considered
merely an agent of the latter. Hence, Napocor is deemed
liable. “Labor-only” contracting, as defined under Sec. 9(b),
Rule VII, Book III of the Omnibus Rules Implementing
the Labor Code, is prohibited and the person acting as
contractor shall be considered merely as an agent or
intermediary of the employer who shall be responsible to
the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter
were directly employed by him. Nonetheless, petitioner
Napocor could have disclaimed liability had it raised the
defense of due diligence in the selection or supervision
of respondent Phesco and the truck driver. In the same
Art. 2180 of the Civil Code, the responsibility of the
employer ceases when it can prove that it observed all the
diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damages.
For unknown reasons, however, petitioner Napocor did
not invoke said defense. By opting not to present any
evidence that it exercised due diligence in the supervision
of the activities of respondent Phesco and the driver, it
foreclosed its right to interpose the same on appeal in
conformity with the rule that points of laws, theories,
issues of facts, and arguments not raised in lower court
cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.

ISSUE: For damages suffered by a third party, may
an action based on quasi-delict prosper against Filcar, a
rent-a-car company, and, consequently, its insurer, for
fault or negligence of the car lessee in driving the rented
vehicle?

HELD: No. Filcar being engaged in a rent-a-car
business was only the owner of the car leased to DahlJensen. As such, there was no vinculum juris between
then employer and employee. Filcar cannot in any way
be responsible for the negligent act of Dahl-Jensen, the
former not being an employer of the latter.

{

FACTS: During recess-time, one student of a technical,
(trade, vocational) school fatally injured another at the school’s
laboratory room. Are the president of the school and the

instructor concerned liable for the death of the student?

HELD: Yes, they are liable under the provisions of Art.
2180 of the Civil Code. The clause used in said article “so long
as they remain in their custody” does not necessarily refer
to the custody over students boarding in dormitories of the
school (as erroneously referred to in a previous case) but to
the protective and supervisory custody that the school and its
heads or teachers exercise over the pupils and students for as
long as they are at attendance in school and includes recess¬
time. To avoid liability, the school officials concerned should
have proved “that they observed all the diligence of a good
father of a family to prevent damage.” Said school officials and
teachers incidentally are liable even if the students or pupils
are no longer minors.

While a school is obliged to afford its students a fair
opportunity to complete the courses they seek to pursue,

Pasco v.CFI

GR 54357, April 25, 1987
FACTS: Reynaldo, together with two companions, while
walking inside the campus of Araneta University, after
attending classes in said University, was accosted and mauled
by a group of Muslim students led by Teng. The Muslim group
479

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

were also students of the Araneta University. Reynaldo was
stabbed by Teng and as a consequence, he was hospitalized
and he underwent surgery to save his life. In a suit by
Reynaldo against Teng for damages, the Araneta University
was impleaded as a party defendant based on Art. 2180. The
trial court, on motion of Araneta University, dismissed the
complaint as to said defendant.

ISSUE: Is the provision of the penultimate par. of Art.
2180 which states that “teachers or heads of establishment
’ of arts and trades shall be liable for damages caused by their
pupils and students or apprentices, so long as they remain in
their custody” equally applicable to academic institutions?

—

HELD- The answer is in the negative. The provision
concerned speaks only of “teachers or heads.”
(7) Liability of the State

A State’s liability has two aspects:

Its public or government aspects (here it is liable for the
tortious acts of special agents only.)
(b) Its private or business aspects (as when it engages in
here it is liable as an ORDINARY
private enterprises
EMPLOYER). (See Palma v. Garciano, et al., L7240, May
16, 1956)

MMTC and Apolinario Ajoc v.
Court of Appeals, Etc.
GR 141089, Aug. 1, 2002
• i

FACTS: Petitioner MMTC contends that the Court
of Appeals (CA) erred in finding it solidarity liable for
damages with its driver/employee, Ajoc, pursuant to Art.
2180. It argues that Ajoc’s act in bringing the victim to a
hospital reflects MMTC’s diligence in the selection and
supervision of its drivers, particularly with regard to
safety measures. Hence, having exercised the diligence of
a good father of a family in the selection and supervision
of its employees to prevent damage, MMTC should not be
held vicariously liable.
480

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

HELD: The claim that Ajoc’s act of bringing the
victim to the nearest medical facility shows adequate
supervision by MMTC over its employees deserves but
scant consideration. For one, the act was after the fact
of negligence on Ajoc’s part. For another, evidence on
record shows that Ajoc’s act was neither voluntary nor
spontaneous; he had to be prevailed upon by the victim’s
companions to render assistance to his victim.
Suffice it to say, owners of public utilities fall within
the scope of Art. 2180. MMTC is a public utility, organized
and owned by the government for public transport
service. Hence, its liability to private respondents, for the
negligent and reckless acts of its driver, Ajoc, under Art.
2180 is both manifest and clear.
Victor Orquiola and Honorata Orquiola v.
Court of Appeals, etc.
GR 141463, Aug. 6, 2002

FACTS: Petitioner-spouses purchased the subject
land in 1964 from Mariano Lising. The spouses acquired
the land in question without knowledge of any defect in
the title of Lising. Shortly afterwards, they built their
conjugal home on said land. It was only in 1998, when
the sheriff of Quezon City tried to execute the judgment
in Civil Case Q-12918, that they had notice to private
respondent’s adverse claim
ISSUE: Can the institution of Civil Case Q-12918
serve as notice of such adverse claim to petitioners?

HELD: No. It cannot since petitioner-spouses were
not impleaded therein as parties. As builders in good faith
and innocent purchases for value, petitioners have rights
over the subject property and, hence, are proper parties
in interest in any case thereon. (Sec. 2, Rule 3, Rules of
Court) Consequently, private respondents should have
impleaded them in Civil Case Q-12918. Since they failed
to do so, petitioners cannot be reached by the decision in
said case. No man shall be affected by any proceeding to
which he is a stranger, and strangers to a case are not
bound by any judgment rendered by the court.
481

Art. 2180

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

In the same manner, a writ of execution can be issued
only against a party and not against one who did not
have his day in court. Only real parties in interest in an
action are bound by the judgment therein and by writs of

execution and demolition issued pursuant thereto. Thus,
Spouses Victor and Honorata Orquiola have valid and
meritorious cause to resists the demolition of their house
on their titled lot, which is tantamount to a deprivation of
property without due process of law.
(8) Special Agent
(a)

This is a government employee who commits a tort while
performing a job or act foreign to his usual duties. (See
Merritt v. Government, 34 Phil. 311)

In Republic v. Palacio (L-20322, May 29, 1968), the
Supreme Court held that the State is liable only for torts
caused by its special agents specially commissioned to
carry out the acts of which the torts arise, and which acts
are OUTSIDE of the REGULAR DUTIES of said special
agents.
(b)

Hence, when the damage has been caused by the official
upon whom properly devolved the doing of the act
performed, the State (both central and local governments)
is NOT liable. Where therefore the plaintiffs father was
run over by a truck driven by a chauffeur of the provincial
government of a province, and at the time of the accident,
he was driving a vehicle in compliance with his duties as
such, his employer is NOT liable for the plaintiffs claim.
The chauffeur alone is liable. (Palafox v. Ilocos Norte, et
al., L-10659, Jan. 31, 1958) The same principle applies to
a chauffeur of the Philippine General Hospital (Merritt v.
Gov’t., 34 Phil. 311), or to any employee of a branch of the
government performing his usual duties. (Rosell v. Aud.Gen., 81 Phil. 453)
(NOTE: In the case of Palma v. Garciano, et al.,
it was held that if a governor and a mayor file criminal
charges which are groundless, their acts cannot have
borne the approval of the province and the municipality;
hence, these political subdivisions cannot be liable.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

Moreover, the prosecution of crimes is NOT corporate but
governmental or political in character. In the discharge of
functions of this nature, municipal corporations are not
liable for the acts of its officers, except if and when, and
only to the extent that, they have acted by authority of
law and in conformity with the requirement thereof.)
Republic v. Palacio
L-20322, May 29, 1968

FACTS: Ildefonso Ortiz filed a complaint against a
government entity (the Irrigation Service Unit) alleging
that said entity had induced the Handong Irrigation
Association to occupy and possess the land of Ortiz.
As a consequence of the complaint, the funds of the
entity (deposited at the Philippine National Bank) was
garnished. There was no proof, however, that the State
had specifically commissioned the entity to make the
tortious inducement.

ISSUES:
(a) Is the government here liable, for the acts of the
Irrigation Service Unit?
(b) Assuming that there is liability may there be a levy
of execution against the funds deposited by the
entity with the PNB?

HELD:
(a) The government is not liable for no authorization
was ever given to its alleged “special agent.” If there
had been such authorization, there would have
been liability for then the acts authorized are NOT
REGULARLY performed by the entity.
(b) Assuming that there is liability, the Court’s power
ends with the promulgation of the judgment.
Execution cannot issue on a judgment against the
State. After all, the State should be regarded as
free to determine whether or not it will honor the
judgment by payment. The presumption of course is
that the State will honor and respect the judgment,

482
483

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

and this can be done when Congress, recognizing the
finality of the judgment, enacts a legislative measure
providing for the satisfaction of the judgment.

(11) Failure of Doctor to Follow Medical Procedure is a Clear
Indicia of Negligence

Erlinda Ramos v. Court of Appeals
GR 124354, April 11, 2002

(9) Defense
(a)

Art. 2180

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

If an employee (or ward or minor child, etc.) is found
negligent, it is presumed that the employer (or person in
charge) was negligent in selecting and/or supervising him
for it is hard for the victim to prove the negligence of such
employer. It is impossible for the victim to have observed
the conduct of all employers, etc. who are potential
tortfeasors. (See Campo, et al. v. Comarote & Gemilga,
L-9147, Nov. 29, 1956)

In Campo v. Camarote and Gemilga (supra), it was held
that the mere fact that the driver was a professional
one does not show sufficient diligence on the part of the
employer. The employer should not have been satisfied
with the mere possession by his driver of a professional
driver’s license; he had the duty to examine thoroughly
the qualifications, experience, and record of the driver.
(c) Even if the employer can prove the diligence in the
selection and supervision of the employee, still if he
ratifies the wrongful acts, or take no steps to avert further
damage, he (the employer) would still be liable. (See
Maxion v. Manila Railroad Co., 44 Phil. 597)
(b)

(10) Penal Provisions in Case of Crimes

Article 365, par. 3 of the Revised Penal Code simply
means that if there is only damage to property, the amount
fixed therein shall be imposed, but if there are also physical
injuries there should be an additional penalty for the latter.
The information cannot be split into two; one for physical
injuries and another for the damage to property, for both the
injuries, and the damage committed were caused by one single
act of the defendant and constituted what may be called a
complex crime of physical injuries and damage to property. It
is clear that the fine fixed by the law in this case is beyond
the jurisdiction of the municipal court and within that of the
Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court). (People v.
Villanueva, L-15014, April 29, 1961)
484

FACTS: Private respondents De Los Santos Medical
Center (DLSMC), Dr. Orlino Hosaka, and Dr. Perfects
Gutierrez
were held civilly liable for petitioner Erlinda
Ramos’ comatose condition after she delivered herself to them
for their professional care and management.
The Philippine College of Surgeon (PSC) filed its petition¬
in-intervention contending in the main that the court erred
in holding private respondent Dr. Hosaka liable under the
Captain-of-the-Ship Doctrine. For the intervenor, said doctrine
had long been abandoned in the United States in recognition of
the developments in modern medical and hospital practice.
For his part, Dr. Hosaka mainly contends that the court
erred in finding him negligent as a surgeon by applying the
Captain-of-the-Ship Doctrine. Dr. Hosaka argues that the
trend in U.S. jurisprudence has been to reject said doctrine in
light of developments in medical practice. He points out that
anesthesiology and surgery are two distinct and specialized
fields in medicine and as a surgeon, he is not deemed to have
control over the acts of Dr. Gutierrez. As anesthesiologist,
Dr. Gutierrez is a specialist in her field and has acquired
skills and knowledge in the course of her training which Dr.
Hosaka, as a surgeon, does not possess. He states further that
current American jurisprudence on the matter recognizes
that the trend towards specialization in medicine has created
situations where surgeons do not always have the right to
control all personnel within the operating room, especially a
fellow specialist.

—

Dr. Gutierrez maintains that the court erred in finding
her negligent and in holding that it was the faulty intubation
which was the proximate cause of Erlinda’s comatose condition.
The following objective facts allegedly negate a finding of
negligence on her part:
1. That the outcome of the procedure was a comatose
patient and not a dead one;
485

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

2.
3.

That the patient had a cardiac arrest; and
That the patient was revived from that cardiac

arrest.
In effect, Dr. Gutierrez, insists that, contrary to the
finding of the court, the intubation she performed on Erlinda
was successful. The instruments used in the administration
of anesthesia, including the endotracheal tube, were all under
the exclusive control of private respondents Dr. Gutierrez and

Dr. Hosaka.
Meanwhile, the hospital, DLSMC, argues that it cannot
be deemed liable for the resulting injury to petitioner Erlinda.
DLSMC contends that applying the four-fold test in determining
whether such a relationship exists between it and respondent
doctors, it (DLSMC) cannot be considered an employer of
respondent doctors. The four-fold test in determining whether
an employer-employee relationship exists between the parties
are the following:

selection and engagement of services;
payment of wages;
3. power to hire and fire; and
4. power to control not only the end to be achieved, but
the means to be used in reaching such an end.
On the 1st test, DLSMC maintains that a hospital does not
hire or engage the services of a consultant, but rather, accredits
the latter and grants him or her the privilege of maintaining
a clinic and/or admitting patients in the hospital upon a
showing by the consultant that he or she possess the necessary
qualifications, such as accreditation by the appropriate board
(diplomata), evidence of fellowship and references.
On the 2nd test, it is not the hospital but the patient who
pays the consultant’s fee for services rendered by the latter.
On the 3rd test, a hospital does not dismiss a consultant;
instead, the latter may lose his or her accreditation or privileges
granted by the hospital.
1.
2.

On the 4th and last test, DLSMC argues that when a
doctor refers a patient for admission in a hospital, it is the
486

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

doctor who prescribes the treatment to be given to said patient.
The hospital’s obligation is limited to providing the patient
with the preferred room accommodation, the nutritional diet
and medications prescribed by the doctor, the equipment and
facilities necessary for the patient’s treatment, as well as the
services of the hospital staff who perform the ministerial tasks
of ensuring that the doctor’s orders are carried out strictly.
ISSUES: (1) Whether or not Dr. Hosaka (surgeon)
is liable for negligence; (2) Whether or not Dr. Gutierrez
(anesthesiologist) is liable for negligence; and (3) Whether or
not the hospital (DLSMC) is liable for any act of negligence
committed by their visiting consultant-surgeon and
anesthesiologist.

HELD: (1) That there is a trend in American jurisprudence
to do away with the Captain-of-the-Ship doctrine does not
mean that the Supreme Court will ipso facto follow said trend.
Due regard for the peculiar factual circumstances obtaining
in this case justify the application of the Captain-of-the-Ship
Doctrine. From the facts on record, it can be logically inferred
that Dr. Hosaka exercised a certain degree of, at the very
least, supervision over the procedure then being performed on
Erlinda. Thus:
a. It was Dr. Hosaka who recommended to petitioner the
services of Dr. Gutierrez. In effect, he represented to petitioner
that Dr. Gutierrez possessed the necessary competence and
skills. Drs. Hosaka and Gutierrez had worked together since
1977. Whenever Dr. Hosaka performed a surgery, he would
always engage the services of Dr. Gutierrez to administer the
anesthesia on his patient.
b. Dr. Hosaka himself admitted that he was the
attending physician of Erlinda. When Erlinda showed signs of
cyanosis, it was Dr. Hosaka who gave instructions to call for
another anesthesiologist and cardiologist to help resuscitate

Erlinda.
c. It is conceded that in performing their responsibilities
to the patient, Dr. Hosaka and Gutierrez worked as a
team. Their work cannot be placed in separate watertight
compartments because their duties intersect with each other.
487

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

The duties of Dr. Hosaka and those of Dr. Gutierrez in the
treatment of petitioner Erlinda are, therefore, not a clearcut

as respondents claim them to be. On the contrary, it is quite
apparent that they have a common responsibility to treat the
patient, which responsibility necessitates that they call each
other’s attention to the condition of the patient while the other
physician is performing the necessary medical procedures.

It is important to point out that Dr. Hosaka was remiss
in his duty of attending to petitioner Erlinda promptly, for he
arrived more than three hours late for the scheduled operation.
In reckless disregard for his patient’s well-being, Dr. Hosaka
scheduled two procedures on the same day, just 30 minutes
apart from each other, at different hospitals. When the first
procedure (protoscopy) at the Sta. Teresita Hospital did not
proceed on time, Erlinda was kept in a state of uncertainty at
the DLSMC. The long period that Dr. Hosaka made Erlinda
wait for him caused anxiety that adversely affected the
administration of anesthesia on her. A patient’s anxiety usually
causes the outpouring of adrenaline which, in turn, results in
high blood pressure or disturbances in the heart rhythm. Dr.
Hosaka’s irresponsible conduct of arriving very late for the
scheduled operation of petitioner Erlinda is violative, not only
of his duty as a physician “to serve the interest of his patients
with the greatest solicitude, giving them always his best talent
and skill,” but also of Art. 19 of the Civil Code which requires a
person, in the performance of his duties, to act with justice and
give everyone his due.
(2) It was the faulty intubation on Erlinda that caused
her comatose condition. There is no question that Erlinda
became comatose after Dr. Gutierrez performed a medical
procedure on her. Even the counsel of Dr. Gutierrez admitted
to the fact during the oral arguments.

The cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin or mucous
membranes caused by lack of oxygen or abnormal hemoglobin
in the blood) and enlargement of the stomach of Erlinda indicate
that the endotracheal tube was improperly inserted into the
esophagus instead of the trachea. Consequently, oxygen was
delivered not to the lungs but to the gastrointestinal tract. This
conclusion is supported by the fact that Erlinda was placed
in Trendelenburg position. This indicates that there was a
488

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2180

decrease of blood supply to the patient’s brain. The brain was,
thus, temporarily deprived of oxygen supply causing Erlinda to
go into coma.

The injury occurred by petitioner Erlinda does not
normally happen absent any negligence in the administration
of anesthesia and in the use of an endotracheal tube. In Voss
v. Bridweld (364 P2d 955 [1961]), the Kansas Supreme Court
applied the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, reasoning that the
ipjury to the patient therein was one which does not ordinarily
take place in the absence of negligence in the administration
of an anesthetic, and in the use and employment of an
endotracheal tube. The court went to say: “Ordinarily, a person
being put under anesthesia is not rendered decerebrate as a
consequence of administering such anesthesia in the absence

of negligence.”

(3) Respondent hospital’s position on this issue is
meritorious. There is no employer-employee relationship
between DLSMC and Drs. Gutierrez and Hosaka which
would hold DLSMC solidarily liable for the injury suffered by
petitioner Erlinda under Art. 2180 of the Civil Code. Moreover,
the contract between the consultant in respondent hospital and
his patient is separate and distinct from the contract between
respondent hospital and said patient.

No evidence was adduced to show that the injury suffered
by petitioner Erlinda was due to failure on the part of the
respondent DLSMC to provide for hospital facilities and staff
necessary for her treatment.
Apropos to the award of damages to petitioner in view
of the supervening event of the former’s death, the amount
representing actual (Pl,325,000), moral and exemplary
damages, attorney’s fees, and costs of suit should be awarded

to petitioner.

To ascertain who among the pilots of aircraft involved in

the applicable rules governing the specific traffic management
of aircrafts at an airport. The Rules of the Air Transportation
Office (ATO) apply to all aircrafts registered in the Philippines.
Since the pilots-in-command have the final authority as to

occurs, pass the blame to the ATO for issuing clearances that
turn out to be unsuitable.

i’* U- ’

Marcial T. Caedo, et al. v.
Yu Khe Thai, et al.
L-20392, Dec. 18, 1968

.

FACTS: Marcial T. Caedo and the members of his family
were injured when their Mercury car was hit on Highway 54 by
a Cadillac car owned by Yu Khe Thai, and driven by the latter’s
driver, Rafael Bernardo. According to the facts, the accident
was due to Bernardo’s trying to overtake a carretela in front of
the Cadillac. There was therefore no question about Bernardo’s
negligence. Now then, would the owner Yu Khe Thai be held
solidarily liable inasmuch as he was in the car at the time of
the collision? (It was proved that the driver had been driving
for over 20 years, and had no record of an accident; at the time
of the collision, he was driving at moderate speed).
HELD: Under the facts given, the owner had no negligence
either in employing the driver, or in supervising the driver
at or before the time of the accident. Hence, he is not liable
at all, much less solidarily liable. It is true that under Art.
2184 of the Civil Code, “In motor vehicle mishaps, the owner
is solidarily liable with his driver if the former, who was in
the vehicle, could have, by the use of due diligence, prevented
the misfortune. It is disputably presumed that a driver was
negligent, if he had been found guilty of reckless driving or
violating traffic regulations at least twice within the preceding
two months.”
The basis of the master’s liability in civil law is not
respondeat superior but rather, the relationship of pater
familias. The theory is that ultimately the negligence of the
servant, if known to the master and susceptible of timely
correction by him, reflects his own negligence if he fails to
correct it in order to prevent injury or damage. There is no
such negligence here as the imputed negligence is necessarily
subjective
depending invariably on the car-driving ability
of the master himself. As a matter of fact, many car owners
precisely hire drivers since the former for one reason or another
cannot drive their cars themselves. Hence, the care or vigilance
demanded of them cannot be uniform; each case must stand on
its own.

gent if, at the time of the mishap, he was violating any traffic
regulation

In the case at bar, Paman’s act of driving on the wrong
side of the road, in an attempt to overtake the motorcycle
driven by Arambala, and suddenly crossing the path which
is being traversed by the latter, is sheer negligence.

Art 2186. Every owner of a motor vehicle shall file
with the proper government office a bond executed by a
government controlled corporation or office, to answer for
damages to third persons. The amount of the bond and other
terms shall be fixed by the competent public official.

(2) The Doctrine of Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

Art. 2188. There isprima facie presumption of negligence
on the part of the defendant if the death or injury results
from his possession of dangerous weapons or substances,
such as firearms and poison, except when the possession or
use thereof is indispensable in his occupation or business.

If a pedestrian falls into a manhole in a city street
(Manila), the Supreme Court has ruled that the City
Government would be liable under this Article despite
the fact that under the Revised Charter of Manila, the
City incurs no liability. While the Charter of Manila is
a special law insofar as territory is involved, still this

The liability of public corporations for damages arising
from injuries suffered by pedestrians from the defective
condition of roads extends to the fact that it is not even necessary
for such defective road or street to belong to the province,

requires that either control or supervision is exercised over the

Art. 2194

Malvar v. Kraft Food

Joint tortfeasors are those who command, instigate,
promote, encourage, advise, countenance, cooperate in, aid or

done, if so done for their benefit.
(4) Extent of Liability of Tortfeasors

Where the injury is due to the concurrent negligence of
the drivers of the colliding vehicles, the drivers and owners of
said vehicles shall be primarily, directly and solidarity liable
for damages and it is immaterial that one action is based on
quasi-delict and the other on culpa contractual.

Joint tortfeasors are each liable as principals, to the same
extent and in the same manner as if they had performed the
wrongful at themselves.
Under Art. 2194, joint tortfeasors are solidary liable for
the resulting damage. In short, they are jointly and severally
liable for the whole amount.

ISSUE: Can a contractual obligation be breached by tort?
HELD: Yes, and when the same act or omission causes the
injury, one resulting in culpa contractual and the other culpa
acquiliana, Art. 2194 can well apply. (Air France v. Carrascoso,
124 Phil. 722)
In fine, a liability for tort may arise even under a contract,
where tort is that which breaches the contract. (PSBA v. CA, 205
SCRA 729) Stated differently, when an act which constitutes
a breach of contract would have itself constituted the source
of a quasi-delict liability and no contract existed between the
parties, the contract can be said to have been breached by tort,
thereby allowing the rules on tort to apply. (Cangco v. Manila

TITLE XVIII

Air France v. Court of Appeals and Morales
GR 76093, March 21, 1989

DAMAGES

Mere refusal to accede to the passenger’s wishes does not
necessarily translate into damages in the absence of bad faith.

(New, except Arts. 2200, 2201, 2209, and 2212.)
(1) Introductory Comment:

<

Ji

I

!

.<

,

The fundamental principle of the law on damages is that
one injured by a breach of a contract or by a wrongful or negligent
act or omission shall have a fair and just compensation,
commensurate with the loss sustained as a consequence of the
defendant’s act. Hence, actual pecuniary compensation is the
general rule, whether the action is based on a contract or in
tort, except where the circumstances warrant the allowance of
other kinds of damages. (See Western Union Teleg Co. v. Green,
153 Tenn. 69) In general, the damages awarded should be equal
to, and precisely commensurate with the injury sustained.
However, rules of law respecting the recovery of damages are
framed with reference to just rights of BOTH PARTIES, not
merely what may be right for an injured person to receive, but
also what is just to compel the other party to pay, to accord just
compensation for the injury. (Kennings v. Kline, 158 Ind. 602)
(2) Cases

Zulueta v. Pan American World Airways, Inc.
43 SCRA 397
FACTS: Zulueta and his wife were passengers of a Pan
American airplane. At a stop-over, Zulueta was ill-treated and
was left at the airport. Is he entitled to recover damages?
HELD: Yes. Passengers should be treated by the employees
of an airplane earner with kindness and courtesy, and should
be protected against indignities, abuses, and injurious language
from such employees. In case of breach of contract, the airline
502

company should be held liable for damages. Be it noted further
that the contract of common air carriage generates a relation
attended with a public duty.

Tiu v. Court of Appeals
46 SCAD 408, 228 SCRA 51
(1993)

An adverse result of a suit in law does not mean that the
same is wrongful as to justify assessment of damages against
the actor.
(3) Civil Indemnity/Damages

People v. Jalbortan
700 SCRA 280

In this case at bar, the following was awarded to the heirs
of the victim by the appellant, namely: (1) Civil indemnity, (2)
Moral Damages, and (3) Temperate Damages.
Appellant must indemnify the heirs of the victim since
death resulted from the crime. The heirs of the victim are
entitled on award of civil indemnity in the amount of P75.000
which is mandatory and is granted without need of evidence
other than the commission of the crime.

Moral damages in the sum of P50,000 must likewise be
awarded despite the absence of proof of mental and emotional
suffering of the victim’s heirs. As borne out by human nature
and experience, a violent death invariably and necessarily
brings about emotional pain and anguish on the part of the
victim’s family.
While actual damages cannot be awarded since there was
no evidence of actual expenses incurred for the death of the
victim, is like thereof, the sum of P25,000 may be granted as it
is hereby granted, by way of tempered damages “as it cannot
503

be denied that the heirs of the victim suffered pecuniary loss,
although the exact amount was not proved.”

In so-called “building contracts,” the measure of damages
for breach is the amount expended by the owner in complet¬

Workmen’s Compensation Act (WCA). The trial court denied
YMCs motion to dismiss.
ISSUE: Is the compensation remedy under the WCA (now
under the Labor Code) for work-connected death or injuries
sustained by an employee exclusive of the other remedies
available under the Civil Code?
HELD: The rule in Robles v. Yap Wing no longer controls.
In Floresca v. Philex, 136 Phil. 141, involving a complaint for
damages for the death of five miners in a cave-in, the Supreme
Court was confronted with three divergent opinions on the
exclusivity rule.
One view is that the injured employee or his heirs, in

Charity Sweepstakes Office
L-21718, June 29, 1968

FACTS: Amadeo R. Forteza worked as watchman in the
Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) from July 1,
1950 up to Jan. 17, 1955. He was more than 60 years old, and
was suffering from hypertension when he entered the service
of the office. On Jan. 17, 1955, he died of cerebral hemorrhage
due to said hypertension. It was proved that he had to work at
nighttime, was exposed to colds, lacked proper sleep and rest,
and had to go up and down a three-story building (without
elevator) to check out the premises. Is his death compensable?

case of death, may initiate an action to recover damages (not
compensation under the Workmen’s Compensation Act) with
the regular courts on the basis of negligence of the employer
pursuant to the Civil Code. Another view, as enunciated in
the Robles case, is that the remedy of an employee for workconnected injury or accident is exclusive in accordance with
Sec. 5 of the WCA. A third view is that the action is selective
and the employee or his heirs have a choice of availing

HELD: Yes, his death is compensable. It is the rule in
Workmen’s Compensation cases that it need not be proven
that his employment was the sole cause of the death or injury
suffered by the employee. It is enough
to entitle him or his
heirs to compensation benefits under the law that there be a
showing that his employment (as in this case) had contributed
to the acceleration of his death or ailment. Moreover, the law
presumes that such death is compensable, unless the employer
clearly establishes that it was not caused or aggravated by
the employment. (See Niara v. Workmen’s Compensation
Commission, L-18066, Oct. 30, 1962)

Ysmael Maritime Corp. v. Avelino
GR 43674, June 30, 1987

FACTS: RGL was a licensed second mate on board a
vessel owned by YMC when the same ran aground and sank.
RGL perished as a result. FL and CG, the parents of RGL,
sued YMC in the Court of First Instance (Regional Trial
Court) for damages. YMC invoked the rule in Robles v. Yap
Wing, 41 SCRA 267, that all claims for death or injuries by
employees against employers are exclusively cognizable by
the Workmen’s Compensation Commission (WCC) regardless
of the causes of said death or injuries. CG admitted that he
had previously filed a claim for death benefits with the WCC

themselves of the benefits under the Workmen’s Compensation
Act or of suing in the regular courts under the Civil Code for
higher damages from the employer by reason of his negligence.
But once the election has been exercised, the employee or his
heirs are no longer free to opt for the other remedy, i.e., the
employee cannot pursue both actions simultaneously. The view
was adopted by the majority in the Floresca case, reiterating as
main authority its earlier decision in Pacana v. Cebu Autobus,
32 SCRA 442. In so doing, the Court rejected the doctrine of
exclusivity of the rights as remedies granted by the WCA as
laid down in the Robles case.

Claimants cannot be allowed to maintain their action to
recover additional damages against the employer if the former
had previously filed a claim for death benefits with the WCC
and had received the compensation payable to them under
the WCA. If they had not only opted to recover under the Act
but they had also been duly paid, at the very least, a sense of
fair play would demand that if a person entitled to a choice
507

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2197

of remedies made a first election and accepted the benefits
thereof, he should no longer be allowed to exercise the second
option. If one had staked his fortunes on a particular remedy,
he is precluded from pursuing the alternate course, at least
until the prior claim is rejected by the WCC.

COMMENT:

Enrique A. Defante v. Hon. Antonio
E. Rodriguez, et al.
L-28380, Feb. 27, 1976

If an action for damages is sought to be dismissed by
plaintiff-appellant or his heirs when the case is already on
appeal, may the dismissal be granted despite the appeal?
Yes, since the parties involved are no longer interested in
prosecuting the appeal.
(4) The State Cannot Be Held Responsible for Alleged
Damagea It Performed Alongside Its Mandated Duty

Buisan v. Comm, on Audit
816 SCRA 346
(2017)

FACTS: The Department of Public Works and Highways
(DPWH) was being deemed accountable for alleged damages it
committed alongside its mandated duty.

ISSUE: Does the doctrine of non-suability cloth the
DPWH, a government agency, from being responsible for
alleged damages it performed in consonance with its mandated
duty?
HELD: Yes. It is a fundamental postulate of constitution¬
alism flowing from the juristic concept of sovereignty that the
State, as well as its government, is immune from suit unless
it gives its consent.

Art 2197. Damages may be:
(1) Actual or compensatory;
(2) Moral;
(8) Nominal;
508

—

Damages (from the Latin “damnum" or “demo" to take
away) refers to the harm done and what may be recovered (See
Hale on Damages, 2nd Ed., p. 1); injury refers to the wrongful or
unlawful or tortious act. The former is the measure of recovery,
the latter is the legal wrong to be redressed. There may be
damages without injury, and an injury without damages. (15
Am. Jur., p. 388)
(2) Damage Without Injury

There can be “damage without injury” (damnum absque
injuria) (or physical hurt or injury without legal wrong). The
principle was mentioned in, among other cases, De la Rama

Steamship Co., Inc. v. Judge Tan and the NDC (99 Phil. 1034)
In that case, the government exercised a contractual right to
cancel an agency, although by such cancellation, the agent
would suffer damages.

Similarly, one who complies with a governmentpromulgated rule cannot be held liable for damages that may
be caused by other person. (Janda u. Lepanto Cons. Mining
Co., L-6930, May 25, 1956)
(3) Some Rules on Waiver

(a)

Although the right to recover civil liability whether arising
from an offense or otherwise is waivable, still, where the
waiver thereof was made in behalf of the minor heirs by a
person who is not their judicial guardian, such waiver is
ineffective if it lacks judicial approval. (People v. Verano,
L-15805, Feb. 28, 1961)
(b) Waiver of the right to recover upon the civil liability of an
accused employee arising from a crime, made in favor of his
employer, embraces also the civil liability of the accused

liable for the civil obligation and in default of the person

A Fiscal (now Prosecutor) who orders the seizure of
property alleged to be involved in the crime of robbery without
a search warrant is liable (except in the case of a citizen’s
arrest) for actual damages (including attorney’s fees), moral
damages, and exemplary damages. There is nothing in the law

Art. 2199. Except as provided by law or by stipulation,
one is entitled to an adequate compensation only for such
pecuniary loss suffered by him as he has duly proved. Such
compensation is referred to as actual or compensatory
damages.

COMMENT:
(1) ‘Actual or Compensatory Damages’ Defined

Actual or compensatory damages are those recoverable
because of pecuniary loss (in business, trade, property,
profession, job, or occupation). (Algarra v. Sandejas, 27 Phil.
284) They include:
(a)

(b)

the value of the loss suffered (dafio emergente);
profits which were not obtained or realised (lucro cesante).
(Art. 2199; 8 Manresa 100)

(NOTE: Recovery cannot be had for the death of an
unborn [aborted] child. This is not to say that the parents
are not entitled to collect any damages at all. But all such
damages must be those inflicted directly upon them, as
distinguished from the injury or violation of the rights
of the deceased, his right to life, and physical integrity.
Because the parents cannot expect either help, support,
or service from an unborn child, they would normally
be limited to moral damages for the illegal arrest of the
normal development of the spos hominis that was the
foetus, i.e., on account of distress and anguish attendant
to its loss, and the disappointment of their parental
expectations [Art. 2217], as well as to exemplary damages,

Because of a breach of contract on the part of the sellers,
the buyers were not able to construct the house they had

Ramos v. Court of Appeals
GR 124354, April 11, 2002

(

The Court rules on actual or compensatory damages
generally assume that at the time of litigation, the injury
suffered as a consequence of an act of negligence, has
been completed and that the cost can be liquidated.

These provisions, however, neglect to take into
account those situations, as in the case at bar, where the
512

(NOTE: To be able to recover actual or compensatory
damages, the amount of loss must be proven with a
reasonable degree of certainty, based on competent proof
and on the best evidence obtainable by the injured party.
[MOF Co. v. Enriquez, GR 149280, May 9, 2002J)

(2) Necessity of Pleading

To be recoverable, actual damages must be pleaded or
prayed for. However, when a prayer mentions only exemplary
damages, moral damages, and attorney’s fees and “such further
relief... as this Honorable Court may deem just and equitable,”
the phrase “such further relief” may include “actual damages”
if and when they are proved. (Heirs of Justiva v. Court of
Appeals, L-16396, Jan. 31, 1963)
(3) Necessity of Proof
(a)

Actual damages must be proved as a general rule (Tomassi
v. Villa- Abrille, L-7047, Aug. 21, 1958) and the amount of
damages must possess at least some degree of certainty.

Judges and Justices must be careful not to award

(NOTE: If there is NO proof of loss [Sanz v.
Lavin Brothers, 6 Phil. 299] or if the proof is flimsy and
unsubstantial, no damages will be given. [Heredia v.
Salinas, 10 Phil. 157] The Court cannot rely on its own

speculations as to the fact and amount of damages,
but must depend on actual proof that damage had
been suffered and actual proof of the amount. [Suntay
Tanjangco v. Jovellanos, L-12332, June 30, 1960] The
Court in awarding damages, must point out specific acts
which afford a basis for measuring compensatory or
actual damages had been suffered. [Malonzo v. Galang, et
al., L-13851, July 27, 1960] However, if there was proof,
but it is not clear or satisfactory, the appellate court may
remand the case to the lower court for new trial. [Brodeck
v. Larsen, 8 Phil. 425; Roroqui v. Maiquez, et al., {CA.} 37
O.G. 1191] In no instance may the judge give more than
the damages proved in court. [Marker v. Garcia, 5 Phil.
557] Just because the complaint filed by the plaintiffs
against the defendant is “clearly unfounded,” this does
not necessarily mean, in the absence of specific facts
proving damages, that said defendants really suffered
actual damages over and above attorney’s fees and costs.
A mere relief by the Court that the sum of P500 must
have been what they had actually suffered clearly should
not be countenanced. [Malonzo v. Galang, et al., L-13851,
July 27, 1960] Similarly, an alleged but unproved claim of
damages in the amount of PIO,000 simply because a party
had been made a defendant in an unfounded “easement”
case cannot be allowed. Indeed, the Court cannot rely on
its own speculations as to the fact and amount of damages
alleged to have been suffered. [Tanjangco v. Jovellanos,
et al., L-12332, June 30, 1960; see Basilan Lumber Co.
v. Cagayan Timber Export Co., et al., L-15908, June 30,
1961])
(NOTE: If there be an award for compensatory
damages, there can be no grant of nominal damages.
The reason is that the purpose of nominal damages is to
vindicate or recognize a right that has been violated, in
order to preclude further cost thereon, and “not for the
purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff for any loss suffered

(NOTE: The damages given must be based on the
evidence given and not on the personal knowledge of the
court. [Villaroman v. Lastrella, (CA.) L-136-R, Feb. 11,
1947 and Romualdez v. Ysmael and Co., {CA.} 53 O.G.
8858] Neither must the damages be remote or speculation

[Tomassi v. Villa Abrille, L-7047, Aug. 21, 1958 and

Standard Oil Co. u. Castro, 54 Phil. 716], nor must the
claim be delayed unreasonably. [Strong v. INAEC, 40 O.G.
(18th, S) p. 269] In Kairuz v. Pacio and Pacio [L-14506,
July 25, 1960], it was held that a person who unjustifiably
withholds from another the latter’s motor engine used for
the hauling of logs should not be held liable for speculative
and contingent damages [in the form of possible rentals].
Instead, the withholder must be held responsible for its
return [or payment of its value] plus legal interest thereon
from the date of demand. In the case of Ventanilla v.
Centeno, L-14333, Jan. 28, 1961, the Supreme Court held
that even if an attorney fails to perfect an appeal in a civil
case from an adverse judgment in a lower court, he should
not be held liable for the “damages that could have been
recovered” since these damages are highly speculative. In
Rizal Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. v. MRR Co., L-22409,
April 27, 1967, the Court ruled that a provisional claim
filed by a consignee BEFORE knowledge of any actual
shortage or damage with respect to cargo consigned to
her is a speculative claim. In Delfin v. Court of Agrarian
Relations, L-23348, March 14, 1967, the Court decreed
that damages, such as those awarded to an illegally
dispossessed tenant, should not be given the basis of
guesswork or speculation.)

If because of a breach in a lease contract, there
is an award of compensatory damages, this award
may be ordered executed pending appeal, but not an
award for moral or exemplary damages. The award
for moral or exemplary damages cannot be regarded
as fixed or definite until there is a final judgment.

(NOTE that “lucrum cessan” is also a basis for
indemnification. Hence, if there exists a basis for a

reasonable expectation that profits would have continued
had there been no breach of contract, indemnification
for damages based on such expected profits is proper.

BA Finance Corp. v. Court of Appeals
GR 61464, May 28, 1988
The court cannot sustain the award of unrealized
profits if the same have not been proved or justified before
the trial court, and the basis of the alleged unearned
profits is too speculative and conjectural to show actual
damages for a future period.

not only the value of the loss suffered, but also that of the
profits which the obligee failed to obtain.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Thus, if on account of his concealment, the woman lives with
him and bears a child, and relinquishes her employment to
attend to a litigation filed to obtain support for her child
he must be held liable for all the consequent damages. This
concealment of the marriage in fact is NOT mere negligence,
but actual fraud (dolo) practiced upon the girl. While the
liability may be considered extra-contractual in nature, still
under the old Civil Code as well as, it is believed, the new
Civil Code, said liability is equivalent to that of a contractual
debtor in bad faith. (Silva, et al. v. Peralta, et al., L-13114,
Aug. 29, 1961) Should the man be also held liable for moral
damages? YES. It is true that no moral damages are generally
allowable as a consequence of sexual relations outside of
wedlock, but in the instant case it appears that after the girl
had filed the action for support the man avoided the service of
summons and then exercised improper pressure upon her to
make her withdraw the suit. When she refused, the man and
his lawful wife even filed an action against her, thus calling
to her employer’s attention the fact that she was an unwed
mother. These are deliberate maneuvers causing her anguish
and physical suffering in which she got sick as a result. As this
injury was inflicted after the new Civil Code became operative,
it constitutes a justification for the award of moral damages
(Ledesma Silva, et al. v. Peralta, L-13114, Aug. 29, 1961)

If a taxi driver should kill his passenger, the civil
liability of the offender is based on his having committed

of carriage.

deceased was extinguished because of his death before

If unfair competition deprives the victims of certain

GR 101706, Sept. 23, 1992
While it is the Court’s belief that petitioner is entitled
to an award for moral damages, the award granted by
the trial court in the amount of P200,000 is excessive. It
should be stated here that the hauling agreement between
526

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2205

the petitioners and the private respondent had no fixed
date of termination; it was a verbal agreement where the
private respondents bound themselves until the loan with
Equitable Bank in the personal account of petitioners had
been fully paid. There was substantial compliance by the
private respondents of their obligations in the contract
for about a year. The record showed that the remaining
balance owing to the bank was only P30,000 which was
not due until one year and six months after the breach
by the private respondents, or on Sept. 4, 1980. However,
the trial court found that private respondents acted with
bad faith when it surreptitiously pulled out their hauler
trucks from petitioner’s jobsite before the termination of
the contract.
The trial court held that the act of defendants in
suddenly and surreptitiously withdrawing its hauler
trucks from the jobsite and abandoning its obligation of
hauling the logs is indubitably a wanton violation of its
obligation, under the contract, a neglect to perform its
obligation in bad faith more particularly in its stipulation
to liquidate the cash advance obtained from Equitable
Rank, for the law would not permit said defendants to
enrich themselves at the expense of the plaintiffs. Thus,
an award of P50.000 for moral damages is sufficient.
Francisco, et cd. v.
Ferrer, Jr., et al.
GR 142029, Feb. 28, 2001

FACTS: A couple engaged to be married had ordered
a three-layered cake from a bakeshop to be delivered at
5 p.m. of the wedding day itself. On the wedding day, the
now newly married couple arrived at the country club
(venue-reception of the wedding) at around 6 p.m., but
the wedding cake was nowhere to be found. At 10 p.m.,
the wedding cake finally arrived, but by then rejected
because of the lateness of the hour. One other reason for
its rejection: what arrived was only a two-layered cake
and not a three-layered one as originally agreed upon.
The bakeshop owner was sued for breach of contract,
with the complaints alleging personal embarrassments,
mental anguish, serious anxiety, and sleepless nights.
526

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2206

ISSUE: To recover moral damages, is it enough that
one suffered sleepless nights, mental anguish, serious
anxiety, social embarrassment, or besmirched reputation?

"

'

HELD: No. To recover moral damages, it must be
proven that the guilty party acted in bad faith. In the
instant case, no such bad faith existed. The bakeshop
owner was quick to apologize and offered to repair
whatever damage was done. Note that the bakeshop owner
sent a letter of apology accompanied by a P5.000 check

for the harm done, but which was unacceptable to the
couple who considered the amount offered as inadequate.
Nevertheless, while not liable for moral damages, the
bakeshop owner must pay nominal damages in the
amount of PlO.OOO for prevarication when confronted
with failure to deliver the cake on time, this, in addition
to paying the cost of the cake in the sum of P3,175 and
attorney’s fees of PlO.OOO.

Art. 2206. The amount of damages for death caused by a
crime or quasi-delict shall be at least three thousand pesos,
even though there may have been mitigating circumstances.
In addition:
(1) The defendant shall be liable for the loss of the
earning capacity of the deceased, and the indemnity shall
be paid to the heirs of the latter; such indemnity shall in
every case be assessed and awarded by the court, unless the
deceased on account of permanent physical disability not
caused by the defendant, had no earning capacity at the time
of his death;
(2) If the deceased was obliged to give support
according to the provisions of Article 291, the recipient who
is not an heir called to the decedent’s inheritance by the law
of testate or intestate succession, may demand support from
the person causing the death, for a period not exceeding five
years, the exact duration to be fixed by the court;

(3) The spouse, legitimate and illegitimate descendants
and ascendants of the deceased may demand moral damages
for mental anguish by reason of the death of the deceased.

or statesman, is materially more valuable to the family
and community than that of an ordinary man. Moreover,
exemplary damages may be justified by aggravating
circumstances. The earning capacity of the deceased, his
obligation to support dependents, and the moral damages
suffered by his kin must also be considered. (Report of the
Code Com., p. 35) It is clear from Art. 2206 that P3,000
is the minimum award. Hence, a greater sum can be
given. (Nita Lira v. Gonzalo Mercado, et al. and Gonzalo
Mercado, et al. v. Ramon Ura, et al., L-13358, L-13328,
L-13329, Sept. 29, 1961)
(c) In fact in many decisions, the appellate courts awarded
P6,000, then P12.000, and now, P50.0OO, as damages.
The Court gave as its reason the great rise in prices and
declining purchasing power of the peso. Independently
of its financial capacity, a common carrier, if liable for
the death of a passenger or of a pedestrian, must be
made to pay the minimum amount. But if its financial
capacity enables it to pay more, said greater sum should
be given. It is here where financial capacity is material
and significant.

Mckee, et al. v. Intermediate Appellate
Court, et al.
GR 68102, July 16, 1992

In light of recent decisions of the Supreme Court,
the indemnity for death is now P50.000.
(2) Factors Which May Be Considered in Determining the

Amount
(a)

life expectancy (considering the state of health and
habit of the deceased; mortality tables are inconclusive
evidence) and consequent loss of earning capacity.

Monzon, et al. v. Intermediate Appellate Court and
Theo H. Davies and Co., Far East Ltd.
GR 72828, Jan. 31, 1989
Life expectancy fluctuates with several factors but it
is for that very reason that a generally accepted formula
has been established by this Court in a long line of cases.

It would be most unfair and illogical for a court to
reduce the compensation due for the loss of the earning
capacity of a deceased by discarding the well-established
formula by taking a pessimistic and depressed view of
every situation instead of an average standard. For as a
man grows older, and gains more experience, his income
generally increases, with each passing year.

Catalino Borja and International Towage
and Transport Corp.
GR 143008, June 10, 2002

FACTS: Petitioner contends that respondent Borja
died nine years after the incident and, hence, his life

was only 59 when he actually died.

vessel was carrying dangerous inflammable chemicals,
its officers and crew failed to take all the necessary
precautions to prevent an accident. Petitioner was,
therefore, negligent and held liable for damages and loss

As a result of the fire and the explosions during
the unloading of the chemicals from petitioner’s vessel,
respondent Borja suffered damages and iqjuries, thus:

Respondent Borja’s demise earlier than the estimated
life span is of no moment. For purposes of determining
loss of earning capacity, life expectancy remains at 80.
Otherwise, the computation of loss of earning capacity

eventuality of the victim’s death. The computation should
not change even if Borja lived beyond 80 years. Fair is

HELD: Had not Tejada met this fatal accident on
July 17, 1961, he would have continued to serve in the
government for some 27 years until his retirement with
a compensation of P6,000. As consequential damages,
the heirs having been deprived of the earning capacity of
their husband and father, respectively, they are entitled
to P3,300 a year for at least 17 years the average life of a
Filipino being between 50 and 60 years (17 years because
he could have died at the age of 50 only). For failure of
the transportation company to exercise due diligence in

month or P6,000 a year. In adjudicating the actual or
compensatory damages, the appellate court found that
the deceased was 48 years old, in good health with a
remaining productive life expectancy of 12 years and
then earning P24,000 a year. Using the gross annual
income as the basis, and multiplying the same by 12
years, it accordingly awarded P288.000. Applying the
aforesaid rule on computation based on the net earnings,
said award must be rectified and reduced to P216.000.
However, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence,
the death indemnity is hereby increased to P50.000.

for the agony, mental anguish and sorrow suffered by
the heirs because of the sudden death of Tejada and the
mutilated and gory condition of the body, the amount
of P5,000 is awarded as moral damages. (See Art. 2234;

not gross earnings, are to be considered, that is, the total
of the earnings less expenses necessary in the creation

FACTS: Pedro Musa, a bus driver of MMTC, was
found guilty by the trial court of reckless imprudence
resulting in homicide for the death of Liza Rosalie
Rosales. Liza Rosalie’s parents filed an independent civil
action for damages against MMTC, Musa, MMTC Actg.,
Gen. Mgr. Conrado Tolentino, the GSIS, and Felicinao
Celebrado, an MMTC dispatcher. The trial court found
MMTC and Musa guilty of negligence and ordered them
to pay damages and attorney’s fees. The Court of Appeals
(CA) affirmed the trial court’s decision, but deleted the
award of actual damages and awarded instead death
indemnity. On appeal, the Supreme Court set aside the
CA’s decision.
HELD: Both MMTC and Musa, respectively,
are liable for negligence for the death of Liza Rosalie.
The responsibility of employers for the negligence of
their employees is primary, i.e., the injured party may
recover from the employers directly, regardless of the
solvency of their employees. Employees may be relieved
of responsibility for the negligent act of their employees
within the scope of their assigned tasks only if they
can show that they observed all the diligence of a good
father of a family to prevent damage. For this purpose,
they have the burden of proving that they have indeed
533

Art. 2206

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

exercised such diligence, both in the selection of employee
who committed the quasi-delict and in the supervision of
the performance of his duties.

In addition to the death indemnity, the heirs of Liza
Rosalie are awarded moral damages, exemplary damages,
attorney’s fees, and compensation for loss of earning
capacity. Compensation for loss of earning capacity was
awarded because Liza Rosalie’s parents had adduced
proof that the victim was a good student, a promising
artist, and an obedient child. Such form of damages,
computed in accordance with the formula laid down in
decided cases, may use as basis for the victim’s projected
gross annual income the minimum wage for workers in
the non-agricultural sector at the time of her death.

(4) When Documentary Evidence as a Requirement to Prove
Loss of Earning Capacity May Be Dispense With

Sanico v. Colipano

Documentaiy evidence is required to prove loss of earn¬
ing capacity. By way of exception, damages for loss of earning

capacity may be awarded despite the absence of documentary
evidence when:

Da Jose v. Angeles

earning less than the minimum wage under current

Under Art. 2206, the heirs of the victim are entitled to
indemnity for loss of earning capacity.
Compensation of this nature is awarded not for loss of
earnings, but for loss of capacity to earn money.

If the victim dies because of a CRIME, QUASI-DELICT

illegitimate descendants and ascendants [Art. 2206;

where
the court said that moral damages may be recovered
here as an EXCEPTION to the general rule against
moral damages in breach of contract under Art.
2220. Indeed, once the heirs are able to prove that
they are entitled to the actual damages of at least
P3,000, it becomes the duty of the court to award
moral damages to the claimants in an amount
commensurate with their mental anguish. (Mercado
v. Lira, L-13328-29, Sept. 29, 1961)]
(NOTE: In the case of Tamayo v. Aquino
[Nos. L-12634, L-12720, May 29, 1959], the Court
apparently forgot the ruling in the case of Necesito
v. Paras (supra), when it denied moral damages for
the heirs of a passenger who died as a result of culpa
contractual. The Court obviously forgot to consider
Art. 1764 read together with Art. 2206. However, the
error was obviously corrected in later cases which
correctly granted moral damages in case of death.
One such case is [Mercado v. Lira, L-13328-29, Sept.
29, 1961])
(NOTE: In ordinary breaches of contract, moral
damages may be recovered only if the defendant
acted fraudulently or in bad faith. [Art. 2220])
(NOTE: In Heirs of Gervacio Gonzales v.
Alegarbes, et al., 99 Phil. 213, it was held that Arts.
2206 (No. 3) and 2217, do NOT grant brothers and
sisters of the deceased who left a child a right to
recover moral damages arising out of or from the
death of the deceased caused by the wrongful or
tortuous act of the defendant. [See Art. 2219, last
paragraph, which excludes brothers, and sisters, if a
descendant is present])
(b) If the victim does not die, but merely suffers physical
injuries, may moral damages be recovered?
ANS.: Yes, but only in the following instances:

if caused by a crime. (Art. 2219, No. 1)
if caused by a quasi-delict. (Art. 2219, No. 2)
536

if caused by a breach of contract BUT ONLY if the
defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith (Art.
2220) or in case of wanton and deliberately injurious
conduct on the part of the carrier. (LTB v. Cornista,
L-22193, May 29, 1964) Thus, if a passenger is
merely injured due to the negligence of a common
carrier, there is no right to recover moral damages,
unless the common carrier acted fraudulently or in
bad faith. (Art. 2220) This is DIFFERENT from a
case of death. (Necesito, et al. v. Paras, et al., supra)
Indeed, proof of fraud, malice, or bad faith must be
given if only physical injuries were sustained. The
mere bursting of a tire while a passenger bus was
overspeeding cannot be considered evidence of fraud,
malice, or bad faith. (Lira v. Mercado, L-13328, Sept.

modified the accused-appellants’ judgment upon appeal.

HELD: Accused-appellants can only be made liable
for reckless imprudence resulting in homicide as qualifying
circumstance of treachery cannot be appreciated absent an
intent to kill.
As to the their civil liability, accused-appellants should
pay the heirs of the victim an indemnity in the amount of
P50.000 and moral damages also in the amount of P50.O00.
(Arts. 2206[3] and 2219[1], Civil Code; See People v. Silva, 321
SCRA 647 [1999]; See also People v. Silvestre, 307 SCRA 60
[1999]) In addition, they should pay exemplary damages in
the amount of P30,000 in view of accused-appellants’ gross
negligence in attempting to “cure” the victim without a license
to practice medicine and to give an example or correction for
the public good. (Arts. 2229 and 2231; See People v. Medroso,
Jr., 62 SCRA 245 [1975])

Art. 2207. If the plaintiffs property has been insured,
and he has received indemnity from the insurance company
for the injury or loss arising out of the wrong or breach of
contract complained of, the insurance company shall be
subrogated to the rights of the insured against the wrong*
doer or the person who has violated the contract If the
amount paid by the insurance company does not fully cover
the injury or loss, the aggrieved party shall be entitled to
recover the deficiency from the person causing the loss or
injury.

i

(1) Effect if Property was Insured
(a)

According to American jurisprudence, the fact that the
plaintiff has been indemnified by an insurance company
cannot lessen the damages to be paid by the defendant.
Such rule gives more damages than those actually
suffered by the plaintiff, and the defendant, if also sued
by the insurance company for reimbursement, would
have to pay in many cases twice the damages he has
caused. The proposed article would seem to be a better
538

Art. 2207

judgment of the rights of the three parties. (Report of the
Code Commission, p. 73)
(b)
1

The principle enunciated in this article can apply even
to cases that accrued prior to the effectivity of this
article and the new Civil Code
otherwise, the general
principle against unjust enrichment would be violated.
(Africa v. Caltex, L-12986, March 21, 1966) Hence, the
amount of insurance recovered shall be deducted from the
total liability of the defendant. (Ibid.)

(2) Meaning of “Authorized Driver” in Car Insurance

CCC Insurance Corp. v. Court of Appeals
and Carlos F. Robes
L-25920, Jan. 30, 1970
FACTS: A car insured against loss or damage was
being driven by a driver, who was licensed, WITHOUT an
examination (he was illiterate). The car was subsequently
damaged in an accident, but the insurance company refused
to pay on the ground that the driver was not an “authorized
driver.” Is the insurance company liable?

HELD: Yes, the insurance company is liable for under Sec.
24 of the Revised Motor Vehicles Law, Act 3992, as amended
by Republic Acts 587, 1204, and 2363, an examination or
demonstration of the applicant’s ability to operate a motor
vehicle may (only) be required in the discretion of the Chief,
Motor Vehicles Office. Sec. 26 even allows a non-examination.
Whether discretion on the part of the government official was
abused or not is a matter of legislative policy. The issuance
of the license is proof that the driver was entitled to drive.
Besides, insurance contracts must be construed liberally in
favor of the insured and strictly against the insurer.

(3) Subrogation of Insurer

Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., et al. v.
Jamila and Co., Inc.
L-27427, April 7, 1976

FACTS: Firestone Corporation had its properties insured
by Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co. Some of said properties
539

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2208

were lost allegedly because of the acts of its own employees,
who were in connivance with security guards from the Jamila
agency. These security guards were supposed to safeguard the
Firestone properties, and under the contract, Jamila assumed
responsibility for the guards’ actuations. The First Quezon City
Insurance guaranteed this obligation of Jamila. The losses of
Firestone Corporation were paid by Fireman’s Fund Insurance
Company as insurer. Does Fireman’s Fund Insurance Company
have a cause of action against Jamila and the First Quezon
City Insurance Company, so that the money paid may be
reimbursed? Can there be subrogation even without Jamila’s

consent?
HELD: Yes, it has a valid cause of action, under Art.
2207, Civil Code. Said article states that the insurer who has
paid shall be subrogated in the place of the injured party in the
latter’s rights against the offender or violator of a contractual
commitment. This is an instance when the consent of the debtor
is not required for the subrogation in favor of the Fireman’s
Fund Insurance Company.

The attorney’s fees referred to in this article do not refer
to the duty of a client to pay his own attorney. Such payment
generally involves only the client and his attorney. The fees
stated in the article apply rather/to" instances when a client
may recover from the other party the fees which the former
may pay the former’s attorney. (See Tan Ti v. Alvear, 26 Phil.

Art. 2208. In the absence of stipulation, attorney’s fees
and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, cannot

GR 70099, Jan. 7, 1987

The Supreme Court has invariably fixed counsel fees on

Hence, the fees should be subject to judicial control. Sound
541

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2208

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

public policy demands that courts disregard stipulations for
counsel fees, whenever they appear to be a source of speculative
profit at the expense of the debtor or mortgagor.
In determining the compensation of an attorney, the
following circumstances should be considered: the amount and
character of the services rendered; the responsibility imposed;
the amount of money or the value of the property affected by
the controversy, or involved in the employment; the skill and
experience called for in the performance of the service; the
professional standing of the attorney; the results secured; and
whether or not the fee is contingent or absolute, it being a
recognized rule that an attorney may properly charge a much
larger fee when it is to be contingent than when it is not.

expenses, since it is not the fact of winning alone that entitles
him to recover such damages of the exceptional circumstances
enumerated in Art. 2208. Otherwise, every time a defendant
wins, automatically the plaintiff must pay attorney’s fees
thereby putting a premium on the right to litigate, which
should not be so. For those expenses, the law deems the award

of costs as sufficient.
Philippine National Construction
Corp. v. APAS Marketing
697 SCRA 441

ISSUE: Are attorney’s fees awarded as a matter of course
every time a party wins?

HELD: No. Said award is an exception rather than the
general rule. For there must be a compelling legal reason to
bring the case within the exceptions laid down under Art. 2208.

Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. v. Court of Appeals and
Nerissa Lim
GR 92383, July 17, 1992

FACTS: Petitioner issued a personal accident policy
to Felix Lim, Jr. with a face value of P200,000. Two months
later, he was shot dead with a bullet wound in his head. As
beneficiary, his wife Nerissa Lim sought payment on the policy
but her claim was rejected. The petitioner agreed that there
was no suicide. It argued, however, that there was no accident
either.
HELD: The petitioner is liable to the private respondent
in the sum of P200,000 representing the face value of the
insurance contract, with interest at the legal rate from the date
of the filing of the complaint until the full amount is paid, but
modified with the deletion of all awards for damages, including
attorney’s fees, except the costs of the suit.
In order that a person may be made liable to the payment
of moral damages, the law requires that his act be wrongful.
The adverse result of an action does not per se make the
act wrongful and subject the act or to the payment of moral
damages. The law could not have meant to impose a penalty
on the right to litigate; such right is so precious that moral
damages may not be charged on those who may exercise it
erroneously. For these, the law taxes costs. If a party wins,
he cannot, as a rule, recover attorney’s fees and litigation
542

Art. 2208

(2) Generally Not Part of Damages

'

Generally, attorney’s fees, as understood in this article,
are not a proper element of damage, for it is NOT sound
public policy to place a penalty on the right to litigate. To
compel the defeated party to pay the fees of counsel for his
successful opponent would throw wide the door of temptation
to the opposing party and his counsel to swell the fees to undue
proportions. (Tan Ti v. Alvear, 26 Phil. 566) Thus, no right to
such fees can accrue merely because of an adverse decision.
Otherwise stated, if a party loses in court, this does not mean
necessarily that the court will compel him to award attorney’s
fees (as damages) to the winning party. (Ramos v. Ramos, 61
SCRA 284) This is precisely the rationale for taxing costs in
certain cases against the losing party. The payment of said
costs is deemed a sufficient sanction. However, under the new
Civil Code, it may truly be said that in certain cases, attorney’s
fees are an element of recoverable damages, whether they be
in writing or not stipulated at all. (Santiago v. Dimayuga,
L-17883, Dec. 30, 1961) The appellate court may fix attorney’s
fees even when the trial court did not award attorney’s fees,
and even when no appeal on this point was interposed before
the appellate tribunal. (Medenilla v. Kayanan, 40 SCRA 154)

GR 147933-34, Dec. 12, 2001
FACTS: Anent petitioner’s claim for attorney’s fees,
suffice it to state that it was represented by the Government
Corporate Counsel in the proceedings before the Construction
Industry Arbitration Commission.

HELD: Attorney’s fees are in the nature of actual
damages, which must be duly proved. Petitioner failed to show
with convincing evidence that it incurred attorney’s fees.
(3) Given to Party, Not to Counsel

The Court’s award of attorney’s fees is an indemnity to
the party and NOT to counsel, and the fact that the contract
between the client and his counsel was on a CONTINGENT
basis does not affect the client’s right to counsel fees. A litigant
who improvidently stipulates higher counsel fees than those to
which he is lawfully entitled, does NOT for that reason earn
the right for a larger indemnity, but by parity of reasoning, he
544

A claim for attorney’s fees which arises out of the filing of a
complaint partakes of the nature of a compulsory counterclaim
Therefore, if it is not pleaded or prayed for in the answer to the
complaint, it is barred.
What has been said above applies also to all damages
claimed to have been suffered by the defendant as a consequence
of the action filed against, him.
Quirante and Cruz v. Intermediate
Appellate Court, et al.
GR 73886, Jan. 31, 1989

,

Attorney’s fees as an item of damages provided for under
Art. 2208 of the Civil Code is an award made in favor of the
litigant, not of his counsel. And the litigant, not his counsel,
is the judgment creditor who may enforce the judgment for
attorney’s fees by execution.

What is being claimed in this case as attorney’s fees
by petitioners is, however, different. Herein, the petitioners’
claims are based on an alleged contract for professional services,
with them as the creditors and the private respondents as the

debtors.

(4) Express Stipulation
(a)

Note that aside from the 11 instances enumerated,
attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation may be recovered
also should there be an express stipulation to that effect.
(Introductory paragraph, Art. 2208) However, if despite
an express stipulation for attorney’s fees, there is an
implied WAIVER thereof (as when instead of demanding
with attorney’s
specific fulfillment of an obligation
there is a demand

(b)

If the parties agree on attorney’s fees based on a certain
percentage of the amount of the principal obligation, the
stipulation is valid. (Luneta Motor v. Mora Limlengco, 73
Phil. 80)

(c)

Where the contract does not expressly stipulate that a fixed
sum by way of attorney’s fees shall be paid by defendant in
case of collection even if the same is subsequently settled
by compromise, it is just and fair to reduce the amount of
counsel’s fees in the court’s discretionary power, where
the case is partially or fully settled out of court. (Santiago
u. Dimayuga, L-17833, Dec. 30, 1961)

(d)

Be it noted, however, that an agreement whereby a
non-lawyer will be given part of the attorney’s fees, is
condemned by legal ethics, is immoral and cannot be
justified. (PAFLU v. Binalbagan Isabela Sugar Co., 42

The award of attorney’s fees for P2.000 is justified under
Art. 2208(2) of the Civil Code.

When exemplary damages are recovered, there
can be an award of attorney’s fees.
(2) Exemplary damages may be awarded even if
expressly

not
proved.
(3) Moral damages may be proved by documentary
evidence even without testimonial proof.

This is, in view of the trial court’s finding, that the
unjustified refusal of petitioners to reform or to correct the
document of sale compelled respondents to litigate to protect
their interest.

(5) Paragraph 2 (Defendant’s Act or Omission)

If the litigation was caused not by the defendant’s failure
to pay but by the plaintiffs exorbitant charge, the plaintiff
cannot get attorney’s fees. (Cachero v. Manila Yellow Taxicab
Co., 101 Phil. 523 and Globe Assurance Co. v. Arcache,
L-12378, May 28, 1958) Similarly, if the plaintiff goes to court
after refusing an amicable settlement by the guilty party, said
plaintiff cannot recover attorney’s fees if it is proved that he
was asking “too much.” Here, the defendant was justified in
resisting the unjust claim. (Juana Soberano & Jose B. Soberano

FACTS: A sued B for annulment of a contract. A did
not take part in the contract itself, and he did not know
the circumstances under which it was entered into. It
turned out that the contract was valid, and therefore was

fees incurred in the prior litigation.

lack of knowledge of the actual facts), A is not liable for
attorney’s fees.

FACTS: The owner (Ciriaco Enervida) of land
covered by a homestead patent issued Nov. 17, 1952 sold
the same on Nov. 20, 1957 to the spouses Dela Torre. In
1965, Roque Enervida, son of the seller, sued the spouses
for the cancellation of the deed of sale stating that the sale
had been made within the five-year prohibitory period.
Incidentally, at the pre-trial, Roque admitted his father
is still alive. The trial court dismissed the complaint and
awarded attorney's fees and moral damages in favor of
the spouses. Is the decision correct?

HELD:
(1) The dismissal of the case is proper because the
property was sold after the five-year prohibitory
period, and besides, Roque’s father is still alive.
(2)

The award of attorney’s fees is proper because the
suit is clearly unfounded (Art. 2208, No. 4) but —
there should be no award of moral damages because
same is not provided for in Art. 2219. Art. 2208
cannot be applied by analogy.
Metropolitan Bank v. Tan
Chuan Leong, et al.
GR 46539, June 25, 1986

FACTS: On April 22, 1965, “A” sold his house
and lot to his son “B.” “A” twice mortgaged the same
property: first to “C” on April 21, 1965, and then to
“D” on Feb. 11, 1966. The first mortgage had been
cancelled on Sept. 21, 1967.

On Dec. 17, 1967, the trial court ordered “A”
to pay Metrobank the unliquidated balance of an
overdraft line secured by “A” from the bank on
March 4, 1965. Unable to obtain satisfaction of
this judgment, the bank sued “A,” “B,” and “C" for
rescission to annul the sale and mortgages. It alleged
that these transactions were in fraud of creditors,

been entered into in bad faith.
The trial court dismissed the complaint and
ordered “A” to pay “C” and “D” (first and second
mortgagees) P5.000 as attorney’s fees. The appellate
court modified this decision by nullifying the sale as
fictitious, but affirming it in all respects. Petition for
review was lodged with the Supreme Court. Pending
said petition, the Court approved a compromise
agreement whereby “A” and “B” paid their monetary
liability to “X” to the satisfaction of the latter.

Phoenix Publishing House v. Ramos
GR 32339, March 29, 1988
FACTS: Phoenix charged Ramos with gross
violation of the copyright law and prayed for actual,
moral and exemplary damages as well as attorney’s
fees. The trial court dismissed the complaint and
ordered Phoenix to pay Ramos P5,000 attorney’s
fees as and by way of damages. The Court of
Appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court.
Phoenix appealed contending that the court erred
in assigning attorney’s fees against it for no other
apparent reason than for losing its case.

unresolved.
HELD: Attorney’s fees cannot be recovered,
except in cases of clearly unfounded civil action or
proceeding against plaintiff.
The mortgage did not in any way affect the
bank’s rights. It was as if said mortgage had never
existed. With the mortgage no longer existing, the
same could not be cited as reason for the bank’s
failure to collect its credit. Although “C” may have
had knowledge of the simulated sale between “A”
and his son “B” and had entered into the contract
of mortgage pursuant to a design to defraud “A’s”
creditors, no damage or prejudice was suffered by
the bank thereby. The cancellation of “C’s” lien over
the property had rendered the issues of rescissibility
and bad faith moot and academic. The fact that the
bank nevertheless impleaded “C,” in its complaint,
compelling the latter to litigate to protect its rights,
justifies the award of attorney’s fees. At the time the
second mortgage was entered into, the certificate of
title was in the name of “B” without any annotation
of encumbrance in favor of the bank or anyone else.
Mortgagee “D” then had every right to rely on what
appeared in that certificate of title and there being
none to excite suspicion, did not have to inquire
further. There being good faith, “D" is an innocent
purchaser for value. Since “D” had no intention to

Art. 2208

HELD: The award of attorney’s fees, if at all,
is proper in case of a “clearly unfounded civil action
or proceeding.” It cannot be said that the case filed
by Phoenix is clearly an unfounded civil action.
Phoenix secured the corresponding copyrights for its
books. These copyrights were found to be all right by
the Copyright Office, and Phoenix was conceded to
be the real owner thereof. It was on the strength of
these facts that Phoenix filed the complaint against
Ramos. Through a proper search warrant obtained
after Phoenix was convinced that Ramos was selling
spurious copies of its copyrighted books, the books
were seized from the latter and were identified to be
spurious. There is therefore not enough justification
for such an award under paragraph 11 of Art. 2208
of the Civil Code.

Therefore, where the defendant’s refusal to pay the
amount claimed was due not to malice but to the fact that
the plaintiff demanded more than what it should, and
consequently, the defendant had the right to refuse it,
plaintiff is not entitled to attorney’s fees. (Globe Assurance

GR 77930-31, Feb. 9, 1989
,

Reiterating its ruling in People v. Biador, CA-GR 19589R, Jan. 21, 1959 (55 O.G. No. 32, p. 6384), the Court ruled
that attorney’s fees, under Art. 2208 (No. 9) of the Civil Code,
can only be recovered in a separate civil action to recover civil
liability arising from crime.

(11) Paragraph 11 (Any Other Case)

fees. (Lasedeco v. Gaston, L-8938, Oct. 31, 1956; Koster,

(10) Paragraph 9 (Civil Liability Arising from a Crime)

•

Attorney’s fees by express provision of law may be
awarded in a separate civil action to recover the civil liability
arising from a crime. (Art. 2208, par. 9) Moreover, an award of
attorney's fees granted by a trial court can envisage the services
of counsel only up to the date of its judgment. Therefore, if the
decision is appealed, attorney’s fees should perhaps be at least
doubled. (Bantoto, et al. v. Bobis, et al. & Vallejo, L-18966, Nov.
22, 1966)
552

Paragraph 11 does not apply if the case was instituted
before the effectivity of the new Civil Code. This was the
ruling in the case of Bureau of Lands v. Samia (L-8068,
Aug. 26, 1956), where the court said that unless authorized
by statute, attorney’s fees cannot be recovered from the
government if it abandons expropriation proceedings. It
would be otherwise if the abandoner is a private entity or
a quasi-public corporation.

Thus also, if the award of attorney’s fees would be
just and equitable, still if the suit was brought before the
new Civil Code became effective, attorney’s fees (other
than those allowed as costs under the Rules of Court)
could not be recovered as damages against the losing
party (otherwise, there would be a sort of penalty on the
right to litigate). (See Receiver for North Negros Sugar
Co., Inc. v. Ybanez, L-22183, Aug. 30, 1968 and Koster v.
Zulueta, 99 Phil. 945)

(9) Paragraph 8 (Workmen's Compensation and Employer’s

Because Sec. 31 of the Workmen’s Compensation Act
does not govern attorney’s fees recoverable from the adverse
party, Art. 2208(8) of the Civil Code will apply to supply the
deficiency in the said Act, in accordance with Art. 18 of the new
Civil Code. (MRR v. Manalang, L-20845, Nov. 29, 1965 and
Nat. Development Corp. v. WCC, L-19863, April 29, 1964)

Art. 2208

(b)

Attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation may be
recovered when deemed by the court as just and equitable
as when the defendant never questioned the correctness
and legality of the plaintiff’s case but based its defense
and appeal entirely on a pure technicality which took up
the time of two appellate courts, and delayed giving of
appropriate relief to plaintiff for more than three years.
(Phil. Milling Co. v. Court of Appeals, L-9404, Dec. 27,
1956) Indeed, the award of attorney’s fees is essentially
discretionary in the trial court (Francisco v. GSIS,
L-18165, March 30, 1963), and in the absence of abuse

553

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2208

of discretion, the same should not be disturbed. (Lopez,
et al. v. Gonzaga, L-18788, Jan. 31, 1964) The allowance,
for example, of counsel’s fees in probate proceedings rests
largely on the sound discretion of the Court which shall
not be interfered with except for manifest abuse. (In Re

(12) Instance When the Insurance Code Grants Damages

Prudential Guarantee and Assurance, Inc. v.
Trans-Asia Shipping, Lines, Inc.
491 SCRA 411

Section 244 of the Insurance Code grants damages
consisting of attorney’s fees and other expenses incurred by
the insured after a finding by the Insurance Commissioner
or the Court, as the case may be, of an unreasonable denial
or withholding of payment of the claims due. Section 244 of
the Code does not require a showing of bad faith in order that
attorney’s fees be granted.
In the instant controversy, Sec. 244 thereof is categorical
in imposing an interest twice the ceiling prescribed by the
Bangko Sentral’s Monetary Board due the insured, from the
date following the time prescribed in Sec. 242 or in Sec. 243 of
the Code, as the case may be, until the claim is fully satisfied.

State Investment House, Inc. v. Court of Appeals
GR 90676, June 19, 1991

FACTS: The promissory note executed by respondent
had three components: (a) principal of the loan in the
amount of Pl 10,000; (b) regular interest in the amount
666

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2209

!

of 17% per annum; and (c) additional or penalty interest
in case of non-payment at maturity, at the rate of 2% per
month or 24 percent per annum. In the dispositive of his
resolution, the trial judge did not specify which of these
components of the loan he was ordering respondent to
pay and which component or components he was in effect
defecting. It cannot be assumed that the judge meant to
grant the relief prayed for by respondent in all its parts.
The decision was ambiguous in the sense that it was
cryptic. It must be assumed that the judge meant to decide
in accordance with law, that it cannot be fairly assumed
that the judge was grossly ignorant of the law or that he
intended to grant the respondent relief to which he was
not entitled under the law. The ultimate question which
arises is: If respondent was not in delay, what should he
have been held liable for in accordance with law?
HELD: Since the respondent was held not to have
been in delay, he is properly liable only for: (a) the
principal of the loan or PllO.OOO; and (b) regular or
monetary interest in the amount of 17% per annum. He
is not liable for penalty or compensatory interest, fixed in
the promissory note at 2% per month or 24% per annum.
The fact that the respondent was not in default did not
mean that he, as a matter of law, was relieved from the
payment not only of penalty or compensatory interest at
the rate of 24% per annum but also of regular monetary
interest of 17 percent per annum. The regular or monetary
interest continued to accrue under the terms of the
relevant promissory note until actual payment is effected.
The payment of regular interest continues to accrue since
the debtor continues to use such principal amount. In
the instant case, since respondent, while he is property
regarded as having made a written tender or payment to
the creditor, failed to consign in court the amount due
at the time of the maturity of the obligation. Hence, his
obligation to pay principal-cum-regular or monetary
interest under the terms and conditions of the note was
not extinguished by such tender of payment alone. For
the respondent to continue in possession of the principal
of the loan amounting to PllO.OOO and to continue to use
556

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2209

the same after maturity of the loan without payment of
regular or monetary interest, would constitute unjust
enrichment on the part of the respondent at the expense
of the creditor even though the respondent had not been
guilty of mora. It is precisely this unjust enrichment
which Art. 1256 of the Civil Code prevents by requiring,
in addition to tender of payment, the consignation of the
amount due in court which amount would thereafter
be deposited by the Clerk of Court in a bank and earn
interest to which the creditor would be entitled.
Tio Khe Chio v. Court of Appeals
GR 76101-02, Sept. 30, 1991

FACTS: Tio Khe Chio imported 1,000 bags of fish
meal valued at $36,000 which were insured with Eastern
Assurance and shipped on Board the M/V Peskev, owned
by Far Eastern Shipping. When the goods reached
Manila, they were found to have been damaged by sea
water which rendered the fish meal useless. Chio filed a
claim with Eastern Assurance and Far Eastern Shipping.
Both refused to pay. So Chio sued them before the Court
of First Instance (Regional Trial Court) for damages.
Eastern Assurance filed a counterclaim against Chio for
recovery of unpaid insurance premiums. The trial court
ordered Eastern Assurance and Far Eastern Shipping
to pay Chio solidarily P105.986, less P18.387 for unpaid
premiums with interest at the legal rate from the filing
of the complaint. Judgment became final as to Eastern
Assurance, but Far Eastern Shipping appealed and was
absolved from liability by the Court of Appeals. The
trial court issued a writ of execution against Eastern
Assurance. The sheriff enforcing the writ fixed the
legal rate of interest at 12%. Eastern Assurance moved
to quash the writ alleging that the legal interest to be
computed should be 6% in accordance with Art. 2209
of the Civil Code and not 12%. The trial court denied
Eastern Assurance’s motion. The Court of Appeals (CA)
reduced the interest to 6%. Chio maintains that not only
is it unjust and unfair but it is also contrary to the correct
interpretation of the fixing of interest rates under Secs.

243 and 244 of the Insurance Code. Since Chio’s claim is
based on an insurance contract, then it is the Insurance
Code that must govern and not the Civil Code.
HELD: The Supreme Court sustained the Court of
Appeals and held that the legal rate of interest in the
case at bar is 6% per annum. Sections 243 and 244 of
the Insurance Code are not pertinent to the instant case.
They apply only when the court finds an unreasonable
delay or refusal in the payment of the claims. Neither
does Circular 416 of the Central Bank which took effect
on July 29, 1974 pursuant to PD No. 116 (Usury Law)
which raised the legal rate of interest from 6% to 12%
per annum apply to the case at bar as contended by the
petitioner. The adjusted rate mentioned in the circular
refers only to loans or forbearances of money, goods or
credits and court judgments thereon but not to court
judgments for damages arising from injury to persons
and loss of property which does not involve a loan.

The legal rate of interest is 6% per annum and not
12% where a judgment award is based on an action for
damages for personal injury, not use or forbearance of
money, goods or credit. In the same vein, the court held
that the rates under the Usury law (amended by PD
116) are applicable only to interest by way of damages
is governed by Art. 2209 of the Civil Code. Since the
contending parties did not allege the rate of interest
stipulated in the insurance contract, the legal interest
was properly pegged by the appellate court, at 6% per

annum.
(3) Absence of Stipulation

In the absence of stipulation, only the legal interest can
be recovered. This is true even if a chance to make more in
business can be proved, inasmuch as here, the profit would
be SPECULATIVE. The Court in the case of Lopez v. Del
Rosario and Quiogue (44 Phil. 98) said that “the deprivation
of an opportunity for making money, which might have proved
beneficial or might have been ruinous, is of too uncertain a
character to be weighed in the even balance of the law.”

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2209

(4) From What Moment Interest Runs

In the absence of stipulation, interest (as damages) runs
from default (after a judicial or extrajudicial demand, except
when demand is NOT essential to put the debtor in default).
(Art. 2209 which states “in delay”; Zobel v. City of Manila, 47
Phil. 169) If there is no evidence of an extrajudicial demand,
the period starts from the judicial demand (Vda. de Murciano v.
Auditor General, et al., L-l 1744, May 28, 1958), which naturally
is in the form of filing a complaint in court. (Cabarroguis v.
Vicente, 107 Phil. 340)

Consuelo Piczon, et al. v. Esteban Piczon, et al.
L-29139, Nov. 15, 1974

FACTS: In a contract of Ioan, Esteban Piczon, as
guarantor, promised to pay in default of the principal debtor,
the sum of P12,500 with interest, “commencing from the date
of execution” (Sept. 28, 1956) of the contract. On Aug. 6, 1964,
demand was made for payment, but neither the principal
debtor nor the guarantor was able to pay.
ISSUE: From what time will interest run on the debt:
from Sept. 28, 1956 or from Aug. 6, 1964?

HELD: Interest will run from Sept. 28, 1956, in view of
the express stipulation in the contract. Under Art. 2209, Civil
Code, the indemnity of damages in a monetary obligation shall
be the payment of interest agreed upon, as a general rule. Here,
it was expressly agreed that interest should commence from
the execution of the contract. (See Firestone Tire & Rubber Co.
v. Delgado, 104 Phil. 920)
(NOTE: The statement in the decision that Art. 1169, Civil
Code [damages in case of default] applies only to obligations

other than monetary is only an obiter dictum.)
(NOTE: While it is true that interest [by way of
compensation for the use of money] cannot be demanded unless
it was previously stipulated upon in writing [Art. 1956], still
interest [by way of damages or penalty] can be recovered in
case of default even if there be no stipulation to the effect. [See
Zobel v. City of Manila, 47 Phil. 169J)

559

T
CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2209

(NOTE: If the amount of the debt is unliquidated, it is
judgment that will ascertain the amount. In such a
final
the
case, interest by way of damages shall be counted only from the
date the decision becomes final. [Montilla v. Agustinian Corp.,
25 Phil. 477; Seton Donna v. Inouye, 40 Phil. 728 and See Art.
2213] However, the court should not require the collection of
interest when the judgment on which it is issued does not give
it, and interest is not allowed by statute. This has been held
to be the rule even where interest on judgments is allowed by
statute, if the judgment does not include it. [Robles, et al. v.
Timario, L-13911, April 28, I960])

(NOTE: If the contract stipulates from what time interest
by way of damages will be counted, said stipulated time
controls, and therefore the interest is payable from such time,
and not from the date of the filing of the complaint. [Firestone
Tire & Rubber Co. v. Ines Chavez & Co., Ltd., et al., L-11162,
Dec. 4, 1958])
(NOTE: If the term for payment was left to the will of the
debtor, the interest should not run from the time the action
was commenced in court, but only from default of payment
AFTER the period was fixed by the Court. [Tiglao v. Manila

Railroad Co., L-7900, Jan. 2, 1956J)

Arwood Industries, Inc.
v. D.M. Consunji, Inc.
GR 142277, Dec. 11, 2002
FACTS: Petitioner and respondent, as owner and
contractor, respectively, entered into a Civil, Structural, and
Architectural Works Agreement, dated Feb. 6, 1989 for the
construction of petitioner’s Westwood Condominium at 23
Eisenhower St., Greenhills, San Juan, Metro Manila. The
contract price for the condominium project aggregated to
P20,800,000. Despite completion of the condominium project,
the amount of P962,434.78 remained unpaid by petitioner.
Repeated demands by respondent for petitioner to pay went
unheeded. Respondent specifically prayed for payment of the
amount of P962.434.78 with interest of 2% per month or a
fraction thereof, from Nov. 1990 up to the time of payment.
560

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2209

ISSUE: Is the imposition of a 2% per month interest on
the award of P962.434.78 correct?

HELD: Yes. Upon the fulfillment by respondent of its
obligation to complete the construction project, petitioner had
the correlative duty to pay for respondent’s services. However,
petitioner refused to pay the balance of the contract price.
From the moment respondent completed the construction of
the condominium project and petitioner refused to pay in full,
there was delay on the part of petitioner.
Delay in the performance of an obligation is looked upon
with disfavor because, when a party to a contract incurs delay,
the other party who performs his part of the contract suffers
damages thereby. Dilationes in lege sunt idiosae (“Delays in law
are idious”). Obviously, respondent suffered damages brought
about by the failure of petitioner to comply with its obligation
on time. And, sans elaboration of the matter at hand, damages
take the form of interest. Accordingly, the appropriate measure
of damages in this case is the payment of interest at the rate
agreed upon, which is 2% interest for every month of delay.
Article 2209 specifies the appropriate measure of damages
where the obligation breached consisted of the payment of sum
of money. ( See State Investment House, Inc. v. CA, 198 SCRA 390
[1991]; See also Pacific Mills, Inc. v. CA, 206 SCRA 317 [1992])
Payment of interest as penalty is a necessary consequence of
petitioner’s failure to exercise diligence in the discharge of its
obligation under the contracts. And even in the absence of a
stipulation on interest, under Art. 2209, respondent would still
be entitled to recover the balance of the contract price with
interest. Respondent court, therefore, correctly interpreted the
terms of the agreement which provides that “the owner shall
be required to pay the interest at a rate of 2% per month or the
fraction thereof in days of the amount due for payment by the
owner.”
(5) Query

In a loan, is it permissible to stipulate that in addition
to 10% interest for use of the money, the debtor would pay
an additional 10% by way of penalty (penal clause) in case of
default!
561

T
CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2209

ANS.: Generally, the answer should be in the affirmative,
for after all, if there is NO default, the additional 10% cannot
be recovered, and there would be no violation of the Usury Law
which in essence regtdates only interest (by way of compensation
for the use of the money). The two interests referred to are
indeed distinct and therefore separately demandable, and
should NOT be added. (See Lopez v. Hernaez, 32 Phil. 631 and
Bachrach Motor Co. v. Espiritu, 52 Phil. 346)
However, under the present Usury Law (as amended),
the word “penalties” is referred to, in case of a SECURED
debt, aside from the word “interests.” It would seem therefore
that a strict construction of the present Usury Law results in
a negative answer (in case of SECURED debts) to the query
posed hereinabove. The Lopez and Bachrach cases referred to
above were decided PRIOR to the amendment of the Usury
Law.
(6) Recovery of Interest in Case of Usury

Angel Jose Warehousing Co., Inc. v.
Chelda Enterprises and David Syjuico
L-25704, April 24, 1968

FACTS: A partnership (Chelda Enterprises and David
Syjuico) borrowed some P20,000 from Angel Jose Warehousing
Co. at clearly usurious rates from 2% to 2-1/2% PER MONTH).
ISSUES:
Can creditor recover the PRINCIPAL debt?
(b) If the entire usurious rate has been paid by the debtor,
how much of it can be recovered by said debtor from the
creditor?

(a)

HELD:
(a) Yes, the creditor can recover the PRINCIPAL debt. The
contract of loan with usurious interest is valid as to the
for the
loan, and void only with respect to the interest
loan is the principal contract while the interest is merely
an accessory element. The two are separable from each
other. (See Lopez v. El Hogar Filipino, 47 Phil. 249) The

—

v

Art. 2209

ruling on this point by the Court of Appeals in the case
of Sebastian v. Bautista, 58 O.G. No. 15, p. 3146, holding
that even the loan itself is void is WRONG.

With respect to the usurious interest, the entire interest

agreed upon is void, and if already paid, may be recovered
by the debtor. It is wrong to say that the debtor can recover
only the excess of 12% or 14% as the case may be
for
the simple reason that the entire interest stipulated is

—

indivisible, and being illegal, should be considered entirely
void. It is true that Art. 1413 of the Civil Code states:
“interest paid in excess of the interest allowed by the
usury laws may be recovered by the debtor with interest
thereon from the date of payment.” But as we construe
it, Art. 1413, in speaking of “interest paid in excess of
the interest allowed by the usury laws” means the whole
usurious interest; i.e., in a loan of Pl,000, with interest of
20% per annum or P200 for one year, if the borrower pays
said P200, the whole P200 is the usurious interest not
just that part thereof in excess of the interest allowed by
law. It is in this case that the law does not allow division.
The whole stipulation as to interest is void since payment
of said interest is the cause or object and said interest is
illegal . Note that there is no conflict on this point between
the new Civil Code and the Usury Law. Under the Usury
Law, in Sec. 6, any person who for a loan shall have paid a
higher rate or greater sum or value than is allowed in said
law, may recover the whole interest paid. The only change
effected therefore by Art. 1413, of the New Civil Code is
not to provide for the recovery of interest paid in excess
of that allowed by law, which the Usury Law already
provided for, but to add that the same can be recovered
“with interest thereon from the date of payment.” The
foregoing interpretation is reached with the philosophy
of usury legislation in mind; to discourage stipulation on
usurious interest. Said stipulation is treated as wholly
void, so that the loan becomes one without stipulation
as to payment of interest. It should not, however, be
interpreted to mean forfeiture even of the principal, for
this would unjustly enrich the borrower at the expense
of the lender. Furthermore, penal sanctions are available
against a usurious lender, as further deterrence to usury.
563

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2209

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

The principal debt remaining without stipulation
for payment of interest can thus be recovered by judicial
action. And in case of such demand, and the debtor incurs
in delay, the debt earns interest from the date of the
demand, whether judicial or extrajudicial (in the instant
case, from the filing of the complaint). Such interest is
not due to stipulation, for there was none, the same being
void. Rather, it is due to the general provision of law that
in obligation to pay money, where the debtor incurs in
delay, he has to pay interest, by way of damages. (Art.

that the judgments spoken of and referred to in CB [BS]
Circular 416 are judgments in litigations involving loans
or forbearance of any money, goods or credits. Any other
kind of monetary judgment which has nothing to do with,
nor involving loans or forbearance of any money, goods or
credits does not fall within the coverage of the said law for
it is not within the ambit of the authority granted by the
Central Bank [Bangko Sentral].)

(NOTE: As already adverted to, the Usury Law has

been repealed.)
GSIS v. Court of Appeals, et al.
GR 52478, Oct. 30, 1986
The Civil Code permits the agreement upon a
penalty apart from the interest. Should there be such an
agreement, the penalty does not include the interest, and
as such the two are different and distinct things which
may be demanded separately. The stipulation about
payment of such additional rate is a penalty clause, which
is sanctioned by law.
The usury law applies only to interest by way
of compensation for the use or forbearance of money.
Interest by way of damages is governed by Art. 2209 of
the Civil Code.

If a stipulation governing the rate of interest is inserted
in a contract for the payment of money, this rate, if lawful,
remains in force until the obligation is SATISFIED. The
interest that accrues prior to the date of the filing of the
complaints should be capitalized and consolidated as of
that date with the capital, after which the whole bears
interest at the contract rate until the amount is paid. The
contracted obligation is not merged in the judgment, but
remains in full force until the debt is paid. (Zobel v. City

FACTS: The buyer of a certain equipment, because of
certain alleged violations of warranties, refused to pay the
balance to the seller. Instead of tendering payment of said
balance and instead of depositing said balance in Court,
the buyer sought to have the sale rescinded on account of
the alleged breach of warranty. The alleged breach was not
however, proved.
667

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2213

ISSUE: Should the buyer pay interest on the balance?
HELD: Yes, on account of the default, counted from
the date of the filing of the complaint by the seller (there
apparently having been no extrajudicial demand). Incidentally,
the arguments that the debt was unliquidated until its amount
was determined by the appellate court at P3,600 and that
consequently, he cannot be made answerable for interest on
the amount due before the judgment in said court is completely
untenable. The price of the equipment under their contract of
sale was determined and known; hence, liquidated; and the
obligation to pay any unpaid balance thereof did not cease to
be liquidated and determined simply because the vendor and
the vendee, in the suit for collection disagrees as to its amount.
If the buyer had wanted to free himself from any responsibility
for interests on the amount he had already acknowledged he
still owed his vendor, he should have deposited the same in
Court at the very start of the action.

Abelardo T im and Esmadito Gumabon v.

A
GR 125817, Jan. 16, 2002

FACTS: Assessment of the damage on the vehicle was
heavily debated upon by the parties with private respondent’s
demand for P236,000 being refuted by petitioners who argue
that they could have the vehicle repaired easily for P20.000.

ISSUE: Was the matter a liquidated obligation?
HELD: The amount due private respondent was not a
liquidated amount that was already demandable and payable.
Upon the provisions of Art. 2213, interest “cannot be recovered
upon unliquidated claims or damages, except when the demand
can be established with reasonable certainty.” It is axiomatic
that if the suit were for damages, unliquidated and not known
until definitely ascertained, assessed, and determined by
courts after proof
interest at the rate of 6% per annum
should be due from the date the judgment of the court is made

.(at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to
be reasonably ascertained).

Sadly, petitioners failed to offer in evidence the estimated
amount of the damage caused by private respondent’s
unconcern towards the damaged vehicle. It is the burden of
petitioners to show satisfactorily not only that the injured
party could have mitigated his damages but also the amount
thereof; failing in this regard, the amount of damages award
cannot be proportionally reduced.
The questioned decision awarding private respondent
P236.000 with legal interest from July 22, 1990 as compensatory
damages and P30.000 as attorney’s fees is modified. Interest at
the rate of 6% per annum shall be computed from the time
judgment of the lower court is made until the finality of this
decision. If the adjudged principal and interest remain unpaid
thereafter, interest shall be 12% per annum computed from
the time judgment becomes final and executory until it is fully
satisfied.

(2) Necessity of Proving the Factual Basis

While no proof of pecuniary loss is necessary in order that
moral damages may be awarded, the amount of indemnity being
left to the discretion of the Court, it is, nevertheless, essential
that the claimant satisfactorily prove the existence of the
factual basis of the damages (Art. 2217) and its causal relation
to the defendant’s acts. This is because moral damages though
incapable of pecuniary estimation, are in the category of an
award designed to compensate the claimant for actual injury
Buffered, and not to impose a penalty on the wrongdoer. The
mere fact that a party was sued for instance without any legal
foundation, does not entitle him to an award of moral damages,
for it would make a moral damage a penalty, which they are
not, rather than a compensation for actual injury suffered,
which they are intended to be. Moral damages, in other words,
''

are not corrective or exemplary damages. (Malonzo v. Galang,

479 SCRA 1 (2006)

“Juries must often reason,” says one author, “according to

existed from collateral facts not directly proving, but strongly
tending to prove, its existence. The vital question in such cases
is the cogency of the proof afforded by the secondary facts. How
likely, according to experience, is the existence of the primary
fact if certain secondary facts exist?”

For the Supreme Court

—

Section 1

MORAL DAMAGES

Art 2217. Moral damages include physical suffering,
mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputa¬
tion, wounded feelings, moral shock, social humiliation, and
572

Physical suffering includes pain incident to a
surgical operation or medical treatment (Serio v.
American Brewing Co., 141 La. 290), as well as
possible FUTURE pain. (Southern Brewery & Ice Co.

v. Schmidt, 226 U.S. 162)

2)

Mental anguish is a high degree of mental
suffering and not a mere disappointment or regret
(Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. Cooks, 30 S.W. 497)
or from annoyance or vexation. (Johnson v. Western
Union Teleg Co., 128 Am. Rep. 905) However,
inconvenience amounting to physical discomforts is
a subject of compensation.

3)

Fright is one form of mental suffering. (Eastern v.
United Trade School Contracting Co., 77 Am. State
Rep. 859)

(b)

The suffering, etc. must be the proximate result of the
wrongful act or omission. (St. Francis High School v. CA,
GR 82466, Feb. 25, 1991)
Thus, the grant of moral damages is NOT subject to
the whims and caprices of judges or courts. The court’s
discretion in granting or refusing it is governed by reason
and justice. In order that an individual may be made
liable, the law requires that his act be WRONGFUL. The
adverse result of an action does not per se make the act
wrongful and subject the actor to the payment of moral
damages. (Barreto v. Arevalo, et al., 99 Phil. 771)

St. Mary’s Academy v. William Carpitanos
& Lucia S. Carpitanos, Guada Daniel,
James Daniel II, James Daniel, Sr. and
Vivencio Villanueva
GR 143363, Feb. 6, 2002

FACTS: Petitioner St. Mary’s Academy was made
liable for the death of Sherwin Carpitanos under Arts.
218 and 219 of the Family Code. It was pointed out that
petitioner was negligent in allowing a minor to drive and
in not having a teacher accompany the minor students in
the jeep.
Respondents, however, failed to show that the
negligence of petitioner was the proximate cause of
the death of the victim. Respondents Spouses Daniel
and Villanueva admitted that the immediate cause of
the accident was not the negligence of petitioner or the
reckless driving of James Daniel II, but the detachment
of the steering wheel guide of the jeep.
ISSUES: (1) Was petitioner liable for damages for
the death of Sherwin Carpitanos?; and (2) Was the award
of moral damages against petitioner proper?

HELD: On the first issue, considering that the
negligence of the minor driver or the detachment of the
steering wheel guide of the jeep owned by respondent
Villanueva was an event over which petitioner St. Mary’s
Academy had no control, and which was the proximate
cause of the accident, petitioner may not be held liable for
the death resulting from such accident.
On the second issue, petitioner cannot be held liable
for moral damages in the amount of P500,000 awarded
by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals.
Though incapable of pecuniary computation, moral
damages may be recovered if they are the proximate result
of defendants wrongful act or omission. (Art. 2217) In the
instant case, the proximate cause was not attributable to

overwhelming evidence presented by petitioner and
respondent Spouses Daniel that the accident occurred
because of the detachment of the steering wheel guide of
the jeep, it is not the school, but the registered owner of
the vehicle who shall be held responsible for the death of
Sherwin Carpitanos.

The grant of moral damages is expressly allowed
by law in instances where proofs are shown that mental
anguish, serious anxiety, and moral shock have been
suffered by the private respondent as a consequence of
the fraudulent act committed by the petitioner who took
advantage of the very limited education of the respondent.

(2) Social and Financial Standing

J jl*
o'

In Layda v. Court of Appeals (90 Phil. 724), the Supreme
Court held that the social and financial standing (including
the earning capacity) of the victim, is NOT important in
the assessment of moral damages, because the controlling
element is the dignity of man and his human value. However,
in Domingding and Aranas v. Ng, et al. (103 Phil. Ill), the
Court seemingly reversed its former stand when it held that
the social and financial standing of the offender and offended
party should be taken into account in the computation of
moral damages. In that case, where the trial court ordered
the offender, an overseer of a mango store to pay the victim
(a customer of the store, whom he had subjected to indignities
by embracing and kissing her inside a taxi) P50,000 as moral
damages, the Supreme Court reduced the award to a measly
Pl,000, considering the lack of wealth or financial consequence
on the part of both parties. In Yutuk v. Manila Electric Co.,
L-13016, May 31, 1961, the Court held that the aggrieved
party’s moral feeling and personal pride should be weighed in
the determination of the indemnity.
(3) Need for Certain Steps

The husband of a woman, who voluntarily procured her
abortion, cannot recover moral damages from the physician
who caused the same where the said husband appeared to have
taken no steps to investigate or pinpoint the causes thereof,
and obtain the punishment of the responsible practitioner.
(Geluz v. Court of Appeals, et al., L-16439, July 20, 1961)
(4) Necessity of Personal Injury
(a)

As a general rule, if a person is not himself physically hurt,
he cannot obtain moral damages. Thus, mere sympathy

576

*

Art. 2217

for a close relative’s physical injuries cannot grant moral
damages to the sympathizer, even if he also suffers mental
anguish, as a result of such sympathy. (See Strebel v.
Figueras, et al., 96 Phil. 321; 15 Am. Jur. 597-598 and
Araneta, et al. v. Arreglado, et al., 104 Phil. 529) Thus
also, if it is the wife who suffered the physical injuries,
moral damages may be recovered only by her, and not by
her next of kin or the husband. (Juana Soberano & Jose
B. Soberano v. Manila Railroad Co., L-19407, Nov. 23,

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

1966)
‘ (b) Exceptions

to the rule

Exceptions to the rule may be found in the last two
paragraphs of Art. 2219.
(5) Rule Under the Old Law

Under the old Civil Code, moral damages could not be
recovered for pain and suffering, even by the person personally
injured. (Marcelo v. Velasco, 11 Phil. 287 and Algarra v.
Sandejas, 7 Phil. 84)

The Code Commission decided to revise the rule, with the
following explanation:
“Denial of the award of moral damages has been
predicated on the idea that physical suffering, mental anguish,
and similar injury are incapable of pecuniary estimation. But
it is unquestionable that the loss or injury is just as real as
in other cases. The ends of justice are better served by giving
the judge discretion to adjudicate some definite sum as moral
damages. That is more equitable than that the sufferer should
be uncompensated. The wrongdoer cannot complain because it
was he who caused the injury. In granting moral damages, the
court proceeds upon the ancient maxim that when there is a
wrong, there is a remedy.” (Report of the Code Commission, p.
74)

(6) Mental Anguish

Ramos v. Ramos
L-19872, Dec. 3, 1974

FACTS: Because an action for reconveyance of real
properties brought against them had already prescribed, and
577

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2217

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2217

was resultantly dismissed, the defendants sued the plaintiffs
for moral damages, alleging that they had suffered from
worries, anxieties, and mental anguish because of the suit that
had been brought against them. However, while the action for
reconveyance had indeed prescribed, there was no showing
that the action had been maliciously brought. The plaintiffs in
the reconveyance case had honestly believed that they had a
good and valid cause of action.

even offered to reopen Alejandrino’s account. Alejandrino,
however, rejected the offers. Clearly then, while petitioner was
not in bad faith, its negligence caused the private respondent
to suffer mental anguish, serious anxiety, embarrassment and
humiliation, for which he is entitled to recover reasonable

ISSUE: May moral damages be assessed against the
unsuccessful plaintiffs?
HELD- No, moral damages cannot be awarded in favor
of the defendants, and against the unsuccessful plaintiffs. The
reason is because there was no malice in the institution of
the suit for reconveyance. If a case is filed in good faith, and
the defendant suffers from worries and anxieties, said mental
anguish is not the anguish where the law allows a recovery of
moral damages. The law does not impose a penalty on the right
to litigate.

Intermediate Appellate Court

American Express International, Inc. v.

Intermediate Appellate Court and
Jose M. Alejandrino, Nov. 9, 1988

Private respondent Alejandrino was awarded moral
damages amounting to P100.000 with 6% interest thereon
computed from the finality of this decision until paid because of
the alleged humiliation suffered by him when he was forced to
surrender his credit card at Bon Department Store in Seattle.
But as there are no pre-set spending limits to the use of the
Amexco credit card, petitioner could not be faulted for ordering
the immediate seizure of private respondent’s credit card.
Considering the large number of people availing themselves
of the pre-set spending privilege in the use of the credit card,
petitioner’s only protection consists in its ability to stop with
dispatch anyone wrongfully using the credit card.

Whatever humiliation or embarrassment Alejandrino
might have suffered on account of the seizure incident in
Seattle, the Director of Operations of Amexco’s Hong kong
office apologized to private respondent. The Director offered
to write a letter of explanation to Bon Department Store. He

Pan American World Airways, Inc. v.
GR 44442, Aug. 31, 1987

The award of moral damages by the trial court and the
Court of Appeals in favor of a Pan American passenger, who
was bumped off, in the amount of P500,000 as moral damages,
P200,000 as exemplary damages, and P100,000 as attorney’s
fees were considered by the Supreme Court to be exorbitant
and consequently reduced the moral and exemplary damages
to the combined total sum of P200,000 and the attorney’s
fees to P20.000. It retained the award of actual damages in
the amount of US$1,546.15 computed at the exchange rate
prevailing at the time of payment.

Danao v. Court of Appeals
GR 48276, Sept 30, 1987

The creditor not only filed an unwarranted foreclosure
proceedings, but also carried out the proceedings in a manner as
to embarrass the debtor by publishing the notice of extrajudicial
foreclosure and sale in the society page of a Sunday edition of
a widely circulated newspaper, instead of in the “legal notices”
or “classified ads” sections as usual in these types of notices,
in extraordinarily large and boxed advertisements, which
allegedly bespoke of the bank’s malicious intent to embarrass
and harass the defendant in alleged violation of the canons of
conduct provided for in Arts. 19, 20, and 21 of the Civil Code.

Both the Court of Appeals and the lower court took
cognizance of the debtor’s mental anguish, serious anxiety and
besmirched reputation traceable to the unfortunate publication.

The lower court awarded P100,000 moral damages, but the CA
reduced said amount to P30.000. The Supreme Court increased
the amount to P60.000.

(7) Courts Given Discretion to Award Moral Damages

Development Bank of the Phils, v.
Court of Appeals and Emerald Resort Hotel Corp.
GR 125838, June 10, 2003

Prudenciado v. Alliance Transport System, Inc.
GR 33836, March 16, 1987
Trial courts are given discretion to determine the amount
of moral damages. The Court of Appeals can only modify or
change the amount awarded when they are palpably and
scandalously excessive “so as to indicate that it was the result
of passion, prejudice or corruption on the part of the trial court.”
But where the awards of moral and exemplary damages are far
too excessive compared to the actual losses sustained by the
aggrieved party, they should be reduced to more reasonable

FACTS: DBP maintains that ERHC, a juridical person,
is not entitled to moral damages. ERHC counters that its
reputation was debased when the sheriffs and several armed
men intruded into Hotel Ibalon’s premises and inventoried the
furniture and fixtures in the hotel. The Court of Appeals (CA)
affirmed the trial court’s award of moral damages.

amounts.

While the amount of moral damages is a matter left
largely to the sound discretion of a court, the same when found
excessive should be reduced to more reasonable amounts,
considering the attendant facts and circumstances. Moral
damages, though incapable of pecuniary estimation, are in
the category of an award designed to compensate the claimant
for actual injury suffered and not to impose a penalty on
the wrongdoer. Moral damages are not intended to enrich a
complainant at the expense of a defendant. They are awarded
only to enable the iiyured party to obtain means, diversion or
amusements that will serve to alleviate the moral suffering he
has undergone, by reason of the defendants’ culpable action.
The award of moral damages must be proportionate to the
suffering inflicted.
Isabelita Vital-Gozon v. Court of Appeals and
Alejandro dels Fuente
GR 129132, July 8, 1998
A public officer, like petitioner herein, may be liable for
moral damages for as long as the moral damages suffered by
private respondent were the proximate result of petitioner’s
wrongful act or omission, i.e., refusal to perform an official duty
or neglect in the performance thereof.

Since moral damages are, in the language of Art. 2217,
“incapable of pecuniary estimation,” courts have the discretion
to fix the corresponding amount, not being bound by any self¬
serving assessment by the claimants.
580

Art. 2217

1

HELD: The CA erred in awarding moral damages to
ERHC, the latter having failed to present evidence to warrant
the award. In a long line of decisions, the Supreme Court
has ruled that the claimant for moral damages must present
concrete proof to justify its award. (Enervida v. Dela Torre, 154
Phil. 301 [1974], citing Algara v. Sandejas, 27 Phil. 284 [1914])
Moreover, as a general rule, moral damages are not
awarded to a corporation because, being an artificial person and
having existence only in legal contemplation, it has no feelings,
no emotions, no senses. It cannot, therefore, experience physical
suffering and mental anguish which can be experienced only
by one having a nervous system. The statement in People v.
Manero and Mamburao Lumber Co. v. PNB that a corporation
may recover moral damages if it “has a good reputation that is
debased, resulting in social humiliation” is an obiter dictum.
On this core alone, the award for damages must be set aside.
(ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corp. v. CA, 361 Phil. 499 [1999] and
Napocor v. Philipp Brothers Oceanic, Inc., GR 126204, Nov. 20,

any.

the award and its causal connection to the acts of the
driver, who is deemed as petitioner’s employee. Indeed,

Garciano v. Court of Appeals, et al.
GR 96126, Aug. 10, 1992
Moral damages are recoverable only if the case falls
under Art. 2219 in relation to Art. 21. In the case at bar,
petitioner is not without fault. Firstly, she went on an
indefinite leave of absence and failed to report back in
time for the regular opening of classes. Secondly, for
reasons known to herself alone, she refused to sign a
written contract of employment. Lastly, she ignored the
Board of Directors’ order for her to report for duty on July
5, 1982. The trial court’s award of exemplary damages
to her was not justified for she is not entitled to moral,
temperate, or compensatory damages.
In sum, the Court of Appeals correctly set aside the
damages awarded by the trial court to the petitioner for
they did not have any legal or factual basis.
(b)

“Analogous cases” refers to instances similar to the cases
enumerated in the article, and not to ALL causes of
mental anguish. (People v. Plaza, [C.A.] 52 O.G. 6609) One
example is the institution of unfounded suits, one after
another, all resulting in the dismissal of said suits; the
anguish and embarrassment suffered by the defendant
cannot be denied. (Haw Pia v. Court of Appeals, L-20047,
June 30, 1967) Ordinarily, a breach of contract cannot be

584

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2219

considered as included in the descriptive term “analogous
cases” used in Art. 2219, not only because Art. 2220
specifically provides for the damages that are caused by
a contractual breach but because the definition of quasi¬
delict in Art. 2176 of the Code expressly excludes the cases
where there is a pre-existing contractual relation between
the parties. The advantageous position of a party suing a
carrier for breach of the contract of transportation explains
to some extent, the limitations imposed by the new Code
on the amount of the recovery. The action for breach of
contract imposes on the defendant carrier a presumption
of liability upon mere proof of injury to the passenger; the
latter is relieved from the duty to establish the fault of
the carrier, or of his employees; and the burden is placed
on the earner to prove that it was due to an unforeseen
event or to force majeure. Moreover, the carrier, unlike in
suite involving quasi-delict, may not escape liability by
proving that it has exercised due diligence in the selection
and supervision of the employees. Incidentally, regarding
the claim that moral damages may be awarded because
of Art. 1170 (incidental fraud), suffice it to state that said
article merely sets forth a general principle on damages.
(See Geraldez v. CA, GR 108253, Feb. 23, 1994, 48 SCAD
508) As regards moral damages, Art. 2219 is controlling, it
being a specific provision thereon and as such, it prevails
over Art. 1170. (Verzosa v. Baytan, et al., 107 Phil. 1010)

Since respondent and his driver had been grossly
negligent in connection with the bus mishap which had
injured petitioner and other passengers and recalling
the aggressive maneuvers of respondent, through his
wife, to get the victims to waive their right to recover
damages even as they were still hospitalized for their
injuries, petitioner must be held entitled to such moral
damages. Considering the extent of pain and anxiety
which petitioner must have suffered as a result of her
physical injuries including the permanent scar on her
forehead, the amount of P30,000 would be a reasonable
award. Petitioner’s claim for Pl,000 as attorney’s fees is
in fact even more modest.
Mayo y Agpaoa v. People
GR 91201, Dec. 5, 1991

FACTS: June Navarette was driving a Lancer car
owned by Linda Navarette, her sister. On board the car
were Linda, Legionaria, Mae, Noel, Reymond, Antonette,
and Mercy. Before the accident took place, the Tamaraw
jeep driven by Danilo was first ahead, followed by the
Lancer car and behind the Lancer car was the Rabbit bus
driven by Mayo traveling toward the direction of Manila.
The Lancer car as well as the Rabbit bus following one
after the other overtook the Tamaraw jeep. The Lancer
car was then cruising steadily at the right lane of the road
at a speed rate of about 40 kilometers per hour. As the
vehicle approached the vicinity of Mabalacat Institute,
the Rabbit bus picked up speed and swerved to the left
lane to overtake the Lancer car which was running on
the right lane of the highway. When the Rabbit bus was
abreast with the Lancer, an oncoming vehicle from the

opposite direction appeared and flashed its headlights to
warn the bus to give way. The bus swerved to its right in
an effort to return to the right lane to avoid collision with
the oncoming vehicle, and in the process it hit the left rear
side portion of the Lancer car with its right front bumper.

Because of the impact, the driver of the Lancer lost control
of the wheel and the car crashed against the concrete
fence. Mayo was charged and convicted with the crime of
reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property with
multiple serious, less serious and slight physical injuries.
He filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals (CA) which
affirmed the tried court’s decision with the modification
that the appellant suffered a straight penalty of three
months, on the ground that the Indeterminate Sentence
Law is not applicable, the maximum penalty imposable
not exceeding one year. The complainants in the criminal
case were awarded damages. The CA sustained the trial
court.

ISSUE: Whether the findings of the trial court justify
the award of moral damages in the amount of P700,000 in
favor of Linda Navarette.
HELD: The Supreme Court modified the amount of
P700,000 as moral damages granted to complainant by
reducing it to P200.000 and holding that Linda is entitled
to moral damages. She suffered usuries as a result of the
criminal offense of Mayo. Moreover, her injuries resulting
in a permanent scar at her forehead and the loss of her
right eye gave her mental anguish, wounded feelings, and
shock. The psychological effect on her as regards the scar
on her forehead and her false eye must have devastated
her considering that women in general are fastidious on
how they look. More important was the loss of vision of
her right eye which was severely injured as a result of the
accident. Since the accident, Linda had to contend with
the loss of her eyesight on her right eye which necessarily
hampers her not only physically but also professionally
for the rest of her life. Before the accident, Linda, who
is a home economist by profession, was doing well in her
career. A graduate of the University of the Philippines
with the degree of Home Economics, she is the Assistant
Vice President as well as the Resident Manager of Club
587

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2219

Solviento receiving a gross income of PIO,000 a month.
Simultaneously with her work at Club Solviento, she
served as Food Consultant of Food City where she
received a monthly salary of P7.000. However, she had
to give up her consultancy job after the accident not only
because of her prolonged absences but because of the
physical handicap she suffered. Nevertheless, there is no
justification toward moral damages in favor of Linda for
the loss of her boyfriend. No doubt, the loss of her boyfriend
after the accident added to her mental and emotional
sufferings and psychologically affected and disturbed her.
However, there is no evidence to show that her boyfriend
left her after the accident due to her physical injuries. He
may have left her even if she did not suffer the slightest
injury. The reasons for the break-up of a courtship are too
many and too complicated such that they should not form
the basis of damages arising from a vehicular accident
Moreover, granting that her boyfriend left her due to her
physical injuries, there is no legal basis for the award of
moral damages in favor of Linda because of the loss of a
boyfriend. Article 2219 of the new Civil Code enumerates
cases wherein moral damages may be granted. Loss
of a boyfriend as a result of physical injuries suffered
after an accident is not one of them. Neither can it be
categorized as an analogous case. The award of P700,000
as moral damages in favor of Linda is unconscionable
and excessive. The Court rejects Linda’s claim for the
amount of Pl,000,000 as moral damages for the loss of
her boyfriend. She asked for the amount of P500,000 as
moral damages due to her personal injuries. Therefore,
the award for moral damages should not exceed P500.000.
Under the circumstances, the amount of P200,000 as
moral damages in favor of Linda is reasonable, just and
fair. Thus, moral damages may be awarded where gross
negligence on the part of the common carrier is shown.

Although incapable of pecuniary computation, such
damages may be recovered if they are the proximate
results of the defendant’s wrongfill act or omission.
(2) Rule With Respect to Contracts

Note that contracts are not referred to in this article.
However
(a)

Under Art. 2220, moral damages may be recovered where
the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith.

Filinvest Credit Corp. v. Mendez
GR 66419, July 31, 1987

»'

FACTS: A credit corporation sued an installment
buyer of a car to recover said car and/or the sum of money
when the latter’s check intended for the February, March,
and April installments bounced due to insufficiency of
funds. By virtue of an order of seizure by the court, the car
was repossessed. The buyer later redeposited the check
and credited for the months mentioned. When the buyer
negotiated with the credit company for the release of the
car, the latter demanded payment of the total outstanding
balance on the promissory note. Due to the persistent
pleas of the buyer, the credit company released the car to
him upon payment of the installment remaining unpaid
for the months of April, May, and June, in addition to the
costs incurred in repossessing. The court dismissed the
case on motion of the credit company.
HELD: The buyer is not entitled to damages. The
willingness of the credit company to allow the buyer to
pay only the unpaid installments for April, May, and
June, instead of the total outstanding balance and to
release the car as well as its voluntary motion to dismiss
the case indicates lack of fraud or bad faith on the part of
the credit company. The buyer was not without fault. He
was three months behind in his payments and he issued
a bouncing check.

Moral damages cannot be awarded in the absence of
a wrongful act or omission or fraud or bad faith. When the
589

action is filed in good faith there should be no penalty on
the right to litigate. One may have erred, but error alone
is not a ground for moral damages.

common carrier, moral damages may be recovered. (Arts.

’

“A criminal offense resulting in physical iiyuries.”
(a) If a passenger dies or is injured, and a criminal case is
brought by himself or by his heirs, in the proper case,
moral damages may be recovered.
(b) If there be no death or physical injuries, moral damages
cannot be recovered. (People v. Plaza, [C.AJ 52 O.G. 6609;
Strebel v. Figueras, 96 Phil. 321)
(c) If a taxi driver was negligent and injures a passenger, he
can be liable for moral damages, but not the taxi company,
for the company did not commit the crime. (See Cachero v.
Manila Yellow Taxicab Co., Inc., 101 Phil. 523)
(NOTE: Rule in Civil Actions: Moral damages are
NOT recoverable in damage actions predicated on a breach
of the contract of transportation in view of the provisions
of Arts. 2219 and 2220 of the new Civil Code. [Verzosa
v. Baytan, et al., 107 Phil. 1010] The exceptions to this

rule are: (a) where the mishap results in the death of a
passenger, and (b) where it is proved that the carrier was
guilty of fraud or bad faith, even if death does not result.
[Fores v. Miranda, 105 Phil. 266] The mere carelessness of
the carrier’s driver does not per se constitute or justify an
inference of malice or bad faith on said carrier’s part /Rex
Taxicab Co. v. Bautista, L-15392, Sept. 30, 1960), because
fraud, malice, or bad faith must be proved. (Soberano

People v. Mariano Fontanilla
L-25354, June 28, 1968

FACTS: Mariano Fontanilla, 52 years of age, was accused
by his servant, Fe Castro, a 15-year-old virgin of repeated carnal
knowledge with her for three months. She could not recall the
total number of times. She testified that she repeatedly yielded
because of his promises of marriage (despite the fact that he
was a married man), and because she was frightened by his
acts of intimidation. The accused made love to her during the
day when his wife was away, and at night, when the latter was
already asleep. One night, they were caught in flagrante on the
kitchen floor. Fontanilla denied the accusation stating, inter
alia, that because of his age, it was impossible for him to make
love to his wife more than once a week, much less, to have
had Fe carnally day and night. Fontanilla was found guilty in
view of the evidence presented. Regarding the repeated acts of
carnal knowledge, there is a presumption that an adult male
has normal powers of virility. The Court also awarded Fe or
her parents moral damages amounting to P500.

ISSUE: Is this award of moral damages proper?

HELD:
(a)

(

(b)

The award of only P500 is inadequate. The victim was
a virgin, and she was deflowered by Fontanilla. This
loss of virginity, together with the attendant shame
and scandal, entitles her to the sum of P2,500 in moral
damages. Her future as a woman is definitely impaired,
and the resultant prejudice against her engendered in the
male population of the barrio where she resides, cannot
be blinked away.

The award must not be in the alternative, for under Art.
2219 of the Civil Code, the parents are ALSO entitled to
recover moral damages. The conviction of the accused
suffices as a basis to adjudge him, in the same action,
liable for an award of moral damages, without independent
proof thereof, to the victim AND her parents, because the
law presumes that the parents also naturally suffered
besmirched reputation, social humiliation, mental
anguish, and wounded feelings.

(1993)

The indemnity to a rape victim has been increased

to P50.000.
People v. Eric Baid y Ominta
GR 129667, July 31, 2000
FACTS: Appellants was accusing of raping a
27-year-old woman diagnosed with schizophrenia. Found
guilty, appellant assailed victim’s credibility on account
of her ailment.
HELD: It is medically established that schizophrenic
persons do not suffer from a clouding of consciousness and
gross deficits of memory. The victim could understand
the questions propounded to her relating to the rape and
could give responsive answers to them despite exhibiting
inappropriate emotions in the course of her testimony.
Notably, complainant’s submission to the sexual advances
of appellant notwithstanding, the intercourse was
without consent considering that schizophrenia caused
an impairment of the judgment on complainant. Hence,
appellant may be convicted of rape under Art. 335(2) of the
Revised Penal Code for the victim was completely insane
or deprived of reason when he had carnal knowledge
of her. The phrase “deprived of reason” includes those
suffering from mental abnormality, or deficiency, or some
form of mental retardation, those who are feeble-minded
although coherent.
The trial court is correct in awarding moral damages
in the amount of P50,000 in accordance with jurisprudence
that moral damages may be awarded in rape cases without
any need of proof of moral suffering. Additionally, civil
indemnity in the amount of P50.000 should have been
692

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2219

awarded the complainant consistent with the ruling
that rape victims are entitled to such an award without
need of proof except the fact of the commission of the
offense. (People v. Capillo, GR 123059, Nov. 25, 1999) The
prosecution’s plea that the indemnity should be raised
to P75,000 cannot be granted because such amount is
awarded only in cases of qualified rape. In the case at bar,
there have been no qualifying circumstances raising the
penalty to death. (People v. Lasola, GR 123152, Nov. 17,
1999)

Some Jurisprudential Developments Re Damages
for Rape

Members of the bench are enjoined to follow the
rules in the award of damages in criminal charges for
rape. (People v. Nava, Jr., 333 SCRA 749)
The award of civil indemnity “is not only a reaction
to the apathetic social perception of the penal law and the
financial fluctuations over time, but also an expression of
the displeasure of the Supreme Court over the incidence
of heinous crimes against chastity. (People v. Magat, 332

SCRA 517)

Civil indemnity is mandatory upon the finding of the
fact of rape, and it is not to be considered as moral damages,
the latter being based on different jural foundation and
assessed by the court in its sound discretion. (People v.
Bernaldez, 322 SCRA 462 and People v. Quilation, 341

SCRA 247)

Moral damages may be awarded to rape victims, in
addition to civil indemnity, after all, the anguish and the
pain that the victim had to endure are evident. (People v.
Hofilena, 334 SCRA 214) In this respect, moral damages
are imposed in rape cases involving young girls between 13
to 19 years of age, taking into account the immeasurable
havoc wrought on their youthful feminine psyche. (People
v. Gutierrez, 339 SCRA 452 and People v. Tagaylo, 345

SCRA 284)
Moreso, moral damages are not intended to enrich
the victims. Rather, they are awarded to allow them to
693

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2219

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

serve to alleviate their moral and psychological sufferings.
(People v. Pacina, 338 SCRA 195) Moral damages for rape
is fixed at P50,000. (People v. Bawang, 342 SCRA 147)
Civil indemnity of P50,000 is mandatory upon the
finding of the fact of rape (People v. Bato, 325 SCRA 671;
People v. Vedra, 342 SCRA 317; and People v. Omar, 327
SCRA 221), considering that the award is for each count
of rape proved. (People v. Antonio, 336 SCRA 366)
X

Be it noted that moral damages may be granted to
rape victims in such amount as the Supreme Court may
deem just without the necessity of pleading or proof of the
basis thereof. (People v. Arizapa, 328 SCRA 214)

SCRA 250)

'■

For rape cases, P50.000 is awarded as moral damages
without need of proof of mental and physical suffering.
(People v. Toquero, 339 SCRA 76) In short, a conviction
for rape carries with it the award of moral damages to the
victim without need of further proof. (People v. Sarmiento,
344 SCRA 345)

”*

Moral damages in the amount of P50.0O0 must be
awarded to her without need of further proof other than
that rape was committed against her. (People v. Diaz, 337
SCRA 521) For in rape cases, proof of mental and physical
suffering provided under Art. 2217 of the Civil Code can be
dispensed with because it is recognized that the victim’s
injury is concomitant with and necessarily results from
the odious crime of rape to warrant per se the award of
moral damages. (People v. Mangila, 325 SCRA 586)
Moral damages in rape cases should be awarded
without need of showing that the victims suffered
trauma of mental, physical, and psychological sufferings
constituting the basis thereof. (People v. Docena, 322

SCRA 820)
The conventional requirement of allegata et probata
in civil cases has been dispensed with in rape cases
where the civil aspect is included in the prosecution as
the mental, physical, and psychological trauma suffered

Art. 2219

u•

- I.

Otherwise stated, the increase of the civil indemnity
to P75.000 is justified if the crime was committed under
circumstances that justify the impositions of the death
penalty. (People v. Lacanieta, 330 SCRA 519)
Death indemnity in rape with homicide is P100,000
because the prevailing jurisprudence is that P50.000 is
for death and P50,000 is for rape. (People v. Salonga, 329
SCRA 468) However, the amount of P100,000 awarded
to the rape victims as indemnity ex delicto is excessive
where the assailant is liable only for simple rape. (People
v. Bartolome, 323 SCRA 836)
A person claiming moral damages must prove the
existence of bad faith by clear and convincing evidence for
the law always presumes good faith. It is not enough that
one merely suffered sleepless nights, mental anguish,
serious anxiety
as the result of the actuations of the
other party. (Ace Hardware Corp. v. CA, 338 SCRA 572)
Moral damages must be awarded even in the absence of
any allegation and proof of the heirs’ emotional suffering.
(People u. Panado, 348 SCRA 679)

The Supreme Court has consistently computed the
loss of earning capacity based on the life expectancy of the
deceased, and not that of the heir. (Pestano v. Sumayang,
347 SCRA 870) Compensation for lost income is in the
nature of damages and as such requires due proof of the
damages suffered, i.e., there must be unbiased proof of
the deceased’s average income. (People v. Ereno, 326
SCRA 197) The testimony of the victim’s wife, as to the
695

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2219

earning capacity of her husband sufficiently establishes
the basis for making such an award. (People v. Cual, 327

SCRA 623)

The indemnity for death caused by a quasi-delict
used to be pegged at about P3,000, based on Art. 2006
of the Civil Code, but the amount has been gradually
increased through the years because of the declining value
of Philippine currency, and at present, the prevailing
jurisprudence fixes the amount at P50,000. (Pestano v.
Sumayang, 346 SCRA 870)
Current jurisprudence mandates the award of
P50.000 as indemnity ex delicto. (People v. Garces, Jr., 322
SCRA 834) A relatively recent decision has held the view,
however, that the court was in error when it awarded
the exorbitant amount of P500,000 as damages, without
designating the purpose and basis for such “general"
award of damages. (People v. Castillo, 333 SCRA 506)

does not make him liable for malicious prosecution, for
generally, it is the Government or representative of the State
that takes charge of the prosecution of the offense. There must
be proof that the prosecution was prompted by a sinister design
to vex and humiliate a person, for if the rule were otherwise,
every acquitted person can turn against the complainant in a
civil action for damages. (Buenaventura, et al. v. Sto. Domingo,
et al., L-10661, March 2, 1958) In order that moral damages
may be recovered as a result of a writ of attachment wrongfully
issued, malice must be proved to be present. (Lazatin v. Tuano,
et al., L-12736, July 31, 1961)

Alejo Madera, et al.
v. Heirs of Salvador Lopez
L-37105, Feb. 10, 1981
Statutory basis for an action for moral damages due to
malicious prosecution can be found in Arts. 19, 2176, and 2219
of the Civil Code.

PCIB v. Intermediate Appellate Court
GR 73610, April 19, 1991

If there is no libel, etc. because of the defense of “privileged
communication” and malice is not proved, there will be no
award of moral damages. This is particularly true in the case
of court pleadings which may contain libelous remarks. (See De
la Rosa, et al. v. Maristela, [CA..] 50 O.G. 254)

An action to recover damages from the plaintiff who secures
a writ of attachment based on a false affidavit is identical with
or analogous to the ordinary action for malicious prosecution.
Moral damages may be recovered by the defendant on account
of an improperly and irregularly issued writ of attachment.

On the other hand, the allegation of forgery in a document
is all but a defamation, which in the light of Art. 2217 could by
analogy be a ground for payment of moral damages, considering
the wounded feelings and besmirched reputation of the parties
involved. (Heirs of Justiva v. Court of Appeals, L-16396, Jan.

“Malicious Prosecution”

The defendant, to be liable, must have acted deliberately
knowing that his charges were false and groundless. Indeed, the
mere act of submitting a case to the authorities for prosecution
696

A civil action for damages for malicious prosecution is
allowed under the Civil Code, more specifically Arts. 19, 20, 26,
29, 32, 33, 35, and 2219(8) thereof.

In order that such a case can prosper, however, the
following three elements must be present, to wit: (1) the fact
of the prosecution and the further fact that the defendant
was himself the prosecutor, and that the action was finally
terminated with an acquittal; (2) that in bringing the action,
the prosecutor acted without probable cause; and (3) the

prosecutor was actuated or impelled by legal malice. Thus, a
party injured by the filing of a court case against him, even if
he is later on absolved, may file a case for damages grounded
either on the principle of abuse of rights, or on malicious
prosecution. It is well-settled that one cannot be held liable
for maliciously instituting a prosecution where one has acted
with probable cause (defined as the existence of such facts and
circumstances as would excite the belief, in a reasonable mind,
acting on the facts within the knowledge of the prosecutor,
that the person charged was guilty of the crime for which he
was prosecuted). To constitute malicious prosecution, there
must be proof that the prosecution was prompted by a sinister
design to vex and humiliate a person, that it was initiated
deliberately by the defendant knowing that his charges were
false and groundless. Concededly, the mere act of submitting

a case to the authorities for prosecution does not make one
liable for malicious prosecution. Proof and motive that the
institution of the action was prompted by a sinister design to
vex and humiliate a person must be clearly and preponderantly
established to entitle the victims to damages.

In the case at bar, there is no proof of a sinister design on
the part of petitioners to vex or humiliate private respondent
by instituting the criminal case against him. While petitioners
may have been negligent to some extent in determining the
liability of private respondent for the dishonored check, the
same is not so gross or reckless as to amount to bad faith
warranting an award of damages. The questioned judgment
in the instant case attests to the propensity of trial judges
to award damages without basis. Lower courts are hereby
cautioned anew against awarding unconscionable sums as
damages without bases therefor.

Bar Question

L-14733, Sept. 30, 1960) And neither does it give rise to
an action for specific performance. Therefore, only actual
damages (wedding dress, etc.) may be asked; not moral
damages unless there is criminal or moral seduction or
abuse of a right.

A is liable for actual, moral and exemplary damages.
His acts constituted a palpable, unjustifiable, and willful

Velez, L-20089, Dec. 26, 1964)
Arturo de Guzman v. NLRC, et al.
GR 90856, July 23, 1992

grant the relief warranted by the allegation and the proof
even if it is not specifically sought by the injured party.
(Heirs of Celso Amarante v. CA, 185 SCRA 585)

In the case at bar, while the private respondents did
not categorically pray for damages, they did allege that
the petitioner, taking advantage of his position as general
manager, had appropriated the properties of the Affiliated
Machineries Agency Ltd. (AMAL) in payment of his own
claims against the company. That was averment enough
of the iryury they suffered as a result of the petitioner’s
bad faith. It is stressed that the petitioners’ liability to
the private respondents is a direct liability in the form of
moral and exemplary damages and not a solidary liability
with AMAL for the claims of its employees against the
company. He is being held liable not because he is the
general manager of AMAL but because he took advantage
of his position by applying the properties of AMAL to the
payment exclusively of his own claims to the detriment
of the other employees. In the instant case, the fact that
no actual or compensatory damages was proven before
the trial court does not adversely affect the private
respondents’ right to recover moral damages. Thus,
moral damages may be awarded in the cases referred
to in the Chapter on Human Relations of the Civil Code
(Arts. 19-31) without need of proof that the wrongful act
complained of had caused any physical injury upon the

FACTS: On Dec. 1, 1989, through its Second Division,
the Supreme Court rendered a decision declaring the National
Irrigation Administration (NIA) a government agency
performing proprietary functions. Like an ordinary employer,
NIA was held liable for the injuries, resulting in the death
of Francisco Fontanilla, caused by the fault or negligence of
NIA’s driver-employee Hugo Garcia. The Court ordered NIA
to pay the Fontanilla spouses, the victim’s parents, for the
death of the victim, for hospitalization and burial expenses,
for moral and exemplary damages, and attorney’s fees. NIA
moved for reconsideration, alleging that it does not perform
solely or primarily proprietary functions but as an agency of
the government tasked with governmental functions. Thus, it
may not be held liable for damages for injuries caused by its
employees to a third person.

a corporate personality separate and distinct from the
government and thus is governed by the Corporation Law (now
Corporate Code). It had its own assets and liabilities. It also
has corporate powers to be exercised by a Board of Directors.
To quote Sec. 2, subsection (f): “x x x and to transact such
business, as are directly or indirectly necessary, incidental
or conducive to the attainment of the above powers and
objectives, including the power to establish and maintain
subsidiaries, and in general, to exercise all the powers of a
corporation under the Corporation Law, insofar as they are not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Act.” (Sec. 2, subsection
[f]) The National Irrigation Administration is a government
agency with a juridical personality separate and distinct from
the government. It is not a mere agency of the government but
a corporate body performing proprietary functions. Therefore,
it may be held liable for damages caused by the negligent act of
its driver who was not its special agent.

Reyes v. Court of Appeals
GR 95535, Jan. 21, 1991

The bank is not liable for damages for closing a depositor’s
current account, where the latter is guilty of “kiting” activities
as defined in the Central Bank Manual, i.e., “where a depositor,
having only one account of his own, can still engage in kiting
by using the account or accounts of other persons who may be
willing to act and cooperate with him.”

injury. Though incapable of pecuniary computation, they may
be recovered if they are the proximate result of the defendant’s
wrongful act or omission. Damages are not intended to enrich
the complainant at the expense of a defendant. They are
awarded only to alleviate the moral suffering that the injured
party had undergone by reason of the defendant’s culpable
action.
There is no hard and fast rule in the determination of
what would be a fair amount of moral damages, since each case
must be governed by its own peculiar circumstances. Although
the Court of Appeals increased the moral and actual damages
awarded by the trial court, the awards are not excessive but
only commensurate with the mental anguish, hardships,
inconvenience, and expenses that respondent suffered and
incurred as a result of the malicious prosecutions initiated by
the petitioners against him.

Art 2220. Willful injury to property may be a legal
ground for awarding moral damages if the court should find
that, under the circumstances, such damages are justly due.
The same rule applies to breaches of contract where the
defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith.

COMMENT:
(1) Willfill Injury to Property and Breaches of Contracts

If the breach of a contract is neither malicious nor
fraudulent, no award of moral damages may be given.

The evidence shows that private respondent made little
more than taken effort to seek the ejectment of squatters from
the land, revealing her real intention to be finding a way of
getting out of her contract. Her failure to make use of her
resources and her insistence on rescinding the sale show quite

clearly that she was indeed just looking for a way to get out of
her contractual obligation by pointing to her own abject failure
to rid the land of squatters.

The award of moral damages is in accordance with Art.
2220 which provides that moral damages may be awarded
in case of a breach of contract where the defendant acted
fraudulently or in bad faith.
(NOTE: In view of Art. 2220, it has been held that in
culpa contractual or breach of contract, moral damages may be
recovered when the defendant acted in bad faith or was guilty
of gross negligence [amounting to bad faith] or in wanton
disregard of his contractual obligation. Since the law presumes
good faith, the person claiming moral damages must prove bad
faith or ill motive by clear and convincing evidence. [MOF Co.
v. Enriquez, GR 149280, May 9, 2002])

Section 2
NOMINAL DAMAGES

Art. 2221. Nominal damages are adjudicated in order
that a right of the plaintiff, which has been violated or
invaded by the defendant, may be vindicated or recognized,
and not for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff for any
loss suffered by him.
COMMENT:
(1) The Grant of Nominal Damages

— Reason Therefor

“There are instances when the vindication or recognition
of the plaintiffs right is of the utmost importance to him as
in the case of trespass upon real property. The awarding of
nominal damages does not therefore run counter to the maxim
de minimio non curat lex (the law does not cure or bother with
trifles).’’ (Report of the Code Commission, p. 74)

LRT v. Navidad,
GR 145804, Feb. 6, 2003
Nominal damages are adjudicated in order that a right
of the plaintiff, which has been violated or invaded by the
defendant, may be vindicated or recognized, and not for the
purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff for any loss suffered by

him. (Art. 2221)

It is an established rule that nominal damages cannot
co-exist with compensatory damages. (Medina v. Cresencia,
99 Phil. 506) Nor is the award of nominal damages. Nor is
the award of nominal damages in addition to actual damages
tenable.
(2) Effect of Granting Compensatory

and Exemplary

Damages
If compensatory and exemplary damages have been
awarded, this award is by itself a judicial recognition that the
plaintiffs right has been violated. Therefore, a further award,
this time of nominal damages, is unnecessary and improper.
606

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 2221

(Meding, et al. v. Cresencia, et al., L-8194, July 11, 1956) It
should be remembered that nominal damages are merely for
the VINDICATION of a right that has been violated, not for
indemnification of the loss suffered. (Ventanilla v. Centeno,
L 14333, Jan. 28, 1961)

Sumalpong v. Court of Appeals
GR 123404, Feb. 26,1997
79 SCAD 969

FACTS: Some species of injury have been caused to
complainant because of the medical expenses he has incurred
in having his wounds treated, and the loss of income due to his
failure to work during his hospitalization.
ISSUE: In the absence of competent proof of the amount
of actual damages, is the complainant entitled only to nominal
damages?

HELD: Yes. Whenever there has been a violation of an
ascertained legal right, although no actual damages resulted
or none are shown, the award of nominal damages is proper.
Nominal damages are adjudicated in order that a right of the
plaintiff, which has violated or invaded by the defendant,
may be vindicated or recognized, and not for the purpose of
indemnifying the plaintiff for any loss suffered by him.
Philippine Telegraph & Telephone Corp,
and Louie Cabalit v. Court of Appeals and
Lolita Sipe Escoro
GR 139268, Sept. 3, 2002
FACTS: Petitioner PT&T, for a fee, undertook to send
private respondent two telegraphic money orders in the sum
of P3,000. Petitioner, however, failed to deliver the money to
respondent immediately after the money order was transmitted
to its Cubao branch. It was almost two months from transmittal
that respondent was finally able to have her money.
ISSUE: For the violation of the right of private respondent
to receive timely delivery of the money transmitted through
petitioner corporation, is an award of nominal damages
appropriate?
607

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2222

HELD: Yes. An amount of P20.000 by way of nominal
damages, considering all that private respondent has had to
go through, is reasonable and fair. “Nominal damages are
adjudicated in order that a right of the plaintiff, which has
been violated or invaded by the defendant, may be vindicated
or recognized and not for the purpose of indemnifying the
plaintiff for any loss suffered by him.” (Art. 2221, Civil
Code) (Sumalpong v. CA, 268 SCRA 764) Nominal damages
may be awarded in every obligation arising from any source
enumerated in Art. 1157 or, generally, in every case where
property right is invaded.
(3) Liability of a Negligent Lawyer

A lawyer who through negligence fails to deposit on time
the appeal bond, and to file the record of appeal within the
extension period (asked for by him) and granted by the Court,
while not liable for actual damages, may nevertheless be liable
for nominal damages. This is discretionary on the part of the
Court. (Ventanilla v. Centeno, L-14333, Jan. 28, 1961)

Section 3
TEMPERATE OR MODERATE DAMAGES
Art. 2224. Temperate or moderate damages, which are
more than nominal but less than compensatory damages,
may be recovered when the court finds that some pecuniary
loss has been suffered but its amount cannot, from the nature
of the case, be proved with certainty.

COMMENT:
(1) Reason for Allowing Temperate or Moderate Damages

“In some States of the American union, temperate
damages are allowed. There are cases where from the nature
of the case, definite proof of pecuniary loss cannot be offered,
609

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2224

although the court is convinced that there has been such loss.
For instance, injury to one’s commercial credit or to the goodwill
of a business firm is often hard to show with certainty in terms
of money. Should damages be denied for that reason? The
judge should be empowered to calculate moderate damages in
such cases, rather than that the plaintiff should suffer, without
redress, from the defendant’s wrongful act.” (Report of the Code
Commission, p. 75)
(2) Suffering of Some Pecuniary Loss

It is imperative under Art. 2224 that “some pecuniary loss
has been suffered” (though uncertain); otherwise, temperate
damages cannot be recovered. (See Victorino, et al. v. Nora
[CA.] 52 O.G. 911) As long, however, as there has been an
injury (such as a physical injury) the fact that the same is
incapable of pecuniary estimation does not preclude the right
to an indemnity. Here, the judge may calculate moderate
damages. (Necesito u. Paras, 104 Phil. 75)

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Arte. 2225-2226

Temperate damages can and should be awarded on top of
actual or compensatory damages in instances where the injury
is chronic and continuing. And because of the unique nature
of such cases, no incompatibility arises when both actual and
temperate damages are provided for. The reason is that these
damages cover two distinct phases.
As it would not be equitable — and certainly not in the
best interests of the administration of justice — for the victim
in such cases to constantly come before the courts and invoke
their aid in seeking adjustments to the compensatory damages
previously awarded — temperate damages are appropriate.
The amount given as temperate damages, though to a certain
extent speculative, should take into account the cost of proper
care.

SCRA 229, Comsavings Bank [now GSIS Family Bank] v.
Capostrano, 704 SCRA 72, and Adriano v. Lasala)]

the circumstances.

Consolidated Plywood Industries, Inc., et al. v.
Court of Appeals, et al.
GR 101706, Sept 23, 1992
In the case at bar, there was no showing nor proof that
petitioner was entitled to an award of this kind of damages
in addition to the actual damages it suffered as a direct
consequence of private respondents’ act.
The nature of the contract between the parties is such
that damages which the innocent party may have incurred can
be substantiated by evidence.
Ramos v. Court of Appeals
GR 124354, April 11, 2002
The amount of damages which should be awarded, if they
are to adequately and correctly respond to the iiyury caused,
should be one which compensates for pecuniary loss incurred
and proved, up to the time of trial, and one which would meet
pecuniary loss certain to be suffered but which could not, from
the nature of the case, be made with certainty.

which under Art. 2227 of the New Civil Code “shall be equi¬

indemnity or a penalty, shall be equitably reduced if they
are iniquitous or unconscionable.

V

,nl

(1) Equitable Reduction of Liquidated Damages

The reason is that in both, the stipulation is contra bonos
mores. It is a mere technicality to refuse to lessen the damages
to their just amount simply because the stipulation is not
meant to be a penalty. An immoral stipulation is nonetheless
immoral because it is called an indemnity. (Report of the Code
Commission, p. 75)
(2) Effect of Partial or Irregular Performance

Under Art. 2227, liquidated damages shall be reduced if
iniquitous or unconscionable. Now then, suppose there has been
partial or irregular performance, can there also be reduction?
HELD: Yes, because the fundamental rules governing
“liquidated damages" and “a penalty clause” are the same.

Art. 2228. When the breach of the contract committed
by the defendant is not the one contemplated by the parties

Section 5

EXEMPLARY OR CORRECTIVE DAMAGES
Art. 2229. Exemplary or corrective damages are
imposed, by way of example or correction for the public
good, in addition to the moral, temperate, liquidated or
compensatory damages.

COMMENT:
(1) Reason for Imposing Exemplary or Corrective Damages

Although in the United States exemplary damages are
also called “punitive” damages, still the term “corrective” is in
harmony with the modem theory of penology.
Exemplary damages are required by public policy for
wanton acts must be suppressed. They are an antidote so that
the poison of wickedness may not run through the body politic.
(Report of the Code Com., pp. 75-76)
In the absence of moral, temperate, liquidated, or
compensatory damages, no exemplary damages can be granted,
for exemplary damages are allowed only in ADDITION to any
of the four kinds of damages mentioned. (Ventanilla v. Centeno,
L-14333, Jan. 28, 1961; Fores v. Miranda, 105 Phil. 266; and
613

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2229

Francisco v. GSIS, L-18155, March 30, 1963) It is advisable to
specifically ask in the complaint for exemplary damages (in the
proper cases), but the general prayer in the complaint for “other
remedies which may be just and equitable in the premises”
can allow, if warranted, the grant of exemplary damages. (See
Darang v. Belizor, L-19487, Jan. 31, 1967)

Guilatco v. City of Dagupan and Court of Appeals
GR 61516, March 21, 1989
To serve as an example for the public good, it is high time
that the court should serve warning to the city or cities concerned
to be more conscious of their duty and responsibility to their
constituents, especially when they are engaged in construction
work or when there are manholes on their sidewalks or streets
which are uncovered, to immediately cover the same, in order
to minimize or prevent accidents to the poor pedestrians.
Too often in the zeal to put up “public impact” projects
such as beautification drives, the end is more important than
the manner in which the work is carried out. Because of this
obsession for showing off, such trivial details as misplaced
flower pots betray the careless execution of the projects,
causing public inconvenience and inviting accidents.

Prudenciado v. Alliance Transport System, Inc.
GR 33836, March 16, 1987
The rationale behind exemplary or corrective damages is
to provide an example or correction for the public good.
A driver running at full speed on a rainy day, on a slippery
road in complete disregard of the hazards to life and limb of
other people cannot be said to be acting on anything less than
gross negligence. The frequent incidence of accidents of this
nature caused by taxi drivers, indeed, demands corrective
measures.
(2) Examples of Exemplary Damages
(a)

Exemplary damages were imposed against a corporation
which persisted in oppressively invading another’s rights
despite “cease and desist orders” from the Public Service

Commission. This imposition of exemplary damages
would be a reminder that economic power will never
justify a reckless disregard of the rights of others. (Castro,
et al. v. Ice and Cold Storage Industries, et al., L-10147,
Dec. 27, 1958)
(b) A victim shot in the jaw by the minor son of the defendant
with the father’s gun was given an award of P18.000.
The Court said that this will remind licensed possessors
of firearms of their peremptory duty to adequately
safeguard such dangerous weapons at all times, and
to take all requisite measures to prevent minors and
other unauthorized parties from having access thereto.
Moreover, competent observers have recently called
attention to the fact that the growing teenage hooliganism
in our society is principally due to parent’s complacency in
and neglect of their progeny. (Araneta, et al. v. Arreglado,
et al., 104 Phil. 529)
(c)

Exemplary damages in the amount of P2,000 was awarded
in a case where the overseer of a mango store abused
the confidence of a female customer by subjecting her to
indignities. According to the Court, this bespeaks of a
perverse nature, dangerous to the community. (Domingding and Aranas v. Ng, et al., 103 Phil. Ill)
(NOTE: If a mayor in good faith dismisses an
employee although the former was not authorized,
exemplary damages of P2,000 should be considered
excessive, and must be reduced to Pl,000. Exemplary
damages, in a case like this, according to the Court, should
be imposed only to curtail the abuses that some public
officials are prone to commit upon coming to power, in
utter disregard of the civil service rules which constitute
the only safeguard of the tenure of office guaranteed by
the Constitution. [Diaz, et al. v. Amante, L-9228, Dec. 26,

lucro cesante on a 20-80 ratio). Thus, 20% of the damage,
awarded by the appellate court, except the award of
PIO,000 as exemplary damages and P4.500 as attorney’s
fees and costs, shall be borne by defendant driver. Only
the balance of 80% needs to be paid by the driver and
his employer who shall be solidarily liable therefor to the
plaintiff. The award of exemplary damages shall be borne
exclusively by the defendants. The employer, of course, is
entitled to reimbursement from the driver.

Saguindang the amount of P30,000 as moral damages
and costs of the suit.

HELD: The trial court’s decision was upheld but
the penalty was reduced to reclusion, perpetua and with
the damages awarded modified. In accordance with
jurisprudence (People v. Baid, GR 129667, July 31, 2000;
People v. Dreu, GR 126282, June 20, 2000; and People
v. Licanda, GR 134084, May 4, 2000), complainant
Saguindang must be paid P50.000 as civil indemnity,
P50,000 as moral damages, and the additional amount of
P25.000 as exemplary damages, in view of the attendance
of aggravating circumstances, pursuant to Art. 2229 of
the Civil Code. (See People v. Santos, GR 131103, and
143472, June 29, 2000)
(d) If an employee commits a wrongful act, may his
employer be required to pay exemplary damages? NO,
except insofar as said employer had participated in or
ratified the act. The rule is that exemplary damages are
imposed primarily on the wrongdoer as a deterrent in the
commission of similar acts in the future. Since exemplary
damages are penal in character, the motive authorizing
their infliction will not be imputed by presumption to
the principal when the act is committed by an agent or
servant. Inasmuch as they are granted not by way of
compensation, but as a punishment to the offender and
as a warning to others, they can only be awarded against
one who has participated in the offense and the principal
therefore cannot be held liable for them merely by reason
of wanton, oppressive, or malicious intent on the part of
the agent. Moreover in this jurisdiction, in case of crimes,
exemplary damages may be imposed only when the crime
is committed with one or more aggravating circumstances.

30, 1960)

If the amount of exemplary damages is NOT specific, the
court can grant the same only in an amount that should NOT
exceed its jurisdiction. (Singson, et al. v. Aragon, et al., 92 Phil.

514)

(4) Effect of Granting Exemplary Damages on a Claim for

Nominal Damages

If exemplary damages are granted, nominal damages
cannot be given. (Medina, et al. v. Cresencia, et al., L-8194,

(5) Cases

Pan American World Airways, Inc.
v. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al.
L-74442, Aug. 31, 1987

A contract to transport passengers is quite different in
kind and degree from any other contractual relation. And this
is because of the relation which an air carrier sustains with
the public. Its business is mainly with the travelling public.
It invites people to avail of the comforts and advantages it
offers. The contract of carriage, therefore, generates a relation
attended with a public duty. Neglect or malfeasance of the
carrier’s employees, naturally, could give ground for an action
for damages.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

for a sizeable number of “capiz” shells in which transaction
Ms. Tinitigan expected to derive a profit of US$1,000. Ms.
Tinitigan had to return to the Hotel El Embajador from the
aircraft costing her US$20. She had to pay for additional
accommodations in said hotel for US$26.15 and the damage to
her personal property amounted to US$600. The earner, Pan
American World Airways, Inc., should be held liable to Ms.
Tinitigan in the amount of US$1,646.15 or its equivalent in
Philippine currency at the present rate of exchange as actual or
compensatory damages. Pan Am having breached its contract
with Ms. Tinitigan in bad faith, it is not error for the trial court
to have awarded exemplary damages. The rationale behind
exemplary or corrective damages is, as the name implies, to
provide an example or correction for public good. In view of its
nature, it should be imposed in such amount as to sufficiently
and effectively deter similar breach of contract in the future by
Pan Am and other airlines.

Araneta and Gamboa. In 1966, Garrido and Araneta proposed
to the Board of Directors that Capital Insurance obtain a loan
of P600,000 from progressive Bank, so that a better financial
. position could be projected when renewal was sought of the
license of its sister corporation Capital Life. Security of the
loan would consist of the SEF shares in Capital Insurance.
Garrido and Araneta also gave assurance that the loan will
not be used and would instead be placed on time deposit in
Progressive Bank. The assurance was of considerable weight
since Progressive was owned by Araneta and his family, and
Garrido was himself a director thereof. The Board approved
the arrangement and the loan was obtained with maturity
of 90 days and interest at 11% per annum. The money was
deposited in favor of Capital Life. In 1966, Garrido, as Capital
Life President, executed a deed assigning to Progressive all
the rights of Capital Life in said time deposit and granted
Progressive full control of the deposit of P600.000. On the
pretext that the loan was unpaid, Progressive caused the
foreclosure of the pledged SEF shares and its sale at public
auction through a notary public, resulting in said shares being
auctioned off to Progressive. SEF, Munoz, and Amat filed a
derivative suit against Garrido, Araneta, and Progressive. They

sued in their own behalf and in behalf of Capital Insurance
and prayed for annulment of the loan and the accompanying
pledge of SEF stock on the ground of breach of trust on the part
of Garrido, Araneta and the latter’s bank. They also accused
Garrido and Araneta of mismanagement of the corporation
and prayed for damages. The trial court declared the loan and
foreclosure null and void. It ordered the return of the shares
to Capital Insurance, while Garrido, Araneta and Progressive
were sentenced to pay P100,000 as exemplary or corrective
damages. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the
trial court.

HELD: The Supreme Court modified the judgment so as
to increase to P600,000 the exemplary or corrective damage

that Garrido, et al. were sentenced, jointly and severally,
and held that it finds inexplicable, not to say ludicrous,
unjust and inequitable, to hold petitioners liable to the
Progressive Bank for anything on account of the latter’s socalled “accommodation loan” of P600.000, considering that:
(1) the proceeds of the loan were immediately placed on time
deposit with the same lending institution; (2) a day after its
placement, the time deposit was assigned to the same Bank,
together with all rights to the interest thereon, full control of
the deposit being given to said Bank until the accommodation
loan was fully paid; (3) the Bank was at no time under any risk
whatsoever, for an “accommodation" that it could recall at its
pleasure because it retained total control of the loan proceeds
under time deposit with it; (4) while retaining full disposition
of the amount fictitiously loaned, said Bank reserved and did
exercise rights proper and appropriate only to the lender under
a genuine forbearance, such as charging interests and later,
even foreclosing on the security for alleged nonpayment; there
is no evidence that it ever set off interests on the loan with
interests that the time deposit should justly have earned, only
fair arrangement in the circumstances; (5) as found by the
trial court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals, the loan and
accompanying pledge were simulated and the bank was a party
to the simulation. The Court feels that the award of P100.000
in exemplary or corrective damages lets the respondents off
too lightly for the part they played in this affair. Both the trial
court and the Court of Appeals found that the defendants had
concocted a scheme “to divest SEF of its interests in capital
insurance and for themselves to own the controlling interest
therein,” and carried out that illicit objective. Said award of
damages should be increased to P600,000.

Northwest Airlines v. Dr. Jaime F. Laya
GR 145956, May 29, 2002

FACTS: Respondent Dr. Jaime F. Laya, a medical
practitioner, was bound for San Francisco via a first class
booking with Northwest Airlines (NWA). After his luggage
passed and was cleared through the X-ray machine of the
Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA). Laya proceeded
to NWA’s check-in counter and was issued a boarding pass.

620

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2229

However, while on his way to the first class waiting lounge.
Dr. Laya was approached by a NWA employee who requested
him to proceed to a long table where passengers were lined up.
There, the passenger’s Samsonite hand-carried attach^ cases
were being subjected to further inspection. Since he noticed
that he was carrying an attache case similar to those being
inspected, Laya acceded to the request.
In the course of the inspection, however, Laya noticed
that his attach^ case was treated differently. While the other
passengers were eventually allowed to carry their cases
on board the plane, he was asked to place his attach^ case
in a black garbage bag for which he was handed two paper
envelopes where he could put its contents. Laya felt that he was
singled out for this extraordinary treatment. His situation was
aggravated when the envelopes turned out to be too fragile for
the contents of his attach^ case. The envelopes were eventually
torn. Laya asked for a replacement and provided with a used
Duty-Free bag.

On May 25, 1991, Laya wrote to NWA and reported the
rude treatment accorded him by its personnel. An exchange of
communication ensued but NWA did not heed his complaint.
On Oct. 31, 1991, he filed a complaint for damages against NWA
before Br. 84 of RTC QC. After trial, judgment was rendered
in favor of Laya, and against NWA. Both parties appealed
the decision. NWA appealed the unfavorable ruling against it
while Laya appealed the award in his favor of only Pl million
as moral damages and P500,000 exemplary damages. In its
decision, promulgated on Aug. 16, 2000, the Court of Appeals
(CA) affirmed the trial court with modifications by reducing
the award of moral damages to P500.000 and the exemplary
damages to P250,000.

Its motion for reconsideration having been denied, NWA
went to the Supreme Court for relief, alleging the CA: (1)
gravely erred in ruling that respondent is entitled to the award
of damages, and (2) not ruling that the lower court erred in
finding that the United States Federal Airation Administration
(FAA) Security Directive 91-11 is unreasonable and did not
coincide with the carrier’s promise of polite and gracious
service.
621

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2229

HELD: The Supreme Court is convinced that Laya
suffered mental anguish and serious anxiety because of his
experience with NWA personnel for which he should be awarded
moral damages. He is also entitled to exemplary damages by
way of correction to the NWA for the public good (Art. 2229,
Civil Code) and in view of the malevolent manner by which
the NWA personnel treated him. Damages are not intended
to enrich a plaintiff at the expense of the defendant (See
Philtranco Services, Inc. v. CA, 273 SCRA 562 [1987]), hence,
the Court is further reducing the award of moral damages from
P500,000 to P100.000 and the amount of exemplary damages is
reduced from P250.000 to P50.000. The Court likewise awards
attorney’s fees in the amount of P25.000. (Art. 2208, Civil Code)
On the other point raised in the instant case, the Supreme
Court opined that the tragic event that unfolded on Sept. 11,
2001 underscores, more than ever, that airport and airline
personnel cannot afford any lapse in the implementation of
security measures mean to ensure the safety of airplane crew
and passengers. Airline carriers hold the lives of passengers in
their hands and they must at all times be vigilant on matters
affecting their safety.
After a careful review of the records of this case, the
Court finds that the security procedures adopted issued by
the NWA was only the result of a directive issued by the FAA
of which the NWA, being a U.S. carrier, is subject to FAA
Security Directive 91-11, which was in effect at the time of
the incident. Thus, on the action required by U.S. Air Carriers
the following procedures, in part, shall be applied to all hard¬
shell black, brown, or burgundy Samsonite briefcase by all U.S.
air carrier on flights departing Asia, Africa, and Europe. All
black, brown, or burgundy Samsonite briefcases shall only be
transported as check baggage. The air carrier shall deny the
passenger any access to the briefcase after it has been tendered
until the briefcase is claimed by the passenger upon arrival
at destination. Following the application of the procedures
above, the briefcase, shall be transported as checked baggage.
However, the contents of the briefcase may be returned to the
passenger for personal use aboard the flight.

It may be true that Laya was greatly inconvenienced by
the act of the NWA when his attach^ case was subjected to
622

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2229

further inspection and not allowed to bring it on board the
plane. Nevertheless, while the protection of passengers must
take precedence over convenience, the implementation of
security measures must be attended by basic courtesies. The
Court is inclined to believe the testimony of Laya that the
personnel who examined his attache case were rude, brusque,
arrogant, and domineering. On this score, the Supreme Court
agrees with the trial court and the CA in stating that “[a]ny
security measure must coincide with the passenger’s right to
be treated by the carrier with kindness, respect, and utmost
consideration in all matters relative to his trip.”
(6) Exemplary Damages Also Called ‘Punitive’ Damages

Dela Cruz v. Octaviano
833 SCRA 238
(2017)

Also known as “punitive” or “vindictive” damages, exem¬
plary or corrective damages are intended to serve as deter¬
rent to serious wrongdoings, and as a vindication of undue
sufferings and wanton invasion of the rights of an injured or
a punishment for those guilty of outrageous conduct.
(7) ‘Trafficking in Persons’

People v. Aguirre
845 SCRA 227
(2017)

In the case at bar, the Supreme Court asserted the fol¬
lowing holdings, including inter alia:
1.

under RA 9208, the purpose of “trafficking” is ex¬
ploitation which includes prostitution.

2.

the recruitment and transportation mentioned by the
law may be “with or without the victim’s consent
or knowledge.

3.

the criminal case of “Trafficking in Persons as a
Prostitute” is an analogous case to crimes of se¬
duction, abduction, rape, or other lascivious acts.
623

In fact, it is worse, thus, justifying the award of
moral damages; and
exemplary damages are imposed when the crime is
aggravated as in this case.

FACTS: The Oroville Development Corp. (ODC) was
deprived of beneficial ownership over its property without the
benefit of timely expropriation proceeding.

of Pl,000,000.00 fair and reasonable?
HELD: Yes, considering the factual circumstances, and
to serve as deterrent to the state (i.e. the National Transmis¬

Under Art. 2233, exemplary damages cannot be recovered
as a matter of right; the court will decide whether or not they
should be adjudicated.
Considering that a public official is the culprit here, the
propriety of such an award cannot be questioned. It serves
as an example or deterrent so that other public officials be
always reminded that they are public servants bound to
adhere faithfully to the constitutional injunction that a public
office is a public trust. That the aggrieved party happened to
be another public official will not serve to mitigate the effects
of petitioner’s having failed to observe the required degree of
accountability and responsibility.

Art. 2234. While the amount of the exemplary damages
need not be proved, the plaintiff must show that he is
entitled to moral, temperate or compensatory damages
before the court may consider the question of whether or not
exemplary damages should be awarded. In case liquidated
damages have been agreed upon, although no proof of loss
is necessary in order that such liquidated damages may be
recovered, nevertheless, before the court may consider the
question of granting exemplary in addition to the liquidated
damages, the plaintiff must show that he would be entitled
to moral, temperate or compensatory damages were it not
for the stipulation for liquidated damages.

GR 75801, March 20, 1991
FACTS: The Samahan, in representation of its 1,000
members, filed a complaint against Riverside Mills Corporation
for non-payment of PD 1713’s P1.00 daily wage increase and
630

\

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2237

P60 monthly emergency cost of living allowance with the
Ministry of Labor. The MOLE ordered Riverside to pay the
complainant Samahan additional mandatory ECOLA of P60 a
month and Pl.00 increase in the minimum wage, retroactive as
of August 1981. Thereafter, the balance of the judgment award
was computed at P3.3 million. It appears that the Development
Bank of the Philippines had instituted extrajudicial foreclosure
proceedings as early as 1983 on the properties and other
assets of Riverside, as a result of the latter’s failure to meet
its obligations on the loan it had previously secured from DBP.
Thereafter, Samahan sought to enforce the decision-award
against DBP. A notice of garnishment was served upon DBP
for the amount of P3.3 million.

ISSUE: Whether a writ of garnishment may be issued
against the proceeds of Riverside’s properties foreclosed by
DBP and sold to Rosario Textile Mills, by the application of
the worker’s right of preference under Art. 110 of the Labor
Code.

HELD: The Supreme Court set aside the order of the
Ministry of Labor and held that the disputed garnishment of
the money paid by Rosario to DBP corresponding to the partial
installment of the sales price of RMC’s foreclosed properties is
not justified. The authority of the sheriff is limited to money
or properties belonging to the judgment debtor in the labor
case concerned. Hence, when the sheriff garnishes the moneys
paid by the employer (Rosario Textile Mills) to Development
Bank of the Philippines, the sheriff, in effect garnished
funds not belonging to the employer but to the DBP. This
is violative of the basic rule that the power of the court or
tribunal in the execution of its judgment extends only over
properties unquestionably belonging to the judgment debtor.
Undoubtedly, when the sheriff garnished the funds belonging
to the Development Bank of the Philippines, he exceeded the
authority vested in him in the writ of execution, and when the
Deputy Minister of Labor sustained the same in his order, he
acted with grave abuse of discretion correctable by certiorari.

COMMENT:
(1) Civil Code Superior to Special Laws on Insolvency

In Velayo v. Shell Co. (Phil.) (100 Phil. 187), the Supreme
Court held that while the acts of a creditor who disposes
of his own credit, and not the insolvent’s property, but
in a scheme to remove such property from the possession
and ownership of the insolvent, may not come within the
purview of Sec. 37 of the Insolvency Law which makes
a person coming under it liable for double the value of
the property sought to be disposed of, still said creditor
can be so held liable for such damages under Arts. 2229,
2232, 2142 and 2143.

1. the purpose of rehabilitation proceedings is
to enable the company to gain a new lease on life and
thereby allow creditors to be paid than claims from its
earnings;
2. in order to determine the feasibility of a
proposed rehabilitation plan, it is imperative that a
thorough examination and analysis of the distressed
corporation’s financial date must be conducted;

Sonia has one car, the taxes on which have not yet
been paid. Once, the car fell into the sea, was salvaged, was
repaired, and has now been pledged with a creditor. If Sonia
is insolvent and has not paid for any of the acts done on her

salvaged it, the repairer, and the pledgee?

Art 2242

.

Article 667 of the Code of Commerce, the period during
which the Hen shall subsist is 20 days, has been modified by
the Civil Code. Article 2241, whereof, provides that credits
for transportation of the goods carried, for the price of the
contract and incidental expenses shall constitute a preferred
claim or lien on the goods carried until their dehvery and for
30 days thereafter. During this period, the sale of the goods
may be requested, even though there are other creditors and
even if the shipper or consignee is insolvent. But this right
may not be made use of where the goods have been deHvered
and were turned over to a third person without malice on the
part of the third person and for a valuable consideration. In
the present case, the cargo of cement was unloaded from the
vessel and delivered to the consignee on Oct. 3, 1980, without
any oral or written notice or demand having been made on
respondent Supreme Merchant Construction Supply, Inc. for
unpaid freight on the cargo. Consequently, after the lapse of
30 days from the date of delivery, the cargo of cement had
been released from any maritime lien for unpaid freight.

Art. 2242. With reference to specific immovable
property and real rights of the debtor, the following claims,
mortgages and liens shall be preferred, and shall constitute
an encumbrance on the immovable or real right:

(5) Case

Atlantic Erectors, Inc. v. Herbal
Cove Realty Corp.
GR 146568, March 20, 2003

FACTS: Petitioner avers that its money claim on the
cost of labor and materials for the townhouses it constructed
on the respondent’s land is a proper lien that justifies the
annotation of a notice of lis pendens on the land titles. For
petitioner, the money claim constitutes a lien that can be
enforced to secure payment for the said obligations. It argues
that, to preserve the alleged improvement it had made on
641

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2242

the subject land, such annotation on the property titles of
respondent is necessary.

Respondent Herbal Cove, upon the other hand, argues
that the annotation, is bereft of any factual or legal basis,
because petitioner’s complaint does not directly affect the title
to the property, or the use of the possession thereof. It also
claims that petitioner’s complaint did not assert ownership of
the property or any right to possess it. Respondent attacks as
baseless the annotation of the Notice of Lis Pendens through
the enforcement of a contractor’s lien under Art. 2242. It
points out that the said provision applies only to cases in
which there are several creditors carrying on a legal action
against an insolvent debtor.

Petitioner proceeds on the premise that its money claim
involves the enforcement of a hen and since the money claim
is for the non-payment of materials and labor used in the
construction of townhouses, the lien referred to would have to
be that provided under Art. 2242, which describes a contractor’s
lien over an immovable property.

ISSUE: Whether or not money claims representing
costs of materials for and labor on the houses constructed on
property are a proper lien for annotation of lis pendens on
the property title.

HELD: The pendency of a simple collection suit arising
from the alleged non-payment of construction services,
materials, unrealized income, and damages does not justify
the annotation of a notice of lis pendens on the title to a
property where construction has been done.
A careful examination of petitioner’s complaint, as well
as the relief it seeks, reveals that no such lien or interest over
the property was ever alleged. The complaint merely asked
for the payment of construction services and materials plus
damages, without mentioning
a
much less asserting
lien or an encumbrance over the property. Verily, it was a
purely personal action and a simple collection case. It did
not contain any material avertment of any enforceable right,
interest or lien in connection with the subject property. As it is,

—

642

—

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art. 2243

petitioner’s money claim cannot be characterized as an action
that involves the enforcement of a lien or an encumbrance,
one that would warrant the annotation, of the Notice of Lis
Pendens. Indeed, the nature of an action is determined by the
allegations of the complaint. (Producers Bank of the Phils, v.
Bank of the Philippine Islands, 340 SCRA 87 [2000]; and City
of Olongapo v. Stallholders of the East Bajac-Bajac Public
Market of Olongapo City, 343 SCRA 705 [2000])

Even assuming that petitioner has sufficiently alleged
such lien or encumbrance in its complaint, the annotation of
the Notice of Lis Pendens would still be unjustified, because a
complaint for collection and damages is not the proper mode
of the enforcement of a contractor’s lien.
Clearly then, neither Art. 2242 nor the enforcement of
the lien thereunder is applicable here, because petitioner’s
complaint failed to satisfy the requirement. Nowhere does it
show that respondent’s property was subject to the claims of
other creditors or was insufficient to pay for all concurring
debts. Moreover, the complaint did not pertain to insolvency
proceedings or to any other action in which the adjudication
of claims of preferred creditors could be ascertained

Art. 2243. The claims or credits enumerated in the
two preceding articles shall be considered as mortgages
or pledges of real or personal property, or liens within the
purview of legal provisions governing insolvency. Taxes
mentioned in No. 1, Article 2241, and No. 1, Article 2242,
shall first be satisfied.

Art 2244. With reference to other property, real and
personal, of the debtor, the following claims or credits shall
be preferred in the order named:
(1) Proper funeral expenses for the debtor, or children
under his or her parental authority who have no property
of their own, when approved by the court;
(2) Credits for services rendered the insolvent by
employees, laborers, or household helpers for one year
preceding the commencement of the proceedings in

(a) a public instrument; or (b) in the final judgment, if they

have been the subject of litigation. These credits shall have
preference among themselves in the order of priority of the
dates of the instruments and of the judgments, respectively.

COMMENT:
(1) Order of Preference in Connection With OTHER Prop¬
erties
(a)

The order of preference here in Art. 2244 is VERY
IMPORTANT. (See Art. 2251)

(b)

The order of preference here does not refer to specific
real or personal property. It refers to other property.

(2) Example

A, an insolvent, owes P500.000 in favor of a funeral
parlor, Pl million for the hospital expenses during the cancer
illness of his late wife, and P100,000 in favor of a pedestrian
whom he had hurt while driving his car carelessly and for
which he was held criminally and civilly liable. Unfortunately,
he has only P600,000 and an automobile, the purchase price
of which he has not yet paid. Give the order of preference of
the various creditors involved.

ANS.:
(a)

With respect to the automobile specific personal property
the unpaid seller shall be preferred. (Art. 2241)
645

Art. 2244

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

(b)

With respect to the P600.0OO, Art. 2244 should be applied.
The funeral parlor comes first, then the hospital, then the
pedestrian. Here, there is NO pro rata sharing; there is
a preference. Therefore, the funeral parlor will be given
P500.000; the hospital only PIOO.OOO. The hospital cannot
recover the deficiency of P900.000; and the pedestrian
cannot recover his PIOO.OOO.

(3) Taxes

Note that under Art. 2244, taxes (duties, assessments)
are placed only as Nos. 9, 10, 11. This rule applies to property
other than specific. If the property is specific, taxes are given
first preference. (See Arts. 2243, 2247, 2249)
(4) Re Par. 14 (Ordinary Credits and Final Judgments)

It would seem here that an ordinary credit evidenced by
public
instrument and a final judgment are placed on an
a
EQUAL PLANE; hence, if both are of the same date, there
will be a pro rata sharing.

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

In the meantime, the father, Dominador, had borrowed
from one Jesus Gigante Pl,570. And on May 6, 1958, for
failure to pay, Dominador was ordered to give Jesus the sum
borrowed with interest and attorney's fees. Pursuant to a writ
of execution, the Sheriff levied
on May 29, 1961
the
house in question. Jesus bought the house at public auction
on June 23, 1961, and asked for a writ of possession. Neither
judgment nor levy nor sale was recorded on the Torrens Title.
The Bank blocked this writ of possession on the ground that
it was already the owner of the land and the house. Jesus,
alleging ownership to the house, now sues the Bank and
Rolando on the ground that the transfer from Dominador to
Rolando was fictitious and void, but Dominador was not made
a party to the suit.
ISSUE: Who should be considered the owner of the

—

(a)

The Republic Bank should be considered the owner of
the house (and of the land). Reason: The judgment, levy
and sale in Jesus’ favor is not recorded on the Torrens
Title. Upon the other hand, the Bank’s right is based
on a real estate mortgage duly recorded on April 24,
1959. The Bank’s registered mortgage is thus superior
to both said judgment and levy and sale. By virtue of
the foreclosure sale, the land and the house cannot now
be taken by Jesus. Note that the Bank never acted in
bad faith.

(b)

The transfer of the house
alleged to be fictitious and
fraudulent from Dominador, the father, to Rolando, the
son, cannot prosper
for Dominador, an indispensable
party, is not a party to the present case. Dominador is
entitled to be heard to defend the validity of the transfer
to his son, Rolando.

HELD: It is true that under the New Civil Code,
there is no preference among specific creditors over
the same property (except the government’s preference
as taxes over the specific property involved); instead,
there merely is pro rata concurrence. BUT there is one
exception to this: when there have been attachments and
executions, there is still preference among them in order
of time they were levied upon in the Registry; otherwise,
the advantage of attachments and executions would be
lost by the simple expedient of simply obtaining other
attachments and executions, no matter how much later
in point of time. Therefore, the P37.000 should satisfy
first the first three attachments (total of P32.000). The
excess P5,000 can now be applied to the 4th attachment.

(2) When Retroactivity is Allowed

TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS
Art. 2252. Changes made and new provisions and rules
laid down by this Code which may prejudice or impair vested
or acquired rights in accordance with the old legislation
shall have no retroactive effect.

For the determination of the applicable law in cases
which are not specified elsewhere in this Code, the following
articles shall be observed.

COMMENT:
(1) Comment of the Code Commission (Re Non-Impairment

of Vested Rights)

“Laws shall have no retroactive effect, unless the contrary
is provided. The question of how far the new Civil Code should
be made applicable to past acts and events is attended with
the utmost difficulty. It is easy enough to understand the
abstract principle that laws have no retroactive effect because
vested or acquired rights should be respected. But what are
vested or acquired rights? The Commission did not venture
to formulate a definition of a vested or acquired right seeing
that the problem is extremely complicated.
“What constitutes a vested or acquired right will be
determined by the courts as each particular issue is submitted
to them, by applying the transitional provisions sets forth, and
in case of doubt, by observing Art. 9 governing the silence
or obscurity of the law. In this manner, the Commission is
confident that the judiciary with its enlightenment and high
sense of justice will be able to decide in what cases the new
one should be binding. This course has been preferred by the
Commission, which did not presume to be able to foresee and
adequately provide for each and every question that may rise."
(Report of the Code Commission, pp. 165-166)

By implication, new provisions of the Code that do
not prejudice vested rights can be given retroactive effect.
Examples are those found in the chapter on Human Relations.
(Velayo v. Shell Co., 100 Phil. 187)
(3) ‘Vested Right’ Defined

In the case of Benguet Consolidated Mining Co. v. Pineda
(L-7231, Mar. 28, 1951), the Supreme Court defined a vested
right as property which has become fixed and established, and
is no longer open to doubt or controversy. “It is an immediately
fixed right of present or future enjoyment.” Rights are “vested”
in contradistinction to being “expectant or contingent.” (See
Balboa v. Farrales, 51 Phil. 498)

Under the Code of Commerce, a “sociedad anonima” could
extend its corporate life; under the Corporation Law, corporate
life cannot be extended beyond the original period; and said
period must not exceed 50 years. Now then, if a “sociedad
anonima” organized in 1903 could extend its corporate existence
apparently without limit, could the Corporation Law passed
in 1906 limit its life to 50 years? In the Benguet Case, the
Court held that the answer was in the affirmative, for in 1903,
the “sociedad” did not have any vested right to have a life
longer than 50 years. The Court said that the prolongation of
corporate existence in 1906 was merely a possibility in futuro,
a contingency that did not fulfill the requirement of a vested
right entitled to constitutional protection.
In said case, it was also held that there can be no vested
interest in any rule of law entitling a person to insist that it
shall remain unchanged for his benefit.
(4) Example of the Non-Impairment of a Vested Right

In Manalansan v. Manalang, et al. (L-13646, July 26,
1960), it was held that Art. 1607 (requiring a judicial order
before the registration of the consolidation of ownership in
the vendee a retro for failure to redeem) cannot be applied to
a sale con pacto de retro executed in 1949, for to do so would
impair and diminish the rights that had already vested in
the vendee a retro under the old Code.

Art. 2253. The Civil Code of 1889 and other previous
laws shall govern rights originating, under said laws, from
acts done or events which took place under their regime,
even though this Code may regulate them in a different
manner, or may not recognize them. But if a right should be
declared for the first time in this Code, it shall be effective at

impair any vested or acquired right, of the same origin.

COMMENT:
(1) Comment of the Code Commission (Acts Contrary
to
Law)

“It is evident that no one can validly claim any vested
or acquired right if the same is founded upon his having
violated the law or invaded the rights of others. The principle
is universally accepted.” (Report of the Code Commission, p.

167)

(2) Against whom Prohibition is Directed

COMMENT:

The prohibition referred to in this Article is directed
against the OFFENDER, not the offended party. Hence, if
a husband committed concubinage prior to the effectivity of
the new Civil Code, and an absolute divorce action was filed
also before the new Civil Code, the case can continue now.
The offended party in a sense acquired a vested right to still
prosecute; the offender cannot, however, claim any vested

(1) Comment of the Code Commission (When the Old and

the New Codes Apply)

“The first sentence is an application of the fundamental
principle of respect for vested or acquired rights. But the
second sentence gives a retroactive effect to newly created
rights, provided they do not prejudice or impair any vested or
acquired right. The retroactive character of the new right is
the result of the exercise of the sovereign power of legislation,
when the law-making body is persuaded that the new right
is called for by considerations of justice and public policy.
But such new right must not encroach upon a vested right.”

right. (Raymundo v. Penas, 96 Phil. 311)

Art. 2255. The former laws shall regulate acts and
contracts with a condition or period, which were executed
or entered into before the effectivity of this Code, even
though the condition or period may still be pending at the
time this body of laws goes into effect.

(2) Recovery of Damages

Damages recoverable under Art. 21 can be given effect
even if the acts complained of were done before the effective
date of the new Code. (Gattis v. Si Huy, [CA.] 53 O.G. 866)

COMMENT:
Acts and Contracts With a Condition or Period
(a)

The reason for the Article is that the legal relation was
already created, although the condition or period is still
pending. (Report of the Code Commission, p. 167)
(b) Article 1687 providing for an extension in lease cannot
apply to lease contracts entered into prior to the new
Civil Code. (Acasio v. Corporation de los P.P. Dominicos
de Filipinos, 100 Phil. 523)

(3) Successions! Rights

New successions] rights cannot be granted if the deceased
died under the old Code, for ownership over the estate is
transferred from the moment of death. Hence, a vested right
was acquired upon such death under the old law. (Uson v.
Del Rosario, et al., 92 Phil. 530)

Art. 2254. No vested or acquired right can arise from
acts or omissions which are against the law or which infringe
upon the rights of others.

the condition was still pending at the time the new law

Art. 2256. Acts and contracts under the regime of the
old laws, if they are valid in accordance therewith, shall

COMMENT:
(1) Comment of the Code Commission (Re: Civil Sanctions
and Penalties)

“The article is just, for penalties and forfeitures with a
retroactive effect cannot be countenanced. The last paragraph
is just, for the reason that when continuous or repeated acts,
though begun before the new Civil Code, extend beyond the
termination of the old Code, the effect of the new body of
laws must necessarily apply to them.” (Report of the Code
Commission, p. 168)

Art. 2257. Provisions of this Code which attach a civil
sanction or penalty or a deprivation of rights to acts or
omissions which were not penalized by the former laws, are
not applicable to those who, when said laws were in force,
may have executed the acts or incurred in the omission
forbidden or condemned by this Code.

If the fault is also punished by the previous legislation,
the less severe sanction shall be applied.
If a continuous or repeated act or omission was
commenced before the beginning of the effectivity of this
Code, and the same subsists or is maintained or repeated
656

FACTS: In 1937, Cesar V. Ybanez, riding in a car, was
killed in a collision with a train owned by the North Negros
Sugar Company. The mishap having been caused by the
train’s negligence, the Sugar Company was held liable for
actual damages such as lost earnings, death indemnity, and
funeral expenses, and said damages were paid to a brother,
Pedro Ybanez. The brother, however, also asked for MORAL
DAMAGES, because of the mental anguish suffered by him
ISSUE: Should said moral damages be granted the

brother?

HELD: The accident having taken place in 1937, the old
Civil Code (Art. 1902) should be applied. Under said Article,
apparently anyone who suffered, whether he was a relative or
not, and even if the damage was only moral, could recover (in
view of the generality of the Article). In view of the absence of
a precedent in Spanish and Filipino jurisprudence, reference
was made to French decisions of persuasive authority (since
Art. 1383 of the French Civil Code was more or less identical
657

CIVIL CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES

Art 2258

•

with Art. 1902 of the old Civil Code). Under French decisions,
under Article 1383 of the French Civil Code, moral damages
were awarded to brothers and sisters, among others. If we
were to stop here, the brother would be entitled to recover
moral damages for the death of the victim. BUT under Art.
2257 of the new Civil Code, if an act is punished both under
the old and the new legislation, the “less severe sanction shall
be applied.”
Now then under Art. 2206 of the new Civil Code, those
who can recover moral damages for DEATH caused by a
crime or quasi-delict includes only the spouse, ascendants
(whether legitimate of illegitimate) and descendants (whether
legitimate or illegitimate); note that brothers and sisters are
NOT INCLUDED. Inasmuch as the new Civil Code is less
severe on this point, it should be applied; hence, the brother
cannot obtain the moral damages sought.

COMMENT:
Capacity of a Married Woman

Note that the new Family Code governs said capacity.
This is true even if the marriage was celebrated under the
old laws.

(3) Moral and Exemplary Damages

In the case of Jalandoni v. Martin Guanzon, et al. (54
O.G. 2907), the Court said that the moral and exemplary
(corrective) damages allowed under the new Civil Code cannot
be given for acts that occurred prior to the new Civil Code.
The reason is because of their deterrent, punitive character.

Art. 2258. Actions and rights which came into being but
were not exercised before the effectivity of this Code, shall
remain in full force in conformity with the old legislation;
but their exercise, duration and the procedure to enforce
them shall be regulated by this Code and by the Rules
of Court. If the exercise of the right or of the action was
commenced under the old laws, but is pending on the date
this Code takes effect, and the procedure was different
from that established in this new body of laws, the parties
concerned may choose which method or course to pursue.

REPEALING CLAUSE
Art 2270. The following laws and regulations are hereby
repealed:
(1) Those parts and provisions of the Civil Code of
1889 which are in force on the date when this new Civil
Code becomes effective;
(2) The provisions of the Code of Commerce governing
sales, partnership, agency, loan, deposits and guaranty;

(3) The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure on
prescription as far as inconsistent with this Code; and
(4) All laws, Acts, parts of Acts, rules of court,
executive orders, and administrative regulations which are
inconsistent with this Code.

course there should be a special law repealing such provision.
(See Mangayco, et al. v. Lasud, et al., L-19252, May 29, 1964)
(3) Complete Repeal of the Civil Code of 1889

Note that the Spanish Civil Code of 1889 is completely
repealed with respect to the provision of said Code still in
force on the effective date of this new Code. Those provisions
of said Spanish Civil Code no longer in force were either
repealed previously or had never been enforced here.
(4) The Family Code

Executive Order 209, as amended by EO 227, is otherwise
known as “The Family Code of the Philippines.” Said Code
has practically amended about 80% of the Civil Code’s
provisions on family relations (marriage, legal separation,
rights and obligations between husband and wife, the family,
paternity and filiation, adoption, support, parental authority,
emancipation and age of majority). Added were Titles XI and
XII, respectively, dealing with Summary Judicial Proceedings
in the Family Law and Final Provisions.

The Spanish Civil Code of 1889 was repealed on August
30, 1950, the date of eflfectivity of the new Civil Code. (See

Garcia & Comporendondo, L-11483, Feb. 14, 1958)

The new Civil Code has not “superseded the Administrative
Code of Mindanao and Sulu, or the Public Land Law, since
these statutes are, in this regard, SPECIAL ACTS, and implied
repeals are not favored.” Therefore, a deed of sale of real
