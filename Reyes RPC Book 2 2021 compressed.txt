Aside from the latest relevant rulings of the Supreme Court, this
edition also replaces with Supreme Court decisions several Court of

of Appeals should first review death penalty cases before elevating
the same to the Supreme Court for its final disposition.

PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH EDITION
Since the publication of the sixth edition of this book in May,
1965, new cases involving criminal law have been decided by the
Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals. In order to make this book

PREFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION
The pubUcation of this edition is brought about by the increasing
demand for copies of this book which, although intended primarily
for the law students and bar candidates, has been well received by
the members of the Bench and the Bar. Lawyers have found this
book handy in the study and preparation of their criminal cases. The
Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals have cited this book in some
of their decisions.

PREFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION
In the preparation of this edition, new annotations and com¬
mentaries are added to make this book up-to-date.
Certain annotations and commentaries are made more detailed,
because it has been observed that the law students who do not have
the time to read the cases cited have found it difficult to illustrate
the application of the principle involved.
It is the hope of the author that the improvements made in this
book will greatly facilitate the study of Criminal Law.

L.B.R.
Manila, May 1, 1963

PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION
The fourth edition of this book is published upon request of the

numerous law students and bar candidates from different law schools.

It is the pride and satisfaction of the author that the previous edi¬
tions of this book proved very helpful to the law students and the bar
candidates.
In preparing this fourth edition, the author endeavored to im¬
prove the arrangement of, and to make up-to-date, the annotations
and commentaries under each article of the R.P.C. The bar questions,
which were reproduced and included in the first three editions, are
eliminated in this edition, because the bar questions and the answers
thereto will be included in the second edition of the Criminal Law
Reviewer by the same author.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION
Encouraged by the favorable comments from the candidates for,
and members of the Bar, the author prepared the third edition of this
book. Certain improvements are introduced to make the discussion
of the provisions and principles of criminal law more comprehensive
and exhaustive.
This third edition is intended to meet the difficult questions
asked in the Bar Examinations nowadays.
Leading cases involving criminal law, decided by the Supreme
Court and the Court of Appeals, are reproduced with pertinent facts
and some cases are compared and commented upon to explain the
difference of some of the rulings of the appellate courts on certain
provisions of the R.P.C.

L.B.R.
Manila, May 1958

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
In the preparation of this book, the author has endeavored to fill
the needs of the law students and bar candidates who have always
desired a brief but comprehensive textbook for the study of Criminal

Law.

When all the copies of the first edition of this book had been sold
out, many students from different law schools came to the author
and requested him to publish more copies for their use. Hence, the
publication of this second edition.
As the first edition was hurriedly prepared, several errors were
committed through the oversight of the author and the printer. In
this second edition, those errors are corrected and the arrangement
of the topics and of the discussions under each topic are improved to
make clear the points emphasized.
This book is aimed at the mastery of the codal provisions which
is essential. The cases decided by the Supreme Court and the Court
of Appeals are discussed in relation to the meaning and purpose of
the codal provisions are explained in the light of the decisions of the
appellate courts.
The author is confident that this book will be of great help to
the law students and bar candidates.

L.B.R.
Manila, June 1956

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
This book is intended primarily for the law students and bar
candidates. Emphasis is placed on the elements of the legal provisions,
because knowledge of such elements will enable one to know easily
the meaning of a legal provision and the extent of its application. No
one can hope to have a good knowledge of criminal law without first
mastering the codal provisions. For the proper understanding and
easy recollection of the codal provisions, the author has endeavored
to break the provisions of every article into elements, stating them
in outline form. In this book, the rulings in important and leading
cases are stated in the discussion of each and every element of the
legal provisions, indicating thereby the connection of the ruling of a
given case with the particular provision of the Code.

Definitions of terms and other important words and phrases
used in the different articles are incorporated in the commentaries
to enable the readers to have a full grasp of the meaning of the law.
Distinctions of one article from another, whenever necessary to
avoid confusion, are stated as part of the commentaries.
The opinions of the late Justice Mariano A. Albert and Judge
Guillermo B. Guevarra are quoted in connection with certain articles
of the Code, because in the discussion of those articles their views
are very enlightening.

As a textbook for law students, this book should be amplified
by assigning to the students and reading of the original cases cited
therein.

Bar questions from 1913 to 1953 are reproduced and included
herein as one of the appendices to acquaint the bar candidates with
the nature and extent of the questions asked in the past. Most of the
questions do not call for controversial answers. The answers given
with respect to those questions can be adopted.
As regards the questions calling for controversial answers, notes
are placed after the answers and the two sides of the answers are
presented.

This book is published in the hope that this humble work will
be of great help to the law students and bar candidates.

Treason, defined.

Chapter One

CRIMES AGAINST NATIONAL SECURITY

— Treason and espionage
Article 114. Treason.' — Any Filipino citizen who levies
war against the Philippines or adheres to her enemies, giving
Section One.

them aid or comfort within the Philippines or elsewhere, shall
be punished by reclusion perpetua to death3 and shall pay a
fine not to exceed Four million pesos (P4,000,000).
No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the
testimony of two (2) witnesses at least to the same overt act
or on confession of the accused in open court.

Likewise, an alien, residing in the Philippines, who
commits acts of treason as defined in paragraph 1 of this
Article shall be punished by reclusion temporal to death9 and
shall pay a fine not to exceed Four million pesos (P4,000,000).
(As amended by Sec. 2, RA. No. 7659 and RA. No. 10951)

Elements of treason:
1.

That the offender is a Filipino citizen or an alien residing in the
Philippines;

2.

That there is a war in which the Philippines is involved;

3.

That the offender either

—

a.

levies war against the Government, or

b.

adheres to the enemies, giving them aid or comfort.

Treason is a breach of allegiance to a government, committed
by a person who owes allegiance to it. (63 C.J. 814)
Nature of the crime.

Treason, in its general sense, is the violation by a subject of his
allegiance to his sovereign or to the supreme authority of the State.
(U.S. v. Abad, 1 Phil. 437)
The offender in treason is either a Filipino citizen or a resident alien.

Under the first paragraph of Article 114, the offender in treason
must be a Filipino citizen, as he should not be a foreigner. Before
Article 114 was amended by E.O. No. 44, it was not possible under the
R.P.C. to punish for treason, resident aliens who aided the enemies
Now, as amended, the R.P.C. punishes a resident alien who commits
treason. (People v. Marcaida, 79 Phil. 283)
How to prove that the offender is a Filipino citizen.

When the accused is allegedly a Filipino, his being a Filipino
citizen may be proved by his prison record which sets out his personal
circumstances properly identified as having been filled out with data
supplied by the accused himself. (People v. Martin, 86Ph.il. 204; People
v. Morales, 91 Phil. 445)

The citizenship of the accused may also be proved by the
testimony of witnesses who know him to have been born in the
Philippines of Filipino parents. (People v. Flavier, 89 Phil. 15)
Law on treason Is of Anglo-American origin.

The Philippines Law on treason is of Anglo-American origin,
and so [the Court] ha[s] to look for guidance from American sources
on its meaning and scope. (People v. Adriano, 78 Phil. 566)
Allegiance defined.

'The Indeterminate Sentence Law is not applicable.
’See Appendix "A," Scale of Penalties.
'Ibid.
2

The first element of treason is that the offender owes allegiance
to the Government of the Philippines.
3

Art. 114

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

By the term "allegiance” is meant the obligation of fidelity and
obedience which the individuals owe to the government under which
they live or to their sovereign, in return for the protection they receive.
(52 Am. Jur. 797)
Allegiance is either permanent or temporary.

While it is true that the permanent allegiance is owed by an
alien to his own country, he, at the same time, also owes a temporary
allegiance to the country where he resides.
Allegiance as an element of treason seems to be either permanent
or temporary. Permanent allegiance consists in the obligation
of fidelity and obedience which a citizen or subject owes to his
government or sovereign. Temporary allegiance is the obligation of
fidelity and obedience which a resident alien owes to our government.
(Laurel v. Misa, 77 Phil. 856) This justifies E.O. No. 44, amending
Article 114.
Treason cannot be committed In time of peace.

The second element of treason is that there is a war in which
the Philippines is involved.

Treason is a war crime. It is not an all-time offense. It cannot be
committed in time of peace. While there is peace, there are no traitors.
Treason may be incubated when peace reigns. Treasonable acts may
actually be perpetrated during peace, but there are no traitors until
war has started.
As treason is basically a war crime, it is punished by the state
as a measure of self-defense and self-preservation. The law of treason
is an emergency measure. It remains dormant until the emergency
arises. But as soon as war starts, it is relentlessly put into effect.
(Concurring Opinion of Justice Perfecto, Laurel v. Misa, 77 Phil. 865)
Two ways or modes of committing treason:
1.

By levying war against the Government;

2.

By adhering to the enemies of the Philippines, giving them
aid or comfort.

4

TITLE ONE
Art. 114
Crimes Against National Security and The Law of Nations
Meaning of “levies war.”

Levying war requires the concurrence of two things: (1) that
there be an actual assembling of men; and (2) for the purpose of
executing a treasonable design by force. (Ex parte Bollman and Ex
parte Swartwout, 1 U.S. Sup. Ct. Rep. [4 Cranch 75], p. 571)
There must be an actual assembling of men.

Upon searching the house of the accused, the Constabulary
officers found a captain’s commission under seal. It was held that the
mere acceptance of the commission from the secretary of war of the
Katipunan Society by the accused, nothing else having been done,
was not an overt act of treason within the meaning of the law. (U.S.
v. De los Reyes, 3 Phil. 349)
The actual enlistment of men to serve against the government
does not amount to levying war, because there is no actual assembling
of men.

But if a body of men be actually assembled for the purpose of
effecting by force a treasonable design, all those who perform any part,
however minute, or however remote from the scene of action, and who
are actually leagued in the general conspiracy, are to be considered
as traitors. (Ex parte Bollman and Ex parte Swartwout, supra)
In treason by levying war, it Is not necessary that there be a formal
declaration of the existence of a state of war.

It is not necessary that there be any formal declaration of the
existence of a state of war to justify the conclusion that those engaged
in such attempt are levying war and therefore guilty of treason. Actual
hostilities may determine the date of the commencement of war.
(Justice Johnson, dissenting; U.S. v. Lagnason, 3 Phil. 495)
The war must be directed against the government
The levying of war must be with the intent to overthrow the
government as such, not merely to resist a particular statute or to
repel a particular officer. (3 Wharton’s Criminal Law, 12th Ed.)

An organized attempt on the part of persons joined together
in a band to overthrow and destroy the established government is a
levying of war against the government and constitutes treason.
5

Art. 114

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

It matters not how vain and futile the attempt was and how
impossible the accomplishment. It is not necessary that those
attempting to overthrow the government by force of arms should have
the apparent power to succeed in their design in whole or in part
(U.S. v. Lagnason, 3 Phil. 473)
Those who, during war, rise publicly to inflict an act of hate or
revenge upon the persons of public officers do not commit treason by
levying war because the public uprising is not directed against the
government.
Is it necessary that the purpose of levying war is to deliver the
country in whole or in part to the enemy?

TITLEONE

Crimea Against National Security and The Law of Nations

Art. 114

emotionally favors the enemy and harbors sympathies or convictions
disloyal to his country’s policy or interest. (Cramer v. U.S., 65 Sup.
Ct. 918, April 23, 1945)
“Aid or comfort,” defined.

The phrase “aid or comfort” means an act which strengthens
or tends to strengthen the enemy in the conduct of war against the
traitor’s country and an act which weakens or tends to weaken the
power of the traitor’s country to resist or to attack the enemy. (Cramer
v. U.S., supra)
Adherence alone, without giving the enemy aid or comfort, does
not constitute treason.

Yes. Levying war as an act of treason must be for the purpose
of executing a treasonable design by force. Although in stating the
acts constituting treason, Article 114 uses the phrases (1)“levies war
against” the Government of the Philippines or (2) “adheres to” the
enemies of the Philippines, “giving them aid or comfort,” it does not
mean that adhering to the enemies is required only in the second mode
of committing treason. Since levying war against the Government is
also punished as rebellion, there must be a difference between treason
committed by levying war and rebellion.

The fact that the accused had friendly relations with the
Japanese during the war, openly revealing himself sympathetic to
the cause of the enemy and also believing in the invincibility of the
Japanese Armed Forces does not constitute in itself treasonable
act as defined by law. The crime of treason consists two elements:
(1) adherence to the enemy; and (2) rendering him aid and comfort.
(People v. Tan, P.C., 42 O.G. 1263)

The levying of war must be in collaboration with a foreign enemy.

Emotional or intellectual attachment or sympathy to the enemy,
without giving the enemy aid or comfort, is not treason.

If the levying of war is merely a civil uprising, without any
intention of helping an external enemy, the crime is not treason. The
offenders may be held liable for rebellion under Article 135 in relation
to Article 134 of this Code.
Requirements of the second way or mode of committing treason.

In the second way or mode of committing treason, (1) adherence
and (2) giving aid or comfort to the enemy must concur together.
Adherence alone, without giving aid or comfort to the enemy, is not
sufficient to constitute treason. Conversely, aid or comfort alone,
without adherence, is not treason.

Adherence to the enemy, defined.
The phrase “adherence to the enemy” means intent to betray.
There is “adherence to the enemy” when a citizen intellectually or
6

When there is no adherence to the enemy, the act which may do aid
or comfort to the enemy does not amount to treason.

The sale to the enemy of alum crystals and water pipes does
not per se constitute treason, because said articles or materials are
not exclusively for war purposes and their sale does not necessarily
carry an intention on the part of the vendor to adhere to the enemy.
(People v. Agoncillo, 80 Phil. 33)
While the sale to the enemy of alum crystals and water pipes
may do aid or comfort to the enemy, if there is no evidence of intent
to betray, the person making the sale is not guilty of treason.
Giving information to, or commandeering foodstuff for, the enemy
Is evidence of both adherence and aid or comfort

The defendant’s act of giving information to the enemy
constituted not only giving aid and comfort, but also adherence to

the enemy. (People v. Paar, 86 Phil. 864) The defendant’s act of
commandeering foodstuff for the Japanese soldiers is sufficient proof
of adherence to the enemy. (People v. Mangakas, 93 Phil. 1113)
Extent of aid or comfort.

The aid and comfort must be given to the enemy by some kind
of action. It must be a deed or physical activity, not merely a mental
operation. It must be an act that has passed from the realm of thought
into the realm of action.
The expression includes such acts as furnishing the enemy with
arms, troops, supplies, information, or means of transportation.

In a broad sense, the law of treason does not prescribe kinds
of social, business and political intercourse between the belligerent
occupants of the invaded country and its inhabitants. In the nature
of things, the occupation of a country by the enemy is bound to create
relations of all sorts between the invaders and the natives. What aid
and comfort constitute treason must depend upon their nature, degree
and purpose. To draw a line between treasonable and untreasonable
assistance is not always easy. The scope of adherence to the enemy
is comprehensive, its requirement indeterminate.
As a general rule, to be treasonous, the extent of the aid and
comfort given to the enemies must be to render assistance to them as
enemies and not merely as individuals and, in addition, be directly
in furtherance of the enemies’ hostile designs. To make a simple
distinction: To lend or give money to an enemy as a friend or out of
charity to the beneficiary so that he may buy personal necessities
is to assist him as an individual and is not technically traitorous.
On the other hand, to lend or give him money to enable him to buy
arms or ammunition to use in waging war against the giver’s country
enhances his strength and by the same count injures the interest
of the government of the giver. That is treason. (People v. Perez, 83

It is said that there is aid and comfort no

futile the attempt may be, as long as the act
committed tends to
strengthen the enemy. It is not the degree of success,

the aim for which the act was perpetrated, that

commission of treason.

Commandeering of women to satisfy the lust of the enemy is not

treason.

“Commandeering” of women to satisfy the lust of Japanese
officers or men or to enliven the entertainments held in their honor
was not treason even though the women and the entertainments
helped to make life more pleasant for the enemies and boost their
spirit; he was not guilty any more than the women themselves would
have been if they voluntarily and willingly had surrendered their
bodies or organized the entertainments. The acts herein charged
were not, by fair implication, calculated to strengthen the Japanese
Empire or its army or to cripple the defense and resistance of the
other side. Whatever favorable effect the defendant’s collaboration
with the Japanese might have in their prosecution of the war was
trivial, imperceptible and unintentional. (People v. Perez, supra)
Specific acts of aid or comfort constituting treason.

The following are specific acts of aid or comfort:
1.

Serving as informer and active member of the Japanese
Military Police, arresting guerilla suspects in an attempt to
suppress the underground movement. (People v. Fernando,
79 Phil. 719)

2.

Serving in the Japanese Army as agent or spy and

Being a Makapili constitutes an overt act of psychological comfort

Being a Makapili is in itself constitutive of an overt act. The
crime of treason was committed if he placed himself at the enemy’s

call to fight side by side with him when the opportune time came even
though an opportunity never presented itself. Such membership by
its very nature gave the enemy aid and comfort. The enemy derived
psychological comfort in the knowledge that he had on his side
nationals of the country with which he was at war. It furnished the
enemy aid in that his cause was advanced, his forces augmented, and
his courage was enhanced by the knowledge that he could count on
men such as the accused and his kind who were ready to strike at
their own people. The practical effect of it was no different from that
of enlisting in the invader’s army. (People v. Adriano, 78 Phil. 563;

Acceptance of public office and discharge of official duties under
the enemy do not constitute per se the felony of treason.

The mere acceptance of a public office and the discharge of
the functions and duties connected therewith, during the Japanese
military occupation in the Philippines, do not constitute per se the
felony of treason. But admitting that such acts were really of aid and
comfort to the enemy, they cannot be punishable in this particular
case, because there is no satisfactory proof of the adherence of the
accused to the cause of the enemy. (People v. Alunan, P.C., 43 O.G.

1288)

When there is adherence to the enemy.

But when the positions to which the accused was appointed were
not only highly responsible positions but also policy-determining,
because they defined the norm of conduct that all the offices and
officials under the departments he headed had to adopt and enforce,
and helped in the propagation of the creed of the invader, and the
acts and utterances of the accused while holding such position were
an earnest implement to such policy, the acceptance of public office
and discharge of official duties constitute treason. (People
v. Sison,
P.C., 42 O.G. 748)

10

Membership in the police force during occupation Is not treason;
but active participation with the enemies in the apprehension of
guerrillas and infliction of ill-treatments make such member liable
for treason.

Appellant’s membership in the police force of Manaoag does not
in itself constitute treason; but his having accompanied the Japanese
soldiers to the places of abode of guerrilla leaders and the several
ill-treatments which he personally inflicted upon them because of
their refusal to disclose their connection with the guerrilla forces,
constitute treason. (People v. Dizon, 84 Phil. 48; People v. Galo, 84
Phil. 52; People v. Badili, 84 Phil. 71)
Guerilla warfare may be unlawful, but it should not be suppressed.

The argument is made that the accused was, at the most, merely
obeying superior orders in the suppression of guerrilla activities,
which, in the opinion of his counsel, are outlawed by the rules of
war. But the evidence is clear that he identified himself with the
enemy’s cause by acting as spy and causing the arrest of even his
close relatives to prevent them from taking part in the resistance
movement, and while guerrilla warfare may be unlawful from the
standpoint of the conqueror, it cannot be so regarded by those who,
by natural right, are trying to drive him out of their invaded territory.

The aid or comfort given to the enemies must be after the

Is there a complex crime of treason with murder, physical injuries,

In the case of People v. Prieto, 80 Phil. 138, where the accused,
besides being a Japanese spy, took part in the execution of some of
the guerrilla suspects and in the infliction of physical injuries on the
others, the Supreme Court held that murder and physical injuries
were inherent in the crime of treason characterized by the giving of
aid and comfort to the enemy.
When killings and other common crimes are charged as overt acts
of treason, they cannot be regarded: (1) as separate crimes; or
(2) as complexed with treason.

In treason, the giving of aid and comfort can be accomplished
only by some kind of action a deed or physical activity. This deed
or physical activity may be and often is in itself a criminal offense
under another penal statute or provision.

Thus, where the accused rendered service to the Japanese
army as a secret agent, informer and spy and, in the performance
of such service, he participated in the Japanese expeditions against
guerrillas and committed mass murders, arson and robberies (People
v. Villanueva, 104 Phil. 450), and those deeds or physical activities
(committing mass murders, arson and robberies) were charged an
element of treason (giving the enemy aid or comfort), they become
identified with the crime of treason and cannot be the subject of a
separate punishment or used in conjunction with treason to increase
the penalty as provided in Article 48. (People v. Prieto, 80 Phil. 138;
People v. Vilo, 82 Phil. 524; People v. Navea, 87 Phil. 1)

When the raping mentioned in the information is therein alleged
not as a specific offense but as mere element of the crime of treason
(People v. Adlawan, 83 Phil. 194) and the illegal detention is another
overt act of treason (People v. Butawan, 83 Phil. 440), they are merged
in the crime of treason.
When the accused is charged with treason and his act of
arresting and detaining guerrillas is proved, not only as the element
of adherence to the enemy but also as the element of giving aid
or comfort, the accused cannot be considered guilty only of illegal
detention under Article 267 of the R.P.C. (People v. Tuason, 84 Phil.

Treason Is a continuous offense. .

Treason is of such a nature that it may be committed by one
single act, by a series of acts, or by several series thereof, not only
in a single time, but in different tunes, it being a continuous crime.
(People v. Victoria, 78 Phil. 129)
All overt acts the accused has done constitute but a single
offense. (Guinto v. Veluz, 77 Phil. 801) Proof of one count is sufficient
for conviction. (People v. San Juan, 89 Phil. 359)
No person shall be convicted of treason unless
on the testimony of two witnesses at least to the
same overt act or on confession of the accused in
open court. (Art. 114, par. 2)
Treason cannot be proved by circumstantial evidence or by the
extrajudicial confession of the accused.

The R.P.C. as well as the Rules of Court do not authorize the
conviction of a person accused of treason if the evidence against him
is circumstantial, however strong or convincing it may be, or is only
an extrajudicial confession.

TITLE ONE
Art. 114
Crimes Against National Security and The Law of Nations
The two-witness rule must be adhered to as to each and every
one of all the external manifestations of the overt act in issue. (People
v. Abad, 78 Phil. 766)

The treasonous overt act of doing guard duty in the Japanese
garrison on one specific date cannot be identified with the doing of
guard duty in the same garrison on a different date. Both overt acts,
although of the same nature and character, are two distinct acts.
Either one, to serve as a ground for conviction, must be proved by
two witnesses. That one witness should testify as to one, and another
as to the other, was held not to be enough. (People u. Agpangan, 79
Phil. 334)

Where two witnesses testified that the accused took part in the
alleged “zoning” for the purpose of picking out the guerrillas, “but
their testimony does not disclose that they were referring to the same
act, place and moment of time, it cannot be said that one corroborated
the other.” (People v. Flores, et al., 85 Phil. 403)

But it is not required that their testimony be identical. Thus, one
witness might hear a gun report, see a smoking gun in the hand of
the accused and see the victim fall. Another witness, who was deaf,
might see the accused raise and point the gun and see a puff of smoke
from it. The testimony of both would certainly be to the same overt
act. (Hauft v. United States, 67 S. Ct. 874)

Ways of proving treason.

A person may be convicted of treason on any of the following
evidence only:
1.

2.

Testimony of two witnesses, at least, to the same overt act;
or

Confession of the accused in open court. (Art. 114, par. 2,

R.P.C.)

The two*witness rule is “severely restrictive.”

The authors of the two-witness provision in the American
Constitution, from which our treason law was taken, purposely
made it “severely restrictive” and conviction for treason difficult. The
provision requires that each of the witnesses must testify to the whole
overt act; or if it is separable, there must be two witnesses to each
part of the overt act. (People v. Escleto, 84 Phil. 121)
The defendant should be acquitted if only one of the two
witnesses is believed by the court.

The two-witness rule.

The testimony of two witnesses is required to prove the overt
act of giving aid or comfort. It is not necessary to prove adherence.

An overt act is defined as that physical activity, that deed that
constitutes the rendering of aid and comfort.

14

This provision is so exacting and so uncompromising in regard
to the amount of evidence that where two or more witnesses give
oaths to an overt act and only one of them is believed by the court or
jury, the defendant, it has been said and held, is entitled to discharge,
regardless of any moral conviction of the culprit’s guilt as gauged and
tested by the ordinary and natural methods, with which we are familiar,
15

of finding the truth. Natural inferences, however strong or conclusive,
flowing from the testimony of a most trustworthy witness or from other
sources are unavailing as a substitute for the needed corroboration in
the form of direct testimony of another eyewitness to the same overt
act. (People v. Adriano, 78 Phil. 563-567)

Illustration of a case where the two-witness rule is not complied with.
Witness A testified that he saw the defendant going to the house
of Magno Ibarra in search of the latter’s revolver. Witness B testified
that when Magno Ibarra went to the garrison, the defendant required
him (Ibarra) to produce his revolver. It was held that the search for
the revolver in the house of Ibarra is one overt act and the requiring
to produce the revolver in the garrison, another.
Although both acts may logically be presumed to have answered
the same purpose, that of confiscating Ibarra’s revolver, the singleness
of purpose is not enough to make one of two acts.

The theory that where the overt act is simple, continuous and
composite, made up of, or proved by several circumstances, it being
not necessary that there be two witnesses to each circumstance, is
not well taken. (People v. Abad, 78 Phil. 766)
It Is sufficient that the witnesses are uniform in their testimony on
the overt act; it is not necessary that there be corroboration between
them on the point they testified.

While witness A.S. testified that the defendant, with a Japanese
interpreter, arrived at their house and inquired if his brother B.S.
was at home and said that the latter was wanted at the military
police headquarters for questioning, witness E.S. did not corroborate
witness A.S. in this respect. Neither did witness A.S. corroborate E.S.
as regards the latter’s testimony that B.S. was takings bath and that
B.S. said that the defendant and his companion should wait. But said
witnesses were uniform in their testimony on the overt act that B.S.
was arrested and the defendant actually aided in his arrest. The twowitness rule was complied with. (People v. Concepcion, 84 Phil. 789)
The two-witness rule is not affected by the discrepancies in
minor details of the testimony.

The fact that the said witnesses were not uniform on the points
whether x x x there were Japanese soldiers in the raiding party, or
16

r

whether x x x the persons arrested and confined included not only
the males but some women and children, is not sufficient to entirely
discredit their testimony, as the deficiency refers merely to minor
details. Neither may the negative testimony ofE.E., an alleged victim
of the raid, to the effect that he did not see the appellant among the
raiders prevail over the positive testimony of M.F. and T.V. who,
moreover, were not shown to have had any improper motive in
testifying against the appellant. (People v. Lansanas, 82 Phil. 193)
Reason for requiring the two witnesses to testify to the same overt
act.

The special nature of the crime of treason requires that the
accused be afforded a special protection not required in other cases
so as to avoid a miscarriage of justice. The extreme seriousness of the
crime, for which death is one of the penalties provided by law, and
the fact that the crime is committed on abnormal times, when small
differences may in mortal enmity wipe out all scruples in sacrificing
the truth, require that, at least, two witnesses must testify as to overt
acts of treason, if the same should be accepted by the tribunals as
legal basis to condemn a person as a traitor. ( Concurring Opinion of
Justice Perfecto, People v. Marcaida, 79 Phil. 295)

Adherence may be proved:
1.

by one witness;

2.

from the nature of the act itself; or

from the circumstances surrounding the act. (Cramer v.
U.S., supra., cited in People v. Adriano, 78 Phil. 563; People
v. Canibas, 85 Phil. 469)
Adherence to the enemy may be inferred from his act of arresting

3.

persons suspected of being guerrillas, his being armed, and his being
in company with armed Japanese soldiers. (People v. Icaro, 89 Phil.
12; People v. Bernardino, 93 Phil. 940)
Reason why adherence to the enemy need not be proved by two
witnesses.

It seems obvious that adherence to the enemy, in the sense of a
disloyal state of mind, cannot be, and is not required to be, proved by
17

Art. 114

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

deposition of two witnesses, because what is designed in the mind of
an accused never is susceptible of proof by direct testimony.

Confession must be made in open court
The confession means a confession of guilt. It is not only an
admission of facts made by the accused in giving his testimony after
a plea of not guilty, from which admissions of his guilt can be inferred.
Thus, if the accused testified after he had pleaded not guilty that he
had been carried off by force by the insurgent soldiers; that he was
forced to join them; that they made him a lieutenant and gave him a
revolver; and that he stayed with them two weeks, although it was
against his will; there was only an admission, but not a confession
of guilt. (U.S. v. Magtibay, 2 Phil. 705) It means pleading guilty in
open court; that is, before the judge while actually hearing the case.

Extrajudicial confession or confession made before the
investigators is not sufficient to convict a person of treason.

4.

Cruelty by subjecting guerrilla suspects to barbarous forms
of torture before putting them to death; and ignominy,
by stripping the wife of her clothes and then abusing her
in the presence of her husband, a guerrilla suspect, are
aggravating circumstances in treason. (People v. Adlawan,
83 Phil. 195)

Rapes, wanton robbery for personal gain, and brutality
with which the killing or physical injuries are carried out
are regarded as ignominy and cruelty under paragraphs
17 and 21 of Art[icle] 14 of the Code. (People v. Racaza, 82
Phil. 623; People v. Prieto, 80 Phil. 138)
But evident premeditation is not aggravating in treason,
because in treason, adherence and the giving of aid and
comfort to the enemy is usually a long continued process
requiring reflective and persistent determination and
planning. (People v. Racaza, supra)
Superior strength and treachery are circumstances inherent
in treason. Treachery is merged in superior strength.
They are, therefore, not aggravating in treason. (People v.

Article 64 is not strictly applied to treason.

Ordinarily, when there are no mitigating and aggravating
circumstances, the divisible penalty is imposed in the medium period.

(Art. 64)

The penalty for treason committed by Philippine citizens is
reclusion perpetua to death and a fine not to exceed P100.000. In
determining the proper penalty for treason, the amount or degree of
aid or comfort given the enemy as well as the gravity of the separate
and distinct acts of treason committed by the accused, rather than
the circumstances aggravating or mitigating the offense, determine
the period of the penalty to be imposed.
So, where there was no killing, not even torture of prisoners,
the imposition of imprisonment for 15 years, without reference to the
mitigating or aggravating circumstance, is proper. (People v. Cana,
87 Phil. 577)

Note: This ruling was made when the penalty for treason
committed by Filipino citizens was still reclusion temporal to death.
The gravity or seriousness of the acts of treason considered.

Where the accused took part in the killing and torture of persons
apprehended by the Japanese forces through him, the penalty of
reclusion perpetua or even death was imposed. (People v. Ortega, 92
Phil. 263)
Upon the accused whose acts in torturing and killing guerilla
suspects were characterized by vindictive cruelty and inhuman
savagery, death is the proper penalty. (People v. Ingalla, 83 Phil. 239)
Considering that many deaths resulted from the defendant’s
adherence to the enemy, the Supreme Court believes that the
appropriate penalty should be reclusion perpetua besides fine of
PIO,000. (People v. Castillo, 90 Phil. 298)

execution to some other person or persons. (Arts. 8 and 114)
Conspiracy or proposal as a felony.

Although the general rule is that conspiracy and proposal to
commit a felony is not punishable (Art. 8), under Article 115, the
mere conspiracy to commit treason is a felony. The mere proposal to
commit treason is also a felony. Both are punishable under Article 115.
The reason is that in treason the very existence of the state is
endangered.
Example of conspiracy to levy war against the Government

In 1903, a junta was organized and a conspiracy entered into by
a number of Filipinos in Hongkong, for the purpose of overthrowing
the Government by force of arms and establishing in its stead a
government to be known as the Republica Universal Democratica
Filipina-, that one Primo Ruiz was recognized as the titular head of

this conspiracy and Artemio Ricarte as chief of the military forces
to be organized in the Philippines in furtherance of the plans of
the conspirators; that Ricarte came to Manila from Hongkong; that
after his arrival in Manila, he held a number of meetings whereat
was perfected the conspiracy hatched in Hongkong; that defendant
Francisco Bautista took part in several of the meetings whereat the
plans of the conspirators were discussed and perfected; and that at
one of these meetings, Bautista, in answer to the question of Ricarte,
assured him that the necessary preparation had been made and that
he “held the people in readiness.”
Francisco Bautista, with another defendant, was convicted of
the crime of conspiracy to overthrow, put down, and destroy by force
the Government. ( U.S. v. Bautista, et al., 6 Phil. 581)

Art. 116

2.

That he has knowledge of any conspiracy (to commit treason)
against the Government.

3.

That he conceals or does not disclose and make known the same
as soon as possible to the governor or fiscal of the province or
the mayor or fiscal of the city in which he resides.

Misprision of treason cannot be committed by a resident alien.

The offender must be owing allegiance to the Government,
without being a foreigner.
The conspiracy is one to commit treason. The phrase “having
knowledge of any conspiracy against them” has reference to conspiracy
to commit treason defined in Article 115.

The two-wltness rule does not apply to conspiracy or proposal to
commit treason.

Article 116 does not apply when the crime of treason is already
committed by someone and the accused does not report its
commission to the proper authority.

The two-witness rule does not apply to this crime, because this is
a separate and distinct offense from that of treason. (U.S. v. Bautista,
et al., 6 Phil. 581)

This is so because Article 116 speaks of “knowledge of any
conspiracy against" the Government of the Philippines, not knowledge
of treason actually committed by another.

—

The offender in misprision of treason is punished as an accessory
to treason.

Every person owing
Art. 116. Misprision of treason.1
allegiance to (the United States or) the Government of the
Philippine Islands, without being a foreigner, and having
knowledge of any conspiracy against them, who conceals
or does not disclose and make known the same, as soon as
possible, to the governor or fiscal of the province, or the mayor
or fiscal of the city in which he resides, as the case may be,
shall be punished as an accessory to the crime of treason.'

The offender is, however, a principal in the crime of misprision of
treason.

Elements:

But the offender in Article 116 is a principal in the crime of
misprision of treason. Misprision of treason is a separate and distinct
offense from the crime of treason.

1.

That the offender must be owing allegiance to the Government,
and not a foreigner.
The Indeterminate Sentence Law is not applicable.
'See Appendix “A,” Table of Penalties, No. 10.

The offender under Article 116 is “punished as an accessory to
the crime of treason.” Note that Article 116 does not provide for a
penalty. Hence, the penalty for misprision of treason is two degrees
lower than that provided for treason.

Article 20 does not apply.
Since the offender in misprision of treason is a principal in that
crime, Article 20 does not apply, even if the offender is related to the
persons in conspiracy against the government. Article 20 applies
only to accessory.

Held: [The Court] do[es] not agree. Under the definition of piracy
in
P.D. No. 532 as well as grave coercion as penalized in Article 286 of the
R.P.C., this case falls squarely within the purview of piracy. While it may
be true that complainants were compelled to go elsewhere other than their
place of destination, such compulsion was obviously part of the act of seizing
their boat.

That a vessel is on the high seas or in Philippine waters;

That the offender is any person; and
That the offender shall attack or seize that vessel.

Elements of piracy (2nd mode):

Mutiny Is punished in Article 122.

1.

That a vessel is on the high seas or in Philippine waters;

2.

That the offender is not a member of its complement or a
passenger of the vessel; and

The last paragraph of this article provides that the same penalty
provided for piracy shall be inflicted in the case of mutiny on the high
seas or in Philippine waters.

3.

That the offender seizes the whole or part of the cargo of said
vessel, its equipment or personal belongings of its complement

Mutiny is usually committed by the other members of the

or passengers.

Definition of mutiny.

Meaning of “high seas.”

Mutiny is the unlawful resistance to a superior officer, or the
raising of commotions and disturbances on board a ship against the
authority of its commander. (Bouvier’s Law Dictionary, Vol. 2, p. 2283)

The Convention on the Law of the Sea defines “high seas” as
parts of the seas that are not included in the exclusive economic zone,
in the territorial seas, or in the internal waters of a state, or in the
archipelagic waters of an archipelagic state.

Piracy distinguished from mutiny.

In piracy, the persons who attack a vessel or seize its cargo are
strangers to said vessels; while in mutiny, they are members of the
crew or passengers.

Definition of piracy.

It is robbery or forcible depredation on the high seas, without
lawful authority and done with animo furandi and in the spirit and
intention of universal hostility. (People v. Lol-lo, et al., 43 Phil. 19)

While the intent to gain is essential in the crime of piracy, in
mutiny, the offenders may only intend to ignore the ship’s officers or
they may be prompted by a desire to commit plunder.

Seizure of a vessel.

People v. Catantan
(G.R. No. 118075, September 5, 1997)

Facts: Accused-appellant argues that in order that piracy may be
committed it is essential that there be an attack on or seizure of a vessel.
He claims that he and his companion did not attack or seize the fishing boat
of the Pilapil brothers by using force or intimidation but merely boarded
the boat, and it was only when they were already on board that they used
force to compel the Pilapils to take them to some other place. Appellant also
insists that he and Ursal had no intention of permanently taking possession
or depriving complainants of their boat. As a matter of fact, when they saw
another pumpboat they ordered the complainants to approach that boat so
they could leave the complainants behind in their boat. Accordingly, appellant
claims, he simply committed grave coercion and not piracy.

Lol-lo and Saaraw who later returned to their home in Sulu, Philippines.
There they were arrested and were charged in the Court of First Instance
of
Sulu with the crime of piracy.

Held. It cannot be contended with any degree of force that the Court
of First Instance of Sulu was without jurisdiction on the case. Piracy is
a
crime not against any particular state but against all mankind. It may be
punished in the competent tribunal of any country where the offender may
be found or into which he may be carried. Nor does it matter that the crimo
was committed within the jurisdictional three-mile limit of a foreign state.
The crime of piracy was accompanied by (1) rape, and (2) the
abandonment of persons without means of saving themselves.

“Upon those who commit any of the crimes referred to in the
preceding article.”
The word “crimes” in the quoted phrase in the opening sentence
of Article 123, refers to piracy and mutiny on the high seas.
Piracy or mutiny is, therefore, qualified if any of the following
circumstances is present:
(a) Whenever the offenders have seized the vessel by boarding
or firing upon the same;

Lol-lo who raped one of the women was sentenced to death, there
being the aggravating circumstance of cruelty, abuse of superior strength,
and ignominy, without any mitigating circumstance. (People v. Lol-lo and
Saraw, 43 Phil. 19)

Whenever the pirates have abandoned their victims without
means of saving themselves; or
Whenever the crime is accompanied by murder, homicide,
physical injuries, or rape.

Before Article 122 was amended by R.A. No. 7659, only piracy and
mutiny on high seas were covered by the R.P.C. The commission
of the acts described in Articles 122 and/or 123 In Philippine waters
was punished as piracy under P.D. No. 532.

Paragraph 2 of Article 123 specifically mentions “pirates”
thereby excluding mutineers from said paragraph. It would seem,
however, that it should be in paragraph 1 where the word “pirates”
should be specifically mentioned and not in paragraph 2, because in
paragraph 1, the mutineers, being already in the vessel, cannot seize
the vessel by boarding or firing upon the same.

Under P.D. No. 532, any attack upon or seizure of any vessel, or
the taking away of the whole or part thereof or its cargo, equipment, or
the personal belongings of its complement or passengers, irrespective
of the value thereof, by means of violence against or intimidation of
persons or force upon things, committed by any person, including a
passenger or member of the complement of said vessel, in Philippine
waters, shall be considered as piracy. The offenders shall be considered
as pirates and punished by the penalty of reclusion temporal in its
medium and maximum periods. If physical injuries or other crimes
are committed as a result or on the occasion thereof, the penalty of
reclusion perpetua shall be imposed. If rape, murder, or homicide is
committed as a result or on the occasion of piracy or when the offender
abandoned the victims without means of saving themselves, or when
the seizure is accomplished by firing upon or boarding a vessel, the
mandatory penalty of death shall be imposed.

(b)
(c)

It Is qualified piracy when the crime was accompanied by rape and
the offenders abandoned their victims without means of saving
themselves.

Facts: A boat, in which there were 11 men, women and children, arrived
between the islands of Buang and Bukid in the Dutch East Indies. There
the boat was surrounded by six vintas manned by 24 Moros all armed. The
Moros first asked for food, but once on the boat, took for themselves all of
the cargo, attacked some of the men, and brutally violated two of the women
by methods too horrible to be described. All of the persons on the boat, with

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Note: R.A. No. 9346 prohibited the imposition of the death
penalty. Thus, instead of the mandatory penalty of death under
P.D. No. 532, reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole shall
be imposed.
It is qualified piracy even if the cargo is off-loaded outside the
Philippines.
The attack on and seizure of “M/T Tabangao” (renamed “M/T
Galilee” by the pirates) and its cargo were committed in Philippine
waters, although the captive vessel was later brought by the pirates
to Singapore where its cargo was off-loaded, transferred, and
sold. Although Presidential Decree No. 532 requires that the attack
and seizure of the vessel and its cargo be committed in Philippine
waters, the disposition by the pirates of the vessel and its cargo is
still deemed part of the act of piracy, hence, the same need not be
committed in Philippine waters.

Moreover, piracy falls under Title One of Book Two of the Revised
Penal Code. As such, it is an exception to the rule on territoriality
in criminal law. The same principle applies even if Hiong, in the
instant case, were charged, not with a violation of qualified piracy
under the penal code but under a special law, P.D. No. 532 which
penalizes piracy in Philippine waters. (People v. Tulin, G.R. No.
111709, August 30, 2001)

Crimes Against National Security and The Law of

two laws. There is likewise no ambiguity and hence,
there is no need
to construe or interpret the law. All the presidential decree did was
to widen the coverage of the law, in keeping with the intent to protect
the citizenry as well as neighboring states from crimes against the
law of nations. As expressed in one of the “whereas” clauses of P.D.
No. 532, piracy is “among the highest forms of lawlessness condemned
by the penal statutes of all countries.” For this reason, piracy under
the Article 122, as amended, and piracy under P.D. No. 532 exist
harmoniously as separate laws. (People v. Tulin, supra)

Piracy under the R.P.C. and under P.D. No, 532, distinguished.
1)

40

Under the R.P.C., the vessel is in Philippine waters or high

seas. Under P.D. No. 532, the vessel is in Philippine waters.
2)

Under the R.P.C., the offender is any person who shall seize
the vessel or any person who shall seize cargo, equipment
or personal belongings, and who is not a crew member
or complement. Under P.D. No. 532, the offender is any
person.

3)

Piracy is committed the same way: the pirate attacks or
seizes the vessel, or takes away the whole or part thereof
or its cargo, equipment, or the personal belongings of its
complement or passengers.

4)

The penalty for simple piracy under the R.P.C. is reclusion
perpetua while the penalty under P.D. No. 532 is reclusion
temporal except when physical injuries or other crimes are
committed which is penalized by reclusion perpetua.
The penalty for Qualified Piracy under the R.P.C. and P.D.
No. 532 is the same: reclusion perpetua.

P.D. No. 532 covers any person while Article 122 as amended
covers only persons who are not passengers or members of its
complement

To summarize, Article 122 of the R.P.C., before its amendment,
provided that piracy must be committed on the high seas by any
person not a member of its complement nor a passenger thereof.
Upon its amendment by R.A. No. 7659, the coverage of the pertinent
provision was widened to include offenses committed “in Philippine
waters.” On the other hand, under P.D. No. 532 (issued in 1974), the
coverage of the law on piracy embraces any person including “a
passenger or member of the complement of said vessel in Philippine
waters.” Hence, passenger or not, a member of the complement or
not, any person is covered by the law.
R.A. No. 7659 neither superseded nor amended the provisions
on piracy under P.D. No. 532. There is no contradiction between the

Art. 123

Nations

5)

If a crew member or complement shall seize cargo, equipment
or personal belongings, the crime is theft or robbery.
Qualified piracy is a special complex crime punishable by reclusion
perpetua to death, regardless of the number of victims.

The number of persons killed on the occasion of piracy is not
material. P.D. No. 532 considers qualified piracy, i.e., rape, murder,
or homicide is committed as a result or on the occasion of piracy, as a
special complex crime punishable by death, regardless of the number
of victims. (People v. Siyoh, 141 SCRA 356)

each of the Islands of the Philippine Archipelago, irrespective of its
depth, breadth, length or dimension, and all other waters belonging

SECTION 1. It shall be unlawful for any person to compel a
change in the course or destination of an aircraft of Philippine registry,
or to seize or usurp the control thereof, while it is in flight. An aircraft,
is in flight from the moment all its external doors are closed following
embarkation until any of such doors is opened for disembarkation.

—

It shall likewise be unlawful for any person to compel an aircraft
of foreign registry to land in Philippine territory or to seize or usurp
the control thereof while it is within the said territory.

SEC. 2. Any person violating any provision of the foregoing
section shall be punished by an imprisonment of not less than twelve
years but not more than twenty years, or by a fine of not less than
twenty thousand pesos but not more than forty thousand pesos.
The penalty of imprisonment of fifteen years to death, or a fine
not less than twenty-five thousand pesos but not more than fifty
thousand pesos shall be imposed upon any person committing such
violation under any of the following circumstances:

A river is considered part of Philippine waters.

Appellant and his armed companions boarded the victims’ boat
while it was along the riverbank of Barangay San Roque, Villareal,
Samar, and seized 13 sacks of copra, the boat’s engine, propeller tube,
and tools, as well as the contents of Julita’s bag. Hence, the proper
imposable penalty should be death. However, due to R.A. No. 9346,
which prohibits the imposition of the death penalty, the penalty of
reclusion perpetua without eligibility for parole is correct since the
seizure of the vessel and its cargo was accomplished by boarding the
vessel. (People v. de la Perla, G.R. No. 219581, January 31, 2018)
Any person who aids or protects pirates or abets the commission

the commission of piracy, shall be considered as an accomplice of the
principal offenders and be punished in accordance with the Rules
prescribed by the R.P.C.

1.

Whenever he has fired upon the pilot, member of the crew
or passenger of the aircraft;

2.

Whenever he has exploded or attempted to explode any

Articles 124, 125 and 126 of the Code punish
any public officer or employee in those cases where an
individual is unlawfully deprived of liberty.
2. Section 6, Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides
that “the liberty of abode and of changing the same within the limits
prescribed by law shall not be impaired except upon lawful order of
the court. Neither shall the right to travel be impaired except in the
interest of national security, public safety, or public health, as may
be provided by law.”
Article 127 of the Code punishes any public officer
or employee who shall unlawfully expel a person from the
Philippines or compel a person to change his residence.
3. Section 2, Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides that
“the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers

penaIty prision mayor,’ if the
detention has
continued for more than fifteen days but not

than six

months; and

4. That of reclusion temporal,' if the

The commission of a crime, or violent insanity or any
other ailment requiring the compulsory confinement of the
patient in a hospital, shall be considered legal grounds for
the detention of any person.

Elements:

(1)

Arbitrary detention by detaining a person without legal
ground. (Art. 124)

(2)

Delay in the delivery of detained persons to the proper
judicial authorities. (Art. 125)

Delaying release. (Art. 126)

The penalties for the three classes of arbitrary detention are the
same, as provided in Article 124. Articles 125 and 126 do not provide
penalties for their violation. They make reference to the penalties
provided for in Article 124.

—

Art. 124. Arbitrary detention.
Any public officer or
employee who, without legal grounds, detains a person, shall
suffer:

1.

That the offender if a public officer or employee.

2.

That he detains a person.

3.

That the detention is without legal grounds. (U.S. v. Braganza,
et al., 10 Phil. 79; Milo u. Salonga, 152 SCRA 113; Astorga v.
People, G.R. No. 154130, October 1, 2003)

The offender in arbitrary detention is a public officer or employee.

The public officers liable for arbitrary detention must be vested
with authority to detain or order the detention of persons accused of
a crime, but when they detain a person they have no legal grounds
therefor.

Such public officers are the policemen and other agents of the
law, the judges or mayors. A barangay captain and a municipal
councilor are public officers.

1. The penalty of arresto mayor in its maximum period
to prtaion correctional in its minimum period,' if the detention
has not exceeded three days;

If the detention is perpetrated by other public officers, the crime
committed may be illegal detention, because they are acting in their
private capacity.

2. The penalty of prision correctional in its medium
and maximum periods,’ if the detention has continued more
than three but not more than fifteen days;

If the offender is a private individual, the act of detaining
another is illegal detention under Article 267 or Article 268.

The Fundamental

But private individuals who conspired with public officers in
detaining certain policemen are guilty of arbitrary detention. (People
v. Camerino, CA-G.R. No. 14207-R, December 14, 1956)
When is there a detention?

Detention is defined as the actual confinement of a person in
an enclosure, or in any manner detaining and depriving him of his
liberty. (People v. Gungon, G.R. No. 119574, March 19 1998, citing
People v. Domasian, G.R. No. 95322, March 1, 1993; People v. Flores,
G.R. No. 116488, May 31, 2001) A person is detained when he is
placed in confinement or there is a restraint on his person. (U.S. v.
Cabanag, 8 Phil. 64)
Even if the persons detained could move freely in and out of their
prison cell and could take their meals outside the prison, nevertheless,
if they were under the surveillance of the guards and they could
not escape for fear of being apprehended again, there would still be
arbitrary detention. (People v. Camerino, supra)

“Without legal grounds."
The detention of a person is without legal ground: (1)
when
he has not committed any crime or, at least,
there is no

reasonable

50

Art. 124

ground for suspicion that he has committed a crime; (2)
or
when he
is not suffering from violent insanity or any
other ailment requiring
compulsory confinement in a hospital.
Thus, in the following cases, the detention was
without legal
ground:
1.

A barrio lieutenant, seeing his servant quarreling with
his daughter, seized the servant and an hour later sent
him to the Justice of the Peace. The servant was kept in
detention from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 a.m. the next day when
he was released by the Justice of the Peace.
Held: The barrio lieutenant was guilty of arbitrary detention,
because he detained the offended party without any reason therefor,
such as the commission of the crime, and without having the authority
to do so. (U.S. v. Gellaga, 15 Phil. 120)
Note: Merely quarreling is not a crime,

2.

Restraint resulting from fear.

Where the accused-mayor refused to allow a DENR team to go
home despite their pleas, and the refusal was quickly followed by the
call for and arrival of almost a dozen “reinforcements,” all armed with
military-issued rifles, who proceeded to encircle the team, weapons
pointed at the complainants and the witnesses, and the team was
instead brought to a house where after dinner, some of the members
were allowed to go down from the house but not to leave the barangay,
and the rest just sat in the house until 2:00 a.m. when they were
finally allowed to leave, it was held that the restraint resulting
from fear is evident. It was not just the presence of the armed men,
but also the evident effect these gunmen had on the actions of the
team which proves that fear was indeed instilled in the minds of the
team members, to the extent that they felt compelled to stay in the
barangay. The intent to prevent the departure of the complainants
and witnesses against their will is clear. (Astorga v. People,
G.R. No.
154130, October 1, 2003)

Laws of the State

A Manila detective sergeant arrested Aquilino Taruc
because of the suspicion that he might be implicated in the
plot to assassinate the President and that he was related
to Luis Taruc, a Huk Supremo.

Held: Mere suspicion of his connection with any murderous
plot is no ground recognized by law for restraining the freedom of
any individual. Lawlessness from above can only lead to chaos and
anarchy. (Taruc v. Carlos, 78 Phil. 876)
3.

In overtaking another vehicle, complainant-driver was
not committing or had not actually committed a crime
in the presence of respondent-judge. Such being the
case, the warrantless arrest and subsequent detention of
complainant were illegal. (Cayao v. del Mundo, A.M. No.
MTJ 93-813, September 15, 1993)

Legal grounds for the detention of any person.
The following are legal grounds for the detention of any person:
(a)

The commission of a crime;

(b)

Violent insanity or any other ailment requiring the
compulsory confinement of the patient in a hospital. (Art.
124, par. 2)
51

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Art 124

Arrest without warrant is the usual cause of arbitrary detention.

A peace officer must have a warrant of arrest properly issued
by the court in order to justify an arrest. If there is no such warrant
of arrest, the arrest of a person by a public officer may constitute
arbitrary detention.

Arrest without warrant

—

When lawful.

A peace officer or a private person may, without a warrant,
arrest a person:
(a)

When, in his presence, the person to be arrested has
committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to
commit an offense;

(b)

When an offense has in fact just been committed, and he
has probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge
of facts and circumstances that the person to be arrested
has committed it; and

(c)

When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has
escaped from a penal establishment or place where he is
serving final judgment or temporarily confined while his
case is pending, or has escaped while being transferred

from one confinement to another. (Sec. 5, Rule 113, Revised
Rules of Criminal Procedure)

A warrantless arrest under the circumstances contemplated
under Section 5(a) has been denominated as one“in flagrante delicto,"
while that under Section 5(b) has been described as a “hot pursuit"
arrest (Malacat v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 123595, December 12,
1997) and Section 5(c) refers to escaping prisoners. (Ilagan v. Enrile,
139 SCRA 349)
“In his presence.”

The phrase “in his presence” in paragraph (a), construed - When
the officer sees the offense being committed, although at a distance,
or hears the disturbance created thereby and proceeds at once to
the scene thereof, or when the offense is continuing or has not been
consummated at the time the arrest is made, the offense is said to be
committed in his presence. (U.S. v. Samonte, 16 Phil. 516)

TITLE TWO
Crimes Against The Fundamental Laws of the State

It has been established that petitioner’s vehicle figured in a
hit and run an offense committed in the “presence” of Manarang,
a private person, who then sought to arrest petitioner. It must be
stressed at this point that “presence” does not only require that
the arresting person sees the offense, but also when he “hears the
disturbance created thereby and proceeds at once to the scene.” (U.S.
v. Samonte, 16 Phil. 516, 519, citing 3 Cyc., 886; Ramsey u. State,
17 S. E., 613; Dilger v. Com., 11 S. W., 651; State u. McAfee, 12 S.
E., 435; State v. Williams, 15 S. E., 554; and Hawkins v. Lutton, 70
N. W., 483) As testified to by Manarang, he heard the screeching of
tires followed by a thud, saw the sideswiped victim (balut vendor),
reported the incident to the police and thereafter gave chase to the
erring Pajero vehicle using his motorcycle in order to apprehend its
driver. After having sent a radio report to the PNP for assistance,
Manarang proceeded to the Abacan bridge where he found responding
policemen SPO2 Borja and SPO2 Miranda already positioned near the
bridge who effected the actual arrest of petitioner. (Padilla v. Court
of Appeals, G.R. No. 12197, March 12, 1997)

—

Requirements for a valid warrantless arrest under Section 5(a) of

Rule 113.

For a warrantless arrest to be valid under Section 5(a) of Rule
113, the following elements must be present:
1)

the person to be arrested must execute an overt act
indicating that he has just committed, is actually
committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and

2)

such overt act is done in the presence or within the view
of the arresting officer. (People v. Cruz, G.R. No. 187047,
June 15, 2011, 652 SCRA 286, citing People v. Chua, 416
Phil. 33, 56 [2001])

In this case, appellants were actually committing a crime and
were caught by the apprehending officers in flagrante delicto. On the
date of their arrest, the apprehending officers, while acting upon a
report from the Barangay Captain, spotted appellants transferring
cargo from one boat to another. However, one of the boats hastily sped
away when they drew closer to the appellants, naturally arousing the
suspicion of the officers. Soon after, the police officers found them
with the illegal drugs plainly exposed to the view of the officers. When
63

Art. 124

TITLE TWO
Cranes Against The Fundamental Laws of the State

they requested appellants to show proper documentation as to their
identity as well as their purpose for being there, appellants refused
to show them anything much less respond to any of their questions.
In fact, when the officers were transporting appellants and the illegal
drugs to the shore, the appellant Chi Chan Liu even repeatedly
offered the arresting officers “big, big amount of money.” Hence, the
circumstances prior to and surrounding the arrest of appellants clearly
show that they were arrested when they were actually committing a
crime within the view of the arresting officers, who had reasonable
ground to believe that a crime was being committed. (People v. Chi
Chan Liu, G.R. No. 189272, January 21, 2015)

same, which became inadvertently and immediately apparent
from
the point of view of the arresting officers. It is undeniably
clear,
therefore, that the seizure of illegal drugs conducted by the officers
falls within the purview of the “plain view” doctrine. (People v. Chi
Chan Liu, supra)
Personal knowledge is required.

Under Section 5, Rule 113 of the Revised Rules of Criminal
Procedure, an officer arresting a person who has just committed
an offense must have probable cause to believe based on personal
knowledge of facts and circumstances that the person to be arrested
has committed it.

Plain view doctrine.
Objects in the “plain view” of an officer who has the right to be
in the position to have that view are subject to seizure and may be
presented as evidence. (People v. Leangsiri, 322 Phil. 226, 248 [1996])

In People v. Bati, G.R. No. 87429, August 27, 1990, it was held
that police officers had personal knowledge of the actual commission
of the crime when it had earlier conducted surveillance activities of
the accused. Thus, it stated:

It is usually applied where a police officer is not searching for
evidence against the accused, but nonetheless inadvertently comes
across an incriminating object.(Harris v. U.S., 390 U.S. 234 [1968])

“When Luciano and Caraan reached the place
where the alleged transaction would take place and while
positioned at a street corner, they saw appellant Regalado
Bati and Warner Marquez by the side of the street about
forty to fifty meters away from them (the public officers).
They saw Marquez giving something to Bati, who,
thereafter handed a wrapped object to Marquez who then
inserted the object inside the front of his pants infront of
his abdomen while Bati, on his part, placed the thing given
to him inside his pocket, (p. 2)

The following elements must be present before the doctrine
may be applied:
(a) a prior valid intrusion based on the valid warrantless arrest
in which the police are legally present in the pursuit of their official
duties;

(b) the evidence was inadvertently discovered by the police
who have the right to be where they are;
(c)

XXX

the evidence must be immediately apparent; and,

(d)

“plain view” justified mere seizure of evidence without
further search. (People v. Bolasa, 321 SCRA 459 [1999])

Illustration:
The apprehending officers were performing their duty of
ascertaining whether a criminal activity was indeed happening at the
time and place reported by the Barangay Captain. In broad daylight,
appellants were seen in the act of transferring bags illegal drugs
of
from one boat to another and thereafter caught in possession of the

. . . Both Patrolman Luciano and Caraan actually
witnessed the same and their testimonies were based on
their actual and personal knowledge of the events that
took place leading to appellant’s arrest. They may not have
been within hearing distance, specially since conversation
would expectedly be carried on hushed tones, but they
were certainly near enough to observe the movements of
the appellant and the buyer. (People v. Bati, supra, citing
People u. Agapito, G.R. No. 73786, October 12, 1987)

Art. 124

Probable cause.
The arresting officer’s determination of probable cause under
Section 5(b), Rule 113 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure is
based on his personal knowledge of facts or circumstances that the
person sought to be arrested has committed the crime.
Personal knowledge of facts must be based on probable cause,
which means an actual belief or reasonable grounds of suspicion.
(People v. Cubcubin, Jr., 413 Phil. 249 [2001]) The grounds of suspicion
are reasonable when, in the absence of actual belief of the arresting
officers, the suspicion that the person to be arrested is probably guilty
of committing the offense is based on actual facts, i.e., supported by
circumstances sufficiently strong in themselves to create the probable
cause of guilt of the person to be arrested. A reasonable suspicion,
therefore, must be founded on probable cause, coupled with good faith
on the part of the peace officers making the arrest. (Umil v. Ramos,
G.R. No. 81567, October 3, 1991, 202 SCRA 251; People v. Lozada,
454 Phil. 241 [2003])

Probable cause was found to be present in the following
instances:
(a)

where the distinctive odor of marijuana emanated from the
plastic bag carried by the accused. (People v. Claudio, 160
SCRA 646, 1988)

(b)

where an informer positively identified the accused who
was observed to be acting suspiciously. (People v. Tangliben,
184 SCRA 220, 1990)
(c) where the accused who were riding a jeepney were stopped
and searched by policemen who had earlier received
confidential reports that said accused would transport a
quantity of marijuana. (People w. Maspil, Jr., 188 SCRA
751, 1990)
A crime must in fact or actually have been committed first

In arrests without a warrant under Section 5(b), however, it is
not enough that there is reasonable ground to believe that the person
to be arrested has committed a crime. A crime must in fact or actually
have been committed first. That a crime has actually been committed
is an essential precondition. The fact of the commission
of the offense
must be undisputed, xxx. (People v. Burgos, 144 SCRA 1)

TITLE TWO
Crimes Against The Fundamental Laws of the State

When the person to be arrested is attempting to commit an offense.

Illustration:
A policeman, acting under orders of his chief who desired to put

a stop to pilfering in a certain locality, patrolled his district, and about
midnight, seeing two persons in front of an uninhabited house who
afterward entered an uninhabited camarin, arrested them without

warrant, although no crime had been committed. The policeman took
them to the municipal presidencia where they were detained in jail
for six or seven hours before they were released.

Held: Prevention of crime is just as commendatory as the
capture of criminals. Surely the officer must not be forced to await
the commission of robbery or other felony. The rule is supported by
the necessities of life. The applicable principles rest upon the same
foundation of reason and common sense. (U.S. v. Santos, 36 Phil. 853)

When an offense has in fact just been committed, and he has
probable cause to believe based on personal knowledge of facts
and circumstances that the person to be arrested has committed it.

Requirements for a valid warrantless arrest under Section
5(b) of Rule 113.

The following must be present for a valid warrantless arrest
under Section 5(b), Rule 113:
1)

the crime should have been just committed; and

the arresting officer’s exercise of discretion is limited by
the standard of probable cause to be determined from the facts and
circumstances within his personal knowledge. The requirement of
the existence of probable cause objectifies the reasonableness of the
warrantless arrest for purposes of compliance with the Constitutional
mandate against unreasonable arrests. (Pestilos v. Generoso, GJi. No.
182601, November 10, 2014)
2)

Illustrations:
(a) On March 16, 1991, accused, then a bouncer at the “IhawIhaw” nightclub on Bonifacio Street, Davao City, shot one Nelson
Jordan. While patrolling in their car, the policemen received a

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

message from their camp directing them to proceed to Ihaw-Ihaw”
nightclub where there had been a shooting. The policemen proceeded
to the place and found the victim. Bystanders pointed to the accused
as the one who shot Jordan and the policemen arrested him. The
Court held that the arresting officers acted on the basis of personal
knowledge of the death of the victim and of facts indicating that the
accused was the assailant. Thus, the warrantless arrest was held
valid. (People v. Jayson, 346 Phil. 847, 853-854 [1997])

Four men announced a hold-up in a jeepney and divested
the passengers of their personal belongings, including the jacket
of Araneta. The jeepney driver and his passengers went to Fort
Bonifacio to report the crime and a team was formed to track down
the suspects. Araneta went with the responding police officers and
saw four persons, one of whom was wearing his stolen jacket, walking
casually towards Fort Bonifacio. Araneta told the police officers to
accost said persons. After the police officers introduced themselves,
the four men scampered to different directions but three of them were
apprehended. It was held that the warrantless arrest was legal. It
falls within the purview of Section 5(b) of Rule 113 which serves as
an exception to the requisite warrant prior to arrest inasmuch as
the police team was formed and dispatched to look for the persons
responsible for the crime on account of the information related by
the victims that they had just been robbed. (People v. Acol, 232 Phil.
406 [1994])
(b)

Section 5(b), Rule 113 of the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure
does not require the arresting officers to personally witness
the commission of the offense.
Section 5, Rule 113 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure does
not require the arresting officers to personally witness the commission
of the offense with their own eyes. In this case, P/Supt. Doria received
a report about the alleged shooting incident. He dispatched a team led
by PO3 Ramirez to investigate the report and PO3
Ramirez reported
that a certain William Sia was wounded while Judge Abelita III,
who was implicated in the incident, and his wife just left the place
of the incident. P/Supt. Doria looked for Abelita
III and when he
found him, he informed him of the incident report. P/Supt. Doria
requested Abelita III to go with him to the police
headquarters and
Abelita III agreed but suddenly sped up his vehicle and
proceeded to
his residence where P/Supt. Doria and his companions
caught him
up as he was about to run towards his
house. The Court held that

TITLE TWO
Crimes Against The Fundamental Laws of the State

the petitioner’s act of trying to get away, coupled with the incident
report which they investigated, were enough to raise a reasonable
suspicion on the part of the police authorities as to the existence
of
probable cause. (Abelita v. Doria, G.R. No. 170672, August 14, 2009,
596 SCRA 220, 227)
There must be a large measure of Immediacy between the time the
offense was committed and the time of the arrest. If there was an
appreciable lapse of time between the arrest and the commission
of the crime, a warrant of arrest must be secured.

An appreciable lapse of time ensued in the following cases:
(1) On December 8, 1994, Dennis Venturina, a member of
Sigma Rho at the University of the Philippines, was killed in a
rumble between his fraternity and another. On December 11, 1994,
UP Chancellor Posadas asked the NBI’s assistance in determining
the persons responsible for the crime. On December 12, 1994, on
the basis of the supposed identification of two alleged eyewitnesses,
the NBI attempted to arrest Francis Carlo Taparan and Raymundo
Narag, officers of the Scintilla Juris Fraternity, as suspects in
the killing of Venturina. It was held that the NBI agents had no
personal knowledge of any fact which might indicate that the two
students were probably guilty of the crime. What they had were the
supposed positive identification of two alleged eyewitnesses, which
is insufficient to justify the arrest without a warrant by the NBI.
(Posadas v. Ombudsman, G.R. No. 131492, September 29, 2000, 341

SCRA 388)

(2) On May 12, 1982, Cesar Masamlok personally and
voluntarily surrendered to the authorities at the PC Headquarters,
stating that he was forcibly recruited by Ruben Burgos as a member
of the NPA, threatening him with the use of firearm against his life,
if he refused. The following day, a joint team of PC-INP units was
dispatched to arrest Burgos and was able to locate Burgos who was
plowing the field. It was held that the arrest was invalid considering
that the only information that the police officers had in effecting the
arrest was the information from Masamlok who led the authorities
to suspect that the accused had committed a crime. They were still
fishing for evidence of a crime not yet ascertained. (People v. Burgos,
G.R. L-68995, September 4, 1986, 144 SCRA 1)

TITLE TWO
Crimes Against The Fundamental Laws of the State

On May 13, 1996, robbery with homicide was committed by
a group of robbers who was on board the tricycle of del Rosario when
they left the crime scene. A tricycle driver who witnessed the incident
and who recognized del Rosario reported the same to the police. On
May 14, 1996, del Rosario was arrested during the police raid at the
place of one of his co-accused. It was held that the requirement that
an offense has just been committed means that there must be a large
measure of immediacy between the time the offense was committed
and the time of the arrest. If there was an appreciable lapse of time
between the arrest and the commission of the crime, a warrant of
arrest must be secured. In this case, the arrest of del Rosano does not
comply with the requirement for a warrantless arrest since the arrest
came a day after the consummation of the crime and not immediately
thereafter. As such, the crime had not been “just committed” at the
time the accused was arrested. Likewise, the arresting officers had no
personal knowledge of facts indicating that the person to be arrested
had committed the offense since they were not present and were
not actual eyewitnesses to the crime, and they became aware of his
identity as the driver of the getaway tricycle only during the custodial
investigation. (People v. del Rosario, 365 Phil. 292, 312 [1999])
(4) On July 2, 1991, Eldon Maguan was driving his car along
Wilson St., San Juan, a one way street, when petitioner entered the
street and started travelling in the “wrong” direction. Petitioner’s
and Maguan’s cars nearly bumped each other. Petitioner alighted
from his car, walked over, and shot Maguan inside his car. Petitioner
then boarded his car and left the scene. The police arrived at the
scene of the shooting shortly thereafter and started conducting an
investigation, eventually establishing that the assailant was probably
the petitioner. On July 8, 1991, petitioner presented himself before
the San Juan Police Station, accompanied by two lawyers, to verify
news reports that he was being hunted by the police. The police
forthwith detained him. It was held that the arrest of the accused six
days after the commission of the crime was invalid because the crime
had not just been committed. Moreover, the “arresting” officers had
no “personal knowledge” of facts indicating that the accused was the
gunman who had shot the victim. The information upon
which the
police acted came from statements made by alleged
eyewitnesses to
the shooting; one stated that the accused was the gunman;
another
was able to take down the alleged gunman’s car’s plate number
which
turned out to be registered in the name of the accused’s
wife. That
information did not constitute “personal knowledge.” (Rolito Go v.

No arbitrary detention when there is a valid arrest

Illustration:
A Constabulary officer was engaged to marry a girl, but later, the

engagement was broken. Thereafter, while the officer was passing in
front of the girl’s house, he was assaulted by the girl’s two brothers,
after the girl had approached him in a friendly manner, which
she never did before. He suspected the girl had conspired with his
assailants, and so he ordered her arrest and detention. The officer
filed a complaint against the girl and her brothers. For her arrest and
detention, the officer was charged with arbitrary detention.
Held: The Constabulary officer was not guilty of arbitrary
detention. (People v. Ancheta, 68 Phil. 415)

Note: The Constabulary officer, in ordering the arrest and
detention of the girl, had probable cause to believe that the girl
participated in the assault as one of the conspirators.
In arbitrary detention, the legality of the detention does not

depend upon the juridical and much less the judicial fact of a crime

(the elements of the felony are present and they were so found by
the court), which at the time of the commission, is not and can not
definitely be determined for lack of necessary data and of jurisdiction,
but upon the nature of the deed. It is sufficient that the agent or person

in authority making the arrest has reasonably sufficient grounds to
believe the existence of an act having the characteristics of a crime
and that the same grounds exist for him to believe that the person
sought to be detained participated therein. The obligation to make
an arrest by reason of crime, does not presuppose as a necessary
requisite for the fulfillment thereof, the indubitable existence of a
crime. (People v. Ancheta, 68 Phil. 415)

Under Section 5, Rule 113 of the Revised Rules of Criminal
Procedure, the actual commission of a crime by the person detained
is not necessary to justify his detention.

The legality of the detention of a person does not depend upon
the actual commission of a crime by him, but upon the nature of his
deed when its characterization as a crime may reasonably be inferred
by the officer to whom the law at the moment leaves the decision for
the urgent purpose of suspending the liberty of that person. (U.S. v.
Sanchez, 27 Phil. 442)

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Illustration:
Two Bureau of Internal Revenue secret service agents, strangers
in the municipality, were seen acting suspiciously near the market
place. The accused, two policemen, called upon them to give an
account of themselves and explain their suspicious conduct, and at
the same time demanded that they produce their cedulas, which the
agents were unable to do. Believing that their conduct and inability to
satisfactorily account for themselves justified the suspicion that they
were in some way connected with the recent robberies in the place, or
that they were about to commit theft or robbery, the accused placed
the two men under arrest and took them forthwith to the house of
the justice of the peace, accused Battalones, informing the latter of
the arrest of the two men with them and asking him to decide what
was proper to do. The justice of the peace, without verifying the truth
of the claims of the agents that they were of the Bureau of Internal
Revenue, ordered them taken to the municipal jail to be detained
until further orders.
Held: No charge of arbitrary detention can be maintained against
the two policemen. In the light of after events, the suspicion directed
against the secret service agents was not well-founded, but viewing
the facts as they must have presented themselves to the policemen
at the time of the arrest, they must be held to have had reasonable
grounds upon which to base their suspicions as to the arrested men.
But the justice of the peace who arbitrarily and without
investigation directed the detention of the agents was held guilty of
the crime of“detention arbitraria” through negligence. The justice of
the peace was not actuated by any special malice or ill-will toward
the prisoners, but he was willfully negligent of their rights. (U.S. v.
Battalones, et al., 23 Phil. 46)
No reasonable ground if officer only wants to know the commission
of crime.

In a case where the accused was arrested and prosecuted for
illegal possession of opium, the witness testified that the only
reason
why he ordered the arrest of the accused was
that he was acting
suspiciously. He did not say in what way the accused was acting
suspiciously or what was the particular act or
circumstance which

TITLE TWO
Crimes Against The Fundamental Laws of the State

aroused his suspicion. He caused the arrest because, as he said, “I
wanted to see if he had committed a crime.” It was held that it was
not a legal reason for making an arrest. (U.S. v. Hachaw, 21 Phil. 514)

Note: There is no reasonable ground of suspicion that the accused
committed an offense.
When the person to be arrested is a prisoner who has escaped.

In a petition for habeas corpus, it was alleged that Nicasio
Salonga was arrested without a warrant of arrest and that he was
not accused of any crime. It appears that Salonga was committed to
prison under judgment of the Court ofFirst Instance of Manila for the
crime of illegal discharge of firearm. He was confined in Muntinlupa
prison and upon being transferred to Camp Nichols under custody, he
effected an escape. It was held that being a prisoner who escaped, he
can be arrested without a warrant of arrest not only by the authorities
but also by any private person. (Salonga v. Holland, et al., 76 Phil.
412, citing the Rules of Court)
Under Section 5(c), Rule 113, one of the instances when a person
may be validly arrested without warrant is where he has escaped from
confinement. Undoubtedly, this right of arrest without a warrant of
arrest, is founded on the principle that at the time of the surest, the
escapee is in the continuous act of committing a crime evading
the serving of his sentence. (Paraluman v. Director of Prisons, 22

SCRA 638)

Arbitrary detention through Imprudence.
The crime of arbitrary detention can be committed through
imprudence.

The chief of police rearrested a woman who had been released by
means of a verbal order of the justice of the peace. The accused acted
without malice, but he should have verified the order of release before
proceeding to make the re-arrest. The crime committed by the chief
of police is arbitrary detention through simple imprudence provided
for and punished under Article 365, paragraph 2, of the R.P.C., in
connection with Article 124, paragraph 1, of the ssime Code. (People

“Shall detain any person for some legal ground.”

Under Article 125, the public officer or employee has detained
the offended party for some legal ground. The detention is legal in
the beginning, because the person detained was arrested under any of
the circumstances where arrest without warrant is authorized by law.
The detention becomes illegal after a certain period of time, because
the offended party is not delivered to the proper judicial authority,
within the period specified by Article 125.
If the detention of a person is not for some legal ground, it will
be a case under Article 124, not under Article 125.
Lino v. Fuguso
(77 Phil. 937-939)

Facts: Pascual Montaniel was arrested without warrant by the police
officers of Manila on November 8, 1946, for inciting to sedition, and Pacifico
Deoduco, on November 7, 1946, for resisting arrest and disobedience to police
orders. On November 11, when this petition for habeas corpus was filed, these
two petitioners were still under arrest. They were thus held in confinement
for three and four days, respectively, without warrants and without charges
formally filed in court. The papers of their cases were not transmitted to the
City Fiscal’s Office until late in the afternoon of November 11.
65

Art. 125

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Upon investigation by that office, no sufficient evidence was found to
warrant the prosecution of Pascual Montaniel for inciting to sedition and
of Pacifico Deoduco for resisting arrest, but both remained under custody
because of informations filed with the municipal court charging Montaniel
with unjust vexation and Deoduco with disobedience to an agent of a person
in authority. And so far, no warrants of arrest or orders of commitment
are shown to have been issued by the municipal court pursuant to the
informations thus filed.
Held: Under these facts, the detention of Pacifico Deoduco and Pascual
Montaniel is illegal. Even assuming that they were legally arrested without
warrant on November 7 and 8, 1946, respectively, their continued detention
became illegal upon the expiration of six hours without their having been
delivered to the corresponding judicial authorities.
Note: Before E.O. No. 272, the detention of a person legally arrested
without a warrant becomes illegal upon the expiration of:
a)
six (6) hours, for crimes or offenses punishable by light penalties,
or their equivalent; or

nine (9) hours, for crimes or offenses punishable by correctional
penalties, or their equivalent; or
b)

c)
eighteen ( 18) hours, for crimes or offenses punishable by afflictive
or capital penalties, or their equivalent.

Article 125 does not apply when the arrest is by virtue of a

warrant of arrest.

Article 125 applies only when the arrest is made without a warrant
of arrest. But the arrest must be lawful.

If the arrest is made with a warrant of arrest, the person arrested
can be detained indefinitely until his case is decided by the court or
he posts a bail for his temporary release.
The reason for this is that there is already a complaint or
information filed against him with the court which issued the order
or warrant of arrest and it is not necessary to deliver the person
thus
arrested to that court.
Disposition of person arrested without a warrant.

In cases falling under paragraphs (a) and (b) of
Article 113, the person arrested without a warrant shall beSection 6,

TITLE TWO
Crimes Against The Fundamental Laws of the State

Art. 125

Section 7, Rule 112 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure
states that:
“When a person is lawfully arrested without a
warrant involving an offense which requires a preliminary
investigation, the complaint or information may be filed by
a prosecutor without need of such investigation provided
an inquest has been conducted in accordance with existing
Rules. In the absence or unavailability of an inquest
prosecutor, the complaint may be filed by the offended
party or a peace officer directly with the proper court on
the basis of the affidavit of the offended party or arresting
officer or person.”
“Shall fail to deliver such person to the proper judicial authorities.”

It will be noted that what constitutes a violation of Article 125
is the failure to deliver the person arrested to the proper judicial
authority within the period specified therein.
The delivery to the judicial authority of a person arrested
without warrant by a peace officer, does not consist in a physical
delivery, but in making an accusation or charge or filing of an
information against the person arrested with the corresponding court
or judge, whereby the latter acquires jurisdiction to issue an order
of release or of commitment of the prisoner, because the arresting
officer can not transfer to the judge and the latter does not assume
the physical custody of the person arrested. (Sayo v. Chief of Police
of Manila, 80 Phil. 859)
Duty of detaining officer is deemed complied with upon the filing
of the complaint with the judicial authority.
Agbay v. Deputy Ombudsman for the Military
(309 SCRA 726)

Facts: On September 7, 1997, petitioner and a certain Sherwin Jugalbot
were arrested and detained at the Liloan Police Station, Cebu for alleged
violation of R.A. No. 7610, the “Special Protection of Children Against
Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.” On September 8, a
Complaint for violation of RA. No. 7610 was filed against them before the
7th Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Liloan, Metro Cebu. On September
10, counsel for petitioner wrote the Chief of Police of Liloan demanding the
immediate release of petitioner considering that the Chief of Police had failed
67

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

to deliver petitioner to the proper judicial authority within 36 hours from
September 7. Private respondents did not act on this letter and continued
to detain petitioner. On September 27, a complaint for delay in the delivery
of detained persons was filed against respondents who are police officers
stationed at the Liloan Police Station.
Held: Article 125 of the R.P.C. is intended to prevent any abuse resulting
from confining a person without informing him of his offense and without
permitting him to go on bail. Upon the filing of the complaint with the
Municipal Trial Court, the intent behind Article 125 is satisfied considering
that by such act, the detained person is informed of the crime imputed against
him and, upon his application with the court, he may be released on bail.

may ask for a preliminary investigation in accordance with th[e]
Rule, but he must sign a waiver of the provisions of Article 125 of the
R.P.C., as amended, in the presence of his counsel. Notwithstanding
the waiver, he may apply for bail and the investigation must be
terminated within 15 days from its inception. (Sec. 7, par. 2, Rule
112, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure)
Circumstances considered in determining liability of officer
detaining a person beyond legal period.

The term “judicial authorities,” as used in Article 125, means
the courts ofjustice or judges of said courts vested with judicial power
to order the temporary detention or confinement of a person charged
with having committed a public offense, that is, the “Supreme Court
and such inferior courts as may be established by law.” (Sec. 1, Article
VIII of the 1987 Constitution)

For the purpose of determining the criminal liability of an officer
detaining a person for more than the time prescribed by the R.P.C.,
(1) the means of communication as well as (2) the hour of arrest and
(3) other circumstances such as the time of surrender and the material
possibility for the fiscal to make the investigation and file in time
the necessary information, must be taken into consideration. (Sayo
v. Chief of Police of Manila, 80 Phil. 861)

The judicial authorities mentioned in Section 125 of the R.P.C.
cannot be considered to include the fiscal of the City of Manila or
any other city, because they cannot issue a warrant of arrest or of
commitment for temporary confinement of a person surrendered to
legalize the detention of the person arrested without warrant. (Sayo
v. Chief of Police, supra)

Thus, when the accused were arrested for direct assault,
punishable by a correctional penalty, on the evening of June 17, 1953,
the complaint could not normally been filed earlier than 8:00 in the
morning of June 18, because government offices open for business
usually at 8:00 in the morning and close at 5:00 in the afternoon.
(People v. Acosta, C.A., 54 O.G. 4742)

In contrast with a city fiscal, it is undisputed that a municipal
court judge, even in the performance of his function to conduct
preliminary investigations, retains the power to issue an order
of release or commitment. (Agbay v. Deputy Ombudsman for the
Military, 309 SCRA 726)
Detained person should be released when a Judge is not available.

Where a judge is not available, the arresting officer is duty-bound

to release a detained person, if the maximum hours for detention
provided under Article 125 of the R.P.C. has already expired. Failure
to cause the release may result in an offense under Article 125. (Albior
v. Auguis, A.M. No. P-01-1472, June 26, 2003)

“Non-office” days should not be included in the computation of the
period prescribed by law for the filing of complaint/information in
courts.

The alleged crimes for which petitioner Soria was arrested
without warrant are punishable by correctional penalties or their
equivalent, thus, criminal complaints or information should be
filed with the proper judicial authorities within 18 hours of his
arrest. In this case, Soria’s detention lasted 22 hours. It is alleged
that public respondents gravely erred in construing Article 125 as
excluding Sundays, holidays and election days in the computation
of the periods prescribed within which public officers should deliver
arrested persons to the proper judicial authorities as the law never
makes such exception.
69

Art. 125

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Held-. An election day or a special holiday should not be included
in the computation of the period prescribed by law for the filing of
complaint/information in courts in cases of warrantless arrests, it
being a “no-office day .” (Medina v. Orosco, 125 Phil. 313) In the instant
case, Soria was arrested without a warrant at 8:30 p.m. on May 13
(a Sunday, the day before the May 14, 2001 elections) and while it
appears that the complaints against him for Illegal Possession of
Firearm and Violation of COMELEC Resolution No. 3328 were filed
with the courts only on May 15, 2001 at 4:30 p.m., he had already
been released the day before or on May 14, 2001 at about 6:30 p.m.
by the respondents. Hence, there could be no arbitrary detention or
violation of Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code to speak of. (Soria
v. Desierto, G.R. Nos. 153524-25, January 31, 2005)
Violation of Article 125 does not affect legality of confinement under
process issued by a court.

A was arrested and detained for theft. The arresting officer filed
the complaint with the City Fiscal only after 24 hours. An information
for theft against A was filed with the court on the same day by the
fiscal. Warrant of arrest was issued by the court.

Held: The failure of the arresting officer to deliver the person
arrested to the judicial authority within the time specified in Article
125, does not affect the legality of the confinement of the petitioner
who is detained because of the warrant subsequently issued by a
competent court when an information was filed therein. (Lino v.
Fuguso, et al., 77 Phil. 933; Gunabe, et al. v. Director of Prisons, 77
Phil. 993)
As a matter of fact, a violation of Article 125 is not considered
as one of the grounds on which one can predicate a motion to quash
the information under Rule 113, Section 2 of the Rules of Court (Sec.
3, Rule 117 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure). (People v.
Mabong, 100 Phil. 1069)
The Illegality of detention is not cured by the filing of the information
in court.

The detaining officer is liable under Article 125, even if an
information was filed with the court, because a violation had already
been committed before the information was filed.
70

TITLE TWO
Crimefl Against The Fundamental Laws of the State

Art. 125

Fiscal not liable, unless he ordered detention.

If the city fiscal does not file the information within the period of
six hours prescribed by law and the arresting officer continues holding
the prisoner beyond the six-hour (nine-hour, or 18-hour) period, the
fiscal will not be responsible for violation of said Article 125, because
he is not the one who has arrested and illegally detained the person
arrested, unless he has ordered or induced the arresting officer to
hold and not release the prisoner after the expiration of said period.
(Sayo v. Chief of Police of Manila, 80 Phil. 863)
If no charge is filed by the fiscal in court within the period fixed in
Article 125, the arresting officer must release the detainee; otherwise,
he will be guilty under Article 125.
Remedy where warrant improperly issued.

If the accused was illegally detained because he was arrested
without a preliminary examination, what should have been done
was to set aside the warrant of arrest and order the discharge of the

accused, but without enjoining the municipal judge from conducting a
preliminary examination and afterwards properly issuing a warrant
of arrest. (Alimpoos v. Court of Appeals, 106 SCRA 159)

Rights of the person detained:
1.

He shall be informed of the cause of his detention; and

2.

He shall be allowed, upon his request, to communicate and
confer at anytime with his attorney or counsel. (Art. 125,
par. 2)

Public officer or employee is liable for preventing the exercise of
the right of attorneys to visit and confer with persons arrested.
Any public officer or employee who shall obstruct, prohibit, or
otherwise prevent an attorney entitled to practice in the courts of
the Philippines from visiting and conferring privately with a person
arrested, at any hour of the day or, in urgent cases, of the night,
said visit and conference being requested by the person arrested or
by another acting in his behalf, shall be punished by arresto mayor.

TITLE TWO
Crimes Against The Fundamental Laws of the State

Reason for the provisions of Article 125.

R-A. No. 7438
Rights of Persons Arrested, Detained or
Under Custodial Investigation

Article 125 of the R.P.C. is intended to prevent any abuse
resulting from confining a person without informing him of his offense
and without permitting him to go on bail. (Laurel v. Misa, 76 Phil. 372)

Article 125 distinguished from Article 124:
In arbitrary detention under Article 124, the detention is illegal
from the beginning; in arbitrary detention under Article 125, the
detention is legal in the beginning but the illegality of the detention
starts from the expiration of any of the periods of time specified in
Article 125, without the prisoner detained having been delivered to
the proper judicial authority.
DETENTION UNDER REPUBUC ACT NO. 11479
The time period for delivery of detained persons prescribed in Article
125 does not apply to suspected terrorists who are detained under
R.A. No. 11479.

Persons suspected of acts of terrorism under Sections 4
(Terrorism), 5 (Threat to Commit Terrorism), 6 (Planning, Training,

Preparing and Facilitating the Commission of Terrorism), 7
(Conspiracy to Commit Terrorism), 8 (Proposal to Commit Terrorism),
9 (Inciting to Commit Terrorism), 10 (Recruitment to and Membership
in a Terrorist Organization), 11 (Foreign Terrorist), and 12 (Providing
Material Support to Terrorists) of R.A. No. 11479 may be detained
for 14 calendar days without the law enforcement agent or military
personnel being held criminally liable for delay in delivery of detained
persons under Art. 125 provided that such agent or personnel has been
duly authorized in writing by the Anti-Terrorism Council. (Sec. 29)

The period of detention may be extended to a maximum period
of 10 calendar days if it is established that (1) further detention of
the person/s is necessary to preserve evidence related to terrorism
or complete the investigation; (2) further detention of the person/s is
necessary to prevent the commission of another terrorism; and (3) the
investigation is being conducted properly and without delay. (Sec. 29)

Custodial investigation.

Custodial investigation involves any questioning initiated by
law enforcement authorities after a person is taken into custody or
otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant manner.
The rules on custodial investigation begin to operate as soon as the
investigation ceases to be a general inquiry into an unsolved crime
and begins to focus a particular suspect, the suspect is taken into
custody, and the police carries out a process of interrogations that
tends itself to eliciting incriminating statements that the rule begins
to operate. (People v. Marra, 236 SCRA 565)
“Custodial investigation” shall include the practice of issuing
an “invitation” to a person who is investigated in connection with an
offense he is suspected to have committed, without prejudice to the
liability of the “inviting” officer for any violation of law. (Sec. 2, last
par., R.A. No. 7438)
Rights of Persons Arrested, Detained, or Under Custodial
Investigation.

—

Right to counsel. Any person arrested, detained, or under
custodial investigation shall at all times be assisted by counsel. (Sec. 2[a])
In the absence of any lawyer, no custodial investigation shall be
conducted and the suspected person can only be detained by the
investigating officer in accordance with the provisions of Article 125
of the Revised Penal Code. (Sec. 3, last par., R.A. No. 7438)
(a)

Right to be informed of his right to remain silent and to
counsel.- Any public officer or employee, or anyone acting under his
order or his place, who arrests, detains or investigates any person for
the commission of an offense shall inform the latter, in a language
known to and understood by him, of his rights to remain silent and to
have competent and independent counsel, preferably of his own choice,
who shall at all times be allowed to confer privately with the person
arrested, detained or under custodial investigation. If such person

That the offender is a public officer or employee.
That he expels any person from the Philippines, or compels a

That the offender is not authorized to do so by law.

Art. 128. Violation of domicile. The penalty of prision

any public officer or employee who, not being authorized by
judicial order, shall enter any dwelling against the will of the
owner thereof, search papers or other effects found therein
without the previous consent of such owner, or, having
surreptitiously entered said dwelling, and being required to
leave the premises, shall refuse to do so.

If the offense be committed in the nighttime, or if any
papers or effects not constituting evidence of a crime be not
returned immediately after the search made by the offender,
the penalty shall be prision correctional in its medium and
maximum periods.7

“Not being thereunto authorized by law.”

Only the court by a final judgment can order a person to
change his residence. This is illustrated in ejectment proceedings,
expropriation proceedings and in the penalty of destierro.

Hence, the Mayor and the Chief of Police of Manila cannot
force the prostitutes residing in that City to go to and live in Davao
against their will, there being no law that authorizes them to do so.
These women, despite their being in a sense, lepers of society, are
nevertheless not chattels, but Philippine citizens, protected by the
same constitutional guarantees as are other citizens. (Villavicencio,

The offender must be a public officer or employee.

owner thereof is a private individual, the crime committed is trespass
to dwelling. (Art. 280)

entry into the house by a peace officer for the purpose of search
against the will of its owner and without search warrant. (U.S. v. De
los Reyes, 20 Phil. 467)
Suppose that the opium found, after search without the previous
consent of the owner of the house, belonged to said owner, and the
peace officer had no search warrant, is the peace officer liable for
violation of domicile?

Art. 128

“Not being authorized by judicial order.”
A public officer or employee is authorized by judicial order when
he is armed with a search warrant duly issued by the court. Hence,
he is not being authorized by judicial order, when the public officer
has no search warrant.
“Against the will of the owner.”

It will be noted that to constitute a violation of domicile, the
entrance by the public officer or employee must be against the will of
the owner of the dwelling, which presupposes opposition or prohibition
by said owner, whether express or implied. If the entrance by the
public officer or employee is only without the consent of the owner
of the dwelling, the crime is not committed. Neither is the crime
committed if the owner of the dwelling consented to such entrance.
(People v. Luis Sane, C.A., 40 O.G., Supp. 5, 113)
Right of officer to break Into building or enclosure.

An officer, in order to make an arrest either by virtue of a
warrant, or without a warrant as provided in Section 5, may break
into any building or enclosure where the person to be arrested is or
is reasonably believed to be, if he is refused admittance thereto, after
announcing his authority and purpose. (Sec. 11, Rule 113, Revised
Rules on Criminal Procedure)
The reason for this provision is that “while it may be true in
general that ‘a man’s house is his castle,’ it is equally true that he may
not use that castle as a citadel for aggression against his neighbors,
nor can he, within its walls, create such disorder as to affect their
peace.” (U.S. v. Vallejo, 11 Phil. 193)
A peace officer without search warrant cannot lawfully enter the
dwelling against the will of the owner, even if he knew that someone
In the dwelling is having unlawful possession of opium.

But the mere fact that a visitor of the house of another is
is no excuse for

Yes. The peace officer is liable for violation of domicile. No
amount of incriminating evidence, whatever its source, will supply
the place of search warrant. (McLurg v. Brenton, 123 Iowa, 368, cited
in dissenting opinion in Moncado v. People, 80 Phil. 25)
“Search papers, etc. without previous consent of such owner.”

When one voluntarily submits to a search or consents to have
it made upon his person or premises, he is precluded from later
complaining thereof. The right to be secure from unreasonable search
may, like every right, be waived and such waiver may be made either
expressly or impliedly. (People v. Malasugui, 63 Phil. 221; Rodriguez
v. Villamiel, 65 Phil. 231)

Silence of the owner of the dwelling before and during the search,
without search warrant, by a public officer, may show implied waiver.
Where the owner of the house did not object to the opening of
her wooden closet and the taking of their personal properties, such
failure to object or resist did not amount to an implied waiver of her
right against unreasonable search and seizure where the petitioners
were armed with handguns and one of the petitioners threatened
and intimidated her. (Rojas v. Spouses Matillano, G.R. No. 141176,
May 27,2004)
Meaning of “search" as used in this article.

Two policemen were charged with violation of domicile. What
they did was to enter the house of the complainant and look for the
pen knife which the latter carried when they followed him. Nobody
prohibited or prevented their entrance to said house whose doors were
open, and the alleged search was limited to looking at what was in
the sala and the kitchen. It was held that the fact of looking at what
was in the sala and the kitchen of the house to see if the pen knife

suspected of having unlawful possession of opium,

But when the owner of the house had objected to the intended

unnecessary severity in executing the same. (As amended by
RA. No. 10951)

Art. 129

“Papers or other effects found therein.”

Article 128 is not applicable when a public officer searched a
person outside his dwelling without search warrant and such person is
not legally arrested for an offense, because the papers or other effects
mentioned in Article 128 must be found in the dwelling.

Art. 129

Acts punishable in connection with search warrants.
1.

By procuring a search warrant without just cause;

2.

By exceeding his authority or by using unnecessary severity in
executing a search warrant legally procured.

In such case, the crime committed by the public officer is grave
coercion, if violence or intimidation is used (Art. 286), or upjust
vexation, if there is no violence or intimidation. (Art. 287)

Elements of procuring a search warrant without just cause:

a.

That the offender is a public officer or employee;

“Having surreptitiously entered said dwelling.”

b.

That he procures a search warrant;

This is probably an instance where a public officer or employee
may commit violation of domicile even if the entrance is only without
the consent of its owner; that is, the offender surreptitiously entered
the dwelling. But in this case, what constitutes the crime is the refusal
of the offender to leave the premises when required to do so
not
the entrance into the dwelling.

c.

That there is no just cause.

If the offense is committed at nighttime; or

except in the presence of the lawful occupant thereof or any
member
of his family or in the absence of the latter, in the presence
of two
witnesses of sufficient age and discretion residing in the same locality.
(Sec. 8, Rule 126, Revised Rules of

Art. 129

Validity of search warrant.

A search warrant shall be valid for 10 days from its date.
Thereafter, it shall be void. (Sec. 10, Rule 126, Revised Rules of
Criminal Procedure)
A receipt for the property seized.

The officer seizing property under the warrant must give a
detailed receipt for the same to the lawful occupant of the premises in
whose presence the search and seizure were made, or in the absence
of such occupant, must, in the presence of at least two witnesses of
sufficient age and discretion residing in the same locality, leave a
receipt in the place in which he found the seized property. (Sec. 11,
Rule 126, Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure)

Probable cause, defined.

It is such reasons, supported by facts and circumstances, as will
warrant a cautious man in the belief that his action, and the means
taken in prosecuting it, are legally just and proper. (U.S. v. Addison,
28 Phil. 580; Corro v. Lising, 137 SCRA 541)

Probable cause for a search is defined as such facts and
circumstances which would lead a reasonably discreet and prudent
man to believe that an offense has been committed and that the object
sought in connection with the offense are in the place sought to be
searched. (Burgos v. Chief of Staff , 133 SCRA 800)
When Is a search warrant said to have been procured without Just
cause?
A search warrant is said to have been procured without just
cause when it appears on the face of the affidavits filed in support of
the application therefor, or through other evidence, that the applicant
had every reason to believe that the search warrant sought for was
unjustified.

Example: A peace officer wanted to verify a report that some
corpse was unlawfully buried in a monastery. Instead of stating to
that effect, he alleged in an affidavit that opium was hidden in the
premises. If no opium was found, the officer is guilty under this
article. (Guevara)

Art. 129

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Test of lack of just cause.

The true test of lack of just cause is whether the affidavit filed
in support of the application for search warrant has been drawn in

such a manner that perjury could be charged thereon and affiant be
held liable for damages caused. The oath required must refer to the
truth of the facts within the personal knowledge of the applicant for
search warrant or his witnesses, not of the facts “reported to me by
a person whom I consider to be reliable.” (Alvarez v. Court of First
Instance, et al., 64 Phil. 33)
The fact that the search warrant was obtained for the purpose
of extorting money from the owner of the premises to be searched,
is circumstantial evidence of illegal procurement of search warrant.
(People v. De la Pena, et al., 97 Phil. 669)
“In addition to the liability attaching to the offender for the
commission of any other offense."

The public officers procuring a search warrant without just
cause may also be held liable for perjury if they made a willful and
deliberate assertion of falsehood in the affidavits filed in support of
the application for search warrant.

It will be noted that in view of the phrase quoted, even if the
crime of perjury was a necessary means for committing the crime of
search warrant maliciously obtained, they cannot form a complex
crime. They are separate and distinct crimes, to be punished with
their respective penalties.
Evidence obtained in violation of Sections 2 and 3 (formerly Sections
3 and 4) of Article III (formerly Article IV) of the 1987 Constitution Is
not admissible for any purpose in any proceeding.
Thus, when papers or effects are obtained during unreasonable
searches and seizures, or under a search warrant issued without
probable cause and not in accordance with the procedure prescribed,
or in violation of the privacy of communication and
correspondence,
the papers or effects thus obtained are not
admissible if presented
as evidence.

proceedings against the petitioners. These articles are “fruits of the
poisonous tree.” As Judge Learned Hand observed, “Only in case the
prosecution which itself controls the seizing officials, knows that it
cannot profit by their wrong, will the wrong be repressed.” Pending
determination of the legality of such articles, however, they shall
remain in custodia legis, subject to such appropriate disposition as
the corresponding courts may decide. (Alih v. Castro, 151 SCRA 279)
The Moncado ruling ( 80 Phil. 1) that illegally seized documents,
papers and things are admissible in evidence, must be abandoned. The
exclusion of such evidence is the only practical means of enforcing the
constitutional injunction against unreasonable searches and seizures.
The non-exclusionary rule is contrary to the letter and spirit of the
prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. If there is
competent evidence to establish probable cause of the commission of
a given crime by the party against whom the warrant is intended,
then there is no reason why the applicant should not comply with the
constitutional requirements. If he has no such evidence, then it is not
possible for the judge to find that there is a probable cause; hence,
no justification for the issuance of the warrant. The only possible
explanation for the issuance in that case is the necessity of fishing
for evidence of the commission of a crime. Such a fishing expedition
is indicative of the absence of evidence to establish a probable cause.
(Stonehill v. Diokno, 20 SCRA 383)
Search and seizure without warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest
is legal.

Section 12, Rule 126, of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure
provides that a person lawfully arrested may be searched for
dangerous weapons or anything which may be used as proof of the
commission of an offense, without a search warrant.
A lawful arrest may be made without warrant in certain cases
and in any of those cases a search may lawfully be made to find and
seize things connected with the crime as its fruits or as the means by
which it was committed. (Alvero v. Dizon, 76 Phil. 637)

It follows that as the search of the petitioners’ premises
was
violative of the Constitution, all the firearms and
ammunition
taken
from the raided compound are inadmissible in
evidence in any of the

Peace officers may enter the house of an offender who committed
an offense in their presence.

Peace officers are authorized to make arrests without warrant
for breaches of the peace committed in their presence, and may enter
the house of an offender for such purpose, provided the unlawful
conduct is such as to affect the public peace. (U.S. v. Vallejo, et al.,
11 Phil. 193)
Search and seizure of vessels without a search warrant legal.

Search and seizure without search warrant of vessels and aircraft
for violations of the customs laws have been the traditional exception
to the constitutional requirement of a search warrant, because the
vessel can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which
the search warrant must be sought before such warrant could be
secured; hence, it is not practicable to require a search warrant before
such search or seizure can be constitutionally effected. (Roldan, Jr.,
etc. and the Philippine Navy v. Hon. Area, etc., et al., 65 SCRA 336)
Elements of exceeding authority or using unnecessary severity in
executing a search warrant legally procured:

a.

That the offender is a public officer or employee.

b.

That he has legally procured a search warrant.

c.

That he exceeds his authority or uses unnecessary severity in
executing the same.

Example of exceeding authority in executing search warrant.

Art. 130

If in searching a house, the public officer destroys furniture
therein without any justification at all, he is guilty under Article 129,
as having used unnecessary severity in executing the search warrant.

—

Art 130. Searching domicile without witnesses.
The
penalty of arresto mayor in its medium and maximum periods’
shall be imposed upon a public officer or employee who, in
cases where a search is proper, shall search the domicile,
papers, or other belongings of any person, in the absence of the
latter, any member of his family, or in their default, without
the presence of two witnesses residing in the same locality.

Elements:

1.

That the offender is a public officer or employee-,

2.

That he is armed with search warrant legally procured-,

3.

That he searches the domicile, papers or other belongings of any
person.

4.

That the owner, or any member of his family, or two witnesses
residing in the same locality are not present.

“In cases where a search is proper.”

This clause means that the public officer at the time of the search
is armed with a search warrant legally procured.

If the public officer, in executing a search warrant for opium,
seized books, personal letters, and other property having a remote or
no connection with opium, even if he believed or suspected that they
had some relation with opium, such public officer may be held liable
under Article 129. (Uy Kheytin, et al. v. Villareal, et al., 42 Phil. 886)
But the possession of contraband articles, like firearm without
license, is a flagrant violation of the law and the contraband can be
seized without a writ. (Magoncia v. Palacio, 80 Phil. 770)
Example of using unnecessary severity in executing search
warrant.

In violation of domicile under Article 128, the public officer has
no authority to make a search; in searching domicile without witnesses
(Art. 130), the public officer has a search warrant.

“Shall search the domicile, papers, or other belongings of any

The word “search’’ means “to go over or look through for the
purpose of finding something; to examine.” Note that the thing
searched by the offender is the “domicile,” the “papers” or the “other

belongings” of any person. The public officers may examine the papers
for the purpose of finding in those papers something against their
owner; or his other belongings for the same purpose. But as the crime
defined in Article 130 is one of the forms of violation of domicile, the
papers or other belongings must be in the dwelling of their owner at
the time the search is made.

Article 130 does not apply to searches of vehicles or other means
of transportation, because the searches are not made in the dwelling.
Search without warrant under the Tariff and Customs Code does
not include a dwelling house.

The Code authorizes persons having police authority under
Section 2203 of the Tariff and Customs Code to enter, pass through
or search any land, inclosure, warehouse, store or building, not being
a dwelling house; and also to inspect, search and examine any vessel
or aircraft and any trunk, package, box or envelope or any person on
board, or stop and search and examine any vehicle, beast or person
suspected of holding or conveying any dutiable or prohibited article
introduced into the Philippines contrary to law, without mentioning
the need of a search warrant in said cases. (Sections 2208, 2210
and 2211, Tariff and Customs Code) But in the search of a dwelling
house, the Code provides that said “dwelling house may be entered
and searched only upon warrant issued by a judge or justice of the
peace.” (Papa v. Mago, 22 SCRA 857)
Section 8, Rule 126 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure

neighborhood. This particular amendment to the Rules was made to
conform the provision to the present article and was introduced to
address the confusion brought about by differences in the law as found
in the Rules of Court and the R.P.C. concerning witnesses to a search.

Illegal search of other premises.

Facts: At around 12:20 in the early morning of February 25,
2006, operatives of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group
(CIDG) of the PNP, on the basis of P.P. No. 1017 and G.O. No. 5, raided
the Daily Tribune offices in Manila without a warrant. The raiding
team confiscated news stories by reporters, documents, pictures, and
mock-ups of the Saturday issue. The search was conducted in the
absence of any official of the Daily Tribune except the security guard
of the building. Policemen from Camp Crame in Quezon City were
stationed inside the editorial and business offices of the newspaper
while policemen from the Manila Police District were stationed
outside the building.

Held: The search is illegal. Rule 126 of The Revised Rules of
Criminal Procedure lays down the steps in the conduct of search
and seizure. Section 4 requires that a search warrant be issued
upon probable cause in connection with one specific offence to be
determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or
affirmation of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce.
Section 8 mandates that the search of a house, room, or any other
premise be made in the presence of the lawful occupant thereof or any
member of his family or in the absence of the latter, in the presence
of two witnesses of sufficient age and discretion residing in the same
locality. And Section 9 states that the warrant must direct that it be
served in the daytime, unless the property is on the person or in the
place ordered to be searched, in which case a direction may be inserted
that it be served at any time of the day or night. All these rules were
violated by the CIDG operatives. (Cacho-Olivares v. Ermita, G.R. No.
171409, May 3, 2006)

This provision is consistent with the present article. As
previously worded, no search of a house shall be made except in
the presence of at least one competent witness, a

Art. 131. Prohibition, interruption, and dissolution of
peaceful meetings. The penalty of prision correctional in
its minimum period10 shall be imposed upon any public officer
or employee who, without legal ground, shall prohibit or
interrupt the holding of a peaceful meeting, or shall dissolve
the same.

—

The same penalty shall be imposed upon any public
officer or employee who shall hinder any person from joining
any lawful association or from attending any of its meetings.
The same penalty shall be imposed upon any public
officer or employee who shall prohibit or hinder any person
from addressing, either alone or together with others, any
petition to the authorities for the correction of abuses or
redress of grievances.

What are the acts punished in connection with peaceful meetings,
associations, and petitions?

1.

By prohibiting or by interrupting, without legal ground, the
holding of a peaceful meeting, or by dissolving the same.

2.

By hindering any person from joining any lawful association or
from attending any of its meetings.

3-

By prohibiting or hindering any person from addressing, either
alone or together with others, any petition to the authorities for
the correction of abuses or redress of grievances.

Elements common to the three acts punishable:
1. That the offender is a public officer or employee; and
2. That he performs any of the acts mentioned above.
"‘See Appendix "A" Table of Penalties, No. 11.
90

Only a public officer or employee can commit this crime. If the

offender is a private individual, the crime is disturbance of public
order defined in Article 153.

To commit the crime defined in the first paragraph of Article 131,
the public officer must act without legal ground.

Note the phrase“without legal ground” and the word “peaceful"
describing the meeting in the first paragraph of Article 131.
Hence, to constitute a violation of the 1st paragraph of
Article 131, (1) the meeting must be peaceful, and (2) there is no legal
ground for prohibiting, or interrupting or dissolving that meeting.
Right to peaceful meeting is not absolute.

The right to freedom of speech and to peacefully assemble,
though guaranteed by our Constitution, is not absolute, for it may
be regulated in order that it may not be “injurious to the equal
enjoyment of others having equal rights, nor injurious to the right of
the community or society,” and this power may be exercised under the
“police power” of the state, which is the power to prescribe regulations
to promote the good order or safety and general welfare of the people.
Thus, the action taken by the respondent who refused to allow
the use of the kiosk, part of the public plaza, by the members of the
Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, whose tenets and principles are
derogatory to those professed by the Catholics, is not unconstitutional
as an abridgment of the freedom of speech, assembly, and worship,
considering that in view of the proximity of the kiosk to the Catholic
church, such meeting, if allowed, might result in the happening of
untoward incidents and disturbance of peace and order. (Ignacio, et
al. v. Ela, 99 Phil. 347)
When the meeting to be held is not peaceful, there is legal ground
for prohibiting it.

Facts: Petitioner addressed a letter to the Mayor of Manila
requesting permit to hold a public meeting. This meeting was to be
held by the Communist Party. Previously, in public meetings held
by the said Communist Party, seditious speeches were delivered
urging the laboring class to unite in order to be able to overthrow the
government. Petition was denied.
91

Art. 131

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Is the denial of the petition a violation of this Article?
Held: No. Inasmuch as the doctrine and principles advocated by
the Communist Party were highly seditious in that they suggested
and incited rebellious conspiracies and disturbed and obstructed the
lawful authorities in their duties, the denial of the petition to hold
a public meeting is legal. The mayor was justified in prohibiting the
holding of such meeting by refusing to issue a permit for that purpose.
(Evangelista v. Earnshaw, 57 Phil. 255)
The right to peaceably assemble is not absolute and may be
regulated.

Respondent Mayor possesses reasonable discretion to determine
or specify the streets or public places to be used for the assembly in
order to secure convenient use thereof by others and provide adequate
and proper policing to minimize the risks of disorder and maintain
public safety and order. Respondent Mayor has expressly stated
his willingness to grant permits for peaceful assemblies at Plaza
Miranda during Saturdays, Sundays and holidays when they would
not cause unnecessarily great disruption of the normal activities of the
community and has further offered Sunken Gardens as an alternative
to Plaza Miranda as the site of the demonstration sought to be held.
(Navarro v. Villegas, 31 SCRA 371)

It is a settled principle growing out of the nature of well-ordered
civil societies that the exercise of the rights to freedom of speech
and to peaceably assemble and petition the government for redress
of grievances is not absolute for it may be so regulated that it shall
not be injurious to the equal enjoyment of others having equal rights
nor injurious to the rights of the community or society. The power to
regulate the exercise of such other constitutional rights is termed the
sovereign “police power,” which is the power to prescribe regulations
to promote the health, morals, peace, education, good order or safety
and the general welfare of the people. (Gallego v. People, 8 SCRA 813)
There is no legal ground to prohibit the holding of a meeting when
the danger apprehended is not imminent and the evil to be prevented
is not a serious one.

Art. 131

tending to undermine the faith and confidence of the people in their
government and in the duly constituted authorities, which might
threaten breaches of the peace and disruption of public order,” is not
a legal ground for refusing the permit to hold a public meeting for

the purpose of petitioning the government for redress of grievances
by holding an “indignation rally.” To justify suppression of free
speech, there must be reasonable ground to believe that the danger
apprehended is imminent and that the evil to be prevented is a serious
one. (Primicias v. Fugoso, 80 Phil. 71)
Interrupting and dissolving a meeting which is not peaceful.

When a parade was about to be held, Crisanto Evangelista
spoke before the people, raising his fist and accusing the big ones of
persecuting and oppressing them. Then shouts were heard from the
audience saying: “Let us fight them.” Then Ramos shouted, “Let us
fight them until death.” Evangelista and Ramos were arrested. The
Constabulary also dispersed the people by using a water pump.

Held: The act of the Constabulary was proper, the meeting not
being peaceful. (People v. Evangelista, 57 Phil. 372)
The offender must be a stranger, not a participant, in the peaceful
meeting.

Thus, where during the meeting of municipal officials called by
the mayor, the chief of police kept on talking although he had been
asked by the mayor to sit down, and there was a heated exchange of
words among the mayor, a councilor and the chief of police, and in
the ensuing confusion, the crowd watching the proceeding dispersed
and the meeting was eventually dissolved, the chief of police is not
guilty under Article 131, but under Article 287, for unjust vexation.
(People v. Calera and Cantela, CA., 45 O.G. 2576)

Interrupting and dissolving the meeting of municipal council by a
public officer is a crime against a legislative body, not punished
under Article 131.

Thus, the fact “that there is a reasonable ground to believe,
basing upon previous utterances and upon the fact that passions
remain bitter and high, that similar speeches will be delivered

Nobody has the right to dissolve through violence, the meeting
of a municipal council under the pretext of lack of notice to some
members of the council, which was not apparent. Any stranger,
even if he be the municipal president himself or the chief of police
must respect that meeting. The disturbance or interruption and the

consequent dissolution of the meeting of the municipal council is a
violation of Section 1 of Act No. 1755, which is similar to Articles 143
and 144 of the R.P.C. (People v. Alipit, et al., 44 Phil. 910)

Art. 132. Interruption of religious worship.

be imposed upon any public officer or employee who shall

Art. 131

Note: The case of People v. Calera and Cantela, supra, involves
a meeting of municipal officials, not of the municipal council.
The person talking on prohibited subject at public meeting contrary
to agreement that no speaker should touch on politics may be
stopped.
Thus, where on the occasion of the celebration of the anniversary
of the Commonwealth, a public meeting was held and the speakers in
that meeting were enjoined beforehand not to talk about politics but
when the offended party spoke, he attacked the mayor, saying that he
should not be reelected, the mayor who ordered that the offended party
should suspend his speech is not liable for interrupting a peaceful
meeting, even if confusion ensued among the persons in the audience
and they left the meeting. (People v. Yalung, CA-40 O.G., Supp. 11,83)

But stopping the speaker who was attacking certain churches in
public meeting is a violation of Article 131.

The Chief of Police who ordered the speaker in a public meeting
of the Iglesia ni Cristo, then attacking the Catholic and Aglipayan
churches, to stop and fired two shots in the air which dispersed the
crowd and stopped the meeting, is liable under Article 131. (People
v. Reyes, et al., CA G.R. No. 13633-R, July 27, 1955)

— Crimes

against religious worship

What are the crimes against religious worship?

They are:
1.

Interruption of religious worship. (Art. 132)

2.

Offending the religious feelings. (Art. 133)

—

If the crime shall have been committed with violence or

threats, the penalty shall be prision correccional in its medium
and maximum periods.11

Elements:

1.

That the offender is a public officer or employee.

2.

That religious ceremonies or manifestations of any religion are
about to take place or are going on.

3.

That the offender prevents or disturbs the same.

Circumstances qualifying the offense.

If the crime is committed with violence or threats.
Preventing a religious ceremony that is to take place.

In a barrio chapel, a priest was ready to say mass and a number
of barrio folks were there to hear mass. The barrio lieutenant made an
actual threat on the life of the priest should the latter persist in his
intention to say the mass. As a result, the mass was not celebrated.
Held: The barrio lieutenant was guilty of a violation of Article
132. (See People v. Mejica, CA-GJi. No. 12980-R, December 29, 1955)

Reading of Bible and then attacking certain churches in a public
plaza is not a ceremony or manifestation of a religion, but only a
meeting of a religious sect.

Facts: The Iglesia ni Cristo held a meeting at a public plaza
after securing a permit to do so from the mayor. The meeting started
with some singing, after which the minister of the sect read from the

Bible and then delivered a sermon, in the course of which he attacked
the Catholic and Aglipayan churches. The Chief of Police ordered
his policemen to stop the minister. When the minister refused, the
Chief of Police fired two shots in the air which dispersed the crowd
and stopped the meeting.
Held: The act of the Chief of Police is not a violation of
Article 132, but of Article 131. (People v. Reyes, et al., CA-G.R. No.
13633-R, supra)
But the reading of some verses out of the Bible in a private house
by a group of 10 to 20 persons, adherents of the Methodist Church,
is a religious service. The reason for this ruling is that there is no
provision of law which requires religious service to be conducted
in approved orthodox style in order to merit its protection against
interference and disturbance.
“Persons who meet for the purpose of religious worship, by any
method which is not indecent and unlawful, have a right to do so
without being molested or disturbed.” (Hull v. State, 120 Ind., 153,
cited in U.S. v. Balcorta, 25 Phil. 279)

Art. 133. Offending the religious feelings. —The penalty of
arresto mayor in its maximum period to prision correctional
in its minimum period13 shall be imposed upon anyone who, in
a place devoted to religious worship or during the celebration
of any religious ceremony, shall perform acts notoriously
offensive to the feelings of the faithful.

TITLE TWO
Crimes Against The Fundamental Laws of the State
“In a place devoted to religious worship.”

It would seem that in the phrase “in a place devoted to religious
worship,” it is not necessary that there is a religious ceremony going on
when the offender performs acts notoriously offensive to the feelings
of the faithful. The phrase “during the celebration” is separated by
the word “or” from the phrase “place devoted to religious worship,”
which indicates that the “religious ceremony” need not be celebrated
in a place of worship.
Meaning of religious ceremonies.

Religious ceremonies are those religious acts performed outside
of a church, such as processions and special prayers for burying dead
persons. (Albert)

When the application of the Church of Christ was to hold the
meeting at a public place and the permit expressly stated that the
purpose was to hold a religious rally, what was held on that occasion
was not a religious ceremony, even if a minister was then preaching
(“that Jesus Christ was not God but only a man”). The rally was
attended by persons who are not members of the sect. (People v.
Mandoriao, Jr., CA., 51 O.G. 4619)
“Acts notoriously offensive to the feelings of the faithful.”

The acts must be directed against religious practice or dogma
or ritual for the purpose of ridicule, as mocking or scoffing at or
attempting to damage an object of religious veneration. (Viada; People
v. Baes, 68 Phil. 203)
Examples:
1.

Throwing stone at the minister of the Iglesia ni Cristo
who was preaching or spreading his beliefs before a crowd
notoriously offended the religious feelings of the minister
and of the members of the Iglesia ni Cristo who witnessed
the incident. (People v. Migallos, CA-GJi. No. 13619-R,
August 5, 1955)

2.

Remarks that those who believed that Christ is God are
anti-Christ, that all the members of the Roman Catholic
Church are marked by the demon, and that the Pope is
the Commander of Satan are notoriously offensive to the
feelings of the faithful. (People v. Mandorio, supra)

Elements:

1.

That the acts complained of were performed (1) in a place devoted
to religious worship, or (2) during the celebration of any religious
ceremony.

2.

That the acts must be notoriously offensive to the feelings of the
faithful.

of the faithful.
There must be deliberate intent to hurt the feelings
People v. Gesulga
(CA., 57 O.G. 8494-8496)
Facts: Between 5:30 and 6:00 in the afternoon of January 30, 1967, the
Catholic elements in barrio Gacat, Libagon, Leyte, officiated or conducted
inside the church or chapel, a “barangay,” said to be a religious ceremony
similar to the rosary, which they continued outside with a procession.
The procession had to pass along the barrio road in the middle of which a
Protestant meeting was being held. On account of said meeting, there being
a table on the middle of the road, the procession could not pass through. So,
some of those taking part in the procession took another road, while others
passed under the nearby houses. While the procession was thus passing near
the meeting place, the defendant-appellant placed a picture of the Pope on
the wall of the house of one Vivencia Balaquit and shouted, “This criminal
and devouring beast; these parents are fools for having taught their children
the sign of the cross for that is the big devil himself, troublesome; here again
are the fools of the devouring beast, the Pope,” or words of similar import.

the “Alleluia,’’ singing religious hymns and praying for the repose
of the soul of the dead, is not notoriously offensive to the feelings of
religious persons, provided there was no intent to mock, scoff at, or to
desecrate any religious act or object venerated by people of a particular
religion. Such act may have offended the Roman Catholic priest of
the municipality and some Catholic adherents, but since there was
a permit for the burial in question in the Roman Catholic Cemetery
of that municipality, the religious rites of that sect, to which the
members of the family of the deceased belong, and performed upon
request of the bereaved husband, are not offensive to the feelings of
everybody who professes the Christian religion. (People u. Tengson,
14 CA. Rep. 890)

Art. 133

’

Held: In order to render defendant-appellant liable for the particular
offense charged, it is indispensable that the said utterances were made
when defendant-appellant was actually in the place devoted to religious
worship or in a place where the religious ceremony was being celebrated.
The facts in the present case show not only that the defendant-appellant
was not in said place but in another place, but also that it was the religious
procession that approached the place where he was preaching or delivering a
sermon on matters offensive to the feelings of the faithful Catholics. There is
no evidence that defendant-appellant had purposely deviated from the topic
of his preaching or sermon or that if the procession had not approached his
meeting place, he would not have uttered the words herein complained of,
to evidence his intention deliberately to hurt the feelings of those actually
engaged in the celebration of a religious procession or ceremony.
The accused is acquitted.

Not offensive to religious feelings.
The construction of a fence in front of the chapel, even
though irritating and vexatious to those present in the “pabasa,”
is not “notoriously offensive to the feelings of the faithful.” The
crime committed is only unjust vexation defined and penalized in
Article 287. (People v. Reyes, 60 Phil. 369)
The act of performing burial rites inside a Roman Catholic
Cemetery, in accordance with the rules of practices of the sect called
Chnst is the Answer,” by reading passages from the Bible, chanting
98

Art. 133

While the congregation of the Assembly of God was having its
afternoon services in its chapel, accused who was allegedly drunk
entered with uplifted hands and attempted to grab the song leader
who ran away from him. The other members of the sect also ran out
of the church and the religious services were discontinued, even as
one member held the accused and led him outside the church.

Held: The accused is only guilty of uiyust vexation penalized by
the second paragraph of Article 287 of the R.P.C. (People v. Nanoy,
CA., 69 O.G. 8043)
Offense to feelings is judged from complainant’s point of view.
(1) A Catholic priest filed a complaint against three persons for
causing the funeral of a member of “Church of Christ,” being held in
accordance with the rites of that sect, to pass through the churchyard
fronting the parish church over the opposition of the Catholic priest.

Held: Said facts constitute the offense punished in Article 133.
Whether an act offends the feelings of the Catholics should be viewed
or judged from the latter’s point of view. (People v. Baes, 68 Phil. 203)
(2) While ecumenical service was going on inside the Manila
Cathedral, where the heads of the different protestant mainland
churches and the catholic church were present, Petitioner went to the
center of the aisle, in front of the altar, and suddenly brought out a
placard emblazoned with the word “DAMASO.” Commotion ensued
when petitioner started shouting while inside the church saying
“Bishops, stop involving yourself (sic) in politics.”

Art. 133

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Held-. Petitioner is guilty of the crime of Offending Religious
Feelings under Art. 133 of the R.P.C. Whether or not the act
complained of is offensive to the religious feelings of the Catholics, is
a question of fact which must be judged only according to the feelings
of the Catholics and not those of other faithful ones, for it is possible
that certain acts may offend the feelings of those who profess a
certain religion, while not otherwise offensive to the feelings of those
professing another faith. (People v. Baes, ibid.) The acts of petitioner
were meant to mock, insult, and ridicule those clergy whose beliefs
and principles were diametrically opposed to his own. (Celdran. v.
People, G.R. No. 220127, March 21, 2018)

—

Nature of the crime of rebellion.

—

Art. 134. Rebellion or insurrection' How committed.
The crime of rebellion or insurrection is committed by rising
publicly and taking arms against the Government for the
purpose of removing from the allegiance to said Government
or its laws, the territory of the Republic of the Philippines or
any part thereof, or any body of land, naval, or other armed
forces, or depriving the Chief Executive or the Legislature,
wholly or partially, of any of their powers or prerogatives. (As
amended by RA. No. 6968, approved October 24, 1990)

The crime of rebellion or of inciting it is by nature a crime of
masses, of a multitude. It is a vast movement of men and a complex
net of intrigues and plots. (People v. Almazan, CA., 37 O.G. 1932)
The word “rebellion” evokes, not merely a challenge to the
constituted authorities, but also civil war on a bigger or lesser scale.
(People v. Hernandez, 99 Phil. 515)
In rebellion or insurrection, the Revised Penal Code expressly
declares that there must be a public uprising and the taking up of
arms. (Carino v. People, 7 SCRA 900)
Example:

Elements:
1.

That there be (a) public uprising, and (b) taking arms against
the Government.

Four hundred Sakdals after fighting the Constabulary soldiers
took possession of the municipal building and proclaimed the
independence of the Philippine Republic. The Constabulary forces
suppressed the uprising. (People v. Almazan, 37 O.G. 1932)

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

Art. 134

TITLE THREE

Criminal Law

Crimes Against Public Order

Note: There is public uprising and taking arms against the
government when they fought the Constabulary soldiers. By
proclaiming the Philippine Independence, they removed the locality
under their control from the allegiance to the Government or its laws.
Actual clash of arms with the forces of the Government, not
necessary to convict the accused who is in conspiracy with others
actually taking arms against the Government.
Although the law provides that rebellion is committed by rising
publicly and taking arms against the Government, an actual clash of
arms with the forces of the Government is not absolutely necessary.
Thus, the mere fact that the accused knowingly identified himself
with the Huk organization that was openly fighting to overthrow the
Government was enough to make him guilty of the crime of rebellion.
(People v. Cube, C-A., 46 O.G. 4412; People v. Perez, CA.., G.R. No.
8186-R, June 30, 1954)

Note: Those merely acting as couriers or spies for the rebels are
also guilty of rebellion.
Purpose of the uprising must be shown.

The mere fact that a band of 40 men entered the town and,
after attacking the policemen, kidnapped the municipal president,
secretary and others, without evidence to indicate the motive or
purpose of the accused, does not constitute rebellion. The crime
committed was kidnapping. (U.S. v. Constantino, et al., 2 Phil. 693)
It is not necessary that the purpose of the rebellion be

accomplished.

The crime of rebellion is complete the very moment a group of
rebels rise publicly and take arms against the Government, for the
purpose of overthrowing the same by force. It is not necessary, to
consummate rebellion, that the rebels succeed in overthrowing the
Government. Rising publicly and taking arms against the Government
is the normative element of the offense, while the intent or purpose to
overthrow the Government is the subjective element. (Guevara)

Rebellion distinguished from Treason.
(a)

The levying of war against the Government would
constitute treason when performed to aid the enemy. It
104

Art. 134

would also constitute an adherence to the enemy, giving
him aid and comfort. (U.S. v. Lagnason, 3 Phil. 472)
The levying of war against the Government during
peace time for any of the purposes mentioned in Article
134 is rebellion.
(b)

Rebellion always involves taking up arms against the
Government; treason may be committed by mere adherence
to the enemy giving him aid or comfort.

Giving aid and comfort is not criminal in rebellion.

Appellant was not a member of the Hukbalahap organization
which was engaged in rebellion. He did not take up arms against
the Government, nor did he openly take part in the commission of
the crime of rebellion or insurrection as defined in Article 134 of
the R.P.C. The only acts he was shown to have performed were the
sending or furnishing of cigarettes and food supplies to a Huk leader,
the changing of dollars into pesos for a top-level communist and the
helping of Huks in opening accounts with the bank of which he was
an official.

Held: Unlike in the crime of treason, the act of giving comfort or
moral aid is not criminal in the case of rebellion or insurrection, where
the R.P.C. expressly declares that there must be a public uprising
and the taking up of arms. Appellant is, therefore, absolved from the
charge. (Cariflo v. People, 7 SCRA 900, supra)
Rebellion distinguished from subversion.

Petitioners contend that rebellion is an element of the crime of
subversion. That contention is not correct because subversion, like
treason, is a crime against national security. Rebellion is a crime
against public order.

The petitioners were accused of rebellion for having allegedly
undertaken a public uprising to overthrow the government. In
contrast, they were accused of subversion for allegedly being officers
and ranking members of the Communist Party and similar subversive
groups. (Buscayno v. Military Commission Nos. 1, 2, 6 and 25, 109

omission not punishable in rebellion.
U.S. u. Ravidas, et al.
(4 Phil. 273)

Facts: The only fact disclosed by the evidence adduced in the
case is that Alejo Ravidas knew that there were insurgents in a place
called Manila, within the jurisdiction of the town of Agusan, of which
he was municipal president, and his duty as such president required
him to report this fact to the senior officer of the province, but he
did not do so, nor did he take any steps to pursue or denounce the
insurgents or to protect the people from their probable depredations.
Held: However reproachful the silence of the defendant may be,
it does not in itself constitute the crime of insurrection. Act No. 292
(now Art. 134) defines and specifies the acts which shall be punished
as insurrection, but among those acts, the silence of the defendant is
not enumerated. This silence is not an act; it is, rather, an omission.

When the rebellion, insurrection or coup d’etat shall be under
the command of unknown leaders, any person who in fact directed the

Application of the penalty for rebellion.

any personal motive on their part but merely in pursuance of the
movement to overthrow the duly constituted authorities, would be
rebellion and not murder. (People v. Aquino and Cortez, 108 Phil. 814)

The Hardie Farms in the municipality of Antipolo, province of
Rizal, was raided by Huks, the armed force of the Communist Party
of the Philippines, one of the aims of which is to overthrow by force
of arms the Government of the Philippines. After ransacking the
place and taking therefrom a typewriter and a radio set, as well as
stationery, clothing, foodstuff and various other articles, the raiders
tied the hands of John D. Hardie and his foreman Donald Capuano
and shot them to death, together with Mrs. Hardie.

Benito Cruz admitted having risen to the rank of Huk
Commander and being known as Commander Saling, with 12 men
under him.

Held: Appellants herein are guilty of simple rebellion inasmuch
as the information alleges, and the records show, that the acts imputed
to them were performed as a means to commit the crime of rebellion
and in furtherance thereof. Benito Cruz falls under the first paragraph
of Article 135 of the R.P.C., which prescribes the penalty of prision
mayor (now reclusion perpetua) and a fine not exceeding P20.000,
whereas appellant Paterno Cruz, who merely participated in the
rebellion, comes under the second paragraph of said article, which
prescribes the penalty of prision mayor in its minimum period (now
reclusion temporal). (People v. Cruz, et al., 3 SCRA 217)

Is there a complex crime of rebellion with murder and other common

crimes?

The Supreme Court decided this question in the negative. The
reason for the ruling is stated, as follows:

One of the means by which rebellion may be committed, in the
words of Art(icle] 135, is by “engaging in war against the forces of the
government” and “committing serious violence” in the prosecution of
said “war.” These expressions imply everything that war connotes,
namely: resort to arms, requisition of property and services, collection
of taxes and contributions, restraint of liberty, damage to property,
physical injuries and loss of life, x x x. Being within the purview of
“engaging in war” and “committing serious violence,” said resort
to arms, with the resulting impairment or destruction of life and
property, constitutes not two or more offenses, but only one crime
that of rebellion plain and simple.

—

Inasmuch as the acts specified in Art[icle) 135 constitute one
single crime, it follows necessarily that said acts offer no occasion for
the application of Art[icle] 48, which requires therefor the commission
of, at least, two crimes. A mere participant in the rebellion, who is
not a public officer, should not be placed at a more disadvantageous
position. (People v. Hernandez, et al., 99 Phil. 515)
Any or all of the acts described in Art[icle] 135, when committed
as means to or in furtherance of the subversive ends described in
Art[icle] 134, become absorbed in the crime of rebellion and cannot
be regarded or penalized as distinct crimes in themselves. They are
115

Art. 136

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

part and parcel of the rebellion itself, and can not be considered as
giving rise to separate crimes that, under Art[icle] 48 of the Code,
would constitute a complex one with that of rebellion. Thus, the act
of the rebels in ambushing and firing upon an army patrol constitutes
engaging in combat with loyal troops; taking funds and equipment
from the Provincial Treasury of Laguna is diverting public funds from
their legitimate purpose; and the killings of civilians are instances
of committing serious violence. (People v. Geronimo, 100 Phil. 90)
The Hernandez ruling applied.

Facts: (1) Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, the spouses Rebecco and
Erlinda Panlilio and Gregorio Honasan were charged with the
crime of rebellion with murder and multiple frustrated murder
allegedly committed during the period of the failed coup attempt from
November 26 to December 10, 1990. (2) The Solicitor General claimed
that the petitioners’ case does not fall within the Hernandez ruling
because the information in Hernandez charged murders and other
common crimes committed as a necessary means for the commission
of rebellion, whereas, the information against petitioners charged
murder and frustrated murder committed on the occasion, but not in
the furtherance, of rebellion. Stated otherwise, the Solicitor General
would distinguish between the complex crime arising from an offense
being a necessary means for committing another, which is referred
to as the second clause of Article 8, R.P.C., and is the subject of the
Hernandez ruling, and the compound crime arising from a single act
constituting two or more grave or less grave offenses referred to in
the first clause of the same paragraph, in which Hernandez was not
concerned and to which, therefore, it should not apply. (3) The parties’
oral and written pleas presented the Court with the following options:
(a) abandon the Hernandez doctrine and adopt the view that rebellion
cannot absorb more serious crimes, and under Article 48 of the R.P.C.,
rebellion may properly be complexed with common offenses; (b) hold
Hernandez applicable only to offenses committed in furtherance, or
as a necessary means for the commission of, rebellion, but not to acts
committed in the course of a rebellion which also constitute “common”
crimes of grave or less grave character; (c) maintain Hernandez as
applying to make rebellion absorb all other offenses committed in its
course, whether or not necessary to its commission or in furtherance
thereof.

116

TITLE THREE

Art. 135

Crimes Against Public Order

Held: On the first option, 11 members of the court voted against
abandoning Hernandez. Two members felt that the doctrine should
be re-examined. In the view of the majority, the ruling remains good
law, its substantive and logical bases have withstood all subsequent
challenges and no new ones are presented here persuasive enough
to warrant a complete reversal. This view is reinforced by the fact
that the incumbent President, exercising her powers under the 1986
Freedom Constitution, saw fit to repeal, among others, P.D. No. 942
of the former regime which precisely sought to nullify or neutralize
Hernandez, by enacting a new provision (Art. 142-A) into the R.P.C.
to the effect that “when by reason, or on the occasion, of any of the
crimes penalized in this Chapter (Chapter I ofTitle 3, which includes
rebellion), which constitute offenses upon which graver penalties
are imposed by law are committed, the penalty for the most serious
offense in its maximum period shall be imposed upon the offender.”
(E.O. No. 187, issued June 5, 1987) In thus acting, the President in
effect by legislative fiat, reinstated Hernandez as binding doctrine
with the effect of law. The Court can do no less than accord it the same
recognition, absent any sufficiently powerful reason against so doing.
On the second option, the Court unanimously voted to reject
the theory that Hernandez is, or should be, limited in its application
to offenses committed as a necessary means to the commission of
rebellion and that the ruling should be interpreted as prohibiting the
complexing of rebellion with other common crimes on the occasion,
but not in furtherance, thereof. While four Members of the Court felt
that the proponents’ arguments were not entirely devoid of merit,
the consensus was that they were not sufficient to overcome what
appears to be the real thrust of Hernandez to rule out the complexing
of rebellion with any other offense committed in its course under
either of the aforecited clauses of Article 48 x x x.

The rejection of both options shaped and determined the primary
ruling of the Court, which is that Hernandez remains binding doctrine
operating to prohibit the complexing of rebellion with any other
offense committed on the occasion thereof, either as a means to its
commission or as an unintended effect of an activity that constitutes

rebellion.
Thus, based on the doctrine enunciated in People v. Hernandez,

component or ingredient of rebellion or an act done in furtherance of

Political offense doctrine.
Under the political offense doctrine, “common crimes, perpetrated
in furtherance of a political offense, are divested of their character as
common offenses and assume the political complexion of the main
crime of which they are mere ingredients, and, consequently, cannot
be punished separately from the principal offense, or complexed

TITLE THREE

with the same, to justify the imposition of a graver penalty.” Any
ordinary act assumes a different nature by being absorbed in the
crime of rebellion. Thus, when a killing is committed in furtherance
of rebellion, the killing is not homicide or murder. Rather, the killing
assumes the political complexion of rebellion as its mere ingredient
and must be prosecuted and punished as rebellion alone. (Saturnino
C. Ocampo v. Hon. Ephrem S. Abando, et al., G.R. No. 176830,
February 11, 2014)
Rebellion, and not murder, where killings are politically motivated.

The crime committed is not murder but a political offense which
gives rise to the question as to whether the same falls under the
Anti-Subversion Act or under Articles 134 and 135 of the R.P.C. The
appellant admits that he was a member of the NPA then operating in
the Cagayan area with Ka Daniel as their leader. He asserts that the
NPA is the military arm of the Communist Party of the Philippines.
(Presidential Proclamation No. 1081 [1972]; People v. Hon Simeon
Ferrer, et al., G.R. No. L-32613-14, December 29, 1972) There is no
question likewise that the killing of Apolonio Ragual by the appellant
and his companions who were also members of the NPA upon orders
of Ka Daniel was politically motivated. They suspected Ragual as
an informer of the PC. In fact, after he was killed, they left a letter
and a drawing on the body of Ragual as a warning to others not to
follow his example.

In the case of People v. Agarin, 109 Phil. 430, which was a
prosecution for murder, like the present case, where the accused Huk
member with his companions killed the victim because he was a PC
informer, it was held that the crime committed is simple rebellion
and not murder. (People v. Manglallan, et al., 160 SCRA 116 [1988])
Killing, robbing, etc. for private purposes or profit, without any
political motivation, would be separately punished and would not
be absorbed in the rebellion.

If the killing, robbing, etc., during the rebellion, were done
for private purposes or profit, without any political motivation, the
crimes would be separately punished. Thus, in People v. Geronimo,
et al., 100 Phil. 90, accused was convicted of rebellion and murder,
two separate offenses.

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Political crimes and common crimes, distinguished.
Political crimes are those directly aimed against the political
order, as well as such common crimes as may be committed to achieve
a political purpose. The decisive factor is the intent or motive. If a
crime usually regarded as common, like homicide, is perpetrated for
the purpose of removing from the allegiance “to the Government the
territory of the Philippine Islands or any part thereof,” then said
offense becomes stripped of its “common” complexion, inasmuch as,
being part and parcel of the crime of rebellion, the former acquired
the political character of the latter. (People v. Hernandez, supra)

There is proposal to commit rebellion when the person who has
decided to rise publicly and take arms against the Government for
any of the purposes of rebellion proposes its execution to some other
person or persons.

Art. 136

Art. 136. Conspiracy and proposal to commit coup d’etat,
rebellion or insurrection. The conspiracy and proposal to
commit coup d’etat shall be punished by prision mayor in its
minimum period and a fine which shall not exceed One million
pesos (Pl,000,000).
The conspiracy and proposal to commit rebellion or
insurrection shall be punished respectively, by prision
correctional in its maximum period* and a fine which shall
not exceed One million pesos (Pl,000,000), and by prision
correctional in its medium period7 and a fine not exceeding
Four hundred thousand pesos (P400,000). (As amended by RA.
No. 6968 and RA. No. 10951)

—

Two crimes are defined and penalized in this article.

Conspiracy and proposal to commit rebellion are two different
crimes, namely:
(1)

Conspiracy to commit rebellion, and

(2)

Proposal to commit rebellion.

There is conspiracy to commit rebellion when two or more
persons come to an agreement to rise publicly and take arms against
the Government for any of the purposes of rebellion and decide to
commit it.

Art. 136

Merely agreeing and deciding to rise publicly and take arms against
the Government for the purposes of rebellion or merely proposing
the commission of said acts is already subject to punishment.

Persons merely agreeing and deciding among themselves to
rise publicly and take arms against the Government for the purposes
mentioned in Article 134, without actually rising publicly and
taking arms against the Government, or those merely proposing the
commission of said acts to other persons without actually performing
those overt acts under Article 134, are already subject to punishment.
(People v. Geronimo, 100 Phil. 90)
No conspiracy when there is no agreement and no decision to
commit rebellion.

A witness, who testified for the prosecution in a charge of
conspiracy to commit rebellion, stated that he heard the accused in
their conversation saying:“What a life this is, full of misery, constantly
increasing. When will our wretchedness end?When will the authorities
remedy them? What shall we do?”

Is there a conspiracy?
None. (1) There was no agreement concerning the commission of
rebellion, and (2) there was no decision to commit it. The facts do not
suffice to sustain a conviction of the crime of conspiracy to overthrow
the Government. (U.S. v. Figueras, et al., 2 Phil. 491)
Organizing a group of soldiers, soliciting membership in, and
soliciting funds from the people for, the organization, show
conspiracy to overthrow the Government.

When the object of the offenders in organizing Filipino soldiers,
soliciting various persons to become members of the said organization
which held several meetings, and soliciting funds from the people, is
to overthrow the Government, there is conspiracy to commit rebellion.

Thera was no conspiracy to commit rebellion in the
The fact that some of the accused, like the appellants, had made
and designed flags for the “Sakdalista Party” does not necessarily
show that they did it with the intention of joining an uprising against
the constituted government. (People v. Bautista, et al., CA-G.R. No.
1622-R, January 27, 1938)
The mere fact of giving and rendering speeches favoring
Communism would not make the accused guilty of conspiracy, because
there was no evidence that the hearers of his speeches of propaganda
then and there agreed to rise up in arms for the purpose of obtaining
the overthrow of the democratic government as envisaged by the
principles of Communism. (People v. Hernandez, 11 SCRA 223)

The crime of disloyalty of public officers presupposes the existence
of rebellion by other persons.

Art. 137

—

Art. 137. Disloyalty of public officers or employees. The
penalty of prision correctional in its minimum period' shall
be imposed upon public officers or employees who have failed
to resist a rebellion by all the means in their power, or shall
continue to discharge the duties of their offices under the
control of the rebels or shall accept appointment to office
under them.

Art. 138

Thus, in the case of U.S. v. Ravidas, et al., supra, the accused
could not be held liable even for disloyalty, because there was no
actual rebellion going on in the municipality. There must be rebellion
to be resisted or, at least, the place is under the control of the rebels.
The offender under Article 137 must not be in conspiracy with the
rebels.

The public officer or employee who performs any of the acts of
disloyalty should not be in conspiracy with the rebels; otherwise, he
will be guilty of rebellion, not merely disloyalty, because in conspiracy,
the act of one is the act of all.

The offender must be a public officer or employee. Hence, if a

of rebellion.
Inciting to rebellion distinguished from proposal to commit rebellion.

1.
2.

3.

In both crimes, the offender induces another to commit rebellion.
In proposal, the person who proposes has decided to commit
rebellion; in inciting to rebellion, it is not required that the
offender has decided to commit rebellion.

In proposal, the person who proposes the execution of the crime
uses secret means-, in inciting to rebellion, the act of inciting is
done publicly.

3. To inflict any act of hate or revenge upon the person
or property of any public officer or employee;
4. To commit, for any political or social end, any act of
hate or revenge against private persons or any social class;
and
5. To despoil, for any political or social end, any person,
municipality or province, or the National Government (or the
Government of the United States) of all its property or any
part thereof. (As amended by CA. No. 202)

Elements:

1.
2.

3.

Rebellion should not be committed.

In both proposal and inciting to commit rebellion, the crime of
rebellion should not be actually committed by the persons to whom it
is proposed or who are incited. If they commit the rebellion because of
the proposal or the inciting, the proponent or the one inciting becomes
a principal by inducement in the crime of rebellion, provided that the
requisites of paragraph No. 2 of Article 17 of the R.P.C. are present.

That they employ force, intimidation, or other means outside of

Nature of the crime.

Sedition, in its general sense, is the raising of commotions or
disturbances in the State. (People v. Cabrera, 43 Phil. 64)

Held: What distinguishes sedition from rebellion is not the

at which the uprising aims. The purpose of the Sakdal uprising was
to obtain the independence of certain portions of the territory from
the government and withdrawing it from the authority of the central
government. That is one of the purposes of the uprising in rebellion.
It is not one of the objects of sedition as enumerated in Article 139.
fSee League v. People, 73 Phil. 155)

In both rebellion and sedition, there must be public uprising.
While in rebellion there must be taking up of arms against the
Government; in sedition, it is sufficient that the public uprising is
tumultuous.
While in sedition, the purpose of the offenders may be political

in rebellion, it is always political.

If the purpose of the uprising is not exactly against the

an act of hate or revenge upon the person or property of a public
official, like the town mayor, it is sedition.
People v. Umali
(96 Phil. 185)

Facts: On the eve of the election, at the house of Pasumbal’s father,
then being used as his electoral headquarters, Congressman Umali instructed
Pasumbal to contact the Huks through Commander Abeng so that Punzalan
would be killed. Pasumbal, complying with the order of his Chief (Umali),
went to the mountains which were quite near the town and held a conference
with Commander Abeng. It would seem that Umali and Pasumbal had a
feeling that Punzalan was going to win in the election the next day, and
that his death was the surest way to eliminate him from the electoral fight.

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 139

After waiting for some time, Abeng and his troops numbering about
50, armed with garands and carbines, arrived. Congressman Umali, holding
a revolver, was seen in the company of Huk Commander Torio and about
30 armed men. Then shots were heard. Afterwards they saw Umali and his
companions leave in the direction of Taguan, by way of the railroad tracks.

Held: (The Court] [is] convinced that the principal and main, though

not necessarily the most serious, crime committed here was not rebellion but

rather that of sedition. The purpose of the raid and the act of the raiders in
rising publicly and taking up arms was not exactly against the Government
and for the purpose of doing things defined in Article 134 of the R.P.C. The
raiders did not even attack the Presidencia, the seat of the local Government.
Rather, the object was to attain by means of force, intimidation, etc., one
object, to wit: to inflict an act of hate or revenge upon the person or property
of a public official, namely, Punzalan who was then mayor of Tiaong.

Sedition distinguished from treason.

Treason, in its more general sense, is the “violation by a subject
of his allegiance to his sovereign or liege, lord, or to the supreme
authority of the State.” (Century Dictionary) Sedition, in its more
general sense, is “the raising of commotions or disturbances in the
State.” (U.S. v. Abad, 1 Phil. 437)
Can sedition be committed by one person?

Note the clause in the opening sentence of Article 189, which
says: “The crime of sedition is committed by persons who rise publicly
and tumultuously." In Article 163, the word “tumultuous" is given a
definite meaning. It says that “the disturbance x x x shall be deemed
to be tumultuous if caused by more than three persons who are armed
or provided with means of violence.”
Preventing public officers from freely exercising their functions.
People v. Tahil and Tarson
(52 Phil. 318)

In the evening of the same day, Pasumbal reported to Umali about his
conference with Commander Abeng, saying that the latter was agreeable to
the proposition and even outlined the manner of attack.

Facts: Commander Green, with a group of soldiers, stationed himself
about 50 meters in front of the fort where he found a red flag flying and
demanded the surrender of Datu Tahil, a warrant of arrest having been
issued against him and his followers. He did not receive any reply to his
intimation, and, in turn, a group of armed Moros appeared at the left flank
of the Constabulary soldiers in the act of attacking them, but were repelled.
It was again intimated that Datu Tahil surrender, but again no answer was
received, and then a large group of Moros appeared in an aggressive attitude,
being likewise repelled.

Held: Having resisted the judicial warrant of arrest by means of force
and thereby prevented the officers, charged with the duty of arresting them,
from performing it, Datu Tahil and his men committed the crime of sedition.
Inflicting an act of hate or revenge upon public officers.
People v. Cabrera, et al.
(53 Phil. 64)

Facts: A policeman posted on Calle Real had an encounter with some
constabulary soldiers, resulting in the death of a constabulary private. This
encounter engendered on the part of the constabulary soldiers a desire for
revenge against the police force in Manila. They escaped from the barracks
with their guns and made an attack upon the police force. They fired in the
direction of the intersection of Calles Real and Cabildo, killing a policeman
and a civilian. They also fired upon a passing street car, slaying one and
wounding other innocent passengers. They attacked the Luneta Police Station
and the office of the secret service.
Held: The crime committed is sedition. The object of the uprising was
to inflict an act of hate or revenge upon the persons of the policemen who
were public officers or employees.
The object of the uprising in the case of People v. Cabrera, et al., is
that one stated in paragraph 3 of Article 139. Note also that in sedition, the
offenders need not be private individuals.

The association called “Santa Iglesia," to which the accused belonged,
was organized for the purpose of performing acts of hatred and vengeance
against the authorities and the wealthy people in the town in which were put
in practice and execution acts tending to such political-social ends.
Held: The facts as stated constitute the crime of sedition.

Public uprising and an object of sedition must concur.

no sedition.

They were prosecuted for sedition, allegedly for having
prevented the municipal government from freely exercising its
functions. The prosecution contended that by the very threat of
their presence in the council chamber they imposed their will
upon the municipal authorities. It was held that there was no
sedition, because there was no public and tumultuous uprising.
(U.S. v. Apurado, et al., 7 Phil. 422)

U.S. v. Lapus, et al.
(4 Phil. 148)

The reason for the uprising was that the rich people were loaning money
at usurious terms to their farm laborers, and when the latter were unable
to pay the loan they compelled their children to work for them as servants;
and that since the wealthy landowners continued oppressing the poor, they
had to disturb the town, because the law must be equally applied to the rich
and the poor.

No public uprising

While the municipal council was in session, some 500
residents of the town assembled near the municipal building.
A large number of them crowded into the council chamber and
demanded the dismissal from office of the municipal treasurer,
the secretary and the chief of police, and the substitution in their
places of new officials, because those officials took sides in the
religious differences between residents of the municipality. The
persons who took part were wholly unarmed, except that a few
carried canes. The crowd was fairly orderly and well-behaved.
The council acceded to their wishes and drew up a formal
document, which was signed by the councilors and by several
leaders of the crowd.

“Against private persons or any social class.”

Facts: On the night of June 3, 1902, a band composed of about 400
men, among whom were the accused, armed with guns, revolvers, talibones,
bolos, and clubs, raided the town, firing shots, yelling and frightening
the inhabitants thereof; that some of said band went to the house of the
municipal president, while others raided several houses, taking captive 60
or 70 inhabitants thereof; and that they roamed about the streets of the town
threatening and intimidating the people.

Art. 142

Crimes Against Public Order

There must be an agreement and a decision to rise publicly and
tumultuously to attain any of the objects of sedition.

Thus, an agreement and a decision to attain an object of sedition
without any agreement to rise publicly and tumultuously is not
conspiracy to commit sedition. Such an agreement and decision may
constitute a conspiracy to commit direct assault of the first form (Art.
148), which is not a felony.

There is no proposal to commit sedition.

Article 141 punishes only conspiracy to commit sedition. Hence,
proposal to commit sedition is not punishable.

Art. 142. Inciting to sedition. The penalty of prision

of sedition, should incite others to the accomplishment of any
of the acts which constitute sedition, by means of speeches,
proclamations, writings, emblems, cartoons, banners, or other
representations tending to the same end, or upon any person
or persons who shall utter seditious words or speeches, write,
publish, or circulate scurrilous libels against the Government,
or any of the duly constituted authorities thereof, or which
tend to disturb or obstruct any lawful officer in executing
the functions of his office, or which tend to instigate others

suggest or incite rebellious conspiracies or riots, or which lead
or tend to stir up the people against the lawful authorities or
to disturb the peace of the community, the safety and order

practices. (As amended by CA. No. 202 and RA. No. 10951)

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Different acts of inciting to sedition.

1.

Inciting others to the accomplishment of any of the acts which
constitute sedition by means of speeches, proclamations,
writings, emblems, etc.

2.

Uttering seditious words or speeches which tend to disturb the
public peace.

3.

Writing, publishing, or circulating scurrilous libels against the
Government or any of the duly constituted authorities thereof,
which tend to disturb the public peace.

When the words uttered or speeches delivered or scurrilous libels
published have the tendency to disturb any lawful officer in executing
the functions of office, etc., it is not necessary, to constitute a violation
of Article 142, that the purpose of the offender is to accomplish any of
the objects of sedition. The second part of Article 142, which defines
the other modes of committing the crime of inciting to sedition, does
not require it.

Inciting to sedition to accomplish any of Its objects.

Elements:
1.

2.
3.

That the offender does not take direct part in the crime of
sedition.
That he incites others to the accomplishment of any of the acts
which constitute sedition.
That the inciting is done by means of speeches, proclamations,
writings, emblems, cartoons, banners, or other representations
tending to the same end.

"Should incite others to the accomplishment of any of the acts
which constitute sedition.”

It is not inciting to sedition when it is not proved that the
defendant incited the people to rise publicly and tumultuously in
order to attain any of the ends mentioned in Article 139 (Sedition).

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 142

Uttering seditious words or speeches.

1.

Uttering seditious words
Illustration:

—

The accused, municipal secretary, and another person,
happened to meet in the municipal building of the town of
Pilar, Sorsogon, and there they became engaged in a discussion
regarding the administration of Governor General Wood, which
resulted in the accused shouting a number of times: “The
Filipinos, like myself, must use bolos for cutting off 'Wood's head
for having recommended a bad thing for the Filipinos, for he has
killed our independence.”

Held: The accused uttered seditious words. His conviction
must be sustained. (People v. Perez, 45 Phil. 599)
2.

Uttering seditious speech
Illustration:

—

At a necrological service on the occasion of the death of a
local communist leader, the accused delivered a speech, in the
course of which he criticized the members of the Constabulary,
using words substantially to the following effect: “They
committed a real abuse in seizing the flag. The members of the
Constabulary are bad because they shoot even innocent women,
as it happened in Tayug. In view of this, we ought to be united
to suppress that abuse. Overthrow the present government and
establish our own government, the government of the poor. Use
your whip so that there may be marks on their sides.”
Held: The words used by the accused manifestly tended to
induce the people to resist and use violence against the agents
of the Constabulary and to instigate the poor to cabal and meet
together for unlawful purposes. They also suggested and incited
rebellious conspiracies, thereby tending to stir up the people
against the lawful authorities and to disturb the peace of the
community and the order of the Government. It is not necessary,
in order to be seditious, that the words used should in fact result
in a rising of the people against the constituted authorities. The

law is not aimed merely at actual disturbance, as its purpose
is also to punish utterances which may endanger public order.
(People v. Nabong, 57 Phil. 455)
3.

Writing, publishing or circulating scurrilous libels against the
Government or any of the duly constituted authorities thereof.

Art. 142

3.

They suggest or incite rebellious conspiracies or riots; or

4.

They lead or tend to stir up the people against the lawful
authorities or to disturb the peace of the community, the safety
and order of the Government. (Art. 142, 2nd part)

A theatrical play or drama where the words uttered or speeches
delivered are seditious may be punished under Article 142.

Meaning of the word “scurrilous."

“Scurrilous” means low, vulgar, mean or foul.
Illustration of scurrilous libel:

The accused had his picture taken, making it to appear as if he
were hanging lifeless at the end of a piece of rope suspended from a
tree. He sent copies of the photograph to newspapers and weeklies of
general circulation, with suicide note allegedly written by a fictitious
suicide, Alberto Reveniera, and addressed to the latter’s supposed
wife. The note contained words that he committed suicide because
he was not pleased with the administration of President Roxas; and
that our government is infested with many Hitlers and Mussolinis for
which reason he cannot hold high brows to the world with this dirty
government. He instructed his children to burn pictures of Roxas if
and when they come across them.

Held: The letter is a scurrilous libel against the Government.
Writings which tend to overthrow or undermine the security of
the government or to weaken the confidence of the people in the
government are against the public peace, and are criminal not only
because they tend to incite to a breach of the peace but because they
are conducive to the destruction of the government itself. (Espuelas
v. People, 90 Phil. 524)

Thus, the defendant’s play “Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas,”
exhibited at Teatro Libertad, which tended to instigate others to
cabal and meet together for unlawful purposes and to stir up the
people against the lawful authorities and to disturb the peace of the
community and the safety and order of the government, was held to
be inciting to sedition. (U.S. v. Tolentino, 5 Phil. 682)
Proposal to throw hand grenades In a public place, intended to
cause commotion and disturbance, as an act of hate and revenge
against the police force, is inciting to sedition.
The defendant, during the meeting of the special police under
him, informed the members of the manhandling of some of them by
the members of the police force of Bacolod City and proposed the
throwing of hand grenades in certain places of the City, where no
harm could be done to any person, for the purpose of teaching the
police force of the City a lesson, which was accomplished as planned.
The act was intended to cause commotion and disturbance against
the preservation of peace and order. It was committed as an act of
hate and revenge against the police force.

It was held that the defendant was guilty of inciting to sedition
and illegal possession of hand grenades. (People v. Quimpo, CA., 46
O.G. 3784)

Uttering seditious words or speeches and writing, publishing or
circulating scurrilous libels are punishable, when

—

1.

They tend to disturb or obstruct any lawful officer in executing
the functions of his office; or

2.

They tend to instigate others to cabal and meet together for
unlawful purposes; or

134

Knowingly concealing such evil practices.

This is one of the ways of violating Article 142.
“Knowingly concealing such evil practices” is ordinarily an act
of the accessory after the fact, but under this provision, the act is
treated and punished as that of the principal.

135

Art. 142

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

The use of words, emblems, etc., not performance of act, is punished
in inciting to sedition.

Held: The danger apprehended was not imminent and the
evil to be prevented was not a serious one. (Primicias v. Fugoso,
80 Phil. 71)

Article 142 punishes the use of words, emblems, banners, or
other representations tending to disturb the public peace or to disturb
or obstruct any public officer in executing the functions of his office.

The Mayor was ordered by the Supreme Court in mandamus
proceedings to issue a permit.
(b)

Disturbance or disorder, not necessary in inciting to sedition.

Under the dangerous tendency rule, there is inciting

There are two rules relative to seditious words:

The Clear and Present Danger Rule.

I

Present refers to the time element. It used to be identified
with imminent and immediate danger. The danger must not
only be probable but very likely inevitable.
The clear and present danger rule is applied in this case:
A political party applied for a permit to hold a public
meeting in Manila. The Mayor refused to grant permit. The
refusal of the Mayor to grant permit for the holding of a public
meeting was predicated upon fear that in view of the bitterness
of the speeches expected from the minority men who were fresh
from a political defeat and were smarting with charges of fraud
against those in power, there might be breach of the peace and
of public order.

136

to sedition when the words uttered or published could easily
produce disaffection among the people and a state of feeling
in them incompatible with a disposition to remain loyal to the
Government and obedient to the laws.
Reasons why seditious utterances are prohibited.

The words must be of such a nature that by uttering them
there is a danger of a public uprising and that such danger
should be both clear and imminent.

Under the clear and present danger rule, it is required
that there must be reasonable ground to believe that the danger
apprehended is imminent and that the evil to be prevented is a
serious one. There must be the probability of serious injury to
the State.

The Dangerous Tendency Rule.

If the words used tend to create a danger of public uprising,
then those words could properly be the subject of a penal clause.
(People v. Perez, supra)

It is not necessary, in order to be seditious, that the words used
should in fact result in a rising of the people against the constituted
authorities. The law is not aimed merely at actual disturbance, as
its purpose is also to punish utterances which may endanger public
order. (People v. Nabong, 57 Phil. 455)

(a)

Art. 142

»

Manifestly, the legislature has authority to forbid the advocacy
of a doctrine designed and intended to overthrow the Government
without waiting until there is a present and immediate danger of the
success of the plan advocated. If the State were compelled to wait
until the apprehended danger became certain, then its right to protect
itself would come into being simultaneously with the overthrow of
the Government, when there would be neither prosecuting officers
nor courts for the enforcement of the law. ( Gitlow v. New York, 268

U.S. 652)
Unlawful rumor-mongering and spreading false Information.

It is committed by any person who shall offer, publish, distribute,
circulate and spread rumors, false news and information and gossip,
or cause the publication, distribution, circulation or spreading of the
same, which cause or tend to cause panic, divisive effects among the
people, discredit of or distrust for the duly constituted authorities,
undermine the stability of the Government and the objectives of the
New Society, endanger the public order, or cause damage to the interest
or credit of the State.

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

That the offender who may be any person prevents such meeting
by force or fraud.

Chief of police and mayor who prevented the meeting of the
municipal council are liable under Article 143, when the defect of
the meeting is not manifest and requires an investigation before
its existence can be determined.
People v. Alipit, et al.
(44 Phil. 910)

Facts: The election of the municipal president was contested on the
ground of minority. He yielded the chair to the vice-president. The meeting
of the municipal council presided over by the vice-president was stopped by
the chief of police and the municipal president by arresting the vice-president
and threatening the councilors with arrest if they would continue holding
the meeting.

The councilors then dispersed, leaving the premises.
Held: Any stranger, even if he be the municipal president himself or
the chief of the municipal police, must respect the meeting of the municipal
council presided over by the vice-president and he has no right to dissolve
it through violence under the pretext of lack of notice to some members of
the council, which was not apparent, but required an investigation before it
could be determined.

—

Art. 144. Disturbance of proceedings. The penalty of
arresto mayor2 or a fine from Forty thousand pesos (P40,000)
to Two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000) shall be imposed
upon any person who disturbs the meetings of Congress or
of any of its committees or subcommittees, Constitutional
Commissions or committees or divisions thereof, or of any
provincial board or city or municipal council or board, or in
the presence of any such bodies should behave in such manner
as to interrupt its proceedings or to impair the respect due it.
(As amended by CA. No. 264 and RA. No. 10951)

Elements:

1.

That there be a meeting of Congress or any of its committees or
subcommittees, Constitutional Commissions or committees or
divisions thereof, or of any provincial board or city or municipal
council or board.

2.

That the offender does any of the following acts:

a.

He disturbs any of such meetings.

b.

He behaves while in the presence of any such bodies in such
a manner as to interrupt its proceedings or to impair the
respect due it.

It must be a meeting of a legislative body or of provincial board or
city or municipal council or board which is disturbed.

Thus, where during a meeting of municipal officials called by
the mayor, the chief of police kept on talking although he had been
asked by the mayor to sit down, and there was a heated exchange of
words among the mayor, a councilor and the chief of police, the chief
of police is not guilty of a violation of Article 144, but only of unjust
vexation under Article 287. (People v. Calera,etal., CA., 45 O.G. 2576)

The reason for this ruling is that it was not a meeting of a
municipal council, the chief of police who was not a member of the
council being a participant therein.
The complaint for disturbance of proceedings may be filed by a
member of a legislative body.
The crime defined and penalized under Article 144 of the R.P.C.
is not among those which may not be prosecuted de oficio. Hence,
it may be commenced upon the written complaint of a member of
the Municipal Board the proceedings of which were disturbed or
interrupted although such member was not authorized by the rules
or a resolution of the Board. (People v. Lapid, CA., 59 O.G. 4059)
One who disturbs the proceedings of the National Assembly may
also be punished for contempt by the Assembly.
The implied power to punish for contempt of the National
Assembly is coercive in nature. The power to punish crime is punitive

Acts punishable under Article 145.
1.

Art. 145

That the purpose of the offender is to prevent any member
of the National Assembly from

—

(a)

attending the meetings of the Assembly or of any of
its committees or constitutional commissions, etc.; or

(b)

expressing his opinions; or

(c)

casting his vote.

Note: The offender is any person.
2.

By arresting or searching any member thereof while the National
Assembly is in regular or special session, except in case such
member has committed a crime punishable under the Code by
a penalty higher than prision mayor.

Elements:

That the offender is a public officer or employee;
(2) That he arrests or searches any member of the National
(1)

Assembly;
(3)

That the Assembly, at the time of arrest or search, is in regular
or special session-,

(4)

That the member arrested or searched has not committed a crime
punishable under the Code by a penalty higher than prision
mayor.

“To prevent any member x x x from attending,” etc.

By using force, intimidation, threats, or frauds to prevent
any member of the National Assembly from (1) attending
the meetings of the Assembly or of any of its committees or
subcommittees, constitutional commissions or committees
or divisions thereof, or from (2) expressing his opinions, or
(3) casting his vote.

It is not necessary that a member of the Assembly is actually
prevented from attending the meeting of “the National Assembly,”
or from expressing his opinion or casting his vote. It is sufficient
that the offender, in using force, intimidation, threats, or frauds,
has the purpose to prevent a member of the National Assembly from
exercising any of his such prerogatives.

Elements:

Parliamentary immunity does not protect members of the National
Assembly from responsibility before the legislative body itself.
Parliamentary immunity guarantees the legislator complete
freedom of expression without fear of being made responsible in
criminal or civil actions before the courts or any other forum outside of
the Congressional Hall. But it does not protect him from responsibility

before the legislative body itself whenever his words and conduct are
considered by the latter disorderly or unbecoming of a member thereof.
For unparliamentary conduct, members of Parliament or of
Congress have been, or could be censured, committed to prison,
suspended, even expelled by the votes of their colleagues. (Osmeha,
Jr. v. Pendatun, et al., 109 Phil. 863)
Under the 1987 Constitution.

Chapter Three
ILLEGAL ASSEMBLIES AND ASSOCIATIONS
Art. 146. Illegal assemblies.

The 1987 Constitution exempts member of Congress from arrest,
while the Congress is in session, for all offenses punishable by a
penalty less than prision mayor. It provides:

“A Senator or Member of the House of Representatives
shall, in all offenses punishable by not more than six years
imprisonment, be privileged from arrest while the Congress is
in session. No member shall be questioned nor be held liable in
any other place for any speech or debate in the Congress or in
any committee thereof." (Sec. 11, Art. VI)

Based on the 1987 Constitution, a public officer who arrests
a member of Congress who has committed a crime punishable by
prision mayor (six years and one day to 12 years) is not liable under
Article 145. On the other hand, the R.P.C. provides that a member
of Congress may be arrested without the public officer being liable
under Art. 145 only if the crime committed is punishable by a crime
higher than prision mayor. The penalty next higher to prision
mayor is reclusion temporal (12 years and one day to 20 years).
Thus, while parliamentary immunity under the Constitution covers
crimes committed by members of Congress which are punishable by
imprisonment of six years or less, the immunity under the R.P.C.
would cover crimes punishable by imprisonment of less than 12
years. Considering that the Revised Penal Code cannot expand the
parliamentary immunity granted under the Constitution, then the
parliamentary immunity under this Article is deemed to cover only
crimes punishable with a penalty of six years imprisonment or less.
Note: To be consistent with the 1987 Constitution, the phrase
“by a penalty higher than prision mayor" in Article 145 should be
amended to read: “by the penalty of prision mayor or higher."

144

— The penalty of prision

correctional in its maximum period' to prision mayor in its
medium period shall be imposed upon the organizers or
leaders of any meeting attended by armed persons for the
purpose of committing any of the crimes punishable under this
Code, or of any meeting in which the audience is incited to the
commission of the crime of treason, rebellion or insurrection,
sedition or assault upon a person in authority or his agents.
Persons merely present at such meeting shall suffer the
penalty of arresto mayor,2 unless they are armed, in which
case the penalty shall be prision correctional.2
If any person present at the meeting carries an unlicensed
firearm, it shall be presumed that the purpose of said meeting,
insofar as he is concerned, is to commit acts punishable under
this Code, and he shall be considered a leader or organizer of
the meeting within the purview of the preceding paragraph.

As used in this article, the word “meeting” shall be
understood to include a gathering or group, whether in a fixed
place or moving. (As amended by RA. No. 12)

What are illegal assemblies?
They are:

1.

Any meeting attended by armed persons for the purpose of
committing any of the crimes punishable under the Code.

Requisites:

That there is a meeting, a gathering or group of
persons, whether in a fixed place or moving;

b.

That the meeting is attended by armed persons;

c.

That the purpose of the meeting is to commit any of
the crimes punishable under the Code.

Any meeting in which the audience, whether armed or
not, is incited to the commission of the crime of treason,
rebellion or insurrection, sedition, or assault upon a person
in authority or his agents.

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 146

The unarmed person merely present at the meeting of the first form
of illegal assembly is liable.

If the purpose of the armed persons attending the meeting is

to commit any of the crimes punishable under the R.P.C., does an
unarmed person merely present incur criminal liability?
The last sentence of the first paragraph of Article 146, says:
“Persons merely present at such meeting shall suffer the penalty
of arresto mayor, unless they are armed, in which case the penalty
shall be prision correctional." Hence, the penalty of arresto mayor
is intended for persons present at the meeting who are not armed.
“Any meeting in which the audience Is incited to the commission
of the crime of rebellion, sedition, etc.

Requisites:
a.

That there is a meeting, a gathering or group of
persons, whether in a fixed place or moving;

b.

That the audience, whether armed or not, is incited
to the commission of the crime of treason, rebellion
or insurrection, sedition or direct assault.

Suppose the purpose of the meeting was to incite a group of
persons to commit rebellion or sedition, would it be an illegal assembly
if before any actual inciting could take place the Constabulary soldiers
stopped the meeting and dispersed the people?
Note that the law uses the phrases, “the audience is incited.’

The persons present at the meeting must be armed in the first form
of illegal assembly.

That the audience is actually incited to the commission of any of
the crimes of sedition, rebellion, etc. seems to be a necessary element
of the second form of illegal assembly.

What crime is committed by 40 unarmed persons who gather
together in a meeting for the purpose of committing theft of large
cattle? They do not commit any crime. Note that the persons present
at the meeting must be armed to constitute the first form of illegal
assembly. If at all, they only conspire to commit qualified theft which
is not punishable.

When there is an actual inciting, the act would not be punishable
only as inciting to rebellion or inciting to sedition, because in illegal
assembly “in which the audience is incited to the commission of
rebellion or sedition, the persons liable are the organizers or leaders
of, and persons merely present at, the meeting; whereas, in inciting
to rebellion or to sedition, the person liable is only the one who “shall
incite others” (Art. 138); or “should incite others.” (Art. 142)

But not all the persons present at the meeting of the first form of
illegal assembly must be armed.

Suppose seven of the 40 persons are armed, the rest are not, and
the purpose of the gathering is to commit robbery, must the meeting
be considered an illegal assembly? Yes. The law does not state how
many of the persons attending the meeting must be armed. It is said
that a good number, say, at least, four must be armed.

146

If in a meeting the audience is incited to the commission of
rebellion or sedition, the crimes committed are (1) illegal assembly
as regards: (a) the organizers or leaders; and (b) persons merely
present; and (2) inciting to rebellion or sedition insofar as the one
inciting them is concerned.

Persons liable for Illegal assembly:
1.

The organizers or leaders of the meeting;
147

Art. 146

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Persons merely present at the meeting.
As illegal assembly is a felony, the persons merely present at the
meeting must have a common intent to commit the felony of illegal
assembly. The absence of such intent may exempt the person present
from criminal liability.
2.

Thus, if a person happens to be present at an illegal assembly
out of curiosity, he is not liable.

Responsibility of persons merely present at the meeting:
1.

If they are not armed, the penalty is arresto mayor,

2.

If they carry arms, like bolos or knives, or licensed firearms, the
penalty is prision correctional.

If any person present at the meeting carries an unlicensed firearm:

1.

It is presumed that the purpose of the meeting insofar as he is
concerned, is to commit acts punishable under the Code; and

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 146

Held: Peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made
a crime. The holding of meetings for peaceable political action cannot
be proscribed. Those who assist in the conduct of such meetings
cannot be branded as criminals on that score. The question, if the
rights of free speech and peaceful assembly are not to be preserved,
is not as to the auspices under which the meeting was held but as
to its purpose; not as to the relations of the speakers, but whether
their utterances transcend the bounds of the freedom of speech which
the Constitution protects. If the persons assembling have committed
crimes elsewhere, if they have formed or are engaged in a conspiracy
against the public peace and order, they may be prosecuted for their
conspiracy or other violations of valid laws. But it is a different matter
when the State, instead of prosecuting them for such offenses, seizes
upon mere participation in a peaceable assembly and a lawful public
discussion as the basis for a criminal charge. (David v. Arroyo, G.R.
No. 171396, May 3, 2006)

Public Assembly.

The word “meeting" Includes a gathering or group which is moving.
A gathering or group, whether in a fixed place or moving, is
included in the word "meeting.’’

Peaceable assembly for lawful discussion cannot be made a crime.

Facts: On February 24, 2006, President Gloria Macapagal
Arroyo issued Presidential Proclamation (PP) No. 1017 declaring a
state of national emergency and commanded the Armed Forces of the
Philippines to maintain law and order throughout the Philippines,
and to prevent or suppress all forms of lawless violence as well as
any act of insurrection or rebellion. On the same day, petitioners
Randolf S. David, a professor at the University of the Philippines
and newspaper columnist, and Ronald Llamas, president of party¬
list Akbayan, were arrested without warrants on their way to EDSA
to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of People Power 1 The arresting
officers cited PP No. 1017 as basis of the arrest. Petitioners claim
that PP No. 1017 violates the constitutional guarantee of freedom of
assembly, among others.

“Public assembly” means any rally, demonstration, march,
parade, procession or any other form of mass or concerted action
held in a public place for the purpose of presenting a lawful cause; or
expressing an opinion to the general public on any particular issue;
or protesting or influencing any state of affairs whether political,
economic or social; or petitioning the government for redress of
grievances. (Sec. 3(a))
When written permit required.

A written permit shall be required for any person or persons to
organize and hold a public assembly in a public place.

No permit shall be required if the public assembly shall be done
or made in the following places:
1)

a freedom park duly established by law or ordinance;

2)

private property, in which case only the consent of the
owner or the one entitled to its legal possession is required;

educational institution which shall be subject to the rules
and regulations of said educational institution.

Political meetings or rallies held during any election campaign
period as provided for by law are not covered by the Act. (Sec. 4)
Prohibited act.
The holding of any public assembly by any leader or organizer
without having first secured that written permit where a permit is
required from the office concerned, or the use of such permit for such
purposes in any place other than those set out in said permit shall
constitute a violation of the Act: Provided,however, That no person can
be punished or held criminally liable for participating in or attending
an otherwise peaceful assembly. (Sec. 13)

Revocation of permits to rally may only be made after due
notice and hearing.

i

Art. 147

The wholesale cancellation of all permits to rally is a blatant disregard
of the principle that “freedom of assembly is not to be limited, much
less denied, except on a showing of a clear and present danger of a
substantive evil that the State has a right to prevent.” (Reyes v.
Bagatsing, No. L-65366, November 9, 1983, 125 SCRA 553) Tolerance
is the rule and limitation is the exception. Only upon a showing that
an assembly presents a clear and present danger that the State
may deny the citizens’ right to exercise it. Indeed, respondents
failed to show or convince the Court that the rallyists committed
acts amounting to lawless violence, invasion or rebellion. With the
blanket revocation of permits, the distinction between protected and
unprotected assemblies was eliminated.
Under BP 880, the authority to regulate assemblies and rallies is
lodged with the local government units. They have the power to issue
permits and to revoke such permits after due notice and hearing on
the determination of the presence of clear and present danger. Here,
petitioners were not even notified and heard on the revocation of
their permits. The first time they learned of it was at the time of the
dispersal. Such absence of notice is a fatal defect. When a person’s
right is restricted by government action, it behooves a democratic
government to see to it that the restriction is fair, reasonable, and
according to procedure. (David v. Arroyo, supra)

Facte: Immediately after the issuance of PP No. 1017, President
Gloria Macapagal Arroyo announced the cancellation of all programs
and activities related to the 20th anniversary celebration of Edsa
People Power 1, and revoked the permits to hold rallies issued
earlier by the local governments. Undeterred by the announcements
that rallies and public assemblies would not be allowed, groups of
protesters (members of Kilusang Mayo Uno [KMU] and National
Federation of Labor Unions-Kilusang Mayo Uno [NAFLU-KMUJ),
marched from various parts of Metro Manila with the intention of
converging at the EDSA shrine. Those who were already near the
EDSA site were violently dispersed by huge clusters of anti-riot police.
The well-trained policemen used truncheons, big fiber glass shields,
water cannons, and tear gas to stop and break up the marching groups,
and scatter the massed participants. The same police action was
used against the protesters marching forward to Cubao, Quezon City
and to the corner of Santolan Street and EDSA. That same evening,
hundreds of riot policemen broke up an EDSA celebration rally held
along Ayala Avenue and Paseo de Roxas Street in Makati City.
Held: The dispersal and arrest of the members of KMU and
other protesters is unwarranted. Apparently, their dispersal was
done merely on the basis of Malacanang’s directive canceling all
permits previously issued by local government units. This is arbitrary.

The crime of subversion was first punished under R.A. No. 1700,

Persons liable for illegal association:

Founders, directors and president of the association;

2.

Mere members of the association.

Example of Illegal association:

The Lapiang Sakdalista was declared an illegal association,
because it strived to stir up dissatisfaction among the laboring class,
instigated them to break the laws and led them to bloody riots and
inflamed them to rise up against the government. (People v. Ramos,
CA„ 40 O.G. 2305)
The Lapiang Sakdalista was declared an illegal association by
the Court of Appeals, because it was organized for the purpose of
overthrowing the government by force of arms, which is rebellion, a
crime punishable under the R.P.C.
Illegal association distinguished from illegal assembly.
(a)

In illegal assembly, it is necessary that there is an actual meeting
or assembly of armed persons for the purpose of committing any
of the crimes punishable under the Code, or of individuals who,
although not armed, are incited to the commission of treason,
rebellion, sedition, or assault upon a person in authority or his
agent; in illegal association, it is not necessary that there be an
actual meeting.

Art. 147

In illegal assembly, it is the meeting and attendance at such

forming or organizing and membership in the association that
are punished.

Art. 148

Two ways of committing the crime of direct assaults:

1.

Chapter Four

ASSAULT UPON, AND RESISTANCE
AND DISOBEDIENCE TO, PERSONS
IN AUTHORITY AND THEIR AGENTS

—

Art. 148. Direct assaults. Any person or persons who,
without a public uprising, shall employ force or intimidation
for the attainment of any of the purposes enumerated
in defining the crimes of rebellion and sedition, or shall
attack, employ force, or seriously intimidate or resist any
person in authority or any of his agents, while engaged in
the performance of official duties, or on occasion of such
performance, shall suffer the penalty of prision correccional
in its medium and maximum periods' and a fine not exceeding
Two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000), when the assault is
committed with a weapon or when the offender is a public
officer or employee, or when the offender lays hands upon a
person in authority. If none of these circumstances be present,
the penalty of prision correccional in its minimum period2 and
a fine not exceeding One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000)
shall be imposed. (As amended by RA. No. 10951)

2.

Without public uprising, by employing force or intimidation for
the attainment of any of the purposes enumerated in defining
the crimes of rebellion and sedition.
Without public uprising, by attacking, by employing force, or
by seriously intimidating or seriously resisting any person in
authority or any of his agents, while engaged in the performance
of official duties, or on the occasion of such performance.

Elements of the first form of direct assault:

1.

That the offender employs force or intimidation-,

2.

That the aim of the offender is to attain any of the purposes of the
crime of rebellion or any of the objects in the crime of sedition-,

3.

That there is no public uprising.

Examples of the first form of direct assault:

U.S. v. Dirain
(4 Phil. 541)

Facts: The chief of police, accompanied by four policemen, all armed,
went to the house of the municipal president and compelled him by force to go
to the municipal building, where they kept him for four hours, because their
salaries had been in arrears for some time and they had been unable to secure
payment of them from the president. After the relatives of the president sent
him money sufficient to pay the salaries, he was allowed to depart.
Held: That these facts constitute the commission of the crime charged
in the complaint.

Direct assaults are different from ordinary assault without Intent to
kill or physical injuries under Articles 263 to 266.

Direct assaults are crimes against public order, ordinary assaults
under Articles 263 to 266 are crimes against persons.

Direct assaults are triable by the Court of First Instance (now,
Regional Trial Court). (Villanueva v. Ortiz, 108 Phil. 493; Salabsalo
v. Angcoy, 108 Phil. 649)

There is force in this case; but there is no public uprising. When
the accused, compelled by force the municipal president to go with
them to the municipal building and detained him there, they inflicted
an act of hate or revenge upon a public officer. This is one of the objects
of sedition which the accused aimed to attain.

Direct assault to prevent popular election.
The act of the accused in preventing by force the holding of a
popular election in certain precincts, without public uprising, is direct

assault (of the first form). (See Clarin v. Justice of the Peace, G.R. No.
L-7661, April 30, 1955)
Is it necessary that the offended party in the first form of direct
assault be a person in authority or his agent?

The first part of Article 148 does not seem to require it. If the

aim of the offender is to attain an object of sedition, the offended party
may be a private individual or person belonging to a social class. (See
paragraph No. 4 of Art. 139)

Elements of the second form of direct assault:
1,

2.

4.

5.

That the offender (a) makes an attack, (b) employs force,
(c) makes a serious intimidation, or (d) makes a serious

resistance.
That the person assaulted is a person in authority or his agent.
That at the time of the assault the person in authority or his
agent (a) is engaged in the actual performance of official duties,
or that he is assaulted, (b) by reason of the past performance of
official duties.
That the offender knows that the one he is assaulting is a person
in authority or his agent in the exercise of his duties.
That there is no public uprising.

“Shall attack."

The word ‘‘attack" includes any offensive or antagonistic
movement or action of any kind.
“Employ force."

What degree of force is necessary in direct assault?

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 148

Hitting a policeman in the breast with a fist is not direct assault.

U.S. u. Tabiana
(37 Phil. 515)

Facts: The accused, while being placed under arrest by three policemen,
hit one of them in the breast with his fist. The policemen then seized the
accused by the wrist, whereupon he ceased to resist.
Held: The words in Article 148 relating to the employment of force
appear to have reference to something more dangerous to civil society than
a simple blow with the hands at the moment a party is taken into custody
by a policeman.
Pushing a policeman and giving him fist blows without hitting him
is not direct assault.

Where the appellant had shouted to the offended party (a
policeman) and accused him of knowing very little about investigation,
and while the offended party was taking him to the desk sergeant,
he pushed said offended party and gave him blows with his hands
which, however, he was able to evade, the aggression should not be
considered as an assault but merely as resistance to an agent of a
person in authority. (People v. Reyes, 40 O.G. Supp. 11, 24, cited in
People v. Bustamante, C.A., 52 O.G. 287)
Where the force employed on the agent of a person in authority is
of a serious character, including determination to defy the law and
its representative, the crime committed is direct assault.

Thus, where three American soldiers asked a policeman if he
wanted to fight, and then, without waiting for a reply, seized the latter
by the throat, threw him to the ground, and struck him several blows
with the club which the accused, one of the three soldiers, wrested
from the policeman, it was held that the accused was guilty of the
crime of assaulting a police officer. (U.S. v. Cox, 3 Phil. 140)

If the offended party is only an agent of a person in authority,
the force employed must be of a serious character as to indicate
determination to defy the law and its representative at all hazards.

Where a police officer tried to arrest the accused for violation
of the chicken dung ordinance, and the accused punched the police
officer on his face, particularly on his lip, and then grappled with the
police officer, there was direct assault. (Rivera v. People, GJi. No.

The force employed need not be serious when the offended party
is a person in authority.
U.S. v. Gumban
(39 Phil. 76)

Facts: The accused went to the municipal president and protested to
him that the carabao of his brother was taken to the police station for having
destroyed a planted area owned by Suliano. The police station happened
to be within the zone affected by the quarantine. The municipal president
promised to intervene in the matter and to find out whether the carabao could
be withdrawn from the zone affected by the quarantine. Upon hearing this
statement of the municipal president, the accused gave him a slap on the face
striking his left ear. The municipal president was a person in authority then
in the performance of his official duties, inspecting the quarantine of animals.

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 148

Example of serious resistance.

In the course of a quarrel between A and B, the latter called,

“Police! Police!” and a policeman who went to the scene saw B getting
up. When the policeman was about to arrest A, the latter said: “Don’t

come near, because I will take your life.” As the policeman was
approaching him, A struck him with a knife but was not hit. (U.S. v.
Samonte, 16 Phil. 516)

The Intimidation must be serious.

When the constitutive element of direct assault is intimidation,
it must be serious whether the offended party is an agent only or he
is a person in authority.

Held: Laying hands upon a person in authority while in the performance
of his official duties constitutes direct assault.

Example of serious intimidation.

The reason for the difference in the rule as regards the degree of
force employed when the offended party in direct assault is a person
in authority, is that the penalty is even higher “when the offender
lays hands upon a person in authority.”

Pointing a gun at a military police captain who is in the
performance of his duty constitutes assault upon an agent of person
in authority, because there is serious intimidation. (People v. Diama,
CA., 45 O.G. 838)

The intimidation or resistance must be serious whether the offended
party Is an agent only or he is a person in authority.

It would seem that threatening to give a fist blow, made to a
policeman who was arresting the accused, would not constitute direct
assault by intimidating, because the intimidation is not serious.

The other ways of committing direct assault of the second form
are (1) to seriously intimidate or (2) to seriously resist a person in
authority or any of his agents. Note the word “seriously" describing
the words “intimidate” and “resist.”

The law, with regard to intimidation or resistance as other
constitutive element of assault, expressly requires that they be
serious. (U.S. v. Gumban, 39 Phil. 76)
The resistance must be active.

The resistance may be active or passive. Passive, when the one
who is placed under arrest throws himself on the ground and the
resistance makes it necessary to raise him up or drag him along to jail.

But since the resistance here must be grave, it must be active
resistance.

158

The intimidation must produce its effects immediately.

The intimidation must produce its effect immediately, for if the
threats be of some future evil, the act would not be an assault. (Albert)
Second element — The person assaulted Is a person In authority
or his agent
Article 148, the second part, protects only public officers who are
either persons in authority or their agents. Not every public officer
is at the same time a person in authority or an agent of authority.

Thus, an attack on a clerk in the provincial auditor’s office
by holding his neck and inflicting upon him a fist blow, while the
said clerk was in the performance of his duty, is not direct assault,
because he is neither a person in authority nor an agent of a person
in authority. (People v. Carpizo, 80 Phil. 234)

159

Art. 148

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Who is a person in authority?

Any person directly vested with jurisdiction, whether as an
individual or as a member of some court or governmental corporation,
board, or commission, shall be deemed a person in authority. A
barangay captain and a barangay chairman shall also be deemed a
person in authority. (Art. 152, as amended)

By “directly vested with jurisdiction" is meant “the power or
authority to govern and execute the laws.”
Teachers, professors, and persons charged with the supervision
of public or duly recognized private schools, colleges and universities,
and lawyers in the actual performance of their professional duties
or on the occasion of such performance shall be deemed persons in
authority. (Art. 152, as amended)
Teachers, etc., are persons in authority.

Teachers, professors, and persons charged with the supervision
public
or duly recognized private schools, colleges and universities
of
shall be deemed persons in authority, in applying the provisions of
Articles 148 and 151. (Com. Act No. 578, now part of Art. 152, as
amended by R.A. No. 1978)

For other purposes, such as to increase the penalty by reason
of the aggravating circumstances where a person in authority is
involved, the teachers and professors are not persons in authority.
The status as a person in authority being a matter of law, ignorance
thereof is no excuse.

Complainant was a teacher. She was in her classroom and
engaged in the performance of her duties. The accused therefore knew
that she was a person in authority, as she was so by specific provision
of law. Complainant’s status as a person in authority being a matter
of law and not of fact, ignorance thereof could not excuse the accused.
(Art. 3, Civil Code) This article applies to all kinds of domestic laws,
whether civil or penal (De Luna v. Linatoc, 74 Phil. 15), and whether
substantive or remedial (Zulueta v. Zulueta, 1 Phil. 254) for reason of
expediency, policy and necessity. (People v. Balbar, 21 SCRA 1119)

160

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 148

Attacking a teacher who had Inflicted corporal punishment on a

pupil is direct assault.

The corporal punishment (for instance, slightly slapping)

inflicted by the offended party upon her pupil does not in any way
strip the teacher of her being a person in authority. A teacher in
public elementary school has authority to inflict corporal punishment,
on a pupil if no bodily harm is caused and the punishment inflicted
is moderate, is not dictated by any bad motive, is such as is usual
in the school, and such as the parent of the child might expect that
the child would receive if he did wrong. Such authority which is
inherent to the position of a teacher, especially in grade schools, is a
complement of that old adage “spare the rod and spoil the child.”
(People v. Javier, CA-G.R. No. 6203, October 28, 1940; People v. Padua,
CA., 49 O.G. 156)

—

Reasons why teachers and professors are protected in Articles
148 and 151.

The spirit and purpose behind Commonwealth Act No. 578 is to
give teachers protection, dignity and respect while in the performance
of their official duties. This protection extends not only against pupils
or relatives of pupils, but against all persons who knowingly attack a

teacher while engaged in the performance of his official duties. Respect
for a teacher is required of all persons, whether pupils, parents, or
otherwise, if we are to uphold and enhance the dignity of the teaching
profession which the law similarly enjoins upon all persons for the
sake of the pupils and the profession itself. (People v. Ceprioso, CA.,
52 O.G. 2609)
Who is an agent of a person in authority?

An agent of a person in authority is one who, by direct provision
of law or by election or by appointment by competent authority, is
charged with the maintenance of public order and the protection and
security of life and property, such as a barrio councilman and barrio
policeman and barangay leader, and any person who comes to the
aid of persons in authority. (Art. 152, as amended)

the information. Merely to say that a clerk is an agent of authority is
a conclusion of law. (People v. Carpiso, 80 Phil. 234)
Third element — In the performance of duty or by reason thereof.

The third requisite of the second form of direct assault requires
that at the time such assault or intimidation or resistance is made,
the person in authority or his agent (1) is engaged in the actual
performance of his official duty, or (2) at least that the assault or
intimidation is done by reason of the past performance of said duty.
While engaged in the performance of official duties.

Examples:

complaint of several ladies, reprimanded the accused for the
ungentlemanly behavior during a public dance held in front of
the former’s store, said barrio captain actually performed his
duty of maintaining peace and order, although he was just clad in
an undershirt and only stayed inside his store, the attack made
on his person by the accused on the occasion of the performance
of his official duty constitutes direct assault.

Functions of the person in authority or his agent must be clearly
shown in the information.

Even if it is possible that a particular public officer might be
clothed with functions that bring him under the definition of an agent
of a person in authority, still such functions must be clearly shown in

U.S. v. Baluyot, 40 Phil. 385, where the accused killed the
provincial governor while engaged in the performance of his
official duties. It is a complex crime of direct assault with murder.

elbowed the provincial governor while the latter was going down

the office of the chief of police, producing contusion on the right
side of the body of the governor.

3.

Attacking a special agent of the Manila Railroad Co. even while in
the performance in his duty is not direct assault

person in authority, because his very appointment as special agent
shows that his duties are limited to violations of law which affect the
interests of the said company. Hence, giving a fist blow to such special
agent while in the performance of his duty is only physical injuries.

truck had returned, the policeman had every reason to assume

constitutes direct assault.
But in the following cases, the person in authority was not
attacked while engaged in the performance of official duties:

When a teacher is not in the performance of official duty.
A teacher who goes out of his classroom to talk to a person on
matters not related to the school or his duties is not engaged in the

because the justice of the peace was already acting on the matter.
(U.S. v. Marasigan, 11 Phil. 27)

2.

During a political meeting held by a candidate supported by the
municipal mayor, the accused created a disturbance. The mayor
approached the accused and a personal encounter between the
two ensued. The mayor was injured. It was held that the accused
was not guilty of direct assault, because the mayor approached
the accused, not to maintain order, but to prevent the meeting
from becoming a failure. (People u. Sorrano, CA., 38 O.G. 2243)

3.

The Chief of Police fetched his two daughters, Edna and Elsa,
from a dance party at Poblacion Laurel, Batangas. When their
jeep reached Lagnasan, they were fired upon by the accused, as a
result of which the Chief of Police and Edna were instantaneously
killed. On the charge of murder with direct assault, it was held
that only murder will be considered because the deceased Chief
of Police was not in the performance of official duty. (People v.
Seda, G.R. No. L-44810, May 21, 1984)
The barangay tanod was on his way home when he passed by the
bodega of the Rance couple and only watched when the barangay
captain and kagawad were talking to appellant’s group. He
hid himself when the first shot was fired and then jumped out
of a broken window and ran towards the national road. While
running, appellant shot him, hitting his thigh. Clearly, from his
arrival at the scene of the crime to his departure therefrom, he
was not engaged in the performance of his official duties. Neither
was he attacked on the occasion thereof. (People v. Recto, G.R.
No. 129069, October 17, 2001)

4.

A teacher who went out of his classroom to talk to his creditor
about his unpaid accounts was not engaged in the performance of
his official duties as a teacher. (People v. Jingco, 63 O.G. 4443, May
22, 1967)
Extent of performance of official duties for purposes of direct

assault
A provincial fiscal was travelling to a certain municipality to
investigate a witness in connection with a treason case upon the
instruction of the Solicitor General. On the way, the accused, driving
a service truck, refused to give way to the car in which the fiscal was
riding and even zigzagged in front of the car to obstruct the way to
prevent it from overtaking his truck. The fiscal signalled the truck
to stop, which the accused did. The accused arrogantly refused to
be investigated and to show his driver’s license. He grabbed a rifle,
cocked it and pointed the same to the fiscal.
Held: The fiscal at the time he was seriously intimidated was
in the act of discharging the functions of his office, and, therefore,
in the performance of his official duties. (People v. Francisco, CA.,
48 O.G. 4423)
From the facts of the case, it would seem that the performance of
the official duty of the fiscal includes his travelling to the place where
he was going to conduct an investigation of a certain treason case.

It will be noted, however, that the accused, before the assault,
had committed an offense, a violation of the traffic regulation, for
which he could be investigated. When the fiscal investigated him
and asked him to show his driver’s license, the fiscal was in the
performance of his official duty as a prosecuting officer.

directive of his superiors is considered engaged in the performance
of official duty, and an assault committed against the teacher while
on his way is direct assault upon a person in authority. The duties
of teachers are not limited to the confines of the classroom because
there are duties which are discharged by them outside the classrooms.
(People v. Baladhay, CA., 67 O.G. 4213)
When the persons in authority or their agents descended to matters
which are private in nature, an attack made by one against the other
is not direct assault.

In a special session of the municipal council, while the accused
councilor was making a speech, the offended party, another councilor,
wanted to take the floor and the interruption caused by him was
disliked by the accused who went to his place and pushed down his
shoulder to make him sit. Thereafter, the accused threw upon him
a flurry of blows which caused upon the offended party contusions
and bruises on his face.
Held: At the time the quarrel took place, the two councilors
descended to matters which are of private nature, and at that very
moment they were not performing their duties. While it is true that
the incident took place in a session of the municipal council, the
offended party tried to unreasonably interrupt the accused while the
latter was speaking, thereby provoking the anger of the latter. The
offended party then was not performing his duties as councilor when
he was assaulted. The accused was guilty of less serious physical
injuries only. (People v. Yosoya, CA-G.R. No. 8522-R, May 26, 1955)
When the agent of a person in authority agrees to fight
When the accused challenged a district supervisor of the Bureau
of Public Schools to a fight, for failure of the latter to accommodate
the recommendee of the former for the position of teacher, even if
the district supervisor accepted the challenge, the attack made by
the accused constitutes direct assault, because the character of a
person in authority or his agent is not assumed or laid off at will,
but attaches to him until he ceases to be in office. (Justo v. Court of
Appeals, 99 Phil. 463)

166

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 148

When person in authority or his agent is considered not in the

performance of official duties.
The scope of the respective powers of public officers and their

agents is fixed. If they go beyond it and they violate any recognized
rights of the citizens, then the latter may resist the invasion, especially
when it is clear and manifest. The resistance must be coextensive
with the excess, and should not be greater than what is necessary
to repel the aggression. <3 Groizard, p. 456, cited in People v. Chan
Fook, 42 Phil. 230)
People v. Titos, et al.
(CA., 36 O.G. 54)

Facts: Upon instruction of the municipal president, the creditors having
complained that the accused had not paid for their fishing net, the chief of
police went to the beach where he found the accused in their own boat with the
fishing net, and commanded them to take the net to the municipal building.
Because the accused flatly refused, the chief of police become excited and
chased them and came to blows with one of them as a result of which both
suffered physical injuries.
Held: The chief of police was not exercising the proper functions of his
office in attempting to seize the fishing net from the accused inasmuch as the
municipal president, in instructing hum to do so, exceeded his jurisdiction,
not being clothed with judicial power with regard to the seizure of a disputed
property.

In chasing and in attacking the accused, the chief of police became an
unlawful aggressor and the accused in giving him fist blows merely defended
himself against unlawful aggression coming from the chief of police. The
accused was justified, as he acted in self-defense.
Self-defense in direct assault.

When a person in authority or his agent is the one who provokes
and attacks another person, the latter is entitled to defend himself
and cannot be held liable for assault or resistance nor for physical
injuries, because he acts in legitimate defense. (People v. Carado,
CA-G.R. No. 12778-R, November 11, 1955)
In the following cases, the person in authority or his agent is
considered not in the performance of official duties.
1. A person in authority or his agent who exceeds his power
or acts without authority, is not in the exercise of the functions of his
167

Art. 148

office. (People v. Hernandez, 59 Phil. 343; People v. Garcia, et al., 38
O.G. 94; People u. Titos, et al., supra)
When the agent of authority makes unnecessary use of force
or violence to make him respected, he goes beyond the limits of his
powers and from that moment, he acts as a private person. (People v.
Dumo, et al., CA., 40 O.G. Supp. 5, 58)
2. When the offender and the offended party, who are both
persons in authority or their agents, descend to matters which are
private in nature, the principle of authority is not violated. (People
v. Yosoya, supra)
In any of these instances, if the person in authority or his agent
is attacked, the crime committed is only physical injuries or homicide,
as the case may be.
Offender and offended party are both persons in authority or their
agents.

An assault upon a person in authority may be committed by
another person in authority as Article 148 makes it an aggravating
circumstance when the offender is a “public officer or employee.”
However, there can be no assault upon or disobedience to one
authority by another when they both contend in the exercise of their
respective duties. When there is an actual conflict of jurisdiction, there
is, properly speaking, no rebellion against the principle of authority,
but an endeavor to enforce the authority which each of the disputants
represent.

Illustration: The chief of police and the lieutenant of the
Constabulary, with their respective men, simultaneously raided a
gambling house. The chief of police contended that he alone should
make the raid. The lieutenant of the Constabulary also claimed that
he had the authority to make the raid. The chief of police attacked the
lieutenant of the Constabulary and inflicted on him physical injuries
while directing his men in the raid. The crime committed by the chief
of police is only physical injuries.
Knowledge of the accused that the victim is a person in authority
or his agent, essential.

The accused assaulting must have knowledge that the offended
party was a person in authority or his agent in the exercise of his

duties, because the accused must have the intention to offend, injure,

or assault the offended party as a person in authority or agent of
authority. (U.S. v. Alvear, et al., 35 Phil. 626; People u. Rellin, 77
Phil. 1038; People v. Villasenor, 35 SCRA 460)
The information must allege such knowledge.

The information was deficient in that it did not allege an

essential element of the crime of direct assault that the accused had
knowledge of or knew the position of authority held by the person

attacked. (People v. Court of the First Instance of Quezon, Br. V, 68
SCRA 305)
It is essential that the accused must have knowledge that the
person attacked was a person in authority or his agent in the exercise
of his duties, because the accused must have the intention to offend,
injure, or assault the offended party as a person in authority or agent
of a person in authority. (People v. Villasefior, 35 SCRA 460 [1970],
People v. Rellin, 72 Phil. 1038 [1947]; US v. Alvear, et al., 35 Phil.
626 [1916])
In Guelos v. People, G.R. No. 177000, June 19, 2017, the Court
held that where the Informations do not allege that the petitioners
knew that the ones they were assaulting were agents of a person in
authority in the exercise of their duty, the establishment in the course
of trial of the fact that the petitioners came to know that the victims
were agents of a person in authority cannot cure the lack of allegation
in the Informations that such fact was known to the accused, which
renders the same defective. Petitioners were found guilty of Homicide,
instead of Direct Assault Upon an Agent of a Person in Authority
with Homicide.
Defendant must have the intention to defy the authorities.
The defendant had obviously, in the heat of the moment, because
of what previously had happened, rushed upstairs and attempted to
force his way into the sanctum of complainant’s dwelling; and on the
stairs when he was blocked by barrio lieutenant Donato Broca, he
forthwith took hold and pulled the latter’s hand causing him to fall
to the ground. Nevertheless under the circumstances, he could not be
presumed to have the intention of defying the authorities challenging,
acting in such a way as to “constitute a danger to civil society” in his
automatic use of force in laying hands upon Broca and pulling him

down. That Broca had fallen on the ground - which defendant might
not have intended is not of much consequence. The fact remains that,
considering the state of mind in which defendant must have found
himself at that moment, and the attendant circumstances, there would
seem to be no intent on his part to ignore, disregard, much less defy
the authority or its agent. Thus, in the absence of those qualifying
circumstances, we choose to extend the benefit of the doubt in favor
of defendant. He was found guilty of resistance, not of direct assault.
(People v. Baesa, C_A., 55 O.G. 10295-10296)
If a person, while holding a weapon and showing it to a policeman
then in the performance of his duty, said, “If you were not a policeman,
I would use this on you,” such person is not liable for direct assault
because he had no intention to defy the authority which the policeman
represented.

-

Disregard of Respect Due to Offended Party on Account of Rank,
Inherent in Direct Assault.

The aggravating circumstance of disregard of rank is inherent
in the charge of assault against a person in authority or an agent
of a person in authority. (People v. Rodil, supra) Thus, it was not
considered an aggravating circumstance in the following cases:
(1) People v. Catacutan, 64 Phil. 107 (1937), where the accused who
killed a corporal, an agent of the authority who was then conducting a
search by virtue of a search warrant, was found by the Court to have
committed the complex crime of homicide and assault upon an agent
of the authority; (2) People v. Lojo, Jr., 52 Phil. 390 (1928) where the
Court found the accused, who ran over a policeman who was signaling
him to stop, guilty of two crimes, homicide and assault upon an agent
of authority; (3) People v. Hernandez, 43 Phil. 104 (1922) where the
court found the accused, who killed a policeman, guilty of the complex
crime of homicide accompanied by assault upon an agent of authority;
and (4) People v. Bangug, 52 Phil. 87 (1928) where the Court held
that two crimes were committed by the accused in the killing of two
constabulary soldiers, murder and assault against agents of authority.
(People v. Lanseta, G.R. No. L-30413, January 22, 1980)
By reason of the performance of duty.

Direct assault is also committed when the person in authority
or his agent is attacked or seriously intimidated “on occasion of such
performance” of official duty.
170

TITLE THREE
Crimea Against Public Order

Art. 148

The phrase “on occasion of such performance” means that the
impelling motive of the attack is the performance of official duty.
The words “on occasion” signify “because” or “by reason” of the past
performance of official duty, even if at the very time of the assault
no official duty was being discharged. (Justo v. Court of Appeals, 99

Phil. 453)
U.S. v. Garcia
(20 Phil. 358)

Facts: The justice of the peace who read the decision he rendered
in a civil suit heard the accused, who was not a party in the case, utter
disrespectful and contemptuous remarks, whereupon he turned to him and
said: “What have you to do with this case, when you are not a party to it?
Please get out of here.” The accused left but when he reached the stairway, he
turned back toward the justice of the peace and said in threatening manner,
“Well see,” and went downstairs. When the justice of the peace started on
his way home, the accused who was waiting for him nearby, followed him
and when he turned to a corner accosted him and attacked him, striking him
with a cane and slapping his face.

Held: The accused committed direct assault, the crime being aggravated
by the fact that he laid hands upon a person in authority.
At the time the justice of the peace was attacked by the accused, the
former was not in the performance of his duty, because he was on the street and
on his way home. But the accused assaulted him by reason of the performance
of his duty, that is, his sending out the accused to preserve the decorum in
his court. Even if the motive of the assault was the fact that the accused did
not agree with the decision of the justice of the peace, the assault was still
by reason of the performance of his duty.

Hence, it is not necessary that the person in authority or his agent
is in the actual performance of his official duty when attacked or
seriously Intimidated.

It is not necessary that the person in authority who was
assaulted was actually performing official duties. The law employs
the phrase “on occasion of such performance” and this has been
interpreted to include cases like this one where the assault was
made “by reason of* the performance of the duty of Judge Teodoro.
The Supreme Court, citing with approval Groizard’s Commentaries
on the Penal Code of 1840 in the case of U.S. v. Saniel, said, “the
authorities and their agents exercise duties by reason of the offices
they fill. The acts they perform in their official capacity may seriously
171

Art. 148

affect persons. Whenever those acts produce resentment in the latter
and they, on this account, make any serious assault, intimidation, or
resistance against such authorities, the crime in question is committed
x x x. If the motives that induced the guilty parties to commit the
assaults are the acts performed by such person in authority or by
his agents, whether such acts immediately preceded the assault or
took place some time prior thereto, the crime is committed on the
occasion of the performance of public official duties and, consequently,
the characteristic elements of atentado (assault) exist.” (People v.
Torrecarion, C.A., 52 O.G. 7644, citing U.S. v. Saniel, 33 Phil. 646)
People v. Hecto
(135SCRA 113)

Facts: Sometime in January or February 1972, the brothers Jesus
and Pedro Hecto slaughtered a carabao, without paying the corresponding
slaughter fee. Upon learning of the brothers’ nonpayment, barangay captain
Catalino Pedrosa asked Jesus to pay the fee. Jesus replied that they could
not yet pay the fee as those who bought meat from them had not paid them
yet. Later, when Pedrosa met the municipal treasurer, the latter told Pedrosa
that he was informed by the Hecto brothers that they had already paid the
fee to Pedrosa. On February 27, 1972, Pedrosa confronted the Hecto brothers
about the false information they gave the municipal treasurer on their alleged
payment of the slaughter fee to him. A heated discussion then ensued and
the Hecto brothers tried to attack Pedrosa. Mrs. Pedrosa was able to pull
her husband away and trouble was averted. On March 24, 1972, on his way
home from a nephew’s house, he was shot by Jesus and Pedro Hecto and
thereafter, stabbed by Marcial Hecto and Roberto Silvano. The trial court
convicted the accused of the complex crime of murder with assault upon a
person in authority.
Held: The accused contends that the trial court erred in convicting
them of the complex crime of murder with assault upon a person in authority.
They pointed out that when the barangay captain was killed, he was not in
actual performance of his official duties. Be that as it may, the fact is, the
attack on the deceased was occasioned by the official duties done by him.
As the barangay captain, it was his duty to enforce the laws and ordinances
within the barangay. If in the enforcement thereof, he incurs the enmity of
the people who thereafter treacherously slew him, the crime committed is
murder with assault upon a person in authority.

When evidence of motive is important In direct assault.

Evidence of motive of the offender is important when the person
in authority or his agent who is attacked or seriously intimidated is
not in the actual performance of his official duty.
172

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 148

Thus, in the cases of U.S. v. Garcia and People v. Torrecarion,
supra, the motive of the accused in assaulting the person in authority
was the performance of the latter’s official duties done before the

assault.
Where injuries were inflicted on a person in authority who was
not then in the actual performance of his official duties, the motive
of the offender assumes importance because if the attack was by
reason of the previous performance of official duties by the person in
authority, the crime would be direct assault; otherwise, it would only
be physical injuries. (People v. Puno, G.R. No. 97471, February 17,
1993, citing People v. Cadag, et al., G.R. No. L-13830, May 31, 1961)

But when a person in authority or his agent is in the actual
performance of his official duty, the motive of the offender is

immaterial.
Thus, in a case where a teacher-nurse, who was about to pierce
an earring hole on the earlobe of a pupil in the school clinic, was hit
twice on the face by the accused, it was held that although the assault
was sparked by the act of the teacher-nurse who had closed a pathway
across her land through which the accused used to pass in going to
and returning from the school and the motive for the offense was a
dispute totally foreign to her educational labors, the crime committed
was direct assault because she was attacked while engaged in the
performance of her official duties. (Sarcepuedes v. People, 90 Phil. 228)
“Without a public uprising.”

This phrase, as used in Article 148, refers to the two forms of
direct assault. Hence, in direct assault of the second form, there should
not be a public uprising.
If there is public and tumultuous uprising, the crime may be
sedition. If the person in authority or his agent who was attacked was
in the performance of his duty, the object of the uprising may be to
prevent him from freely exercising his functions. If the uprising was
by reason of the past performance of his official duty, the object may
be to inflict an act of hate or revenge upon the person or property of
the public officer.

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Indirect assault can be committed only when a direct assault is
also committed.

Article 149 says “on occasion of the commission of any of the
crimes defined in the next preceding article.” (Art. 148) Hence, indirect
assault can be committed only when direct assault is also committed.

Is there a crime of indirect assault, if a private individual, who
is aiding a policeman in making a lawful arrest, is attacked by the
person to be arrested?

It cannot be indirect assault, because the policeman who is
being aided is not a victim of direct assault. The policeman is in the
performance of duty, making an arrest.
Is the crime direct assault?

While it is true that under Section 10, Rule of 113 of the Rules of
Court, every person summoned by an officer making a lawful arrest
shall aid him in the making of such arrest, yet the private individual
in such case is not an agent of a person in authority, because he is not
coming to the aid of a person in authority (a policeman being an agent
of a person in authority under Article 152, paragraph 2). Hence, the
crime is not direct assault, the person attacked not being an agent
of a person in authority.
The offended party in indirect assaults may be private person.

such summons, or being present before any such legislative
or constitutional body or official, refuses to be sworn or
placed under affirmation or to answer any legal inquiry or

possession, when required by them to do so in the exercise
of their functions. The same penalty shall be imposed upon
any person who shall restrain another from attending as a
witness, or who shall induce disobedience to a summons or
refusal to be sworn by any such body or official. (As amended
by CA. No. 52 and RA. No. 10951)

Acts punished as disobedience to Congress or its committee or
Constitutional commission.

5.

By inducing disobedience to a summons or refusal to be sworn

It will be noted that Article 149 states that the use of force or
intimidation must be made “upon any person coming to the aid of the
authorities or their agents.”
A private person who comes to the rescue of an authority or his
agent enjoys the privileges of the latter, and any person who uses
force or intimidation upon such person under the circumstances is
guilty of atentado (assault) under Article 149. (Guevara)

“Refuses, WITHOUT LEGAL EXCUSE, to obey such summons,
x x x or to answer any legal inquiry or to produce any books, papers,
documents, or records in his possession."

The phrase “without legal excuse” in this article indicates that
only disobedience without legal excuse is punishable.
Hence, Article 150 may not apply when the papers or documents
may be used in evidence against the owner thereof, because it would
be equivalent to compelling him to be witness against himself. (Uy
Khaytin v. Villareal, 42 Phil. 886)
“When required by them to do so in the exercise of their functions.”

The testimony of the person summoned must be upon matters
into which Congress has jurisdiction to inquire.
Thus, the investigation of a crime with a view to prepare the
way for a court action does not come under the province of any
committee of the House or Senate for the power to investigate and
prosecute a crime is vested by law in the prosecuting authorities of the
government. But when the investigation is for the purpose of passing
a legislative measure, such investigation comes under the province
of the committee of the House or Senate. (Arnault v. Nazareno, et
al., 87 Phil. 29)
Refusing “to answer any legal inquiry.”

When Arnault refused to divulge the identity of the person to
whom he gave an amount of P440.000, whose identity the Senate
investigating committee believed him to know, the Senate pronounced
him guilty of contempt and ordered his imprisonment until he would
be willing to identify such person. (Arnault v. Nazareno, et al., 87
Phil. 29)
Hence, any of the acts punished by Article 150 may also
constitute contempt of Congress.

The court may take any action not amounting to a release of a

functions, is not impairment of the doctrine of the distribution of
governmental powers.

The fact that a person is a prisoner of the Senate or of the House
does not exclude other departments during his incarceration from
trying or investigating him in matters pertaining to their spheres, in
much the same way that a prisoner by judgment of a court of justice
is not placed beyond the reach of the legislature and the executive to
summon for examination and to allow in relation to the investigation
to go anywhere under guard to get such evidence as the investigator or
the prisoner might deem important. (Arnault v. Pecson, 87 Phil. 418)
Reasons for the provisions of Article 150 and the power of Congress
to punish for contempt.

—

—

The power of inquiry
with process to enforce it
is an
essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative functions.
Experience has shown that mere requests for certain information
are often unavailing and also that information which is volunteered
is not always accurate or complete; so, some means of compulsion is
essential to obtain what is needed. (See Arnault v. Nazareno, et al.,
supra)

Period of imprisonment for contempt during inquiries In aid of
legislation Is not indefinite.

The period of imprisonment under the inherent power of
contempt by the Senate during inquiries in aid of legislation should
only last until the termination of the legislative inquiry under which
the said power is invoked. In Arnault, it was stated that obedience to
its process may be enforced by the Senate Committee if the subject of
investigation before it was within the range of legitimate legislative
inquiry and the proposed testimony called relates to that subject.
Accordingly, as long as there is a legitimate legislative inquiry,
then the inherent power of contempt by the Senate may be properly
exercised. Conversely, once the said legislative inquiry concludes,
the exercise of the inherent power of contempt ceases and there is
no more genuine necessity to penalize the detained witness. (Balag
v. Senate of the Philippines, G.R. No. 234608, July 3, 2018)

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Art. 151. Resistance and disobedience to a person in
authority or the agents of such person. The penalty of arresto
mayor6 and a fine not exceeding One hundred thousand pesos
(P100,000) shall be imposed upon any person who not being
included in the provisions of the preceding articles shall resist
or seriously disobey any person in authority, or the agents
of such person, while engaged in the performance of official

—

duties.
When the disobedience to an agent of a person in
authority is not of a serious nature, the penalty of arresto
menor or a fine ranging from Two thousand pesos (P2,000) to
Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000) shall be imposed upon the
offender. (As amended by RA. No. 10951)

Elements of resistance and serious disobedience (par. 1):
1.

That a person in authority or his agent is engaged in the
performance of official duty or gives a lawful order to the offender.

2.

That the offender resists or seriously disobeys such person in
authority or his agent.

3.

That the act of the offender is not included in the provisions of
Articles 148, 149, and 150.

Concept of the offense of resistance and disobedience.

The juridical conception of the crime of resistance and
disobedience to a person in authority or his agents consists in a
failure to comply with orders directly issued by the authorities in the
exercise of their official duties. Failure to comply with legal provisions
of a general character or with judicial decisions merely declaratory
of rights or obligations, or violations of prohibitory decisions do
not constitute the crime of disobedience to the authorities. (U.S. v.
Ramayrat, 22 Phil. 183)

‘See Appendix “A" Table of Penalties, No. 1.
180

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 151

“While engaged in the performance of official duties.”
The phrase indicates the rule that in the crime of resistance and
disobedience, the person in authority or the agent of such person must
be in the actual performance of his official duties. This is so, because
there can be no resistance or disobedience when there is nothing to
resist or to disobey. But when a person in authority or his agent is in
the performance of his duty or gives an order and the performance of
duty is resisted or the order is disobeyed, then the crime is committed
The disobedience contemplated consists in the failure or refusal to
obey a direct order from the authority or his agent.
U.S. v. Ramayrat
(22 Phil. 183)

Facts: In the writ of execution issued, the justice of the peace directed
the sheriff to place the plaintiff in possession of the land involved in the
complaint and to make return of the writ to the court.
The accused was not willing to deliver to the plaintiff the land as he
was directed to do by the sheriff.

Was the accused guilty of disobedience?
Held: The accused who was in possession of the land may have been
unwilling to deliver it, but such unwillingness does not constitute an act
of disobedience. The disobedience contemplated consists in the failure or
refusal to obey a direct order. A writ of execution issued by the court directing
the sheriff to place the plaintiff in possession of the property held by the
defendant, is not an order addressed to the defendant it is addressed to
the sheriff. The duty of the sheriff in this case was to place the proper person
in possession. Instead of doing so, the sheriff merely ordered the defendant
to deliver the property to the plaintiff.

—

A person cannot be guilty of disobedience to an order which is not
addressed to him.
The accused would have been guilty of the offense had he refused to
surrender possession of the property to the sheriff himself, upon demand
therefor, in order that the sheriff himself might give possession to the person
entitled thereto as indicated in the writ. (Concurring opinion)

The reason for the concurring opinion is that if the sheriff himself gave
the order to the defendant to vacate the premises to comply with the writ of
execution, such order of the sheriff would be a direct order from him to the
defendant.
181

Art. 151

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The accused must have knowledge that the person arresting him
is a person in authority.

Before a person can be held guilty of the crime of resistance or
disobedience to a person in authority or the agent of such person, it
must be shown beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew that
the person he disobeyed or resisted is a person in authority or the
agent of such person who is actually engaged in the performance of
his official duties. (Vytiaco v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. L-20246-48,
April 24, 1967)
Thus, in a case where the accused thought that the persons
arresting him were bandits, since they did not identify themselves
and state beforehand their mission, it was held that his resistance
did not constitute an offense. (U.S. v. Bautista, 31 Phil. 308)

Justified resistance.

The action of the accused in laying his hands on the customs
secret agent, who had no right to make the search, was an adequate
defense to repel the aggression of the latter, who had seized him by
the arm for the purpose of searching him.

The accused was not subject to search because when the
customs authorities permitted him to land in Manila, he ceased to
be a passenger liable to search. (People v. Chan Fook, 42 Phil. 230)
Example of resistance and serious disobedience.

The case of U.S. v. Tabiana, 37 Phil. 515, where the accused
struck the policeman on the breast with a fist when the latter was
arresting the said accused, is an example of resistance and serious

disobedience.

The policeman was in the performance of his duty when he was
arresting the accused. The violent refusal of the accused to be arrested
made him liable under paragraph 1 of Article 151.

Elements of simple disobedience (par. 2).
1.

That an agent of a person in authority is engaged in the
performance of official duty or gives a lawful order to the
offender.

TITLE THREE
Crimea Against Public Order
2.

That the offender disobeys such agent of a person in authority.

3.

That such disobedience is not of a serious nature.

“When the disobedience to an agent of a person In authority.”

In view of the phrase in the second paragraph of Article 151, it
is clear that in simple disobedience, the offended party must be only
an agent of a person in authority.
The act of lying on the road and refusing, despite the order of the
P.C. major, to get out therefrom constitute the crime of simple
disobedience.

It is unquestionable that Major Emiliano Raquidan of the
Philippine Constabulary, was an agent of a person in authority; that
the order he issued for the strikers to clear the road so as to maintain
free passage thereon pertained particularly to his duty as peace officer
to maintain peace and order; and that for disobedience or resistance
to said order committed in his presence he had the right to arrest or
cause the arrest of the offenders.
The defendants-appellants having obstructed the free passage
along the road from the national highway to the plant of the CocaCola in Carlatan, by lying on the road forming roadblocks, Major
Raquidan had authority to order them to clear said road so as to
allow free passage thereon; and defendants-appellants having refused
to obey said order, their arrest was in order. It cannot be said that
because they did nothing but lie on the road they had no criminal
intent to violate the law, for it was the very act of lying on the road
and refusing to get out therefrom as ordered by Major Raquidan so as
not to obstruct the free passage on said road that constitute the crime
of resistance and disobedience to agents of the authorities with which
they are charged. (People v. Macapuno, et al., CA., 58 O.G. 4985)
Note: Each defendant was sentenced to pay a fine of P25.00.
Picketing must be lawful.

R.A. No. 3600, in its Section 2, provides:
“Section 2. It shall be unlawful for any commanding officer
of troop in the Armed Forces of the Philippines or individual
soldier or any member thereof or any peace officer and/or armed
183

182

Art. 151

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

person to bring in, introduce or escort in any manner any person
who seeks to replace strikers, in entering and/or leaving the
premises of a strike area or to work in place of the strikers.
XXX.

Nothing in the Act shall be interpreted to prevent any
commanding officer of troops in the Armed Forces of the
Philippines or any member thereof or any peace officer from
taking any measure necessary to maintain peace and order and/

or protect life and property.”

In the Macapuno case, there was no peaceful picketing. R.A.
does not prevent any peace officer from taking any measure
3600
No.
necessary to maintain peace and order and/or to protect life and

property.
Picketing is a legitimate means of economic coercion if it is
confined to persuasion, if it is free from molestation or threat of physical
injury or annoyance, and if there exists some lawful justification for
its existence. It is lawful if it does not have an immediate tendency to
intimidation of the other party to the controversy or to obstruct free
passage such as the streets afford, consistent with the rights of others
to enjoy the same privilege. (31 Am. Jur. 944-945) However, picketing
carried on with violence, intimidation, or coercion, or so conducted as
to amount to a nuisance, is unlawful. Picketing may be considered a
nuisance if it constitutes an obstruction to the free use of property so
as substantially to interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life
or property, or if it constitutes an unlawful obstruction to the free
passage or use, in the customary manner, of a street. (31 Am. Jur.
955; People v. Macapuno, et al., 1 CA. Rep. 748)

The order must be lawful.
The order given must be lawful; otherwise, the resistance is
justified.

There is nothing in R.A. No. 4136 that authorized the checkpoint¬
manning policemen to order petitioner and his companions to get
out of the vehicle for a vehicle and body search. What triggered the
confrontational stand-off between the police team, on one hand, and
petitioner on the other, was the latter’s refusal to get off the vehicle
for a body and vehicle search juxtaposed by his insistence on a plain
184

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 151

view search only. Petitioner’s act of exercising one’s right against
unreasonable searches to be conducted in the middle of the night
cannot, in context, be equated to disobedience let alone resisting a
lawful order in contemplation of Article 151 of the R.P.C. (Sydeco v.
People, G.R. No. 202692, November 12, 2014)

One who lawfully resists the meddling by a policeman with one’s
private business affairs cannot be convicted of resistance against an
agent of authority. (U.S. v. Panaligan, 14 Phil. 46; People u. Tilos,
CA., 36 O.G. 54)
The disobedience should not be of a serious nature.

If the disobedience to an agent of a person in authority is of
a serious nature, the offender should be punished under the first
paragraph of Article 151.
Direct assault distinguished from resistance or serious disobedience.
(1)

In direct assault, the person in authority or his agent must
be engaged in the performance of official duties or that he is
assaulted by reason thereof-, but in resistance, the person in
authority or his agent must be in actual performance of his
duties.

(2)

Direct assault (second form) is committed in four ways: (a) by
attacking; (b) by employing force; (c) by seriously intimidating;
and (d) by seriously resisting a person in authority or his agent;
resistance or serious disobedience is committed only by resisting
or seriously disobeying a person in authority or his agent.

(3)

In both direct assault by resisting an agent of a person in
authority and resistance against an agent of a person in authority,
there is force employed, but the use of force in resistance is not
so serious, as there is no manifest intention to defy the law and
the officers enforcing it.
The attack or employment of force which gives rise to the
crime of direct assault must be serious and deliberate-, otherwise,
even a case of simple resistance to an arrest, which always
requires the use of force of some kind, would constitute direct
assault and the lesser offense of resistance or disobedience in
186

Art. 151

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Article 151 would entirely disappear.(People v. Cauan, CA-G.R.
No. 540, October 11, 1938)

But when the one resisted is a person in authority, the use
of any kind or degree of force will give rise to direct assault.
If no force is employed by the offender in resisting or
disobeying a person in authority, the crime committed is
resistance or serious disobedience under the first paragraph of
Article 151.
“Shall resist or seriously disobey.”

The word “seriously” in the phrase quoted is not used to describe
resistance, because if the offender seriously resisted a person in
authority or his agent, the crime is direct assault.
When the attack or employment of force is not deliberate, the crime
is only resistance or disobedience.

This is so, because the offender has no intent to ignore, disregard
or defy the authority or his agents.

Thus, in a case where the court issued a writ of injunction,
ordering the accused not to enter the land in dispute, and the sheriff
told him not to enter the land, but the accused, who claimed that he
was the owner of the land, with his right hand on the handle of his
bolo, advanced with rapid strides towards the sheriff, and the chief
of police then present intercepted the accused, grabbed his hands as
he was about to unsheathe his bolo and wrested the bolo from the
accused who was resisting, it was held that the accused was guilty
of simple disobedience and was sentenced to pay a fine of P25.00.
(People v. Bacani, CA., 40 O.G. 981)

In the case of People v. Baesa, C.A., 55 O.G. 10295, where
the accused, in the heat of the moment and under the impulse of
obfuscation, pulled the hand of a barrio lieutenant, causing him to
fall to the ground, it was held that he was guilty of resistance and
serious disobedience under Article 151, not direct assault. The reason
for this ruling is that the employment of force by the accused was
not deliberate.

TITLE THREE
Crimea Against Public Order

of the body, which severely injured the policeman, and it required two
policemen to subdue him, it was held that he was guilty of resistance
and serious disobedience and was sentenced to imprisonment for two
months and one day, plus P200.00 fine. In this case, the attack and
employment of force were not deliberate.

Art. 152. Persons in Authority and Agents of Persons in
Authority Who shall be deemed as such. In applying the
provisions of the preceding and other articles of this Code,
any person directly vested with jurisdiction, whether as
an individual or as a member of some court or government
corporation, board, or commission, shall be deemed a person
in authority. A barangay captain and a barangay chairman
shall also be deemed a person in authority.

—

Any person who, by direct provision of law or by election
by
appointment by competent authority, is charged with
or
the maintenance of public order and the protection and
security of life and property, such as a barrio councilman,
barrio policeman and barangay leader, and any person who
comes to the aid of persons in authority, shall be deemed an
agent of a person in authority.

In applying the provisions of Articles 148 and 151
of this Code, teachers, professors, and persons charged
with the supervision of public or duly recognized private
schools, colleges and universities, and lawyers in the actual
performance of their professional duties or on the occasion
of such performance shall be deemed persons in authority.
(As amended by BR. Big. 873)

A person in authority is one “directly vested with jurisdiction."
By “directly vested with jurisdiction” is meant the power and
authority to govern and execute the laws.

merely emphasizes the application of Articles 148 and 151.

The offender need not be a pupil or the parent of a pupil.

The defense alleged that the appellant cannot be accused of
direct assault upon a person in authority because he is neither a
pupil nor the parent of a pupil in the school where the complainant
was teaching at the time of the attack.

640)

To be an agent of a person in authority, one must be charged with
(1) the maintenance of public order, and (2) the protection and
security of life and property.

Thus, a policeman or a constabulary soldier is an agent of a
person in authority, because he is charged with the maintenance
of public order and the protection and security of life and property.
The municipal treasurer is also such agent of a person in authority,
because in addition to the fact that he is a deputy ex oficio of the
provincial treasurer, a person in authority, he is charged with the
protection and security of government property.

Held: The spirit and purpose behind Commonwealth Act No.
578 is to give teachers protection, dignity and respect while in the
performance of their official duties. This protection extends not only
against pupils or relatives of pupils, but against all persons who
knowingly attack a teacher while engaged in the performance of his
official duties. Respect for a teacher is required of all persons, whether
pupils, parents of pupils, or otherwise, if we are to uphold and enhance
the dignity of the teaching profession which the law similarly enjoins
upon all persons for the sake of the pupils and the profession itself.

was being held, but no attempt was made by the party outside to enter
the house or to disturb the meeting inside by any concerted action,
other than by standing in a large crowd about the doors of the house
in such a way as to disturb the attention of those attending the meeting
inside, it was held that there being only some slight disturbance and
that partisan feeling was running very high at the time, the party
outside the house did not plan a serious disturbance or intend that
one should take place. The accused were found guilty only of alarm
(now punished under Article 155) and were fined P5.00 each. (U.S.
V. Domingo, 19 Phil. 69)
If the act of disturbing or interrupting a meeting or religious
ceremony is not committed by public officers, or if committed by
public officers they are participants therein, Article 153 should be

applied.

Article 153 has reference to Articles 131 and 132, which punish
the same acts if committed by public officers who are not participants
in the meeting or religious worship. Hence, if the act of disturbing
or interrupting a meeting or religious worship is committed by a
private individual, or even by a public officer but he is a participant
in the meeting or religious worship which he disturbs or interrupts,
Article 153, not Article 131 or Article 132, is applicable.

But if the outcry is more or less unconscious outburst which,
although rebellious or seditious in nature, is not intentionally
calculated to induce others to commit rebellion or sedition, it is only
public disorder.
Circumstance qualifying the disturbance or interruption.
The penalty next higher in degree shall be imposed upon persons
causing any disturbance or interruption of a tumultuous character.

Definition of the term “tumultuous.”
The disturbance or interruption shall be deemed to be
tumultuous if caused by more than three persons who are armed or
provided with means of violence.
One who fired a submachine gun to cause disturbance, but inflicted
serious physical injuries on another, may be prosecuted for two
crimes.

The one who fired the submachine gun committed two offenses
(causing serious disturbance in a public place, the people present
becoming panicky and terrified, and serious physical injuries through

reckless imprudence), although they arose from the same act of the
offender. (People v. Bacolod, 89 Phil. 621)

Meaning of “outcry.”

The word ‘‘outcry'’ in this article means to shout subversive or
provocative words tending to stir up the people to obtain by means of
force or violence any of the objects of rebellion or sedition.
Inciting to sedition or rebellion distinguished from public
disorder.
Question: When may an outcry or displaying of emblems or
placards be a crime of inciting to rebellion or a crime of inciting to
sedition, and when may it be considered a simple public disorder
under paragraph 4 of Article 153?

Answer: For an outcry or the displaying of emblems or placards
to constitute inciting to commit rebellion or sedition, it is necessary
that the offender should have done the act with the idea aforethought
of inducing his hearers or readers
to commit the crime of rebellion
or sedition.

The mere possibility of causing such danger or damage is
sufficient. (Albert)
The offender must know that the news is false.

If the offender does not know that the news is false, he is not
liable under this Article, there being no criminal intent on his part.
“Which may endanger the public order,” etc.

If there is no possibility of danger to the public order or of causing
damage to the interest or credit of the State by the publication of the
false news, Article 154 is not applicable.
Example of No. 2:

Defendant distributed leaflets urging the people to disobey
and resist the execution of that portion of the National Defense Act
requiring compulsory military training. He was convicted of inciting
to sedition by the trial court.
Held: The crime is not inciting to sedition. The acts charged
which are subversive in nature fall under paragraph 2 of Article 154.
(People v. Arrogante, CA., 38 O.G. 2974)
RA. No. 248 prohibits the reprinting, reproduction or republication

shall discharge any firearm, rocket, firecracker, or other
explosive calculated to cause alarm or danger;

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 166

Hence, it is the result, not the intent, that counts. The act must
produce alarm or danger as a consequence.

2. Any person who shall instigate or take an active
part in any charivari or other disorderly meeting offensive
to another or prejudicial to public tranquility;
3. Any person who, while wandering about at night
or while engaged in any other nocturnal amusements, shall
disturb the public peace; or
4. Any person who, while intoxicated or otherwise,
shall cause any disturbance or scandal in public places,
provided that the circumstances of the case shall not make
the provisions of Article 153 applicable. (As amended by RA.
No. 10951)

Article 155 does not make any distinction as to the particular place
In the town or public place where the discharge of firearm, rocket,
etc. is effected.

Acts punished as alarms and scandals.

“Charivari," defined.

4.

Discharging any firearm, rocket, firecracker, or other explosive
within any town or public place, calculated to cause (which
produces) alarm or danger.
Instigating or taking an active part in any charivari or other
disorderly meeting offensive to another or prejudicial to public
tranquility.
Disturbing the public peace while wandering about at night or
while engaged in any other nocturnal amusements.
Causing any disturbance or scandal in public places while
intoxicated or otherwise, provided Article 153 is not applicable.

“Shall discharge any firearm.”

Under paragraph No. 1, the discharge of the firearm should not
be aimed at a person; otherwise, the offense would fall under Article
254, punishing discharge of firearm.
"Calculated to cause alarm or danger” should be “which produces
alarm or danger.”

The discharge of any firearm, rocket, etc., in one’s garden or
yard located in the town is punished under Article 155, as long as it
produced alarm or danger.
Is the discharge of firecrackers or rockets during fiestas or festive
occasions covered by paragraph 1 of Article 155?

Viada opined that it is not covered by the provision. (3 Viada,
Codigo Penal, 4th Ed., pp. 711-712)

The term “charivari’ includes a medley of discordant voices, a
mock serenade of discordant noises made on kettles, tins, horns, etc.,
designed to annoy and insult.

Note: The reason for punishing instigating or taking active part
in charivari and other disorderly meeting is to prevent more serious
disorders.
Disturbance of serious nature falls under Article 153.
If the disturbance is of a serious nature, the case will fall under
Article 153, not under paragraph 4 of this article.
The act of a person who hurled a general insult at everybody,
there being 30 persons in the hall, and challenged the owner of the
billiard hall to a fight, causing commotion and disorder so that the
billiard game had to be stopped momentarily, constitutes merely a
violation of Article 155, paragraph 4, not of Article 153. While the
billiard hall is a public place, there was no serious public disorder
171)
caused. (People v. Gangay, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 12,

The phrase “calculated to cause alarm or danger” in paragraph
No. 1 is a wrong translation of the Spanish text which reads “que
produzca alarma o peligro.”

Art 156. Delivering prisoners from jail.

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

— The penalty of

arresto mayor in its maximum period’ to prision correccional
in its minimum period shall be imposed upon any person who
shall remove from any jail or penal establishment any person
confined therein or shall help the escape of such person, by
means of violence, intimidation or bribery. If other means are
used, the penalty of arresto mayor* shall be imposed.
If the escape of the prisoner shall take place outside of
said establishments by taking the guards by surprise, the same
penalties shall be imposed in their minimum period.

Elements:

1.

That there is a person confined in a jail or penal establishment.

2.

That the offender removes therefrom such person, or helps the
escape of such person.

Prisoner may be under detention only.

The person confined may be a mere detention prisoner. Of course,
the prisoner may also be by final judgment.
Hospital or asylum considered extension of jail or prison.

This article applies even if the prisoner is in the hospital or
asylum when he is removed or when the offender helps his escape,
because it is considered as an extension of the penal institution.
(Albert)

Offender Is usually an outsider.

The offense under this article is usually committed by an
outsider who removes from jail any person therein confined or helps
him escape.

It would seem that Article 156 may also apply to an employee
of the penal establishment who helps the escape of a person confined
therein, provided that he does not have the custody or charge of such

person. Article 156 may also apply to a prisoner who helps the escape
of another prisoner. The offender under Article 156 is “any person.”
If the offender is a public officer who had the prisoner in his
custody or charge, he is liable for infidelity in the custody of a prisoner.
(Art. 223)

The guard of the jail, who is off duty, may be held liable for delivering
prisoner from jail.

A policeman assigned to the city jail as a guard, who, while he
was off duty, brought recently released prisoner inside the jail to
substitute for a detention prisoner whom he later on brought out of
jail, returning said prisoner inside the jail about five hours thereafter,
may be held liable for the crime of delivering prisoners from jail as
defined and penalized under Article 156 of the R.P.C. and not for
infidelity in the custody of prisoners defined and penalized under
Article 223. (People v. Del Barrio, et al., CA., 60 O.G. 3908)
Violence, intimidation or bribery is not necessary.

If the accused removed from jail or penal establishment a person
confined therein or helped the latter’s escape by means of violence,
intimidation, or bribery, the penalty is higher. Hence, it is not an
element of the offense.
Employing bribery as a means of removing the prisoner from jail.

It is true that the crime is qualified when the removal or delivery
of the prisoner is done “by means of x x x bribery,” as, for instance,
when the offender bribes the prison guard in order to achieve his
end; and it is obviously true that a qualifying circumstance is an
integral element of the qualified crime. But it will be noted that what
constitutes the qualifying circumstance in Article 156, is the offender's
act of employing bribery (inter alia) as a “means” of removing or
delivering the prisoner from jail, and not the offender’s act of receiving
or agreeing to receive a bribe as a consideration for committing the
offense, which could serve only as a generic aggravating circumstance
under Article 14(11) of the R.P.C. (People v. Del Barrio, et al., CA.,
60 O.G. 3908)

Employment of deceit is not an element of the offense.

The employment of deceit is not an essential or integral element
of the crime of delivery of prisoners from jail as defined in Article 156,
such that when the same is not alleged in the information and duly
proved in evidence, the accused cannot be convicted of said crime.
Nowhere is the employment of deceit made an essential element of
the crime defined in said article. (People v. Del Barrio, et al., supra)

Chapter Six
EVASION OF SERVICE OF SENTENCE
Three kinds of evasion of the service of the sentence.

“By other means."

Is the person, who substituted for a prisoner by taking his place
in jail, liable under Article 156? Yes. The removal of the prisoner from
jail is by other means, that is, by deceit.
A person delivering a prisoner from jail may be held liable as
accessory.

But if the crime committed by the prisoner for which he is
confined or serving sentence is treason, murder, or parricide, the act
of taking the place of the prisoner in the prison is that of an accessory
and he may be held liable as such, because he assists in the escape
of the principal. (Art. 19, par. 3)
Escape of prisoner outside of prison.

If the escape of the prisoner takes place outside of said
establishments by taking the guards by surprise, the penalty is the
minimum period of that prescribed. (Art. 156, par. 2)
Liability of the prisoner who escapes.

If the prisoner removed or whose escape is made possible by the
commission of the crime of delivering prisoner from jail is a detention
prisoner, such prisoner is not criminally liable. A prisoner is criminally
liable for leaving the penal institution only when there is evasion of
the service of his sentence, which can be committed only by a convict
by final judgment.

They are:

1.

2.

Evasion of service of sentence by escaping during the term of
his sentence. (Art. 157)
Evasion of service of sentence on the occasion of disorders. (Art.
158)

3.

conditions of conditional pardon. (Art. 159)

escape shall have taken place by means of unlawful entry,
by breaking doors, windows, gates, walls, roofs, or floors, or
by using picklocks, false keys, disguise, deceit, violence or
intimidation, or through connivance with other convicts or
employees of the penal institution, the penalty shall be prision

Elements:
1.

2.

That the offender is a convict by final judgment.
That he is serving his sentence which consists in deprivation of
liberty.

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

That he evades the service of his sentence by escaping during
the term of his sentence.

The sentence must be “by reason of final judgment”
The crime of evasion of service of sentence can be committed only
by a convict by final judgment. Hence, if the convict escapes within
15 days from the promulgation or notice of the judgment, without
commencing to serve the sentence or without expressly waiving in
writing his right to appeal, he is not liable under Article 157. Detention
prisoners and minor delinquents who escape from confinement are not
liable for evasion of service of sentence. Detention prisoners are not
convicts by final judgment since they are only detained pending the
investigation or the trial of the case against them. Minor delinquents
confined in the reformatory institution are not convicts, because the
sentence is suspended.

If the accused escaped while the sentence of conviction was under
appeal, he is not liable under Article 157, the judgment not having
become final, and this is true even if his appeal was later dismissed
because he had escaped. ( Curiano u. Court of First Instance, G.R. No.
L-8104, April 15, 1955)
Petitioner was convicted of robbery by the CFI of Albay. He
appealed from the decision, but, as he escaped during the pendency
of the appeal, his appeal was dismissed. As a result, he was
prosecuted for evasion of service of sentence and was sentenced to the
corresponding penalty. While petitioner was serving his sentence in
the robbery case, he again escaped from his place of confinement. He
was again prosecuted for evasion of service of sentence, and pleaded
guilty.
The Solicitor General agrees with the claim of petitioner that
the sentence imposed for the first alleged evasion is null and void for
the reason that when he escaped, the decision of the trial court in the
robbery case has not yet become final. The petitioner was sustained.
(Curiano v. CFI, [Unrep.] 96 Phil. 982)

Not applicable to sentence executed by deportation.

The accused was found guilty of a violation of the Opium Law
and was sentenced to be deported. The sentence was executed. After
four months, the convict returned to the Philippines in violation of
202

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 157

the terms of said sentence. Article 157 is not applicable, because the
convict was not sentenced to imprisonment and thereafter broke jail.
In this case, the executive department has its remedy by
enforcing the terms of the sentence again. (U.S. v. Loo Hoe, 36 Phil.
867)

“By escaping during the term of his imprisonment.”

The word “imprisonment” in the phrase quoted is not the correct
translation. The Spanish text uses the phrase “sufriendo privation
de libertad." Hence, it should be “by escaping during the term of his
sentence which consists in deprivation of liberty.”
Meaning of the term “escape.”

Escape in legal parlance and for purposes of Articles 93 and
157 of the R.P.C. means unlawful departure of prisoner from the
limits of his custody. (Del Castillo v. Torrecampo, G.R. No. 139033,
December 18, 2002)

The three prisoners-accused, with neither escort nor guard, were
seen “loitering in the premises of the courthouse” which was about 600
meters from the city jail.
Did the appellants escape?
The term “escape” has been defined as to “flee from; to avoid; to
get out of the way, as to flee to avoid arrest.” (Black’s Law Dictionary,
4th Ed., p. 640) As correctly pointed out by appellee in recommending
the acquittal of these appellants, the established facts belie any escape
or even mere intention to escape; indeed, if escape were the purpose of
the appellants, they certainly would not have loitered in the premises
of the courthouse especially considering its proximity to the city
jail
where they could easily be spotted and apprehended, as they
in fact were. (People v. Lauron, et al., CA., 60 O.G. 4983)

—

—

Article 157 is applicable to sentence of destierro.
Counsel for the accused contends that a person like the accused
evading a sentence of destierro is not criminally liable under the
provisions of the R.P.C., particularly Article 157 of the said Code
for the reason that said Article 157 refers only to persons who are
imprisoned in a penal institution and completely deprived of their
liberty.

TITLE THREE

Art. 158

Crimes Against Public Order

The Solicitor General in his brief says that had the original text
of the R.P.C. been in the English language, then the theory of the
appellant could be upheld. However, it is the Spanish text that is
controlling in case of doubt. The Spanish text of Article 157 in part
reads thus:
“Art. 157. Quebrantamiento de sentencia. Sera castigado
con prision correccional en sus grados medio y maxima el
sentenciado que quebrantare su condena, fugandose mientras
estuviere sufriendo privacion de libertad por sentencia firme;

—

3.

By using picklocks, false keys, disguise, deceit, violence or
intimidation; or

4.

Through connivance with other convicts or employees of the
penal institution.

“Unlawful entry.”
The Spanish text uses the word "escalamiento." Thus, the crime
is qualified if committed by climbing or scaling the wall.

XXX.”
Held: [The Court] agree[s] with the Solicitor General that
inasmuch as the R.P.C. was originally approved and enacted in
Spanish, the Spanish text governs. (People v. Manaba, 58 Phil. 665,
668) It is clear that the word “imprisonment” used in the English text
is a wrong or erroneous translation of the phrase“sufriendo privacion
de libertad” used in the Spanish text. Destierro is a deprivation of
liberty, though partial, in the sense that as in the present case, the
appellant, by his sentence of destierro, was deprived of the liberty to
enter the City of Manila.
In conclusion, we find and hold that the appellant is guilty of
evasion of service of sentence under Article 157 of the R.P.C. (Spanish
text), in that during the period of his sentence of destierro by virtue
of final judgment wherein he was prohibited from entering the City
of Manila, he entered said City. (People v. Abilong, 82 Phil. 174-175)

Violation of penalty of destierro.
The mere fact that, on two occasions, the accused went to the
City to get her pension check, while serving the sentence of destierro
from said City, would not insulate her from criminal liability for
deliberately and willfully evading service of the destierro sentence.
The compelling necessity for funds cannot outweigh considerations of
respect for a final judgment, and is not one of the cases enumerated
in the statute books as basis for exemption from criminal liability.
(People v. Janson, CA., 59 O.G. 4689)

Circumstances qualifying the offense.
If such evasion or escape takes place

—

By means of unlawful entry (this should be “by scaling”);

Art, 158. Evasion of service of sentence on the occasion of

A convict, who shall evade the service of his sentence,
by leaving the penal institution where he shall have been
confined, on the occasion of disorder resulting from a
conflagration, earthquake, explosion, or similar catastrophe,
or during a mutiny in which he has not participated, shall
suffer an increase of one-fifth of the time still remaining to
be served under the original sentence, which in no case shall
exceed six months, if he shall fail to give himself up to the
authorities within forty-eight hours following the issuance
of a proclamation by the Chief Executive announcing the
passing away of such calamity.

The offender must be a convict by final judgment

Although Article 158 is silent, it is required that the convict must
be one by final judgment, because only a convict by final judgment
can “evade the service of his sentence.”
The convict must leave the penal institution.

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Art. 158

These are considerations that more properly belong to the
legislative department, should an amendment to the law be proposed.
They are likewise equitable pleas, which the executive department
could properly entertain in connection with petitions for parole or
pardon of the prisoners. The special allowance for loyalty authorized
by Articles 98 and 158 of the R.P.C. refers to those convicts who,
having evaded the service of their sentences by leaving the penal
institution, give themselves up within two days. As these petitioners
are not in that class, because they have not escaped, they have no
claim to that allowance. For one thing, there is no showing that they
ever had the opportunity to escape, or that having such opportunity,
they had the mettle to take advantage of it or to brave the perils
in connection with a jailbreak. And there is no assurance that had
they successfully run away and regained their precious liberty, they
would have, nevertheless, voluntarily exchanged it later with the
privations of prison life, impelled by that sense of right and loyalty
to the Government, which is sought to be rewarded with the special
allowance. (Artigas Losada v. Acenas, 78 Phil. 228-229)

The lower court directed the release of certain prisoners on
habeas corpus and in support of this action made these observations:

Note: This is the reason why the third element requires that the
convict should have left the penal institution.

“x x x in the opinion of this court, those prisoners who,
having all the chances to escape and did not escape but
remained in their prison cell during the disorder caused by
war have shown more convincingly their loyalty than those
who escaped under the circumstances specifically enumerated
in Article 158 and gave themselves up within 48 hours. After
the executive proclamation for the latter, that is, the prisoners
who escaped might have been persuaded to give themselves
up merely because they could see but a slim chance to avoid
capture inasmuch as the government then was functioning with
all its normal efficiency. And if those who are loyal merely in
times of conflagration, earthquake, explosion and other similar
catastrophe are considered loyal and are for that reason given
in their favor one-fifth reduction of their sentence, with more
reason that those who stayed in their places of confinement
during the war are loyal x x x.”

The prisoner who did not escape from his place of confinement
during the war is not entitled to a special allowance of one-fifth
deduction of the period of his sentence. (Fortuno v. Director of Prisons,
80 Phil. 178)
What is punished Is not the leaving of the penal institution, but the
failure of the convict to give himself up to the authorities within 48
hours after the proclamation announcing the passing away of the
calamity.

Note the fourth element of Article 158 which states the manner
the offense is committed.
Although Article 158 says, “a convict who shall evade the
service of his sentence by leaving the penal institution, such clause
is qualified by another clause, “if he shall fail to give himself up to
the authorities within forty-eight hours x x x.”

If the offender fails to give himself up, he gets an increased penalty.

The penalty is that the accused shall suffer an increase of
one-fifth of the time still remaining to be served under the original
sentence, not to exceed six months.
If the offender gives himself up, he is entitled to a deduction of
one-fifth of his sentence.

If he gives himself up to the authorities within 48 hours, he shall
be entitled to one-fifth deduction of the period of his sentence. (Art. 98)
“Mutiny" in this article implies an organized unlawful resistance to
a superior officer; a sedition; a revolt.

Mutiny implies an organized unlawful resistance to a superior
officer; a sedition; a revolt. (People v. Padilla, CA., 46 O.G. 2151)
Thus, there is no mutiny if the prisoners disarmed the guards
and escaped, because the guards are not their superior officers. In
such case, the prisoners who surrendered to a barrio lieutenant and
then to the police authorities, after slipping away from the escapists,
are not entitled to a reduction of one-fifth of their original sentence.

Such prisoners could be held liable under Article 157 for evasion
of service of sentence.

In the case of People v. Padilla, supra, the accused was not held
liable for evasion of service of sentence under Article 157, because
he acted under the influence of uncontrollable fear of an equal or
greater injury, the escapists having threatened to shoot at whoever
remained in the jail.

Nature of conditional pardon — It is a contract.

A conditional pardon is a contract between the Chief Executive,
who grants the pardon, and the convict, who accepts it. Since it is a
contract, the pardoned convict is bound to fulfill its conditions and
accept all its consequences, not as he chooses, but according to its
strict terms. (People v. Pontillas, 65 Phil. 659)

Art. 159

“If the penalty remitted by the granting of such pardon.”
Illustration:
The accused was sentenced to a penalty of six years and one day
of prision mayor. He served two years, five months and 22 days of
the sentence and was granted conditional pardon. The term remitted
by the pardon is three years, six months and eight days. The law
applicable is the first part of Article 159 which imposes a penalty of
prision. correccional in its minimum period. (People v. Sanares, 62

Phil. 825)
Can the court require the convict to serve the unexpired portion of
his original sentence if it does not exceed six years?

No. Article 159 does not provide that the accused shall serve the
unexpired portion in addition to the penalty of prision correccional
minimum. The remedy is left to the President who has the authority to
recommit him to serve the unexpired portion of his original sentence.
Violation of conditional pardon is a distinct crime.
Violation of conditional pardon is a distinct crime so that
although the crime of abduction, involved in the case in which the
accused was granted conditional pardon, was committed in Cavite,
he should be prosecuted in Rizal where he committed robbery in
violation of the conditional pardon. (People v. Martin, 68 Phil. 122)

The violation of conditional pardon is committed in the place
where the subsequent offense is perpetrated, because by committing
the subsequent offense, he thereby violates the condition that “he
shall not again be found guilty of any crime punishable by the laws

of the Philippines.”

Is violation of conditional pardon a substantive offense?

Violation of conditional pardon is not a substantive offense,
because the penalty imposed for such violation is the unexpired
portion of the punishment in the original sentence.

Dissenting: The dictum of the majority that “violation of a
conditional pardon is not a substantive offense or independent of the
crime for the commission of which the punishment inflicted in the
sentence was remitted by the pardon, because the penalty imposed
210

for such violation is the unexpired portion of the punishment imposed
by the original sentence,” is, I think, incorrect. That may have been
so before the enactment of Article 159 of the R.P.C.; but since that
enactment, it is a substantive offense because the penalty therefor
is no longer necessarily the remitted portion of the sentence, for
when the unexpired portion is less than six years, the convict who
violates the conditions of the pardon shall suffer the penalty of prision
correccional in its minimum period. (Concurring and dissenting
opinion of Justice Ozaeta, People v. Jose, 70 Phil. 623-624)
Condition extends to special laws.

The condition imposed upon the prisoner that he should not
commit another crime, extends to offenses punished by special laws,
like illegal voting under the Election Law. (People v. Coral, 74 Phil.
357)

Offender must be found guilty of subsequent offense before he can
be prosecuted under Article 159.

The phrase in the condition that the offender “shall not again
commit another crime” does not mean merely being charged with an
offense. It is necessary that he be found guilty of the offense.

A convict granted conditional pardon, like the petitioner herein
who is recommitted, must of course be convicted by final judgment of
a court of the subsequent crime or crimes with which he was charged
before the criminal penalty for such subsequent offense(s) can be
imposed upon him. Again, since Article 159 of the R.P.C. defines a
distinct, substantive, felony, the parolee or convict who is regarded
as having violated the provisions thereof must be charged, prosecuted
and convicted by final judgment before he can be made to suffer the
penalty prescribed in Article 159. (Torres v. Gonzales, 152 SCRA 272)
When the penalty remitted is destierro, is the penalty for violation
of the conditional pardon also destierro?

Under Article 159, when the sentence remitted by the conditional
pardon does not exceed six years, the penalty of the grantee who
violates any of the conditions of such pardon is prision correccional
in its minimum period. It is only when the penalty remitted by the
pardon is higher than six years that the convict shall then suffer
211

Art. 159

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

the unexpired portion of his original sentence. Since destierro has a
duration of six months and one day to six years, under no circumstance
may the penalty for violation of the conditional pardon be destierro.
The case of People v. Ponce de Leon, 56 Phil. 386, is not applicable
to a violation of Article 159.
Offender can be arrested and reincarcerated without trial.

Under Section 64(i) of the Revised Administrative Code,
the President has the specific power to authorize the arrest and
reincarceration of any convicted person granted pardon or parole who,
in his judgment, shall fail to comply with the condition or conditions
of his pardon or parole. (Tesoro v. Director of Prisons, 68 Phil. 154)
One who violates the condition of his pardon may be prosecuted
and sentenced to suffer prision correctional in its minimum period

under Article 159 of the R.P.C., without prejudice to the authority
conferred upon the President by Section 64(i) of the Revised
Administrative Code to recommit him to serve the unexpired portion,
unless it exceeds six years in which case no penalty shall be imposed,
but to serve only the unexpired portion.
The R.P.C. does not repeal Section 64(i) of the RAC. Section 64(i)
of said Code and Article 159 of the R.P.C. can stand together and that
the proceeding under one provision does not preclude action under
the other. (Sales v. Dir. of Prisons, 87 Phil. 492)

Period when convict was at liberty, not deducted In case he is
recommitted.
The time during which the convict was out of prison cannot
be deducted from the unexecuted portion of his sentence. (People v.
Tapel, 64 Phil. 112)

TITLE THREE
Crimes Against Public Order

Illustration:

A was convicted of murder and was sentenced to 17 years,
four months and one day of reclusion temporal. On March 6, 1939,
after serving 15 years, seven months and 11 days, he was granted a
conditional pardon, the condition being that “he shall not again violate
any of the penal laws of the Philippines.” On April 29, 1949, A was
found guilty of driving without a license. When A violated a penal
law, 10 years elapsed from the time he was granted a conditional
pardon. When he was granted a conditional pardon, only one year,
six months and 20 days of his sentence remained to be served.
Held: The condition of the pardon which A was charged with
having breached was no longer operative when he committed a
violation of the Motor Vehicle Law. A’s pardon does not state the time
within which the conditions thereof were to be observed. Hence, A
had to observe the conditions of the pardon only within one year, six
months and 20 days. (Infante u. Provincial Warden, supra)
Violation of conditional pardon distinguished from evasion of
service of sentence by escaping.

Violation of conditional pardon does not cause harm or injury
to the right of other person nor does it disturb the public order; it
is merely an infringement of the terms stipulated in the contract
between the Chief Executive and the criminal.
Evasion of the service of the sentence is an attempt at least to
evade the penalty inflicted by the courts upon criminals and thus
defeat the purpose of the law of either reforming or punishing them
for having disturbed the public order. (Alvarez v. Director of Prisons,
80 Phil. 43)

Duration of the conditions subsequent Is limited to the remaining
period of the sentence.

The duration of the conditions subsequent, annexed to a pardon,
would be limited to the remaining period of the prisoner’s sentence,
unless an intention to extend it beyond that time was manifest from
the nature of the condition or the language in which it was imposed.

“Before beginning to serve such sentence.”

Chapter Seven

COMMISSION OF ANOTHER CRIME DURING SERVICE
OF PENALTY IMPOSED FOR
ANOTHER PREVIOUS OFFENSE

A convict by final judgment for one offense may commit a new
felony before beginning to serve his sentence for the first offense,
when the judgment of conviction of the lower court in the first offense
having been affirmed by the appellate court, and his commitment
having been ordered, he committed the new felony while being taken
to the prison or jail.
“Or while serving the same.”

Art. 160. Commission of another crime during service of
Penalty.
penalty imposed for another previous offense
Besides the provisions of Rule 5 of Article 62, any person who
shall commit a felony after having been convicted by final
judgment, before beginning to serve such sentence, or while
serving the same, shall be punished by the maximum period
of the penalty prescribed by law for the new felony.

—

—

Any convict of the class referred to in this article, who is
not a habitual criminal, shall be pardoned at the age of seventy
years if he shall have already served out his original sentence,
or when he shall complete it after reaching said age, unless
by reason of his conduct or other circumstances he shall not
be worthy of such clemency.

Article 160 provides for the so-called quasi-recidivism.

Quasi-recidivism is a special aggravating circumstance where a
person, after having been convicted by final judgment, shall commit a
new felony before beginning to serve such sentence, or while serving
the same. He shall be punished by the maximum period of the penalty
prescribed by law for the new felony.

The other case where Article 160 applies is when a convict by
final judgment shall commit a new felony while serving his sentence
for the first offense.
Hence, if the offender committed a new felony after serving the
sentence for the first offense, and both offenses are embraced in the
same title of the Code, he is an ordinary recidivist under Article 14,
paragraph 9, of the Code, because he did not commit the new felony
before or while serving the sentence for the first offense.
Second crime must be a felony.

Note the use of the word “felony” in this article. The second
crime must be a felony.
Thus, if a prisoner serving sentence for one crime is found in
possession of a firearm without license, this article does not seem
to apply, because the law punishing illegal possession of firearm
is a special law. Must Article 10 be made to apply in this case? No.
Article 160 speaks of “the maximum period” of the penalty prescribed
by law for the new felony. The penalty prescribed by special law has

no periods like the three periods of a divisible penalty prescribed by
the R.P.C.
But the first crime for which the offender is serving sentence need
not be a felony.

Elements:
1.

2.

That the offender was already convicted by final judgment of
one offense.
That he committed a new felony before beginning to serve such
sentence or while serving the same.

214

It makes no difference, for purposes of the effect of quasirecidivism under Article 160 of the R.P.C., whether the crime for
which an accused is serving sentence, at the time of the commission
of the offense charged, falls under said Code or under a special law.
(People v. Peralta, et al., 3 SCRA 213; People v. Alicia, 95 SCRA 227)

Art. 160

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

TITLE THREE
Crimea Against Public Order

Art. 160

The new offense need not be of different character from that of the
former offense.

Illustration of the application of penalty in quasi-recidivism.

The word “another” in the head note of Article 160 does not mean
that the new felony which is committed by a person already serving
sentence is different from the crime for which he is serving sentence.
Hence, even if the new offense is murder and he is serving sentence
for homicide, Article 160 applies. (People v. Yabut, 58 Phil. 499)

Immediately, the convict surrendered to the guard and during the
trial, he pleaded guilty to the charge of murder qualified by treachery.
What penalty should be imposed upon such convict?

Quasi-recidivism does not require that the two offenses are
embraced in the same title of the Code.
But Article 160 does not seem to require that the offense for
which the convict is serving sentence and the new felony committed
while serving sentence are embraced in the same title of the Code.
While in recidivism, in paragraph No. 9 of Article 14, both the first
and the second offenses must be embraced in the same title of the
Code; in quasi-recidivism, it is not so required.
Quasi-recidivism, distinguished from reiteracion.

The aggravating circumstance of “reiteracion’’ requires that
the offender against whom it is considered shall have served out his
sentences for the prior offenses. Here, all the accused were yet serving
their respective sentences at the time of the commission of the crime
of murder. The special aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism
(Art. 160, R.P.C.) was correctly considered against all the accused.
(People v. Layson, et al., L-25177, October 31, 1969, 30 SCRA 93)
Quasi-recidivism cannot be offset by ordinary mitigating
circumstances.

Suppose a convict serving sentence for serious physical injuries
killed another prisoner with treachery and evident premeditation.

Death penalty. Reason: Because the maximum of the penalty for
murder is death and the fact that there is one mitigating circumstance
(plea of guilty) left, after offsetting evident premeditation with
the other mitigating circumstance (voluntary surrender), is of no
consequence. Quasi-recidivism cannot be offset by any ordinary
mitigating circumstance. (See People v. Bautista, et al., 65 SCRA 460)
Note: But if the convict serving sentence is a minor under 16
years old, the penalty can be lowered by at least one degree. Minority
is a privileged mitigating circumstance.
A quasi-recidivist may be pardoned at the age of 70 years.

The second paragraph of Article 160 provides that a quasirecidivist shall be pardoned when he has reached the age of 70 years
and has already served out his original sentence, or when he shall
complete it after reaching said age, unless by reason of his conduct
or other circumstances, he shall not be worthy of such clemency.

But only a convict “who is not a habitual criminal” shall be
pardoned.
When he is a habitual criminal, a quasi-recidivist may not be
pardoned even if he has reached the age of 70 years and already
served out his original sentence.

The special aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism cannot
be offset by any ordinary mitigating circumstance, because Article
160 specifically provides that the offender “shall be punished by the
maximum period of the penalty prescribed by law for the new felony.”
Granting that not only plea of guilty but voluntary surrender
as well, are present, these cannot alter the penalty of death, since
even without evident premeditation, quasi-recidivism, as a special
aggravating circumstance, raises the penalty to the maximum period
of that prescribed by law for the new crime committed. (People v.
Perete, 58 O.G. 8628)

That there be false or counterfeited coins.
That the offender either made, imported or uttered such coins.
That in case of uttering such false or counterfeited coins, he
connived with the counterfeiters or importers.

Coin, defined.

Coin is a piece of metal stamped with certain marks and made
current at a certain value. (Bouvier’s Law Dictionary, 519)
When is a coin false or counterfeited?
A coin is false or counterfeited, if it is forged or if it is not
authorized by the Government as legal tender, regardless of its
intrinsic value.
Counterfeiting means the imitation of a legal or genuine coin.
It may contain more silver than the ordinary coin.

There is counterfeiting when a spurious coin is made. There
must be an imitation of the peculiar design of a genuine coin. (U.S.
v. Basco, 6 Phil. 110)
Thus, if a person gave a copper cent the appearance of a silver
piece, it being silver plated, and attempted to pay with it a package
of cigarettes which he bought at a store, such person is not liable for
counterfeiting of coin, but for estafa under Article 318. The coin in
question is a genuine copper cent, bearing its original design and
inscription.
"Import,” Its meaning.

To import fake coins means to bring them into port. The
importation is complete before entry at the Customs House. (U.S. v.
Lyman, 26 Fed. Cas. 1024)
“Utter," its meaning.

To utter is to pass counterfeited coins. It includes their delivery
or the act of giving them away. A counterfeited coin is uttered when it
is paid, when the offender is caught counting the counterfeited coins
preparatory to the act of delivering them, even though the utterer
may not obtain the gain he intended. (Decisions of the Supreme Court

Art. 164

of Spain of January 11, 1913; January 4, 1893; November 12, 1888;
and December 24, 1885) Hence, damage to another is not necessary.

Kinds of coins the counterfeiting of which is punished:

a.

Any of the coinage of the Philippines;

b.

Coin of the currency of a foreign country.

Former coins withdrawn from circulation may be counterfeited
under Article 163.
Thus, a goldsmith accused of counterfeiting for making fivedollar, 10-dollar, and 20-dollar U.S. gold coins which had been
withdrawn from circulation under the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, is
liable under paragraph 3 of Article 163 of this Code.
The reason for punishing the fabrication of a coin withdrawn
from circulation is not alone the harm that may be caused to the
public in case it goes into circulation again, but the possibility that
the counterfeiter may later apply his trade to the making of coins in
actual circulation. (People v. Kong Leon, CA., 48 O.G. 664)
Article 163 of the R.P.C. penalizes the making, importing
and uttering of false coins whether of the (United States, of the)
Philippines or of a foreign country, because it is intended to protect
not only the coins legally minted in said countries, but also the public
in general. The legislator has taken into consideration the bad effect
of the crime of counterfeiting of coins, its importing and uttering.
(People u. Tin Ching Ting [Unrep.], 90 Phil. 870)
Note: Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 163 mention “coin,” without
any qualifying word, such as“current."

As regards paragraph 3, which says: “if the counterfeited coin
be currency of a foreign country,” the use of the word “currency” is
not correct, because the Spanish text uses the word “moneda" which
embraces not only those that are legal tender, but also those out of
circulation.

Acts punished under Article 165:

1.

Possession of coin, counterfeited or mutilated by another
person, with intent to utter the same, knowing that it is false or
mutilated.

Meaning of mutilation.

Elements:

Mutilation means to take off part of the metal either by filing it
or substituting it for another metal of inferior quality.
Mutilation is to diminish by ingenuous means the metal in the
coin. One who mutilates a coin does not do so for the sake of mutilating,
but to take advantage of the metal abstracted; he appropriates a part
of the metal of the coin. Hence, the coin diminishes in intrinsic value.
One who utters said mutilated coin receives its legal value, much
more than its intrinsic value. (People v. Tin Ching Ting, G.R. No.
L-4620, January 30, 1952)

2.

a.

Possession,

b.

With intent to utter, and

c.

Knowledge.

Actually uttering such false or mutilated coin, knowing the same
to be false or mutilated.

Elements:

The coin must be of “legal tender” in mutilation.

a.

Actually uttering, and

A reading of the provisions under this chapter will reveal that
only in this article does the law require “legal tender” as an element
of the offense in the case of mutilation. Note the phrases “coins of the
legal currency’’ and “current coins” used in the law.
It is indispensable that the mutilated coin be of legal tender.
(People v. Tin Ching Ting, supra)

b.

Knowledge.

Coins of foreign country not included.

The coin mutilated must be genuine and has not been withdrawn
from circulation. The coin must be of the legal currency or current
226

Possession of or uttering false coin does not require that the
counterfeited coin is legal tender.

Thus, a person in possession of, with intention to put into
circulation, a false five-dollar gold coin, an imitation of the genuine
five-dollar gold coin of the United States, is liable under Article 165,
even if such gold coin is no longer legal tender in the United States,
and much less in the Philippines. Article 165 does not require that
the coin be of legal tender. [The Court] should not add a condition

not provided by the law. (People v. Tin Ching Ting, G.R. No. L-4620,
January 30, 1952, unreported, 90 Phil. 870)
But if the coin being uttered or possessed with intent to utter is
a mutilated coin, it must be legal tender coin, because of Article 164
to which Article 165 is related.
Constructive possession included.
The possession prohibited in Article 165 of the R.P.C. is
possession in general, that is, not only actual, physical possession,
but also constructive possession or the subjection of the thing to
one’s control (In pari materia: People v. Umali, [CA] 46 O.G. 2648;
People v. Misa, CA-G.R. No. 00800-CR, October 16, 1963; People
v. Cofiosa, CA-G.R. No. 1074, February 28, 1948; People v. Lera,
CA-G.R. No. 16990-R, February 28, 1957), otherwise offenders
could easily evade the law by the mere expedient of placing other
persons in actual, physical possession of the thing although retaining
constructive possession or actual control thereof. (People v. Andrada,
11 C.A. Rep. 147)
Possession of counterfeiter or importer not punished as separate
offense.

If the false or mutilated coins are found in the possession of the
counterfeiters, or mutilators, or importers, such possession does not
constitute a separate offense, but is identified with the counterfeiting
or mutilation or importation. (December Supreme Court of Spain,
June 28, 1877)
The offense punished under this article is the mere holding of
the false or mutilated coin with intent to utter.
“Although without the connivance mentioned in the preceding
articles.’’

Actually uttering false or mutilated coin, knowing it to be false
or mutilated, is a crime under Article 165, even if the offender was
not in connivance with the counterfeiter or mutilator.

The accused must have knowledge of the fact that the coin is false.

A Chinese merchant was paid by purchaser of goods in the

During a search by some constabulary officers, the false coin was

found in the drawer.
May the Chinaman be convicted of illegal possession of a false
coin?

No. Article 165 requires three things as regards possession of
false coins, namely: (.1) possession; (2) intent to utter; and (3) knowledge
that the coin is false.
The fact that the Chinaman received it in payment of his goods
and placed it in his drawer shows that he did not know that such coin
was false. (People v. Go Po, G.R. No. 42697, V L. J. 393, August, 1985)

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Art. 166

Meaning of importation of false or forged obligations or notes.

Importation of false or forged obligations or notes means to bring
them into the Philippines, which presupposes that the obligations or
notes are forged or falsified in a foreign country.
Meaning of uttering false or forged obligations or notes.

It means offering obligations or notes knowing them to be false
or forged, whether such offer is accepted or not, with a representation,
by words or actions, that they are genuine and with an intent to
defraud. (See 26 C.J. 924)
Uttering forged bill must be with connivance to constitute a violation
of Article 166.

By pleading guilty to the charge of having passed a P10.00
counterfeit bill in a store in violation of Article 166, the accused
admitted all the material allegations of the information, including
that of connivance with the authors of the forgery, which characterizes
the crime defined by Article 166 of the R.P.C. (People v. Valencia, et
al., 59 Phil. 42)

How are “forging” and “falsification” committed.

Forging is committed by giving to a treasury or bank note or
any instrument payable to bearer or to order the appearance of a true
and genuine document; and falsification is committed by erasing,
substituting, counterfeiting, or altering by any means, the figures,
letters, words, or signs contained therein. (Art. 169)

To forge an instrument is to make false instrument intended to
be passed for the genuine one.

Notes and other obligations and securities that may be forged or
falsified under Article 166.

They are:

1.

Treasury or bank notes,

2.

Certificates, and

3.

Other obligations and securities, payable to bearer.

Example of falsifying, counterfeiting or altering an obligation or
security of the Philippines, (par. 1 of Art. 166)

A bank note, certificate or obligation and security is payable to
bearer when it can be negotiated by mere delivery.

The accused erased and changed the last digit nine of Serial No.

A five-peso bill, etc., or a winning sweepstakes ticket is payable
to bearer, because its ownership is transferred to another by mere
delivery to him of such bill or ticket.

Penalties depend on the kind of forged treasury or bank notes or
other documents.
There are four penalties prescribed in Article 166, and those
penalties are respectively imposed if the document falsified, altered
or counterfeited is any of the following:

a.

Obligation or security issued by the Government of the
Philippines.

b.

Circulating note issued by any banking association duly
authorized by law to issue the same.

The Code punishes forging or falsification of bank notes and of
documents of credit payable to bearer and issued by the State more
severely than it does the counterfeiting of coins.

(e)

treasury notes,

(f)

fractional notes,

The reason for this is that the first tends to bring such documents
into discredit and the offense produces a lack of confidence on the part
of the holders of said documents to the prejudice of the interests of
society and of the State. Moreover, it is easier to forge or falsify such
certificates, notes and documents of credit than to make counterfeit
coins, and the profit which is derived therefrom by the forger of such
documents is greater and the incentive for the commission of such a
crime more powerful. (U.S. v. Gardner, 3 Phil. 403)

forgery under Article 166 of the R.P.C., but falsification of commercial
documents under Article 172 in connection with Article 171 of the
Code. (People v. Samson, CA-G.R. Nos. 12011-12-R, October 13, 1955;

Art. 167. Counterfeiting, importing, and uttering
instruments not payable to bearer. Any person who shall

of credit not payable to bearer, shall suffer the penalties of
prision correctional in its medium and maximum periods10
and a fine not exceeding One million two hundred thousand

—

Art. 168

Does this article cover instruments or other documents of credit
issued by a foreign government or bank?

It is believed that it includes such instruments or documents of
credit, because the act punished includes that of importing, without
specifying the country or government issuing them.
If the document is payable to bearer, there is no doubt that it may
be issued by a foreign government or bank. Article 166, paragraphs
3 and 4, cover such documents.

Falsification of U.S. treasury warrants.
The falsification of U.S. treasury warrants not payable to
bearer is punished under Article 172, not under Article 167. (People
v. Loteyro, CA., 50 O.G. 632)

But in the case of People v. Esteban, et al., C.A., 55 O.G. 3510,
the prosecution for uttering forged U.S. treasury warrants was made
under Article 166.
Reason for punishing forgery.

Elements:
1.

That there be an instrument payable to order or other document
of credit not payable to bearer.

2.

That the offender either forged, imported or uttered such

instrument.

3.

Forgery of currency is punished so as to maintain the integrity
of the currency and thus insure the credit standing of the government
and prevent the imposition on the public and the government of
worthless notes or obligations. (People v. Galano, CA., 54 O.G. 5897)

Connivance Is not required In uttering If the utterer Is the forger.

That in case of uttering, he connived with the forger or importer.

Application of Article 167 is limited to instruments payable to order.

The counterfeiting under Article 167 must involve an instrument
payable to order or other document of credit not payable to bearer.
The instrument is payable to order where it is drawn payable
to the order of a specified person or to him or his order. (Negotiable
Instruments Law, Sec. 8) It is negotiated by indorsement and delivery.

The utterer should not be the forger. If the utterer was the one
who forged the instrument payable to order, obviously connivance is
not required, for he can be held liable as a forger of the instrument.

Crimes Against Public Interest

Conduct of the accused considered to establish knowledge of
forgery.

1.

Buying eggs worth P0.30 at one instance, and making a purchase
of P0.50 at another instance, paying in each instance a false
10-peso bill, receiving on both occasions the proper amount of
change in lawful money, and when arrested and asked by a
policeman to explain the possession of the same, the offender
refused to make any explanation, stating he would know what
to say in court. In court, he failed to explain his possession of
the forged bank bills. (People v. Co Pao, 58 Phil. 545)

2.

When somebody discovered that the P20-bill to be changed was
forged, the owner snatched it from the one who was examining
it and tore it to pieces. (People v. Quinto, 60 Phil. 351)

3.

The accused at first denied to the policeman who was conducting
the search that he had counterfeit five-peso bills in his possession
and although he knew that the policeman was after the forged
bills as mentioned in the search warrant, he said he had only
a revolver without license to mislead the policeman. When the
policeman insisted in the further search, he delivered to him the
package of counterfeit bills concealed in a straw hat. (People v.
Vacani, 61 Phil. 796)

Elements:

1.

That any treasury or bank note or certificate or other obligation
and security payable to bearer, or any instrument payable to
order or other document of credit not payable to bearer is forged
or falsified by another person.

2.

That the offender knows that any of those instruments is forged

or falsified.
3.

That he performs any of these acts

—

a.

using any of such forged or falsified instruments; or

b.

possessing with intent to use any of such forged or falsified
instruments.

Intent to possess Is not intent to use.

Possession of false treasury or bank notes alone is not a criminal
offense. For it to constitute an offense under Article 168 of the Penal
Code, the possession must be with intent to use said false treasury or
bank notes. Hence, it follows that an information alleging possession
of false treasury and bank notes without alleging intent to use the
same but only “intent to possess” them, charges no offense. (People
v. Digoro, G.R. No. L-22032, March 4, 1966)
How to prove that a bank note is forged.

Evidence must be presented that the number which the
questioned bank note bears does not check with the genuine one
issued with the same number. (People v. Barraquia, 76 Phil. 490)
The accused must have knowledge of the forged character of the
note.

Thus, where the accused in aiding his brother to utter a
counterfeit bank note was not aware of its counterfeit character,
he was not guilty of illegal possession and use of false bank note.
(U.S. v. De Leon, et al., 4 Phil. 496)
236

Art. 168

Possession of counterfeit U.S. $20 bills Is punished under Article
168.
Possession of counterfeit U.S. $20 bills is punished under Article
168, because the counterfeit dollar bills are comprehended in the
words, “any of the false or falsified instruments referred to in this
section,” of Article 168. It is incumbent upon the person in possession
thereof to satisfactorily explain his innocence for said possession, it
being a fact relied upon by him as a justification or excuse and which
lies peculiarly within his knowledge. (People v. Perez, CA-G.R. No.
12581-R, January 31, 1955)

A person in possession of falsified document and who makes use
of the same is presumed to be material author of falsification.
The evidence conclusively proves that Samson, as the representative
or collector of the supposed creditor, Carried Construction Supply Co.,
237

Art. 168

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

handcarried the vouchers in question to the offices of the provincial
engineer, treasurer and auditor and the back to the treasurer’s office
for payment. He actually received the cash payments. Under those
circumstances, Samson is presumed to be the forger of the vouchers.
The rule is that if a person had in his possession a falsified document
and he made use of it (uttered it), taking advantage of it and profiting
thereby, the presumption is that he is the material author of the
falsification. This is specially true if the use or uttering of the forged
documents was so closely connected in time with the forgery that the
user or possessor may be proven to have the capacity of committing the
forgery, or to have close connection with the forgers, and, therefore,
had complicity in the forgery. (People v. Sendaydiego, 82 SCRA 120)

Intent to use is sufficient to consummate the crime when the
offender is in possession of false or falsified obligations or notes.
Although the bogus PlOO-bill was not accepted by the person to
whom it was handed in the course of a transaction (it was offered in
payment of 10 chickens), the crime is consummated. (People u. Santos,
CA., 47 O.G. 3587)

But in a case where the accused, instead of carrying out his
intention, threw away the forged note, it was held that he was not
liable whatever might be his motive in getting rid of it, for the law
will not close the door of repentance on him, who, having set foot on
the path of crime, retraces his steps before it is too late. (People v.
Padilla, CA., 36 O.G. 2404)
Mere possession of false money bill, without Intent to use It to the
damage of another, Is not a crime.

Thus, a person who had a counterfeited P50-bill under the glass
of his table among other objects as decoration, is not liable
for illegal
possession of false bank note, there being no intent to
use it to the

damage of another.

(2) that he knows who falsified them, but he does not want to divulge

him. (People v. De la Roca, CA., 40 O.G. Supp. 4, 328)
The possession of 100 falsified P20-bills can not indicate
anything except, first, the knowledge which the appellant had of the
falsity of said bills and, second, the intention of the appellant to utter
said bills. (People v. Luis Sane, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 5, 113)
Is it an Impossible crime when the act performed would have been
a crime of illegal possession of false treasury notes?
Certain one-peso, 10-peso, and 20-peso treasury notes were so
made by pressing a genuine treasury note against a coupon bond,
saturated with chemicals. All the printed matter in the treasury note
is inversely reproduced in the coupon bond. Their appearance carries
an inherent impossibility for anyone to accept them as genuine money.

Held: This case falls within the purview of paragraph 2,
Article 4, in relation to Article 59 of the R.P.C. (People v. Casals, et
al., CA-G.R. No. 12455-R, May 17, 1955)

Note: In impossible crimes under paragraph 2 of Article 4 of the
Code, the act performed would have been an offense against persons
or property. Forging or falsification of treasury notes is neither an
offense against persons nor an offense against property.

Art. 169

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

payable to bearer or to order includes (1) acts of counterfeiting or
forging said instruments, and (2) acts of falsification. (Guevara)
Example of forgery under paragraph No. 1:
People v. Galano
(CA., 54 O.G. 5899)

Facts: The accused admitted, during the investigation at the police
headquarters, having written the word “Victory” in ink at the back of the onepeso bill (Exhibit A) which he gave to Cruz as payment for the four balut eggs.
The one-peso paper bill (Exhibit A) is a genuine pre-war treasury
certificate “payable to the bearer on demand” which has been, however,
withdrawn from circulation. It is, however, redeemable at its face value if
presented to the Central Bank, pursuant to R.A. Nos. 17 and 199.
Held: The forgery here committed comes under this first paragraph of
Article 169 of the Code (By giving to a treasury or bank note or any instrument
payable to bearer or to order mentioned therein, the appearance of a true and
genuine document). [The Court) believe(s) that this provision contemplates
not only the situations where a spurious, false or fake document, but also the
situations involving originally true and genuine documents which have been
withdrawn or demonetized, or have outlived their usefulness. The case under
consideration could not come within the second paragraph of the aforesaid
article (by erasing, substituting, counterfeiting or altering by any means
the figures, letters, works or signs contained therein), because no figure,
letter, word or sign contained in Exhibit A has been erased, substituted,
counterfeited or altered. The forgery consists in the addition of a word in an
effort to give to the present document the appearance of the true and genuine
certificate that it used to have before it was withdrawn or has outlived its
usefulness.

Giving fake checks the appearance of true and genuine documents.

The accused caused the printing of the checks and, to give them
the appearance of true and genuine documents, he directed the printer
to incorporate therein the important details and wording contained
in checks regularly issued by a U.S. Government Office or agency. In
furtherance of the same objective, the accused availed of the service
of the Advance Bookbinding Service to engrave
on the checks in
block bold types the date of issue, name of the payee and the amount
payable, in words and figures. Finally, he
caused rubber stamp and
dry seal to be made and used them on the
checks.

240

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Art. 169

The accused admitted that he signed the name “A. Lobster* on
each of the checks in question, without having any authority to do
so. As a matter of fact, that name was chosen by the accused as part

of the deception, without knowing whether there was in fact a living
person bearing that name. In the light of all the foregoing, the accused
had in effect committed forgery within the meaning of paragraph 1
of Article 169 of the R.P.C. on instruments payable to order, thereby
making him guilty of a violation of Article 167 of the R.P.C. (People
v. Orqueza, 14 CA. Rep. 730)
Example of forgery under paragraph No. 2:

Facts: A received a treasury warrant, a check issued by the
Government. It was originally made payable to B, or his order. A wrote
B’s name on the back of said treasury warrant as if B had indorsed
it, and then presented it for payment. It was paid to A.
Held: This is forgery. When A wrote B’s name on the back of the
treasury warrant which was originally made payable to B or his order,
he converted, by such supposed indorsement, the treasury warrant to
one payable to bearer. It had the effect of erasing the phrase “or his
order” upon the face of the warrant. There was material alteration
on a genuine document. (U.S. v. Solito, 36 Phil. 785)
Defacement, mutilation, tearing, burning or destroying of Central
Bank notes and coins, penalized.

It is ordered and decreed:
1. That it shall be unlawful for any person to willfully deface,
mutilate, tear, burn or destroy, in any manner whatsoever,
currency notes and coins issued by the Central Bank of the
Philippines; and
2. That any person who shall violate this Decree shall, upon
conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than P20.000
and/or by imprisonment of not more than five years.

Forgery and falsification, distinguished.

The term forgery as used in Article 169 refers to the falsification
and counterfeiting of treasury or bank notes or any instruments
payable to bearer or to order. Falsification is the commission of any
of the eight acts mentioned in Article 171 on legislative (only the
act of making alteration), public or official, commercial, or private
documents, or wireless, or telegraph messages. (See Title Four,

Note that the falsification in Article 170 is committed by altering
a legislative document, which presupposes that the bill, resolution,

Assembly or any provincial board or municipal council.” A fabricated
or simulated legislative document is not covered by Article 170.
The offender Is any person.

Article 170 does not require that the offender be a private
individual. All that the provision requires is that the offender has
no proper authority to make the alteration. Hence, the offender may
be a private individual or a public officer.
The act of falsification in legislative document is limited to altering
it which changes its meaning.
Article 170 punishes “any person who, without proper authority
therefor, alters any bill,” etc. Hence, other acts of falsification, even

In case the offender is an ecclesiastical minister, the act of
falsification is committed with respect to any record or document
of such character that its falsification may affect the civil status

First element — Persons Hable under Article 171.

Under this article, only a public officer, employee or notary public
or ecclesiastical minister can be the offender.

“See Appendix “A,* Table of Penalties, No. 19.

Art. 171

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The ecclesiastical minister is liable under this article if he shall
commit any of the acts of falsification enumerated in this article
with respect to any record or document of such character that its
falsification may affect the civil status of persons.

Second element — The offender takes advantage of his official
position.
The offender takes advantage of his official position in falsifying
a document when: (1) he has the duty to make or to prepare or
otherwise to intervene in the preparation of the document; or (2) he
has the official custody of the document which he falsifies. (See People
v. Santiago Uy, 53 O.G. 7236, and U.S. v. Inosanto, 20 Phil. 376)

Even if the offender was a public officer but if he did not take
advantage of his official position, he would be guilty of falsification
of a document by a private person under Article 172.
Thus, a court stenographer who deliberately and maliciously
changed, in making transcription of his notes, the statements of a witness
taken by him is guilty of falsification under this article; while any other
officer, say a chief of police, who happened to make the same changes
or alterations in the same document, is guilty of falsification of a public
document by a private person under Article 172, paragraph 1. (U.S. v.
Austero, 14 Phil. 377; People v. Teves, 44 Phil. 275)

A municipal president falsified an inscription in the register of
births kept by, and under the charge of, the municipal secretary who
issued a certified copy of such false inscription.

Is he guilty under Article 171?
No. Although he is a public officer, the falsification committed by
him was upon an act, certificate or instrument the issuance of which
does not pertain to his office and, therefore, it was without abuse of
his office. (U.S. v. Inosanto, 20 Phil. 376)
Third element — The offender falsifies a document.

Definition of document
A document is any written statement by which a right is
established or an obligation extinguished. (People v. Moreno, CA¬
SS O.G. 119)
246

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Art. 171

A document is a writing or instrument by which a fact may be

proven and affirmed.
Thus, if the payroll is merely a draft, because it has not been
approved by the proper authority, it can prove nothing and affirm
nothing. (People v. Camacho, 44 Phil. 488) Pamphlets cannot be
said to evidence a fact, agreement or disposition. They are rather
merchandise as any other article usually sent by C.O.D. mail. (People
v. Agnis, 47 Phil. 945)
The document must be complete or at least it must have the
appearance of a true and genuine document.
The document must be of apparent legal efficacy. Thus, making
a writing which is invalid on its face, as in the case of a will not signed
by the requisite number of witnesses, is not falsification. (Miller on
Criminal Law, 406)
Must there be a genuine document in falsification?

In falsification by (1) making alteration or intercalation, or
(2) including in a copy a different statement, there must be a genuine
document that is falsified. Thus, in paragraphs 6, 7, in its second part,
and 8 of Article 171, the law requires that there be a genuine document
where the intercalation or alteration is made changing its meaning.

In the other paragraphs of Article 171, falsification may be
committed by simulating or fabricating a document.
Documents may be simulated or fabricated.

The simulation of a public document, done in a manner so as
to easily lead to error as to its authenticity, constitutes the crime of
falsification. (Re: Fake Decision Allegedly in G.R. No. 75242, A.M. No.
02-8-23-0, February 16, 2005, 451 SCRA 357, 386)
In falsification of a public document, the falsification need not be
made on an official form. It is sufficient that the document is given the
appearance of, or made to appear similar to, the official form. (People
v. Tupasi, CA-G.R. Nos. 290-292, March 22, 1937)
The simulation of public, official or mercantile document is also
contemplated in falsification of those documents. (People v. David,

handwriting, signature or rubric; and (2) feigning, which is simulating
a signature, handwriting or rubric out of one which does not in fact
exist.

Facts: To cause the arrest of his common-law wife who had left him
and had gone to Corregidor, taking with her a trunk and a diamond ring, the
accused simulated a warrant of arrest by making it appear that the same
was signed and issued by the authority when in truth and in fact it was not.
The accused sent it to the municipal president of Corregidor and, by virtue
thereof, the woman was arrested. When prosecuted for falsification of a
public document, the accused contended that one can falsify only a genuine
document and that what he falsified was no document at all.
Held: It is not necessary that it be a real document, it is enough that
it be given the appearance of a genuine document.

Under paragraph 1 of Article 171, the mere drawing up of a false
document is not sufficient to constitute the crime of falsification. The
signature, handwriting or mark of another person must be signed or
made by the offender, without authority to do so. (U.S. u. Paraiso,
1 Phil. 66)

“Shall falsify a document”

Requisites of counterfeiting.

It will be noted that Article 171 does not specify the kind
of document falsified, the phrase “shall falsify a document” not
mentioning whether it is public, official, private or commercial
document.

Imitation of another’s signature need not be perfect. It is
necessary only (1) that there be an intent to imitate, or an attempt to
imitate, and (2) that the two signatures or handwritings, the genuine
and the forged, bear some resemblance to each other. (U.S. u. Pampas,
26 Phil. 189)

It is not necessary to specify in Article 171 the document falsified,
because when the document is executed with the intervention of
a public officer, employee or notary public, such document must
necessarily be a public or official document. Even if the document
is originally a private document, if it is in the official custody of
the public officer or employee or if it forms part of the official record
when it is falsified by the public officer or employee, then the crime
committed should be punished under Article 171.
Different modes of falsifying a document.
Any of the eight acts of falsification enumerated in Article 171
may be committed on any document by a public officer or notary
public, or by a private individual - only that if the offender is a
private individual or a public officer who does not take advantage of
his official position, Article 172 shall apply.

The offender falsifies a document by committing any of the
following acts:

248

In counterfeiting, there is an original signature or handwriting
which is imitated. An imitation is necessary, but it need not be perfect.

There must be an intent or attempt to imitate.

The attempt or the intent to imitate may be shown by a
comparison of the handwriting or signature on the document alleged
to have been falsified with the genuine handwriting or signature
supposed to have been counterfeited. If there is sufficient resemblance
between the genuine and the forged signatures, it can be concluded
that the accused had the intention and attempted to imitate the
signature of the offended party. (U.S. v. Rampas, supra)
The forged and the genuine signatures or handwritings must bear
some resemblance to each other.

The resemblance must be such that it is likely to deceive an
ordinary person receiving or dealing with the document. (U.S. v.
Rampas, supra)
Thus, it has been held that the fact of imitating a person’s
signature on a check in such a way that the same, when presented
for collection “might have passed in the rush of business,” although
the handwriting is a little bit different, constitutes falsification. (U.S.

“Under Rule 132, Section 22 of the Rules of Court, the
genuineness of handwriting may be proved in the following manner:
(1) by any witness who believes it to be the handwriting of such
person because he has seen the person write; or he has seen writing
purporting to be his upon which the witness has acted or been
charged; (2) by a comparison, made by the witness or the court, with
writings admitted or treated as genuine by the party, against whom
the evidence is offered, or proved to be genuine to the satisfaction of
the judge.

When any of the requisites of counterfeiting is not present.

If there is no attempt whatsoever by the accused to imitate the
signatures of other persons so that they are entirely unlike the genuine
signatures of those persons, the accused may be found guilty under
paragraph 2, Article 171, in causing it to appear that those persons
have participated in the act when they did not in fact so participate.

Imitating (feigning).

The Spanish text of Article 171 “fingiendo” (for imitation). In
feigning, there is no original signature, handwriting or rubric, but
a forgery of a signature, handwriting or rubric that does not exist.

Corollary thereto, jurisprudence states that the presumption of
validity and regularity prevails over allegations of forgery and fraud.
As against direct evidence consisting of the testimony of a witness
who was physically present at the signing of the contract and who
had personal knowledge thereof, the testimony of am expert witness
constitutes indirect or circumstantial evidence at best.” (Ambray v.

U.S. v. Castro
(6 Phil. 11)

Facts: The accused is charged with the falsification of a private
document in that he signed the name of one Regino Sevilla, deceased, to a

certain bill of sale of a boat or barangay, the property of the estate of the
said Sevilla.
261

260

Art. 171

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The accused attached the signature of Regino Sevilla to the document in
question for the purpose of defrauding Sevilla’s heirs and depriving them of
their property in the said boat. It does not appear, however, that any attempt
was made to simulate the genuine signature, and there is evidence of record
that Sevilla himself did not know how to write or even to sign his own name.

Held: This court, adopting the doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court
of Spain, has frequently held that upon a charge of falsification by attaching
the signature of another to a written document, conviction cannot be had
unless it appears that an attempt has been made to simulate the genuine
signature of that person; and, therefore, the accused can not be convicted of
the crime of falsification as charged in the information.

Note: The crime committed could not be falsification under
paragraph 2 of Article 171, because it could not be made to appear that the
deceased participated in the execution of the document by signing it, since
he did not know how to write.

Circumstantial evidence must be consistent with each other and
each and every circumstance must be consistent with the accused’s
guilt and inconsistent with his innocence.
The courts a quo also relied on circumstantial evidence to convict
Lamsen of the crime of falsification of public document. It was pointed
out that: (a) the subject deed was notarized in Manila even if Lamsen
and spouses Tandas were residents of Valenzuela; (b) Lamsen failed
to show when the alleged witnesses signed the subject deed; (c) the
subject deed was executed and notarized sometime in April 1993, but
was registered with the RD only after the death of Aniceta sometime
in May 2002; (d) the corresponding capital gains and documentary
stamp taxes were paid only on April 11, 2002; and (e) the original
copy of the subject deed, which was purportedly retained by Lamsen,
was neither presented nor produced during trial.
Circumstantial evidence consists of proof of collateral facts and
circumstances from which the main fact in issue may be inferred
based on reason and common experience. It is sufficient for conviction
if: (a) there is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the
inferences are derived are proven; and (c) the combination of all the
circumstances is such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable
doubt. The circumstantial evidence presented must therefore
constitute an unbroken chain which leads one to a fair and reasonable
conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of the others, as
the guilty person. Stated differently, the test to determine whether
252

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Art. 171

or not the circumstantial evidence on record is sufficient to convict
the accused is that the series of circumstances duly proven must be
consistent with each other and that each and every circumstance
must be consistent with the accused’s guilt and inconsistent with
his innocence.
While it is true that the courts can rely on circumstantial
evidence in order to establish the guilt of the accused, the
circumstantial evidence which the courts a quo relied upon in this
case did not sufficiently create moral certainty, since they appear to
be too insignificant and unconvincing. Firstly, the Notarial Law does
not require the parties to have the subject deed notarized in the place
of their residence. Secondly, the issue on the date when the supposed
witnesses signed the subject deed is immaterial. In fact, Section 30,
Rule 132 of the Rules of Court provides that an instrument, such as
a notarized document, may be presented in evidence without further
proof, the certificate of acknowledgment being prima facie evidence of
the execution of the instrument or document involved. Thirdly, having
the subject deed registered with the RD after an unreasonable length
of time from its execution and notarization does not necessarily imply
that the subject deed was actually forged. Lastly, the supposed belated
payment of the corresponding capital gains and documentary stamp
taxes has no relevance at all with the supposed act of falsification.
By and large, the prosecution presented no adequate circumstantial
evidence which would warrant Lamsen’s conviction for the crime of
Falsification of Public Document. (Lamsen v. People. G.R. No. 227069,

Example:
People u. Villanueva
(58 Phil. 671)

Facts: On December 7, 1931, there was sent from Hawaii a postal money
order for the sum of P200.00 in favor of Irene Sanchez. On January 14, 1932,
there were likewise sent from California five postal money orders, four of
which were for the sum of P200.00 each and one for the sum of P100.0O, in
favor of Feliciano Isidro.
The defendant postmaster signed two documents (Exhibits B and D)
wherein he admitted having received the money orders, forged the signature
of Irene Sanchez and Feliciano Isidro thereon, collected and appropriated
the respective amounts thereof.
Held: Even if the signatures of Irene Sanchez and Feliciano Isidro had
not been imitated on the money orders, the fact that they were signed thereon
in order to make it appear that they intervened in the execution thereof in
the sense that they received the corresponding amounts, when they did not
in fact intervene or receive the amount in question, is sufficient to constitute
the crime of falsification of public documents.

When committed by private individual, Article 172 should be applied.
The act of falsely impersonating the owner of a piece of land as
vendor in the forged deed of sale would constitute an act of falsification
under paragraph 2 of Article 171 (Emas v. De Zuzuarregui, et al., 53

Example:
U.S. v. Capule
(24 Phil. 13)

Facts: Nicasio Capule, for the purpose of appropriating to himself a tract
of coconut land, without the knowledge or consent of the owners thereof, by
agreement and cooperation with the notary public who later died, prepared
and drew up a document setting forth the sale in his favor of the said land,
pretending that it was made and executed by the said owners of the tract,
stating in the document that they had made the declaration that they had
sold said land for the sum of P550.00 paid at the time of the sale to the
vendors; and Eulogio Ortega and Doroteo Guia as the signers of the deed of
sale, because the alleged vendors did not know how to do so.
It appears, however, that the owners of the land did not sell it to Nicasio
Capule or that they executed in his favor any document of sale; that what
they really did was that they conferred a power of attorney upon him so that
he might represent them in a suit they had with Maximino Reyes, because of
the absolute confidence they had in the defendant; and that they never were in
the house of the notary Inocente Martinez to execute or ratify any document.
Held: The defendant executed upon said notarial document of an
official character, acts constituting falsification, by counterfeiting therein
the intervention of the owners of the land, to whom he ascribed statements
different from what they had made to him and by perverting the truth in
the narration of facts, getting persons to sign in the name of the owners of
the land, through deceit, after giving them to understand that the document
contained a power of attorney, when in fact it was a deed of sale of the land, the

That the facts narrated by the offender are absolutely false; and
That the perversion of truth in the narration of facts was made
with the wrongful intent of injuring a third person.

There must be narration of facts, not of conclusion of law.

The Provincial Fiscal filed an information charging the accused
with falsification because in her certificate of candidacy for the
position of councilor, she had “willfully and unlawfully” made the
false statement that she was “eligible” to the said office although “in
fact and in truth, she knew fully well that she was under 23 years
old, thereby making in this manner, an untruthful statement in the
narration of facts.”

Held: When the accused certified she was eligible for the position,
she practically wrote a conclusion of law which turned out to be
inexact or erroneous but not entirely groundless; hence, she may not
be declared guilty of falsification, specially because the law which
she has allegedly violated (Art. 171, R.P.C.), punishes the making of
untruthful statements in a narration of facts. Had she stated that she
was bom on March 29, 1931, she would undoubtedly have been guilty
of falsification, because the date of her birth was a matter of fact. But
when she declared that she was “eligible,” she merely expressed her
belief that the 23-year requirement could be adequately met if she
reached 23 years upon assuming the councilorship. Unfortunately,
she made a mistake of judgment; but she could not be held thereby
to have intentionally made a false statement of fact in violation of
Article 171. (People v. Yanza, G.R. No. L-12089,prom. April 29, 1960)
Second requisite.

There must be a legal obligation on the part of the accused to
disclose the truth of the facts narrated. (People v. Quasha, infra, citing
U.S. v. Lopez, 15 Phil. 515)
“Legal obligation” means that there is a law requiring the disclosure
of the truth of the facts narrated.

In a falsification complaint filed against a professor for making
it appear in his leave application that he was on forced leave from
May 15, 1996 to May 21, 1996 and on vacation leave from May 22,
1996 to May 31, 1996 when he was in truth serving a 20-day prison
term during said time, the Court held that the complainant failed
266

TITLE FOUR

Art. 171

to point to any law imposing upon the professor the legal obligation
to disclose where he was going to spend his leave of absence. “Legal
obligation” means that there is a law requiring the disclosure of the
truth of the facts narrated. The professor may not be convicted of the
crime of falsification of public document by making false statements

in a narration of facts absent any legal obligation to disclose where he
would spend his vacation leave and forced leave. (Enemecio v. Office
of the Ombudsman, G.R. No. 146731, January 13, 2004)
In Ramirez u. Court of Appeals, 71 SCRA 231, it was held that,
“Although the acts imputed to the accused constituted, at the time
they were committed, falsification of commercial documents penalized
under Article 172, paragraph 1, of the R.P.C., the promulgation of
Central Bank Circular 133 abolishing the requirement of specific
licensing under Central Bank Circular No. 20 wiped away the legal
obligation of the applicants for foreign exchange to disclose the truth
of the facts narrated in the documents supporting their application. As
there is no more legal obligation to disclose such truth, an untruthful
statement therein no longer constitutes the crime of falsification
perpetrated by making false statements in a narration of facts.”
People u. Quasha
(93 Phil. 333)

Facts: The accused was a lawyer who drafted the articles of incorporation
of a public utility corporation. In preparing it, the accused made it appear
thereon that Bayion, his servant, was the owner of the shares which amounted
to more than 60% of the subscribed capital stocks.
The falsification imputed to the accused consisted in not disclosing in
the articles of incorporation that Bayion was a mere trustee (or dummy as the
prosecution chose to call him) of his American co-incorporators, thus giving
the impression that Bayion was the owner of the shares subscribed to by him
which, as above stated, amounted to 60.005% of the subscribed capital stock.

Held: The Constitution does not prohibit the mere formation of a public
utility corporation without the required proportion of Filipino capital. What
it does prohibit is the granting of a franchise or other form of authorization
for the operation of a public utility to a corporation already in existence but
without the requisite proportion of Filipino capital.

For the mere formation of the corporation, such revelation was not
essential and the Corporation Law does not require it. Defendant was,
therefore, under no obligation under the law to make it.

People v. Poserio
(CA., 53 O.G. 6159)

Facts: On June 1, 1961, the defendant was appointed patrolman of the
Manila Police Department.
On July 30, 1961, in compliance with one of the requirements of the
Manila Police Department, he filled in an information sheet called “Personal
Data.” On the blank space opposite question No. 10, therein, which asked
if the applicant had previously been convicted of a criminal offense, the
defendant placed the word “none.”
In an investigation later conducted, it was discovered that, contrary
to the defendant’s answer to Question No. 10, he had a previous conviction
of the crime of theft.

Held: The prosecution has failed to point to any law or ordinance
imposing upon the defendant the legal obligation to reveal his previous
conviction in filling in the personal data sheet which members of the Manila
Police Department are required to file.
The element, therefore, of “legal obligation* which is necessary in order
that the defendant may be convicted of the crime of falsification of the public
document under Article 171, paragraph 4, of the R.P.C., is wanting.
The defendant was acquitted.

Maguad u. de Guzman
(A.M. No. P-94-1015, March 29, 1999)

F acts: Complainants allege that the respondents committed falsification
by making untruthful statements in a narration of facts under Article 171(4) of
the R.P.C. when they made an entry in the birth certificates of their children
that they were married on December 8, 1982, or December 8, 1984, in Davao
City, when in fact they were not.

Held: One essential element of this kind of falsification is that there
must be a legal obligation to disclose the truth of the fact claimed to be false.
In other words, there must be a law requiring, expressly or impliedly, the
disclosure of the truth of the fact alleged to have been falsified. No law has
been shown by the complainants making it either expressly or impliedly a
duty of an informant in a record of birth to disclose the truth that the parents
of the child covered by it are married or not. Consequently, the charge of
falsification against the respondents cannot prosper.

The person making the narration of facts must be aware of the
falsity of the facts narrated by him.

Thus, a municipal treasurer who paid the specified amount in
B’s voucher, presented by C for payment, and later made statement
in his accounts current with the government that the money had
been paid to B, not knowing that the signature of B was forged and,

therefore, the municipal treasurer had no knowledge of the falsity
of his statement in his account current, is not liable for falsification
by making untruthful statements in a narration of facts. (U.S. u.
Gonzaga, 14 Phil. 562)
The narration of facts must be absolutely false.

Thus, where the defendant, who was janitor, marked with
vertical lines in a payroll opposite the names of some persons under
his charge, whose duty it was to take care of and clean the building,
to show that said persons had performed their work, during the days
stated in the payroll, and then certified that the payroll was correct,
when as a matter of fact one of the men did his work only before
8:00 in the morning but absented himself during the whole day and
worked as a cook in the house of the defendant during said period,
it was held that the defendant was not liable for falsification by
making false statements in the narration of facts, for the reason that
said person who worked as a cook in his house really worked in the
building, although it was not for the whole day and that the nature
of the work of said person was such that it could be finished before
8:00 every morning. (U.S. v. Bayot, 10 Phil. 518)
The rule is that if the statements are not altogether false,
there being some colorable truth in such statements, the crime of
falsification is not deemed to have been committed. Cuello Calon is
authority for the statement that "La mera inexactitud no es bastante
para integrar este delito.” (Cuello Calon, Derecho Penal, 6th Ed.,
Vol. II, p. 216; People v. Villena, et al., CA., 51 O.G. 5691)

It is a settled doctrine that in falsification by an employee under
“by making untruthful
paragraph 4 of Article 171, which reads
statements in a narration of facts,” the following elements must
(a) That the offender makes in a document, untruthful
concur
statements in a narration of facts; (b) That he has a legal obligation
to disclose the truth of the facts narrated by him; (c) That the facts

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

narrated by the offender are absolutely false; and (d) That the
perversion of truth in the narration of facts was made with the
wrongful intent of injuring a third person. Herein petitioner contends
that the foregoing elements are not present in the case at bar. The
correction of the figure from 1,539 to 1,533 pieces to conform to the
actual number of treasury notes under custody is not falsification
because it was made to speak the truth. (Cabigas v. People, 152
SCRA 18)
Legal obligation to disclose relationship In government
appointments.

The petitioner was a public officer, being then the incumbent
mayor of the Municipality of Lianga, Surigao del Sur, when he issued
the appointment in favor of Fernando Y. Layno as a meat inspector
in the office of the municipal treasurer. In connection with the said
appointment, the petitioner taking advantage of his official position,
issued the certification
a public document stating therein that he
is not related to the appointee within the third degree of consanguinity
or affinity. He had the legal obligation to disclose his true relationship
with the appointee. The facts narrated by the petitioner in the said
certification are absolutely false since the truth is that the appointee
Fernando Y. Layno is his legitimate son. Had petitioner truthfully
declared that the appointee was his son, the appointment would
have been disapproved by the Civil Service Commission and he
would have been prosecuted for violation of the law on nepotism. He
is guilty of the crime of falsification by a public officer under Article
171, paragraph 4, of the R.P.C. (Layno v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No.
93842, September 7, 1992)

Legal obligation to disclose the truth, inherent in residence
certificate.

The obligation on the part of the accused to disclose the truth as
to the facts that should appear in a residence certificate to be issued
to him, is inherent in the very nature and purpose of said document.
Hence, if a person buying a residence certificate gave to the clerk
of the treasurer’s office false information as to his full name, place
and date of birth, citizenship, civil status, length of residence in the
Philippines, length of residence in the city or municipality where
the certificate is issued, occupation or calling, which are required to
appear in the residence certificate by Com. Act No. 465,
for the purpose

of establishing his true and correct identity, he thereby committed
falsification as principal by induction in making false statement in

the narration of fact. (People v. Po Giok To, 96 Phil. 913)

The perversion of truth in the narration of facts must be made with
the wrongful intent of Injuring a third person.

On the authority of U.S. v. Reyes, 1 Phil. 341, the perversion of
truth in the narration of facts must be made with the wrongful intent
of injuring a third person. (People u. Quasha, supra)

As [the Court] analyze[s] the facts, the appellants cannot be
legally convicted of the crime of falsification of a public document.
There is no showing that in omitting to disclose the truth in the
minutes in question, the appellants were animated by a desire to do
wrong to, or injure, a third person. The law does not require the filing
with the Department of Labor of the minutes of the organizationmeeting of a labor union. The erroneous narration of facts found in
said minutes, therefore, as to the presence of appellant Leonardo T.
Area in the organization-meeting therein described is not an essential
part of the notice and does not affect the integrity of said minutes as
a notice. For, whether the meeting was presided over by appellant
Leonardo T. Area, or by any other person, the stubborn fact remains
that the union was duly organized, its Constitution and By-Laws
approved, and its officers were duly elected, which are the essential
requirements of the notice contemplated in the law. (People v. Area,
et al., A.C., 56 O.G. 297)
Wrongful intent not essential when the document falsified is public

document.

The law is clear that wrongful intent on the part of the accused
to injure a third person is not an essential element of the crime of
falsification of public document. (People v. Po Giok To, 96 Phil. 917)
CUnsp. Liwanag v. People,
(G.R. No. 205260, July 29, 2019)

Facts: Petitioner was indicted for and convicted of falsification of public
document under Article 171 (paragraph 4) of the Revised Penal Code because
when he issued TOP No. 02774452-A, he made untruthful statements in a
narration of facts, i.e. a) he entered his son’s name “Ruben Rubio Liwanag,
Jr.” on the TOP; b) he made a false entry pertaining to his son’s birthdate i.e.
June 27, 1974 instead of June 27, 1977 (his son’s true birthdate); and c) he
261

TITLE FOUR

Criminal Law

altered his badge number from “04580” to “50480,” thus, making it appear
that he had authority to issue the subject TOP.
Held: Petitioner does not deny the presence of the elements of Article
171, paragraph 4 of the Revised Penal Code. He, nonetheless, insists on his
plea that he had no malicious or wrongful intent to injure a third person.
On this score, suffice it to state that intent to gain or intent to injure is not
an element of the crime of falsification of public document. Nor is it a valid

defense.

There is no falsification by one who acted in good faith.
The statement in the affidavit that the affiant was the owner of
a banca which he had raised from the bottom of the estero by virtue
of a contract with the municipality and that it remained unclaimed,
is not falsification because he believed that he was entitled to its
ownership. (U.S. v. San Jose, 7 Phil. 604)
The fact that one's consent to a contract was obtained by means of
violence does not make the facts narrated therein false.

By means of threats and intimidation, A, B and C succeeded in
having D and E execute a deed of sale over a parcel of land belonging
to said D and E in favor of A. In the deed of sale, it was stated that
for and in consideration of a certain amount of money, D and E sold
said parcel of land to A.
Held: A, B and C are not guilty of falsification, because the fact
that one s consent to the contract was obtained by means of violence
or intimidation does not make it a false contract in the sense that
no consent had ever been given and the entire document had been
simulated, since the signatures of the parties are genuine. (U.S. v.
Milla, 4 Phil. 391)

Falsification by omission.
An assistant bookkeeper of the post exchange at Fort Stotsenberg
who, having bought several articles in the post exchange for which
he signed several chits, intentionally did not
record in his personal
account most of the said chits and destroyed them so that he could
avoid paying the amount thereof, is guilty of falsification by
omission.
(People v. Dizon, 47 Phil. 350)

262

Art 171

Reckless imprudence resulting to falsification of public
documents.
Sevilla v. People
(G.R. No. 194390, August 13, 2014)
Facts: Accused was charged with falsification of public document under
Article 171(4) by making a false narration in his Personal Data Sheet (PDS).
In answer to the question of whether there is a pending criminal case against
him, accused a marked the box corresponding to the “no” answer despite
the pendency of a criminal case against him for assault upon an agent of a
person in authority. While accused admitted that he marked the box “no,”
he claimed that it was a member of his staff who prepared his PDS and that
he signed the same without checking the veracity of the entries therein. The
Sandiganbayan held that that accused did not act with malicious intent to
falsify the document in question but merely failed to ascertain for himself
the veracity of narrations in his PDS before affixing his signature thereon.
The reckless signing of the PDS without verifying the data therein makes
him criminally liable for falsification of public document through reckless
imprudence under Article 365 of the R.P.C.
Held: The designation of the felony committed as “falsification of public
document through reckless imprudence” implies that reckless imprudence is
not a crime in itself but simply a modality of committing it. Quasi-offenses
under Article 365 of the R.P.C. are distinct and separate crimes and not a
mere modality in the commission of a crime. What is penalized is the mental
attitude or condition behind the acts of dangerous recklessness and lack of
care or foresight although such mental attitude might have produced several
effects or consequences. (People v. Cano, L-19660, May 24, 1966) Thus, the
proper designation of the felony should be reckless imprudence resulting to
falsification of public documents.

Par. No. 5

—

Altering true dates.

Date must be essential.

There is falsification under this paragraph only when the date
mentioned in the document is essential. The alteration of the date or
dates in a document must affect either the veracity of the document
or the effects thereof. (Decisions of the Supreme Court of Spain of
February 25, 1885, and June 21, 1886, cited in the case of People v.
Reodica and Cordero, 62 Phil. 567)

Thus, when in the payroll, the municipal treasurer certified
that he paid the salary of an employee on July 31, when in fact it was
done on July 23, it was held that at any rate the employee having
263

Art. 171

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

been in fact paid, it was immaterial whether it was done on July 23
or July 31. The employee was granted a leave of eight days from July
23 to July 31 and for the purposes of the payment of his salary, this
amounted to his having rendered services during that period. (People
v. Reodica and Cordero, 62 Phil. 567)

Note: The alteration of the date of the actual payment of the
salary of the employee did not affect either the veracity of the
document or the effects thereof, such date not being essential.

application when the act is committed, not by ignorance or mistake
but rather to prevent the discovery of an illegal appropriation of public
funds. (People v. Belgica, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 4, 17)
Par. No. 6 — Making alteration or intercalation in a genuine
document which changes its meaning.
Requisites:
1.

That there be an alteration (change) or intercalation (insertion)
on a document;

2.

That it was made on a genuine document;

3.

That the alteration or intercalation has changed the meaning
of the document; and

4.

That the change made the document speak something false.

Example of alteration of dates which are essential.
The chief of police, in conspiracy with the justice of the peace,
altered the dates in the police blotter, book of records of arrest, bail
bond, and the return of the warrant of arrest of S so as to make them
show that S was arrested and gave bond on September 13, 1930.
The falsifications were made to meet the administrative charges
against the justice of the peace who had to dispose of the preliminary
investigation of the case against S within 10 days, but failed to do so.
(People v. Montano and Cabagsang, 57 Phil. 599)
The date altered by the accused in those documents was
essential, because the date, September 6, 1930, will show that there
was a delay in the preliminary investigation of the case, in violation
of the circular of the Court of First Instance.
The dates of birth, marriage and death are essential, because
without them the documents“cannot produce any legal effect.” (Albert)

Altering dates in official receipts to prevent the discovery of

malversation is falsification.
When the auditor examined the book of receipts of the accused,
it was noticed that there were signs of alteration on the duplicate
receipt No. 5246316 in the portion corresponding to the date of
issuance, by making it appear that the payment of the real estate
tax in the amount of P109.26 was made on the 4th of August, when
in truth and in fact it was made on the 30th of July. Because of the
alteration, the accused was able to make use of the money covered
by the receipt which should have been credited to the public funds
on July 30, 1936.
Held. The accused is guilty of falsification. It is true that if the
alteration of a date does not affect the integrity of the document,
it does not constitute the crime of falsification,
but the rule has no
264

Art. 171

Example of falsification by making alteration.

The accused was arrested for having in his possession a falsified
duplicate copy of Traffic Violation Report previously issued to him
as temporary driver’s permit. The alterations were found to consist
in erasing or obliterating the originally written figure “III” and the
word “three” after the words “pending cases” and by writing and
superimposing thereon number “I” and the word “one.” The accused
made such alterations to hide his previously pending traffic violation
cases and thereby avoid immediate arrest should he be caught
committing a fourth traffic violation.

Held: The accused is guilty of falsification of an official document,
by making alterations on a genuine document which changed its
meaning. (People v. Manansala, 105 Phil. 1253)
Alteration which speaks the truth is not falsification.

The defendant, a priest of Aliaga, Nueva Ecija, was called on in
the performance of his duties to execute an affidavit. When asked to
produce his personal cedula, it was observed that the age therein had
been altered, the figure “23” having been changed to “25.” It appeared
that defendant’s real age was 25. He was prosecuted for falsification
of his cedula, for altering the age appearing therein.
266

Art. 171

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

TITLE FOUR
Crimea Against Public Interest

Held: The defendant did not commit any crime in changing his
age. He simply made the cedula speak the truth. It was a correction,
not falsification. Generally, the word alteration has inherent in it
the idea of deception of making the instrument speak something
which the parties did not intend it to speak. To be an alteration in
violation of the law, it must be one “which causes the instrument to
speak a language different in legal effect from that which it originally
spoke.” (U.S. v. Mateo, 25 Phil. 324; Arriola v. Republic, 103 Phil. 730)

—

Art. 172

Such acts of falsification can be committed only by a public officer
or notary public who takes advantage of his official position, since the
authentication of a document can be made only by the custodian or
the one who prepared and retained a copy of the original document.
1.

Purporting to be a copy of an original when no such original
exists.

That a notary public made a supposed copy of a deed of
sale which was never executed and of which he had no copy, is
an example.

The alteration must affect the integrity or change the effects of the
document.

Including in a copy a statement contrary to, or different from,
that of the genuine original.

The change in the public document must be such as to affect
the integrity of the same or to change the effects which it would
otherwise produce; for, unless that happens, there could not exist
the essential element of the intention to commit the crime. (People
v. Pacana, 47 Phil. 48)

2.

Altering the grades in examination papers involves several acts of
falsification.

Liability of private individual in falsification by a public officer when
there is conspiracy.

On the composition of a bar candidate, the grades 73% in Civil
Law and 64% in Remedial Law were written by an employee of the
Supreme Court, after striking out the grade of 63% theretofore given
to the composition in Civil Law and 58% theretofore given to the
composition in Remedial Law.
Held: The acts of falsification are: (1) making alterations
on genuine documents, (2) making it appear that the correctors
had participated in blotting out the grades and writing new and
increased grades opposite their initials, and (3) attributing to the
correctors statements other than those in fact made by them. (People
v. Romualdez, et al., 57 Phil. 151)

A private person who cooperates with a public officer in the
falsification of a public document is guilty of this crime and incurs
the same liability and penalty as the public officer. (Viada, 2 Codigo
Penal 387; U.S. v. Ponte, 20 Phil. 379)

Intent to gain or prejudice not necessary.

It will be noted that in Article 171, it is the official character of
the offender which is mainly taken into consideration.
The idea of gain or the intent to cause damage to a third person
is not necessary, because it is the interest of the community which is
intended to be guaranteed by the strictest faithfulness of the officials

document is also a public document. It falls within the larger

A document required by a bureau to be filled by its officers
for purposes of its record and information is an official document.
(People v. Uy, 101 Phil. 159)

It has been held that a receipt issued by the department
of assessments and collections of the City of Manila, for taxes
collected, is a public document, and one who falsifies the same is
guilty of the falsification of a public document. (U.S. v. Leyson, 5
Phil. 447) In the case of U.S. v. Mateo, 5 Phil. 462, a burial permit
issued by the Board of Public Health of the City of Manila was
held to be a public document. In the case of U.S. v. Vy Guico, 12
Phil. 209, it was held that the official receipt prescribed by the
Government to be issued upon the receipt of money for public
purposes is a public document.

In the case of U.S. v.Weems, 7 Phil. 241, it was held that an
official cashbook kept by the disbursing officer of the Coast Guard
and Transportation Department, was a public or an official
document. In the case of U.S. v. Barrios, 10 Phil. 366, it was held
that the cashbook of a public official, in which entries are made
of accounts of public money received, is also public document. In
the case of U.S. v. Vy Gucio (supra), an official receipt was held
to be a public document, for the reason that it was invested with
the character of an official document by reason of the fact that it
was printed in accordance with the standard forms required by
the Government. In the present case, the document in question
was printed in accordance with Schedule C and furnished to
merchants, in accordance with the provisions of the law of 1904.
This form was evidently prescribed by the internal revenue
department of the Government. When presented to the internal
revenue department of the Government, it became part of the
records of that office and is fully invested with the character of
an official or public document. (U.S. v. Asensi, 34 Phil. 750)
A petition for habeas corpus duly subscribed and sworn to
before a clerk of court and filed with the court of first instance
forming a part of the court records in said proceedings, is a public

Art. 172

The possessor of a certificate of title is presumed to be the author
of the falsification that made possible the transfer of title.
Thus, when a woman had obtained possession of the original
certificate of title in the name of the deceased and because of a
falsified deed of sale, the original certificate of title was issued, the
presumption is that she was the one who falsified the deed of sale
and the one who counterfeited the signature of the deceased owner.
The crime could not have been committed if the perpetrator had not
been in possession of the certificate of title. Not having offered any
explanation as to what she did with the certificate, the position of
that woman is analogous to that of a person who immediately after
a larceny has been committed, is found in possession of the stolen
goods and offers no explanation. (People v. Domingo, et al., 49 Phil. 28)

TITLE FOUR

Crimes Against Public Interest

A private document may acquire the character of a public

document when it becomes part of an official record and is

certified by a public officer duly authorized by law.

Mere blank form of an official document is not in itself a document.

In order that a blank form might come within the purview of
Articles 166, 167, 171 or 172 of the Code, it is necessary that the blank
spaces be filled and the signature of a party purported to be authorized

People v. Manansala
(105 Phil. 1253)

Facts: The trial court convicted the accused of the crime of falsification
of official or public document mainly on the proposition that “the only person
who could have made the erasures and the superimposition mentioned is the
one who will be benefited by alterations thus made” and that he “alone could
have the motive for making such alterations.”
Held: It is an established rule that when a person has in his possession
a falsified document and makes use of the same, the presumption or inference
is justified that such person is the forger. The circumstances, therefore,
that the accused made use and benefited from the falsified TVR are strong
evidence that he himself either falsified it or caused the same to be falsified.
The accused had a sufficient and strong motive to commit the falsification,
because the policy and practice of the Manila Police Department was to
arrest a driver who had committed a fourth traffic violation instead of merely
issuing to him a TVR, as usually done for the first, second and third violations.
Hence, the accused had the strongest temptation to erase the three violations
in the TVR in question and make it appear thereon that he committed only
one violation in order to escape arrest in case of a fourth traffic infraction.

273

Art. 172

The rule is that if a person had in his possession a falsified document
and he made use of it (uttered it) taking advantage of it and profiting thereby,
the presumption is that he is the material author of the falsification. (People
v. Sendaydiego, 81 SCRA 120)

Instance when presumption was not applied.

The fact that the petitioner prepared the voucher, considering
that it was his official duty to prepare the payroll, vouchers, and other
documents assigned to him is not a sufficient reason for the respondent
court to conclude that “there is no doubt that the forgery or falsification
was effected by the appellant.” Unfortunately, the respondent court
mistakenly applied the rule that: “one found in possession of and
who used a forged document is the forger or the one who caused the
forgery and, therefore, is guilty of falsification.” The accused is entitled
to the constitutional presumption of innocence specially where the
evidence on the alleged forged voucher is extremely doubtful. (Alonzo
v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 151 SCRA 552)
All the elements of falsification under paragraph 1, Article 172 are
present
Guillergan u. People
(G.R. No. 185493(2011])

Facts: Petitioner, a Lieutenant Colonel in the AFP and Comptroller
to the PC/INP Command in Region 6, directed the Chief Clerk of the
Comptrollers Office, to cause the preparation of the payrolls of their civilian
intelligence agents (CIAs) with supporting time record and book. The agents’
names were copied and, based on their appointment papers, certified as correct
by Petitioner and then approved by Brigadier General Rio.
Each time the processing unit returned the payrolls for lack of
signatures of the payees, Petitioner would direct Butcon, the Budget and
Fiscal Non-Commissioned Officer, to affix his initial on the Remarks! Sig
column of the payrolls to complete the requirements and facilitate the
processing of the time record, book, and payrolls.

Held: All the elements of falsification of documenta under paragraph
1, Article 172 are present in this case.

First. Petitioner was a public officer when he committed the offense
charged. His work as comptroller did not include the preparation of the
appointments and payrolls of CIAs. Nor did he have official custody of the
pertinent documents. His official function was limited to keeping the records
274

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Art. 172

of the resources that the command received from Camp Crame. Still, he took
the Liberty of intervening in the preparation of the time record, book, and
payrolls in question.
Second. Petitioner committed the offense charged by causing it to
appear that persons participated in an actor a proceeding when they did not
in fact so participate. He ordered Butcon to sign the receive portion of the
payrolls as payee to make it appear that persons whose names appeared on
the same had signed the document when they in fact did not.

Third. The falsification was committed on the time record, book, and
payrolls which were public documents.

Simulation of loan documents constitute falsification of commercial
and public documents.
Simulating OCBC loan documents - such as loan applications,
credit approval memorandums, and the resultant promissory notes
and other credit documents - by causing it to appear that persons
have participated in any act or proceeding when they did not in fact
so participate, and by counterfeiting or imitating their handwriting
or signatures constitute falsification of commercial and public
documents. (People v. Go, G.R. No. 191015, August 6, 2014)

In paragraph 1, Article 172, damage or intent to cause damage is
not necessary.

Note that in paragraph 1 of Article 172, as in Article 171, damage
or intent to cause damage to another is not necessary.
The element of gain or benefit on the part of the offender or
prejudice to a third party as a result of the falsification, or tarnishing
of a document’s integrity, is not essential to maintain a charge for
falsification of public documents. What is punished in falsification of
public document is principally the undermining of the public faith
and the destruction of truth as solemnly proclaimed therein. In this
particular crime, therefore, the controlling consideration lies in the
public character of a document; and the existence of any prejudice
caused to third persons or, at least, the intent to cause such damage
becomes immaterial. (Goma v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 168437,
January 8, 2009, citing Bustillo v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 146217,
April 7, 2006, 486 SCRA 545, 551, and Lastrilla v. Granda, G.R. No.

Luague u. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 55683, February 22, 1982, 112
SCRA 97, 101)
In the falsification of public or official documents, whether by
public officials or by private persons, it is not necessary that there
be present the idea of gain or the intent to cause damage to a third
person, for the reason that, in contradistinction to private documents,
the principal thing punished is the violation of the public faith and

the destruction of the truth as therein solemnly proclaimed. (Decision
of the Supreme Court of Spain of December 23, 1886, cited in People
v. Pacana, 47 Phil. 56)
The existence of a wrongful intent to injure a third person is not
necessary when the falsified document is a public document. (Siquian
v. People, 171 SCRA 223)

Note: This statement applies as well to commercial documents,
because as to this kind of document, a credit is sought to be protected.
Lack of malice or criminal intent is a defense in falsification of
public document

While it is true that falsification of a public document does not
require as an essential element, damage to a third person or intent
to cause such damage, signing the name of a deceased heir in a deed
of sale of a piece of land owned in common by several heirs, having
been done by the accused with the authority of the children of the
deceased heir, is not a punishable act of falsification, the accused not
having acted with malice. (People v. Unico, et al., CA., 56 O.G. 1681)
Falsification under paragraph 2 of Article 172.

Elements of falsification of private document:

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Art. 172

Mere falsification of private documents Is not enough.

If an individual falsified a receipt by counterfeiting the signature
of the creditor thereon and, after keeping it in his house for sometime,
without delivering or showing it to anyone, destroyed it, he did not
prejudice anyone by the mere fact of having made it.
Therefore, two things are required:
(1)

He must have counterfeited the false document.

(2)

He must have performed an independent act which operates
to the prejudice of a third person.

“With the intent to cause such damage” means that the offender
performs some other independent act in order to make use of it an
act which, while it does not result in prejudice to a third party, has
been done nevertheless with the intention of causing such prejudice.
(See U.S. v. Paraiso, 1 Phil. 127)

—

Damage need not be material.

The “perjuicio” caused to another in falsification of private
document need not be material. The law does not make any distinction
between “perjuicio” and “dano.” Damage to one’s honor is included.
(People v. Marasigan, G.R. No. 6040, October 18, 1940)
It is not necessary that the offender profited or hoped to profit by
the falsification.

Thus, although one of the offenders did not personally profit
from the falsification of the private document, he was liable, as all
that the law requires is an intent to prejudice another person. (U.S.
v. Infante, et al., 36 Phil. 146)

1.

That the offender committed any of the acts of falsification,
except those in paragraph 7, enumerated in Article 171.

Falsification of private document in Rizal and damage in Manila —
the court of Rizal has jurisdiction to try the case.

2.

That the falsification was committed in any private

In the instant case, wherein the appellant was charged with
having sent to the Bureau of Labor at Manila the letter (Exh. A)
alleged to have been falsified by him in Makati, Rizal, the intent to
cause damage must have co-existed with the act of falsification itself.
If that is so, then the offense, if at all committed, was consummated

3.

That the falsification caused damage to a third party or at
least the falsification was committed with intent to cause
such damage.

in Makati, Rizal, and the courts of which should assume jurisdiction
to try the same.

It will be absurd to suppose that while the act of falsifying took
place in Makati, Rizal, the element of intent to cause damage occurred
in Manila. To adopt this view would be virtually admitting that when
the act of falsifying was done in Makati, the element of intent to cause
damage was not present, in which case the crime of falsification of
private document could not have been committed, because this crime
can exist only if both the fact of falsifying and the intent to cause
damage concur. (People v. Morales, C.A., 58 O.G. 5667)
Falsification as a necessary means to commit other crimes.

When the offender commits on a document any of the acts of
falsification enumerated in Article 171 as a necessary means to
commit another crime, like estafa, theft or malversation, the two
crimes form a complex crime under Article 48. However, the document
falsified must be public, official or commercial.
The falsification of a public, official or commercial
document may be a means of committing estafa, because before the
falsified document is actually utilized to defraud another, the crime
of falsification has already been consummated, damage or intent to
cause damage not being an element of the crime of falsification of
public, official or commercial document. (Intestate Estate of Manolita
Gonzales Vda. de Carungcong v. People, G.R. No. 181409, February
11, 2010) In other words, the crime of falsification has already existed.
Actually utilizing that falsified public, official or commercial document
to defraud another is estafa. But the damage to another is caused
by the commission of estafa, not by the falsification of the document,
Therefore, the falsification of the public, official or commercial
document is only a necessary means to commit the estafa.
On the other hand, in the falsification of a private document,
there is no crime unless another fact, independent of that of falsifying
the document, is proved: i.e., damage or intent to cause it. Therefore,
when one makes use of a private document, which he falsified, to
defraud another, there results only one crime: that of falsification of a
private document. The damage to another is caused by the commission
of the crime of falsification of private document. The intent to defraud
in using the falsified private document is part and parcel of the crime,

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

and cannot give rise to the crime of estafa, because the damage, if
it resulted, was caused by, and became the element of, the crime of
falsification of private document. The crime of estafa in such case was
not committed, as it could not exist without its own element of damage.
Estafa through falsification of a public document.
1. A person who counterfeits or imitates the signatures of
the officials named in a traffic police sticker issued to the holder of
a certificate of public convenience as a sort of road or bridge pass is
liable for the crime of falsification under Article 172, paragraph 1, the
sticker being a public document. If he sells such falsified sticker, he
is liable for estafa through falsification of a public document. (People
v. Asistio, 59 O.G. 8625)

2. The accused who, not being the owner of a piece of land,
made it appear in a deed of sale acknowledged before a notary public
that he was the owner thereof and that as owner, he sold and conveyed
it unto a third person who paid to him the purchase price of the land,
to the prejudice of the offended party, is guilty of the complex crime
of estafa through falsification of a public document.(People v. Paguio,
et al., CA., 45 O.G. 2551)
3. Milla misrepresented himself to have the authority to sell
the subject property, and it was precisely this misrepresentation that
prompted MPI to purchase it. Because of its reliance on his authority
and on the falsified Deed of Absolute Sale and TCT No. 218777, MPI
parted with its money in the amount of P2 million, which has not been
returned. Clearly, he is guilty of estafa through falsification of public
documents. (Milla v. People, G.R. No. 188726, January 25, 2012)
Theft through falsification of official document

The accused took P36,480.30 with grave abuse of confidence
by forging the signature of officers authorized to sign the subject
check and depositing the check in the account of Firebrake Sales and
Services, a fictitious payee without any legitimate transaction with
Metrobank. The fact that accused as assistant cashier of Metrobank
had custody of the aforesaid checks and had access not only in the
preparation but also in the release of Metrobank cashier s checks
suffices to designate the crime as qualified theft as he gravely abused
the confidence reposed in him by the bank as assistant cashier.
279

278

Art. 172

Art. 172

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

In addition, forging the signatures of the bank officers authorized to
sign the subject cashiers check was resorted to in order to obtain the

sum of P36.480.30 for the benefit of the accused. Falsification of the
subject cashier’s check was a necessary means to commit the crime
of qualified theft resulting in a complex crime. The accused is guilty
of the crime of qualified theft through falsification of commercial
document. (People v. Salonga, G.R. No. 131131, June 21, 2001)
Having somehow obtained an official form of purchase order,
certain employees of a military depot filled its blanks and placed

thereon the initial RBR of a member of the U.S. Army in charge of
approving the issuance of purchase orders. Through the falsified

purchase order and a pass, the offenders were able to obtain goods
which they loaded on the truck. The acts of falsification consisted in
making untruthful statement in a narration of facts and causing it
to appear that Raymond B. Russel, the one in charge of approving
the issuance of purchase orders and to whose name correspond the
initials RBR, initialed and approved the falsified purchase order.
The falsification of the purchase order, an official document, was a
necessary means to commit the crime of theft. (People v. Sison, et al.,
CA., 44 O.G. 3354)
Estafa through falsification of commercial document

Tanenggee u. People
(GJi. No. 179448, June 26, 2013)

Facts: On different occasions, appellant caused to be prepared

promissory notes and cashier’s checks in the name of Tan, a valued bank

client, in connection with the purported loans obtained by the latter from the
bank. Appellant approved and signed the cashier’s check as branch manager
of Metrobank Commercio Branch. Appellant affixed, forged or caused to be
signed the signature of Tan as endorser and payee of the proceeds of the checks
at the back of the same to show that the latter had indeed endorsed the same
for payment. He handed the checks to the Loans clerk for encashment. Once
said documents were forged and falsified, appellant released and obtained
from Metrobank the proceeds of the alleged loan and misappropriated the
same to his use and benefit.

Held: When the offender commits on a public, official or commercial
document any of the acts of falsification enumerated in Article 171 as a
necessary means to commit another crime like estafa, theft or malversation,
the two crimes form a complex crime.

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

The elements of falsification of commercial documents have been

established. First, petitioner is a private individual. Second, the acts of
falsification consisted in petitioner’s (1) counterfeiting or imitating the
handwriting or signature of Tan and causing it to appear that the same is
true and genuine in all respects; and (2) causing it to appear that Tan has
participated in an act or proceeding when he did not in fact so participate.
Third, the falsification was committed in promissory notes and checks which
are commercial documents. The elements of estafa also obtain in this case.
By falsely representing that Tan requested him to process purported loans on
the latter’s behalf, petitioner counterfeited or imitated the signature of Tan
in the cashier’s checks. Through these, petitioner succeeded in withdrawing
money from the bank. Once in possession of the amount, petitioner thereafter
invested the same in Eurocan Future Commodities. Clearly, petitioner
employed deceit in order to take hold of the money, misappropriated and
converted it to his own personal use and benefit, and these resulted to the
damage and prejudice of the bank in the amount of about P43 million.

Taken in its entirety, the proven facts show that petitioner could not
have withdrawn the money without falsifying the questioned documenta.
The falsification was, therefore, a necessary means to commit estafa, and
falsification was already consummated even before the falsified documents
were used to defraud the bank. The conviction of petitioner for the complex
crime of Estafa through Falsification of Commercial Document by the lower
courts was thus proper.

Estafa through falsification of commercial document by reckless
imprudence.

Upon request of his former classmate, the accused endorsed
two Philippine National Bank checks by way of identification of the
signatures of the supposed payees on the back thereof, even if he did
not know them. The checks were cashed by the wrong persons who
misappropriated the proceeds thereof.
Held: Even assuming that the accused had no intention to defraud
the offended party, his participation together with the participation
of his co-accused in the commission of the offense completed all
the elements necessary for the perpetration of the complex crime
of estafa through falsification of commercial document. His acts of
endorsing the checks by way of identification of the signatures of
the payees entitled to said checks and proceeds, constituted written
representation that the true payees participated in the endorsement
and cashing of the checks, when in truth and in fact the true payees
had no direct intervention in the proceedings, as it turned out that
281

280

Art. 172

Art. 172

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

the checks were delivered to the wrong parties. The accused did not
take proper and adequate means to assure himself of the identity of
the real claimants as an ordinary prudent man would do. (Samson
v. Court of Appeals, et al., 103 Phil. 277)

In the case of People v. Castillo,et al., CA-G.R. No. 14352-R, April
28, 1956, the Court of Appeals held that there being no evidence that
the accused acted with malice in identifying as the payee of the check
a person whom he did not know, and there being no evidences that
he shared in the proceeds of the check, he was guilty of the crime of
falsification of a commercial document through reckless imprudence,
not estafa through falsification by reckless imprudence.
Malversation through falsification of public document.

A special deputy of the provincial treasurer, an accountable
public officer, who altered the duplicates ofcedulas, collected the sum
of P2.00 from each of the taxpayers to whom they were issued, and
misappropriated the money collected, a public fund, was held liable
for the complex crime of malversation through falsification of the
duplicates of cedulas, which are public documents. (U.S. v. Barbas
60 Phil. 241)
There is no complex crime of estafa through falsification of a private
document.

There is no complex crime of estafa through falsification of a
private document, because the immediate effect of falsification of
private document is the same as that of estafa. The falsification of
a private document cannot be said to be a means to commit estafa,
because the fraudulent gain obtained through deceit in estafa, in the
commission of which a private document was falsified, is nothing
more nor less than the very damage caused by the falsification of

such document.

If a private document is falsified to obtain from the offended party
the money or other personal property which the offender later
misappropriated, the crime committed is falsification of private
document only.

In a case, the accused was in charge of entering the laborers’
workdays in the time book of the Calamba Sugar Estate. He falsified
the time book, a private document, by making it appear that a

TITLE FOUR
Crimea Against Public Interest

laborer, Ciriaco Sario, worked 21 days during the month of July
1929, when in reality he had worked only 11 days, and then charged
the offended party, the Calamba Sugar Estate, the wages of said
laborer for 21 days. The accused misappropriated the wages for 10
days during which the laborer did not work. It will be noted that in
this case, the accused had to falsify the private document to obtain
the laborer’s wages for 10 days. He was convicted of falsification of
private document. (People v. Reyes, 56 Phil. 286)

The accused who changed the description of the pawned article
as it appeared on the face of the pawn ticket and substituted therefor
the description of another article of greatly superior value, and
thereafter the falsified ticket was itself pawned in another pawnshop
for an amount largely in excess of the true value of the article pawned,
is guilty of falsification of a private document only, not estafa through
falsification. (U.S. v. Infante, et al., 36 Phil. 146)
If a private document is falsified to conceal the misappropriation
of the money or other personal property which has been In the
possession of the offender, the crime committed is estafa with
abuse of confidence only.

Thus, the manager of the sales department of the “La Tondena”
who made it appear in the issue vouchers that the quality, quantity
and price of goods sold by him were less than they actually were,
turning over to the cashier the lesser amount and appropriating for
himself the difference, is guilty only of estafa with abuse of confidence,
not a complex crime of estafa through falsification of a commercial
document, because the issue vouchers are not commercial documents,
they not being defined and regulated by any commercial law. The
issue vouchers are private documents. There is no complex crime of
estafa through falsification of a private document. (People v. Co Beng,
CA., 40 O.G. 1913)

Note: If the estafa was already consummated at the time of the
falsification of the private document, or if the falsification of a private
document was committed for the purpose of concealing the estafa, the
falsification is not punishable, because as regards the falsification of
the private document, there was no damage or intent to cause damage.
The limited damage that resulted was caused by the commission of
estafa, not by the falsification of the private document.

Falsification through reckless Imprudence.
The director of a hospital who, having a contract with the
Philippine Veterans Board, for the cure and hospitalization of sick
veterans at the rate of P10.00 a day per patient, signed a bill wherein
it appeared that a patient was hospitalized for 31 days when said
patient was confined there for only six days and collected P310.00,
relying entirely upon his personnel’s reports, without in any way
checking them or having someone check them for him is guilty of
falsification through reckless imprudence. (People v. Banas, CA-G.R.
No. 11761-R, May 31, 1955)

But in a case where the chief clerk of the municipal treasurer’s
office, acting as local civil registrar, signed a certified copy of a record
of birth prepared and initialed by a clerk in the office, who was the
custodian of the register of births, and it turned out that the said copy
contained falsities, it was held that the chief clearly was not guilty
of falsification through reckless imprudence, because he had a right
to rely on his subordinate employee and it was not necessary for him
to compare the copy with the original entry in the registry of births.
(El Pueblo de las Islas Filipinos contra Amado L. Mendoza, CA-G.R.
No. 7658, Marzo 24, 1942; Abril 1942, O.G. 189)
There is no falsification of private document through reckless
imprudence.

Since in falsification of a private document, there is at least
intent to cause damage, that is, there must be malice, and falsification
through imprudence implies lack of such intent or malice, there is no
such crime as falsification of a private document through negligence
or reckless imprudence.
When the private document was falsified before It becomes part
of official record.

The accused, municipal president, bought a typewriter as a
private person for the use of the municipality and paid $90 for which
the vendor issued a receipt. Later, the accused, as a private person,
sought reimbursement, prepared the corresponding voucher and
attached thereto the receipt. The receipt was altered by raising the
amount to $95. The accused was found guilty of falsification of private

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

document only, because at the time the receipt was falsified, it was
not yet a part of the public or official record, nor was it certified by
any person authorized to certify public documents. The receipt and
the voucher did not emanate from any public office. (U.S. v. Nieto,
5 Phil. 582)
The crime is falsification of a public document, even If the

falsification took place before the private document becomes part
of the public records.
Although the minutes of the organization-meeting was a private
document when it was certified and attested to by the appellants,
nevertheless, it became a public document upon its filing with the
Department of Labor. The fact that its falsification took place before
it became part of the public records is immaterial. (People v. Leonidas,
40 O.G. [4th Supp.] 101; People u. Area, et al., CA., 56 O.G. 297)

It seems that if the document is intended by law to be part
of the public or official record, the preparation of which being in
accordance with the rules and regulations issued by the Government,
the falsification of that document, although it was a private document
at the time of its falsification, is regarded as falsification of a public
or official document.
This is the ruling in the cases of U.S. v. Asensi, 34 Phil. 750,
and People v. Leonidas, et al., CA., supra. In the Asensi case, the
falsification was made on a blank form of the Bureau of Internal
Revenue, and in the Leonidas case, the falsification consisted in the
accused Tupas taking the civil service examination and feigning to
be the examinee Leonidas. When the falsifications were committed,
the documents were not yet part of public or official record and the
offenders were private persons.

Difference between falsification of public or official documents and
that of private documents.
The essential difference between falsification of private
documents and that of public or official documents lies in the fact
that while in the former, the prejudice to a third party is primarily
taken into account so that if such damage is not apparent, or there
is at least no intention to cause it, the falsification is not punishable,
285

284

Art. 172

Art 172

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

in the latter, that is, in the falsification of public or official documents
the principal thing punished is the violation of public faith and the
perversion of truth which the document solemnly proclaims, and for
this reason, it is immaterial whether or not some prejudice has been
caused to third persons. fSee People v. Pacana, 47 Phil. 48)
Generally, falsification has no attempted or frustrated stage.

Falsification is consummated the moment the genuine document
is altered or the moment the false document is executed. It is
immaterial that the offender did not achieve his objectives.
There may be frustrated crime of falsification, if the falsification
is imperfect. (II Cuello Calon, Codigo Penal, 10th Ed., pp. 247-248)
Use of falsified document (last paragraph of Article 172).

Elements of use of falsified document:

Introducing in a judicial proceeding —
1.

That the offender knew that a document was falsified by another
person.

2.

That the false document is embraced in Article 171 or in any
subdivisions No. 1 or 2 of Article 172.

3.

That he introduced said document in evidence in any judicial

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Damage is not necessary in the crime of introducing in judicial

proceeding a false document.
Damage to another is not indispensable nor does it have to

concur with the very act of introducing a falsified document injudicial
proceeding. The phrase “or to the damage of another or who, with the
intent to cause such damage,” refers to the use of the false document
in a proceeding not judicial.

In the crime of introducing a falsified document in a judicial
proceeding, as defined and penalized under the last paragraph
of Article 172 of the R.P.C., the element of damage to another is
not indispensable nor does it have to concur with the very act of
introduction of the falsified document in the judicial proceeding. The
element of damage to another is a requisite only when the falsified
document is introduced in evidence in a proceeding other than judicial.
(People v. Prudente, 1 CA. Rep. 759)
Use of falsified document in proceeding not judicial, requires at
least intent to cause damage.

When a falsified document is used in proceeding other than
judicial, damage or, at least, intent to cause damage is essential.
The accused who purchased tires from the Firestone Rubber
Co. and in payment therefor gave a check drawn from the Philippine
National Bank, knowing that the check was false, is guilty of using a
falsified document in a proceeding not judicial. (People v. Astudillo,
60 Phil. 338)
The person who used the falsified document is not the one who
falsified the document. If the one who used the falsified document is
the same person who falsified it, the crime is only falsification and
the use of the same is not a separate crime.

Use of false document is not necessarily included in the crime of
falsification.
The crime punished in the last paragraph of Article 172 of the
R.P.C. may be a lesser offense, but it certainly cannot be deemed
necessarily included in the crime of falsification of a public document
by a public officer or employee or by a private person. (People v.
Mendoza, 93 Phil. 581)

The user of the falsified document is deemed the author of the
falsification, if (1) the use was so closely connected in time with
the falsification, and (2) the user had the capacity of falsifying the
document.
Thus, in a case where the blank form, wherein the falsified
check was written, was stolen from a book of blank checks between
12:00 noon on December 1, 1903, and 11:00 a.m. of the following
day, when the check was presented by the accused for payment, and
the accused, who was a clerk in the office of the person by whom
the check was purported to be drawn, was alone in the office on the
evening of December 1, it was held that as the uttering of the check
was so closely connected in time with the forging, the accused should
be considered the forger thereof. He was guilty of falsification of
commercial document, not merely of using a falsified document. (U.S.
v. Castillo, 6 Phil. 453)

the service of sending or receiving wireless, cable or telephone
message.

2.

That the offender commits any of the following acts:
(a)

Uttering fictitious wireless, cable, telegraph or telephone
message; or

(b)

Falsifying wireless, cable, telegraph, or telephone message.

The public officer, to be liable, must be engaged in the service
of sending or receiving wireless, cable, telegraph or telephone
message.

The officer or employee of the Government, to be liable, must
be engaged in the service of sending or receiving wireless, cable,
telegraph or telephone messages, like the telegraph operator of the
Bureau of Posts or the operator of Government telephone.
Example of falsifying telegraph message.

The accused, a telegraph operator, who received two telegrams
for transmission, reduced the number of words of the telegraph
messages by 12 and eight words, respectively, without having been
authorized to do so by the sender. He pocketed the differences in the
prices charged in the sums of P0.72 and P0.48, respectively.
Held: The accused was guilty of falsification of telegraph
messages. (U.S. v. Romero, 1 7 Phil. 76)

A private individual cannot commit the crime of falsification
of telegraphic dispatches by direct participation, unless he is an
employee of a corporation engaged in the business of sending or
receiving wireless, telegraph or telephone messages.

But a private individual can be held criminally liable as principal
by inducement in the falsification of telegraph dispatches or telephone
messages.

But if he knowingly uses any falsified telegraph, wireless or
telephone messages to the prejudice of a third person, or with intent
to cause such prejudice, it is not necessary that he be connected with

Example of falsification of certificate of merit

In an application to the Civil Service Board for examination
a document printed in accordance with the form prescribed by said
Board, and in that part thereof which contained recommendations of
the applicant, certificate No. 3 appeared to be subscribed by Frank N.
West, the latter having neither subscribed it nor written the contents
thereof, the same not being correct in some respects, viz., as regards
the age of the party certifying and the length of time during which he
knew the candidate recommended. (See U.S. v. Michelena, 4 Phil. 492)
The falsification of the certificate of large cattle is not now covered

by Article 174.

Certificate of large cattle is a public document and its falsification
is covered by Article 171 or Article 172, depending on whether the
offender is a public officer or a private individual.
The ruling in the cases of U.S. v. Sayson, 6 Phil. 382, and U.S. v.
Dumandan, 8 Phil. 61, was based on Article 310 of the old Penal Code,
which punished “a public official who shall issue a false certificate of
merit or service or of good conduct, of property,” etc. In view of the
omission of the words “of property” in paragraph No. 2 of Article 174,
it is doubted that certificates of large cattle are covered by Article 174.
The phrase “or similar circumstances” in Article 174 does not
seem to cover property, because the circumstance contemplated must
be similar to “merit,” “service,” or “good conduct.”
But certificate of residence for voting purposes is certificate of

“similar circumstances.”

Thus, a person who falsely stated under oath that he was a
resident of the town of Jimenez for the required period of time, so as
to be able to take part in the municipal elections,
was found guilty of
falsification of a certificate, not of falsification of a public document.

(As amended by RA. No. 379)

Two offenses are contemplated in Article 177.

There are two ways of committing this crime. The first act
constitutes the crime of usurpation of authority, while the latter act
constitutes the crime of usurpation of official functions. ( Gigantoni v.
People, No. L-74727, June 16, 1988, 162 SCRA 158, 162-163)
Two ways of committing the crime under Article 177:
1.

By knowingly and falsely representing oneself to be an officer,
agent or representative of any department or agency of the
Philippine Government or any foreign government.

Note that in usurpation of authority, the mere act of
knowingly and falsely representing oneself to be an officer, etc. is
'See Appendix “A," Table of Penalties, No. 14.
296

2.

By performing any act pertaining to any person in authority
or public officer of the Philippine Government or of a foreign
government or any agency thereof, under pretense of official
position, and without being lawfully entitled to do so.
Note that in usurpation of official functions, it is essential
that the offender should have performed an act pertaining
to a person in authority or public officer, in addition to other
requirements.

There must be positive, express and explicit representation.

The law demands positive, express and explicit representation
on the part of the offender before he can be convicted of usurpation
of authority. The crime is not committed if the accused merely did
not deny that he was an agent of the Philippine Government when
introduced as such by public officials who responded to the intrigues
of one Jose B. Lazaro. (People v. Calinisan, 8 CA. Rep. 20)
The offender (1) should have represented himself to be an officer,
agent or representative of any department or agency of the
government; or (2) should have performed an act pertaining to a
person in authority or public officer.

Thus, the accused who falsely represented himself to the owner
a
of carinderia that he was a safety officer of the Philippine Board of
Safety and as such he had authority to demand for examination of
the payroll and/or records of sales, is not liable under Article 177, as
amended, it appearing that the Philippine Board of Safety was not
a public corporation with authority over merchant’s books including
sales book and payroll. Not being a public corporation, it was not a
department or an agency of the Philippine Government. Hence, in
representing himself to be a safety officer of the Philippine Board of
Safety, even though the representation was false and he knew it to
be false, the accused did not knowingly and falsely represent himself
to be an officer, agent or representative of any department or agency
of the Philippine Government, or perform any act pertaining to a
person in authority or public officer of the Philippine Government.
(See People v. Belarmino, CA., supra)

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

False representation may be shown by acts.

It is not necessary that the offender should falsely represent
himself to be an officer, agent or representative of any department or
agency of the government. Thus, even in the absence of evidence that
the accused represented himself as a police officer, his acts in blowing
his whistle, stopping buses and ordering drivers to step down their
passenger vehicles and produce their driver’s licenses, sufficiently
establish his culpability for the crime of usurpation of official functions
under Article 177 of the R.P.C. (People v. Reyes, CA., 70 O.G. 7801)
Article 177 may be violated by a public officer.
People v. Hilvano
(99 Phil. 655)

Facts: When the Mayor of Villareal, Samar, departed for Manila
on official business on September 22, 1952, he designated the defendant
councilor to discharge the duties of his office. Later, during office hours of
that same day, the Vice Mayor went to the municipal building; and having
found the defendant acting in the place of the Mayor, he served written
notices to the corresponding municipal officers, including the defendant that
he as Vice Mayor was assuming the duties of the absent Mayor. However,
the defendant refused to yield, arguing that he had been designated by
the Mayor. Whereupon, the Vice Mayor sent a telegram to the Executive
Secretary informing the latter of the controversy. And the said Secretary
replied by letter, that under Section 2195 of the Revised Administrative
Code, it was the Vice Mayor who should discharge the duties of the Mayor
during the latter’s temporary absence. Shown this official pronouncement,
the defendant still refused to surrender the position. Again the Vice Mayor
sought the opinion of the Provincial Fiscal, who by letter replied that the
Vice Mayor had the right to the office. Notwithstanding such opinion, which
was exhibited to him, the defendant declined to vacate the post, which he
held for about a month, appointing some policemen, solemnizing marriages
and collecting the corresponding salary for mayor. He was charged with
usurpation of authority and official functions under Article 177 of the R.P.C.,
as amended by R.A. No. 379.

It was contended, however, for the defendant that he committed
no usurpation of authority because he was a councilor, an official of the
Government, and that such crime may only be committed by private

individuals.

Held: There is actually no reason to restrict the operation of Article 177
to private individuals. For one thing, it applies to “any person”; and when the
law does not distinguish, [the] [Court] should not distinguish. Furthermore,

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

contrary to appellant’s assumption that Articles 238-241 of the R.P.C. penalize
all kinds of usurpation of official function by public officers, said articles
merely punish interference by officers of one of the three departments of

government (legislative, executive and judicia[ry]) with functions of officials
of another department. Said articles do not cover usurpation of one officer or

employee of a given department of the powers of another officer in the same
department. For instance, the exercise by a bureau employee of the power
of his director.

There is no excuse for the defendant. In the beginning he might have
pleaded good faith, invoking the designation by the Mayor; but after he had
been shown the letter of the Executive Secretary and the opinion of the
Provincial Fiscal, he has no right thereafter stubbornly to stick to the position.

Article 177, as amended, does not apply to occupant under color
of title.

Article 177 of the R.P.C., as amended, punishes the usurper or
one who acts under false pretenses and not the occupant under color
of title. A usurper is “one who introduces himself into an office that
is vacant, or who, without color of title, ousts the incumbent and
assumes to act as an officer by exercising some of the functions of the
office.” (People v. Buenaflor, et al., CA., 72 O.G. 364)
Article 177, as amended, punishes usurpation of authority or official
functions of any officer of any foreign government.

Note that the offenses defined and penalized in Article 177, as
amended, may be committed by knowingly and falsely representing
oneself to be an officer, agent or representative of any department or
agency of any foreign government; and by performing, under pretense
of official position and without being lawfully entitled to do so, any act
pertaining to any person in authority or public officer of any foreign
government, or any agency thereof.
Additional penalty for usurping the authority of diplomatic or
consular or any other official of a foreign government

Section 1 of R.A. No. 75 punishes any person who shall falsely
assume and take upon himself to act as a diplomatic, consular, or any
other official of a foreign government duly accredited as such to the
Government of the Republic of the Philippines with intent to defraud
such foreign government or the Government of the Philippines.

R.A. No. 10.

R.A. No. 10, which was enacted on September 2, 1946, provides
aa follows:
"See. 1. Any person who with or without pretense of official
position, shall perform any act pertaining to the Government,
or to any person in authority or public officer, without being
lawfully entitled to do so, shall be punished with imprisonment
for not less than two years, nor more than ten years.”
The act performed, without the offender being lawfully entitled to
do so, must pertain (1) to the Government, or (2) to any person In
authority, or (3) to any public officer.

To be chargeable and punishable under Section 1 of R.A. No.
10, one must perform any act pertaining (1) to the Government, or
(2) to any person in authority, or (3) to any public officer,
without being
lawfully entitled to do so. Now, the question is
has the accused
performed such an Act? As per the aforequoted information, the act
allegedly committed by accused consisted in having appointed and
issued identification cards designating Gregorio Noval and Moises
E. Robie as Sergeants, Inf. 12 Sampaguita II, 1st Div-A, under the
ANDERSON FIL-AMERICAN GUERRILLAS (AFAG), without
being lawfully entitled to do so. If it is the point of the prosecution
that the act just mentioned allegedly committed by accused pertains
(1) to the Government, or (2) to any person
in authority, or (3) to any
public officer
the prosecution has not bothered to show or even
to intimate any law, executive order or legal decree authorizing the
Government to perform such an act, much less the government agency,
person in authority or public officer who actually performs the same.
For illustration, if one is charged with the usurpation of authority
to solemnize marriage or to effect an arrest, it is understood that,
under the law, only judges and law enforcement agents, among others,
are authorized to perform said acts. But in the instant cases, as just
adverted to, the prosecution has not even intimated what government

agency, person in authority or public official is by law authorized to
appoint and issue identification cards designating Gregorio Noval
and Moises E. Robie as sergeants, etc., under the said AFAG. In the
absence of any specification of such government agency, person in
authority or public official what public authority could the accused
have, or had he, allegedly usurped? [The Court] ha[s] searched in vain
for the answer to this question in the prosecution’s theory of the case.

engaged In subverelve activities.
People v. Lidree
(O.R. No. L-12495, July 26, 1960)
Facte: To fill up the vacancy expected to be created by the maternity
leave of one Magdalena P. Echavez, a public school teacher, Josita Diotay
and defendant Dionisio Lidres filed their respective applications as substitute
teachere. Diotay was recommended by the supervising teacher to fill up the
position. However, he (supervising teacher) requested Diotay to sign an
agreement, wherein both Diotay and defendant agreed to take over Echavez’
position on a “50-50” basis, i.e., the period from January to March 1954
would be equally divided between them. Thereafter, Diotay began teaching
on January 4, 1954. On February 12, 1954, apparently on the strength of
the agreement, defendant appeared at the school, armed with a prepared
letter of resignation for the signature of Diotay. Diotay refused to resign.
So, on February 22, 1954, defendant went to the classroom where Diotay
was conducting her classes, and against the latter’s will took over the class.

Held: Examination of the discussion of House Bill No. 126, which
became R.A. No. 10, discloses indisputably that said Act was really intended
as an emergency measure, to cope with the abnormal situation created by the
subversive activities of seditious organizations at the time of its passage in
September 1946. Hence, the elimination of the element of pretense of official
position required under Article 177 of the R.P.C. And since it is neither
alleged in the information nor proved during the trial that defendant is
a member of a seditious organization engaged in subversive activities, he
could not be held liable or found guilty under said provision ofR.A. No. 10.
Granting, arguendo, that R.A. No. 10 is an amendment to Article 177, and
not merely an implementation thereof, the subsequent enactment of RA.
No. 379, effective June 14, 1949, would constitute an amendment thereof
by restoring the element of pretense of official position in the offense of
usurpation of official functions. Under R.A. No. 379 then, the law in force at
the time of the commission of the alleged offense by defendant, pretense of
official position is an essential element of the crime of usurpation of official

the offense “without pretense of official position.” Under the circumstances
the facts alleged in the information fail to constitute an offense.

convicted by final judgment, he is guilty of using a fictitious name
punishable under Article 178, and not of evasion of the service of the
sentence, because the real convict alone is guilty thereof. (Albert)

It seems that such person is also liable for delivering prisoners
from jail under Article 156, by helping the escape of the real convict
by other means.
The prisoner who is replaced must necessarily use the name of
another, and in this case he is also guilty of using a fictitious name
to evade the execution of the judgment against him. And the one who
takes his place has to use a fictitious name to conceal the crime of
delivering a prisoner from jail.
II.

Elements (concealing true name):

1.

That the offender conceals

2.

—

a.

his true name; and

b.

all other personal circumstances.

That the purpose is only to conceal his identity.

Distinction between use of fictitious name and concealing true
name.
(a) In use of fictitious name, the element of publicity must be present;
in concealing true name and other personal circumstances, that
element is not necessary.
(b) The purpose in use of fictitious name is any of those three
enumerated (to conceal a crime, to evade the execution of a
judgment, or to cause damage); in concealing true name it is
merely to conceal identity.

Art. 178

Use of unregistered aliases.

Commonwealth Act No. 142, regulating the use of aliases was
amended by R.A. No. 6085, which provides:
“SECTION 1. Except as pseudonym solely for literary, cinema
television, radio or other entertainment purposes and in athletic
events where the use of pseudonym is a normally accepted practice
no person shall use any name different from the one with which he
was registered at birth in the office of the local civil registry, or with
which he was registered in the bureau of immigration upon entry; or
such substitute name as may have been authorized by a competent
court: Provided, That persons, whose births have not been registered
in any local civil registry and who have not been baptized, have one
year from the approval of this Act within which to register their names
in the civil registry of their residence. The name shall comprise the
patronymic name and one or two surnames.
SEC. 2. Any person desiring to use an alias shall apply for
authority therefor in proceedings like those legally provided to ohKa in
judicial authority for a change of name, and no person shall be allowed
to secure such judicial authority for more than one alias. The petition
for an alias shall set forth the person’s baptismal and family name and
the name recorded in the civil registry, if different, his immigrant’s
name, if an alien, and his pseudonym, if he has such names other
than his original or real name, specifying the reason or reasons for
the use ofthe desired alias. The judicial authority for the use of alias,
the Christian name and the alien’s immigrant name shall be recorded
in the proper local civil registry, and no person shall use any name
or names other than his original or real name unless the same is or
are duly recorded in the proper local civil registry.
SEC. 3. No person having been baptized with a name different
from that with which he was registered at birth in the local civil
registry, or in case of an alien, registered in the bureau of immigration
upon entry, or any person who obtained judicial authority to use an
alias, or who uses a pseudonym, shall represent himself in any public
or private transaction or shall sign or execute any public or private
document without stating or affixing his real or original name and
all names or aliases or pseudonym he is or may have been authorized

to use.

SEC. 4. Six months from the approval of this Act and subject to
of section 1 hereof, all persons who have used any name
provisions
the
and/or name and alias or aliases different from those authorized in
section one of this Act and duly recorded in the local civil registry, shall
be prohibited to use such other name or names and/or alias or aliases.
SEC. 5. Any violation of this Act shall be punished with
imprisonment of from one year to five years and a fine of P5,000 to
PIO,000.
XXX.”

R.A. No. 6085 was approved on August 4, 1969.
The enactment of C.A. No. 142 as amended was made primarily
to curb the common practice among the Chinese of adopting scores
of different names and abases which created tremendous confusion
in the field of trade. Such a practice almost bordered on the crime
of using fictitious names which for obvious reasons could not be
successfully maintained against the Chinese who, rightly or wrongly,
claimed they possessed a thousand and one names. C.A. No. 142 thus
penalized the act of using an alias name, unless such alias was duly
authorized by proper judicial proceedings and recorded in the civil
register. (Ursua v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 112170, April 10, 1996,
256 SCRA 147, 155)
Law on Illegal Use of Alias - Intent to publicly use the alias must
be manifest

The rule in the law of libel - that mere communication to a third
person is publicity does not apply to violations of C.A. No. 142. Our
close reading of Ursua particularly, the requirement that there be
intention by the user to be culpable and the historical reasons we cited
above tells us that the required publicity in the use of alias is more
than mere communication to a third person; the use of the alias, to
be considered public, must be made openly, or in an open manner or
place, or to cause it to become generally known. In order to be held
liable for a violation of C.A. No. 142, the user of the alias must have
held himself out as a person who shall publicly be known under that
other name. In other words, the intent to publicly use the alias must
be manifest.

Art. 178

To [the Court’s] mind, the presence of Lacquian and Chua when
Estrada signed as Jose Velarde and opened Trust Account No. C-163
does not necessarily indicate his intention to be publicly known
henceforth as Jose Velarde. In relation to Estrada, Lacquian and Chua
were not part of the public who had no access to Estrada’s privacy
and to the confidential matters that transpired in Malacafiang where
he sat as President; Lacquian was the Chief of Staff with whom he
shared matters of the highest and strictest confidence, while Chua was
a lawyer-friend bound by his oath of office and ties of friendship to keep
and maintain the privacy and secrecy of his affairs. Thus, Estrada
could not be said to have intended his signing as Jose Velarde to be
for public consumption by the fact alone that Lacquian and Chua were
also inside the room at that time. The same holds true for Estrada’s
alleged representations with Ortaliza and Dichavez, assuming the
evidence for these representations to be admissible. All of Estrada’s
representations to these people were made in privacy and in secrecy,
with no iota of intention of publicity. (People u. Estrada, et al., G.R.
Nos. 164368-69, April 2, 2009)
Example of violation of the Anti-Alias Law.

Aside from the name “Ong Hick Lian,” appellee is using the
alias “Julian Ong.” There is no evidence that appellee has been
baptized with the later name or that he has been known by it since
childhood, or that the court has authorized the use thereof. Appellee
has, therefore, committed a violation of the Anti-Alias Law. (Hock
Lian v. Republic, 17 SCRA 188)
No violation of Anti-Alias Law.

Respondent’s aliases involved the names “Eugenio Gonzalez”,
“Eugenio Gonzales”, “Eugenio Juan Gonzalez”, “Eugenio Juan
Gonzalez y Regalado”, “Eugenio C.R. Gonzalez”, “Eugenio J.
Gonzalez”, and per complainant “Eugenio Juan Robles Gonzalez."
These names contained his true names, albeit at times joined with
an erroneous middle or second name, or a misspelled family name
in one instance. The records disclose that the erroneous middle or
second names, or the misspelling of the family name resulted from
error or inadvertence left unchecked and unrectified over time. What
is significant, however, is that such names were not fictitious names
within the purview of the Anti-Alias Law; and that such names

were not different from each other. Considering that he was not
also shown to have used the names for unscrupulous purposes, or to
deceive or confuse the public, the dismissal of the charge against him
for violation of the Anti-Alias Law was justified in fact and in law.
(Limson v. Gonzalez, G.R. No. 162205, March 31, 2014)
P.D. No. 1829 penalizes obstruction of justice by publicly using a
fictitious name and concealing true name, among other acts.
The penalty of prision correctional in its maximum period, or a
fine ranging from Pl,000 to P6,000, or both, shall be imposed upon
any person who knowingly or willfully obstructs, impedes, frustrates
or delays the apprehension of suspects and the investigation and
prosecution of criminal cases by publicly using a fictitious name
for the purpose of concealing a crime, evading prosecution or the
execution of a judgment, or concealing his true name and other
personal circumstances for the same purpose or purposes. (Sec. l[d],
P.D. No. 1829)

P.D. No. 1829 imposes a higher penalty than the R.P.C. for
publicly using a fictitious name and concealing true name. P.D. No.
1829 also has the following additional elements:
1. For publicly using a fictitious name and concealing true
name: The offender must knowingly or willfully obstruct, impede,
frustrate, or delay the apprehension of suspects and the investigation
and prosecution of criminal cases.

2. The purpose in publicly using a fictitious name includes
evading prosecution (as opposed to concealing a crime or the execution
of a judgment only in Art. 178);
3. The purpose in concealing one’s true name and other
personal circumstances is concealing a crime, evading prosecution
or the execution of a judgment (as opposed to concealing his identity
in Art. 178).

dress pertaining to an office not held by such person or to
class of persons of which he is not a member.

Elements:
1.

8.

That the offender makes use of insignia, uniform or dress.
That the insignia, uniform or dress pertains to an office not
held by the offender or to a class of persons of which he is not a

member.
That said insignia, uniform or dress is used publicly and

improperly.

Wearing the uniform of an Imaginary office, not punlahable.

Note that the second element requires that the insignia, uniform
or dress pertains to an office or class of persons.
Hence, if the insignia, uniform or dress pertains to an office
which does not originally exist, this provision is not violated.
An exact imitation of a uniform or dress is unnecessary.

In November 1955, information reached the Mother Superior
of the religious order, Daughters of St. Paul, that a woman was
roaming around alone asking for alms for orphans in the name of said
organization. The woman was wearing the habit of the Daughters of
St. Paul. The Daughters of St. Paul had no orphans; asking for alms
was not its mission.
Amongst those approached by said woman was Leandra Sajagon,
mother of two sisters in the convent of the Daughters of St. Paul.
Leandra gave her Pl.00 for which no receipt was issued.
Held: To bring a culprit within the coverage of Article 179 of the
R.P.C., on the illegal use of uniforms and insignia, an exact imitation
of a uniform is unnecessary. A colorable resemblance calculated to
deceive the common run of people not those thoroughly familiar
with every detail or accessory thereof
is sufficient. (People v.

Section Two.

— False testimony

False testimony, defined.

False testimony is committed by a person who, being under oath
and required to testify as to the truth of a certain matter at a hearing
before a competent authority, shall deny the truth or say something
contrary to it.
What are the three forms of false testimony?

1.

False testimony in criminal cases. (Arts. 180 and 181)

2.

False testimony in civil cases. (Art. 182)

3.

False testimony in other cases. (Art. 183)

Falsehood is ever reprehensible; but it is particularly odious
when committed in judicial proceedings, as it constitutes an
imposition upon the court and seriously exposes it to a miscarriage
of justice. (People v. Reyes, C.A., 48 O.G. 1837)

—

Art. 180. False testimony against a defendant.
Any
person who shall give false testimony against the defendant
in any criminal case shall suffer:
1. The penalty of reclusion temporal,' if the defendant
in said case shall have been sentenced to death;
*See Appendix “A,” Table of Penalties, No. 28.

2. The penalty of prision mayor,1 if the defendant shall
have been sentenced to reclusion temporal or perpetua;
3. The penalty of prision correctional,' if the defendant
shall have been sentenced to any other afflictive penalty; and
4. The penalty of arresto mayor,' if the defendant shall
have been sentenced to a correctional penalty or a fine, or
shall have been acquitted.
In cases provided in subdivisions 3 and 4 of thisarticle the
offender shall further suffer a fine not to exceed Two hundred
thousand pesos (P200.000). (As amended by RA. No. 10951)

Elements:

1.

That there be a criminal proceeding;

2.

That the offender testifies falsely under oath against the
defendant therein;

3.

That the offender who gives false testimony knows that it is
false.
That the defendant against whom the false testimony is given
is either acquitted or convicted in a final judgment. (People v.
Maneja, 72 Phil. 256)

4.

Nature of the crime of false testimony.

Penalty depends upon the sentence of the defendant against whom
false testimony was given.

Note that the penalty for false testimony against the defendant
in a criminal case depends upon the sentence imposed on the
person against whom the false testimony was given. For instance,
a witness testifies falsely against the accused charged with murder.
If the accused is convicted and sentenced to death and the witness
is prosecuted and convicted, the penalty to be imposed on that false
witness is reclusion temporal. On the other hand, if the accused is
acquitted, the penalty to be imposed on the false witness is arresto
mayor.

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

The four cases enumerated in Article 180 uniformly presuppose
a final judgment of conviction or acquittal in the basic case as
a
prerequisite to the actionability of the crime of false testimony against

Art. 181

justice, and deserve to be rigorously repressed.(People v. Reyes, CA.,
48 O.G. 1837)

the defendant.

Reason for punishing the crime of false testimony.

Defendant must be sentenced at least to (1) a correctional penalty,
or (2) a fine, or (3) must be acquitted.

Problem: A is accused of slight physical injuries punishable
by one month of imprisonment. B falsely testified against him. A
is
convicted and sentenced to 15 days of arresto menor. Is B guilty of false
testimony? No. Article 180, paragraph 4, provides that the defendant
in the principal case shall be sentenced at least to a correctional
penalty or a fine, or shall have been acquitted.
The witness who gave false testimony is liable even if his testimony
was not considered by the court

Reason: Since the law punishes the false witness even if the
defendant in the principal case is acquitted, it would seem that the
law intends to punish the mere giving of false testimony.

—

Art. 181. False testimony favorable to the defendant. Any
person who shall give false testimony in favor of the defendant
in a criminal case, shall suffer the penalties of arresto mayor
in its maximum period to prision
correctional in its minimum
period' and a fine not to exceed Two hundred thousand pesos
(P200,000), if the prosecution is for a felony punishable by an
afflictive penalty, and the penalty of arresto mayor" in any
other case. (As amended by RA. No. 10951)

False testimony favorable to the defendant is equally repugnant to
the orderly administration of justice.

While false testimony in favor of an accused may be less
obnoxious than false testimony against him, both forms of false
testimony are equally repugnant to the orderly administration of
•See Appendix “A," Table of Penalties, No. 8.
•See Appendix “A," Table of Penalties, No. 1.

False testimony is punished not because of the effect it actually
produces, but because of its tendency to favor or to prejudice the
defendant. (December Sup. Ct. of Spain, January 4, 1904)

False testimony by negative statement Is In favor of defendant
A witness who falsely testified that he neither saw nor was

present at the killing of the deceased, is guilty of false testimony
because by not testifying for the prosecution, he favored the accused.
(December Supreme Court of Spain, April 2, 1883)

The false testimony in favor of defendant need not directly influence
the decision of acquittal.

People v. Reyes
(CA, 48 O.G. 1837)
Facts: The accused was the star witness in a prosecution for robbery
against Jemenia. Before the trial, the accused executed an affidavit in which
he manifested that he was not interested in the prosecution of the case and
that he wanted to give the accused “a chance to earn his living wisely and
in the honest way.” The fiscal refused to ask for the dismissal of the case.
When the case was called for trial, the accused, who was asked to identify
Jemenia, testified that he could not remember anymore the face of Jemenia.
After further questions failed to elicit other data, the case against Jemenia
was dismissed by the court, resulting in his acquittal.

Held: The contention of the defense that the acquittal of Jemenia was
due to the failure of the fiscal to call other witnesses who could have properly
identified Jemenia, is irrelevant. It is not necessary that the testimony given
by the witness should directly influence the decision of acquittal, it being
sufficient that it was given with the intent to favor the accused (in this case,
Jemenia).

The false testimony favorable to the defendant need not benefit
the defendant

In a case, the accused falsely testified in a criminal case in
favor of one Tupas, the defendant in that criminal case. Tupas was
convicted in spite of the favorable testimony given by the accused. It
313

312

Art. 181

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

was held that the accused was guilty, even if his testimony did not
benefit Tupas. (U.S. v. Adolfo, 12 Phil. 296)

Under Article 181, it is sufficient that the false testimony was
given with intent to favor the defendant. In the case of People v. Reyes
C.A., supra, such intent is indicated by the repeated statement of
the
accused that he was not interested in the prosecution of the defendant
in the criminal case where he gave the false testimony.
A statement by a witness that he is an expert In handwriting
Is a
statement of a mere opinion, the falsity of which is not
sufficient
to convict him.

Injudicial trials, the mere affirmation of a witness that he is
an
expert in handwriting is of no value. Upon such statement, he is
not
allowed to testify as an expert. He is required to give the experience
which he has had in the art in question. (U.S. v. McGovern, 4 Phil. 451)
Note: If it is his testimony relative to his experience which is
false, this not being a statement of mere opinion, he may be liable.

Conviction or acquittal of defendant in principal case, not necessary.
Note that under Article 181, it is sufficient that the defendant
in the principal case is prosecuted for a felony punishable by afflictive
penalty or by other penalty.
But the gravity of the crime for which the defendant was
prosecuted in the case where the false testimony was given should
be shown in order to determine the proper penalty to be imposed on
the false witness.
The defendant who falsely testified in his own behalf in a criminal
case is guilty of false testimony favorable to the defendant.
A defendant, charged with estafa, testified falsely that the
extrajudicial confession attributed to him was procured by the police
by the use of force, intimidation and prolonged
torture. On the basis
of his testimony, he was acquitted.
Held: It must not be forgotten that the right of an accused
person to testify in his own behalf is secured to him,
not that he may
be enabled to introduce false testimony into the record, but to enable
him to spread upon the record the truth as to any matter within
his knowledge which will tend to establish his
innocence. (U.S. v.
Soliman, 36 Phil. 5)
314

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Art. 182

Note: It would seem that the ruling in the Soliman case should
apply only when, as in that case, the defendant voluntarily goes
upon the witness stand and falsely imputes to some other person the
commission of a grave offense. If he merely denies the commission of
the crime or his participation therein, he should not be prosecuted
for false testimony.
Rectification made spontaneously after realizing the mistake is not
false testimony.

On direct examination, the witness stated that the accused told
him to get up for he had killed a person. On cross-examination, the
witness changed his testimony and stated he did not hear clearly
what the accused said.
Held: The witness is not liable, there being no sufficient evidence
that he acted with malice or with criminal intent to testify falsely.

Phil.

The testimony given In the civil case must be false.

Defendant declared in court that her property was free
encumbrance, whereas in fact there was a subsisting mortgage onfrom
the
property to guarantee the obligation of an agent. Can the
defendant
be prosecuted for false testimony? Mere guaranty is no lien on the
property. The prosecution failed to prove that the agent owed money
to the principal at the time the accused testified and that there was
then a subsisting debt for which the property was given as a security.
(People v. Collantes, CA., 37 O.G. 1804)
Article 182 is not applicable when the false testimony is given In
special proceedings.

Article 182 applies only to ordinary civil cases, as contemplated
in Section 1, Rule 2 of the Rules of Court, and does not apply to special
proceedings, such as the summary settlement of estates of small value,
under Section 2, Rule 74, of the Rules of Court, which may fall under
the category of “other cases” contemplated in Article 183.
The R.P.C. punishes, among other acts, the giving of false
testimony either against or in favor of the defendant in a criminal
case (Arts. 180 and 181); false testimony in a civil case, the penalty
being made dependent upon “the amount in controversy” (Art. 182);
and false testimony in other cases “upon any material matter.”
(Art. 183) On the other hand, the
Rules of Court comprises four
parts: Part I, on Civil Actions; Part II, on Special Proceedings; Part
III, on Criminal Procedure; and Part IV, on

Section 1, Rule 2, defines “actions” (civil) as “an ordinary suit in a court
of justice, by which one party prosecutes another for the
enforcement
or protection of a right, or the prevention or redress of
a wrong,
and says, further, that “every other remedy is a special proceeding(People v. Hernandez, CA., 67 O.G. 8330)

Example of false testimony in a civil case.

During the trial of Civil Case No. 1692 in the Court of First
Instance of Iloilo, wherein Juan Abraham, Jr. sued Vasquez for some
nine thousand and odd pesos, the balance due on account, the latter
produced an alleged receipt for P8.700 which he alleged had been
signed and delivered to him by Juan Abraham, Jr., and testified under
oath that he had paid him this amount. The receipt was not genuine
and Vasquez had not paid the P8.700. (U.S. v. Vasquez, 26 Phil. 480)
Falsity of testimony must first be established.

The falsity of the subject testimonies of private respondents is
yet to be established. It is noted that at the time of the filing of the
criminal complaints, the civil case filed by Ark Travel is still pending
decision. Ark Travel has yet to prove the validity of its monetary
claims and damages against NFMAI. It is only after trial that the RTC
can assess the veracity or falsity of the testimony and correspondingly
render a decision. Thus, the civil case is so intimately connected with
the subject crime that it is determinative of the guilt or innocence of
the respondents in the criminal cases. In other words, whether or not
the testimonies of private respondents in the civil cases are false is a
prejudicial question. Hence, pending determination of the falsity of
the subject testimonies of private respondents in the civil case, the
criminal action for false testimony must perforce be suspended. As
such, under the attendant circumstances, although there is no motion
to suspend proceedings on the part of the private respondents, orderly
administration of justice dictates that the criminal cases should be
suspended. (Ark Travel v. Hon. Abrogar, G.R. No. 137010, December

8, 2003)
Penalty depends on the amount of the controversy.

Any person who, in case of a solemn affirmation made in
lieu of an oath, shall commit any of the falsehoods mentioned
in this and the three preceding articles of this section, shall
suffer the respective penalties provided therein.

Two ways of committing perjury.

They are:

1.

By falsely testifying under oath; and

2.

By making a false affidavit.

Note: Falsely testifying under oath should not be in
a judicial proceeding.
Elements of perjury:
1.

That the accused made a statement under oath or executed an
affidavit upon a material matter,

2.

That the statement or affidavit was made before a competent
officer, authorized to receive and administer oath;
That in that statement or affidavit, the accused made a willful
and deliberate assertion of a falsehood; and
That the sworn statement or affidavit containing the falsity is
required by law. (People v. Bautista, CA., 40 O.G. 2491)

3.
4.

What is an oath?
Any form of attestation by which a person signifies that he is
bound in conscience to perform an act faithfully and truthfully. It
involves the idea of calling on God to witness what is averred as
truth, and it is supposed to be accompanied with an invocation of His
vengeance, or a renunciation of His favor, in the event of falsehood.

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Art. 183

Meaning of affidavit

An affidavit is a sworn statement in writing; a declaration in
writing, made upon oath before an authorized magistrate or officer.
Statement under oath

— as the basis of the charge of perjury.

B made a statement falsely charging O with estafa, that is,
that the latter borrowed from him an English manuscript entitled
“Manual of Exercises on Correcting Everyday Errors,” and that when
he demanded its return, O denied having received it. B made it under
oath in the preliminary investigation before the Justice of the Peace,
a competent officer authorized to administer oath. B’s statement
constitutes a material matter and is a deliberate falsehood, because
O never borrowed the manuscript.
Held: B is guilty of peijury. (People v. Bautista, CA., 40 O.G.
2491)

False affidavit — as the basis of the charge of perjury.

The accused Rufo B. Cruz filled up a blank application (Civil
Service Form No. 2) for the patrolman examination. He stated therein
that he had never been accused, indicted or tried for violation of any
law, ordinance or regulation before any court, when in truth and in
fact, as the accused well knew, he had been prosecuted and tried
before the Justice of the Peace Court of Cainta, Rizal, for different
crimes. The application was signed and sworn to by him before the
municipal mayor of Cainta, Rizal.

Held: The crime committed is perjury. The offense as defined
in Article 183 of the R.P.C. is the willful and corrupt assertion of a
falsehood under oath or affirmation administered by authority of law
on a material matter. (People v. Cruz, 108 Phil. 255)
A false affidavit to a criminal complaint may give rise to perjury.
The lower court had the opinion that an affidavit to a criminal
complaint has an entirely different status from an affidavit for other
purposes. In the case of People v. Rivera, 59 Phil. 236, it was held
that the false affidavit was not a violation of Article 363 of the R.P.C.
but it was not held that it would not violate Article 183 of said Code.
(People v. Cabero, 61 Phil. 121)

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Art. 183

Material matter, defined.

It is the main fact which is the subject of the inquiry or
any circumstance which tends to prove that fact, or any fact or
circumstance which tends to corroborate or strengthen the testimony
relative to the subject of inquiry, or which legitimately affects the
credit of any witness who testifies. (U.S. v. Estrana, 16 Phil. 520)
Example of material matter.

In the case of People v. Bautista, supra, the material matter,
that is, the main fact which was the subject of the inquiry by the
Justice of the Peace, was whether the offended party borrowed the
English manuscript. The testimony of the accused that the offended
party borrowed it from him was upon that material matter. If it was
true, then the charge of estafa would prosper; if it was not true, the
complaint for estafa would be dropped by the justice of the peace.
People v. Banzil
(CA-G.R. No. 22964-R, 56 O.G. 4929)

Facts: Accused Estanislao Banzil, an employee of the City of Manila,
was administratively charged with immorality upon the complaint of the
husband of the offended woman, and in the course of the investigation, he
gave his personal circumstances, as follows:
“Q

—

—

Please give your name and personal circumstances.”

“A Estanislao Banzil, 37 years old, single, residing at Sta. Monica,
Lubao, Pampanga, employed as market collector.”
The Court below said in the appealed judgment:
“The administrative case against the accused was for immorality. His
civil status was material to the case. He probably conceived the idea that if
he succeeded to convince the investigator that he is single, his advances to a
married woman would be justified, or at least his responsibility minimized.”

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Art. 183

that he is single, his advances to a married woman would be justified, or at
least his responsibility minimized,” the Court believes that the testimony of
the accused concerning his civil status is not material as tending either to
prove or disprove a fact bearing on any matter at issue; and the collateral
matter does not become a “material matter” merely because the declarant
mistakenly thinks it is in connection with the main subject of investigation.
The test of materiality is whether a false statement can influence the tribunal,
not whether it does (70 C.J.S. 466), or could probably influence the result
of the trial.

The accused was acquitted of the crime of perjury.
Also, in a case where a witness lied as to his residence, the fact not
being material to the issue, it was held that there was no perjury. (U.S. u.

Estraria, 16 Phil. 520)

There must be competent proof of materiality.
Where materiality is a statutory element of the crime, it is
settled that there must be competent proof of the materiality of the
false testimony. (U.S. v. Estrana, supra)
“Material,” “relevant,” and "pertinent,” distinguished.

The matter is “material” when it is directed to prove a fact in
issue. (Wigmore on Evidence, p. 37)

It is “relevant” when it tends in any reasonable degree to
establish the probability or improbability of a fact in issue. (1 Elliot
on Evidence, p. 197)
It is“pertinent" when it concerns collateral matters which make
more or less probable the proposition at issue. (Words and Phrases,
p. 468, No. 32)

Considering the observation of the lower court that the herein appellant
“probably conceived the idea that if he succeeded to convince the investigator

No perjury if sworn statement Is not material to the principal matter
under investigation.
If the false testimony given by the witness is not important,
essential or material to the principal matter under investigation, it
cannot properly be held that peijury is committed. (U.S. v. Jurado,
31 Phil. 491)
In a prosecution under Article 183, the information alleges
that the accused, “knowingly making untruthful statements, made

There is no question that the testimony of the accused relative to his
civil status was false, because in fact he was married.
Held. The Solicitor General agrees with the defense that the appellant’s
false statement was not material to the immorality charge. They are correct.
Single or married, the appellant may be convicted of immorality as a

government employee.

and subscribed to an affidavit before the Register of Deeds, who
is authorized by law to receive and administer oaths, upon facts
pertinent to the issuance of an order of the Court of First Instance of
Tarlac for the purpose of causing the Register of Deeds to issue him
a new copy of his title No. 201, knowing such facts stated by him in
the affidavit to be false."

Held: In order that peijuiy could exist, it is necessary that the
false statement of the accused refers to material matter and not
merely to facts pertinent to the case in connection with which it was
made. (People v. Capinlac, 64 Phil. 442)
Competent person authorized to administer oath.

The phrase “competent person authorized to administer an
oath” means a person who has a right to inquire into the questions
presented to him upon matters under his jurisdiction. (U.S. v. Go
Chanco, 23 Phil. 641)
There is no perjury If the statement was made in a pleading which
is not required to be verified.

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Art. 183

The assertion of falsehood must be willful and deliberate.

Note the phrase “knowingly making untruthful statements”
in Article 183. This is the basis of the third element of the crime of
peijury. The word knowingly suggests that the assertion of falsehood
must be willful and deliberate.
Hence, there is no peijury through negligence or imprudence.
Good faith or lack of malice is a defense in perjury.
Saavedra v. Department of Justice
(G.R. No. 93173, September 15, 1993)

Facts: Private respondent filed a criminal case for perjury against
petitioner alleging that petitioner perjured himself when he declared in the
verification of a civil complaint for damages that he was the President of PPI
when he ceased to be the President when the sale of shares of stock to him
was automatically rescinded. In his answer-affidavit, petitioner contended
that since the issues of ownership and automatic rescission were still pending
and unresolved in the SEC, there was no basis to the charge that he asserted
a falsehood.

As a rule, pleadings need not be verified unless otherwise
required by the Rules of Court, and no rule requires complaints
for damages to be under oath. Since the complaint for damages
filed by petitioner against private respondent is not required to be
verified, an essential element of the crime of perjury is absent, i.e.,
that the sworn statement containing the falsity is required by law.
Consequently, petitioner cannot be prosecuted on the basis of an
alleged falsehood made in a verified pleading which is not mandated
by law to be verified. (Saavedra t>. Department of Justice, G.R.
No. 93173, September 15, 1993)

Held: Mere assertion of a falsehood is not enough to amount to perjury.
The assertion must be deliberate and willful. While there may have been
a falsehood asserted, no evidence exists to show that the same was done
deliberately and wilfully. On the contrary, the records tend to show that the
assertion was done in good faith, in the belief that the non-payment of the
last installment price was justified by the sellers’ noncompliance with their
warranties. Besides, petitioner alleges that he has deposited the balance in
escrow, which is not disputed. Consequently, an essential element of the
crime appears to be wanting i.e., that the falsehood is willful and deliberate.

No perjury if defendant subscribed and swore
before a clerk in
treasurer’s office.

Facts: The accused filed a petition for voluntary insolvency. He included
in the inventory of properties attached to the petition his undivided half
interest in certain parcels of land which had already been sold by the sheriff
to Zosimo Fernandez to satisfy the latter’s claim for P4,000. He also included
in the schedule of debts the said debt of P4.000. Both the schedule and the
inventory were under oath.

People v. Abaya
(74 Phil. 59)

Thus, a false affidavit or solemn affirmation made in a marriage
application before a clerk of the municipal
treasurer’s office, who
signs and holds out himself as “assistant
and in the absence of the
civil registrar is not the falsehood penalized
under Article 183,
paragraph 2, because such clerk is not a competent
person authorized
to administer oaths. (People v. Bella David, CA.,
11 O.G. 49611943J)

The accused was charged with a violation of Article 183 in that he
stated under oath in his insolvency case that the undivided half of the land
was his, when he fully knew that the same no longer belonged to him, as it
was already owned by Zosimo Fernandez.

322

323

Art. 183

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Held: The accused did not act with malice. Since the land was still
registered in his name, he might be charged with concealing property standing
in his name in the registry of property, which is a violation of the Insolvency
Law. The accused who could not be expected to determine the property, from
a legal point of view of the inclusion, merely stated a fact in said inventory.

—

Meaning of the 4th element Is it necessary that there be a specific
provision of law requiring the affidavit or sworn statement to be
made?

To induce the clerk in the office of the municipal treasurer to
issue a certificate of transfer of a large cattle, the accused executed
an affidavit wherein the latter swore falsely that he was authorized
by its owner to sell it.
Held: That affidavit could not be made the basis of perjury for
the reason that the execution or filing of such an affidavit was not
required by law. (People v. Tupasi, et al., CA., 36 O.G. 2086)
Note: The basis of this ruling is the phrase in Article 183, which
is, “shall testify under oath, or make an affidavit, x x x in cases in
which the law so requires.”

A sworn statement containing a falsity made by a witness in
preliminary examination which leads to the issuance of a warrant of
arrest may constitute perjury, because the Revised Administrative
Code requires that in a preliminary investigation of a criminal case
all the witnesses, including the complainant, must be examined under
oath. (People v. Bautista, CA., 40 O.G. 2491)
Examples of cases where affidavits are required by law are:
(1) affidavit attached to the petition for
receivership, (2) affidavit
attached to complaint for ejectment, and (3) affidavit for application
for marriage license.

However, in an unpublished decision (People v. Angangco), it
was held that the word “requires” in the phrase “in cases in which the
law so requires” may be given the meaning of
“authorizes.” Hence,
the 4th element may be read “that the sworn
containing
statement
the falsity is authorized by law.”
Hence, even if there is no law requiring the statement
to be made
under oath, as long as it is made for a legal purpose,
it is sufficient.
324

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Art. 183

People v. Angangco
(G.R. No. L-47693, October 12, 1943)

Facts: In connection with an investigation concerning anomalies in
the administration of the estate of a deceased person, accused Angangco
defined certain signatures in writing and later it was sworn to by him before
a notary. When the papers of the case were forwarded to the City Fiscal and
the latter examined accused Angangco under oath about the same signatures,
he repudiated his statement contained in his affidavit.
When prosecuted for perjury, accused Angangco contended that the
phrase “in case in which the law so requires” appearing at the end of the
first paragraph of Article 183 refers to the affidavit or any statement under
oath, so that if the sworn statement is not required by law to be made, no
perjury is committed.

Held: The contention is without merit. The term ‘requires’ in the phrase
mentioned should have a permissive not mandatory effect so as to make
the said phrase read: “in cases in which the law so authorizes.” Hence, it is
not necessary that there be a specific provision of law requiring the affidavit
to be made in the particular case.

—

—

It is sufficient that the oath had been administered with a view
of carrying into effect a legal purpose intended. In the instant case, the
investigating officer administered oath to the accused undoubtedly with a
view of being assured of the veracity of the latter and thus be furnished with
foundational evidence with which to proceed against Juan L. Quintos in his
suspected acts of embezzlement of the estate of the deceased.

Policy of the law on perjury.

Every interest of public policy demands that perjury be
not shielded by artificial refinements and narrow technicalities.
For perjury strikes at the very administration of the laws. It is the
policy of the law that judicial proceedings and judgment shall be fair
and free from fraud, and that litigants and parties be encouraged
to tell the truth and that they be punished if they do not. (People v.
Cainglet, G.R. Nos. L-21493-94, April 29, 1966)
“Not being included in the provisions of the next preceding articles.'’

This phrase indicates that perjury is a crime other than false
testimony in criminal cases or false testimony in civil cases, which
are perversions of truth in judicial proceedings.

325

Art. 183

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Perjury is an offense which covers false oaths other than those
taken in the course of judicial proceedings. (U.S. v. Estrana, 16 Phil.

521)

False testimony before the justice of the peace or fiscal during
the preliminary investigation may give rise to the crime of perjury,
because false testimony injudicial proceedings contemplates an actual
trial where a judgment of conviction or acquittal is rendered. (People
v. Bautista, CA., 40 O.G. 2491)
Are two contradictory sworn statements sufficient to convict of
perjury?

No. In Villanueva v. Secretary of Justice, G.R. No. 162187,
November 18, 2005, it was held:
A conviction for perjury cannot be sustained merely
upon the contradictory sworn statements of the accused.
The prosecution must prove which of the two statements
is false and must show the statement to be false by other
evidence than the contradicting statement. (U.S. v.
Capistrano, 40 Phil. 902) The rationale of this principle
is thus:

... Proof that accused has given contradictory

testimony under oath at a different time will not be
sufficient to establish the falsity of testimony charged
as perjury, for this would leave simply one oath of the
defendant as against another, and it would not appear that
the testimony charged was false rather than the testimony
contradictory thereof. The two statements will simply
neutralize each other; there must be some corroboration of
the contradictory testimony. Such corroboration, however,
may be furnished by evidence aliunde tending to show
perjury independently of the declarations of testimony of
the accused. (People v. McClintic, 160 N.W. 461 [1916])
Note: The importance of this rule may be shown in the following
illustration: A testified under oath before the fiscal during the
preliminary investigation of a homicide case. When the case was filed
in court and A testified, he gave a different
testimony contradicting
his testimony before the fiscal. If his testimony
before the fiscal is
false, it is perjury. If his testimony before the
court
is false, it is false
testimony in a judicial proceeding.
326

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Art. 184

Subornation of perjury.
Subornation of perjury is committed by a person who knowingly
and wilfully procures another to swear falsely and the witness
suborned does testify under circumstances rendering him guilty of
perjury. (U.S. v. Ballena, 18 Phil. 382)
Example:

B induced A to testify falsely against a fiscal. A, after having
been duly sworn, knowingly and willfully testified falsely against the
fiscal that the latter attempted to rape her (A’s) daughter.
Held: B was guilty of subornation of perjury. B not only
knowingly and willfully induced A to swear falsely, but he did so
maliciously, as it appeared from the record that he was an enemy of
the fiscal who had prosecuted him before. (See U.S. v. Ballena, 18

Phil. 382)

Subornation of perjury is not expressly penalized in the Revised
Penal Code; but the direct induction of a person by another to
commit perjury may be punished under Article 183 in relation to
Article 17.
The specific provision under the old Penal Code penalizing
subornation of perjury was omitted in the R.P.C. The crime is now
treated as plain perjury, the one inducing another as principal by
inducement and the latter as principal by direct participation. (People
v. Pudol, et al., 66 Phil. 365)

That he knew the witness or the testimony was false;
That the offer was made in a judicial or official proceeding.

“Shall knowingly offer In evidence a false witness or testimony."

Offer of evidence under Section 35, Rule 132 of the Rules of
Court, insofar as testimonial evidence is concerned, begins the
moment a witness is called to the witness stand and interrogated by
counsel. The witness must have to testify.

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest

Penalty is that for false testimony if committed in a judicial
proceeding or that for perjury If committed in other official

proceeding.
The accused “shall be punished as guilty of false testimony and
shall suffer the respective penalties provided” for false testimony or
perjury.

Is the person who presented a false witness liable under
Article 184, even if the false witness did not testify on any material
matter because the latter desisted from testifying?
It seems that the person who called to the stand a false witness
is liable for attempted offering false testimony in evidence. While
Article 184 speaks of a false “witness” or “testimony,” that article
requires to consummate the offense that the witness or the testimony
must be offered in evidence.

Even if there was conspiracy between the false witness and
the party who presented him, the witness having desisted before he
could testify on any material matter is not liable, because desistance
during the attempted stage of execution is an absolutory cause which
exempts him from criminal liability.
The party who presented him, not having desisted, is criminally
liable.
Article 184 applies when the offender does not induce a witness
to testify falsely.

Article 184 contemplates of a case where a person, without
inducing another, but knowing him to be a false witness, presented
him, and the latter testified falsely in a judicial or official proceeding.

If there is an inducement, Articles 180, 181, 182, or Article 183,
in relation to Article 7, paragraph 2, will apply.

“Other artifice.”
Thus, the bidders may be caused to stay away from public
auction by tricks, such as by telling them that the public bidding
would not be held at that time to make them go away, knowing that
the bidding would not be postponed.
Mere attempt consummates the crime.

Likewise, an attempt to cause prospective bidders to stay away
from an auction by means of threats, gifts, promises or any other
artifice with intent that the thing auctioned should command a lesser
price, is sufficient to constitute an offense.
The threat need not be effective nor the offer or gift accepted for
the crime to arise.

Diaz v. Kapunan
(45 Phil. 482)

Facts: Vicente Diaz and Segundino de Mendezona formed a partnership
and entered into extensive business transactions. Unfortunately, however, the
business failed to prosper, with the result that on liquidation, it was found
to have suffered a loss of P67,000. When Diaz and de Mendezona came to
settle up their affairs, they eventually formulated a document of sale and
mortgage in which de Mendezona recognized a debt in favor of Diaz in the
sum of P80,000 and an additional sum of PIO,000 owing to Diaz, laid upon
the hacienda “Mapuyo," and to be paid within the term of one year.
When
the year had expired, de Mendezona was not to be found and his family
was unable to meet the payment. There followed the usual proceedings
for
foreclosure and sale, which resulted in the hacienda’s being offered for sale
at public auction.
At the time fixed for the sale, there appeared Vicente
Diaz and Ruperto
Kapunan. Kapunan was ready to bid on the property
up to P16.00O in order
to assist the de Mendezona family which was in
financial straits. At any rate,
the bidding was opened by Kapunan offering P12,000
for the property and
with Diaz and Kapunan raising the bids until
finally Diaz offered P12,500.
There the bids stopped on account of Diaz and Kapunan
entering into the
agreement, of decisive importance, which [the]
(Court) next quote[s] in full:
We, Vicente Diaz and Ruperto Kapunan,
both being the
bidders at the auction held for the sale of the
properties of Segundino
de Mendezona, do hereby agree that Don
Ruperto Kapunan should
withdraw his bid and refrain from bidding at
the said auction as he
does hereby withdraw his bid, and in
consideration thereof, the said

Mr. Diaz offers him a premium of one thousand pesos (Pl ,000) which,

and has, for this reason, refrained from bidding in competition with
said Mr. Diaz.”
Following the termination of the sheriff sale, Diaz gave Kapunan

P50O.00 of the Pl,000 mentioned in the above quoted document. Diaz took
over the property of de Mendezona pursuant to his bid of P12.500.
Held: This is exactly the situation covered by Article 542 (now Art.

185) of the Penal Code.

Reason for the provision.
Execution sales should be opened to free and full competition in order to

secure the maximum benefit for the debtors. (Diaz v. Kapunan, 46 Phil. 482)
The Philippine Competition Act prohibits fixing prices at an auction
or in any form of bidding.

An agreement, between or among competitors, fixing price at
an auction or in any form of bidding including cover bidding, bid
suppression, bid rotation and market allocation and other analogous
practices of bid manipulation are per se prohibited. (Sec. 14(a)[2],
R.A. No. 10667)
Bid manipulation (also called bid rigging or collusive tendering)
occurs when businesses, that would otherwise be expected to compete,
secretly conspire to raise prices or lower the quality of goods or services
for purchasers who wish to acquire products or services through a
bidding process.
Common bid manipulation practices:
Bid cover. Bid cover (also called complementary, courtesy, token,
or symbolic) bidding occurs when individuals or firms agree to submit
bids that involve at least one of the following: (1) a competitor agrees
to submit a bid that is higher than the bid of the designated winner,
(2) a competitor submits a bid that is known to be too high to be
accepted, or (3) a competitor submits a bid that contains special terms
that are known to be unacceptable to the purchaser. Cover bidding is
designed to give the appearance of genuine competition.
Bid suppression. Bid-suppression schemes involve agreements
among competitors in which one or more companies agree to refrain
from bidding or to withdraw a previously submitted bid so that the

Exemptions from prohibited mergers and acquisitions.

Merger or acquisition agreement prohibited under Section 20
may, nonetheless, be exempt from prohibition by the Commission
when the parties establish either of the following:

(h) Directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or

(a)

selling price on their competitors, customers, suppliers
or consumers, provided that prices that develop in the
market as a result of or due to a superior product or
process, business acumen or legal rights or laws shall not
be considered unfair prices; and
(i)

(b)

Limiting production, markets or technical development to
the prejudice of consumers, provided that limitations that
develop in the market as a result of or due to a superior
product or process, business acumen or legal rights or laws
shall not be a violation of this Act:

without violating the provisions of this Act:

Provided, further, That the acquisition of the stock or
other share capital of one or more corporations solely for
investment and not used for voting or exercising control
and not to otherwise bring about, or attempt to bring about
the prevention, restriction, or lessening of competition in
the relevant market shall not be prohibited. (Sec. 21)

Provided, further, That any conduct which contributes
to improving production or distribution of goods or services
within the relevant market, or promoting technical and
economic progress while allowing consumers a fair share
of the resulting benefit may not necessarily be considered
an abuse of dominant position:

340

The concentration has brought about or is likely to bring
about gains in efficiencies that are greater than the effects
of any limitation on competition that result or likely to
result from the merger or acquisition agreement; or
A party to the merger or acquisition agreement is faced with
actual or imminent financial failure, and the agreement
represents the least anti-competitive arrangement among
the known alternative uses for the failing entity’s assets:

Provided, That an entity shall not be prohibited from
continuing to own and hold the stock or other share capital
or assets of another corporation which it acquired prior to
the approval of this Act or acquiring or maintaining its
market share in a relevant market through such means

Provided, That nothing in this Act shall be construed
or interpreted as a prohibition on having a dominant
position in a relevant market or on acquiring, maintaining
and increasing market share through legitimate means that
do not substantially prevent, restrict or lessen competition:

Provided, finally, That the foregoing shall not
constrain the Commission or the relevant regulator from
pursuing measures that would promote fair competition or
more competition as provided in this Act.
(2) Prohibited Mergers and Acquisitions (Sec. 20)
Merger or acquisition agreements that substantially
prevent, restrict or lessen competition in the relevant market
or in the market for goods or services as may be determined by
the Commission shall be prohibited. (Sec. 20)

Art. 186

Burden of Proof.
The burden of proof under Section 21 lies with the
parties seeking the exemption. A party seeking to rely on
the exemption specified in Section 21(a) must demonstrate

that if the agreement were not implemented, significant
efficiency gains would not be realized. (Sec. 22)
(3)

Compulsory notification for mergers or acquisitions
where the value exceeds PHP1 billion (Sec. 17)
The Philippine Competition Commission shall have the
power to review mergers and acquisitions based on factors
deemed relevant by the Commission. (Sec. 16)

Compulsory Notification.
Parties to the merger or acquisition agreement wherein
the value of the transaction exceeds Pl,000,000,000 are
prohibited from consummating their agreement until 30 days
after providing notification to the Commission in the form and
containing the information specified in the regulations issued
by the Commission: Provided, That the Commission shall
promulgate other criteria, such as increased market share in
the relevant market in excess of minimum thresholds, that may
be applied specifically to a sector, or across some or all sectors,
in determining whether parties to a merger or acquisition shall
notify the Commission under this Chapter.

An agreement consummated in violation of this requirement
to notify the Commission shall be considered void and subject
the parties to an administrative fine of 1% to 5% of the value of
the transaction.

Should the Commission deem it necessary, it may request
further information that are reasonably necessary and directly
relevant to the prohibition under Section 20 hereof from the
parties to the agreement before the expiration of the 30-day
period referred. The issuance of such a request has the effect
of extending the period within which the agreement may not
be consummated for an additional 60 days, beginning on the
day after the request for information is received by the parties:
Provided, That, in no case shall the total period for review by
the Commission of the subject agreement exceed 90 days from
initial notification by the parties.
When the above periods have expired and no decision
has been promulgated for whatever reason, the merger or
acquisition shall be deemed approved and the parties may
proceed to implement or consummate it. All notices, documents
and information provided to or emanating from the Commission
under this section shall be subject to confidentiality rule under
Section 34 of this Act except when the release of information
contained therein is with the consent of the notifying entity
or is mandatorily required to be disclosed by law or by a valid
order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or of a government or
regulatory agency, including an exchange.

Crimes Against Public Interest

Art. 186

In the case of the merger or acquisition of banks, banking
institutions, building and loan associations, trust companies,
insurance companies, public utilities, educational institutions
and other special corporations governed by special laws, a
favorable or no-objection ruling by the Commission shall not
be construed as dispensing of the requirement for a favorable
recommendation by the appropriate government agency under
Section 79 of the Corporation Code of the Philippines.
A favorable recommendation by a governmental agency
with a competition mandate shall give rise to a disputable
presumption that the proposed merger or acquisition is not
violative of this Act. (Sec. 17)
Effect of Notification.
If within the relevant periods stipulated in the preceding
section, the Commission determines that such agreement is
prohibited under Section 20 and does not qualify for exemption
under Section 21 of this Chapter, the Commission may:
(a)

Prohibit the implementation of the agreement;

(b)

Prohibit the implementation of the agreement unless and
until it is modified by changes specified by the Commission.

(c)

beginning 45 days from the time that the said decision, order or
ruling was received.

may likewise impose upon any entity fines of up to Pl,000,000
where, intentionally or negligently, they supply incorrect or
misleading information in any document, application or other
paper filed with or submitted to the Commission or supply
incorrect or misleading information in an application for a
binding ruling, a proposal for a consent judgment, proceedings
relating to a show cause order, or application for modification
of the Commission’s ruling, order or approval, as the case may
be.

Provided that the schedule of fines indicated in this
section shall be increased by the Commission every five years
to maintain their real value from the time it was set. (Sec. 24)

344

Art. 186

Leniency Program.

The Commission shall develop a Leniency Program to be granted
to any entity in the form of immunity from suit or reduction of any
fine which would otherwise be imposed on a participant in an anti¬
competitive agreement as provided in Section 14(a) and 14(b) of this
Act in exchange for the voluntary disclosure of information regarding
such an agreement which satisfies specific criteria prior to or during
the fact-finding or preliminary inquiry stage of the case.
Immunity from suit will be granted to an entity reporting illegal
anti-competitive activity before a fact-finding or preliminary inquiry
has begun if the following conditions are met:
(a) At the time the entity comes forward, the Commission has
not received information about the activity from any other
source;
(b)

Upon the entity’s discovery of illegal activity, it took prompt
and effective action to terminate its participation therein;

(c)

The entity reports the wrongdoing with candor and
completeness and provides full, continuing, and complete
cooperation throughout the investigation; and

(d)

The entity did not coerce another party to participate in the
activity and clearly was not the leader in, or the originator
of, the activity.

Even after the Commission has received information about
the illegal activity after a fact-finding or preliminary inquiry has
commenced, the reporting entity will be granted leniency, provided
preceding conditions (b) and (c) and the following additional
requirements are complied with:
(1)

The entity is the first to come forward and qualify for
leniency;

(2)

At the time the entity comes forward, the Commission does
not have evidence against the entity that is likely to result
in a sustainable conviction; and

(3)

The Commission determines that granting leniency would
not be unfair to others.
345

Art. 186

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Such program shall include the immunity from any suit or charge
of affected parties and third parties, exemption, waiver, or gradation
of fines and/or penalties giving precedence to the entity submitting
such evidence. An entity cooperating or furnishing information,
document or data to the Commission in connection to an investigation
being conducted shall not be subjected to any form of reprisal or
discrimination. Such reprisal or discrimination shall be considered
a violation of this Act subject to the sanctions provided in this Act.
Nothing in this section shall preclude prosecution for entities
that report to the Commission false, misleading, or malicious
information, data or documents damaging to the business or integrity
of the entities under inquiry as a violation of said section. An entity
found to have reported false, misleading or malicious information,
data, or document may be penalized by a fine not less than the penalty
imposed in the section reported to have been violated by the entity
complained of.

The DOJ-OFC may likewise grant leniency or immunity as
provided in this section in the event that there is already a preliminary
investigation pending before it. (Sec. 35)
Theory of the law in penalizing monopolies and combinations in
restraint of trade.

The theory of the law in penalizing monopolies and combinations
in restraint of trade is that competition, not combination, should be
the law of trade. (Miller, Criminal Law, 448-449)
Example of spreading false rumors to restrain free competition.

A person went about distributing papers and proclamations to
the people of a certain town spreading subversive and fanatic ideas
that unless they lower the prices of needful commodities they would
be visited by flood and other calamities. The people were thereby
caused to lower the prices of commodities and to provide themselves
with instruments of measure larger than the regular size. (U.S. v.
Fulgueras, 4 Phil. 432)

Note: This is spreading false rumors or making use of any other
artifice to restrain free competition in the market.

TITLE FOUR
Crimes Against Public Interest
Property is forfeited to the Government.

Any property possessed under any contract or combination
contemplated in this article, shall be forfeited to the Government,
(par. 3, Art. 186)
Mere conspiracy or combination is punished.

The law intends to punish the mere conspiracy or combination

at which it is aimed.
If the offense affects any food substance or other article of prime
necessity, it is sufficient that initial steps are taken.

If the monopolies and combinations in restraint of trade affect
any food substance, motor fuel or lubricants or other article of prime
necessity, it is sufficient for the imposition of a higher penalty that
the initial steps have been taken toward carrying out the purposes of
combination. (Art. 186)
When offense is committed by a corporation or association, the
officers, directors, or managerial employees are liable.

When the entities involved are juridical persons, the penalty of
imprisonment shall be imposed on its officers, directors, or employees
holding managerial positions, who are knowingly and willfully
responsible for such violation. (Sec. 30, R.A. No. 10667)
Illegal Acts of Price Manipulation.

R.A. No. 7581 or“the Price Act,” approved May 27, 1992, declares
it unlawful for any person habitually engaged in the production,
manufacture, importation, storage, transport, distribution, sale or
other methods of disposition of goods to engage in the following acts
of price manipulation of the price of any basic necessity or prime
commodity:

persons engaged in the production, manufacture, processing,
storage, supply, distribution, marketing, sale or disposition of
any basic necessity or prime commodity designed to artificially
and unreasonably increase or manipulate its price. (Sec. 5)
Any person who commits any act of illegal price
manipulation of any basic necessity or prime commodity shall
suffer the penalty of imprisonment for a period of not less than
five years nor more than 15 years, and shall be imposed a fine
of not less than P5,000 nor more than P2,000,000. (Sec. 15)

Section Two.

— Frauds in commerce and industry

Art. 187. Importation and disposition of falsely marked
articles or merchandise made of gold, silver, or other precious
metals or their alloys. The penalty of prision correctional*
or a fine ranging from Forty thousand pesos (P40,000) to
Two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000), or both, shall be
imposed upon any person who shall knowingly import or sell
or dispose of any article or merchandise made of gold, silver
or other precious metals, or their alloys, with stamps, brands
or marks which fail to indicate the actual fineness or quality
of said metals or alloys.

—

Any stamp, brand, label, or mark shall be deemed to fail
to indicate the actual fineness of the article on which it is
engraved, printed, stamped, labeled, attached, when the test

less by more than one-half karat, if made of gold, and less by

more than four one-thousandth, if made of silver, than what

is shown by said stamp, brand, label or mark. But in case of

watch cases and flatware made of gold, the actual fineness of

such gold shall not be less by more than three one-thousandth
than the fineness indicated by said stamp, brand, label or
mark. (As amended by RA.. No. 10951)

Articles or merchandise involved.
Those made of

Gold,

(b)

Silver,

Elements:

1

.

That the offender imports, sells or disposes of any of those articles
or merchandise.

2.

That the stamps, brands, or marks of those articles of
merchandise fail to indicate the actual fineness or quality of
said metals or alloys.

3.

That the offender knows that the stamps, brands, or marks fail
to indicate the actual fineness or quality of the metals or alloys.

Selling the misbranded articles is not necessary.

Since one of the acts penalized in Article 187 is knowingly
importing misbranded articles made of gold, silver, etc., which includes
possession thereof after importing the same, it is not necessary that
they be sold and the public be actually deceived. But there must be
evidence showing that the articles were imported.

Illustration.-.
Petitioner’s “SAN FRANCISCO COFFEE” trademark is a
clear infringement of respondent’s “SAN FRANCISCO COFFEE
& ROASTERY, INC.” trade name. The descriptive words “SAN
FRANCISCO COFFEE” are precisely the dominant features of
respondent’s trade name. Petitioner and respondent are engaged in
the same business of selling coffee, whether wholesale or retail. The
likelihood of confusion is higher in cases where the business of one
corporation is the same or substantially the same as that of another
corporation. In this case, the consuming public will likely be confused
as to the source of the coffee being sold at petitioner’s coffee shops.
Petitioner’s argument that “San Francisco” is just a proper name
referring to the famous city in California and that “coffee” is simply
a generic term, is untenable. Respondent has acquired an exclusive
right to the use of the trade name “SAN FRANCISCO COFFEE &
ROASTERY, INC.” since the registration of the business name with
the DTI in 1995. Thus, respondent’s use of its trade name from then
on must be free from any infringement by similarity. (Coffee Partners,
Inc. v. San Francisco Coffee & Roastery, Inc., G.R. No. 169504, March
3, 2010)
The objects of a trademark.

The objects of a trademark are to point out distinctly the origin
or ownership of the article to which it is affixed, to secure to him, who
has been instrumental in bringing into market a superior article of
merchandise, the fruit of his industry and skill, and to prevent fraud
and imposition. (Etepha v. Director of Patents, et al., 16 SCRA 495)

Elements of trademark infringement
The elements of infringement under R.A. No. 8293 are as follows:
1.

The trademark being infringed is registered in the
Intellectual Property Office; however, in infringement of
trade name, the same need not be registered;
354

Art. 189

The trademark or trade name is reproduced, counterfeited,
copied, or colorably imitated by the infringer;
The infringing mark or trade name is used in connection
with the sale, offering for sale, or advertising of any goods,
business or services; or the infringing mark or trade name
is applied to labels, signs, prints, packages, wrappers,
receptacles or advertisements intended to be used upon or
in connection with such goods, business or services;

4.

The use or application of the infringing mark or trade
name is likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive
purchasers or others as to the goods or services themselves
or as to the source or origin of such goods or services or the
identity of such business; and

5.

It is without the consent of the trademark or trade name
owner or the assignee thereof. (Societe Des Produits Nest14,
SA. v. Dy, G.R. No. 172276, August 8, 2010)

THE TRADEMARK MUST BE REGISTERED.

The trademark must be registered in the Intellectual Property
Office of the Philippines. A certificate of registration of a mark shall be
prima facie evidence of the validity of the registration, the registrant’s
ownership of the mark, and of the registrant’s exclusive right to use
the same in connection with the goods or services and those that are
related thereto specified in the certificate. (Sec. 138, IP Code)

Where the accused infringed the “Apo° trademark of the Cebu
Portland Cement Co., but it was not shown that the said trademark
was registered, the accused is not criminally liable under Article 188
(now Sec. 155, IP Code). (People v. Go Yee Bio., 36 O.G. 1082)
The scope of protection afforded to registered trademark owners
extends to market areas that are the normal expansion of their

business.
Modern law recognizes that the protection to which the owner
of a trademark is entitled is not limited to guarding his goods or
business from actual market competition with identical or similar
products of the parties, but extends to all cases in which the use by
a junior appropriator of a trade-mark or trade-name is likely to lead
to a confusion of source, as where prospective purchasers would be

misled into thinking that the complaining party has extended his
business into the field (See 148 ALR 56 et sq\ 53 Am. Jur. 576) or is
in any way connected with the activities of the infringer; or when it
forestalls the normal potential expansion of his business (v. 148 ALR,
77, 84; 52 Am. Jur. 576, 577). (McDonalds Corporation v. L.C. Big
Mak Burger, G.R. No.143993, August 18, 2004)
Indeed, the registered trademark owner may use its mark on
the same or similar products, in different segments of the market,
and at different price levels depending on variations of the products
for specific segments of the market. (Dermaline, Inc v. Myra
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., G.R. No. 190065, August 16, 2010)

Trademark must not be merely generic or descriptive.

Generic marks.
A mark which “consists] exclusively of signs that are generic
for the goods or services they seek to identify” is not registrable. (Sec.
132. l[h], IP Code)

Generic terms are those which constitute “the common
descriptive name of an article or substance,” or comprise the “genus of
which the particular product is a species,” or are “commonly used as
the name or description of a kind of goods,” or “imply reference to every
member of a genus and the exclusion of individuating characters,”
or “refer to the basic nature of the wares or services provided rather
than to the more idiosyncratic characteristics of a particular product,”
and are not legally protectable. (Federal Unfair Competition: Lanham
Act § 43(a), pp. 3-22.1.)
Thus, the word “Bubble gum° cannot be considered as a trademark,
because the words are merely descriptive and generic, designating the
article made of sweetened gum which, if chewed and blown off mouth,
produces a bubble. (Am. Sweets, Inc. v. C/Racca Confectionery Co., CA..,

A term is descriptive and therefore invalid as a trademark if,
as understood in its normal and natural sense, it “forthwith conveys
the characteristics, functions, qualities or ingredients of a product
to one who has never seen it and does not know what it is,” or “if it
forthwith conveys an immediate idea of the ingredients, qualities
or characteristics of the goods,” or if it clearly denotes what goods
or services are provided in such a way that the consumer does not
have to exercise powers of perception or imagination. (Federal Unfair
Competition: Lanham Act § 43[a], p. 3-36)
A dealer in shoes cannot register an alleged trademark “Leather
Shoes,” because that is merely descriptive and it would be unjust to
deprive other dealers in leather shoes of the right to use the same
words with reference to their merchandise. (Masso Hermanos SA.,
v. Director of Patents, 94 Phil. 136)
Mere geographical names, like “Wellington” which is the capital
of New Zealand, are ordinarily regarded as common property, and
it is a general rule that same cannot be appropriated as the subject
of an exclusive trademark or tradename. (52 Am. Jur. 548) Even
if Wellington were a surname, which is not even that of plaintiff¬
appellants, it cannot also be validly registered as a trade name.
(Sec. 4, par. [3], R.A. No. 166) As the term cannot be appropriated
as a trademark or trade name, no action for violation thereof can be
maintained, as none is granted by the statute in such cases. (Heng
and Dee v. Wellington Department Store, Inc., et al., 92 Phil. 448)
THE TRADEMARK OR TRADE NAME IS REPRODUCED,
COUNTERFEITED, COPIED, OR COLORABLY IMITATED BY THE
INFRINGER.

Colorable imitation.

Marks that “consist exclusively of signs or any indication that
may serve in trade to designate the kind, quality, quantity, intended
purpose, value, geographical origin, time or production of the goods
or rendering of the services or other characteristics of the goods or
services” are not registrable. (Sec. 132. l[j], IP Code)

To be regarded as similar to an earlier mark, it is enough that
a prospective mark be a colorable imitation of the former. (Clark v.
Manila Candy Company, 36 Phil. 100 [1917])
Colorable imitation denotes such likeness in form, content,
words, sound, meaning, special arrangement or general appearance
of one mark with respect to another as would likely mislead an
average buyer in the ordinary course of purchase. (Emerald Garment
Manufacturing v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 100098, December 29,

LIKELIHOOD OF CONFUSION.

Intellectual Property Code 263 [1999]) Courts will consider more

Among the elements, the element of likelihood of confusion is the
gravamen of trademark infringement. (Societe Des Produits Nestle,
SA. v. Dy, supra)

the aural and visual impressions created by the marks in the public
mind, giving little weight to factors like prices, quality, sales outlets
and market segments.

Two tests to determine likelihood of confusion.

Thus, in the 1954 case of Co Tiong Sa v. Director of Patents, 95
Phil. 1 (1954), the Court ruled:

1.

The Dominancy Test focuses on the similarity of the prevalent
features of the competing trademarks which might cause
confusion or deception, and thus infringement.

The Holistic Test requires that the entirety of the marks
in question be considered in resolving confusing similarity.
Comparison of words is not the only determining factor.

“x x x It has been consistently held that the question of
infringement of a trademark is to be determined by the test of
dominancy. Similarity in size, form and color, while relevant, is not
conclusive. If the competing trademark contains the main or essential
or dominant features of another, and confusion and deception is
likely to result, infringement takes place. Duplication or imitation
is not necessary; nor is it necessary that the infringing label should
suggest an effort to imitate. ( G. Heilman Brewing Co. u. Independent
Brewing Co., 191 F., 489, 495, citing Eagle White Lead Co. v. Pflugh
(CC) 180 Fed. 579) The question at issue in cases of infringement of
trademarks is whether the use of the marks involved would be likely
to cause confusion or mistakes in the mind of the public or deceive
purchasers. (Auburn Rubber Corporation v. Honover Rubber Co., 107
F. 2d 588; x x x). (Emphasis supplied)

The trademarks in their entirety as they appear in their
respective labels or hang tags must also be considered in relation
to the goods to which they are attached. The discerning eye of the
observer must focus not only on the predominant words but also on
the other features appearing in both labels in order that he may
draw his conclusion whether one is confusingly similar to the other.
(Emerald Garment Manufacturing Corporation v. Court of Appeals,
251 SCRA 600 [1995])

The Court reiterated the dominancy test in Lim Hoa v. Director
of Patents, 100 Phil. 214 (1956), Phil. Nut Industry, Inc. v. Standard
Brands Inc., 65 SCRA 575 (1975), Converse Rubber Corporation v.
Universal Rubber Products, Inc., 147 SCRA 154 (1987), and Asia
Brewery, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 224 SCRA 437 (1993). In the 2001
case of Societe Des Produits Nestle, SA. u. Court of Appeals, G.R.
No. 112012, 356 SCRA 207 (2001), the Court explicitly rejected the
holistic test in this wise:

If the competing trademark contains the main, essential or
dominant features of another, and confusion or deception is likely
to result, infringement takes place. Duplication or imitation is not
necessary; nor is it necessary that the infringing label should suggest
an effort to imitate. The question is whether the use of the marks
involved is likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the
public or deceive purchasers.

2.

Dominancy test, to determine question of Infringement

“[T]he totality or holistic test is contrary to the elementary
postulate of the law on trademarks and unfair competition
that confusing similarity is to be determined on the basis of
visual, aural, connotative comparisons and overall impressions
engendered by the marks in controversy as they are encountered
in the realities of the marketplace.” (Emphasis supplied)

The Supreme Court has relied on the dominancy test rather
than the holistic test. The dominancy test considers the dominant
features in the competing marks in determining whether they are
confusingly similar. Under the dominancy test, courts give greater
weight to the similarity of the appearance of the product arising
from the adoption of the dominant features of the registered mark,
disregarding minor differences. (Amador, Trademarks Under The

The test of dominancy is now explicitly incorporated into law
in Section 155.1 of the Intellectual Property Code which defines
infringement as the “colorable imitation of a registered mark x x x

368

Criminal Law

or a dominant feature thereof." (See McDonald’s Corp., et al. v. L.C.
Big Mak Corp., et al., G.R. No. 143993, August 18, 2004)
Types of confusion arising from the use of similar or colorable
imitation marks.
1.

Confusion of goods (product confusion)

The ordinarily prudent purchaser would be induced to
purchase one product in the belief that he was purchasing
the other.
2.

Confusion of business (source or origin confusion)
Though the goods of the parties are different, the
defendant’s product is such as might reasonably be
assumed to originate with the plaintiff, and the public
would then be deceived either into that belief or into the
belief that there is some connection between the plaintiff
and defendant which, in fact, does not exist. (Sterling
Products International, Incorporated u. Farbenfabriken
Bayer Aktiengesellschaft, et al., ibid., 137 Phil. 838 [1969])

Types of confusion, distinguished.

There is confusion of goods when the products are competing.
Confusion of business exists when the products are non-competing but
related enough to produce confusion of affiliation. (Agpalo, The Law
on Trademark, Infringement and Unfair Competition 45-46 [2000])

Examples of trademark infringement:
1. The trademark “Marlboro” was not only valid for being
neither generic nor descriptive, it was also exclusively owned by
PMPI, as evidenced by the certificates of registration issued by
the Intellectual Property Office. The counterfeit cigarettes seized
from Gemma’s possession were intended to confuse and deceive the
public as to the origin of the cigarettes intended to be sold, as they
not only bore PMPI’s “Marlboro” mark, but they were also packaged
almost exactly as PMPI’s products. Gemma is liable for trademark
infringement. (Gemma Ong v. People, G.R. No. 169440, November 23,

2011)

2. “NANNY” is confusingly similar to “NAN.” “NAN” is the
prevalent feature of Nestle’s line of infant powdered milk products.
It is written in bold letters and used in all products. The line consists
of PRE-NAN, NAN-H.A., NAN-1, and NAN-2. Clearly, “NANNY”
contains the prevalent feature “NAN.” The first three letters of
“NANNY” are exactly the same as the letters of “NAN.” When “NAN”
and “NANNY” are pronounced, the aural effect is confusingly similar.
NANNY and NAN have the same classification, descriptive properties
and physical attributes. Both are classified under Class 6, both are
milk products, and both are in powder form. Also, NANNY and NAN
are displayed in the same section of stores the milk section. NANNY
infringes the registered NAN trademark. ( Societe Des Produits Nestle,

—

SA.. v. Dy, supra)
3. The use of the stylized “S” by respondent in its Strong
rubber shoes infringes on the mark already registered by petitioner
with the IPO. While it is undisputed that petitioner’s stylized “S” is
within an oval design, the dominant feature of the trademark is the
stylized “S,” as it is precisely the stylized “S” which catches the eye of
the purchaser. Thus, even if respondent did not use an oval design,
the mere fact that it used the same stylized “S,” the same being the
dominant feature of petitioner’s trademark, already constitutes
infringement under the Dominancy Test. Furthermore, respondent
did not simply use the letter “S,” but based on the font and the size
of the lettering, the stylized “S” utilized by respondent is the very
same stylized “S” used by petitioner; a stylized “S” which is unique
and distinguishes petitioner’s trademark. Indubitably, the likelihood
of confusion is present as purchasers will associate the respondent’s
use of the stylized “S” as having been authorized by petitioner or
that respondent’s product is connected with petitioner’s business.
(Skechers, Inc. v. Inter Pacific Industrial Trading Corp., G.R. No.
164321, March 23, 2011)

There must not be differences which are glaring and striking to
the eye.

It is true that between petitioner’s trademark “ALACTA and
respondent’s “ALASKA,” there are similarities in spelling, appearance
and sound, for both are composed of six letters of three syllables each
and each syllable has the same vowel, but in determining if they
are confusingly similar a comparison of said words is not the only
361

Art. 189

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

determining factor. The two marks in their entirety as they appear
in the respective labels must also be considered. While there are
similarities in the two marks, there are also differences which are
glaring and striking to the eye. Thus, the sizes of the containers of
the goods differ from each other. The colors, too, differ. Petitioner’s
mark has only the first letter capitalized and is printed in black, while
respondent’s mark has all the letters capitalized written in white.
(Mead Johnson & Co. u. Van Dorp, Ltd., et al., G.R. No. L-17501,
April 27, 1963)

Concept of related goods.

When goods are so related that the public may be, or is
actually, deceived and misled that they come from the same maker
or manufacturer, trademark infringement occurs.
Non-competing goods may be those which, though they are not in
actual competition, are so related to each other that it can reasonably
be assumed that they originate from one manufacturer, in which case,
confusion of business can arise out of the use of similar marks. They
may also be those which, being entirely unrelated, cannot be assumed
to have a common source; hence, there is no confusion of business,
even though similar marks are used. (Esso Standard Eastern, Inc. v.
Court of Appeals, 116 SCRA 336 [1982]) Thus, there is no trademark
infringement if the public does not expect the plaintiff to make or
sell the same class of goods as those made or sold by the defendant.
(I CALLMAN 1121 cited in Philippine Refining Co., Inc. v. Ng Sam
and the Director of Patents, 115 SCRA 472 [1982])

Product classification, not decisive factor in the determination of
whether goods are related.

Product classification alone cannot serve as the decisive factor
in the resolution of whether wines and cigarettes are related goods.
Emphasis should be on the similarity of the products involved and
not on the arbitrary classification or general description of their
properties or characteristics. (Mighty Corp. v. EJ Gallo Winery, G.R.
No. 154342, July 14, 2004)

If is not necessary that the goods of the prior user and the late user
of the trademark are of the same categories.

The law does not require that the articles of manufacture of the
previous user and the late user of the mark should possess the same
descriptive properties or should fall in the same categories as to bar
the latter from registering his mark in the principal register. (Chua
Che v. Philippine Patent Office, et al., 13 SCRA 67 [between toiletries
and laundry soap], citing Application Sylvan Sweets Co., 205 F. 2nd
207 [between candies and cigarettes])
Therefore, whether shirts and shoes have the same descriptive
properties, or whether or not it is the practice or the tendency of tailors
and haberdashers to expand their business into shoemaking, are not
controlling. The meat of the matter is the likelihood of confusion,
mistake or deception upon purchasers of the goods of the junior user
of the mark and the goods manufactured by the previous user. Here,
the resemblance or similarity of the mark FLORMANN and the
name FLORMEN and the likelihood of confusion, one to the other,
is admitted, therefore, the prior adopter has the better right to use
the mark. (Sta. Ana v. Maliwat, et al., 24 SCRA 1018)

UNFAIR COMPETITION
Any person who has identified in the mind of the public the
goods he manufactures or deals in, his business or services from
those of others, whether or not a registered mark is employed, has a
property right in the goodwill of the said goods, business or service
so identified, which will be protected in the same manner as other
property rights. (Sec. 168.1, IP Code)
Any person who shall employ deception or any other means
contrary to good faith by which he shall pass off the goods
manufactured by him or in which he deals, or his business, or services
for those of the one having established such goodwill, or who shall
commit any acts calculated to produce said result, shall be guilty of
unfair competition.

Art 189

In particular, and without in any way limiting the scope of
protection against unfair competition, the following shall be deemed
guilty of unfair competition:
(a) Any person, who is selling his goods and gives them the
general appearance of goods of another manufacturer
or dealer, whether as to the goods themselves or in the
wrapping of the packages in which they are contained, or
the devices or words appearing thereon, or in any other
feature of their appearance, which would be likely to

Art. 189

Intent to deceive the public and defraud a competitor. (V.
Amador, Trademarks Under The Intellectual Property Code
278 [1999])

The confusing similarity may or may not result from similarity
in the marks, but may result from other external factors in the
packaging or presentation of the goods. The intent to deceive and
defraud may be inferred from the similarity of the appearance of the
goods as offered for sale to the public. (Shell Co. of the Philippines,
Ltd. v. Ins. Petroleum Refining Co., Ltd., 120 Phil. 434 [1964]; “La
Insular" v. Jao Oge, 42 Phil. 366(1921])
Reason for punishing unfair competition.

The basis of the provision penalizing unfair competition is that
no one shall, by imitation or any unfair device, induce the public to
believe that the goods he offers for sale are the goods of another, and
thereby appropriate to himself the value of the reputation which the
other has acquired for the products or merchandise manufactured or
sold by him. (U.S. v. Kyburz, 28 Phil. 475)

Evidence of actual fraudulent Intent not necessary.

Any person who shall make any false statement in the
course of trade or who shall commit any other act contrary
to good faith of a nature calculated to discredit the goods,
business or services of another. (Secs. 168.2 and 168.3, IP

The intent to deceive or to defraud may be inferred from the
similarity in the appearance of the goods manufactured or sold by
the offender and those of the party claiming to have been damaged.

2. A used a paper ring upon the cigars manufactured by him,
similar to the paper ring placed by B on the cigar manufactured by the

3. A established large trade in candles which were put in
packages wrapped in a form upon which were printed the tradename

used packages of the same size, the same in form, in scheme, color,
pictures and design. They differ only in minute details. (Flaming &
Co. v. Ong Tan Chuan, 26 Phil. 579)
True test of unfair competition.

The true test of unfair competition is whether certain goods have
been clothed with an appearance which is likely to deceive the ordinary
purchaser exercising ordinary care, and not whether a certain limited
class of purchasers could avoid mistake by the exercise of this special
knowledge. (U.S. v. Manuel, 7 Phil. 221)
Liability of master for acts of servants.

The master is criminally responsible for acts of his servants and
employees in violation of the penal provisions touching trademarks,
tradenames and unfair competition if he causes the illegal act to
be done, or requests, commands or permits it, or in any manner
authorizes it, or aids or abets the servant in its commission, whether
he is present at the time the unlawful act is committed or not. (U.S.
v. Kyburz, 28 Phil. 475)

Trademark Infringement, distinguished from Unfair Competition.
1. Infringement of trademark is the unauthorized use of a
trademark, whereas unfair competition is the passing off of one’s
goods as those of another.

2. In infringement of trademark fraudulent intent is
unnecessary, whereas in unfair competition, fraudulent intent is
essential.

3. In infringement of trademark, the prior registration
of the trademark is a prerequisite to the action, whereas in unfair
competition, registration is not necessary. (Del Monte Corporation
v. Court of Appeals, 181 SCRA 410, 415(1990])
When trademark infringement constitutes unfair competition.

Trademark infringement constitutes unfair competition when
there is not merely likelihood of confusion, but also actual or probable
deception on the public because of the general appearance of the
goods. (McDonald’s Corp., et al. v. L.C. Big Mak Corp., et al., supra)
Illustration of trademark infringement and unfair competition.
McDonalds Corporation v. L.C. Big Mak Burger
(G.R. No.143993, August 18, 2004)
Facts: (1) McDonald’s operates, by itself or through its franchisees, a
global chain of fast-food restaurants and owns a family of marks, including
the “Big Mac” mark for its “double-decker hamburger sandwich. In September
1981, McDonald’s introduced its “Big Mac” hamburger sandwiches in the
Philippine market. On July 18, 1985, its “Big Mac” trademark was registered
in the Philippines.
(2)
Respondent L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc. is a domestic corporation
which operates fast-food outlets and snack vans in Metro Manila and nearby
provinces. Its menu includes hamburger sandwiches and other food items. On
October 21, 1988, it applied for the registration of the “Big Mak" trademark
for its hamburger sandwiches. McDonald’s opposed the “Big Mak” application
on the ground that it was a colorable imitation of its registered “Big Mac”
mark for the same food products. McDonald’s also informed respondent Dy,
the chairman of Respondent’s Board of Directors, of McDonald’s exclusive
right to the “Big Mac” mark and requested him to desist from using the
“Big Mac” mark or any similar mark.

(3) As respondent Dy did not reply, McDonald’s sued Respondent for
trademark infringement and unfair competition.
Held: Trademark Infringement - Respondent is liable for trademark
infringement. “Big Mac" falls under the class of fanciful or arbitrary marks
as it bears no logical relation to the actual characteristics of the product it
represents. As such, it is highly distinctive and thus valid. Respondent uses
its “Big Mak” mark on hamburgers, the same food product that McDonald’s
sells with the use of its registered mark “Big Mac.”

Respondents’ use of the “Big Mak” mark results in likelihood of
confusion. First, “Big Mak” sounds exactly the same as “Big Mac.” Second,
367

Art. 189

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

the first word in “Big Mak” is exactly the same as the first word in “Big Mac."
Third, the first two letters in “Mak” are the same as the first two letters in
“Mac." Fourth, the last letter in “Mak” while a “k” sounds the same as “c"
when the word “Mak” is pronounced. Fifth, in Filipino, the letter “k” replaces
“c” in spelling, thus “Caloocan” is spelled “Kalookan.” In short, aurally the two
marks are the same, with the first word of both marks phonetically the same,
and the second word of both marks also phonetically the same. Visually, the
two marks have both two words and six letters, with the first word of both
marks having the same letters and the second word having the same first two
letters. In spelling, considering the Filipino language, even the last letters of
both marks are the same. Clearly, respondents have adopted in “Big Mak"
not only the dominant but also almost all the features of “Big Mac.” Applied
to the same food product of hamburgers, the two marks will likely result in
confusion in the public mind.
Unfair Competition - Passing off (or palming off) takes place where
the defendant, by imitative devices on the general appearance of the goods,
misleads prospective purchasers into buying his merchandise under the
impression that they are buying that of his competitors. (Suncoast Tours,
Inc. v. Lambert Groups, Inc., 1999 WL 1034683 [ 1999]) Thus, the defendant
gives his goods the general appearance of the goods of his competitor with the
intention of deceiving the public that the goods are those of his competitor.

Respondents’ goods are hamburgers, which are also the goods of
McDonald’s. If respondents sold egg sandwiches only instead of hamburger
sandwiches, their use of the “Big Mak” mark would not give their goods the
general appearance of McDonald’s “Big Mac” hamburgers. In such case, there
is only trademark infringement but no unfair competition. However, since
respondents chose to apply the “Big Mak” mark on hamburgers, just like
McDonald’s use of the “Big Mac” mark on hamburgers, respondents have

obviously clothed their goods with the general appearance of McDonald’s
goods. Moreover, there is no notice to the public that the “Big Mak”
hamburgers are products of L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc. Thus, there is actually
no notice to the public that the “Big Mak” hamburgers are products of L.C. Big
Mak Burger, Inc. and not those of McDonald’s who have the exclusive right
to the “Big Mac” mark. This clearly shows respondents intent to deceive the
public. Had respondents placed a notice on their plastic wrappers and bags
that the hamburgers are sold by L.C. Big Mak Burger, Inc., then they could
validly claim that they did not intend to deceive the public. In such case,
there is only trademark infringement but no unfair competition. Respondents,
however, did not give such notice. L.C. Big Mak Burger is liable for unfair
competition.

There can be trademark Infringement without unfair competition.

he manufactures the goods, thus preventing the public from being

deceived that the goods originate from the trademark owner. (See

Q-Tips, Inc. v. Johnson & Johnson, 108 F.Supp 845 [1952])
Unfair competition under the New Civil Code.

“Unfair competition in agricultural, commercial or industrial
enterprise or in labor through the use of force, intimidation, deceit,
machination or any other unjust, oppressive or highhanded method
shall give rise to a right of action by the person who thereby suffers
damage.” (Art. 28 of the New Civil Code)
Facts: Respondent has been engaged in the manufacture
and distribution of plastic and metal products, including plasticmade automotive parts while petitioner has been engaged in the
manufacture and distribution of kitchenware items made of plastic
and metal. In view of the physical proximity of the parties’ offices
and the transfer of some of respondent’s employees to petitioner,
petitioner developed familiarity with respondent’s products. Sometime
in November 2000, respondent discovered that petitioner had been
manufacturing and distributing the same automotive parts with
similar design, same material and colors as respondent’s plasticmade automotive parts and to the same customers but was selling
these products at a lower price. Respondent alleged that it had
originated the use of plastic in place of rubber in the manufacture of
automotive underchassis parts and that petitioner’s manufacture of
the same automotive parts with plastic material which was taken from
respondent’s idea, and deliberate copying of respondent’s products,
constitute unfair competition.

Held: From Article 28 of the Civil Code, it is clear that what is
being sought to be prevented is not competition per se, but the use of
uiyust, oppressive or high-handed methods which may deprive others
of a fair chance to engage in business or to earn a living. Plainly, what
the law prohibits is unfair competition and not competition where
the means used are fair and legitimate.

In order to qualify the competition as “unfair,” it must have

two characteristics: (1) it must involve an injury to a competitor or
trade rival, and (2) it must involve acts which are characterized as
“contrary to good conscience,” or “shocking to judicial sensibilities,”
or otherwise unlawful; in the language of our law, these include force,
369

Art. 189

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

intimidation, deceit, machination or any other unjust, oppressive or
high-handed method. The public injury or interest is a minor factor;
the essence of the matter appears to be a private wrong perpetrated
by unconscionable means.
Here, both characteristics are present. First, both parties are
competitors or trade rivals, both being engaged in the manufacture
of plastic-made automotive parts. Second, the acts of the petitioner
were clearly “contrary to good conscience” as petitioner admitted
having employed respondent’s former employees, deliberately copied

respondent’s products and even went to the extent of selling these
products to respondent’s customers. Thus, it is evident that petitioner
is engaged in unfair competition as shown by his act of suddenly
shifting his business from manufacturing kitchenware to plasticmade automotive parts; his luring the employees of the respondent
to transfer to his employ and trying to discover the trade secrets
of the respondent. CWillaware Products Corporation v. Jesichris

Regional trial courts have jurisdiction over violations of intellectual

who acts as a broker in any of such transactions, in violation of RA
No. 9165. (Sec. 3[ff])
ILLEGAL IMPORTATION OF DANGEROUS DRUGS

Black’s Law Dictionary defines importation as “the act of bringing
goods and merchandise into a country from a foreign country.” Thus,
for an accused to be held liable for importation of dangerous drugs,
the drugs must come from a source outside the Philippines. (People
v. Chi Can Liu, G.R. No. 189272, January 21, 2015)
The crime is committed by any person, who, unless authorized
by law, shall import or bring into the Philippines (a) any dangerous
drug, regardless of the quantity and purity involved, including any
and all species of opium poppy or any part thereof or substances
derived therefrom even for floral, decorative and culinary purposes,
or (b) any controlled precursor and essential chemical. (Sec. 4, RA.

No. 9165)

Illustration:

2.8 kilograms was found in the luggage claimed by Tsang at the
interline office upon his arrival at the Manila International Airport in

on Thai International Airways from Bangkok. Inside the suitcase were

any other consideration. (Sec. 3 [II], R.A. No. 9165)

Importation of opium poppy plant or parts thereof for floral,
decorative and culinary purposes is prohibited.

To secure a conviction for illegal sale of dangerous drugs under
Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, the prosecution must establish
the following elements:

Opium poppy refers to any part of the plant of the species
Papaver Somniferum L., Papaver Setigerum DC, Papaver Orientals,
Papaver Bracteatum and Papaver Rhoeas, which includes the seeds,
straws, branches, leaves or any part thereof, or substances derived
therefrom, even for floral, decorative and culinary purposes. (Sec.
3[z], R.A. No. 9165)

The opium poppy plant is a flowering ornamental plant, from
which both opium and poppy seeds are derived. Poppy seeds are
consumed as food while the plant may be used for ornamental
purposes such as in flower arrangements. However, regardless of its
intended use, the importation of opium poppy or parts thereof, such
as seeds, is strictly prohibited.

Thus, a flower shop owner who imports opium poppy plants for
use in flower arrangements is liable for importation of dangerous
drugs, and his/her lack of knowledge that such importation is
prohibited is not a defense in a prosecution for importation of
dangerous drugs.

(1) Sale.

“Sell is any act of giving away any dangerous drug and/or
controlled precursor and essential chemical whether for money or

(1)

the identity of the buyer and the seller, the object of the
sale and its consideration; and

(2)

the delivery of the thing sold and the payment therefor.

What is important is that the sale transaction of drugs actually
took place and that the object of the transaction is properly presented
as evidence in court and is shown to be the same drugs seized from
the accused.

In cases of illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous
drugs, the dangerous drug seized from the accused constitutes the
corpus delicti of the offense. Thus, it is of utmost importance that
the integrity and identity of the seized drugs must be shown to have
been duly preserved. The chain of custody rule performs this function
as it ensures that unnecessary doubts concerning the identity of the
evidence are removed. (People v. Ismael, G.R. No. 208093, February
20,2017)

Penalty for sale of dangerous drugs is not dependent on quantity

SALE, TRADING, ADMINISTRATION, DISPENSATION, DELIVERY,
DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSPORTATION.

The crime of illegal sale, trading, administration, dispensation,
deliveiy, distribution and transportation of dangerous drugs and/or
controlled precursors and essential chemicals is committed by any
person, who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, trade, administer,
dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute dispatch in transit
or transport (a) any dangerous drug, including any and all species
of opium poppy regardless of the quantity and purity involved, or
shall act as a broker in any of such transactions, or (b) any controlled
precursor and essential chemical, or shall act as a broker in such

Unlike possession of dangerous drugs where the imposable
penalty depends on the quantity of the regulated drug involved,
the penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from
P500,000 to PIO,000,000 is imposed for the sale, trade, administration,
dispensation, delivery, distribution and transportation of dangerous
drugs, regardless of the quantity involved.
(2) Trading.

Trading is defined as transactions involving the illegal
trafficking of dangerous drugs and/or controlled precursors and
essential chemicals using electronic devices such as, but not limited
to, text messages, email, mobile or landlines, two-way radios, internet,

such transactions whether for money or any other consideration in

inmates, not being lawfully authorized by law and through the
use of mobile phones and other electronic devices, did then and
there willfully and unlawfully trade and traffic dangerous drugs,
and thereafter give and deliver to De Lima, through Ragos and
Dayan, the proceeds of illegal drug trading. (De Lima v. Guerrero,

Administration.

“Administer” is any act of introducing any dangerous drug
into the body of any person, with or without his/her knowledge, by
injection, inhalation, ingestion or other means, or of committing
any act of indispensable assistance to a person in administering a
dangerous drug to himself/herself unless administered by a duly
licensed practitioner for purposes of medication. (Sec. 3[a], R.A. No.

(4) Dispensation.

“Dispense” is any act of giving away, selling or distributing
medicine or any dangerous drug with or without the use of
prescription. (Sec. 3[m], R.A. No. 9165)
(5) Delivery.

“Deliver” is any act of knowingly passing a dangerous drug to
another, personally or otherwise, and by any means, with or without
consideration. (Sec. 3[k], R.A. No. 9165)

When PO1 Arugay appeared for his purportedly indisposed cousin,
Carpio, and asked for his order of shabu, accused-appellant Maongco
immediately understood what PO1 Arugay meant. Accused -appellant
Maongco took out a sachet of shabu from his pocket and handed over
possession of said sachet to PO1 Arugay. Accused-appellant Maongco
is guilty of illegal delivery of shabu. (People v. Maongco, G.R. No.
196966, October 23, 2013)
Proof of payment is not necessary in illegal delivery of dangerous
drugs.

The presentation of the marked money, as well as the fact that
the money was paid in exchange for the delivery of dangerous drugs,
are unnecessary to consummate the crime.

Even if the money given to De la Cruz was not presented in
court, the same would not militate against the People’s case. In fact,
there was even no need to prove that the marked money was handed
to the appellants in payment of the goods. The crime could have been
consummated by the mere delivery of the prohibited drugs. What
the law proscribes is not only the act of selling but also the act of
delivering. In the latter case, the act of knowingly passing a dangerous
drug to another personally or otherwise, and by any means, with or
without consideration, consummates the offense. (People v. de la Cruz,
263 Phil. 340 [1990])

MANUFACTURE OF ILLEGAL DRUGS
Manufacture is the production, preparation, compounding or
processing of any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and
essential chemical, either directly or indirectly or by extraction from
substances of natural origin, or independently by means of chemical
synthesis or by a combination of extraction and chemical synthesis,
and shall include any packaging or repackaging of such substances,
design or configuration of its form, or labeling or relabeling of its
container; except that such terms do not include the preparation,
compounding, packaging or labeling of a drug or other substances by a
duly authorized practitioner as an incident to his/her administration
or dispensation of such drug or substance in the course of his/her
professional practice including research, teaching and chemical
analysis of dangerous drugs or such substances that are not intended
for sale or for any other purpose. (Sec. 3[u], R.A. No. 9165)
The crime is committed by any person, who, unless authorized
by law, shall engage in the manufacture of any dangerous drug. (Sec.
8, R.A. No. 9165)
Prima facie proof of manufacture of any dangerous drug.

The presence of any controlled precursor and essential chemical
or laboratory equipment in the clandestine laboratory is a prima facie
proof of manufacture of any dangerous drug. It shall be considered an
aggravating circumstance if the clandestine laboratory is undertaken
or established under the following circumstances:
(a)

Any phase of the manufacturing process was conducted in
the presence or with the help of minor/s;

(b)

Any phase or manufacturing process was established or
undertaken within 100 meters of a residential, business,
church or school premises;

(c)

Any clandestine laboratory was secured or protected with

booby traps;
(d)

Any clandestine laboratory was concealed with legitimate
business operations; or

(e)

Any employment of a practitioner, chemical engineer, public
official or foreigner. (Sec. 8)

TITLE FIVE
Crimes Relative to Opium and Other Prohibited Drugs

A “clandestine laboratory” is any facility used for the illegal

manufacture of any dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and
essential chemical. (Sec. 3[e], R.A. No. 9165)
ILLEGAL POSSESSION
Illegal possession of drugs is committed by any person, who,
unless authorized by law, shall possess any dangerous drug (Sec.
11, R.A. No. 9165) while illegal possession of drug paraphernalia is
committed by any person, who, unless authorized by law, shall possess
or have under his/her control any equipment, instrument, apparatus
and other paraphernalia fit or intended for smoking, consuming,
administering, injecting, ingesting, or introducing any dangerous
drug into the body. (Sec. 12, R.A. No. 9165)
The elements of illegal possession of drugs are:

1.

The accused was in possession of prohibited drug;

2.

Such possession is not authorized by law; and

3.

The accused freely and consciously possessed the prohibited
drug. (People v. Padua, G.R. No. 174097, July 21, 2010)

The elements of illegal possession of equipment, instrument,
apparatus and other paraphernalia for dangerous drugs are:
1.

Possession or control by the accused of any equipment,
apparatus or other paraphernalia fit or intended for
smoking, consuming, administering, injecting, ingesting,
or introducing any dangerous drug into the body; and

2.

Such possession is not authorized by law. (Saraum v.
People, G.R. No. 205472, January 25, 2016)

Illegal possession of dangerous drugs is necessarily included
in illegal sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery,
distribution and transportation of dangerous drugs.

The crime of illegal sale of dangerous drugs necessarily includes
the crime of illegal possession of dangerous drugs. (People v. Posada,
G.R. No. 194445, March 12, 2012, 667 SCRA 790, 812) The same
ruling may also be applied to the other acts penalized under Article
II, Section 5 of R.A. No. 9165 because for the accused to be able to
trade, administer, dispense, deliver, give away to another, distribute,
383

Criminal Law

dispatch in transit, or transport any dangerous drug, he must
necessarily be in possession of said drugs. (People v. Maongco, G.R.
No. 196966, October 23, 2013)
Criminal intent is not an essentia! element

Illegal possession of regulated drugs is mala prohibita, and,
as such, criminal intent is not an essential element. However, the
prosecution must prove that the accused had the intent to possess
(animus posidendi) the drugs. Possession, under the law, includes
not only actual possession, but also constructive possession. Actual
possession exists when the drug is in the immediate possession or
control of the accused. On the other hand, constructive possession
exists when the drug is under the dominion and control of the
accused or when he has the right to exercise dominion and control
over the place where it is found. Exclusive possession or control is not
necessary. The accused cannot avoid conviction if his right to exercise
control and dominion over the place where the contraband is located,
is shared with another. (People v. Lagman, G.R. No. 168695, December
8, 2008, citing People v. Torres, G.R. No. 170837, September 12, 2006)
Animus possldendl.

Mere possession of a prohibited drug constitutes prima facie
evidence of knowledge or animus possidendi sufficient to convict an
accused in the absence of satisfactory explanation. (People v. De Jesus,
G.R. No. 198794, February 6, 2013)
The finding of illicit drugs and paraphernalia in a house
or building owned or occupied by a particular person raises the
presumption of knowledge and possession thereof which, standing
alone, is sufficient to convict. (People v. Dela Trinidad, 742 Phil. 347,
358 [2014])

In a case where the policeman who raided a house found opium
and opium paraphernalia on a table around which the appellants and
theu- co-accused were gathered, it was held that the appellants and
their co-accused are presumed the possessors thereof, and such illegal
possession of such prohibited article is prima facie evidence that they
have used the prohibited drug. (People v. Lian, et al., 47 O.G. 5209)

384

TITLE FIVE
Crimes Relative to Opium and Other Prohibited Drugs

Example of lack of intent to possess.

While the policemen were searching the house for opium, the
wife was told by her husband to get from beneath a pillow a small
can said to contain opium and to throw it away.
Held: The wife had no intent to possess the opium. There is
no proof that she knew that the can contained opium. The mere fact
that she took possession of it under her husband’s order is not such
a possession as is intended to be condemned by the law. (U.S. v.
Concepcion, 31 Phil. 182)
The accused may rebut the presumption of knowledge and
establish the absence of knowledge on his part as to the presence of
the drugs in his premises. In this case, appellant testified that until
the moment of the raid, he had no knowledge of the presence of the
drugs on his premises. He declared also that the business was under
the control and superintendence of his foreman, Ko Seng, and that Ko

Seng placed the drugs in the place where they were found, concealing
from the appellant the fact that they were there. He showed also
that he had a considerable number of employees who occupied the
building and that the circumstances afforded every opportunity for
the concealment of the opium in or about his premises without the
possibility of his knowing of its presence. (U.S. v. Gan Lian Po, 34
Phil. 880)
Illegal possession of drugs.

Illustration: When the accused was frisked, marijuana was
found in the right pocket of his pants. The accused did not offer any
explanation on why he was in possession of the marijuana or if he
was authorized by law to possess the dangerous drug. Based on the
Dangerous Drugs Report, the dried crushed leaves and seeds wrapped
in newspaper and contained in the transparent plastic tea bag which
gave a positive result for marijuana, had a net weight of 1.0022 grams.
(People v. Zaragosa, G.R. No. 223142, January 17, 2018)
Illegal possession of drug paraphernalia.

Illustration: When the search warrant on the accused’s house
was served, several strips of used aluminum foil in a transparent
plastic bag, several pieces of used plastic sachet in a transparent tea
bag, and a plastic tube intended for sniffing shabu were found. Similar
385

the revised penal code
Criminal Law

to the marijuana, the accused failed to justify his possession of these
items. Significantly, the Dangerous Drugs Report showed that the
examination made on the washings of these confiscated items yielded
positive results for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride.
(People v. Zaragosa, ibid.)
Illegal possession of prohibited drugs during social gatherings is
more severely punished.

The maximum of the penalty shall be imposed if illegal
possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia is during parties, social
gatherings or meetings or in the proximate company of at least two
persons. (Secs. 13 and 14, RA. No. 9165)
What the law punishes is present possession of dangerous drugs.

One who is found with stains only of opium or its derivatives
upon the hands or clothing, cannot be convicted of having in his
possession opium or its derivatives. Stains of opium indicate merely
past possession thereof. What the law punishes is the present
possession of opium. (U.S. v. Tan Seng Ki, 28 Phil. 54)

TITLE FIVE
Crimes Relative to Opium and Other Prohibited Drugs
The law authorizes its use as medicine, but there must be a

prescription therefor by a physician. But an innocent purchaser of a

patent medicine or other medical preparation who is not aware that
such preparation contains opium is not guilty. (U.S. v. Lim Poco, 25
PhU. 84)
Possession of opium on board a vessel Is punishable when a
Philippine port is its destination.
When a foreign steamer anchored in any of our ports after
arriving direct from a foreign country, mere possession of opium
therein is punishable. (U.S. v. Ah Sing, 36 Phil. 978)

The ruling does not apply when the foreign vessel is in transit,
in which case mere possession of opium therein is not punishable.
DRUG DEN, DIVE, OR RESORT

A drug den, dive, or resort is a place where any dangerous drug
and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical is administered,
delivered, stored for illegal purposes, distributed, sold or used in any
form. (Sec. 3[1], R.A. No. 9165)

The term “shall possess’ is not limited to manual touch or
personal custody. A principal acting through an agent comes within
the purview of this expression.

The crime of maintenance of a den, dive, or resort is committed
by any person or group of persons who shall maintain a den, dive or
resort where (a) any dangerous drug is used or sold in any form, or
(b) any controlled precursor and essential chemical is used or sold in
any form. (Sec. 6, R.A. No. 9165)

Thus, where the boatman carried in his boat a sack, without
knowing that it contained opium, he is not liable. It is the owner of
the opium, who is liable for illegal possession thereof, although the
opium was found in the boatman’s possession.

An employee of a den, dive or resort, who is aware of the nature of
the place as such, and a person who, not being an employee, is aware
of the nature of the place as such and shall knowingly visit the same
are also liable for violation of Section 6 of R.A. No. 195.

"Shall possess.”

The words“shall possess" that is, the relation between the owner
of the drug and the drug itself, when the owner is not in actual physical
possession, but when it is still under his control and management
and subject to his disposition. (U.S. v. Chan Guy Juan, 23 Phil. 105)
Patent medicine containing opium.

The legislature has intended to penalize the unauthorized use
of opium even for medicinal purposes.
386

Persons liable:
1.

3.

Person maintaining a drug den, dive, or resort where any
dangerous drug is used or sold.
Employees of a den, dive, or resort, who is aware of the
nature of the place as such.

of the place as such.

Maintenance of a drug den, dive or resort.
Elements:

1.

2.

The place is a den - a place where any dangerous drug
and/or controlled precursor and essential [chemical]
is administered, delivered, stored for illegal purposes,
distributed, sold, or used in any form;
The accused maintains the said place. (People v. Galicia,
G.R. No. 218402, February 14, 2018)

Illustration:
A drug den is a lair or hideaway where prohibited or regulated
drugs are used in any form or are found. Its existence may be proved
not only by direct evidence but may also be established by proof of
facts and circumstances, including evidence of the general reputation
of the house, or its general reputation among police officers.(People v.
Ladjaalam, 395 Phil. 1, 19-20) This fact was proven by the testimony
of PO2 Martinez, the poseur-buyer, who after buying the shabu had
told the appellant that he wanted to sniff the same to which the latter
responded by requiring the former to pay a rental fee of P10.00. The
appellant then allowed PO2 Martinez to enter his house and directed
him to proceed to one of the rooms located at the right side of the
sala. Upon entering the said room, PO2 Martinez saw three other
persons already sniffing shabu. This testimony of PO2 Martinez was
corroborated by PO3 Yanson and P/Sr. Insp. Sanchez. Moreover,
several peso bills were found in the appellant’s wallet, including three
P10.00 peso bills, which circumstances bolstered the prosecution’s
assertion that the appellant has indeed allowed his house to be used
as a drug den for a fee of P10.00 per person. (People v. Rom, G.R. No.
198452, February 19, 2014)
Maintenance of a drug den, not proved.
For an accused to be convicted of maintenance of a drug den,
the prosecution must establish with proof beyond reasonable doubt
that the accused is maintaining a den where any dangerous drug is
administered, used, or sold. It must be established that the alleged
drug den is a place where dangerous drugs are regularly sold to and/
or used by customers of the maintainer of the
den.
388

TITLE FIVE
Crimes Relative to Opium and Other Prohibited Drugs

The prosecution failed to establish that the shanty where
appellant was found was a place where dangerous drugs were sold
or used. The prosecution’s witnesses merely testified that when they
entered Target No. 8, they found drug paraphernalia inside the shanty
and sachets of crystalline substance in the person of the appellant.
The prosecution failed to allege and prove an essential element of
the offense - that dangerous drugs were being sold or used inside the
shanty located at Target No. 8. What was clear was that appellant
was caught in possession of shabu and drug paraphernalia. There was
nothing in evidence that would indicate that the arresting officers
saw that dangerous drugs were being sold and/or used at Target
No. 8 in the course of the search of the premises. Since there was no
evidence that dangerous drugs were sold and/or used in the shanty
located at Target No. 8, appellant may not be held liable for violation
of Section 6, Article II, RA No. 9165 on maintenance of a drug den.
(People v. Galicia, supra)
Employee of den, dive or resort.

“Employee of Den, Dive or Resort” is the caretaker, helper,
watchman, lookout, and other persons working in the den, dive or
resort, employed by the maintainer, owner and/or operator where any
dangerous drug and/or controlled precursor and essential chemical
is administered, delivered, distributed, sold or used, with or without
compensation, in connection with the operation thereof. (Sec. 3[p],

R.A. No. 9615)
Visitor who knowingly visits a drug den, dive or resort.
Before a person may be convicted for knowingly vising a drug
den, it must be shown that he or she knew that the place visited was
a drug den, and still visited the place despite this knowledge. (Coronel
v. People, G.R. No. 214536, March 13, 2017)
The prosecution must prove that the visitor knew that the place
was a drug den.
Assuming that persons who test positive for drugs used them
at the place of arrest is not sufficient to show that they were aware
of the nature of the suspected drug den before visiting it, absent any
other circumstantial evidence. There was no attempt to show that
petitioners knew the nature of the alleged drug den, or even that they
389

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

used drugs in the premises. The petitioners were not found to be in
possession of any drugs. When petitioners were arrested, nobody
was found “in the act of using, selling or buying illegal drugs, nor
packaging nor hiding nor transporting the same.” There were no acts
alleged or evidence found, which would tend to show a familiarity
with the nature of the place as a drug den. Petitioners are acquitted
of the charge of knowingly visiting a drug den. (Coronel u. People,
G.R. No. 214536, March 13, 2017)
A person who visited another who was smoking opium is not liable,
If the place Is not a drug den, dive or resort.

The accused was charged with having permitted one Ong Ting
to use opium personally and with having knowingly visited the place
where said Chinaman was smoking opium. It was held that it was
not unlawful to be in a room in which another was smoking opium,
unless the place is an opium den. (U.S. v. Sy Bun Kue, 34 Phil. 176)

USE OF DANGEROUS DRUGS

’Use" is any act of injecting, intravenously or intramuscularly, of
consuming, either by chewing, smoking, sniffing, eating, swallowing,
drinking or otherwise introducing into the physiological system of the
body, any of the dangerous drugs. (Sec. 3 [kk], R.A. No. 9165)

Prima facie evidence of use.

The possession of equipment, instrument, apparatus and other
paraphernalia fit or intended for smoking, consuming, administering,
injecting, ingesting, or introducing any dangerous drug into the
body shall be prima facie evidence that the possessor has smoked,
consumed, administered to himselfTherself, injected, ingested or used
a dangerous drug and shall be presumed to have violated Section 15
on use of dangerous drug. (Sec. 12, R.A. No. 9165)
If use and possession co-exist, the penalty for possession shall

TITLE FIVE

Crimes Relative to Opium and Other Prohibited Drugs
Drug trafficking is punished more harshly than drug use.

The intention of the legislators in Section 24 of R.A. No. 9165 is
to provide stiffer and harsher punishment for those persons convicted
of drug trafficking or pushing while extending a sympathetic and
magnanimous hand in Section 70 to drug dependents who are found
guilty of violation of Sections 11 and 15 of the Act. The law considers
the users and possessors of illegal drugs as victims while the drug
traffickers and pushers as predators. Hence, while drug traffickers and
pushers, like Padua, are categorically disqualified from availing the law
on probation, youthful drug dependents, users and possessors alike, are
given the chance to mend their ways.

The law indeed appears strict and harsh against drug traffickers
and drug pushers while protective of drug users. To illustrate, a
person arrested for using illegal or dangerous drugs is meted only
a penalty of six months rehabilitation in a government center, as
minimum, for the first offense under Section 15 of R.A. No. 9165,
while a person charged and convicted of selling dangerous drugs shall
suffer life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from P500.000 to
PIO,000,000 under Section 5, R.A. No. 9165. (Padua v. People, GJi.
No. 168546, July 23, 2008)
Use of dangerous drugs is a qualifying aggravating circumstances
in the commission of a crime.

A positive finding for the use of dangerous drugs shall be a
qualifying aggravating circumstance in the commission of a crime
by an offender, and the application of the penalty provided for in
the Revised Penal Code shall be applicable. (Sec. 25, R.A. No. 9165)
PRESCRIPTION OF DANGEROUS DRUGS

The two acts relating to prescription of dangerous drugs that
violate P.D. No. 9165 are:
1.

Unnecessary Prescription of Dangerous Drugs

If the person tested is also found to have in his/her possession
such quantity of any dangerous drug, then the penalty for possession
shall be imposed. (Sec. 12, R.A. No. 9165)

Unnecessary prescription of dangerous drugs is committed by a
practitioner, who shall prescribe any dangerous drug to any person
whose physical or physiological condition does not require the use or
in the dosage prescribed therein, as determined by the Dangerous
Drugs Board in consultation with recognized competent experts

who are authorized representatives of professional organizations
of practitioners, particularly those who are involved in the care of

“Practitioner” refers to any person who is a licensed physician,
dentist, chemist, medical technologist, nurse, midwife, veterinarian
or pharmacist in the Philippines. (Sec. 18, R.A. No. 9165)
2.

Unlawful prescription of dangerous drugs

Unlawful prescription of dangerous drugs is committed by

any dangerous drug. (Sec. 19, R.A. No. 9165)

TITLE FIVE

Crimes Relative to Opium and Other Prohibited Drugs

held that a person who failed to adequately explain his presence at
the plantation teeming with fully grown marijuana plants is guilty
of illegal cultivation and culture.
However, where police officers found marijuana plants beneath
gabi plants in the accused’s home after receiving a report that
accused was illegally planting marijuana, the Court held that the
seized plants were inadmissible in evidence as their discovery was
not inadvertent. As held in People v. Valdez, 395 Phil. 206 (2000),
the “plain view” doctrine cannot apply if the officers are actually
“searching” for evidence against the accused. (People v. Acosta, G.R.
No. 238865, January 28, 2019)

CHEMICAL DIVERSION
CULTIVATION AND CULTURE

Cultivate or Culture.

“Cultivate or culture” is any act of knowingly planting, growing,
raising, or permitting the planting, growing or raising of any plant
which is the source of a dangerous drug. (Sec. 3[i], R.A. No. 9165)
Illegal cultivation or culture is committed by any person, who
shall plant, cultivate or culture marijuana, opium poppy or any other
plant regardless of quantity, which is or may hereafter be classified
as a dangerous drug or as a source from which any dangerous drug
may be manufactured or derived. (Sec. 16, R.A. No. 9165)
In People v. Alunday, G.R. No. 181546, September 3, 2008,
appellant was convicted of illegal cultivation and culture of prohibited
drugs based on the following: (1) A police contingent raided a
marijuana plantation located in Mount Churyon, Sadanga, Mountain
Province; (2) in the course thereof, appellant was seen cutting and
gathering marijuana plants from the premises; (3) there were no
other plants except marijuana which were growing in the said area;
(4) there was a hut apparently used by appellant and
an old woman
as a camp or temporary dwelling which existed alone within the area
of the subject plantation; and (5) the samples taken from the said
plantation were all found to be positive for marijuana.
In Zanoria v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 110163, December 15,
1997, where members of the Philippine Army found a plantation of

Chemical Diversion is the sale, distribution, supply or transport
of legitimately imported, in transit, manufactured or procured
controlled precursors and essential chemicals, in diluted, mixtures
or in concentrated form, to any person or entity engaged in the
manufacture of any dangerous drug, and shall include packaging,
repackaging, labeling, relabeling or concealment of such transaction
through fraud, destruction of documents, fraudulent use of permits,
misdeclaration, use of front companies or mail fraud. (Sec. 3[d], RA
No. 9165)
Illegal chemical diversion is committed by any person, who,
unless authorized by law, shall illegally divert any controlled
precursor and essential chemical. (Sec. 9, R.A. No. 9165)

BUY-BUST OPERATION
A buy-bust operation is a form of entrapment, which in recent
years has been accepted as a valid means of arresting violators
of the Dangerous Drugs Law. It is commonly employed by police
officers as an effective way of apprehending law offenders in the act
of committing a crime. In a buy-bust operation, the idea to commit
a crime originates from the offender, without anybody inducing or
prodding him to commit the offense. Its opposite is instigation or
inducement, wherein the police or its agent lures the accused into
committing the offense in order to prosecute him. Instigation is
deemed contrary to public policy and considered an absolutory cause.
(People v. Ong, 476 Phil. 553, 571-573 [2004])

Criminal Law

“Objective" test in buy-bust operation.

Tn buy-bust operations, the prosecution must present a complete
picture detailing the transaction, which “must start from the initial
contact between the poseur-buyer and the pusher, the offer to
purchase, the promise or payment of the consideration until the
consummation of the sale by the delivery of the illegal drug subject
of the sale. We emphasized that the manner by which the initial
contact was made, the offer to purchase the drug, the payment of
the ‘buy-bust’ money, and the delivery of the illegal drug must be the
subject of strict scrutiny by courts to insure that law-abiding citizens
are not unlawfully induced to commit an offense.” (People v. Doria,
361 Phil. 595, 621 [1999])
CHAIN OF CUSTODY REQUIREMENT
Chain of custody.

Chain of custody is defined as “the duly recorded authorized
movements and custody of seized drugs or controlled chemicals or
plant sources of dangerous drugs or laboratory equipment of each
stage, from the time of seizure/confiscation to receipt in the forensic
laboratory to safekeeping to presentation in court for destruction.”
Such record of movements and custody of seized item shall include the
identity and signature of the person who held temporary custody of
the seized item, the date and time when such transfer of custody were
made in the course of safekeeping and use in court as evidence, and
the final disposition. (Sec. l[b] of Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation
No. 1, Series of 2002; People v. Ameril, G.R. No. 203293, November
14, 2016)

The chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an
exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that
the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be. Ideally,
the evidence presented by the prosecution should include testimony
about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was picked
up to the time it was offered into evidence. The prosecution should
present evidence establishing the chain of custody in such a way that
every person who touched the exhibit would describe how and from
whom it was received, where it was and what happened to it while
in the witness possession, the condition in which it was received and
the condition in which it was delivered to the next link in the chain.”
394

(Mallillin v. People, 576 Phil. 576, 587 [2008]) In addition, these
witnesses should describe the precautions taken to ensure that there
had been no change in the condition of the item and that there had
been no opportunity for someone not in the chain to have possession
of the same. (People v. Martinez, et al., 652 Phil. 347, 369 [2010])
The links that the prosecution must establish in the chain of
custody in a buy-bust situation are as follows:
First, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug
recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer;
Second, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the
apprehending officer to the investigating officer;
Third, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug
to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and

Fourth, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug
seized by the forensic chemist to the court. (People v. Dahil, 745 SCRA
221 [2015])
When nagging doubts persist on whether the item confiscated is
the same specimen examined and established to be prohibited drug,
there can be no crime of illegal possession of a prohibited drug. (People
v. Gariana, G.R. No. 184761, September 8, 2010)
Required procedure in seizure and custody of drugs.

The required procedure on the seizure and custody of drugs
under Section 21, Article II of the Implementing Rules and Regulations
of R.A. No. 9165, as amended by R.A. No. 10640, is as follows:
(a)

The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and
control of the dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and
essential chemicals, instruments/paraphernalia and/or
laboratory equipment shall, immediately after seizure
and confiscation, conduct a physical inventory of the

is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided,
further, That non-compliance with these requirements

Strict compliance with the prescribed procedure is required
because of the illegal drug’s unique characteristic rendering it
indistinct, not readily identifiable, and easily open to tampering,
alteration or substitution either by accident or otherwise. (People v.
Pagaduan, G.R. No. 179029, August 12, 2010)
(b)

Marking of Seized Evidence.
The venues of the physical inventory and photography of the
seized items differ and depend on whether the seizure was made by
virtue of a search warrant or through a warrantless seizure such as
a buy-bust operation.

In seizures covered by search warrants, the physical
inventory and photograph must be conducted in the place where the
search warrant was served. On the other hand, in case of warrantless
seizures such as a buy-bust operation, the physical inventory and
photograph shall be conducted at the nearest police station or office
of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable; however,
nothing prevents the apprehending officer/team from immediately
conducting the physical inventory and photography of the items at
396

TITLE FIVE
Crimes Relative to Opium and Other Prohibited Drugs

the place where they were seized, as it is more in keeping with the
law’s intent of preserving their integrity and evidentiary value.

What Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 and its implementing rule
do not expressly specify is the matter of “marking” of the seized
items in warrantless seizures to ensure that the evidence seized
upon apprehension is the same evidence subjected to inventory and
photography when these activities are undertaken at the police station
rather than at the place of arrest. Consistency with the “chain, of
custody" rule requires that the “marking” of the seized items to
truly ensure that they are the same items that enter the chain and
are eventually the ones offered in evidence should be done (1) in the
presence of the apprehended violator (2) immediately upon
confiscation. This step initiates the process of protecting innocent
persons from dubious and concocted searches, and of protecting as well
the apprehending officers from harassment suits based on planting
of evidence under Section 29 and on allegations of robbery or theft.

—

-

For greater specificity, “marking” means the placing by
the apprehending officer or the poseur-buyer of his/her initials
and signature on the item/s seized. If the physical inventory and
photograph are made at the nearest police station or office as allowed
by the rules, the inventory and photography of the seized items must
be made in accordance with Section 2 of Board Resolution No. 1,
Series of 2002, but in every case, the apprehended violator or counsel
must be present. Again, this is in keeping with the desired level of
integrity that the handling process requires. Thereafter, the seized
items shall be placed in an envelope or an evidence bag unless the type
and quantity of the seized items require a different type of handling
and/or container. The evidence bag or container shall accordingly be
signed by the handling officer and turned over to the next officer in
the chain of custody. (People v. Sanchez, G.R. No. 175832, October
15, 2008)

Procedure In marking and sealing seized or confiscated substance.
People v. Habana, G.R. No. 188900, March 5, 2010, thoroughly
discusses the proper procedure for the custody of seized or confiscated
items in dangerous drugs cases in order to ensure their identity and
integrity, as follows:
397

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law
Usually, the police officer who seizes the suspected
substance turns it over to a supervising officer, who would
then send it by courier to the police crime laboratory for
testing. Since it is unavoidable that possession of the
substance changes hand a number of times, it is imperative
for the officer who seized the substance from the suspect
to place his marking on its plastic container and seal
the same, preferably with adhesive tape that cannot be
removed without leaving a tear on the plastic container. At
the trial, the officer can then identify the seized substance
and the procedure he observed to preserve its integrity
until it reaches the crime laboratory.

If the substance is not in a plastic container, the
officer should put it in one and seal the same. In this way
the substance would assuredly reach the laboratory in the
same condition it was seized from the accused. Further,
after the laboratory technician tests and verifies the nature
of the substance in the container, he should put his own
mark on the plastic container and seal it again with a new
seal since the police officer’s seal has been broken. At the
trial, the technician can then describe the sealed condition
of the plastic container when it was handed to him and
testify on the procedure he took afterwards to preserve its
integrity.
If the sealing of the seized substance has not been
made, the prosecution would have to present every police
officer, messenger, laboratory technician, and storage
personnel, the entire chain of custody, no matter how
briefly one’s possession has been. Each of them has to
testify that the substance, although unsealed, has not been
tampered with or substituted while in his care.

Summary of chain of custody requirement
1.

Immediately after seizure and confiscation, apprehending officer
should conduct a physical inventory and photograph the seized
substances at the place where search warrant is served or in
case of warrantless seizures, at the nearest police station or
nearest office of the apprehending officer/team
398

TITLE FIVE
Crimes Relative to Opium and Other Prohibited Drugs
The physical inventory and photograph taking should be made
in the presence of the following:
a. accused or the person/s from whom such items were
confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or
counsel;
b. an elected public official; and
c. a representative of the National Prosecution Service or the
media.
3. The witnesses should sign copies of the inventory and be given
a copy thereof.
4. The seized substance should be placed in a plastic container
and the apprehending officer should place his marking in the
container and seal the same with a seal, e.g. adhesive tape,
that cannot be removed without leaving a tear on the plastic
container.
5. The marked evidence must then be turned over by the
apprehending officer to the investigating officer.
6. The investigating officer must turn over the marked evidence to
the PDEA Forensic Laboratory for examination within 24 hours
from confiscation.
7. After testing of the seized substance in the crime laboratory,
the forensic chemist should put his own mark on the plastic
container and seal it again with a new seal.
8. The forensic chemist should turn-over and submit the marked
illegal drug to the court.

was delivered to the PNP Crime Laboratory after more than eight
hours from initial custody of the apprehending officers was not even
explained.
The police officers-members of the buy-bust team cannot bank
on the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duties.
The presumption has been destroyed upon their unjustified failure
to conform to the procedural requirements mentioned above. (People
u. Santos, Jr., G.R. No. 175593, October 17, 2007, 536 SCRA 489)
2. No marking in the presence of accused or counsel -PO2
Atienza himself testified that he confiscated the prohibited drug and
brought it to his office. He then prepared the request and only then— in
the office— did he place his initials “APA” on the plastic sachet. The
prosecution also failed to establish that petitioner was present when
PO2 Atienza marked the said plastic sachet. These shortcomings militate
against the prosecution’s case. In the similar case of Ronald Carino and
Rosana Andes v. People, G.R. No. 178757, March 13, 2009, th[e] Court
emphasized the requirement of law that the prohibited drug seized be
marked in the presence of the accused. Such flaw not only casts doubt
on the identity of the corpus delicti but also tends to negate, if not totally
discredit, the claim of regularity in the conduct of official police operation.
(Lopez v. People, G.R. No. 184037, September 29, 2009)
3. No evidence of authorship of markings - While PO2
Isip testified that the seized sachets of shabu were marked in the
police station, no evidence was presented to show that the marking
was accomplished in the presence of appellant. Moreover, the author
of the markings on said items was never identified. None of the
police officers admitted placing the markings. There was therefore
a complete absence of evidence to prove authorship of the markings.
(People v. Gayoso, G.R. No. 206590, March 27, 2017)

Since the failure in this case to comply with the procedure in the
custody of seized drugs compromised the identity and integrity of the
items seized, which is the corpus delicti of each of the crimes charged
against Habana, his acquittal is in order. (People u. Habana, supra)
Noncompliance with Section 21 of the IRR of R.A. No. 9165.

Noncompliance with Section 21 of said law, particularly
the making of the inventory and the photographing of the drugs
confiscated and/or seized, will not render the drugs inadmissible in
evidence. (People v. Del Monte, 552 SCRA 627, 636 [2008]), citing
People v. Pringas, 531 SCRA 828, 842-843 [2007]) What is imperative
is “the preservation of the integrity and the evidential value of the
seized items as the same would be utilized in the determination of
the guilt or innocence of the accused.” (People v. Feliciano, et al., G.R.
No. 190179, October 20, 2010, citing People v. del Monte, supra)
The last paragraph of Section 21(a), Article II of the IRR of
R.A. No. 9165 provides a saving mechanism to ensure that not every
case of noncompliance will irretrievably prejudice the prosecution’s
case. To warrant application of this saving mechanism, however, the
prosecution must recognize and explain the lapse or lapses in the
prescribed procedures. The prosecution must likewise demonstrate
that the integrity and evidentiary value of the evidence seized have
been preserved. (People v. Denoman, G.R. No. 171732, August 14,
2009, citing People v. Sanchez, G.R. No. 175832, October 15, 2008)

Illustration:

4. No evidence on how seized items changed hands
The prosecution failed to show how the seized items changed hands,
from when the police officers seized them from Habana to the time
they were presented in court as evidence. PO1 Paras said that he
turned over the sachets of shabu to the investigator on duty. But
the prosecution did not adduce evidence on what the investigator
on duty did with the seized articles, how these got
to the laboratory
technician, and how they were kept before being adduced in evidence
at the trial.

While there was indeed no physical inventory conducted and
no photograph of the seized item was taken, the Court has already
ruled in several cases that the failure of the arresting officers to
strictly comply with the law is not fatal and will not render an
accused’s arrest illegal or the items seized/confiscated from him
inadmissible. “What is of utmost importance is the preservation
of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as
the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or
innocence of the accused.” (People v. Abedin, G.R. No. 179936, April
11, 2012, 669 SCRA 322, 337) After petitioner was arrested and
the suspected shabu was confiscated from him by PO1 Sta. Maria,
the latter immediately brought the item to the police station where
he marked the plastic sachet with petitioner’s initials “ATO," and

400

T

the revised penal code
Criminal Law

TITLE FIVE
Crimes Relative to Opium and Other Prohibited Drugs

turned it over to the investigator PO1 Garcia. The latter, together
with P01 Sta. Maria, then forwarded the said plastic sachet marked
with “ATO” and the letter request for laboratory examination to
the WPD Crime Laboratory. Forensic Chemist P/Insp. Macapagal
personally received the same from PO1 Garcia and after conducting
qualitative examination on the contents thereof, found the same to
be positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu. When the
prosecution presented as evidence in court the plastic sachet marked
with “ATO,” PO1Sta. Maria in no uncertain terms positively identified
it as the one he confiscated from petitioner. It is therefore beyond cavil
that the chain of custody of the seized item was shown to not have
been broken, and, hence, its integrity and evidentiary value properly
preserved. (Tionco v. People, G.R. No. 192284, March 11, 2015)

Failure to turn-over to laboratory within 24 hours from seizure.
When police officers do not turn over dangerous drugs to the
laboratory within 24 hours from seizure, they must identify its
custodian, and the latter must be called to testify. The custodian must
state the security measures in place to ensure that the integrity and
evidentiary value of the confiscated items were preserved. (People v.
Gamboa, G.R. No. 220333, November 14, 2016)

Noncompllance with three-witness rule, when justified:

Noncompliance with three-witness rule may be excused if
justified, such as:
1.

Their attendance was impossible because the place of arrest
was a remote area;

2.

Their safety during the inventory and photograph of the
seized drugs was threatened by an immediate retaliatory
action of the accused or any person/s acting for and in his/
her behalf;

3.

The elected official themselves were involved in the
punishable acts sought to be apprehended;

4.

Earnest efforts to secure the presence of a DOJ or media
representative and an elected public official within the

period required under Article 125 of the Revised Penal Code
proved futile through no fault of the arresting officers, who
face the threat of being charged with arbitrary detention;

or
5.

Time constraints and urgency of the anti-drug operations,
which often rely on tips of confidential assets, prevented the
law enforcers from obtaining the presence of the required
witnesses even before the offenders could escape. (People

Mandatory Policy regarding compliance with requirements of

Section 21(1) of R.A. No. 9165.
The Supreme Court En Banc expressly required apprehending
officers to state in their sworn statements their compliance with
the requirements of Section 21(1) of R.A. No 9165, or in case of
nonobservance of said prohibition, to state the justification therefor
and steps taken to preserve integrity and evidentiary value on seized
items. It held:

In order to weed out early on from the courts’ already
congested docket any orchestrated or poorly built up drugrelated cases, the following should henceforth be enforced
as a mandatory policy:
1. In the sworn statements/affidavits, the
apprehending/seizing officers must state their compliance
with the requirements of Section 21(1) of R.A. No. 9165, as
amended, and its IRR.
2. In case of nonobservance of the provision, the
apprehending/seizing officers must state the justification or
explanation therefor as well as the steps they have taken
in order to preserve the integrity and evidentiary value of
the seized/confiscated items.
3. If there is no justification or explanation
expressly declared in the sworn statements or affidavits,
the investigating fiscal must not immediately file the case
before the court. Instead, he or she must refer the case for
further preliminary investigation in order to determine
the (non) existence of probable cause.
4. If the investigating fiscal filed the case despite
such absence, the court may exercise its discretion to either
refuse to issue a commitment order (or warrant of arrest)
403

or dismiss the case outright for lack of probable cause in
accordance with Section 5, Rule 112, Rules of Court. (People

v. Romy Lim, ibid.)
Coordination with PDEA, not an indispensable requirement.
Coordination with the PDEA is not an indispensable requirement
before police authorities may carry out a buy-bust operation. While it
is true that Section 86 of [R.A. No.] 9165 requires the National Bureau
of Investigation, PNP and the Bureau of Customs to maintain “close
coordination with the PDEA on all drug related matters,” the provision
does not, by so saying, make PDEA’s participation a condition sine
qua non for every buy-bust operation. After all, a buy-bust is just a
form of an in flagrante arrest sanctioned by Section 5, Rule 113 of the

Rules of the Court, which police authorities may rightfully resort to
in apprehending violators of R.A. No. 9165 in support of the PDEA. A
buy-bust operation is not invalidated by mere non-coordination with
the PDEA. (People v. Roa, G.R. No. 186134, May 6, 2010)

cases has been declared unconstitutional in Estipona v. Lobrigo, G.R.
No. 226679, August 15, 2017. It was held that the power to promulgate
rules of pleading, practice, and procedure in all courts belongs
exclusively to the Supreme Court under Section 5(5), Article VIII of
the 1987 Constitution. Since plea bargaining is a rule of procedure,
then Congress has no authority to repeal, alter, or supplement such
procedural rule.
A.M. No. 18-03-16-SC (Adoption of the Plea Bargaining
Framework in Drugs Cases) sets forth the acceptable plea bargain
in drugs cases, as follows:

Acceptable Plea

quantity of shabu, opium, morphine, nalia (Sec. 12)
heroin, cocaine is less than 5 grams or

grams (Sec. 11, par. 3)
Possession of dangerous drugs where Possession of dangerous
quantity of shabu, opium, morphine, drugs (Sec. 11, par. 3)
heroin, cocaine is 5 grams or more but
not exceeding 10 grams or quantity
of marijuana is 300 grams or more

not allowed. Plea bargaining is also not allowed under Section 5
(Sale, Trading, etc. of Dangerous Drugs) involving all other kinds of
dangerous drugs, except shabu and marijuana.

the chance to obtain a prize. (U.S. v. Filart, et al., 30 Phil. 80)

To repress an evil that undermines the social, moral and
economic growth of the nation. (People v. Punto, 68 Phil. 481)

Elements of lottery:
(a) consideration;

Gambling is an act beyond the pale of good morals which, for
the welfare of the people, should be exterminated. It has the effect
of causing poverty, dishonesty, fraud and deceit. Many men have
neglected [their] business and mortgaged [their] integrity to follow
the fickle Goddess of the cards. Many women have wasted [their]
hours and squandered [their] substance at the gambling board while
some children were forgotten. /See U.S. v. Salaveria, 39 Phil. 102)
Must any and all games mentioned in P.D. No. 1602 be played for
money?

It was held that the playing of monte for money is not a necessary
element. (U.S. v. Rafael, 23 Phil. 184) It seems that when the law
names the games, punishing any person who take part therein, its
purpose is to prohibit absolutely those games.
“Any other game or scheme, whether upon chance or skill.”

The aforequoted portion of Section 1(a) of P.D. No. 1602, makes
a game or scheme punishable even if the winning depends upon skill,
when wagers consisting of money, articles or value or representative
of value are at stake or made."

426

(b)

chance; and

(c)

prize, or some advantage or inequality in amount or value which
is in the nature of a prize. (U.S. v. Filiart, et al., 30 Phil. 80)
Lottery embraces all schemes for distribution of prizes by chance.

(U.S. v. Baguio, 39 Phil. 962)

If the scheme is such that human reason, foresight, sagacity,
or design cannot enable one to know or determine the result until
the same has been accomplished, then it is lottery. (U.S. v. Filiart,
et al., 30 Phil. 80)
Guessing competition constitutes lottery.

The El Debate, a newspaper, published an announcement that
it was awarding prizes aggregating P18.000 to the winners in two
guessing contests: (1) for the nearest approximate guesses as to
the total number of votes that will be cast for any of the winning
candidates for Carnival Queen in the provinces or in Manila; and
(2) for the nearest approximate guesses as to the total number of

votes that the Queen-elect will receive for the Carnival queenship.
To enter the contest, one must subscribe to the El Debate newspaper.

427

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

Held: There was lottery. The argument that there was no
consideration for the reason that each subscriber to the El Debate
received the full value of his money by receiving the paper every day
for the period he subscribed, is tenable only as respect those persons
who would subscribe to the paper regardless of the inducement to win
prize. The position is fallacious, as to other persons who subscribed
merely to win a prize. (El Debate v. Topacio, 44 Phil. 280)
No lottery where there Is full value of money.

The accused advertised that 500 packages of cigarettes would
be sold at P0.30 a package its regular price. In one of the packages
was a coupon. The person fortunate enough to buy that package with
coupon would be entitled to a gold watch.

—

Held: Not a lottery. (U.S. v. Olsen, 36 Phil. 395)

—

Reason: The player obtains full value for his money; the winning
a mere incident.

Elements:
1.

The Olsen case and the El Debate case compared.
The Olsen case is a criminal case and deals directly with the
lottery as defined in the penal statute, while the El Debate case is a
civil case dealing exclusively with the construction and application
of the provision of Section 1954(a) of the old Administrative Code
regarding “absolutely non-mailable matter.”

2.
3.

That a gambling game was carried on in an inhabited or
uninhabited place or in any building, vessel or other means
of transportation.
That the place, building, vessel or other means of
transportation is owned or controlled by the offender.
That the offender permitted the carrying on of such game,
knowing that it is a gambling game.

In the R.P.C., the word “lottery" is associated with games which
are dependent wholly or chiefly upon chance. In the Postal Law,
“lottery” is classified as a scheme depending in whole or in part upon
luck or chance.

Maintainer or conductor in a gambling game or scheme.
The maintainer and conductor of a gambling game or scheme
are likewise punished.
“Maintainer" is the person who sets up and furnishes the means
with which to carry on the gambling game or scheme.
“Conductor" is the person who manages or carries on the
gambling game or scheme.

P.D. No. 519, which took effect on July 23, 1974, has outlawed
pinball and slot machines and other similar devices and nullified all
permits and/or licenses to operate the same. It provides:
Any provision ofexistinglaw to the contrary notwithstanding,

Proof that game took place or Is about to take place Is not necessary.
Proof of the existence of a game of jueteng that has taken place or

with such game of jueteng. The burden of the evidence is shifted to
the accused to show that his possession is lawful and that the jueteng
list is in no way connected with jueteng game that has taken place or
about to take place. (Encarnacion v. People, 73 Phil. 668)

But proof to the contrary is necessary when the jueteng lists pertain
to games played on other dates.

But where the jueteng, were found in the premises of the accused
during a raid by the police on August 5, 1947, and it appeared that
the jueteng lists pertained to the games played from May 1 to July
23, 1947, and in 1943 and 1944, the prosecution must prove that they
were used on the date of the raid or immediately prior to or after said
date. (People v. Tan Chin Hing, C.A., 16 O.G. 3733)

Chapter Two
OFFENSES AGAINST DECENCY AND
GOOD CUSTOMS
What are the offenses against decency and good customs?

They are:
1.

Grave scandal. (Art. 200)

2.

Immoral doctrines, obscene publications and exhibitions.

(Art. 201)

3.

Vagrancy and prostitution. (Art. 202)

Art. 200. Grave scandal. — The penalties of arresto mayor*
and public censure shall be imposed upon any person who
shall offend against decency or good customs by any highly
scandalous conduct not expressly falling within any other
article of this Code.

Elements:

Art. 200

“Shall offend against decency or good customs.”
The word “decency” means propriety of conduct; proper
observance of the requirements of modesty, good taste, etc.
The word “customs” means established usage, social conventions

carried on by tradition and enforced by social disapproval of any
violation thereof.

Grave scandal, defined.

Grave scandal “consists of acts which are offensive to decency
customs which, having been committed publicly, have given
good
and
rise to public scandal to persons who have accidentally witnessed
the same.”
The acts must be those that can cause public scandal among the
persons witnessing them.

The acts punishable by Article 200 are those which by their
publicity and character can cause public scandal among the person
witnessing them, besides being contrary to morals and good customs.
(People v. Dumlao, et al., CA., 38 O.G. 3715)
If the act or acts of the offender are punished under another article
of this Code, Article 200 is not applicable.
The highly scandalous conduct should not be “expressly falling
within any other article of this Code.”

Thus, if the scandalous conduct constitutes an act of lasciviousness

1.

That the offender performs an act or acts.

2.

That such act or acts be highly scandalous as offending against
decency or good customs.

3.

That the highly scandalous conduct is not expressly falling
within any other article of this Code.

4.

That the act or acts complained of be committed in a public place
or within the public knowledge or view. (U.S. v. Samaniego, 16
Phil. 663)

(Art. 336 or Art. 339), even if committed publicly, the offender should

not be prosecuted and punished under this article.
Where the accused scattered coconut remnants with human
excrements on the stairs, doors and floor of the balcony of the public
elementary school, it was held that the crime was other mischiefs
under Article 329, and not grave scandal under Article 200. (People
v. Dumlao, CA., 38 O.G. 3715)
The acts must be performed in a public place or within the public

knowledge or view.
'See Appendix “A," Table of Penalties, No. 1.

432

A married woman who habitually appeared in public places with
her paramour, frequented suspicious places, vacant houses, etc., did
433

Art 201

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

not violate this article, because the acts were not committed in public
places or within the public knowledge or view. (U.S. v. Samaniego,
16 Phil. 663)
The crime penalized by this article consists of acts which are
offensive to decency and good customs which, having been committed
publicly, have given rise to public scandals to persons who have
incidentally witnessed the same. Even if the article does not so
express, it is evident that as a condition precedent for the existence
of this crime, the offense against decency and good customs must
have been made public; if the offense does not have this element, it
is clear that it does not produce the grave scandal required by the
article. (Viada, 4th Ed., Vol. 3, p. 130, cited in the case of U.S. v.
Catajay, 6 Phil. 399)
When the acts were performed in a private house and seen by one
person, the crime was not committed.

Thus, when the act complained of was committed at night,
in a private house, and at a time when no one was present except
the accused, the mistress of the house, and one servant, these
circumstances do not constitute the degree of publicity which is an
essential element of the crime. (U.S. v. Catajay, supra)

Art. 201. Immoral doctrines, obscene publications and
exhibitions, and indecent shows.
The penalty of prision
mayor0 or a fine ranging from Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000)
to Two hundred thousand pesos (P200,000), or both such
imprisonment and fine, shall be imposed upon:

—

1. Those who shall publicly expound or proclaim
doctrines openly contrary to public morals;

2. a. The authors of obscene literature, published
with their knowledge in any form, the editors publishing such
literature; and the owners/operators of the establishment
selling the same;

b. Those who, in theaters, fairs, cinematographs,
or any other place, exhibit indecent or immoral plays, scenes,
'See Appendix “A" Table of Penalties, No. 11.
434

TITLE SIX

Art. 201

Crimea Against Public Morals

acts, or shows, it being understood that the obscene literature

or indecent or immoral plays, scenes, acts or shows, whether
live or in film, which are proscribed by virtue hereof, shall
include those which: (1) glorify criminals or condone crimes;
(2) serve no other purpose but to satisfy the market for
violence, lust or pornography; (3) offend any race, or religion;
(4) tend to abet traffic in and use of prohibited drugs; and
(5) are contrary to law, public order, morals, good customs,

established policies, lawful orders, decrees and edicts; and

3. Those who shall sell, give away, or exhibit films,
prints, engravings, sculptures, or literature which are
offensive to morals. (As amended by PJ). No. 969 and RA. No.
10951)

Publicity is essential.

This offense in any of the forms mentioned in the article is
committed only when there is publicity.
Publicly expounding or proclaiming “doctrines openly contrary to
public morals.”

The word “moral” implies conformity with the generally accepted
standards of goodness or rightness in conduct or character, sometimes,
specifically, to sexual conduct.
The author of obscene literature is liable only when it is published
with his knowledge.
Writing obscene literature is not punished, but the author is
liable if it is published with his knowledge. In every case, the editor
publishing it is liable.
The word “obscene” means something offensive to chastity,
decency or delicacy. (U.S. u. Kottinger, 45 Phil. 352)

The test of obscenity.

The test is whether the tendency of the matter charged as
obscene, is to deprave or corrupt those whose minds are open to
such immoral influences, and into whose hands such a publication
may fall and also whether or not such publication or act shocks the
436

Art. 201

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

ordinary and common sense of men as an indecency.“Indecency” is an
act against the good behavior and a just delicacy. (U.S. v. Kottineer

45 Phil. 352)

It may be conceded that nudity itself is not inherently indecent
or obscene. Mere nudity in painting and sculpture is not obscenity as
they may be considered pieces of art. But the artistic, the aesthetic
and the pulchritude in the nude body of a living woman may readily
be transformed into an indecent and obscene object, by posture and
movements of such body which produce perceptible and discernible
reaction in the public or audience witnessing the same.

The reaction of the public, therefore, during the performance
of the dance by the accused, who had nothing on except nylon
patches over her breasts and a too abbreviated pair of nylon panties
to interrupt her stark nakedness, should be made the gauge in the
determination whether her dancing or exhibition was indecent or
immoral. And when the spectators were howling and shouting in
Tagalog: "Sige muna, sige, nakakalibog,” because she was swaying
to and fro with the middle portion or her body, it was clear that her
dancing was indecent and erotic. (People v. Aparici, CA., 52 O.G. 249)
Mere nudity in pictures or paintings, not an obscenity.

Thus, displaying and offering for sale to the public, key chains
with eye-appenders which consist of pictures in colors of nude
women, was held to be not violative of this article, because persons
of unquestioned morality acquire pictures of nude women and exhibit
them freely in their house as works of art.
As regards such pictures, the proper test is whether the motive
of the picture, as indicated by it, is pure or impure', or whether it is
naturally calculated to excite impure imaginations. (People v. Serrano,
CA-G.R. No. 5566-R, November 24, 1950)

may serenely depict humanity in all its natural and structural
manifestations of beauty which may not be offensive to the
public mind because they are not coupled with evident intention to
demoralize and challenge the sensibilities of human nature. But when
it appears that such publication is designed to stir the imagination
and suggest a mental picture not to promote but rather to debase
such sensibilities, the publication has ceased to be decent.

—

Appellant, with all subtlety, has gone as far as arguing that
sexual indulgence is not in itself immoral. If he contemplates the
scene from the natural promptings and privileges of human nature
within the bounds of privacy and conventionalism he is right.
The moment, however, they cany their private rights and privileges
to public scrutiny, they expose themselves to the judgment of the
public conscience in which the law may intervene. (People v. Sarte
III, CA. 55 O.G. 7034)

Mere possession of obscene materials Is not punishable.
Mere possession of obscene materials, without intention to
sell, exhibit, or give them away, is not punishable under Article 201,
considering the purpose of the law is to prohibit the dissemination of
obscene materials to the public. The offense in any of the forms under
Article 201 is committed only when there is publicity. The law does
not require that a person be caught in the act of selling, giving away
or exhibiting obscene materials to be liable, for as long as the said
materials Eire offered for sale, displayed or exhibited to the public.
In the present case, [the Court] find[s] that petitioners are engaged
in selling and exhibiting obscene materials. (Fernando v. Court of
Appeals, G.R. No. 169751, December 6, 2006)
The words “give away” in paragraph 3 of Article 201 should read

“distribute.”

reminiscent of those displayed by the first inhabitants of Eden

What is punished by Article 201, paragraph 4 (par. 3, as
amended), is the distribution of indecent literature, etc., to many
people and not merely the isolated, casual or occasional act of giving
such kind of literature to a single recipient. The purpose of the
provision is the protection of public morals, that is, the morals of
society as a whole, and not merely the morals of a single individual.
Hence, giving indecent literature to one person only is not a violation
of Article 201, paragraph 4 (par. 3, as amended). (People v. Tempongko,
1 CA. Rep. 317)

Indecent photograph and literature published In newspaper.

In two issues of the tabloid “Weekly Tribune," there were
published a photograph of a man and woman appearing as in actual
sexual intercourse, accompanied by a descriptive article designed
evidently to emphasize the obscenity of said photograph.
It is true that photographs portraying naked primitive forms

Additional penalties.

Pictures with slight degree of obscenity, not used for art’s sake but
for commercial purposes, fall under this article.

Since the persons who went to see those pictures and paid
entrance fees for the privilege of doing so were usually not artists or
persons interested in art to satisfy and improve their artistic tastes,
but rather the people desirous of satisfying their morbid curiosity,
taste, and lust, and for love of excitement, including the youth who
because of their immaturity are not in a position to resist and shield
themselves from the ill and perverting effects of the pictures, the
display of such pictures for commercial purposes is a violation of
Article 201. If those pictures were shown in art exhibits and art
galleries for the cause of art to be viewed and appreciated by people
interested in art, there would be no offense committed. (People v. Go
Pin, 97 Phil. 418)

vagrancy shall be dismissed and all persons serving sentence for
vagrancy shall be immediately released upon the effectivity of RA.
No. 10158.
The vagrancy provision in Article 202 is anti-poor as it fails to
see that vagrants are victims of poverty and the lack of opportunities
for employment and access to decent standards of living and quality
of life. It has likewise been used to discriminate on the basis of gender

as women, particularly suspected prostitutes, are routinely arrested
under the law. It has also been used as a pretext for arbitrary arrest
and detention, leaving it open to abuse by law enforcement officials.
Decriminalizing vagrancy seeks to decongest the load of the justice
system, allow law enforcement officers to pay more attention to
graver offenses, improve the administration of justice, and give a
more humane countenance on our justice system, which prioritize
the rehabilitation of the offender and acknowledges the value of
every human life. (Journal No. 71 dated March 8, 2011, Senate of

Any person having no apparent means of subsistence, who has
the physical ability to work and who neglects to apply himself
or herself to some lawful calling;

2.

Any person found loitering about public or semi-public buildings
or places, or tramping or wandering about the country or the
streets without visible means of support;

3.

Any idle or dissolute person who lodges in houses of ill-fame;
ruffians or pimps and those who habitually associate with
prostitutes;

4.

Any person who, not being included in the provisions of other
articles of this Code, shall be found loitering in any inhabited
or uninhabited place belonging to another without any lawful
or justifiable purpose.

TITLE SIX
Crimes Against Public Morals

Prostitutes are women who habitually indulge in (1) sexual

intercourse or (2) lascivious conduct, for money or profit.
As the term “prostitutes’ is defined in this article, a woman is a
prostitute when (1) she habitually indulges in (a) sexual intercourse,
or (b) lascivious conduct, (2) for money or profit.
Hence, one sexual intercourse with a man for money or profit
does not make a woman a prostitute. And several intercourses with
different men do not make her a prostitute, if there is no evidence
that she indulged in sexual intercourse for money or profit.
Note also that sexual intercourse is not absolutely necessary,
as lascivious conduct is sufficient.

Article 202 not applicable to minors.

Persons below 18 years of age shall be exempt from prosecution
for the crimes of vagrancy and prostitution under Section 202 of the
R.P.C., of mendicancy under P.D. No. 1563, and sniffing of rugby
under P.D. No. 1619, such prosecution being inconsistent with the
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: Provided, That
said persons shall undergo appropriate counseling and treatment

PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS

—

Art. 203. Who are public officers. For the purpose of
applying the provisions of this and the preceding titles of this
book, any person who, by direct provision of the law, popular
election or appointment by competent authority, shall take
part in the performance of public functions in the Government
of the Philippine Islands, or shall perform in said Government
or in any of its branches public duties as an employee, agent,
or subordinate official, of any rank or class, shall be deemed
to be a public officer.

The term “public officers” embraces every public servant from the
highest to the lowest.

The definition is quite comprehensive, embracing as it does,
every public servant from the highest to the lowest. For the purposes
of the Penal Code, it obliterates the standard distinction in the law of
public officers between “officer” and “employee." (Maniego v. People,
88 Phil. 494)

Performing in said Government or in any of its branches
public duties as an employee, agent or subordinate official,
of any rank or class; and
(2)

That his authority to take part in the performance of public
functions or to perform public duties must be
a.

by direct provision of the law, or

b.

by popular election, or

c.

by appointment by competent authority.

(1)

That a government laborer is not a public officer may be inferred
from the rulings of the Supreme Court in the cases of Maniego u.
People and People v. Paloma, infra.
But temporary performance of public functions by a laborer makes
him a public officer.

While it is true that the appointment of the accused was that
of a laborer in the Bureau of Posts, nevertheless, his duties were
that of a sorter and filer of money orders. He was appointed by the
Acting Director as sorter and filer of money orders and the sorting
and filing of money orders is obviously a public function or duty.
(Maniego v. People, 88 Phil. 494; People v. Paloma, 40 O.G., Supp. 10,
2087)

A mere emergency helper of the Bureau of Treasury on a daily
wage basis, without any appointment as janitor or messenger, is
a public officer having been entrusted with the custody of official
document. (People u. Bulangao, 40 O.G. 2087; People v. Ireneo, C-A.,
53 O.G. 2827)

In order that a judge may be held liable for knowingly rendering

is uiyust in the sense that is contrary to law, or is not supported by the
evidence, and that the same was made with conscious and deliberate
intent to do an iiyustice. (Sta. Maria v. Ubay, 87 SCRA 179)

“Knowingly” means consciously, intelligently, willfully, or
intentionally. (Black’s Law Dictionary, Fifth Ed., 784)

There must be evidence that the judge knew that the judgment is
unjust

Source of unjust judgment.

The source of unjust judgment may be either (a) error or (b) illwill or revenge, or (c) bribery.
Bad faith is the ground of liability.

An uiyust judgment is one which is contrary to law or is not
supported by the evidence, or both. The source of an unjust judgment
may be error or ill-will. There is no liability at all for a mere error.
It is well settled that a judicial officer, when required to exercise his
judgment or discretion, is not liable criminally for any error which
he commits, provided he acts in good faith. Bad faith is therefore
the ground for liability. If in rendering judgment, the judge fully
knew that the same was unjust in the sense aforesaid, then he
acted maliciously and must have been actuated and prevailed upon
by hatred, envy, revenge, greed, or some other similar motive. As
interpreted by Spanish courts, the term “knowingly" means sure
knowledge, conscious and deliberate intention to do an injustice.
(Heirs of Yasin v. Felix, A.M. No. RTJ-94-1167, December 4, 1995)
There must be evidence that the judgment Is unjust — It cannot
be presumed.

Thus, the mere fact that the judge promised to the other party
that he would decide the case against the complainant does not
prove that the judgment is uiyust. It is possible that such judgment
is supported by the facts and the law.

448

Absence of any positive evidence on record that the respondent
judge rendered the judgment in question with conscious and deliberate
intent to do an injustice, the charge must fail. (Sta. Maria v. Ubay,
ibid.)

A justice of the peace, charged with knowingly rendering uiyust
judgment, was acquitted because it did not appear that the decision
he rendered was unjust and that it was known to him to be unjust.
(U.S. v. Gacutan, 28 Phil. 128)
Does not apply to members of a collegiate court

Respondents should know that the provisions of Article 204
as to “rendering knowingly unjust judgment” refer to an individual
judge who does so “in any case submitted to him for decision” and
even then, it is not the prosecutor who would pass judgment on the
“uryustness” of the decision rendered by him but the proper appellate
court with jurisdiction to review the same, either the Court of Appeals
and/or the Supreme Court. Respondents should likewise know that
said penal article has no application to the members of a collegiate
court such as th[e] Court or its Divisions who reach their conclusions
in consultation and accordingly render their collective judgment after
due deliberation. (In re: Wenceslao Laureta, G.R. No. 68635, March

What is a “manifestly unjust judgment?”

Interlocutory order, defined.

It is so manisfestly contrary to law, that even a person having
a meager knowledge of the law cannot doubt the injustice. (Albert)

An interlocutory order is an order which is issued by the court
between the commencement and the end of a suit or action and which
decides some point or matter, but which, however, is not a final
decision of the matter in issue. (Bouvier’s Law Dictionary)

Abuse of discretion or mere error of judgment, not punishable.

Although there may be abuse of discretion in issuing an order, it
does not necessarily follow that there is bad faith or that said abuse
of discretion signifies ignorance of the law on the part of a judge.
Abuse of discretion by a trial court does not necessarily mean ulterior
motive, arbitrary conduct or willful disregard of a litigant’s rights.
(Evangelista v. Hon. Baes, 61 SCRA 475)
Mere error of judgment cannot serve as basis for a charge of
knowingly rendering an unjust judgment, where there is no proof or
even allegation of bad faith, or ill motive, or improper consideration.
(Yaranon v. Judge Rubio, 66 SCRA 67)

The test in determining whether an order or judgment is
interlocutory or final is:“Does it leave something to be done in the trial
court with respect to the merits of the case? If it does, it is interlocutory;
if it does not, it is final." (Kapisanan ng mga Manggagawa sa Maynila

Art. 208

Crimes Committed By Public Officers

Elements of dereliction of duty in the prosecution of offenses.
1. That the offender is a public officer or officer of the law who has
a duty to cause the prosecution of, or to prosecute, offenses.
2. That there is dereliction of the duties of his office; that is,
knowing the commission of the crime, he does not cause the
prosecution of the criminal (People v. Rosales, G.R. No. 42648)
or knowing that a crime is about to be committed, he tolerates
its commission.

That the delay is malicious, that is, the delay is caused by the
judge with deliberate intent to inflict damage on either party
in the case.

That the offender acts with malice and deliberate intent to favor
the violator of the law.

Mere delay without malice is not a felony under this article.

3.

Mere delay without malice in holding trials or rendering
judgments does not necessarily bring the judge within the operation
of this law.

Who can be the offenders in Article 208?

The offender under Article 208 is either (a) a public officer, or
(b) an officer of the law.

Art. 208. Prosecution of offenses; negligence and tolerance.
The penalty of prision correctional in its minimum period*
and suspension* shall be imposed upon any public officers
or officer of the law, who, in dereliction of the duties of his
office, shall maliciously refrain from instituting prosecution
for the punishment of violators of the law, or shall tolerate
the commission of offenses.

The phrase“officer of the law” includes all those who, by reason
of the position held by them, are duty-bound to cause the prosecution
and punishment of the offenders. (Albert)
The term “public officer” extends to officers of the prosecution
department, whose duty is to institute criminal proceedings for
felonies upon being informed of their perpetration. (Albert)

Acts punishable:

There must be a duty on the part of the public officer to prosecute
or to move the prosecution of the offender.
Note that Article 208 uses the phrase “who, in dereliction of
the duties of his office." Hence, the public officer liable under Article
208 must have a duty to prosecute or to move the prosecution of the
violation of the law.

2.

By maliciously refraining from instituting prosecution against
violators of the law.
By maliciously tolerating the commission of offenses.

The title of the article uses the word “negligence" which should
not be understood merely as lack of foresight or skill. The word
“negligence” simply means “neglect of the duties of his office by
maliciously failing to move the prosecution and punishment of the
delinquent.” (U.S. v. Mendoza, 23 Phil. 194) Malice is an important
element in this article.
•See Appendix “A," Table of Penalties, No. 11.

Thus, the following have such duty:

Chief of police. (People v. Rosales, GJl. No. 42648)
2. Barrio lieutenant. (U.S. v. Mendoza, 23 Phil. 194)
A chief of police who, in breach of official duty, failed to prosecute
ajueteng collector, in that he failed to file the corresponding criminal
action against the latter who was caught possessingjueteng lists, was
held liable under Article 208. (People v. Mina, 65 Phil. 621)

Crimes Committed By Public Officers

Criminal Law

A barrio lieutenant (now barrio captain) who, in neglect of his
duty, fails to move the prosecution of, and punishment for, a crime of
arson, of which he is informed, would, in case the alleged crime was
afterwards duly proven, be guilty of prevarication. (U.S. v. Mendoza
23 Phil. 194)
"Shall maliciously refrain from instituting prosecution.”

Thus, a fiscal who, knowing that the evidence against the
accused is more than sufficient to secure his conviction in court, drops
the case, is liable and may be punishable under Article 208.

But the fiscal or the city attorney, as prosecuting officer, is under
no compulsion to file the corresponding information based upon a
complaint, where he is not convinced that the evidence gathered or
presented would warrant the filing of an action in court. Of course, the
power of the City Attorney or prosecuting fiscal in connection with the
filing and prosecution of criminal charges in court is not altogether
absolute; but the remedy is the filing with the proper authorities or
court of criminal or administrative charges if the alleged offended
parties believe that the former maliciously refrained from instituting
actions for the punishment of violators of the law. (Vda. de Bagatua,
et al. v. Revilla and Lombos, 104 Phil. 392)

A approached the Chief of Police of a town and asked him not to
raid his (A’s) gambling house for two days. Because A was his friend,
the Chief of Police even instructed his policemen not to raid that house
for two days. Gambling games were played in A’s house. In this case,
the Chief of Police is liable under Article 208.

"Maliciously" signifies deliberate evil Intent
The offender must act with malice,

Thus, the municipal president who held cockfights on the days
not authorized by law, to raise funds for the construction of a ward
in the provincial hospital, was not liable under Article 208 for the
word “maliciously’’ means that the action complained of must be the
result of a deliberate evil intent and does not cover a mere voluntary
act. The accused was convicted only of illegal cockfighting. (People v.

a.

b.

c.

That the offender be a public officer within the scope of Article
203.
That the offender accepts an offer or a promise or receives a gift
or present by himself or through another.
That such offer or promise be accepted, or gift or present received
by the public officer
(1). with a view to committing some crime; or

—

(2)

in consideration of the execution of an act which does not

to refrain from doing something which it is his official duty

to do.

d.

That the act which the offender agrees to perform or which he
executes be connected with the performance of his official duties.

First element. — The offender Is a public officer.

The definition of “public officers” in Article 203 is quite
comprehensive, embracing as it does, every public servant from the
highest to the lowest. For the purpose of the Penal Code, it obliterates
the standard distinction in the law of public officers between “officer"
and “employee."

For the purpose of punishing bribery, the temporary performance
of public functions is sufficient to constitute a person a public officer.
(Maniego v. People, 88 Phil. 494; People v. Paloma, 40 O.G., Supp.
10, 2087; People v. Bulangao, 40 O.G. 2087)
Applicable to “assessors, arbitrators, appraisal and claim
commissioners, experts.”

The provisions of Article 210 are made applicable to assessors,
arbitrators, appraisal and claim commissioners, experts or any other
persons performing public duties.
“Or any other persons performing public duties.”

Does this phrase cover a private individual who, in consideration
of a sum of money given to him, released a person under arrest and
458

TITLE SEVEN

Crimes Committed By Public Officers

Art. 210

entrusted to his custody? It is believed that it is not applicable, because

the additional penalty of special temporary disqualification for bribery
has no practical application to a private person.
But a private individual may be disqualified from holding the
office of assessor, arbitrator, appraisal and claim commissioner, or
handwriting expert.

Second element. — Gift Is received personally or through
Intermediary.

The gift or present may be received by the public officer himself
or through a third person.
Gift is either (1) voluntarily offered by a private person, or
(2) solicited by a public officer.
Bribery exists, not only (1) when the gift is offered voluntarily by
a private person, or (2) when the gift is solicited by a public officer and
the private person voluntarily delivers it to the public officer, but also
(3) when the gift is solicited by a public officer, as the consideration
for his refraining from the performance of an official duty and the
private person gives the gift for fear of the consequences which would
result if the officer performs his functions. (December of November 3,
1879, Supreme Court of Spain, cited in People v. Sope, 75 Phil. 810)

Gift or present need not be actually received by the public officer,
as an accepted offer or promise of gift is sufficient.

In the first paragraph of Article 210, the law uses the phrase
“in consideration of any offer, promise,” etc. Hence, a promise of gift
to a public officer who accepts such promise is sufficient.

But in the second paragraph of Article 210, the law uses the
phrase “the gift was accepted by the officer.”
The words “offer” and "promise” are not used in the second
paragraph.

The offer of gift or promise must be accepted by the public officer.

In case there is only an offer of gift or a promise to give something,
the offer or the promise must be accepted by the public officer.
459

Art. 210

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

If the offer is not accepted by the public officer, only the person
offering the gift or present is criminally liable for attempted corruption
of public officer under Article 212 in relation to Article 6. The public
officer is not liable.
The gift or present must have a value or be capable of pecuniary
estimation.

The thing offered or accepted may be money, property, services
or anything else of value. It must be of some value, but any value is
sufficient.

An agreement to reinstate a friend of a mayor who was dismissed,
provided the mayor would execute a certain act in connection with his
official duty, was held to be a bribe. (People ex rel Dickinson v. Van
De Carr, 87 App. Div. 386, 84 N.Y.S. 41, 18 N.Y. Cr. 31)
But under the Revised Penal Code, the fine which is one of the
penalties imposed for the commission of direct bribery is based on the
value of the gift. The reinstatement of the friend of the mayor seems
to be not capable of pecuniary estimation.
Third element. — The three ways of committing direct bribery.
The act to be performed by the public officer must constitute a
crime in the first form of direct bribery.

Viada, Volume 2, page 642, says that to constitute the crime of
bribery (of the first form) as provided in this article, four things are
necessary:
(1)

That the defendant be a public officer according to the
meaning of this term in Article 401 (Art. 203);
(2) That he has received either personally or through another
gifts or presents or accepted offers or promises;
(3) That such reception of gifts or presents or acceptance of
offers or promises has been for the purpose of executing a
crime; and
(4)

That the act constituting the crime relates to the exercise
of the office which the public officer discharges.
All these must concur. (U.S. v. Gimenea, 24 Phil. 470)

460

TITLE SEVEN
Crimes Committed By Public Officers

Art. 210

A promise to give gift to, and a promise to commit an unlawful act
by, a public officer will be sufficient in direct bribery under the first
paragraph of Article 210.

It is sufficient that a promise or offer was made to the public
officer to give him money if he would commit an unlawful act in
connection with the performance of his official duties and that he
agreed to commit the unlawful act in consideration of the promise
or offer.
Example:

The stenographer ofthe court accepted a promise of P100.00 from
an individual and promised to alter the notes taken by him during the
trial of a case. The act which the stenographer promised to do would
constitute the crime of falsification under Article 171 of the Code.
It is not necessary that the evidence shows an express promise.
It is sufficient if from all the circumstances in the case, such promise
can be implied. (U.S. v. Richard, 6 Phil. 545)
The public officer to suffer "the penalty corresponding to the crime
agreed upon, if the same shall have been committed."
Thus, if the stenographer of the court who had accepted a promise
of P100.00 from an individual altered the notes in accordance with the
agreement, he shall suffer, in addition to the penalty corresponding
to the crime of bribery, the penalty for the crime of falsification by a
public officer or employee under Article 171 of the Code.

The act which the public officer agrees to perform must be
connected with the performance of official duties.
The act which the public officer agreed to perform must be an act
in discharge of his legal duty. For example, a municipal president who
ordered the release of a prisoner upon receiving from the latter the
sum of P20.00, instead of obeying the orders of the provincial governor
requiring him to send the prisoner to the provincial capital, is guilty of
direct bribery, because, “having the prisoner under his charge, it was
part of his official duty to obey the orders of the provincial governor
in this respect.” (U.S. v. Valdehueza, 4 Phil. 470)
The act need not, however, be statutory duty; it is sufficient
if the action to be affected by the bribe be part of the established
461

Art, 210

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

procedure of a governmental agency. (Cohen v. United States, 144 p
[2d] 984, 323 U.S. 797, 89 L. Ed. 636, 65 S. Ct. 440; 342 U.S. 885,
89
L. Ed. 1435 S. Ct. 586)

It is not bribery if the act is in discharge of a mere moral duty.

("See Dishon v. Smith, 10 Iowa 212, 221)

The fact that the act agreed to be performed by the public officer
is in excess of his power, jurisdiction, or authority is no defense.
(Glover u. State, 109 Ind. 391, 10N.E. 282) But if the act agreed to
be
performed is so foreign to the duties of the office as to lack even color
of authority, there is no bribery. (Gunning v. People, 189 III. 165, 59
N£. 494, 82 Am. St. Bep. 443)

Direct bribery under the second paragraph of Article 210 has the
same elements as those of direct bribery under the first paragraph,
but the act intended by the public officer does not amount to a crime.
In the crime of direct bribery defined in the second paragraph,
there appear the same elements as those of the offense defined in the
first paragraph, with the sole exception that the act intended by the
officer, although unjust, does not amount to crime.
Examples of second form of direct bribery.

1.

Petitioner was a police sergeant. He directly received the bribe
money in exchange for the recovery of stolen cylinder tanks,
which was an act not constituting a crime within the meaning
of Article 210 of the Revised Penal Code. (Marifosque v. People,
G.R. No. 156685, July 27, 2004)
2. A BLR examiner who demanded and extorted a sum of money in
consideration and in exchange for the release of the Certification
Authorizing Registration (CAR) for the land purchased by
private complainant is guilty of direct bribery. (Merencillo v.
People, G.R. Nos. 142369-70, April 13, 2007)
3. The treasurer who, in consideration of money or present, awards
certain stalls in the public market to a Chinaman, in spite of the
fact that there are Filipinos who have better rights. This act of
the treasurer is not a crime but it is unjust.
4. In the case of U.S. v. Gacutan, 28 Phil. 100, the bribery
committed by the justice of the peace falls under this form of
bribery, because when he decided the case in favor of the party
462

TITLE SEVEN

Art. 210

Crimes Committed By Public Officers

who gave him a female carabao worth P80.00, without regard to
the evidence, he executed an act which is not criminal, for there
was no evidence that the decision was unjust and that he knew
it to be unjust. The act he executed was unjust, for it certainly
was an act of ipjustice to convict a person charged with a crime
without regard to what the evidence in the case may be.

Act does not amount to a crime, and is connected with the
performance of his official duty.
Thus, direct bribery is committed when a police officer directly
received the bribe money in exchange for the recovery of stolen
cylinder tanks, which was an act not constituting a crime, and his
act of receiving money was connected with his duty as a police officer.
(Marifosque u. People, GJi. No. 156685, July 27, 2004)
In direct bribery under the second paragraph, is the mere promise
to give a gift and a mere promise to execute an act not constituting
a crime sufficient?
Under the second paragraph of Article 210, if the gift was
accepted by the public officer in consideration of the execution of an act
which does not constitute a crime, there are two penalties provided:
(1) prision correctional in its minimum and medium periods
and a fine of note less than the value of the gift and not
more than three times such value if the offender executed

—

said act;
(2) arresto mayor in its maximum period and a fine of not less
than the value of the gift and not more than twice such
value if said act shall not have been accomplished.
The word “accomplish’’ presupposes an overt act, an outward act
done in pursuance and in manifestation of an intent or design, brought
to completeness. The act is not accomplished when the overt act is not
brought to completeness. Hence, a mere agreement or promise on the
part of the public officer to execute an act not constituting a crime is
not a violation of the provision in the second paragraph of Article 210.
Likewise, a mere promise to give a gift is not sufficient. The
of the
second paragraph of Article 210 was taken from Article 382
agree

with the exercise of the powers of his office in consideration of an offer
or promise or of any gift or present.” The elimination of the phrase
‘shall agree” and the words “of any offer or promise” in the second
paragraph of Article 210 is not devoid of significance.

If the information does not allege whether the public officer
executed the act or not, the case would fall under paragraph 2 of
Article 210 which distinguishes between the act which was executed
and that which was not accomplished. (People v. Abesamis, 93 Phil

712)

Direct bribery under the third paragraph of Article 210.

In this kind of direct bribery, the object for which the gifts is
received or promised is to make the public officer refrain from doing
something which it is his official duty to do.
Example of the third form of direct bribery.
1.

2.

3.

LTO employees who demanded and received protection money
from a taxi operator so that they would not apprehend his
drivers and impound his vehicles for violations of LTO rules are
guilty of direct bribery under the third paragraph of Article 210.
(Balderama v. People, G.R. Nos. 147578-85, January 28, 2008)
A sanitary inspector who accepts a gift from the tenant of an
unsanitary building and in consideration thereof refrains from
performing his duty to report its condition to his superiors, is
guilty under the third paragraph of Article 210. (U.S. v. Navarro,
3 Phil. 633)
The public officer who, instead of reporting on the derogatory
information he has gathered against a suspect whom he had been
spying on for communistic leanings, agrees to refrain from doing
his official duty in consideration of a sum of money, is liable for
bribery under paragraph 3, Article 210, of the Revised Penal
Code. (People v. Marco, 12 CA. Rep. 377)

First form of direct bribery is committed if by refraining from doing
an act the public officer commits a crime.

It must be noted that if the act of refraining from doing
something, which is the official duty of the officer, constitutes a crime
in itself, the bribery should not be punished under this paragraph
but under paragraph 1 of Article 210.
464

TITLE SEVEN

Art. 210

Crimes Committed By Public Officers

Such would happen if a public officer, in violation of the duties
of his office, would, for a gift or promise, abstain from instituting
an action for the punishment of an offense. Note that the refraining
constitutes the crime of prevarication (Art. 208) and should, therefore,
be punished not under the third paragraph but under the first
paragraph of Article 210. (Albert)

Prevarication distinguished from bribery.
The third form of direct bribery (Art. 210) is committed by

refraining from doing something which pertains to the official duty
of the officer. Prevarication (Art. 208) is committed in the same way.

In this regard, the two felonies are similar.
But they differ in that in bribery, the offender refrained from
doing his official duty in consideration of a gift received or promised.
This element is not necessary in the crime of prevarication.
In bribery, the gift or present must be given to the public officer to
corrupt him.
B, a cabeza de barangay and barrio lieutenant, accepted cocks,
hens, bamboo, and other articles under promise to relieve the persons
from whom he had obtained them of the obligation to perform certain

duties.
Held: This is not bribery, but estafa (by means of deceit), because
the things were given to him by the taxpayers not to corrupt him and
to induce him to omit the performance of his duty, but were demanded
by him. (U.S. v. Jader, 1 Phil. 297)
Note: It is estafa, because by promising the people that they
would be relieved of the obligation to perform certain duties, the
accused pretended to possess authority to do so.

Direct Bribery is a crime involving moral turpitude.
Moral turpitude can be inferred from the third element. The fact
that the offender agrees to accept a promise or gift and deliberately
commits an unjust act or refrains from performing an official duty in
exchange for some favors, denotes a malicious intent on the part
the offender to renege on the duties which he owes his fellowmen and
society in general. Also, the fact that the offender takes advantage
465

Art. 211

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

TITLE SEVEN

Criminal Law

his office and position is a betrayal of the trust reposed on him by the
public. It is a conduct clearly contrary to the accepted rules of right
and duty, justice, honesty and good morals. In all respects, direct
bribery is a crime involving moral turpitude. (Magno v. Commission
on Elections, et al., G.R. No. 147904, October 4, 2002)

Art. 211. Indirect bribery.
The penalties of prision

suspension and public censure shall be imposed upon any
public officer who shall accept gifts offered to him by reason of
his office. (As amended by BJ*. Big. 871, approved May 29, 1985)

Elements:
1.

2.

3.

That the offender is a public officer.
That he accepts gifts.
That the said gifts are offered to him by reason of his office.

Gift is usually given to the public officer in anticipation of future
favor from the public officer.

A public officer should not accept any gift offered to him, because
such gift is offered in anticipation of future favor from him. Such gift
received now will in the future corrupt him or make him omit the
performance of his official duty.
Example of indirect bribery.

“Who shall accept gifts offered to him.”
Will there be indirect bribery, if a public officer accepts a promise
of gifts made to him by reason of his office?
Article 211 does not use the word “promise,” but the phrase
“shall accept gifts.”

The essential ingredient of direct bribery as defined on Article
211 of the Revised Penal Code is that the public officer concerned must
have accepted the gift or material consideration. There must be a clear
intention on the part of the public officer to take the gift so offered and
consider the same as his own property from then on, such as putting
away the gift for safekeeping or pocketing the same. Mere physical
receipt unaccompanied by any other sign, circumstance or act to show
such acceptance is not sufficient to lead the court to conclude that the
crime of indirect bribery has been committed. To hold otherwise will
encourage unscrupulous individuals to frame up public officers by
simply putting within their physical custody some gift, money or other
property. (Formilleza v. Sandiganbayan, 159 SCRA 1)
There is no attempted or frustrated Indirect bribery.
Indirect bribery has no attempted or frustrated stage of
execution, because it is committed by accepting gifts offered to the
public officer by reason of his office. If he does not accept the gifts; he
does not commit the crime. If he accepts the gifts, it is consummated.
Direct bribery distinguished from indirect bribery.
1. In both crimes, the public officer receives gift.

2.

A veterinarian of the Board of Health, entrusted with the duty
of examining mules which were offered for sale to the Government,
received a certain amount of money from the vendor of mules after
the latter had received from the Government the purchase price of
the mules sold. There was no evidence to the effect that the money
was given for the purpose of preventing the veterinarian from doing
or inducing him to do something pertaining to his officer. (U.S. v.
Richards, 6 Phil. 545) He accepted the gift offered to him by reason
of his office.

3.

While in direct bribery there is an agreement between the public
officer and the giver of the gift or present, in indirect bribery,
usually, no such agreement exists.
In direct bribery, the offender agrees to perform or performs
an act or refrains from doing something, because of the gift or
promise; in indirect bribery, it is not necessary that the officer
should do any particular act or even promise to do an act, as it
is enough that he accepts gifts offered to him by reason of his
office, (cited in Pozar v. Court of Appeals, 132 SCRA 729)

Considered indirect bribery, even if there was a sort of an agreement
between public officer and giver of gift.

P was an employee of the Manila Health Department assigned
to prepare and follow up vouchers of the employees who were laid off
Knowing that B was to be laid off, P offered B to prepare his voucher
for accumulated and terminal leave pay, on condition that the latter
would give the former P50, to which B agreed. When B received his
pay, he gave P the sum of P50.00.
Held: P was without any right whatsoever to receive P50.00 for
his services, because he was an employee of the government assigned
to do the work he performed for B. (People u. Pamplona, CA., 51 O.G.
4116) The accused was found guilty of indirect bribery.
Distinguish Indirect bribery from direct bribery under the second
paragraph of Article 210.

The case of People v. Pamplona, C.A., 51 O.G. 4116, might be
mistaken for a case of direct bribery under the second paragraph
of Article 210, because there was an agreement between the public
officer and the giver of the gift and that the act which the public officer
executed did not constitute a crime. But in direct bribery under the
second paragraph of Article 210, the act executed must be unjust. In
the Pamplona case, the act executed by the accused (preparing the
voucher) was not unjust.
Receiving of gifts by public officials and employees, and giving of
gifts by private persons, on any occasion, Including Christmas Is
punishable.

The President of the Philippines has made it punishable for
any public official or employee, whether of the national or local
governments, to receive, directly or indirectly, and for private persons
to give, or offer to give, any gift, present or other valuable thing on
any occasion, including Christmas, when such gift, present or other
valuable thing is given by reason of his official position, regardless
of whether or not the same is for past favor or favors or the giver
hopes or expects to receive a favor or better treatment in the future
from the public official or employee concerned in the discharge of his
official functions. Included within the prohibition is the throwing of
parties or entertainments in honor of the official or employee or of

For violation of this Decree, the penalty of imprisonment
for not less than one year nor more than five years and perpetual
disqualification from public office shall be imposed. The official or

Criminal penalty of imprisonment is distinct from the administrative
penalty of separation from the judicial service.
The Court is constrained to disapprove the recommendation as
to the first charge of indirect bribery which is fully supported by the
evidence that respondent Judge “be suspended from office for 2 years
and 4 months, taking into consideration the penalty prescribed in
the Revised Penal Code.” The penalty of two years and four months
imprisonment provided for the criminal offense of indirect bribery
may not be equated with the penalty of separation from the judicial
service which is the proper applicable administrative penalty by virtue
of respondent Judge’s serious misconduct prejudicial to the judiciary
and the public interest. (Cabrera u. Pajares, 142 SCRA 127)

Art. 212

That the offender makes offers or promises or gives gifts or
presents to a public officer.
That the offers or promises are made or the gifts or presents
given to a public officer, under circumstances that will make the
public officer liable for direct bribery or indirect bribery.

The offender in corruption of public officer is the giver of gift or

offeror of promise.
The offender is the giver of gifts or offeror of promise.
The public officer sought to be bribed is not criminally liable,
unless he accepts the gift or consents to the offer of the offender.
Article 212 punishes the person who made the offer or promise
or gave the gift, even if the gift was demanded by the public officer
and the offer was not made voluntarily prior to the said demand by
the public officer.

In view of the fact that it is hard to prove bribery, for the briber

himself is punished by law and he is usually the only one who could
give direct evidence, ways and means are resorted to, to catch the
public officer while he is in the act of obtaining bribes. This is known
as entrapment.
Thus, an NBI agent who, posing as one interested in expediting
the approval of license for firearm, gave P50.00 to the public officer
who had hinted that he was not averse to receiving some money for
expediting the approval of licenses, merely resorted to ways and
means to catch the public officer, it appearing that there was a ground
of suspicion or belief of the existence of official graft in that office.

Preliminary investigation by a fiscal is not a contract or transaction.

A preliminary investigation of a criminal complaint conducted
by a fiscal is not a “contract or transaction” so as to bring it within the
ambit of Section 3(b) of R.A. No. 3019. A transaction, like a contract,
is one which involves some consideration as in credit transactions and
the element of consideration is absent in a preliminary investigation
of a case. (Soriano v. Sandiganbayan, 131 SCRA 184)

Direct bribery under Art. 210 and Sec. 3(b) of R.A. No. 3019,
distinguished.
1. In Sec, 3(b), the mere request or demand of a gift, present,
share, percentage or benefit is sufficient. In Direct Bribery,
acceptance of a promise or offer or receipt of a gift or present
is required.

The ambit of Section 3(b) of R.A. No. 3019 is specific and is
limited only to contracts or transactions involving monetary
consideration where the public officer has the authority to
intervene under the law. Direct bribery has a wider and
more general scope: (a) performance of an act constituting
a crime; (b) execution of an unjust act which does not
constitute a crime and (c) agreeing to refrain or refraining
from doing an act which is his official duty to do. (People
v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 188165, December 11, 2013)
Direct bribery is malum in se while Sec. 3(b) of R.A. No.
3019 is malum prohibita.

(c) Directly or indirectly requesting or receiving any gift,
present or other pecuniary or material benefit, for himself or for
another, from any person for whom the public officer, in any manner
or capacity, has secured or obtained, or will secure or obtain, any
Government permit or license, in consideration for the help given
or to be given, without prejudice to Section thirteen of this Act.

The person liable under this provision is the public officer who,
in any manner or capacity, has secured or obtained, or will secure or
obtain, any Government permit or license for another person.
The act constituting the crime is directly or indirectly requesting
or receiving any gift, present or other pecuniary or material benefit, for
himself or for another in consideration for the help given or to be given.

Elements:
(1)

The accused is a public officer;

(2)

That in any manner or capacity he secured or obtained, or would
secure or obtain, for a person any government permit or license;

(3)

That he directly or indirectly requested or received from said
person any gift, present or other pecuniary or material benefit

Illustration:
Tecson was the Municipal Mayor of Prosperidad, Agusan del
Sur. In his official capacity, he signed and issued a Mayor’s Permit to
Mrs. Luzana for their investment business in which he does not appear
to have made any contribution to the capital. Before he released the
Mayor’s Permit to Mrs. Luzana, he requested and received the amount
of P4.000 to be used by him in a fiesta. He requested and received
the amount of P4.000 as cash advance in consideration of the help he
gave viz., issuance of Mayor’s Permit which he would not deliver
to Mrs. Luzana unless she acceded to his request. He is liable under
Art. 3(c) of R.A. No. 3019. (Tecson v. Sandiganbayan, ibid.)

—

Sec. 3(b) and Sec. 3(c), distinguished.

In both sections, there is a request or receipt of a gift, present, or
benefit. However, in Sec. 3(b), the gift, present, or benefit is requested
or received in connection with any contract or transaction with the
Government wherein the public officer in his official capacity has to
intervene under the law, while in Sec. 3(c), the gift, present, or benefit
is requested or received in consideration for the help given or to be
given in securing or obtaining a Government permit or license.
Receiving any gift.

“Receiving any gift” includes the act of accepting directly or
indirectly a gift from a person other than a member of the public
officer’s immediate family, in behalf of himself or of any member
of his family or relative within the fourth civil degree, either by
consanguinity or affinity, even on the occasion of a family celebration
or national festivity like Christmas, if the value of the gift is under
the circumstances manifestly excessive. (Sec. 2[c], R.A. No. 3019)

Unsolicited gifts.
Unsolicited gifts or presents of small or insignificant value
offered or given as a mere ordinary token of gratitude or friendship
according to local customs or usage, shall be excepted from the
provisions of this Act. (Sec. 14, R.A. No. 3019)
The value of the gift is not an element of the offense.
Section 3(c) applies regardless of whether the gift’s value is
manifestly excessive or not, and regardless of the occasion. What is
477

Art. 212

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

important here is whether the gift is received in consideration for help
given or to be given by the public officer. The value of the gift is not
mentioned at all as an essential element of the offense charged under

Section 3(c). (Mendoza-Ong v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. Nos. 46368-69,
October 23, 2003)
(d) Accepting or having any member of his family accept
employment in a private enterprise which has pending official
business with him during the pendency thereof or within one year
after his termination.

The person liable under this provision is a public officer who had
or has pending official business with a private enterprise.
The act constituting the crime is accepting or having any member
of his (public officer’s) family accept employment in that private
enterprise (1) during the pendency of the official business with him
or (2) within one year after its termination.
It will be noted that the prohibition refers to employment in
a private enterprise. Hence, if the public officer or a member of his
family accepted employment in a Government department or agency,
like a public corporation, the prohibition does not apply, even if such
department or agency had or has pending official business with him.
Family.

Family shall include the spouse or relatives by consanguinity or
affinity in the third civil degree. Thus, a brother-in-law falls within the
definition of family under Section 3(d) thereof. (Sec. 4, R.A. No. 3019)

Illustration:
Petitioner, a Bureau of Customs official, did not deny that CCSI,
a cargo brokerage company, has regular transactions with his office.
Neither did he deny that Manongdo is his brother-in-law. Under
Section 3(d) of R.A. No. 3019, mere acceptance by a member of his
family of employment with a private enterprise which has pending
official business with the official involved is considered a corrupt
practice. Therefore, it is clear that mere acceptance by Manongdo, a
family member, of the employment with CCSI, rendered petitioner
liable under the law. (Valera v. Office of the Ombudsman, G.R.

Elements:

The offender must be a public officer discharging administrative,

(b) He must have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith

was caused to the Government because said truck could have
been purchased at a much lower price.

Resolution Nos. 95-244 and 95-244-A, if the following two
requisites are present: (1) public biddings have failed for at
least two consecutive times; and (2) no suppliers have qualified
to participate or win in the biddings.
The Sandiganbayan correctly ruled that by procuring the
subject truck through a negotiated purchase without public
bidding, petitioner failed to comply with the above stated
procedure. Indeed, as the local chief executive, petitioner is not
only expected to know the proper procedure in the procurement
of supplies, she is also duty bound to follow the same and her
failure to discharge this duty constitutes gross and inexcusable
negligence. (Ong v. People, G.R. No. 176546, September 25, 2009)
(2) Respondents, who were all public officers at the time of
the alleged commission of the crime - particularly, as provincial
officials of Bataan discharging administrative functions (first
element) - apparently acted with manifest partiality, evident
bad faith - or, at the very least, gross inexcusable negligence
when they issued the pertinent documents and certifications
that led to the diversion of public funds to a project that had
no proper allotment, i.e., the mini-theater project (second
element). Considering that the illegal diversion of public funds
for the mini-theater project would undermine the execution of
other projects legitimately supported by proper allotments, it is
quite obvious that undue injury on the part of the Province and
its residents would be caused. Likewise, considering that V.F.
Construction had already received full payment for a project
that had yet to be completed, it also appears that a private
party was given unwarranted benefits by respondents in the
discharge of their functions (third element). (Garcia v. Office of

Arias doctrine.

All heads of offices have to rely to a reasonable extent on their
subordinates and on the good faith of those who prepare bids, purchase
supplies, or enter into negotiations.
Arias v. Sandiganbayan
(GJl. No. 81563, December 19, 1989)

Facts: Six persons, including Arias, were convicted by the Sandiganbayan
in connection with the overpricing of land purchased by the Bureau of Public
Works for the Mangahan Floodway Project for “causing undue injury to
the Government and giving a private party unwarranted benefits through
manifest partiality, evident bad faith, or inexcusable negligence.” The deed of
sale was pre-audited by Arias, auditor of the Rizal Engineering District, who
approved the payment of Pl,520, 320 without questioning the fact that the
amount of the purchase price therein had been altered and without checking
the veracity of the supporting documents.

There are two ways by which a public official violates Section 3(e) of
R-A. No. 3019 in the performance of his functions, namely: (1) by causing
undue injury to any party, including the Government; or (2) by giving
any private party any unwarranted benefit, advantage or preference.
(Velasco v. Sandiganbayan, 492 Phil. 669, 677 [2005]) The accused may
be charged under either mode or under both. The disjunctive term “or^
connotes that either act qualifies as a violation of Section 3(e) of R-A.

Held: There appears to be no question from the records that documents
used in the negotiated sale were falsified. We can, in retrospect, argue that
Anas should have probed records, inspected documents, received procedures,
and questioned persons. It is doubtful if any auditor for a fairly sized office
could personally do all these things in all vouchers presented for his signature.
The Court would be asking for the impossible. All heads of offices have to
rely to a reasonable extent ‘on their subordinates and on the good
faith of those who prepare bids, purchase supplies, or enter into
negotiations.’ If a department secretary entertains important visitors, the
auditor is not ordinarily expected to call the restaurant about the amount of
the bill, question each guest whether he was present at the luncheon, inquire
whether the correct amount of food was served and otherwise personally look
into the reimbursement voucher’s accuracy, propriety, and sufficiency. There

Arias doctrine, applied.

The BFAR entered into an agreement with a contractor for
the purchase and installation of three distribution transformers
and construction of a circular steel elevated tank. Based on an
Accomplishment Report and Certification submitted by BFAR
Engineer Enriquez, newly designated BFAR Regional Director
Magsuci signed a disbursement voucher with the usual certification
on the lawful incurrence of the expenses to be paid, and co-signed
four checks payable to the contractor. However, it turned out that
the contractor had not yet accomplished the work stated in the
Accomplishment Report and Certification. The Court held that the
actions taken by Magsuci involved the very functions he had to
discharge in the performance of his official duties. There has been
no intimation at all that he had foreknowledge of any irregularity
committed by either or both Enriquez and the contractor. Magusci
might have indeed been lax and administratively remiss in placing
too much reliance on the official reports submitted by his subordinate
(Engineer Enriquez), but for conspiracy to exist, it is essential that
there must be a conscious design to commit an offense. Conspiracy is
not the product of negligence but of intentionally (sic) on the part of
cohorts. (Magsuci v. Sandiganbayan, No. L-101545, January 3, 1995)

The Arias doctrine cannot be applied where circumstances exist
which should prompt a higher degree of circumspection.
1. Petitioners were found guilty of violating Sec. 3(e) of
R.A. No. 3019 for purported “ghost” purchases of combat, clothing,
and individual equipment (CCIE) which were allegedly purchased
from the PNP Service Store System (SSS) and delivered to the PNP
General Services Command (GSC). It was held that Arias cannot be
applied to exculpate petitioners in view of the peculiar circumstances
in the case which should have prompted them to exercise a higher
degree of circumspection, and consequently, go beyond what their
subordinates had prepared. In particular, the tampered dates on some
of the Requisition and Invoice Vouchers, the incomplete certification
482

Art. 212

on the Reports of Public Property Purchased and the fact that sixteen
checks all dated January 15, 1992 were payable to PNP SSS should
have aroused a reasonable sense of suspicion or curiosity on their
part if only to determine that they were not approving a fraudulent
transaction. (Lihaylihay v. People, G.R. No. 191219, July 31, 2013)
2. Unlike in Arias, however, there exists in the present case
an exceptional circumstance which should have prodded petitioner,
if he were out to protect the interest of the municipality he swore to
serve, to be curious and go beyond what his subordinates prepared
or recommended. In fine, the added reason contemplated in Arias
which would have put petitioner on his guard and examine the check/s
and vouchers with some degree of circumspection before signing the
same was obtaining in this case. We refer to the unusual fact that
the checks issued as payment for construction materials purchased
by the municipality were not made payable to the supplier, Kelly
Lumber, but to petitioner himself even as the disbursement vouchers
attached thereto were in the name of Kelly Lumber. The discrepancy
between the names indicated in the checks, on one hand, and those
in the disbursement vouchers, on the other, should have alerted
petitioner if he were conscientious of his duties as he purports to
be that something was definitely amiss. The fact that the checks
for the municipality’s purchases were made payable upon his order
should, without more, have prompted petitioner to examine the same

further together with the supporting documents attached to them,
and not rely heavily on the recommendations of his subordinates.
(Cruz v. Sandiganbayan, 467 SCRA 52 [2005])
3. What distinguishes petitioner’s case from Arias and
Magsuci is his foreknowledge of the existence of an anomaly. By
signing the Inspection Report and Disbursement Voucher despite
prior knowledge that the logs to which they pertained have been
confiscated by the DENR, and by his failure to observe the requisite
caution required by the circumstances, the petitioner has clearly
taken himself out of the ambit of the protective blanket given to public
officers by our rulings in Arias and Magsuci. (Escara v. People, G.R.

acts declared unlawful. [The Court] agree[s] with the view adopted
by the Solicitor General that the last sentence of paragraph(e) ia
intended to make clear the inclusion of officers and employees of
offices or government corporations which, under the ordinary concept
of “public officers” may not come within the term. It is a strained
construction of the provision to read it as applying exclusively to
public officers charged with the duty of granting license or permits
or other concessions. (Mejorada v. Sandiganbayan, 151 SCRA 399)

take action on the application, neither on the request. The only official
action required of her by law as the Municipal Mayor was to either
approve or disapprove the application. She did neither, but simply
referred the letter to her lawyer even when nothing demanded referral
to a lawyer. That referral was not the official action contemplated by
the law in that situation. That referral is inaction which, however, is
not the same as, nor can it be equated with, disapproval. To constitute
a violation of Sec. 3(0, R.A. No. 3019, the inaction on the part of the
public official is not solely for the purpose of obtaining some gain,
benefit or advantage for him (accused public officer). It may also be
for the purpose of discriminating against another. Accused was found
guilty of official inaction under Section 3(f). (Lacap v. Sandiganbayan,

Petitioner was a public officer, being then the Governor of Quirino
Province. She entered into an Agreement with Nakajima Trading on
behalf of the Provincial Government of Quirino. The following acts
caused gross and manifest disadvantage to the Province of Quirino:
First, entering into an agreement to purchase reconditioned heavy
equipment, contrary to the terms of a Sangguniang Panlalawigan
resolution which authorized her to purchase only brand new heavy
equipment; Second, advancing 40% of the total contract price to
Nakajima Trading, in violation of Section 338 of the Local Government
Code, which explicitly prohibits advance payments; and Third, paying
the balance, or 60% of the total contract price, despite non-compliance
by Nakajima Trading with a provision in the agreement, which
provided that delivery had to be effected within 90 days from payment.
Moreover, despite full payment of the contract price, the provincial
government did not receive every unit of equipment due under the
contract. (Castillo-Co v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 184766, August

The act is malum prohibitum.

Under Section 3(g) of R.A. No. 3019, it is enough to prove that
the accused is a public officer; that he entered into a contract or
transaction on behalf of the government; and that such contract
or transaction is grossly and manifestly disadvantageous to that
government. In other words, the act treated thereunder partakes of
the nature of a malum prohibitum, it is the commission of that act

Two modes of violating Sec. 3(h).

There are two modes by which a public officer who has a direct
or indirect financial or pecuniary interest in any business, contract,
or transaction may violate Section 3(h) of R.A. No. 3019. The first
mode is when the public officer intervenes or takes part in his official
capacity in connection with his financial or pecuniary interest in
any business, contract or transaction. The second mode is when he
is prohibited from having such an interest by the Constitution or by
law. (Teves v. Sandiganbayan, supra)
Illustration of the first mode:
During Mayor Domingo’s incumbency in 1993, a Multi-Purpose

Pavement project was undertaken on the 18 barangays of the
municipality for the paving and repair of the barangay roads. The
delivery of mixed gravel and sand was supposedly made by D.T.
Garcia Construction. However, D.T. Garcia Construction turned out
to be a mere “front ” or dummy to cover up Mayor Domingo’s business
transaction with his municipality. As municipal mayor, he was
directly responsible for the prosecution of the multi-purpose pavement
project in connection with which, the sand and gravel were delivered
to the different barangays. He was the one who approved the payment
for these deliveries and he co-signed the two checks where he was
named as payee as well as the check, which although made payable
to D.T. Garcia Construction, was indorsed to the municipal treasurer
and subsequently encashed to replenish the various cash items of
487

Art. 212

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

Mayor Domingo. Thus, Mayor Domingo intervened or took part in hia
official capacity in connection with his financial or pecuniary interest
in the transaction regarding the supply and delivery of mixed gravel
and sand to the constituent barangays. (Domingo v. Sandiganbayan,
G.R. No. 149175, October 25, 2005)
Actual intervention required.

What is contemplated in Section 3(h) of the anti-graft law is the
actual intervention in the transaction in which one has financial or
pecuniary interest in order that liability may attach. (Opinion No.
306, Series 1961 and Opinion No. 94, Series 1972 of the Secretary of
Justice) The official need not dispose his shares in the corporation
as long as he does not do anything for the firm in its contract with
the office. For the law aims to prevent the dominant use of influence,
authority and power. (Trieste, Sr. v. Sandiganbayan, 145 SCRA 508)

The undisputed facts of the case negate any showing that
Mayor Caballero had, in his capacity as mayor, used his influence,
power and authority in the award of the two contracts to his wife’s
business entities. He did not ask nor did he demand the members of
the Committee on Awards to award the respective contracts for the
supply of meals and materials to his wife’s companies. While Mayor
Caballero signed the disbursement vouchers, he did it only after all
the purchases had already been made, delivered and paid for by the
municipal treasurer. In fine, the mayor’s participation was limited
to signing the said vouchers long after the Committee on Awards
had decided to award the contracts to the business establishments
of his wife, and long after the transactions had been completed. The
only participation of Mayor Caballero in the transactions in question
was the mechanical act of signing the disbursement vouchers for
accounting and record purposes. (Caballero v. Sandiganbayan, G.R.
Nos. 137355-58, September 25, 2007)
Illustration of the second mode:
Section 89(2) of the Local Government Code makes it unlawful
for any local government official to hold interests in any cockpit.
Petitioner Edgar Teves, then mayor of Valencia, Negros Oriental
owned the Valencia cockpit, as shown by his sworn application for
registration of cockpit and the renewal application. Absent any
evidence that he divested himself of his ownership over the cockpit,
his ownership thereof is rightly to be presumed because a thing
once proved to exist continues as long as is usual with things of that
488

nature. His affidavit declaring that he “turned over the management

of the cockpit to Mrs. Teresita Z. Teves” is not sufficient proof that
he divested himself of his ownership over the cockpit. Only the
management of the cockpit was transferred to Teresita Teves effective

January 1990. Being the owner of the cockpit, his interest over it

was direct. Even if the ownership of petitioner Edgar Teves over
the cockpit were transferred to his wife, still he would have a direct

such, their property relation can be presumed to be that of conjugal

Imelda Romualdez-Marcos, and at the same time the family physician
of the Marcoses, had close personal relations and intimacy with and
free access to President Marcos, a public official; (2) Disini, taking
advantage of such family and close personal relations, requested and

Private persons, when acting in conspiracy with public officers,

officers and private persons alike constituting graft or corrupt
practices act or which may lead thereto. (Gregorio Singian, Jr. v.
Sandiganbayan, et al., G.R. Nos. 195011-19, September 30, 2013;
Santillano v. People, G.R. Nos. 175045-46, March 3, 2010)

Suspension and loss of benefits.
Any incumbent public officer against whom any criminal
prosecution under a valid information under this Act or under Title
7 Book II of the Revised Penal Code or for any offense involving fraud
upon government or public funds or property whether as a simple or
as a complex offense and in whatever stage of execution and mode
of participation, is pending in court, shall be suspended from office.
Should he be convicted by final judgment, he shall lose all
retirement or gratuity benefits under any law, but if he is acquitted,
he shall be entitled to reinstatement and to the salaries and benefits
which he failed to receive during suspension, unless in the meantime
Administrative proceedings have been filed against him.

Are all the penalties prescribed in Section 9 of R.A. No. 3019
imposable on a private person?

Section 9 mentions the penalties with which “any public officer or
private person” may be punished for committing any of the unlawful
acts or omissions enumerated in Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 of R.A. No.
3019. However, “perpetual disqualification from public office, and
confiscation or forfeiture in favor of the Government of any prohibited
interest and unexplained wealth” can hardly be imposed on a private
person.

In the event that such convicted officer, who may have already
been separated from the service, has already received such benefits
he shall be liable to restitute the same to the Government. (Sec. 13)
Public officer to be suspended.

It is believed that as regards a private person, only the penalty
of imprisonment “for not less than six years and one month nor more
than fifteen years” may be imposed.

The public officer against whom any criminal prosecution under
a valid information under this Act or under the R.P.C. on crimes
committed by public officers or for any offense involving fraud upon

496

Sec. 10 of R.A. No. 3019, as amended by B.P. Big. 195 provides
that all prosecution under this Act shall be within the original
jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan.
Section 13 is so clear and explicit that there is hardly room
for any extended court rationalization of the law. Section 13
unequivocally mandates the suspension of a public official from
office pending a criminal prosecution under R.A. No. 3019 or Title 7,
Book II of the Revised Penal Code or for any offense involving public
funds or property or fraud on government. This Court has repeatedly
held that such preventive suspension is mandatory, and there are no

Vs’ and *buts’about it. (Libanan v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 112386
June 14, 1994, 233 SCRA 163)
The suspension spoken of (in Section 13 of R.A. No. 3019)
follows the pendency in court of a criminal prosecution under a “valid
information.” Adherence to this rigoristic requirement funnels us
down to no other conclusion than that there must, first of all, be a
determination that the information filed is valid before suspension
can be effected. This circumstance militates strongly against the
notion that suspension under Section 13 is automatic. Suspension
is, however, mandatory. The word “shall” used in Section 13 is an
express index of this conclusion. (Noromor v. Mun. of Oras, Samar,
7 SCRA 405) In other words, the suspension envisioned in Section
13 of R.A. No. 3019 is mandatory but is not self-operative. That is
to say, that there must be someone who shall exercise the act of
suspension. (Luciano v. Provincial Governor, No. L-30306, June 20
1969, 28 SCRA 517)

Meaning of the word “acquitted” in Section 13.
It is obvious that when the statute speaks of the suspended
official being “acquitted,” it means that after due hearing and
evidence against him, the court is of the opinion
consideration of the
that his guilt has not been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Dismissal
of the case against the suspended officer will not suffice because
dismissal does not amount to acquittal. (Malanyaon v. Lising, 106

Art. 212

Suspension cannot be automatic.

Suspension cannot be automatic, the reason being that “hearing
on the validity of the information appears conformable to the spirit of
the law, taking into account the serious and far reaching consequences
of a suspension of an elective public official even before his conviction
and that public interest demands a speedy determination of the issues
involved in the cases.” Thus, before a suspension order can be issued,
a hearing on the issue of the validity of the information must first be
had. This pre-suspension hearing is conducted to determine basically
the validity of the information, from which the court can have a basis
to either suspend the accused, and proceed with the trial on the merits
of the case, or withhold the suspension of the latter and dismiss the
case, or correct any part of the proceeding which impairs its validity.
(People v. Albano, 163 SCRA 511)

Maximum duration of preventive suspension is ninety days.
The preventive suspension of an elective public official under
Section 13 of R.A. No. 3019 should be limited to 90 days under Section
42 ofP.D. No. 807, the Civil Service Decree. (Deloso u. Sandiganbayan,

Any public officer or employee who shall after the effective date
of this Act, transfer or convey any unlawfully acquired property shall
be repressed with imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years,
or a fine not exceeding ten thousand pesos, or both such imprisonment
and fine. The same repression shall be imposed upon any person who
shall knowingly accept such transfer or conveyance. (Sec. 12)

Is the proceeding criminal or civil?

The proceeding under R.A. No. 1379, otherwise known as the
“Anti-Graft Law,” is not a criminal proceeding, because it does not
terminate in the imposition of penalty but merely in the forfeiture
of the properties illegally acquired in favor of the State (Sec. 6) and,
because the procedure outlined therein leading to forfeiture is that
provided for in civil action. (Al meda, Sr. v. Perez, etc. and Republic,

5 SCRA 970)

However, it has also been held that forfeiture partakes of the
nature of a penalty. (Cabal v. Kapunan, Jr., 6 SCRA 1059; Katigbak v.
Solicitor General, 180 SCRA 540) Thus, while the procedural aspect of
these proceedings remain civil in form, the very forfeiture of property
found to be unlawfully acquired is inescapably in the nature of a
penalty. (Ong v. Sandiganbayan, 507 Phil. 6, 21-23 [2005])
Ultimate end of forfeiture.

In forfeiting unlawfully acquired properties, the ultimate end is
to abandon and surrender the properties unlawfully acquired in favor
of the government. It is not to simply satisfy some certain or specific
amount which can be done by merely proceeding with the personal
properties first and real properties next. More than the amount, it is
the property, whether real or personal, that is illegally acquired that
is being sought to be seized or taken in favor of the government. (Heirs

wealth amassed, accumulated or acquired is at least
P50,000,000.00. (Estrada v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No.

Reason behind Anti-Plunder Law.
Plunder, a term chosen from other equally apt terminologies
like kleptocracy and economic treason, punishes the use of high office

for personal enrichment, committed thru a series of acts done not in
the public eye but in stealth and secrecy over a period of time, that
day involve so many persons, here and abroad, and which touch so

Criminal Law

many states and territorial units. The acts and/or omissions sought
to be penalized do not involve simple cases of malversation of public
funds, bribery, extortion, theft and graft but constitute plunder of an
entire nation resulting in material damage to the national economy.
The above-described crime does not yet exist in Philippine statute
books. Thus, the need to come up with a legislation as a safeguard
against the possible recurrence of the depravities of the previous
regime and as a deterrent to those with similar inclination to succumb
to the corrupting influence of power. (Explanatory Note of Senate
Bill No. 733, quoted in Estrada v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 148965,
February 26, 2002, 377 SCRA 538, 555)
Act punished.

The act of a public officer in amassing or accumulating ill-gotten
wealth of at least P50,000,000 through a series or combination of acts
enumerated in Section 1, par. (d), of the Plunder Law. (Estrada v.
Sandiganbayan, supra)
Definition of combination, series, and pattern.

When the Plunder Law speaks of “combination,” it is referring
to at least two acts falling under different categories of enumeration
provided in Sec. 1, par. (d), e.g., raids on the public treasury in
Sec. 1, par. (d), subpar. (1), and fraudulent conveyance of assets
belonging to the National Government under Section 1, paragraph
(d), subparagraph (3).

To constitute a series, “there must be two (2) or more overt or
criminal acts falling under the same category of enumeration found in
Sec. 1, par. (d), e.g., misappropriation, malversation and raids on the
public treasury, all of which fall under Sec. 1, par. (d), subpar. (1)."
“Pattern” is sufficiently defined in Sec. 4, in relation to Section
1, par. (d), and Section 2

—

x x x x under Sec. 1 (d) of the law, a ‘pattern’ consists
of at least a combination or series of overt or criminal acts
enumerated in subsections (1) to (6) of Sec. 1 (d). Secondly,
pursuant to Sec. 2 of the law, the pattern of overt or
criminal acts is directed towards a common purpose or goal
which is to enable the public officer to amass, accumulate
or acquire ill-gotten wealth. And thirdly, there must
606

Crimes Committed By Public Officers

Art. 212

either be an ‘overall unlawful scheme’ or ‘conspiracy’ to
achieve said common goal. As commonly understood, the
term ‘overall unlawful scheme’ indicates a ‘general plan of

action or method’ which the principal accused and public
officer and others conniving with him follow to achieve
the aforesaid common goal. In the alternative, if there is
no such overall scheme or where the schemes or methods
used by multiple accused vary, the overt or criminal acts
must form part of a conspiracy to attain a common goal.
(Estrada v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 148560, November
19, 2001)

The predicate acts must be proved.
What the prosecution needs to prove beyond reasonable doubt
is only a number of acts sufficient to form a combination or series
which would constitute a pattern and involving an amount of at
least P50,000,000. There is no need to prove each and every other act
alleged in the Information to have been committed by the accused in
furtherance of the overall unlawful scheme or conspiracy to amass,
accumulate or acquire ill-gotten wealth. To illustrate, supposing that
the accused is charged in an Information for plunder with having
committed 50 raids on the public treasury. The prosecution need
not prove all these 50 raids, it being sufficient to prove by pattern
at least two of the raids beyond reasonable doubt provided only that
they amounted to at least P50,000,000.

A reading of Section 2 in conjunction with Section 4, brings us to
the logical conclusion that “pattern of overt or criminal acts indicative
of the overall unlawful scheme or conspiracy” inheres in the very
acts of accumulating, acquiring or amassing hidden wealth. Stated
otherwise, such pattern arises where the prosecution is able to prove
beyond reasonable doubt the predicate acts as defined in Section 1,
par. (d). Pattern is merely a by-product of the proof of the predicate
acts. This conclusion is consistent with reason and common sense.
There would be no other explanation for a combination or series of
overt or criminal acts to stash P50,000,000 or more, than “a scheme
or conspiracy to amass, accumulate or acquire ill gotten wealth.”
The prosecution is therefore not required to make a deliberate and
conscious effort to prove pattern as it necessarily follows with the
establishment of a series or combination of the predicate acts. (Estrada

o. Sandiganbayan, ibid.)

507

Art. 212

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The main plunderer should be identified.

The law on plunder requires that a particular public officer must
be identified as the one who amassed, acquired or accumulated illgotten wealth because it plainly states that plunder is committed by
any public officer who, by himself or in connivance with members of
his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates,
subordinates or other persons, amasses, accumulates or acquires
ill-gotten wealth in the aggregate amount or total value of at least
P50,000,000 through a combination or series of overt criminal acts
as described in Section 1(d) hereof. Surely, the law requires in the
criminal charge for plunder against several individuals that there
must be a main plunderer and her co-conspirators, who may be
members of her family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business
associates, subordinates or other persons.
Because plunder is a crime that only a public official can
commit by amassing, accumulating, or acquiring ill-gotten wealth
in the aggregate amount or total value of at least P50,000,000, the
identification in the information of such public official as the main
plunderer among the several individuals thus charged is logically
necessary under the law itself. Where the individuals charged were
10 public officials, it was only proper to identify the main plunderer or
plunderers among the 10 accused who herself or himself had amassed,
accumulated, or acquired ill-gotten wealth with the total value of at
least P50,000,000. (Arroyo v. People, G.R. No. 220598, April 18, 2017)

Illustration of the crime of Plunder.
People v. Estrada
(Crim. Case No. 26558, September 12, 2007)

The prosecution has proven beyond reasonable doubt the elements of
plunder as follows:
(a) The principal accused Joseph Ejercito Estrada, at the time of
the commission of the acts charged in the Amended Information was the
President of the Republic of the Philippines;

(b) He acted in connivance with then Governor Luis “Chavit" Singeon,
who was granted immunity from suit by the Office of the Ombudsman, and
with the participation of other persons named by prosecution witnesses in
the course of the trial of this case, in amassing, accumulating and acquiring
ill-gotten wealth as follows:

TITLE SEVEN

Crimes Committed By Public Officers

November 1998 to August 2000 in the aggregate amount of Five
Hundred Forty Five Million Two Hundred Ninety One Thousand Pesos

(P545.291,000.00), Two Hundred Million Pesos (P200,000,000.00) of
which was deposited in the Erap Muslim Youth Foundation; and
(ii) by a series consisting of two (2) acts of ordering the GSIS and
the SSS to purchase shares of stock of Belle Corporation and collecting
or receiving commission from the sales of Belle Shares in the amount
of One Hundred Eighty Nine Million Seven Hundred Thousand Pesos
(P189,700,000.00) which was deposited in the Jose Velarde account.

The two different series of predicate acts outlined above

(particularly, first, the regular and methodical acquisition of ill-

gotten wealth through collections from illegal gambling and second,
the receipt of unlawful commissions from the sales of Belle shares
twice), whether taken separately or independently of the other or in
combination with each other, unquestionably constitute the crime
of plunder.
The predicate acts alleged in sub-paragraphs (a) and (c) of the
Amended Information, which formed two separate series of acts of
a different nature, were linked by the fact that they were plainly
geared towards a common goal which was the accumulation of illgotten wealth for FPres. Estrada and that they shared a pattern or
a common method of commission which was the abuse or misuse of
the high authority or power of the Presidency.

Rule of Evidence.

For purposes of establishing the crime of plunder, it shall not be
necessary to prove each and every criminal act done by the accused
in furtherance of the scheme or conspiracy to amass, accumulate
or acquire ill-gotten wealth, it being sufficient to establish beyond
reasonable doubt a pattern of overt or criminal acts indicative of the
overall unlawful scheme or conspiracy. (Sec. 4)

Revised Penal Code, applicable.
In the imposition of penalties, the degree of participation and the

attendance of mitigating and extenuating circumstances, as provided

by the Revised Penal Code, shall be considered by the court. (Sec. 2)

(i)
by a series of acts of receiving bi-monthly collections from
"jueteng”, a form of illegal gambling, during the period beginning

Art. 212

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Forfeiture of ill-gotten wealth.

The court shall declare any and all ill-gotten wealth and their
interests and other incomes and assets including the properties
and shares of stocks derived from the deposit or investment thereof
forfeited in favor of the State. (Sec. 2)
Plunder is malum in se.

Plunder is a malum in se which requires proof of criminal
intent. The application of mitigating and extenuating circumstances
in the Revised Penal Code to prosecutions under the Anti-Plunder
Law indicates quite clearly that mens rea is an element of plunder
since the degree of responsibility of the offender is determined by his
criminal intent.
Any doubt as to whether the crime of plunder is a malum in
se must be deemed to have been resolved in the affirmative by the
decision of Congress in 1993 to include it among the heinous crimes
punishable by reclusion perpetua to death. The legislative declaration
in R.A. No. 7659 that plunder is a heinous offense implies that it is
a malum in se. For when the acts punished are inherently immoral
or inherently wrong, they are mala in se and it does not matter that
such acts are punished in a special law, especially since in the case
of plunder, the predicate crimes are mainly mala in se. (Estrada v.

TITLE SEVEN
Crimes Committed By Public Officers

Art. 213

1.

By entering into an agreement with any interested party
or speculator or making use of any other scheme, to defraud
the Government, in dealing with any person with regard to
furnishing supplies, the making of contracts, or the adjustment
or settlement of accounts relating to public property or funds.

The crime of frauds against public treasury is consummated by
merely entering into an agreement with any interested party or
speculator or by merely making use of any other scheme to defraud
the Government.
It is not necessary that the Government is actually defrauded
by reason of the transaction. It is sufficient that the public officer who
acted in his official capacity had the intent to defraud the Government.

2.

By demanding, directly or indirectly, the payment of sums
different from or larger than those authorized by law, in the
collection of taxes, licenses, fees, and other imposts.

Elements of illegal exactions:
a. The offender is a public officer entrusted with the collection of

3.

By failing voluntarily to issue a receipt, as provided by law, for
any sum of money collected by him officially, in the collection
of taxes, licenses, fees, and other imposts.

b.

4.

By collecting or receiving, directly or indirectly, by way of
payment or otherwise, things or objects of a nature different
from that provided by law, in the collection of taxes, licenses,
fees, and other imposts.

Elements of frauds against public treasury (Art. 213, par. 1):

a.

That the offender be a public officer.

b.

That he should have taken advantage of his office, that is, he
intervened in the transaction in his official capacity.

c.

That he entered into an agreement with any interested party
or speculator or made use of any other scheme with regard to
(1) furnishing supplies, (2) the making of contracts, or (3) the
adjustment or settlement of accounts relating to public property
or funds.

d.

That the accused had intent to defraud the Government.

The public officer must act in his official capacity.

The offender must have the duty as public officer to deal with any
person with regard to furnishing supplies, the making of contracts, or
the adjustment or settlement of accounts relating to public property

or funds.

612

taxes, licenses, fees and other imposts.

He is guilty of any of the following acts or omissions:
(1)

Demanding, directly or indirectly, the payment of sums
different from or larger than those authorized by law; or

(2)

Failing voluntarily to issue a receipt, as provided by law,
for any sum of money collected by him officially; or

(3)

Collecting or receiving, directly or indirectly, by way
of payment or otherwise, things or objects of a nature
different from that provided by law.

Mere demand for larger or different amount Is sufficient to
consummate the crime.

Note the word “demanding" in paragraph (a) of subdivision
No. 2 of Article 213. It would seem that it is not necessary that the
taxpayer should actually pay an amount larger than or different from
that fixed by law.
Collecting officer must issue official receipts.

Where the deputy sheriff received certain amounts in connection
with the performance of his duties without issuing the corresponding
official receipts thereof, he is guilty of illegal exaction penalized by
Paragraph 2(b) of Article 213 of the Revised Penal Code. He likewise
violates Section 113 of Article III, Chapter V of the National Accounting
and Auditing Manual which provides that no payment of any nature
shall be received by a collecting officer without immediately issuing
an official receipt thereof. (Ganaden v. Bolasco, 64 SCRA 50)
613

Art. 213

TITLE SEVEN

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

When there is deceit in demanding greater fees than those
prescribed by law, the crime committed is estafa and not illegal
exaction.
Thus, when the municipal treasurer, by means of deceit, collected
from several residents of the municipality greater fees than those
prescribed by Act No. 1147 for branding and registering of cattle,
with prejudice to the owners, to the amount of P174.50, these facts
constitute the crime of estafa and not that of illegal exaction. (VII
Viada, 394, cited in U.S. v. Lopez, et al., 10 Phil. 480)
Tax collector need not account for tax collected.

When a public officer, whose official duty is to collect taxes,
receives a payment in said concept, he makes himself directly
accountable to the Government for the money so collected and
received inasmuch as thereafter said money acquires the character
or forms part of the public funds. If the money is misappropriated,
it is the Government which suffers the damage. (People v. Policher,
60 Phil. 771)

Hence, a tax collector who collected a sum larger than that
authorized by law and spent all of them is guilty of two crimes,
namely: (1) illegal exaction, for demanding a greater amount; and
(2) malversation, for misappropriating the amount collected.
The difference between the amount fixed by law and the amount
actually collected, having been paid in the concept of tax and received
as such by the tax collector, forms part of the public funds. The
Government may refund the difference.
Officer or employee of Bureau of Internal Revenue or Bureau of
Customs not covered by this article.

Article 213 is not applicable if the offender is an officer or
employee of the Bureau of Internal Revenue or Bureau of Customs.
The National Internal Revenue Code or the Administrative Code
applies. (Art. 213, last par.)

Book Two of this Code, the penalty of temporary special
disqualification in its maximum period to perpetual special
disqualification2 shall be imposed upon any public officer who,

the frauds or deceits enumerated in said provisions.

Elements:
1. That the offender is a public officer.
2. That he takes advantage of his official position.
3.

That he commits any of the frauds or deceits enumerated in
Articles 315 to 318.

The public officer must take advantage of his official position.

Since the councilor committed the crime of estafa as a private
individual, it is not proper to impose on him the penalty provided by
Article 399 (now Art. 214) of the Code for public officers, because he
received the money not on the exercise of his functions as councilor.
(U.S. v. Dacuycuy, 9 Phil. 88) But when the councilor takes advantage
of his official position in committing estafa, the disqualification
mentioned in Article 399 (now Art. 214) is a part of the penalty to be
imposed. (U.S. v. Torrida, 23 Phil. 193)
“Any of the frauds or deceits enumerated” in "the provisions of
Chapter Six, Title Ten, Book Two, of this Code."

Articles 315 to 318, which cover the provisions referred to, define
and penalize (1) estafa, (2) other forms of swindling, (3) swindling a
minor, and (4) other deceits.

for gain or profit, but simply to invest funds at a legal interest.
But buying regularly securities for resale Is speculation.
What he may not do is to buy regularly securities for the purpose

Examples of appointive public officer.

Under Article 14 of the Code of Commerce, the following (among

3.

That the transaction takes place within the territory subject to
his jurisdiction.

4.

That he becomes interested in the transaction during his

The transaction must be one of exchange or speculation.

It is sufficient under this article that the appointive officer has
an interest in any transaction of exchange or speculation, such as,
buying and selling stocks, commodities, land, etc., hoping to take
advantage of an expected rise or fall in price.

In all cases, persons guilty of malversation shall also
suffer the penalty of perpetual special disqualification and a
fine equal to the amount of the funds malversed or equal to
the total value of the property embezzled.
The failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming
any public funds or property with which he is chargeable,
upon demand by any duly authorized officer, shall be prima
facie evidence that he has put such missing funds or property
to personal uses. (As amended by RA. No. 1060 and RA. No.

accountable public officers. Their signatures were needed before

Art. 217

Note the phrase in the law:“who, by reason of the duties of his
office, is accountable for public funds or property.”
That the person accused is a mere clerk and not a bonded officer
is of no legal consequence. The vital fact is that he is an employee
of, or in some way connected with, the government and that, in the
course of his employment, he receives money or property belonging
to the government for which he is bound to account. It is the nature
of the duties, not the relatively important name given to the office,
which is the controlling factor in determining whether or not the
accused is an accountable public officer. (U.S. v. Velasquez, 32 Phil.
157) An emergency employee entrusted with the collection and/or
custody of public funds may be held liable for malversation, if he
misappropriates such funds.
Accountable officer.

An accountable officer is one who has custody or control of public
property by reason of the duties of his office. (Sec. 101, P.D. No. 1445)
Under Sec. 340 of the Local Government Code, “any officer of the
local government unit whose duty permits or requires the possession
or custody of local government funds shall be accountable and
responsible for the safekeeping thereof and other local officers who,
though not accountable by the nature of their duties, may likewise
be similarly held accountable and responsible for local government
funds through their participation in the use or application thereof.”
To have custody or control of the funds or property by reason of
the duties of his office, a public officer must be a cashier, treasurer,
collector, property officer or any other officer or employee who is
tasked with the taking of money or property from the public which
they are duty-bound to keep temporarily until such money or property
are properly deposited in official depository banks or similar entities;
or until they shall have endorsed such money or property to other
accountable officers or concerned offices. (Panganiban v. People, G.R.
No. 211543, December 9, 2015)

Art. 217

any disbursement of public funds can be made. No checks can be
prepared and no payment can be effected without their signatures
on a disbursement voucher and the corresponding check. In other
words, any disbursement and release of public funds required their
approval. Therefore, they had control and responsibility over the
funds of the municipality.

Certain officials held guilty of malversation.
1. Municipal president who spent for himself P60 which he had
received of the superintendent of schools, as rent for a house
owned by the municipality, was declared guilty of malversation,
said amount having been received by him by reason of his
office. (U.S. v. Togonon, 12 Phil. 516)
2. Justice of the peace who was found short after examination of
his accounts for fees, fines and costs, collected by him during
certain month of a year, was declared guilty of malversation.
(U.S. v. Sagun, 15 Phil. 178)
3. Municipal secretary acted as secretary of a committee
composed of the municipal president, treasurer, secretary and
a councilor, which conducted a public auction for the sale of
fishing privileges. The bidders deposited the amounts of their
respective bids with that secretary. He misappropriated them
for himself.
Held: Guilty of malversation. The money was deposited
with him under authority of law. The obligation of the secretary
was to safeguard the money for the Government. (U.S. v.
Lafuente, 37 Phil. 671)
4. Commanding officer of the 22nd FSU of the AFP Finance Center
who had custody of P3.27 Million representing the Special
Duty Allowances and other Maintenance Operating Funds of
the PSG personnel and failed to explain the missing funds in
his account and to restitute the amount upon demand. (Cantos
v. People, G.R. No. 184908, July 3, 2013)

Funds or property must be received in official capacity.

In Manuel v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 158413, February
8, 2012, the municipal mayor and treasurer were found to be

P5.00 for a permit, to slaughter animals under a promise to secure a

624

525

A municipal councilor who had received from another person

Art. 217

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

receipt therefor or to account for the money, but misappropriated the
same, is guilty of estafa, not malversation. (U.S. v. Radaza, 17 Phu
286) The councilor did not receive the money in his official capacity
because he had no duty to collect or receive the slaughter fee.

When a public officer had no authority to receive the money for
the Government and upon receipt of the same he misappropriated
it, the crime committed is estafa, not malversation. (U.S. v. Solis 7
Phil. 195)
But when the public officer has (1) the official custody of
public funds or property or the duty to collect or receive funds
due the government, and (2) the obligation to account for them
to the government, his misappropriation of the same constitutes
malversation.
A public officer having only a qualified charge of Government
property without authority to part with its physical possession
cannot be held liable for malversation.

The defendant was forage master, having charge of Government
forage in the corral in Manila, subject to the orders of the
quartermaster, who was directly responsible to the Government
therefor and without whose order no forage could be issued. Without
orders from the quartermaster, the defendant sent out of the corral
186 bales of hay and 138 sacks of oats which were received by private
persons not authorized to receive them.

Held: Defendant’s possession of the property was not such as
to render its abstraction by him malversation. He is guilty of theft.
(U.S. v. Webster, 6 Phil. 394)
The abstraction of funds from a safe by a clerk without the
consent of the person charged with their custody, with the intent
to convert them to his own use, is held to be theft and not estafa
(embezzlement) or one of its kindred offenses, in a case wherein it
appeared that while the clerk was intrusted with the combination
and the key of the safe, he had no control over its contents and was
not authorized to open the safe, or withdraw the contents or any
part thereof except by the express direction of the person charged
with the custody of the contents and responsible therefor. (U.S. v.
Wickersham, 20 Phil. 440)
626

TITLE SEVEN
Crimes Committed By Public Officers

Art. 217

Webster and Wickersham cases not applicable when the accused

had authority to receive money pertaining to the Government.

It must be noted that appellant himself does not seriously
dispute his accountability for the public funds received by him in
custody by virtue of his office. He only argues that because he could
not disburse such public funds without any order from superior
authority, and therefore, had only a “qualified charge of the properties
that come into his possession,” the crime committed by him was theft
not malversation, following the cases of U.S. v. Webster, 6 Phil. 393
and U.S. v. Wickersham, 20 Phil. 444. [The] [Court] find[s] no merit
in this contention. The vital fact is not so much the manner in which
appellant could lawfully perform his duties in relation to said funds
as the fact that he received money belonging to the Government for
which he was bound to account. It is, hence, the nature of his duties,
and not his performance of those duties, that determines the character
of his offense. (U.S. v. Velasquez, 32 Phil. 157)
Liability of private individuals In conspiracy with public officers
guilty of malversation under Article 217.

Both Groizard and Viada in their commentaries of the Spanish
Penal Code, which is identical with the provisions of the Penal Code
of the Philippines, are of the opinion that even private parties who
participate as co-perpetrators in the offense of malversation could be
penalized for the commission of such crime.
Thus, a janitor and five policemen who aided the municipal
treasurer in the commission of malversation by taking the safe
containing money from the municipal treasury and carrying it to
another place and then and there taking the contents thereof, were
held guilty of malversation, although they were not accountable public
officers. (U.S. v. Ponte, et al., 20 Phil. 379)
The ruling in Ponte case is reiterated in People v. Sendaydiego,
81 SCRA 120, where it was held that a private person conspiring
with an accountable public officer in committing malversation is also
guilty of malversation.
People v. Sendaydiego
(81 SCRA 120)

Facts: In 1969, Sendaydiego, the provincial treasurer of Pangasman,
in conspiracy with Samson, an employee of a lumber and hardware store in
527

Art. 217

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Dagupan City, used six (6) forged provincial vouchers to evidence fictitious
sales of construction materials in order to embezzle from the road and bridge
fund the total sum of P57.048.23. Samson hand-carried the vouchers and
followed-up their processing in the offices of the provincial government and
received the cash payments.

Held: Samson is a co-principal in the six crimes of malversation because
he conspired with the provincial treasurer in committing those offenses. The
trial court correctly ruled that a private person conspiring with an accountable
public officer in committing malversation is also guilty of malversation.
(People v. Rodis, 105 Phil. 1294; U.S. v. Ponte, 20 Phil. 379; U.S. v. Dato and
Lustre, 37 Phil. 359; U.S. v. Dowdell, 11 Phil. 4; People v. Caluag, 94 Phil. 457)
In Barriga v. Sandganbayan, G.R. Nos. 161784-86, April 26, 2005, it
was likewise held that: A public officer who is not in charge of public funds or
property by virtue of her official position, or even a private individual, may be
liable for malversation or illegal use of public funds or property if such public
officer or private individual conspires with an accountable public officer to
commit malversation or illegal use of public funds or property.

Red Cross, Anti-Tuberculosis Society and Boy Scouts funds
received by an assistant cashier of the provincial treasurer by
virtue of his official position, for custody, acquire the character
of public funds. (People v. Velasquez, 72 Phil. 98)
Reason: Although Red Cross funds, etc., are not strictly
public funds, it is the intention of the law to make such funds
partake of some of the characteristics of public funds, in that
they are trust funds placed in the custody of accountable public
officer for the purpose for which they are contributed by the
public. (People v. De la Serna, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 12, 159)

made by him upon property belonging to a judgment debtor, is
a government fund. (People v. Ramos, CA., 38 O.G. 817)

NARIC funds received by a municipal treasurer as ex oficio in
charge of the funds of the NARIC in the municipality. Although

not public funds, NARIC funds become impressed with that

Coconut levy funds are not only affected with public interest but

Private individuals liable for malversation under Art 222.

The provisions of Article 217 shall apply to (1) private individuals
who, in any capacity whatsoever, have charge of national, provincial

or depository of funds or property attached, seized or deposited by
public authority. (Art. 222)

Art. 217

Public property.

Firearms or explosives seized from persons not authorized to
possess the same, which are in the custody of peace officers, are public
property. (See People v. Magsino, CA., 50 O.G. 675)
Materials, chiefly timber, of the Bureau of Commerce and
Industry, which are in the custody of a bonded warehouseman, are
public property. (People v. Marino, 55 Phil. 537)

But from the moment the accused, a municipal treasurer, drew

government funds corresponding to the face value of the check which

was previously endorsed by the complainant, as payee of said check,

the funds became private property of the complainant which the
accused was under obligation to deliver to her. His non-delivery of the
money resulted, not in the commission of the crime of malversation,

Such phrase denotes the express intention of the Penal Code to

national, provincial or municipal funds, revenues or property, but
of other funds or property, even if they belong to private individuals
as long as such funds or property are placed in their custody. (People

Appropriating public funds or property.
To appropriate public funds or property includes every attempt
to dispose of the same without right.

1.

U.S. v. Calimag
(12 Phil. 687)

Facts: The accused was municipal treasurer of the town of Solana,
Province of Cagayan, and also deputy provincial treasurer, receiving as
salary, for the former position, P25.00 per month and for the latter, P10.00
per month. On December 2, 1907, the auditor for that district examined the
books and cash of the accused, and informed him that there was a difference
of P49.04 between the amount for which the accused was responsible and
the amount counted by said auditor. The auditor asked the accused how this
occurred, and he said that it was because he had to advance his salary of
P10.00 a month from July to November, or a total amount of P50.00.
Held: It was proven at the trial that the accused had no authority to pay
himself his salary of P10.00 a month as deputy to the provincial treasurer.
It must be considered that he had made personal use of the fund of the
Government.
Similarly, a municipal treasurer who gave out unofficial and
unauthorized loans to several co-employees, including herself, from the cash
account of the municipality was found guilty of the crime of Malversation of
Public Funds. (Manuel v. Sandiganbayan, supra)

Art. 217

Suppose, A, a teller in the office of the city treasurer, was leaving
the office of the treasurer with public funds which had been collected
by him from certain taxpayers, and then and there an NBI agent,
who had been informed of the plan of A to take public funds, arrested
and searched him and found the money in his pocket, is A guilty of
frustrated or consummated malversation?

It is believed that A is guilty of consummated malversation.
The public funds or property taken need not be misappropriated,
as the word “take” is separated by the word “or” from the word

‘misappropriation.’

Misappropriating public funds or property was committed by the
treasurer of a municipality who spent for his personal benefit certain
amount of money which formed part of the funds under his charge.

3.

Consenting or permitting, through abandonment or negligence,
any other person to take public funds or property.

When a public officer, accountable for public funds or property,
violates regulations of his office, that violation is evidence of
negligence. Thus, a municipal treasurer who cashed with public
funds private checks drawn in favor of his wife, the drawer not having
enough cash in the drawee bank, was held liable for malversation
through negligence, the cashing of private checks with public funds
being a violation of standing regulations. (People v. Luntao, C.A. 50
O.G. 1182)
But in malversation, the negligence of the accountable public
officer must be positively and clearly shown to be inexcusable,
approximating malice or fraud.
People v. Bernas
(CA., 53 O.G. 1106)

Taking or misappropriating public funds or property.
What is the meaning of “taking” as an act of malversation? Is
it the same as the meaning of the word “taking” in theft or robbery
with violence against or intimidation of persons?

Facts: The defendant municipal treasurer requisitioned from the Office
of the Provincial Treasurer of Romblon for 200 large sacks of Naric rice. As
the rice was late in coming and the people were clamoring for the same,
the defendant personally went to Romblon to follow up his requisition, but
was able to obtain only 85 small sacks of the local variety. The sale of these
sacks of rice to the public was brisk but before the same were sold, the 200
big sacks of Naric rice previously requisitioned arrived. The defendant then
had a big quantity of Naric rice in stock in addition to the remaining local
rice still undisposed. The harvest season in Romblon was close at hand which
impending event would inevitably cause the prices to go considerably down.

530

531

2.

Art. 217

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Apprehensive of the possibility of being left with an unusually large stock of
rice unsold, the defendant wired the Provincial Treasurer, offering to return
the 200 big sacks of Naric rice; the latter, however, advised the defendant to
get in touch with other municipal treasurers in Sibuyan Islands and to try
to dispose the surplus stocks to them.

To effect a swifter disposal of the large stock of rice, defendant in a trip
to the provincial capital, requested authority from his superiors to sell the
rice on credit; the latter, however, warned him that such practice was not
sanctioned by existing regulations and to do so would be defendant’s own
risk. At that time, he had no safe place to keep the rice, and there was an
impending typhoon. Faced with no better alternative, the defendant decided
to sell the rice on credit to the municipal employees whose wages and salaries
he himself had to disburse. This measure was adopted as it was easy for him
to collect whatever accounts were receivable from said vendees on credit.

He admits that the sale of the rice on credit was done not in accordance
with existing rules and regulations, but he seeks exculpation from criminal
liability in that he did so under extreme necessity and in good faith.
Held: The defendant cannot be reasonably accused of having consented,
or through abandonment or negligence, permitted other persons to take public
funds or property in his custody simply because in selling the rice on credit,
he disposed of the cereal for valuable consideration as above explained. This
fact negatives negligence or criminal abandonment. But assuming, arguendo,
that his conduct in selling the rice on credit before the advent of the typhoon
constitutes negligence, (the Court] opine[s] that to render such element a basis
for conviction under this article, the negligence involved must be positively
and clearly shown to be inexcusable, approximating malice or fraud. (Viada,
Vol. IV, pp. 498-499, 5th Ed.; Cuello Calon, Vol. II, Derecho Penal, p. 369)
If there was any negligence exhibited by the defendant in the instant case,
[the Court] believe[s] that the same is excusable and attaches no criminal
liability whatsoever. Nonetheless, as the sales on credit were admittedly
made in violation of existing regulations, said transactions are deemed to
have been undertaken at the defendant’s own risk and personal responsibility
and he may be held civilly accountable for the unpaid accounts in favor of
the municipal government of San Fernando, Romblon.

Malversation may be committed through dolo or culpa.

Malversation may be committed either through a positive act
of misappropriation of public funds or property, or passively through
negligence. To sustain a charge of malversation, there must either
be criminal intent or criminal negligence, and while the prevailing
facts of a case may not show that deceit attended the commission of
the offense, it will not preclude the reception of evidence to prove the

TITLE SEVEN
Crimes Committed By Public Officers

existence of negligence because both are equally punishable under
Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code.
More in point, the felony involves breach of public trust, and
whether it is committed through deceit or negligence, the law makes it
punishable and prescribes a uniform penalty therefor. Even when the
Information charges willful malversation, conviction for malversation
through negligence may still be adjudged if the evidence ultimately
proves the mode of commission of the offense. Explicitly stated -

xxx [E]ven on the putative assumption that the evidence
against petitioner yielded a case of malversation by negligence,
but the information was for intentional malversation, under
the circumstances of this case, his conviction under the first
mode of misappropriation would still be in order. Malversation
is committed either intentionally or by negligence. The dolo
or the culpa present in the offense is only a modality in the
perpetration of the felony. Even if the mode charged differs
from mode proved, the same offense of malversation is involved
and conviction thereof is proper, xxx (Torres v. People, G.R.
No. 175074, August 31, 2011 citing Cabello v. Sandiganbayan,
274 Phil. 369(1991])
Malversation by culpa.
Sarigumba v. Sandiganbayan
(GJi. Nos. 154239-41, February 16, 2005)

Facts: Sometime in 1994, Congressman Ramiro promised to give
P10,000.00 to each of the 33 barangay captains of the Municipality of Tudela,
Misamis Occidental, assuring the barangay captains that the amount was his
personal gift to each of them. It turned out that the amount provided came
from his Countrywide Development Fund (CDF). Petitioner Mayor Sarigumba
then secured a cash advance amounting to P330,000.00 chargeable against
the CDF “for the payment of various expenses during the assembly meeting
for peace and order of 33 barangays of Tudela” and gave P500.00 to each of
the barangay captains with the agreement that each of the barangay captains
would give P500.00 to the Association of Barangay Captains (ABC) which
would serve as contributions for projects. Mayor Saligumba liquidated the
amounts received as meals, snacks and expenses for peace and order meetings.
However, it was discovered that some of the barangay captains in good faith
had spent the money for their personal use having thought all along that
the amount distributed was a “cash gift’ promised by Congressman Ramiro.
533

532

Art. 217

Art. 217

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

It was, however, refunded back to the barangay government by the barangay
captains upon learning that the amount distributed was from the CDF and
intended for the Peace and Order Campaign. Mayor Saligumba was charged
with malversation of the total amount of P330,000.00.
Held.'. The felony consists not only in misappropriating or converting
public funds or property to one’s personal use but also by knowingly allowing
others to make use of or misappropriate the same. The felony may thus be
committed by dolo or by culpa. The crime is consummated and the appropriate
penalty is imposed regardless of whether the mode of commission is with
intent or due to negligence An accountable officer may thus be convicted of
malversation even if there is no direct evidence of misappropriation and the
only evidence is that there is a shortage in the officer’s account which he has
not been able to explain satisfactorily. All that is essential is proof that the
accountable officer has received public funds but that when demand therefor
is made, be is unable to satisfactorily account for the same.
Based on the record, it is true that petitioner Sarigumba did not make
use of the P330.000.00 which he received from the Municipal Treasurer
which was chargeable to the CDF of Congressman Ramiro; hence, there
is no probable cause for the charge of malversation by dolo against him.
It must be stressed, however, that the petitioner-mayor is also charged
with malversation by culpa under the Information, allegedly committed by
distributing P9,500.00 to each of the barangay captains without bothering
to inform them that the amount was from the CDF of Congressman Ramiro
and that the money should be used for the peace and order campaign in
their respective jurisdictions. All along, the barangay captains were of the
belief that the amounts they received were from the personal funds of the
Congressman and that they had unfettered use of the money, for whatever
purpose they chose. Even if the barangay captains had indeed acted in good
faith, still, if petitioner Sarigumba had failed to make it clear before or when
he distributed the money to them that the money was for the peace and
order campaign in their respective barangays, he may be criminally liable
for malversation by culpa.
People v. Pili

CCA., 53 O.G. 4535)
Facts: The defendant, Benjamin Pili, was the postmaster of Coron,
Palawan. As such postmaster, he was accountable for public funds, consisting
of collections from telegraphic transfers, money orders, postal savings bank
deposits and proceeds from the sales of stamps. His cash accountability, upon
examination, was found short of P24,476.34.

For his defense, the defendant Pili claims that on the night of April 21,
1953, the drawer of his table was forced open and the cash, warrants and
checks which he kept in said drawer were stolen. Explaining the reason why
534

TITLE SEVEN
Crimes Committed By Public Officers

Art. 217

the cash, warrants and checks were in his table drawer instead of in his iron
safe with which he was provided, the defendant ventured the following: At
around 3 o’clock in the afternoon, the municipal treasurer requested him
to deposit the money which he (defendant) had in his possession, as the
municipal treasurer would need to pay the teachers the following morning.
Since it was already late in the afternoon when the request was made, the
defendant decided to work overtime so as to put his books in order and prepare
the money for the necessary deposit. He used a petromax lamp to provide

him the necessary light in his work that night. At about half past 10 o’clock
in the evening, the petromax light went out due to lack of kerosene. Because
he had no more light, the cash, checks, and warrants, which he was then
listing and which were on the top of his table, had to be placed inside the
drawer which he placed under lock. Total darkness, caused by the extinction
of the petromax light, prevented him (defendant) from returning the money
to the combination safe, claiming that after he had taken the cash, checks,
and warrants from the safe, he closed the same. At around 8:05 the next
morning, the defendant, as usual, reported for work and found out that the
checks, money orders, and cash which he placed inside his drawer were gone
and the lock of the said drawer was forcibly opened.

Held'. The accused was negligent in the performance of his duties as
an accountable officer. This negligence consisted in his failure to take the
necessary precaution or zeal, in returning the warrants, cash, and checks in
the combination safe in order to safeguard them. If he were not negligent,
at the time that the light of the petromax went out, he could have asked
the policeman on duty to furnish him the necessary light so that the money
which he claimed to have been counting and listing, could have been properly
returned to the safe where they rightfully belonged and should be kept. Even
on this score alone, the accused is already liable for the offense charged.

Test to determine negligence.

Negligence is the omission to do something which a reasonable
man, guided by those considerations which ordinarily regulate
the conduct of human affairs, would do, or the doing of something
which a prudent and reasonable man would do. The test by which
to determine the existence of negligence in a particular case may be
stated as follows: Did the defendant in doing the alleged negligent
act use that reasonable care and caution which an ordinary prudent
person would have used in the same situation? If not, he is guilty of
negligence. The law here in effect adopts the standard supposed to
be supplied by the imaginary conduct of the discreet paterfamilias
of the Roman Law. The existence of negligence in a given case is not
determined by reference to the personal judgment of the actor in
535

the situation before him. The law considers what would be reckless
blameworthy, or negligent in the man of ordinary intelligence and
prudence and determines liability to that. (Leano v. Domingo, G.R.
No. 84378, July 4, 1991, citing Layugan v. Intermediate Appellate
Court, 167 SCRA 363, 372-373 [1998])

The measure of negligence is the standard of care commensurate
with the occasion.

To measure the negligence which pervades a particular act
or omission, we must first determine upon a standard of care
commensurate with the occasion, and then endeavor to ascertain
how far short of this standard falls the act or omission in question.

Thus, where a municipal treasurer, to whom was entrusted for
safekeeping an opium pipe confiscated by the authorities, put the said
pipe in the drawer of an aparador in his office and the office was kept
locked, it cannot be said that he abandoned the property when it was
stolen from the aparador. (U.S. v. Garces, 31 Phil. 637)

Note-. The Supreme Court believes that the treasurer took steps
to guard the opium pipe which its value warranted.

Even if he had a safe, the treasurer cannot be expected to keep
the opium pipe there.
People u. Torres
(CA., 53 O.G. 4850)

Facts: Defendant Jose A. Torres was a First Lieutenant in the Philippine
Army and was assigned as special disbursing officer of the 22nd Battalion
Combat Team. As such disbursing officer, it was his duty to collect the
insurance premiums and salary loans by deducting them from the base pay
of the personnel of the battalion, and remit this collection to the Government
Service Insurance System at the end of every month. Under Torres performing
clerical duties were Sergeants Juan de la Cruz and Antonio Llado.

TITLE SEVEN
Crimes Committed By Public Officers

Art. 217

Government Service Insurance System was only P15,807.47, thus making

P56,458.04 the total amount malvereed.
As a finance officer of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the defendant
jmew that the meager pay of a sergeant in the Philippine Army is barely
enough to modestly maintain a family. He also knew that Sergeant De la Cruz
was sporting a car and had another woman aside from his lawful wife. Yet, the
defendant did not even bother to investigate or verify from the Government
Service Insurance System if Sergeant De la Cruz faithfully delivered the
amounts entrusted to him. Instead, the defendant continued to entrust to De
]a Cruz large amounts of insurance premiums for more than one year until
the abstraction was discovered when Sergeant Leonilo Quiambao, who had
been punctually paying his premiums, complained to the defendant that he
(Quiambao) could not secure a loan from the System because, according to
the System, Quiambao was not paying his insurance premiums regularly.

Held: The fact that he ordered his trusted driver to accompany Sergeant
De la Cruz to the offices of the Government Service Insurance System
whenever the latter delivered the insurance premiums, cannot exonerate the
defendant of his criminal liability. To entrust to a mere driver the delicate
task of supervising the proper delivery of big sums of money is, to say the
least, a proof of negligence and abandonment of his duties as a finance officer
rather than of diligence expected of an officer of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines. It is indeed regrettable that the defendant now has to suffer
the consequence of his subordinate’s wrongdoing. The defendant did not
enjoy even a single centavo of the amount malversed. But Article 217 of the
Penal Code is very clear and definite and (the Court] cannot do otherwise
but apply its provisions.

In malversation not committed through negligence, lack of criminal
intent or good faith is a defense.

The total of the remittances made from June 1951, up to September
1963, amounted to P72,265.51, and the total amount actually received by the

When an accountable public officer makes a wrong payment
through honest mistake as to the law or to the facts concerning his
duties, he is not liable for malversation. He is only civilly liable.
Thus, a municipal officer, who in good faith paid out of public
funds, persons in accordance with the resolution of the municipal
council, but the payments were made in violation of the law, because
of insufficient vouchers or improper evidence, is only civilly liable,
here being no criminal intent. (See People v. Elvina, 24 Phil. 230;
U.S. v. Catolico, 18 Phil. 504)
Full liquidation of cash advance by means of an arrangement
allowed by the COA was also held to translate into good faith and a
legal avoidance of violation of Art. 218. (Panganiban v. People, supra)

536

537

The first and second remittances were made personally by Lieutenant
Torres in June and August 1951. However, subsequent remittances from
September, 1951, up to September, 1953, were exclusively made by Sergeant
De la Cruz upon orders issued by Lieutenant Torres who said that “due to
the volume of my work and the trust I have on him, I gave him authority to
make payments.”

Art. 217

TITLE SEVEN

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Crimes Committed By Public Officers

Presumption of malversation.

The failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any public
funds or property with which he is chargeable, upon demand by any
duly authorized officer, shall be prima facie evidence that he has put
such missing funds or property to personal uses.

Article 217, as amended, no longer requires proof by the State
that the accused actually appropriated, took, or misappropriated public
funds or property. Instead, a presumption, though disputable and
rebuttable, was installed that upon demand by any duly authorized
officer, the failure of a public officer to have duly forthcoming any
public funds or property with which said officer is accountable
should be prima facie evidence that he had put such missing funds
or properties to personal use. When these circumstances are present,
a “presumption of law” arises that there was malversation of public
funds or properties as decreed by Article 217. A “presumption of
law” is sanctioned by a statute prescribing that “a certain inference
must be made whenever facts appear which furnish the basis of the
interference.” This is to be set apart from a “presumption of fact”
which is a “[conclusion] drawn from particular circumstances, the
connection between them and the sought for fact having received such
a sanction in experience as to have become recognized as justifying
the assumption.” [II V. Francisco, Criminal Evidence 1448 (1947))
When there is a presumption of law, the onus probandi (burden of
proof), generally imposed upon the State, is now shifted to the party
against whom the interference is made to adduce satisfactory evidence
to rebut the presumption and hence, to demolish the prima facie case.
(W a-aeon v. People, G.R. No. 164575, December 6, 2006)

Examples:

1. After the government auditors discovered the shortage and
informed petitioner of the same, petitioner failed to properly explain or
justify the shortage that was subject to her accountability. Petitioner
denied that she put the amount involved to personal use and
presented various sales invoice, chits, vale forms, and disbursement
voucher to prove her claim. Petitioner even went further by testifying
that the total amount of P681,000.00 appearing in a disbursement
voucher were cash advances given to the mayor during the height
of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption. However, the date when the eruption
occurred was way before the period subject of the audit. It was held
that petitioner’s failure to present competent and credible evidence
538

that would exculpate her and rebut the prima facie presumption of
malversation clearly warranted a verdict of conviction. (Legrama v.

accountable public officer is prima facie evidence of their conversion.

(People v. Velasco, CA-G.R. No. 2546-R, November 8, 1948)
4.

An accountable public officer may be convicted of

malversation even if there is no direct evidence of misappropriation

and the only evidence is that there is a shortage in his accounts
which he has not been able to explain satisfactorily. (People v.
Mingoa, 92 Phil. 856; De Guzman v. People, 119 SCRA 337; Quizo v.
Sandiganbayan, 149 SCRA 108)
The presumption may be rebutted.

The presumption of malversation under said Article 217 of
the Code is merely prima facie and rebuttable; and, in line with
the cases of Villacorta v. People, et al., 145 SCRA 425, and Quizo v.
Sandiganbayan, et al., 149 SCRA 108, the presumption is deemed
overthrown if the accountable public officer satisfactorily proves that
not a single centavo of the missing funds was used by him for his
personal interest but that the funds were extended as cash advances to
co-employees in good faith, in the belief that they were for legitimate
purposes, with no intent to gain and out of goodwill considering that
it was a practice tolerated in the office. (Cabello v. Sandiganbayan,
GJi. No. 93885, May 14, 1991)

Funds not used for personal purposes.
In Villacorta v. People, supra, the accused successfully

rebutted the prima facie evidence of his misappropriation. The
cash in accused’s possession was found short of what he should
have had because of the disallowance by the Audit Team of
certain items. Those items comprising the alleged shortage
were paid to government personnel either as wages, travelling
expenses, salaries, living allowances, commutations of leave,
539

Art. 217

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

terminal leaves and for supplies. Accused did not put such
missing funds to personal uses. Proof of that being that when
he demanded payment from those officials and personnel
they redeemed their chits and made restitution. At the time of
the audit, the accused had an actual balance deposit with the
provincial treasurer in the sum of P64.661.75.

In Quizo v. Sandiganbayan, supra, the accused incurred
a shortage in the total sum of P17.421.74 because the audit
team disallowed P16.720.00 in cash advances he granted to
some employees, P700.00 representing accommodated private
checks, and an actual cash shortage of Pl.74. On the same day
when the audit was conducted, P406.18 was reimbursed by the
accused, PIO,515.56 three days thereafter and the balance of
P6,500.00 another three days later. The Court held that the
accused successfully overthrew the presumption of guilt. He
satisfactorily proved that not a single centavo of the missing
funds was used by him for his own personal interest. The
bulk of the reported shortage actually referred to the items
disallowed by the Audit Team representing cash advances
extended to co-employees. In fact, evidence disclosed that the
itemized list of the cash advances was verified and found to
be correct by an Auditing Examiner. Accused explained that
the granting of the cash advances was done in good faith,
with no intent to gain and borne out of goodwill considering
that it was a practice tolerated in the office. Such being the
case, negligence evidentiary of malice or intent to defraud the
government cannot be imputed to him. Also to be considered is
the circumstance that the actual cash shortage was only Pl.74
which, together with the disallowed items, was fully restituted
within a reasonable time from date of audit.
In Madarang u. People, G.R. No. 112314, March 28,
2001, Petitioner was also able to nullify the inference that
he did put the missing funds to his personal use. After it was
allegedly discovered that petitioner received advance rentals
of P20.700, he presented resolutions passed by the Barangay
Council appropriating a total of P8,400 to be paid to suppliers
of materials for the water system of the barangay hall and for
the barangay police uniforms. Notably, the lease agreement
between Barangay Pahina Central represented by petitioner
as the barangay captain thereof, and Mrs. Dora M. Lim, was
640

TITLE SEVEN

Art. 217

executed for the purpose of raising funds for the operations of

the Barangay Tanods and the installation of a water system in
the barangay hall.
Petitioner did not also receive the P20.700 all in cash
owing to the deduction from the rentals due of P12.300 by Mrs.
Lim to cover the cost of medicines advanced to the barangay
residents and tanods. Collection notices were even in fact
sent to those with unpaid accounts. Verily, petitioner cannot
be faulted, much less convicted, in consequence. Petitioner’s
act of guaranteeing the payment thereof in order to assist
his constituents who are in dire need of medicines but lack
financial capacity to pay therefore was done in good faith
under the belief that he was acting correctly for the good of
the residents in his community. (Madarang v. People, G.R. No.
112314, March 28, 2001)

Funds were lost or stolen.
The presumption could be overcome by satisfactory
evidence of loss or robbery committed by a person other than
the accused. (U.S. v. Kalingo, supra)
The accused, disbursing officer at the Region VIII Office
of the Ministry of Public Works and Highways was charged
with malversation of PhP26,404.26, representing the salaries
of the personnel in her office. The accused was able to show
that the cash was lost when she suffered a stroke while on
the way to her office. This was corroborated by the barangay
captain of the place where she suffered a stroke, as well as
medical certificates to prove the illness. Accused was acquitted
because the loss of funds was not due to malversation. (Agullo
v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 132926, July 20, 2001, 361 SCRA
556)

The accused, as municipal president of Palo, Leyte, was
prosecuted for malversation after being unable to turn over

certain amounts to the then justice of the peace. It appeared
that said amounts were actually collected by his secretary
Crisanto Urbina. The Court reversed Acebedo’s conviction
after finding that the sums were converted by his secretary
541

Art. 217

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Urbina without the knowledge and participation of Acebedo. It
held: “No conspiracy between the appellant and his secretary
has been shown in this case, nor did such conspiracy appear
in the case against Urbina. No guilty knowledge of the theft
committed by the secretary was shown on the part of the
appellant in this case, nor does it appear that he in any way
participated in the fruits of the crime. If the secretary stole
the money in question without the knowledge or consent of the
appellant and without negligence on his part, then certainly
the latter can not be convicted of embezzling the same money
or any part thereof." (U.S. u Acebedo, 18 Phil. Rep. 428)
Money presented upon demand.

If at the very moment when the shortage is discovered, the
accountable officer is notified thereof and he at once presents
the money, no prima facie evidence of the crime of malversation
can be established.
A deputy auditor testified that on the 20th of May 1908, he
went to the municipality of San Pedro, Macati for the purpose
of making an inspection of the office, cash, and accounts of the
municipal treasury of said town, of which Mariano Feliciano
was the treasurer; that there resulted from the examination a
shortage ofP53.05 in the cash of the municipal treasury; that at
the moment when the difference was discovered he notified the
treasurer of it, and the latter took the sum of P53.05 from his
pocket and paid it, but he did not remember, however, whether
he had questioned the treasurer as to why the amount was not
in the safe; and that, at the time when the examination was
made, there were other persons present, to wit, the municipal
president and the municipal secretary.

Held: If, according to the officer who made the examination
of the accounts, at the very moment when the shortage of
P53.05 was discovered and the treasurer was notified he at
once presented the money, no prima facie evidence of the crime
of misappropriation can be established, nor any proof whatever
that there was such misappropriation. (U.S. v. Feliciano, 15

Obedience to lawful order.
Facts: Tabuena, General Manager of Manila International

Airport Authority (MIAA), was instructed over the phone by
then President Marcos to pay directly to the President’s office
and in cash what the MIAA owes the Philippine National
Construction Corporation (PNCC). About a week later,
Tabuena received a Presidential Memorandum dated January
8, 1986 (MARCOS Memorandum) reiterating such verbal
instruction, directing the payment of P55 Million in cash as
partial payment of MIAA’s account with PNCC. In obedience
to President Marcos’ verbal instruction and memorandum,
Tabuena and Perez caused the release of P55 Million of
MIAA funds by means of three (3) withdrawals. Tabuena
and Perez were charged with malversation for taking and
misappropriating P55 Million from MIAA funds purportedly
as partial payment to the PNCC, when both knew that there
was no outstanding obligation of MIAA in favor of PNCC, and
for encashing the checks and misappropriating and converting
the proceeds thereof to their personal use and benefit.

Held: Tabuena had no other choice but to make the
withdrawals, for that was what the MARCOS Memorandum
required him to do. He could not be faulted if he had to obey
and strictly comply with the presidential directive. Marcos
was undeniably Tabuena’s superior the former being then
the President of the Republic who unquestionably exercised
control over government agencies such as the MIAA and
PNCC. The MARCOS Memorandum is patently legal (for
on its face it directs payment of an outstanding liability) and
Tabuena acted under the honest belief that the P55 million was
a due and demandable debt and that it was just a portion of a
bigger liability to PNCC. Tabuena is entitled to the justifying
circumstance of “Any person who acts in obedience to an order
issued by a superior for some lawful purpose." (Tabuena v.
Sandiganbayan, GJl. Nos. 103501-03, February 17, 1997)

and if the fact that funds are missing is indubitably established. In
the instant case, the audit team leader could not even equivocally
state whether it was cash or check that was lost, if at all there was
any, belying the accuracy and correctness of the team’s audit report
(Enriquez v. People, G.R. No. 119239, May 9, 2000)

In this case, it was only during the trial that the accused returned
the property to the government. (Cimafranca, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan,
GJi- No. 94408, February 14, 1991)

The prima facie presumption of malversation under Article
217 of the Revised Penal Code can not hold in view of the reasonable
doubt that the petitioner-accused appropriated the amount still
unaccounted for, if indeed there still remain funds unaccounted for.
(Rizon v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 91271, October 3, 1991)

Payment or reimbursement is not a defense but may be considered
a mitigating circumstance.

Payment or reimbursement is not a defense for exoneration in
malversation; it may only be considered as a mitigating circumstance.
This is because damage is not an element of malversation.

It bears stressing that the full restitution of the amount
malversed will not in any way exonerate an accused, as payment
is not one of the elements of extinction of criminal liability. Under
the law, the refund of the sum misappropriated, even before the
commencement of the criminal prosecution, does not exempt the
guilty person from liability for the crime. (U.S. v. Reyes, 14 Phil. 718
[1910]) At most, then, payment of the amount malversed will only
serve as a mitigating circumstance akin to voluntary surrender, as
provided for in paragraph 7 of Article 13 in relation to paragraph 10
of the same Article of the R.P.C. (Perez v. People, G.R. No. 164763,
February 12, 2008)

Illustration'.
When his books were examined by the auditor, the assistant
cashier in the provincial treasury could not produce the amount. Later,
the assistant cashier offered to and did actually return the money.
Held: The return of the money was merely a mitigating
circumstance. It cannot exempt him from criminal liability. (People
v. Velasquez, 72 Phil. 98)
However, when it took petitioner several years before he returned
the government property, such circumstance cannot be considered a
special mitigating circumstance analogous to voluntary surrender.
644

Borrowing money to replace missing funds — when not malversation.

The fact that the amount in cash which a municipal treasurer

should have in his cafe was fully covered by an amount borrowed
from one of his clerks does not relieve the said treasurer from criminal
responsibility. As he did not explain satisfactorily why the amount
which should be in his hands was in his clerk’s possession, the
presumption is that he misappropriated the missing amount. (People
v. Divino, CA-G.R. No. 428, October 13, 1938)
But when the accountable officer is obliged to go out of his office
and borrow the sum alleged to be the shortage and later the missing
amount is found in some unaccustomed place in his office, he is not
liable for malversation. (U.S. v. Pascual, 26 Phil. 234)
Demand not necessary in malversation.

Previous demand is not necessary. The last paragraph of Article
217 provides only for a rule of procedural law, a rule of evidence and
no more. (People v. Tolentino, 69 Phil. 715)

Demand merely raises a prima facie presumption that missing
hinds have been put to personal use. The demand itself, however, is
not an element of, and not indispensable to constitute malversation.
(Morong Water District v. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman, G.R.
No. 116754, March 17, 2000, citing Nizurtada v. Sandiganbayan,
239 SCRA 33)
May a person whose negligence made possible the commission of

malversation by another be held liable as principal by indispensable
cooperation in the complex crime of malversation through falsification

of a public document by reckless negligence?

The Supreme Court in the case of Javier, et al. u. People, 105

Phil. 1294, ruled in the affirmative. In that case, the charge against

certain audit clerks was that, through their recklessly negligent
participation in the preparation of the falsified payrolls, they had,
in effect, cooperated with their co-defendant paymaster in the
commission of the crime of malversation of public funds. It was held

regulation requiring him to render account.

Nowhere in Art. 218 does it require that there first be a demand
before an accountable officer is held liable for a violation of the
crime. The law is very clear. Where none is provided, the court may
not introduce exceptions or conditions, neither may it engraft into
the law qualifications not contemplated. Where the law is clear and
unambiguous, it must be taken to mean exactly what it says and the
court has no choice but to see to it that its mandate is obeyed. There
is no room for interpretation, but only application.
Where a COA circular requires cash advances for petty operating
expenses and field operating expenses to be liquidated within 20
days after the end of the year and accused received the cash advance
sometime in 1994, he was required to liquidate the same on or before
January 20, 1995. Further, to avoid liability under Article 218, he
should have liquidated the cash advance within two months from the
time it was due, or on or before March 20, 1995. Since the accused
liquidated the cash advance only on June 4, 2001, accused is liable
for violation of Article 218 because it took him over six years before
settling his accounts. (Lumauig v. People, G.R. No. 166680, July 7,

That he applies the same to a public use other than that for
which such fund or property has been appropriated by law or
ordinance.

There is no technical malversation if there is no law or ordinance
appropriating public funds or property for a particular purpose.

The Court has unequivocably ruled in Parungao v. Sandiganbayan,
G.R. No. 96025, May 15, 1991, that in the absence of a law or ordinance
appropriating the public fund allegedly technically malversed (in that
case, the absence of any law or ordinance appropriating the CRBI
fund for the concreting of Barangay Jalung Road), the use thereof for
another public purpose (there, for the payment of wages of laborers
working on projects other than the Barangay Jalung Road) will
not make the accused guilty of violation of Article 220 of the R.P.C.
(Abdulla v. People, G.R. No. 150129, April 6, 2005)

The public funds or property must be appropriated by law or
ordinance for a particular purpose.

The resolution of the authorities of the Mindanao Agricultural
college, a public entity, that the amounts paid by the students, to
answer for the payment of the instruments or equipment broken by
them, should be later refunded, nowhere implied that the repayment
was to be made precisely out of the money received, and as the refund
could be made out of any available funds of the college, there was
no appropriation for a particular purpose that was violated by the
accused. (People v. Montemayor, et al., G.R. No. L-17449, August 30,
1962)

Can the accused be held liable for malversation under Article
217, if the funds applied to a public use are not appropriated by law
or ordinance?
Yes. That is appropriating public funds under Article 217,
because he disposed of the same without right.
Example of illegal use of public funds.

When the school teachers and other municipal officers were
unable to receive their salaries because the treasurer applied the

funds, appropriated from the payment of said salaries, to another
public use, there is detriment and hindrance to the public service.
(U.S. v. Ejercito, 6 Phil. 80)

Criminal intent is not an element of technical malversation.
Criminal intent is not an element of technical malversation. The

law punishes the act of diverting public property earmarked by law or

ordinance for a particular public purpose to another public purpose.
The offense is mala prohibita, meaning that the prohibited act is not
inherently immoral but becomes a criminal offense because positive
law forbids its commission based on considerations of public policy,
order, and convenience. It is the commission of an act as defined
by the law, and not the character or effect thereof, that determines
whether or not the provision has been violated. Hence, malice or
criminal intent is completely irrelevant. (Ysidoro v. People, GJl. No.
192330, November 14, 2012)
Illegal use of public funds or property distinguished from
malversation under Article 217.
(1)

The offenders are accountable public officers in both crimes.

(2)

The offender in illegal use of public funds or property does not
derive any personal gain or profit; in malversation, the offender
in certain cases profits from the proceeds of the crime.

(3)

In illegal use, the public fund or property is applied to another
public use\ in malversation, the public fund or property is
applied to the personal use and benefit of the offender or of
another person.

Technical malversation is not included in nor does it necessarily
include the crime of malversation of public funds.
A comparison of Article 217 and Article 220 reveals that their
elements are entirely distinct and different from the other. In

malversation of public funds, the offender misappropriates public
funds for his own personal use or allows any other person to tale such

public funds for the latter’s personal use. In technical malversation,
the public officer applies public funds under his administration not
for his or another’s personal use, but to a public use other than that

for which the fund was appropriated by law or ordinance. Technical
malversation is, therefore, not included in nor does it necessarily
include the crime of malversation of public funds charged in the
information. Since the acts constituting the crime of technical
malversation were not alleged in the information, and since technical
malversation does not include, or is not necessarily included in the
crime of malversation of public funds, he cannot resultantly be
convicted of technical malversation. (Parungao v. Sandiganbayan

Private Individual liable for malversation.
U.S. v. Rastrollo
(1 Phil. 22)
Facts: In civil proceedings to obtain a preventive attachment to secure a
debt contracted by accused Rastrollo, then a defendant, 1121 ft. of hose, among
other properties belonging to said Rastrollo, was attached. The attached
property remained in the possession of Rastrollo who, with the consent of
the attorney for the plaintiff, sold the same to the Manila Fire Department
Rastrollo failed to deliver the proceeds of the sale to the attorney for the
plaintiff immediately after selling the hose, and deposited the proceeds of
the sale in court after four months following the day the complaint was filed
against him for embezzlement. (Estafa)
Held: If the acts with which the accused is charged constitute a crime
whatever, it would be that of malversation of property attached by judicial
order. The act could not be regarded as constituting estafa, because the
property alleged to have been misapplied was not the subject of a mere
private bailment but of a judicial deposit. This gives the depository a character
equivalent to that of a public official, and breach of his obligation is similar
to the violation of the obligations imposed by public office.

Sheriffs and receivers fall under the term “administrator.”

The words “administrator" and “depository* include the sheriffs
and receivers. Thus, if they misappropriate money or property under
their custody, they are liable for malversation.

Judicial administrator not covered by this article.

The word “administrator” here used does not include judicial
administrator appointed to administer the estate of a deceased person,
because he is not in charge of any property attached, impounded or
placed in deposit by public authority.

Conversion of effects in his trust makes him liable for estafa.

TITLE SEVEN
Crimes Committed By Public Officers

The private individual under Article 222 is not deemed a public
officer.
The language of Article 222 is clear. A private individual who
has in his charge any of the public funds or property enumerated
therein and commits any of the acts defined in any of the provisions of
Chapter Four, Title Seven of the R.P.C., should likewise be penalized
with the same penalty meted to erring public officers. Nowhere in this
provision is it expressed or implied that a private individual falling
under said Article 222 is to be deemed a public officer. (Azarcon v.
Sandiganbayan, supra)
The Sandiganbayan has no jurisdiction over a private individual
if the individual is not charged as co-prlncipal, accomplice, or
accessory to a public officer.
Facts: Petitioner, a private individual, was designated by the Bureau
of Internal Revenue as a custodian of distrained property. When the owner
of the property surreptitiously took the distrained property from petitioner’s
custody, petitioner was charged with malversation of public property.

Held: Section 4 of P.D. No. 1606 unequivocally specifies the only
instances when the Sandiganbayan will have jurisdiction over a private
individual, ie., when the complaint charges the private individual either as
a co-principal, accomplice or accessory of a public officer or employee who
has been charged with a crime within its jurisdiction. The Information does
not charge petitioner of being a co-principal, accomplice or accessory to a
public officer committing an offense under the Sandiganbayan’s jurisdiction.
Petitioner did not cease to be a private individual when he agreed to act as
depositary of the garnished dump truck. Therefore, when the information
charged him and Jaime Ancla before the Sandiganbayan for malversation
of public funds or property, the prosecution was in fact charging two private
individuals without any public officer being similarly charged as a co¬
conspirator. Consequently, the Sandiganbayan had no jurisdiction over the
controversy, (Azarcon u. Sandiganbayan, GJi. No. 116033, February 26, 1997)

Private property is included, provided it is (1) attached, (2) seized,
or (3) deposited by public authority.

The expression, “even if such property belongs to a private
individual,” is a sweeping and all embracing statement so as to
include a case where private funds or property are involved, as long
as such funds or property are placed in the custody of accountable
public officers. (People v. De la Serna, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 12, 159)

Escape of prisoner under the custody of a person not a

Art. 223

1.

That the offender is a public officer.

2.

That he had in his custody or charge, a prisoner, either
detention prisoner or prisoner by final judgment.

3.

That such prisoner escaped from his custody.

4.

That he was in connivance with the prisoner in the latter’s
escape. (U.S. v. Bandino, 29 Phil. 459)

Act constituting the crime.

Article 223 punishes any public officer who shall consent to the
escape of a prisoner in his custody or charge. Connivance with the
prisoner (agreement between the prisoner and the public officer) in
his escape is an indispensable element of the offense. (U.S. v. Bandino,
29 Phil. 459)

In order to be guilty under Article 223, it is necessary that
the public officer had consented to, or connived in, the escape of the
prisoner under his custody or charge. Connivance in the escape of a
prisoner on the part of the person in charge is an essential condition
in the commission of the crime of faithlessness in the custody of the
prisoner. If the public officer charged with the duty of guarding him
does not connive with the fugitive, then he has not violated the law
and is not guilty of the crime. (Alberto v. de la Cruz, GJi. No. L-31839,
June 30, 1980, citing U.S. v. Bandino, 29 Phil. 459)
A policeman who allowed a prisoner under his guard to go
and buy some cigarettes at a nearby store, thereby making possible
the escape of the prisoner, is not in connivance with the latter, the
policeman not knowing that he would escape.

may not have fled. (U.S. v. Bandino, 29 Phil. 459)

b.

If the fugitive is held only as detention prisoner for any crime
or violation of law or municipal ordinance.

The offense defined in Article 223 includes a case where the guard
allowed the prisoner, serving a six-day sentence in the municipal jail,
to sleep in his house and eat there because the municipality had no
outlay for the food of prisoners. (See People v. Revilla, CA., 37 O.G.

A detention prisoner is a person in legal custody, arrested for, and
charged with, some crime or public offense.
Thus, where a driver of a truck, driving without license, met
an accident and was taken to the hospital and, while being guarded
by a policeman, he escaped, the policeman is not liable for infidelity
in the custody of prisoner, because the driver who was not actually
arrested was not a detention prisoner. The information against the
driver for driving without license was filed in the Baguio Municipal
Court two days after his escape. (People v. Liong, CA., 47 O.G. 1321)

Release of detention prisoner who could not be delivered to the
judicial authority within the time fixed by law, is not infidelity in the
custody of prisoner.

Thus, where the chief of police released the detention prisoners,
because he could not file a complaint against them within the time
fixed in Article 125, due to the absence of the justice of the peace,
he is not guilty of infidelity in the custody of prisoners. (People v.

1896)

The mayor is guilty under Article 223, if he utilized the prisoner’s
services for domestic chores in his house, including that of working
as a cook. (See People v. Evangelista, CA., 38 O.G. 158)
Infidelity in the Custody of Detained Persons under R.A. No. 9372.
Any public officer who has direct custody of a detained person
or under the provisions of R.A. No. 9372 and who by deliberate act,
misconduct, or inexcusable negligence causes or allows the escape
of such detained person shall be guilty of an offense and shall suffer
the penalty of (a) 12 years and 1 day to 20 years of imprisonment, if
the detained person has already been convicted and sentenced in a
final judgment of a competent court; and (b) 6 years and 1 day to 12
years imprisonment, if the detained person has not been convicted
and sentenced in a final judgment of a competent court. (Sec. 44)

Lancanan, 95 Phil. 375)

Leniency or laxity is not infidelity.

During his detention, the prisoner was allowed to eat in a
restaurant near the municipal building. During the town fiesta, the

municipal president acceded to the prisoner’s request for permission
to eat better meals in his house. On all these occasions, the prisoner
was duly guarded.

Art, 224. Evasion through negligence. If the evasion of

of the officer charged with the conveyance or custody

correccional in its minimum period6 and temporary special

Held: This is only leniency or laxity in the performance of duty,
not in excess of his duties. (People v. Evangelista, CA., 38 O.G. 158)

2.

either detention prisoner or prisoner by final judgment.

Yes. In the cases of People v. Solis, supra, and People v. Flosa,
supra, the persons who escaped were merely detention prisoners.

3.

That such prisoner escapes through his negligence.

What is punished in evasion through negligence is such a definite
laxity as all but amounts to deliberate non-performance of duty on
the part of the guard.

Illustration of absence of second element:

C was detailed as prison guard from 9:00 to 11:00 in the evening
S was to succeed C from 11:00 of the same evening until 1:00 the
following morning. When the time came for S to take over his duty
at 11:00, he was sleeping; so C woke him up to deliver the post to
him. S did not pay attention, refused to be bothered and continued
to sleep. A prisoner escaped while C was the one in the guard post.
Is S liable? No. The custody of the prisoner was not yet transferred
to him by C when the evasion took place. (People v. Silvosa, CA-G.R.
No. 12736-R, April 30, 1955)
Illustration of absence of third element:

A policeman was on guard duty. He unlocked the door of the jail
to let a detention prisoner go out to clean the premises of the police
headquarters. The prisoner went to a nearby faucet to wash the
rags. Upon his third trip to the faucet, he walked behind the police
headquarters, climbed over the wall and escaped. Is the policeman
liable? No. The policeman was not negligent. Not every little mistake
or distraction of a guard leading to prisoner’s escape is negligence
under Article 224. (People v. Solis, CA., 43 O.G. 580)
Also, a policeman who was to escort a detention prisoner and
left his charge to the patron of the boat to get certain papers, but
the boat left with the prisoner who later escaped, is not liable under
Article 224. (People v. Flosa, CA., 47 O.G. 2452)

Not every negligence or distraction of a guard is penalized;
it is only that positive carelessness that is short of deliberate non¬
performance of his duties as guard that is the gravamen of the crime of
infidelity under Article 224. (People v. Reyes, et al., CA, 59 O.G. 6664)
Rodillas v. Sandiganbayan
(G.R. No. L-58652, May 20, 1988)

Facts: Accused was a policeman who was assigned to escort Zenaida
Andres, a detention prisoner, from the city jail to the CFI of Caloocan. After
the hearing of the case, accused consented to the request of Zenaida’s husband
to allow them to have lunch. After eating, accused accompanied Zenaida and
a lady companion to the ladies’ room as Zenaida needed to relieve herself.
Zenaida and her lady companion entered the comfort room, while he stood
guard along the alley near the ladies’ comfort room facing the door. Not long
after, the lady companion came out of the comfort room and told him that
she was going to buy sanitary napkins for Zenaida as the latter was then
bleeding and had a menstruation and could not go out of the comfort room.
After ten minutes elapsed without the lady companion coming back, the
accused became suspicious and entered the comfort room. To his surprise,
he found Zenaida no longer inside the comfort room. He noticed that the
window of said comfort room was not provided with window grills. He tried
to peep out of the window by stepping on the flush tank and noticed that
outside of the window there was a concrete eave extending down to the
ground floor of the building which he presumed that Zenaida might have
used as a passage.

The opening sentence of Article 224 states, “If the evasion of
the prisoner shall have taken place.” Under Article 157, defining
and penalizing evasion of service of sentence, the prisoner must be a
convict by final judgment.

Held: It is the duty of any police officer having custody of a prisoner
to take necessary precautions to assure the absence of any means of escape.
A failure to undertake these precautions will make his act one of definite
laxity or negligence amounting to deliberate non-performance of duty. His
tolerance of arrangements whereby the prisoner and her companions could
plan and make good her escape should have aroused the suspicion of a person
of ordinary prudence.

“If the evasion of the prisoner shall have taken place.”

Art. 224

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The request for lunch and the consequent delay was an opportunity for
the prisoner to learn of a plan or to carry out an earlier plan by which she
could escape. The plan was in fact carried out with the help of the lady who
accompanied his prisoner inside the comfort room. The use of a toilet is one
of the most familiar and common place methods of escape. It is inconceivable
that a police officer should fall for this trick. The arrangement with a lady
friend should have aroused the petitioner’s suspicion because the only
pretext given by the petitioner was that she was going to answer the call of
nature. It was, therefore, unnecessary for her to be accompanied by anyone
especially by someone who was not urgently in need of a toilet if the purpose
was merely to relieve herself. Despite this, the petitioner allowed the two
to enter the comfort room without first establishing for himself that there
was no window or door allowing the possibility of escape. He even allowed
the prisoner’s companion to leave the premises with the excuse that the
prisoner was having her monthly period and that there was a need to buy
sanitary napkins. And he patiently waited for more than ten minutes for the
companion to return. This was patent negligence and incredible naivety on
the part of the police officer.

TITLE SEVEN

Crimes Committed By Public Officers

There is only one penalty in Article 224.
If the prisoner escapes through the negligence of the public
officer, the latter suffers the same penalty regardless of whether the
prisoner is a convict or merely a detention prisoner.
The fact that the public officer recaptured the prisoner who had
escaped from his custody does not afford complete exculpation.

The circumstance that the appellant by himself and without help
from other peace officers immediately went in pursuit of the escapee
and did not rest until he recaptured him three days later is not such
a circumstance as to afford complete exculpation. (People v. Quisel,
CA., 52 O.G. 6975)
Liability of escaping prisoner

1.

If the fugitive is serving sentence by reason of final judgment,
he is liable for evasion of the service of the sentence under
Article 157.

2.

If the fugitive is only a detention prisoner, he does not incur
criminal liability.

Examples of infidelity through negligence:

1.

A policeman who, assigned to guard a prisoner, falls asleep,
with the result that the prisoner escapes, is guilty of negligence
in the custody of a prisoner. (People v. Guiab, G.R. No. 39631,
May 6, 1934)

2.

The guard in permitting the prisoner, who later escaped, to
go to the nursery to gather gabi, considering that the place
was grassy and tall talahib was growing therein, was liable
for infidelity in the custody of prisoners through negligence
because the guard must have seen immediately that it was as
it had been a choice place for any prisoner who may want to
escape. (People v. Lagata, 83 Phil. 159)
The accused contended that his order to the prisoner to keep
close to him while he was answering the telephone call was
sufficient precaution under the circumstances.
Held: Untenable. The adequate precaution which should
have been taken by him was to lock up the prisoner before
answering the telephone call. (Remocal v. People, 71 Phil. 429)

Escape of person under arrest while in the custody of private

individual.

While in infidelity in the custody of prisoners committed by
public officers (Arts. 223 and 224) the Code speaks of “prisoner," m
the escape of prisoner under the custody of a person not a public
officer (Art. 225), the Code mentions also "person under arrest’ whose
conveyance or custody must be confided to the offender.

Article 225 is not applicable if a private person was the one
who made the arrest and he consented to the escape of the person
he arrested.
The penalty for a private person liable under Article 225 is only
imprisonment one degree lower than that prescribed for the public
officer in Article 223 or Article 224.

There is no penalty “next lower in degree than” perpetual or
temporary special disqualification, prescribed for public officer, in

Only public officers who have been officially entrusted with the
documents or papers can be held liable under Article 226.
Thus, the stenographer who removes or destroys the record of a
case kept by the clerk of court is not guilty of a violation of Article 226
because the stenographer is not officially entrusted with the

record’

The public officer who is officially entrusted with the record is
the clerk of court.
The document must be complete and one by which a right could be
established or an obligation could be extinguished.

Thus, the municipal president who, in a fit of anger, mutilated
the payroll of the town, is not guilty of infidelity in the custody of
document by destroying it, it appearing that said payroll had not
yet been approved and signed by him, as required by law. (People v.
Camacho, 44 Phil. 484)
Books, periodicals, pamphlets, etc., are not documents.

A package containing a book, sent through mail by C.O.D.
System, is not a document, so that a postmaster who removes the same
does not violate this provision. A document is a written instrument
by which something is proven or made of record. (People v. Agnis, 47
Phil. 945)
“Or papers officially entrusted to him.”

Under this article, not only documents but also papers may be
involved. The word “papers” includes checks, promissory notes, and
paper money. (Webster’s Dictionary)
Thus, a postmaster to whom a letter containing paper money
was delivered to be forwarded by registered mail, opened said letter
and abstracted money orders, or the money bills enclosed therein, was
held guilty of faithlessness in the custody of papers. (U.S. v. Gorospe,
31 Phil. 285; U.S. v. Filoteo, 14 Phil. 73; U.S. v. De Toro, 15 Phil. 181;
U.S. v. Misola, 14 Phil. 142; U.S. v. Marino, 10 Phil. 652)

666

Art. 226

letters to their destination is guilty of infidelity in the custody of

papers.

The simple act of retaining the mail without forwarding the
letters to their destination, even though without opening them or
taking the moneys they contained, already constitutes infidelity on
the part of the post office official. (U.S. v. Marino, 10 Phil. 652; U.S.
u. Pena, 12 Phil. 362)
Infidelity In the custody of document, distinguished from
malversation and falsification.

When the postmaster received money orders, signed the
signatures of the payees thereon, collected and appropriated the
respective amounts thereof, the postmaster is guilty of malversation
and falsification, the latter crime having been committed to conceal

the malversation. (People u. Villanueva, 58 Phil. 672; People v.
Oaralde, 52 Phil. 1000) But when the postmaster receives letters or
envelopes containing money orders for transmission, and the money
orders are not sent to the addressees, the postmaster cashing the same
for his own benefit, he is guilty of infidelity in the custody of papers.
Reason why taking contents of mail by postmaster is infidelity In
the custody of documents or papers.

In addition to the actual injury done to the owner, the uncertainty
as to the safety of such letters arising from thefts of their contents
amounts to a real and positive injury to the postal service and, hence,
to the public interests. (U.S. v. Mariho, 10 Phil. 652)
Liability of person other than an officer or employee of the Bureau
of Posts.
Section 2756 of the Revised Administrative Code punishes the
unlawful opening or detention of mail matter by any person other than
an officer or employee of the Bureau of Posts, by a fine of not more
than Pl,000 or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.
If the culprit is an officer or employee of the Bureau of Posts,

Article 226 is applicable. (U.S. v. Santos, 37 Phil. 453)
667

Art. 226

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Money bills received as exhibits in court are papers.

A deputy clerk of court who, having received in his official
capacity several notes or paper money as exhibits in a case, afterward
took away the said money is guilty of this crime, because the money
bills are papers used as exhibits. (People v. Abraham, G.R. No. 17628
February 17, 1922)
Acts punishable in infidelity in the custody of documents:

1.

By removing, or

2.

By destroying, or

3.

By concealing, documents or papers officially entrusted to the
offending public officer.

It is not necessary that the act of removal must be coupled with
proof of intention to conceal. The word “or” is a disassociation and
independence of one thing from each of the other things mentioned.
While in the interpretation of statutes, ‘or’ may be read “and’ and
vice versa, it is so only when the context so requires. (Kataniag v.
People, 74 Phil. 45)
Accordingly, removal, destruction, and concealment must be
viewed as distinct modes of committing the offense.
The removal must be for illicit purpose.

To warrant a finding of guilt for the crime of infidelity in the
custody of documents, the act of removal, as a mode of committing
the offense, should be coupled with criminal intent or illicit purpose.
(Manzanaris v. People, 127 SCRA 201)
Thus, where the act of removal is actuated with lawful or
commendable motives, as when documents are removed from
their usual place to secure them from imminent danger of loss or
destruction, there would be no crime committed.

The removal is for an illicit purpose when the intention of the
offender is —
(a)

to tamper with it, or

(b)

to profit by it, or

TITLE SEVEN
Crimes Committed By Public Officers
(c)

to commit an act constituting a breach of trust in the official

care thereof. (Kataniag v. People, supra)

When deemed consummated.
The crime of removal of public document in breach of official
trust is consummated upon its removal or secreting away from its
usual place in the office and after the offender had gone out and locked
the door, it being immaterial whether he has or has not actually
accomplished the illicit purpose for which he removed said document.
(Kataniag v. People, supra)
Infidelity in the custody of document by destroying or concealing
it, does not require proof of Illicit purpose.

The reason for this opinion is that while in the removal of
documents, the accused may have a lawful or commendable motive,

in destroying or concealing them, the offender could not have a good
motive.
Delivering document to the wrong party is infidelity in the custody
thereof.

Thus, an emergency helper on a daily wage basis in the Bureau
of Treasury, who, being entrusted with the delivery of official papers to
the different sections and divisions of the bureau, delivered a backpay
certificate to a wrong party, instead of returning it to the releasing
clerk after it was signed by the Treasurer, with the result that the
owner thereof could not make withdrawal on his backpay certificate,
is guilty of infidelity in the custody of document. He betrayed public
faith and trust in his custody of public documents. (People v. Irineo,
CA., 53 O.G. 2827)

Damage caused to a third party or to the public interest

In a case where the accused, employee of the Bureau of Posts
returned the money bills which he had stolen after opening the letters
to avoid prosecution, it was held that although there was no damage
caused to third parties (owners of the letters), there was damage to the
public interest caused by the accused. He was convicted of infidelity
in the custody of documents. (U.S. v. Marino, 10 Phil. 652)

Crime is committed by breaking or permitting seals to be broken.

Illustration of damage to the public interest

Damage or intent to cause damage is not necessary.

A sorter and filer of money orders cashed in the office, who tore
a money order which had been falsified is guilty of infidelity in the
custody of a document, for by the destruction of that money order, the
prosecution of the party who falsified it was rendered difficult, which
indisputably is a damage to the public interest. (People v. Paloma,
CA, 40 O.G. 2087)

Where documents are sealed by competent authorities, it is
evident that the purpose thereof is to insure their preservation.
It is sufficient that the seal is broken, even if the contents are
not tampered with. Article 227 does not require that there be damage
caused or that there be intent to cause damage.

The word “custody" means a guarding or keeping safe; care.
(See People v. Irineo, CA., 53 O.G. 2827. Article 226 uses
the
phrase “officially entrusted to him," not to his custody.)
Closed documents must be entrusted to the custody of the accused
by reason of his office.

Three envelopes containing election returns and addressed to
the provincial treasurer were handed by the P.C. sergeant to the
municipal treasurer who put thereon seeding wax. The municipal
treasurer was accused of opening the envelopes, taking out the
election returns contained therein and later returning them inside
their respective envelopes.

Held: The accused did not actually become the custodian of three
envelopes turned over to him by the P.C. sergeant and redelivered by
the accused to said sergeant after having applied sealing wax to the
same. The envelopes were not addressed to the accused. They were
addressed to the Provincial Treasurer and were on the desk of the
accused just for the period of time necessary to put thereon the sealing
wax. Under Article 228, the closed documents must be entrusted to
(the custody of) the accused by reason of his office. (People v. Lineses,
CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 14, 4773)
The act should not fall under Article 227.

What would be the offense committed if, in opening closed papers
or object, the public officer broke the seal?
The offense would be breaking seal, and not the crime of opening
a closed document, because the offender must be a public officer “not
included in the provisions of the next preceding article.”

Article 228 does not require that there be damage or intent to

Crimes Committed By Public Officers

Art. 230

The offender must have charge of papers or copies of paper.
The word “charge’ means control or custody. It seems that if the
public officer is merely entrusted with the papers but not with the
custody of the papers, he is not liable under this provision.

Distinguished from infidelity in the custody of document or papers
by removing the same.

If the papers contain secrets and therefore should not be
published, and the public officer having charge thereof removes and
delivers them wrongfully to a third person, the crime is revelation of
secrets by a public officer.
If the papers do not contain secrets, their removal for an illicit
purpose is infidelity in the custody of documents.
Damage is an element of the offenses defined in Article 229.

This article punishes minor official betrayals, infidelities of
little consequence, affecting usually the administration of justice,
executive or official duties, or the general interest of the public
order. (Albert)

This article provides a higher penalty, if the act “shall have
caused serious damage to the public interest; otherwise,’ a lesser
penalty is imposed. The use of the word “serious” modifying “damage”
indicates that the lesser penalty refers to causing damage which is
not serious.

Reason for the provision.
The law has taken into account that a superior officer may
sometimes err, and that orders issued by him may proceed from a

mistaken judgment.

For this reason, it entitles a subordinate to suspend in such

cases the order issued, to submit his reason to his superior in order

that the latter may give them proper weight, if they are entitled to
any. So far there is no crime.
But if the superior disapproves the suspension of his order and
reiterates it to his subordinate, the latter must obey it at once and
refusal to do so constitutes contempt, for by his resistance and refusal
to do so, he undertakes to dictate to his superior. (Albert)
This article does not apply if the order of the superior is illegal.
Thus, if the order of the superior is illegal, the subordinate has a
legal right to refuse to execute such order, for under the law, obedience
to an order which is illegal is not justified and the subordinate who
obeys such order may be held criminally liable. (See Art. 11, par. 6)

failure shall result in serious damage to the public interest,

Reason why refusal to discharge elective office is punished.

A chief of police who flatly and insolently refuses to serve

do so by the latter official, is guilty of a violation of this article. (See
People v. Castro, G.R. No. 19273, March 16, 1923)

The reason is that once an individual is elected to an office by
the will of the people, the discharge of the duties of said office becomes
a matter of duty, not only a right.

Is damage to public interest essential?

Note that this Article penalizes refusal to discharge the duties
of an elective office. Hence, refusal to discharge the duties of an
appointive office is not covered by this Article.

Yes. There must be damage to the public interest or to a third
party, great or small.

By maltreating such prisoner to extort a confession or to
obtain some information from the prisoner.

A person was suspected of having committed a crime and taken
to a cemetery and maltreated there by the policemen. Since he is
not yet booked in the office of the police and placed in jail even for a
moment, he is not a detention prisoner and, therefore, the policemen
may be guilty only of physical injuries. (People v. Baring, CA, 37
O.G. 1366)

The public officer must have actual charge of the prisoner to hold
him liable for maltreatment of prisoner.
The Mayor of the municipality of Tiaong, Quezon, was accused
of maltreatment of a prisoner, Moises Escueta, by assaulting, beating
and striking the abdomen, face, breast and arms of the latter with an
automatic pistol and his fists, for the purpose of extorting confession

from him.

The maltreatment (1) must relate to the correction or handling of the
prisoner, or (2) must be for the purpose of extorting a confession
or of obtaining some information from the prisoner.
Thus, if the jailer inflicted physical injuries on the prisoner
because of personal grudge against the prisoner, the jailer is liable
for physical injuries only. (People v. Javier, supra)

Article 235 was not applied, because there was no clear evidence
that the maltreatment was for the purpose of extorting confession

if any is caused by his maltreating the prisoner. Article 235
states
that the penalty to be imposed upon the offender for
maltreatment
of prisoners is “in addition to his liability for the physical injuries
or
damage caused.”
In view of this provision, there is no complex crime of maltreat¬
ment of prisoners with serious or less serious physical injuries, as
defined in Article 48.

Penalties.
(a)

Republic Act No. 9745 (Anti-Torture Act of 2009) prohibits the use
of torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or
punishment.

Torture, defined.

“Torture” refers to an act by which severe pain or suffering,
whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for
such purposes as obtaining from him/her or a third person information
or a confession; punishing him/her for an act he/she or a third person
has committed or is suspected of having committed; or intimidating
or coercing him/her or a third person; or for any reason based on
discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted
by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a
person in authority or agent of a person in authority. It does not
include pain or buffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental
to lawful sanctions. (Sec. 3(a))
Other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment

“Other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment*
refers to a deliberate and aggravated treatment or punishment
not enumerated under Section 4 of the Act, inflicted by a person in
authority or agent of a person in authority against a person under
his/her custody, which attains a level of severity causing suffering,
gross humiliation or debasement to the latter. (Sec. 3[b] and Sec. 5)
Freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading
treatment or punishment, an absolute right.

There must be a written or formal resignation.

A verbal statement made by the accused to the Collector of
Internal Revenue that he was resigning is not the form of resignation
contemplated by the set-up of our Civil Service System. The
resignation has to pass to various officials of the offices concerned for
appropriate action. Herein accused was an employee of the Bureau of
Internal Revenue and he was appointed therein by the department
head concerned (Secretary of Finance) upon recommendation of the
Collector of Internal Revenue. For this reason, no other official has
to approve accused’s resignation, but the one who appointed him a
power that is an adjunct to his appointing power. This goes to show
that a written or formal resignation is indispensable to a resigning
employee. (People v. Santos, CA., 55 O.G. 5566)

When Is the offense qualified?

If the abandonment of the office has for its purpose to evade the
discharge of the duties of preventing, prosecuting or punishing any of
the crimes falling within Title One, and Chapter One of Title Three
of Book Two of this Code, the penalty is higher. (Art. 238, par. 2)
“Title One, and Chapter One of Title Three of Book Two of this

But a municipal president who received a complaint signed by

That he (a) assumes a power pertaining to the executive

Articles 239 to 241 punish interference by officers of one of the three

departments of the government (Legislative, Executive, and
three
the
Judiciary) with the functions of the officers of another department.
(People v. Hilvano, 99 Phil. 655)

Thus, a councilor who assumes a power pertaining to the mayor
or obstructs him in the lawful exercise of his power is not liable under
Article 240, because only a judge can commit usurpation of executive
functions. The councilor is liable under Article 177 of the Code, if he
assumes the power of the mayor. fSee People v. Hilvano, 99 Phil. 655)

Crimes Committed By Public Officers

That the offender knows that his nominee or appointee lacks
the qualifications at the time he made the nomination or
appointment.

The offense is committed by “nominating” or by “appointing.”

“Nominate” is different from “recommend.” Recommending,
knowing that the recommendee has no qualification, is not a crime.
“Person lacking the legal qualifications therefor.”
There must be a law providing for the qualifications of a person
be
to nominated or appointed to a public office.

The qualification to hold public office may refer to educational
attainment, civil service eligibility or experience. For instance, for one
to be appointed as judge, he must be a lawyer. So if the Judicial and
Bar Council nominates a person for appointment as judge knowing

him to be not a member of the Philippine Bar, such act constitutes a
violation of the law under consideration. (People v. Sandiganbayan,

TITLE SEVEN
Crimes Committed By Public Officers

Proof of solicitation is not necessary when there is sexual
intercourse.
The appellant was in charge of the prisoners, among them a
woman, in the Tondo police station. He entered the cell of the woman
and had illicit relations with her.
The appellant argues that the proof fails to show that he solicited
a woman in his custody. It was proven, however, that his illicit
relations were consummated. It would be a strange interpretation to
place upon said law, that a failure in the proof to show a “solicitation"
was sufficient to relieve the defendant from responsibility, when the
act solicited was consummated. (U.S. v. Morelos, 29 Phil. 572)

Meaning of “solicit"

The word “solicit* means to propose earnestly and persistently
something unchaste and immoral to a woman.

The advances must be immoral or indecent
And note that the law uses the words “immoral or indecent
advances.”
The crime of abuses against chastity is consummated by mere
proposal.
This crime is consummated by mere proposal, because it is
sufficient that there is soliciting or making immoral or indecent
advances to the woman.

It is not necessary that the woman solicited should have yielded
to the solicitation of the offender.

Art. 246. Parricide. Any person who shall kill his father,
mother, or child, whether legitimate or illegitimate, or any of
his ascendants, or descendants, or his spouse, shall be guilty
of parricide and shall be punished by the penalty of reclusion
perpetua to death.1 (As amended by RA. No. 7659)

Elements:

1.

That a person is killed.

2.

That the deceased is killed by the accused.

3.

That the deceased is the father, mother, or child, whether
legitimate or illegitimate, or a legitimate other ascendant or
other descendant, or the legitimate spouse, of the accused.

Essential element of parricide.

Relationship of the offender with the victim is the essential
element of this crime.

Parents and children are not included in the term "ascendants” or

“descendants.”
The ascendants and descendants referred to in this article
exclude parents and children.
The law should read “or any other ascendant or descendant.
This is the correct translation from the Spanish text of Article 246.

‘See Appendix “A," Table of Penalties, No. 37.
699

598

Art. 246

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The other ascendant or descendant must be legitimate.

He who kills an illegitimate grandfather or an illegitimate
grandson is not guilty of parricide, but of simple homicide or murder
as the case may be.
A is the natural son of B. C is the legitimate father of B. A killed
C. Is A guilty of parricide? No. C is an illegitimate grandfather of A.
The crime committed is only homicide.
The term “illegitimate” embraces all children bom out of wedlock.
Thus, (a) adulterine, (b) incestuous, and (c) sacrilegious children are
included under the term “illegitimate."
The father, mother, or child may be legitimate or illegitimate.
The law is clear on this point. It says: “any person who shall kill
his father, mother, or child, whether legitimate or illegitimate, x x x
shall be guilty of parricide x x x.”

If the deceased is either the father, mother, or the child, of the
accused, proof of legitimacy is not required. (People v. Embalido, 58
Phil. 154)
The child should not be less than three days old.

If the child killed by his parent is less than three days old, the
crime is infanticide. (Art. 255)

Only relatives by blood and in the direct line, except the spouse,
are considered in parricide.

Note that Article 246 mentions “father, mother, or child,” the
first two being the ascendants of the latter and the latter being the
descendant of the former, “whether legitimate or illegitimate." Only
relatives by blood may be legitimate or illegitimate. On the other
hand, the “ascendants or descendants” must be legitimate. They, too,
must be relatives by blood.
Therefore, an adoptive father or adopted son, or father-in-law
or son-in-law is not included in this provision for parricide.
Presumption of marriage in parricide.

In parricide, the best proof of relationship between appellant

and the deceased is the marriage certificate, and in the absence

thereof, oral evidence of the fact of marriage may be considered. The
testimony of appellant that he was married to the deceased is an
admission against his penal interest. It is a confirmation of the semper
praesumitur pro matrimonio and the presumption that “a man and a
woman deporting themselves as husband and wife have entered into
a lawful contract of marriage.” (People v. Florenda, G.R. No. 136845,
October 8, 2003; Sec. 5[bb], Rule 131; People v. Majuri, 96 SCRA 472)
Sophia was first married to Nusi Munib whom she divorced on
March 7, 1977 before a Muslim leader in accordance with Muslim
customs, as authorized under Presidential Decree No. 793, effective as
of June 19, 1969. More than a year after the divorce, Sophia married
Sukarno in conformity with Muslim customs. Sukarno admitted the
marriage and spoke of Sophia in his testimony as his wife. Hence,
the rule of semper praesumitur pro matrimonio applies in this case.
(Sec. 5[bb], Rule 131, Rules of Court) Every intendment of law or
fact leans toward the validity of the marriage. (Art. 220, Civil Code)
Sukarno’s killing of Sophia must be regarded as parricide within the
meaning of Article 246 of the Revised Penal Code. (People v. Sukarno
Mawallil, No. L-63154, June 19, 1984)
Annulment of marriage is not a prejudicial question in a criminal
case for parricide.

At the time of the commission of the alleged crime, petitioner
and respondent were married. The subsequent dissolution of their
marriage, in case the petition for annulment is granted, will have
no effect on the alleged crime that was committed at the time of the
subsistence of the marriage. In short, even if the marriage between
petitioner and respondent is annulled, petitioner could still be held
criminally liable since at the time of the commission of the alleged
crime, he was still married to respondent.
There is no basis for petitioner’s reliance on Tenebro v. Court of

Killing illegitimate spouse and Illegitimate daughter.

The accused killed the woman with whom he lived maritally
and their daughter. Where there is no clear evidence of marriage
between the accused and the woman, he is liable for homicide or
murder, depending on the circumstances, for killing the woman and
for parricide for killing his daughter.
Marriages among Muslims or among members of the ethnic cultural
communities performed in accordance with their customs, rites or
practices are valid.

Marriages among Muslims or among members of the ethnic
cultural communities may be performed validly without the necessity
of a marriage license provided they are solemnized in accordance with
their customs, rites or practices. (Art. 33, Family Code)
Relationship must be alleged.

Wife of victim cannot be convicted of parricide if charged only
with murder. However, relationship must be considered aggravating

Parricide by mistake.
If a person wanted to kill a stranger but by mistake killed his

own father, will it be parricide? Yes. Article 49 applies as regards the
proper penalty to be imposed.

Liability of stranger cooperating in parricide.

A stranger who cooperates and takes part in the commission of
the crime of parricide, is not guilty of parricide but only homicide or
murder, as the case may be. (People v. Patricio, 46 Phil. 875; People

Parricide through reckless imprudence.

The husband, who, while struggling for the possession of the gun
with his children, without intent to kill anyone, pulled the trigger of
the gun which exploded and hit his wife who was approaching them,
is guilty of parricide through reckless imprudence. (People v. Recote,

L-12629, supra)

Art. 247

Requisites for the application of Article 247:
1. That a legally married person or a parent surprises his spouse
or his daughter, the latter under 18 years of age and living with
him, in the act of committing sexual intercourse with another

person.
2.

3.

That he or she kills any or both, of them or inflicts upon
any or both of them any serious physical injury in the act or
immediately thereafter.
That he has not promoted or facilitated the prostitution of his
wife or daughter, or that he or she has not consented to the
infidelity of the other spouse.

Article 247 does not define and penalize a felony.
This article does not define and provide for a specific crime, but
grants a privilege or benefit to the accused for the killing of another
or the infliction of serious physical injuries under the circumstances
therein mentioned. (People v. Araquel, L-12629, December 9, 1959,
57 O.G. 6229)
Far from defining a felony, the article merely provides or grants
privilege
or benefit amounting practically to an exemption from

an adequate punishment to a legally married person or parent
who shall surprise his spouse or daughter in the act of committing
sexual intercourse with another, and kill any or both of them in the
act or immediately thereafter, or shall inflict upon them any serious
physical injury. Thus, in case of death or serious physical injuries,

—
—

The requisites of Article 247 must be established by the evidence
of the defense, because the prosecution will have to charge the
defendant with parricide and/or homicide, in case death results; or
serious physical injuries in the other case.
Since Article 247 does not charge a distinct crime, the accused
charged with killing his wife’s paramour, cannot enter into a
conditional plea of guilty and be sentenced immediately to destierro.
The court must receive evidence on the circumstances surrounding
the killing. (People v. Sabilul, 49 O.G. 2743)
The accused must be a legally married person.
Hence, a man who surprised his common-law wife in the act of
sexual intercourse with another man and killed her or both of them in
the act, is not entitled to the benefits of Article 247. The law requires
that he must be legally married.
The wife is entitled to the benefits of Article 247.
The wife who kills or inflicts serious physical injuries on her
husband and/or his concubine, under the circumstances mentioned
in Article 247, is entitled to the benefits of said article. (People u.
Corazon Cortez, 59 Phil. 568)
The phrase “any legally married person" and the word “spouse*
include the wife.

Must the parent be legitimate?
This article does not seem to require it. It requires only: (1) that
the daughter be under 18 years old; and (2) that she is living with

her parents.
If those circumstances concur and her parent surprises her in
the act of sexual intercourse with a man and kills or inflicts serious
physical injuries on her or both of them, Article 247 applies.
606

Art. 247

Art. 247

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

Does this article apply even if the daughter is married?

It would seem that although the law does not use the word
"unmarried" in relation to daughter, this article applies only when
the daughter is single because while under 18 years old and single
she is under parental authority. If she is married, her husband alone
can claim the benefits of Article 247.

TITLE EIGHT

Art. 247

Wresting the bolo from his wife, appellant stabbed her with it in the
breast. She died from her wound that same night. But appellant,
though seriously wounded, survived and is now being made to answer
for the killing of his wife.

Meaning of the word “surprise” in the phrase “having surprised his
spouse in the act of committing sexual intercourse with another
person.”

[The Court] [is] with the trial court in not giving appellant the
benefit of Article 247 of the R.P.C., it appearing that although he
found his wife on bed with another man, he did not kill her on that
account. For her reprehensible conduct he merely upbraided her and
bade her to leave the house. (People v. Rabandaban, 85 Phil. 636-637)

The word “surprise" means "to come upon suddenly and
unexpectedly."

Intercourse, indispensable requisite.

Surprising the spouse or young daughter in the act of sexual

But in the case of People v. Gabriel, 37 O.G. 2939; 63 Phil 1063,
the accused, peeping through a hole near the kitchen door, saw his
wife and her paramour kissing each other; that after a few moments,
he saw the paramour trying to lift the skirt of his wife; that she at first
objected but later consented and herself lowered her drawers; that the
paramour unbuttoned his drawers; and that they commenced the act
of sexual intercourse. It was only then when he attacked them. The
accused was not held liable for the injuries suffered by the paramour.

The person claiming the benefits of Article 247 must surprise
his spouse or daughter under 18 years old and living with him in the
act of committing sexual intercourse with another person. If he has
not surprised them in the act, Article 247 will not apply if he kills or
inflicts serious physical injuries on one or both of them.

The killing of his spouse by the accused must be by reason of having
surprised her in the act of sexual intercourse with another person.

January 13, 2016)

1. Accused saw his wife and paramour in the act of having
sexual intercourse. Blinded by jealousy and outrage, accused stabbed
the paramour who fought off and kicked the accused. Accused then
vented his anger on his wife when she reacted, not in defense of him,
but in support of the paramour. Hence, he also stabbed his wife several
times. Accused was given the benefit of Art. 247 and sentenced to
destierro. (People v. Oyanib, G.R. Nos. 130634-35, March 12, 2001)
2. Appellant and the now deceased Florida Napala were
husband and wife. Coming home one night from his camote plantation,
appellant found his wife lying on bed with another man. The man
was able to escape through the window, but the wife received a severe
scolding from her husband and was ordered to leave the house. Calling
her husband names, the wife gathered her clothes and picked up a
bolo in the kitchen, and when her husband followed her there, she
attacked him with the bolo, wounding him twice in the abdomen.
606

Therefore, a husband who, upon arriving home, found his wife
and a man conversing in the bedroom seated beside each other and
tried to stab the man but stabbed his wife instead, resulting in her
death, is guilty of parricide. (People u. Macal, G.R. No. 211062,
Article 247 is not applicable when the accused did not see his
spouse in the act of sexual intercourse with another person.
The phrase “in the act of committing sexual intercourse” does
not include merely sleeping on the same bed. (People v. Bituanan,
56 Phil. 23)
Neither does that phrase include a situation where the accused
surprised his wife after the act, as when he saw her already rising up
and the man buttoning his drawers. (People v. Gonzales, 69 Phil. 66)

But It is enough that the circumstances show reasonably that the
carnal act is being committed or has just been committed.
But for a husband to be justified, it is not necessary that he
sees the carnal act being committed by his wife with his own eyes.
It is enough that he surprises them under such circumstances as to

show reasonably that the carnal act is being committed or has just
been committed. ( Concurring opinion of Moran in People v. Gonzales
69 Phil. 66, citing U.S. v. Alano, 32 Phil. 381; U.S. v. Feliciano 36
Phil. 753)
The killing or inflicting of serious physical injuries must be (1) “in
the act of sexual intercourse,” or (2) “immediately thereafter.”

When a person surprised his spouse or young daughter while
having sexual intercourse with another person, it is necessary, for the
application of Article 247, that he killed or inflicted serious physical
injuries on any or both of them, either (1) while they were in the act
of sexual intercourse or, if not, because they were able to run away,
(2) immediately after surprising them in the act of sexual intercourse.
Meaning of the phrase “immediately thereafter.”
U.S. u. Alano
(32 Phil. 383-384)

Facts: Accused Alano, feeling tired, went to bed, while his wife Teresa
Marcelo remained at the window looking out and a little while afterward
told her husband that she would go down for a moment to the Chinese store
nearby, which she did.
As Teresa Marcelo was slow in returning and her sick child was crying,
Eufrasio Alano left the house to look for her in the Chinese store situated on
the corner of Calles Dakota and Tennessee, and, not finding her there, went
to look for her in another Chinese store nearby, with the same result. He,
therefore, started to return home through an alley where he tripped on a
wire lying across the way. He then observed as he stopped that among some
grass near a clump of thick bamboo, a man was lying upon a woman in a
posit ion to hold sexual intercourse with her, but they both hurriedly arose
from the ground, startled by the noise made by the defendant in stumbling.
Alano at once recognized the woman as his wife, for whom he was looking,
and the man as Martin Gonzales, who immediately started to run. He was
wearing an undershirt and a pair of drawers, which lower garment he held
and pulled up as he ran. Enraged by what he had seen, the defendant drew
a fan knife he had in his pocket and pursued Martin Gonzales, although
he did not succeed in overtaking him, and not knowing where he had fled,
returned to his house, where he found his wife Teresa in the act of climbing
the stairs. He then stabbed her several times. She died as a result of the
stabbing by the accused.

608

TITLE EIGHT
Crimes Against Persons

Art. 247

Held: The unfaithful wife was not killed in the very place where she
was caught, for the reason that the wronged husband preferred first to attack
the despoiler of his honor and afterwards the adulterous wife who succeeded

in getting away from the place where she was caught with her paramour. The

assault upon the woman must be understood to be a continuation of the act of

the wronged husband’s pursuit of her paramour, who had the good fortune to
escape and immediately get away from the place of the crime. Consequently,
although the deceased did not fall dead in the place where she was caught,
but in another place nearby, logically it must be understood that the case at
bar comes within the provisions of the said article.
The discovery, the escape, the pursuit and the killing must all form part
of one continuous act. (U.S. v. Vargas, et al., 2 Phil. 194)
People v. Coricor
(79 Phil. 672)

Facts: When he was approaching the room, the accused heard low
voices. He looked through a hole into the room and saw Lego on top of his
(accused’s) wife who was naked from the chest down. Then he unsheathed
his bolo, slowly went up passing through the kitchen door, and as he was
approaching the door of the room, Lego came out and he gave him a thrust.
Upon being wounded, Lego jumped out of the window, but the accused
pursued and killed him.
Held: Article 247 was applied and the accused was sentenced to
destierro only.

The killing must be the direct by-product of the accused's rage.
Though quite a length of time, about an hour, had passed
between the time the accused-appellant discovered his wife having
sexual intercourse with the victim and the time the latter was actually
shot, the shooting must be understood to be the continuation of the
pursuit of the victim by the accused-appellant. The Revised Penal
Code, in requiring that the accused “shall kill any of them or both
of them . . . immediately” after surprising his spouse in the act of
intercourse, does not say that he should commit the killing instantly
thereafter. It only requires that the death caused be the proximate
result of the outrage overwhelming the accused after chancing upon
the spouse in the basest act of infidelity. But the killing should have
been actually motivated by the same blind impulse, and must not have
been influenced by external factors. The killing must be the direct
by-product of the accused’s rage. (People v. Abarca, 153 SCRA 735)

Article 247 applies, in the case of a husband, only when he surprises
his wife in flagrant adultery.

to absolve him for the injuries sustained by third persons. There
is negligence on his part. Accordingly, he is liable for less serious
physical injuries through simple imprudence or negligence. (People
v. Abarca, supra)

Art 247

Thus, when a husband caught a man having sexual intercourse
with the former’s wife against her will, as she was then shouting for
help, an attack upon that man by the husband may be a defense of
relative under Article 11, paragraph 2, but not a case falling under
Article 247. (People v. Ammalun, CA., 51 O.G. 6250)

Note: The wife was not committing adultery, as she was not
voluntarily having sexual intercourse with the man.
What Is the justification for Article 247?

The law, when the circumstances provided by this article are
present, considers the spouse or parent as acting in a justified burst
of passion. (People v. Gonzales, 69 Phil. 66)

No criminal liability when less serious or slight physical injuries
are inflicted.
If the physical injuries inflicted are less serious or slight, there is
no criminal liability. It is an absolutory cause. The second paragraph
of Article 247 states that “if he shall inflict upon them physical injuries
of any other kind, he shall be exempt from punishment.”
Liability for physical injuries suffered by third persons.

Where physical injuries were suffered by third persons as a
result of being caught in the crossfire as the accused shot the victim,
the Supreme Court held that although as a rule, one committing an
offense is liable for all the consequences of his act, the rule presupposes
that the act done amounts to a felony. (Art. 4, No. 1)
In the instant case, the accused was not committing murder
when he discharged his rifle upon the accused. Inflicting death under
exceptional circumstances is not murder. Therefore, the accused
cannot be held liable for frustrated murder for the injuries sustained
by third persons as a result thereof. However, he is not totally free
from any responsibility. Granting the fact that he was not performing
an illegal act when he fired shots at the victim, he cannot be said to
be entirely without fault. While it appears that before firing at the
deceased, he uttered warning words, that is not enough a precaution
810

Art. 247

Not applicable to person who consented to the infidelity of spouse,
or who facilitated the prostitution of his wife or daughter.
The benefits of this article are not extended to the accused who
promoted or facilitated the prostitution of his wife or daughter or who
otherwise consented to the infidelity of the other spouse.
Thus, a husband who, after he had learned from the very lips of
that she was in love with another man, signed a document
wife
his
wherein he ordered his wife to look for and live with another man,
cannot claim the benefits of Article 247. (People v. Dumon, 72 Phil. 41)

Destierro not intended as penalty.
Article 247, in effect, confers upon the offended spouse or parent,
the power to inflict the supreme penalty of death.
The penalty of destierro is not really intended as a penalty
but to remove the killer spouse from the vicinity and to protect him
or her from acts of reprisal principally by relatives of the deceased
spouse. (People v. Lauron, CA., 57 O.G. 7367) This penalty is mere
banishment and is intended more for the protection of the accused
than as punishment. (People v. Coricor, 79 Phil. 672)
In what cases is a person who committed parricide not to be
punished with reclusion perpetua to death?

They are:

1.

When parricide is committed through negligence.

(Art.

2.
3.

When it is committed by mistake. (Art. 249)
When it is committed under exceptional circumstances.

deliberately killed (with malice); in other words, that there was intent
to kill. Such evidence may consist inter alia in the use of weapons
by the malefactors, the nature, location and number of wounds
sustained by the victim and the words uttered by the malefactors
before, at the time or immediately after the killing of the victim. If
the victim dies because of a deliberate act of the malefactor, intent
to kill is conclusively presumed. (People v. Delim, G.R. No. 142773,
January 28, 2003)
Rules for the application of the circumstances which qualify the
killing to murder.
(a)

That murder will exist with only one of the circumstances
described in Article 248. (U.S. v. Labai, 17 Phil. 240)
When more than one of said circumstances are present, the
others must be considered as generic aggravating. Thus, when
in killing the victim, the commission of the crime is attended by:
(1) evident premeditation; (2) treachery; and (3) price, reward
or promise, only one of them shall qualify the killing to murder
and the other shall be considered as generic aggravating
circumstances. (See People v. Dueflo, 90 SCRA 23, where the
rule was applied.)

(b)

That when the other circumstances are absorbed or included
in one qualifying circumstance, they cannot be considered as

generic aggravating.

Thus, when there were ten or more armed captors of the
female victim, and one or some of them shot her at the back, the
qualifying circumstance of murder is either treachery, abuse
of superior strength, or with the aid of armed men (People v.
Remalante, 92 Phil. 48); but if treachery is chosen to qualify the
crime, the others are not generic aggravating circumstances,
because they are included in the qualifying circumstance of
treachery. (People u. Sespefie, et al., 102 Phil. 199)
(c) That any of the qualifying circumstances enumerated in
Article 248 must be alleged in the information. (U.S. v. Campo,
23 Phil. 369)

Thus, even if during the trial the prosecution proves that
the accused killed the deceased with treachery, but treachery
is not alleged in the information, treachery cannot qualify the
614

Art. 248

Crimes Against Persons

killing to murder, the crime charged being only homicide. It is
only a generic aggravating circumstance.

The qualifying circumstances of murder, except “outraging or scoffing
at his person or corpse,” are among those defined in Article 14.
Except the last qualifying circumstance, that of “outraging or
scoffing at his person or corpse,” those mentioned in the six paragraphs
of Article 248 are fully discussed under Article 14 which defines all
aggravating circumstances in general.

With treachery.
Treachery, whenever present and alleged in the information,
qualifies the killing of the victim and raises it to the category of
murder. (People v. Limaco, 88 Phil. 35)

There is treachery when the offender commits any of the
crimes against the person, employing means, methods or forms in
the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its
execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the
offended party might make. (Art. 14[16], R.P.C.)
An unexpected and sudden attack which renders the victim
unable and unprepared to put up a defense is the essence of treachery.
(People v. Agacer, G.R. No. 177751, December 14, 2011, 662 SCRA
461, 472-473)

Example: The attack against Basilio, which came from behind,
was sudden, deliberate and unexpected. The victim was completely
unaware of any threat to his life as he was merely walking home
with his son. The use of a firearm showed deliberate intent to kill
Basilio and the location and number of gunshot wounds rendered
him defenseless and incapable of retaliation. Hence, treachery was
evident in this case, sufficient to qualify the crime to Murder. (People
v. Dayaday, G.R. No. 213224, January 16, 2017)

Killing of a child of tender years is murder.

Taking advantage of superior strength.

Abuse of superior strength is present whenever there is a
notorious inequality of forces between the victim and the aggressor
assuming a situation of superiority of strength notoriously
advantageous for the aggressor selected or taken advantage of by
him in the commission of the crime. The evidence must establish
that the assailants purposely sought the advantage, or that they
had the deliberate intent to use this advantage. To take advantage
of superior strength means to purposely use excessive force out of
proportion to the means of defense available to the person attacked.
The appreciation of this aggravating circumstance depends on the
age, size, and strength of the parties. (People v. Beduya, et cd., 641
Phil. 399 [2010]; Valenzuela u. People, 612 Phil. 907 [2009])
Examples:
1. An attack made by a man with a weapon upon a girl
which resulted in her death is murder, because the offender had
taken advantage of superior strength. His sex and weapon gave him
superiority of strength. (People v. Quesada, 62 Phil. 446; People v.
Jamoralin, G.R. No. L-2257, February 19, 1951, 88 Phil. 789)
2. The deceased, who had been wounded by one of the accused,
was being treated in his house by his wife when the three accused
pulled him from the stairs to the ground floor and then they proceeded
to stab and strike him mercilessly and indiscriminately with their
knives inflicting wounds on different parts of his body. It was held
that since the deceased was wounded, weak and unarmed, he was no
match to the three accused who were all carrying bladed weapons.
The circumstance of superior strength qualified the killing and raised
it to the category of murder. (People v. Mendoza, et al., 91 Phil. 58)
3. The accused chased, ganged up, and eventually, killed
Rolando, and deliberately used weapons (i.e., gun and bamboo stick),
which rendered Rolando defenseless from their fatal attacks. Thus,
such killing was attended with the qualifying circumstance of abuse
of superior strength. (Ramos v. People, G.R. No. 218466, January 23,

2017)

With the aid of armed men.

If the accused had companions who were armed when he
committed the crime, this circumstance is considered present.
616

TITLE EIGHT
Crimes Against Persons

Art. 248

(See People u. Ortiz, et al., 103 Phil. 944) The crime was committed
with the aid of armed men when at least two of the accused were
armed with carbine and bolo, when the five accused perpetrated the
crime. (People u. Pinca, L-16595, February 28, 1962)

The armed men must take part in the commission of the crime
directly or indirectly and the accused must avail himself of their aid
or rely upon them when the crime is committed. (U.S. u. Abaigar, 2

Phil. 417)
Employing means to weaken the defense.

A person who suddenly throws a cloak over the head of his
opponent and while in this situation he kills him (U.S. v. Devela,
et al., 3 Phil. 625), or one who suddenly casts sand or dirt upon the
eyes of the victim and then kills him, evidently employs means which
weaken the defense. (People v. Siaotong, et al., G.R. No. L-9242, March
29, 1957, 100 Phil. 1103)
Employing means or persons to insure or afford impunity.

When means or persons are employed by the accused who killed
the deceased to prevent his being recognized, or to secure himself
against detection and punishment, he may be held liable for murder.
It seems that one who covered his face with handkerchief before
killing his victim is liable for murder, because he employed means to
insure or afford impunity.
In consideration of a price, reward, or promise.

The person who received the price or reward or who accepted a
promise of price or reward would not have killed the victim were it
not for that price, reward or promise. Such person is a principal by

is a principal by induction.

Art. 248

By means of fire, poison, explosion, etc.

When the Code declares that homicide committed by means
of
fire shall be deemed to be murder, it is intended that there should
be
an actual design to kill and that the use of fire should be purposely
adopted as a means to that end.

If the objective of the offender is to kill and arson is resorted to as
the means to accomplish the crime, the offender can be charged with
murder only. But if the objective is to kill and in fact the offender
has already done so and arson is resorted to as a means to cover
up the killing, the offender may be convicted of two separate crimes
of either homicide or murder, and arson. (People v. Cedenio, G.R. No

The single act of accused-appellant
burning the house of
Manuel Salvador, with the main objective of killing the latter and
his daughter, Analyn Salvador, resulting in their deaths resulted
in the complex crime of double murder. (People v. Gaffud, G.R. No.
168050, September 19, 2008)
The accused who had direct control of poisoning the rats that
might attack the poultry, had in his possession arsenic powder for
the purpose. He had illicit relations with a married woman. He and
that woman wanted to eliminate her husband so that they could live
together. He allowed her to take a quantity of the Arsenic powder
and put it in the coffee which she gave to her husband. It was shown
that the cause of the death of the woman’s husband was the poisoned
coffee that she had given him. It was held that the paramour was
guilty of murder. (People v. Bonifacio, 105 Phil. 1283)
A person who threw a hand grenade at his victim who was killed
as a result of the explosion is guilty of murder. (People u. Guillen,
85 Phil. 307)

—

Treachery and premeditation are inherent in murder by poison.
Treachery and evident premeditation are inherent in murder
by means of poison and, as such, they cannot be considered as
aggravating. (Viada, 3 Codigo Penal 29)
The case of People v. Galura, 16 C.A. Rep. 70.

To excite a woman sexually, so that he could easily consummate
his dastardly lewd desire, the accused gave her chocolate with an
618

overdose of cantharide. Consequently, the woman died, it being a

fact that cantharide contains poison. There is no question that the
intention of the accused was merely to excite the woman sexually,
and not to kill her. Article 4, paragraph 1, of the Code was correctly
applied when the Court held that the crime committed was homicide.
The accused had no intention to kill the woman; but having committed
a felony, he was responsible for the consequence even if the wrongful
act done was different from that which he intended.
Two Justices dissented, contending that murder was committed
of poison. They contented that since the administration of
means
by
cantharide is a criminal act, the accused should be held responsible for
all the consequences even if the result be different from that which was
intended. (Art. 4, par. 1, R.P.C.) It is claimed that the use of poison is
inherent in murder. It is pointed out that in People v. Cagoco, 58 Phil.
524, even if there was no intent to kill in inflicting physical injuries
with treachery, the accused in that case was convicted of murder.
The dissenting opinion does not express accurately the rule. It
is not correct to say that the use of poison is inherent in murder. It
becomes inherent only when the offender has the intent to kill the
victim and he uses poison as a means to kill him. Note the phrase “By
means of x x x poison” in Article 248, and the phrase “With treachery*
in the same article. The words “by means” presuppose an objective
to bring about a result. On the other hand, in murder qualified by
treachery, it is required only that there is treachery in the attack,
and this is true even if the offender has no intent to kill the person
assaulted.
On the occasion of inundation, shipwreck, etc., of an earthquake,
eruption of a volcano, epidemic or any other public calamity.

Killing a person on the occasion of inundation, shipwreck,
eruption of a volcano, epidemic, etc., or any other public calamity,
when taken advantage of by the offender, qualifies the crime to

murder.

With evident premeditation.

Evident premeditation exists when the execution of the criminal
act is preceded by cool thought and reflection upon the resolution to
carry out the criminal intent during the space of time sufficient to
619

Art. 248

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

arrive at a calm judgment. Premeditation, to be considered, must
be evident and so proved with equal certainty and clarity as the
crime itself. It is essential that the following elements should there
concur: (1) the time when the offender has determined to commit the
crime, (2) an act manifestly indicating that the culprit has clung to
his determination and, (3) a sufficient interval of time between the
determination and the execution of the crime has lapsed to allow him
to reflect upon the consequences of his act. (People u. Repollo 387
Phil. 390 [2000])
With cruelty.

There is cruelty when other injuries or wounds are inflicted
deliberately by the offender, which are not necessary for the killing
of the victim. The victim must be alive when the other injuries or
wounds are inflicted.

But there is no cruelty, when the offender in inflicting several
other wounds on the victim has only a decided purpose to kill him
Outraging or scoffing at the person or corpse of the victim.

A person is found dead with wounds in the back, neck and other
parts of the body. What is the crime committed?

Murder. This is either cruelty if the victim was still alive when
other wounds were inflicted or, otherwise, outraging or scoffing at his
corpse. (People v. Lozada, G.R. No. L-47692, June 4, 1943)
The word “outraging" means to commit an extremely vicious or
deeply insulting act.
The word "scoffing” means to jeer, and implies a showing of
irreverence.

The killer scoffed at the dead when the intestines were removed

Penalty for murder.

Before the 1987 Constitution abolished the death penalty,
the penalty for murder was reclusion temporal in its maximum
period to death. With the abolition of the death penalty in the 1987
Constitution, the penalty became reclusion temporal in its maximum
period to reclusion perpetua. (People v. Gavarra, 155 SCRA 327; People
v. Lopez, 157 SCRA 304)
R.A. No. 7659 restored the death penalty and increased the
penalty for murder to reclusion perpetua to death. In view of RA.

penalty for murder is now reclusion perpetua.

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

TITLE EIGHT
Crimes Against Persons

Homicide is the unlawful killing of any person, which is neither
parricide, murder, nor infanticide.

Usually, the intent to kill is shown by the kind of weapon used
by the offender and the parts of the victim's body at which the weapon
was aimed, as shown by the wounds inflicted. Hence, when a deadly
weapon, like a bolo, is used to stab the victim in the latter’s abdomen,
the intent to kill can be presumed.

Art. 249
Homicide, defined.

Elements:

Art. 249

1.

That a person was killed;

Exception:

2.

That the accused killed him without any justifyingcircumstance-

3.

That the accused had the intention to kill, which is presumed-

4.

That the killing was not attended by any of the qualifying
circumstances of murder, or by that of parricide or infanticide

But if the accused went to his wife, who was living separately
from him, to entreat her to live with him again, but a cousin of his
wife provoked him then and there and caused him to assault him
(wife’s cousin) and her son by first marriage, with a bolo, inflicting
physical injuries, caused indiscriminately and not deliberately, the
purpose of the accused in going to the house, and not the kind of
weapon he carried nor the parts of the bodies of the victims on which
the wounds were inflicted, is indicative and determinative of his
intention. The accused is liable only for physical injuries. (People v.
Penesa, 81 Phil. 398)

“Shall kill another.”

In homicide, the victim must be killed to consummate the
crime. If the victim is not killed, it is either attempted or frustrated
homicide.
Penalty when the victim of homicide is under 12 years of age.

The penalty for homicide shall be reclusion perpetua when the
victim is under 12 years of age. (Sec. 10, R.A. No. 7610)
Intent to kill is conclusively presumed when death resulted.

When death resulted, even if there is no intent to kill, the crime
is homicide, not merely physical injuries, because with respect to
crimes of personal violence, the penal law looks particularly to the
material results following the unlawful act and holds the aggressor
responsible for all the consequences thereof. (U.S. v. Gloria, 3 Phil-

333)

Evidence of intent to kill is important only in attempted or frustrated
homicide.

In attempted or frustrated homicide, the offender must have
the intent to kill the victim. If there is no intent to kill on the part
of the offender, he is liable for physical injuries (Arts. 263-266)

only.

622

Note: The bolo which the accused carried with him is one
ordinarily used by farm laborers and the accused was such a farm
laborer.
Intent to kill must be proved beyond reasonable doubt

The Court of Appeals concluded that the petitioner had no
intention to kill the offended party, in view of petitioner’s testimony.
“Q

—
—

In other words you want to tell us that you will do
everything you could to stop Nacionales digging the
canal, because you need water?

Yes, sir, because I need the water.”
Held: The intent to kill being an essential element of frustrated
or attempted homicide, said element must be proved by clear and
convincing evidence. Such element must be proved with the same
degree of certainty as is required of the other elements of the crime.
The inference of intent to kill should not be drawn in the absence of
circumstances sufficient to prove such intent beyond reasonable doubt.
(Mondragon v. People, G.R. No. L-17666, June 30, 1966)
A

623

Art. 249

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

That the death of the deceased was due to his refusal to be operated
on, not a defense.

The fact that the victim would have lived had he received
appropriate medical attention is immaterial. Hence, the refusal of
the deceased to be operated on does not relieve the offender of the
criminal liability for his death. (People v. Sto. Domingo, CA.., G.R.
No. 3783, May 31, 1939; People v. Flores, CA-G.R. No. 3567, May
25, 1939)

Note: This ruling is based on Article 4, paragraph 1, Book I
R.P.C.
The killing must not be justified.

If the accused killed the deceased in self-defense, defense of a
relative, defense of a stranger, or under any of the other justifying
circumstances (Art. 11), the accused is not liable for homicide or any
other crime.
“Without the attendance of any of the circumstances enumerated
in the next preceding article" or of the qualifying circumstance of
parricide or infanticide.

In the absence of clear proof of any circumstance that would
qualify as murder the killing of the deceased, the guilty person
should be sentenced only for homicide. (People v. Cuaresma, et al.,
94 Phil. 304)
The offender should not be the father, mother or child, or
legitimate other ascendant or legitimate other descendant or spouse
of the deceased, for otherwise the crime would be parricide.
The person killed should not be less than three days old,
otherwise the crime would be infanticide. (Art. 255)
No offense of frustrated homicide through imprudence.

The accused pharmacist compounded and prepared the medicine
on prescription by a doctor. The accused erroneously used a highly
poisonous substance. When taken by the patient, the latter nearly
died. The accused was charged with frustrated homicide through
reckless imprudence.
624

TITLE EIGHT
Crimes Against Persons

Art. 249

Held: It is error to convict the accused of frustrated homicide
through reckless imprudence. He is guilty of physical injuries through
reckless imprudence. The element of intent to kill in frustrated
homicide is incompatible with negligence or imprudence. Intent in
felonies by means of dolo is replaced with lack of foresight or skill in
felonies by culpa. (People v. Castillo, et al., 76 Phil. 72)
Where the wounds that caused death were inflicted by two different
persons, even if they were not in conspiracy, each one of them is
guilty of homicide.

A shot C with a pistol. Almost immediately after A had shot C, B
also shot C with his (B’s) gun. Both wounds inflicted by A and B were
mortal. C was still alive when B shot him. C died as a result of the
wounds received from A and B, acting independently of each other.
Held: Since either wound could cause the death of C, both are
liable and each one of them is guilty of homicide. The burden of proof
is on each of the defendants to show that the wound inflicted by him
did not cause the death. (People v. Abiog, 37 Phil. 137) The one who
inflicted a wound that contributed to the death of the victim is equally
liable. (People v. Mallon, CA-G.R. No. 5754, April 24, 1940)
When it is clearly established by the evidence that the deceased
died as a result of the several wounds inflicted upon him by Atanacio
and Perpetuo, and it has not been shown which wounds were inflicted
by one and which by the other, both are liable for the death of said
deceased and each of them is guilty of homicide. (People u. Bool, et
al., CA., 50 O.G. 3130)

Note: This ruling is applicable only when there is no conspiracy
between or among the accused. When there is conspiracy, it is not
necessary to apply this ruling, because in such case, the act of one
is the act of all.
When the act of mortally wounding and the fact of suicide by the
victim concur.
A shot B with a revolver in the latter’s abdomen, inflicting a
wound that was necessarily mortal. B fell to the ground, stunned for
an instant, but soon got up and went into his house. Soon afterward,
B procured a knife and, knowing that he would die anyway, cut his
625

Art. 249

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

throat, inflicting a ghastly wound, from the effect of which, he died
in five minutes.

Held: The contention of the defense that B killed himself and
was not killed by A, is untenable. When the death of B occurred
the wound inflicted by A did contribute to the event. B was actually
dying when he cut his throat. After the throat was cut, B continued
to languish from both wounds. Drop by drop the life current went
out from both wounds. (People v. Lewis, [1899] 124 Cal., 551, cited
in U.S. v. Abiog, 37 Phil. 143)
Use of unlicensed firearm is an aggravating circumstance in
homicide.

Under R.A. No. 1059, use of loose firearm in the commission
of a crime, like murder, shall be considered as an aggravating
circumstance. In view of the amendments introduced by R.A. No.
8294 and R.A. No. 10591, to P.D. No. 1866, separate prosecutions
for homicide and illegal possession are no longer in order. Instead,
illegal possession of firearm is merely to be taken as an aggravating
circumstance. The intent of Congress is to treat the offense of illegal
possession of firearm and the commission of homicide or murder with
the use of unlicensed firearm as a single offense. (People v. Gaborne,
G.R. No. 210710, July 27, 2016)
Accidental homicide.

Accidental homicide is the death of a person brought about
by a lawful act performed with proper care and skill, and without
homicidal intent.
Thus, in a boxing bout where the game is freely permitted by law
or local ordinance, and all the rules of the game have been observed,
the resulting death or injuries cannot be deemed felonious, since the
playing of the game is a lawful act.

But if the rules have been violated, as a foul blow, and death
resulted, the crime would be homicide through negligence.

TITLE EIGHT
Crimes Against Persons

Art. 250

Corpus delicti in crimes against persons.

The prosecution is burdened to prove the corpus delicti which
consists of two things: first, the criminal act and second, defendant’s
agency in the commission of the act. (Gay v. State, 60 Southwestern
Reporter, 771 [1901]) Wharton says that corpus delicti includes two
things: first, the objective; second, the subjective element of crimes.
(People v. Manliguez, et al., 206 SCRA 812 [1992]) In homicide (by
dolo) and in murder cases, the prosecution is burdened to prove:
(a) the death of the party alleged to be dead; (b) that the death was
produced by the criminal act of some other than the deceased and
was not the result of accident, natural cause or suicide; and (c) that
defendant committed the criminal act or was in some way criminally
responsible for the act which produced the death. [Wharton, Criminal
Law, Vol. 1, pp. 473-474, citing Lovelady v. State, 14 Tex. App. 545)

Corpus delicti, in modem sense of the term, means the actual
commission of the crime charged. (People v. Madrid, 88 Phil. 1, cited
in People v. Yee, CA., 52 O.G. 4298)
Corpus delicti means that a crime was actually perpetrated, and
does not refer to the body of the murdered person. (People v. Bungay,
G.R. No. L-18308, April 30, 1966, pp. 834-838)

Thus, when the body of the supposed victim who was unknown,
could not be located on the bank of the river, the place indicated by
the witness, and there was a possibility that the victim might have
been borne away by the current and might have survived, the fact of
death is not sufficiently established. (U.S. v. Samarin, 1 Phil. 239)
But if the victim is known and could not have survived, because
the evidence shows that his arms and legs had been tied with a rope
and thereafter he had been stuck on the head with a piece of wood,
before he was thrown into the sea, even if his body was never found,
the corpus delicti is established.

And if the foul blow is intended for the purpose of killing the
opponent, the crime of intentional homicide is committed.

Art. 250. Penalty for frustrated parricide, murder, or
homicide, The courts, in view of the facts of the case, may
impose upon the person guilty of the frustrated crime or
parricide, murder, or homicide, defined and penalized in the

—

Art 250

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

preceding articles, a penalty lower by one degree than that
which should be imposed under the provisions of Article 50.

The courts, considering the facts of the case, may likewise
reduce by one degree the penalty which under Article 51
should be imposed for an attempt to commit any of such

crimes.

Courts may impose a penalty two degrees lower for frustrated
parricide, murder or homicide.

The court may impose a penalty lower by one degree than that
imposed under Article 50.
Article 50 provides that the penalty next lower in degree than
that prescribed by law for the consummated felony shall be imposed
upon the principal in a frustrated felony.
Hence, the court can impose a penalty two degrees lower, in view
of the facts of the case.

This is permissive

—

not mandatory.

Courts may impose a penalty three degrees lower for attempted
parricide, murder or homicide.

The court may reduce by one degree the penalty imposed under
Article 51.

Article 51 provides that the penalty lower by two degrees than
that prescribed by law for the consummated felony should be imposed
upon the principals in an attempt to commit a felony.
The court can, therefore, impose a penalty three degrees lower
in view of the facts of the case.
Illustrations:

Thus, where the defendant had good reason to be jealous of
his wife and attempted to kill her under the influence of resulting
passion, the accused may be given the benefit of this article. (U.S. v.
Villanueva, 2 Phil. 62; U.S. v. Poblete, 10 Phil. 578)

TITLE EIGHT
Crimes Against Persons

In a case of frustrated murder, in view of the nature of the

wounds inflicted upon the injured party which were cured in less than
one month, the accused may be given the benefit of a reduction of the

corresponding penalty. (U.S. v. Poblete, 10 Phil. 582)

An attempt on, or a conspiracy against, the life of the Chief
Executive, etc., is punishable by life imprisonment.

Any person who shall attempt on or conspire against the life
of the Chief Executive of the Republic of the Philippines, that of
any member of his family, or against the life of any member of his
cabinet, the Interim Batasang Pambansa, the Supreme Court, the
Constitutional Commissions, general officers of major services and
commands of the Armed Forces of the Philippines or any member of
their families, or who uses any firearms or deadly weapons against
the person of any of the government officials enumerated herein,
or any member of his family shall suffer the penalty of death. (P.D.
No. 1110-A, as amended by P.D. No. 1743) Under Sec. 2 of R.A. No.
9436, in lieu of the death penalty, the penalty of life imprisonment
shall be imposed.

The reason for the heavier penalty for any attempt on or
conspiracy against the life of the Chief Executive, etc., is that the
prevailing circumstances require that he and the other persons
mentioned be given ample protection against lawless elements who
may attempt on or conspire against their lives, and to make it as a

deterrent.

Art 251

When there are two identified groups of men who assaulted each

other, then there is no tumultuous affray.

A, assisted by some laborers, was gathering tobacco. Then, they

heard two sounds of the horn, and later on the eastern side of the

land, they discerned more than 13 men coming towards them. When
these men came, they surrounded and attacked them. Two laborers
were wounded. When they saw the two laborers fall on the ground,
one of them sounded the horn and his companions withdrew. One
of the laborers later died. There was no confusion in the aggression
or the defense. The aggressors helped one another to inflict upon the

That they did not compose groups organized for the common

deceased the fatal blow. The quarrel here was between two well-known
groups of men.

3.

That these several persons quarreled and assaulted one
another in a confused and tumultuous manner.

4.

That someone was killed in the course of the affray.

5.

That it cannot be ascertained who actually killed the deceased.

6.

That the person or persons who inflicted serious physical
injuries or who used violence can be identified.

Held: The crime committed is not death caused in a tumultuous
affray. The crime of homicide was committed in view of the death of
one of the two laborers. The accused and their companions were united
in their common purpose to attack, as is shown by the circumstances
that they rallied together under the signal of two sounds of the horn
in order to commence the aggression and they withdrew from the
field also under the signal of one sound of the horn. (U.S. v. Tandoc,
40 Phil. 954)

Tumultuous affray exists when at least four persons took part

The word “several” (in the phrase “when, while several persons’)
in Article 251 means more than two but not very many. The word
“tumultuous" as used in Article 153 means that the disturbance is
caused by more than three persons who are armed or are provided
with means of violence.
There was no tumultuous affray between groups of persons in
the course of which Aro died. On the contrary, the evidence clearly
established that there were only two persons, Wacoy and Quibac,
who picked on one defenseless individual, Aro, and attacked him
repeatedly, taking turns in inflicting punches and kicks on the poor
victim. There was no confusion and tumultuous quarrel or affray, nor
was there a reciprocal aggression in that fateful incident. (Wacoy v.
People, G.R. No. 213792, June 22, 2015)

There is no crime of death in a tumultuous affray if the quarrel
is between two well-known groups. (People v. Corpus, 102 SCRA
674) or if a group of identified men physically assaults a common,
particular victim. (People u. Campa, G.R. No. 105391, February 28,
1994) In such cases, the accused were held liable for homicide under
Article 249, not under Article 251.
When there was confusion in the fight and the person who inflicted
the wounds could not be identified, the crime is death caused in a
tumultuous affray.

Four accused, on one hand, fought against three other persons,

251, because they all used violence. (People v. Bandojo, G.R. No

44588, TV L.J., 934)

Note: In this case, although the four persons, on one hand and
the three persons, on the other, seem to form two groups, such is not
the case because there was no unity of purpose and intention among
the persons who used violence.
Someone is killed In the course of the affray.

The person killed in the course of the affray need not be one of
the participants in the affray.
“And it cannot be ascertained who actually killed the deceased.”

If the one who inflicted the fatal wound is known, the crime is
not homicide in tumultuous affray. It is a case of homicide under
Article 249 against the one who inflicted the fatal wound.
The serious physical injuries, if inflicted by one of the
participants, should not be the cause of death of the deceased.
Who are liable for death in a tumultuous affray?

1.

The person or persons who inflicted the serious physical
injuries are liable. (Art. 251, par. 1)

2.

If it is not known who inflicted the serious physical injuries
on the deceased, all the persons who used violence upon the
person of the victim are liable, but with lesser liability. (Art
251, par. 2)

Those who used violence upon the person of the victim are
liable for death caused in a tumultuous affray only “if it cannot
be determined who inflicted the serious physical injuries on the
deceased.” (Art. 251, par. 2)

If the participant in the affray who inflicted the serious physical
injuries is known, he alone is liable for death caused in a tumultuous
affray. Those who used violence only, without inflicting serious
physical injuries, may be held liable for the act or acts actually
performed by them.

Application of the second paragraph of Article 251.
After a free-for-all fight, one of the participants died the next
day. There was no convincing evidence that it was the knife which
the accused wielded upon the body of the deceased that precisely
caused any of the three stab wounds in the body of the deceased. All
the wounds sustained by the deceased were inflicted by protagonists
not composing groups. It was held that the accused, having used
violence upon the person of the deceased in wielding the knife, was
liable under the second paragraph of Article 251. (People v. Dacanay,

of physical injuries inflicted in a tumultuous affray must be one or

Acts punishable as giving assistance to suicide.

1.

By assisting another to commit suicide, whether the suicide is
consummated or not.

2.

By lending his assistance to another to commit suicide to the
extent of doing the killing himself.

Only the one who used violence is liable.

Note that only those who used violence are punished, because if
the one who caused the physical injuries is known, he will be liable
for the physical injuries actually committed (Arts. 263, 265, and 266),
and not under this article.
Are slight physical injuries included?

There is no clear provision for slight physical injuries in a
tumultuous affray. The second paragraph mentions physical injuries
of a less serious nature. It seems that they refer to less serious physical
injuries.

It will be noted that the penalty for physical injuries inflicted
in a tumultuous affray is one degree lower than that provided for
the physical injuries so inflicted. (Art. 252, par. 1) Even in homicide
caused in a tumultuous affray, the penalty is one degree lower than
that provided for homicide. (Art. 251, par. 1)

one degree lower for crimes committed during a tumultuous affray,

killing himself, and the suicide is not consummated, the penalty of
arresto mayor in its medium and maximum periods mentioned in the

in performing acts to do the killing himself, should be imposed
depending upon whether it is frustrated or it is attempted suicide

What is the penalty for giving assistance to suicide, if the offender
is the father, mother, child, or spouse of the one committing
suicide?
Article 253 does not distinguish and does not make any reference
to the relation of the offender with the person committing suicide.
Hence, the penalty would be the same as that provided in said
article.
A person who attempts to commit suicide is not criminally liable.

A person who attempts to commit suicide is not criminally liable,
because society has always considered a person who attempts to kill
himself as an unfortunate being, a wretched person more deserving
of pity rather than of penalty.
Is a pregnant woman, who tried to commit suicide by means of
poison, but instead of dying, the fetus in her womb was expelled,
liable for abortion?

No. In order to incur criminal liability for the result not
intended, one must be committing a felony. (Art. 4, par. 1, R.P.C.)
An attempt to commit suicide is an act, but it is not punishable by
law. (Art. 3, R.P.C.) Article 253 does not penalize the person who
attempts to commit suicide. A woman who tries to commit suicide is
not committing a felony. She is, therefore, not liable for abortion for
expelling the fetus instead.
What Article 253 considers a felony or unlawful is assisting
another to commit suicide. Since attempting to commit suicide is
not an unlawful act within the meaning of Article 253, the pregnant
woman who suffers an abortion due to the poison she took to commit
suicide should not be held liable for the abortion that resulted.

What is more, the abortion that resulted is unintentional,
abortion not having been intended by her, and unintentional abortion
is punishable only when it is caused by violence, not by poison. (Art.
257)

Assistance to suicide Is different from mercy-killing.
commonly known as mercy-killing
Euthanasia

practice of painlessly putting to death a person suffering from some

Euthanasia is not lending assistance to suicide. In euthanasia,

Art. 254. Discharge of firearms. Any person who shall

unless the facts of the case are such that the act can be held
to constitute frustrated or attempted parricide, murder,
homicide, or any other crime for which a higher penalty is
prescribed by any of the articles of this Code.
Elements:

1.
2.

That the offender discharges a firearm against or at another
person.
That the offender has no intention to kill that person.

“Shall shoot at another.”

The act constituting the offense is shooting at another with any
firearm, without intent to kill him. If the firearm is not discharged at
a person, there is no crime of discharge of firearm.
Discharge towards the house of victim is not illegal discharge
of firearm.
The mere assertion of the offended party that the shot was
directed at the place in his house where he was, is not sufficient
proof that the shot was aimed or fired at him. It is essential for the
prosecution to prove in a positive way that the discharge of the firearm
was directed precisely against the offended party. (People u. Cupin,

is attempted homicide. (People v. Kalalo, et al., 59 Phil. 715)

The accused fired his gun at the door of the kitchen, and at the
wall of the house of the offended party. He did not know in what part
of the house the people inside were.

Complex crime of illegal discharge of firearm with serious or less
serious physical injuries.

Held: The acts committed by the accused constituted a violation
of Article 155, paragraph 1, for they were intended to cause alarm in
the place where the shots were fired, producing danger to the persons
in the house. (People v. Hinolan, CA., 47 O.G. 3596)

There must be no intention to kill.
If the discharge of the firearm at the offended party is coupled
with intent to kill him, the felony should be classified as frustrated
or attempted parricide, murder or homicide, and not merely illegal
discharge of firearm. This is so, because Article 254 states, “unless
the facts of the case are such that the act can be held to constitute
frustrated or attempted parricide, murder or homicide.”

If in the illegal discharge of firearm the offended party is hit
and wounded, there is a complex crime of discharge of firearm with
physical injuries when the physical injuries are serious or less serious.
(U.S. v. Marasigan, 11 Phil. 27; People v. Arquiza, 62 Phil. 611)
Note: When only slight physical injuries are inflicted, there is
no complex crime, because such physical injuries constitute a light
felony.

The crime is discharge of firearm, even if the gun was not pointed
at the offended party when it fired, as long as it was initially aimed
by the accused at or against the offended party.

1.

In discharge of firearm under Article 254, the purpose of the
offender is only to intimidate or to frighten the offended party.
Absent an intent to kill in firing the gun towards the victim,
petitioner should be held liable for the crime of illegal discharge of
firearm under Article 254 of the Revised Penal Code. (Dado v. People,
G.R. No. 131421, November 18, 2002)

2.

Intent to kill is negativedby distance of 200 yards between offender
and victim.
The distance of 200 meters was so great that it is difficult to
impute an intention on the part of the offender to kill the offended
party. The discharge was intended merely to frighten away the
offended party. The crime is only discharge of firearm. (People v.
Agbuya, 57 Phil. 238)

That a child was killed.

That the deceased child was less than three days (72 hours) of
age.

3.

That the accused killed the said child.

The accused, an unmarried woman, gave birth to a living child.
She hastily left the house, taking the infant with her. In a place
nearby, she buried the child. When the body was found, there was
an abrasion on both sides of the nose which might have been caused
by pressure exerted by another person. The death of the child might
have been due to suffocation. It was held that inasmuch as it was
born alive and in a healthy condition, it is not to be presumed, without
some just reason therefor, that it died a natural death within the
extremely short time that elapsed between its birth and its bunal.
The facts proven clearly revealed her decided intent to kill the newly
bom child in order to conceal her dishonor. (U.S. v.Vedra, 12 Phil. 96)

Concealing dishonor is not an element of Infanticide.
The purpose of concealing the dishonor is not an element of
infanticide; it merely mitigates the liability of the mother or maternal
grandparents who committed the crime.

meter deep.

Reason for the mitigation of the liability of the mother.

The child must be bom alive and fully developed, that is, it can
sustain an independent life. (U.S. v.Vedra, 12 Phil. 96) A fetus about
six months old cannot subsist by itself, outside the maternal womb.
(People v. Detablan, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 5, 30)

Viada says: “We understand that the responsibility of the mother
is mitigated when, right after giving birth to a baby bom out of an
illicit relationship, without time to reflect, excited and obfuscated
solely by the fear of her dishonor being made public, she desires to
erase the traces of her mistake. Within that same day, we understand
that obfuscation, but on the day following, or on the third day, when
that disgraced child has been taken by the mother on her lap, when
the warmth of maternal love from the mother’s breast has been
communicated to it, when it has been given a kiss on its innocent
cheek, honor cannot overcome filial love, a love which has no equal

on earth.”

Delinquent mother who claims concealing dishonor must be of

good reputation.

The delinquent mother must be of good reputation and good
morals, in order that concealing dishonor may mitigate her liability.
Thus, if she is a prostitute, she is not entitled to a lesser penalty
because she has no honor to conceal. (Albert)
Stranger cooperating with the mother In killing a child less than
three days old is guilty of infanticide also but the penalty is that
for murder.

A stranger who cooperates in the perpetration of infanticide
committed by the mother or grandparent on the mother’s side, is
liable for infanticide, but he must suffer the penalty prescribed for
murder. (U.S. v. Aquino, 34 Phil. 813)

Held: Since the crime consists in killing a child, the prosecution

must prove that the mother gave birth to a living creature. (U.S. u.

TITLE EIGHT
Crimes Against Persons

Fetus must die In consummated abortion.

If the fetus survives in spite of the attempt to kill it or the
of violence, abortion is not consummated. If abortion is intended uae
the fetus does not die, it is frustrated intentional abortion whenand
all
the acts of execution have been performed by the offender.
If abortion is not intended and the fetus does not die, in spite
of the violence intentionally exerted, the crime may be only physical
injuries. There is no frustrated unintentional abortion, in view of
the
lack of intention to cause an abortion.
In abortion, the fetus may be over or less than six months old.

Under the R.P.C., abortion ordinarily means the expulsion of
the fetus before the sixth month or before the term of its viability,
that is, capable of sustaining life.

But as long as the fetus dies as a result of the violence used or
the drugs administered, the crime of abortion exists, even if the fetus
is full term. (Viada, Vol. V, p. 12, 5th Ed.)
f

Ways of committing intentional abortion:

1.

By using any violence upon the person of the pregnant woman.

2.

By acting, but without using violence, without the consent of
the woman. (By administering drugs or beverages upon such
pregnant woman without her consent.)
By acting (by administering drugs or beverages), with the
consent of the pregnant woman.

3.

Elements of intentional abortion:
a. That there is a pregnant woman;
b.

c.

d.

That violence is exerted, or drugs or beverages administered,
or that the accused otherwise acts upon such pregnant woman;

That as a result of the use of violence or drugs or beverages
upon her, or any other act of the accused, the fetus dies, either
in the womb or after having been expelled therefrom;
That the abortion is intended.
644

Art. 256

Example of abortion by administering abortive.

A, believing that the child in the womb of a woman was a sort of
fish-demon, gave her a “pocion" made of herbs. Two hours thereafter,
she gave birth to a child three months in advance of the full period
of gestation. (U.S. v. Boston, 12 Phil. 134)
Persons liable for intentional abortion.
The person who intentionally caused the abortion is liable under
Article 256. The woman is liable under Article 258, if she consented
to the abortion caused on her. If she did not consent to the abortion
caused on her, she is not liable.

“If the woman shall have consented."
Article 256, No. 3, provides for the least penalty “if the woman
shall have consented” to the act causing the abortion. Is that provision
applicable if the act which caused the abortion was by using violence
and the woman consented to the abortion? The provision must be
construed in relation to that in No. 2 of Article 256, because the
absence of consent of the woman is mentioned in connection with a
case where the offender acted “without using violence.”

Abortion distinguished from infanticide.
A mother, who had aborted for taking “pociones amargas,’
buried near her house a living fetus. The expelled fetus had already
acquired a human form and about six months old. But it did not
have its own life, independently of the mother. It could not subsist by
itself, outside the maternal womb. It did not unite all the conditions
for legal viability. A fetus under these conditions had necessarily
to succumb a few moments after its expulsion from the maternal
womb.

Held: Abortion, not infanticide, was committed. If the fetus

(1) could sustain an independent life, after its separation from the
maternal womb, and it (2) is killed, the crime is infanticide. (See
People v. Detablan, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 5, 30)

Elements:

1.

That there is a pregnant woman.

2.

That violence is used upon such pregnant woman without
intending an abortion.

3.

That the violence is intentionally exerted.

4.

That as a result of the violence the fetus dies, either in the
womb or after having been expelled therefrom.

Unintentional abortion is committed only by violence.

It should be noted that the law employs the word “violence,” that
is, actual physical force.
Thus, where a man points a gun at a pregnant woman, at the
same time telling her that he will kill her, and because of the fright
she absorbs, she suffers an abortion, the offender is guilty of threats
only. (December Supreme Court of Spain of November 30, 1887)

The violence must be intentionally exerted.

The accused who struck a woman three months pregnant on
her hip with a bottle, causing hemorrhage and miscarriage was held
guilty of unintentional abortion. (U.S. v. Jeffrey, 15 Phil. 391) Note
that the violence consisting in striking the pregnant woman with a
bottle on the hip was intentionally exerted by the accused.

causing the horse drawing it to stumble; that as a result, the cochero and
the passengers of the calesa were thrown from their seats; that one of
the passengers, Caridad Palacio, who was then on the sixth month of her
pregnancy, bumped her abdomen against the front wall of the calesa when
she was thrown off her seat; that as a consequence of her fright and the
force with which she was thrown against the front wall of the calesa, she
had a momentary loss of consciousness; that on the evening of the accident
blood came out from Caridad Palacio’s vagina and she had to call a doctor
to examine and treat her; that the physician's diagnosis of her ailment was
threatened abortion; and that on January 21, 1951, or three days later, she
did have an abortion.

Held: The appellant Romeo Jose is hereby declared guilty of the crime
of unintentional abortion through reckless imprudence and sentenced to
suffer the penalty of two months and one day of arresto mayor, with costs.

Is the accused liable for abortion even if he did not know that the
woman was pregnant?

Even though it was not the criminal intent of the defendant
to cause the abortion, the fact that, without any apparent reason
whatever, he maltreated Teodorica Saguinsin, presumably not
knowing that she was pregnant, as author of the abuse which caused
the miscarriage, he is liable not only for such maltreatment but also
for the consequences thereof, to wit, for the abortion. (U.S. v. Jeffrey,
15 Phil. 394)
But the more decisive factor here is that it being established
by the prosecution itself that Luz being then only about two months
pregnant, which would mean that her condition was not noticeable
at all, and in the absence of a definite proof that Felipe knew of the
pregnancy, in his favor must be considered the uniform and well
reasoned decisions of the Spanish Supreme Court that for the crime
of abortion, even unintentional, to be held committed, the accused
must have known of the pregnancy. (People v. Carnaso, CA., 61

Mere boxing on the stomach, taken together with immediate
strangling of the victim in a fight, is not sufficient proof to show an
intent to cause an abortion. In fact, appellant must have merely
intended to kill the victim but not necessarily to cause an abortion.
Appellant should be held guilty of the complex crime of parricide
with unintentional abortion. (People v. Salufrania, 159 SCRA 401)

Unintentional abortion distinguished from infanticide.

In unintentional abortion, (1) there is a pregnant woman;
(2) violence is used upon such pregnant woman without intending an
abortion; (3) the violence is intentionally exerted; and (4) as a result
of the violence, the fetus dies, either in the womb or after having been
expelled therefrom. In the crime of infanticide, it is necessary that
the child be bom alive and be viable, that is, capable of independent
existence. (U.S. v. Vedra, 12 Phil. 96 [1909])
If a child is expelled prematurely and is bom alive but could
not sustain an independent life, the offense is abortion. fSee People

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Only the woman or any of her parents is liable under Article 258, if
the purpose of the latter is to conceal her dishonor.

Note that Article 258 covers three cases, namely:
1. Abortion committed by the woman upon herself or by any
other person with her consent, (par. 1)
2. Abortion by the woman upon herself to conceal her
dishonor, (par. 2)

3.

Abortion by any of the parents of the woman with the
latter’s consent to conceal her dishonor, (par. 3)

The person liable under paragraph 1 of Article 258 is the
woman only. The other person who caused the abortion on her
with her consent is liable under Article 256. If the purpose of
the parents of the woman was not to conceal her dishonor, the
case does not fall under Article 258, but under Article 256.

TITLE EIGHT
Crimes Against Persons

Art. 259

Art. 259. Abortion practiced by a physician or midwife and
dispensing of abortives. The penalties provided in Article
256 shall be imposed in its maximum period, respectively,
upon any physician or midwife who, taking advantage of their
scientific knowledge or skill, shall cause an abortion or assist
in causing the same.

—

Any pharmacist who, without the proper prescription
from a physician, shall dispense any abortive shall suffer
arresto mayor20 and a fine not exceeding One hundred
thousand pesos (P100.000). (As amended by RA. No. 10951)

Elements:

1.

That there is a pregnant woman who has suffered an abortion.

2.

That the abortion is intended.

Liability of pregnant woman is mitigated if purpose is to conceal
dishonor.

3.

That the offender, who must be a physician or midwife, causes,
or assists in causing, the abortion.

If the purpose of the pregnant woman is to conceal her dishonor,
the penalty is lower. (Art. 258, par. 2)

4.

That said physician or midwife takes advantage of his or her
scientific knowledge or skill.

The reason for the mitigated responsibility is that when a woman
becomes pregnant out of an illicit relationship, excited and obfuscated
by the fear of her dishonor being made public, she either practices
abortion upon herself or consents that any other person does so, to
erase the traces of her mistake.
No mitigation for parents of pregnant woman even if the purpose
is to conceal dishonor.

If committed by any of the parents of the pregnant woman and
with the consent of such woman to conceal her dishonor, the penalty
is the same as that for the woman who practiced abortion upon herself
without such purpose of concealing her dishonor. (See pars. 1 and 3
of Art. 258)

Penalty for intentional abortion Is imposed in its maximum period
on physician or midwife.

The penalties provided for intentional abortion (Art. 256) shall
be imposed in the maximum period upon the physician or midwife.
(Art. 259)

Reason for the maximum penalty.
Physicians and midwives who cause or assist in causing abortion
are more severely punished because they incur a heavier guilt in

making use of their knowledge for the destruction of human life,
where it should be used only for its preservation. (Albert)

There is no mitigation for the parents of the pregnant woman,
unlike in infanticide.

Crimea Against Persons

As to the pharmacists, the elements are:

1.

That the offender is a pharmacist.

2.

That there is no proper prescription from a physician.

3.

That the offender dispenses any abortive.

Duel, defined.

Duel is a formal or regular combat previously concerted between
two parties in the presence of two or more seconds of lawful age
on each side, who make the selection of arms and fix all the other
conditions of the fight.

Is it necessary that the pharmacist knows that the abortive
would
be used to cause an abortion?

This article does not require it. What is punished is the dispensing
of abortive without the proper prescription from a physician.
If he knew that the abortive would be used to cause an abortion
and abortion resulted from the use thereof, the pharmacist would be
an accomplice in the crime of abortion.

The act constituting the offense is dispensing abortive without
proper prescription from a physician. It is not necessary that the
abortive be actually used.

Section Three.

—

Acts punished in duel.

1.

By killing one’s adversary in a duel.

2.

By inflicting upon such adversary physical injuries.

3.

By making a combat although no physical injuries have been
inflicted.

Who are liable In a duel?

1.

The person who killed or inflicted physical injuries upon his
adversary, or both combatants in any other case, as principals.

2.

The seconds, as accomplices.

If death results, penalty is the same as that for homicide.

Duel

—

Art. 260. Responsibility of participants in a duel. The
penalty of reclusion temporal2' shall be imposed upon any
person who shall kill his adversary in a duel.
If he shall inflict upon the latter physical injuries only,
he shall suffer the penalty provided therefor, according to
their nature.
In any other case, the combatants shall suffer the penalty
of arresto mayor,23 although no physical injuries have been

inflicted.
The seconds shall in all events be punished as accomplices.

Note that the penalty for duel is reclusion temporal, the same
as that for homicide, if death resulted.
Must the penalty be that for physical injuries only when the
agreement is to fight to the death?

Article 260 makes no distinction and the rule is that “we must
not distinguish when the law makes no distinction.”
But the general principle is that when there is intent to kill,
the inflicting of physical injuries is either attempted or frustrated
homicide. The penalty for duel, when a person kills his adversary, is
the same as that for homicide, because when death results, the intent
to kill is conclusively presumed. When there is an agreement to fight
to the death, there is intent to kill on the part of the combatants.
However, the Code disregards the intent to kill in considering the
penalty for duel when only physical injuries are inflicted upon the
adversary.

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

But the penalty for slight physical injuries, as provided in
paragraph 1 of Article 266, is arresto menor. Which penalty should
be imposed in case a person inflicted upon his adversary in a duel
slight physical injuries?

It is believed that the second paragraph of Article 260 should
apply and the penalty of arresto menor, not arresto mayor, should
be imposed.
The third paragraph of Article 260 applies only when no physical

injuries are inflicted by either of the combatants on the other, in which

case, both combatants shall be punished by arresto mayor.

Art. 261. Challenging to a duel. The penalty of prision
correctional in its minimum period23 shall be imposed upon
any person who shall challenge another, or incite another to
give or accept a challenge to a duel, or shall scoff at or decry
another publicly for having refused to accept a challenge to
fight a duel.

Not challenging to a duel.
Nursing ill-feelings and moved by hatred, the accused challenged
the offended party to a duel, inciting the latter to accept said challenge
by uttering: “Come down, let us measure your prowess, we shall see
whose intestine will come out. You are a coward if you do not come
down.” The offended party refused to come down and accept the
challenge. Later, when the accused saw the offended party running
toward a nearby house, the former ran after the latter, but desisted
upon seeing that the offended party had a companion.

Held: This is not challenging to a duel, but only light threats
under Article 285, paragraph 2. (People v. Tacomoy, G.R. No. L-4798,
July 16, 1951)
Persons responsible under Article 261 are:

Crimes Against Persons

Two kinds of mutilation:

Chapter Two

PHYSICAL INJURIES

1.

By intentionally mutilating another by depriving him, either
totally or partially, of some essential organ for reproduction.

2.

By intentionally making other mutilation, that is, by lopping
or clipping off any part of the body of the offended party, other
than the essential organ for reproduction, to deprive him of
that part of his body.

What are the crimes of physical injuries?

Elements of mutilation of the first kind:

They are:
1.

Mutilation. (Art. 262)

2.

Serious physical injuries. (Art. 263)

3.

Administering injurious substance or beverages. (Art 264)

4.

Less serious physical injuries. (Art. 265)

5.

Slight physical injuries and maltreatment. (Art. 266)

—

Art. 262. Mutilation. The penalty of reclusion temporal
to reclusion perpetua' shall be imposed upon any person who
shall intentionally mutilate another by depriving him, either
totally or partially, of some essential organ for reproduction.
Any other intentional mutilation shall be punished by
prision mayor in its medium and maximum periods.1

Mutilation, defined.

The term “mutilation” means the lopping or the clipping off of
some part of the body.

The putting out of an eye does not fall under this definition.
Thus, when a robber stabbed a woman in one eye, and as a result
of the wound thus inflicted she lost the use of the eye, there is no
mutilation. (U.S. v. Bogel, 7 Phil. 285)
‘See Appendix “A," Table of Penalties, No. 32.
2See Appendix “A,” Table of Penalties, No. 24.
656

1.

That there be a castration, that is, mutilation of organs
necessary for generation, such as the penis or ovarium.

2.

That the mutilation is caused purposely and deliberately, that
is, to deprive the offended party of some essential organ for
reproduction. (Guevara)

Mutilation of the first kind is castration which must be made
purposely.
Clearly it is the intention of the law to punish any person
who shall intentionally deprive another of any organ necessary for
reproduction. An applicable construction, is that of Viada in the
following language:

“At the head of these crimes, according to their order of
gravity, is the mutilation known by the name of ‘castration’
which consists of the amputation of whatever organ is necessary
for generation. The law could not fail to punish with the utmost
severity such a crime, which, although not destroying life,
deprives a person of the means to transmit it. But bear in mind
that according to this article in order for ‘castration’ to exist,
it is indispensable that the ‘castration’ be made purposely. The
law does not look only to the result but also to the intention
of the act. Consequently, if by reason of an injury or attack, a
person is deprived of the organs of generation, the act, although
voluntary, not being intentional to that end, it would not come
under the provisions of this article, but under No. 2 of Article
431.’’ (Art. 263; Viada, Codigo Penal, Vol. 3, p. 70. See to same
effect, 4 Groizard, Codigo Penal, p. 525, cited in U.S. v. Esparcia,
36 Phil. 840)

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Vasectomy is not mutilation.

TITLE EIGHT
Crimes Against Persons

Art. 263. Serious physical injuries.

Though undeniably, vasectomy denies a man his power of
reproduction, such procedure does not deprive him, “either totally
or partially, of some essential organ for reproduction.” Notably, the
ordinary usage of the term “mutilation” is the deprivation of a limb
or essential part (of the body), with the operative expression being
“deprivation." In the same manner, the word “castration” is defined as
the removal of the testies or ovaries. Such being the case, the bilateral
vasectomy done on Larry could not have amounted to the crime of
mutilation as defined and punished under Article 262, paragraph 1,
of the Revised Penal Code. (Aguirre v. Secretary of Justice, G.R. No.
170723, March 3, 2008)
“Any other intentional mutilation.”

If the mutilation involves a part of the body, other than an organ
for reproduction, such as the cutting of the outer ear or arm of the
offended party, with a deliberate purpose of depriving him of that
part of his body, it is other intentional mutilation, under the second
paragraph of Article 262.

“Mayhem” is other intentional mutilation.
Penalty when the victim of other intentional mutilation is under 12
years of age.

The penalty for Article 262, paragraph 2 (other intentional
mutilation) shall be reclusion perpetua when the victim is under 12
years of age. (Sec. 10, R.A. No. 7610)

The offender must have the intention to deprive the offended
party of a part of his body.
If a mutilation is not caused purposely and deliberately so as
to deprive the offended party of a particular part of his body, the
case will be considered as physical injuries falling under Article 263,
paragraph 1 (offended party becoming impotent) or paragraph 2 (loss
of hand, foot, arm, or leg), as the case may be.

What are serious physical Injuries?
They are:
1.

—

(1)

by wounding;

(2)

by beating, or

(3)

by assaulting (Art. 263); or

(4)

by administering injurious substance. (Art. 264)

The accused, while conversing with the offended party, drew the
latter’s bolo from its scabbard. The offended party caught hold of the
edge of the blade of his bolo and wounded himself.

Held: Since the accused did not wound, beat, or assault the
offended party, he cannot be guilty of serious physical injuries. (U.S.
v. Villanueva, 31 Phil. 412)
May be committed by reckless imprudence, or by simple imprudence
or negligence.

A person may be guilty of lesiones by reckless imprudence, or
by simple imprudence or negligence under Article 365 in relation
to Article 263, when due to lack of precaution he wounded another.

an arm, or a leg, or (b) loses the use of any such member,
or (c) becomes incapacitated for the work in which he
was theretofore habitually engaged, in consequence of the
physical injuries inflicted.

Loss of power to hear.

PARAGRAPH 1: INJURED PERSON BECOMES INSANE,
IMBECILE, IMPOTENT, OR BLIND

It must be loss of power to hear of both ears. If there is loss of
power to hear of one ear only, it is serious physical injuries under
paragraph 3 of Article 263. (People v. Hernandez, 94 Phil. 49)

Meaning of the term "impotent”

Loss of use of hand or incapacity for usual work must be permanent

In medical jurisprudence, impotence means inability to copulate.
Properly used for the male; but it also has been used synonymously
with “sterility.” (Smith v. Smith, 206 Mo. App. 646, 229, S.W. 398;
Heinemann v. Heinemann, 118 Or. 178, 245, p. 1082, 1083, cited in
Black’s Law Dictionary, 4th Ed., p. 889)

During the trial, offended party Eleuterio Macayan tried to
prove that as a result of the injury on his left wrist, he permanently
lost the use of it “because the fingers are paralyzed, the fingers lose
their flexibility.” Article 263, paragraph 2, presupposes that the loss
of the use of the hand or the incapacity for usual work is permanent.
Offended party’s uncorroborated testimony does not sufficiently
establish that the loss of the use of his left hand is lasting and
permanent. Even if he could not use his left hand during the trial, it
does not necessary follow that he has forever lost the use thereof. It is
possible that he might later on regain its use. No expert testimony was
presented to show that the nature of Eleuterio Macayan’s injury was
such that he has permanently lost the use of his left hand by reason
thereof. In order to sustain a conviction under the aforementioned
provision of law, the prosecution must prove by clear and conclusive
evidence that the offended party actually cannot make use of his hand
and that such impairment is permanent. The act committed by the
defendant constitutes the crime of serious physical injuries defined
and penalized under paragraph 3, Article 263 of the R.P.C. (People
v. Rell, CA„ 53 O.G. 5695)

Since the effect is the same: loss of power to procreate, the term
impotent should include inability to copulate and sterility.
Penalty when the victim of serious physical injuries under paragraph
1 is under 12 years of age.

The penalty for Article 262, paragraph 1 shall be reclusion
perpetua when the victim is under 12 years of age. (Sec. 10, R.A. No.
7610)

Blindness and loss of an eye.

Under paragraph 1, the blindness must be of two eyes.
Under paragraph 2, note the loss of an eye only.

According to Cuello Calon (II Codigo Penal, 10th Ed., pp. 515516), the blindness must be complete. Mere weakness of vision is not

contemplated.

All those mentioned in paragraph 2 are principal members of the
body.

All those mentioned in paragraph 2 of this article are principal

Paragraph 3 covers any member which is not principal member of
the body.

The phrase “any other part of his body” in paragraph 3 of this
article should be “any other member,” meaning any member other
than an eye, a hand, a foot, an arm, or a leg, which are mentioned in
paragraph 2. (People v. Balubar, 60 Phil. 699)
The fingers of the hand are not principal members. The loss of
the use of three fingers of a left hand is serious physical injuries under
paragraph 3 of Article 263. But if it is alleged in the information and
proved that the loss of the use of the three fingers also resulted in the
loss of the use of the hand itself, it is serious physical injuries under
paragraph 2 of said article. (U.S. v. Punsalan, 23 Phil. 375)
It is a serious physical injury when the offended party becomes
deformed.
Deformity, defined.

By deformity it is meant physical ugliness, permanent and
definite abnormality. It must be conspicuous and visible.
Deformity requires that it be

—

(a)

physical ugliness,

(b)

(c)

664

Art. 263

the jaw, constitutes deformity within the meaning of paragraph 3 of

this article.

Loss of teeth as deformity.

The loss of three incisors is a visible deformity, while the loss of
one incisor does not constitute deformity according to the Supreme

Court of Spain. (Guevara)

Deformity by loss of teeth refers to injury which cannot be repaired
by the action of nature.

The accused struck the injured party in the mouth with the iron
instrument used for turning the engine of a motor truck, causing the
loss of four front teeth.
The injury contemplated by the Code is an injury that cannot be
repaired by the action of nature. The fact that the offended party may
have artificial teeth, if he has the necessary means and so desires,
does not repair the injury, although it may lessen the disfigurement.
The case of a child or an old man is an exception to the rule. (People
v. Balubar, 60 Phil. 699)
Loss of one tooth which impaired appearance Is deformity.

The crime committed falls under subdivision 3 of Article 263
in view of the uncontroverted loss of Duremdes’ left upper central
incisor which loss was visible and impaired his appearance, and
which disfigurement could not be removed by the action of nature.
(People v. Lagrosas, CA., 61 O.G. 6519, citing the case of People v.
Balubar, 60 Phil. 698)
In an earlier case, it was held that the breakage of an incisor
does not constitute deformity. (People v. Cambel, CA-G.R. No. 6054,
November 28, 1940)
A front tooth is a member of the body.

A front tooth is a member of the body, other than a principal
member, within the meaning of the words, “or shall have lost any

other member," as used in Subsection 3 of Article 263 of the Revised
Penal Code. (People v. Balubar, 60 Phil. 707)
Hence, the loss of a front tooth due to a fist blow is serious
physical injury under paragraph 3 of Article 263.
Loss of both outer ears constitutes deformity and also loss of the
power to hear.

Since the loss of two ears caused the deafness of the injured
party, the defendants who cut offboth ears of the offended party are
guilty of serious physical injuries. (U.S. v. Maflaul, et al., 4 Phil. 342)

Note: The loss of the outer ears will necessarily cause deformity.
If there is loss of power to hear of both ears as a result of the loss of
both outer ears, the crime should be punished under paragraph 2 of
Article 263.
Loss of the lobule of the ear is deformity.

The accused held the offended party by the hair, dragged her
along the ground, and then bit her left ear.

Held: The offended party was permanently disfigured because of
the loss of the lobule of the left ear. (U.S. v. Solis, et al., 4 Phil. 178)
Loss of index and middle fingers is either deformity or loss of a
member, not principal one, of his body or use of same.

The accused struck with his bolo the offended party, severing
the index and middle fingers of his right hand. The offended party
was not rendered incapable of working in the fields, his occupation,
with the loss of his said fingers.

Held: The offended party lost a member, not principal one, of his
body or the use of the same and was also deformed. (U.S. v. Bugarin,
15 Phil. 189)
Loss of power to hear of right ear only is loss of use of other part
of body.

Loss “of the power to hear* is surely a serious physical injury.
But is the loss“of the power to hear of his right ear* a loss of the power

oca
ooo

Art. 263

to hear? As the offended party may still hear through his left ear, it
would seem he has not lost the power to hear. However, Article 263,
paragraph 3, prescribes prision correccional in its minimum and
medium periods if the person injured shall have lost “the use of
any other part of his body.” The offended party was deprived of the
use of his right ear, a part of his body. (People v. Hernandez, 94

Phil. 49)
Illness as a consequence of physical injuries inflicted.

The words “ill” and “illness” are used in paragraphs Nos. 3 and
4, respectively, of Article 263. There is illness for a certain period
of time, when the wound inflicted did not heal within that period.
(People v. Penesa, 81 Phil. 403)
In determining incapacity, must the injured party have an avocation
at the time of the injury?

In paragraph 2 of this article, note that the incapacity of
the offended party refers to the work “in which he was theretofore
habitually engaged.”
So also in paragraph 3, which speaks of “incapacitated for the
performance of the work in which he was habitually engaged.”
In these two paragraphs, at least, the offended party must have
an avocation or work at the time of the injury.
The term “work” includes studies or preparation for a profession.
Incapacity for a certain kind of work only, but not for all, is a
serious physical injury under paragraph 2 or paragraph 3 of this
article.
In the case of U.S. v. Bugarin, 16 Phil. 189, it is said that the
incapacity must show that the physical injury has rendered the
offended party incapable of working in the fields which was the
occupation in which at the time he had been habitually engaged.
When the injured man did not recover so as to be able to attend
to his ordinary avocation for a period of a little more than 30 days,
the case falls under Article 263, paragraph 4. (U.S. u. Sy Vinco, 5

Phil. 47)

PARAGRAPH 4: INJURED PERSON BECOMES ILL OR
INCAPACITATED FOR LABOR FOR

The Court cannot share the view of the trial court that despite
the absence of evidence the appellant should be found guilty of serious
physical injuries. In a prosecution for this crime where the category
of the offense and the severity of the penalty depend on the period of
illness or incapacity for labor, the length of this period must likewise
be proved beyond reasonable doubt in much the same manner as
the main act charged. (People v. Codilia, CA-G.R. No. 4079-R, June
26, 1950) And when, as in the case at bar, proof of the said period is
absent, the crime committed should be deemed only as slight physical
injuries. (People v. De los Santos, CA., 59 O.G. 4393, citing People u.
Penesa, 81 Phil. 398; People v. Sarmiento, et al., CA-G.R. No. 3784-R,
July 28, 1950)

Art. 263

MORE THAN 30 DAYS

Paragraph 4 speaks of Incapacity for any kind of labor.
The fourth paragraph of this article does not refer to labor in
which the offended party is engaged at the time the serious physical
injuries are inflicted. Hence, the incapacity is for any kind of labor.
Injury requiring hospitalization for more than 30 days is serious
physical Injuries.

The leg injury inflicted on the victim required hospitalization
for more than 30 days. Said physical injury is covered by paragraph
4 of Article 263 of the Revised Penal Code. (People v. Moro Ali, et al.,
GJi. No. L-7431, May 30, 1958, 103 Phil. 1166)

Note: Hospitalization for more than 30 days may mean either
illness or incapacity for labor for more than 30 days.
In a case, months after the offense occurred, the injury to the
offended party’s left eye has not been entirely cured. This is illness
for more than 30 days and the case falls under paragraph 4 of Article
263. (People v. De Castro, G.R. No. 41606, April 29, 1935)

Note: It would seem that if the injury would require medical
attendance for more than 30 days, the illness of the offended party
may be considered as lasting for more than 30 days. The fact that
there was medical attendance for that period of time shows that the
injuries were not cured for that length of time.
Medical attendance is not important in serious physical injuries.

It is to be noted that paragraph 4, Article 263, requires illness
or incapacity for labor, not medical attendance. (People v. Obia, CA.,
45 O.G. 2568) In other paragraphs of Article 263, medical attendance
is not also mentioned.
When the category of the offense of serious physical injuries
depends on the period of illness or incapacity for labor, there must
be evidence of the length of that period; otherwise, the offense is only
slight physical injuries.
668

Art. 263

Lessening of efficiency due to injury is not incapacity.

There is no incapacity if the injured party could still engage in
his work although less effectively than before. (U.S. v. Bugarin, supra)
Ordinary physical injuries, distinguished from mutilation.

The mutilation must have been caused purposely and deliberately
to lop or clip off some part of the body so as to derive the offended
party of such part of the body; this special intention is not present in
the other kinds of physical injuries.
Qualified serious physical injuries.

If the offense is committed against any of the persons
enumerated in the article defining the crime of parricide (Art. 246)
or with the attendance of any of the circumstances mentioned in the
article defining the crime of murder (Art. 248), the law provides higher
penalties. (Art. 263, paragraph next to the last)
Serious physical injuries by excessive chastisement by parents
are not qualified.
The penalties referred to in the paragraph next to the last of
Article 263 are not to be imposed on a parent who inflicted physical
injuries upon his child by excessive chastisement. (Art. 263, last
paragraph)

Art. 264. Administering injurious substances or beverages.
The penalties established by the next preceding article
shall be applicable in the respective case to any person who,
without intent to kill, shall inflict upon another any serious
physical injury, by knowingly administering to him any
injurious substances or beverages or by taking advantage of
his weakness of mind or credulity.

“Weakness of mind or credulity”
“By taking advantage of his weakness of mind or credulity” may

Elements:
1.

That the offender inflicted upon another any serious physical
injury.

2.

That it was done by knowingly administering to him any
injurious substances or beverages or by taking advantage of
his weakness of mind or credulity.

3.

Art. 265

Crimes Against Persons

That he had no intent to kill.

It is frustrated murder when there is intent to kill.

If the offender had any intention to kill, the crime would be

frustrated murder, the injurious substance to be considered as poison.
“By knowingly administering to him any injurious substances.”

If the accused did not know of the injurious nature of the
substances he administered, he is not liable under this article.
Administering injurious substance means introducing into the body
the substance.

The infliction of injuries by throwing mordant chemicals or
poisons on the face or upon the body is not contemplated in this article,
because that is not “administering" injurious substance or beverage.
(U.S. v. Chiong Songco, 18 Phil. 459)
Article 264 does not apply when the physical Injuries that result are
less serious or slight.

If as a result of administering injurious substance, only less
serious or slight physical injuries are inflicted, they will be treated
under Article 265 or Article 266, as the case may be.
670

Any person

who shall inflict upon another physical injuries not described
in the preceding articles, but which shall incapacitate the
offended party for labor for ten (10) days or more, or shall
require medical attendance for the same period, shall be guilty
of less serious physical injuries and shall suffer the penalty

of arresto mayor.* 11

Whenever less serious physical injuries shall have been
inflicted with the manifest intent to insult or offend the
injured person, or under circumstances adding ignominy
to the offense, in addition to the penalty of arresto mayor a
fine not exceeding Fifty thousand pesos (P50.000) shall be
imposed.
Any less serious physical injuries inflicted upon the
offender’s parents, ascendants, guardians, curators, teachers,
or persons of rank, or persons in authority, shall be punished
by prision correctional in its minimum and medium periods,11
provided that, in the case of persons in authority, the deed
does not constitute the crime of assault upon such persons.
(As amended by RA. No. 10951)
Matters to be noted In the crime of less serious physical injuries.
1. That the offended party is incapacitated for labor for 10 days or
more (but not more than 30 days), or needs medical attendance
for the same period of time.

Medical attendance or incapacity is required in less serious physical
injuries.

The law includes two subdivisions, dealing with (1) the inability
for work, and (2) the necessity for medical attendance. So that
although the wound required medical attendance for only two days;
yet if the injured party was prevented from attending to his ordinary
labor for a period of 29 days, the physical injuries are denominated
less serious. (U.S. v. Trinidad, 4 Phil. 152)

more than 30 days and, hence, the crime is serious physical injuries
under paragraph 4, Article 263. (See People v. De Castro, supra)
“Or shall require medical attendance for the same period.”
Does the phrase “shall require" refer to the nature of the wound
or ipjury inflicted or to the actual medical attendance?

Suppose, A inflicted on B physical injuries which did not
incapacitate the latter for labor. B did not apply any medicine to his
wounds, but they were healed in 14 days. Is A liable for less serious
physical injuries? It will be noted that no medical attendance was
given to B, although the nature of the wounds required it. It is believed
that the phrase“shall require’ refers to the actual medical attendance.
There must be proof as to the period of the required medical attendance.
(People v. Penesa, 81 Phil. 398)

—

Her injury comes under the provisions of Article 265, inasmuch
as she was treated for only 13 days, and there is no evidence that
she was given further medical attendance, granting that it took more
than 13 days for the fracture to heal. She was not incapacitated for
the performance of the work in which she was habitually engaged.
(People v. Anastacio, CA., 55 O.G. 5047)

Art 266. Slight physical injuries and maltreatment. The
crime of slight physical injuries shall be punished:
1. By arresto menor when the offender has inflicted
physical injuries which shall incapacitate the offended party
for labor from one (1) to nine (9) days, or shall require medical
attendance during the same period;
2. By arresto menor or a fine not exceeding Forty

Art. 266

Example of slight physical injury by Ill-treatment

Three kinds of slight physical injuries:

1.

Physical injuries which incapacitated the offended party for
labor from one to nine days, or required medical attendance
during the same period.

2.

Physical injuries which did not prevent the offended party from
engaging in his habitual work or which did not require medical

attendance.
3.

Ill-treatment of another by deed without causing any injury.

Some hours after nine days, not amounting to 10 days.

A physical injury which incapacitates the offended party from
working for nine days and some hours without amounting to 10 days,
is a slight physical injury-

Any physical violence which does not produce injury, such as
slapping the face of the offended party, without causing a dishonor.

Supervening event converting the crime into serious physical
injuries after the filing of the information for slight physical injuries
can still be the subject of a new charge.

Where the charge contained in the original information was
for slight physical injuries because at that time, the fiscal believed
that the wound suffered by the offended party would require medical
attendance for a period of only eight days, but when the preliminary
investigation was conducted by the justice of the peace, he found
that the wound would heal after 30 days, the act which converted
the crime into a more serious one had supervened after the filing of
the original information and this supervening event can still be the
subject of amendment or of a new charge without necessarily placing
the accused in double jeopardy. (People v. Manolong, 85 Phil. 829)

Section 3(a) of R.A. No. 9262 punishes “any act or series of acts”
that constitutes violence against women. This means that a single act
of harassment, which translates into violence, would be enough. The
object of the law is to protect women and children. Punishing only
violence that is repeatedly committed would license isolated ones.
The naked woman on the picture, her legs spread open and
bearing Irish’s head and face, was clearly an obscene picture and, to
Irish a revolting and offensive one. Surely, any woman like Irish, who
is not in the pornography trade, would be scandalized and pained if
she sees herself in such a picture. What makes it further terrifying is
that, as Irish testified, Rustan sent the picture with a threat to post it
in the internet for all to see. That must have given her a nightmare.

20, 2010)
The offender need not be related to the victim by marriage.

The offender need not be related or connected to the victim by
marriage or former marriage, as he could be someone who has or had
a sexual or dating relationship only or has a common child with the
victim. (Reyes v. People, G.R. No. 232678, July 3, 2019)

TITLE EIGHT
Crimes Against Persons

Art. 266

VAWC may be committed by a woman.

VAWC may be committed “against a woman with whom the
person has or had a sexual or dating relationship.” Clearly, the use of
the gender-neutral word “person” who has or had a sexual or dating

relationship with the woman encompasses even lesbian relationships.
(Garcia u. Drilon, G.R. No. 179267, June 25, 2013)
Dating relationship exists even without sexual intercourse.

R.A. No. 9262 provides in Section 3 that “violence against

women x x x refers to any act or a series of acts committed by any

person against a woman x x x with whom the person has or had a
sexual or dating relationship.” Clearly, the law itself distinguishes a
sexual relationship from a dating relationship. Indeed, Section 3(e)

above defines “dating relationship” while Section 3(f) defines “sexual
relations.” The latter “refers to a single sexual act which may or may
not result in the bearing of a common child.” The dating relationship
that the law contemplates can, therefore, exist even without a sexual
intercourse taking place between those involved. (Rustan Ang v. CA.,
supra)

Punishable acts under R.A. No. 9262 refer to all acts of violence
against women with whom the offender has or had a sexual or dating
relationship.
While it is required that the offender has or had a sexual or
dating relationship with the offended woman for R.A. No. 9262
to be applicable, it is not indispensable that the act of violence
be a consequence of such relationship. Nowhere in the law can
such limitation be inferred. Hence, applying the rule on statutory
construction that when the law does not distinguish, neither should
the courts, then, clearly, the punishable acts refer to all acts of violence
against women with whom the offender has or had a sexual or dating
relationship. It is immaterial whether the relationship had ceased
for as long as there is sufficient evidence showing the past or present
existence of such relationship between the offender and the victim
when the physical harm was committed. (Dabalos u. RTC, Branch

Deprivation or denial of financial support may be penalized under
Sections 5(e) and 5(i) of R.A. No. 9262.

Criminal liability for violation of Sections 5(e) of R.A. 9262
attaches when the accused deprives the victim of financial support
which she is legally entitled to. Deprivation or denial of support,
by itself, is already specifically penalized therein. On the other
hand, psychological violence is committed against the victim when
the accused deprives her of financial support which causes her to
experience mental and emotional suffering. (See Reyes v. People,

Protection Orders that may be issued.
1.

Barangay Protection Orders (BPOs) - BPOs refer to the
protection order issued by the Punong Barangay ordering the
perpetrator to desist from causing physical harm to the woman
or her child and threatening to cause the woman or her child
physical harm. (Sec. 14)

2.

Temporary Protection Orders (TPOs) - TPOs refer to the
protection order issued by the court on the date of filing of the
application after ex parte determination that such order should
be issued. A TPO shall be effective for 30 days.
The court shall schedule a hearing on the issuance of a
PPO prior to or on the date of the expiration of the TPO. (Sec.

supra)

Where no evidence was presented to show that deprivation of
financial support caused the victims any mental or emotional anguish,
the accused cannot be convicted of violation of Section 5(i) of R.A.
No. 9262. This notwithstanding and taking into consideration the
variance doctrine which allows the conviction of an accused for a
crime proved which is different from but necessarily included in the
crime charged - the accused may be convicted of violation of Section
5(e) of R.A. No. 9262 as the deprivation or denial of support, by itself
and even without the additional element of psychological violence,
is already specifically penalized therein. (Melgar v. People, G.R. No.
223477, February 14, 2018)
Illegitimate children are entitled to support if filiation Is admitted
or proved.

If filiation is not admitted or acknowledged, the child’s mother
must first establish the filiation of the child in a proper action to be
entitled to legal support. Since the petitioner’s demand for support for
her son is based on her claim that he is respondent’s illegitimate child,
the latter is not entitled to such support if he had not acknowledged
him, until petitioner shall have proved his relation to him. The
child’s remedy is to file through his mother a judicial action against
respondent for compulsory recognition. If filiation is beyond question,
support follows as matter of obligation. In short, illegitimate children
are entitled to support and successional rights but their filiation must
be duly proved. (Dolina v. Vallecera, G.R. No. 182367, December 15,

Permanent Protection Orders (PPO) - PPO refers to
protection order issued by the court after notice and hearing.

A PPO shall be effective until revoked by a court upon application
of the person in whose favor the order was issued.
The court shall not deny the issuance of protection order on the
basis of the lapse of time between the act of violence and the filing
of the application.

Regardless of the conviction or acquittal of the respondent, the
Court must determine whether or not the PPO shall become final.
Even in a dismissal, a PPO shall be granted as long as there is no
clear showing that the act from which the order might arise did not
exist. (Sec. 16)

Parents-in-law may be included In a Petition for the Issuance of a
Protective Order under R.A. No. 9262.
While Section 3 of RA. No. 9262 provides that the offender be
related or connected to the victim by marriage, former marriage, or
a sexual or dating relationship, it does not preclude the application
of the principle of conspiracy under the Revised Penal Code (R.P.C.).
It must be further noted that Section 5 of R.A. No. 9262 expressly
recognizes that the acts of violence against women and their children
may be committed by an offender through another. In addition, the

Being under the influence of alcohol, any illicit drug, or any
other mind-altering substance shall not be a defense under R.A. No.

Battered Woman Syndrome as a defense.

Victim-survivors who are found by the courts to be suffering
from battered woman syndrome do not incur any criminal and civil
liability notwithstanding the absence of any of the elements for
justifying circumstances of self-defense under the Revised Penal Code.

In the determination of the state of mind of the woman who
was suffering from battered woman syndrome at the time of the
commission of the crime, the courts shall be assisted by expert
psychiatrists/psychologists. (Sec. 26)

Persons intervening exempt from liability.

In every case of VAWC, any person, private individual or police

responds or intervenes without using violence or restraint greater
than necessary to ensure the safety of the victim, shall not be liable
for any criminal, civil or administrative liability resulting therefrom.

to rape by sexual assault, also called “instrument or object rape,” or
“gender-free rape.” It must be attended by any of the circumstances

In the first mode, rape is committed through penile penetration
of the vagina, while the second is committed by inserting
the penis into another person’s mouth or anal orifice, or any
instrument or object into the genital or anal orifice of another
person; and
The penalty for rape under the first mode is higher than that
under the second. (People v. Abulon, 557 Phil. 454 [2007])

When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise

By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of

When the woman is under 12 years of age or demented.

Two modes of committing rape under R.A. No. 8353.

The enactment of R.A. No. 8353 or the Anti-Rape Law of 1997,
revolutionized the concept of rape with the recognition of sexual
violence on “sex-related” orifices other than woman’s organ is included
in the crime of rape; and the crime’s expansion to cover gender-free
rape. The transformation mainly consisted of the reclassification
of rape as a crime against persons and the introduction of ‘rape by
sexual assault’ as differentiated from the traditional ‘rape through
carnal knowledge’ or ‘rape through sexual intercourse. Thus, under
the new provision, rape can be committed in two ways: (1) Article
266-A, paragraph 1 refers to rape through sexual intercourse, also
690

4.

Who can commit rape?

Under R.A. No. 8353, the crime of rape can now be committed
by a male or a female. Before its amendment, rape could only be
committed by a male person. A woman can be a principal by direct
participation in rape under the first mode of committing rape provided
that a man is charged with her while “any person” can commit rape
under the second mode of committing rape.
A woman can ba a principal by direct participation in rape under
the first mode.

Under Article 17 of the Revised Penal Code, an accused may be
considered a principal by direct participation, by inducement, or by
indispensable cooperation. This is true in a charge of rape against a
woman, provided of course a man is charged together with her. Thus,
in two cases this Court convicted the woman as a principal by direct
participation since it was proven that she held down the complainant
in order to help her co-accused spouse consummate the offense.

TITLE EIGHT
Crimes Against Persons

In People v. Villamala, No. L-41312, July 29, 1997, 78 SCRA
145, the Court found the husband and wife guilty for raping their
neighbor and "kumare” in this factual setting, viz: the wife visited the
victim at her home on the pretext of inquiring as to the whereabouts
of her husband. Once inside, she whistled for her husband and he
immediately appeared at the doorstep. The wife then suddenly
pinned her “kumare” to the floor. The husband forcefully removed
the victim’s skirt and panties, removed his shorts, placed himself on
top of the victim and consummated the rape. In People v. Saba, G.R.
No. 110559, November 24, 1999, 319 SCRA 36, the accused married
couple victimized a 14-year-old epileptic who stayed at their home
for treatment by the wife who was a reputed healer. On the pretext
of conducting a healing session, the wife ordered the victim to lie
down on the floor then pinned the victim’s hands to the floor and
covered her mouth while her husband removed his pants and briefs
and the victim’s panties and raped the young girl. These two cases
show not only the possibility but the reality of rape committed by a
woman together with a man. (People u. de la Torre, GJi. No. 121213,
January 13, 2004)

the accused repeatedly tried, but in vain, to insert his penis into her
vagina and in all likelihood reached the labia of her pudendum as the
victim felt his organ on the lips of her vulva (People v. Bacalso, G.R.
195 SCRA 557 [1991]; People v. Hangdaan, 201 SCRA 568 [1991];
People v. De la Pena, 233 SCRA 573 [1994]; People v. Clopino, 290
SCRA 432 [1998]; People v. Quinanola, G.R. No. 126148, May 5, 1999)
or that the penis of the accused touched the middle part of her vagina.
(People v. Navarro, 221 SCRA 684 [1993])

Art. 266-B

PARAGRAPH 1: RAPE BY SEXUAL INTERCOURSE
The contact of the male penis with the woman’s vagina is referred
to as "rape by sexual intercourse.' (People v. Soriano, 388 SCRA 140,
[2002]; People v. Palma, 148869-74, December 11, 2003)
In rape under paragraph 1, there must be sexual Intercourse.
Penetration, even partial is necessary. The slightest penetration
is enough. Proof of emission is not necessary. (Miller, Criminal Law,
299; People v. Selfaison, et al., G.R. No. L-14732, January 28, 1961)
The absence of spermatozoa in the vagina does not negatle] rape.
(People v. Canastre, 82 Phil. 480)

In People v. De la Pena, 233 SCRA 573 (1994), the Supreme
Court clarified that the decisions finding a case for rape even if the
attacker’s penis merely touched the external portions of the female
genitalia were made in the context of the presence or existence of an
erect penis capable of full penetration. Where the accused failed to
achieve an erection, had a limp or flaccid penis, or an oversized penis
which could not fit into the victim’s vagina, the Court nonetheless held
that rape was consummated on the basis of the victim’s testimony that
692

Art 266-B

Thus, touching when applied to rape cases does not simply mean
mere epidermal contact, stroking or grazing of organs, a slight brush
or a scrape of the penis on the external layer of the victim’s vagina,
or the mons pubis, as in this case. There must be sufficient and
convincing proof that the penis indeed touched the labias or slid into
the female organ, and not merely stroked the external surface thereof,
for an accused to be convicted of consummated rape. The labias, which
are required to be “touched” by the penis, are by their natural situs
or location beneath the mons pubis or the vaginal surface, to touch
them with the penis is to attain some degree of penetration beneath
the surface, hence, the conclusion that touching the labia majora or
the labia minora of the pudendum constitutes consummated rape.

The pudendum or vulva is the collective term for the female
genital organs that are visible in the perineal area, e.g., mons pubis,
labia majora, labia minora, the hymen, the clitoris, the vaginal orifice,
etc. The mons pubis is the rounded eminence that becomes hairy after
puberty, and is instantly visible within the surface. The next layer
is the labia majora or the outer lips of the female organ composed of
the outer convex surface and the inner surface. The skin of the outer
convex surface is covered with hair follicles and is pigmented, while
the inner surface is a thin skin which does not have any hair but has
many sebaceous glands. Directly beneath the labia mqjora is the labia
minora. (Mishell, Stenchever, Droegemueller, Herbst, Comprehensive
Gynecology, 3rd Ed., 1997, pp. 42-44.)

Jurisprudence dictates that the labia majora must be entered
for rape to be consummated, and not merely for the penis to stroke
the surface of the female organ. Thus, a grazing of the surface of the
female organ or touching the mons pubis of the pudendum is not
sufficient to constitute consummated rape. Absent any showing of the
slightest penetration of the female organ, i.e., touching of either labia
of the pudendum by the penis, there can be no consummated rape;
693

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

at most, it can only be attempted rape, if not acts of lasciviousness.
(People v. Campuhan, G.R. No. 129433, March 30, 2000)

Exact date of sexual assault not an essential element of rape.
In rape cases, the material fact or circumstance to be considered
is the occurrence of the rape, not the time of its commission. The
date or time the rape was committed is not an essential ingredient
as it is the carnal knowledge through force and intimidation that
is the gravamen of the offense. It is, thus, sufficient that the date
of commission alleged is as near as possible to the actual date.
(People v. Ceredon, G.R. No. 167179, January 28, 2008, 542 SCRA
550, 571)

Art 266-B

If there is no sexual intercourse and only acts of lewdness are
performed, the crime may be rape through sexual assault under
paragraph 2 or acts of lasciviousness only under Article 336.
A broken hymen is not an essential element of rape.

A freshly broken hymen is not an essential element of rape. Even
the fact that the hymen of the victim was still intact does not rule
out the possibility of rape. Research in medicine even points out that
negative findings are of no significance, since the hymen may not be
torn despite repeated coitus. In any case, for rape to be consummated,
full penetration is not necessary. Penile invasion necessarily entails
contact with the labia. It suffices that there is proof of the entrance
of the male organ into the labia of the pudendum of the female organ.
Penetration of the penis by entry into the lips of the vagina, even
without rupture or laceration of the hymen, is enough to justify a
conviction for rape. (People v. Ortoa, G.R. No. 174484, February 23,
2009)

In People v. Gabayron (278 SCRA 78 [1997]), the conviction
of accused for rape was sustained even though the victim’s hymen
remained intact after the incidents because medical researches
show that negative findings of lacerations are of no significance, as
the hymen may not be torn despite repeated coitus. It was noted
that many cases of pregnancy had been reported about women with
unruptured hymens, and that there could still be a finding of rape
even if, despite repeated intercourse over a period of years, the victim
still retained an intact hymen without signs of injury.
In People v. Capt. Llanto (G.R. No. 146458, January 20, 2003),
citing People v. Aguinaldo (316 SCRA 819 [1999]), the conviction of the
accused for rape was affirmed despite the absence of laceration on the
victim’s hymen since medical findings suggest that it is possible for the
victim’s hymen to remain intact despite repeated sexual intercourse.
The Supreme Court elucidated that the strength and dilatability of
the hymen varies from one woman to another, such that it may be so
elastic as to stretch without laceration during intercourse; on the other
hand, it may be so resistant that its surgical removal is necessary
before intercourse can ensue.
694

Art. 266-B

The exact date of the sexual assault is not an essential element
of the crime of rape; what should control is the fact of the commission
of the rape or that there is proof of the penetration of the female
organ. (People v. Bunagan, G.R. No. 177161, June 30, 2008, 556
SCRA 808, 813)
Only one of the four circumstances mentioned in paragraph 1 is
sufficient.

Thus, when force or intimidation is employed by the offender, it
is not necessary that the woman be unconscious when he had carnal
knowledge of her.

PARAGRAPH 2: RAPE THROUGH SEXUAL ASSAULT
The sexual abuse under paragraph 2 is categorized as “rape
through sexual assault.” (People v. Soriano, 388 SCRA 140, [2002];
People v. Palma, 148869-74, December 11, 2003)
A violation of the body orifices by the fingers is within the expanded
definition of rape under R.A. No. 8353.

In People v. Soriano, G.R. No. 142779-95, August 29, 2002, 388
SCRA 140, it was ruled that the appellant is guilty of rape through
sexual assault when he inserted his finger into the vagina of his
victim. This is one of the significant amendments introduced by the
new law, thus making the insertion of any instrument, object, or any
part of the human body other than the sexual organ into the genital or
anus of another person as rape and not merely acts of lasciviousness.

(People u. Campuhan, GJi. No. 129433, March 30, 2000)

Rape by sexual assault is committed when a finger is inserted
in the victim’s vagina (People v. Alfonso, G.R. No. 182094, August

Art. 266-B

Rape by Sexual Assault Is a misnomer.

The term “rape by sexual assault” is a misnomer, as it goes
against the traditional concept of rape, which is carnal knowledge
of a woman without her consent or against her will. In contrast to
sexual assault which is a broader term that includes acts that gratify
sexual desire (such as cunnilingus, felatio, sodomy or even rape),
the classic rape is particular and its commission involves only the
reproductive organs of a woman and a man. Compared to sexual
assault, rape is severely penalized because it may lead to unwanted
procreation; or to paraphrase the words of the legislators, it will
put an outsider into the woman who would bear a child, or to the
family, if she is married. Concededly, R.A. No. 8353 defined specific
acts constituting acts of lasciviousness as a. distinct crime of “sexual
assault,” and increased the penalty thereof from prision correctional
to prision mayor. But it was never the intention of the legislature
to redefine the traditional concept of rape. (People v. Tulagan, G.R.
No. 227363, March 12, 2019)
BY USING FORCE AND INTIMIDATION

Degree of force necessary to constitute rape.

It is not necessary that the force employed against the
complaining woman in rape be so great or of such a character as
could not be resisted. It is enough that the force used is sufficient to
consummate the culprit’s purpose of copulating with the offended

relation to each other. (People v. Savellano, 57 SCRA 320)

Art. 266-B

consent. Tenacious resistance, however, is not required. Neither is a
determined and persistent physical struggle on the part of the victim
necessary.

At the Bicameral Conference Committee Meeting on the
disagreeing provisions of S.B. No. 950 and H.B. No. 6265, the
forerunners of R.A. No. 8353, the legislators agreed that Article
266-D is intended to “soften the jurisprudence of the 1970’s” when
resistance to rape was required to be tenacious. The lawmakers took
note of the fact that rape victims cannot mount a physical struggle in
cases where they were gripped by overpowering fear or subjugated by
moral authority. Article 266-D tempered the case law requirement
of physical struggle by the victim with the victim’s fear of the rapist
or incapacity to give valid consent. Thus, the law now provides that
resistance may be proved by any physical overt act in any degree from
the offended party. (People v. Dulay, G.R. No. 144344, July 23, 2002)

Examples:
(1) AAA persuasively narrated that, despite her effort to escape
from the room after the accused-appellant pinned her arms, mounted
her, and pinched her shoulder, the accused-appellant was able to get
hold of a knife that he used to threaten her while he dragged her to
the bed and, thereafter, successfully had carnal knowledge of her.
(People v. Ganaba, G.R. No. 219240, April 4, 2018)

Sexual congress with a person who expresses resistance through
words or deeds constitutes force. Here, AAA verbally and physically
manifested her resistance towards Dela Cruz’s advances
at one
point she even cried. Nonetheless, he persisted and ultimately
consummated his desire to have carnal knowledge of her. The degree
of force he employed becomes immaterial in view of AAA’s minority
and the fact that her intoxication impaired her physical strength.
(People u. De la Cruz, G.R. No. 219088, June 13, 2018)

(2) Rape is essentially sexual intercourse sans consent. In her
testimony, AAA narrated how the accused defiled her, notwithstanding
her refusal to have sex with him. She told him to stop and twice tried
to push him away but it was all for naught as he continued with
his desire to ravish her. AAA’s failure to shout for help or ‘to offer
spirited physical resistance’ cannot be used as basis to damage her
credibility. In rape cases, there is no expected uniform reaction from
the victim considering that the workings of the human mind placed
under emotional stress are unpredictable. AAA had already tried to
resist Dela Cruz but failed; thus, coupled with her intoxication, it
would be understandable why she no longer offered further resistance
or tried to shout for help after her previous futile attempts. (People
v. De la Cruz, supra)

AAA’s failure to shout for help and her failure to escape
were not factors that should diminish credibility due to the fact that
her mouth had been stuffed by Sabadlab with crumpled newspaper,
preventing her from making any outcry, and the second by the fact
that the culprits had blindfolded her and had also tied her hands
behind her back. The medical certification showing her several
physical injuries and the penetration of her female organ should
debunk without difficulty the accused’s submission that she did not
offer any resistance to the sexual assaults she suffered. Her resistance
to Sabadlab’s order for her to go with him was immediately stifled
by his poking of the gun at her throat and by appearance of his two
cohorts. (People v. Sabadlab, G.R. No. 175924, March 14, 2012)

which can hardly be considered as an unequivocal manifestation of
her refusal or rejection of appellant’s sexual advances. It would be
unfair to convict a man of rape committed against a woman who, after
giving him the impression through her unexplainable silence of
her tacit consent and allowing him to have sexual contact with her,
changed her mind in the middle and charged him with rape. (People
v. Tionloc, G.R. No. 212193, February 15, 2017)

Art 266-B

Resistance when futile, does not amount to consent

It was held in People v. Las Pinas, Jr., G.R. No. 133444, February
20, 2002, citing People u. Dreu, 334 SCRA 62 (2000), that the test is
whether the threat or intimidation produces a reasonable fear in the
mind of the victim that if she resists or does not yield to the desires
of the accused, the threat would be carried out. Where resistance
would be futile, offering none at all does not amount to consent to
the sexual assault. It is not necessary that the victim should have
resisted unto death or sustained physical injuries in the hands of the
rapist. It is enough if the intercourse takes place against her will or
if she yields because of genuine apprehension of harm to her if she
did not do so. Indeed, the law does not impose upon a rape victim the
burden of proving resistance. (People v. Sending, G.R. Nos. 14177376, January 20, 2003)
Silence may amount to tacit consent

Three things are thus clear from the testimony of “AAA:” first,
appellant never employed the slightest force, threat or intimidation
against her, second, “AAA” never gave the slightest hint of rejection
when appellant asked her to have sex with him; and, third, appellant
did not act with force since he readily desisted when “AAA” felt the
slightest pain and tried to move during their sexual congress.
The offended party could have resisted right from the start but
she did not, and chose not to utter a word or make any sign of rejection
of appellant’s sexual advances. It was only in the middle of their sexual
congress when the offended party tried to move when she felt pain,
698

Art. 266-B

Circumstantial evidence may prove rape.
A conviction for rape may rest on direct as well as circumstantial
evidence. Thus, an accused like him can be declared guilty of rape even
if the sole witness against him was the victim who had been rendered
unconscious at the time of the consummation of carnal knowledge
provided sufficient circumstantial evidence existed showing that the
victim was violated, and that it was the accused and no other who had
committed the violation. To disallow such showing is to obstruct the
successful prosecution of a rapist who renders his victim unconscious
before the consummation.
The Prosecution successfully established the following facts
and circumstances that, when taken together, very well constituted
evidence of the accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt, to wit: (a) he
and AAA lived in the same house; (b) while AAA was sleeping at 9:00
o’clock in the evening of June 25, 2005 in the same house, he crawled
up and laid down beside her, (c) AAA tried to escape; (d) he then pulled
AAA’s hair, slapped her and punched her in the stomach; (e) AAA
was rendered unconscious; (f) when AAA regained consciousness, she
found blood in her pan ties, and her sando was already raised up to her
neck; (g) AAA felt pain in her vagina; (h) AAA saw him in the act of
putting on his pants; (i) he threatened to kill AAA if she would reveal
the incident to anyone else; and (j) AAA sustained hymenal laceration.
These circumstances, coupled with AAA’ s positive testimony that was
corroborated by the examining physician’s physical findings on her,
lead to the inescapable conclusion that he raped AAA against her will
on that occasion. (People v. Nuyok, G.R. No. 195424, June 15, 2015)

Intimidation.
Intimidation must be viewed in light of the victim’s perception
and judgment at the time of rape and not by any hard and fast rule.
It is enough that it produces fear fear that if the victim does not

yield to the bestial demands of the accused, something would happen
to her at the moment or thereafter, as when she is threatened with
death if she reports the incident. (People v. Tabugoca, 285 SCRA 312,
332 [1998]; People v. Metin, G.R. No. 140781, May 8, 2003)
Rape committed by employing intimidation.

Rosalia was 13 years, four months and 20 days old at the time she
was raped. She was an immature teenager. She could easily be coerced
or cowed by a big old farmer and former security guard like Garcines
(his brother was a policeman). Her case is not far removed from that
on an 11-year-old girl with whom voluntary carnal intercourse is
considered rape. Intimidation includes the moral kind such as the
fear caused by threatening the girl with a knife or pistol. (People v.
Garcines, 57 SCRA 653, citing 2 Cuello Colon, Codigo Penal, 12 Ed.
537)

Moral ascendancy or influence, held to substitute for the element
of physical force or intimidation.

In a number of cases, the Supreme Court has ruled that the
moral ascendancy or influence exercised by the accused over the victim
substitutes for the element of physical force or intimidation in cases
of rape and, it may be added, acts of lasciviousness. The Court has
applied this rule to rapes committed by:
a)

Principles in assessing the credibility of witnesses in rape cases.

In the prosecution of rape cases, the offended party is,
more often than not, the only one available to prove directly the
commission of rape. (People v. Hermosa, G.R. Nos. 140439-40, June
18, 2003) While an accused may be convicted of rape solely on the
basis of the testimony of the complainant, such testimony should
meet the test of credibility - it should be straightforward, clear,
positive, and convincing. (People u. Arces, Jr., G.R. No. 225624,
October 3, 2018)
In reviewing the evidence adduced in a prosecution for the crime
of rape, three well-known principles should guide an appellate court,
namely: (1) that an accusation for rape can be made with facility, is
difficult to prove, but more difficult for the person accused, though
innocent, to disprove; (2) that in view of the intrinsic nature of the
crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the
testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme
caution; and (3) that the evidence for the prosecution must stand or
fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from

the weaknesses of the evidence for the defense. (People u. Villapana,
101 SCRA 72; People v. Aldana, 175 SCRA 135)
Where the testimony coming from the offended party is firm,
categorical and straightforward, her clothing, including the most
intimate garments, soiled and smudged, ripped and torn, which
are mute witnesses of the futile resistance she put up, the accused
should be convicted on the basis of her testimony. (People v. Bayion,

57 SCRA 114)

But where complainant testified that she remained entirely
silent during the incident where the accused allegedly laid on top of
her at around noontime while fully clothed and did not call out for help
when she knew that her family was just outside of the house, such
testimony raises too many questions and doubts, and is insufficient
to prove beyond reasonable doubt the allegations made against the
accused. (People v. Arces, Jr., supra)

Offended party deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious.

In the rape of a woman deprived of reason or otherwise

unconscious, the victim has no will.

Rape of a mental retardate falls under paragraph 1(b), of Article
266-A, supra, because the provision refers to a rape of a female
“deprived of reason,” a phrase that refers to mental abnormality,
deficiency, or retardation. (People v. Butiong, G.R. No. 168932,
October 19, 2011) Proof of force or intimidation is not necessary, it
being sufficient for the State to establish, one, the sexual congress
between the accused and the victim, and, two, the mental retardation
of the victim. (People v. Magabo, G.R. No. 139471, January 23, 2001,
350 SCRA 126, 131-132)
Being a deaf-mute does not necessarily take the place of the
element of force or intimidation or having been deprived of reason,
unconscious, or demented. (People v. Cubay, G.R. No. 224597, July

In the following cases, there is rape because the woman is
unconscious:
(a)

resist the sexual assault of the accused. (People v. Bautista,

102 SCRA 483)

Offended party with a mental disability either deprived of reason
or elemented.

Article 266-A, paragraph 1of the Revised Penal Code, as amended
provides for two circumstances when having carnal knowledge of a
woman with a mental disability is considered rape, to wit: paragraph
1(b) - when the offended party is deprived of reason; and paragraph
1(d) - when the offended party is demented. Under paragraph 1(d),
the term demented refers to a person who has dementia, which is a
condition of deteriorated mentality, characterized by marked decline
from the individual’s former intellectual level and often by emotional
apathy, madness, or insanity. On the other hand, under paragraph
1(b), the phrase deprived of reason has been interpreted to include
those suffering from mental abnormally, deficiency, or retardation.
(People v. Ernesto Ventura, Sr., G.R. No. 205230, March 12, 2014)
The victim, AAA, is intellectually disabled, with a mental age

of six years and two months at 21 years of chronological age and an
IQ of 38 at the time of the incident. Her capacity to give consent is
only that of a six-year- and two-month-old child. She is incapable of
giving rational consent to a sexual act. Any sexual intercourse with
her, regardless of her relationship with accused and the presence or
absence of resistance, is considered rape. (People v. Quintos, GJi. No.

But where consent is induced by the administration

For the consummation of the crime of rape, it is not essential

Frustrated rape.

Attempted rape.

Frustrated rape is committed upon a girl three years and 11
months old, there being no evidence of penetration of her genital
organ. (People v. Erinia, 60 Phil. 998)

Attempted rape was committed by the accused after raising the
dress of the woman then asleep and placing himself on top of her, and
when the woman was awakened the accused threatened her with a
knife, but because of her continued shouting and offering of resistance,
a neighbor came to her rescue. (People v. Tayaba, 62 Phil. 559)

There is no crime of frustrated rape.

In the crime of rape, from the moment the offender has carnal
knowledge of his victim, he actually attains his purpose, and from
that moment also, all the essential elements of the offense have been
accomplished. Nothing more is left to be done by the offender, because
he has performed the last act necessary to produce the crime. Thus,
the felony is consummated. In a long line of cases, a uniform rule
has been set that for the consummation of rape, perfect penetration
is not essential. Any penetration of the female organ by the male
organ is sufficient. Entry of the labia or lips of the female organ,
without rupture of the hymen or laceration of the vagina, is sufficient
to warrant conviction. Necessarily, rape is attempted if there is no
penetration of the female organ because not all acts of execution was
performed. The offender merely commenced the commission of a felony
directly by overt acts. Taking into account the nature, elements and
manner of execution of the crime of rape and jurisprudence on the
matter, it is hardly conceivable how the frustrated stage in rape can
ever be committed. (People v. Orita, 184 SCRA 114-115)

Note: In the case of People v. Orita, the Supreme Court held that
the Erinia case appears to be a “stray” decision inasmuch as it has
not been reiterated in the Court’s subsequent decisions.

It was likewise mentioned therein that [wjhile Article 335
provides in its penultimate paragraph for the penalty of death when
the rape is attempted or frustrated and a homicide is committed by
reason of or on the occasion thereof, the Court is of the opinion that
the particular provision on frustrated rape is a dead provision, which
must have been prompted by the Erinia case.

Note: In this case, there was intent on the part of the accused to
have carnal knowledge of the woman against her will.
The intent to lie with the woman distinguishes attempted rape from
acts of lasciviousness.

The intent of the offender to lie with the female defines the
distinction between attempted rape and acts of lasciviousness. The
felony of attempted rape requires such intent; the felony of acts of
lasciviousness does not. Only the direct overt acts of the offender
establish the intent to lie with the female. However, merely climbing
on top of a naked female does not constitute attempted rape without
proof of his erectile penis being in a position to penetrate the female’s
vagina. (Cruz v. People, G.R. No. 166441, October 8, 2014)
Attempted rape is committed when the “touching” of the vagina
by the penis is coupled with the intent to penetrate. The intent to
penetrate is manifest only through the showing of the penis capable
of consummating the sexual act touching the external genitalia of the
female. Without such showing, only the felony of acts of lasciviousness
is committed. (Cruz v. People, G.R. No. 166441, October 8, 2014)

Resignation to consummated act is not consent.

Note: Under Article 266-B, the word “frustrated" has been
deleted. Thus, the phrase now reads: “When the rape is attempted
and a homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion thereof
XXX.”

Taking advantage of the fact that the woman was asleep, the
accused entered upon the commission of the act. When prosecuted
for rape, the accused contended that the woman consented because
when she woke up she made no resistance.
Held: The crime had already been consummated and the
offended party’s final consent, after she realized the outrage
perpetrated against her, is not of the character to exclude the concept
of the crime of rape. (People u. Dayo, 62 Phil. 102; People v. Caballero,
61 Phil. 900)

2)

The original or certified true copy of birth certificate is the best
evidence to prove the age of the victim.
In the absence of the birth certificate, similar authentic docu¬
ments— i.e., baptismal certificate and school records— showing
the victim’s date of birth may be submitted to the court.

3)

Should the foregoing be not available on account of loss or
destruction, the credible testimony of the mother or any
relative by consanguinity or affinity qualified to testify on
matters respecting pedigree shall be sufficient under certain
conditions.

If all the foregoing cannot be obtained, the testimony of the
victim will suffice provided that it is expressly and clearly
admitted by the accused. (People v. Domingo, G.R. No. 177136,

Character of the offended woman is immaterial in rape.

The fact that the offended party may have been of an unchaste
character constitutes no defense in a charge of rape, provided that the
illicit relations were committed with force and violence, etc. (People
v. Blanco, 46 Phil. 113)

Variance In allegation and proof.

Since the charge in the Information for the December 2003
incident is rape through carnal knowledge, Pareja cannot be found
guilty of rape by sexual assault even though it was proven during trial.
This is due to the material differences and substantial distinctions
between the two modes of rape; thus, the first mode is not necessarily
included in the second, and vice-versa. Consequently, to convict Pareja
of rape by sexual assault when what he was charged with was rape
through carnal knowledge, would be to violate his constitutional right
to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.
Nevertheless, Pareja may be convicted of the lesser crime of acts
of lasciviousness under the variance doctrine embodied in Section 4,
in relation to Section 5, Rule 120 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.
(People v. Pareja, G.R. No. 202122, January 15, 2014)
The Information charged appellant with rape still under Article
335 of the Revised Penal Code. Thus, appellant cannot be convicted
of rape by means of sexual assault even if it was established that he
inserted his finger into the vagina of AAA. To do so would violate his
constitutional right to be informed of the nature of the charge against
him It bears noting, however, that the crime of acts of lasciviousness
is necessarily included in the crime of rape. Appellant is guilty of acts
of lasciviousness. (People v. Ceballos, Jr., G.R. No. 169642, September

Rape with homicide is a special complex crime.

Rape with homicide is now a special complex crime, like
robbery with homicide, in view of the amendment to Article 335. The
commentaries relative to robbery with homicide, under Article 294,
on the meaning of the phrase “by reason" may be considered in the
special complex crime of rape with homicide.
The special complex crime of rape with homicide is committed
by the accused who, while raping a six-year-old girl, strangled her to

death in order to silence her. The accused was sentenced to death.
(People v. Yu, G.R. No. L-13780, January 28, 1961)
Where homicide Is committed by reason or on the occasion of the
rape, there is rape with homicide even If the deceased Is not the
victim of the rape.

Where both the rape of AAA and the killing of Jennifer
perpetrated by appellant were duly proven, he is liable for rape
with homicide. There is no doubt that appellant killed Jennifer to
prevent her from aiding AAA or calling for help once she is able to
run away, and also to silence her completely so she may not witness
the rape of AAA, the original intent of appellant. His carnal desire
having been satiated, appellant purposely covered AAA’s body with
grass, as he did earlier with Jennifer’s body, so that it may not be
easily noticed or seen by passersby. Appellant indeed thought that
the savage blows he had inflicted on AAA were enough to cause her
death as with Jennifer. But AAA survived and appellant’s barbaric
deeds were soon enough discovered.
The facts established showed that the constitutive elements of
rape with homicide were consummated, and it is immaterial that the
person killed in this case is someone other than the woman victim of
the rape. As analogy may be drawn from our rulings in cases of robbery
with homicide, where the component acts of homicide, physical
injuries and other offenses have been committed by reason or on the
occasion of robbery. (People v. Laog, G.R. No. 178321, Octobers, 2011)
“Homicide" is understood In Its generic sense.
In the special complex crime of rape with homicide, the term
“homicide” is to be understood in its generic sense, and includes
murder and slight physical injuries committed by reason or on

occasion of the rape. Hence, even if any or all of the circumstances
(treachery, abuse of superior strength, and evident premeditation)
alleged in the information have been duly established by the
prosecution, the same would not qualify the killing to murder and
the crime committed by appellant is still rape with homicide and
any aggravating circumstance shall be considered as a generic
aggravating circumstance only. (People v. Laog, G.R. No. 178321,

The prosecution characterized the two murders and rape as
“double murder with rape” alleging in the information that the rape
was committed on the occasion of the murders.
Held: This is not the special complex crime of rape with homicide,
since the victim was already at the threshold of death when she was
ravished. That bestiality may be regarded either as a form of ignominy
causing disgrace or as a form of cruelty which aggravated the murder
of the elder sister, it being unnecessary to the commission thereof
(Arts. 14(17 and 20] and 248(6], Revised Penal Code). The accused is
guilty of two separate murders. (People v. Laspardas, 93 SCRA 638,
76 O.G. 2519)

Note: Another illustration of rape with homicide is, where the
rapist, who was suffering from gonorrhea, infected the victim who
died as a result.

Indemnity and damages in rape.

Civil indemnity. - The award of civil indemnity to the rape
victim is mandatory upon the finding that rape took place. (People
v. Lascano, G.R. No. 192180, March 21, 2012) The award of civil
indemnity is not only a reaction to the apathetic societal perception
of the penal law and the financial fluctuations over time, but also an
expression of the displeasure of the Court over the incidence of heinous
crimes against chastity. (People v. Victor, 292 SCRA 186 [1998])

Moral damages. — The award of moral damages is automati¬
cally granted in rape cases without need of further proof other than
the commission of the crime because it is assumed that a rape victim
has actually suffered moral injuries entitling her to such award. In
addition, the award of exemplary damages is justified under Article
2230 of the Civil Code if there is an aggravating circumstances,
whether ordinary or qualifying. (People v. Lucena, GJi. No. 190632,
February 26, 2014)

Exemplary damages. — Exemplary damages may be awarded
in criminal cases as part of the civil liability if the crime was committed

Special Protection of Children Against Abuse,

Child Prostitution and Other Sexual Abuse.
Children, whether male or female, who for money, profit, or
any other consideration or due to the coercion or influence of any
adult, syndicate or group, indulge in sexual intercourse or lascivious
conduct, are deemed to be children exploited in prostitution and other
sexual abuse.

The penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to
reclusion perpetua shall be imposed upon the following:

Those who commit the act of sexual intercourse of
lascivious conduct with a child exploited in prostitution or subject
to other sexual abuse; Provided, That when the victims is under
twelve (12) years of age, the perpetrators shall be prosecuted under
Article 335, paragraph 3, for rape and Article 336 of Act No. 3815,
as amended, the Revised Penal Code, for rape or lascivious conduct,
as the case may be: Provided, That the penalty for lascivious conduct
when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age shall be reclusion

Rape and Sexual Assault under tbe R.P.C. and Sexual
Intercourse and Lascivious Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.
A. No. 7610, reconciled.
In People v. Tulagan, G.R. No. 227363, March 12, 2019,
the Supreme Court en banc took the opportunity to reconcile the
provisions on Acts of Lasciviousness, Rape and Sexual Assault under
the R.P.C. vis-a-vis Sexual Intercourse and Lascivious Conduct under
Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, to fortify the earlier decisions of the
Court and doctrines laid down on similar cases, and to clarify the
nomenclature and imposable penalties, as follows:
1) STATUTORY RAPE. -If sexual intercourse is committed
with an offended party who is a child less than 12 years old or is
demented, whether or not exploited in prostitution, it is always a

crime of statutory rape; more so when the child is below seven years
old, in which case the crime is always qualified rape.

3) SEXUAL ABUSE UNDER SECTION 5(B) OF ILA. NO.
7610. - In case of sexual intercourse with a child who is 12 years old
or below 18 and who is deemed “exploited in prostitution or other
sexual abuse,” the crime could not be rape under the R.P.C., because
this no longer falls under the concept of statutory rape, and the victim

Art. 266-B

Under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, the proper penalty when
sexual intercourse is committed with a victim who is under 12 years
of age or is demented is reclusion perpetua, pursuant to paragraph
1(d), Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B of the R.P.C.
When the offended party is under 12 years of age or is demented,
only the first proviso of Section 5(b), Article III of R.A. No. 7610 will
apply, to wit: “when the victim is under twelve (12) years of age, the
perpetrators shall be prosecuted under Article 335, paragraph 3,
for rape x x x.° The penalty for statutory rape under Article 335 is
reclusion perpetua, which is still the same as in the current rape
law, i.e., paragraph 1(d), Article 266-A in relation to Article 266-B
of the R.P.C., as amended by R.A. No. 8353, except in cases where
the victim is below seven years of age where the imposable penalty
is death.

The second proviso of Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 will not apply
because it clearly has nothing to do with sexual intercourse, and it
only deals with “lascivious conduct when the victim is under 12 years
of age." While the terms “lascivious conduct” and “sexual intercourse”
are included in the definition of “sexual abuse” under Section 2(g)
of the Rules and Regulations on the Reporting and Investigation of
Child Abuse Cases, note that the definition of “lascivious conduct”
does not include sexual intercourse. Be it stressed that the purpose
of indicating the phrase “under twelve (12) years of age” is to provide
for statutory lascivious conduct or statutory rape, whereby evidence of
force, threat or intimidation is immaterial because the offended party,
who is under 12 years old or is demented, is presumed incapable of
giving rational consent.

Even if the girl who is below 12 years old or is demented consents
to the sexual intercourse, it is always a crime of statutory rape under
the R.P.C., and the offender should no longer be held liable under
R.A. No. 7610.

RAPE. - When the offended party is 12 years old or below
18 and the charge against the accused is carnal knowledge through
“force, threat or intimidation,” then he will be prosecuted for rape
under Article 266-A(lXa) of the R.P.C.

indulged in sexual intercourse either “for money, profit or any other

consideration or due to coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate
or group,” which deemed the child as one “exploited in prostitution
or other sexual abuse.”
4)

SEXUAL ASSAULT UNDER ARTICLE 266-A(2) OF

THE R.P.C. IN RELATION TO SECTION 5(B) OF ILA NO.
7610. - If the acts constituting sexual assault are committed against
a victim under 12 years of age or is demented, the nomenclature of
the offense should now be “Sexual Assault under paragraph 2, Article
266-A of the R.P.C. in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610.”
5)
LASCIVIOUS CONDUCT UNDER SECTION 5(B)
OF ILA. NO. 7610. - If the victim of lascivious conduct is 12 years
old and under 18 years old, or 18 years old and above under special

circumstances, the nomenclature of the crime should be “Lascivious
Conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A No. 7610” with the imposable
penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period to reclusion
perpetua but it should not make any reference to the provisions of
the R.P.C.
If the charge against the accused where the victim is 12 years
old or below 18 is sexual assault under paragraph 2, Article 266-A
of the R.P.C., then it may happen that the elements thereof are the
same as that of lascivious conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No.
7610, because the term “lascivious conduct” includes introduction of
any object into the genitalia, anus or mouth of any person.
6)
SEXUAL ASSAULT UNDER PARAGRAPH 2,
ARTICLE 266-A OF THE R.P.C. - It is only when the victim of the
sexual assault is 18 years old and above, and not demented, that the
crime should be called as “Sexual Assault under paragraph 2, Article
266-A of the RPC” with the imposable penalty of prision mayor.

“Over 18 years old under special circumstances” refers to “those
who are unable to fully take care of themselves or protect themselves
from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because

For the crime of acts of lasciviousness or lascivious conduct, the
nomenclature of the crime and the imposable penalty are based on
the guidelines laid down in People v. Caoili, G.R. No. 196848, August
8, 2017, 835 SCRA 107. For the crimes of rape by carnal knowledge
and sexual assault under the R.P.C., as well as sexual intercourse
committed against children under R.A. No. 7610, the designation of
the crime and the imposable penalty are based on the discussions
in Dimakuta v. People, 771 Phil. 641 (2015); Quimvel v. People,
G.R. No. 214497, April 18, 2017, 823 SCRA 192; and Caoili, in line
with the policy of R.A. No. 7610 to provide stronger deterrence and
special protection to children from all forms of abuse, neglect, cruelty,
exploitation, discrimination, and other conditions prejudicial to their
development.

When consent may be a defense for violation of Section 5 of
RA. No. 7610.

Consent of the child is material and may even be a defense in

criminal cases involving violation of Section 5, Article III of R.A.
No.
7610 when the offended party is 12 years old or below 18, or above 18
under special circumstances. Such consent may be implied from the

failure to prove that the said victim engaged in sexual intercourse
either “due to money, profit or any other consideration or due to the
coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group.”
If the victim who is 12 years old or less than 18 and is deemed to
be a child “exploited in prostitution and other sexual abuse” because
she agreed to indulge in sexual intercourse “for money, profit or
any other consideration or due to coercion or influence of any adult,
syndicate or group,” then the crime could not be rape under the R.P.C.,
because this no longer falls under the concept of statutory rape, and
there was consent. That is why the offender will now be penalized
under Section 6(b), R.A. No. 7610, and not under Article 336 of the
R.P.C. (now Article 266-A).
But if the said victim does not give her consent to sexual
intercourse in the sense that the sexual intercourse was committed
through force, threat or intimidation, the crime is rape under
paragraph 1, Article 266-A of the R.P.C. However, if the same victim
gave her consent to the sexual intercourse, and no money, profit,
consideration, coercion or influence is involved, then there is no crime
committed, except in those cases where “force, threat or intimidation”
as an element of rape is substituted by “moral ascendancy or moral
authority,” like in the cases of incestuous rape, and unless it is
punished under the R.P.C. as qualified seduction under Article 337
or simple seduction under Article 338. (People v. Tulagan, supra)
This ruling clarified the conclusion in Malto v. People, 560 Phil.
119 (2007) that (1) a child is presumed by law to be incapable of giving
rational consent to any lascivious conduct or sexual intercourse and
(2) consent of the child is immaterial in criminal cases involving
violation of Section 5, Article III of RA 7610. The Court found the
opinion in Malto that a child is presumed by law to be incapable of
giving rational consent, to unduly extend the concept of statutory rape
or acts of lasciviousness to those victims who are within the range
718

TITLE EIGHT

of 12 to 17 years old, and even those 18 years old and above under
special circumstances who are still considered as “children” under
Section 3(a) of R.A. No. 7610.

“Coercion and influence” under Section 5(b) of RA. No. 7610
refers to the means through which “any adult, syndicate or

group” compels a child to indulge in sexual intercourse.
In Quimvel, it was held that the term “coercion or influence” is
broad enough to cover or even be synonymous with the term “force or
intimidation.” Nonetheless, it should be emphasized that “coercion or
influence” is used in Section 5 of R.A. No. 7610 to qualify or refer to
the means through which “any adult, syndicate or group” compels a
child to indulge in sexual intercourse. On the other hand, the use of
“money, profit or any other consideration” is the other mode by which
a child indulges in sexual intercourse, without the participation of
“any adult, syndicate or group.”
“Coercion or influence” of a child to indulge in sexual intercourse
is clearly exerted NOT by the offender whose liability is based on
Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 for committing sexual act with a child
exploited in prostitution or other sexual abuse. Rather, the “coercion
or influence” is exerted upon the child by “any adult, syndicate, or
group” whose liability is found under Section 5(a) for engaging in,
promoting, facilitating or inducing child prostitution, whereby the
sexual intercourse is the necessary consequence of the prostitution.

elements of Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610; or in many instances

“Force, threat or intimidation” is the element of rape under the
R.P.C., while “due to coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or
group” is the operative phrase for a child to be deemed “exploited
in prostitution or other sexual abuse,” which is the element of
sexual abuse under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610. The “coercion or
influence” is not the reason why the child submitted herself to sexual
intercourse, but it was utilized in order for the child to become a
prostitute. Considering that the child has become a prostitute, the
sexual intercourse becomes voluntary and consensual because that is
the logical consequence of prostitution as defined under Article 202
of the R.P.C., as amended by R.A. No. 10158 where the definition of
“prostitute" was retained by the new law.
Therefore, there could be no instance that an Information may
charge the same accused with the crime of rape where “force, threat
or intimidation” is the element of the crime under the R.P.C., and
at the same time violation of Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 where
the victim indulged in sexual intercourse because she is exploited in
prostitution either “for money, profit or any other consideration or
due to coercion or influence of any adult, syndicate or group” the
phrase which qualifies a child to be deemed “exploited in prostitution
or other sexual abuse” as an element of violation of Section 5(b) of

-

R.A. No. 7610.

When the elements of both violations of Section 5(b) RA No.
7160 and of Article 266-A(l) are mistakenly alleged in the
Information, the accused should still be prosecuted under
the RP.C.
Assuming that the elements of both violations of Section
5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 and of Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) of the

R.P.C. are mistakenly alleged in the same Information e.g., carnal
knowledge or sexual intercourse was due to “force or intimidation”
with the added phrase of “due to coercion or influence,” one of the

Art. 266-B

wrongfully designate the crime in the Information as violation of

“Article 266-A, paragraph 1(a) in relation to Section 5(b) of R.A. No.
7610,” the accused should still be prosecuted pursuant to the R.P.C.,
as amended by R.A. No. 8353, which is the more recent and special
penal legislation.

A violation of Section 5(b) of RA No. 7610 occurs even though
the accused committed sexual abuse against the child victim
only once.
The very definition of “child abuse’ under Section 3(b) of R.A
No. 7610 does not require that the victim suffer a separate and
distinct act of sexual abuse aside from the act complained of. For
it refers to the maltreatment, whether habitual or not, of the child.
Thus, a violation of Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 occurs even though
the accused committed sexual abuse against the child victim only
once, even without a prior sexual affront. (Quimvel v. People, supra)

Further, this principle does not apply where multiple rape is

the criminal liability, its benefits cannot be extended to the acts
committed by the others of which he is a co-principal. (People v.

Prior to R.A. No. 8353, a husband cannot be guilty of rape

she gave when she assumed the marriage relation, and the law will

offense. (State u. Haines, 51 La. Ann. 731, 25 So. 372; 441 RA. 837)

extinguish the criminal action or the penalty: Provided, That
the crime shall not be extinguished or the penalty shall not be
abated if the marriage is void ab initio. (RA. No. 8353)

Effect of marriage.

Marriage extinguishes not only the penal action, but likewise
the penalty that may be imposed. (Laceste v. Santos, 56 Phil. 472;
People v. Miranda, 57 Phil. 264; Art. 266-C)

Concept of Marital Rape.

It is now acknowledged that rape, as a form of sexual violence,
exists within marriage. A man who penetrates his wife without her
consent or against her will commits sexual violence upon her, and
the Philippines, as a State Party to the United Nations Convention
on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women
and its accompanying Declaration, defines and penalizes the act as
rape under R.A. No. 8353.
A woman is no longer the chattel antiquated practices labeled
her to be. A husband who has sexual intercourse with his wife is not
merely using a property, he is fulfilling a marital consortium with a
fellow human being with dignity equal to that he accords himself. He
cannot be permitted to violate this dignity by coercing her to engage
in a sexual act without her full and free consent, x x x

It is true that the Family Code obligates the spouses to love

In crimes against chastity, such effect benefits not only the
principals but also the accomplices and accessories. (Art. 344, Revised
Penal Code) However, since rape has ceased to be a crime against
chastity, but is now a crime against persons, it now appears that

expressions of love, that are both spontaneous and mutual and not

Further, the delicate and reverent nature of sexual intimacy

intimacy brings spouses wholeness and oneness. It is a gift and a

In case it is the legal husband who is the offender, the subsequent
forgiveness by the wife as the offended party shall extinguish the
criminal action or the penalty: Provided, That the crime shall not
be extinguished or the penalty shall not be abated if the marriage is

It is only in crimes against chastity that pardon/forgiveness by
the offended party shall bar the prosecution of the offense committed,
i.e., seduction, abduction, acts of lasciviousness. Since rape is no
longer a crime against chastity, but is now a crime against persons,
the provision that “subsequent forgiveness by the wife as the offended
party shall extinguish the criminal action or the penalty” is the
exception to the rule that forgiveness by the offended party shall not
extinguish the penal action in crimes against persons.

Elements:

Art. 267

501)

If the offender is a public officer, the crime is arbitrary detention.
This article requires that the offender is a private individual,
because when the offender is a public officer, it will be arbitrary
detention.

But the public officer must have a duty under the law to detain
a person, such as a policeman or constabulary soldier. If he has no
such duty, like a sanitary inspector or a clerk in a government office,
and he detains a person, he is liable under this article.

Penalty when victim is a minor and accused is one of the parents.

When victim is a minor and accused is any of the parents, the
penalty is that provided for in Article 271, paragraph 2

The accused approached, took hold of, and dragged M, striking
the latter with the butt of his rifle. The companions of M were told to
continue on their way. Hardly had they walked one kilometer when
they heard gun reports. The following day, M was found dead with
gunshot wounds.

729

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

TITLE NINE
Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Held: There is no sufficient evidence of intention to kidnap
because from the moment M was held and dragged to the time when
the gun reports were heard, nothing was done or said by the accused
to show or indicate that they intended to deprive M of her liberty
for sometime and for some purpose. The interval was so short as to
negative the idea implied in kidnapping. Her short detention forms
part of the perpetration of the crime of murder. (People v. Remalante,
92 Phil. 48; People v. Sacayanan, G.R. Nos. L-15024-25, December
31, 1960)

Such agents are not liable for kidnapping. (People v. Soriano, et al.,
51 O.G. 4513)

Art. 267

The carrying away of the victim in the crime of kidnapping can either
be made forcibly or fraudulently.
Th[e] Court held in the case of People v. Santos (283 SCRA 443)
that the fact that the victim voluntarily went with the accused did
not remove the element of deprivation of liberty, because the victim
went with the accused on a false inducement without which the
victim would not have done so. In the present case, although Atty.
Soriano boarded the vehicle without any protestation, he was under
the impression that the said persons inside the same vehicle were to
be trusted as he was assured by appellant Agustin about that matter.
Without such assurance, the victim would not have boarded the said
vehicle. Moreover, it is important to emphasize that, in kidnapping,
the victim need not be taken by the accused forcibly or against his will.
What is controlling is the act of the accused in detaining the victim
against his or her will after the offender is able to take the victim in
his custody. In short, the carrying away of the victim in the crime of
kidnapping and serious illegal detention can either be made forcibly
or fraudulently. (People v. Deduyo, 414 SCRA 160)

Must there be an actual demand for ransom?

As long as the kidnapping or detention was committed “for
the purpose of extorting ransom,” actual demand for ransom is not
necessary.
The accused is not liable when there is lack of motive to resort to
kidnapping.

Where the agents of the Constabulary took the supposed victim
from his house to make him answer for the murder of those persons
who had disappeared, there was lack of motive to resort to kidnapping.
730

Art. 267

Detention or locking up of victim is essential.
The offended party testified that the accused had ordered her

not to go out of the agency or to peep out of the window. But there is

no evidence that the doors of the agency or of its rooms were locked
or closed in such a way as to prevent the offended party from going
out had she wanted to go out. Neither did she ever feel she wanted
to go out of the building and was prevented from doing so. On the
contrary, she went to the agency on August 28 voluntarily as there
was an offer for her to work as a maid but she rejected it. There is no
evidence that the three accused conspired to instill fear into her mind
in order to compel and force her to remain in the agency.

The acts of the accused prohibiting her from peeping out of the
window or going out were made so that she might not be seen by the
police.

Held: There is no illegal detention, because the element of
detention or locking up is lacking. (People u. Ching Suy Siong, et al.,
G.R. No. L-6174, February 28, 1955; 96 Phil. 975)
It is essential in the crime of illegal detention that there be
actual confinement or restriction of the person of the offended party.
(U.S. v. Cabanag, 8 Phil. 64)
Thus, if the alleged victim had freedom to leave the premises
where she was allegedly confined, the crime of illegal detention
cannot rise because she was not deprived of her liberty. (See U.S. v.
Quevengco, 2 Phil. 412; U.S. v. Herrera, et al., 3 Phil. 515)
Also, when the girl, who had been taken from her grandmother
and brought to his house by the defendant, was not confined, but on the
contrary was allowed to go back alone to her grandmother, returning
to the defendant on the same day, there is no illegal detention. (U.S.
v. Cabanag, 8 Phil. 64)

But a husband who locks up in a room his lawful wife for more
than 20 days, during which time the victim is not allowed to leave the
room nor even to peep out of the window, is guilty of illegal detention
under this article, because there is actual confinement of the offended
party.

731

Art. 267

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

It is not necessary that the victim be placed in an inclosure.
Illegal detention, as defined and punished in the Code, may
consist not only in placing a person in an inclosure but also in
detaining him or depriving him in any manner of his liberty. (People
v. Crisostomo, et al., 46 Phil. 775)
Leaving a child In the house of another, where he had freedom of
locomotion but not the freedom to leave It at will, deprives him of
liberty.

It is true that the boy was allowed to play in the house where
he was kept, but the fact remains that he was under the control of
accused Bravo who left him there, as he could not leave the house
until she shall have returned for him. Because of his tender age
and the fact that he did not know the way back home, he was then
and there in a way deprived of his liberty. It is like putting him in
prison or in an asylum where he may have freedom of locomotion but
not the freedom to leave it at will. (People v. Acosta, et al., 60 O.G.
6999)

Restraint need not be permanent
Thus, if the two-year-old child was held and tied to a wooden
pillar until his brother, servant of the two accused, should appear
and return to their service, because said brother had run away, there
is illegal detention. (U.S. u. Peralta, 8 Phil. 200)

TITLE NINE
Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Art. 267

Reasons for this decision:
(1) That no injury or disturbance of a right was intended by,
or resulted from, the act of the accused.
(2)

That the act of the accused was to a certain extent
justified.

Note: The detention here is legal to a certain extent, because
even a private person can arrest one who commits a crime in his

presence.
The Supreme Court, however, found the accused guilty of light
coercion under paragraph 2 of Article 287.

Detention is illegal when not ordered by competent authority or
not permitted by law.

The illegality of the detention punished by Article 267 consists in
such detention not ordered by a competent authority or not permitted
by law.

For that reason, the fact that a boy was apprehended and
detained for over eight hours, with his hands and feet bound to a
post, without just cause, on suspicion that he was an incendiarist,
has been held to constitute illegal detention. (U.S. v. Mendoza, 8
Phil. 468)
Essential element of kidnapping.

The detention must be illegal.

The third element, that is, that the detention or kidnapping must
be illegal, although not expressed in Article 267, must be understood
as included therein. (Albert)
There are cases where it Is lawful to detain another.

The fact that the owners of a sugarcane plantation locked up
in the lobby of their house a boy who had stolen some sugar canes
from the plantation, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., without giving him
anything to eat, does not constitute the crime of illegal detention.
(People v. Tamorro, G.R. No. 25373, June 11, 1925)

732

The essential element or act which makes the offense of
kidnapping is the deprivation of an offended party’s liberty under
any of the four instances enumerated in Article 267, paragraph 1, of
the Revised Penal Code, the illegal detention of the victim for more
than five days (now, three days) being one of the instances. (People
v. Suarez, et al., 82 Phil. 484)

But when the kidnapping or detention was committed for the
purpose of extorting ransom, it is not necessary that one or any of
such circumstances enumerated in the first paragraph of Article 267
be present.

Art. 267

Thus, when the offender simulated public authority, or when
serious physical injuries were inflicted on the victim, or when threats
to kill him were made, or when the person kidnapped or detained was
a minor, female, or public officer, even if the period of detention was
less than three days, the crime committed is serious illegal detention.

Kidnapping of a public officer.

A barrio captain is a public officer. His kidnapping is covered
by Article 267, paragraph 4 of the Revised Penal Code. (People v. Del
Mundo, 114 SCRA 719)
Restraint by robbers not illegal detention.

The sequestration of nearly half an hour of the dwellers of the
house when the robbers compelled them to leave it and follow them
up to a certain distance, for no other purpose than to prevent their
reporting the matter to the authorities while the robbers were near the
place, is not illegal detention. The purpose of the robbers in so doing
was to delay or prevent assistance being rendered by the authorities.
(U.S. v. Sol, 9 Phil. 265)
The purpose is immaterial when any of the circumstances in the
first paragraph of Article 267 is present.

The accused stood trial for kidnapping with serious illegal
detention, and the deprivation of complainant’s liberty, which is
the essential element of the offense, was duly proved. That there
may have been other crimes committed in the course of the victim’s
confinement is immaterial to the case. The kidnapping became
consummated when the victim (a female) was actually restrained or
deprived of her freedom, and that makes proper the prosecution of
the herein accused under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code. The
surrounding circumstances make it clear that the main purpose of
Annabel’s detention was to coerce her into withdrawing her previous
charge against appellant Ablaza, thus obstructing the administration
of justice. The acts of rape were incidental and used as a means to
break the girl’s spirit and induce her to dismiss the criminal charge.
(People v. Ablaza, 30 SCRA 173)
734

Art. 267

killed by his abductor, the crime committed would either be a complex
crime of kidnapping with murder under Article 48 of the Revised
Penal Code, or two separate crimes of kidnapping and murder. Thus,
where the accused kidnapped the victim for the purpose of killing
him, and he was in fact killed by his abductor, the crime committed
was the complex crime of kidnapping with murder under Article
48 of the Revised Penal Code, as the kidnapping of the victim was
a necessary means of committing the murder. On the other hand,
where the victim was kidnapped not for the purpose of killing him
but was subsequently slain as an afterthought, two separate crimes
of kidnapping and murder were committed.
However, R.A. No. 7659 amended Article 267 of the R.P.C. by
adding thereto a last paragraph which provides

—

“When the victim is killed or dies as a consequence of the
detention, or is raped, or is subjected to torture or dehumanizing
acts, the maximum penalty shall be imposed.”

This amendment introduced in our criminal statutes the
concept of “special complex crime” of kidnapping with murder or
homicide. It effectively eliminated the distinction drawn by the
courts between those cases where the killing of the kidnapped victim
was purposely sought by the accused, and those where the killing
was not deliberately resorted to but was merely an afterthought.
Consequently, the rule now is: “Where the person kidnapped is killed
in the course of the detention, regardless of whether the killing was
purposely sought or was merely an afterthought, the kidnapping and
murder or homicide can no longer be complexed under Article 48,
nor be treated as separate crimes, but shall be punished as a special
complex crime under the last paragraph of Article 267, as amended
by R.A. No. 7659.” (People v. Ramos, 297 SCRA 618, 640-641 [1998],
citing Parulan v. Rodas, 78 Phil. 855 [1947])
kidnapping with frustrated murder

The crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention consists
not only in placing a person in an enclosure but also in detaining
that person or depriving him in any manner of his liberty. Actual
735

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

TITLE NINE

restraint of the victim’s liberty was evident in the instant case from
the moment Agnes was taken at gunpoint from Panay Avenue to
a remote place in Batangas. The evidence would likewise show,
ineluctably, the commission of frustrated murder. Not rebutted was
the medical finding that the gunshot wound sustained by the victim
would have resulted in the death of the victim had it not been for
the proper medical attention given to her. The perpetration of the
premeditated killing, albeit frustrated, was hatched from the moment
the accused and his co-conspirator took the victim in Quezon City
until she was ultimately “executed" in Batangas to insure impunity to
the perpetrators by eliminating the only witness. (People v. Gungon,
G.R. No. 119674, March 19, 1998)

It seems clear that the weight of authority is in favor of the
proposition that where the victim was taken from one place to another,

Art. 267

Where the victim is taken from one place to another solely for the
purpose of killing him, the crime committed is murder.

Where the taking of the victim was incidental to the basic
purpose to kill, the crime is only murder, and this is true even if,
before the killing but for purposes thereof, the victim was taken from
one place to another. Thus, where the evident purpose of taking the
victims was to kill them, and from the acts of the accused it cannot
be inferred that the latter’s purpose was actually to detain or deprive
the victims of their liberty, the subsequent killing of the victims
constitute the crime of murder, hence the crime of kidnapping does
not exist and cannot be considered as a component felony to produce
the complex crime of kidnapping with murder. (People v. Padica, G.R.
No. 102645, April 7, 1993)

In a line of cases, it was ruled that, if the main purpose was
to kill the victim and the forcible taking of the victim was only
incidental to the killing, the crime was murder, apparently absorbing
the kidnapping. Thus, in U.S. u. Ancheta, 1 Phil. 165, a 1902 case, it
was held that, where the victim was taken from his home, bound and
brought to a remote place, where he was killed, the crime was murder
only. It was noted that “the fact that the deceased was captured in his
house and taken by the defendants to an uninhabited place selected by
them for the purpose of killing him there, does not constitute the crime
of illegal detention since it does not appear that it was the purpose of
the accused to commit this offense. On the contrary, they seized the
unfortunate victim in his house with the sole object of carrying him
away to a suitable place and of their murdering him.”
736

Art. 267

solely for the purpose of killing him and not for detaining him for
any length of time or for the purpose of obtaining ransom for his
release, the crime committed is murder, and not the complex crime
of kidnapping with murder. (People v. Ong, 62 SCRA 174)
Kidnapping was not sufficiently proven. Although appellants

bound and gagged Chua and transported him to Bulacan against
his will, they did these acts to facilitate his killing, not because they

intended to detain or confine him. As soon as they arrived at the locus
criminis, appellants wasted no time in killing him. That appellants’
intention from the beginning was to kill the victim is confirmed by
the conversation which Sumipo heard in the car in which Maritess
said that a knife would be used to kill him so that it would not create
noise. The subsequent demand for ransom was an afterthought which
did not qualify appellants’ prior acts as kidnapping. (People u. Estacio,
G.R. No. 171655, July 22, 2009)
When murder, and not kidnapping.

It bears stressing that in determining what crime is charged
in an information, the material inculpatory facts recited therein
describing the crime charged in relation to the penal law violated
are controlling. Where the specific intent of the malefactor is
determinative of the crime charged, such specific intent must be
alleged in the information and proved by the prosecution. A decade
ago, th[e] Court held in People v. Puno, et al., 219 SCRA 85 (1993),
that for kidnapping to exist, there must be indubitable proof that the
actual specific intent of the malefactor is to deprive the offended party
of his liberty and not where such restraint of his freedom of action
is merely an incident in the commission of another offense primarily
intended by the malefactor. Th[e] Court further held:
“x x x. Hence, as early as United States v. Ancheta, 1 Phil.
165 (1902), and consistently reiterated thereafter, it has been held
that the detention and/or forcible taking away of the victims by the
accused, even for an appreciable period of time but for the primary
and ultimate purpose of killing them, holds the offenders liable for
taking their lives or such other offenses they committed in relation
thereto, but the incidental deprivation of the victims’ liberty does not
constitute kidnapping or serious illegal detention.”
737

Art. 267

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

TITLE NINE

If the primary and ultimate purpose of the accused is to kill
the victim, the incidental deprivation of the victim’s liberty does not
constitute the felony of kidnapping but is merely a preparatory act to
the killing, and hence, is merged into, or absorbed by, the killing of
the victim. The crime committed would either be homicide or murder.
(People v. Delim, G.R. No. 142773, January 28, 2003)
Specific Intent, determinative of whether crime committed is murder
or kidnapping.

What is primordial then is the specific intent of the malefactors
as disclosed in the information or criminal complaint that is
determinative of what crime the accused is charged with
that of
murder or kidnapping.

—

Philippine and American penal laws have a common thread on
the concept of specific intent as an essential element of specific intent
crimes. Specific intent is used to describe a state of mind which exists
where circumstances indicate that an offender actively desired certain
criminal consequences or objectively desired a specific result to follow
his act or failure to act. (People v. Garland, 627 NE 2d 377) Specific
intent involves a state of the mind. It is the particular purpose or
specific intention in doing the prohibited act. Specific intent must be
alleged in the Information and proved by the state in a prosecution
for a crime requiring specific intent. (State v. Mundy, 650 NE 2d 502)
Kidnapping and murder are specific intent crimes.
Specific intent may be proved by direct evidence or by
circumstantial evidence. It may be inferred from the circumstances
of the actions of the accused as established by the evidence on record.
(21 Am. Jur. 2d, Criminal Law, pp. 214-215)

Specific intent is not synonymous with motive. Motive generally
is referred to as the reason which prompts the accused to engage in
a particular criminal activity. Motive is not an essential element of a
crime and hence the prosecution need not prove the same. As a general
rule, proof of motive for the commission of the offense charged does not
show guilt and absence of proof of such motive does not establish the
innocence of accused for the crime charged such as murder. (Cupps
v. State, 97 Northwestern Reports, 210) The history of crimes shows
that murders are generally committed from motives comparatively

trivial. (Wharton, Criminal Law, Vol. 1, p. 215)

Art. 267

Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Crime is rarely rational. In murder, the specific intent is to kill
the victim. In kidnapping, the specific intent is to deprive the victim
of his/her liberty. If there is no motive for the crime, the accused
cannot be convicted for kidnapping (People v. Manliguez, et al., 206
SCRA 812 [1992]) In kidnapping for ransom, the motive is ransom.
Where accused kills the victim to avenge the death of a loved one,
the motive is revenge.
In this case, it is evident on the face of the Information that the
specific intent of the malefactors in barging into the house of Modesto
was to kill him and that he was seized precisely to kill him with the
attendant modifying circumstances. The act of the malefactors of
abducting Modesto was merely incidental to their primary purpose of
killing him. Moreover, there is no specific allegation in the information
that the primary intent of the malefactors was to deprive Modesto of
his freedom or liberty and that killing him was merely incidental to
kidnapping. Irrefragably then, the crime charged in the Information
is murder under Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code and not
kidnapping under Article 268 thereof. (People v. Delim, G.R. No.
142773, January 28, 2003)
Circumstances qualifying the offense.

If the purpose of the kidnapping or detention is to extort ransom
from the victim or any other person, even if none of the circumstances
mentioned in Article 267 is present, the penalty is reclusion perpetua
without eligibility for parole.

However, if the offender is over 15 but under 18 years of age, he
shall be exempt from criminal liability. If he acted with discernment,
minority should be appreciated as a privileged mitigating circumstance
pursuant to Article 68 of the Revised Penal Code and the penalty next
lower in degree should be imposed.(People v. Halil Gambao, GJl. No.
172707, October 1,2013)

Meaning of ransom.
The accused maintain that they should not be convicted of

kidnapping because the intention was at most merely to compel the
victim to fulfill his promise of defraying hospital expenses of one
Hayam.

This provision gives rise to a special complex crime. This arises where
the law provides a single penalty for two or more component offenses.
No matter how many rapes had been committed in the special

Art. 267

The last paragraph of Article 267 having been derived from
statutes of the United States, particularly the Lindbergh Law,
American jurisprudence has an application. Under American rulings,
ransom is money, price, or consideration paid or demanded for
redemption of a captured person or persons, a payment that releases
from captivity. (See Corpus Juris Secundum, 458; 36 Words and
Phrases, 102; Keith, et al. u. State, 163 So. 136, 120 Fla. 847) Now
since the accused demanded and received money as a requisite for
releasing a person from captivity, whatever other motive may have
compelled them to do so, the money is still ransom under the law.
(People v. Kamad Akiran, et al., 18 SCRA 239)
Conspiracy to extort ransom makes all the conspirators liable
under the second paragraph of Article 267, including those who did
not take any part of the money.

One of the accused demanded money for the victim’s release, and
the others fully concurred in that criminal resolution and affirmed
their assent when they escorted the victim to the abaca plantation

one kidnapping with rape. This is because these composite acts

are regarded as a single indivisible offense as in fact R.A. No. 7659
punishes these acts with only one single penalty. In a way, R.A. No.
7659 depreciated the seriousness of rape because no matter how many
times the victim was raped, there is only one crime committed - the
special complex crime of kidnapping with rape.

It having been established that Mirandilla’s act was kidnapping
and serious illegal detention and on the occasion thereof, he raped
AAA several times, Mirandilla is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
the special complex crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention
with rape, warranting the penalty of death. However, in view of RA.
No. 9346, the penalty of death is hereby reduced to reclusion perpetua
without eligibility for parole. (People v. Mirandilla, G.R. No. 186417,

where he was confined. Even if they went home afterwards or did
not get any part of the money, the fact is that they fully and directly
cooperated and did their part to cany out the resolution of their co¬
accused. Under these facts, there was conspiracy to extort ransom.
(People v. Akiran, supra)

The crime is forcible abduction with rape if offender took
the victim with lewd designs.

Corpus delicti in kidnapping with ransom.

If the taking was by forcible abduction and the woman was
raped several times, the crimes committed are (a) one complex crime
of forcible abduction with rape, in as much as the forcible abduction
was only necessary for the first rape; and (b) each of the other counts
of rape constitutes distinct and separate count of rape. (People v.
Garcia, G.R. No. 141125, February 28, 2002, 378 SCRA 278)

The corpus delicti in the crime of kidnapping for ransom is the
fact that an individual has been in any manner deprived of his liberty
for the purpose of extorting ransom from the victim or any other
person. Whether or not the ransom is actually paid to or received by
the perpetrators is of no moment. (People v. Castro, G.R. No. 132726,

Note: In view of the enactment of R.A. No. 9346 which prohibits
the imposition of the death penalty, the maximum penalty is now
reclusion perpetua without possibility of parole.
No complex crime of illegal detention with rape under Article 48.

Prior to the effectivity of R.A. No. 7659, when the person
kidnapped or illegally detained was raped, two independent crimes
of kidnapping and rape were committed.

Republic Act No. 7659, however, amended the last paragraph
of Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code on serious illegal detention
and kidnapping to read:

When the victim is killed or dies as a consequence of the
detention or is raped, or is subjected to torture or dehumanizing acts,
the maximum penalty shall be imposed.
Under this provision, when the person kidnapped or illegally
detained is raped, the offense committed is the special complex crime
of serious illegal detention or kidnapping with rape, punishable
with the maximum penalty of death. (People v. Ramos, 358 Phil.
261 [1998])
The last paragraph of Article 267 applies only to instances
where the person illegally detained or kidnapped is raped. It does not
provide for a complex crime of rape with serious illegal detention. As
the Court ruled in People v. Lactao, 227 SCRA 463 (1993), there is no
complex crime of illegal detention with rape under Article 48 of the
Revised Penal Code. There is also no complex crime of kidnapping
with attempted rape under Article 48 because there is no single act
which results in two or more grave or less grave felonies. Neither is
illegal detention a necessary means for committing rape. (People v.
Gonzales, G.R. No. 129894, 337 SCRA 590(2000]; People v. Leonardo
Nuguid, G.R. No. 148891, January 21, 2004)

The crime of illegal detention is committed by a private

person of liberty; arbitrary detention is committed by a public officer
or employee who detains a person without legal ground.
Illegal detention is a crime against personal liberty and security;
arbitrary detention is a crime against the fundamental law of the
State.

If the offender shall voluntarily release the person

Art. 269

Liability of accomplice in slight Illegal detention.

Is voluntary release privileged mitigating if the victim is a woman?

The same penalty is incurred by anyone who furnished the place
for the perpetration of the crime. (Art. 268, par. 2)

The accused with threat and intimidation were able to compel
Juana Briones to go with them to a certain house where she was kept
for two nights and one day. The purpose of the offenders in keeping
her there was to enable Montilla to have a talk with her in private
so that he could persuade her into marrying him. On the third day,
Juana was able to persuade the accused to take her to the house of
her brother, so that they could talk the matter over with him. She
was taken there and was then and there released.
Held: The crime committed is that of slight illegal detention
under the third paragraph of Article 268, as amended by R.A. No.
18. (People v. Saliente, et al., 84 Phil. 137)
Note: When the victim is a female, the detention is punished
under Article 267. Voluntary release is not mitigating under that
article.
The last paragraph of Article 268 applies to slight illegal detention
only, not to Article 267. Articles 267 and 268 are independent of each
other. (Asistio v. San Diego, 10 SCRA 673)

His participation is raised to that of a real co-principal.

But if the cooperation of the accomplice is by an act or acts
other than furnishing the place for the perpetration of the crime, the
penalty should be one degree lower than that provided for the crime
of slight illegal detention.
Privileged mitigating circumstance in slight illegal detention.

If the offender (a) voluntarily releases the person so kidnapped or
detained within three days from the commencement of the detention,
(b) without having attained the purpose intended, and (c) before
the institution of criminal proceedings against him, his liability is
mitigated. In effect, it is a privileged mitigating circumstance because
the penalty is lower by one degree.

But to impose the lesser penalty, it must be shown by the
offender that he was in a position to prolong the detention for more
than three days and yet he released the person detained within that
time.
No mitigation of the penalty is allowed when the proceedings
have already been instituted, for the simple reason that in this case,
the accused acted through fear rather than through repentance.
All the requisites mentioned in (a), (b), and (c) must concur.
Voluntary release is not an exempting circumstance.

The rescue or escape of the victim within three days from his
kidnapping and detention is not an exempting circumstance. The
voluntary release by the offender of the victim within three days from
his detention, without the offender having attained his purpose and
before the institution of criminal proceedings against him for slight
illegal detention, is not an exempting circumstance; it merely serves
to reduce the penalty to prision mayor in its maximum and medium
periods and a fine not exceeding P700 (now P100,000). (People v.

Art. 269

This article punishes any person who commits the acts defined
therein. This article applies to public officers. (People u. Malasugui, 63
Phil. 221) Under Section 6, Rule 113 of the Revised Rules of Criminal
Procedure, a private person may arrest an individual without warrant
under the circumstances when public officers can make arrest. If the
private person makes an arrest without reasonable ground therefor,
because it is not in accordance with Section 6, Rule 113 of the Revised
Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the purpose is to deliver the person
arrested to the proper authorities, he is liable under this article.

Unlawful arrests by public officers should be punished as
arbitrary detention under Article 124, if the public officer has the
authority to arrest and detain a person, but the arrest is without
legal ground.
If the public officer has no authority to arrest and detain a
person, or if he did not act in his official capacity, he should be
punished for unlawful arrest under Article 269.
There is no unlawful arrest, when the arrest is authorized by a
warrant issued by the court.

The accused is charged with illegal arrest through false
testimony.

An information for falsification of official and commercial
documents was filed against Emilio Jugo, Jr., and an unidentified
person, John Doe; and the corresponding warrant of arrest (exhibit
B) was issued. The accused and his counsel presented exhibit B
to Detective Jose Jacob, together with the affidavit of the accused
(exhibit C) attesting, among others, that the John Doe named in the
warrant was Leon Co Santos. On the strength of exhibits B and C,
Jacob and the accused proceeded to the house of Leon Co Santos in
order to arrest the latter.

It was held that the crime charged was not committed. The
arrest ofCo Santos as the John Doe mentioned in the information was
authorized by exhibit B issued by the presiding judge of Branch XX
of the Court of First Instance of Manila. The proper issuance of this
746

Art. 269

arrest through false testimony, for the accused has not as yet testified
in any hearing regarding John Doe’s identity, but merely executed
an affidavit pointing out Co Santos as the John Doe mentioned in the
information and warrant. At most, therefore, the accused could only
have perjured. But even perjury by the accused has not been proven
by the evidence at hand. (People v. Lim Chun, CA., 68 O.G. 5293)

Unlawful arrest distinguished from other illegal detention.
If the purpose of locking up or detaining the victim is to deliver
him to the proper authorities, and it develops that the detention is
unlawful, then the offense committed is unlawful arrest.
In any other case, the detention will render the culprit liable
for other illegal detention.
Example of unlawful arrest

Thus, when F and P had a dispute as to the right of P to cultivate
the land in question, a fight ensued, and having beaten P, F tied P
with a piece of rope and conducted him to the municipal jail where the
jailer kept P for several hours, until he was released by the Justice
of the Peace.

Held: The fact that the accused immediately conducted the
complaining witness to the municipal jail takes the offense out of the
article for illegal detention and brings it within Article 269. (U.S. v.
Fontanilla, 11 Phil. 233)
Distinguished from Article 125.
(1)

In the crime of delay in the delivery of detained persons to the
proper judicial authority (Art. 126), the detention is for some
legal ground-, in unlawful arrest, the detention is not authorized
by law.

(2)

Under Article 125, the crime is committed by failing to deliver
such person to the proper judicial authority within a certain
period of time; in unlawful arrest, it is committed by making
an arrest not authorized by law.

747

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

TITLE NINE
Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

No period of detention is fixed by law in Article 269, but the motive
of the offender is controlling.
Suppose the detention is more or less than three days, will the
case fall under Article 267 or Article 269?

What is punished is the deliberate failure of the custodian of the
minor to restore the latter to his parents or guardian.

Art. 270

The motive of the offender is controlling; if his purpose is to
deliver him to the proper authorities, it is still unlawful arrest. But
absence of this motive may be shown by the length of time the victim
is detained.

While the penalty for kidnapping and failure to return a minor

P300.00, or both.

They are:

Kidnapping and failure to return a minor. (Art. 270)

Section 5 of R.A. No. 18, amending Article 270, punishes not the

Is there a conflict between Article 267 and Article 270?

—

Art. 270. Kidnapping and failure to return a minor.
The penalty of reclusion perpetua4 shall be imposed upon
any person who, being entrusted with the custody of a minor
person, shall deliberately fail to restore the latter to his
parents or guardians. (As amended by RA. No. 18)

Elements:
1.

That the offender is entrusted with the custody of a minor
person (whether over or under seven years but less than 18
years of age).

2.

That he deliberately fails to restore the said minor to his
parents or guardians.

Age of minor is under 18 years.

The age of majority is 18 years old under R.A. No. 6809.
‘See Appendix “A," Table of Penalties, No. 36.
748

Article 270, as amended by Section 5 of R.A. No. 18, punishes
the deliberate failure by the person having the custody of the minor
to restore such minor to his parents or guardian.

Under Article 267, the kidnapping of a minor is also punished.
While under Article 270, the offender is entrusted with the custody
of the minor, in Article 267, the offender is not entrusted with the
custody of the victim.
Kidnapping and failure to return a minor under Article 270 Is
necessarily included in Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention
of Minor under paragraph 4 of Article 267.

The offense as charged, kidnapping and failure to return a minor
under Article 270 of the Revised Penal Code, is necessarily included in
the offense proved, which is kidnapping and serious illegal detention
of a minor under Article 267(4) of the same Code, inasmuch as the
essential ingredients of the offense charged constitute or form a part
of those constituting the offense proved. Thus, deliberate failure to
restore a minor under one’s custody and kidnapping a minor who is
not in custody both constitute deprivation of liberty. Besides, there
is authority to the effect that paragraph 1 of Article 270 might have
749

been superseded by Article 267, as amended, which punishes as
serious illegal detention, the kidnapping of a minor, regardless of the
purpose of detention. (People v. Jo, 143 SCRA 552)
Essential element which qualifies the crime of kidnapping a minor
under Article 270.
The essential element is that the offender is entrusted with the
custody of the minor. What is punished in kidnapping a minor under
Article 270 is the deliberate failure of the offender having the custody
of the minor to restore him to his parents or guardian.

It is not necessary that the purpose of the offender is to separate
permanently the minor from his parents or guardian. Paragraph 1 of
Article 270 which required it was abolished by R.A. No. 18. The ruling
in the case of U.S. v. Peralta, et al., 8 Phil. 200, is no longer applicable.

People v. Paalam
(CA., 54 O.G. 8267-8268)

Facts: In a conversation she had with the minors Diansin Yap and Inn
Samain, the accused told said minors that Manila was a big city; that the
movie houses there were bigger and better than those found in Jolo; that
the City was a better place to live in; that she would take them with her to
Manila; and that they need not worry about the expenses incident to their

going to and stay in that City as she would defray them all. The accused was
19 years old and Diansin Yap and Inn Samain were 14. The accused was
a mere maid, while Diansin Yap and Inn Samain were school children, the
former being the niece and the latter the daughter of ladies who were much

more affluent than the accused.
Held: The accused is not guilty of the crime of inducing a minor to
abandon his home. In order for an inducement of a minor to abandon the
home of his parents or guardian or the person entrusted with his custody
to constitute the crime penalized under Article 271 of the R.P.C., it is
essential that the inducement be actual, committed with criminal intent,
and determined by a will to cause damage. The representations made by the
accused to said minors highly praising the City of Manila and her offer and
promise to take them to that city, as narrated above, clearly do not constitute
that inducement which is essential to the act. The phrase “to induce” means
“to influence; to prevail on; to move by persuasion; to incite by motives."

Since there was very little difference in their ages, and there could not
have been much difference in the degree of their intelligence, it cannot be

Elements:
1.

That the minor is living in the home of his parents or guardian
or the person entrusted with his custody.

That the offender induces said minor to abandon such home.

supposed that the accused commanded such ascendancy over Diansin Yap
and Inn Samain as to be able to prevail on them, or that the latter were so
gullible as to believe outright the promise of a mere maid, a minor like them,
with no other source of income except the small salary that she was receiving
as such. The probabilities are that these girls abandoned their respective

homes moved by the irresponsible spirit of restlessness and adventure which
is commonly found in the youth of today, and not because of the offer and
promise made them by the accused.

“Shall induce a minor to abandon the home.”

In view of this phrase, what constitutes the crime is the act of
inducing a minor to abandon his home or the home of his guardian,
and it is not necessary that the minor actually abandons the
home.
People v. Apolinar
(CA., 62 O.G. 9044)

Facts: At about 3:30 p.m. on September 16, 1963 in Cabanatuan City,
appellant met Myrna, a 12-year-old girl who was living with her parents in
Vijandre District of said city. They were together until about seven o’clock
in the evening.
From what can be gleaned and gathered from Myrna’s testimony,
it appears that she had just come from a show when she was accosted by
appellant who asked her where Sta. Mesa was. She replied that there was
no Sta. Mesa in Cabanatuan City. Appellant held her by the hand and
said if she would go with appellant to Sta. Mesa, the latter would give
her plenty of clothes. Frightened, Myrna demurred. She tried to free her
hand but appellant warned her and threatened to kill her if she would
shout. Appellant then took her for a walk until they reached the Avenue
Theatre on Burgos Avenue where they tarried looking at the pictures on
display. Thereafter, they continued walking. At the Pacific Restaurant on
Sanciangco Street, appellant bought ‘balut’ eggs and gave one to Myrna
whom she again asked to go with her to Sta. Mesa. Appellant then talked
to a man in constabulary uniform with her back towards Myrna who, seeing
an opportunity, ran away and went to the house of her classmate where she
slept that night. The following morning, she and her father reported the
matter to the police authorities.
Appellant contends that to sustain conviction under the law in
question, it must be shown that because of the inducement, the minor decided
or was actually persuaded to leave and abandon his house.

Held: (The] [Court] find[s] no merit in the contention. The law is
intended to discourage and prevent disruption of filial relationships and
undue interference with the parents’ right and duty to the custody of their
minor children and to rear them. In view of the reason for the penal provision
and the clear import of the words “shall induce,’ the mere commission of
any act which tends to influence, persuade or prevail on a minor to abandon
his home is what constitutes the crime. So long as the inducement is done
maliciously and with criminal intent, its effect on the minor, i.e., whether
by reason thereof he actually decides to abandon his home, is immaterial.

762

Art. 271

The minor should not leave his home of his own free will.
Belen Cabalfin, a minor 15 years old, who was on her way to
church was approached and asked by Soledad Belo if she wanted
to go to Manila. Because of a promise that she would find a job and
could continue her studies in Manila, Belen finally agreed and after
coming from the church, Soledad immediately conducted her to the
house of the accused.

Held: There is no question that the minor Belen did not abandon
her parental home of her own free will, but was induced to do so
because of the aforesaid promise of Soledad Belo and the accused.
(People v. Ricarte, CA., 49 O.G. 974)

Note: But if the minor would leave his home of his own free
will and would go and live with another person, the latter is not
criminally liable.
Father or mother may commit crimes under Articles 270 and 271.

Under Article 271, where the father and mother are living
separately, and the custody of their minor child has been given to
one of them, the other parent who kidnaps such minor child from the
one having the lawful custody of said child or induces such minor to
leave his home is liable.
“Any of the crimes covered by the two preceding articles."

Article 269, which defines and punishes unlawful arrest, could
not be contemplated in the second paragraph of Article 271. It should
read, “If the person committing any of the crimes covered by the
preceding article and the first paragraph of this article shall be the

Circumstance qualifying the offense.

If the purpose of the offender is to assign the offended party to
some immoral traffic (prostitution), the penalty is higher.

Elements:

1.

That the offender retains a minor in his service.

2.

That it is against the will of the minor.

3.

That it is under the pretext of reimbursing himself of a debt
incurred by an ascendant, guardian or person entrusted with
the custody of such minor.

Distinguished from kidnapping or Illegal detention.

The service of the minor must be against his will.

When the act or manner of committing the offense is by
kidnapping or detaining, how is the crime of slavery distinguished
from kidnapping or illegal detention?

Note the phrase “against the (minor’s) latter's will’; hence, if
the minor consents to the offender’s retaining his services, there is
no violation of this article.

The purpose must be determined. If the purpose is to enslave the
victim, it is slavery; otherwise, it is kidnapping or illegal detention.

Indebtedness, not a ground for detention.

"For the purpose of enslaving him.”

In a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, it appears that the
respondent refused to permit a girl to go until the amount advanced
for her fare and subsistence was repaid to an employment agency.

The employment or custody of a minor with the consent of the
parent or guardian although against the child’s own will cannot be
considered involuntary servitude. (U.S. v. Cabanag, 8 Phil. 64)

persons and

What are the crimes called abandonment of helpless persons and
exploitation of minors?

They are:

Elements:
1.

That the offender compels a debtor to work for him, either as
household servant or farm laborer.

1.

Abandonment of persons in danger and abandonment of
one’s victim. (Art. 275)

2.

That it is against the debtor's will.

2.

Abandoning a minor. (Art. 276)

3.

That the purpose is to require or enforce the payment of a debt.

3.

Abandonment of minor by person entrusted with his
custody; indifference of parents. (Art. 277)

4.

Exploitation of minors. (Art. 278)

“As household servant or farm laborer.”

If a person is compelled by the accused to work for him as office
janitor to enforce the payment of a debt, will there be a violation of
this article? No. This Article specifically provides that the debtor is
compelled to work as household servant or farm laborer.
Slavery is punished.

This Article, like Article 273, punishes a form of slavery. Note
that this article does not distinguish whether the victim is a minor
or not.
Under this article, the debtor himself is the one compelled
to work for the offender. Under Article 273, it is the minor who is
compelled to render services for the supposed debt of his parent or
guardian. Under Article 273, the service of the minor is not limited
to household and farm work.

Paragraph 2 of Article 275 applies only when someone is accidentally
injured by the accused.

1.

By failing to render assistance to any person whom the
offender finds in an uninhabited place wounded or in
danger of dying when he can render such assistance
without detriment to himself, unless such omission shall
constitute a more serious offense.

Elements:

Note the use of the word "accidentally’’ in the article. Hence,
if a person intentionally stabs or shoots another who is wounded
and he does not render him assistance, that person is not liable
under this article. He is liable only for the crime resulting from the
stabbing or shooting, which may be physical injuries or homicide if
the victim dies.

a.

The place is not inhabited-,

b.

The accused found there a person wounded or in
danger of dying-,

c.

The accused can render assistance without detriment
to himself;

(Albert)

d.

The accused fails to render assistance.

Does paragraph 3 apply to one who found a lost child?

Must the offender know that the child is under seven years?

Under the third way of committing the crime, it is immaterial
that the offender did not know that the child is under seven years.

2.

By failing to help or render assistance to another whom
the offender has accidentally wounded or injured.

It would seem that such child also needs the same protection
that the law intends to extend to an abandoned child.

3.

the offender has found abandoned, to the authorities or to
his family, or by failing to take him to a safe place.

"Shall fail to take him to a safe place.”

The child under seven years of age must be found by the accused
in an unsafe place.

"Any person whom he shall find x x x wounded or in danger of
dying.”

Thus, if a person intentionally wounded another in an uninhab¬
ited place, paragraph 1 of Article 275 is not applicable, because he
did not find him wounded or in danger of dying in that place.

Omission constituting a more serious offense.

TITLE NINE
Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

When the death of the minor shall result from such
abandonment, the culprit shall be punished by prision
correccional in its medium and maximum periods^ but if the
life of the minor shall have been in danger only, the penalty
shall be prision correccional in its minimum and medium
periods.4
The provisions contained in the two (2) preceding
paragraphs shall not prevent the imposition of the penalty
provided for the act committed, when the same shall constitute
a more serious offense. (As amended by RA. No. 10951)

Intent to kill cannot be presumed from the death of the child.
The ruling that the intent to kill is presumed from the death
of the victim of the crime is applicable only to crimes against
persons, and not to crimes against security, particularly the crime
of abandoning a minor under Article 276.

Elements:

Art. 276

Art. 277

A permanent, conscious and deliberate abandonment is required
in this article.

Under the first paragraph of Article 276, the law penalizes the
mere abandonment of a child even when his life is not endangered,
so long as there is an interruption of the care and protection he needs
by reason of his tender age.

1.

That the offender has the custody of a child.

The abandonment referred to in this article is not the momentary
leaving of the child, but the abandonment which deprives him of
the care and protection from danger to his person. The act must be

3.

That he abandons such child.

Circumstances qualifying the offense.

4.

That he has no intent to kill the child when the latter is
abandoned.

1.

When the death of the minor resulted from such abandonment;
or
If the life of the minor was in danger because of the
abandonment.

When there is intent to kill, this article does not apply.

2.

The offender in abandoning a minor has no intent to kill the
latter. His purpose in abandoning the minor under his custody is to
avoid the obligation of taking care of the minor.

Parents guilty of abandoning their children shall be deprived of
parental authority.

If there is intent to kill and the child dies, the crime would be
either murder, parricide, or infanticide, as the case may be. If the
child did not die, it is attempted murder, parricide, or infanticide, as
the case may be.

If the offender is the parent of the minor who is abandoned, he
shall be deprived of parental authority. (Art. 332, C.C.)

Reason: The provisions contained in Article 276 shall not prevent
the imposition of the penalty provided for the act committed, when
the same shall constitute a more serious offense. (Art. 276, par. 3)

Art. 277. Abandonment of minor by person entrusted with
his custody; indifference of parents. The penalty of arresto

the one who entrusted such child to his care or, in the absence
of the latter, without the consent of the proper authorities.
The same penalty shall be imposed upon the parents who
shall neglect their children by not giving them the education

permits. (As amended by RA. No. 10951)

TITLE NINE
Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

The word “rear” means to bring to maturity by educating,

nourishing, etc. as, to rear children.

Abandonment of minor by person entrusted with custody
distinguished from abandonment of a minor under Article 276.
1.

In abandoning a minor under Article 276, the custody of the
offender is stated in general; in Article 277, the custody of
the offender is specific, that is, the custody for the rearing or
education of the minor.

2.

In Article 276, the minor is under seven years of age; in Article
277, the minor is under 21 years of age. (Note: The age of
majority is now reduced to 18 years old by RA. No. 6809)
While in Article 276, the minor is abandoned in such a way
as to deprive him of the care and protection that his tender
years need; in Article 277, the minor is delivered to a public
institution or other person.

Acts punished under Article 277.

1.

2.

By delivering a minor to a public institution or other persons
without the consent of the one who entrusted such minor to the
care of the offender or, in the absence of that one, without the
consent of the proper authorities.
By neglecting his (offender’s) children by not giving them the
education which their station in life requires and financial
condition permits.

Elements of abandonment of minor by one charged with the rearing
or education of said minor.

Art. 277

minor.

c.

That his station in life requires such education and his financial
condition permits it.

b.

That he delivers said minor to a public institution or other
persons.

c.

That the one who entrusted such child to the offender has
not consented to such act; or if the one who entrusted such
child to the offender is absent, the proper authorities have not
consented to it.

Only the person charged with “the rearing or education” of the
minor is liable.

Thus, one who found a Negrito child in the forest and brought
her to Manila where he gave her to another person, as he could not
support her, is not guilty under this Article, because he was not
charged with “the rearing or education” of the minor. (U.S. v. Payog,
1 Phil. 185)

762

Obligation to educate children terminates, if mother and children
refuse without good reason to live with accused.

Thus, when the accused had to go to another province where
he was able to earn a living and his wife and children refused to go
with him there, said accused is not liable for abandoning his family
and for neglecting his children. (People v. Miraflores, CA., G.R. No.
43384, V. L. J., 382)

Failure to give education must be due to deliberate desire to evade
such obligation.

Thus, when the father lost his employment and he had no
other means of income and had to rest following medical advice, his
failure to give money for the support and education of his children

is not a violation of this article. Nobody is obliged to accomplish the
impossible. Article 277 contemplates cases in which the father or
mother, having the means, deliberately fails to give to their children
the education which their station in life requires and financial
condition permits. (People v. Francisco, C-A., 51 O.G. 1941, citing 7
Viada, Codigo Penal 5, Ed. 223)
Neglect of child is excluded from the coverage of R.A. No. 7610.

Article 59(4) of P.D. No. 603 attaches criminal liability to any
parent who neglects the child by not giving him the education which
the family’s station in life and financial conditions permit. Section
10(a) of R.A. No. 7610 expressly penalizes any person who commits
other acts of neglect, child abuse, cruelty or exploitation x x x including
those covered by Article 59 of P.D. No. 603 “but not covered by the
Revised Penal Code."
The “neglect of child” punished under Article 59(4) of P.D. No.
603 is also a crime (known as “indifference of parents”) penalized
under the second paragraph of Article 277 of the Revised Penal Code.
Hence, it is excluded from the coverage of R.A. No. 7610. (De Guzman

TITLE NINE

Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Art. 280

To commit trespass, the entrance by the accused should be
against the presumed or express prohibition of the occupant, and the
lack of permission should not be confused with prohibition. (People
v. De Peralta, 42 Phil. 69)
Lack of permission does not amount to prohibition.
It is not necessary in the ordinary life of men, in order to call at
the door of a house or to enter it, to obtain the previous permission
from the owner who lives in it. With the utmost good faith, a person, to
whom entrance has not been denied beforehand, may suppose that the
owner of the house has no objection to receiving him in it. (Groizard,
cited in People v. Peralta, 42 Phil. 69)

(Art. 128)

In general, all members of a household must be presumed to have
authority to extend an invitation to enter the house.

Dwelling place, defined.

Thus, an invitation to enter a dwelling, extended by a girl 12
years old, an inmate thereof, was held sufficient to justify the claim
that the entry was not made against the occupant’s will, in the absence
of express prohibition on his part. (U.S. v. Dulfo, 11 Phil. 75)

Dwelling place, as used in this article, means any building or
structure exclusively devoted for rest and comfort, as distinguished
from places devoted to business, offices, etc.

In the case of People v. Lamahang, 61 Phil. 703, a store of cheap
goods, which was also the dwelling place of the owner thereof, was
considered a dwelling. The accused was found guilty of attempted
trespass to dwelling.
Whether a building is a dwelling house or not depends upon the
use to which it is put. A barn may be converted into a dwelling house
or a dwelling house into a barn, by a change of use.
Dwelling includes a room when occupied by another person.

Neither the nature of the crime nor the responsibility of its
perpetrator is altered by the fact that the accused was living, as a
boarder, in the same house of which the room of the offended occupant
he entered was a part. (U.S. v. Silvano, 31 Phil. 510)
Entrance into dwelling must be against the will of owner or occupant

Note the word “against” used in the law, to distinguish the case
from a mere lack of consent of the dweller, because the mere absence
of his consent is not enough to constitute the crime of trespass to
dwelling.
768

There must be opposition on the part of the owner of the house to
the entry of the accused.

Thus, where the owner of the house, upon meeting the accused
at the door, took the accused by the hand and requested him to be
seated, it is clear that there was no trespass to dwelling, because
there was no opposition on the part of the owner of the house to the
entry of the accused. (U.S. v. Flemister, 1 Phil. 355; U.S. v. Dionisio,
et al., 12 Phil. 283)
implied prohibition.

It is a well-settled rule that whoever enters the dwelling of
another at late hour of the night after the inmates have retired and
closed their doors does so against their will. Under these circumstances
an express prohibition is not necessary, as it is presumed. (U.S. v.
Mesina, 21 Phil. 615; U.S. v. Panes, 25 Phil. 292)
The fact that the door of the room was only fastened by a string

too weak and inadequate to hold it fast, does not alter the fact that
769

Art. 280

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

the offended party wished it to be understood that she did not desire
anyone to enter without her express consent. (U.S. v. Silvano, 31
Phil. 509)
There was implied prohibition to enter the dwelling in a case
where the owner thereof had told the defendants to wait in the open
porch and then closed the door behind him as he entered the drawing
room. ( Gabriel v. People, 96 Phil. 10)

Prohibition Is implied in entrance through the window.

While it is true that the window was open when the defendants
passed through it in order to gain entrance into the house, there is
an implied prohibition when entrance is made through means not
intended for ingress. (People u. Marcial, C-A., 50 O.G. 3122)
Prohibition must be in existence prior to or at the time of entrance.
The facts or circumstances from which the objection of the
occupant may be inferred should be in existence prior to or at the
time of the entry.

In no event can facts arising after entry has been effected with
the express or implied consent of the occupant change the character of
the entry from one with consent to one contrary thereto. In this case,
the accused entered a house by the principal door, which they found
half-open. There was no opposition of any kind from the occupant at the
time of entrance by the accused. (U.S. v. Dionisio, et al., 12 Phil. 283)
Distinguish this ruling from that of U.S. v. Arceo, 3 Phil. 381.

In the case of U.S. v. Arceo, there was violence used by the
accused immediately after entrance without the consent of the owner
of the house.
What is intended to be protected and preserved by the law In
punishing trespass is the privacy of one's dwelling.

companion, Potenciano Villano, that they were going to demolish and repair
her house, to which Honorata Limpo objected. Unheeding this opposition,
and upon express orders by the appellant, his companions Potenciano Villano
and Antonio Dysionglo proceeded to gain entry into the house by means of
two ladders which they placed against the front wall.

Held: The defense pressed in the appeal is that the opposition registered
by Honorata Limpo was directed against the demolition or repair of her house
and not against the original entry of the appellant and his companions into
her dwelling.
But Honorata Limpo could not have consented to appellant’s intrusion
into the house, which made him a trespasser, for the very purpose already
objected to by her. Moreover, the method employed by appellant’s men in
effecting entry suggests prior refusal on the part of Honorata Limpo to admit
them through its stairs.
What is intended to be protected and preserved by the law is the
privacy of one’s dwelling, and, except in those cases enumerated in the
third paragraph of Article 280 of the R.P.C., criminal intent inheres in the
unwelcome visit of a trespasser.

Trespass under the second paragraph of Article 280.

When the crime of trespass is committed by means of violence
or intimidation, it is qualified in the sense that a higher penalty is
imposed.

Must violence refer to person only?

In the case of People v. Tayag, 59 Phil. 606 (1934), the Supreme
Court considered the act of the accused in loosening one of the bars of
the door by means of bolo and screw driver as trespass committed by
violence. Similarly, in People v. Lamahang, L-43530, August 3, 1935,
the Court considered the act of the accused in breaking the board of
a wall of a store and unfastening another board for the purpose of
entering said store to be trespass by means of violence.
Trespass by means of violence:
1.

Pushing the door violently and maltreating the occupants after
entering. (U.S. v. Paray, 17 Phil. 378)

2.

Cutting of a ribbon or string with which the door latch of a
closed room was fastened. The cutting of the fastenings of the
door was an act of violence. (U.S. v. Lindio, 10 Phil. 192)

Trespass by means of intimidation:

TITLE NINE
Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Art. 280

Trespass may be committed by the owner of a dwelling.

Thus, even supposing that the house belonged to the accused,
that fact alone did not authorize him to do anything with or enter the
house against the will of the actual occupant. He could have invoked
the aid of the court for the exercise or protection of his proprietary
rights. (People v. Almeda, et al., 75 Phil. 476)

1.

Firing a revolver in the air by persons attempting to force their
way into a house. (U.S. v. Ostrea, 2 Phil. 93)

2.

The flourishing of a bolo against inmates of the house upon
gaining entrance. (U.S. v, Lindio, 10 Phil. 192)

All trespassers ordinarily have intention to commit another crime,
but if there is no overt act of the crime intended to be committed,
the crime is only trespass to dwelling.

The violence or intimidation may take place Immediately after the
entrance.

Thus, even if the defendants desired to have carnal relation with
a mother and her two daughters when they broke into the house in
which the women were living and maltreated them, but the defendants
desisted from their original intention and left the house, they were
guilty of trespass to dwelling with violence. (U.S. v. Bamedo, et al.,
36 Phil. 851; U.S. v. Cabaraban, 36 Phil. 251)

The law which forbids entry (with violence) into the dwelling
of another relates not only to the method by which one may pass
the threshold of the dwelling of another, but also to the conduct
immediately after entrance of one who so enters. In this case, although
the couple already retired at that time, as it was between 8 and
9 o’clock at night, the wife’s sister was still awake and sitting up
sewing. But the accused entered the house without first obtaining
the permission of any person. Once inside, the accused wounded the
husband.

Held: Qualified trespass was committed. (U.S. v. Arceo, 3 Phil.
381)

Prohibition, not necessary when violence or intimidation Is
employed by the offender.

There is qualified trespass as long as there is violence or
intimidation employed, notwithstanding the fact that the door of the
house was already open and there was no express prohibition to the
entry. (U.S. v. Abanto, 15 Phil. 223)

In this case, the owner of the house was awakened by the accused
on the outside calling him by name; that when the owner of the house
opened the door and sought to recognize the accused, another man,
who was already upstairs alongside the staircase, struck the owner
of the house on the forehead with a wooden stick; and that as the
latter fell backward over a bench inside the house, the accused passed
through the door, threw himself upon the owner of the house, and
seized him by the throat.
772

The culprit who entered a dwelling through the window to steal
personal property, but was caught by the owner of the dwelling before
he could take any personal property, is guilty of trespass to dwelling,
not attempted robbery.
Where an intruder was caught in the act of forcibly attempting
to enter a dwelling, the crime is not attempted robbery but attempted
trespass to dwelling. (People v. Tayag and Morales, 59 Phil. 606, cited
in the case of People v. Lamahang, 61 Phil. 703)
Trespass to dwelling, when separate from other offense committed
in the dwelling.

The accused entered the dwelling of a captain by forcing his
way through the window. When found inside by the occupants who
tried to arrest him, the accused resisted arrest and stabbed the son
of the captain, inflicting a mortal wound. In his effort to escape, he
also assaulted the captain, his wife, and daughter. The son did not
die because of the timely and able medical attendance given by a
physician.

Held: The accused committed trespass to dwelling through
violence, frustrated homicide and less serious physical injuries.

2.

That the entrance is made while either of them is uninhabited.

Since in the Medina case, it seems that when the accused entered
the dwelling through the window he had no intent to kill any person
inside, but that the intent to kill came to his mind when he was being
arrested by the occupants thereof, the crime of trespass to dwelling
is a separate and distinct offense from frustrated homicide.

3.

That the prohibition to enter be manifest.

Cases to which the provisions of this article are not applicable:

his purpose.

TITLE NINE

Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Art. 282

The threat must be to inflict a wrong amounting to a crime upon
the person, honor, or property of the offended party or that of his
family.

Is it necessary that the wrong threatened to be inflicted must
amount to any of the crimes against persons, against honor, or against

property?

Suppose, A threatened B that unless the latter send to him
Pl,000, he would kidnap his son, would it be grave threats, considering
that the wrong threatened to be inflicted would amount to a crimp
against liberty?

It is believed that the crime committed is grave threats. Such
a threat affects the person of a member of the family of the offended
party.
Elements of grave threats where offender attained his purpose:
a.

That the offender threatens another person with the infliction
upon the latter’s person, honor, or property, or upon that of the
latter’s family, of any wrong.

b.

That such wrong amounts to a crime.

c.

That there is a demand for money or that any other condition
is imposed, even though not unlawful.

d.

That the offender attains his purpose.

Examples:

‘See Appendix “A," Table of Penalties, No. 1.

A sent C to B to tell, as in fact he told, the latter that if he would
not send Pl,000, A would burn B’s house. B sent the money to A. The
threat to bum the house of B involves a crime against his property,
which is arson.

776

A sent a letter to B in which A said that unless B would send to
him Pl,000, A would kill B. B sent Pl,000 to A. The threat to kill B
involves a crime against the person of B, which is homicide.

If the offender attained his purpose, the penalty one degree

—

A told B that unless the latter would give him Pl,000, he would
place inside his house a tin of opium and then he would report the
matter to the police. B sent Pl,000 to A. The threat involves the crime
of incriminating an innocent person. (Art. 363)

But threatening to publish a libel and offering to prevent such
publication for money is punished under Article 356, not under
Article 282.
Demand for money.

Thus, if, in the example above, A succeeded in having the
daughter ofB marry him, because of the threat, the penalty of prision
mayor shall be imposed. Prision mayor is the penalty one degree lower
from reclusion temporal, the penalty for homicide. Homicide is the
crime, A threatened to commit against B.

If the offender does not attain his purpose, the penalty is two
degrees lower than that provided by law for the crime threatened to
be committed.

Note that in the examples above, there is a demand for money.
In a case, the accused sent a letter to an old woman, threatening
her with death or the burning of her house unless she gave him
P500.00, which she must deposit in the place indicated to her in the
letter. When arrested and searched, the accused had in his pocketbook
an envelope on which was written the name of the offended party. It
was held that the accused was guilty of grave threats. (U.S. v. De la
Cruz, 28 Phil. 279)

When the threat is not subject to a condition, the penalty does
not depend on the penalty for the crime threatened to be committed.
The penalty is fixed at arresto mayor and a fine not exceeding P500.00.

"Or imposing any other condition, even though not unlawful.”

Circumstance qualifying the offense.

A seduced B’s daughter. Because A refused to marry her, B
threatened A with death, unless A would marry his said daughter.
Is B liable for grave threats?

If the threat is made in writing or through a middleman, the
penalty is to be imposed in its maximum period.

Yes. B threatened A with the infliction upon his person of a
wrong amounting to a crime (homicide), imposing a condition (unless
A would marry his daughter).

It will be noted that the condition imposed is not unlawful.
Nevertheless, since a threat to inflict a wrong amounting to a crime
was made, B is criminally liable for the crime of grave threats.
Imposing other condition — no demand for money.

A told B that if the latter would not give his daughter in marriage

to A, A would kill B. There is no demand for money, but a condition

Thus, if B refused to give his daughter to A in marriage, and the
latter is prosecuted and convicted, the penalty is prision correctional.

If the threat is not subject to a condition, the penalty is fixed.

Illustration of grave threats where the offender does not attain his
purpose.

A was madly in love withB, a woman. B rejectedA. Thereupon, A
threatened to kidnap or kill B if she would not treat him well. Because
of fear, B moved to and sought protection in the house of her cousin.
A wrote a letter and asked C to deliver it to B, threatening that if
she would not leave her hiding place and go with him, he would kill
her and her relatives. When B received the letter, she immediately
showed it to her cousin and on the same day the matter was reported
to the police.

consisting in that B should give his daughter in marriage to A is
imposed.

Held: A is guilty of the crime of grave threats. A did not attain
his purpose for which he wrote the letter, because of the intervention
of the police to whom the matter was reported. The purpose not

having been attained, the penalty to be imposed upon A should be

the penalty should be imposed in the maximum period. (People u.

April 7, 1999, petitioner reminded Indalecio of the water distribution scheme

a.

That the offender threatens another person with the infliction

b.

That such wrong amounts to a crime.

c.

That the threat is not subject to a condition.

Example:

The records show that at around 7:30 in the evening, Julia
Denido left her house to go to the barangay hall to report the mauling
of her husband which she witnessed earlier at around 4:00 o’clock
in the afternoon. On her way there, petitioner confronted her and
pointed a gun to her forehead, while at the same time saying “Soon ka
pupunta, gusto mo itoT Considering what transpired earlier between
petitioner and Julia’s husband, petitioner’s act of pointing a gun at
Julia’s forehead clearly enounces a threat to kill or to inflict serious
physical injury on her person. Actions speak louder than words. Taken
in the context of the surrounding circumstances, the uttered words
do not go against the threat to kill or to inflict serious injury evinced
by petitioner’s accompanying act.
Given the surrounding circumstances, the offense committed
falls under Article 282, paragraph 2 (grave threats) since: (1) killing
or shooting someone amounts to a crime; and (2) the threat to kill
was not subject to a condition. (Caluag v. People, G.R. No. 171511,
March 4, 2009)
Parea u. People
(G.R. No. 181626, May 30, 2011)

Facts: As punong barangay, petitioner allocated his constituents’ use
of communal water coming from a communal tank by limiting distribution
to the residents. The tank sits on a land located in the neighboring barangay
owned by complainant Vicente, father of complainant Indalecio. Despite
petitioners scheme, Indalecio continued drawing water from the tank. On
780

Art. 282

the flow of water from the ensuing leak, petitioner, using a borrowed bolo,

fashioned a wooden plug. When Indalecio arrived, petitioner, without any
warning, picked-up his bolo and charged towards Indalecio, shouting Patyon

Diosetea, who had followed him to the water tank. Upon seeing petitioner,

Diosetea inquired what was the matter. Instead of replying, petitioner shouted
Wala koy gipili, bisag babaye ka, patyon tikaurt (I don’t spare anyone, even if
you are a woman, I will kill you!). Diosetea similarly scampered and sought
refuge in the nearby house of a relative. Unable to pursue Diosetea, petitioner
turned his attention back to Indalecio. As petitioner chased Indalecio, he
passed Vicente, and, recognizing the latter, repeatedly thrust his bolo towards
him, shouting Bisag gulang ka, buk-on-nako imo ulol (Even if you are old, I
will crack open your skull!)
Held: Petitioner is guilty of three counts of Grave Threats. Petitioner’s
threat to kill Indalecio and Diosetea and crack open Vicente’s skull are wrongs
on the person amounting to (at the very least) homicide and serious physical
injuries as penalized under the Revised Penal Code. These threats were
consummated as soon as Indalecio, Diosetea, and Vicente heard petitioner

utter his threatening remarks. Having spoken the threats at different points
in time to these three individuals, albeit in rapid succession, petitioner
incurred three separate criminal liabilities.

Third form of grave threats must be serious and deliberate.
The third form of grave threats must be serious in the sense that
it is deliberate and that the offender persists in the idea involved in
his threats.
The threats of the third form are those made with the deliberate
purpose of creating in the mind of the person threatened the belief
that the threats will be carried into effect. (U.S. v. Paguirigan, 14
Phil. 453)
The threat should not be made in the heat of anger, because
such threat is punished under Article 285, paragraph 2.

In the third form of grave threats, there is no condition imposed or
there is no demand for money.
Note that in subdivision No. 2 of Article 282, the threat shall
not have been made subject to a condition.”
781

Art. 282

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

If the condition is not proved, It Is grave threats under subparagraph
2 of Article 282.

If, as claimed by appellant, Lt. Santos had no right or power to
place him under arrest, or if the order to arrest him were unlawful,
because he had not committed any offense, then he could, as stated
by him, rightfully resist the arrest even to the extent of using such
force as might be necessary to repel that employed in carrying-out
the lieutenant’s order. But the fact that Lt. Santos had ordered his
men to arrest appellant did not excuse or justify the latter in poking
his gun into the body of Lt. Santos with the threat to kill him. [The
Court] do[es] not agree with the Solicitor General that the crime
committed by appellant is that defined and punished under paragraph
1 of Article 282 of the Revised Penal Code, it being not correct that the
threats uttered by the appellant were “subject to the condition that
Lt. Santos would not insist upon arresting appellant and the latter
attained his purpose, as he was not arrested till the following day.”
If appellant was not taken into custody at that time, it was because
he succeeded in making good his escape by mixing with the crowd.
(People v. Lustre, et al., 57 O.G. 6457-6458)

Note: The accused was found guilty of grave threats under
subparagraph 2 of Article 282, and sentenced to four months and one
day of arresto mayor, and to pay a fine of P200.00.

Essence of the crime of threats is Intimidation.

In the crime of threats, it is essential that there be intimidation.
In the intimidation, there is promise of some future harm or
injury, either to the person, honor or property of the offended party
or of his family.
The act threatened to be committed must be wrong.

Note the phrase “threaten another with the infliction x x x of any
wrong” in the first paragraph of Article 282. So, the act threatened
to be done must be WRONG. In fact, any threat to commit a crime is
a threat to inflict a wrong.
A, boarder in the house ofB, seduced the latter’s daughter, 16
years old and a virgin. As A was not willing to marry
her, B threatened
to file a criminal action against him for qualified seduction, unless he
782

TITLE NINE
Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Art. 282

would marry her. Is B liable for grave threat? No. Filing a complaint

against A is not wrong.
But if B threatened to kill A, unless he would marry his daughter,
B would be liable for grave threats, because what he threatened to do
(to kill A) was wrong.
Grave threats may be committed by indirect challenge to a gunfight,
even if the complainant was absent when the challenge was made.

The accused went in front of the house of Rizal and shouted:
“You, Rizal, you fight in a gun duel.” The accused fired two warning
shots and thereafter threw stones at the roof of the house of Rizal,
but the latter was out having gone to another town. A few moments
later, after the accused had left, Rizal returned in a car and stopped
in front of his house. After Rizal had alighted from the car, a neighbor
reported to him the challenge made by the accused.
It was held that the indirect challenge to a gunfight amounted

to intimidation, especially when backed by two warning shots,
notwithstanding the fact that the complainant was not present at
the time the challenge was made, the Court of Appeals citing Viada,
Vol. VI, pp. 54-55, 4th edition. (People v. Sayon, CA., 64 O.G. 5089)

As the crime consists in threatening another with some future
harm, it is not necessary that the offended party was present at the
time the threats were made. It is sufficient that the threats, after
they had been made in his absence, came to the knowledge of the
offended party.
The crime of grave threats is consummated as soon as the threats
come to the knowledge of the person threatened.
Where the accused threatened to bury alive the two victims,
if they would not give the P50.00 demanded from each of them, the
accused were held guilty of two distinct offenses of grave threats,
even if the money was not delivered. The crime of grave threats is
consummated as soon as the threat comes to the knowledge of the
person threatened. (People v. Villanueva, et al., CA., 48 O.G. 1376)

Note: Whether the offender attained his purpose, the crime of
grave threats is consummated; for if he did not attain his purpose, it
is grave threats of the second form.

Thus, where the defendant struck the offended parties, saying
at the same time that he would kill them if they would not return to
him the jewelry which they had lost, it was held that the threat was
part of the assault. The defendant was convicted of maltreatment.
(U.S. v. Sevilla, 1 Phil. 143)
Threat, employed by the offender to commit acts of lasciviousness
or robbery, is not a separate crime, because it is the constitutive
element of intimidation in those crimes. Thus, if the accused, after
kissing, embracing and touching the private parts of a woman who was
resisting, threatened her that if she would not accede, her husband
would be killed by his companion who was then guarding him at the
first floor of the house, the crime committed is acts of lasciviousness
(Art. 336), and the threat is not a separate crime. (People v. Timbol,
CA., 47 O.G. 1868) Also, if the culprit, in taking the personal property
of the offended party with intent to gain, threatened to kill him and
succeeded in depriving the latter thereof, he is liable for robbery only.
The threat is not a separate offense.

Note: If there is another crime actually committed or the objective
of the offender is another crime, and the threat is only a means to
commit it or a mere incident in its commission, the threat is absorbed
by the other crime. But if the threat was made with the deliberate
purpose of creating in the mind of the person threatened, the belief
that the threat would be carried into effect, the crime committed is
grave threats, and the minor crime which accompanied it should be
disregarded.
The offender in grave threats does not demand the delivery on the

spot of the money or other personal property asked by him.

When the act consists in materially taking possession or
securing, on the spot, the delivery of the money or other personal
property, through the effect of fear or fright which the imminence of
the injury produces in the mind of the person intimidated, the nature
of the penal act is altered and constitutes, not threats, but the crime
of robbery with intimidation. (U.S. v. Osorio, 21 Phil. 237; People v.
Villanueva, et al., CA., 48 O.G. 1376)

Elements:
1.

That the offender makes a threat to commit a wrong.

2.

3.

That the wrong does not constitute a crime.
That there is a demand for money or that other condition is
imposed, even though not unlawful.

4.

That the offender has attained his purpose or, that he has not

Light threats are committed in the same manner as grave threats,
except that the act threatened to be committed should not be a
crime.
Note that light threat is committed “in the manner expressed
in subdivision 1 of the next preceding article,” except that the wrong
threatened to be committed does not constitute a crime.
“Made in the manner expressed in subdivision 1 of the next
preceding article.”

Light threats in Article 283 does not include a threat to commit
a wrong not constituting a crime, which is not subject to a condition.
The reason for this is that Article 283 states that the threat should be
made in the manner expressed in subdivision 1 of Article 282, which
requires that there be a demand for money or that other condition
be imposed.
Thus, when A threatens B with exposure without a demand for
money or other condition, Article 283 does not apply. When orally
made, Article 285, paragraph 3, applies, because this provision
requires no imposition of condition or demand for money.

(CA., 54 O.G. 5334)

Facts: According to an employee of the complainant, accused Hao Y.
Chao and Sia Sy Ho dropped by complainant’s store three or four times in
December 1953, and told the employee that they knew complainant had
bought a parcel of land in Binondo, that she had evaded payment of taxes; and
that they were going to report the case to the authorities. When complainant
learned of the matter, she became fearful, especially since she did not know
the accused. She then instructed her employee to tell them to wait and to
give them drinks if they come back. Thus, when the two accused came back
to the store, the employee kept them waiting while complainant contacted
the office of the city mayor, reporting the presence of the accused. Detectives
Jueco and Tamayo were thus dispatched.
Det. Jueco, pretending to be a Chinese customer and reading the
Chinese newspaper, seated himself in a corner. The pair then showed
complainant a piece of paper concerning her acquisition of a piece of land in
Binondo and, accusing her of tax evasion, threatened to report the matter
to the BLR and the NBI, for which she would be prosecuted and deported,
unless she come across with Pl,000. Complainant then handed Pl,000 to
her employee who in turn delivered the same to Hao Y. Chao. The money
was subsequently turned over to Sia Sy Ho who pocketed it. Det. Jueco then
arrested the accused from whom he recovered the amount of P1.000.
Accused were found guilty of grave threats. Sia Sy Ho’s counsel argued
that the alleged threat upon the complainant, by telling her that she would
be reported to the Bureau of Internal Revenue for tax evasion, does not
amount to a crime.

Held: The Court agrees with the view of Sia Sy Ho’s counsel that the
threat does not amount to a crime. However, Sia Sy Ho, together with his co¬
accused, committed another crime - that of light threats. As the threat made
by the accused, that they would report the offended party to the authorities,

Compared with Article 35.

Article 35 provides for “bond to keep the peace.” This article
provides for“bond for good behavior.” Article 35 is not made applicable
to any particular case; Article 284 is applicable only to cases of grave
threats and light threats.

In “bond to keep the peace,” if the offender fails to give bond, he
shall be detained for a period not exceeding six months (if prosecuted
for grave or less grave felony) or not exceeding 30 days (if prosecuted
for light felony); in “bond for good behavior,” if he shall fail to give
bail, he shall be sentenced to destierro.
Bond to keep the peace is a distinct penalty. (See Art. 35)
The giving of bail is an additional penalty.

Note the words “may also be required” in this article, indicating
that it is an additional penalty. (Guevara)

TITLE NINE
Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Art. 285

“Without being included in the provisions of the next preceding

article.”
This means that there is no demand for money or that there is
no condition imposed when the offender threatens another with a

weapon, and that the case does not fall in subdivision No. 2 of Article
282.
Two acts are punished in paragraph 1.

1.

Threatening another with a weapon, even if there is no quarrel;

and
2.

Drawing a weapon in a quarrel, which is not in lawful self¬

defense.
Orally threatening another, in the heat of anger, with some harm
constituting a crime is punished in paragraph 2.

The phrase “shall orally threaten another with some harm not
constituting a crime” is employed in paragraph 2 of Article 285. This
is totally at odds with its Spanish counterpart, for what the latter
contemplates is clearly “amenazare a otro con causarle un mal que
constituya delito.” There is accordingly a mistake in the English
translation of the law. The word not should, therefore, be eliminated
from the statute
in English. Hence, a person who, in the heat
of anger, threatened to kill another without persisting in the idea
involved in his threat is liable under paragraph 2 of Article 285.
(People v. Untalan, 1 CA. Rep. 243)

—

“Who by subsequent acts shows that he did not persist in the idea
involved in his threat.”

In a quarrel between the wife of the accused and the offended
party, the accused took part, threatening to kill the offended party.
The accused went home to get his revolver and returned to the place,
looking for the offended party, who in the meantime had concealed
himself in his house. Later, the accused called at the house of the
brother of the offended party and implored pardon, alleging that
the threat was uttered without premeditation. It was held that the
offense was light threat (U.S. u. Estrada, 10 Phil. 583), because the
accused by subsequent acts showed that he did not persist in the idea
involved in his threat.
789

Art. 285

TITLE NINE

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

Article 285, compared with Article 282 and Article 283.

Threats under paragraph 2 of Article 285 is similar to the third
form of grave threats (Art. 282), because the harm threatened to be
committed is a crime.
Threats under paragraph 3 of Article 285 is similar to light
threats (Art. 283), because the harm threatened to be committed is
not a crime.
The difference lies in the fact that in other light threats (Art.
285), there is no demand for money or that there is no condition
imposed or that the threat is not deliberate.

A person who, flourishing a cane in an excited manner, ordered
the men engaged in transplanting rice upon the land claimed by him
to stop their work and leave, threatening to kill them unless they
obeyed, is guilty under paragraph 2 of Article 285, because (1) the
threat was made in the heat of anger, and (2) the subsequent acts of
the accused showed that he did not persist in the idea involved in his
threat. (U.S. v. Paguirigan, 14 Phil. 450)

In a heated argument between him and the offended party,
the accused said that he would cut her to pieces, making aggressive
gestures and trying to attack her with a bolo. A person present caught
his wrist and held it up tightly. Nothing more happened. The accused
was guilty of other light threats under Article 285, paragraph 2.
(People v. Padayhag, 36 O.G. 3265, May 15, 1937)
Threats which ordinarily are grave threats, if made In the heat of
anger, may be other light threats.
The accused who threatens another, specifically and expressly,
with the infliction upon the latter’s person of a wrong amounting to
a crime (“I will shoot you”), imposing a condition therefor (“If you
will not leave the place”), is, ordinarily, guilty of the crime of grave
threats under Article 282(1) of the Revised Penal Code. Where,
however, the accused had flung the threat in a sudden flare of anger
following the offended party’s initial disregard of his command to
“leave the place,” which the offended party had mistaken for a “joke,”
the crime committed is only other light threats under Article 285 of
the same Code. (People u. Tongco, CA., 60 O.G. 1422, citing U.S. v.
Paguirigan, 14 Phil. 450; People v. Bantug, CA.G.R. Nos. 11304 05,

Two ways of committing grave coercions.

There are two ways of committing grave coercions:
1.

By preventing another, by means of violence, threats or
intimidation, from doing something not prohibited by law.

2.

By compelling another, by means of violence, threats or
intimidation, to do something against his will, whether it be
right or wrong.

Elements of grave coercions:

The three elements of grave coercions are:
1. That a person is prevented by another from doing something
not prohibited by law, or compelled to do something against his
or her will, be it right or wrong;
2. That the prevention or compulsion is effected by violence,
either by material force or such a display of it as would produce
intimidation and, consequently, control over the will of the
offended party; and
3. That the person who restrains the will and liberty of another has
no right to do so. (Barbosa v. Tuquero, G.R. No. 163898, December

TITLE NINE
Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Art. 286

The defendant accosted Oscar Flores and upon learning that the
latter had reported for work, told him not to go to work the next day; that
on the next day, Oscar Flores went to work in spite of defendant’s advice;
and that in the afternoon of that day, the defendant, accompanied by two
unidentified persons, approached Oscar Flores, who was walking along
Quezon Boulevard, and gave him fist blows on the face, and when the latter
fell, kicked him on the chest. There was no evidence of the nature of the
physical injuries inflicted.
Do the acts committed by the defendant constitute the crime of grave

coercion?
Held: In the crime of grave coercion, the person coercing must have

restrained his victim from doing something, not prohibited by law, at the
time he wanted to do it. The coercing person must have exerted violence

Coercion by preventing.

on his victim at the very moment that the latter is doing or is about to do
something he wants to do. If the defendant, however, had told the complainant
not to do something he desired to do, but the complainant went ahead and
did it, without the defendant doing anything to prevent him, and after the
complainant had finished doing it, the defendant exerted violence on him,
the crime committed was unjust vexation, not grave coercion.

A was harvesting palay on a disputed piece of land. B, claiming
to have a right to the property, by means of violence prevented A
from harvesting the palay.

Had the defendant waylaid Oscar Flores while he was on his way to
work and then prevented him, by means of violence, from going to his work,
he would have been guilty of grave coercion.

What is prevented must not be prohibited by law.

When the act of preventing is another crime.

Note the phrase “not prohibited by law” in the first paragraph
of Article 286.

A public officer who shall prevent by means of violence or
threats the ceremonies or manifestations of any religion is guilty of
interruption of religious worship. (Art. 132)

The thing prevented from execution must not be prohibited
by law; otherwise, there will be no coercion. Thus, no coercion is
committed by one who prevents a murderer from carrying out his
wicked purpose.

Any person who, by force, prevents the meeting of a legislative
body is liable under Article 143.

In grave coercion, the act of preventing by force must be made at
the time the offended party was doing or about to do the act to be
prevented. If the act was already done when violence is exerted,
the crime is unjust vexation.

ground, to compel her to admit having stolen the clothes of one of
the accused.
793

Art. 286

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The accused testified that they merely endeavored to bring the
complainant to the teniente del barrio for investigation. Such purpose
certainly does not excuse their compelling her to go with them if she
was not willing to do so; and they admittedly had no warrant for
her arrest or any lawful authorization to force her to go with them.
Coercion is committed by the unauthorized compelling of another
person against his will to do something, whether Just or unjust; its
essence being an attack on the individual liberty. (6 Viada, 5th Ed.,
p. 80, cited in People v. Fernando, et al., 43 O.G. 1717)
Compelling another to do something includes the offender’s act of
doing it himself while subjecting another to his will.

The sergeant of police and the municipal president of a town
wanted to cross a private bridge which was closed. They were refused
passage because they were on a heavy truck. What they did was to
open the bridge, grabbed and pushed the caretaker who fell to the
ground. One of them pulled out a revolver ready to shoot.

Held: They committed grave coercion. (People v. Juan, et al.,
CA„ 36 O.G. 3277)

Note: The caretaker was compelled by means of violence to allow
them to cross the private bridge.
When the complainant is in the actual possession of a thing, even
If he has no right to that possession, compelling him by means of
violence to give up the possession, even by the owner himself, is
grave coercion.
U.S. v. Mena
(11 Phil. 543)

Facts: The three carabaos of A entered the rice paddies of B, causing
considerable damage thereto. B took possession of the three carabaos and

refused to return them to A, unless the latter would pay for the damage done.
A did not deny B’s right to compensation, but he was not at that time ready
to make payment. The next day, B and his son set out to take the animals to
the justice of the peace for the purpose of depositing them in his care until
the question of damages could be settled in court. On the road, they met A
in company with some other persons. When A came to know that B and his
son were taking the carabaos to the justice of peace and refused to give them
back to him, A drew his bolo, rushed at B’s son, who was then mounted on
one of the carabaos ahead of B and leading another carabao with a rope, and
794

TITLE NINE
Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Art. 286

cut that rope. With threats of bodily harm, A compelled B to turn loose the

carabao on which he was riding.

Was A guilty of grave coercion?

Held: Yes. With violence, he compelled 13 to do that which the latter
did not desire to do, to turn over the possession of the carabaos to him, and
it matters not whether it was right or wrong.
It is a maxim of the law that no man is authorized to take the law into
his hands and enforce his rights with threats or violence except in certain
well-defined cases where one acts in the necessary defense of one’s life,
liberty, or property.

A dispute having arisen as to the right of possession, and the carabaos
being actually in the possession of B, it was the duty of A, if he desired to
enforce his claim, to seek the aid of the proper judicial authority; and had
he thus asserted his claim in the orderly manner provided by law, he would
have secured not only the possession of the animals, but damages for their
detention, upon proof of the justice of his claim.
Suppose, the carabaos were in A's possession and B wanted to get them,
because they had entered his rice paddies and caused considerable damage
thereto, and A by means of violence or intimidation prevented B from taking
them, is A liable for grave coercion?

No. As an owner and actual possessor of the carabaos, A had a right to
use such force as may be reasonably necessary to prevent B from dispossessing
him of his property. (Art. 429, Civil Code)

When the act of compelling is another offense.

But a public officer who, not being authorized by law, compels
a person to change his residence is liable for expulsion under Article
127, not for coercion.
Kidnapping the debtor to compel him to pay his debt is not only
coercion, but kidnapping for ransom, because in effect, there is a
demand for payment that releases from captivity. (Art. 267)

“Whether it be right or wrong."

Note this phrase in the first paragraph of Article 286.
Facts: A entrusted a pig to B. Later, A wanted to get it back,
but B refused, claiming that it belonged to another person. A took it

Art 286

Violence, threats or intimidation.

Before Article 286 was amended by R.A. No. 7659, violence was
mentioned as the only means to prevent or to compel an offended
party although it was held that to constitute coercion, intimidation
is sufficient, without necessity of actually laying hands on the person
coerced. (U.S. v. Tupular, 7 Phil. 8)

As amended by R.A. No. 7659, violence, threats or intimidation
may be used to prevent or to compel the offended party.
The taxi driver who threatened to bump his car to kill himself and
his female passenger, if she would not go with him to a night club,
is guilty of grave coercion.

Patrocinio Tira and Concepcion Julaton boarded a Royal Taxi
cab driven by the accused whom they told to drive to General Luna
Street near St. Louis School. At the latter place, Concepcion Julaton
alighted leaving Patrocinio Tira behind. While on the way to and
before reaching Ferguson Road, the accused urged her to go with him
to a night club. Patrocinio Tira refused and told the accused to stop
so that she could get off and go home even by walking. But instead,
the accused increased the speed of the taxicab and at the same time
told her that if she would not go with him to the nightclub, he “would
bump the car even if we would both die.” Fearing that the accused
might carry out his threat, she opened the right rear door and jumped
out while the taxicab was running. She fell on the pavement and
became unconscious. She suffered injuries on the head and bruises
on the body.
Held: Under the above circumstances, it is clear that the accused
was guilty of the crime of grave coercion as defined and penalized in
paragraph 1 of Article 286. (People v. Rimando, CA., 56 O.G. 1687)
Note: In the case of People v. Rimando, the accused wanted the
offended party to go with him to a night club at the time he made
the threat. The accused did not succeed, because the offended party
796

Art. 286

jumped out of the taxicab. The crime of grave coercion is consummated
made by the accused that he “would bump the car even if we would
both die” takes the place of, or is equivalent to, the element of violence.
The intimidation was intended to control the will of the offended party.
The crime is not grave coercion when the violence is employed to
seize anything belonging to the debtor of the offender.
Thus, if a creditor, by means of violence, seized the personal

property of his debtor to apply the same to the payment of the debt,
the crime is light coercion under Article 287.
Not intimidation by display offeree, If arms are not used.
The mere fact that defendant with eight other individuals
appeared all armed and told the complainant to desist from
constructing the house on a piece of land, and that the said
complainant, evidently afraid of the presence of armed men, desisted,
does not constitute coercion, because those facts do not show violence,
and since defendant did not in any way intimidate the complainant,
there was no display of material force. (People v. Madamba, CA.-G.R.
No. 1029, December 1937)
Surrounding complainant in a notoriously threatening attitude is
sufficient.

But when the defendants presented themselves armed and
surrounded the complainant in a notoriously threatening attitude and
thereby created such a situation that they necessarily intimidated
the complainant and compelled him to leave, so that they could freely
take the palay already harvested, the defendants are guilty of grave
coercion. (People v. Irlanda, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 12, 223)
The force or violence must be immediate, actual or imminent.

The accused threatened the complainant that if he would not
pay his debt, he would be taken again and brought to a camp where
he would be killed. These threats were made in the house of another
person. The following day, the complainant returned to the house
and delivered the amount due.

797

Art. 286

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Held: It was contended that the delivery of the money was
the effect of a threat made the day before. There being no actual or
imminent force or violence exerted upon the complainant when he
delivered the amount, the accused cannot be held liable for coercion.
(People v. Romero, et al., C-A., 44 O.G. 4424)

Note: It would seem that there is grave threat in this case,
because (1) there was a condition imposed and (2) an act constituting
a crime was threatened to be committed.
"Without authority of law” to prevent or to compel.

The third element is taken from the phrase “without authority
of law" in the first paragraph of Article 286.

It means that the person who restrains the will and liberty of
another has not the right to do so as a private person or does not act
in the exercise of a duty in the case of a person with a duty to perform
or with authority as a public functionary.
The owner of a thing has no right to prevent interference with it
when interference is necessary to avert greater damage.

Art. 286

There is right to prevent in this case.
Thus, no coercion is committed by a father who, with violence,
prevents his unemancipated son from leaving his home just to
loiter around in the streets. Under the law, a father has the right to
discipline his unemancipated child.
A tenant, who used force to prevent himself from being deprived
of the possession of a parcel of land which he had already cultivated,
is not guilty of grave coercion. (People v. Reyes, C.A., 40 O.G. 1690)
Note: This ruling is justified under Article 429 of the New Civil
Code.
There is right to compel in this case.

An insane attempted to enter the house of one sick of cholera.
The doctor in attendance, at the request of the wife of the patient,
compelled by force and even threatened to shoot the insane man with
a revolver in order to compel him to leave the house.
Held: The doctor is not liable for coercion. (U.S. v. Calvo, 4 Phil.
201)

The owner of a thing has no right to prohibit the interference
of another with the same, if the interference is necessary to avert
an imminent danger and the threatened damage, compared to the
damage arising to the owner from the interference, is much greater.
(Art. 432, New Civil Code)

Note: The doctor merely acted in accordance with the exercise
of his profession.

Five constabulary soldiers appeared in a house where Easter
was being celebrated. They asked the owner of the house if he had
a license for the entertainment. As the owner of the house was not
able to produce any license, the soldiers broke up the party by force.
Held: The meeting was not illegal. The meeting was peaceful, it
being a mere social gathering. There was no legal ground for dissolving
the same. The soldiers had no authority of law to dissolve it. They
were guilty of coercion. (U.S. v. Ventosa, 6 Phil. 385)
Note: The constabulary soldiers may be punished under Article
131.

Also, a policeman may by means of violence compel a person,
who committed a crime in his presence, to go with him if that person
refused to be arrested and to go with him to the police station, because

There is no grave coercion when the accused acts In good faith In
the performance of his duty.

In a case where the municipal mayor authorized the fencing of a
barbershop which has been recommended for closure by the municipal
health officer for noncompliance with certain health and sanitation
requirements, the Supreme Court held that the mayor incurred no
criminal liability for having acted in good faith in the performance of
his duty as he merely implemented the recommendation of the health
officer. (Timoner v. People, 125 SCRA 830)

799

Art. 286

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Purpose of the law in penalizing coercion.

The main purpose of the statute in penalizing coercion and
unjust vexation is precisely to enforce the principle that no person
may take the law into his hands, and that our government is one of
law, not of men. (People v. Espina, et al., C.A., 56 O.G. 1678, citing
People v. Mangosing, C.A. G.R. No. 1107-R, April 29, 1948)
A person who takes the law into his hands with violence, is guilty
of grave coercion.

Thus, forcibly ejecting an occupant from the land bought by
the offender, without authority from the court, is coercion. (People v.
Nebreja, et al., 76 Phil. 119)
Also, forcibly invading the land claiming to be the owner thereof
and taking the palay and camote harvested therefrom by the occupant,
is coercion. (People v. Mojico, et al., CA., 45 O.G. 1818)

Coercion is consummated even if the offended party did not accede
to the purpose of the coercion.

The appellant claims that the coercion was not consummated
but was frustrated only for the reason that the offended party did
not confess the crime attributed to him. This conclusion is contrary
to the doctrine laid down by this Court in U.S. v. Cusi, 10 Phil. 413,
which says:

“The fact that an individual was maltreated for the purpose
of compelling him to confess a crime which was attributed to
him, constitutes the crime of consummated coercion, even if the
agents of the authorities who carried out the maltreatment did
not accomplish their purpose to draw from him a confession,
which it was their intention to obtain by the employment of
such means.”
This doctrine was reiterated in the case of U.S. v. Pabalan, 37
Phil. 352, where it did not appear that the offended party acceded to
the purpose of the coercion. (Punzalan v. People, 99 Phil. 259)

TITLE NINE
Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Art. 286

Coercion distinguished from illegal detention.
When the offended party, who was in the house of the accused
for three days as servant therein, had the freedom of the house and
left it at times to visit her mother, but it was shown that she was
compelled against her will to leave her mother’s house and go with the
accused to the latter’s house, there is coercion, not illegal detention.
(U.S. v. Quevengco, 2 Phil. 412)
Grave coercion distinguished from frustrated illegal detention.

The essential element of the crime of illegal detention is that
there be actual confinement or restraint of the person. (U.S. v.
Cabanag, 8 Phil. 64; People u. Suarez, 82 Phil. 484; People v. Chiong
Suy Siong, et al., G.R. No. L-6174, February 28, 1955) Where the
accused, by means of violence, merely dragged and carried the
complainant to a distance of three meters from the place where she
was first grabbed, such acts do not constitute the crime of frustrated
illegal detention but rather that of consummated grave coercion
defined and punishable under Article 286 of the Revised Penal Code.
The cases of People v. Undiana, 50 Phil. 641, and People v.
Crisostomo, 46 Phil. 775, are not applicable. In said cases, the
victims were rescued by other persons from the accused; while in
the instant case the appellants, after having carried the woman
to a distance of only three meters and dropped her because of her
struggles, did not persist in dragging her away and voluntarily
desisted from furthering their purpose and left without anybody
pursuing them when during all the time they were in a position
to carry out whatever intent they originally entertained, for there
was no person present who could have stopped them. (People v.
Marasigan, et al., C.A., 55 O.G. 8297)

Note: In the Undiana case, the victim was dragged by the
defendants to a distance of 40 meters from her house. As the charge
was frustrated abduction, but lewd designs were not proved, the
Supreme Court held that the defendants could be convicted only of
frustrated illegal detention.

In the Crisostomo case, the victim was dragged along and was
taken against her will to a rice field, where she was rescued. The
defendants were held liable for consummated illegal detention.

Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Coercion is distinguished from illegal detention, when there is no
clear deprivation of liberty, by the purpose of the offender.

the assistance of a third person, placed her in a public carromata. She
was arrested, because her servants had placed two step ladders in
the street for the purpose of cleaning the side of her house, which did
not constitute a violation of the ordinance relating to the obstruction
of streets. It was held that such acts constitute the crime of grave
coercion. (U.S. v. Alexander, 8 Phil. 29)
When there is prevention of the meeting of a legislative body or
provincial board or city or municipal council or board, the offenders
are not liable for grave coercion through arbitrary detention, even if
there is compulsion and detention.

Art. 286

People v. Dauatan, et al.
(CA., 35 O.G. 450)

Facts: A and B were about to be married. B, the woman, became
disgusted with A and stated that she would desist from proceeding with the
marriage agreed upon. One night, A, with others, carried her away forcibly
from her house to his own, where she was kept not behind closed doors but
only watched so she might not escape, the sole purpose of A being to compel
her to proceed with the concerted marriage.
Held: A and his companions did not commit the offense of illegal
detention, but that of grave coercion.

When the purpose is to prevent the inmates from leaving the
premises.

Where the accused constructed a fence around the house of the
offended party, as high as a man’s shoulder and without opening, and
watched the house and warned the inmates not to leave the premises
under threat of death, it was held that the crime was grave coercion,
and not illegal detention. (People v. Peralta, et al., 35 O.G. 1929)
Coercion, distinguished from mattreatment of prisoner.

In extorting a confession or in obtaining an information from
the prisoner by means of violence (Art. 235), the act is similar to that
of grave coercion; but the difference lies in the fact that in the crime
of maltreatment of prisoners, the offended party is a prisoner. If the
offended party is not a prisoner, the offense would be grave coercion.
Thus, the policemen who, having suspected that M was one of
the thieves, went to his house, dragged him out of the house, and hit
him with a rifle and a bolo to compel M to confess his guilt, are guilty
of coercion. (U.S. v. Cusi, et al., 10 Phil. 413)
Note: In this case of U.S. v. Cusi, et al., M, the suspect, was not

Art. 286

Thus, the arrest of the vice-president who was presiding over
the meeting of the municipal council, preceded by firing a shot in the
air by the municipal president as the latter was ordering his arrest,
and the detention of the vice-president in jail until 2:00 a.m. when
he was released by the governor, do not constitute a complex crime
of grave coercion through arbitrary detention, but simply a violation
of Article 143. (People v. Alipit, et al., 44 Phil. 910)
When prision mayor shall be imposed.

1.

If the coercion is committed in violation of the exercise of the
right of suffrage;

2.

If the coercion is committed to compel another to perform any
religious act;

3.

If the coercion is committed to prevent another from performing
any religious act.

In violation of the exercise of the right of suffrage.
Example: A is running against B for mayor in a certain
municipality. C, A’s bodyguard, learns that the residents of barangay

barangay D not to vote during the elections with the threat that the
houses of those who shall vote shall be burned.

The second paragraph of Article 286 prevents and punishes
religious intolerance.
An essential element of the crime punished under the second
paragraph of Article 286, is the intent to coercively control the
religious beliefs of another. (U.S. v. Balcorta, 25 Phil. 273)

Grave coercion, distinguished from unlawful arrest

Art. 287

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Thus, where the procession of the Catholics was disbanded by
force by certain followers of the Aglipayan Church, acting in the belief
that the Aglipayan faith should be the only one to predominate in the
locality, it was held that the accused were guilty of grave coercion
( U.S. v. Morales, et al., 37 Phil. 364) under the second paragraph of
Article 286.

—

Art. 287. Light coercions. Any person who, by means of
violence, shall seize anything belonging to his debtor for the
purpose of applying the same to the payment of the debt, shall
suffer the penalty of arresto mayor in its minimum period15
and a fine equivalent to the value of the thing, but in no case
less than Fifteen thousand pesos (P15.000).
Any other coercion or unjust vexation shall be punished
by arresto menor or a fine ranging from One thousand pesos
(Pl,000) to not more than Forty thousand pesos (P40.000), or
both. (As amended by RA. No. 10951)

Elements:
1.

That the offender must be a creditor.

2.

That he seizes anything belonging to his debtor.

3.

That the seizure of the thing be accomplished by means of
violence or a display of material force producing intimidation.

4.

That the purpose of the offender is to apply the same to the
payment of the debt.

Illustration:
The accused demanded payment from a Chinaman of the
latter’s debt, but he had no money with which to pay him. With his
cargadores, the accused took from the store of the Chinaman all the
goods which the latter had. The accused ignored the opposition of
the Chinaman who could not do anything because the accused had a
revolver. The goods were forcibly taken away by the accused. (U.S.
v. Tupular, 7 Phil. 8)

TITLE NINE
Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Paragraph 1 of Article 287 is limited to a case where the offender
seized anything belonging to his debtor by means of violence to apply

the same to the payment of the debt.
Thus, if the offender seized anything belonging to his debtor by
means of violence to hold it merely as security for the payment of the
debt, Article 287, paragraph 1, is not applicable.
The offender must be a creditor of the offended party.
Thus, when it is evident that the accused did not act as a creditor
toward the offended party, when he seized a cow jointly owned by
them, but his conduct was that of a co-owner who wished to exercise
the right of redemption with which unquestionably he was civilly
vested, the accused is not guilty of light coercion. (U.S. v. Caballero,
25 Phil. 357)

Taking possession of the thing belonging to the debtor, through
deceit and misrepresentation, for the purpose of applying the same
to the payment of the debt, is unjust vexation under the second
paragraph of Article 287.

Thus, if it was alleged in the information that the accused,
through deceit and misrepresentation, willfully seized and took
possession of a passenger jeep of the offended party, for the purpose
of applying said jeep to the payment of the debt of the offended party,
the coercion alleged would fall under the second paragraph of Article
287 (People v. Reyes, 98 Phil. 646), because there was no violence
employed in seizing the jeep.

Actual physical violence need not be employed.
It is sufficient that the attitude of the offender in seizing the
property of his debtor is notoriously menacing as to amount to a
grave intimidation, or create such a situation that necessarily would
intimidate the victim. (People v. Lacdan, CA., 51 O.G. 2441)
Unjust vexation

— other light coercion (Art 287, par. 2).

Unjust vexation includes any human conduct which, although
not productive of some physical or material harm would, however,
unjustly annoy or vex an innocent person. (Guevara)

'‘See Appendix “A,” Table of Penalties, No. 2.
804

Art. 287

805

Art. 287

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The paramount question to be considered, in determining
whether the crime of unjust vexation is committed, is whether the
offender’s act caused annoyance, irritation, vexation, torment, distress,
or disturbance to the mind of the person to whom it is directed. (People
v. Gozum, CA., 54 O.G. 7409)
Kissing a girl, without performing acts of lasciviousness, is unjust

vexation.

A man who kissed a girl and held her tightly to his breast is
guilty of unjust vexation. (People v. Climaco, CA., 46 O.G. 3186)

But the conduct of the accused should not be lascivious, for
otherwise he is liable for acts of lasciviousness under Article 336.
(People v. Anonuevo, CA., 36 O.G. 2018)

TITLE NINE

Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Art. 287

When the act of the accused has no connection with his previous
acts of violence, it is only unjust vexation.
The accused was taking a sack of palay belonging to the offended

party upon instruction of a lieutenant commandeering palay. The

offended party pulled it back. A fight between them ensued. The two
were taken to the lieutenant, while the sack of palay was left in the
place where they fought. Later, the accused went back to the place
and took the sack of palay.
Held: The taking of the palay constitutes an independent and

separate act that cannot be linked with the previous acts of violence
of the accused. The offended party was not coerced to turn over to
him the sack of palay at the time it was taken. At most, the offense
was uryust vexation with respect to the taking of the sack of palay.
(People v. Picunada, CA., 43 O.G. 2222)

There Is no violence or intimidation in unjust vexation.

Light coercion under the first paragraph will be unjust vexation
if the third element (employing violence or intimidation) is absent.
The act of the accused in nailing some wooden barricades on
one of the sides of the market stall of the offended party for failure or
refusal of the latter to pay increased rentals and in warning the latter
thus: “[The Court] ha[s] closed this portion of the door. Do not open
it or else something may happen to you,” as claimed by the offended
party, does not constitute such a serious threat or intimidation
amounting to grave coercion, but merely the crime of unjust vexation
penalized under paragraph 2 of Article 287 of the Revised Penal Code.
(People v. Banzon, et al., CA., 66 O.G. 10533)
Grave coercion distinguished from unjust vexation.

Where the first and the third elements of the crime of grave
coercion under paragraph 1 of Article 286 are present, but the second
element thereof, which is the use of violence upon the offended party
in preventing or compelling him to do something against his will, is
lacking, the crime committed by the accused falls under the second
paragraph of Article 287. (People v. Sebastian, et al., CA., 40 O.G.

2498)

Anti-Sexual Harassment Act of 1995
Rep. Act No. 7877

Sexual Harassment, Defined.
Work, education or training-related sexual harassment is
committed by an employer, employee, manager, supervisor, agent
of the employer, teacher, instructor, professor, coach, trainer, or any
other person who, having authority, influence or moral ascendancy
over another in a work or training or education environment,
demands, requests or otherwise requires any sexual favor from the
other, regardless of whether the demand, request or requirement for
submission is accepted by the object of said act.

Sexual harassment In a work-related or employment environment
In a work-related or employment environment, sexual harass¬
ment is committed when:

The sexual favor is made as a condition in
(a) the hiring or in the employment, re-employment or
continued employment of said individual, or

Art. 287

(b)

granting said individual favorable compensation,
terms, conditions, promotions, or privileges; or

The refusal to grant the sexual favor results
in limiting, segregating or classifying the employee
which in any way would discriminate, deprive or
diminish employment opportunities or otherwise
adversely affect said employee;
(2)

The above acts would impair the employee’s rights or
privileges under existing labor laws; or

(3)

The above acts would result in an intimidating, hostile, or
offensive environment for the employee. (Sec. 3{a])

Sexual harassment in an education or training environment

In an education or training environment, sexual harassment
is committed:
(1)

Against one who is under the care, custody or supervision
of the offender,

(2)

Against one whose education, training, apprenticeship or
tutorship is entrusted to the offender;

(3)

When the sexual favor is made a condition to the giving of a
passing grade, or the granting of honors and scholarships,
or the payment of a stipend, allowance or other benefits,
privileges, or considerations; or

(4)

When the sexual advances result in an intimidating,
hostile or offensive environment for the student, trainee

Illustration of sexual harassment in an employment environment
Narvasa v. Sanchez
(G.R. No. 169449, March 26, 2010)

Facts: Three cases of sexual harassment were filed separately by
three employees of the Municipality of Diadi, Nueva Ecija (LGU) against
respondent-municipal assessor.
The first was filed by de la Cruz who claimed that respondent handed
her a note saying, “Gay, I like you”, which respondent later tore into pieces
when de la Cruz, feeling offended, admonished him and told him that she
would give the note to his wife. This was followed by another message in which
he said, ‘Ka date ko si Mary Gay. . . ang tamis ng halik mo.* The second was
filed by Gayaton who received several text messages from respondent, with
messages such as ‘Pauwi ka na ba sexy?*, “I like you”; “Have a date with
me”; “Don't tell to (sic) others that I told that I like you because nakakahiya";
“Puso mo to pag bigay moto sakin, I would be very happy” and “I slept and
dreamt nice things about you.” The third complaint was filed by Narvasa
who asserted that during a field trip, respondent pulled her towards him and
attempted to kiss her. Narvasa resisted and was able to escape the clutches
of respondent to rejoin the group that they were travelling with. Respondent
apologized to Narvasa thrice regarding that incident.

LGU’s Committee on Decorum and Investigation found respondent
guilty of all three charges. For the offenses committed against de la Cruz
and Gayaton, respondent was meted the penalties of reprimand for his first
offense of light harassment and 30 days’ suspension for his first offense
of less grave sexual harassment. His transgression against Narvasa was
deemed to be grave sexual harassment for which he was dismissed from
government service.

Any person who violates the provisions of this Act shall, upon
conviction, be penalized by imprisonment of not less than one month

Held: Respondent’s acts of grabbing Narvasa and attempting to kiss
her were, no doubt, intentional. Worse, the incident occurred months after
he had made similar but subtler overtures to de la Cruz, who made it clear
that his sexual advances were not welcome. Considering that the acts
respondent committed against Narvasa were much more aggressive, it was
impossible that the offensive nature of his actions could have escaped him.
It does not appear that they were carrying on an amorous relationship that
might have justified his attempt to kiss Narvasa while they were separated
from their companions. Worse, as they were both married (to other persons),
respondent not only took his marital status lightly, he also ignored Narvasa’s

809

Any person who directs or induces another to commit any act
of sexual harassment as herein defined, or who cooperates in the
commission thereof by another without which it would not have been
committed, shall also be held liable under this Act. (Sec. 3)

Penalties.

Criminal Law

married state, and good character and reputation. This is the third time
that respondent is being penalized for acts of sexual harassment. We are
also alarmed by the increasing boldness in the way respondent displayed his
unwelcome affection for the women of his fancy. He is a perverted predator
preying on his female colleagues and subordinates. Respondent’s continued
misbehavior cannot, therefore, be allowed to go unchecked. Respondent is
ordered DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of retirement benefits
except accrued leave credits, if any, and with prejudice to re-employment in
any branch or instrumentality of the government, including governmentowned and controlled corporations. This is without prejudice to any criminal
complaints that may be filed against him.

Peaceful picketing is part of freedom of speech and, therefore,

from the employer’s premises for lawful purposes, or obstruct public
thoroughfares. (Art. 279[e], Labor Code)
The acts of the picketers in stopping a truck emerging from
the company’s premises, their refusal to allow its driver to proceed
peacefully on his way, their voiced threat that if he would go on his
way he would be hurt; all these, notwithstanding the fact that the
truck did not belong to the company but to a private individual, are
clearly constitutive of the crime of coercion. (People v. Carballo, et
al., CA., 53 O.G. 5232, citing 31 Am. Jur. 925-926)

The picketers’ act of remaining in the passageway when the
trucks of the company were going inside its premises is not a part
of the picketing protected by law. (People v. Calip, et al., 3 CA.

The right to picket should be confined strictly and in good faith
to gaining information and to peaceful persuasion and argument.

Art. 290

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Elements:

TITLE NINE
Crimes Against Personal Liberty and Security

Art. 290

The offender must be informed of contents of papers or letters.

1.

That the offender is a private individual or even a public officer
not in the exercise of his official function.

2.

That he seizes the papers or letters of another.

3.

That the purpose is to discover the secrets of such another
person.

4.

That offender is informed of the contents of the papers or
letters seized. (People v. Singh, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 5, 35)

Meaning of the word "seize.”

The word “seize” means “to place in the control of someone a
thing or to give him the possession thereof and accordingly, it is not
necessary that in the act, there should be force or violence.

But stating it correctly, there must be taking possession of
papers or letters of another, even for a short time only. Thus, if the
accused accepted from a messenger of the RCA a radiogram addressed
to another person, he did not seize the radiogram, because it was
voluntarily delivered to him. (People v. Singh, CA., 40 O.G., Supp.
5,35)

The purpose of the offender must be to discover the secrets of
another.
People v. Otto, Jr.
(CA., 50 O.G. 3127)

Facts: When the accused entered his office, he found cablegrams and
letters in closed envelopes piled upside down on his table, among which

was a cablegram to the Amalgamated Minerals, Inc. referring to certain
transmitted money from the United States, which he opened by mistake.
He then instructed his secretary to call RCA and have it redelivered to the
proper party. Later, when the Amalgamated Minerals, Inc. wanted to collect
the money transmitted, it was already garnished in the case, which had been
filed by the accused against the Amalgamated Minerals, Inc.
Held: Before opening a closed paper, the accused must be dictated by
the desire to discover secrets. Since the accused opened the cablegram by
mistake, he could not have possibly seized it for the purpose of discovering
a secret. He is not liable under Article 290.

816

People v. Singh
(CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 5, 35)

Facts: The accused received from the messenger of the Radio
Corporation of America a telegram addressed to another watchman in the
San Miguel Brewery and accepted the trust to deliver to him said dispatch.
The telegram was not delivered to the addressee, because as claimed by the
accused, he kept it inside one of the pockets of his coat which was later sent
to the laundry and the telegram disappeared.
Held: The crime defined in Article 290 requires that the act of seizure
be impelled by a desire to discover the secrets of another and that the accused
is informed of the contents of papers or letters.

Prejudice is not an element of the offense.

This article does not require that the offended party be
prejudiced.
Circumstance qualifying the offense.

When the offender reveals the contents of such paper or
letters of another to a third person, the penalty is higher. (Art. 290,
par. 2)
Hence, revealing the secrets is not an element of the offense.
Article 290 is not applicable to letters of minors or spouses.
This article is not applicable to parents, guardians, or persons
entrusted with the custody of minors with respect to papers or letters
of the children or minors placed under their care or custody, or to
spouses with respect to the papers or letters of either of them. (Art.
290, par. 3)

Distinguished from public officer revealing secrets of private
individual.

In Article 290, the offender who is a private individual seizes the
papers or letters of another to discover the secrets of the latter. It is
not necessary that there be a secret and, if there is a secret discovered,
it is not necessary that it be revealed.
Section 2756 of the Administrative Code punishes the unlawful
opening of mail matter.

Any person, who is not an officer or employee of the Bureau of
Posts, who shall unlawfully open any mail matter which has been in

The
penalty of arresto mayor3 and a fine not exceeding One
hundred thousand pesos (P100.000) shall be imposed upon any
manager, employee, or servant who, in such capacity, shall
learn the secrets of his principal or master and shall reveal
such secrets. (As amended by RA. No. 10951)

Elements:
1.

That the offender is a manager, employee or servant.

2.

That he learns the secrets of his principal or master in such
capacity.

3.

That he reveals such secrets.

Secrets must be learned by reason of their employment

The secrets must have come to their knowledge by reason of

Elements:
1.

That the offender is a person in charge, employee or workman
of a manufacturing or industrial establishment.

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The act constituting the crime is revealing the secret of the industry
of employer.

Thus, if the person in charge, employee or workman of a
manufacturing or industrial establishment used the secret of the
industry for his own benefit, without revealing it to others, he is not
liable under this article.
The revelation of the secret might be made after the employee or
workman had ceased to be connected with the establishment

Article 292 does not state the time of the revelation of the
industrial secrets. Therefore, the employee or workman who revealed
the secrets of the industry of his employer, after he had been dismissed
or separated from the establishment, may be held liable under this
article.
What is important is that he was an employee or workman of
the manufacturing or industrial establishment when he learned the
secrets.
Prejudice Is an element of the offense.

Prejudice is an essential element in this offense, because Article
292 says “to the prejudice of the owner thereof.”

Art. 293. Who are guilty of robbery. Any person who,
with intent to gain, shall take any personal property belonging
to another, by means of violence against or intimidation of
any person, or using force upon anything, shall be guilty of
robbery.

The property taken must be personal property, for if real
property is occupied or real right is usurped by means of violence
against or intimidation of person, the crime is usurpation. (Art. 312)
Prohibitive articles may be the subject matter of robbery; opium,
for instance.
U.S. v. Sana Lim
(28 Phil. 404)

Facts: While several persons were perfecting the purchase and sale of
several tins of opium, certain police officers, conspiring together with some
Chinese to obtain possession of said opium, came to the scene and by means
of intimidation seized the opium, without causing the prosecution of the
offenders, and thereafter said police officers appropriated the opium.
Held: Robbery was committed.

Art 293

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Belonging to another.

Thus, one who, by means of violence or intimidation, took his
own property from the depositary is not guilty of robbery.

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 293

For lack of conformity between the allegation and the proof respecting
the ownership of the property, the Supreme Court held that it was
impossible to convict the accused of robbery. The accused are each
convicted of four separate homicides.

Since the personal property must belong to another, a co-owner
or a partner cannot commit robbery or theft with regard to the coownership or partnership property.

In robbery, the personal property of another is taken by the
offender against the will of the owner.

Article 293 uses the phrase “belonging to another” which means
that the property taken does not belong to the offender. The person
from whom the personal property is taken need not be the owner.
Possession of the property is sufficient.

Robbery can be committed only by taking personal property of
another against the latter’s will. Where the accused received certain
jewels in trust or for safekeeping from the owner's agent, said accused
cannot be held liable for robbery, because she did not“take" the jewels.
(U.S. v. Alcantara, 6 Phil. 387)

In the commission of the crime of robbery, it is not necessary
that the person from whom the property is taken by means of threats
and violence, shall be the owner thereof. It is sufficient if the property
is taken from him by means of threats and violence, for the purpose
of gain, on the part of the person appropriating it. The possession of
the property is sufficient. Ownership is not necessary. Robbery may
be committed from a bailee or from a person who himself has stolen
it. It has even been held that the taking of clothing from the body of a
dead person constitutes robbery, as the property of the executor. Even
the owner of property may be guilty of robbery when, for instance,
he takes it from the possession of a bailee, with the intent to charge
the bailee with its value. (U.S. u. Albao, 29 Phil. 86)
Does the phrase "belonging to another,” in relation to the property
taken, mean that the naming of the owner is a matter of essential
description of the crime?

Yes. If the crime charged is robbery with homicide in view of the
capital punishment attached to the crime. But when the accused is
prosecuted for robbery with intimidation or violence resulting only
in physical injuries, or for robbery by the use of force upon things,
the name of the real owner is not essential so long as the personal
property taken does not belong to the accused.
In the case of U.S. v. Lahoylahoy, et al., 38 Phil. 330, the
accused were prosecuted for robbery with multiple homicide. While
the information alleged that the property taken belonged to Roman
Estriba, the proof showed that the person robbed was Juana Seran.
824

If A delivered a package containing an article to B by mistake
and, when A asked for the return thereof, B threatened to kill him if
A would get it back, B is not liable for robbery even if he had intent
to gain and employed intimidation, because he did not take the
property from A.
The taking of personal property must be unlawful.

A secret service agent who made search for and seized moneys
in a dwelling house, under lawful orders from his superiors, and
appropriated a part thereof to his own use before turning over the
balance to his superiors is not guilty of robbery.
The unlawful taking of personal property is an essential part
of the crime of robbery, and where the taking was lawful and the
unlawful misappropriation was subsequent to such taking, the crime
is estafa or malversation. (U.S. v. Atienza, 2 Phil. 242)

But in a case where four Chinese, a municipal treasurer, a
police sergeant, and two policemen pretended to purchase opium
from certain Moros, and when the opium was to be delivered, the
municipal officials arrested the carrier of the opium and they, together
with the four Chinese, appropriated the opium, it was held that they
were guilty of robbery. While the seizure of the opium and the arrest
of its carrier by the agents of the authorities were lawful, it was not
lawful for said agents to seize the opium in order to appropriate it.
The fact that the agents of the authorities, apparently acting in
compliance with the law, but really with intent to obtain unlawful

gain, did, with intimidation, seize a forbidden article, constitutes
robbery. As long as the authorities or their agents have not legally
taken charge of the forbidden article, it continues to be private
property, and they have acted, not as agents of the authorities in the
fulfillment of their duties, but merely as private parties. Ownership
of the forbidden article passes to the government only after legal

2. It is undisputed that petitioner demanded and
eventually received from R&R P10O.0O0, a personal property
belong to the latter. The amount was placed inside a brown
envelope and was given to petitioner while inside Max’s
Restaurant in EDSA. It was also proven that P100,000 was
unlawfully taken by the petitioner from R&R, with intent to
gain and through intimidation. Taking is considered complete
from the moment the offender gains possession of the thing,
even if he has no opportunity to dispose of the same. In the
instant case, it was adequately proven that petitioner received
and took possession of the brown envelope containing the
money; she even placed her wallet and handkerchief inside the
envelope. At that point, there was already taking. (Sazon v.
Sandiganbayan, G.R. No. 160873, February 10, 2009)

seizure thereof.
Hence, if the agents of the authorities, in the beginning, lawfully
seized the forbidden article and conceived the idea of misappropriating
it only after it came into their possession, then the crime would be
estafa. (U.S. v. Sana Lim, 28 Phil. 404)

Note: It should be malversation, not estafa.
Unlawful taking, when complete.
1.

3. The element of taking or asportation in the crime
of robbery was completed when appellants took the personal
property, even if they had no subsequent opportunity to
dispose of the same. The offended party had testified that after
the robbery, she made an inventory and found many personal
belongings missing. The later disposition of the property taken,
or the failure to dispose of such property, is without moment so
far as the characterization of the crime as robbery is concerned.
(People v. Apolinario, G.R. No. 97426, June 3, 1993)

As to robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons.

From the moment the offender gains possession of the thing,
even if the culprit has had no opportunity to dispose of the same, the
unlawful taking is complete. The fact that the defendant in his flight
threw away the property stolen or that it fell without his knowledge,
does not affect the nature of the crime.
The crime is consummated when the robber acquires possession
of the property, even if for a short time, and it is not necessary that
the property be taken into the hands of the robber, or that he should
have actually carried the property away, out of the physical presence
of the lawful possessor, or that he should have made his escape with
it. (People v. Quinn, 176 P 2d 404; Woods vs. State, 220 SW 2d 644;
People vs. Beal, 39 P 2d 504; People vs. Clark, 160 P 2d 553)

Illustrations:
1. The element of taking or asportation was completed
when appellant violently got hold of the bag however
momentarily. In robbery, the element of asportation
which
requires the unlawful taking of personal property from the
possession of its owner, without this privity and consent and
without animus revertendi is present once the property is in fact
taken from the owner, even for just an instant. (People v. Gavina, G JiNo. 118076, November 20, 1996)

Art. 293

2.

As to robbery with force upon things.

The rule is that theft or robbery is consummated after the
accused had taken material possession of the thing with intent to
appropriate the same, although his act of making use of the thing was
frustrated. (U.S. vs. Adiao, 38 Phil. 754) Robberies with force upon
things“se consuman en el momenta en que el culpable se apodera de la
cosa teniendola a su disposition aun cuando solo es memontaneamente
No es precise que la cosa llegue a ser aprouechada." (II Cuello Calon,
Derecho Penal, 14th Ed., 1975, pp. 894-5)

Thus, when the accused entered the bodega through an opening
in the roof and were already in possession of two cases of corned beef
but were unable to remove the same from the bodega because the
watchmen discovered the robbery, the robbery was consummated.

Art. 293

Taking as an element of robbery means depriving the offended
party of ownership of the thing taken with the character of

A was the owner of a gun kept in a drawer which was locked. B,
A’s son, destroyed the drawer’s lock and obtained the gun in order to
threaten A with it, as in fact B threatened A with said gun.

Held: B had no intention of depriving A of the ownership of
the gun with any character of permanency, negativing therefore the
essential element of “taking" in the crime of robbery. (People v. Kho

(Art. 282), for threatening the offended party with the said gun,

Animus lucrandi or intent to gain is an internal act which
robbery is circumstantial, intent to gain or animus lucrandi may be
presumed from the furtive taking of useful property pertaining to
another, unless special circumstances reveal a different intent on the
part of the perpetrator. The intent to gain may be presumed from the
proven unlawful taking. The act of taking the victim’s wristwatch by
one of the accused while the other accused poked a knife behind him
sufficiently gave rise to the presumption. (People v. Reyes, G.R. No.

135682, March 26, 2003)

Absence of intent to gain will make the taking of personal
property grave coercion if there is violence used. (Art. 286)
The element of “personal property belonging to another" and that
of “intent to gain" must concur.

1.

If the accused, with intent to gain, took from another, personal
property which turned out to be his own property, the property
not belonging to another, he cannot be held liable for robbery,
even if in taking it, the accused used violence against or
intimidation of person, or force upon anything.

The taking of personal property belonging to another should
not be under claim of ownership. One who takes property openly and
avowedly under claim of title proffered in good faith is not guilty of
robbery even though the claim of ownership is untenable. (U.S. v.
Manluco, et al., 28 Phil. 360)

2.

If he took personal property from another, believing that it
was his own property, but in reality it belonged to the offended
party, there being no intent to gain, he cannot be held liable
for robbery, even if the accused used violence against or

The violence must be against the person of the offended party,
not upon the thing taken.

The intent to gain, being an internal act, cannot be established
by direct evidence, except in case of confession by the accused. It
must, therefore, be deduced from the circumstances surrounding
the commission of the offense. As a general rule, however, the
unlawful taking of personal property belonging to another involves
intent to gain on the part of the offender. (People v. Sia Teb Ban,

Del Rosario v. People

Held: When the marked money was placed inside the drawer of
petitioner who later counted the money, he was deemed to have taken
possession of the money. Petitioner employed intimidation to obtain the
amount of P2,000 from France as the act he performed caused fear in the
mind of France and hindered the free exercise of his will. For France whose
daily living depends on his earnings from driving a taxi, the thought of not
having his driver’s license back and the possibility that he might not be
able to drive a taxi and eam a living for his family prompted him to give the
amount demanded. Petitioner succeeded in forcing France to choose between
parting with his money or have his driver’s license confiscated or cancelled.

Facts: Charlotte and Kim boarded a jeepney going to G-Mall. After
boarding the jeepney, two male persons, who were later identified to be
Roxan and Edwin, also boarded the vehicle. While on board the jeepney,
Charlotte and Kim heard Roxan and Edwin talking about who will pay the
fare. When the jeepney stopped at a red light, Kim saw Edwin giving the
signal to Roxan and heard him say “tirahi na nang babaye bai" Thereafter,
Roxan snatched the necklace of Charlotte, disembarked from the jeepney,
and ran away. Edwin also disembarked.
Held: The crime committed is theft as the snatching of the necklace
was without violence against or intimidation of persons or with force upon
things. In the case of People v. Concepcion, 691 Phil. 542 (2012), the Court
ruled that when the complainant herself merely testified that the offender
snatched her shoulder bag, without saying that such offender used violence,
intimidation or force in snatching her shoulder bag, the snatching of the
shoulder bag constitutes the crime of theft, not robbery.

Intimidation need not be threat of bodily harm.
The intimidation exists when it causes the fear or fright of the victim.
Thus, a threat of arrest and prosecution, pointing a gun or a knife to the
victim, and the like are forms of intimidation.

Flores v. People
(G.R. No. 222861, April 23, 2018)

Facts: Private complainant France figured in a vehicular collision with
a passenger jeepney. At the police station, appellant investigated the incident
and told France to return to the station after two days and prepare the amount
of P2,000 so he can get back his driver’s license. Because France could not
raise the amount in two days, he was told by appellant to just return on the
third day and issued a Traffic Violation Receipt to serve as France’s temporary
driver’s license. France became suspicious as on previous occasions when
his driver’s license was confiscated, he claimed the same from the office of
the MMDA or City Hall and not from the officer who confiscated his license.
France then filed a complaint with the PAOCTF against appellant, provided
the amount of P2.000, and four 500-peso bills were dusted with ultraviolet
fluorescent powder. When France entered the station with members of the
PAOCTF, Appellant asked him if he brought the money with him. Appellant
then called France to his table, opened a drawer and told him to drop the
money inside. Appellant then counted the money inside the drawer. Appellant
was arrested and charged with simple robbery.
830

Art. 293

The violence or intimidation must be present before the taking of
personal property is complete.

If there is violence or intimidation at any time before asportation
is complete, the taking of personal property is qualified to robbery. It
is not necessary that violence or intimidation should be present from
the very beginning.

Navarra and Adoro were walking when suddenly a man
positioned himself between them and poked a pointed object at the
waist of Navarra. The man ordered Navarra not to move; otherwise,
she would get hurt. The man immediately grabbed the bracelet
from Navarra’s wrist and slowly ran away as if nothing happened.
The jewelry was a 22-karat gold bracelet with eight dangling fruits
and was worth P8.875.00. It was held that robbery was committed.
(Eduarte v. People, G.R. No, 176566, April 16, 2009)
But if A picked the pocket of B and ran away with the latter’s
wallet, containing money bills, and when B chased and overtook him,
A turned around and boxed the face of B, inflicting slight physical
iiyuries, or intimidated B with a knife, the crime committed is not
robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons. A committed
two crimes: (1) theft (Art. 308); and (2) slight physical injuries (Art.
266), or grave threats (Art. 282, par. 2) for intimidating B with a knife.
Exception:

But when the violence results in: (1) homicide; (2) rape; (3) inten¬
tional mutilation; or (4) any of the serious physical injuries penalized in
paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 263, the taking of personal property is
robbery complexed with any of those crimes under Article 294, even
if the taking was already complete when the violence was used by the

offender.

831

Art. 293

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

In defining the special complex crimes penalized in paragraphs
1, 2, and 3 of Article 294, the phrase“by reason” or“accompanied by”
is used, which indicates that even if the violence resulting in homicide,
rape, intentional mutilation, or serious physical injuries is used by the
offender after the taking of personal property belonging to another,
the crime is still robbery complexed with any of those crimes.

Although the killing of Evaristo Tuvera by the robbers was
perpetrated after the consummation of the robbery and after the
robbers had left the victim’s house, the homicide is still integrated
with the robbery or is regarded as having been committed “by reason
or on the occasion” thereof. (People v. Barut, 89 SCRA 14)

Note: Evaristo Tuvera was one of those who constituted
themselves as rescue party and repaired to the vicinity of the house
of Francisco Lazaro, the victim of the robbery.
But the taking of personal property need not be immediately after
the intimidation.

After handing over P4,000 to kidnappers for the release of his son
and while reporting the kidnapping to the Anti-Illegal Drugs Special
Operations Task Force (AIDSOTF), Alfonso received a call from
accused-appellant Avancena demanding the payment of the balance
of P150.000, which Alfonso was able to haggle down to P40,000.
Because of the continued demands for payment, the National Anti¬
Kidnapping Task Force (NAKTAF) had the opportunity to set up an
entrapment operation and prepared P6,000 of marked money. During
the entrapment operation where accused-appellants arrived in a
white REVO, Avancena approached Alfonso and received the marked
money from him. When they drove away, NAKTAF agents followed
accused-appellants and were able to apprehend them. NAKTAF was
able to recover the marked money from them.
Held: The accused is guilty of robbery by means of intimidation.
(People v. Avancena, G.R. No. 200512, June 7, 2017)
“Using force upon anything.”

Robbery is also committed by using force upon anything in taking
personal property belonging to another with

intent to gain.
Complainant rented the premises where she operated her Ricein-a-Box store. On April 6, 2002, the accused smashed and destroyed

the padlock of the store using a lead pipe which likewise caused the
door to be broken, entered the store through the broken door, and
took various items valued at P42,000. Accused is guilty of robbery
with use of force upon things. (Marquez v. People, G.R. No. 181138,
December 3, 2012)

But the use of force upon things will not make the taking of
personal property robbery, if the culprit never entered a house or
building. Thus, removing by force the tires of an automobile while
parked on the street and taking them away is not robbery, because
the culprit did not use force to enter a house or building.
Breaking the glass of the show-window of a bazaar and thereafter
taking 40 watches of various makes valued at P627.50, is not robbery,
it appearing that the accused did not enter the building but merely
introduced his hand through the broken glass in order to remove the
watches from the show-window. (People v. Adorno, CA., 40 O.G. 567)
Entrance into the building must be effected by any of the means
described in Articles 299 and 302.
But such entrance into the building is not necessary when the
robbery is committed by breaking wardrobes, chests, or any other
kind of locked or sealed furniture or receptacle inside an inhabited
house, a public building or an edifice devoted to religious worship,
or by taking such furniture or objects away to be broken or forced
open outside (subdivision [b] of Art. 299) or when the robbery in an
uninhabited building, other than a public building or edifice devoted
to religious worship, is committed by breaking any wardrobe, chest,
or any sealed or closed furniture or receptacle, or by removing a closed
or sealed receptacle even if the same be broken open elsewhere, (pars.
4 and 5 of Art. 302)

Distinctions between effects of employment of violence against or
intimidation of person and those of use of force upon things.
(1)

Whenever violence against or intimidation of any person is
used, the taking of personal property belonging to another is
always robbery. If there is no violence or intimidation, but only
force upon things, the taking is robbery only if the force is used
either to enter the building or to break doors, wardrobes, chests,
or any other kind of locked or sealed furniture or receptacle
inside the building or to force them open outside after taking
the same from the building. (Arts. 299 and 302)

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

In robbery with violence against or intimidation of any person,
the value of the personal property taken is immaterial. (U.S.
v. Granadoso, et al., 16 Phil. 419; People v. Daos, et al., 60
Phil. 143) The penalty depends (a) on the result of the violence
used, as when homicide, rape, intentional mutilation or any of
the serious physical injuries resulted, or when less serious or
slight physical injuries were inflicted, which are only evidence
of simple violence, and (b) on the existence of intimidation only.
But in robbery with force upon things, committed in an
inhabited house, public building, or edifice devoted to religious
worship, the penalty is based (a) on the value of the property
taken and (b) on whether or not the offenders carry arms; and
in robbery with force upon things, committed in an uninhabited
building, the penalty is based only on the value of the property
taken.

When the elements of both robbery with violence against or
intimidation of person and robbery with use of force upon things
are present, the penalty is that imposed for robbery with violence
or intimidation in its maximum period.

The complex crime of robbery in an inhabited house by armed
persons and robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons
was committed when the accused, who held firearms, entered the
residential house of the victims and inflicted injury upon the victims
in the process of committing the robbery. Hence, the penalty is that
imposed for the robbery in an inhabited house, the more serious crime.
(Fransdilla v. People, G.R. No. 197562, April
20, 2015)
Napolis v. Court of Appeals, L-28865, February 28, 1972,

violence

should be imposed because the violence against or

on the theory that “robbery

is evidently graver than ordinary robbery committed by force upon
things, because where violence or intimidation against the person

present there is greater disturbance of the order of society and the
security of the individual.”
It held that: One who, by breaking a wall, enters, with a deadly
weapon, an inhabited house and steals therefrom valuable effects,
without violence against or intimidation upon persons, is punishable
under Article 299 of the Revised Penal Code with reclusion temporal.
If, aside from performing said acts, the thief lays hand upon any
person, without committing any of the crimes or inflicting any of the
injuries mentioned in subparagraphs (1) to (4) of Article 294 of the
same Code, the imposable penalty under paragraph (5) thereof
shall be much lighter. This result and the process of reasoning that
has brought it about, defy logic and reason.

—

Robbery with “violence or intimidation against the person
evidently graver than ordinary robbery committed by force upon
things,” but, precisely, for this reason, we cannot accept the conclusion
deduced reduction of the penalty for the latter offense owing to the
concurrence of violence or intimidation which made it a more serious
one. It is more plausible to believe that Article 294 applies only where
robbery with violence against or intimidation of person takes place
without entering an inhabited house, under the conditions set forth
in Article 299 of the Revised Penal Code.

—

When the elements of both robbery with violence against or
intimidation of person and robbery with use of force upon things are
present, then the crime is a complex one, calling for the imposition
as provided in Article 48 of said Code of the penalty for the most
serious offense, in its maximum period, which is reclusion temporal
in its maximum period.

There is no arguing that the Anti-Carnapping Law is a special

consent, or by means of violence against or intimidation of persons,
or by using force upon things. But a careful comparison of this special
law with the crimes of robbery and theft readily reveals their common
features and characteristics, to wit: unlawful taking, intent to gain,
and that personal property belonging to another is taken without
the latter’s consent. However, the Anti-Carnapping Law particularly
deals with the theft and robbery of motor vehicles. Hence a motor
vehicle is said to have been carnapped when it has been taken, with
intent to gain, without the owner’s consent, whether the taking was
done with or without the use of force upon things. Without the AntiCamapping Law, such unlawful taking of a motor vehicle would fall
within the purview of either theft or robbery which was certainly
the case before the enactment of said statute. (People v. Lobitania,

Camapping is a non-ballable offense.

Motor vehicle refers to any vehicle propelled by any power other

trolley cars, street sweepers, sprinklers, lawn mowers, bulldozers,
graders, forklifts, amphibian trucks, and cranes if not used on
public highways; vehicles which run only on rails or tracks; and
tractors, trailers and traction engines of all kinds used exclusively
for agricultural purposes. Trailers having any number of wheels,
when propelled or intended to be propelled by attachment to a motor
vehicle, shall be classified as a separate motor vehicle with no power
rating. (Sec. 2(a], R.A. No. 10883)

Any person charged with carnapping or when the crime of
carnapping is committed by criminal groups, gangs or syndicates or

Qualified Camapping.

To prove the special complex crime of camapping with homicide,
there must be proof not only of the essential elements of camapping,
but also that it was the original criminal design of the culprit and
the killing was perpetrated in the course of the commission of the
camapping or on the occasion thereof. (People v. Macaranas, GJl. No.
226846, June 21, 2017) The killing (or the rape) merely qualifies the
crime of camapping which for lack of specific nomenclature may be
known as qualified carnapping or carnapping in an aggravated form.

In short, considering the phraseology of the amended Section 14, the

concerned. If attempted or frustrated murder or homicide is committed
“in the course of the commission of the camapping or on the occasion
thereof,” then it must be deemed to fall under the clause (of Section
14) “when the carnapping is committed by means of violence against

importantly, it must show that the original criminal design of the
culprit was camapping and that the killing was perpetrated “in the

Needless to say, where the elements of camapping are not proved, the
provisions of the Anti-Camapping Act would cease to be applicable
and the homicide or murder (if proven) would be punishable under the

Appellant had a sufficient motive to bum the car because his

This clarifies the intention of the law to make the offense a
special complex crime, in the same way that robbery with violence
against or intimidation of persons is treated under paragraphs 1 to 4 of
Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code (R.P.C.). Hence, the prosecution
must prove not only that the essential requisites of carnapping were
present; but also that it was the original criminal design of the
culprit, and that the killing was perpetrated “in the course of the
commission of the camapping x x x.” (People v. Latayada, G.R. No.

Appellant had no intention of acquiring the car for himself or of
subjecting it to his control and dominion or of disposing of it for gain
or profit. Instead, Solis took it with the apparent intent of damaging
or destroying it as shown by the fact that after running away with
the vehicle, he immediately set it afire.

The tricycle was unlawfully taken by the two accused from its
owner and the latter was killed on the occasion thereof. The victim
was last seen with the two accused; three hours later, the two were

The antecedent occurrence which preceded the actual taking
away of the car as above stated, points out the motive for the act. It
is, therefore, clear that the accused never meant to appropriate it for
himself nor to derive any profit, pleasure or benefit from it. The act of
the accused in moving the car to a certain distance undoubtedly was
for no other purpose than to prevent or delay immediate discovery
of the act to be done by him, thus avoiding his being identified while
he was near the place where the crime was committed and likewise
prevent immediate assistance being rendered by the authorities.

The crime defined in this article is a special complex crime.

Article 48, defining complex crime, does not apply to the crimes
covered by Article 294. The latter Article already provides a specific
penalty for each kind of robbery with violence against persons in
the first, second, third and fourth paragraphs thereof. There is only
one penalty prescribed, even if two crimes are committed. Article 48
applies only when a complex crime is not punished with a specific
penalty.
“On the occasion” or “by reason” of the robbery.

Note the phrases“on the occasion” and “by reason” of the robbery.
These phrases mean that the homicide or serious physical injuries
defined in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 263 must be committed in
the course or because of the robbery.
The phrase “by reason” covers homicide committed before or after
the taking of personal property of another, as long as the motive of
the offender in killing a person before the robbery is to deprive the
victim of his personal property which is sought to be accomplished
by eliminating an obstacle or opposition or in killing a person after
the robbery to do away with a witness or to defend the possession of
the stolen property. Thus, it matters not that the victim was killed
prior to the taking of the personal properties of the victim. What is
essential in robbery with homicide is that there be a direct relation
and intimate connection between robbery and killing, whether both
crimes be committed at the same time. (People v. Torres G.R. No.

The crime of homicide committed on the occasion of the robbery.
Where the victim was killed on the occasion when the four
accused were taking the chickens under the house of the victim, the
offense is robbery with homicide, not theft and homicide. (People v.
Mabasa, 65 Phil. 568)
Robbery and homicide are separate offenses, when the homicide
was not committed “on the occasion” or “by reason” of the robbery.
In the case of People v. Atanacio, et al., G.R. No. L-11844, the
Supreme Court stated:

The motive for the killing on the part of the Atanacios is not
wanting. The Atanacios had been nursing grudge and hard feelings
against the Villasis family. It appears that on three previous occasions,

the carabao of Perfecto had been foraging or destroying the plantation
of the Atanacios; and that after several promises, he failed to pay the
damages caused. It seems also that the Atanacio family had wanted to
harass the Villasis family who were reputed to be witches, and were
boasting to be the richest family in the barrio. Anent the robbery, it
has been proved that after killing Perfecto, the appellants surrounded
his body and searched his pockets turning them inside out, and cut
off the watch pocket which contained the P100.00.
However, two separate offenses were committed, to wit: murder
qualified by evident premeditation, with no modifying circumstance
to consider, and robbery.
Robbery and homicide as separate crimes.

Homicide is said to have been committed by reason or on the
occasion of robbery if it is committed a) to facilitate the robbery or
the escape of the culprit; b) to preserve the possession by the culprit
of the loot; c) to prevent discovery of the commission of the robbery;
or d) to eliminate witnesses to the commission of the crime. (People v.
Jabiniao, Jr., G.R. No. 179499, April 30, 2008, 553 SCRA 769, 783;
People v. De Jesus, G.R. No. 134815, May 27, 2004, 429 SCRA 403)

Given the circumstances surrounding the instant case, [the
Court] agree[s] with the Court of Appeals that appellants cannot be
convicted of robbery with homicide. Indeed, the killing may occur
before, during, or after the robbery. And it is immaterial that death
would supervene by mere accident, or that the victim of homicide is
other than the victim of robbery, or that two or more persons are killed.

(People v. Jabiniao, Jr., supra at 783; People u. De Jesus, supra at 402)
However, essential for conviction of robbery with homicide is proof
of a direct relation, an intimate connection between the robbery and
the killing, whether the latter be prior or subsequent to the former
or whether both crimes are committed at the same time. (People v.
Werba, G.R. No. 144599, June 9, 2004, 431 SCRA 482, 497; People v.
Cando, 398 Phil. 225, 240 [2000])
From the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, [the Court]
cannot see the connection between the robbery and the homicide. It
must be recalled that after taking the passengers’ personal belongings,
appellants (and two other suspects) alighted from the jeepney. At
that moment, robbery was consummated. Some of the passengers,
however, decided to report the incident to the proper authorities;
hence, they went to the nearest police station. There, they narrated

The rule is that where the original design comprehends robbery
in a dwelling (or elsewhere), and homicide is perpetrated with a view
to the consummation of the robbery, the offense committed is the
special complex crime of robbery with homicide, even though homicide
precedes robbery by an appreciable time. If the original design is not
to commit robbery, but robbery is committed after the homicide as
an afterthought and a minor incident in the homicide, the criminal
acts should be viewed as two distinct offenses. (People v. Toleng, 91
SCRA 382) Robbery with homicide arises only when there is a direct
relation, an intimate connection, between the robbery and the killing,
even if the killing is prior to, concurrent with, or subsequent to the
robbery. (People v. Salazar, supra)

what happened. The police eventually decided to go back to the place
where the robbery took place. Initially, they saw no one; then finally,
Kagalingan saw the suspects on board a pedicab. De Luna and two
other suspects were caught and left under the care of Suing. It was
then that Suing was killed. Clearly, the killing was distinct from
the robbery. There may be a connection between the two crimes, but
surely, there was no “direct connection.”
Though appellants were charged with robbery with homicide,
[the Court] find[s] Quemeggen guilty of robbery, and de Luna of two
separate crimes of robbery and homicide. (People v. Quemeggen, G.R.
No. 178205, July 27, 2009, 594 SCRA 94 [2009])

Where the original design comprehends robbery, and homicide Is
perpetrated by reason or on occasion of the consummation of the
former, the crime committed is robbery with homicide.

In several cases, the Court has already ruled that a conviction
for robbery with homicide requires certitude that the robbery was
the main purpose and objective of the criminals and that the killing
was merely incidental, resulting merely by reason or on the occasion
of the robbery. (People v. Salazar, 277 SCRA 67 [1997])

In the cases of People v. Elizaga, 86 Phil. 364, and People v. Glare,
87 Phil. 739, where the victims were killed, not for the purpose of
committing robbery, and the idea of taking money and other personal
property of the victims was conceived by the culprits only after the
killing, it was held that the culprits committed two separate crimes of
homicide or murder (qualified by abuse of superior strength) and theft.

PARAGRAPH 1: ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE
This is a special complex crime, punished as a single crime,
although robbery and homicide are committed by the offender.
Meaning of “homicide."

The term “homicide" as used in paragraph No. 1 of Article 294,
is to be understood in its generic sense as to include parricide and
murder.
The juridical concept of robbery with homicide does not limit the
taking of life to one single victim or to ordinary homicide.
The juridical concept of robbery with homicide does not limit
the taking of life to one single victim making the slaying of human
beings in excess of that number punishable as separate, independent
offense or offenses. All the homicides or murders are merged in the
composite, integrated whole that is robbery with homicide so long as
all the killings were perpetrated by reason or on the occasion of the
robbery. (People v. Madrid, 88 Phil. 2)

Notwithstanding the fact that three persons were killed and one
seriously injured in the commission of the robbery, the charge should
have been only for robbery with homicide. (People v. Ga, L-49831,

There is no special complex crime of robbery in band with double
homicide and/or serious, less serious or slight physical injuries under
the present Code. If robbery with homicide (or with the other crimes
enumerated above) is committed by a band, the indictable offense
would still be robbery with homicide under Article 294(1), but the
circumstance that it was committed by a band is not an element of
the crime but is merely a generic aggravating circumstance which
may be offset by mitigating circumstances. The homicides or murders
and physical injuries, irrespective of the numbers, committed on the
occasion or by reason of the robbery are merged in the composite crime
of “robbery with homicide.’ (People v. Pedroso, 115 SCRA 599)
There is no such crime as robbery with murder.

Treachery cannot be considered as a qualifying circumstance
of murder, because the crime charged is the special crime of robbery
with homicide. The treachery which attended the commission of the
crime must be considered not qualifying but merely as a generic
aggravating circumstance. (People v. Mantawar, et al., 80 Phil. 817;
People v. Abang, G.R. No. L-14623, December 29, 1960)
Robbery with homicide in a dwelling does not require that robbery
with force upon things is first committed.

Is it necessary that a robbery has actually taken place first, and
the homicide is committed on the occasion or by reason thereof? No.
It is not required.

intent to gain.

homicide.
An intent to take personal property belonging to another with intent
to gain must precede the killing.

In robbery with homicide, the original criminal design of the
malefactor is to commit robbery, with homicide perpetrated on the
occasion or by reason of the robbery. The intent to commit robbery
must precede the taking of human life. The homicide may take place
before, during or after the robbery. It is only the result obtained,
without reference or distinction as to the circumstances, causes or
modes or persons intervening in the commission of the crime that
has to be taken into consideration. There is no such felony of robbery
with homicide through reckless imprudence or simple negligence. The
constitutive elements of the crime, namely, robbery and homicide,
must be consummated. The actions of the three accused, from the
deprivation of the personal belongings of Perlie to the stabbing of
the victim Nely are clear and indubitable proofs of a concerned effort
to deprive Perlie and Nely of their personal belongings, and that by
reason or on the occasion of the said robbery, stabbed and killed the
victim. (People v. Diu, G.R. No. 201449, April 3, 2013)
If the idea of taking the personal property of another with intent
to gain came to the mind of the offender after he had killed the victim,
he is guilty of two separate crimes of homicide or murder, as the case
may be, and theft.
This is the ruling in the cases of People v. Atanacio, et al.; People
v. Elizaga, and People v. Glore, supra.
The crime is robbery with homicide, even if the motive of the
offenders was that of robbery as well as vengeance.
But when the intent to commit robbery preceded the taking of
human life, it is immaterial that the offenders had also a desire to
avenge grievances against the person killed. They are liable for the
special complex crime of robbery with homicide. (U.S. v. Villorente and
Bislig, 30 Phil. 59; People v. Luna, 58 SCRA 198; People v. Damaso,

86 SCRA 370)

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

(b) Homicide, necessary to defend possession of stolen

goods.

Killing first the victim and then afterwards taking the money
from the body of the deceased is robbery with homicide. (People v.
Hernandez, 46 Phil. 48) But the offender must have the intent to take
personal property before the killing.

When the accused were coming out of the store
and were carrying away the stolen goods, the deceased
stopped and attacked them. Two or three of the offenders
returned the attack and killed the deceased.

Killing the victim after taking him out to sea several hours after
the robbery was committed in another place, is still robbery with
homicide. (U.S. v. Ibanez, et al., 19 Phil. 463)

Note: The phrase “by reason’ covers homicide committed before or
after the taking of personal property of another, as long as the motive
of the offender (in killing a person before the robbery) is to deprive the
victim of his personal property which is sought to be accomplished
by eliminating an obstacle or opposition, or (in killing a person after
robbery) to do away with a witness or to defend the possession of the
stolen property.
When homicide is committed by reason or on occasion of robbery.

obstacle to the

One of the accused asked the deceased for money,
threatening to shoot him if he would refuse. The deceased
replied that he had no money and as he turned his back and
started to go home, he was fired upon by two of the accused.
After shooting him down, the accused went to the house of the
deceased, threatened his wife there, took their trunk, broke it
open, and took therefrom P400. As the killing and the robbery
were not committed in the same place, the accused contended
that the crime committed cannot be robbery with homicide.
Held: The accused had the intention of robbing the
deceased when they asked him for money and they shot him
down to eliminate an obstacle to the effectuation of their
unlawful design which was shown by the fact that they repaired
to his house which was nearby, and by force took his money
therefrom. There is direct connection between the killing and
the robbery. (People v. Libre, et al., 93 Phil. 5)
848

Art. 294

Held: Robbery with homicide. The homicide was
committed to defend the possession of the stolen property.
(People v. Salamuddin, 52 Phil. 670)
(c)

Homicide, committed to remove opposition or to
suppress evidence.

When all the four homicides were perpetrated
with the sole end in view of removing opposition to the
robbery or suppressing evidence thereof, it is robbery with
homicide. (People v. Madrid, 88 Phil. 1; People v. Cocoy, et
al., 94 Phil. 91)
(d) Homicide, to escape after the commission of
robbery.

Pacifico Gardon, Catalino Astillero, Amador Altis,
and Antonio Rodrigo were accused of robbery in band
with homicide and serious physical injuries. While the
robbery was going on, the bell of the local chapel began to
ring as if giving a general alarm. Alarmed and fearful of
their safety, the robbers attempted to escape by the back
door but they found it closed. Then the door of the store
was opened and finding a chance to escape, Altis and
Rodrigo hurriedly came out through that door towards
the beach, followed later by their companions Gardon and
Astillero. While Gardon was trying to escape, he met on
the way Engracio Manga and Emilio Fuentes who went to
the store because of the general alarm, and upon seeing
Fuentes, he immediately stabbed him on the abdomen
causing his instantaneous death.
The defense contends that the robbery was
committed independently of the crime of homicide, for
the reason that the plan preconceived by appellants was
merely confined to the commission of robbery and did not
849

Art 294

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

include that of homicide. But this contention evidently is
unsustainable for it cannot be denied that the killing of
Fuentes took place practically in the course, if not as a
necessary consequence, of the commission of the robbery.
Said acts should therefore be considered as constituting
the special crime of robbery with homicide. (People v.
Gordon, et al., CA., 56 O.G. 3404)
Is it robbery with homicide if the person killed is a robber himself?

It would seem that it is still robbery with homicide, if, in the
course of the robbery, another robber is killed by his companion who
wanted to get a lion’s share of the loot. The law does not require that
the person killed is the owner of the property taken. The opening
sentence of Article 294 says: “Any person guilty of robbery with the
use of violence against x x x any person.” Paragraph No. 1 says: ‘when
by reason or on the occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide
shall have been committed.’ The killing of any person by reason or on
the occasion of robbery should be punished with the highest penalty
regardless of the person killed.
The victim of the robbery need not necessarily be the victim of
homicide. (People v. Balanag, G.R No. 103225, September 15, 1994;
People v. Barut, 89 SCRA 16) There is robbery with homicide, even
if the person killed was an innocent bystander and not the person
robbed. (People v. Disimban, 88 Phil. 120; People vs. Barut, supra)
There is robbery with homicide although the items robbed, i.e.,
five shotguns and three guns, Ruby Cal. 22, belong to the armory of
the Provincial Jail of San Fernando, Pampanga, and not the personal
properties of the homicide victims, the provincial jail guards. (People
v. Pamintuan, G.R. No. 100771, May 28, 1993)
It is robbery with homicide even If the death of a person supervened
by mere accident.

In People u. Veloso, No. L-32900, February 25, 1982, 112
SCRA 173, it was held that there was robbery with homicide where
death supervened by mere accident, provided that the homicide
was produced by reason or on the occasion of robbery, inasmuch
as it is only the result obtained, without reference or distinction as
to the circumstances, causes, modes or persons intervening in the
commission of the crime, that has to be taken into consideration.

Art. 294

Attempted homicide or attempted murder committed during or on
the occasion of the robbery is absorbed in the crime of Robbery
with Homicide.
Attempted homicide or attempted murder committed during
or on the occasion of the robbery, as in this case, is absorbed in the
crime of Robbery with Homicide which is a special complex crime
that remains fundamentally the same regardless of the number of
homicides or injuries committed in connection with the robbery.
(People v. Cabbab, Jr., G.R. No. 173479, July 12, 2007, citing People
v. Cabilto, 362 SCRA 325 [2001])

When homicide is not proved, the crime is only robbery.
Thus, if the victim after having been deprived of his personal
property with intimidation while in a banco, was dumped overboard
and thereafter was never heard of or seen, the fact of his death is
not sufficiently established, because he might have survived by
swimming to the bank of the river. In this case, the accused is liable
only for robbery, because there is no sufficient evidence to prove the
homicide.

When robbery Is not proved, the crime Is only homicide.

When the prosecution fails to show that robbery was committed,
because there is no evidence that certain personal property was taken
by the accused, the latter should be convicted of double homicides, if
two persons were killed by the culprits. (People v. Bulan, et al., GJi.
No. L-14934, July 25, 1960)
Outside of the confessions, no sufficient evidence stands to
prove that anything was stolen from the house of the victims. While
there is testimony that victim had money four or five days before the
incident, the hiatus between the reception of the money and the delict
itself was long enough for the deceased to send the money elsewhere.
Without separate proof of corpus delicti, the extrajudicial confessions
will not support conviction for robbery. (Sec. 3, Rule 133, Rules of
Court) Since robbery was not proved, conviction for robbery with
homicide becomes impossible. (People v. Manobo, G.R. No. L-19798,
September 20, 1966)

861

Art. 294

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

In robbery with homicide, must the person charged as accessory
have knowledge of the commission, not only of robbery, but also
of homicide?

In People v. Doble, 114 SCRA 131, it was held that where the
accomplices knew merely that a gang which took them as banca
drivers would stage a robbery and they were left at the beach by the
gang men, the fact that the latter killed several people in escaping
will not make them liable as accomplices. Their complicity must
accordingly be limited to the robbery, not with the killing. Having been
left in the banca, they could not have tried to prevent the killings as
is required of one seeking relief from liability for assault committed
during the robbery.

Similarly, in People v. Adriano y Sanguesa, 95 SCRA 107, it
was held that the most that could be found against Pedro Bernardo
is that he knew of the robbery only, but not of the killing. He knew
that the money turned over to him for safekeeping was the product
of robbery. He should, therefore, be held as accessory only of simple
robbery, not of the grave offense of robbery with homicide.
Note\ Article 53 provides that the penalty to be imposed upon
the accessories to the commission of a consummated felony is the
penalty lower by two degrees than that prescribed by law for the
consummated felony.
If the consummated felony is robbery with homicide, there is
no legal basis for imposing upon the accessory the penalty lower by
two degrees than that prescribed for robbery only. Robbery cannot be
separated from homicide, because they are merged in the composite,
integrated whole
the special complex crime of robbery with
homicide punishable with one penalty.

—

All who participated in the robbery as principals are principals in
robbery with homicide.

When homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion of
robbery, all those who took part as principals in the robbery would
also be held liable as principals of the single and indivisible felony
of robbery with homicide although they did not actually take part in
the killing, unless it clearly appears that they endeavored to prevent
the same. (People v. Carrozo, 342 SCRA 600(2000]; People v. Verzosa,

TITLE TEN

Art. 294

Robbery with homicide distinguished from highway robbery.

The trial court erred in convicting accused-appellant of the
crime of highway robbery with homicide. To be sure, the crime
accused-appellant committed was robbery with homicide, not highway
robbery as defined in P.D. No. 532. Conviction for highway robbery
requires proof that several accused were organized for the purpose
of committing it indiscriminately.

In the case at bar, there is no proof that accused-appellant
and “Johnny” organized themselves to commit highway robbery.
The prosecution established only a single act of robbery against a
particular person. This is not what is contemplated under P.D. No.
532, the objective of which is to deter and punish lawless elements
who commit acts of depredation upon persons and properties of
innocent and defenseless inhabitants who travel from one place to
another, thereby disturbing the peace and tranquility of the nation
and stunting the economic and social progress of the people.
Consequently, accused-appellant should be held liable for the
special complex crime of robbery with homicide. Under Article 294 of
the R.P.C., when homicide is committed by reason or on the occasion
of robbery, the penalty to be imposed is reclusion perpetua to death.
(People u. Pascual, Jr., G.R. No. 132870, May 29, 2002)

PARAGRAPH 2: ROBBERY WITH RAPE
As regards the special complex crime of robbery with rape, the
law uses the phrase “when the robbery shall have been accompanied
by rape.”

But like in robbery with homicide, the offender must have the
intent to take the personal property belonging to another with intent
to gain, and such intent must precede the rape.
Rape committed on the occasion of the robbery.

This is usually committed when, while some robbers are
ransacking for personal property in the house, the other is raping a
woman in the same house.

863

Art. 294

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Even if the rape was committed In another place, it is still robbery
with rape.

In the case of U.S. v. Tiongco, et al., 37 Phil. 951, two of the
offenders compelled two women, living in the house where the robbery
was committed, to go with them. While on the way to the place where
they had their banco hidden, the two men separated themselves from
the band and took the two women to a place near the river where,
through force and intimidation, they raped them. Thereafter, the two
men left the women and joined their companions.
Held: Robbery with rape was committed. It is not necessary that
the rape be committed prior to or simultaneously with the robbery.
So the law says, in the definition of the crime, that when the robbery
is accompanied by rape or mutilation, etc.

old daughter of Magdaleno. The appellant dragged her out and, with
the aid of Gil Sayuco, brought her downstairs under a mango tree.
Notwithstanding the girl’s cries for help, her father and mother
could not come to her rescue, the first being then tied to the wall
and the second having been pushed away whenever she attempted
to intervene. In spite of Benedicta’s resistance, the appellant, with
the help of his three companions, was able to have sexual intercourse
with Benedicta. Gil Sayuco then took his turn in raping the girl,
followed in succession by the other two companions. Not contented
with merely satisfying their lust, the appellant, Gil Sayuco, and
another companion returned to the house and took away a rice bowl,
some rice and four chickens, all worth about fifteen pesos. (People v.
Canastre, 82 Phil. 482)

Note: But if the rape is committed against a woman in a house
other than that where the robbery is committed, the rape should be
considered a separate offense.

In this case, the intention of the culprits from the beginning was
to take personal property. Even if the rape was committed before the
taking of the rice and chickens, they were guilty of robbery with rape.
Rape was not their primary objective.

There is no such crime as robbery with attempted rape.

Robbery and rape, as separate crimes.

Article 294, paragraph 2, which punishes robbery with rape
(consummated) does not cover robbery with attempted rape.
The crime cannot be a complex crime of robbery with attempted
rape under Article 48, because a robbery cannot be a necessary means
to commit attempted rape; nor attempted rape, to commit robbery.
Both crimes cannot be the result of a single act. (See People u. Cariaga,
CA., 54 O.G. 4307)
Rape was committed before taking of personal property.

If the intention of the accused was to rob but rape was also
committed even before the asportation, the crime is robbery with
rape. To be liable for the special complex crime of robbery with rape
the intent to take personal property of another must precede the rape.
(People v. Dinol, G.R. No. 54567, March 22, 1990)
At about one o’clock in the morning of June 28, 1946, the
appellant and Gil Sayuco, together with two unidentified companions,

mind sexual gratification and the taking of the cash and pieces of

resistance. B was able to release her legs. She kicked A, as a result of which
the latter loosened his hold on her. B was able to stand up. It was while B was

in the act of running away that A snatched her vanity case from her hand.

Held: The crime at bar is not one of robbery with rape, especially and
specifically penalized by Article 294, paragraph 2, of the R.P.C. Article 48 of
the Revised Penal Code does not find application in the instant case because
[the Court] ( is J not here confronted with a single act which constitutes two or
more grave or less grave felonies, and the attempted rape is not a necessary
means of committing the theft or vice versa. The theft was committed as an
independent act following appellant's failure to consummate the rape.
The lower court is correct in declaring that two crimes were committed
by appellant, namely, attempted rape and theft.

Additional rapes committed on the same occasion of robbery will
not increase the penalty.

There is no law providing that the additional rape/s or homicide/s
should be considered as aggravating circumstances. The enumeration
of aggravating circumstances under Article 14 of the Revised Penal
Code is exclusive as opposed to the enumeration in Article 13 of the
same Code regarding mitigating circumstances where there is a
specific paragraph (Art. 10), providing for analogous circumstances.

It is true that the additional rapes (or killings in the case of
multiple homicide on the occasion of the robbery) would result in an
“anomalous situation” where from the standpoint of the gravity of the
offense, robbery with one rape would be on the same level as robbery
with multiple rapes. However, the remedy lies with the legislature. A
penal law is liberally construed in favor of the offender and no person
should be brought within its terms if he is not clearly made so by the
statute. (People v. Regala, G.R. No. 130508, April 5, 2000)
When the taking of property after the rape is not with intent to gain,
there is neither theft nor robbery committed.

Villarino, C.A.-G.R. No. 6342-R, November 26, 1951)

Civil liability for robbery with rape.
In a case of robbery with rape, the accused should pay the
offended party the value of the stolen property and indemnify the
offended woman for damages. The civil liability for rape in robbery
with rape has been set at P100,000. (People v. Jugueta, supra)
Concerning the acknowledgment and support of the offspring of
rape, Article 345 of the Revised Penal Code provides for three kinds of
civil liability that may be imposed on the offender: a) indemnification,
b) acknowledgment of the offspring, unless the law should prevent
him from so doing, and c) in every case to support the offspring. With
the passage of the Family Code, the classification of acknowledged
natural children and natural children by legal fiction was eliminated
and they now fall under the specie of illegitimate children. Since
parental authority is vested by Article 176 of the Family Code upon
the mother and considering that an offender sentenced to reclusion
perpetua automatically loses parental authority over his children,
no “further positive act is required of the parent as the law itself
provides for the child’s status.” Hence, accused-appellant should only
be ordered to indemnify and support the victim’s child. However, the
amount and terms of support shall be determined by the trial court
after due notice and hearing in accordance with Article 201 of the
Family Code. (People v. Magtibay, G.R. No. 142985, August 6, 2002)

When rape and homicide co-exist in the commission of robbery.
When the accused committed robbery in a house, killed the head
of the family there and raped his wife in the rice field to which she
had been taken, the crime is robbery with homicide and rape under
paragraph 1 of Article 294, the rape to be considered as an aggravating
circumstance only. (People v. Ganal, et al., 85 Phil. 743; People v.
Bacsa, 104 Phil. 136; People v. Villa, 93 SCRA 716)

in the Semacio’s premises, one of the armed men demanded money
and jewelry. Thereafter, they started to ransack the house. When
the husband of Zenaida arrived, the robbers went out and promptly
killed him and his luckless companions. In the house of the Sarney’s,
all the male occupants were asked to come out first. Only then did
the men begin to ransack the place. After ransacking the house, the
male occupants were shot to death. As for the rapes committed then,
the trial court was correct in treating the raping of Elvira Samoy and
Zenaida Semacio as an aggravating circumstance. (People v. Timple,
237 SCRA 52)

When the violence or intimidation is necessary, paragraph 4 of
Article 294 is not applicable.
Although one of the victims was bound and beaten with the
butt of a gun, this would not constitute unnecessary violence under
paragraph 4 of Article 294, because it appears that the beating was
for the purpose of compelling him to show the place where he kept
his money, something he refused to do at first, and which the robbers
would not have been able to ascertain had they not resorted to the
violence. (U.S. u. De los Santos, 6 Phil. 411)

PARAGRAPH 3: ROBBERY WITH
SERIOUS PHYSICAL INJURIES

Inflicting serious physical injuries defined in subdivisions 3 and 4 of
Article 263 “upon any person not responsible for its commission."

In a case, the accused assaulted the victim and robbed him of
Pl 7.00. The victim lost the hearing of one ear, as a result of one of
the blows he received from the accused. The Supreme Court held that
the accused was guilty of robbery under Article 294, paragraph 3, the
physical injuries inflicted being covered by Article 263, paragraph 2.

Suppose that in the course of the execution of the crime of
robbery, one of the offenders inflicted upon another robber, who
wanted to get all the loot, physical injuries which resulted in the
latter’s deformity, is the crime, robbery with serious physical injuries?
Note the wording of the law as regards this question. It says: “upon
any person not responsible for its commission.” It would seem that
the penalty prescribed in paragraph 4 of Article 294 should not
be applied. The offender who inflicted on another robber, physical
injuries which later resulted in deformity, would be liable for two
crimes, namely: (1) robbeiy; and (2) serious physical injuries under
Article 263, paragraph 3.

Art. 294

(People v. Luncay, 49 Phil. 464)

Note: This ruling is inconsistent with the ruling in the case
of People v. Hernandez, 94 Phil. 49, as regards the crime of serious
physical injuries committed. In that case, it was held that as the
offended party may still hear through his left ear, the case falls under
Article 263, paragraph 3.

Art. 294

Had the ruling been the same as that in the Hernandez case, the
robbery would have been punished under Article 294, paragraph 4.

The serious physical injuries defined in subdivisions 3 and 4 of
Article 263, inflicted in connection with the robbery, must be inflicted
“in the course of its execution.”

PARAGRAPH 4: ROBBERY WITH UNNECESSARY
VIOLENCE AND INTIMIDATION

Hence, if the victim became deformed or lost any other part of
his body or the use thereof, or became ill or incapacitated for his work
for more than 90 days (Art. 263, par. 3), or became ill or incapacitated
for labor for more than 30 days (Art. 263, par. 4), it is necessary to
determine whether the physical injuries were inflicted in the course
of the execution of the robbery.

Tying the victim after wounding him and leaving him tied to the
trunk of a tree on the craggy ground after taking his money constitutes
unnecessary violence and intimidation referred to in paragraph 4 of
Article 294. (People u. Manzanillo, et al., 43 Phil. 167)
The violence need not result in serious physical injuries. All
that the first clause in paragraph 4 of Article 294 requires is that the
violence be unnecessary for the commission of the robbery.

858

If they were inflicted after the taking of the personal property
had been complete, the serious physical injuries mentioned should
be considered as separate offense.

859

2.

Grabbing pawn ticket from the hands of another and
intimidating him. (U.S. u. Blanco, 10 Phil. 298)

When the act of snatching did not result in violence against the
person of the offended party, the crime of robbery is not committed.

In a case where the accused snatched the shoulder bag of the
offended party which was hanging on her left shoulder, there being
no violence, intimidation or force in snatching her shoulder bag, it
was held that the snatching of the shoulder bag constitutes the crime
of theft, not robbery. (People v. Concepcion, G.R. No. 200922, July

and clothing, and took off with it while the owners had their backs
turned, the accused was found guilty of theft. (People v. de la Cruz,
76 Phil. 601 [1946])
Intimidation exists in the following cases:
1.

Violence or intimidation need not be present before or at the exact
moment when the object is taken.

Violence or intimidation may enter at any time before the owner
is finally deprived of his property. This is so, because asportation is
a complex fact, a whole divisible into parts, a series of acts, in the
course of which personal violence or intimidation may be injected.
Thus, where a person picked the pocket of another who, becoming
aware of it, tried to recover his property, but a companion of the thief
prevented him by using force and violence, the crime committed is
robbery, because violence was used before the owner is finally deprived
of the property. (People u. Omambong, C.A., G.R. No. 44645, June

3, 1936)

When the complainant was on her way home after selling a
ring in a market, Sope pointed a revolver at her while Cruz
poked her back with a hard object. Then, Cruz and Dimalanta
pretended to be peace officers, apprehending her for unlawfully
dealing in U.S. Army goods and pointing to her a bag with
such goods which they themselves had brought along, with the
result that the complainant gave them P200.00. (U.S. v. Sope,
et al., 75 Phil. 812)
The accused, in a guerrilla uniform, told the complainant to
hand him all his money and personal belongings, and when
the complainant replied he had no money, the accused told
him to stand up and searched his watch pocket, from which he
took P40.00 in paper currency. The complainant allowed the
accused to search him because the accused was armed. The
accused kept on pushing him back and forth and looked as if he
was going to strike him. It was held that the acts performed by
861

Art. 294

Crimes Against Property

the accused in their nature inspired the victim with fear and
restricted and hindered the free exercise of his will. (People v.
Lim Ho Peng, G.R. No. L-229, August 29, 1946)
In robbery with intimidation, there must be acts done by the accused
which, either by their own nature or by reason of the circumstances
under which they are executed, inspire fear in the person against
whom they are directed.

Intimidation is defined in Black’s Law Dictionary as unlawful
coercion; extortion; duress; putting in fear. (People v. Alfeche, Jr.,
G.R. No. 102070, July 23, 1992, 211 SCRA 770, 779)
In robbery with intimidation of persons, “the intimidation
consists in causing or creating a fear in the mind of a person or in
bringing in a sense of mental distress in view of a risk or evil that
may be impending really or in imagination” and such fear of injury
to person or property must continue to operate on the mind of the
victim at the time of the delivery of the money. Where the complainant
knew of the plan laid down for the entrapment of the accused, at the
same time participating in the execution thereof, and he delivered the
money to the accused, not from fear, but for the purpose of bringing
the accused to justice, the accused is not liable for robbery with
intimidation of persons. (People v. Marco, 12 CA. Rep. 377)
Threats to extort money distinguished from robbery through
intimidation.

—

In both crimes, there is intimidation by the offender. The
purpose, when threat is made to extort money, is identical
to
obtain gain.

The differences are:
(1) In robbery, the intimidation is actual and immediate',
whereas in threats, the intimidation is conditional or
future, that is, not immediate;
(2) In robbery, the intimidation is personal, while in threats,
it may be through an intermediary;
(3) In threats, the intimidation may refer to the person, honor
or property of the offended party or that of his family;
while in robbery, the intimidation is directed only to the
person of the victim;
862

(4)

Art. 294

In robbery, the gain of the culprit is immediate; whereas
in threats, the gain of the culprit is not immediate. (People
v. Moreno, CA., G.R. No. 43635, April 30, 1936)

Robbery with violence distinguished from grave coercion.
(1)

In both crimes, there is violence used by the offender;

(2)

While in robbery, there is intent to gain, such element is not
present in coercion.

The only distinction between these two crimes is just a matter of
intention. If the purpose of the accused in taking somebody’s property
by force or intimidation is to obtain gain, the crime is robbery; but
if his purpose is to compel another to do something against his will,
without authority of law, but believing himself to be the owner or
creditor, and thereby seizes property, then the crime is grave coercion.
(U.S. v. Villa- Abrille, 36 Phil. 807)

Problem:
A lost his watch. One day, A saw B using the watch. A,
recognizing the watch, asked B to give it to him because it was his
property. Because B refused, A, with drawn pistol, told him that if B
would not give him the watch, A would kill him. Because of fear for
his life, B gave the watch to A against B’s will.

Is the crime committed by A robbery, grave threats or grave
coercion?

It is grave coercion, because B was compelled to do something
against his will, whether it be right or wrong.
It cannot be threats, because in the crime of threats, the
intimidation is not actual and immediate. It is true that there was
a sort of a condition made, that is, B would be killed if he would not
give A the watch. But in threats, the intimidation must promise some
future harm or injury. When the effect of the intimidation is immediate
and the offended party is compelled thereby to do something against
his will, whether it be right or wrong, the crime committed is grave
coercion.

It cannot be robbery, because there is no intent to gain, as A

believed that the watch he was taking was his own property.
863

Art. 294

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

Robbery and bribery, distinguished.

The principal distinction between the two offenses is that in
bribery, the transaction is mutual and voluntary; in the case of
robbery, the transaction is neither voluntary nor mutual, but is
consummated by the use of force or intimidation. If the offended
party had voluntarily offered to pay the defendant the P2.00, the
transaction would have constituted bribery. But such is not this case.
The defendant demanded the payment of the P2.00, accompanying
the demand with threats of prosecution and arrest and is therefore
guilty of robbery. (People v. Francisco, L-21390, March 26, 1924)
In robbery, the victim is deprived of his money or property by
force or intimidation; in bribery, he parts with his money or property in
a sense voluntarily. (U.S. v. Flores, 19 Phil. 178) The following doctrine
was laid down in Flores: A policeman who, knowing that a person has
committed no crime for which he could be lawfully arrested and tried,
nevertheless arrests such person, falsely accusing him of a crime, and
then by means of threats of presentation and imprisonment, thus
playing upon his ignorance and fear, obtains money from the said
person, secures such money by force and intimidation and commits
the crime of robbery as defined by the penal Code.”
In PO2 Flores v. People, G.R. No. 222861, April 23, 2018, the
accused, a traffic police officer, was found guilty of simple robbery
(extortion) when he confiscated the driver’s license of the offended
party, a taxi driver who figured in a vehicular accident, and demanded
the amount of P2.000 for its return. The Court found the accused to
have employed intimidation to obtain the P2.000 from the offended
party as the act he performed caused fear in the mind of the latter
and hindered the free exercise of his will. For the offended party
whose daily living depends on his earnings from driving a taxi, the
thought of not having his driver’s license back and the possibility that
he might not be able to drive a taxi and earn a living for his family
prompted him to give the amount demanded. Petitioner succeeded in
forcing the offended party to choose between parting with his money
or have his driver’s license confiscated or cancelled.
Thus, where an agent of authority took away from its owner,
against his will, one fish valued at P10.00, making the threat that if
he would not give him the fish, he would be taken to the headquarters
to explain why he was selling fish caught by means of dynamite, and
864

TITLE TEN

Art. 295

because of the threat, he gave the fish to the agent, although the fish
was not caught by means of dynamite, the crime committed is robbery
under paragraph 5 of Article 294.

If the owner of the fish in that case in fact used dynamite in
catching the fish and he gave the fish to the agent to avoid prosecution
under the Fisheries Act, the crime would be bribery. (People u. Munar,
CA., 47 O.G. 2461)

Must be alleged in the information.

Any of these five qualifying circumstances of robbery with
physical injuries or intimidation must be alleged in the information
and proved during the trial.
Being qualifying, it cannot be offset by a generic mitigating
circumstance.

Any of these qualifying circumstances cannot be offset by a
generic mitigating circumstance.

If robbery by a band is committed in an uninhabited place,
“by a band" is qualifying and “uninhabited place" would be generic
aggravating circumstance only. (See U.S. v. Gapas, 18 Phil. 629)
The intimidation with the use of firearm qualifies only robbery on
a street, road, highway or alley.

This is indicated in the head note of the article which says: “or
with the use of firearm on a street, road, highway, or alley.”
Article 295 does not apply to robbery with homicide, or robbery with
rape, or robbery with serious physical injuries under paragraph 1
of Article 263.

Article 295 provides for different cases in which robbery with
violence against or intimidation of persons is qualified.

This article does not apply:
(1)

When by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of
homicide is committed (subdivision 1, Art. 294);
(2) When the robbery is accompanied by rape or intentional
mutilation, or arson (subdivision 1, Art. 294); or
(3) If by reason or on occasion of robbery, any of the serious
physical injuries resulting in insanity, imbecility,
impotency or blindness is inflicted (subdivision 2, Art.

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

The reason is that this article mentions subdivisions 3, 4 and 5 of

Article 294, omitting subdivisions 1 and 2 which refer to robbery with
homicide, robbery with rape, robbery with intentional mutilation, and
robbery with serious physical injuries resulting in insanity, imbecility,
impotency or blindness of the victim.
Thus, when robbery with homicide was committed by attacking
a motor vehicle or moving train, or on the street, road, highway or
alley with the use of firearms, the penalty prescribed by subdivision 1
of Article 294 shall not be imposed in the maximum period. The same
is true with respect to robbery with rape or robbery with intentional

mutilation.
However, if there is no mitigating circumstance to offset it, the
fact that robbery with homicide or robbery with rape is committed in
an uninhabited place or by a band will have the effect of increasing
the penalty to the maximum period, because it will be considered as
an aggravating circumstance under Article 14.

Article 295 is inapplicable to robbery with homicide, rape,
intentional mutilation, and lesiones graves resulting in insanity,
imbecility, impotency, or blindness. If the foregoing classes of robbery
which are described in Article 294(1) and (2) are perpetrated by a
band, they would not be punishable under Article 295, but then,
cuadrilla would be generic aggravating circumstance under Article 14
of the Code. (People v. Salip Mania, 30 SCRA 389; People v. Damaso,
86 SCRA 370)

Any member of a band who was present at the commission of
a robbery by the band, shall be punished as principal of any of

Requisites for liability for the acts of the other members of the band.

A member of the band is liable for any of the assaults committed
by the other members thereof, when the following requisites concur
1.

That he was a member of the band.

2.
3.

That he was present at the commission of a robbery by
that band.
That the other members of the band committed an assault.

4.

That he did not attempt to prevent the assault.

All of the elements of robbery in band had been satisfactorily

established herein. At least five people, including accused, carrying
guns and a hand grenade, barged into the home of, and forcibly took
pieces of jewelry and other personal properties belonging to the

offended parties. Accused themselves made their intent to gain clear
when they assured their victims that they were only after the money.
(People v. Basao, G.R. No. 189820, October 10, 2012)
Clubs are arms.

The clubs are arms which, in the hands of the members of a
band, may be as dangerous to the life of one who would resist the
depredations of the band as are revolvers or bolos. (U.S. v.dela Cruz,
et al., 12 Phil. 87)
When the robbery was not committed by a band, the robber who did
not take part in the assault by another is not liable for that assault
Thus, in the case where three persons committed robbery in
a house, two of the robbers committed rape upstairs, while the
third guarded the owner of the house downstairs, the first two were
convicted of robbery with rape, while the third was convicted of
robbery only. (People v. Pascual, GJl. No. L-4801, June 30, 1953, 93

Phil. 1114)

There must be proof that he made an endeavor to prevent the
assault committed by another member of the band, in order that he
may not be held liable for such assault. (People v. Mendoza, et al.,

But when there is conspiracy to commit homicide and robbery, all

Inasmuch as the crime committed is robbery in band and the
accused, who denies all intervention therein, admits having been
present at the commission of the crime without having done anything
to prevent the murder of three people, his liability is the same as
that of the principals in the crime of robbery with homicide. (People
v. Gallemos, et al., 61 Phil. 884)

arm themselves for the purpose, no member of the group may disclaim
responsibility for any act of violence that is perpetrated by reason or
on the occasion of the robbery. Such violence is always reasonably
to be expected, either to overcome active opposition or to forestall it
altogether by disabling the victim at the very outset, or even to silence

the conspirators, even if less than four armed men, are liable for
the special complex crime of robbery with homicide.

him completely thereafter. In the instant case, the group that set
out for Batac to rob Ko Pian was provided with lethal weapons a
dagger, an ice pick and a gun. These instruments were intended to
facilitate the commission of the robbery, and if their use resulted in
homicide, the liability therefor attached to the entire group. (People v.
Espejo, supra) Similarly, where a group of persons armed themselves
to hold up jeepney passengers, no member of the group can disclaim
responsibility for any violent act taken by anyone of them. (People v.
Vallente, 144 SCRA 495)

—

“Any member of a band who is present at the commission of a
robbery by the band.”

A principal by inducement, who did not go with the band at the
place of the commission of the robbery, is not liable for robbery with
homicide, but only for robbery in band, there being no evidence that
he gave instructions to kill the victim or intended that this should
be done.

The Supreme Court held: “When Ciriaco Ibafiez furnished the
transportation for the other defendants, he did so for the purpose
of having the said defendants rob the two stores. The robbery was
his principal object. It is true that homicide resulted on the occasion
of this robbery but there is nothing in the record which shows, or
tends to show, that Ciriaco gave instructions to kill the Chinaman
or intended that this should be done. When the Chinaman was
killed, the robbery had already been committed. The murder was an
incident to the robbery, which places the crime, so far as the other
accused are concerned, in a different class. Yet under these facts
and circumstances, Ciriaco can not be held to be a principal in the
commission of this crime or class of robbery, but he is a principal in
the commission of the other class, robbery in band. There is nothing
in the record to show that he planned or conspired to commit the
murder. It has been suggested that as he, Ciriaco, entered into an
agreement with the other defendants to commit this crime of robbery,
he is responsible for all the result of that crime, as he knew that death
might be a necessary incident to the carrying into effect of this plan.
If the death of the Chinaman had occurred in the very act or at the
very time that the robbery took place, or while it was going on, and if
it had been necessary to kill the Chinaman in order to successfully rob
870

Art. 296

the stores, then the question might have been different (a question
which [the Court] do[es] not now decide), but as the actual taking
of the property had already terminated, [the Court] think[s], in the
absence of proof showing that the murder was a part of the original
plan, that the foregoing holding is the correct one.” (U.S. v. Ibanez,
19 Phil. 475)

Note: Article 296 is not applicable to principal by induction, who
was not present at the commission of the robbery, if the agreement
were only to commit robbery. The article speaks of more than three
armed malefactors (who) “take part in the commission of robbery”
and member of a band “who is present at the commission of a robbery
by a band.”

But the principal by induction would be liable for the homicide
or other crimes that might have resulted, if he also ordered the killing
of a particular person or any one who would resist the robbery, or the
commission of other crimes.
Conspiracy was for robbery only but homicide was also committed
on the occasion thereof — all members of the band are liable for
robbery with homicide.

The culprits formed a band. They agreed to commit robbery only.
While ransacking for the loot in a store, a patrolman arrived, and
there was an exchange of shots. The patrolman was killed.

Held: As all the accused were present when the homicide
occurred, and none of them attempted to prevent the homicide, all
are liable for robbery with homicide. (People v. Evangelista, et al.,
86 Phil. 112)

Whenever homicide is committed as a consequence of or on the
occasion of a robbery, all those who took part in the commission of the
robbery are also guilty as principals in the crime of homicide unless
it appears that they endeavored to prevent the homicide. (People v.
Escober, 157 SCRA 541; People v. Pecato, 151 SCRA 14)
Proof of conspiracy is not necessary when four or more armed
persons committed robbery.

Proof of conspiracy is not essential to hold a member of the band
liable for robbery with homicide actually committed by the other
members of the band. (People v. De la Rosa, et al., 90 Phil. 365)

There is no crime as “robbery with homicide in band.”

With the present wording of Article 295, there is no crime
as “robbery with homicide in band.” If the robbery with homicide
is committed by a band, the indictable offense would still be
denominated as “robbery with homicide” under Article 294(1),
but the circumstance that it was committed by a band would be
appreciated as an ordinary aggravating circumstance. (People u.

“Without prejudice to the criminal liability for illegal possession of

In addition to his criminal liability for robbery by a band, the
accused is also liable for unlawful possession of firearm which is
penalized by R.A. No. 10591.
The unlawful acquisition, possession of firearms and ammunition
shall be penalized as follows:

But where in the course of the robbery by a band, the offended
woman was taken by one of the accused to a place away from the house
where the robbery was committed, and there he raped her without
the knowledge of his companions, he alone is guilty of robbery with
rape. His companions would be guilty only of simple robbery by a

present at the commission of the robbery, not necessarily at the

The use of a loose firearm, when inherent in the commission of a
crime punishable under the Revised Penal Code or other special laws,
shall be considered as an aggravating circumstance: Provided, That
if the crime committed with the use of a loose firearm is penalized by
the law with a maximum penalty which is lower than that prescribed
in the preceding section for illegal possession of firearm, the penalty
for illegal possession of firearm shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty
for the crime charged: Provided, further, That if the crime committed
with the use of a loose firearm is penalized by the law with a maximum
penalty which is equal to that imposed under the preceding section
for illegal possession of firearms, the penalty of prision mayor in its
minimum period shall be imposed in addition to the penalty for the
crime punishable under the Revised Penal Code or other special laws
of which he/she is found guilty. (Sec. 29)
The use of firearm, whether licensed or unlicensed, in making the
intimidation is a qualifying circumstance when the robbery defined
in any of paragraphs 3, 4, and 5 of Article 294 is committed on a
street, road, highway, or alley.

Article 295 makes no distinction as regards the firearm used in
making the intimidation to commit robbery. Hence, the firearm may
be licensed or unlicensed. But the offense committed should not be
robbery with homicide, robbery with rape, robbery with intentional
mutilation, or robbery with serious physical injuries where the injured
person became insane, imbecile, impotent, or blind. The robbery must

deserve a higher penalty under the provisions of this Code.

—

The term “homicide” is used in a generic sense.

The term “homicide” in Article 297 is used in a generic sense.
(People v. Manuel, 44 Phil. 333) Hence, it includes multiple homicides,
murder, parricide, or even infanticide, as where the offenders killed
a child two days old which was disturbed in its sleep and began to
cry when they were about to take personal property in the house.
The penalty is the same, whether the robbery is attempted or
frustrated.

As long as homicide is committed by reason or on occasion of an
attempted or frustrated robbery, the penalty of reclusion temporal in
its maximum period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed.

“Unless the homicide committed shall deserve a higher penalty.”
The clause “unless the homicide committed shall deserve a
higher penalty under the provisions of this Code” may be illustrated
thus: In an attempted or frustrated robbery, the killing of the victim is
qualified by treachery or relationship. The proper penalty for murder
or parricide shall be imposed because it is more severe.

for some water to drink. Serapio Carunungan, Manuel Buceta and Felipe
Mendoza went up and forced their way to the house. Carunungan made a
demand to the inmates of the house to bring out their money. Lorenzo got hold
of his own firearm and confronted the trio. All of a sudden, the intruders
started firing at Lorenzo who returned the fire. After the gunfire stopped,
Lorenzo Vivas and Felipe Mendoza were found dead.

Art. 297

A, B, C, and D agreed to commit robbery. By their agreement, A
and B went to the hut to watch the inmates, while C and D were to
take away the carabaos. While C and D were untying the carabaos,
they heard the scream: “Oh! save my life!” which was interrupted
by a pistol shot by A. Fearing that the shot might summon help, the
accused escaped without taking the carabaos, although one of them
had already been untied.

Held: All are liable for the crime of attempted robbery with
homicide, even if C and D did not enter the hut and did not take part
in the assault. (People v. Morados, 70 Phil. 558; People v. Dagundong,
et al., 108 Phil. 682)

Held: The Court agrees with the Court of Appeals that the crime
committed is attempted robbery with homicide. The demand made by
Carunungan to the inmates of the house to bring out their money constitutes
an overt act which would lead to the commission of the robbery. If the robbery
was not committed, it was because of armed resistance. The killing was
apparently an offshoot of the plan to carry out the robbery.

Robbery with homicide and attempted or frustrated robbery
with homicide are special complex crimes, not governed by Article
48, but by the special provisions of Articles 294 and 297, respectively.

When there is no overt act of robbery.

When Article 48 is applicable in robbery.

But where an armed band tried to stop a passenger bus, and
the driver, sensing that the band might commit robbery, did not stop
the bus but drove it faster, and the members of the band then fired
at it, killing one passenger and wounding another passenger and
the driver, the crime does not constitute attempted robbery with
homicide, because no overt acts pointing to robbery were established.
The offenses committed are the separate crimes of murder, frustrated
murder, and physical injuries. (People v. Olaes, 105 Phil. 502)

When the offense committed is attempted or frustrated robbery
with serious physical injuries, Article 48 is applicable, since the felony
would fall neither under Article 294 which covers consummated
robbery with homicide nor under Article 297 which covers attempted
or frustrated robbery with homicide. (People v. Villanueva, CA.-G.R.
No. 2676, May 31, 1939)

Frustrated robbery with homicide.
The accused agreed to rob two LCM boats from the Navy boat
pool with the idea of selling them for profit. They disarmed the guard
and when they failed to take the boats, because they could not start
the motor, they killed the guard. (People v. Ramires, G.R. No. L-5875,
May 15, 1953, 93 Phil. 1109)
Article 296 Is applicable to attempted robbery with homicide by a
band.

Special complex crime.

When the crime committed is robbery with frustrated homicide,
the penalty for the more serious crime, which is frustrated homicide,
should be imposed in its maximum period, as provided in Article 48.
(People v. Cagongon, CA., 74 O.G. 59, No. 1, January 2, 1978)

There is only one crime of attempted robbery with homicide even
if slight physical injuries were inflicted on other persons on the
occasion or by reason of the robbery.
People v. Casalme, et al.
(101 Phil. 1249)

Article 296 is applicable when the crime of attempted robbery
with homicide is committed by a band.

Facts: On March 22, 1954, at about 9:00 in the evening, the defendants,
on the pretext that a companion needed treatment, gained entrance in the
house of Isidro Tolentino, a quack doctor. When asked who among them
needed treatment, defendant Casalme suddenly and without warning, shot

the old man Isidro with a Garand rifle, inflicting a wound from which Isidro
died the next morning. Honorata Barquilla, wife of Isidro, grabbed a bolo and
proceeded to hack the defendant Gamboa. Awakened by the commotion, and
upon seeing Gamboa struggling with his mother, Lucas Tolentino took hold
of a knife and stabbed Gamboa in the back. One of the defendants tried to
force open their aparador where the spouses kept their money and valuables
but Honorata prevented him from doing so. Because of the resistance offered
by mother and son, the intruders hurriedly left the house. Honorata and her
son suffered slight physical injuries inflicted by the culprits. Prosecuted,
defendants were found guilty.

Held: The trial court found the defendants guilty of three separate
crimes, namely: attempted robbery with homicide for the killing of Isidro
Tolentino; the complex crime of attempted robbery with slight physical
injuries for the wounding of Honorata Barquilla; and the same crime for the
wounding of Lucas Tolentino, as a result of which three separate penalties
were imposed. Appellants are guilty of only one crime, namely, attempted
robbery with homicide and slight physical injuries, under Article 297 of the
Revised Penal Code, penalized with reclusion temporal in its maximum
period to reclusion perpetua, and that due to the aggravating circumstances
of
nighttime, dwelling, and craft, without any mitigating circumstances to offset
the same, the greater penalty should be imposed, namely, reclusion perpetua.

Note: The slight physical injuries should be disregarded in the
designation of the offense, for there is no such crime as attempted robbery
with homicide and slight physical injuries. Article 297 speaks of attempted
or frustrated robbery with homicide.

Art. 298. Execution of deeds by means of violence or
Any person who, with intent to defraud
another, by means of violence or intimidation, shall compel
him to sign, execute, or deliver any public instrument or
document, shall be held guilty of robbery and punished by

Elements:
1.
2.
3.

That the offender has intent to defraud another.
That the offender compels him to sign, execute, or deliver any
public instrument or document.
That the compulsion is by means of violence or
intimidation.
878

Art. 298

“Shall be held guilty of robbery and punished by the penalties
respectively prescribed in this chapter.”

If the violence used resulted in the death of the person to be
defrauded, the crime is robbery with homicide and the penalty for that
crime as prescribed in paragraph 1 of Article 294 shall be imposed.
If the execution of deeds by means of violence is only in the
attempted or frustrated stage and the violence used resulted in the
death of the person to be defrauded, the penalty prescribed in Article
297 shall be imposed.
Must the document be public?

The Spanish text of this article says “escritura publica o

documento.”
The adjective “public” must therefore describe the word
“instrument” only. Hence, this article applies even if the document
signed, executed or delivered is a private or commercial document.
Article 298 is not applicable if the document is void.

Article 298 is not applicable if the document is void. (II Cuello
Calon, Codigo Penal, 10th Ed., pp. 820-824)
If a person, by means of violence or intimidation and with intent
to defraud, compelled another to sign a void document, would he
be liable for grave coercion? No. In grave coercion, the offender
does not have intent to gain. It seems that he would be liable for
physical injuries, if the violence resulted in physical injuries, or
grave threats under subdivision No. 2 of Article 282, if there is only

intimidation.
Distinguished from coercion.

When the offended party is under obligation to sign, execute or
deliver the document under the law, there is no robbery. There will
be coercion if violence is used in compelling the offended party to sign
or deliver the document.
Thus, one who, having bought and fully paid the price of a car,
compelled the seller by means of violence or intimidation to sign,
execute and deliver the corresponding deed of sale, would be guilty
of grave coercion, not robbery since there is no intent to defraud.
879

Art. 299

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Section Two. - Robbery by the use of force upon things
This is the other kind of robbery. The person liable for robbery
by the use of force upon things, does not use violence against or
intimidation of any person in taking personal property belonging to
another with intent to gain, for, otherwise, he will be liable under
Article 294.
Robbery by the use of force upon things is committed only
when either (1) the offender entered a house or building by any of
the means specified in Article 299 or Article 302, or (2) even if there
was no entrance by any of those means, he broke a wardrobe, chest,
or any other kind of locked or closed or sealed furniture or receptacle
in the house or building, or he took it away to be broken or forced
open outside. In any of such cases, the taking of personal property
belonging to another with intent to gain from the broken furniture
or receptacle, or the taking away of the locked or closed or sealed
furniture or receptacle to be broken or forced open outside the house
or building would be robbery.

What are the two kinds of robbery with force upon things?

One essential requisite of robbery with force upon things under
Articles 299 and 302 is that the malefactor should enter the building

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Criminal Law

If the robbery be committed in one of the dependencies
of an inhabited house, public building, or building dedicated
to religious worship, the penalties next lower in degree than
those prescribed in this article shall be imposed. (As amended
by RA. No. 18 and RA. No. 10951)

Article 299 provides for two modes of committing robbery with
force upon things.

ROBBERY WITH FORCE UPON THINGS UNDER SUBDIVISION (A).
Elements:
1.

That the offender entered (a) an inhabited place, or (b) public
building, or (c) edifice devoted to religious worship.

2.

That the entrance was effected by any of the following means:
a. Through an opening not intended for entrance or egress;
b. By breaking any wall, roof, or floor or breaking any door
or window;
c. By using false keys, picklocks or similar tools; or
d. By using any fictitious name or pretending the exercise of
public authority.
That once inside the building, the offender took personal
property belonging to another with intent to gain.

3.

The offender must “enter the house or building in which the robbery
is committed.”

Thus, if the offender merely inserted his hand through an
opening in the wall or used a pole through the window to get the

clothes inside the room, while the offender remained outside the house
or building, the crime committed is theft, not robbery.

There must be evidence or the facts must show that the accused
entered the dwelling house or building by any
of the means

enumerated in subdivision (a) of Article 299.

In the case of U.S. v. Collates, 2 Phil. 16, it was held that in the
absence of evidence to show how the offenders effected an entrance
882

Art. 299

into the convent where they took personal property, there can be no
conviction under Article 508 of the Penal Code (now Art. 299 of the
R.P.C.).

The reason for this ruling is that one of the elements of robbery
with force upon things under Article 299 states that the entrance is
effected by any of the means described in subdivision (a) of that article.
Thus, where the manner of entrance into the house was not
proven, the crime is theft and not robbery. (People u. Aurillo, CA.,
46 O.G. 2169)
This ruling applies where both the outside door and a window
of the house are open, so that it is possible that the accused might
have passed through the door.
But if at the time of the discovery of the loss of personal property
in the house, the outside door remained locked and not destroyed
and a window was opened or broken open, there is circumstantial
evidence of unlawful entry sufficient to establish robbery with force
upon things.
In entering the building, the offender must have an Intention to take
personal property.

The accused, by means of a bolo and screwdriver, began to open
the door of the store which also served as the dwelling of a Chinaman.
After loosening one of the bars of the door and becoming aware that
the inmates therein had been awakened, the accused tried to escape,
but were arrested by the policemen who had been watching them all
the time.
Held: It is not correct to convict the accused of attempted robbery.
There is no evidence to show that the intention of the accused was to
commit robbery, or that they knew that they would find money inside
the store. There still remains a sufficient indication of the existence
of an intention different from that of committing robbery. The crime
committed is attempted trespass to dwelling under Article 280, par.
2. (People v. Tayag, et al., 59 Phil. 606)

The place entered must be a house or building.

When the culprit enters the parked automobile through the
window, the glass of which he broke, the crime is theft if personal

property is taken therefrom, because the automobile is not a house
or building.

Any of the four means described in subdivision (a) of Article 299
must be resorted to by the offender to enter a house or building, not
to get out

Art. 299

What inhabited house includes.

Inhabited house is any shelter, ship or vessel constituting the
dwelling of one or more persons even though the inhabitants thereof
are temporarily absent therefrom when the robbery is committed.

(Art. 301)

What public building Includes.

Public building is every building owned by the Government or
belonging to a private person but used or rented by the Government,
although temporarily unoccupied by the same. (Art. 301)
The burnt edifice had not been inaugurated, but was to be used
as a public school. The evidence shows that said edifice had already
been delivered by the contractor to the municipality of Bigaa. What
makes a building public is not its inauguration for the purpose
intended, but the fact of the State or any of its agencies having the
title thereto. (People v. Constantino, 46 Phil. 745)
Robbery In a public building.

Where the defendant entered through the window of a public
high school building and took from the building two microscopes, he
was guilty of robbery under the first paragraph of Article 299. (U.S.
v. Acacio, 37 Phil. 70)
But if the building belonged to a private school, the crime is
robbery under Article 302, because it is either an uninhabited place
or a building other than those mentioned in the first paragraph of
Article 299.
Robbery In an edifice devoted to religious worship.

Where the accused, by means of a small lever or nail, forced
open the top of the poor box in the church, took
the money therein
contained and appropriated it to himself, the crime committed was
robbery with force upon things committed in
an edifice devoted to
religious worship under paragraph (b), No. 1, of
Article 299.
884

Art. 299

Note the opening sentence of subdivision (a) which states, “The
malefactors shall enter the house or building in which the robbery is
committed, by any of the following means:”
1.

Through an opening not intended for entrance or egress.

The window or a hole through the wall already in existence
is not intended for entrance or egress. If the culprit enters the
building through such opening and once inside he takes personal
property belonging to the occupants therein, the crime committed
is robbery.

In the case of People v. Co Cho, 62 Phil. 828, the offenders
entered the house of the offended party, by passing through the
window of the closet, and once inside, took the watch and money of
the offended party. The offenders were convicted of robbery.
But if the culprit had entered the house through an open door,
and the owner, not knowing that the culprit was inside, closed and
locked the door from the outside and left, and the culprit, after taking
personal property in the house, went out through the window, it is
only theft, not robbery.
The whole body of culprit must be inside the building to constitute
entering.

When the accused only introduced his hand through the broken
glass of a show window which he had broken in order to remove the
watches therefrom, there is no robbery, because no entrance of his
body was made. (People v. Adorno, CA., 40 O.G. 567)

2.

By breaking any wall, roof, or floor or breaking any door or
window.

Note the word “breaking” used in this means of entering the
building. The force used in this means must be actual, as distinguished
from that in the other means which is only constructive force.

885

Art 299

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The wall must be an outside wall.

The wall broken must be an outside wall, not a wall between
rooms in a house or building, because the breaking of the wall must
be for the purpose of entering the house or building where the robbery
is committed.

But if a room is occupied by a person as his separate dwelling,
the breaking of its inside wall may give rise to robbery.

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

means of entering the house or building and it can be no other than
the main or back door which must first be opened to effect entrance
by that means.
3.

Held: The Spanish text of paragraph (a) 2 of Article 299 of
the R.P.C. is as follows: “Por rompimiento de pared, techo o suelo,
a fractura de puerta o ventana." The words “fractura de puerta o
ventana" clearly mean “the breaking of a door or window," and
imply more than the mere forcing open of a door or window. If the
defendant had forced open a window and entered in that way, he
would, of course, be guilty of robbery because of having entered the
house through an opening not intended for entrance; but in the case
at bar, the defendant entered by forcing open the door by means of
some instrument. It was neither alleged nor proved that the door
was broken. The accused not having entered the store by any of the
means specified in Article 299 of the R.P.C., the crime committed by
him was theft. (People v. Fernandez, 58 Phil. 674)
Where the door itself was intact, and the accused entered the
store by removing the hinges or hooks to which the padlocks were
attached, as well as the lock of the doorknob, the crime committed was
simple theft. Where entrance is effected through a means intended for
entrance or egress, in order to qualify the crime as robbery, there must
be an actual breaking or smashing in opening the door. Removing
the hook or the contraption to which the padlock is placed to lock the
door, or using an article to open the lock attached to the door knob,
is certainly not the “breaking” contemplated by Articles 299 and 302,
R.P.C. (People v. Lising, C.A., 62 O.G. 9819)
The term door used in paragraph No. 2 of subdivision (a) of
Article 299 refers to an outside door. It is mentioned as one of the
886

By using false keys, picklocks or similar tools.

False keys are genuine keys stolen from the owner or any keys
other than those intended by the owner for use in the lock forcibly
opened by the offender. (Art. 305)

The outside door must be broken.

The accused pried the door out of the groove in which it ran and
pushed it inward. Once inside, he took personal property belonging
to the occupants of the store.

Art. 299

Picklocks or similar tools are those specially adopted to the

commission of the crime of robbery. (See Art. 304)
The genuine key must be stolen, not taken by force or with
Intimidation, from the owner.
Thus, where the offenders intimidated the inmates then outside
the house, requiring them to produce the key to the main door, once
in possession thereof they used it to open the door, and entered the
house where they took personal property, the crime committed was
robbery with intimidation of person under paragraph 5 of Article 294,
not robbery with force upon things by using a false key. (See U.S. v.
Cabamngan, 7 Phil. 191; U.S. v. Macamay, 36 Phil. 893)

The false key or picklock must be used to enter the building.

The use of false key or picklock refers to the mode of entering
the house or building and not to the method of opening a trunk in the
house (U.S. v. Macamay, 36 Phil. 893) or to the method of opening
the drawer of the cabinet. (People v. Lasam, C.A.-G.R. No. 14362-R,
February 14, 1956)
It is only theft when the false key is used to open wardrobe or locked
receptacle or drawer or inside door.

1.

The use of a false key in opening a wardrobe from which the
offender took personal property cannot give rise to robbery, for
as regards the wardrobes, chests, or any other kind of locked or
sealed furniture or receptacle, Article 299(b) requires that the
same be broken, not merely opened.

2.

Opening the money drawer by using the stolen key is not
robbery. (People u. Fernandez, 58 Phil. 674)
887

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

Art. 299

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Criminal Law
3.

If the false key or picklock was used to open an inside door, like
the door of a room, and once inside the culprit took therefrom
personal property of another, it is only theft.

But if the room is a separate dwelling place of a person, or
a family, the use of false key to open its door may give rise to
robbery.
The use of a fictitious name or the act of pretending to exercise
authority must be to enter the building.

This takes place when the robbers represented themselves as
detectives by displaying metal badges similar to those worn by regular
police officers and once inside, took the money of the offended party.
(People v. Urbano, et al., 50 Phil. 90)
Note: In the case of People v. Urbano, et al., the facts show
that the accused were already inside the store of a Chinaman when
they represented themselves as detectives. It seems that using the
fictitious names or pretending the exercise of public authority must
be the efficient cause of the opening by the offended part of the door
of his house to the accused.
ROBBERY WITH FORCE UPON THINGS UNDER SUBDIVISION (B)
OF ARTICLE 299.

Elements:
1.

2.

That the offender is inside a dwelling house, public building,
or edifice devoted to religious worship, regardless of the
circumstances under which he entered it;
That the offender takes personal property belonging to
another, with intent to gain, under any of the following cir¬
cumstances:

a.

by the breaking of doors, wardrobes, chests, or any other
kind of locked or sealed furniture or receptacle; or

b.

by taking such furniture or objects away to be broken or
forced open outside the place of the robbery.

888

Art. 299

Entrance into the building by any of the means mentioned in
subdivision (a) of Article 299 is not required in robbery under
subdivision (b) of same article.

It will be noted that the robbery defined in Article 299 is

committed in two ways, as stated in subdivisions (a) and (b).

Subdivisions (a) and (b) are separated by the words“or if,’ indicating
thereby that each subdivision is independent of the other.

Hence, to commit the robbery defined in subdivision (b) of Article
299, it is not necessary that the offender should have entered the
building by any of the means mentioned in subdivision (a).
Thus, a guest in the house of the offended party or a servant
in that house may be guilty of this kind of robbery if he breaks
open a locked wardrobe or chest inside that house or if he takes it
outside to be broken, and once broken, takes therefrom personal

property.
Breaking the keyhole of the door of a wardrobe, which is locked, is
breaking a locked furniture.

Article 299, subsection (b)l, speaks of, among others, the
breaking of “locked or sealed furniture or receptacle,” not “breaking of
the lock” as argued by appellant. Breaking or destroying the keyhole
of the door of an aparador which was locked is virtually destroying a
“locked furniture.” True indeed, the R.P.C. does not state, as one of
the modes of committing robbery, the “destruction of a keyhole.” But
the destruction of a keyhole of an aparador is itself a destruction of
a locked furniture. Just as one who hurts his finger, hurts his hand.
(People v. Tupaz, et al., CA., 50 O.G. 11249)
When sealed box or receptacle is taken out of the house or building
for the purpose of breaking it outside, it is not necessary that it is
actually opened.

A person who carries away a sealed box or receptacle for the
purpose of breaking the same and taking out its contents outside the
place of robbery is guilty of consummated robbery even though he does
not succeed in opening the box.

The phrase “to be broken or forced open outside” in subdivision
(b), paragraph 2, of Article 299, only indicates the objective element
of the offense.
889

Art. 299

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

It is estafa or theft, if the locked or sealed receptacle is not forced
open in the building where it is kept or taken therefrom to be broken

outside.

A person who opens by force a certain locked or sealed
receptacle which has been confided into his custody and takes the
money contained therein, is guilty of estafa and nor robbery, because
the accused does not commit the act in the house of the offended
party or the accused does not take the receptacle out from the house
of its owner. And it is theft when a locked receptacle is found on the
side of the street and it is forcibly opened and the contents thereof
are taken.
The penalty for robbery with force upon things in inhabited house,
public building or edifice devoted to religious worship depends on
the value of property taken and on whether or not offender is armed.

A bolo is not an arm when used by a servant to open a trunk in his
master’s house.

Thus, a servant who used a bolo in breaking open a trunk then
in the house of his master and took money therefrom was guilty of
robbery committed by an unarmed person. (U.S. v. Saludo, 9 Phil.

213)

890

Art. 300

Weapon carried must not be used to intimidate.

The weapon carried by the offender must not have been used
to intimidate a person, for the reason that once the circumstance of
intimidation enters in the commission of the crime, it is sufficient to
remove the offense from Article 299 and place it within the purview

of Article 294.

Even those without arms are liable to the same penalty.

The liability for carrying arms while robbing an inhabited house
is extended to each of the offenders who take part in the robbery, even
if some of them do not carry arms. (Guevara, citing December Supreme
Court of Spain, October 27, 1882)
Reason why heavier penalty is imposed for robbery in a dwelling
house.

Note that the penal law punishes more severely the robbery in
a house used as a dwelling than that committed in an uninhabited
place, because of the possibility that the inhabitants in the former
might suffer bodily harm during the commission of the robbery. (U.S.
v. Bajet, 25 Phil. 105)

an uninhabited place.
The robbery mentioned in Article 299, if committed in an
uninhabited place and by a band, shall be punished by the maximum

The fact that the robbery with force upon things in inhabited
house or public building or edifice devoted to religious worship was
committed in an uninhabited place and by a band must be alleged in
the information to quality the offense.
The inhabited house, public building, or edifice devoted to religious
worship must be located in an uninhabited place.

paragraph, even if closed, contiguous to the building, and
having direct connection therewith.
The term “public building” includes every building

owned by the Government or belonging to a private person

but used or rented by the Government, although temporarily
unoccupied by the same.

The robbery mentioned in Article 299, is committed in an
inhabited house, public building or edifice devoted to religious
worship. Such house, building or edifice must be located in an
uninhabited place.

Inhabited house.

In the case of U.S. v. Morada, supra, it is said: “In this case, it
does not appear that the house wherein the robbery was perpetrated
was located in an uninhabited place.”

Inhabited house is any shelter, ship or vessel constituting the
dwelling of one or more persons even though the inhabitants thereof
are temporarily absent therefrom when the robbery is committed.
(Art. 301)

Distinction between the two classes of robbery as to their being
qualified.

Robbery in sunken ship.

Robbery with force upon things (Art. 299), in order to be qualified,
must be committed in an uninhabited place and by a band (Art. 300);
while robbery with violence against or intimidation of persons must
be committed in an uninhabited place or by a band. (Art. 295)

A steamship containing silver currency and paper money sank.
The following day, the defendant, discovering the location of the
sunken ship, dived down there, entered the same, and took therefrom
the sum of P15.000, enclosed in sealed boxes. The ship was not yet
abandoned by its owner.

Art. 301. What is an inhabited house, public building, or
building dedicated to religious worship and their dependen¬
cies.
Inhabited house means any shelter, ship, or vessel
constituting the dwelling of one or more persons, even though
the inhabitants thereof shall temporarily be absent therefrom
when the robbery is committed.

All interior courts, corrals, warehouses, granaries,

property.

Is this robbery in an uninhabited place? No. The place is an
inhabited house, although A was absent therefrom when the robbery
took place. (U.S. v. Bajet, 25 Phil. 105)

Orchards and lands used for cultivation, not dependencies.
Orchards and other lands used for cultivation or production are
not included in the term “dependencies' (Art. 301, par. 3)

Art. 301

Notwithstanding the fact that for a period of almost a month, the
house where the robbery was committed was actually uninhabited, it
is still robbery in an inhabited house within the meaning of Articles
299 and 301, because the building in question was ordinarily inhabited
and intended as a dwelling. (People v. Ganir, CA., 51 O.G. 856)
Dependencies, defined.

Dependencies of an inhabited house, public building or building
are all interior courts, corrals,
dedicated to religious worship
warehouses, granaries or inclosed places contiguous to the building
or edifice, having an interior entrance connected therewith, and which
form part of the whole. (Art. 301, par. 2)

—

Note: Three requisites:
(1) Must be contiguous to the building;
(2) Must have an interior entrance connected therewith;
(3) Must form part of the whole.
Thus, if the information alleges that the robbery was committed
in a garage situated in the premises of house No. 1572, General Luna
street, that allegation is not equivalent to a charge that the robbery
was committed in a dependency of an inhabited house, for a garage
may or may not be a dependency of the house. It will be a dependency
of the house if the three requisites mentioned are present.
The place where the robbery was committed was not a
dependency of a public building, because the storeroom where the
property taken was kept does not seem to be a structure contiguous
to the building. (People v. Puzon, et al., CA., 48 O.G. 4878)
Example of a dependency.

A small store located on the ground floor of the house, belonging
to the owner of the store, is a dependency of the house, because the
house and the store form one single whole, there being no partition
between them and that the inmates in going to the main stairway
have to enter the store which has a door. (U.S. v. Ventura, et al., 39
Phil. 523)

Art. 302

Art. 302. Robbery in an uninhabited place or in a private
building. Any robbery committed in an uninhabited place
or in a building other than those mentioned in the first
paragraph of Article 299, if the value of the property taken
exceeds Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000), shall be punished by
prision correccional in its medium and maximum periods,*
provided that any of the following circumstances is present:

—

1. If the entrance has been effected through any
opening not intended for entrance or egress;
2. If any wall, roof, floor, or outside door or window
has been broken;
3. If the entrance has been effected through the use of

false keys, picklocks, or other similar tools;
4. If any door, wardrobe, chest, or any sealed or closed
furniture or receptacle has been broken;

5. If any closed or sealed receptacle, as mentioned in
the preceding paragraph, has been removed, even if the same
be broken open elsewhere.

When the value of the property taken does not exceed
Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000), the penalty next lower in
degree14 shall be imposed.
In the cases specified in Articles 294, 295, 297, 299, 300, and
302 of this Code, when the property taken is mail matter or
large cattle, the offender shall suffer the penalties next higher
in degree than those provided in said articles. (As amended

Although a store may be used as a dwelling, to sustain a
conviction for robbery in an inhabited house, the information must
allege that the store was used and occupied as a dwelling (People v.
Tubog, 49 Phil. 620, 624), otherwise the robbery should be considered
as having been perpetrated in an uninhabited place defined and
penalized under Article 302 of the R.P.C. (People v. Angeles, 14 CA.

That with intent to gain, the offender took therefrom personal
property belonging to another.

The “uninhabited place” is an uninhabited building.

Rep. 946)

Under the term “building” is included any kind of structure used
for storage or safekeeping of personal property, such as (a) freight
car and (b) warehouse. (U.S. v. Magsino, 2 Phil. 710; U.S. v. Roque,
et al., 4 Phil. 242) A pigsty is not a building within the meaning of
Article 302 which refers to habitable buildings.
Entrance through an opening not intended for entrance or egress,
or after breaking a wall, roof, floor, door or window, or through the
use of false keys, picklocks, or other similar tools is not necessary,
if there is breaking of wardrobe, chest, or sealed or closed furniture
or receptacle, or removal thereof to be broken open elsewhere.

The “uninhabited place’ mentioned in Article 302 is a building,
because paragraph Nos. 1and 3 speak of’entrance," which necessarily
refers to a building. Paragraph No. 2 speaks of parts of building.
In U.S. v. Galuran, 12 Phil. 339, it was held that a robbery
committed in a warehouse belonging to the Smith Bell & Co., in the
City of Manila, is one committed in an uninhabited place.
There is an inaccuracy in the English translation of Article
302. Robo en lugar no habitado o edificio particular.
"El robo
cometido en un lugar no habitado o en un edificio que no sea de los
comprendidos en el parrafo primero del articulo 299, x x x.“ (Tomo
26, Leyes Publicas 479) The term “lugar no habitado* is erroneously
translated as “uninhabited place," a term which may be confounded
with the expression “uninhabited place’ in Articles 295 and 300 of
the Revised Penal Code, which is the translation of despoblado and
which is different from the term lugar no habitado in Article 302. The
term lugar no habitado is the antonym of casa habitado (inhabited
house) in Article 299. (People v. Jaranilla, 55 SCRA 563)

The unnailing of a piece of cloth which was nailed over the door
so as to seal it, the customary manner of sealing a freight car, is held
to be breaking by force. (U.S. v. Magsino, 2 Phil. 710)

896

897

—

Paragraph Nos. 4 and 5 of Article 302 do not require that the
offender must have entered the uninhabited building through an
opening not intended for entrance or egress, or after breaking a wall,
roof, floor, door or window, or through the use of false keys, picklocks,
or other similar tools. The word “entrance’ in paragraph Nos. 1 and
3 is not used in said paragraph Nos. 4 and 5. While it is true that
the word “entrance’ is not also used in paragraph No. 2, yet it can be
inferred that entrance is required under that paragraph. (See People
v. Adorno, CA., 40 O.G. 567, cited under Art. 299)

Unnalling of cloth over door of freight car Is breaking by force.

Art. 302

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Criminal Law

Note: Compare this case with the case of People u. Fernandez,
supra; where it was held that the door must be broken.
Breaking padlock Is use of force upon things.

The crime committed by the accused who entered into a
classroom by breaking the padlock of the door and took away a
television, a karaoke and an electric fan is robbery. (Estioca v. People,
GJi. No. 173876, June 27, 2008)

Note: This ruling does not seem to be justified by any of the
paragraphs of Article 302. It cannot be under breaking outside door,
because only the padlock, not the door, was broken. It cannot be under
use of false key, because no false key was used.
Use of fictitious name or pretending the exercise of public authority,
not in this article.

The use of fictitious name or pretending the exercise of public
authority is not a means of entering the building under this article,
because the place is uninhabited and no person could be deceived
thereby.
The receptacle must be “closed” or “sealed.”

The furniture or receptacle here is “sealed or closed.’ In Article
299, it is either "locked or sealed.’

If a person, who had entered a warehouse, opened without
breaking, a closed but not locked chest and took therefrom personal
property, would that be robbery? It would seem that it is theft only,
because paragraph Nos. 4 and 5 use, respectively, the phrases “has
been broken" and “be broken open’ implying that there must be
breaking of the receptacle to constitute robbery.
A receptacle is a container.

Art. 302

Example of robbery in an uninhabited house.

The servant of the owner of an oil mill who takes away the
key of the warehouse and hands it to another, who in turn opens
the warehouse with that key and steals and takes away oil from
the warehouse, is also guilty of robbery in an uninhabited house as
principal by conspiracy.
“If any closed or sealed receptacle has been removed, even if the
same be broken open elsewhere.”

Is the mere removal of closed or sealed receptacle sufficient
under paragraph 5 of Article 302?

It seems that it is not sufficient. Although the phrase, “even if
the same be broken open elsewhere,” does not indicate a condition or
requisite that the closed or sealed receptacle be broken after removing
it, this kind of robbery requires at least an intention to open it by force.
Closed or sealed receptacle removed and broken open elsewhere.

Two persons at night entered the office and store of a corporation,
located at M. de Comillas, Manila. Entrance was effected through the
door, without using force to open it. A closed steel safe was removed
from the building and taken to a place where it was forced open. The
two persons took the contents thereof. The crime committed is robbery
under paragraph 5 of Article 302. (People v. Nuas, CA., 52 O.G. 6264)
Taking of mail matter In any kind of robbery makes the penalty
higher by one degree.

When the property taken is a mail matter during any of the
robbery defined in Articles 294, 295, 297, 299, 300, and 302, the
penalties next higher in degree than those provided in said article
shall be imposed. (Art. 302, last par.)
Taking of large cattle is not punished under the R.P.C.

It would seem that an example of sealed or closed receptacle is
a crate which contains article or merchandise. Thus, the breaking of
a crate containing a television set inside a building at the pier, and
taking its contents, is robbery.

Theft of large cattle is punished under the Anti-Cattle Rustling
Law of 1974, as follows:

898

899

a)

prision mayor in its maximum period to reclusion temporal
in its medium period, if the offense is committed without

b)

reclusion temporal in its maximum period to reclusion

or intimidation of persons or force upon things;

c)

reclusion perpetua to death, if a person is seriously injured
or killed as a result or on the occasion of the commission
of cattle rustling.

3.

Art. 303

If the store is located on the ground floor of the house
belonging to the owner of the store, having an interior entrance
connected therewith, it is a dependency of an inhabited house
and the robbery committed therein is punished under the last
paragraph of Article 299. (U.S. v. Tapan, 20 Phil. 211)
Art. 303. Robbery of cereals, fruits, or firewood in an

suffer the penalty next lower in degree than that prescribed
in said articles.

Thus, if the culprit breaks the door of the garage which is a
dependency of a dwelling house and took from the garage a jeep, the
crime committed is punished under the Anti-Camapping Act with
imprisonment for not less than 20 years and one day but not more
than 30 years. (Sec. 3, par. 2, R.A. No. 10883)

When the robbery described in Articles 299 and 302 consists
in the taking of cereals, fruits, or firewood, the penalty next lower in
degree than that prescribed in said articles shall be imposed.

Penalty is based only on value of property taken.

“In the cases enumerated in Articles 299 and 302."

Note also that the offender's being armed is not important
under this article for the reason that there is no person who can be
injured or killed. This circumstance is important under Article 299
for graduating the penalty, because when the offender is armed, there
is the danger of the inmates being injured or killed.

The penalty next lower in degree shall be imposed for robbery of
cereals, fruits, or firewood, only when the robbery is committed by the
use of force upon things, without violence against or intimidation of
any person, in an inhabited house, public building, or edifice devoted
to religious worship (Art. 299) or in an uninhabited place or private
building (Art. 302).

Robbery in a store — when punishable under Article 299 or under
Article 302.

Thus, even if the offender took from the camarin about 15 sacks
of palay through an opening made on the floor of said camarin, since
the robbery committed with force upon things was accompanied
with violence against or intimidation of persons, Article 303 is not
applicable. The offender should be punished under Article 294.
(Manahan v. People, 73 Phil. 691)

1.

If the store is used as a dwelling of one or more persons, the
robbery committed therein would be considered as committed
in an inhabited house under Article 299. (People v. Suarez,
G.R. No. L-6431, March 29, 1954)

2.

If the store was not actually occupied at the time of the robbery
and was not used as a dwelling, since the owner lived in a
separate house, the robbery committed therein is punished
under Article 302. (People v. Silvestre, CA., 34 O.G. 1535)

Penalty is one degree lower when cereals, fruits, or firewood are
taken in robbery with force upon things.

Cereals are seedlings which are the immediate product of the soil.
The word “cereals" is not the correct translation of the Spanish
words “semilla alimenticia." "Semilla* means seedling which is the

natural product of the soil.
Hence, the taking of sacks of hulled rice does not fall under this
article, but under the penultimate paragraph of Article 302. (People
v. Mesias, 65 Phil. 267)
Palay (the local name for unhulled rice) is“cereal" and is included
in the term “semiUa alimenticia" used in the Spanish text of the R.P.C.,
as it is grain in its original state and, under proper conditions, can and
will germinate into the plant that produces it. The offense charged
in the case at bar, therefore, properly comes under Article 303 of the
R.P.C. and within the original jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace
Court. (People v. Rada, et al., G.R. No. L-16988, December 30, 1961,

there is no showing that the same was kept by the owner as‘seedling’

some personal belongings of A. Is B guilty of robbery? No. The key
which he used in opening the door was not stolen, it having been
entrusted to him. It was not a picklock or similar tool, as defined in
Article 305. It was the key intended by the owner (A) for use in the
lock opened by B.
Example of use of false key.

A proposed to B, a porter of a warehouse, to get some cases of
whisky from the warehouse, offering to pay P16.00 a case. A suggested
to B that he should take an impression of the key of the warehouse

BRIGANDAGE
Brigandage, defined.

Brigandage is a crime committed by more than three armed

by means of force and violence.

three armed persons form a band of robbers for the purpose
of committing robbery in the highway, or kidnapping persons
for the purpose of extortion or to obtain ransom or for any
other purpose to be attained by means of force and violence,
they shall be deemed highway robbers or brigands.
Persons found guilty of this offense shall be punished by
prision mayor in its medium period to reclusion temporal in
its minimum period,1 if the act or acts committed by them are
not punishable by higher penalties, in which case, they shall
suffer such high penalties.

If any of the arms carried by any of said persons be an

in the maximum period. (Art. 306, last paragraph)
The arms carried by the members of the band of robbers may be
any deadly weapon.

Brigandage may be committed without the use of firearms. The
term “armed” as used in the first paragraph of Article 306 covers
arms and weapons in general, not necessarily firearms. (People v. De
la Rosa, et al., CA., 49 O.G. 2863)
Main object of law is to prevent formation of band of robbers.

Must be a band of robbers.

Article 306 mentions“bands of robbers* which is formed by more
than three armed persons.
Hence, a band of dissidents whose purpose is to attain by means
offeree and violence, the destruction of army installations, cannot be
convicted of brigandage. They do not form a band of robbers.

The main object in enacting this law (Art. 306) is to prevent the
formation of such band; in fact, the heart of the offense consists in
the formation of the band by four or more persons conspiring together
for the purpose of robbery in the highway, or kidnapping persons for
extortion or to obtain ransoms, or for any other purpose to be attained
by means of force and violence, and such formation is sufficient to
constitute a violation of the law. (U.S. v. Decusin, et al., 2 Phil. 536)

The existence of any of the purposes mentioned in Article 306 is
sufficient.

The only things to prove are:

It would not be necessary to show, in a prosecution under Article
306, that a member or members of the band actually committed
highway robbery, etc., in order to convict him or them.
The purpose of the band must be (1) to commit robbery in the
highway, or (2) to kidnap persons for the purpose of extortion or
obtaining ransom, or (3) any other purpose to be attained by means
of force and violence.

Evidence that the accused was a member of an armed band
is not sufficient to convict him of brigandage, where there is no
evidence showing that the band was organized for any of the purposes
mentioned in Article 306. (U.S. v. Caneta, 4 Phil. 450)
Presumption of law as to brigandage — all are presumed highway
robbers or brigands, if any of them carries unlicensed firearm.

a.

That there is an organization of more than three armed persons
forming a band of robbers.

b.

That the purpose of the band is any of those enumerated in
Article 306.

c.

That they went upon the highway or roamed upon the country
for that purpose. (See U.S. v. Decusin, et al., supra)

d.

That the accused is a member of such band.

Previous activities considered in determining existence of
brigandage.
When the armed band, previous to kidnapping and taking
personal property of the offended party, had kidnapped and looted

other persons on two other occasions, the band was held to be that
of brigands and liable for brigandage. (People v. Laporeda, et al., 44

If any of the arms carried by any of said persons be an unlicensed
firearm, it shall be presumed that said persons are highway robbers

O.G. 1816)
Note: The previous activities of the armed band were considered,

because they proved the purpose of the band.

Art. 306

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The term “highway” includes city streets.

Philippine Highway refers to any road, street, passage, highway
and bridges or other parts thereof, or railway or railroad within the
Philippines used by persons, or vehicles, or locomotives or trains for
the movement or circulation of persons or transportation of goods,
articles, or property or both. (P.D. No. 532)

Streets within, as well as roads outside the cities are covered by
the word “highway.” Hence, brigandage may be committed in Manila.

Art. 307. Aiding and abetting a band of brigands.

—

Any person knowingly and in any manner aiding, abetting,

or protecting a band of brigands as described in the next
preceding article, or giving them information of the movements
of the police or other peace officers of the Government (or
of the forces of the United States Army, when the latter are
acting in aid of the Government), or acquiring or receiving
the property taken by such brigands, shall be punished by
prision correctional in its medium period to prision mayor in
its minimum period.*

The penalty of prision mayor in its medium period to reclusion
temporal in its minimum period is prescribed for brigandage only.
If the brigands committed robbery with homicide or kidnapping
with a demand for ransom, which is penalized with higher penalty,
they shall be prosecuted for robbery with homicide or kidnapping
and the penalty for the crime actually committed shall be imposed
on them.

It shall be presumed that the person performing any
of the acts provided in this article has performed them
knowingly, unless the contrary is proven.

Brigandage and robbery, distinguished.

Elements:

Both brigandage and robbery in band require that the offenders
form a band of robbers.

1.

That there is a band of brigands.

2.

That the offender knows the band to be of brigands.

In brigandage, the purpose of the offenders is any of the
following: (1) to commit robbery in the highway; or (2) to kidnap
persons for the purpose of extortion or to obtain ransom; or (3) for any
other purpose to be attained by means of force and violence; in robbery
in band, the purpose of the offenders is only to commit robbery, not
necessarily in the highway.

3.

That the offender does any of the following acts:
a. He in any manner aids, abets, or protects such band of

The purpose of brigandage is indiscriminate highway robbery.
If the purpose is only a particular robbery, the crime is only robbery,
or robbery in band if there are at least four armed participants. (U.S.

In brigandage, the mere formation of a band for any of the
purposes mentioned in the law is sufficient, as it would not be
necessary to show that the band actually committed robbery in the

b.

He gives them information of the movements of the police
or other peace officers of the Government; or

c.

He acquires or receives the property taken by such
brigands.

PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NO. 532 (ANTI-PIRACY AND ANTI¬
HIGHWAY ROBBERY LAW OF 1974) MODIFIES ARTICLES 306 AND
207 ON BRIGANDAGE.

Presidential Decree No. 532 is not a modification of Article 267 of
the Revised Penal Code on kidnapping and serious illegal detention,
but of Articles 306 and 307 on brigandage. This is evident from the fact
that the relevant portion thereof which treats of “highway robbery”
invariably uses this term in the alternative and synonymously with
brigandage, that is, as “highway robbery/brigandage.” This is but in
line with our previous ruling, and which still holds sway in criminal
law, that highway robbers (ladrones) and brigands are synonymous.
The purpose of brigandage is, inter alia, indiscriminate highway
robbery. If the purpose is only a particular robbery, the crime is

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 307

only robbery, or robbery in band if there are at least four armed

participants.
Presidential Decree No. 532 punishes as highway robbery
or brigandage only acts of robbery perpetrated by outlaws

indiscriminately against any person or persons on Philippine
highways as defined therein, and not acts of robbery committed
against only a predetermined or particular victim.
The coincidental fact that the robbery was committed inside a
car which, in the natural course of things, was casually operating on
a highway, is not within the situation envisaged by Section 2(e) of
the decree in its definition of terms. Besides, that particular provision
precisely defines “highway robbery/brigandage” and, as we have amply
demonstrated, the single act of robbery conceived and committed
by appellants in this case does not constitute highway robbery or
brigandage. Accordingly, we hold that the offense committed by
appellants is simple robbery defined in Article 293 and punished
under Paragraph 5 of Article 294 of the Revised Penal Code. (People
v. Puno, GJi. No. 97471, February 17, 1993)
Any person who aids or protects highway robbers or abets the
commission of highway robbery or brigandage shall be considered
as an accomplice.

Any person who knowingly and in any manner aids or protects
highway robbers/brigands, such as giving them information about
the movement of police or other peace officers of the government,
or acquires or receives property taken by such brigands or in any
manner derives any benefit therefrom; or any person who directly or
indirectly abets the commission of highway robbery or brigandage,
shall be considered as an accomplice of the principal offenders and
be punished in accordance with the Rules prescribed by the R.P.C.
It shall be presumed that any person who does any of the acts
provided in this Section has performed them knowingly, unless the
contrary is proven.

That said property belongs to another.

Art. 308

Theft, distinguished from robbery.

What distinguishes theft from robbery is that in theft, the
offender does not use violence or intimidation or does not enter a
house or building through any of the means specified in Article 299
or Article 302 in taking personal property of another with intent to
gain.

The prosecution failed to establish that Concepcion used
violence, intimidation or force in snatching Acampado’s shoulder
bag. Acampado herself merely testified that Concepcion snatched
her shoulder bag which was hanging on her left shoulder. Acampado
did not say that Concepcion used violence, intimidation, or force in
snatching her shoulder bag. Given the facts, Concepcion’s snatching
of Acampalo’s shoulder bag constitutes the crime of theft, not robbery.
(People v. Concepcion, G.R. No. 200922, July 18, 2012)

intimidation of persons was employed. Hence, Article 294 of the
Revised Penal Code cannot be invoked. Neither could such taking
fall under Article 299 of the Revised Penal Code which penalizes
robbery in an inhabited house (casa habitada), public building, or
edifice devoted to worship. The coop was not inside Bayion’s house.
Nor was it is dependency thereof within the meaning of Article 301
of the R.P.C. (People v. Jaranilla, 55 SCRA 563)

When is taking complete so that the theft is consummated?
Intent to gain or animus lucrandi is an internal act that is
presumed from the unlawful taking by the offender of the thing subject
of asportation. Although proof as to motive for the crime is essential
when the evidence of the theft is circumstantial, the intent to gain
is the usual motive to be presumed from all furtive taking of useful
property appertaining to another, unless special circumstances reveal
a different intent on the part of the perpetrator. As to the concept of
“taking” -

Art 308

Meaning of “taking” in theft.

In theft, the taking away or carrying away of personal property
of another is not required as in larceny in common law. (People v.
Mercado, 65 Phil. 665) Note the phrase used in Article 308, which
is, “shall take personal property of another”
not shall take away
such property.

—

The theft was consummated when the culprits were able to
take possession of the thing taken by them. It is not an indispensable
element of theft that the thief carry, more or less far away, the thing
taken by him from its owner. (People v. Jaranilla, 55 SCRA 563)
People v. Naval, et al.
(46 O.G. 2641)
Facts: While the truck loaded with bed sheets was en route to its
destination, the accused dumped one of the boxes, containing 120
bed
sheets, on the ground, whereupon they were immediately
arrested by a plain
clothesman who was with them on the truck, pretending to be a laborer.
It is contended by the accused that the crime of theft
was not
consummated. It is urged that the first essential element of the crime of theft
is that the property be actually taken away by the thief or
that the thief must
have obtained, at some particular moment, the complete, independent
and
absolute possession and control of the thing desired, adverse
to the right of
the owner or lawful possessor thereof.
Held: In a juridical sense, the consummation of the crime of
theft takes
place upon the voluntary and malicious taking
of the property belonging to
another which is realized by the material occupation of
the thing whereby the
thief places it under his control and in such a
situation
as he could dispose
of it at once.

Note: This ruling applies also to the meaning
with violence against or intimidation of any person. of ‘taking" in robbery

914

Art. 308

The only requirement for a personal property to be the object
of theft under the penal code is that it be capable of appropriation.
It need not be capable of “asportation," which is defined as “carrying
away.” Jurisprudence is settled that to “take” under the theft provision
of the penal code does not require asportation or carrying away. To
appropriate means to deprive the lawful owner of the thing. The
word “take” in the Revised Penal Code includes any act intended to
transfer possession which x x x may be committed through the use
of the offenders’ own hands, as well as any mechanical device x x x.
(Medina v. People, G.R. No. 182648, June 17, 2105; Laurel v. Judge
Abrogar, et al., 596 Phil. 57-58 [2009])

Illustrations:
1.

While the accused was behind the offended party, in the midst
of a crowd in front of the public market, he abstracted from
the pocket of the trousers of the offended party, a pocketbook
containing P12.00. The accused already had the pocketbook,
when the offended party perceived the theft, caught hold
of the accused’s shirt-front, at the same time shouting for a
policeman; after a struggle he recovered his pocketbook and let
go of the accused, who was afterwards caught by a policeman.

It was held that the contention that these facts only
constitute the crime of frustrated, and not consummated, theft
is groundless. The accused succeeded in taking the pocketbook,
and that determines the crime of theft. (People v. Sobrevilla, 53
Phil. 227)

The defendant took from a chest a sum of money belonging
to the offended party and then placed it over the cover of the
chest. At the moment, he was caught by two guards.
915

Art. 308

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Held: The defendant having materially taken possession
of the money from the moment he took it from the place where
it had been, and having taken it with his hands with intent
to appropriate the same, he executed all the acts necessary to
constitute the crime which was thereby produced. On the act of
making use of the money was frustrated, which, however, does
not go to make the elements of consummated theft. (Decision of
the Supreme Court of Spain, June 13, 1882)
When the place is surrounded by a fence or wall and one has to
pass to check point before going out, is the taking complete before
passing through the check point?

A truck loaded with stolen boxes of rifles was on the way out
of the check point in South Harbor surrounded by a tall fence when
an MP guard discovered the boxes on the truck. It was held that the
crime committed was frustrated theft, because of the timely discovery
of the boxes on the truck before it could pass out of the check point.
(People v. Dino, CA., 45 O.G. 3446)
In the Supply Depot at Quezon City, the accused removed from
the pile nine pieces of hospital linen and took them to their truck
where they were found by a corporal of the MP guards when they
tried to pass through the check point. It was held that the crime
committed was consummated theft. (People v. Espiritu, et al., CA.G.R. No. 2107-R, May 31, 1949)
Espiritu and Dlfio cases, distinguished.

In the Espiritu case, it was held that the crime of theft was
consummated because the thieves were able to take or get hold of
the hospital linen and that the only thing that was frustrated, which
does not constitute any element of theft, is the use or benefit that the
thieves expected to derive from the commission of the offense.
In the Dino case, it was held that the crime committed is that
of frustrated theft, because the fact determinative
of
in the crime of theft is the ability of the offender consummation
to dispose freely
of the articles stolen, even if it were more or
less momentarily. The
Court of Appeals followed the opinion of Viada in this case. (See 5
Viada, 103)

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 308

In People v. Flores, CA., 62 O.G. 2644, there was no substantial
variance between the circumstances in the case and those in the cited
case of People v. Dino. It was held:
[The Court] cannot bring ourselves to agree in the appellee’s
contention that the crime was consummated. The “traditional
ruling” cited by the appellee is qualified by the words “is placed
in a situation where he could dispose of its contents at once.”
Obviously, while the truck and the van were still within the
compound, the appellant could not have disposed of the goods
“at once.” This is entirely different from the case where a much
less bulky and more common thing as money was the object of
the crime, where freedom to dispose or make use of it is palpably

less restricted. (People v. Flores, CA., 62 O.G. 2644)

THERE IS NO CRIME OF FRUSTRATED THEFT.

The Supreme Court has held that there is no crime of frustrated
theft, thereby declining to adopt the Dino and Flores ruling in this
jurisdiction.
The accused were sighted outside a supermarket by a security
guard hauling a pushcart with cases of detergents and thereafter
loading said cases of detergents in a taxi. When the taxi was stopped
by a security guard who asked the accused for a receipt for the
merchandise, the accused fled on foot but were apprehended and the
stolen merchandise were recovered. The Supreme Court held that
the crime committed was consummated theft.

It was held that the ability of the offender to freely dispose
of the property stolen is not a constitutive element of the crime of
theft. It finds no support or extension in Article 308, whether as a
descriptive or operative element of theft or as the mens rea or actus
reus of the felony.

For the purpose of ascertaining whether theft is susceptible of
commission in the frustrated stage, the question is again, when is the
crime of theft produced? There would be all but certain unanimity
in the position that theft is produced when there is deprivation of
personal property due to its taking by one with intent to gain. Viewed
from that perspective, it is immaterial to the product of the felony
that the offender, once having committed all the acts of execution for

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

theft, is able or unable to freely dispose of the property stolen since
the deprivation from the owner alone has already ensued from such
acts of execution.

the intention of placing the property taken under his control and of
making himself the owner thereof.

Art. 308

It might be argued, that the ability of the offender to freely
dispose of the property stolen delves into the concept of “taking” itself,
in that there could be no true taking until the actor obtains such
degree of control over the stolen item. But even if this were correct,
the effect would be to downgrade the crime to its attempted, and not
frustrated stage, for it would mean that not all the acts of execution
have not been completed, the “taking not having been accomplished.”
[The Court is] satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the taking
by the petitioner was completed in this case. With intent to gain,
he acquired physical possession of the stolen cases of detergent for
a considerable period of time that he was able to drop these off at a
spot in the parking lot, and long enough to load these onto a taxicab.

Indeed, [the] [Court] ha[s], after all, held that unlawful taking,
or apoderam iento, is deemed complete from the moment the offender
gains possession of the thing, even if he has no opportunity to dispose
of the same. (People v. Obillo, 411 Phil. 139, 150 [2001]; People v.
Bernabe, 448 Phil. 269, 280 [2003]; People u. Bustinera, G.R. No.
148233, June 8, 2004)

Insofar as [the Court] consider[s] the present question,“unlawful
taking’ is most material in this respect. Unlawful taking, which is
the deprivation of one’s personal property, is the element which
produces the felony in its consummated stage. At the same time,
without unlawful taking as an act of execution, the offense could only
be attempted theft, if at all.

Art. 308

There Is “taking” even if the offender received the thing from the

offended party.
The unlawful taking may occur at or soon after the transfer
of physical possession (not juridical possession) of the thing to the
offender. The actual transfer of possession may not always and by
itself constitute the unlawful taking, but an act done soon thereafter
by the offender which may result in unlawful taking or asportation.
In such case, the article is deemed to have been taken also, although
in the beginning, it was in fact given to, and received by, the offender.
(People v. Roxas, CA., 63 O.G. 716, citing Supreme Court decisions)

Illustration:
The accused, Nieves de Vera, received from an Igorot named
Pepe, a bar of gold for the purpose of having it examined by a
goldsmith, and P200.00 in bank notes to have them changed into
silver coins, and thereafter appropriated said bar of gold and notes
with intent to gain and without the consent of the owner thereof.

Held: That the accused is guilty of the crime of theft. (U.S. v.
De Vera, 43 Phil. 1000)

Note: Although the accused received the bar of gold and notes
from the owner thereof, her subsequent felonious conversion of them
related back to the time she received them, so that the bar of gold
and notes are deemed to have been unlawfully taken by the accused.

In the case of People v. Rico, supra, the decision of the Supreme
Court of Spain on November 28, 1903, is cited as to the meaning of
the term “apoderar’ or “apoderarse," that is, the offender must have

But if the accused received the thing from another person in trust
or on commission, or for administration, or under a quasi contract or
a contract of bailment, and later misappropriated or converted the
thing to the prejudice of another, the crime committed is not theft,
but estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b), because under any of
those transactions, the juridical possession of the thing is transferred
to the offender.
In the case of U.S. v. De Vera, supra, the accused, not having
received them in trust, or on commission, or for administration, or
under a quasi-contract, did not have juridical possession of the bar of
gold and bank notes. She had only the physical or material possession
thereof. Hence, she was guilty of theft.

918

919

With these considerations, [the Court] can only conclude that
under Article 308 of the R.P.C., theft cannot have a frustrated stage.
Theft can only be attempted or consummated. (Valenzuela v. People
et al., G.R. No. 160188, June 21, 2007)
The offender must have the intention of making himself the owner
of the thing taken.

The wife who delivers to the husband, property in her lawful
possession as depositary or pledgee, without the knowledge and
consent of the owner, might be guilty of a violation of the contract of
deposit or pledge; but the husband who pawns the property and uses
the proceeds thereof to settle his obligations, as per understanding
with the wife, is not guilty of theft although he knew that the property
did not belong to his wife, because there was no taking or abstracting
of the article from the owner, the taking and abstracting being what
constitute the crime of theft. (People v. De los Reyes, CA.., 60 O.G.
5175, citing the case of U.S. v. Reyes, 6 Phil. 441)

Art. 308

Note: The Court of Appeals held that there waa only civil liability

Personal property.

Personal property as an element of theft includes electricity
and gas because electricity, the same as gas, is a valuable article
of merchandise bought and sold like other personal property and
is capable of appropriation by another. (U.S. v. Carlos, 21 Phil.
553; U.S. v. Tambunting, 41 Phil. 364) The business of providing
telecommunication and telephone service is personal property under
Article 308, and the act of engaging in International Simple Resale
(ISR), which is a method of routing and completing international long
distance calls using lines, cables, antennae, and/or air wave frequency
which connect directly to the local or domestic exchange facilities
of the country where the call is destined is an act of subtraction
penalized under said article. (Laurel v. Abrogar, G.R. No. 155076,
February 27, 2006)

A meter reader of the Manila Electric Company who, in
consideration of money, knowingly misread the electric meter of a
consumer and this enabled the latter to appropriate 11,880 kilowatts
of electric current, without paying for it, is guilty of theft. The
resulting situation does not materially differ from the consumer who
used a jumper” to deflect the current from the house electric meter.

Theft of Checks.

Payable to Cash.

Fund collections through checks payments— all issued payable
to cash— are personal properties belonging to UCC. These funds
through checks were paid by UCC clients for the deliveries of cement
from UCC. When accused-appellant, as Branch Manager of UCC
who was authorized to receive payments, received them in the form
of “Pay to Cash” checks from UCC customers, he was obliged to turn
them over to UCC for he had no right to retain them. That he kept
the checks and deposited them in his account and in the accounts of
Magno Lim knowing all the while that these checks and their proceeds
were not his only proves the presence of unlawful taking. (People u.
Mirto, G.R. No. 193479, October 19, 2011)
(2)

Payable to Order

Accused allege that there was no crime committed considering
the finding that the checks were of no commercial value. It is of
no moment that there was real or actual gain. The important
consideration is that there was an intent to gain. It is one of the
essential elements of theft. (People v. Seranilla, L-54090, May 9,
1988)

Dishonored Check

The taking of a dishonored check is an impossible crime. As of
the time that petitioner took possession of the check meant for Mega

G.R. No. 162540, July 13, 2009)

Art. 308

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

That the property belongs to another.

The subject of the crime of theft is any personal property
belonging to another. Hence, as long as the property taken does not
belong to the accused who has a valid claim thereover, it is immaterial
whether said offender stole it from the owner, a mere possessor, or
even a thief of the property. (Miranda v. People, G.R. No. 176298,
January 25, 2012)
Thus, he who takes away the property pledged by him to another,
without the latter’s consent, does not commit theft, but estafa, for he
is the owner of the thing taken by him.
Selling the share of a partner or joint owner is not theft

His unlawful disposition of the share belonging to his partner
or joint owner was undoubtedly a violation of their contract and a
trespass upon the rights of another but not an act constituting the
crime of theft. (U.S. v. Reyes, 6 Phil. 441)

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 308

Held: The fact that the accused are entitled to separation pay
under Section 1 of R.A. No. 1052, as amended, and have agreed
to receive P120.00 each as separation pay, did not automatically

vest ownership of the money in them for lack of proper delivery.
The signing of the separation papers was a condition which the
employer intended to impose before making delivery. Hence, when
the accused took the money without signing the papers, they were
taking something which did not belong to them. (People v. De Jesus,
et al., CA., 59 O.G. 6658)
Note: The accused denied on the stand that they took the money.
The denial of the accused that they took the money, when in fact they
did, is enough proof that the act of taking was done with intent to
gain, and not for the purpose of applying the money to their claim
for separation pay.
Ownership not transferred before goods are weighed or measured.

Note: Before the dissolution of the partnership or the division
of the property held in common, no part of the property of the

or co-owner.

In the sale of goods, which are usually tried, measured or
weighed, if, after the sale but before the measuring or weighing, a
part of the goods covered by the contract is taken by the purchaser,

not effected.

The three accused were notified by their employer of the
termination of their services with separation pay of P120.00 each. In
his office, the employer placed three envelopes containing P120.00
each on top of his desk. The employer coughed and left to expectorate
and, while expectorating, one of the accused took the three envelopes
and gave his co-accused one envelope each. When the employer
returned and found that the envelopes were already in the possession
of the accused, he told the accused that they could not leave with the
money without first signing the separation papers showing receipt
of the money. The accused refused to sign. The employer went out to
call a police officer, and when he returned, the accused were already
gone. Prosecuted for theft, the accused maintained that an element
of the crime, i.e., that the property taken belongs to another, is not
present, claiming that the money belonged to them.

922

Intent to gain.

Intent togain is presumed from the unlawful taking of personal
property belonging to another.
But if a person takes personal property from another believing
it to be his own, the presumption of intent to gain is rebutted and,
therefore, he is not guilty of theft. (U.S. v. Viera, 1 Phil. 584)
One who takes personal property openly and avowedly under
claim of title made in good faith is not guilty of theft even though the
claim of ownership is later found to be untenable. (People v. Lozada,
CA.-G.R. No. 3147-R, December 21, 1949)

cultivated by the complainant who had been adjudged the owner
of said land in a civil case brought by the accused against him, the

accused was not acting in good faith and, hence, he was guilty of theft.
(U.S. v. Villacorta, 30 Phil. 108)
Satisfaction and pleasure derived from the act of giving to
another what had been stolen is a real gain.
Defendant took and carried away some building materials
without the owner’s knowledge and consent and gave them to another

It is not necessary that there was real or actual gain on the part
of the offender or that he removed the stolen animals in order to make

consent freely given and not to one which may only be inferred

Is there intent to gain when the employee took the papers of his
employer and delivered them to the government investigators as
an act of revenge?

By the word gain is meant not only the acquisition of a thing
useful to the purpose of life but also the benefit which in any other
use may be derived or expected from the act which is performed.

In the case at bar, where the accused took the books, papers and
documents from the files of his employer and then delivered them
to the Committee on Good Government, House of Representatives,
with which he filed charges of tax evasion and bigamy against his
employer, he undoubtedly acted with intent to gain, for he derived
therefrom the utility of presenting them as evidence, the satisfaction
of taking revenge against his employer, and the pleasure of seeing his
said employer being harassed by government investigators. (People
v. Padilla, CA„ 61 O.G. 2027)
Dissenting:

Animo lucrandi means, as Viada says, “uno oil codicia” and not
“un sentimiento de odio o de venganza.” (Viada, 6:221, 5.a edicion)
Since the jurisprudence cited by the majority, namely, People v.
Fernandez and People v. Martisano, supra, involves cases where the
accused took the thing, object of the crime, for the satisfaction of
his oil codicia,” it cannot be considered an authority in the present
case, where the appellant, by his act of delivering the records to the
Committee on Good Government to convince that Committee that
said records would reveal complainant’s tax evasion, demonstrated
that his intention was not to satisfy his greed but to take revenge
against the complainant.
924

The consent contemplated in this element of theft refers to

from mere lack of opposition on the part of the owner of the property

taken.
Thus, the accused, who picked the pocket of the offended party
while the latter was hearing mass in a church and the latter, on
account of the solemnity of the act, although noticing the theft, did
not do anything to prevent it, took the money of the offended party
without his consent. (Decision of the Supreme Court of Spain, December

1, 1897)

Note: The law does not say without the knowledge of the owner
of the thing taken. Hence, even if the owner knew the taking, but he
did not consent to it, the accused is still liable for theft.
Allegation of owner’s lack of consent cannot be dispensed with in
charging an ordinary theft.

In the ordinary course of events, the owner of the thing (whoever
he should be) would not consent to the taking of his property
without any consideration or quid pro quo therefor; nevertheless,
the possibility of such consent remains and the law demands that it
be negated in the information. That the owner’s lack of consent can
not be dispensed with in charging an ordinary theft under the first
paragraph of Article 308 of the Penal Code, is shown by the express
requirement therein that the taking should be without the consent
of the owner. In view of the clear text of the law, an information or
charge that does not aver this lack of consent is manifestly bad and
insufficient, and may be quashed for failure to allege an essential
element of the deficit. (Pua Yi Kun v. People, G.R. No. L-26256, June
26, 1968)

925

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

There is no theft when the taking of personal property is with the
consent of its owner.
A felonious taking is necessary in the crime of larceny and,
generally speaking, a taking which is done with the consent or
acquiescence of the owner of the property is not felonious. (People v.
Trinidad, 50 Phil. 65) Thus, an individual who took possession of the
cattle in the presence of the cattleman charged with the care thereof,
without any opposition or protest on his part, is not guilty of the
crime of theft inasmuch as he took the animal with the knowledge of

use of violence or force upon the person of the victim nor force upon
anything. Considering that the victim was already heavily wounded
when his personal properties were taken, there was no need to employ
violence against or intimidation upon his person. Accused-appellant,
can only be held guilty of the separate offense of theft. (People v.
Basao, G.R. No. 128286, July 20, 1999)

Art. 308

the person presumed to be the owner. (U.S. v. Dacanay, 8 Phil. 617)

Robbery and theft compared.

For robbery to exist, it is necessary that there should be a taking
against the will of the owner; and for theft (robber), it sufficed that
consent on the part of the owner is lacking. (People v. Chan Wat, 49
Phil. 116)
The taking of personal property belonging to another must be
accomplished without violence against or intimidation of person.

A picked the pocket of B and, having taken B’s wallet, A walked
away. B felt that his wallet was gone. He looked around and saw A
just a few meters away. B approached A and asked for his wallet. A
threatened B with bodily harm, boxed the latter, and ran away. Is the
crime committed by A theft or robbery? It is theft, because the taking
of the wallet of B by A was already complete when A used violence
against and intimidation of B.
The rule is different when the violence used resulted in homicide,
rape, intentional mutilation, or serious physical injuries defined in
paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 263. In any of such cases, the crime
is robbery complexed with one of such crimes, even if the taking of
the personal property was already complete when the violence was
employed.

Art. 308

ft is not robbery when violence is for a reason entirely foreign to
the fact of taking.

A constabulary officer, suspecting that B had concealed and
aided a band of robbers, tied B in his house as a punishment. Several
hours later, he took the money with intent to gain from an open
drawer of B.

Is this theft or robbery?
Held-. The fact that the owner of the money was tied at the time
the money was taken cannot be considered as violence for the purpose
of classifying the crime as robbery. The offended party was tied for
some hours previously for a reason entirely foreign to the act of taking
the money. (U.S. v. Birueda, 4 Phil. 229)

Force upon things in theft

Unless the force upon things is employed to enter a building,
the taking of the personal property belonging to another with intent
to gain is theft and not robbery.
Thus, if A entered the house of B through an open door and once
inside he removed by force, toilet fixtures and carried them away, A
is liable for theft in spite of the use of force upon things, because the
force was not employed to enter the house.

When no force or violence was employed in the taking, as victim
was already heavily wounded.

The only case where the taking of personal property with force
upon things is robbery, even if the culprit did not enter the house or
building with force upon things, is when a furniture, chest, or other
locked or sealed receptacle is broken in the house or building or taken
therefrom and broken outside.

In this case, the personal properties were taken after accused¬
appellant had already successfully carried out his primary criminal
intent of killing the victim and the taking did not necessitate the

the accused took the personal property under a bona fide belief that he
owns the property. (Gaviola u. People, 516 Phil. 228, 237(2006])

Art. 308

Presumption as to possession of stolen property.

When a person has in possession, part of the recently stolen
property, he is presumed to be the thief of all, in the absence of
satisfactory explanation of his possession. (U.S. v. Ungal, 37 Phil.
835)

Note: The rule stated in this case applies only when all the
goods were lost at the same time, in the same place, and on the same
occasion. It does not apply where the things disappeared piece by
piece, at different times and on different occasions, and only a part
of them was found in the possession of the accused, in the absence
of proof that he had the opportunity to take the rest at other times.
When the stolen property is not found in the possession of the
accused, his prior possession may be proved by circumstantial or
direct evidence of his disposal of the property (36 C.J. 895, 896),
in which case the presumption attaches to him. The presumption
regarding possession of stolen property does not exclusively refer to
actual physical possession thereof but may include prior unexplained
possession. (People v. Tanaotanao, 2 C-A. Rep. 797)

Note: It is required that the property be recently stolen. Hence, if
the property was stolen a long time ago, the presumption does not lie.
The presumption does not arise in this case.

When all the recently stolen effects, like carabaos in this case,
have been found and recovered, one in the possession of the accused
and another in the pasture, untied, the presumption cannot rise, as
it lacks basis. It is not reasonable to believe that the accused had
retained one in their possession and freed the other in the pasture.
(People v. Beltran, et al., CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 11, 153)
Presumption on intent to steal, rebutted.

The intent to steal is presumed from the taking of personal
property without the consent of the owner or its lawful possessor. As
in all presumptions, this may be rebutted by evidence showing that

Art. 308

The Igdalinos had been cultivating and harvesting the fruits
of the coconut trees from the plantation since the time of their
predecessor, Narciso. Narciso, in turn, had been cultivating and
harvesting said coconut trees from the same plantation since Rosita
was still a child. The harvesting of the coconuts were made by the
Igdalinos openly and notoriously, as testified to by the other barangay
residents. The Igdalinos’ open and notorious harvesting of coconuts
was made under their belief that they, in fact, owned the land where
the plantation is situated. This belief is honest and in good faith
considering that they held, in their favor, OCT No. 1068 covering
the disputed land under Narciso’s name. This honest belief was not
tarred by the adjudication in Avertino’s favor of the civil case for
quieting of title over the same land. Knowledge that the land was
finally adjudicated in favor of Avertino came to the Igdalinos only
when Rosita inquired from the Register of Deeds in 2002, or long after
the complained harvest was made. Neither was there any showing
that the civil court had already rendered a final decision in Avertino’s
favor at the time the coconuts were harvested by the Igdalinos. All
these tend to show that the Igdalinos' claim of ownership over the
disputed land is bona fide. In sum, the prosecution failed to establish
the elements of unlawful taking and thus, reasonable doubt persists.

Finder of lost property (Paragraph No. 1, Art 308).

Perez, who had in his possession the sum of P150.00 in paper
money, hurried to the ticket window of a railroad station, at the
same time drawing out from his watch-pocket P2.00 to buy a ticket.
Unnoticed by him, the bundle of money bills dropped at his feet. The
accused, a woman, who was passing by at that moment, picked up
the bundle of bills, and, hastily concealing said bundle, moved on up
the platform. After Perez had returned from the ticket window, the
accused approached him and handed P30.00 in bills, saying that was
the money he had dropped. She kept the rest of the money.
Held: The accused is guilty of theft as a finder of lost property
who retained part of it with intent to gain. (U.S. v. Santiago, 27 Phil.
483)
929

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

The term "lost property” embraces loss by stealing.
The accused was charged with having found and “kept in his
possession one male horse x x x belonging to Felix Muertigue, said
accused knowing x x x that the horse was stolen x x x and deliberately

give it to C, the owner thereof. B did not give it to C and appropriated
it.

Art. 308

failed x x x to deliver the same to the authorities or to its owner.”
Appellee contends that since the complaint refers to a stolen
horse, it does not fall under paragraph No. 1 of Article 308, “stolen
property” not being the same as “lost property.” The argument is
without merit. The word “lost” is generic in nature, and embraces loss
by stealing or by any act of a person other than the owner, as well as
by the act of the owner himself or through some casual occurrence.
If anything, the finder who fails deliberately to return the thing lost
may be considered more blameworthy if the loss was by stealing than
through some other means. (People v. Rodrigo, 16 SCRA 475)

How to prove this kind of theft.

It is necessary to prove:
The time of the seizure of the thing;
(2) That it was a lost property belonging to another; and
(3) That the accused having had the opportunity to return
or deliver the lost property to its owner or to the local
authorities, refrained from doing so. (People v. Jerusalem,
CA., 43 O.G. 1253)

Art. 308

Held: B is liable for theft, because although B is not a finder in

fact, he is a finder in law.

The finder (A) acquires physical custody only and does not
become vested with the legal possession of the thing.
The person (B) to whom it was confided for delivery to its owner
assumes, by voluntary substitution, as to both the property and its
owner, the place occupied by the finder. (People v. Avila, 44 Phil. 720)
The gist of this offense is the furtive taking and misappropriation
of the property found. (People v. Avila, supra)

Note: The finder of lost property has only the physical possession
of the property. The person who received it from the finder cannot
have juridical possession of the property. The spring cannot rise above
its source. Hence, the policeman in the case of People v. Avila, supra,
cannot be held liable for estafa.

(1)

Delay in the delivery of lost property to the local authorities Is
immaterial, when the finder surrendered it voluntarily to the owner
when the latter came to his house to get It.

Thus, in a case where a rig driver, who found on the road a
valise containing clothes and other articles, failed to deliver it to the
authorities for 4 1/2 days after finding it, it was held that he was not
guilty of theft under paragraph No. 1 of Article 308, it appearing that
he surrendered the valise with all its contents to the owner when the
latter came to his house to get it. (People v. Carani,CA., 1943 O.G. 60)

Paragraph No. 1 of Article 308 not limited to actual finder.

A found in his carretela a purse containing money and jewelry
left by a passenger. A delivered it to B, a policeman, with a request to
930

The law does not require knowledge of the owner of the lost
property.

Due to a strong typhoon, a wooden chest containing money,
jewelry, clothing and other personal property, was washed away by
the flood. It was found by the accused. He took its contents.
Held: As long as the accused knew or had reason to know that
the property was lost, it was his duty to turn it over to the authorities,
regardless of whether or not he knew who was the owner of the lost
property. The Revised Penal Code does not require knowledge of the
owner of the lost property. (People v. Panotes, et al., CA., 36 O.G.
1008; People v. Silverio, CA., 43 O.G. 2205)

Intent to gain is Inferred from deliberate failure to deliver the lost
property to the proper person.

In this kind of theft, intent to gain is inferred from the deliberate
failure to deliver the lost property to the proper person, the finder
knowing that the property does not belong to him. (People v. Rodrigo,

What evidence of value of property is not proven.

Merida v. People, 554 SCRA 366, 382, instructs that to prove
the amount of the property taken for fixing the penalty imposable
against the accused under Article 303 of the Revised Penal Code,
the prosecution must present more than a mere uncorroborated
“estimate. In the absence of independent and reliable corroboration
of such estimate, the courts may either apply the minimum penalty
under Article 309 or fix the value of the property taken based on the
attendant circumstances of the case. (People v. Anabe, 630 SCRA
10, 21)
The court may take judicial notice of the value of the goods which
are matters of public knowledge or are capable of unquestionable
demonstration.

SEC. 2. Rule 129 of the Rules of Court provides:

—

SEC. 2. Judicial notice, when discretionary. A court may
take judicial notice of matters which are of public knowledge,
or are capable of unquestionable demonstration, or ought to be
known to judges because of their judicial functions.
The imposable penalty for the crime of qualified theft depends
upon the value of the thing stolen. To prove the value of the stolen
property for purposes of fixing the imposable penalty under Articles
309 and 310 of the RPC, as amended, the Court explained in People
v. Anabe, 630 SCRA 10, 21, that the prosecution must present more
than a mere uncorroborated “estimate.” In the absence of independent
and reliable corroboration of such estimate, the courts may either
apply the minimum penalty under Article 309 or fix the value of the

In this case, Candelaria has been found guilty of stealing diesel
fuel. The value of diesel fuel may be readily gathered from price
lists published by the Department of Energy (DOE). In this regard,
the value of diesel fuel involved herein may then be considered
as a matter of public knowledge which falls within the purview of
the rules on discretionary judicial notice. While it is true that the
prosecution had only presented the uncorroborated testimony of
the private complainant to prove that the value of the diesel fuel

that the pump price of diesel fuel in August 2006 (i.e., the time of
the commission of the crime) is within the range of P37.60 to P37.86
nonetheless remains satisfied that such amount must
per liter
be sustained. As the value of the goods may independently and
competently be ascertained from the DOE’s price publication, the
Court, notwithstanding the solitary evidence of the prosecution,
makes this determination following the second prong set by case
law and that is, to fix the value of the property taken based on the
attendant circumstances of the case. (Candelaria v. People, G.R. No.

punished by the penalties next higher by two degrees than
those respectively specified in the next preceding article,
if committed by a domestic servant, or with grave abuse of
confidence, or if the property stolen is motor vehicle, mail
matter or large cattle or consists of coconuts taken from the
premises of a plantation, fish taken from a fishpond or fishery
or if property is taken on the occasion of fire, earthquake,
typhoon, volcanic eruption, or any other calamity, vehicular
accident or civil disturbance. (As amended by B.P. Big. 71,
approved May 1, 1980)

Penalty Is two degrees higher.
The penalties for qualified theft are now next higher by two
degrees than those respectively specified in the next preceding article.
(Art. 310, as amended)

Theft by domestic servant Is always qualified.
When the offender is a domestic servant, it is not necessary to
show that he committed the crime with grave abuse of confidence.
The phrase “with grave abuse of confidence” is separated by the word
“or" from the term “domestic servant” in Article 310.
Theft by a domestic servant is illustrated in the case of a
houseboy who stole P42.50 belonging to his master. (People v.
Evangelista, 70 Phil. 122)

The abuse of confidence must be grave.
Note the word “grave" describing “abuse of confidence" in
the second kind of qualified theft. There must be allegation in

the information and proof of a relation, by reason of dependence,
guardianship, or vigilance, between the accused and the offended
party, that has created a high degree of confidence between them,
which the accused abused. ("See People v. Koc Song, 63 Phil. 369)
An example of theft committed with grave abuse of confidence is
that where the accused who was permitted to sleep in the house of the
offended party out of charity, stole the latter’s money in that house.
(Mariano v. People, 68 Phil. 724, People v. Lingat, 40 O.G., Supp. 3, 7)

complainant did not repose on Viray “confidence” that the latter could
have abused to commit qualified theft. The very fact that petitioner
“forced open” the main door and screen because he was denied access
to complainant’s house negates the presence of such confidence in him
by complainant. Without ready access to the interior of the house and
the properties that were the subject of the taking, it cannot be said
that complainant had a “firm trust” on petitioner or that she “relied
on his discretion” and that the same trust reposed on him facilitated
Viray’s taking of the personal properties justifying his conviction of
qualified theft. He is only liable for simple theft. (Viray v. People, G.R.
No. 205180, November 11, 2013)

Art. 310

The fact that the accused was living in the house of the offended
party, who had sheltered him out of charity, when he took the money
belonging to his protector, aggravates the crime committed by him,
inasmuch as he gravely abused the confidence which the owner of
the house reposed in him upon permitting him, out of charity, to live
therein, stifling the sentiment of gratitude awakened in his bosom
by his benefactor’s charitable act. It is not necessary that the accused
asked for shelter for charity’s sake. The grave abuse of confidence
need not be premeditated. Its presence in the commission of theft is
sufficient. (People u. Syou Hu, 65 Phil. 270)

Theft by housemate is not always qualified.
But theft by housemate is not always qualified, because while
this fact constitutes a certain abuse of confidence, since Living together
under the same roof engenders some confidence, it is not necessarily
grave. (People v. Koc Song, 63 Phil. 369)

Where the accused did not act with grave abuse of confidence.

The fact of living together in the same house may be accidental
and the goods stolen might not have been entrusted to the custody or
vigilance of the accused. (People v. De la Cruz, 82 Phil. 388)

Where the accused had taken advantage of his position in
committing the crime of theft but did not act with grave abuse of
confidence because his employer had never given him the possession
of the machines involved or allowed him to take hold of them, and it
does not appear that the former had any special confidence in him,
the accused cannot be convicted of qualified theft. (People u. Maglaya,

Theft by laborer is not qualified theft.
The mere circumstance that the accused worked as a laborer in
the place where the theft was committed, does not suffice to create
the relation of confidence and intimacy that the law requires. Theft
by laborer is only simple theft. (People v. Celis, 76 Phil. 369)

30 SCRA 606)
Simple theft, not qualified theft when there was no confidence
reposed on the accused.

Accused was the caretaker of complainant’s pets. Before leaving
her house, complainant locked the doors and left the accused to

of jewelry, one Gameboy, one CD player, one Nokia cell phone, and a
jacket missing. Complainant immediately checked her premises and
discovered that the main doors of her house were destroyed. A plastic
bag was also found on top of her stereo which contained a t-shirt and

entrance and exit of the CEO premises, loaded scrap materials onto
a garbage truck and brought them to the Delfin Junk Store. These
scrap materials have not yet been declared unserviceable or waste by
the proper authority or office. The accused had access to the entrance
and exit of the CEO premises and enjoyed the trust and confidence
reposed on them by their employer to have access throughout the
CEO premises on account of their respective duties. More so, since the
primary function of the guards is to guard the properties, including
the said items of CEO. It was this trust and confidence that was
gravely abused by them that makes the theft qualified. (Yongco v.

that he is working on, using or producing.” Hence, to qualify the
offense and to justify the imposition of the heavier penalty prescribed
by P.D. No. 133, it is essential and necessary to aver in the body of the
information that the articles stolen were materials or products which
the accused was “working on, using or producing.” And a statement

inside the pawnshop, and opened the vault, allowing his co-accused

prision correccional to prision mayor.

Art. 310

the crime of simple theft “in relation to P.D. No. 133,” is insufficient
for the purpose envisioned by the constitutional guarantee that the
accused should be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation
against him, considering that it is well-stated that the real nature of
the criminal charge is determined not from the caption or preamble
of the information nor from the specification of the provision of law
alleged to have been violated, they being conclusions of law, but by
the actual recital in the complaint or information. (Matilde, Jr. v.
Jabson, 72 O.G. 3157)

Use of safe combination learned by confidential clerk is a grave
abuse of confidence.

The accused was a stenographer and confidential clerk of the
offended party. In drying the ink with which the combination numbers
of the safe were written, a new blotter was used by the offended party,
from which the accused learned the turns of the safe combination.
He opened the safe and took the money therefrom.
Held: Qualified theft. (People v. Valdellon, 46 Phil. 245)
Taking money In his possession by receiving teller of bank is
qualified theft.
A receiving teller of a bank, taking advantage of his position,
appropriated the amount of P33,965.45 which he had in his possession.

All laws inconsistent herewith are hereby repealed or modified
accordingly, unless the same provide a heavier penalty. (P.D. No. 133,
which took effect on February 20, 1973)

Held: Qualified theft. The possession of the defendant as
receiving teller was the possession of the bank, as he had only the
physical, not the juridical, possession of the money. There was grave
abuse of confidence. (People v. Locson, 67 Phil. 325)

The clear import of P.D. No. 133 on the basis of its recitals is to
eradicate “graft and corruption in society, and promote the economic
and social welfare of the people” by placing a strong deterrent on
workers and laborers from sabotaging the productive efforts of the
industry where they were employed through the imposition of heavier

and had the check deposited in the account of Firebrake Sales and
Services, a fictitious payee without any legitimate transaction with
Metrobank. Theft is qualified if it is committed with grave abuse of
confidence. The fact that accused-appellant, as assistant cashier of
Metrobank, had custody of the aforesaid checks and had access not
only in the preparation but also in the release of Metrobank cashier’s
checks suffices to designate the crime as qualified theft as he gravely
abused the confidence reposed in him by the bank as assistant cashier.
(People v. Salonga, GR. No. 131131, June 21, 2001)
The confidence gravely abused must be that existing between the
offended party and the offender.
The accused, who was a typist of the Provincial Government of
Samar, asked the watchman of the building for the key to the door
of the session hall in order to use a typewriter. Having received the
key, the accused went to the session hall, took and carried away
a typewriter, and later sold the same. It was contended by the
prosecution that the accused committed qualified theft, because the
watchman reposed confidence in him and he gravely abused it.

Held: The offended party in this case was the Provincial
Government of Samar, not the watchman. The confidence
contemplated in Article 310 is that existing between the offended
party and the offender. (People u. Cabahug, CA., 48 O.G. 2818)
Industrial partner is not liable for qualified theft
An industrial partner who sells personal property acquired
with funds supplied by the capitalist partner, and who is responsible

juridical possession of the property, and may not be held liable for
qualified theft by reason of said sale. (In pari materia: U.S. v. Reyes,

the Prudential Bank. It was in the discharge of this duty that the

accused betrayed the confidence reposed on him by the complainant

by retaining for his personal use, part of the money entrusted to him.

Held: The accused is guilty of qualified theft.
Making capital of the acceptance by complainant of properties
belonging to the accused and his relatives allegedly assigned to the
former for the settlement of his obligations, the accused claims that
there was novation of the relationship between him and the said
complainant, resulting in the obliteration or extinction of his criminal
liability. This argument is anchored on the alleged recognition by
this Court of the novation theory (to extinguish criminal liability) in
the case of People u. Nery. Reliance on the Nery case, in support of
the contention that the acceptance by the complainant of payment
converted the liability of the accused into a civil obligation or else that
it estopped said complainant from proceeding with the prosecution
of the case, is misplaced and unwarranted. Firstly, in the Nery case,
there was contractual relationship between the parties that can be
validly novated by the settlement of the obligation of the offender.
Whatever was said in that case, therefore, cannot be invoked in the
present case where no contractual relationship or bilateral agreement,
which can be modified or altered by the parties, is involved. (People
v. Tanjuatco, G.R. No. L-23924, April 29, 1968)

If the property stolen is mail matter.

What makes the theft of mail matter qualified is the fact that the
subject thereof is mail matter, regardless of whether the offender is a
postal employee or a private individual. (Marcelo v. Sandiganbayan,

Corporation of Manila, diamonds to the value of P27,548.75.

being mail matter. (People v. Manalo and Atienza, 46 Phil. 573)

(Presidential Decree No. 533)

Cattle rustling is the taking away by any means, method
or scheme, without the consent of the owner/raiser, of any
of the animals (classified as large cattle) whether or not for
profit or gain, or whether committed with or without violence
against or intimidation of any person or force upon things. It
includes the killing of large cattle, or taking its meat or hide
without the consent of the owner/raiser.
Presumption of cattle rustling. Every person having in
his possession, control or custody of large cattle shall, upon
demand by competent authorities, exhibit the documents
prescribed in the preceding sections. Failure to exhibit the
required documents shall be prima facie evidence that the
large cattle in his possession, control or custody are the fruits
of the crime of cattle rustling.
Any person convicted of cattle
Penal provisions.
rustling as herein defined shall, irrespective of the value
of the large cattle involved, be punished by prision mayor

committed with violence against or intimidation of persons

or force upon things, the penalty of reclusion temporal in its
maximum period to reclusion perpetua shall be imposed. If
a person is seriously injured or killed as a result or on the
occasion of the commission of cattle rustling, the penalty of
reclusion perpetua to death shall be imposed.

When the offender is a government official or employee,
he shall, in addition to the foregoing penalty, be disqualified
from voting or being voted upon any election/referendum and
from holding any public office or employment.

When the offender is an alien, he shall be deported
immediately upon the completion of the service of his sentence
without further proceedings.
Large cattle as herein used shall include the cow, carabao,
horse, mule, ass, or other domesticated member of the bovine
family.

Theft of large cattle.

Large cattle shall include the cow, carabao, horse, mule, ass,
or other domesticated member of the bovine family. (P.D. No. 533)
To constitute the crime of qualified theft by taking large cattle,
the animal must be taken alive. Thus, killing a cow on the spot where
it was found and taking its meat is simple theft, because there was
no taking of the cow but only its meat. (People v. Morillo, CA., 40
O.G., Supp. 4, 107)
But if the offender, in killing the cow of another, acted with
hatred or revenge against the owner thereof, as when the cow was
killed because it had entered and destroyed the plants of the offender,
the crime committed is not even simple theft, but malicious mischief
under Article 329. (People v. Valiente, et al., CA.-G.R. No. 9442-R,

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

R.P.C. with respect
Anti-Cattle Rustling Law (P.D. No. 533) amended
to offense of theft of large cattle.
From the nature of the penalty imposed which is in terms of
the classification and duration of penalties as prescribed in the
Revised Penal Code, which is not for penalties as are ordinarily
imposed in special laws, the intent seems clear that P.D. No. 533
shall be deemed as an amendment of the Revised Penal Code, with
respect to the offense of theft of large cattle (Art. 310), or otherwise
to be subject to applicable provisions thereof such as Article 104 of
the Revised Penal Code on civil liability of the offender, a provision
which is not found in the decree, but which could not have been
intended to be discarded or eliminated by the decree. Article 64
of the same Code should, likewise, be applicable, under which the
presence of two mitigating circumstances, as found by the trial court,
that of plea of guilty and extreme poverty, without any aggravating
circumstances to offset them, entitles appellant to a lowering by one
degree of the penalty for the offense. (People v. Macatanda, L-51368,
November 6, 1981)

thus manifesting his intent to gain. Fifth, no violence or intimidation
against persons or force upon things attended the commission of the
crime. (Canta v. People, G.R. No. 140937, February 28, 2001)

Art 310

Elements of P.D. No. 533

The crime is committed if the following elements concur:

(1) a large cattle is taken; (2) it belongs to another; (3) the taking is
done without the consent of the owner; (4) the taking is done by any
means, methods or scheme; (5) the taking is with or without intent
to gain; and (6) the taking is accomplished with or without violence

or intimidation against person or force upon things. (People v. Bago,
G.R. No. 122290, April 6, 2000)
These requisites are present in this case. First, there is no
question that the cow belongs to Narciso Gabriel. Petitioner’s only
defense is that in taking the animal he acted in good faith and in the
honest belief that it was the cow which he had lost. Second, petitioner,
without the consent of the owner, took the cow from the custody of
the caretaker despite the fact that he knew all along that the latter
was holding the animal for the owner. Third, petitioner falsified his
Certificate of Ownership of Large Cattle by asking a janitor at the
treasurer’s office to antedate it prior to the taking to make it appear
that he owned the cow in question. Fourth, petitioner adopted “means,
methods, or schemes” to deprive the owner of his possession of his cow,

Art. 310

IF THE PROPERTY STOLEN ARE COCONUTS FROM PLANTATION:
The coconuts must be taken from the premises of a plantation.
The stealing of coconuts when they are still in the tree or
deposited on the ground within the plantation is qualified theft.
(People v. Esmillo, CA.., 40 O.G. Supp. 11, lll;Empelis v. Intermediate
Appellate Court, 132 SCRA 398) When the coconuts are stolen in any
other place, it is simple theft. Thus, when the accused took nine of
the coconuts piled up in front of the house of the offended party along
the highway outside of the coconut plantation, he is guilty of simple
theft. (People v. Esmillo, supra)

Reason for providing a heavier penalty for theft of coconut

In the matter of theft of coconuts, the purpose of the heavier
penalty is to encourage and protect the development of the coconut
industry as one of the sources of our national economy. Unlike rice
and sugar cane farms where the range of vision is unobstructed,
coconut groves cannot be efficiently watched because of the nature
of the growth of coconut trees; and without a special measure to
protect this kind of property, it will be, as it has been in the past,
the favorite resort of thieves. There is, therefore, some reason for
the special treatment accorded the industry. (People v. Isnain, 85
Phil. 650-651)
IF THE PROPERTY STOLEN IS FISH TAKEN FROM A FISHPOND
OR FISHERY.
The term “fish" includes not only the fishes proper but also many
other aquatic animals like crabs, prawns, shrimps, lobsters, clams,

Revised Forestry Law penalizes unauthorized acts relating to timber
or forestry products.
There are two distinct and separate offenses punished under
Section 68 of P.D. 705, to wit:
(1) Cutting, gathering, collecting and removing timber or
other forest products from any forest land, or timber from alienable
or disposable public land, or from private land without any authority;
and
(2) Possession of timber or other forest products without the
legal documents required under existing forest laws and regulations.
In the first offense, one can raise as a defense the legality of
the acts of cutting, gathering, collecting or removing timber or other
forest products by presenting the authorization issued by the DENR.
In the second offense, however, it is immaterial whether the cutting,
gathering, collecting and removal of the forest products is legal or
not. Mere possession of forest products without the proper documents
consummates the crime. Whether or not the lumber comes from a
legal source is immaterial because E.O. No. 277 considers the mere
possession of timber or other forest products without the proper legal
documents as malum prohibitum. (People v. Que, G.R. No. 120365,

Presentation of sales invoice or receipt provides proof of a
legitimate transaction, which is disputable.
A buy-bust operation conducted on Ong’s store resulted in the
confiscation of 13 Firestone tires which were stolen from private
complainant. Ong was charged with violation of the Anti-Fencing Law.
In his defense, Ong argued that he relied on the receipt issued to him
by the seller Go with the letterhead Gold Link Hardware & General
Merchandise. Logically, and for all practical purposes, the issuance of
a sales invoice or receipt is proof of a legitimate transaction and may
be raised as a defense in the charge of fencing; however, that defense
is disputable. (D.M. Consunji, Inc. v. Esguerra, 328 Phil. 1168, 1181)
In this case, the validity of the issuance of the receipt was disputed,
and the prosecution was able to prove that Gold Link and its address
were fictitious. Ong failed to overcome the evidence presented by the
prosecution and to prove the legitimacy of the transaction. Thus, he
was unable to rebut the prima facie presumption under Section 5 of
P.D. No. 1612. (Ong v. People, G.R. No. 190475, April 10, 2013)

Art. 310

Prosecution must prove that the accused knew or should have
known that the item he acquired and later sold was derived from
theft or robbery and that he intended to obtain some gain out of
his acts.

The words “should know” denote the fact that a person of
reasonable prudence and intelligence would ascertain the fact in
performance of his duty to another or would govern his conduct upon
assumption that such fact exists. (Tan v. People, 372 Phil. 108) Ong,
who was in the business of buy and sell of tires for the past 24 years,
ought to have known the ordinary course of business in purchasing
from an unknown seller. Admittedly, Go approached Ong and offered
to sell the 13 tires and he did not even ask for proof of ownership of
the tires. The entire transaction, from the proposal to buy until the
delivery of tires happened in just one day. His experience from the
business should have given him doubt as to the legitimate ownership
of the tires considering that it was his first time to transact with Go
and the manner it was sold is as if Go was just peddling the 13 tires
in the streets. ( Ong v. People, supra)
Mantequilla’s Nissan Safari was carnapped on May 25, 1998.
Two years later in December 2009, Dimat sold it to Delgardo for
P850.000. Dimat claimed that he bought the Nissan Safari from a
966

Art. 310

receipt. But this certainly could not be true because, the vehicle having
been camapped, Tolentino had no documents to show. That Tolentino
was unable to make good on his promise to produce new documents
undoubtedly confirmed to Dimat that the Nissan Safari came from
an illicit source. Still, Dimat sold the same to Sonia Delgado who
apparently made no effort to check the papers covering her purchase.
Hence, the Court affirms the decision of the Court of Appeals finding
Dimat guilty of violation of the Anti-Fencing Law. (Dimat v. People,
G.R. No. 181184, January 25, 2012)

Clearance/Permit to Sell Secondhand Articles Required.

All stores, establishments or entities dealing in the buy and sell
of any good, article, item, object or anything of value obtained from
an unlicensed dealer or supplier thereof, shall before offering the
same for sale to the public, secure the necessary clearance or permit
from the station commander of the Integrated National Police (now
Philippine National Police) in the town or city where such store,
establishment or entity is located.
The crimes of robbery and theft, on the one hand, and fencing, on
the other, are separate and distinct offenses.

Before P.D. No. 1612, a fence could only be prosecuted for and
held liable as an accessory, as the term is defined in Article 19 of
the Revised Penal Code. The penalty applicable to an accessory is
obviously light under the rules prescribed in Articles 53, 55, and 57
of the Revised Penal Code, subject to the qualification set forth in
Article 60 thereof. Noting, however, the reports from law enforcement
agencies that “there is rampant robbery and thievery of government
and private properties” and that such robbery and thievery have
become profitable on the part of the lawless elements because of
the existence of ready buyers, commonly known as fence, of stolen
properties,” P.D. No. 1612 was enacted to “impose heavy penalties on
persons who profit by the effects of the crimes of robbery and theft.
Evidently, the accessory in the crimes of robbery and theft could be
prosecuted as such under the Revised Penal Code or under P.D. No.
1612. However, in the latter case, he ceases to be a mere accessory
but becomes a principal in the crime of fencing. Elsewise stated, the
967

Art. 311

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

crimes of robbery and theft, on the one hand, and fencing, on the
other, are separate and distinct offenses. The state may thus choose
to prosecute him either under the R.P.C. or P.D. No. 1612, although
the preference for the latter would seem inevitable considering
that fencing is a malum prohibitum, and P.D. No. 1612 creates a
presumption of fencing and prescribes a higher penalty based on
the value of the property. (Dizon-Pamintuan v. People, 234 SCRA

Chapter Four
USURPATION

63(1994])

What are the crimes under usurpation?
They are:

Art. 311. Theft of the property of the National Library and
National Museum. If the property stolen be any property of
the National Library or of the National Museum, the penalty
shall be arresto mayor8 or a fine ranging from Forty thousand
pesos (P40,000) to One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000), or
both, unless a higher penalty should be provided under other
provisions of this Code, in which case, the offender shall be
punished by such higher penalty. (As amended by RA. No.

—

10951)

Theft of property on National Library and Museum has a fixed
penalty regardless of Its value.

While the penalty for theft of other property depends on the
value of the property taken, under this article, the penalty is fixed
without regard to the value of the property of the National Library
or National Museum.

But if the crime is committed with grave abuse of confidence, the
penalty for qualified theft shall be imposed, because Article 311 says:
unless a higher penalty should be provided under other provisions
of this Code.”

1.

Occupation of real property or usurpation of real rights in
property. (Art. 312)

2.

Altering boundaries or landmarks. (Art. 313)

Art. 312. Occupation of real property or usurpation of real
rights in property. Any person who, by means of violence
against or intimidation of persons, shall take possession of
any real property or shall usurp any real rights in property
belonging to another, in addition to the penalty incurred for
the acts of violence executed by him, shall be punished by a
fine from fifty (50) to one hundred (100) per centum for the
gain which he shall have obtained, but not less than Fifteen
thousand pesos (P15,000).

—

If the value of the gain cannot be ascertained, a fine from
Forty thousand pesos (P40,000) to One hundred thousand
pesos (P100.000) shall be imposed. (As amended by RA. No.

Acts punishable under Article 312:

Elements:

a.

That the offender takes possession of any real property or
usurps any real rights in property.
That the real property or real rights belong to another.
That violence against or intimidation of persons is used by the
offender in occupying real property or usurping real rights in
property.
That there is intent to gain.

The real property or real rights must belong to another.

If the defendant has shown that he was the owner of the land in
question and the offended party was a mere possessor, Article 312 is
not applicable. (U.S. v. Fuster, 2 Phil. 695) If in taking possession of
the said land, the defendant used violence or intimidation, the crime
committed is grave coercion.
Illustration of usurpation of real right in property.
The accused, who had lost the case in a cadastral proceeding,
took possession of the land adjudicated in favor of the offended party
and harvested the palay, by means of threats and intimidation.

Held: Guilty of usurpation of real right under Article 312. (People
v. Calleja, CA.-G.R. 43375, November 18, 1936)
There is only civil liability, if there is no violence or intimidation in
taking possession of real property.

Thus, if the accused took possession of the land of the offended
party through other means, such as strategy or stealth, during the
absence of the owner or of the person in charge of the property, there
is only civil liability. (People v. Dimacutak, et al., CA., 51 O.G. 1389)

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 312

Thus, if the accused were already occupying the land belonging to
another, and when the administrator of the latter told them that the
land belonged to his principal, the accused told him that they would
kill anyone who would try to drive them away and threatened him
with their bolos and chased him away. The accused are not liable for
usurpation of real property under Article 312. (People v. Dimacutak,

et al., supra)
Article 312 is not applicable to a case of open defiance of the writ
of execution issued in the forcible entry case.
The stubborn refusal of the accused to vacate the land and
to deliver possession of the same to the plaintiff, in open defiance
of the writ of execution issued in the forcible entry case, does not
constitute the crime of usurpation defined and punished in Article
312 of the R.P.C., because the accused did not secure possession of
the land by means of violence or intimidation. The refusal of the
accused constitutes a distinct offense, to wit, contempt of court, under
the Rules of Court, punishable with a fine not exceeding Pl,000 or
imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both. (People v. Leyson,
et al., 57 O.G. 6635)
Criminal action for usurpation of real property, not a bar to civil
action for forcible entry.

Where a criminal action for usurpation of real property was
filed and was dismissed, and the accused therein is sued in a forcible
entry case involving the same real property, a motion to dismiss on
the ground of bar by former judgment cannot be sustained, for not
only are the parties not identical, but also are the causes of action
different. (Pitargue v. Sorilla, 92 Phil. 5)
Nature of crime.

Violence or intimidation must be the means used in occupying real
property or usurping real right belonging to another.
Article 312 does not apply when the violence or intimidation took
place subsequent to the entry into the property, because the violence
or intimidation must be the means used in occupying real property
or in usurping real rights.

Article 312 may be considered as defining and penalizing the
single, special and indivisible crime of occupation of real property or
usurpation of real rights in property by means of violence against or
intimidation of persons. It is not a complex crime as defined under
Article 48. It provides a single, albeit two-tiered, penalty consisting of
a principal penalty, which is that incurred for the acts of violence, and
an additional penalty of fine based on the value of the gain obtained

960

by the accused. This is clear from the clause“in addition to the penalty
incurred for the acts of violence executed by him." For want of a better
term, the additional penalty may be designated as an incremental
penalty. (People v. Alfeche, Jr., G.R. No. 102070, July 23, 1992)

(b)

In theft or robbery, personal property is taken; in this crime,
there is real property or real right involved.

(c)

In both crimes, there is intent to gain.

“In addition to the penalty incurred for the acts of violence executed
by him."

Republic Act No. 947 punishes entering or occupying public
agricultural land including public lands granted to private
individuals.
It shall be unlawful for any person, corporation or association
to enter or occupy, through force, intimidation, threat, strategy or
stealth, any public agricultural land including such public lands as are
granted to private individuals under the provisions of the Public Land
Act or any other laws providing for the disposal of public agricultural
lands in the Philippines, and are duly covered by the corresponding
applications required for the purpose, notwithstanding the fact that
title thereto still remains in the Government; or for any person,
natural or juridical, to instigate, induce or force another to commit
such acts. (Sec. 1, R.A. No. 947)
Any violation of the provisions of this Act shall be punished by
a fine of not exceeding one thousand pesos or imprisonment for not
more than one year, or by both such fine and imprisonment in the
discretion of the court. (Sec. 3, R.A. No. 947)

When the occupation of real property is committed by means
of violence against or intimidation of persons, the accused may be
prosecuted under an information for violation of Article 312, and
not for a separate crime involving violence or intimidation. But,
whenever, appropriate, he may be sentenced to suffer the penalty for
the acts of violence and to pay a fine based on the value of the gain
obtained. Thus, if by reason or on the occasion of such occupation
or usurpation, the crime of homicide, or any of the physical ii\juries
penalized in either subdivisions 1 or 2 of Article 263 is committed; or
when the same shall have been accompanied by rape or intentional
mutilation; or when, in the course of its execution, the offender shall
have inflicted upon any person not responsible for its commission any
of the physical injuries covered by subdivisions 3 and 4 of Article 263;
or when it is committed through intimidation or through the infliction
of physical injuries not covered by subdivisions 1 to 4 of Article 263 of
the Revised Penal Code, i.e., physical injuries penalized under Articles
265 and 266 of the Revised Penal Code, the accused may be convicted
for the violation of Article 312. However, he shall be sentenced: (a)
to suffer the penalty for homicide, rape, intentional mutilation, and
physical injuries provided under subdivisions 1 to 4 of Article 263,
other physical injuries or for the intimidation, which may fall under
Article 282 (Grave Threats) or Article 286 (Grave Coercion) of the
R.P.C., as the case may be, and (b) to pay a fine based on the value of
the gain obtained by him, which shall be an amount equivalent to 50
to lOOper centum of such gain, but in no case less than P75.00 (now
P15,000) provided, however, that if such value cannot be ascertained,
the fine shall be from P200 to P500 (now P40.000 to P 100,000). (People

Is intent to gain necessary under Article 313?

Article 313 does not seem to require it. Mere alteration of the
boundary marks or monuments intended to designate the boundaries
of towns, provinces or estate is punishable.

Chapter Five

CULPABLE INSOLVENCY

Fraudulent intent is not necessary for the crime to exist.
(Guevara)

The offense consists in carrying out a felonious intent to usurp
realty, and this intent must be established as the moral element before
the penalty fixed in Article 313 can be applied. (Albert)
Meaning of the word “alter.”

The word alter has a general and indefinite meaning. Any
alteration of boundary marks is enough to constitute the material
element of the crime. Destruction of stone monument or taking it to
another place, or removing a fence, is altering. (Albert)

Art. 314. Fraudulent insolvency.

— Any person who shall

abscond with his property to the prejudice of his creditors,
shall suffer the penalty of prision mayor1 if he be a merchant,

and the penalty of prision correccional in its maximum period
to prision mayor in its medium period,3 if he be not a merchant.

Elements:

1.

That the offender is a debtor; that is, he has obligations due
and payable.

2.

That he absconds with his property.

3.

That there be prejudice to his creditors.

Illustration of a violation of Article 314.

Defendant was a merchant of good standing, but he became
indebted to several merchants in Cebu. Judgment was rendered
against him and execution issued. He owned several parcels of real
property which he transferred to another to place them beyond the
reach of his creditors. The considerations in the deed of sale were all
fictitious.
Held: Fraudulent insolvency made in fraud of creditors. (People
v. Tan Diong, 59 Phil. 537)
Actual prejudice, not intention alone, is required.
Hence, even if the debtor disposes of his property, unless it
is shown that such disposal has actually prejudiced his creditor,
conviction will not lie. Fraudulent concealment of property is not

sufficient if the creditor has some other property with which to satisfy
his obligation. (People v. Sy Gesiong, 60 Phil. 614)
The mere circumstance that a person has disposed of his
merchandise by removing them from the place where they are kept
would not necessarily imply fraudulent insolvency which requires
malice, especially so as in this case where the defendant delivered
part of the proceeds of the sale to his creditor. (People u. Guzman,
CA., 40 O.G. 2655)
Being a merchant is not an element of this offense.

If the accused is a merchant, a higher penalty shall be imposed.
Real property may be involved.

The word “abscond" does not require that the debtor should
depart and physically conceal his property. Hence, real property
could
be the subject matter of fraudulent insolvency. (People v. Chong Chuy
Limgobo, 45 Phil. 372)
The person prejudiced must be the creditor of the offender.
As to Pastora Padla, it appears that she joined in the conveyances,
but the creditors who were defrauded were not her creditors, they
being the creditors of her husband, the merchant Tan Diong.
The
fact that she participated in the making of the document
executed
by her husband does not prove her complicity in the
fraud. (People
V. Tan Diong, supra)

Distinguished from the Insolvency Law.

The Insolvency Law requires for its application that the criminal
act should have been committed after the institution
of insolvency
proceedings.

Under the present article, there is no such requirement, and
it is not necessary that the defendant
should have been adjudged

bankrupt or insolvent.

Hence, there is no inconsistency between this
Article and the
Insolvency Law.

par. [b]), except in so far as the abuse of confidence in misappropriating
the funds or property after they have come to the hands of the offender
may be said to be a fraud upon the person injured thereby. (U.S. v.
Pascual, 10 Phil. 621)

Elements of estafa In general:

1.

That the accused defrauded another (a) by abuse of confidence,
or (b) by means of deceit; and

2.

That damage or prejudice capable of pecuniary estimation is
caused to the offended party or third person.

The first element covers the three different ways of committing
estafa under Article 315.

Note that Article 315 has three subdivisions classifying the
different forms of estafa according to the means by which the fraud
is committed.
Thus, estafa is committed

—

(a)

with unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence;

(b)

by means of false pretenses or fraudulent acts; or

(c)

through fraudulent means.

The three ways of committing estafa under Article 315 may be
reduced to two only. The first form under subdivision No. 1 is known
as estafa with abuse of confidence, and the second and third forms
under subdivisions Nos. 2 and 3 cover estafa by means of deceit.
Deceit is not an essential requisite of estafa with abuse of
confidence.

Note: It will be noted that “abuse of confidence’ and “deceit" are
two different means of committing estafa under Article 315. Where
there is fraudulent conversion or misappropriation of the property
received in trust, on commission, for administration, or under any
other obligation involving the duty to make delivery of or to return
the same, deceit is not an essential element of estafa.
The second element — the basis of the penalty.
It is necessary that the damage or prejudice be capable of
pecuniary estimation, because the amount of the damage or prejudice
is the basis of the penalty for estafa.
The first four paragraphs of Article 315 fix the penalties for
estafa according to the amount of the fraud.
With unfaithfulness or abuse of confidence, namely:
By altering the substance, quantity, or quality of anything of
value which the offender shall deliver by virtue of an obligation to
do so, even though such obligation be based on an immoral or illegal
consideration. (Art. 316, No. l[a])
Elements of estafa with unfaithfulness:
1. That the offender has an onerous obligation to deliver something
of value.
2. That he alters its substance, quantity, or quality.

3.

That damage or prejudice is caused to another.

“Deceit with intent to defraud” is not an essential requisite
in cases wherein the money or other personal property has been
voluntarily entrusted to the offender, without wrongdoing on his
part in obtaining or receiving it. It is true that it is sometimes said
that “deception with intent to defraud” is an essential requisite of the
crime of estafa. But while this is true as to estafas in general, it is not
true of those estafas under consideration (Article 315, subdivision 1,

There must be an existing obligation to deliver something of value.
Under the provision of paragraph 1(a), Article 315, the obligation
to deliver already existed, and the offender, on making the delivery,
has altered the substance, quantity or quality of the thing he
delivered. (People v. Gansai, CA., 61 O.G. 3603)

970

971

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Art. 315

By virtue of an onerous obligation.

In estafa by altering the substance, quantity or quality of
anything of value which the offender delivers, the delivery of anything
of value must be “by virtue of an onerous obligation to do so.” (Albert)
Thus, if the thing delivered had not been fully or partially paid
for when it was received by the other party, the person making the
delivery is not liable for estafa, even if there was an alteration of the
substance, quantity, or quality of the thing delivered as there was
no damage caused.
Altering the substance, quality or quantity of the things to be
delivered.

1.

Altering the substance.

Thus, where a person sold to another 1,000 tins on the assurance
that they contained opium, when in fact only 16 tins contained opium
while the others contained only molasses, the crime of estafa under
this subsection was committed, because there was an alteration of the
substance from opium, which he promised to deliver, to molasses
which was actually delivered. (People v. Manansala, et al., 58 Phil.

—

796)

Altering the substance may constitute a violation of the Food, Drug,
and Cosmetics Act.

When the fraud committed consists in the adulteration of
any health product, i.e., food, drugs, cosmetics, devices, biologicals,
vaccines, in-vitro diagnostic reagents and household/urban hazardous
substances and/or a combination of and/or a derivative thereof, or
products that may have an effect on health which require regulations
as determined by the Food and Drug Administration, it also amounts
to a violation of the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (R.A. No. 3720, as
amended). Fraud which consists in the adulteration of any food, drug,
device or cosmetic may also amount to a violation of the Consumer
Act of the Philippines. (RA. No. 7394, April 13, 1992)
2. Altering the quantity.

The accused pledged to the Compania de Tabacos 20,000 bales of
hemp, by declaring in an instrument that such number of bales was
actually in existence, the accused knowing that he had only 12,000
972

TITLE TEN

Art. 315

Crimes Against Property

bales in the warehouse. The manager of the Compania de Tabacos,
trusting the apparent good faith of the accused, continued to advance
the latter, money and goods on account in the sum of P300,000.00.
Held: This is estafa by altering the quantity of the thing the
accused promised to deliver by virtue of an obligation to do so. (U.S.
v. Mendezona, 2 Phil. 353)
A person who, after having agreed to the sale of 100 cavans
of palay, and having received the payment therefor, delivers to the
purchaser 98 cavans only, is guilty of estafa for having altered the
quantity of the thing he is duty-bound to deliver. (Guevara)
3.

Altering the quality.

A agreed to sell to B first class rice and received from B the
purchase price thereof. But when the rice was delivered to B, it was
found to be a poor kind of rice. The damage consists in the difference
in value of the rice.
When there is no agreement as to the quality of the thing to be
delivered, the delivery of the thing not acceptable to the complainant
is not estafa.

Thus, in a case where the evidence does not show that there was
an agreement as to the quality of the ROTO and PMT insignias and
name plates which the accused bound themselves to make and deliver
to the complainant, and the insignias and name plates delivered by
the accused were not acceptable to the complainant, even if payment
was made by the latter, the accused are not guilty of estafa under
Article 315, paragraph 1(a), of the Revised Penal Code. (People v.
Bastiana, et al., CA., 54 O.G. 4300)

“Even though such obligation be based on an immoral or illegal
consideration.”
By specific provision of paragraph (a) of subdivision No. 1, Article
315, the crime of estafa may anse even if the thing to be delivered,
under the obligation to deliver it, is not a subject of lawful commerce,
such as opium. Note the case of People v. Manansala, et al., 58 Phil.
796, where the accused was found guilty of estafa, even if the thing
which he promised to deliver was opium.

Art 315

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

By misappropriating or converting, to the prejudice of another,
money, goods, or other personal property received by the offender in
trust, or on commission, or for administration, or under any other
obligation involving the duty to make delivery of or to return the
same, even though such obligation be totally or partially guaranteed
by a bond; or by denying having received such money, goods, or other
property. (Art. 315, No. 1 [b])
Elements of estafa with abuse of confidence under subdivision No.
1, paragraph (b), of Article 315:

1.

That money, goods, or other personal property be received by the
offender in trust, or on commission, or for administration, or
under any other obligation involving the duty to make delivery
of, or to return, the same;

2.

That there be misappropriation or conversion of such money or
property by the offender, or denial on his part of such receipt;

3.

That such misappropriation or conversion or denial is to the
prejudice of another; and

4.

That there is a demand made by the offended party to the
offender.

Note: The fourth element is not necessary when there is evidence
of misappropriation of the goods by the defendant. (Tubb v. People,
et al., 101 Phil. 114)
Check is Included in the word “money.”

The distinction between the conversion of a check and the
conversion of cash in relation to the formal allegation in the
information of conversion of a specific sum of money is not material in
estafa. First, a check, after all, while not regarded as a legal tender,
is normally accepted, under commercial usage, as a substitute for
cash. Furthermore, the credit represented by it in stated monetary
value is properly capable of appropriation. Second, it is erroneous for
the accused to assume that he was in receipt of the complainant’s
money only from the time when and at the place where he cashed the
check. Applying the principles of civil law on payments done thru the
use of bills of exchange, the delivery to the accused of the check of
an earlier date and at another place, had the effect, when the same
974

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 315

was subsequently cashed, of transferring as of that date and in that
place, the sum covered thereby from the drawer to the payee. This,
although the change from check to public notes took place at a later
date and at another situs. And third, the delivery by the complainant
of the check and its acceptance by the accused signified not merely the
transfer to the accused of money belonging to the complainant. It also
marked, the creation of a fiduciary relation between the parties. The
existence of such relation either in the form of a trust, commission
or administration, is, of course, an essential element of the crime of
estafa by misappropriating or conversion. ( Galvez v. Court of Appeals,
42 SCRA 278)
Money, goods or other personal property must be received by the
offender.

Note the first element of this form of estafa. The money, goods
or other personal property must be received by the offender. If the
offender takes the thing without the consent of the owner, the crime
may be theft, not estafa.
Money, goods or other personal property must be received by the
offender under certain kinds of transaction transferring juridical
possession to him.

Paragraph (b) of subdivision No. 1 provides that the “money,
goods, or any other personal property” be “received by the offender
in trust or on commission, or for administration, or under any other
obligation involving the duty to make delivery of, or to return the same.”

When the thing is received by the offender from the offended
party (1) in trust, or (2) on commission, or (3) for administration, the
offender acquires both material or physical possession and juridical
possession of the thing received.
Meaning of juridical possession.

Juridical possession means a possession which gives the
transferee a right over the thing which the transferee may set up
even against the owner.
The case of People v. Noveno, et al., CA, 46 O.G. 1637, illustrates
the meaning of juridical possession:

him and the principal; and he may set up his right of possession as
against that of the principal until the agency is terminated. ( Guzman
v. Court of Appeals, 99 Phil. 703)

Held: It is not correct to say that the abaca in question
was not received by the accused from anybody but had been
harvested by them. What the accused are charged with having
misappropriated is the landlord’s share of the purchase price
which they received in trust for him. (People v. Carulasdulasan,
et al., 95 Phil. 8)

Presumption as to kind of possession.

When the delivery of a chattel has not the effect of transferring
the juridical possession thereof, or title thereto, it is presumed that
the possession of, and title to, the thing so delivered remain in the
owner. (U.S. v. De Vera, 43 Phil. 1001)
Illustration of estafa where the offender received the thing in trust,
on commission, or for administration:

1.

The thing was received in trust:

The accused were tenants of the complaining witness.
They received from the sale of the abaca harvested by them
a sum of money, including the one-half which belonged to the
landlord under the tenancy agreement. The accused were
under obligation to deliver to the landlord this half of the
money. They, therefore, held it in trust for him. But instead of
turning it over to him, they appropriated it to their own use and
refused to give it to him, notwithstanding repeated demands.

SEC. 13. Penalty clause. The failure of an entrustee to
turn over the proceeds of the sale of the goods, documents
or instruments covered by a trust receipt to the extent of
the amount owing to the entruster or as appears in the trust
receipt or to return said goods, documents or instruments
if they were not sold or disposed of in accordance with the
terms of the trust receipt shall constitute the crime of estafa,
punishable under the provisions of Article Three Hundred
and Fifteen, Paragraph One (b), of Act Numbered Three
Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifteen, as amended, otherwise
known as the Revised Penal Code. If the violation or offense
is committed by a corporation, partnership, association or
other juridical entities, the penalty provided for in this Decree
shall be imposed upon the directors, officers, employees or
other officials or persons therein responsible for the offense,
without prejudice to the civil liabilities arising from the
criminal offense.

Trust Receipts.
Under Section 13 of the Trust Receipts Law, the failure of an

entrustee to turn over the proceeds of the sale of goods, documents

or instruments covered by a trust receipt to the extent of the amount
owing to the entruster or as appear in the trust receipt or to return
said goods, documents or instruments if they were not sold or disposed
of in accordance with the terms of the trust receipt shall constitute
the crime of estafa, punishable under the provisions of Article 315,
paragraph 1(b) of the Revised Penal Code.

A trust receipt transaction is one where the entrustee has the
obligation to deliver to the entruster the price of the sale, or if the

merchandise is not sold, to return the merchandise to the entruster.
There are, therefore, two obligations in a trust receipt transaction:
the first refers to money received under the obligation involving the
duty to turn it over (entregarla) to the owner of the merchandise
sold, while the second refers to the merchandise received under
the obligation to “return” it (devolvera) to the owner. A violation of

any of these undertakings constitutes Estafa defined under Article
315, paragraph 1(b) of the R.P.C. (Hur Tin Yang v. People, G.R. No.
195117, August 14, 2013; Ng v. People, G.R. No. 173905, April 23,

2010, 619 SCRA 291)
When the goods subject of the trust receipt are not intended for
sale, the transaction is a mere loan.

The practice of banks of making borrowers sign trust receipts
to facilitate collection of loans and place them under the threats of
criminal prosecution should they be unable to pay it may be unjust
and inequitable, if not reprehensible. Such agreements are contracts
of adhesion which borrowers have no option but to sign lest their loan
be disapproved. The resort to this scheme leaves poor and hapless
borrowers at the mercy of banks and is prone to misinterpretation
xxx. This reprehensible bank practice should be stopped and
discouraged. For this Court to give life to the constitutional provision
of non-imprisonment for nonpayment of debts, it is imperative that
petitioner be acquitted of the crime of Estafa under Article 315,
paragraph 1(b) of the R.P.C., in relation to P.D. No. 115. (Colinares v.
Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 90828, September 5, 2000, 339 SCRA 609)

Illustrations:
1.

Landbank extended a credit accommodation to ACDC, a

construction company, through a credit line agreement.
In various instances, ACDC used the trust receipts
facility of the credit line to buy construction materials
and respondents, as officers of ACDC, executed the trust
receipts. As the trust receipts matured without ACDC
returning to Land Bank the proceeds of the construction
projects or the construction materials subject of the trust
receipts despite demand, Land Bank filed a case for estafa
against the respondents.

.
2.

Art. 315

Held: In all trust receipt transactions, both obligations
on the part of the trustee exist in the alternative - the
return of the proceeds of the sale or the return or recovery
of the goods, whether raw or processed. When both parties
enter into an agreement knowing fully well that the return
of the goods subject of the trust receipt is not possible
even without any fault on the part of the trustee, it is not
a trust receipt transaction penalized under Section 13 of
P.D. No. 115 in relation to Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of
the RPC, as the only obligation actually agreed upon by
the parties would be the return of the proceeds of the sale
transaction. This transaction becomes a mere loan, where
the borrower is obligated to pay the bank the amount spent
for the purchase of the goods. (Land Bank of the Philippines
v. Perez, G.R. No. 166884, June 13, 2012, 672 SCRA 117)
The fact that the entruster bank knew even before the
execution of the alleged trust receipt agreements that the
covered construction materials were never intended by the
entrustee for resale or for the manufacture of items to be
sold, but for use in the fabrication of steel communication
towers, would take the transaction between entrustee and
entruster bank outside the ambit of the Trust Receipts
Law. (Hur Tin Yang v. People, G.R. No. 195117, August
14, 2013)

The thing was received on commission:

A received P0.25 from B with obligation to pay it as
slaughter fee to the municipal treasurer. A received some pork
from C, promising to pay P0.25, representing the cost of the
pork, to the municipal treasurer as slaughter fee in the name
of C. A failed to make the payment for C and B, and spent the
money of B.

Held: (1) As to the P0.25 in cash received from B, there
is estafa. (2) As to his promise to pay P0.25 to the municipal
treasurer in consideration of some pork received from C, there
is no estafa.

Reasons: (1) The title under which A received the P0.25
from B was that of a commission consisting in the instruction
to deliver the same to the municipal treasurer.

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

Art. 316

As regards the failure of A to pay to the treasurer the
P0.25 representing the cost of the pork received from C, there
is no estafa, because the law says “money, goods, or any other
personal property received," under the obligation “to deliver
the same.” This means that the thing received must be the same
thing to be delivered, and not another. (See U.S. v. Figueroa, 22
Phil. 270)
Note: A did not receive any money from C to be delivered
to the treasurer. What A received from C was a kilo of pork.

The thing was received for administration:
Thus, if the administrator, appointed by the Court to
administer the estate of a deceased person, received money or
other personal property in such capacity, and misappropriated
the same for his personal benefit, he is guilty of estafa.

Ibajay, Capiz, a box of sinamay valued at P625.00, consigned
to another Chinese bearing also the marks “Y.J.” was also
delivered to the accused by mistake because of the similarity of
the marks. When informed of the mistake, the accused denied
that he had received the box of sinamay and declared that he
knew nothing whatever about it.
Held: The accused is guilty of estafa. He received the
box of sinamay under such circumstances as to give rise to an
obligation to return or make delivery of the same to the owner
upon demand. (U.S. v. Yap Tian Jong, 34 Phil. 10)
The thing was received under a contract of bailment.

a.

The phrase “or under any other obligation involving the duty to
make delivery of, or to return the same,” Includes quasi-contracts
and certain contracts of bailment.

These contracts require the return of the same thing received.
(U.S. v. Clarin, 17 Phil. 86)

Illustrations of estafa where the offender received the thing under
a quasi-contract or contract of bailment.

1.

The thing was received under a quasi-contract.

An inter-island steamer received at Manila a shipment
of 18 boxes of goods consigned to the accused. The boxes bore

Under a contract of deposit.
The offended party deposited with the accused
certificate of Stock No. 517 as guaranty for the payment
of certain shares of “Crown Mines.” When already
in possession of the certificate of Stock No. 517, the
accused indorsed it to the Hongkong Shanghai Banking
Corporation as guaranty of his overdraft. As a result, the
offended party could not recover her certificate of Stock
No. 517 when she paid the shares of “Crown Mines."

Where the accused collected a sum of money as rentals
from the different tenants of his employer, failed to account
for and turn over said amount to his employer, upon demand
therefor, he is guilty of estafa. (People u. Benitez, 108 Phil. 920)

In quasi-contracts, the person who receives the thing also
acquires juridical possession of the thing received.
In contracts of bailment, such as, contract of deposit, contract of
lease of personal property, commodatum, etc., the depositary or the
lessee, or the borrower acquires also juridical possession of the thing
deposited with him, or leased to him, or loaned to him.

Art. 315

Held: Since the pledge (indorsing it as guaranty of
his overdraft) involves an act of ownership, the depositary
who pledges a thing in deposit uses it for a distinct purpose
and accordingly commits the crime of estafa. (People v.
Campos, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 12, 7)
b.

Under contract of lease of personal property.
The accused hired the truck of the offended party
until noon of the same day for the sum of P10.00. The
truck was never returned as it had been sold to a third
person.
Held: Pursuant to their agreement, the offended
party delivered not only the material but also the juridical
possession of his truck to the accused. The accused are
guilty of estafa, not qualified theft. (People v. Noveno, et
al., CA., supra)

Distinguished from the case of People v. Isaac (96
Phil. 931).
The owner of a jeepney with license plate No.
AC-2553, hired the accused on a temporary basis and
entrusted the vehicle for a “pasada,” that is to say, for

transporting passengers for a compensation, at the rate
of P10.00 per day. His arrangement with the owner was
to turn in not all the fare collected, but only a fixed sum
known in the trade as “boundary." The accused sold the
jeepney.
Held: The accused had only substituted for the
regular driver of the jeepney operated as a public utility.
He cannot be considered a lessee of the jeepney, because
it is ordained in Section 26 of the Rules and Regulations
of the Public Service Commission that “no motor vehicle
operator shall enter into any kind of contract with
any person if by the term thereof it allows the use and
operation of all or any of his equipment under a fixed
rental basis.” In the eyes of the law then, the accused was
not a lessee but only an employee or agent of the owner,
so that his possession of the vehicle was only an extension
of that of the latter. The accused, not having the juridical
possession of the jeepney, committed qualified theft for
disposing of it with intent to gain and without the consent
of the owner. (People v. Isaac, 96 Phil. 931)

Note: In the case of People u. Noveno, supra, the
truck was not operated as a regular passenger vehicle,
subject to the rules and regulations of the Public Service
Commission which prohibit the leasing of vehicles
operated as a public utility.

c.

Under a contract of commodatum.

A borrowed a book from B to be returned after two
days. After two days, in spite of repeated demands, A
could not return the book, because he had sold it. This
is estafa, because in a contract of commodatum, the
borrower acquired the juridical possession of the thing

borrowed.

the bailor retains the ownership of the thing loaned.
The obligation to return or deliver the thing must be contractual
without transferring to the accused the ownership of the thing
received.
Article 315, No. 1(b) is intended for the case of embezzlement
by a bailee, whose obligation to return or deliver the thing received
is contractual.

But Article 315, No. 1(b) does not apply when the contract
between the accused and the complainant has the effect of transferring
to the accused the ownership of the thing received.
Thus, when the contract is a loan of money, the accused debtor

cannot be held liable for estafa for merely refusing to pay, or denying
having contracted, the debt. (U.S. v. Ibanez, 19 Phil. 559) Loan of
money is known as mutuum. It is a loan for consumption and the
ownership of the thing loaned passes to the borrower.

When the accused had received a thing from the complainant,
under a contract of purchase and sale, and failed or refused to pay
the price thereof, he is not liable for estafa. (People v. Gonora, C.A.,
38 O.G. 3185)

In those two transactions, the accused did not receive the money
or thing under the “obligation involving the duty to make delivery of,
or to return, the same’ money or thing.
When ownership of the thing is transferred to the person who has
received it, his failure to return it will give rise to civil liability only.

It is necessary to resort in many cases to the provisions of the
civil law to determine in whom the ownership is vested.
(1) Contract of Purchase and Sale. — Thus, when the
contract under which the thing is received is one of purchase and sale,
even if the price is not paid, ownership is transferred to the buyer
upon the delivery of the thing to him. If the buyer sold the thing and
did not pay the price to the original owner, there is only civil liability.

The advance or part payment of the price of the thing sold,
but not yet delivered, becomes the property of the seller. If the

Since ownership of the money (cash advance) was transferred to

relationship between petitioner and private respondent, which is
an essential element of the crime of estafa by misappropriation or
conversion, petitioner could not have committed estafa. (Yong Chan

there is only civil liability. (U.S. v. Figueroa, 22 Phil. 270)

complainant.

Held: That as the accused chose to retain the radio set, the
transaction, theretofore indefinite, became automatically a sale. There
is no estafa even if for eight months the accused deliberately avoided
paying anything at all. (Sison v. People, G.R. No. 48198 [1943])
(2) Money market transaction. — A money market
transaction partakes of the nature of a loan and therefore “nonpayment
thereof would not give rise to criminal liability for estafa through
misappropriation or conversion.” As held in Yam v. Malik, 94 SCRA
30 (1979), private respondent or Philfinance was not obliged under
the money market transaction to return the same money he or the
corporation had received from petitioner.

In money market placement, the investor is a lender who loans
his money to a borrower through a middleman or dealer. Petitioner
here loaned his money to a borrower through Philfinance. When
the latter failed to deliver back petitioner’s placement with the
corresponding interest earned at the maturity date, the liability
incurred by Philfinance was a civil one. As such, petitioner could have
instituted against Philfinance before the ordinary courts a simple
action for recovery of the amount he had invested and he could have
prayed therein for damages. (Sesbreno v. Court of Appeals, GJi. No.
84096, January 26, 1995)

Facts: It appears that the accused, upon representation that he had

complainant, but in spite of repeated demands, the said accused failed to
deliver the copra or return the amount received. Thus, an information for
estafa was filed against him.
Held: On the merits, there is reason to believe that the responsibility
of the accused is only civil in nature. The receipt signed by the accused
reads: “Received from x x x the sum of P2,400.00 only representing advance

Held: A person receiving money from another and failing to return it

under any other circumstances giving rise to the obligation to make delivery
of or to return the same.”

the
college undertook to keep safe the money in question
and return it
later to each student in the very same coins or bills in which
it had
been originally received. The Mindanao Agricultural College
merely
bound itself to reimburse or repay to each student, the amount
“deposited" by him or by her, after deducting or setting off
the value
of broken equipment. The relation thus established between college
and student was one of debtor and creditor, not one of depositor
and
depository; the transaction was a loan, not a deposit. As a loan,
the
college acquired the ownership of the money paid by the
students,
subject only to the obligation of reimbursing equivalent
amounts,
unless a deduction should happen to be due. (People v. Montemayor,
et al., G.R. No. L-17449, August 30, 1962)

There is no estafa if the thing is received under a contract of sale
on credit

Where the articles were purchased by the accused on credit, even
if subsequently the term “consignment” was used, the failure of
the
accused either to pay for the articles or to return them did not make
him liable for estafa. (People o, Santos, 3 CA. Rep. 791)

Criminal liability for estafa not affected by novation of contract
People v. Benitez

(GR. No. L15923, June 30, 1960)

Facts: The accused was employed by Jose Cua as collector of rents
of the houses owned by the latter. The accused made several
collections
amounting to P640.00 but failed to turn over said amount, or to account for it,
to his employer. Upon demand, the accused offered to work in his employer’s
establishment, the sum of P10O.00 to be deducted from his salary every
month until the whole amount is fully paid. The offer and conditions for his
employment were accepted by Jose Cua and reduced to writing. After working
for only a few days, the accused did not report, whereupon Cua wrote to him
a letter demanding settlement of his account. The accused having failed to
pay the amount of his obligation, a complaint for estafa was filed against
him. He was convicted and sentenced to suffer imprisonment.

Amounts paid by the students to the school to answer for the value
of materials broken are not mere deposits.

Issue: Whether the accused’s agreement with his employer converted
his criminal liability into a civil obligation.

and the accused, cannot produce novation. For the latter to exist,
there must be proof of intent to extinguish the original relationship,
and such intent cannot be inferred from the mere acceptance of
payments on account of what is totally due. Much less can it be said
that the acceptance of partial satisfaction can effect the nullification
of a criminal liability that is fully matured, and already in the
process of enforcement. Thus, this Court has ruled that the offended
party’s acceptance of a promissory note for all or part of the amount
misapplied does not obliterate the criminal offense. (Camus v. Court
of Appeals, 48 Off. Gaz. 3898)

Art. 315

In order that novation of contract may relieve the accused of criminal

liability, the novation must take place before the criminal liability is incurred;
criminal liability for estafa already committed is not affected by compromise
or novation of contract, for it is a public offense which must be prosecuted
and punished by the state at its own volition. (People v. Florida, 12 CA. Rep.
551) And, in the case at bar, since the criminal liability of the appellants
already took effect when they converted to their use the four tires which the
complainant deposited with them and they thereby already committed estafa
with such conversion and failure to return the tires, any subsequent novation
of their contract can no longer affect the already incurred criminal liability
of the appellants for the crime of estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of
the Revised Penal Code. (People v. Bonilla, et al., 16 CA. Rep. 560)

Legal effects of novation on criminal liability.
The legal effects of novation on criminal liability were explained
by the Court, through Justice J.B.L. Reyes, in People v. Nery, 10
SCRA 244, as follows:

The novation theory may perhaps apply prior to the filing of
the criminal information in court by the state prosecutors, because
up to that time, the original trust relation may be converted by the
parties into an ordinary creditor-debtor situation, thereby placing
the complainant in estoppel to insist on the original trust. But after
the judicial authorities have taken cognizance of the crime and
instituted action in court, the offended party may no longer divest the
prosecution of its power to exact the criminal liability, as distinguished
from the civil. The crime being an offense against the state, only the
latter can renounce it.
It may be observed in this regard that novation is not one of the
means recognized by the Penal Code whereby criminal liability can
be extinguished; hence, the role of novation may only be to either
prevent the rise of criminal or to cast doubt on the true nature of the
original petition, whether or not it was such that its breach would
not give rise to penal responsibility, as when money loaned is made
to appear as a deposit, or other similar disguise is resorted to. (cf.
Abeto v. People, 90 Phil. 581; Villareal, 27 Phil. 481)

Second element of estafa with abuse of confidence under paragraph
(b), subdivision No. 1, Article 315.

It will be noted that there are three ways of committing estafa
with abuse of confidence under Article 315, No. 1(b).
They are:
1.

By misappropriating the thing received.

2.

By converting the thing received.

3.

By denying that the thing was received.

“By misappropriating” or "by converting."

Paragraph (b), Subdivision No. 1 of Article 315, was taken
by the Code Commission from paragraph 5 of Article 535 of the
Spanish Penal Code of 1870 which used the words “apropiaren”
and “distrajeren" which are translated into English with the words
“misappropriating1’ and “converting,” respectively.

The word converting (distraer) connotes the act of using or
disposing of another’s property as if it were one’s own. The word
misappropriating (apropiar) means to own, to take something for
one’s own benefit.
The words “convert” and “misappropriated” connote an act of
using or disposing of another’s property as if it were one’s own or
devoting it to a purpose or use different from that agreed upon. To
misappropriate for one’s own use includes, not only conversion to one’s
personal advantage but also every attempt to dispose of the property
of another without right. (U.S. v. Panes, 37 Phil. 118; Amorsolo v.
People, 154 SCRA 666)
989

Art 315

Pledging a thing by the accused, which was received by him
only to be sold on commission, constitutes the crime of estafa. (U.S.
v. Torres, 11 Phil. 606)

Deposit of money received in trust by accused in his personal
account and his failure to account for it on demand is estafa. (Hayco
v. Court of Appeals, 138 SCRA 227)
Meaning of “conversion.”

It presupposes that the thing has been devoted to a purpose or
use different from that agreed upon.
Thus, when pieces of jewelry were delivered to an agent to be
shown to prospective buyers, their delivery to a sub-agent for the
same purpose does not constitute conversion. (People v. Nepomuceno,
46 O.G. 6132)
Estafa by conversion.

Pledging a thing received by the accused to be sold on commission
constitutes the crime of estafa. (U.S. v. Torres, 11 Phil. 606) But the
fact that an agent sold the thing received on commission for a lower
price than the one fixed, does not constitute the crime of estafa. (U.S.
v. Torres, supra)

Where petitioner sold jewelry on credit despite the explicit terms
of the authority granted to her which prohibited selling on credit, the
petitioner used the property for a purpose other than that agreed
upon. The words “convert” and “misappropriate" connote an act of
using or disposing of another’s property as if it were one’s own or
devoting it to a purpose or use different from that agreed upon.(Tria
v. People, G.R. No. 204755, September 17, 2014)
Where pieces of jewelry that were entrusted to the accused to
be sold for profit to her co-employees were instead pawned to various
pawnshops and individuals, estafa is committed. (Gamaro v. People,

Railroad Company, replacing it with his personal check of the same
amount, drawn on the Philippine National Bank. He directed the
cashier to hold the check and not to deposit it on the current bank
account of the Manila Railroad Company until the end of the month.
The appellant used the amount of P8.330.00 for his personal and
private purposes.
When the Insular Auditor made an examination of the accounts
of the Manila Railroad Company on July 1, 1921, the check of the
appellant was discovered and it was found out that it was carried in
the accounts as part of the cash on hand. An inquiry at the Philippine
National Bank disclosed that the appellant then had only P125.66
to his credit there, although later in the afternoon of that day, he
deposited on his current account with the Philippine National Bank,
the sum sufficient to cover the check.

Held: The appellant is guilty of estafa, even if he had no intention
to permanently misappropriate the funds to himself. The law is
clear and makes no distinction between permanent and temporary
misappropriations. (U.S. v. Sevilla, 43 Phil. 190)
Does momentary use by the agent of funds belonging to his
principal constitute estafa?

Since in the momentary use of the funds belonging to his
principal, the agent has no intention to defraud his principal, it
would seem that he is not liable for estafa. Article 315 begins with
the following words: “Any person who shall defraud another by any
of the means mentioned hereinbelow shall be punished by:” and
the paragraph immediately preceding the definition of estafa with
abuse of confidence states that “the fraud be committed by any of the
following means.”
As Article 315 is worded, fraudulent intent is a necessary
element of estafa.

The appellant was the treasurer of the Manila Railroad
Company. He took the sum of P8.330 out of the funds of the Manila

The crime of estafa under Article 315, paragraph 1(b), is not
committed when there is neither misappropriation nor conversion.
The fact that the accused spent only P39.55 for materials and
nothing for labor of the amount of P753.54 he had received from the
complainant for the purchase of materials and for the wages of the
laborers, does not in itself prove the crime of estafa.

There must be proof of misappropriation or conversion.
(Concepcion v. People, 74 Phil. 63)
The delay in the fulfillment of a trust or in the delivery of the

Bleibel, 34 Phil. 227)
Khitri v. People
(GR. No. 210192, July 4, 2016)

The essence of estafa committed with abuse of confidence is the
appropriation or conversion of money or property received to the prejudice
of the entity to whom a return should be made. The words "convert" and
“misappropriate" connote the act of using or disposing of another’s property
as if it were one’s own, or of devoting it to a purpose or use different from that
agreed upon. To misappropriate for one’s own use includes not only conversion
to one’s personal advantage, but also every attempt to dispose of the property
of another without right.
Here, Rosalinda received P400.000 for the purpose of constructing a
garments factory inside the Monte Vista Park Subdivision, Cainta, Rizal.
True to their agreement, she caused the erection of a two-door studio-type
apartment, one of which would serve as the garments factory. The private
complainants however posit that the structure was not in compliance with
their agreed plan. Nonetheless, the purpose of the money had been complied
with by the petitioners, albeit modified. The Court believes that the ends
sought to be achieved by the money have not been rendered illusory by the
modification. In fact, after the construction, the private complainants sent five
sewing machines for use in the garments factory, but these were subsequently
pulled out after two weeks for repairs.

The prosecution was not able to prove the existence of malicious intent
when the petitioners used the money they received to construct two-door
studio-type apartments, one of which would serve as the garments factory.
To reiterate, the purpose of the money was achieved.

When is an agent who gave to a sub-agent the thing received from
his principal, guilty of misappropriation or conversion?

The law on agency allows the appointment by an agent of a
substitute or sub-agent in the absence of an express agreement to
the contrary between the agent and the principal.

Examples:
1. The appointment of Labrador as petitioner’s sub-agent
was not expressly prohibited by Quilatan, as the acknowledgment
992

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 315

receipt does not contain any such limitation. Neither does it appear
that petitioner was verbally forbidden by Quilatan from passing on
the jewelry to another person before the acknowledgment receipt was

executed or at any other time. Thus, it cannot be said that petitioner’s
act of entrusting the jewelry to Labrador is characterized by abuse
of confidence because such an act was not proscribed and is, in fact,
legally sanctioned.

It was established that the inability of petitioner as agent to
comply with her duty to return either the pieces of jewelry or the
proceeds of its sale to her principal Quilatan was due, in turn, to
the failure of Labrador to abide by her agreement with petitioner.
Notably, Labrador testified that she obligated herself to sell the
jewelry in behalf of petitioner also on commission basis or to return
the same if not sold. In other words, the pieces of jewelry were given
by petitioner to Labrador to achieve the very same end for which they
were delivered to her in the first place. Consequently, there is no
conversion since the pieces of jewelry were not devoted to a purpose
or use different from that agreed upon. (Serona v. Court of Appeals,
G.R. No. 130423, November 18, 2002, 392 SCRA 35)
2. Where the agents to whom personal property was entrusted
for sale, conclusively proves the inability to return the same is solely
due to malfeasance of a sub-agent to whom the first agent had actually
entrusted the property in good faith, and for the same purpose for
which it was received; there being no prohibition to do so and the
chattel being delivered to the sub-agent before the owner demands
its return or before such return becomes due, we hold that the first
agent cannot be held guilty of estafa by either misappropriation or
conversion. The abuse of confidence that is characteristic of this
offense is missing under the circumstances. (Tabaniag v. People, GJi.
No. 165411, June 18, 2009)
3. It is well to note that there is no proof whatever to show
that the complainant had forbidden the accused to employ sub-agents.
The absence of prohibition and the uses of the trade implied authority
to appoint sub-agents as well as power to surrender temporarily
the possession of the jewels to the sub-agent, for no one could be
expected to purchase them without previous examination. (People v.
Nepomuceno, CA.., 46 O.G. 6131)
993

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Art. 315

If the agent acted in conspiracy or connivance with the one
who carried out the actual misappropriation, then the accused
would be answerable for the acts of his co-conspirators. If there is
no such evidence, direct or circumstantial, and if the proof is clear
that the accused herself was the innocent victim of her sub-agent’s
faithlessness, her acquittal is in order. (People v. Nepomuceno, G.R.
No., 9 CA 46 O.G 6128 [1949]; People v. Trinidad, 10 CA 53 O.G 731
[1956])

Withholding application of money received by agent

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 315

People u. Jumawan
(L-28060, February 27, 1970, 31 SCRA 825)

Facts: The accused retained the amount of P55.00 from his last
collections, since the accrued commissions in the larger amount of P65.00
due and payable to him for previous collections which he had turned over in
full to complainant had not been paid to him. The complainant, his principal,
failed to pay the accused either on account of his earned commissions or his
earned allowances at the rate of Pl.50 per day, which should have been paid
to him at the latest upon his turn-over of his collections. The reason for his
not being paid was the business losses of complainant.

Upon the question as to what circumstances will justify a party
so receiving money in withholding the application of the same to the
agreed purpose, no fixed rule is announced; and it is stated that each
case should be decided on its own particular facts, reference being
made primarily to the good or bad faith exhibited by the accused in
withholding the money from the use of which it was intended to be
applied.

Held: Under the circumstances, the accused, who was unjustly
exploited, is not criminally liable for his act of retaining the amount which
was even less than what was actually and honestly due and owing to him by
his principal. The complainant not having been damaged or prejudiced by
the act of the accused in retaining and setting off what was due to him, the
criminal action for estafa should be dismissed.

For this reason, a conviction for estafa under this paragraph of
Article 315 cannot be sustained against a person, be he agent, partner,
or what-not, who has in good faith retained the property committed
to his care for the purpose of necessary self- protection against his
principal in civil controversies arising between the two with reference
to the same or related matter. (U.S. v. Berbari, 42 Phil. 152; see also
the case of U.S. v. Santiago, 27 Phil. 408)

Thus, if A borrowed a ring from B to be used by the former on
a certain occasion and later, when B asked A to return it, the latter
denied having received it, A is guilty of estafa.
In the case of U.S. v. Yap Tian Jong, 34 Phil. 10, the accused
who denied having received a box of sinamay delivered to him by
mistake was convicted of estafa.

Right of agent to deduct commission from amounts collected.

Third element of estafa with abuse of confidence.

Can an agent with a right to a commission who collected money
for the principal be held liable for estafa, if he failed to turn over that
part of his collection to the latter?

The third element is that the misappropriation, conversion, or
denial by the offender has resulted in the prejudice of another.

It depends.
(1)

If the agent is authorized to retain his commission out
of the amounts he collected, there is no estafa. (People v.
Aquino, 52 Phil. 37)

(2)

Otherwise, he is guilty of estafa, because the right to a
commission does not make the agent a joint owner, with a
right to the money collected. (People v. Leacnon, 66 Phil737)

994

Estafa by denying having received the thing.

“To the prejudice of another” — not necessarily of the owner of
the property.
A handed his watch to B to be kept by him while A was engaged
in certain professional work in a circus. Instead of returning the
watch to A, B pawned it in a pawnshop for a loan of P100.00. A,
upon knowing it, immediately went to the pawnshop and recovered
it without any expense on his part. Is B guilty of estafa considering

that A suffered no damage?

995

Art. 315

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Held: It is immaterial whether the loss was suffered by the
owner or by a third person. Considering that in view of the literal
terms of the provision of Article 315, paragraph 1(b), which says
‘to the prejudice of another,” as well as its spirit and legal reason,
whenever damages are caused as a consequence of the appropriation
or conversion, the act constitutes the crime of estafa, even though
the person who suffered the damage is a third party and not the one
to whom the misappropriated or converted goods belong or to whom
they are to be returned, for this is an incidental element which in no
way affects the juridical nature of the crime. (Decision of the Supreme
Court of Spain, cited in People u. Yu Chai Ho, 53 Phil. 874)
Partnership - liability of partners for estafa.
When the money or property had been received by a partner for
specific purpose and he later misappropriated it, such partner is
guilty of estafa.
People v. De la Cruz
(G.R. No. 21732, September 3, 1924)

Facts: C and P formed a partnership for the purpose of purchasing and
selling pigs, P being the manager and C the industrial partner. P delivered
the sum of P2,999 to C, with instructions to go to Villasis, Pangasinan, and
after paying various debts to certain persons in that municipality, to invest
the remainder of the money in the purchase of pigs. C failed to make the
payment of the debts, failed to purchase pigs, and appropriated the money
for his own use.
Held: C is guilty of estafa, consisting in the fraudulent appropriation
of the money which had been delivered to him with specific instructions to
apply it to the uses of the partnership. This case is different from the case of
U.S. v. Clarin, 17 Phil. 84, because in that case, there was a mere failure on
the part of the industrial partner to liquidate the affairs of the partnership
and to pay over part of the profit to the capitalist partner.

In Liwanag v. Court of Appeals, 346 Phil. 211 (1997), three individuals
entered into a contract of partnership for the business of buying and selling
cigarettes. They agreed that one would contribute money to buy the cigarettes
while the other two would act as agents in selling, with a corresponding 40%
commission to the capitalist partner if the goods are sold; otherwise, the
money would be returned to her. The agent-partners stopped informing the
capitalist partner of business updates and all efforts to obtain information

regarding the business proved futile. A case for estafa was thus filed. The
Court held that when money or property (had) been received by a partner
for a specific purpose and he later misappropriated it, such partner is guilty
of estafa.

In Orbe v. Miaral, G.R. No. 217777, August 16, 2017, petitioner’s initial

contributions of P183.999 and P20,000 were all for specific purposes: for the

buying and selling of garments and for the salaries of the factory workers,
respectively. When respondent failed to account for these amounts or to
return these amounts to petitioner upon demand, the Court held that there
was probable cause to hold that respondent misappropriated the amounts
and had not used them for their intended purposes. The Information for
estafa should thus proceed.

A co-owner is not liable for estafa, but he is liable if, after the
termination of the co-ownership, he misappropriates the thing which
has become the exclusive property of the other.

Appellant induced Miguela Angel to buy the house of Martina
Nebre for P3.000. She offered to advance Pl,000.00, a portion of the
purchase price, provided Miguela would pay it back with interest.
Miguela agreed. Appellant then caused the notary public to write
the document of sale in her own name, instead of that of Miguela.
Subsequently, appellant sold the house to Simsuangco and retained
the price. Prior to said sale, however, Miguela had already paid
appellant the amount advanced by her, plus interest.

Held: Appellant is guilty of estafa. It will be observed that
there were two pivotal points against appellant in the matter of the
alleged swindling: (a) she caused the notary to write the document of
sale in her own name, instead of that of Miguela Angel; and (b) she
subsequently sold the property to Simsuangco and retained the price.
Now, bearing in mind that she had advanced a portion of the purchase
money delivered to Martina Nebre, the contention could be made that,
because she had some interest in the property, she committed no crime
in disposing of it, but only a civil wrong, if any. [The] [Court] find[s],
however, upon examination of the record that Miguela Angel repaid
her with interest, the amount so advanced, and that was prior to the
Simsuangco sale. (Mercado u. People, 61 O.G. 1666)

Note: At the time of the sale to Simsuangco, the accused had no
more interest in the property.

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Fourth element of estafa with abuse of confidence.
This is the only kind of estafa under Article 315, where demand
may be required. In estafa by means of deceit, demand is not necessary,
because the offender obtains delivery of the thing wrongfully from
the beginning. (U.S. v. Asensi, 34 Phil. 750, cited in People u. Scott,
62 Phil. 553) In estafa with abuse of confidence, the offender receives
the thing from the offended party under a lawful transaction.

The mere failure to return the thing received for safekeeping or
on commission, or for administration, or under any other obligation
involving the duty to make delivery or return the same or deliver the
value thereof to the owner could only give rise to a civil action and
does not constitute the crime of estafa. (U.S. v. Bleibel, supra; People v.
Nepomuceno, supra) And the circumstance that the appellants did not
appear anymore in complainant’s store and that complainant failed
to locate them did not dispense with the requirement of the law that
formal demand must be made on the accused to return the articles
received in trust or on commission, or to account for the proceeds of
their sale, before the action is filed. (People v. Bastiana, et al., C.A.,
54 O.G. 4300)

Demand is not necessary in estafa through misappropriation or
conversion.

Demand is not an element of the felony or a condition precedent
to the filing of a criminal complaint for estafa. Indeed, the accused
may be convicted of the felony under Article 315, paragraph 1(b) of
the Revised Penal Code if the prosecution proved misappropriation
or conversion by the accused of the money or property subject of the
Information. In a prosecution for estafa, demand is not necessary
where there is evidence of misappropriation or conversion. However,
failure to account upon demand, for funds or property held in trust,
is circumstantial evidence of misappropriation.
Demand need not be formal. It may be verbal.

charged of the offense. A query as to the whereabouts of the money,
such as the one proven in the case at bench, is tantamount to a
demand. (Lee v. People, G.R. No. 157781, April 11, 2005)

Demand is not required by law; but it is necessary, because
failure to account, upon demand, is circumstantial evidence of
misappropriation.
The facts clearly show that the sum of P6.000 belonging to
Quasha had been misappropriated by petitioner herein, for he
disappeared soon after receipt of said sum, in August, 1947, and
when, in 1948, Quasha found him at the Manila Hotel and inquired
what he had done with his (Quasha’s) money, petitioner merely said,
“that there was no use telling what happened,” but that he would try
to pay it back. Had said money been invested in rattan which later
on was spoiled, as appellant tried to prove, he would have said so,
instead of making to Quasha said statement, which, like his conduct
prior and subsequently thereto, implies that he had misappropriated
the funds entrusted to his custody.

It is urged that there can be no estafa without a previous demand,
which allegedly has not been made upon herein petitioner, but the
aforementioned query made to him by Quasha in Manila Hotel was
tantamount to a demand. Besides, the law does not require a demand
as a condition precedent to the existence of the crime of embezzlement.
It so happens only that failure to account, upon demand, for funds or
property held in trust, is circumstantial evidence of misappropriation.
The same may, however, be established by other proof, such as that
introduced in the case at bar. (Tubb v. People, et al., 101 Phil. 114)
Failure to account, upon demand, for funds or property held
in trust is circumstantial evidence of misappropriation. (People v.
Sullano, G.R. No. L-18209, June 30, 1966)

There Is no estafa through negligence.
Lim u. Court of Appeals

In Barrameda v. Court of Appeals, 372 Phil. 352 (1999), the
Court ruled that even a query as to the whereabouts of the money is
tantamount to a demand:
It must be noted that the specific word “demand” need not be
used to show that demand had, indeed, been made upon the person

Facts: Accused Lim was introduced to Suarez by Nadera and received
a bracelet and ring from Suarez to be sold on commission basis. When Lim
wanted to return the jewelry, Suarez instructed her to return the jewelry to
Nadera instead. Lim returned the jewelry to Nadera who gave her a receipt.

(G.R No. 102784, April 7, 1997)

Art. 315

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Lim later received a demand letter from Suarez demanding the return of the
ring and she replied that she had already returned the jewelry to Nadera and
thus had no more liability to Suarez for said jewelry. Suarez filed a complaint
for estafa against Lim under Article 315, paragraph 1(b).

Held: The act of Lim in returning the items to Nadera only shows that
she had reason to believe that the latter had the authority to receive the same.
This belief was inspired by the fact that at the time of the said transaction
between Lim and Suarez, it was Nadera herself, in behalf of Suarez, who
prepared the receipt to be signed by Lim. In addition, Nadera was the one
who introduced Suarez and Lim to each other. Hence, Lim can at most be held
negligent in returning the ring to one whose authority to receive the same
was subsequently refuted. Consequently, for negligently assuming Nadera’s
authority to receive the ring, Lim cannot be held criminally liable. Settled
it is in our jurisprudence that there can be no estafa through negligence.
In cases of estafa, the profit or gain must be obtained by the accused
personally, through his own acts, and his mere negligence in permitting
another to take advantage or benefit from the entrusted chattel cannot
constitute estafa under Article 315 paragraph 1 -b, of the Revised Penal Code;
unless of course the evidence should disclose that the agent acted in conspiracy
or connivance with the one who carried out the actual misappropriation,
when the accused would be answerable for the acts of his co-conspirators.
(People v. Nepomuceno, CA. 46 O.G 6128 [1949]; People u. Trinidad, CA
53 O.G 731 [1956])

“Even though such obligation be totally or partially guaranteed by
a bond."

This clause is used in paragraph (b), subdivision No. 1 of Article
315.
Thus, a mortgage executed by the agent or salesman or a surety
bond filed by the agent to answer for damages, advances, etc., does
not relieve him from criminal liability, for this undertaking refers
only to his civil liability. (People v. Leachon, 56 Phil. 737)
The gravity of the crime of estafa is determined on the basis of the
amount not returned before the institution of the criminal action.

In the crime of estafa, the gravity of the offense is not determined
by the value which accused has delivered or has returned to the
offended party after the criminal action is instituted, but by the value
which is not delivered or returned upon the obligation to do so and
before the institution of the criminal action. (People v Pagayon, 71

Phil. 337)

TITLE TEN

Art. 315

It is contended that since appellant had paid the sum of
P62.00 on account of the amount of P12.052.57, the remaining sum
of Pl1,990.57 should serve as the basis of determining the penalty
to be suffered by the appellant. Thus, it is argued that because the
amount embezzled by appellant does not exceed P12.000.00, his case
falls under the second paragraph of Article 315 of the Revised Penal
Code and he should therefore, be sentenced only to a minimum of
one year, eight months and twenty-one days and a maximum of two
years, eight months and ten days.
Held: There is no merit in this contention. It is a well-settled rule
in this jurisdiction that payment made subsequent to the commission
of the crime of estafa does not alter the nature of the crime committed
nor does it relieve the defendant from the penalty prescribed by law.
(Javier v. People, 70 Phil. 550)
Estafa with abuse of confidence, distinguished from theft

A person who misappropriated the thing which he had received
from the offended party may be guilty of theft, not estafa, if he
acquired only the material or physical possession of the thing.
In theft, the offender takes the thing; in estafa, the offender
receives the thing from the offended party.

If in receiving the thing from the offended party, the offender
acquired also the juridical possession of the thing, and he later
misappropriated it, he would be guilty of estafa.
The complainant having turned over the dollars to the accused in
the belief that the same could be changed into pesos, only the material
and transitory possession thereof was transferred thereby, the
juridical possession remaining with complainant, and the subsequent
misappropriation thereof by the accused makes him liable for theft,
and not estafa. (People v. Frias, CA., 66 O.G. 9411)
In estafa, the offender receives the thing — he does not take the
thing without the consent of the owner.

A was taking two large cattle to another town to sell them
there. On the way, A became acquainted with B who was also going
to sell a cow in that town. Taking advantage of the simplicity of A,
B represented himself to the purchasers to be the owner of the large
1001

Art. 316

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

cattle belonging to A and effected their sale, with A’s consent but
without the latter’s intervention except the delivery of the animals
to their respective purchasers. B absconded with the money received
by him from the purchasers. What crime was committed by B, theft
or estafa?
Held: Estafa. The two large cattle were taken by B with the
consent of A. B did not take the proceeds of the sale; he received
them from the purchasers. But B received the proceeds of the sale to
be held by him in trust for A. (See People v. Darpeng, CA..-G.R. No.
43650, January 18, 1937, V. L. J. 190)
Not theft, because there is no taking or abstracting of the thing
from anyone.

A is a tenant of several parcels of land. A entered into an
agreement with B, whereby the former was to contribute 3 1/2 cavans
of seed, several animals and implements, and an amount of money,
and sow the same, and B was to transplant the seed and take care of
and harvest the crop, the profits to be divided between them, share
and share alike, deducting the 30 cavans due to the owner of the
land and one-half of the expenses defrayed by A. When the crop was
harvested, B threshed the same and sold all the palay, without giving
A any share in the proceeds thereof.

Is the crime committed theft?
No. B was in possession of the palay. He did not take or abstract
the same from anyone. (U.S. v. Reyes, 6 Phil. 441)
The test to distinguish estafa from theft

In theft, upon the delivery of the thing to the offender, the owner
expects an immediate return of the thing to him. (Albert)
In the following cases, the owner expects the immediate return
of the thing by the offender:
1.

Certain Igorots who owned a bar of gold which they wanted
to sell and bank notes which they wanted to change into
silver coins gave them to the accused who promised to
take the bar of gold to a silversmith and have it examined
and to change the bank notes into silver coins, stating
1002

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 316

that she would return within a short time to report the
result. The accused who never returned, because she
disposed of them for her benefit, was found guilty of theft.
(U.S. v. De Vera, 43 Phil. 1000) In this case, the Igorots
would naturally expect the immediate return of their bar
of gold and bank notes, if the latter were not changed into
silver coins.

2.

The accused sold palay to the offended party who handed
to him a P100 bill. The accused said she had no change
and would step out for a moment to look for change. The
offended party agreed because she had to go to another
house, where she had also bought palay, in order to have
the cereals measured. When the offended party returned,
she was informed that the accused had left for another
town. She absconded with the money.

Held: The crime committed is theft. The juridical
possession was not transferred by delivery because there
was no agreement by which the accused could exercise a
better right of possession over the object received than the
owner herself, or had any right to dispose of said object in
a manner binding on the owner. (People v. Aquino, CA.,
36 O.G. 1886)

Note: The delivery of the P100 bill was only for the
moment and, with the express obligation on the part of the
accused to make immediate return of the same if it could
not be changed or else to give back to the offended party
an equivalent in bills or coins of smaller denominations.

When the owner does not expect the Immediate return of the thing he
delivered to the accused, the misappropriation of the same Is estafa.
Thus, in the case of U.S. v. Pascual, 10 Phil. 621, where the
accused appropriated the sum of P310.00 which had been entrusted
to, and received by him with the obligation of delivering it to a
third person, the owner of the money did not expect the immediate
return of it to him, because what he expected upon its delivery to the
accused, was that the latter would deliver it to the third person. The
crime committed by the accused is estafa. (See also the case of U.S.
v. Figueroa, 22 Phil. 270)
1003

Art. 315

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Exception:
When a servant received money or other personal property from
the master, with an obligation to deliver it to a third person and
instead of doing so, misappropriated it to the prejudice of the owner,
the crime committed is qualified theft.
Servant, domestic, or employee who misappropriates the thing he
received from his master or employer is not guilty of estafa.

A sum of money received by an employee on behalf of an
employer is considered to be only in the material possession of the
employee. (Matrido v. People, 610 Phil. 203, 214 [2009]) The material
possession of an employee is adjunct, by reason of his employment,
to a recognition of the juridical possession of the employer. So long
as the juridical possession of the thing appropriated did not pass
to the employee-perpetrator, the offense committed remains to be
theft, qualified or otherwise. Hence, conversion of personal property
in the case of an employee having mere material possession of the
said property constitutes theft, whereas in the case of an agent to
whom both material and juridical possession have been transferred,
misappropriation of the same property constitutes Estafa. (Matrido
v. People, 610 Phil. 203, 214 [2009])
Possession of agent distinguished from possession of teller of bank.

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 315

Selling the thing received to be pledged for the owner is theft, when
the intent to appropriate existed at the time it was received.

Thus, in a case where the accused, who received a ring from

the offended party for the purpose of pledging it as security for a

loan of P50.00 for the benefit of the offended party, sold it for P30.00
and spent for her own benefit the proceeds, it was held that she
committed theft, not estafa. The intent to appropriate the ring existed
at the time it was received from the owner, as shown by the fact that,
upon receiving the ring, she immediately offered it for sale. (People
v. Trinidad, 50 Phil. 65)

Estafa with abuse of confidence and malversation, distinguished.
1. In both crimes, the offenders are entrusted with funds or
property.

2.

Both are continuing offenses.

3.

But while in estafa, the funds or property are always private;
in malversation, they are usually public funds or property.

4.

5.

In estafa, the offender is a private individual or even a public

officer who is not accountable for public funds or property; in
malversation, the offender who is usually a public officer is
accountable for public funds or property.
In estafa with abuse of confidence, the crime is committed by

misappropriating, converting or denying having received money,
goods or other personal property; in malversation, the crime
is committed by appropriating, taking or misappropriating or
consenting, or, through abandonment or negligence, permitting
any other person to take the public funds or property.

There is an essential distinction between the possession by
a receiving teller of funds received from third persons paid to the
bank, and an agent who receives the proceeds of sales of merchandise
delivered to him in agency by his principal. In the former case,
payment by third persons to the teller is payment to the bank itself;
the teller is a mere custodian or keeper of the funds received, and has
no independent right or title to retain or possess the same as against
the bank. An agent, on the other hand, can even assert, as against his
own principal, an independent, autonomous right to retain the money
or goods received in consequence of the agency; as when the principal
fails to reimburse him for advances he has made, and indemnify him
for damages suffered without his fault. (Guzman v. Court of Appeals,
99 Phil. 704, citing Article 1915, New Civil CodeJ

When In the prosecution for malversation, the public officer
accountable for public funds is acquitted, the private individual
allegedly in conspiracy with him may be held liable for estafa.

1004

1005

In a prosecution for malversation [through] falsification of public

documents, where the indicted public officials who are accountable

for public funds are acquitted, thereby deleting the element of
accountability of public funds from the charge, if the information
avers conspiracy, the remaining accused who are not public officials

or are public officials not accountable for public funds are open to
conviction for estafa [through] falsification of public documents
This is because estafa [through] falsification of public documents
is necessarily included in a charge of malversation of public funds
[through] falsification of public documents. (People v. Salazar, et al
61 O.G. 5913, citing U.S. v. Solis, 7 Phil. 196, 197-198)
Misappropriation of firearms received by a policeman.

Where the accused policeman asked for the pistol of the offended
party, on the pretext that it should be delivered to the Detective
Bureau for examination, and that it would be returned in three days,
and once in possession of the pistol, he sold it, it was held that the
policeman was guilty of estafa. (People v. Bautista, CA., 48 O.G. 3430)

But a policeman, having custody of a firearm seized from a
person without permit to possess it, is guilty of malversation for the
disappearance of said firearm.

Example:

A left to B a blank paper with A’s signature with a request to
make a receipt for future payment to be made by a debtor; but instead,
B wrote thereon a vale for some merchandise in the name of A. B
made use of the merchandise for personal benefit. The vale so written
created a liability against A and would cause damage to him, because
the owner of the merchandise could make A pay for the value of the
merchandise delivered to B by reason of the vale.
The paper with the signature in blank must be delivered by the
offended party to the offender.

A was keeping blank papers with the signature ofB. C stole one
of them and wrote a document above the signature, creating liability
against B. What crime was committed?
Falsification, because C made it appear that B participated in
a transaction when in truth and in fact he did not so participate, or
attributed to B, a statement other than that made by him. This is
not estafa, because C, not having been entrusted with the signature
in blank, could not have acted with abuse of confidence, which is the
element of this form of estafa.
Estafa by means of deceit (Art 315, subdivisions Nos. 2 and 3)

By taking undue advantage of the signature of the offended
party in blank, and by writing any document above such signature
in blank, to the prejudice of the offended party or any third person.

1.

That the paper with the signature of the offended party be in

2.

That the offended party should have delivered it to the offender.

3.

That above the signature of the offended party a document is

There is no deceit if the complainant was aware of the fictitious
nature of the pretense.

Where the complainant was aware of the fictitious nature of the
pretense, there is no estafa through false pretenses. Thus, where the
charge of estafa was founded upon deceit, it being alleged that the
money of which the bank was defrauded was obtained by means of
false representation on the part of the accused Crisologo that he was
the owner of the tobacco covered by the quedans, but the manager
of the bank, who let the money out, knew that the tobacco was non¬
existent, the accused cannot be convicted of estafa by means of deceit.
(People v. Concepcion, 44 Phil. 544)
BY MEANS OF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING FALSE PRETENSES OR
FRAUDULENT ACTS EXECUTED PRIOR TO OR SIMULTANEOUSLY
WITH THE COMMISSION OF THE FRAUD:

By using fictitious name, or falsely pretending to possess
power, influence, qualifications, property, credit, agency, business or
imaginary transactions, or by means of other similar deceits. (Article
315, No. 2[aJ)

Art. 315

Thirty years thereafter, the rule remains the same. In the 1933

case of People u. Lilius, 59 Phil. 339, the Court acquitted the accused
of estafa because the deceit did not precede the defraudation, which

means that the deceit was not the cause which could have induced the

damage or prejudice to or loss of property suffered by the injured party.

In the cases of People v. Quesada, 60 Phil. 515 (1934), People
v. Fortuno, 73 Phil. 407 (1941) and People u. Sabio, 86 SCRA 568

(1978) which span more than another 45 years after Lilius, the

Court continued to apply the same principle in determining criminal
liability for estafa, i.e., that the deceit must have been committed
prior to or simultaneous with the fraudulent act because this was the
only way that said deceit could become the efficient cause or primary
consideration which could have induced the offended party to part
with his money or property.
The doctrine remains the same a hundred (100) years after the
1903 case of Mendezona. Thus, in the 2003 case of Alcantara v. Court
of Appeals, 416 SCRA 418, the Court acquitted the therein accused of
the crime of estafa explaining, that the false pretense or fraudulent act
must be committed prior to or simultaneously with the commission of
the fraud. (Gonzaludo v. People, G.R. No. 150910, February 6, 2006)
Estafa by using fictitious name.

There are three ways of committing estafa under the provisions.

(1)

by using fictitious name;

(2)

by falsely pretending to possess: (a) power, (b) influence,
(c) qualifications, (d) property, (e) credit, (0 agency, (g)

(3)

There is use of fictitious name when a person uses a name other
than his real name. Thus, when a person found a pawnshop ticket
in the name of another and, using the name of that other person,
redeemed the jewelry mentioned therein, he committed estafa by
using a fictitious name. (See People v. Yusay, 50 Phil. 598)

by falsely pretending to possess power.

Indispensable requirement for the application of Article 315, No.
2(a) — Deceit or false pretense must be the efficient cause which
induced offended party to part with his money or property.
As early as in the 1903 case of U.S. v. Mendezona, 2 Phil. 353
(1903), the Court held that therein accused may be convicted for estafa
only when the deceit or false pretenses, committed simultaneously
with the fraud, were the efficient cause or primary consideration
which induced the offended party to part with his money or property.

provided that B would offer prayers for the success of
the enterprise. By reason of that misrepresentation, B
delivered the carabao and accepted the worthless piece of
paper in payment thereof.

Held: A is guilty of estafa by falsely pretending that
the worthless piece of paper possessed power, a statement
which induced B to part with his carabao. (U.S. v. De los

Pretending to be a magician endowed with power to
discover hidden treasures, the accused led the offended
party to believe that under his house was ajar containing
articles of great value, but that to obtain that jar, it was
necessary for the offended party to give him Pl 50.00 for
the purchase of a certain substance and old gold coins to
be used in extracting the hidden treasure. After receiving
the money, the accused left and never returned.

Held: The accused committed estafa. (People v. Scott,

Estafa by falsely pretending to possess influence.

If the accused represented to the offended party, a Chinaman,
that he had influence in Malacahang, the Bureau of Immigration,
and the Department of Foreign Affairs, when in truth and in fact he
had no influence in any of said offices, and said representation was
made by him for the purpose of inducing the offended party, who was
interested in the entry of his family for permanent residence in the
Philippines, to give him money and the offended party gave him the
amount asked for his alleged services, which he later spent for his
own benefit, the accused is guilty of estafa.

TITLE TEN

Art. 315

Held: The accused was guilty of estafa. The basis of the penalty
is the value of the paper, not that of the land, because the loss of
the title deeds does not mean necessarily the loss of the land. This
case differs from that where the thing in controversy is a negotiable
instrument such as a promissory note or check. (U.S. v. Del Castillo,
35 Phil. 413)

Estafa by falsely pretending to possess property.
A ordered certain building materials from B on the pretense
that he was building a house and that he had sufficient funds to pay
in cash the value of said materials on completion of their delivery,
when in truth and in fact, he had no money. B could not recover the
materials because A disposed of them.

Held: A was guilty of estafa. (People v. Santos, 71 Phil. 490)
The act of the petitioner of deliberately and fraudulently
misrepresenting to the private complainants that Legarda Pine Home
of which he is the general manager, is the owner of the subject lot
in Baguio City on which townhouse units would be built and that he
has the right and authority to offer for sale the proposed townhouse
units, when in fact he has none, so that he could, as in fact he collected
money as downpayment for two townhouse units from the private
complainants and his failure to return the amounts that he had
collected from them despite several demands, and considering that
the townhouse units were never constructed, constitute the crime of
estafa as defined and penalized under Article 315, paragraph 2(a)
of the Revised Penal Code. (Montano v. People, G.R. No. 141980,
December 7, 2001)
A creditor who deceived his debtor Is Hable for estafa.

The offended party had a civil case in a justice of the peace
court involving his real estate. The accused, by means of false
representation that he was qualified in law to represent the offended
party in that civil case, succeeded in obtaining from the latter, the
title deeds of his lands. The accused later refused to redeliver them
on demand by the owner.

Appellant admits, among others, the evidence for the prosecution
to the effect that on January 31, 1964, he falsely represented to one
Illuminado Jaud that he had 200 cavans of palay for sale; that on
the following day, by means of that deceit and/or false pretense, he
succeeded in obtaining from Jaud the sum of P3,000 for the purchase
of the palay, that he had in fact no palay for sale to Jaud; that upon
reaching the place where the palay was indicated by appellant to be
taken from, Jaud found that the palay did not belong to appellant;

and that appellant absconded with the money and refused to return
the same.
In making this admission, appellant claims, however, that he
had merely conceived of a plan by which he could obtain from Jaud
the sum of P3,000 which was the amount of the latter’s indebtedness
to him. He thus argues that he cannot be convicted of estafa because
of the absence of criminal intent and/or the element of fraud since he
received only what complainant Jaud had owed him.

accused was guilty of estafa. (People v. Contreras, CA., 47 O.G. 782)
The accused falsely pretended to possess the agency of the depositor.

Art. 316

Held: [The Court] do[es] not share appellant’s view. Assuming to
be true that complainant had owed him that much, and the deceit was
merely employed by appellant as a means to collect from the former
although [the] [Court] [is] skeptical about the truth of this assertion
appellant nonetheless is clearly liable for the crime of estafa. If
it was wrong for the complainant to refuse to pay his obligation to
appellant, it was not right either for appellant to employ unlawful
means to enable him to collect. A wrong cannot justify another wrong.
Appellant’s contention that there is absence of criminal intent or fraud
is untenable. The plan, as conceived by him, if true, was precisely
bom of a desire to commit fraud. The plan itself carried a criminal
intent. (People v. Rubaton, C-A., 65 O.G. 5048, issue of May 19, 1969)

Estafa by falsely pretending to possess credit

In a case where the accused, by stating and representing
themselves to the employees of Sun Photo Supply that they were
merchants with credit, business and means with which to pay for
10 dozen rolls, Kodak film No. 116, valued at P72.00, succeeded in
inducing the employees of Sun Photo Supply to give and deliver, as
in fact the latter gave and delivered to said accused, the goods and
merchandise on credit, the accused knowing that their statements
and representations that they had credit, business and means were
false, and disappeared and absconded themselves with said goods
and merchandise, it was held that they were guilty of estafa. (People

Estafa by falsely pretending to possess business.
The accused, pretending to be engaged in the business of buying
and selling hogs, represented to the offended party that they (accused)
had purchased some hogs in Pampanga but could not secure delivery
because they were short of funds in the sum of P285.00 and that the
hogs could be sold in Manila at a profit. Because of this representation,
the offended party gave money. The accused in reality had no such
business and spent the money.
Held: The accused were guilty of estafa. (People v. Acufia, et al.,
58 Phil. 976)
A branch manager of an insurance company who still accepted
a fire insurance application despite his knowledge from newspapers
that the insurance company has been suspended is guilty of estafa for
not returning the premium he received. The deliberate concealment by
the petitioner of the fact that his company was no longer authorized
to engage in the business of insurance when he signed and issued the
fire insurance policy and collected the premium payment constitute
fraudulent representations or fraudulent pretenses. (Salcedo v. Court

with one another.

The elements of the crime of illegal recruitment in large scale

are:
(1) The accused undertook a recruitment activity defined under
Article 13(b) or any other prohibited practice under Article 34 of the
Labor Code.
(2) He did not have the license or the authority to lawfully
engage in the recruitment and placement of workers.
(3) He committed the same against three or more persons,
individually or as a group. (People v. Bautista, 241 SCRA 216 [1995])

Illustration.

All the elements of illegal recruitment in large scale are present:
First, accused has no license nor authority to recruit. Second,
accused undertook acts or activities coming within the definition of
recruitment and placement defined in Article 13(b) of the Labor Code
as amended. She enlisted, canvassed, promised and recruited the
offended parties and others in Baguio by representing [that] she has
the capacity to recruit. She promised them work abroad or promised to
deploy them for work abroad particularly in Canada or in Hong Kong
for a fee. She failed ultimately to deploy complainants abroad despite
their repeated follow-ups and being made to wait. Third, there were at
least four persons individually or as a group
who were recruited
by the accused. The four declared in court that they were recruited
for a fee by accused, actually paid their placement fees, pointed to,
and positively identified, accused as the one they transacted with.

People v. Sison
(G.R. No. 187160, August 9, 2017)

Facts: 1. Complainant Castuera is the nephew of Edna Magalona, a
teacher of police officers at Camp Crame where a certain Col. Sison was
one of the students. Col. Sison mentioned that his wife, accused Sison, can
facilitate papers for workers in Australia.
Magalona and Castuera met accused Sison who briefed Castuera
2.
on the requirements for working as a fruit picker in Australia and introduced
him to another man who related that he was able to go to Australia with
Sison’s help. She also showed Castuera pictures of other people she had
supposedly helped to get employment in Australia. Sison further narrated
that a couple she had helped had given her their car as payment. Because
of Sison’s representations, Castuera believed in her promise that she could
send him to Australia.

3.
Sison agreed to the fee of P160.000 for processing Castuera’s
papers and Castuera gave Sison P80,000 as down payment. Sison promised
Castuera that she would personally process his visa application. However,
Sison failed to secure an Australian visa. She then told Castuera that it was
easier to get an Australian visa from Malaysia. Later, she told Castuera that
his Australian visa was already in Malaysia and his personal appearance
was required there.
4.
In Malaysia, Castuera met other recruits of Sison as well as
Sison’s co-accused, Dedales and Bacomo. Castuera was told that the group

would be proceeding to Indonesia to process their Australian visas. The
group then left for Indonesia. Castuera’s application for an Australian visa
in Indonesia was denied. Dedales then told Castuera to apply for a U.S. visa
instead and asked for US$1,000 for the processing of his U.S. visa, which
Castuera paid. However, when his U.S. visa came, Castuera saw that it was
,n an Indonesian passport bearing an Indonesian name.

1016

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

TITLE TEN

Castuera decided to just return to the Philippines and asked for
5.
his US$1,000 back but Dedales would not return it. His Philippine passport
was also not returned immediately causing him to overstay in Indonesia.
He found out then that the extension papers that Dedales and Bacomo
procured for him were fake. Upon returning to the Philippines, Castuera filed
a complaint against Sison, Dedales, and Bacomo at the POEA. The agency
verified that Sison, Dedales, and Bacomo did not have any license or permit
to hire and recruit for overseas employment.

employment. Castuera believed that Sison had the same ability to send
him to Australia. He did not even ask for her authority or check for himself
with the POEA, relying instead on her word. This tells us that he was fully
convinced based on Sison’s representations.

Art. 315

Held.-. Accused are guilty of illegal recruitment and estafa under Article
315, paragraph 2(a) of the R.P.C.

—

Illegal Recruitment. The acts of Sison, Dedales, and Bacomo show
a common purpose and each undertook a part to reach their objective. Their
concerted action is evident in that either Sison or Dedales was receiving
payments from the recruits; that Dedales signed the acknowledgment
receipt from Sison; and that the three accompanied their recruits together in
seeking out their visas in Malaysia and Indonesia. Further, the impression
given to Castuera and other recruits was that the three were indeed working
together. Since it was proven that the three accused were acting in concert
and conspired with one another, their illegal recruitment activity is considered
done by a syndicate, making the offense illegal recruitment involving economic
sabotage.

—

Estafa.
All the elements of estafa by means of deceit under
Article 315(2Xa) of the R.P.C. are present. First, Sison misrepresented her
qualifications and authority to send Castuera to work in Australia. She
actively made Castuera believe that she had the ability to do so she showed
pictures of her “recruits," had one of them give a testimonial, and told him
stories to convince him of such ability. It did not matter that “they had no
agreement” that their transaction was for recruitment or deployment. All
her acts were calculated to convince Castuera that Sison was qualified to
send him abroad for employment. It is enough that she “gave the impression
that [she] had the power to send workers abroad for employment purposes.’

—

Second, Sison’s false representation was made prior to or simultaneous
to the commission of the fraud. Sison used these false representations to
convince Castuera that he would be able to go to Australia and be a fruit
picker, just like her other recruits. These representations were clearly mere
devices to convince Castuera, whom she only met at that time, that she was

a legitimate recruiter.

Third, Castuera relied on Sison’s representations. He believed that
she could send him to Australia because of the pictures and testimonials she
showed him. He also relied on the fact that his aunt knew Sison’s husband,
a police officer, adding to her trustworthiness. Sison banked on that trust to
convince Castuera to part with his money and be “recruited” into overseas
1016

Art. 315

Fourth, Sison’ s misrepresentation resulted in damage to Castuera. He
paid the P80,000 down payment that Sison required of him as processing
fee, but the purpose for which it was paid never materialized. Likewise,
Baid amount was never reimbursed to Castuera despite his demands for
its return.

The pretense must be false.

In estafa by means of deceit under subdivision 2(a) of Article

Malacafiang, the Bureau of Immigration and the Department of Foreign
Affairs. Upon this representation, Cua entered into an agreement with
Yee for the entry of his family for permanent residence in the Philippines
Cua gave P2.000 to Yee. After waiting for a long time without hearing from
Yee, Cua went to the Bureau of Immigration to check on the papers for the
entry of his wife and child, but he found that no such papers had been filed
Thereafter, he went to Yee’s office, inquired why no papers were prepared and
demanded the return of the money. Yee promised to give back the amount
but failed to do so.

Primelink released funds to finance the project’s initial expenses,
a portion of which Pamana was ordered to repay by a Makati court
after the project was aborted. These facts negate the conclusion that
on or before October 10, 1996, petitioner and Ragonjan knew that
the Club was a bogus project. At that time, the Project was on-course
as far as Primelink was concerned. It was only after October 10,
1996 that Primelink encountered problems with Pamana, rendering
impossible the Club’s completion. (Lopez v. People, G.R. No. 199294,
July 31, 2013)

Art. 316

Held: From the fact of non-compliance by appellant with his part of
the supposed agreement, the trial court concluded that his representation
that he possessed influence was false. The premises do not justify the
conclusion. Not a scintilla of evidence was adduced to prove that appellants
pretense of influence was not true and therefore fraudulent. In the absence
of proof that his representation was actually false, criminal intent to
deceive cannot be inferred. There is nothing in the record from which we
can infer that when he received the advance payment, the appellant had
no intention of rendering the service contracted by him, and since it was
not shown that he in fact possessed no influence nor that his inaction was
due to his lack of influence, he cannot justifiably be held guilty of deliberate
misrepresentation, and his failure or inability to render the service could
have been due to a change of mind, if not to a lawful cause. Non-performance
on his part and his failure to return the money give rise only to civil liability.
(Abeto v. People, 90 Phil. 581)

The facts that make the pretense false must exist prior to or
simultaneous with the execution of the fraud.

The Information filed against petitioner and Ragonjan alleges
that they conspired to use false pretense on Sy on October 10, 1996
that Subic Island Club would be developed by Primelink. Section
2(a) of Article 315, however, requires that the false pretense be used
“prior to or simultaneous with the execution of the fraud,” that is, on
October 10, 1996. The crux of this issue then, is whether before or at
that time, Primelink possessed no power (capability) to develop the
Club, rendering Ragonjan’s statement false. A review of the records
compels a negative answer. When Sy reserved to buy a Club share on
October 10, 1996, barely three months had passed after Primelink, a
duly incorporated real estate developer, signed the Agreement with
Pamana, another real estate developer, to develop the Club. Four
months after Sy bought a Club share, Primelink promoted the Club
here and abroad and continued selling Club shares. All the while,
1018

Art. 316

The offended party must be deprived of his property by any of the
false pretenses mentioned in paragraph 2(a).

The offender must be able to obtain something from the offended
party because of the false pretense, that is, without which the offended
party would not have parted with it.

This being a form of estafa by means of deceit, the false pretense
should be the efficient cause of the defraudation and, hence, it should
be made either prior to, or simultaneously with, the act of fraud.
Estafa by means of deceit and theft, distinguished.

The principal distinction between the two crimes is that in theft,
the thing is taken while in estafa, the accused receives the property
and converts it to his own use or benefit. However, there may be theft
even if the accused has possession of the property. If he was entrusted
only with the material or physical (natural) or de facto possession
of the thing, his misappropriation of the same constitutes theft, but
if he has the juridical possession of the thing, his conversion of the
same constitutes embezzlement or estafa. (Santos v. People, GJi. No.
77429, January 29, 1990, 181 SCRA 487)
Thus, where the accused, a credit and collection assistant of
a real estate company tasked to collect payments from buyers of
real estate properties, issue receipts, and remit the payments to the
company, failed to remit payments she received to the company,
qualified theft is committed. The accused did not have juridical
possession of the amounts received, in other words, she did not have
a right over the thing which she may set up even against company.
Since juridical possession was lodged with the company, estafa was
not committed. (Matrido v. People, supra)

amount, petitioner thereafter invested the same in Eurocan Future
Commodities. Clearly, petitioner employed deceit in order to take hold
of the money, misappropriated and converted it to his own personal
use and benefit, and these resulted to the damage and prejudice of
the bank in the amount of about P43 million. Taken in its entirety,
the proven facts show that petitioner could not have withdrawn the
money without falsifying the questioned documents. The falsification

Art. 315

A commission salesman who misappropriated the machines he
took back from prospective customers making them believe that in
retaking said machines he was acting on behalf of his employer when
in fact he was not, is guilty of theft, not estafa. The physical possession
secured by him did not vest in him the juridical possession necessary
for the crime of estafa. From a legal viewpoint, he had taken and
carried away the machines without the knowledge and consent of
the owner thereof. (People v. Maglaya, L-29243, November 28, 1969,
30 SCRA 606)
Estafa through falsification of commercial document

When the offender commits on a public, official or commercial
document any of the acts of falsification enumerated in Article 171
as a necessary means to commit another crime like estafa, theft or
malversation, the two crimes form a complex crime.
1. As a bank teller, accused took advantage of the bank
depositors who had trusted in her enough to leave their passbooks
with her upon her instruction. Without their knowledge, she filled out
withdrawal slips that she signed, and misrepresented to her fellow
bank employees that the signatures had been verified in due course.
Her misrepresentation to her co-employees enabled her to receive
the amounts stated in the withdrawal slips. She thereby committed
two crimes, namely: estafa, by defrauding BPI Family Savings, her
employer, in the various sums withdrawn from the bank accounts
of the bank’s clients; and falsification of a commercial document,
by forging the signatures of the bank’s clients in the withdrawal
slips to make it appear that the depositors concerned had signed the
respective slips in order to enable her to withdraw the amounts. Such
offenses were complex crimes, because the estafa would not have been
consummated without the falsification of the withdrawal slips. (De
Castro v. People, G.R. No. 171672, February 2, 2015)
2. The elements of estafa obtain in this case. By falsely
representing that Tan requested him to process purported Ioans on
the latter’s behalf, petitioner counterfeited or imitated the signature
of Tan in the cashier’s checks. Through these, petitioner succeeded
in withdrawing money from the bank. Once in possession of the
1020

Art. 315

was, therefore, a necessary means to commit estafa, and falsification

was already consummated even before the falsified documents were
used to defraud the bank. The conviction of petitioner for the complex

crime of Estafa through Falsification of Commercial Document is
proper. (Tanenggee v. People, G.R. No. 179448, June 26, 2013)

No complex crime of falsification of private documents and estafa.

There is no complex crime of estafa through falsification of a
private document considering that the damage essential to both is the
same. As a result, having such offenses compounded or complexed in
accordance with Article 48 of the R.P.C. is disallowed. We reiterate
the pronouncement made in Batulanon v. People, G.R. No. 139857,
September 15, 2006, 502 SCRA 35, to wit:

As there is no complex crime of estafa through falsification
of private document, it is important to ascertain whether the
offender is to be charged with falsification of a private document
or with estafa. If the falsification of a private document is
committed as a means to commit estafa, the proper crime
to be charged is falsification. If the estafa can be committed
without the necessity of falsifying a document, the proper
crime to be charged is estafa. Thus, in People v. Reyes, 56 Phil.
286 (1931), the accused made it appear in the time book of the
Calamba Sugar Estate that a laborer, Ciriaco Sario, worked 21
days during the month of July, 1929, when in reality he had
worked only 11 days, and then charged the offended party, the
Calamba Sugar Estate, the wages of the laborer for 21 days.
The accused misappropriated the wages during which the
laborer did not work for which he was convicted of falsification
of private document.

In U.S. v. Infante, 36 Phil. 146 (1917), the accused changed
the description of the pawned article on the face of the pawn ticket
and made it appear that the article is of greatly superior value, and
1021

Art. 315

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

thereafter pawned the falsified ticket in another pawnshop for an
amount largely in excess of the true value of the article pawned. He
was found guilty of falsification of a private document. In U.S. u
Chan Tiao, 37 Phil. 78 (1917), the accused presented a document of
guaranty purportedly signed by Ortigas Hermanos for the payment
of P2.055 as the value of 150 sacks of sugar, and by means of said
falsified documents, succeeded in obtaining the sacks of sugar, was
held guilty of falsification of a private document. (Co v. People, G.R.
No. 233015, October 16, 2019)
Estafa through false pretense made in writing is only a simple crime
of estafa, not a complex crime of estafa through falsification.
People v. Samonte Vda. de Guia
(105 Phil. 1288)

Facts: The defendant, as unremarried widow of Rufino de Guia, who had
died in action in Corregidor, had applied for, and was subsequently granted,
by the Government of the United States, a pension and the benefits of a life
insurance. Although admittedly she later married one Aniano F. Gili, and
she knew that this fact extinguished her rights to said pension and benefits,
she kept on cashing the checks sent to her therefor by the U.S. Veterans
Administration, which had not been notified of her remarriage.
Held: The checks in question were made payable to “Adelaida Samonte
Vda. de Guia as unremarried widow of Rufino de Guia,” and that in order
to collect the amount of said checks she had to write on the back thereof
“Adelaida Samonte Vda. de Guia as unremarried widow of Rufino de Guia.”
She thus misrepresented that she was still the “unmarried widow of Rufino
de Guia,” not only by using this specific expression, but also by adding to her
maiden name the phrase “Vda. de Guia,” instead of signing, either as Mrs.
Aniano F. Gili, or as Adelaida Samonte Gili, or as Adelaida Gili. She had to
resort to said misrepresentation in order to cash each check and thus collect
what she knew was not due to her, thereby defrauding the offended party.
Consequently, the defendant is clearly guilty of estafa.

Attempted estafa through forgery.

After forging one-eight (1/8) unit of the Philippine Charity
Sweepstakes ticket, by altering a figure thereon and making it appear

Fraud in estafa by means of deceit must be proved with clear and
positive evidence.
People v. Salapare
(CA., 56 O.G. 4039)

The prosecution contends that the appellant falsely represented to the
complainant the real status of the car, because at the time it was offered
to him, the appellant made him understand that he bought the car for his
personal use and that it was not in any way encumbered. On this point, the
testimony of complainant finds no corroboration on record. On the other hand,
[the) [Court) ha[s] the positive assertion of the appellant to the effect that he
made no misrepresentation whatsoever regarding the car. The declaration
of the appellant to this effect, was corroborated by his witness, who averred,
among others, that he heard the appellant tell the complainant that the
purchase price on the car was not then fully paid.

If the bargain was bad, the complainant was simply unfortunate.
“The foolish may lose all they have to the wise; but that does not
mean that the law will give it back to them again. Courts cannot follow
one every step of his life and extricate him from bad bargains, protect
him from unwise investments, relieve him from one-sided contracts, or
annul the effects of foolish acts. Courts cannot constitute themselves
guardians of persons who are not legally incompetent." (Vales v. Villa,
35 Phil. 769)
[The Court] [is], therefore, of the belief that there having been no
misrepresentation and/or concealment regarding the status of the car in
question, on the part of the appellant, no criminal liability attaches to the
transactions under consideration. Fraud, being an essential element of estafa
under subsection 2(a), Article 315, R.P.C., must be proved with clear and
positive evidence.

Estafa “by means of other similar deceits.”

Deceit, not covered by any of those specifically mentioned in

subdivision 2, paragraph (a), but similar to any of them, may give
rise to estafa under that phrase “by means of other similar deceits.”

In presenting a deed of donation mortis causa, known to be
vitiated by lack of consent, to the Office of the Register of Deeds to
register the same and to secure new transfer certificates of title in
her name, the accused in effect falsely represented that the deed was

validly executed and the lots described therein actually donated to
her. She thereby committed estafa by means of other similar deceits.

when in truth and in fact the offender intended to convert the money
to his own personal use and benefit.
Thus, a person who obtains money from another by falsely
pretending that with that money he will bribe the doctor in charge of
the physical examination of the offended party so as to declare him
unfit for compulsory service in the Army, is guilty of estafa under
this paragraph.
But if he really gives the money to the doctor, the crime is
corruption of public officer.

The estafa by altering the quality, fineness, or weight of anything
pertaining to his art or business may be illustrated in the case of a
jeweler who, for instance, defrauded a person who had delivered to
him a diamond and piece of gold to be made into a ring by changing
the stone with one of lower quality.
Fraudulent manipulation of scale is punished under the Consumer
Act of the Philippines.

The fraudulent alteration of any scale, balance, weight or
measure after it is officially sealed is prohibited under the Consumer
Act of the Philippines. (Art. 64[h], R.A. No. 7394) It is also prohibited
for any person, assuming to determine truly the weight or measure
of any article bought or sold by weight or measure, to fraudulently
misrepresent the weight or measure thereof. (Art. 64[k], R.A. No.
7394)

By pretending to have bribed any Government employee, without
prejudice to the action for calumny which the offended party may deem
proper to bring against the offender. In this case the offender shall be
punished by the maximum period of the penalty. (Art. 315, No. 2[c])

Note that in addition to the crime of estafa, the offender may still
be liable for the crime of defamation which the government employee
allegedly bribed may deem proper to bring against the offender.
Estafa by means of fraudulent acts.
The acts must be fraudulent

The acts must be fraudulent, that is, the acts must be
characterized by, or founded on, deceit, trick, or cheating.
Note that while in false pretenses the deceit consists in the use
of deceitful words, in fraudulent acts the deceit consists principally
in deceitful acts.
This being also estafa by means of deceit, the fraudulent acts
must be performed prior to or simultaneously with the commission
of the fraud.

Like in other forms of deceit, the offender must be able to obtain
something from the offended party because of the fraudulent acts,
that is, without which, the offended party would not have parted
with it.

This is committed by any person who would ask money from
another for the alleged purpose of bribing a government employee,

line of subsection (d) is an error in the English translation, and that
the provision does not apply exclusively to postdated checks.

Estafa by postdating a check or issuing a check in payment of an
obligation.

The act of signing a check with a fictitious name and falsely
pretending that said check could be cashed at the bank, the accused
knowing that it could not be cashed, and on the strength of such
false pretense the accused obtained from the offended party a certain
amount in exchange for the worthless check, constitutes estafa by
means of false pretense under paragraph 2(a), and not estafa by
postdating or issuing a check under paragraph 2(d) of Article 315.
(People v. Bisquera, CA., 51 O.G. 248)

Thus, when a check was issued in payment of a debt contracted
prior to such issuance, there is no estafa, even if there is no fund in the
bank to cover the amount of the check. (People v. Lilius, 59 Phil. 339)
The reason for the rule is that deceit, to constitute estafa, should
be the efficient cause of the defraudation as such should be either
prior to, or simultaneously with, the act of fraud. (People v. Fortuno,
73 Phil. 407)
The crime of estafa under Article 315, paragraph No. 2(d),
R.P.C., notwithstanding the amendment, remains and continues to
be a form of swindling by means of deceit. The phrase “prior to, or
simultaneously with, the commission of the fraud” indicates that
to constitute this form of estafa, the fraudulent act of postdating or
issuing a check in payment of an obligation should be the efficient
cause of defraudation and as such it should be either prior to, or
simultaneously with, the act of fraud, x x x. The offender must be
able to obtain money or other property from the offended party
because of the issuance and delivery of a check, whether postdated
or not, that is, the latter would not have parted with his money or
other property were it not for the issuance of check. (People v. Cua,
C.A., 72 O.G. 3182)

If the check is falsified and the same is cashed with the bank, or
exchanged for cash, the crime committed is estafa through falsification
of a commercial document.

The rule that the issuance of a bouncing check in payment of a pre*
existing obligation does not constitute estafa has not at all been
altered by the amendatory act. (R.A. No. 4885)

The check must be postdated or issued in payment of an obligation
contracted at the time of the issuance and delivery of the check.

The phrase “By postdating a check, or issuing such check in
payment of an obligation” in Article 315, No. 2(d), is not changed by
R.A. No. 4885, except that the word “such” is replaced by the article

Under Article 315(2)(d) of the R.P.C., as amended by R.A. No.

When check is issued in substitution of a promissory note, ft is in

Art. 315

The accused must be able to obtain something from the offended
party by means of the check he Issues and delivers.
Thus, if A bought from the store of B goods worth P200.00

and issued a worthless check for P200.00 in payment of the same,
it appearing that B would not have delivered the goods to A were it
not for the check issued by the latter, the crime committed by A was
estafa. Note that A obtained the goods from B because of the check.

Thus, when a person purchased merchandise, signed a
promissory note therefor, and on the date of maturity he gave a check
for the amount stated in the promissory note, but the check was
dishonored by the bank for lack of funds, that person is not liable for
estafa. (People v. Canlas, CA., 38 O.G. 1092)

lack of funds, it was held that the accused was guilty of estafa. (Ang
Tek Lian v. Court of Appeals, 87 Phil. 383) Note that the accused was
able to obtain the P4,000 because of the check he issued.

When accused did not have to assure the payee that checks would
be sufficiently funded on maturity, there is no estafa.

Exception: When the check issued is not “in payment of an
obligation.”

To constitute estafa under Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the
R.P.C., the issuance of a check should be the means to obtain money
or property from the payee. (People v. Reyes, 454 SCRA 635, 647
[2005]) In Hagan v. People, 454 SCRA 635, 647 (2005), therein accused
was charged with estafa for indorsing postdated checks which were
dishonored on maturity. In acquitting the accused, the Court noted
that he and the payee had been priorly engaged for four years in
rediscounting transactions hence; the Court held that it would have
been unnecessary for the accused to assure the payee that the checks
would be sufficiently funded on maturity to convince her to change
them with cash.
In the case at bar, it is gathered that during her transactions
since 1991 with Nenit, appellant usually issued postdated checks after
jewelry was turned over to her and that in fact some of the postdated
checks previously issued were dishonored but were not made subject
of criminal complaints. Appellant did not thus have to assure Nenit
when she issued on November 15, 1994 Check No. 001260A postdated
December 30, 1994 that it would be funded on maturity to convince
her to part off with the jewelry. In other words, the issuance of the
check was not the means to obtain the jewelry. Appellant did not thus
employ fraud. Ergo she did not commit estafa. (People v. Cardenas,

G.R. No. 178064, February 10, 2009)

Pacheco o. Court of Appeals
(G.R. No. 126670, December 2, 1999)

Facts: Petitioners obtained a loan of PIO,000 from Mrs. Vicencio.
Instead of merely requiring a note of indebtedness, her husband Mr.
Vicencio required petitioners to issue an undated check as evidence of
the loan which allegedly will not be presented to the bank. Despite being
informed by petitioners that their bank account no longer had any funds,
Mrs. Vicencio insisted that they issue the check, which according to her was
only a formality. Thus, petitioner Virginia issued an undated check. Mrs.
Vicencio also required Virginia’s husband, petitioner Ernesto Pacheco, to sign
the check on the same understanding that the check is not to be encashed.
The same arrangement was made for succeeding loans as required by Mrs.
Vicencio with the same assurance that the checks shall not be presented for
payment but shall stand only as evidence of indebtedness in lieu of the usual
promissory note. When the balance of the loan in the amount of P15,000
became due and demandable, petitioners were not able to pay. On August
3, 1992, Mrs. Vicencio together with her husband and their daughter went
to petitioners’ residence to persuade Virginia to place the date “August 15,
1992” on two checks that were given undated to Mrs. Vicencio on May 17,
1989 and July 21, 1989. The first check was required by Mrs. Vicencio to be
dated as additional guarantee for the P15.000.00 unpaid balance allegedly
under the second check. Despite being informed by petitioner Virginia that
their account had been closed as early as August 17, 1989, Mrs. Vicencio and
her daughter insisted that she place a date on the checks allegedly so that it
will become evidence of their indebtedness. The former reluctantly wrote the

date on the checks for fear that she might not be able to obtain future loans
from Mrs. Vicencio. On August 29, 1992, petitioners received a demand letter
from Mr. Vicencio informing them that the checks were dishonored due to
“Account Closed” when presented for payment on August 25, 1992. Upon the
complaint of Mr. Vicencio with whom petitioners never had any transaction
two informations for estafa under Article 315(2Xd) of the Revised Penal Code
were filed against petitioners.

Under subparagraph (d), paragraph 2, Article 315 of the R.P.C.,
as amended by R.A. No. 4885, it is not necessary that the drawer
should know at the time that he issued the check that the funds
deposited in the bank were not sufficient to cover the amount of the
check. (People v. Bool, etal., 18 CA. Rep. 741) R.A No. 4885 merely
established the prima facie evidence of deceit and eliminated the

Art. 315

Held: It is clear that the checks were not intended for encashment with
the bank, but were delivered as mere security for the payment of the loan and
under an agreement that the checks would be redeemed with cash as they
fell due. Hence, the checks were not intended by the parties to be modes of
payment but only as promissory notes. Since complainant and his wife were
well aware of that fact, they cannot now complain there was deception on the
part of petitioners. Awareness by the complainant of the fictitious nature of
the pretense cannot give rise to estafa by means of deceit. When the payee
was informed by the drawer that the checks are not covered by adequate
funds it does not give rise to bad faith or estafa.

When the check is issued by a guarantor, there is no estafa.

When the accused was persuaded to act merely as a guarantor
by guaranteeing by means of a check, the payment of the materials
ordered by another person, a fact which was known to the vendor of the
materials, and the check issued was dishonored for lack of funds, the
accused is not guilty of estafa. The check was not issued in payment
of an obligation. (People v. Suarez, 2 CA. Rep. 982)

Art. 315

requirement that the drawer inform the payee that he had no funds
in the bank or the funds deposited by him were not sufficient to cover
the amount of the check. (Villarta v. Court of Appeals, 150 SCRA 336)

Prima facie evidence of deceit.

The failure of the drawer of the check to deposit the amount
necessary to cover his check within three days from receipt of notice
from the bank and/or the payee or holder that said check has been
dishonored for lack or insufficiency of funds shall be prima facie
evidence of deceit constituting false pretense or fraudulent act.
(Second sentence of R.A. No. 4885)

It will be noted that if the drawer of the check is able to deposit
the amount necessary to cover his check within three days from
receipt of notice that said check has been dishonored, he is not liable
for estafa.
The explanatory note of Senate Bill No. 413, which became RA.

No. 4885 states:

The mere fact that the drawer had insufficient or no funds in the
bank to cover the check at the time he postdated or issued a check, is
sufficient to make him liable for estafa.

“It is true that a check may be dishonored without any
fraudulent pretense or fraudulent act of the drawer. Hence,
the drawer is given three days to make good the said check by
depositing the necessary funds to cover the amount thereof.
Otherwise, a prima facie presumption will arise as to existence
of fraud, which is an element of the crime of estafa.’

Republic Act No. 4885 eliminated the phrase “the offender knowing
that at the time he had no funds in the bank.”

Good faith is a defense in a charge of estafa by postdating or
issuing a check.

In view of the elimination of that phrase, it is not now a
defense that the drawer, through oversight, did not know that he
had insufficient or no funds in the bank when he postdated or issued
the check. He should verify first the amount of his deposit before
postdating or issuing a check.

The prima facie presumption of deceit was successfully rebutted
by appellant’s evidence of good faith, a defense in estafa by postdating
a check. Good faith may be demonstrated, for instance, by a debtor’s
offer to arrange a payment scheme with his creditor. In this case,
the debtor not only made arrangements for payment; as complainant

“When the offender had no funds in the bank, or his funds

amount of the dishonored checks. (People v. Ojeda, G.R. Nos. 10423858, June 3, 2004)

Thus, where the accused issued a postdated check, believing
in good faith that he would be able to deposit in the bank, sufficient

funds to pay said check when presented for collection, but, contrary
to his expectations, was unable to make the necessary deposit, he
cannot be held guilty of the crime of estafa, it appearing that a few
days before the due date, foreseeing his inability to raise the amount
of the check, the accused went to see the complainant and asked him
not to present the check to the bank for collection, and at the same
time offered to pay the amount thereof in installments, to which the
latter agreed. (People v. Villapando, 56 Phil. 31)
Stopping payment of check.

While there are times in business transactions when one is
justified in stopping payment of checks issued by him, if checks were
issued by defendant and he received money for them and stopped
payment and did not return the money and if at the time the check
was issued, he had the intention of stopping payment, he is guilty of
estafa. (U.S. v. Poe, 39 Phil. 466)
DAIF and DAUD, distinguished.

DAUD means that the account has, on its face, sufficient funds
but not yet available to the drawer because the deposit, usually
a check, had not yet been cleared. DAIF, on the other hand, is a
condition in which a depositor’s balance is inadequate for the bank
to pay a check. In other words, in the case of DAUD, the depositor
has, on its face, sufficient funds in his account, although it is not
available yet at the time the check was drawn, whereas in DAIF,
the depositor lacks sufficient funds in his account to pay the check.
Moreover, DAUD does not expose the drawer to possible prosecution
for estafa and violation of BP 22, while DAIF subjects the depositor
to liability for such offenses. (Bank of Philippine Islands v. Suarez,
G.R. No. 167750, March 15, 2010)
The person who uses the check may also be liable.

One who got hold of a check issued by another, knowing that
the drawer had no sufficient funds in the bank, and used the same

Art. 315

61 Phil. 332)

Petitioner’s act in negotiating directly and personally the post¬
dated check issued by his co-accused and then obtaining value from

complainant through deceit and fraudulent representations, is the
efficient cause which constitute estafa under paragraph 2(d) of Article
315 of the R.P.C. Though he did not issue nor indorse the post-dated
checks, he is still liable for estafa because of his guilty knowledge that
his co-accused had no funds in the bank when he negotiated it. (Zagado
v. Court of Appeals, 178 SCRA 146)

The payee or person receiving the check must be defrauded.

The payee or person who received the check must be damaged

It should be noted that B.P. Big. 22 punishes the making or
drawing and issuing of any check that is subsequently dishonored,
even in payment of pre-existing obligation, as indicated in Section 1
thereof by the phrase “to apply on account.” Section 1 also punishes
the making or drawing and issuing of a check that is subsequently

dishonored, in payment of an obligation contracted at the time of

the issuance of the check, as indicated by the words “for value.” In
the latter case, is the person who made or drew and issued the check

Assemblyman Estelito Mendoza, who authored B.P. Big. 22
expressed the view that “if he issues a check in payment (of) or
contemporaneously with incurring an obligation, then he will be liable
not only for estafa but also for violation of this Act.” His reason is
that “[t]he Supreme Court in several cases has decided that where
there is a variance between the elements of an offense in one law and
another law, there will be no double jeopardy.” He cited the element
of damage in estafa, which is not required in B.P. Big. 22.

drawer to avoid criminal liability.
The order to the bank to stop payment of the check must be

Art. 316

In view of the purpose of the enactment of B.P. Big. 22, the crime
defined and penalized there is against public interest, while the crime

not have sufficient funds in or credit with the drawee bank for the
payment of such check in full upon its presentment.
If he had sufficient funds in or credit with the drawee bank at
the time he issued the check, but later he withdrew all his funds
from or lost credit with the drawee bank, is he liable if the check is
subsequently dishonored? Under the first paragraph of Section 1, he
is not liable, because at the time he issued the check, he knew that
he had sufficient funds in or credit with the drawee bank. Note the
words “knowing at the time of issue." But he may be liable under the
second paragraph of Section 1, if he fails to keep sufficient funds or
to maintain a credit to cover the full amount of the check.
Effect of order to stop payment.

What is the effect of ordering the bank to stop payment of the
check without any valid reason upon the liability of the drawer or
maker who issued the check? If the drawer or maker had in fact no
sufficient funds or credit, and the check would have been dishonored
for that reason had not the drawer or maker ordered the bank to stop
payment, he is liable.

It is no defense then that the drawer of the check ordered the
bank to stop payment, if he had no sufficient funds or credit and the
check would have been dishonored had he not made the order. The
1036

Art. 316

Illustration: There was a mistake in naming the payee of the
check; the drawer ordered the bank to stop payment; and it appeared
that the drawer knew at the time the check was issued that he had
no sufficient funds in the bank. In this case, the drawer is not liable,
even if the check would have been dishonored for insufficiency of funds
had he not ordered the bank to stop payment, because there was a
valid reason (wrong payee) for ordering the bank to stop payment.
It is no defense either that the check was not actually dishonored,
for the fourth element mentions two alternatives, namely: (1) that
the check is subsequently dishonored, or (2) that it would have been
dishonored had not the drawer ordered the bank to stop payment.
Hence, the possibility that the check would have been dishonored
by the drawee bank for insufficiency of funds or credit had not the
drawer, without any valid reason, ordered the bank to stop payment,
is sufficient.
As regards the offense defined in the second paragraph of
Section 1, it is no defense that when he made or drew and issued
the check, the drawer had sufficient funds in or credit with the
drawee bank. What the second paragraph of Section 1 punishes is
the failure of the drawer to keep sufficient funds in the drawee bank
or to maintain a credit to cover the full amount of the check.

Presentment of check after 90 days.
Suppose that the drawer had kept sufficient funds in the drawee
bank for 100 days from the date appearing thereon to cover the check
he had issued. The next day he withdrew all the funds. When the
check was presented later on that day to the drawee bank, it was
dishonored. Is the drawer liable? No. The check was not presented
within a period of 90 days from the date appearing thereon.

Persons liable, when check issued by a corporation.
Batas Pambansa Big. 22 specifies the person or persons liable
when the check is drawn by a corporation, company, or entity. The

considers such payment of the dishonored checks to have obliterated

the criminal liability of petitioner. (Lim v. People, G.R. No. 190834,

November 26, 2014)

Payment as a B.P. Big. 22 defense.
1. The prima facie presumption that the drawer has
knowledge of the insufficiency of funds or credit at the time of the
issuance, or on the presentment for payment, of the check might be
rebutted by payment of the value of the check either by the drawer
or by the drawee bank within five banking days from notice of the
dishonor given to the drawer. The payment could thus be a complete
defense that would lie regardless of the strength of the evidence
offered by the prosecution. (Meriz v. People, G.R. No. 134498,
November 13, 2001)

Other B.P. Big. 22 Defenses.
1. The exercise of a statutory right to suspend installment
payments under P.D. No. 957 (Sycip, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, GJi.
No. 125059, March 17, 2000)-,

Generally, only the full payment of the value of the
dishonored check during the five-day grace period would exculpate the
accused from criminal liability under B.P. Big. 22. However, in Tan
v. Philippine Commercial International Bank, 575 Phil. 485 (2008),
the Court elucidated that:

Delivery of the checks, despite the subsequent failure to encash
them within a reasonable time after its issue, discharges the issuer
from his obligation to pay and he can no longer be pronounced civilly
liable for the amounts indicated thereon. (Evangelista v. Screenex,
Inc., GJI. No. 211564, November 20, 2017)

In Griffith v. Court of Appeals, the Court held that were
the creditor had collected more than a sufficient amount to
cover the value of the checks representing rental arrearages,
holding the debtor’s president to answer for a criminal offense
under B.P. Big. 22 two years after the said collection is no
longer tenable nor justified by law or equitable considerations.
In that case, the Court ruled that albeit made beyond the grace
period but two years prior to the institution of the criminal
case, the payment collected from the proceeds of the foreclosure
and auction sale of the petitioner’s impounded properties, with
more than a million pesos to spare, justified the acquittal of the

3.

Failure to encash checks within a reasonable time;

Prior to the presentment for payment and the subsequent
demand letters to petitioner, there was already a lawful Order from
the SEC suspending all payments of claims. It was incumbent on
him to follow that SEC Order. He was able to sufficiently establish
that the accounts were closed pursuant to the Order. The SEC Order
also created a suspensive condition. When a contract is subject to a
suspensive condition, its birth takes place or its effectivity commences
only if and when the event that constitutes the condition happens
or is fulfilled. Thus, at the time private respondent presented the
September and October 1997 checks for encashment, it had no right
to do so, as there was yet no obligation due from petitioner. (Gidwani
v. People, G.R. No. 195064, January 15, 2014)

However, where the presentment for payment and the dishonor
of the checks took place before the Petition for Suspension of Payments
for Rehabilitation Purposes was filed with the SEC, there was already
an obligation to pay the amount covered by the checks. The criminal
action for the violations of B.P. Big. 22 was filed for failure to meet
1039

this obligation. The criminal proceedings were already underway
when the SEC issued an Omnibus Order creating a Management
Committee and consequently suspending all actions for claims against
the debtor therein. (Tiong v. Co, G.R. No. 133608, August 26, 2008

the act to be punished thereunder not only that the accused issued a

Art. 315

5. Check signatory had no knowledge of insufficiency of funds
in corporate account.
Where the check signatory did not have actual knowledge of
the insufficiency of funds in the corporate accounts at the time she
affixed her signature to the checks that were subsequently dishonored
because the scope of her duties and responsibilities did not encompass
the funding of the corporation’s checks and her duties were limited
to the marketing department of the Binondo branch, she may not be
held liable under B.P. 22. (Lao v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 119178,
June 20, 1997)

Art. 315

The notice of dishonor required by B.P. Big. 22 to be given to the
drawer, maker or issuer of a check should be written. If the service of

the written notice of dishonor on the maker, drawer or issuer of the

dishonored check is by registered mail, the proof of service consists not
only in the presentation as evidence of the registry return receipt but
also of the registry receipt together with the authenticating affidavit of
the person mailing the notice of dishonor. Without the authenticating
affidavit, the proof of giving the notice of dishonor is insufficient unless
the mailer personally testifies in court on the sending by registered
mail. (Resterio v. People, G.R. No. 177438, September 24, 2012)

Notice of dishonor, required.

Notice of dishonor is required under both paragraph 2(d), Article
315 of the R.P.C. and Section 2 of B.P. Big. 22. While the R.P.C.
prescribes that the drawer of the check must deposit the amount
needed to cover his check within three days from receipt of notice
of dishonor, B.P. Big. 22, on the other hand, requires the maker or
drawer to pay the amount of the check within five days from receipt
of notice of dishonor. Under both laws, notice of dishonor is necessary
for prosecution (for estafa and violation of B.P. Big. 22). Without proof
of notice of dishonor, knowledge of insufficiency of funds cannot be
presumed and no crime (whether estafa or violation of B.P. Big. 22)
can be deemed to exist. (People v. Ojeda, G.R. Nos. 104238-58, June
3, 2004)

Lack of written notice of dishonor is fatal.

Section 2 of B.P. Big. 22 does not state that the notice of dishonor
be in writing. However, when taken in conjunction with Section 3
of the law, i.e., “that where there are no sufficient funds in or credit
with such drawee bank, such fact shall always be explicitly stated
in the notice of dishonor or refusal,” a mere oral notice or demand to
pay would appear to be insufficient for conviction under the law. Both
the spirit and letter of the Bouncing Checks Law would require for
1040

Service via registered mall of notice of dishonor, how shown.

Receipts for registered letters and return receipts do not prove
themselves; they must be properly authenticated in order to serve
as proof of receipt of the letters. (Central Trust Co. v. City of Des

Moines, 218 NW 580)

It must appear that the same was served on the addressee
or a duly authorized agent of the addressee. In fact, the registry
return receipt itself provides that “[a] registered article must not
be delivered to anyone but the addressee, or upon the addressee’s
written order, in which case the authorized agent must write the
addressee’s name on the proper space and then affix legibly his own
signature below it.” (Ting v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 140665,
November 13, 2000)
The prosecution failed to sufficiently prove the actual receipt by
the petitioner of the demand letter sent by Tan. No witness testified
to authenticate the registry return card and the signature appearing
thereon. The return card provides that the letter was received by one
Rolando Villanueva, without even further proof that the said person
was the petitioner’s duly authorized agent for the purpose of receiving
the correspondence. The failure of the prosecution to prove the receipt

by the petitioner of the requisite written notice of dishonor and that
she was given at least five banking days within which to settle her
account constitutes sufficient ground for her acquittal. (De la Cruz
v. People, G.R. No. 163494, August 3, 2016)

the drawee bank to honor his check. By virtue of the aforequoted
provision of law, petitioner is not entitled to be given a notice of
dishonor. (Lopez v. People, G.R. No. 166810, June 26, 2008)

Notice of dishonored required even for closed accounts.

No disputable presumption of knowledge of insufficiency of funds
when there is no receipt of notice of dishonor.

The Court has decided numerous cases where checks were
dishonored for the reason, “Account Closed” and held that “it is
essential for the maker or drawer to be notified of the dishonor of
her check, so she could pay the value thereof or make arrangements
for its payment within the period prescribed by law” and omission
or neglect on the part of the prosecution to prove that the accused
received such notice of dishonor is fatal to its cause. (Yu Oh v. Court
of Appeals, G.R. No. 125297, June 6, 2003)
Notice of dishonor, not required when account was closed even
before issuance of check.

The absence of proof as to receipt of the written notice of dishonor
notwithstanding, the evidence shows that petitioner had actual notice
of the dishonor of the check because he was verbally notified by the
respondent and notice whether written or verbal was a surplusage
and totally unnecessary considering that almost two months before
the issuance of the check, petitioner’s current account was already
closed. Under these circumstances, the notice of dishonor would have
served no useful purpose as no deposit could be made in a closed
bank account.

Pertinently, Section 114(d) of the Negotiable Instruments Law
provides:

-

Sec. 114 - When notice need not be given to drawer.
Notice of dishonor is not required to be given to the drawer in
either of the following cases:
XXX

d.

Where the drawer has no right to expect or require
that the drawee or acceptor will honor the check.

Since petitioner’s bank account was already closed even before
the issuance of the subject check, he had no right to expect or require
1042

The absence of proof that drawer received any notice informing
her of the fact that her checks were dishonored and giving her five
working days within which to make arrangements of payment of the
said checks prevents the application of the disputable presumption
that she had knowledge of the insufficiency of her funds. Absent
such presumption, the burden shifts to the prosecution to prove
that the drawer had knowledge of the insufficiency of funds when
the drawer issued the checks; otherwise, the drawer cannot be held
liable under the law. (Caras v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 129900,
October 2, 2001)
Where there is insufficient proof that notice of dishonor was
received, the presumption of knowledge of insufficiency of funds
cannot arise.

The evidence shows that the prosecution proved that a notice
of dishonor was sent to petitioner through registered mail. The
prosecution presented a copy of the demand letter and properly
authenticated the registry return receipt. However, it is not enough
for the prosecution to prove that a notice of dishonor was sent to the
petitioner. It is also incumbent upon the prosecution to show “that
the drawer of the check received the said notice because the fact of
service provided for in the law is reckoned from receipt of such notice
of dishonor by the drawee of the check.” ( Cabrera v. People, 454 Phil.
759, 774 [2003])

A review of the records shows that the prosecution did not prove
that the petitioner received the notice of dishonor. Registry return
cards must be authenticated to serve as proof of receipt of letters sent
through registered mail. Thus, [the Court] held:

... it must appear that the same was served on the

addressee or a duly authorized agent of the addressee. In fact,
the registry return receipt itself provides that ‘[a] registered
article must not be delivered to anyone but the addressee, or
1043

Art. 315

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

upon the addressee’s written order, in which case the authorized
agent must write the addressee’s name on the proper space and
then affix legibly his own signature below it.’ (Ting v. Court of
Appeals, 398 Phil. 481, 494 [2000])

The presentation of the registry card, with an unauthenticated
signature, does not meet the required proof beyond reasonable doubt
that the petitioner received such notice, especially considering that he
denied receiving it. As there is insufficient proof that the petitioner
received notice of dishonor, the presumption that he had knowledge
of insufficiency of funds cannot arise. (Suarez v. People, G.R. No.
172573, June 19, 2008)
Notice of dishonor to corporation Is not notice to officer who issued
the check.

If the drawer or maker is an officer of the corporation, the notice
of dishonor to the said corporation is not notice to the employee or
officer who drew or issued the check for and in its behalf. (Marigumen
v. People, G.R. No. 153451, May 26, 2005) Responsibility under B.P.
Big. 22 is personal to the accused; hence, personal knowledge of the
notice of dishonor is necessary. Consequently, constructive notice to
the corporation is not enough to satisfy due process. (Lao v. Court of
Appeals, 274 SCRA 572 [1997])
Policy of the Supreme Court on the matter of the imposition of
penalties for violation of B.P. Big. 22.

“Section 1 of B.P. Big. 22 (An Act Penalizing the Making or
Drawing and Issuance of a Check Without Sufficient Funds for Credit
and for Other Purposes) imposes the penalty of imprisonment of not
less than 30 days but not more than one year OR a fine of not less
than but not more than double the amount of the check, which fine
shall in no case exceed P200.000, OR both such fine and imprisonment
at the discretion of the court.

In its decision in Eduardo Vaca v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No.
131714, November 16, 1998, 298 SCRA 656, 664, the Supreme Court
(Second Division) per Mr. Justice Vicente V. Mendoza, modified
the sentence imposed for violation of B.P. Big. 22 by deleting the
penalty of imprisonment and imposing only the penalty of fine in
an amount double the amount of the check. In justification thereof,
the Court said:
1044

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 315

Petitioners are first time offenders. They are Filipino
entrepreneurs who presumably contribute to the national
economy. Apparently, they brought this appeal, believing in all
good faith, although mistakenly, that they had not committed
a violation of B.P. Big. 22. Otherwise, they could simply
have accepted the judgment of the trial court and applied
for probation to evade a prison term. It would best serve the
ends of criminal justice if in fixing the penalty within the
range of discretion allowed by SI, par. 1, the same philosophy
underlying the Indeterminate Sentence Law is observed,
namely, that of redeeming valuable human material and
preventing unnecessary deprivation of personal liberty and
economic usefulness with due regard to the protection of the
social order. In this case, (the Court] believe[s] that a fine in an
amount equal to double the amount of the check involved is an
appropriate penalty to impose on each of the petitioners.’
In the recent case of Rosa Lim v. People, G.R. No. 130038,
September 18, 2000, the Supreme Court en banc, applying Vaca also
deleted the penalty of imprisonment and sentenced the drawer of the
bounced check to the maximum of the fine allowed by B.P. Big. 22,
i.e., P200.000.00, and concluded that ‘such would best serve the ends
of criminal justice.’
All courts and judges concerned should henceforth take note
of the foregoing policy of the Supreme Court on the matter of the
imposition of penalties for violation of B.P. Big. 22.” (Supreme Court
Administrative Circular No. 12-2000, November 21, 2000)
Rule of preference in imposing penalties in B.P. Big. 22.

Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 13-2001 issued
on February 14, 2001 clarified that the clear tenor and intention of
Administrative Circular No. 12-2000 is not to remove imprisonment
as an alternative penalty, but to lay down a rule of preference in the
application of the penalties provided for in B.P. Big. 22.

Administrative Circular No. 13-2001 further clarified that

“Administrative Circular No. 12-2000 establishes a rule of preference

in the application of the penal provision of B.P. Big. 22 such that where
the circumstances of the case, for instance, clearly indicate good faith
or a clear mistake offset without taint of negligence, the imposition
1045

Art 316

of fine alone should be considered as the more appropriate penalty.
Needless to say, the determination of whether the circumstances
warrant that imposition of fine alone rests solely upon the judge.
Should the judge decide that imprisonment is the more appropriate
penalty, Administrative Circular No. 12-2000 ought not to be deemed
a hindrance.”
In the case of Tan, et al. v. Mendez, Jr., G.R. No. 138669, June
6, 2002, the Supreme Court reiterated that (a) Supreme Court
Administrative Circular No. 12-2000, as clarified by Administrative
Circular No. 13-2001, merely established a rule of preference in
imposing penalties in B.P. Big. 22 cases, and (b) there was no intention
to decriminalize B.P. Big. 22. It was held:
“Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 12-2000, as
clarified by Administrative Circular No. 13-2001, established a
rule of preference in imposing penalties in B.P. Big. 22 cases.
Section 1 of B.P. Big. 22 imposes the following alternative
penalties for its violation, to wit: (a) imprisonment of not
less than 30 days but no more than one year; or (b) a fine of
not less but not more than double the amount of the check
which fine shall not exceed P200.000; or (c) both such fine and
imprisonment at the discretion of the court.

“The rationale of Administrative Circular No. 12-2000 is
found in our ruling in Eduardo Vaca v. Court of Appeals and
Rosa Lim v. People of the Philippines. [The Court] held in those
cases that it would best serve the ends of criminal justice if, in
fixing philosophy underlying the Indeterminate Sentence Law
is observed, i.e., that of redeeming valuable human material
and preventing unnecessary deprivation of personal liberty
and economic usefulness with due regard to the protection of
the social order.

“To be sure, it is not our intention to decriminalize
violation of B.P. Big. 22. Neither is it our intention to delete
the alternative penalty of imprisonment. The propriety and
wisdom of decriminalizing violation of B.P. Big. 22 is best
left to the legislature and not this Court. As clarified by
Administrative Circular No. 13-2001, the clear tenor and
intention of Administrative Circular No. 12-2000 is not to
remove imprisonment as an alternative penalty, but to lay

Imprisonment imposed, Instead of fine.
(1)

Imprisonment was imposed an accused who issued the

postdated checks even though he had no more account with the

drawee bank, having closed it more than four years before he drew
and delivered the check, since he manifested utter lack of good faith
or wanton bad faith. (Nagrampa v. People, G.R. No. 146211, August

6, 2002)

(2) Accused’s act of issuing the 50 and the 64 bouncing checks
is a serious offense. To impose only fine would be to depreciate the
seriousness of his malefactions. The importance of arresting the
proliferation of bouncing checks cannot be overemphasized. (Lim u.
People. G.R. No. 143231, October 26, 2001)

Subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency must be expressly
stated in the judgment of conviction.

Administrative Circular No. 13-2001 provides that “should only a
fine be imposed and the accused be unable to pay the fine, there is no
legal obstacle to the application of the Revised Penal Code provisions
on subsidiary imprisonment.” However, the Circular does not sanction
indiscriminate imposition of subsidiary imprisonment for the same
must still comply with the law.

Where the judgment of conviction did not provide subsidiary
imprisonment in case of failure to pay the penalty of fine, subsidiary
imprisonment may not be imposed without violating the R.P.C. and
the constitutional provision on due process. (People v. Alapan, GJi.

Presumption of drawer's knowledge of insufficient funds.

It will be noted that B.P. Big. 22 requires that the person who
makes or draws and issues a check must have knowledge at the time
of issue that he does not have sufficient funds in or credit with the
drawee bank.
Section 2 establishes prima facie evidence of knowledge of such
insufficiency of funds or credit. The making, drawing and issuance
of a check, payment of which is refused by the drawee because of
insufficient funds in or credit with such bank, is prima facie evidence
of knowledge of insufficiency of funds or credit, when the check is
presented within 90 days from the date of the check.

In People v. Laggui, supra, it was held that the maker’s
knowledge of the insufficiency of his funds is legally presumed from
the dishonor of his check for insufficiency of funds.
Exceptions:

b.

When the check is presented after 90 days from the date
of the check.
When the maker or drawer pays the holder thereof the
amount due thereon, or makes arrangements for payment
in full by the drawee of such check within five banking
days after receiving notice that such check has not been
paid by the drawee.

The presumption of knowledge of insufficiency of funds or credit
does not lie when the check is presented after 90 days from the date
of the check, because Section 2, which establishes the presumption,
requires that the check be presented within 90 days from the date
of the check.

1048

Art. 316

The element of knowledge of insufficiency of funds or credit is

either

—

(1)

pays the holder of the check the amount due thereon
within five banking days after receiving notice that such
check has not been paid by the drawee; or

(2)

makes arrangements for payment in full by the drawee
of such check within five banking days after notice of
nonpayment.

Prima facie evidence does not arise where notice of nonpayment
is not sent to the maker or drawer of the check.

If notice of nonpayment by the drawee bank is not sent to the
maker or drawer of the bum check, or if there is no proof as to when
such notice was received by the drawer, then the presumption or
prima facie evidence as provided in Section 2 of B.P. Big. 22 cannot
arise, since there would simply be no way of reckoning the crucial
five-day period. (Danao v. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. No. 122353,

If the drawee bank received an order to stop payment from
drawer,
the former shall state in the notice that there were no
the
sufficient funds in or credit with it for the payment in full of the check,

if such be the fact.

In all prosecutions under B.P. Big. 22, the introduction in
evidence of any unpaid and dishonored check with the drawee’s
refusal to pay stamped or written thereon, or attached thereto, shall
be prima facie evidence of

—

(1)

the making or issuance of the check;

(2)

the due presentment to the drawee for payment and the
dishonor thereof; and

(3)

the fact that the same was properly dishonored for the
reason written, stamped or attached by the drawee on
such dishonored check.

The prosecution has to present in evidence only the unpaid
and dishonored check with the drawee’s refusal to pay stamped
or written thereon, or attached thereto. It would not be necessary
to prove the making or issuance of the check by the drawer; the
due presentment of the check to the drawee for payment and
the dishonor thereof; and the fact that the same was properly
dishonored for the reason written, stamped, or attached by the
drawee on the dishonored check.

SEC. 5. Liability under the Revised Penal Code.

—

liability for violation of any provision of the Revised Penal

Code.

Issuing a check in payment of an obligation, which is
subsequently dishonored, may be punished under the R.P.C. and
under B.P. Big. 22. Such act of issuing a check without or with
insufficient funds in the bank may be punished under both laws.
There is no double jeopardy if each statute requires proof of an
additional fact which the other does not. Hence, an acquittal or
conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from
prosecution or conviction under the other. (U.S. v. Capurro, et al.,
7 Phil. 24)

In estafa under Article 315, No. 2(d), R.P.C., as amended by RA.
No. 4885, the act constituting the offense is postdating or issuing a
check in payment of an obligation when the offender had no funds in
the bank or his funds deposited therein were not sufficient to cover
the amount of the check.
The mere fact that the drawer had insufficient or no funds in
the bank to cover the amount of the check at the time he postdated
or issued it, is sufficient to make him liable for estafa.

Deceit is an element of estafa and may be presumed from the

failure of the drawer to deposit the amount necessary to cover the
check within three days from receipt of notice of dishonor for lack
or insufficiency of funds in the bank. Deceit is not required in B.P.
Big. 22.

There must be damage in estafa, the same being the basis of
the penalty.

The penalty for the commission of any of the acts penalized in
Section 1 of B.P. Big. 22 is fixed without regard to the amount of the

May the drawer who was acquitted or convicted under the Revised
Penal Code for estafa be prosecuted under B.P. Big. 22?

Estafa by obtaining food or accommodation at a hotel, etc.

Yes. While B.P. Big. 22 requires the drawer’s knowledge of lack
or insufficiency of funds in the drawee bank at the time of issuance
of the check, the R.P.C. does not require such knowledge. Hence, the
acquittal or conviction of the drawer under the R.P.C. is not a bar to
his prosecution or conviction under B.P. Big. 22, because the latter
law requires the additional fact of the drawer’s knowledge of lack or
insufficiency of funds. (U.S. v. Capurro, et al., supra)

Art. 316

Estafa by inducing another to sign any document

Distinguished from the case of U.S. v. Capu/e, 24 Phil. 12.

Elements:

A couple who owned a tract of land, desired and told the accused
to draw up a power of attorney to represent them in court in a pending
suit involving said property. But the accused, without the knowledge
and consent of the couple, caused a document to be prepared setting
forth a sale in his favor and made it appear therein that the same
was executed by the spouses as vendors.

(1)

That the offender induced the offended party to sign a

document.
(2)

That deceit be employed to make him sign the document.

(3)

That the offended party personally signed the document.

(4)

That prejudice be caused.

There must be an inducement.
The offender must induce theoffended party to sign the document
If the offended party is willing and ready from the beginning to sign
the document and there is deceit as to the character or contents of
the document, because the contents are different from those which
the offended party told the accused to state in the document, the
crime is falsification.
Deceit must be employed.

Where the complainants alleged that they signed a conveyance
of their hereditary interest to the accused, thinking that the same
was a power of attorney, but it appeared that no misrepresentation
was made by the accused, he was not guilty of estafa. The remedy of
the complainants would be a civil action.
There can be no conviction for estafa under this paragraph in
the absence of proof that the defendant made statements tending to
mislead the complainant as to the character of the document executed
by him. (U.S. v. Barnes, 3 Phil. 704)
Example of estafa by inducing another to sign document

While a person was detained and anxious to obtain liberty, the
accused induced him through fraud and deceit to sign what was
represented to him to be a mortgage deed of his land for the purpose
of securing the payment of attorney’s fees, whereas the instrument
was really an absolute conveyance of the property. (U.S. v. Berry, 6
Phil. 370)

1054

Held: Falsification by attributing to the couple statements other
than those in fact made by them.
In U.S. v. Malong, 36 Phil. 821, where the crime committed was
held to be estafa, the accused made misrepresentations to mislead the
complainants as to the character of the documents executed by them.
The distinction seems to be that in the case of U.S. v. Berry,
the accused induced by means of deceit the offended party to sign
the document; whereas, in the case of U.S. v. Capule, there was
no inducement, for the offended party was willing and ready from
the beginning to sign the document in the belief that it contained
statements made by them.

In falsification by attributing to persons who have participated
in an act or proceeding statements other than those in fact made
by them, the offended party made statements to be embodied in a
document, but the offender, in preparing the document, attributed
to the offended party, statements different from those made by the
latter.

gambling game. (Art. 315, No. 3[b])

by the accused, and causing the offended party to lose Pl,140
on the first game with the supposed rich friend and telling
the offended party to play again and recover their losses, and
on the second game, instead of recovering, the offended party
lost again in the amount of P600.00, realizing only too late
that she was being fooled in the games by the accused and
his confederate, is estafa under Article 315, paragraph 3(b).

commits malicious mischief, not estafa, because the intention of the
culprit is not to defraud. (Guevara)
He is guilty of malicious mischief, because he deliberately causes
damage to the record of the court with evil motive. (See Art. 327)
Examples of this kind of estafa:

1.

The rule in Civil Law that no action can be filed on an
immoral or illegal contract (Art. 1141, C.C.) has no application
in the prosecution for estafa, even if the offended party

Some moments before the cockfight, the accused removed the
gaff from one of the gamecocks and replaced it in an entirely
different manner from that in which it was before, without
the knowledge and consent of its owner. In that manner the
gamecock was fixed, it could not inflict mortal wounds on and
kill its opponent. As a result, the owner lost his bet of P100.00.
(U.S. v. Ner, 18 Phil. 534)

By removing, concealing or destroying, in whole or in part, any
court record, office files, documents or any other papers, {krt. 315,

Estafa by removing, concealing, or destroying documents.

Elements of this kind of estafa:

Concealing document or any other paper.

A person who concealed a document evidencing a deposit
of P2.600, which came into his possession when he offered to
collect the deposit, is guilty of estafa. It is not necessary to
inquire whether as a matter of fact the complainant has ever
succeeded in collecting the deposit or not. The extent of the
fraud in this case should be graded according to the amount
which the document represents. (U.S. v. Tan Jenjua, 1 Phil.

consented to the fraudulent scheme.
2.

Art. 315

39)

2.

Destroying documents.

Destruction of promissory note given back to the maker to
be replaced with a new one to renew the loan, without making
a new promissory note is estafa because by destroying the old
one, the offended party was dispossessed of the evidence of a
debt. (U.S. v. Kilayko, 31 Phil. 371)

A bookkeeper who destroyed the chits evidencing his purchases
on credit of merchandise from his employer, so he could avoid
payment is guilty of estafa through falsification. (People v. Dizon,
47 Phil. 350)

1.

That there be court record, office files, documents or any other
papers.

Is the act of destroying a promissory note, given to cover losses
in gambling, by the maker thereof estafa?

2.

That the offender removed, concealed or destroyed any of them.

3.

That the offender had intent to defraud another.

In the case of U.S. v. Gomez Ricoy, 1 Phil. 595, it was held that
where the maker of a promissory note, given to cover losses incurred
at monte in a gambling house, obtains possession of his note and
conceals or destroys it, he is prima facie guilty of estafa.
A dissenting Justice stated that such promissory note has no
value, intrinsic or extrinsic; it is void and cannot be ratified; it cannot
therefore be the subject of estafa.

If there is no intent to defraud, the act of destroying court record
will be malicious mischief.
Thus, a person who destroys the record of a criminal case for
the purpose of affording immunity to the persons accused therein,

3.

The crime of infidelity in the custody of documents, as defined
in Article 226, and this kind of estafa are similar in that the
manner of committing the offenses is the same.
But while under Article 226, the offender is a public officer who
is officially entrusted with the document; in this kind of estafa,
the offender is a private individual or even a public officer who
is not officially entrusted with the documents.

In estafa, there is intent to defraud. This element is not
required in infidelity in the custody of documents.

Crimes Against Property

the latter suffers damage, the remedy is a civil action, not a criminal
action for estafa.
Damage or prejudice capable of pecuniary estimation.

This is the second element of any form of estafa.
The element of damage or prejudice may consist in:

1. The offended party being deprived of his money or property,
as result of the defraudation;

Elements of deceit and abuse of confidence may co-exist

It will be noted that in general, estafa is committed either by
means of deceit or with abuse of confidence. (U.S. v. Rivera, 23 Phil.
383)

But deceit may co-exist with abuse of confidence in the
commission of estafa. Thus

—

A intervened as a mediator between B and C in a transaction
of sale. A told B, the owner of the property, that C would buy it for
P500.00, when in truth and in fact, C was buying it for P600.00. When
C paid through A, the latter gave B only the P500.00, pocketing the
P100.00. (See U.S. v. Lim, 36 Phil. 682)
Inducing the complainant to deliver to the accused the
complainant’s dollar bills on the false pretext of changing them
with Philippine pesos at the rate of P4.00 to each dollar bill, with
the obligation of giving the Philippine pesos to the complainant or
of returning the dollar bills if these could not be so exchanged and
once in possession of the dollar bills the accused disappeared under
the false pretense that he was just going out to buy something and
instead misappropriated the dollar bills, is estafa under subparagraph
Cb), paragraph 1 of Article 315 of the R.P.C. (People v. Franco, C.A.,
64 O.G. 1790)
If there 1s no deceit, no abuse of confidence, there Is no estafa, even
if there is damage; there Is only civil liability.

When a person has received from another, a thing without deceit
or has disposed of the thing received without abuse of confidence, u
1058

Art. 315

2.

Disturbance in property rights; or

3.

Temporary prejudice.

Disturbance in property rights.
Thus, the fact that the typewriter which had been rented from
the offended party was sold to another person by the accused, made
him liable for estafa, even if the typewriter was recovered by the
owner, because the complainant at least suffered disturbance in his
property rights in the said typewriter and in the possession thereof.
(U.S. v. Goyenechea, 8 Phil. 117)
Payment made subsequent to the commission of estafa does not
extinguish criminal liability or reduce the penalty.

Payment made subsequent to the commission of the crime of
estafa does not alter the nature of the crime committed nor does
it relieve the defendant from the penalty prescribed by law. The
partial payment made subsequent to the commission of estafa does
not reduce the amount actually misappropriated, which is the basis
of the penalty. (Javier v. People, 70 Phil. 550)

The basis of the penalty in estafa is the amount or the value of
the property misappropriated and not delivered or returned before
the institution of the criminal action. (People v. Pagayon, 71 Phil.
337)

Acceptance of partial payment by the offended party or the
amount misappropriated by the accused is not one of the means of
extinguishing criminal liability under Article 89. (People v. Gervacio,
102 Phil. 687)
1059

Art 315

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The crime of estafa is not obliterated by acceptance of promissory
note.

When the offended party in an estafa case accepts a promissory
note of the accused for the repayment of the money already converted,
the offense is not thereby obliterated. ( Camus v. Court of Appeals
92 Phil. 85)
Temporary prejudice.

The accused pretended to be an agent of a company. He offered
to sell a filter to the complainant who was prevailed upon to buy it.
He issued a check for P20.00. The accused promised to deliver the
filter on the same day. When the filter was not delivered on time,
the complainant telephoned the company. Learning that the accused
was not an agent there, the complainant notified the bank to suspend
payment. The accused never presented it for payment.

Held: The check was payable to “cash” and, therefore, negotiable.
While the accused had said check in his possession, the offended party
could not dispose of the amount. (People v. Santiago, 54 Phil. 814)
A private person who procures a loan by means of deceit through
a falsified public document of mortgage, but who effects full
settlement of the loan within the period agreed upon, does not
commit the crime of estafa.

Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code provides thus:
“Any person who shall defraud another by any of the

means mentioned herein below shall be punished . . .”

There can be no estafa unless there is a person defrauded. In
the instant case, the supposed aggrieved party received complete
payment of the loan presumably within the period agreed upon.
Insofar as she was concerned, there had been no disturbance of
her proprietary rights. That being the case, no estafa has been
committed. Had the loan not been paid for, she would have been
defrauded, for she could not have foreclosed the property mortgaged.
That had not happened, however. While the accused used deceit in
the procurement of the loan, it is, however undeniable that they
effected full settlement thereof. The supposed aggrieved party has
not, therefore, been defrauded.
1060

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 315

Is there falsification of public document? The answer is obviously
affirmative. The deed of mortgage is a public document and, as
the
in
(the Court] stated, all material matters contained therein are false
for which one of the accused is responsible. In falsification of public
document, prejudice to a third party is not necessary. (People v. Cura,
et al., 55 O.G. 9242-9243)
The accused cannot be convicted of estafa with abuse of confidence
under an information alleging estafa by means of deceit

Under the definition of estafa (Art. 315, par. l[b]), it is an essential

element of the crime that the money or goods misappropriated or
converted by the accused to the prejudice of another was received by
him “in trust or on commission, or for administration, or under any
other obligation involving the duty to make delivery of, or to return
the same. No such allegation appears in the above information.
Consequently, [the Court] agree[s] with [the] appellant that he cannot
be convicted thereunder of the crime of estafa as defined by the article
mentioned above.” (Guzman v. Court of Appeals, 99 Phil. 708)
Complex crime of theft and estafa.

A, intending to redeem certain jewels, took the pawnshop tickets
from her wardrobe, but as she had to do something, she gave the
pawnshop tickets to B, her servant, so that the latter might take
care of them temporarily. A completely forgot about them. One week
later, B went out of the house and met C who got them and refused
to return them, alleging they were of no value, notwithstanding the
insistent demands made by B. Then C redeemed the jewels without
the knowledge and consent of A or B.
Held: C is guilty of the complex crime of theft and estafa, the
former a necessary means to commit the latter. C, with intent to
gain, took the pawnshop tickets without the consent of either A or
B. This is theft. By redeeming the jewels by means of the pawnshop
tickets, he committed estafa using a fictitious name. (People v. Yusay,

thereof. At the time he sold the land to C, A was no longer the
owner of the property.

2.

The accused, as president of the Federal Films, Inc., and
knowing that the corporation was a mere lessee of Cine
Palace in Cavite City, represented to the offended party, the
owner of Cine National in Manila, then being leased by the
corporation, that the corporation was the owner of the land and
building of Cine Palace to induce the offended party to accept
a mortgage of the real property as security for the payment of
the P3,000 monthly rent of Cine National. During the lease of
Cine Nacional, the corporation could not pay the monthly rent
of P3.000. Damage was caused to the offended party when he
could not realize any amount from the mortgage to satisfy the
unpaid rental. (Velasco v. Court of Appeals, 90 Phil. 688)

1063

Art. 316

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

There must be existing real property.
Where the accused sold non-existent land, he is guilty of estafa
by means of false pretenses under paragraph No. 2(a) of Article 315,
not of other form of swindling under paragraph No. 1 of Article 316.
(U.S. v. Cara, 41 Phil. 828)

Deceit consisting in false pretense as to ownership of the real
property must be employed by the offender.

A had been occupying certain lots of the Friar Lands belonging
to the Government. He executed a document which reads, as follows:
“Received from Mr. Alfonso x x x the sum of P700.00 for transferring
my rights of possession of the lots x x x.” A never pretended to be the
owner of the land in question. He sold not the land but only his right
of possession over it.
Held: For the commission of the crime of estafa penalized under
subsection 1 of Article 316, there is need of deceit employed by the
accused, consisting in false pretense with regard to his ownership of
the real property sold, conveyed or encumbered. (People v. Absalud,
CA.-G.R. No. 116979-R, February 21, 1955)
Article 316, No. 1 of the Revised Penal Code, penalizes only a
person who pretends to be the owner and not one who claims to be the
owner. Where the accused claims to be the owner of a parcel of land,
and especially where his ownership is evidenced by a Certificate of
Title, it cannot be said that he pretended to be the owner thereof, even
if his ownership is defective and he may be compelled to return the
property to the person found to be the owner of the property. (People
v. Adriatico, 15 CA. Rep. 1002)
Even if the deceit is practiced against the second purchaser and
the damage is incurred by the first purchaser, there is violation of
paragraph No. 1 of Article 316.

A sold a piece of land with pacto de retro to B. A failed to
repurchase the land and B became the owner thereof. While still
in possession and claiming to be still the owner of said property, A
sold it to C who bought it in ignorance of the fact that the property
had already been alienated. C registered the sale in his favor. B lost
the property because by not registering the sale in his favor, he was
divested of his title.
1064

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 316

When prosecuted for estafa, A argued that since the deceit was

practiced by him against C, the second purchaser, while the damage

fell on B, the first purchaser, he is not guilty of estafa.
Held: Such argument is not sustainable. Those acts constitute
the crime of estafa. (U.S. v. Drilon, 36 Phil. 834)
Is intent to cause damage sufficient?

Since the penalty of fine prescribed by Article 316 is based on
the “value of the damage caused,” mere intent to cause damage is
not sufficient. There must be actual damage caused by the act of the
offender.

Article 316, paragraph 1, and Article 315, paragraph 2(a),
compared.

The court a quo found the appellant guilty of estafa under
Article 316, paragraph 1, of the R.P.C., obviously on the opinion that
the threshing machine was a real property as contemplated in this
provision of the law.
The machinery remains classified as immovable while it stays
installed for the purpose of the industry or work. But once the
property is removed from its installation, as was to be expected in the
case at bar if the sale was to be made, it ceases to be a real property
but returns to its original classification as personal property. By this,
we do not mean, however, that Article 315, paragraph 2(a) covers
only cases where the property involved is personal property. Both
personal and real property may be the subject of the crime under
the law. But although Article 316, paragraph 1 refers only to real
property, its violation is confined to certain instances not common
with those of Article 315, paragraph 2(a). As [the[ [Court] see[s] it,
Article 316, paragraph 1 covers a specific situation where the offender
exercises or executes, as part of the false representation, some act of
dominion or ownership over the property to the damage and prejudice
of the real owner of the thing. On the other hand, this circumstance
need not be present for a crime to be committed under Article 315,
paragraph 2(a). In the case at bar, the evidence does not disclose that
the appellant had exercised certain acts of ownership or dominion
beyond his mere pointing of the property to the offended party and

That the offender knew that the real property was encumbered,

That there must be express representation by the offender that

Example:

A mortgaged his property to B. Later, A, misrepresenting that
said property is free from encumbrance, mortgaged it again, this time
to C.
But if C knew that the property had already been mortgaged to
B, C cannot complain, as there is neither deceit nor fraud.

executed in his favor a deed of chattel mortgage on a two-stor[e]y
house expressly warranting therein that the same was free from any
lien or encumbrance. It developed however that such warranty is not
true for it was later discovered that the same property had already
been previously mortgaged by appellant in favor of spouses Alejandro
Anatolio and Juliana de la Torres which mortgage was still subsisting.
It is evident that the appellant obtained the loan from complainant
through false representation or deceit which is one of the elements
constituting the crime of estafa. It is apparent that the complainant
granted the loan to appellant in the belief that the security offered
was good and sufficient to guarantee his investment because it was
free from any lien or encumbrance. Had he known that it was already
encumbered, the likelihood was that he would not have granted the
loan, which proves the fraud of which he was a victim. (People v.
Galsim, G.R. No. L-14577, February 29, 1960)
When the loan had already been granted when defendant offered
the property as security for the payment of the loan, Article 316,
paragraph 2, is not applicable.

Exhibit A,"Kasulatan ng Garantiya,” executed by the defendant,
reads as follows:

The term “encumbrance” includes every right or interest in the
land which exists in favor of third persons.
An outstanding mortgage, an ordinary lease, an attachment, the
lien of a judgment, and an execution sale subject to redemption are
encumbrances on the land.

It will be noted that the defendant had already been granted
loan of P6.000 by the complainant Lolita L. Luna, when said
defendant offered the properties to guarantee the payment of
said loan. Defendant did not, therefore, sell or dispose of the said
properties to the complainant, knowing the same to be already
encumbered, so as to make her liable under Article 316, paragraph
2, of the R.P.C. (Dissenting People v. Rubia Vda. de Torres, CA.,
62 O.G. 9270)

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

“Although such encumbrance be not recorded.”
Notwithstanding this phrase in paragraph No. 2 of Article 316,
in certain cases, it was held that the encumbrance must be legally
constituted.
An enforceable verbal agreement, previously made, to mortgage
the real property as a security for a loan is not an encumbrance on
the property, because a promise to mortgage is not an encumbrance.
(U.S. v. Mendezona, 1 Phil. 696; People v. Vda. deAgoncillo, CA., 50
O.G. 4884; People v. Bacolod, 64 Phil. 1056)
The attachment does not constitute an encumbrance until it is
registered. (U.S. v. Regalado y Sta. Ana, 1 Phil. 125)

The mortgage of a parcel of registered land which is not
registered, is void. (People v. De la Cruz, CA., 52 O.G. 4725)

In all these cases, the accused, who were charged with other
forms of swindling under paragraph No. 2 of Article 316, were
acquitted.
However, in one case, the Court of Appeals held that for
purposes of violation of Article 316, paragraph 2 of the R.P.C., it is
immaterial whether the encumbrance be considered as a deed of sale
with right of repurchase or as an equitable mortgage and whether
said encumbrance is registered and annotated in the certificate of
title, for under Article 316, it is not necessary that encumbrance be
registered. (People v. Gurango, et al., 15 CA. Rep. 271)

In Antazo v. People, 138 SCRA 284, the Supreme Court held
that a person who executes a Deed of Sale over a parcel of land “free
from all liens and encumbrances" after full payment of the purchase
price when in fact the land has been mortgaged and is the subject of a
levy on execution, commits estafa. The fact that encumbrance on land
sold “free from all liens and encumbrances” was registered with the
Register of Deeds does not change the character of the act as estafa.
Usurious loan with equitable mortgage Is not an encumbrance on
the property.

Where the unregistered deed of conveyance previously executed
by the accused, be it a pacto de retro or absolute sale is in reality a
mere usurious contract of loan with equitable mortgage, the execution
1068

TITLE TEN

Art. 316

by the said accused of a subsequent deed of absolute sale of the same
property in favor of another with a warranty therein that the property
sold is free from liens and encumbrances, does not constitute the crime

of estafa under Article 316, paragraph 2, of the R.P.C. The usurious
loan contract, including its accessory obligation of equitable mortgage,
being null and void (Arts. 1352, 1409, 2052, and 2086, Civil Code), no
legal encumbrance on the property was created thereby.
Since at the time appellant executed the second deed of sale
on May 24, 1957, he had actually returned more than the capital
received by him, and since under the Usury Law he was not liable
for the interest and in fact could recover whatever sum he might
have delivered on that account, the loan had been extinguished by
payment and the equitable mortgage to guarantee the said loan,
discharged as a consequence. In other words, when appellant sold the
house to Renato R. Vera, there was in legal contemplation no more
lien or encumbrance thereon, and hence his statement to that effect
did not constitute a misrepresentation within the meaning of Article
316, paragraph 2, of the R.P.C. under which he was prosecuted and
convicted by the trial court. (People v. Masangkay, CA., 58 O.G. 3565)
The thing disposed of must be real property.

If the thing encumbered is personal property, Article 319 applies,
because Article 319 punishes him who sells or pledges personal
property which is already subject to an encumbrance.
The offender must know that the real property is encumbered.

Thus, if the accused did not know that the property he acquired
had been mortgaged and sold the same as free from encumbrance,
the accused is not criminally liable.

Real property may be registered under any system of registration.

This paragraph applies whether the property is registered under
the Spanish system of transfer of property or it is registered under
the Land Registration Act.
The Land Registration Act might make it more difficult to

consummate the crime, but it does not change the nature of the act.

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The third element requires misrepresentation, fraud, or deceit

The motion of misrepresentation, fraud, or deceit involves acts or
spoken or written words by a party to mislead another into believing
something to be true when it is not in fact. The element of fraud in
the crime of estafa under Article 316, paragraph 2, cannot be implied.
(People v. Mariano, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 4, 91)
The mere fact that the encumbered real property is disposed of
again by the owner does not in itself constitute swindling or a violation
of Article 316 of the R.P.C. It is necessary to prove that there was
fraud or deceit in the second disposition. The vendor must have made
express representations to the second buyer that the property was
free from encumbrance. Fraud cannot be presumed from the mere
fact that there was a second sale. The law does not prohibit the sale
of encumbered real property. What is penalized is the fraud or deceit
committed by the vendor in representing that the property is not

in the disposition of immovable property as unencumbered, knowing it
to be encumbered, could never be committed if the first disposition was
registered in the office of the Register of Deeds. This is not justified
by the wordings in paragraph 2, Article 316 of the R.P.C., to wit: “Any
person who, knowing that real property is encumbered shall dispose
of the same, although such encumbrance be not recorded.” The words
“although such encumbrance be not recorded x x x” obviously implies
that the crime is committed whether the first disposition is recorded
or not. For the purpose of the commission of the offense, it is the false
pretenses or representations of the owner that constitute deceit. It
is his disposition of the property knowing it to be encumbered that
constitutes fraud. For that purpose, the criminal law does not require
that the victim should make an inquiry or investigation in the office
of the Register of Deeds to find out the actual status or condition of
the property. (People v. Mirasol, 18 CA. Rep. 654)

encumbered. (People v. Gurango, et al., CA., 67 O.G. 2930)

There must be damage caused.

When the third element is not established, there is no crime.

If no damage should result from the sale, no crime of estafa
would be committed by the vendor, as the element of damage would
then be lacking. (People v. Mariano, CA., supra)

In the deed of sale executed by the accused, no express mention
of the existence of the encumbrance in question was made. It merely
recites that the vendor is “the legal and absolute owner of the house,”
which is true; and that she bound herself “to defend the vendee from
any and all claims which may arise as a result of this conveyance.”
What really took place was that it did not occur to the parties to discuss
whether there were any encumbrances on said property.
Held: Under the facts, therefore, it cannot be held that the
accused was guilty of misrepresentation and fraud. Her passive
attitude is insufficient to constitute fraud within the meaning of the
law. The fraud contemplated in the law must be the result of some
overt acts. There must be express representation that the real property
is free from encumbrance. It cannot be deemed implied. Silence as to
such encumbrance does not involve a crime. (People v. Buencamino,
CA., 51 O.G. 6341)
Appellant argues the registration of the deed of sale with right of
repurchase, Exh. B, in favor of Regelio Cariaga was sufficient notice
to Diosdado Cruz, as registration is constructive notice to the whole
world. Under appellant’s contention, the crime of estafa which consists
1070

Is the intention to cause damage sufficient? The basis of fine,
in addition to imprisonment, is the “value of the damage caused.”
But it is not necessary that the act be made to the prejudice of
the owner of the land. (People v. Luzentales, CA., 55 O.G. 48)
“Shall dispose of the same as free from encumbrance.”

The phrase “as free from encumbrance” is omitted in paragraph 2
of Article 316. The Spanish text says“El que dispusiere de un inmueble
como libre, sabiendo que estaba gravado, etc.”

The omitted phrase “as free from encumbrance” is the basis
of the ruling that silence as to such encumbrance does not involve

a crime.

That the offender is the owner of personal property.
That said personal property is in the lawful possession of

another.
3.

That the offender wrongfully takes it from its lawful possessor.

4.

That prejudice is thereby caused to the possessor or third
person.

Art. 316

The personal property must be in the lawful possession of another.
A knew that B had found a ring belonging to C. A, without the
knowledge and consent of B, took it from the latter’s chest and gave
it to C, its owner.

Is A liable under the third paragraph of Article 316?

No. B was not the lawful possessor of the ring. The finder of lost

property has no right to possess the same, it being his obligation to
give it to its owner or to the authorities.

Example:

The offender must wrongfully take the personal property from its

The accused pawned his watch to the complainant. Later,
pretending to have the money for redeeming the watch, the accused
asked the offended party to give him the watch. Once in possession of
it, he carried it away without paying the loan for which it was given
to the offended party as security. (People v. Fajardo, 49 Phil. 206)

lawful possessor.
The taking is wrongful when it is without the consent of the
possessor, or when deceit is employed by the owner of the personal
property in inducing the possessor to give it to him.

Note that the offender must be the owner of the personal property.
If he is a third person and his purpose in taking it is to return it to
the owner, it is theft, since the abstraction was made with the intent
that another might profit thereby. (Albert)

Thus, where the accused, who had delivered his ring to the
offended party as collateral to a loan, falsely manifested and
fraudulently represented to the latter that he had a buyer of the
ring, promising to return it, if not sold, or to pay the loan out of the
proceeds of the sale, and once in possession thereof never fulfilled
his promise, he is liable under Article 316, paragraph 3. (People v.
Villacorta, 2 CA. Rep. 425)

If the owner took the personal property from its lawful possessor
without the latter’s knowledge and later charged him with the value
of the property, is it theft or estafa?

Does the phrase “shall wrongfully take it” Include taking by
violence?

The offender must be the owner of personal property.

In no case may the owner be held guilty of theft of his own
property, because one of the elements of theft is that the property
belongs to another. But if the owner, after taking it without the consent
of the possessor, charged the possessor with the value of said property,
the crime committed is theft. (U.S. v. Albao, 29 Phil. 86)
Note: Although the property belongs to the offender, yet by
charging the former possessor with its value, the offender intends to
take another’s money and at the same time exhibits an intent to gain.
This is the reason for the ruling in the case of U.S. v. Albao, supra.

If the owner takes the thing from the bailee by means of violence
or intimidation, with intent to charge the bailee with its value, the
crime is robbery. (U.S. v. Albao, 29 Phil. 86)
In view of that ruling, it would seem that if the thing is taken
by means of violence, without intent to gain, it would not be estafa,
but grave coercion. (Art. 286)

“To the prejudice of the latter or any third person.”

But in charging the lawful possessor with its value, will not the
owner make a false pretense, which is a form of deceit, and, therefore,
makes the crime estafa?

A pledged his watch to B, his roommate in a dormitory, to secure
a loan of P30.00. One evening, A took the watch from the drawer of B’s
table, without the latter’s knowledge and consent and used it when A
went to a dance party. Later, when A returned and was about to put
back the watch in the drawer of B’s table, the latter surprised him.

not simulated, to prejudice a creditor.

But in a case, the Supreme Court held that it was a violation of
Article 314, R.P.C., even if the consideration was fictitious.
Tan Diong was a merchant in good standing in the municipality
of Kinoguitan, Misamis Oriental. Pastora Padla was his wife and
Eustaquio Baranda was the husband of the latter’s niece. Prior to
June, 1931, Tan Diong had become indebted to various merchants
of Cebu, and a judgment against him had been rendered in favor of
Lim Tian Ting & Co. for more than P5.000. Upon this judgment, an
execution had been issued, but it realized only the sum of P198.23
from certain personal property levied upon in Tan DiOng’s store.
Tan Diong and his wife had previously owned various parcels of real
property in the municipality but investigation showed that prior to
the events mentioned they had transferred all to their co-defendant
Eustaquio Baranda.

The evidence amply shows that these conveyances were made
for the purpose of putting the property beyond the reach of Tan
DiOng’s creditors, and that the consideration mentioned in the deeds
of conveyance from Tan Diong and wife to Baranda was fictitious.
(People v. Tan Diong, et al., 59 Phil. 538)
Note: The accused were prosecuted for, and accused Tan Diong
was convicted of, the crime defined and penalized under Article 523
of the old Penal Code, (now Art. 314, R.P.C.)
1074

By accepting any compensation for services not
or for labor not performed.

The crime in this paragraph consists in accepting any

compensation given the accused who did not render the service or

perform the labor for which payment was made.
But this kind of estafa requires fraud as an important element.
If there is no fraud, it becomes payment not owing, known as solutio
indebiti under the Civil Code, with civil obligation to return the
wrong payment.

The above illustration would be a case of fraudulent insolvency
(Art. 314), if the conveyance is real and made for a consideration, and

Art. 316

It would seem that what constitutes estafa under this paragraph
is the malicious failure to return the compensation wrongfully

received.
If the money in payment of a debt was delivered to a wrong
person, Article 316, paragraph 5, is not applicable, in case the person
who received it later refused or failed to return it to the owner of the

money, Article 315, subdivision 1(b), is applicable.

There must be damage caused under Article 316.
A executed a bond in the sum of Pl,000 as one of the sureties for
the administrator appointed by the court in the intestate proceedings
of a deceased person. In order to qualify as such surety, A exhibited
his Transfer Certificate of Title No. 9683, covering a parcel of land.
Before the cancellation of said bond and without judicial authority,
A sold the land. There was no express finding in the judgment that
the sale made by A resulted in any actual damage to the estate of

the deceased.
Held: The penalty prescribed in Article 316 is arresto mayor
in its minimum and medium periods and a fine of not less than the
value of the damage caused and not more than three times such value.
Such fine is not merely an alternative penalty. It seems clear that
Article 316 contemplates the existence of damage as an element of the
offense. The damage should not be merely potential or speculative. The
cases of U.S. v. Goyenechea, 8 Phil. 117, and U.S. v. Malong, 36 Phil.

because the property involved in those cases belonged to the offended

states that it also applies to other “corporations/associations operating

these category as it “operated on funds solicited from the general

of minor-league schemers who operate in the countryside. To allow
these crimes to go unabated could spell disaster for people from
the lower income bracket, the primary target of swindlers. (People

Art. 316

Syndicated Estafa committed through a Ponzi scheme.

A Ponzi scheme is a type of investment fraud that involves
the payment of purported returns to existing investors from funds
contributed by new investors. Its organizers often solicit new
investors by promising to invest funds in opportunities claimed to
generate high returns with little or no risk. In many Ponzi schemes,
the perpetrators focus on attracting new money to make promised
payments to earlier-stage investors to create the false appearance
that investors are profiting from a legitimate business. It is not an
investment strategy but a gullibility scheme, which works only as
long as there is an ever increasing number of new investors joining
the scheme. It is difficult to sustain the scheme over a long period of
time because the operator needs an ever larger pool of later investors
to continue paying the promised profits to early investors. The idea
behind this type of swindle is that the “con-man” collects his money
from his second or third round of investors and then absconds before
anyone else shows up to collect. Necessarily, Ponzi schemes only last
weeks, or months at the most.

Art. 316

Other Cases of Syndicated Estafa:
(1) Panata Foundation of the Philippines, Inc. sent out
brochures soliciting deposits from the public, assuring would-be
depositors that their money would either be doubled after 21 days
or tripled after 30 days. Under its alleged investment program, a
depositor hands his investment to a clerk who, in turn would give it to
the teller. In exchange, the depositors would receive filled-up printed
forms called “slots,” which bear resemblance to bank checks and were
already signed beforehand by the president of the foundation. The
amounts received by the foundation were deposited in various banks
under the names of its president and/or secretary. The foundation
started with a few depositors, most of whom only invested small
amounts to see whether the foundation would make good on its
promise. As word got around that the foundation was able to fulfill its
obligations, more depositors were attracted by the promised returns.
Blinded by the prospect of gaining substantial profits for nothing more
than a minuscule investment, these investors were lured to reinvest
their earnings, if not to invest more. The operations initially proceeded
smoothly. However, on November 29, 1989, the foundation closed
down. Depositors then began to demand for the reimbursement of
their deposits, but the foundation was unable to deliver. Consequently,
64 informations, all charging the offense of Syndicated Estafa were
filed against the incorporators and employees of the foundation.

Held-. It is indisputable that the foundation failed to return the
investments of the complainants. Hence, it is undeniable that the
complainants suffered damage in the amount of their unrecouped

It is clear that all the elements of Syndicated Estafa, committed
through a Ponzi scheme, are present in this case, considering that:
(a) the incorporators/directors of TGICI comprising more than five
people, including herein accused-appellants, made false pretenses
and representations to the investing public
in this case, the
private complainants
regarding a supposed lucrative investment
opportunity with TGICI in order to solicit money from them;
(b) the said false pretenses and representations were made prior to or
simultaneous with the commission of fraud; (c) relying on the same,
private complainants invested their hard earned money into TGICI;

enterprise shall be a certain sum, but he actually knows that there
will be none, or that they will be substantially less than he represents,
the statement constitutes actionable fraud where the hearer believes
him and relies on the statement to his injury (37 Am. Jur. Fraud and
Deceits § 130). That there was no profit forthcoming can be clearly
deduced from the fact that the foundation was not engaged nor
authorized to engage in any lucrative business to finance its operation.

than five counselors employed deceit and falsely pretended to have
the authority to solicit investments from the general public when,
in truth, they did not have such authority. The deception continued
when Baladja/s counselors actively solicited investments from the
public, promising very high interest returns starting at 5% per month.
Convinced of Baladjay’s and her counselors’ promise of lucrative
income, the private complainants were then enticed to invest in
Multitel. However, unknown to them, the promised high-yielding
venture was unsustainable, as Multitel was not really engaged in
any legitimate business. Eventually, Baladjay and her cohorts ran
away with the private complainants’ money causing them damage
and prejudice.

Held.-. All the elements of Syndicated Estafa are present,
considering that: (a) more than five persons are involved in Multitel’s
grand fraudulent scheme, including Baladjay and her co-accused
who employed deceit, false pretenses and representations to the
private complainants regarding a supposed lucrative investment
opportunity with Multitel in order to solicit money from them;
(b) the said false pretenses and representations were made prior
to or simultaneous with the commission of fraud; (c) relying on
the false promises and misrepresentations thus employed, private
complainants invested their hard-earned money in Multitel; and
(d) Baladjay and her co-accused defrauded the private complainants,
obviously to the latter’s prejudice. (People v. Baladjay, G.R. No.

Large Scale Swindling (2nd Paragraph of Sec. 1, P.D. No. 1689).

Facts: The spouses Menil were the proprietors of a business
operating under the name ABM Appliance and Upholstery. Through
ushers and sales executives, they began soliciting investments
from the general public in Surigao City and its neighboring towns,
assuring would-be investors that their money would be multiplied

tenfold after 15 calendar days. The spouses Menil issued “coupons”

as proofs of investment. As the initial amounts involved were small,
the spouses Menil were able to pay the returns on the investments
as they fell due. However, the amounts invested and the number of

depositors gradually increased until it reached a point wherein the
daily investments amounting to millions of pesos were pouring in
and payments of the returns were delayed. On September 19, 1989,
the spouses stopped releasing payments altogether, prompting the
investors to charge them with large-scale swindling.
Held: There was no showing that a syndicate perpetrated
the Ponzi scheme. While the prosecution proved that a non-stock
corporation with 11 incorporators was involved in the illegal
scheme, there was no showing that these incorporators collaborated,
confederated, and mutually helped one another in directing the
corporation’s activities. In fact, the evidence for the prosecution shows
that it was only accused-appellant and his wife who had knowledge of
and who perpetrated the illegal scheme. As such, the trial court was
correct in convicting accused-appellant under the second paragraph
of Section 1 of P.D. No. 1689 which states that “If the offenders are
not members of a syndicate, they shall nevertheless be held liable for
the acts prohibited by the law but they shall be penalized by reclusion
temporal to reclusion perpetua if the amount of the fraud is more than
one hundred thousand pesos,” considering that the amount swindled
by accused-appellant totals P45,494,936. (People v. Menil, G.R. Nos.

3.

That the consideration is (1) some loan of money, (2) credit, or
(3) other personal property.

Other deceits are:

4.

That the transaction is to the detriment of such minor.

1.

By defrauding or damaging another by any other deceit not
mentioned in the preceding articles.

2.

By interpreting dreams, by making forecasts, by telling fortunes,
or by taking advantage of the credulity of the public in any
other similar manner, for profit or gain.

Example:

The act of causing a minor to sign a receipt for P480.00 when
as a matter of fact the minor received P400.00 only, coupled with
the circumstance that the minor was a fugitive from the house of
his parents and was very badly in need of money was sufficient to
constitute estafa under this article. (Guevara)

Note: Actual proof of deceit or misrepresentation is not essential,
as it is sufficient that the offender takes advantage of the inexperience
or emotions of the minor.
Real property not Included.

Element No. 3 specifies loan of money, credit or other personal
property as a consideration. Real property is not included because
it cannot be made to disappear, since a minor cannot convey real
property without judicial authority. (Albert)

What is the age of the minor?
When the Code is silent as to the age of the minor as the offended
party or victim of the offense, it is understood that he must be under
18 years as the age of majority is 18 years old.

Scope of this article.

Article 318 of the Revised Penal Code is broad in application. It
is intended as a catch-all provision to cover all other kinds of deceit
not falling under Articles 315, 316, and 317 of the R.P.C.

All the elements of Article 318 of the R.P.C. are present in this
case. Petitioner, in soliciting private complainant’s money, falsely
represented that it would be invested in Philam Life and that its
proceeds would be used to pay for private complainant’s insurance
premiums. This false representation is what induced private
complainant to part with her funds and disregard the payment of
her insurance premiums. Since petitioner deviated from what was
originally agreed upon by placing the investment in another company,
private complainant’s insurance policies lapsed.

Although petitioner was charged of estafa by means of deceit
under Article 315(2)(a) of the R.P.C., she may be convicted of other
deceits under Article 318 of the R.P.C. As a rule, an accused can only
be convicted of the crime with which he or she is charged. This rule
proceeds from the Constitutional guarantee that an accused shall
always be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against
him or her. An exception to this is the rule on variance under Rule
120, Section 4 of the Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure. In the
present case, the crime of other deceits under Article 318 of the R.P.C.
1083

Art. 318

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

is necessarily included in the crime of estafa by means of deceit under
Article 315(2)(a) of the R.P.C. Therefore, petitioner may be convicted
of other deceits under Article 318 of the R.P.C. ( Osorio v. People, G.R.
No. 207711, July 2, 2018)
A railroad conductor, who collected Pl.22 from a passenger and
issued a ticket for a shorter journey for which the proper charge was
P0.18 and pocketed the difference, is guilty of estafa under Article
318. (U.S. v. Reyes, 1 Phil. 249)

If the tenant, who sold the landlord’s share in the harvest and
failed to deliver the proceeds of the sale to the landlord, is not liable
for estafa under Article 315, he may be held liable under the first
paragraph of Article 318. (People v. Carulasdulasan, 95 Phil. 8)
Estafa by hiring and using public vehicle without money to pay
the fare.

Where the accused hired and used a vehicle and then failed to
pay the fare, because he had no money, he was guilty of estafa under
Article 534, No. 1 of the old Penal Code, as amended by Act No. 3244,
in connection with Articles 535, No. 1, and 536 of said Code. (People
v. Santiago, 55 Phil. 266; People v. Sunga, 54 Phil. 210; People v.
Espino, 47 Phil. 977)
The deceits in this article include false pretenses and fraudulent
acts.

To give genuine copper cents the appearance of silver pesetas by
whitening them with quicksilver for the purpose of defrauding third
persons by deceiving them as to the real value of the coins, constitutes
estafa under this article and not that of counterfeiting money. (U.S.
v. Basco, 6 Phil. 110)
Note: This is by fraudulent act.
A person who presents himself to another to serve as domestic
helper and obtains money in advance and later, on some pretext,
leaves the service is guilty of estafa under this article. (People v.
Panlileo, G.R. No. 35536, April 8, 1932)

Note: This is by false pretenses.

Application of Article 318.
Guinhawa u. People

(G.R. No. 16822, August 25, 2005)

Facts: Jaime Guinhawa was engaged in the business of selling brand
vehicles and employed Gil Azotea as his sales manager. On March
motor
new
17, 1995, Guinhawa purchased from Union Motors Corporation (UMC) a
brand new Mitsubishi L-300 Versa Van. Guinhawa’s driver drove the van
from Manila to Naga City but suffered a heart attack while driving, which
resulted in the van going out of control and being ditched in a canal. The
van was damaged, and the left front tire had to be replaced. The van was
repaired and later offered for sale in Guinhawa’s showroom.
Sometime in October 1995, the spouses Silo wanted to buy a brand new
van and visited Guinhawa’s office, where Azotea showed the L-300 Versa Van
which was on display. The couple inspected its interior portion and found it
beautiful. They no longer inspected the under chassis since they presumed
that the vehicle was brand new. Unaware that the van had been damaged
and repaired, the couple decided to purchase the van. Shortly thereafter,
a representative of the couple complained to Guinhawa about squeaking
sounds coming from underneath the van, to which Guinhawa replied that
those were mere factory defects. As the defects persisted, the spouses Silo
requested that Guinhawa change the van with two Charade-Daihatsu vehicles
within a week or two. Guinhawa initially agreed to the couple’s proposal, but
later changed his mind and told them that he had to sell the van first. The
spouses then brought the vehicle to an auto clinic for examination and the
mechanic discovered that it was the left front stabilizer that was producing
the annoying sound, and that it had been repaired.

Mrs. Silo filed a complaint for the rescission of the sale and the refund
of their money before the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). During
the confrontation between her and Guinhawa, she learned that Guinhawa
had bought the van from UMC before it was sold to them, and after it was
damaged. Mrs. Silo then filed a criminal complaint against Guinhawa for
violation of Article 318, paragraph 1, of the R.P.C.
Held: The false or fraudulent representation by a seller that what he
offers for sale is brand new (when, in fact, it is not) is one of those deceitful

acts envisaged in paragraph 1, Article 318 of the R.P.C.

Guinhawa and Azotea knew that the van had figured in an accident,
was damaged and had to be repaired. Nevertheless, the van was placed in the
showroom, thus making it appear to the public that it was a brand new unit.

Guinhawa was mandated to reveal the foregoing facts to Mrs. Silo. However,
Guinhawa and Azotea even obdurately declared when they testified in the
1085

Art. 318

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

court a quo that the vehicle did not figure in an accident, nor had it been
repaired; they maintained that the van was brand new, knowing that the
private complainant was going to use it for her garment business. Thus, the
private complainant bought the van, believing it was brand new.
Guinhawa is not relieved of his criminal liability for deceitful
concealment of material facts, even if the private complainant made a visual
inspection of the van’s interior and exterior before she agreed to buy it and
failed to inspect its under chassis. Case law has it that where the vendee
made only a partial investigation and relies, in part, upon the representation
of the vendee, and is deceived by such representation to his injury, he may
maintain an action for such deceit. (Burnett v. Boyer, 285 S.W. 670; Madton
v. Norton, 238 N.W. 686J The seller cannot be heard to say that the vendee
should not have relied upon the fraudulent concealment; that negligence, on
the part of the vendee, should not be a defense in order to prevent the vendor
from unjustifiably escaping with the fruits of the fraud.

Chapter Seven

CHATTEL MORTGAGE
Art. 319. Removal, sale or pledge of mortgaged property.
The penalty of arresto mayor* or a fine amounting to twice
the value of the property shall be imposed upon:

—

1. Any person who shall knowingly remove any
personal property mortgaged under the Chattel Mortgage
Law to any province or city other than the one in which it
was located at the time of the execution of the mortgage,

without the written consent of the mortgagee or his executors,
administrators, or assigns.
2. Any mortgagor who shall sell or pledge personal
property already pledged, or any part thereof, under the
terms of the Chattel Mortgage Law, without the consent of
the mortgagee written on the back of the mortgage and noted
on the record thereof in the office of the register of deeds of
the province where such property is located.

Object of Article 319.

The object of the penal provisions of the Chattel Mortgage Law,
from which Article 319 of the R.P.C. was taken, is to give the necessary
sanction to the provision of the statute in the interest of the public at
large, so that in all cases wherein loans are made and secured under

the terms of the statute, the mortgage debtors may be deterred from
the violation of its provisions and the mortgage creditors may be
protected against loss or inconvenience resulting from the wrongful
removal or sale of the mortgaged property. (U.S. v. Kilayko, 32 Phil.

619)

Art. 319

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Purpose of paragraph No. 1 of Article 319.
One of the purposes of Article 319, paragraph No. 1, is the
protection of the mortgagee who should be able to have a ready access
to, and easy reach of, the property subject of the mortgage. (People v.
Mata, CA., 58 O.G. 6287)

Acts punishable under Article 319:
1. Knowingly removing any personal property mortgaged under
the Chattel Mortgage Law to any province or city other than
the one in which it was located at the time of execution of the
mortgage, without the written consent of the mortgagee or his
executors, administrators or assigns.

2.

Selling or pledging personal property already pledged, or any
part thereof, under the terms of the Chattel Mortgage Law,
without the consent of the mortgagee written on the back of
the mortgage and noted on the record thereof in the office of
the register of deeds of the province where such property is
located.

The chattel mortgage must be valid and subsisting.

It is essential that there be a valid and subsisting chattel
mortgage. If the chattel mortgage does not contain an affidavit of
good faith and is not registered, it is void and cannot be the basis of a
criminal prosecution under Article 319. (People v. Vda. de Agoncillo,
CA., 50 O.G. 4884)
Elements of knowingly removing mortgaged personal property:

a.

That personal property is mortgaged under the Chattel
Mortgage Law.

b.
c.

That the offender knows that such property is so mortgaged.
That he removes such mortgaged personal property to any
province or city other than the one in which it was located at
the time of the execution of the mortgage.
That the removal is permanent.
That there is no written consent of the mortgagee or his
executors, administrators or assigns to such removal.

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 319

Liability of person other than the mortgagor.

Is the third person who removed the property to another province,
knowing it to have been mortgaged under the Chattel Mortgage Law,
liable under this article? Yes. The offender is any person who shall
knowingly remove the mortgaged personal property to another
province or city without the written consent of the mortgagee, etc.
if the chattel mortgage is not registered, there is no violation of

Article 319.
Appellant’s contention is that having filed a collection suit
based on the promissory note before the Manila Municipal Court,
P.E. Domingo & Co., Inc. is considered to have abandoned the chattel
mortgage as basis for relief, whether civil or criminal; or, in the event
that such is not the case, the chattel mortgage should be considered
merely as a pledge before its registration on Januaiy 2, 1952, so that
there could be no violation thereof pursuant to Article 319, paragraph
1, of the R.P.C.
Held: Where the crime or offense not only disturbs the public
order but also injures the property rights of an individual, the right to
file the complaint is personal to the latter. Hence, in the case at bar,
it having abandoned a foreclosure suit against defendant-appellant,
P.E. Domingo & Co., Inc. was without legitimate basis to proceed
against him in a criminal case based on the same cause of action.

As regards the second point of defense, although it may be true
that registration was not a necessary requisite to the validity of a
chattel mortgage under the old law (Act No. 1508), nevertheless, the
same has been deemed amended by the provision of Article 2140 of
the New Civil Code, which took effect on August 30, 1950, and which
now makes it indispensable that the document be registered. This
amendment definitely favors the appellant; as such it must retroact
to cover an act committed before the amendment. Thus, even in
the supposition that appellant has committed a violation of Article
319, paragraph 1, of the R.P.C., with the old Chattel Mortgage Law
as basis, such violation was no longer a crime at the time of his
prosecution on June 27, 1952, due to the advent of the New Civil Code;
and this must be so far under the laws already in force at the time of
the initiation of the criminal action, the document which became the
basis of prosecution was only a mere pledge, not a chattel mortgage.

Art. 319

The evidence shows that appellant and his family transferred
their residence to Allen, Samar, long before December, 1951. Their
bringing the piano with them was a step taken towards giving more
protection to the safety and security of their property including the
piano, not only for their own benefit but also for that of the mortgagee
P.E. Domingo & Co.

It would be absurd to suppose that in transferring their residence
to Allen, Samar, the appellant and his family should leave behind a
valuable property, such as a piano, in the care of just anybody. [The]
[Court] believe[s] that this could not have been the intent of the
legislature in enacting the law. In this respect, [the Court] considers]
the transfer of the piano to Allen, Samar, as without any felonious
intent to prejudice or cause damage upon the mortgagee. The transfer
was warranted by the family’s bona fide intention to change residence.
(People v. Mata, CA., 58 O.G. 6287)
Example of violation of paragraph No. 1 of Article 319.

The accused mortgaged his piano then in Manila to the offended
party to secure the payment of his debt to the latter in the amount
of P350.00. Thereafter, the accused took the piano to Kalibo, Capiz,
without the offended party knowing the removal of the piano. (U.S.
v. Rimon, 23 Phil. 13)
The removal of the mortgaged personal property must be coupled
with intent to defraud.

Thus, when the cabs of the Globe Taxi, Inc., mortgaged under the
Chattel Mortgage Law, were removed after notifying the mortgagee
from Manila, where they were at the time the loan was negotiated, to
Quezon City, because the fire department had ordered the closing of
its gas station in Manila, there was no violation of Article 319, since
the removal was justified and there was no fraud in the transfer of
the location of the garage. (People v. Torres, CA., 51 O.G. 6280)
Filing a civil action for collection, not for foreclosure of chattel
mortgage, relieves the accused of criminal responsibility.

If the mortgagee elected to file a suit for collection, not
foreclosure, thereby abandoning the mortgage as basis for relief, the

of paragraph No. 1 of Article 319. (People v. Mata, C.A., 58 O.G.

Elements of selling or pledging personal property already pledged:
a. That personal property is already pledged under the terms
of the Chattel Mortgage Law.
b. That the offender, who is the mortgagor of such property, sells
or pledges the same or any part thereof.
c.

That there is no consent of the mortgagee written on the back
of the mortgage and noted on the record thereof in the office
of the register of deeds.

House may be subject of chattel mortgage by agreement of the
parties.

Although a house is generally considered an immovable property
and should, therefore, ordinarily be the subject of a real estate
mortgage, this will not preclude prosecution of the appellants under
Article 319, paragraph 2, for as can be seen from Exhibit B itself,
the appellants and Verdon undoubtedly agreed to make the house
in question the subject of the chattel mortgage Exhibit B. (Paras, 2
Civil Code, 1963 Ed., p. 9; Evangelista v. Abad, 36 O.G. 2913; Tomines
v. San Juan, 45 O.G. 2935) And Exhibit B having been made and
registered under the terms of the Chattel Mortgage Law, subsequent
sale or pledge of the property covered by Exhibit B, without the
consent of the first mortgagee written on the back of the mortgage and
noted on the record, constitutes violation of Article 319, paragraph
2. (People v. Daproza, et al., CA., 62 O.G. 5961-5964)

Second chattel mortgage is included.

Under Article 319 of the Code, which penalizes the mortgagor
who sells or pledges a mortgaged property without the consent of the
mortgagee, within the terms of the Chattel Mortgage Law, a second
mortgage is, aside from sale or pledge, contemplated by the law, for
the Spanish text uses the word“hipoteca.” (People v.Vda.de Agoncillo,
CA.-G.R. No. 9113 R, April 8, 1954)

(58 O.G. 7213)
Facts: The appellant obtained a loan from one Mauro Magno in the
amount of P2,500.00 payable within a period of five years, and to secure its
payment, the former executed in favor of the latter a deed of chattel mortgage
assigning and conveying by way of first mortgage a two-storey house located
in the City of Manila.

property mortgaged be sold as free, even though the vendor may have
obtained the consent of the mortgagee in writing.
Selling or pledging of personal property already pledged or
mortgaged is committed by the mere failure to obtain the consent
of the mortgagee in writing, even if the offender should inform the
purchaser that the thing sold is mortgaged. (People v. Alvarez, 45
Phil. 472)

The purpose of the law in Article 319 is to protect the mortgagee;
in Article 316, the purpose is to protect the purchaser, whether the
first or the second.

It appeared that the house in question had already been previously
mortgaged by its owner to a certain De la Torre. As a result, the deed of
mortgage executed by the accused in favor of Magno was refused registration
by the register of deeds. Magno demanded the return of his money from the
accused but the latter failed to do so.
Held: It is evident that the appellant obtained the loan from complainant
through false representation or deceit which is one of the elements constituting
the crime of estafa. The complainant had granted the loan to appellant in
the belief that the security offered was good and sufficient to guarantee his
investment because it was free from any lien or encumbrance. Had he known
that it was already encumbered, the likelihood was that he would not have
granted the loan, which proves the fraud of which he was a victim.

Magno has been deprived of the use of his money because of such
fraud and he stands to lose it in view of his failure to obtain the registration
of the deed of mortgage. It must be noted that when complainant tried to
register the mortgage in the office of the register of deeds, the latter refused
registration for the apparent reason that the same could not be registered
as first encumbrance on the property. Under the circumstances, the damage
or injury that such failure of registration has caused the complainant is
apparent and constitutes one of the elements of estafa under the law. (U.S.

and other military, government or commercial establishments by any
person or group of persons. The classification of this type of crime is
known as Destructive Arson, which is punishable by reclusion perpetua
to death.
The reason for the law is self-evident: to effectively discourage
the commission of this dastardly crime, to prevent the
deter
and
destruction of properties and protect the lives of innocent people.
Exposure to a brewing conflagration leaves only destruction and
despair in its wake; hence, the State mandates greater retribution to
authors of this heinous crime. The exceptionally severe punishment
imposed for this crime takes into consideration the extreme danger
to human lives exposed by the malicious burning of these structures;
the danger to property resulting from the conflagration; the fact that
it is normally difficult to adopt precautions against its commission,
and the difficulty in pinpointing the perpetrators; and, the greater
impact on the social, economic, security and political fabric of the
nation. (People v. Soriano, G.R. No. 142565, July 29, 2003)

mills, plantations, railways, bus stations, airports, wharves and other

industrial establishments. (People v. Murcia, G.R. No. 182460, March

9, 2010, citing People v. Malingan, 503 SCRA 294)
The nature of Destructive Arson is distinguished from Simple
Arson by the degree of perversity or viciousness of the criminal
offender. The acts committed under Article 320 of the R.P.C.
constituting Destructive Arson are characterized as heinous crimes
“for being grievous, odious and hateful offenses and which, by reason
of their inherent or manifest wickedness, viciousness, atrocity and
perversity are repugnant and outrageous to the common standards
and norms of decency and morality in a just, civilized and ordered
society.” On the other hand, acts committed under P.D. No. 1613
constituting Simple Arson are crimes with a lesser degree of perversity
and viciousness that the law punishes with a lesser penalty. In other
words, Simple Arson contemplates crimes with less significant social,
economic, political and national security implications than Destructive
Arson. (People v. Soriano, G.R. No. 142565, July 29, 2003)

Penalty for destructive arson resulting in death.

If as a consequence of the commission of any of the acts penalized
under Article 320, death should result, the mandatory penalty of
death shall be imposed. (Art. 320, as amended by R.A. No. 7659)
However, pursuant to R.A. No. 9346 which prohibited the imposition
of the death penalty, the mandatory penalty of death for Destructive
Arson where death ensues is now downgraded to reclusion perpetua
with no eligibility for parole.

both public and private, hotels, buildings, edifices, trains, vessels,
aircraft, factories and other military, government or commercial

Arson, defined.

Arson is defined as the malicious destruction of property by fire.
Kinds of arson.

1.

Simple Arson (Sec. 1, P.D. No. 1613)

2.

Destructive Arson (Art. 320, as amended by R.A. No. 7659)

3.

Other cases of arson (Sec. 3, P.D. No. 1613)

Presidential Decree No. 1613 is the governing law for Simple Arson.

Presidential Decree No. 1613 which repealed Articles 321 to
326-B of the R.P.C. remains the governing law for Simple Arson.
This decree contemplates the malicious burning of public and private
structures, regardless of size, not included in Article 320, as amended
by R.A. No. 7659, and classified as other cases of arson. These include

houses, dwellings, government buildings, farms, mills, plantations,
railways, bus stations, airports, wharves and other industrial

establishments. Although the purpose of the law on Simple Arson

is to prevent the high incidence of fires and other crimes involving
destruction, protect the national economy and preserve the social,
economic and political stability of the nation, P.D. No. 1613 tempers
the penalty to be meted to offenders. This separate classification of
Simple Arson recognizes the need to lessen the severity of punishment
commensurate to the act or acts committed, depending on the
particular facts and circumstances of each case. (People v. Soriano,
G.R. No. 142565, July 29, 2003)

Burning of Houses, considered Simple Arson under P.D. No. 1613.

Where the properties burned by accused-appellant are
specifically described as houses, contemplating inhabited houses or
dwellings under P.D. No. 1613 and the descriptions as alleged in the
Information particularly refer to the structures as houses rather than
as buildings or edifices, the applicable law is Section 3, paragraph 2, of
P.D. No. 1613, and not Article 320, paragraph 1 of the R.P.C. In case
of ambiguity in construction of penal laws, it is well-settled that such
laws shall be construed strictly against the government, and liberally
in favor of the accused. (People v. Soriano, supra)

Accused-appellant was charged with having intentionally burned
the two-storey residential house of Robert Separa. Said conflagration
likewise spread and destroyed seven adjoining houses. Consequently,
if proved, as it was proved, at the trial, she may be convicted, and
sentenced accordingly, of the crime of simple arson. (People v.
Malngan, G.R. No. 170470, September 26, 2006, 503 SCRA 294)
The appellant testified that his burnt two-storey house was
used as a residence. That the appellant’s act that affected many
families will not convert the crime to destructive arson, since the
appellant’s act does not appear to be heinous or represents a greater
degree of perversity and viciousness when compared to those acts
punished under Article 320 of the R.P.C. The established evidence
only showed that the appellant intended to bum his own house, but
the conflagration spread to the neighboring houses. The accused is
liable for simple arson. (People v. Macabando, GJi. No. 188708, July
31, 2013)

Attempted, frustrated and consummated arson.
1.

2.

3.

A person, intending to burn a wooden structure, collects
some rags, soaks them in gasoline and places them beside
the wooden wall of the building. When he is about to light a
match to set fire to the rags, he is discovered by another who
chases him away.

The crime committed is attempted arson, because the
offender commences the commission of the crime directly by
overt acts (placing the rags soaked in gasoline beside the
wooden wall of the building and lighting a match) but he does
not perform all the acts of execution (the setting of fire to the
rags) due to the timely intervention of another who chases
away the offender.
If that person is able to light or set fire to the rags but the
fire was put out before any part of the building was burned,
it is frustrated. (U.S. v. Valdez, 39 Phil. 240)

But if before the fire was put out, it had burned a part of the
building, it is consummated.
Any charring of the wood of a building, whereby the fiber
of the wood is destroyed, is sufficient. It is not necessary that
the wood should be ablazed. (4 Am. Jur. 88-89)
And the mere fact that a building is scorched or discolored
by heat is not sufficient to constitute consummated arson.
Setting fire to the contents of a building constitutes the
consummated crime of setting fire to a building, even if no
part of the building was burned. (U.S. v. Go Foo Suy, 25 Phil.
187)

In attempted arson, it is not necessary that there be a fire.

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 326-B

more weight in the decision of the case. In the case of People v. Garcia,
the action of the defendant to set fire to the contents of the building
was prompted not by a desire to bum the hospital but to give vent to
his anger against the head of the Provincial Hospital with whom he
had a heated discussion. There were no prior acts by the defendant
in that case which would tend to show a determination or resolution
to bum the building. In the case at bar, however, there is abundant
evidence manifesting the defendant’s desire to bum the building. He
adhered resolutely to that desire by performing acts that would carry
into effect his plan.

Furthermore, reviewing the scant decisions of the Supreme
Court on the crime of arson, th[e] Court noted that the presence of
blaze does not necessarily lead to the crime of attempted arson. On the
contrary, when there is fire, the Supreme Court has held invariably
that crime committed is either frustrated arson or consummated
arson, never attempted. Thus, in the case of U.S. v. Go Foo Suy, 25
Phil. 187, it was held that setting fire to the contents of a building
constitutes the consummated crime of setting fire to a building, even
if no part of the building was burned; in the case of U.S. v. Valdes, 39
Phil. 240, if the defendant has started a blaze by burning rags soaked
with gasoline placed near the building but the fire is put out before
any part of the building commences to bum, the crime is frustrated
arson; and in the case of People u. Hernandez, 54 Phil. 122, if a part
of the building commences to bum, the crime is consummated arson,
however small is the portion of the building burned. (People v. Go
Kay, CA., 54 O.G. 2225)

Section 3, paragraph 2, P.D. No. 1613.
If the property burned is an inhabited house or dwelling, it is
not required that the house be occupied by one or more persons and
the offender knew it when the house was burned.

It is not necessary that there be a fire before the crime of
attempted arson can be committed, notwithstanding the ruling in
the case of People v. Garcia, 49 O.G. 558, where a blaze having been
started, it was held that the crime committed was attempted arson.
The law does not lay down any hard and fast rule insofar as attempted
arson, or any attempted crime for that matter, is concerned. The
peculiar facts and circumstances of a particular case should carry

the main objective of the malefactor: (a) if the main objective is the
burning of the building or edifice, but death results by reason or on

the occasion of arson, the crime is simply arson, and the resulting
homicide is absorbed; (b) if, on the other hand, the main objective is
to kill a particular person who may be in a building or edifice, when
fire is resorted to as the means to accomplish such goal the crime
committed is murder only; lastly, (c) if the objective is, likewise, to
kill a particular person, and in fact the offender has already done so,
but fire is resorted to as a means to cover up the killing, then there
are two separate and distinct crimes committed homicide/murder
and arson. (People v. Baluntong, G.R. No. 182061, March 15, 2010,
citing People v. Malingan, 503 SCRA 294)

Standing alone, unexplained or uncontradicted, any of those

circumstances is sufficient to establish the fact of arson.

—

There is no complex crime of arson with homicide.

Presidential Decree No. 1613 provides that if by reason of or
on the occasion of arson, death results, the penalty of reclusion
perpetua to death shall be imposed. The crime of homicide is absorbed.
Considering that P.D. No. 9346 prohibits the imposition of the death
penalty, only the penalty of reclusion perpetua shall be imposed for
arson resulting in death.
It is settled that there is no complex crime of arson with homicide,
if death results by reason or on the occasion of arson, the crime is
simply arson although the imposable penalty as provided in Section
5 of P.D. No. 1613, which expressly repealed Articles 320 to 326-B of
the R.P.C., is now reclusion perpetua to death. If the objective of the
offender is to kill and arson is resorted to as the means to accomplish
the crime, the offender can be charged with murder only. But if the
objective is to kill— and in fact the offender has already done so— and
arson is resorted to as a means to cover up the killing, the offender
may be convicted of two separate crimes of either homicide or murder,
and arson.
Considering that the prosecution was able to show with moral
certainty that the killing of the four victims was attended with evident
premeditation and the burning was done to disguise the murder,
appellants are guilty of arson and four counts of murder. (People v.
Cedenio, G.R. No. 93485, June 27, 1994)
Prlma facie evidence of arson.
Any of the seven circumstances enumerated in Section 6 of P-DNo. 1613 shall constitute prima facie evidence of arson.

another any damage not falling within the terms of the next
preceding chapter, shall be guilty of malicious mischief.

Elements of malicious mischief:
1.

That the offender deliberately caused damage to the property
of another.

2.

That such act does not constitute arson or other crimes
involving destruction.

1112

That the act of damaging another*s property be committed merely
for the sake of damaging it.

Note: This third element presupposes that the offender acted
due to hate, revenge or other evil motive.

Chapter Nine

1.

Art. 327

"Shall deliberately cause to the property of another any damage.”
This phrase means that the offender should act under this
impulse of a specific desire to inflict injury to another.
It follows that, in the very nature of things, malicious mischief
cannot be committed through negligence, since culpa and malice are
essentially incompatible. (Quizon v. Justice of the Peace, et al. 97
Phil. 342)
Bumping the car of another due to anger and hate is malicious
mischief.
Facts: At the parking area of the Rockwell Powerplant Mall, private
complainant was driving his Honda CRV from the 3rd basement parking,
while petitioner was driving his Suzuki Vitara from the 2nd basement
parking. When they were about to queue at the comer to pay the parking
fees, the respective vehicles were edging each other. The CRV was ahead of
the queue, but the Vitara tried to overtake, resulting in the touching of their
side view mirrors. The side view mirror of the Vitara was pushed backward
and the side view mirror of the CRV was pushed forward. This prompted the
private complainant’s wife and daughter to alight from the CRV and confront
the petitioner. As Petitioner appeared to be hostile, private complainant
instructed his wife and daughter to go back to the CRV. While they were
returning to the car, petitioner accelerated the Vitara and moved backward
as if to hit them. The CRV, having been overtaken by the Vitara, took another
lane. Private complainant was able to pay the parking fee at the booth ahead
of petitioner. When the CRV was at the upward ramp leading to the exit, the
Vitara bumped the CRVs rear portion and pushed the CRV until it hit the
stainless steel railing located at the exit portion of the ramp. As a result of
the collision, the CRV sustained damage at the back bumper spare tires and
the front bumper, the repair of which amounted to P57,464.66.
Held: Petitioner is guilty of malicious mischief. First, the hitting of
the back portion of the CRV by the petitioner was clearly deliberate. Second,
the act of damaging the rear bumper of the CRV does not constitute arson
or other crimes involving destruction. Lastly, when the Vitara bumped the
CRV, the petitioner was just giving vent to his anger and hate as a result of
a heated encounter between him and the private complainant. (Taguinod u.
People, G.R. No. 185833, October 12, 2011)

Destroying property out of hatred, revenge or evil motive.
The elements of malicious mischief have been duly proven:

Petitioners admitted in their ukontra salaysay” that Teofilo
deliberately destroyed the fence and its cement foundation,
and made diggings in the subject property;
(2) The destruction did not constitute arson or other crime
(1)

involving destruction;
(3)

The act of damaging another’s property was committed
merely for the sake of damaging it.

Under the third element, assuming that petitioner Teofilo
owned the property in controversy, he and his co-accused were not
justified in summarily destroying the improvements built thereon
by Bolbes. They unlawfully took the law into their own hands when
they surreptitiously entered Bolbes’ enclosed lot and destroyed its
fence and foundation. Evidently, petitioner’s actions were made out
of hatred, revenge or evil motive. (Grana v. People, G.R. No. 202111,
November 25, 2019)
Killing the cow of another as an act of revenge is malicious mischief.

When the defendants were asked by the offended party why
they butchered his cow, one of them replied.- “We butchered it because
the cow entered our property,” and invited the offended party to come
close and settle the matter. There being no sufficient evidence that the
intention of the defendants was to divide the meat among themselves,
it was held that the killing of the cow was an act of revenge and,
therefore, the crime committed was that of malicious mischief. (People
v. Valiente, et al., CA.-G.R. No. 9442-R, December 29, 1953)
Is it malicious mischief if the act of damaging another’s property
was inspired, not by hatred or by a desire for revenge, but by the
mere pleasure of destroying?

Yes. Malicious mischief embraces those attempts against
another’s property inspired sometimes by hatred or a desire for
revenge and sometimes by the mere pleasure of destroying. (See
People v. Siddayao, CA., 53 O.G. 8163)
1114

TITLE TEN
Crimes Against Property

Art. 327

Thus, if the only evidence of the prosecution was that the

defendant shot two pigs belonging to another and that the motive

for the defendant’s shooting at the pigs was that the animals were
then loose inside his rice plantation, the defendant is not guilty of
malicious mischief because he was not prompted by hatred or a desire
for revenge when he shot the pigs. Nor did he shoot them for the mere
pleasure of destroying. The Court found that when Siddayao saw the
two pigs causing damage to his farm, he borrowed the rifle of Pascual
Garcia, who was then with him, and fired twice which wounded the
two pigs. At most, he might have incurred liability of purely civil in
nature.

If no malice, only civil liability.
If there was no malice in causing the damage, the obligation to
repair or pay for damages is only civil. (Art. 2176, New Civil Code)
Example:

A cut small coconut trees on a disputed land to clear it and for the
purpose of cultivating that portion of the land. In view of his purpose,
A is not liable for malicious mischief. He did not deliberately cause
damage to the property of another, since the land is disputed and he
believed that the coconut trees belonged to him.
But when the defendants, one of them and the father of the
other were former occupants of the land, cut 80 coconut shoots,
which were producing tuba, without having any right to do so, and
that they occasioned thereby serious damage to the interests of those
who planted the trees, the defendants executed this act, prompted,
doubtless, by grievance, hate, or revenge, because the injured party
had leased the land from the hacienda after one of them and the
father of the other defendant had been expelled from said land by the
owners. When the injured party tried to stop the damage they were
causing to the property, the defendants threatened her and followed
her as far as the road. In this case, the defendants are not only civilly,
but also criminally, liable. (U.S. v. Gerale, 4 Phil. 218)
The crime of damage to property (malicious mischief) is not
determined solely by the mere act of inflicting injury upon the property
of a third person, but it must be shown that the act had for its object,
the injury of the property merely for the sake of damaging it. (U.S.

3.

If after damaging the property, the offender removes or makes
use of the fruits or objects of the damage, it is theft. (Art. 308, par. 2)
Damaging of property must not result from crime.

This article does not refer to mischief resulting from a crime,
such as the damages caused by a robber in breaking the window,
for the reason that such damages are mere incidents of the crime of
robbery, and as such may give rise only to civil liability. (Guevara)
Also, when the accused chased his opponent who ran to the
kitchen of the offended party, and tumbled some tables on his way,
thereby breaking various objects, he was not guilty of malicious
mischief, because he did not do it with deliberate or only purpose of
causing damages. (People v. Collantes, C.A.-G.R. No. 12086, February
24, 1955)

Destroying or damaging statues, public monuments, or
paintings. (Art. 331)

Damage means not only loss but also diminution of what is a
man’s own. Thus, damage to another’s house includes defacing it.
(People v. Asido, et al., C-A., 59 O.G. 3646)

May a person charged with malicious mischief be found guilty of
damage to property through reckless imprudence?

Yes. Reckless imprudence is not a crime in itself. It is simply
a way of committing it. The allegation in the information that the
accused acted willfully, maliciously, unlawfully and criminally, not
being objected to, includes the charge that he acted with negligence.
Negligence is punishable when it results in a crime, as in this case.

Mischiefs not included in Article 328 are punished according to
the value of the damage caused.

First case of qualified malicious mischief distinguished from
sedition.
This mischief mentioned in the first clause (No. 1) is to be
distinguished from sedition (Art. 139), in that the element of public

Even if the amount involved cannot be estimated, the penalty
of arresto menor or fine not exceeding P40.000 is fixed by law.
A groom who allowed a horse under his care to die of hunger

or a servant who released a bird from the cage, as an act of hate or

penalty is based on the value of the horse or bird.

The two offenses are, however, similar in that there is present in

EXEMPTION FROM CRIMINAL LIABILITY
IN CRIMES AGAINST PROPERTY

—

Art. 332. Persons exempt from criminal liability.
No criminal, but only civil liability shall result from the

commission of the crime of theft, swindling, or malicious
mischief committed or caused mutually by the following
persons:
1. Spouses, ascendants and descendants, or relatives
by affinity in the same line;
2. The widowed spouse with respect to the property
which belonged to the deceased spouse before the same shall
have passed into the possession of another; and
3. Brothers and sisters and brothers-in-law and
sisters-in-law, if living together.
The exemption established by this article shall not be
applicable to strangers participating in the commission of
the crime.

Crimes involved in the exemption:

1.

Theft,

2.

Swindling (estafa),

3.

Malicious mischief.

There Is only civil liability.

No criminal, but only civil liability shall result from the
commission of any said crimes, committed or caused mutually by
those persons. (Par. 1, Art. 332)
“Committed or caused mutually” by the persons mentioned in
Article 332.

A was indebted to B in the sum of P100.00. C, son of B,
without the knowledge or consent of the latter, went to A and falsely
represented to him that B sent him (C) to collect. Believing the
statement of C to be true, A gave P100.00 to C. The money was not
turned over to B, as C spent it for himself.

Is Article 332 applicable?

No. The offended party in this case is A, not B. Article 332 is
applicable only when the offender and the offended party are relatives
and their relationship is any of those mentioned in said article.
Reason for exemption from criminal liability.
The law recognizes the presumed co-ownership of the property

between the offender and the offended party.

Note: Hence, if the crime is robbery or estafa through falsification,
this article does not apply. Thus, if the son committed estafa through
falsification of a commercial document against his father, he is
criminally liable for the crime of falsification.

This article does not apply to stranger who participates in the
commission of the crime.

mischief with respect to property of deceased.

The stepfather and stepmother are included as ascendants by
affinity. (People v. Alvarez, 52 Phil. 65; People v. Adame, et al., CA.,
40 O.G., Supp. 12, 63)

A stepfather, who was angry with his stepson, took the suitcase
of the latter with its contents and burned it in an orchard. As this
crime should be treated as malicious mischief only, the stepfather is
not criminally liable. (People v. Alvarez, 52 Phil. 65)
An adopted or natural child should also be considered as relatives
included in the term “descendants" and a concubine or paramour
within the term “spouses." (Guevara)
Article 332 applies to common-law spouses.
[The Court] should not draw hair-splitting distinction between

a couple whose cohabitation is sanctioned by a sacrament or legal
tie and another who are husband and wife de facto. In actual life, no
difference in relationship exists. Even our Civil Code concedes to a
man and a woman who live together as husband and wife without
benefit of ceremony, the right of co-ownership to the “property
acquired by either or both of them through their work or industry or
their wages and salaries.” (Art. 144, Civil Code; People v. Constantino,
CA., 60 O.G. 3605)
Effect of death on relationship by affinity as absolutory cause.

For purposes of Article 332(1) of the R.P.C., the relationship by
affinity created between the surviving spouse and the blood relatives
of the deceased spouse survives the death of either party to the
marriage which created the affinity. (Intestate Estate of Manolita
Gonzales Vda. de Carungcong v. People, G.R. No. 181409, February

To be exempt from criminal liability, it is required that

—

(1)

the property belongs to the deceased spouse; and

(2)

it has not passed into the possession of a third person.

Brothers and sisters, and brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law must be
living together at the time of the commission of any of the crimes
of theft, estafa or malicious mischief.
Thus, when the accused, the brother-in-law of the offended
party, was living in the house of the offended party at the time he
received Pl,000 from the latter to buy plumbing fixtures for her, and
misappropriated it to her prejudice, there was only civil liability.
(People v. Navas, CA., 51 O.G. 219)
Article 332 applies only to the simple crimes of theft, swindling and
malicious mischief, and not where any of said crimes is complexed
with another crime.

The absolutory cause under Article 332 of the R.P.C. only applies
to the felonies of theft, swindling and malicious mischief. Under the
said provision, the State condones the criminal responsibility of the
offender in cases of theft, swindling and malicious mischief. As an
act of grace, the State waives its right to prosecute the offender for
the said crimes but leaves the private offended party with the option
to hold the offender civilly liable.

However, the coverage of Article 332 is strictly limited to the
felonies mentioned therein. The plain, categorical and unmistakable
language of the provision shows that it applies exclusively to the
simple crimes of theft, swindling and malicious mischief. It does
not apply where any of the crimes mentioned under Article 332 is
complexed with another crime, such as theft through falsification or
estafa through falsification. (Intestate Estate of Manolita Gonzales
Vda. de Carungcong v. People, supra)

1124

Art. 332

1125

Art. 332

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Effect of absolutory cause under Article 332 on criminal liability
for the complex crime of estafa through falsification of public
documents.

The absolutory cause under Article 332 is meant to address
specific crimes against property, namely, the simple crimes of theft,
swindling and malicious mischief. Thus, all other crimes, whether
simple or complex, are not affected by the absolutory cause provided
by the said provision. To apply the absolutory cause under Article
332 of the R.P.C. to one of the component crimes of a complex crime
for the purpose of negating the existence of that complex crime is
to unduly expand the scope of Article 332. In other words, to apply
Article 332 to the complex crime of estafa through falsification of
public document would be to mistakenly treat the crime of estafa
as a separate simple crime, not as the component crime that it is in
that situation. It would wrongly consider the indictment as separate
charges of estafa and falsification of public document, not as a single
charge for the single (complex) crime of estafa through falsification
of public document.

Under Article 332 of the R.P.C., the State waives its right to
hold the offender criminally liable for the simple crimes of theft,
swindling and malicious mischief and considers the violation of the
juridical right to property committed by the offender against certain
family members as a private matter and therefore subject only to civil
liability. The waiver does not apply when the violation of the right to
property is achieved through (and therefore inseparably intertwined
with) a breach of the public interest in the integrity and presumed
authenticity of public documents. For, in the latter instance, what
is involved is no longer simply the property right of a family
relation but a paramount public interest. (Intestate Estate of
Manolita Gonzales Vda. de Carungcong v. People, supra)

TITLE ELEVEN

Crimea Against Chastity

Art. 333

“Even If the marriage be subsequently declared void.”

In view of this phrase used in Article 333, it is not necessary
that there be a valid marriage between the offended husband and
the guilty woman.
There is adultery, even if the marriage of the guilty woman with
the offended husband is subsequently declared void. (Art. 333)

Elements of adultery:

1.

That the woman is married;

2.

That she has sexual intercourse with a man not her husband;

3.

That as regards the man with whom she has sexual
intercourse, he must know her to be married.

The woman must be married.
The legitimacy of the marriage relation between the offended
husband and the defendant wife is one of the circumstances which
must necessarily attend the crime of adultery.

Once it is shown that a man and a woman lived as husband and
wife, and none of the parties denied and contradicted the allegation
in the complaint, the presumption of their being married must be
admitted as a fact. (U.S. v. Villafuerte, 4 Phil. 476)
The declaration of the husband is competent evidence to show the
fact of marriage. A witness who was present at the time the marriage
took place is likewise a competent witness to testify as to the marriage
between the parties. (U.S. v. Memoracion, et al., 34 Phil. 633)
The offended party must be legally married to the offender at the
time of the criminal case.

The person who initiates the adultery case must be an offended
spouse, and by this is meant that he is still married to the accused
spouse, at the time of the filing of the complaint. Thus, where the
offended party (a foreigner) in an adultery case already obtained a
divorce in his country before the adultery proceedings are commenced,
he no longer has the right to institute proceedings against the
offenders. (Pilapil u. Ibay-Somera, 174 SCRA 653)

1128

Reason for punishing adultery even if the marriage Is subsequently
declared void.

At no time does the bond of matrimony contain a defect which by
itself is sufficient to dissolve the union. Until the marriage is declared
to be null and void by competent authority in a final judgment, the
offense to the vows taken, and the attack on the family exists the
adultery reunites the essential conditions required for its punishment.
(U.S. v. Mata, 18 Phil. 490)

—

Note: In this case, the offended husband had been married in
China before he married the accused Jacinta Mata in the Philippines
Carnal knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence.

The finding in the possession of a married woman of several
love letters signed by her paramour, their having been together in
different places; and the fact that they were surprised in a well known
assignation house which the accused woman admitted to have visited
six times in company with her paramour are data and indications
sufficient to convict them both of adultery. (U.S. v. Legaspi, et al., 14
Phil. 38)

The evidence which was considered sufficient: (1) photograph
showing the intimate relations of the two accused; and (2) testimony
of a witness to the effect that the two accused were in scant apparel
and sleeping together. Such evidence is sufficient to show that the two
accused had the opportunity to satisfy their adulterous inclination.
(U.S. v. Feliciano, 36 Phil. 753)
Direct proof of carnal knowledge is not necessary to sustain
a conviction for adultery. In the very nature of things, it is seldom
that adultery can be established by direct evidence. The legal tenet,
therefore, has been and still is that circumstantial and corroborative
evidence such as will lead the guarded discretion of a reasonable and
1129

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimes Against Chastity

just man to the conclusion that the criminal act of adultery has been
committed, will suffice to bring about a conviction for that crime. In
the instant case, defendant lived together as husband and wife in
different places, at diverse times and for certain periods, and actually
were seen lying together at late hours of the night in their underwears
and caressing and embracing each other. These facts more than
sufficiently prove the crime herein involved. (People v. Dante, et al.,
CA., 51 O.G. 801, citing U.S. v. Legaspi, 14 Phil. 38, 40-41; U.S. v.
Feliciano, 36 Phil. 753, 754-755; People v. Fernando, CA.-G.R. No.
7148-R promulgated February 15, 1952)

Gist of the crime.
The gist of the crime of adultery is the danger of introducing
spurious heirs into the family, where the rights of the real heirs may
be impaired and a man may be charged with the maintenance of a
family not his own. (U.S. u. Mata, 18 Phil. 490)

Art. 333

Note: This kind of evidence is not sufficient for the application
of Article 247, which requires that a married person should surprise
his spouse in the act of sexual intercourse with another person.
Each sexual Intercourse constitutes a crime of adultery.
The first complaint for adultery covered the period from 1946 to
March 14, 1947. The defendant-wife pleaded guilty and was sentenced.
The second complaint for adultery, filed subsequently, covered the
period from March 15, 1947 to September 17, 1948. A motion to quash
the second complaint was filed on the ground that they would be twice
put in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense.

Held: The crime of adultery is an instantaneous crime which
is consummated and completed at the moment of the carnal union.
Each sexual intercourse constitutes a crime of adultery.

Even if the husband should pardon his adulterous wife, such
pardon would not exempt the wife and her paramour from criminal
liability for adulterous acts committed after the pardon had been
granted, because the pardon refers to previous and not to subsequent
adulterous acts. (People v. Zapata and Bondoc, 88 Phil. 688, citing
Cuello Colon, Derecho Penal, Vol. II, p. 569, and Viada [5th Ed.], Vol.
5, p. 208, and Groizard [2nd Ed.], Vol. 5, pp. 57-58)
Adultery, therefore, is not a continuing offense.

Essence of adultery.
The essence of adultery is the violation of the marital vow.
1130

Art. 333

Abandonment without justification is not exempting, but only
mitigating circumstance.
If the person guilty of adultery committed the offense while being

abandoned without justification by the offended spouse, the penalty
next lower in degree shall be imposed, (last par., Art. 333)
Abandonment could not serve her as an excuse or free her from
the criminal responsibility she incurred by the breach of fidelity she
owed her husband, for she had means within the law to compel him
to fulfill the duties imposed upon him by marriage. (U.S. v. Serrano,
et al., 28 Phil. 230)
Sheer necessity, mitigating liability of the married woman.

The husband who was believed dead, later returned and found
his wife and children living with another man.
Although the woman was not abandoned by her husband in a way
that would constitute the mitigating circumstance, for he left her in
response to a duty, yet she was left helpless and in such a great need
that she found herself in the predicament of committing adultery for
the sake of her three children. Moreover, she then believed in good
faith that her husband had died in the sea.
It was held that her responsibility arising from her act of giving
herself up to the man who had lent her a helping hand during such
time of want and need should be considered mitigated two-fold by
sheer necessity. (People v. Alberto, et al., CA., 47 O.G. 2438)

Both defendants are entitled to this mitigating circumstance.

Abandonment should be a mitigating circumstance for both
offenders, and the rule in Article 62, paragraph 3, that the mitigating

or aggravating circumstances which arise from the private relationship
of the accused with the offended party should be considered only as
1131

Art 333

regards those having that relationship should not apply to the crime
of adultery, because the act is only one, judicially speaking, since
the individual act in itself does not constitute the felony. (People v.
Avelino, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 11, 194)
Pari delicto is not a defense.

Where the accused claims that her husband’s extra-marital
affair precludes him from filing a criminal complaint for adultery on
the ground of pari delicto, the Court held that: The concept of pari
delicto is not found in the Revised Penal Code, but only in Article
1411 of the Civil Code. The Court notes that Article 1411 of the Civil
Code relates only to contracts with illegal consideration. This case
does not involve any illegal contract which either of the contracting
parties is now seeking to enforce. (Arroyo, Jr. v. Court of Appeals,
G.R. No. 96602, November 19, 1991)
The man, to be guilty of adultery, must have knowledge of the
married status of the woman.

The man may be single or married.
With respect to the man, knowledge that the woman with whom
he had sexual intercourse is married, is an essential element that
must be established if he is to be convicted of adultery.

And although in the beginning, the man did not know of the
woman’s married status, but he continued his illicit relations with her
after he gained knowledge of such status, he will be guilty of adultery
as regards the sexual intercourse done after having such knowledge.
(U.S. u. Topino, et al., 35 Phil. 901)
A married man who is not liable for adultery, because he
did not know that the woman was married, may be held liable for
concubinage.
A married man might not be guilty of adultery, on the ground
that he did not know that the woman was married, but if he appeared
to be guilty of any of the acts defined in Article 334, he would be liable
for concubinage. (Del Prado v. De la Fuerte, 28 Phil. 23)
But the married woman is guilty of adultery. If she knew that
the man was married, she would be liable for concubinage also.
1132

TITLE ELEVEN

Art. 333

Effect of the acquittal of one of the defendants.

It does not operate as a cause for acquittal of the other.
Reasons of the Supreme Court:
(a)

There may not be a joint criminal intent, although there
is joint physical act.

(b)

Thus, one of the parties may be insane and the other sane,
in which case, only the sane could be held liable criminally.

(c)

Thus, also, the man may not know that the woman is
married, in which case, the man is innocent.

(d)

Thus, also, the death of the woman during the pendency
of the action cannot defeat the trial and conviction of the
man. (U.S. v. De la Torre and Gregorio, 25 Phil. 36)

(e)

Even if the man had left the country and could not be
apprehended, the woman can be tried and convicted. (U.S.
v. Topino and Guzman, 35 Phil. 901)

Effect of death of paramour.

It will not bar prosecution against the unfaithful wife, because
the requirement that both offenders should be included in the
complaint is absolute only when the two offenders are alive. (See par.
2, Art. 344)
Effect of death of offended party.

The proceedings must continue. The theory that a man’s honor

ceases to exist from the moment that he dies is not acceptable. Article
353 seeks to protect the honor and reputation not only of the living
but of dead persons as well. Moreover, even assuming that there is
a presumed pardon upon the offended party’s death, pardon granted
after criminal proceedings have been instituted cannot extinguish
criminal liability. (People v. Diego, CA., 38 O.G. 2537)

But if he dies before a complaint could be filed, the case cannot
go on, because no one can sign and file the complaint.

1133

Art. 333

Effect of pardon.

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

—

Article 344 requires that
1. The pardon must come before the institution of the criminal
prosecution; and
2. Both the offenders must be pardoned by the offended party.
In view of these requirements, a motion to dismiss filed on behalf
of the defendant wife alone based on an affidavit executed by the
offended husband in which he pardoned her for her infidelity cannot
prosper. (People o. Infante, 57 Phil. 138)
Pardon must be made before filing of criminal complaint.

While there is a conceptual difference between consent and
pardon in the sense that consent is granted prior to the adulterous
act while pardon is given after the adulterous affair, nevertheless,
for either consent or pardon to benefit the accused, it must be
given prior to the filing of a criminal complaint. In the present
case, the affidavit of desistance was executed only on 23 November
1988 while the compromise agreement was executed only on
16 February 1989, after the trial court had already rendered its
decision dated 17 December 1987 finding petitioners guilty beyond
reasonable doubt.
While Article 344 of the Revised Penal Code provides that
the crime of adultery cannot be prosecuted without the offended
spouse’s complaint, once the complaint has been filed, the control
of the case passes to the public prosecutor. Enforcement of our
law on adultery is not exclusively, nor even principally, a matter
of vindication of the private honor of the offended spouse; much
less is it a matter merely of personal or social hypocrisy. Such
enforcement relates, more importantly, to protection of the basic
social institutions of marriage and the family in the preservation
of which the State has the strongest interest; the public policy here
involved is of the most fundamental kind. (Arroyo, Jr. v. Court of
Appeals, G.R. No. 96602, November 19, 1991)
Act of intercourse subsequent to adulterous conduct is an implied
pardon.

The act of having intercourse with the offending spouse
subsequent to adulterous conduct is, at best, an implied pardon of said
adulterous conduct. But it does not follow that, in order to operate
as such, an express pardon must also be accompanied by intercourse
between the spouses thereafter. Where the pardon given is express

not merely implied the act of pardon by itself operates as such
whether sexual intercourse accompanies the same or not. (People v.
Muguerza, et al., 13 CA. Rep. 1079)

Effect of consent
The husband, knowing that his wife, after serving sentence
for adultery, resumed living with her co-defendant, did nothing to
interfere with their relations or to assert his rights as husband.
Shortly thereafter, he left for Hawaii where he remained for seven
years completely abandoning his wife and child.
Held: The second charge of adultery should be dismissed because
of consent. (People v. Sensano and Ramos, 58 Phil. 73)
Agreement to separate.

While the agreement is void in law, it is nevertheless, competent

evidence to explain the husband’s inaction after he knew of his wife’s
living with her co-accused. He may be considered as having consented
to the infidelity of his wife, which bars him from instituting criminal
complaint. (People v. Guinucud, et al., 58 Phil. 621)
Under the law, there is no accomplice in adultery.
Under the law, there cannot be an accomplice in the crime of
adultery, although in fact there can be such an accomplice. (Decision
of the Supreme Court of Spain of June 3, 1874; Viada, 3 Codigo Penal

Art. 334

Three ways of committing the crime of concubinage:

1.

By keeping a mistress in the conjugal dwelling; or

2.

By having sexual intercourse, under scandalous circumstances
with a woman who is not his wife; or

3.

By cohabiting with her in any other place.

Art. 334

Concubinage by keeping a mistress in the conjugal dwelling.

a.

Keeping a mistress in the conjugal dwelling,

b.

Having sexual intercourse under scandalous circumstances
with a woman who is not his wife;

The wife left the conjugal home and lived with her parents
because of troubles between her husband and herself. The husband
took into the house his co-accused and they lived together conjugally.
They were seen feeding and caressing each other.
Held: The husband was guilty of concubinage by keeping a
mistress in the conjugal dwelling. When the mistress lived in the
dwelling of the spouses for about two months, no positive proof of
actual intercourse is necessary, it appearing that the mistress is
pregnant not by any other man and that they were surprised on the
same bed. (People v. Bacon, CA., 44 O.G. 2760)
“Scandalous circumstances” are not necessary to make a husband
guilty of concubinage by keeping a mistress in the copjugal dwelling.
(See U.S. v. Macabagbag, et al., 31 Phil. 257)

c.

Cohabiting with her in any other place.

Who is a mistress?

Elements:
1.

That the man must be married.

2.

That he committed any of the following acts:

3.

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimea Against Chastity

That as regards the woman, she must know him to be married.

Concubinage is a violation of the marital vow.

Like adultery, concubinage is a violation of the marital vow.
It is, however, unlike adultery in the sense that the infidelity of the
husband does not bring into the family, spurious offspring.
The offenders are the married man and the woman who knows him
to be married.

The offender must be a married man. The woman becomes liable
only when she knew him to be married prior to the commission of the
crime.
A married man is not liable for concubinage for mere sexual relations
with a woman not his wife.

Although Josefa Diaz lived in the house of the spouses Hilao, she
was never considered as concubine of accused Jesus Hilao. She was
voluntarily taken and sheltered thereat and treated as an adopted
child by the spouses. She did not live, dwell, or remain in the spouses’
dwelling in any capacity other than as a child or ward by the spouses.
(People v. Jesus Hilao, et al., CA., 52 O.G. 904)
Note: In view of the rulings in the cases of People v. Bacon, supra,
and People v. Hilao, supra, it is necessary that the woman is taken
by the accused into the conjugal dwelling as a concubine.

What is a conjugal dwelling?

By “conjugal dwelling” is meant the home of the husband and
wife even if the wife happens to be temporarily absent on any account.
A house, constructed from the proceeds of the sale of conjugal
properties of the spouses, especially where they had intended it to

be so, is a conjugal dwelling, and the fact that the wife never had a

A married man is liable for concubinage only when he does any
of the three acts specified in Article 334. If his sexual relations with a
woman not his wife is not any one of them, he is not criminally liable.

chance to reside therein and that the husband used it with his mistress
instead, does not detract from its nature. (People v. Cordova, CA.,

circumstances.

In the third way of committing the crime, mere cohabitation is
sufficient. Proof of scandalous circumstances is not necessary. (People
v. Pitoc, et al., 43 Phil. 760)
Where a married man and a woman began their illicit relations
in 1937 and went to Naga where they dwelt together as husband and
wife in the house of one Alfonsa Toledo, occupying one room in which
they slept alone, it was held that his association with his co-accused
is sufficient to constitute a cohabitation within the meaning of the
law even disregarding proofs of actual sexual intercourse. (Ocampo
v. People, 72 Phil. 268)

It is only when the mistress is kept elsewhere (outside of the
conjugal dwelling) that “scandalous circumstances’ become an
element of the crime. (U.S. v. Macabagbag, et al., 31 Phil. 257)

Scandal consists in any reprehensible word or deed that offends
public conscience, redounds to the detriment of the feelings of honest
persons, and gives occasion to the neighbors’ spiritual damage or ruin.
(People v. Santos, et al., 45 O.G. 2116)
The scandal produced by the concubinage of a married man
occurs not only when (1) he and his mistress live in the same room

of a house, but also when (2) they appear together in public, and (3)
perform acts in sight of the community which give rise to criticism
and general protest among the neighbors.
The qualifying expression “under scandalous circumstances*
refers to the act of sexual intercourse which may be proved by
circumstantial evidence.
The people in the vicinity are the best witnesses to prove scandalous

circumstances.

If none of the acts of the defendants were proved by the testimony
of the people from the vicinity, there is no scandal. The testimony of
the offended wife that in a house she saw her husband and the other
woman lying side by side and on several occasions she saw them
going together to different places, is not sufficient to convict them of
concubinage. (U.S. v. Casipong, et al., 20 Phil. 178)
So, for the existence of the crime of concubinage by having sexual
intercourse under scandalous circumstances, the offender must be so
imprudent and wanton as to offend modesty and that innate sense of
morality and decency of the people in the neighborhood.
When spies are employed, there is no evidence of scandalous

circumstances.

When spies are employed for the purpose of watching the conduct
of the accused and it appearing that none of the people living in the
vicinity has observed any suspicious conduct on his part in relation
with his co-accused, there is no evidence of scandalous circumstances.
(U.S. v. Campos Rueda, 35 Phil. 51)
1138

Meaning of “cohabit”

The term “cohabit" means to dwell together, in the manner of
husband and wife, for some period of time, as distinguished from
occasional, transient interviews for unlawful intercourse. Hence,
the offense is not a single act of adultery; it is cohabiting in a state
of adultery which may be a week, a month, a year or longer. (People
v. Pitoc, et al., 43 Phil. 760)
Thus, there is no concubinage if a married man is surprised in
the act of sexual intercourse with a woman not his wife in a hotel.
Thus, also, a person who keeps a mistress in an apartment
furnished by him is not guilty of concubinage if he does not live or
sleep with her in said apartment.
In the case of People v. Santos, et al., C.A., 45 O.G. 2116, where in
a room in the Philippine General Hospital the offended wife surprised
her husband and another woman lying on the same bed, her husband
wearing pants and the co-accused wearing ordinary dress, it was held
that there was no cohabitation, because the man had his quarters in
the Philippine General Hospital while the woman had her home at

350 Taft Avenue.

Charging the accused with concubinage, the prosecution proved
only that the accused is married and that he is the father of a
child
born of another woman, his co-accused. Is he guilty of concubinage?
"o. That the accused is really the father of the child, alone and by
itself, is not sufficient to prove the offense charged. (People v. Benlot,
et al., 16 CA. Rep. 539)

Note: None of the three acts of concubinage is thereby proved.
1139

Ait. 334

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Adultery Is more severely punished than concubinage.

Reason: Because adultery makes possible the introduction of
another man’s blood into the family so that the offended husband may
have another man’s son bearing his (husband’s) name and receiving
support from him.

Lewd, defined.

“Lewd” is defined as obscene, lustful, indecent, lecherous. It
signifies the form of immorality which has relation to moral impurity;
or that which is carried on a wanton manner. (People v. Lizada, G.R.
Nos. 143468-71, January 24, 2003, citing People v. Tayag, 329 SCRA
491 [2000])
Compelling a girl to dance naked before a group of men is an act
of lasciviousness, even if the dominant motive is revenge, for her
failure to pay a debt

For her failure to pay her debt, the girl, after beating her with
a stick, was compelled by the defendant to take of all her clothes and
dance before him and many other persons. It was held that there
was a crime of acts of lasciviousness, even if the dominating motive of
defendant’s conduct was to take revenge upon the girl for her failure
to pay her debt, for it cannot be believed that there was no admixture
of lasciviousness in the thought and purpose of the defendant who
could devise such method. (U.S. v. Bailoses, 2 Phil. 49)

Distinguished from grave coercion.
But where a woman, 60 years old, was taken from her house
against her will, slapped and maltreated, her drawers taken off and
her hands and feet bound by the accused to compel her to admit that
she stole the shoes of a certain person, the crime was grave coercion.
(People v. Fernando, et al., 8A.C. Rep. 219)
In this Bailoses case, the compulsion by beating the girl is
deluded in the constructive element of force in the crime of acts of

lasciviousness. In the Fernando case, the compulsion is the very act
constituting the offense of grave coercion (compelling the offended
party to admit the theft).

accused cannot be considered lascivious. He performed the said acts
either to spite the girl or to force her to accept him as a lover.” (People
v. Anonuevo, CA., 36 O.G. 2018)
In another case, the accused, in the store of the offended girl,
kissed her in public view and touched her breasts. It was held that the
crime committed was unjust vexation as there were no lewd designs.
It appeared that the accused had been wooing the girl, but she jilted
him. (People v. Arpon, 8 A.C. Rep., 345)
The presence or absence of lewd designs is inferred from the
nature of the acts themselves and the environmental circumstances.
In the instant case, in view of the manner, place, and time under
which the acts complained of were done, lewd designs can hardly be
attributed to the accused. The factual setting, i.e., a schoolroom in the
presence of complainant’s students and within hearing distance of her
co-teachers, rules out a conclusion that the accused was actuated by
a lustful design or purpose or that his conduct was lewd or lascivious.
It may be that he did embrace the girl and kiss her but this of itself
would not necessarily bring the case within the provision of Article
336 of the R.P.C. (People v. Balbar, 21 SCRA 1119)

Art. 336

Motive of lascivious acts is not important because the essence of
lewdness is in the very act itself.
The act of taking the offended party by the waist, of holding
her to his breast and hugging her with intention of kissing her and
touching her breast and private parts, which appellant did by force
and against her will, are by themselves an abuse directed against
her chastity. It is not a defense that appellant was motivated not by
lewdness but by a desire to avenge the fact that her father committed
a criminal attack on appellant’s wife during the Japanese occupation.
(People v. Famularcano, CA., 43 O.G. 1721)
Embracing, kissing and holding girl’s breast is act of lasciviousness.

Taking advantage of the fact that Paula Bautista, a young
married woman, was alone in her house with no companion but her
three-year-old child who was then asleep, the accused, between 3
and 4 o’clock in the afternoon, went to the house of said woman on
the pretext of asking for a glass of water, stealthily approached her
and, without giving her an opportunity to defend herself, embraced,
and kissed her and caught hold of her breasts. When Paula recovered
from the shock, she defended herself as best as she could and in spite
of the fact that the accused threatened to kill her with a dagger if she
did not accede to his desire, she bit him on the right side of the chest
thereby forcing him to release her instantly.

Held: The foregoing proven facts constitute the crime of acts of
lasciviousness. (People v. Collado, 60 Phil. 610)
In some cases, touching the breast of a woman is considered unjust
vexation only.

In a case where the accused, inside a Catholic church and after
the service had begun, approached a girl from behind and forcibly
embraced and kissed her on the left cheek and at the same time
fondled her breast, it was held that the accused was guilty only of
unjust vexation. The Court of Appeals said, “considering the religious
atmosphere and the presence of many persons, the conduct of the
1144

Art. 336

But the rule is different when the act is committed in a theater.

When a man embraces and kisses a woman three times and
intentionally fondles her breast at the same time in a theater
where the lights were out and the people’s attention was naturally
concentrated on the picture, he must be considered as having done
so with a feeling of lasciviousness, a mental process of emotion that
differs in intensity in different situations and different persons. Being
a purely mental process discernible only by overt acts, no inflexible
rule can be laid down as an accurate measure. This is the reason
why at times, it may be extremely difficult to have a clear distinction
between the conduct of a lascivious person and the amorous advances
of an ardent lover. (U.S. v. Gomez, 30 Phil. 22) It is true that in some
cases the Supreme Court held that the crime committed was only
uiyust vexation. In those case, however, the accused merely kissed
and embraced complainant, either out of passion or other motive,
the touching of the breasts being purely incidental. (People v. Biag,
CA., 65 O.G. 1596, February 17, 1969, citing People v. Arpon, 45 O.G.

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimes Against Chastity

Kissing and embracing a woman against her will are acts of
lasciviousness when prompted by lust or lewd designs.
Considering that the embracing and kissing of the girl took place
in a taxicab while passing along a public thoroughfare and at about
noontime, it is difficult to believe that the appellant could have desired
more than the ordinary outburst of one in love. While the appellant
might have taken liberties with the person of the offended party
against her strong resistance, it did not appear that the appellant
was prompted by lust or lewd designs. (People v. Buenafe, 99 Phil.
306)

The act of lasciviousness must be committed under any of the
circumstances mentioned in the definition of the crime of rape.
The circumstances are: (1) by using force or intimidation;
(2) when the offended party is deprived of reason or otherwise
unconscious; (3) by means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse
of authority; or (4) when the offended party is under 12 years old or
is demented.

Art. 336

But where the accused took advantage of the situation when the
offended woman was alone with her children in her house at night
and put out the light of the lamp, he was moved by lasciviousness
when he kissed and embraced her. (People v. Mendoza, CA.-G.R. No.
14882-R, March 19, 1956)

Art. 336

Moral compulsion amounting to intimidation is sufficient.
In cases of acts of lasciviousness, it is not necessary that the
intimidation or physical force be irresistible, it being sufficient that

some violence or moral compulsion, equivalent to intimidation, annuls
or subdues the free exercise of the will of the offended party (Cuello
Calon, Derecho Penal, Tomo II, pagina 565, edition 1955). (El Pueblo
de Filipinos v. Pugay, CA., 60 O.G. 211)

Lover’s embraces and kisses are not acts of lasciviousness.

Abuses against chastity distinguished from offenses against

Although there are indications that while the girl did not want
the accused as her accepted lover, she was not unwilling to receive
attentions from him.
She testified that the accused forcibly embraced her and kissed
her a number of times and took other unwarranted liberties with her
person. However, the court believed that the accused only embraced
and kissed her.

chastity.

Held: What constitutes lewd or lascivious conduct must be
determined from the circumstances of each case. A lover’s embrace
and kisses are not lascivious, there being no evidence that the lover
was actuated by a lustful design or purpose, or that his conduct was
lewd or lascivious. (U.S. v. Gomez, 30 Phil. 22)
Placing a man's private parts over a girl’s genital organ is an act
of lasciviousness.

Thus, a man who threw a seven to 10 year old girl upon the
floor, placed his private parts upon or over hers, and remained in
that position or made motions of sexual intercourse, is guilty of acts
of lasciviousness under Article 336. (U.S. v. Tan Teng, 23 Phil. 145;
People v. Domondon, CA., 34 O.G. 1977)

1146

Abuses against chastity (Art. 246) is committed by a public
officer, and that a mere immoral or indecent proposal made earnestly
and persistently is sufficient; whereas, in crimes against chastity (Art.
336), the offender is, in the majority of cases, a private individual,
and it is necessary that some actual act of lasciviousness should have
been executed by the offender.

Distinguished from attempted rape.

The manner of committing the crime is the same, that is, force
or intimidation is employed, by means of fraudulent machination or
grave abuse of authority, or the offended party is deprived of reason
or otherwise unconscious, under 12 years of age or is demented.
The offended party in both crimes is a person of either sex.

The performance of acts of lascivious character is common to

both crimes.

The differences are:
(a)

If the acts performed by the offender clearly indicate
that his purpose was to lie with the offended woman, it is
attempted or frustrated rape.
1147

Art 336

(b)

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimes Against Chastity

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

In the case of attempted rape, the lascivious acts are but
the preparatory acts to the commission of rape; whereas,
in the other, the lascivious acts are themselves the final
objective sought by the offender.

In People v. Collado, G.R. Nos. 135667-70, 353 SCRA 381, 392,
the Supreme Court held that the difference between attempted rape
and acts of lasciviousness lies in the intent of the perpetrator as
deduced from his external acts. The intent referred to is the intent
to lie with a woman. Attempted rape is committed when the touching
of the vagina by the penis is coupled with the intent to penetrate;
otherwise, there can only be acts of lasciviousness. Inasmuch as
the touching of the victim’s organ by the penis of accused was but a
mere incident of the “nibbing against or between the victim’s thighs”
which in no way manifests an act preliminary to sexual intercourse,
accused-appellant should only be convicted of acts of lasciviousness.
Criminal liability for acts of lasciviousness in relation to of Section
5(b), R.A. No. 7610.
Before an accused can be held criminally liable for lascivious
conduct under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610, the requisites of the
crime of Acts of Lasciviousness as penalized under Article 336 of the
R.P.C. must be met in addition to the following requisites for sexual
abuse under Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610: (1) the accused commits
the act of sexual intercourse or lascivious conduct; (2) the said act is
performed with a child exploited in prostitution or subjected to other
sexual abuse; and (3) that the child, whether male or female, is below
18 years of age.

—

The mere fact of “squeezing” the private part of a child a young
girl 12 years of age
could not have signified any other intention
but one having lewd or indecent design. It must not be forgotten that
several years prior, accused-appellant had raped AAA in the same
house, for which act he was appropriately convicted. Indeed, the law
indicates that the mere touching more so, “squeezing,” in this case,
which strongly suggests that the act was intentional
of AAA’s
genitalia clearly constitutes lascivious conduct. It could not have been
done merely to annoy or vex her. That AAA was fully clothed at that
time, which led the courts a quo to believe that accused-appellant
could not have intended to lie with her, is inconsequential. “’Lewd’ is
defined as obscene, lustful, indecent, and lecherous. It signifies that

—

1148

—

Art. 336

form of immorality which has relation to moral impurity; or that
which is carried on a wanton manner.” As such, accused-appellant’s
act of squeezing AAA s vagina was a lewd and lascivious act within
the definitions set by law and jurisprudence. Accused is guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of Acts of Lasciviousness under Article
336 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended, in relation to Section 5(b)
of R.A. No. 7610. (People v. Ladra, G.R. No. 221443, July 17, 2017)

Circumstances indicating intention to lie with the offended party.
The acts of the accused, which consisted of slipping his trousers
down and tearing the drawers of the girl, as well as kissing her
and fondling her breasts, abundantly show an intention to have

intercourse with her by force. (People v. Calupis, G.R. No. 40506,

December 10, 1934)

The accused lifted the dress of the woman and placed himself on
top of her. The woman awoke and screamed for help. But the accused
persisted in his purpose, thereby indicating his intention to ravish
her through force and intimidation. (People v. Tayaba, 62 Phil. 559)
Desistance in the commission of attempted rape may constitute
acts of lasciviousness.

If while committing an act amounting to attempted rape,
the offender desisted, such desistance does not imply the absolute
irresponsibility of the offender with respect to acts already committed.
If acts of lasciviousness were already committed, they are within
the nature of the consummated crime of acts of lasciviousness, since
actual damage was already done to a lawful right. (U.S. v. Basilio, 9

Phil. 16)

No attempted or frustrated crime of acts of lasciviousness.

In cases of acts of lasciviousness, from the moment the offender

performs all the elements necessary for the existence of the felony, he

actually attains his purpose and, from that moment, all the essential

elements of the offense have been accomplished. From the standpoint of

the law, there can be no frustration of acts of lasciviousness, because

do matter how far the offender may have gone towards the realization

of his purpose, if his participation amounts to performing all the acts

thereof. (People u. Falmularcano, CA., 43 O.G. 1721)

There is no attempted crime of acts of lasciviousness. (2 Cuello
Calon 54)
Acts of lasciviousness distinguished from unjust vexation.

When the accused merely kissed and embraced the complainant,
either out of passion or other motive, touching the girl’s breast as a
mere incident of the embrace, it is uiyust vexation.
Accused’s acts of kissing the victim, fondling her breasts, and
touching her private parts constitute lascivious conduct intended to
quench his salacious desire. Accused’s lewd intent was betrayed when
he asked AAA, Dalaga ka na ba? as a prelude to his lustful advances
on the victim, and thereafter conveyed to her that I am single too.
He is guilty of acts of lasciviousness. (Sombilon v. People, G.R. No.
175528, September 30, 2009)

Where the accused touched three times the private parts of the
offended woman over her panties, without employing any force or
intimidation, he is guilty of unjust vexation, because it might have
been committed merely to satisfy a “silly whim.” (People v. Bernaldo,
CA.-G.R. No. 26102-R, October 31, 1959)

But the act of the accused in forcibly placing his hand between
the legs of a girl over 12 years old, or without force if she be under that
age, constitutes the crime of acts of lasciviousness. (U.S. v. Basilio, 9
Phil. 16)

subjected to other sexual abuse.

Section 5(b) of R.A. No. 7610 covers acts of lasciviousness. It
provides:

with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or

Chapter Three
SEDUCTION, CORRUPTION OF MINORS,

Two classes of qualified seduction:
(a) Seduction of a virgin over 12 years and under 18 years of age
by certain persons, such as, a person in authority, priest,
teacher, etc.; and
(b)

AND WHITE SLAVE TRADE
Meaning of seduction.

Seduction means enticing a woman to unlawful sexual
intercourse by promise of marriage or other means of persuasion
without use of force. (Webster’s New International Dictionary)
Two kinds of seduction:
1.

Qualified seduction. (Art. 337)

2.

Simple seduction. (Art. 338)

Art. 337

Seduction of a sister by her brother, or descendant by her
ascendant, regardless of her age or reputation.

Elements of qualified seduction of a virgin:
1. That the offended party is a virgin, which is presumed if she
is unmarried and of good reputation.
2. That she must be over 12 and under 18 years of age.
3.

That the offender has sexual intercourse with her.

4.

That there is abuse of authority, confidence or relationship
on the part of the offender.

The offended party must be a virgin, over 12 and under 18 years
of age.

virgin over twelve years and under eighteen years of age,
committed by any person in public authority, priest, house
servant, domestic, guardian, teacher, or any person who,
in any capacity, shall be entrusted with the education or
custody of the woman seduced, shall be punished by prision
correctional in its minimum and medium periods.1
The penalty next higher in degree2 shall be imposed
upon any person who shall seduce his sister or descendant,
whether or not she be a virgin or over eighteen years of age.

Under the provisions of this Chapter seduction is
committed when the offender has carnal knowledge of any of
the persons and under the circumstances described herein.

She must be a virgin and over 12 but under 18 years of age.
Virginity is presumed if the woman is unmarried and of good
reputation. It is the accused who must prove otherwise and the proof
must be convincing, not just insinuations or conjectures. (People v.
Ramos, CA., 72 O.G. 8139)
If the woman is married and the offender knows it, having sexual

intercourse with her is adultery.

If the victim is less than 12 years of age, the crime is rape. If the
victim is over 18 years of age, qualified seduction is not committed.
There is no crime at all, if there is no force or intimidation or the
woman is not unconscious or otherwise deprived of reason.

Offended party need not be physically virgin.

Meaning of virginity.
The crime of qualified seduction requires that the victim must
be a virgin. The crime of consented abduction (Art. 343) also requires
that the offended party must be a virgin. The meaning of virginity,
therefore, must be the same for both crimes.
1164

1156

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimes Against Chastity

The virginity to which the Penal Code refers is not to be
understood in so material a sense as to exclude the idea of abduction
of a virtuous woman of good reputation.

What makes the crime of qualified seduction?
The acts would not be punished were it not for the character
of the person committing the same, on account of the excess of power
or abuse of confidence of which the offender availed himself. (U.S. v.

Art. 337

The Casten case distinguished from the Suan case.

In the case of U.S. v. Casten, 34 Phil. 808, the defendant claims
that he had prior intercourse with the girl. The Supreme Court
considered her still a “virgin” within the meaning of the law. In the
case of U.S. v. Suan, 27 Phil. 12, it was established that the girl had
carnal relations with other men. Her chaste character was then open
to question. In law, she is no longer a virgin. The accused regard her
more or less a public woman.
There must be sexual intercourse in qualified seduction.

If there is no sexual intercourse and only acts of lewdness are
performed, the crime is act of lasciviousness under Article 339.
Who could be the offenders in qualified seduction?

1.

2.

3.

Those who abused their authority:

Art. 337

Arlante, 9 Phil. 595)

Deceit is not an element of qualified seduction.
It is settled that deceit, although an essential element of simple
seduction, does not need to be proved in a charge of qualified seduction.
It is replaced by abuse of confidence. The seduction of a virgin over
12 and under 18 years of age, committed by any of the persons
enumerated in Article 337 “is constitutive of the crime of qualified
seduction x x x even though no deceit intervenes or even when such
carnal knowledge were voluntary on the part of the virgin, because
in such a case, the law takes for granted the existence of the deceit
as an integral element of the said crime and punishes it with greater
severity than it does the simple seduction x x x taking into account
the abuse of confidence on the part of the agent (culprit), an abuse
of confidence which implies deceit.” (People v. Fontanilla, 23 SCRA
1227)

The fact that the girl gave consent to the sexual intercourse is no
defense.

a.

Person in public authority.

b.

Guardian.

c.

Teacher.

Lack of consent on the part of the girl to the sexual intercourse
is not an element of the offense.

d.

Person who, in any capacity, is entrusted with the education
or custody of the woman seduced.

It is sufficient that the offender is a teacher in the same school.

Those who abused confidence reposed in them:

a.

Priest.

b.

House servant.

c.

Domestic.

Those who abused their relationship:

Even if the accused is not the teacher of the offended party, it is
sufficient if the accused is a teacher in the same school, because of his
moral influence as member of the faculty over the student. (Santos
v. People, 40 O.G., Supp. 6, 23)
A teacher in a public school who was in charge of the education
and instruction of a girl had sexual intercourse with her. He was
convicted of qualified seduction. (People v. Cariaso, 50 Phil. 884)

a.

seduction, covered by the phrase “any person who, in any capacity,
shall be entrusted with x x x the custody of the woman seduced.”
Qualified seduction by head of the family.

A person who had sexual intercourse with the cousin of his wife,
with them in the house and a virgin under 18 years old
living
then
but over 12 years, is guilty of qualified seduction.

He took advantage of his authority and abused the confidence
and trust reposed in him as head of family and master of the house.
(People v. Lauchengco, C.A., 45 O.G. 3485)
Qualified seduction by a brother-in-law.

If the moral ascendancy of a brother-in-law, instead, were used
for immoral purposes, then, certainly, there is more than ample
justification for adherence to the view first announced in the landmark
Arlante decision that thereby the offense of qualified seduction was
in fact committed. (People v. Alvarez, 55 SCRA 81)
Qualified seduction committed by a priest

When the girl went to the church to confess, the priest, upon
meeting her, embraced and kissed her. The priest made her lie on a

board on the floor and had sexual intercourse with her.

Held.: The priest was guilty of qualified seduction. (U.S. v.
Santiago, 41 Phil. 793)
Qualified seduction by house servant

A servant in the house who had sexual intercourse with the
master’s daughter, a virgin over 12 but less than 18 years of age, is
guilty of qualified seduction.
Meaning of “domestic.”

“Domestic” is a person usually living under the same roof,
pertaining to the same house.
1158

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimes Against Chastity

Art. 337

Example: A man, a distant relation of the family, secured board

and lodging in the house of the aunt of a girl of about 14 years old who
was also living there. The man, the girl and the aunt and her husband

all lived in the same house as one family. The man is considered a
domestic. (U.S. v. Santiago, 26 Phil. 184)

The term “domestic” includes all those persons residing with
the family and who are members of the same household, regardless
of the fact that their residence may only be temporary or that they
may be paying for their board and lodging.
Where the defendant seduced a servant girl working in his
brother’s home, it appearing that the defendant was residing with
his said brother, it was held that the case should be considered as
coming within the term “domestic” as used in Article 337. (See case
cited in U.S. v. Santiago, 26 Phil. 184)

But if a man is merely stopping at a public inn or tavern when he
seduced the landlord’s daughter, the man is not a domestic. (December
Supreme Court Spain, January 30, 1891, cited in the case of U.S. v.
Santiago, 26 Phil. 184)
The reason for this decision is that such a man is not tendered or
expected to receive those sentimental and confidential manifestations
of intimacy exchanged between members of the same household.

Domestic is distinct from house servant
“La voz domestico se refiere a las personas que habitualmente

viven bajo el mismo techo, pertenecen a una misma casa y forman

en este concepto parte de ella” (2 Cuello Calon, Codigo Penal, 1967
12th Ed. 560). Domestic is distinct from house servant. (Sentencia
de 11 de Noviembre de 1881; 3 Viada, Codigo Penal 136; 2 Hidalgo,
Codigo Penal 319) Because of the intimacy and confidence existing
among various members of a household, opportunities for committing
seduction are more frequent. (People v. Samillano, 56 SCAD 573)

Distinguished from rape.
If any of the circumstances in the crime of rape is present, the
crime is not to be punished under this article.

Qualified seduction by seducing a sister or descendant

The penalty is next higher in degree.
The seduction of a sister or descendant is known as incest.
Virginity of the sister or descendant is not required and she may
be over 18 years of age. Relationship must be by consanguinity. The
relationship need not be legitimate.

Elements:
1,

That the offended party is over 12 and under 18 years of age.

2.

That she must be of good reputation, single or widow.

3.

That the offender has sexual intercourse with her.
That it is committed by means of deceit.

If the sister or descendant is under 12 years of age, the crime
would be rape. If she is married and over 12 years of age, it would be

4.

adultery.

Example of simple seduction.

The accused charged with rape cannot be convicted of qualified
seduction under the same information.

The accused went to the house of his fianc£, her parents then
being absent, and availing himself of that opportunity, with a renewal
of his promise to make her his wife, he succeeded in having sexual
intercourse with her.

In two recent decisions, People v. Alvarez and People v.
Samillano, while the appellants were acquitted, the commission of the
crime of rape not having been shown, th[e] Court found them guilty of
qualified seduction. Such a result, regrettably, is not warranted here.
The information was quite definite that the accused, “armed with a
deadly weapon, a firearm, and by means of violence and intimidation,
did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie with and
have carnal knowledge of a 15-year-old girl, one Felicisima Briones
Mendoza.” (People v. Ramirez, 69 SCRA 144)
When victim is under 12 years of age.

The penalty provided in Section 10 of R.A. No. 7610 for seduction
when the victim is under 12 years of age, i.e., one degree higher than
that imposed by law, appears to be erroneous considering that a person
who engages in sexual intercourse with a woman below 12 years of
age commits rape, and not seduction.

Held: The accused is guilty of simple seduction. Deceit, the
usual form of which being an unfulfilled promise of marriage, is an
important element of the offense. (People v. Iman, 62 Phil. 92)

The offended girl must be over 12 and under 18 years of age.

If she is under 12 years old, the crime is rape, even if the offender
succeeds in having sexual intercourse with her by means of deceit.
If she is over 18 years of age, there is no force or intimidation
or she is not unconscious or otherwise deprived of reason, there is
no crime even if the accused has sexual intercourse with her. This is
true even if deceit is employed by the accused.

Virginity of offended party is not required.
Article 338 uses the phrase “a woman who is single or a widow

°f good reputation," apparently means that it is the widow who must
be of good reputation. But Albert says that the offended party must
be in good repute, because if she was a public woman or one of loose
morals, the act would not be penalized by the Code.

Art. 338

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

It is not essential in simple seduction that the woman seduced
be a virgin, as all that is necessary is that she is of good reputation.
(2 Cuello Calon, Codigo Penal, 10th Ed., pp. 580-581)
A woman who was raped before may be the victim of simple
seduction, provided she is a woman of good reputation.

But a woman, who had illicit relations with a number of
men prior to accused’s sexual intercourse with her, is not of good
reputation. (U.S. v. Suan, 27 Phil. 12)
There must be sexual intercourse.

If there is no sexual intercourse and only acts of lewdness are
performed, the crime is acts of lasciviousness under Article 339.
Deceit generally takes the form of unfulfilled promise of marriage.

Deceit generally takes the form of unfulfilled promise of marriage
and this promise need not immediately precede the carnal act. (People
v. Iman, 62 Phil. 92)

Promise of marriage must be the inducement and the woman
must yield because of the promise or other inducement. If she consents
merely from carnal lust, and the intercourse is from mutual desire,
there is no seduction. (U.S. v. Sarmiento, 27 Phil. 121)
Deceit is also illustrated in the case of U.S. v. Hernandez, 29
Phil. 109, where the accused endeavored to seduce the girl and failing
in the attempt, he procured the performance of a fictitious marriage
ceremony and thereafter had sexual intercourse with her.
May the man who is willing and ready to marry the girl seduced by
him be held liable for simple seduction?

It is believed that he is liable, because his willingness to marry
her may still amount to deceit, not by itself but by the attending
circumstances vitiating such willingness, as when the man knows
that the girl cannot legally consent to the marriage, and yet he makes
a promise to marry her. The consent of the parents cannot be taken
for granted, as in majority of cases, the parents would not consent to
the marriage of their young daughter.
1162

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimes Against Chastity

Art. 338

Deceit consisting in unfulfilled promise of material things.
If a woman under 18 years old, but over 12, agrees to a sexual
intercourse with a man who promised to give her precious jewelry,
and the man never fulfills it, there is no seduction, because she proves
to be a woman of loose morals. She is a high-class prostitute.

Promise of marriage by a married man is not a deceit.
Thus, a promise of marriage made by a married man, whom the
woman knew to be married when she surrendered herself, could not
have induced her to do so; and in such a case, it is clear that there
was no reliance on the promise. (U.S. v. Sarmiento, 27 Phil. 121)
Promise of marriage after sexual intercourse does not constitute
deceit.

A promise of marriage made after the sexual intercourse had
taken place, or after the woman had yielded her body to the man’s
illicit embraces, cannot be held to have induced the woman to
surrender her virtue. (U.S. v. Sarmiento, 27 Phil. 121)
No continuing offense of seduction.

The loss of virginity during the minority of the offended party
consummated the offense, and the virginity of a woman cannot be lost
twice. Hence, the carnal relations had after the complainant was over
18 years does not constitute a continuation of the offense begun when
she was under 18 years of age. (People u. Bautista, 12 O.G. 2405)
Purpose of the law In punishing simple seduction.

The purpose of the statute making seduction a crime is not to
punish illicit intercourse, but to punish the seducer who by means of
a promise of marriage, destroys the chastity of an unmarried female
of previous chaste character, and who thus draws her aside from the
path of virtue and rectitude and then fails and refuses to fulfill his

promise, a character despicable in the eyes of every decent, honorable

man. (People v. Iman, 62 Phil. 92)

Art. 339. Acts of lasciviousness with the consent of the
offended party.
The penalty of arresto mayor4 shall be
imposed to punish any other acts of lasciviousness committed
by the same persons and under the same circumstances as
those provided in Articles 337 and 338.

No. In order that the crime of acts of lasciviousness with the
consent of the offended party may be committed, it is necessary that
the crime is committed under circumstances which would make it
qualified or simple seduction had there been sexual intercourse,
instead of acts of lewdness only.

Art. 339

—

Art. 339

In the problem given, B did not accomplish the act by abuse of
authority, confidence or relationship. B did not commit the act by

means of deceit.

Elements:

1.

That the offender commits acts of lasciviousness or lewdness.

“With the consent of the offended party.”

2.

That the acts are committed upon a woman who is virgin or
single or widow of good reputation, under 18 years of age
but over 12 years, or a sister or descendant regardless of her
reputation or age.

This phrase is used in the title of Article 339. The offended
woman may have consented to the acts of lasciviousness being
performed by the offender on her person, but the consent is obtained
by abuse of authority, confidence or relationship or by means of deceit.

3.

That the offender accomplishes the acts by abuse of authority,
confidence, relationship, or deceit.

Article 336 and Article 339, compared.

Male cannot be the offended party in this crime.

Can a male be an offended party in this kind of acts of
lasciviousness?

Note that Article 339, unlike Article 336, does not mention
“persons of either sex” as the offended party.
“Committed by the same persons and under the same circumstances
as those provided in Articles 337 and 338.”

A, a girl 16 years of age, and B were lovers. While they were
in the theater, B kissed A, touched her breast, including her private
parts with the consent of A. Was B guilty of acts of lasciviousness
with the consent of the offended party?

Both Article 336 and Article 339 treat of acts of lasciviousness.
Under Article 336, the acts are committed under circumstances
which, had there been carnal knowledge, would amount to rape.

Under Article 339, the acts of lasciviousness are committed
under the circumstances which, had there been carnal knowledge,
would amount to either qualified seduction or simple seduction. There
may be consent, but there is either abuse of authority, confidence, or
relationship, or deceit.
Penalty when victim is under 12 years of age.

The penalty for acts of lasciviousness with the consent of the
offended party shall be one degree higher than that imposed by law
when the victim is under 12 years of age. (Sec. 10, R.A No. 7610)

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimes Against Chastity

Art. 340

Age of victim.

The term “persons under age" provided in Article 340 of the
R.P.C. means a person below 18 years of age. Under Article 234 of
the Family Code, the age of majority is 18 years.

Reputation of the victim.
She or he must be of good reputation, not a prostitute or
corrupted person. (Guevara)

Habituallty or abuse of authority or confidence, not necessary.

Penalty when victim Is under 12 years of age.

Before Article 340 was amended by B.P. Big. 92, the essential
requisite of the offense is that there must be habituality or abuse of
authority or confidence in promoting or facilitating the prostitution
or corruption of a minor.
As the amended Article 340 is worded, it is not now a requisite
of the crime of corruption of minors.

The penalty for corruption of minors shall be one degree higher
than that imposed by law when the victim is under 12 years of age.
(Sec. 10, R.A. No. 7610)

"To satisfy the lust of another."

Note the phrase “to satisfy the lust of another.” Therefore, one
who casts for his own ends does not incur the sanction of the law.
Single act without abuse of authority or confidence is now a crime.

The ruling in U.S. v. Javier, et al., 20 Phil. 337, that a single act
of facilitating the corruption of a minor by placing her at another’s
disposal for immoral purposes does not legally constitute the crime
under Article 340, is no longer authoritative.
It is not necessary that the unchaste acts shall have been done.

What the law punishes is the act of a pimp who facilitates the
corruption of, and not the performance of unchaste acts upon, the
minor.
A mere proposal will consummate the offense. Thus, a father,
who proposes to his daughter that she accompany a man to satisfy
the lust of the latter, commits a consummated corruption of minors.

3.

The child is exploited or intended to be exploited in
prostitution; and

4.

The child, whether male or female, is below 18 years of age.

Paragraph (a) essentially punishes acts pertaining to or
connected with child prostitution. It contemplates sexual abuse of a
child exploited in prostitution. In other words, under paragraph (a),
the child is abused primarily for profit. (Malto v. People , 533 SCRA
643(2007])
Inducing child prostitution.

The act of appellant in convincing AAA, who was 12 years old
at that time, to go with her and thereafter, offer her for sex to a man
in exchange for money makes her liable under Section 5(a) of R.A.
No. 7610. The purpose of the law is to provide special protection to
children from all forms of abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation and
discrimination, and other conditions prejudicial to their development.
A child exploited in prostitution may seem to “consent” to what is
being done to her or him and may appear not to complain. However,
we have held that a child who is “a person below eighteen years of age
or those unable to fully take care of themselves or protect themselves
from abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation or discrimination because
of their age or mental disability or condition” is incapable of giving
rational consent to any lascivious act or sexual intercourse. (People

Consent is immaterial.

Accused claims that AAA admitted engaging in prostitution
even before May 2, 2008. She concludes that AAA was predisposed to
having sex with “customers” for money. For Liability under our law,
this argument is irrelevant. As defined under Section 3(a) of R.A. No.
9208, trafficking in persons can still be committed even if the victim
gives consent.
The victim’s consent is rendered meaningless due to the coercive,

videoke bar, i.e., Otoy’s, and left her there; and (c) since then and for
the next eight months, Polvoriza forced AAA to work as a prostitute
in Otoy’s, coercing her to perform lewd acts on a nightly basis, such as
dancing naked in front of male customers and even having sex with
them. The courts a quo correctly found untenable Mora and Polvoriza’s
insistence that it was AAA who voluntarily presented herself to work
as an ‘entertainer/sex worker’ in Otoy’s, as trafficking in persons can
still be committed even if the victim gives consent most especially
in cases where the victim is a minor. In this regard, case law
instructs that “[t]he victim’s consent is rendered meaningless due to
the coercive, abusive, or deceptive means employed by perpetrators
of human trafficking. Even without the use of coercive, abusive, or
deceptive means, a minor’s consent is not given out of his or her own
free will." (People v. Mora, G.R. No. 242682, July 1, 2019)

Qualified trafficking, when committed by a syndicate.

Trafficking is deemed committed by a syndicate if carried out
by a group of three or more persons conspiring or confederating with
one another. (Sec. 6[c], R.A. No. 9208)

When the offender is a member of the military or law
enforcement agencies;
(g) When by reason or on occasion of the act of trafficking in
persons, the offended party dies, becomes insane, suffers
mutilation or is afflicted with Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV) or the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS);
(h) When the offender commits one or more violations of Section
4 over a period of 60 or more days, whether those days are
continuous or not; and
(i) When the offender directs or through another manages the
trafficking victim in carrying out the exploitative purpose of
trafficking. (Sec. 6)

Trafficking in Persons under Sections 3(a) and 4 of R.A. No.
9208 is not only limited to transportation of victims, but also includes
the act of recruitment of victims for trafficking. In this case, since it
has been sufficiently proven that all the three accused conspired and
confederated with one another to illegally recruit Lolita to become
a prostitute in Malaysia, it follows that they are also guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of Qualified Trafficking in Persons
committed by a syndicate under R.A. No. 9208 because the crime of
recruitment for prostitution also constitutes trafficking. (People v.
Hodja Jarma Lalli, GJi. No. 195419, October 12, 2011)

Illustration of damages awarded for trafficking in persons.
The criminal case of Trafficking in Persons as a Prostitute is an
analogous case to the crimes of seduction, abduction, rape, or other
lascivious acts. In fact, it is worse. To be trafficked as a prostitute
without one’s consent and to be sexually violated four to five times a
day by different strangers is horrendous and atrocious. There is no
doubt that the victim experienced physical suffering, mental anguish,
fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings,
moral shock, and social humiliation when she was trafficked as a
prostitute in Malaysia. Since the crime of Trafficking in Persons
was aggravated, being committed by a syndicate, the award of
exemplary damages is likewise justified. Accused are sentenced to life
imprisonment and ordered to pay a fine of Pl,000,000.00 each and
to pay the victims the sum of P500,000.00 each as moral damages
and P100,000.00 each as exemplary damages and to pay the costs.

Woman abducted may be married.

Chapter Four

ABDUCTION

Article 342 mentions “any woman” as the victim of the crime
of forcible abduction. Hence, the forcible taking away of a married
woman, the offender having lewd designs, is penalized under Article
342. As in rape, the civil status, the age, and the reputation of the
woman are immaterial.
The virginity of the offended woman is not an essential element
of the crime of forcible abduction. (People v. Torres, et al., 62 Phil.

Meaning of abduction.

“By abduction is meant the taking away of a woman from her
house or the place where she may be for the purpose of carrying her
to another place with intent to marry or to corrupt her.” (Viada, cited
in People v. Crisostomo, 46 Phil. 780)
Two kinds of abduction.

1.

Forcible abduction. (Art. 342)

2.

Consented abduction. (Art. 343)

—

Art. 342. Forcible abduction.
The abduction of any
woman against her will and with lewd designs shall be
punished by reclusion temporal.'

The same penalty shall be imposed in every case, if the
female abducted be under twelve years of age.

Elements of forcible abduction:
1.

That the person abducted is any woman, regardless of her
age, civil status, or reputation.

2.

That the abduction is against her will.

3.

That the abduction is with lewd designs.

942)

Crimes against chastity where age and reputation of victim are

immaterial.
1. Rape;
2.

Acts of lasciviousness against the will or without the consent
of the offended party;

3.

Qualified seduction of sister or descendant;

4.

Forcible abduction.

The taking away of the woman must be against her will.
The taking away of the woman is against her will, when force
or intimidation is used by the offender.

Thus, where the two accused, Castillo and Lugod, forcibly
dragged and carried a girl from the store she was tending and took
her to a waiting carretela while she resisted and cried for help and,
once inside the vehicle, ordered the driver to speed away, and in the
carretela, Castillo forcibly embraced and handled her against her will,
the taking away of the girl with lewd designs was against her will.
(People v. Castillo, et al., 76 Phil. 839)

The taking away of the woman may be accomplished by means of
deceit first and then by means of violence and intimidation.

Thus, when defendant, who had served as an intermediary

between the lovers, told the woman that her lover was awaiting her

at a spot near a growth of sugarcane for the purpose of joining her
and eloping with her, which was not true, and upon arriving at the
1182

1183

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimes Against Chastity

place referred to, defendant caught her by the hand, gave her a slap,
and dragged her into the midst of the sugar cane growing nearby,
where, threatening her with a dagger he had in hand, he overcame her
resistance and succeeded in lying with her, it was held that defendant
was guilty of forcible abduction.

Lewd designs may be shown by the conduct of the accused.
While inside the car, the accused kissed and embraced the
offended party and often attempted to take hold of her body, and
knowing that the offended party was to be married to another of her
own choice, the accused went on the witness stand and blackened
her character and sought to ruin her reputation for chastity. These
circumstances constitute a strong evidence that he is a man of lewd
and lascivious mind. (People v. Bustos, et al., 54 Phil. 887; U.S. v.
Ramirez, 39 Phil. 745)

Art. 342

The Supreme Court said: “It is unquestionable that the offended
woman who had freely gone to the place where she believed she would
find her fianc6, lost her liberty from the moment defendant opposed
her returning home, and that consequently, it was against her will
that she was taken by defendant into the sugarcane. This was the
commencement of the abduction of the young woman, committed by
defendant with violence and against her will.” (U.S. v. De Vivar, 29
Phil. 451)
Note: Defendant should have been prosecuted and punished for
the complex crime of forcible abduction with rape.
If the female abducted is under 12 years of age, the crime is forcible
abduction, even if she voluntarily goes with her abductor.

In case the female abducted be under 12 years of age, it is not
necessary that she be taken against her will.
The law says: “The same penalty shall be imposed in every case,
if the female abducted be under 12 years of age.” The reason for this
provision is that she has no will of her own and, therefore, is incapable
of giving consent.
Sexual intercourse is not necessary in forcible abduction.
Actual illicit relations with the female abducted need not be
shown. The intent to seduce the girl is sufficient. (See People v.
Ramirez, et al., 39 Phil. 738)

If there was sexual intercourse after the forcible abduction,
and the offender used force or intimidation, or when the woman was
deprived of reason, is demented or otherwise unconscious, or the
victim was under 12 years of age, the offender is liable for the complex
crime of forcible abduction with rape under Article 266-A in relation
to Articles 335 and 342 of the Code.
1184

Art. 342

But the act of the accused in kissing only the offended party,
when he had the opportunity to do further unchaste designs, did not
constitute lewd designs. (People v. Crisostomo, et al., 46 Phil. 775)
Lewd designs present in hurried ceremony of marriage by force.

When the ceremony of the marriage is merely an artifice by
which the accused sought to escape the criminal consequences of his
acts, the intention to contract marriage constitutes lewd designs, as
where the offender knows that the girl cannot give consent legally
to the marriage because of minority. The intention to marry may
sometimes constitute unchaste designs, not by itself but by the
attending circumstances vitiating such intention, as when the male
knows that the minor female, 15 years of age, cannot legally consent
to the marriage, and yet he elopes with her. (People v. Hatib Tala, et
al., CA., 44 O.G. 117; People v. Crisostomo, 46 Phil. 775)

Intention to marry does not constitute unchaste designs when both
defendant and the woman have the required age for consenting to
marriage.

Thus, when not only the woman, but the man as well, had the
required age for consenting to marriage, and it does not appear that
either of them had any impediment to contracting it, the intention

to marry does not constitute unchaste designs. (People v. Crisostomo,
46 Phil. 780)

Note: The offended party in this case was 30 years of age. The
intention to marry on the part of the accused was not considered as
constitutive of unchaste designs.
1185

Art. 342

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

When there are several defendants, it is enough that one of them
had lewd designs.

For the conviction of various defendants for the crime of
abduction, it is enough that there was lewd design by one of them
and that the same was known to the others who cooperated in the
commission of the felony. (People v. Deleguiado, et al., CA., 38 O.G.
3587)

Husband not liable for abduction of his wife, as lewd design is
wanting.

The husband cannot be found guilty of the crime of forcible
abduction of his wife, the element of unchaste or lewd design being
wanting. (People v. Omar, et al., 8 CA. Rep. 999)

Nature of the crime of forcible abduction.

In the crime of forcible abduction, the act of the offender is
violative of the individual liberty of the abducted, her honor and
reputation, and of public order. (U.S. v. De Vivar, 29 Phil. 458)

Forcible abduction distinguished from grave coercion.

In both crimes, there is violence or intimidation used by the
offender and the offended party is compelled to do something against
her will.
When there is no lewd design, It is coercion, provided that there Is
no deprivation of liberty for an appreciable length of time.
The girl was dragged from the doorway of her house to a waiting
vehicle 40 or 50 feet away. This is grave coercion. (U.S. v. Alexander,
8 Phil. 29)

From the moment that the accused, by means of violence and
intimidation, had taken and put the offended party in the truck
against her will, they compelled her to do something against her will.
Since the accused did not molest or attempt to molest her during the
ride and the whole time she stayed with the accused, the element of
lewd design was lacking and, hence, the crime committed was grave
coercion under Article 286. (People v. Cruz, CA., 50 O.G. 3720)
1186

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimes Against Chastity

Art. 342

Forcible abduction distinguished from corruption of minors.
Where a 13-year-old girl was abducted by the accused without
lewd designs on his part, but for the purpose of lending her to illicit
intercourse with others, the crime committed by the accused was held
to be not abduction but corruption of minors. (U.S. v. Tagle, 1 Phil.
626)

When there is deprivation of liberty and no lewd designs, it is
kidnapping and serious illegal detention (Art. 267).

The accused met a girl and her aunt on the way and dragged
the girl along, taking her to a rice field. Meanwhile, the other accused
caught hold of the girl’s aunt, thus preventing her from helping her
niece. The accused were convicted of forcible abduction by the lower
court, but the Supreme Court reversed the judgment and convicted
them of illegal detention, saying: “We have, therefore, the kidnapping
of a woman which was not proven to have been committed with
unchaste designs. Abduction, being one of the ways in which illegal
detention can be committed, specially qualified by lewd intention, the
kidnapping of a woman without unchaste designs must, according
to Viada and to our Penal Code, be considered as illegal detention.”
(People v. Crisostomo, 46 Phil. 775)
Forcible abduction with rape distinguished from kidnapping.

A, B, C and others grabbed a girl 15 years of age and then dragged
her to a nearby forest. There she was brutally ravished, first by A
and afterwards by B.

Are they guilty of kidnapping with rape?

Held: The crime is not kidnapping with rape, but forcible

abduction with rape. When the violent taking of a woman is motivated
by lewd designs as in this case forcible abduction under Article
342 of the R.P.C. is the offense. When it is not so motivated, such

—

—

taking constitutes kidnapping under Article 267 as amended. (People
v. Crisostomo, 46 Phil. 775; People v. Undiana, 50 Phil. 641) One
offense is against chastity, the other against personal liberty. (People
u. Quitain, et al., 99 Phil. 226)

1187

Art. 342

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Forcible abduction with several acts of rape.
There can only be one complex crime of forcible abduction with
rape. The crime of forcible abduction was only necessary for the first
rape. Thus, the subsequent acts of rape can no longer be considered
as separate complex crimes of forcible abduction with rape. They
should be detached from and considered independently of the forcible
abduction. Therefore, accused should be convicted of one complex
crime of forcible abduction with rape and three separate acts of rape.
(People v. Garcia, et al., G.R. No. 141125, February 28, 2002)

Is there a complex crime of forcible abduction with attempted rape?

The act of appellant in grabbing the victim while she was walking
towards barrio San Agustin, and dragging her into the cornfields, some
40 meters away from the footpath, where by means of force he tried
to have sexual intercourse with her but did not perform all the acts
necessary to consummate such purpose, only constitutes abduction
and not abduction complexed with attempted rape, because said
appellant took away the victim for the purpose of corrupting her. In
other words, the attempt to rape her is absorbed by the abduction,
being the element of lewd design of the latter. (People v. Magtabog,
et al., 4 CA. Rep. 802, citing U.S. u. De Vibar, 29 Phil. 451)
Commission of other crimes during confinement of victim is
immaterial to charge of kidnapping with serious Illegal detention.

The accused assails the decision finding him guilty of kidnapping
defined and penalized by Article 267 of the R.P.C. It is being claimed
that considering the testimony of complainant that she was raped by
the accused while in the house of the latter’s compadre in Caloocan,
and again while in the house of his uncle in Bulacan, he (the accused)
should have been adjudged guilty of abduction with rape instead.
There is no merit in the allegation. The accused stood trial for
kidnapping with serious illegal detention, and the deprivation of
complainant’s liberty, which is the essential element of the offense
(People v. Suarez, 82 Phil. 484), was duly proved. That there may have
been other crimes committed in the course of the victim’s confinement
is immaterial to this case. The kidnapping became consummated
when the victim was actually restrained or deprived of her freedom,
and that makes proper the prosecution of the herein accused under
1188

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimes Against Chastity

Art. 342

Article 267 of the R.P.C. The surrounding circumstances make it
clear that the main purpose of Annabelle’s detention was to coerce
her into withdrawing her previous charges against appellant Ablaza,
thus, obstructing the administration of justice. The acts of rape were
incidental and used as a means to break the girl’s spirit and induce
her to dismiss the criminal charge. (People v. Ablaza, L-27352, October
31, 1969, 30 SCRA 173, 177-178)
Forcible abduction only, or rape only.

The criminal liability of accused is only for forcible abduction
under Article 342 of the R.P.C. The sexual abuse which accused¬
appellant forced upon Lenie constitutes the lewd design inherent
in forcible abduction and is thus absorbed therein. The indecent
molestation cannot form the other half of a complex crime since the
record does not show that the principal purpose of the accused was
to commit any of the crimes against chastity and that her abduction
would only be a necessary means to commit the same. Surely it would
not have been the case that accused-appellant would touch Lenie
only once during her four-month captivity, as she herself admitted,
if his chief or primordial intention had been to lay with her. Instead,
what we discern from the evidence is that the intent to seduce the
girl forms part and parcel of her forcible abduction and shares equal
importance with the other element of the crime which was to remove
the victim from her home or from whatever familiar place she may
be and to take her to some other. Stated otherwise, the intention of
accused-appellant as the evidence shows was not only to seduce the
victim but also to separate her from her family, especially from her
father, clearly tell-tale signs of forcible abduction. (People v. Egan,
G.R. No. 139338, May 28, 2002)

There is no complex crime of forcible abduction with rape if
the primary objective of the accused is to commit rape. Although
the elements of forcible abduction are present, the accused should
be convicted only of rape. His forcible abduction of the victim was
absorbed by the rape considering that his real objective in abducting
her was to commit the rape. Where the main objective of the culprit
for the abduction of the victim of rape was to have carnal knowledge
of her, he could be convicted only of rape. (People v. Domingo, G.R.

Attempted forcible abduction.

Elements.

The accused, who previously made an attempt upon the chastity
of the offended girl, tried to take her away in a carriage, while she
was standing at the door of her house. The accused did not succeed in
taking away the girl, because of the girl’s resistance and because of
the intervention of a policeman. The offense was attempted abduction.
The lewd designs were indicated by the holding of the girl around her
waist and by the attempt of the accused upon the chastity of the girl
on previous night. (U.S. v. Luna, 4 Phil. 269)

1.

That the offended party must be a virgin.

2.

That she must be over 12 and under 18 years of age.

3.

That the taking away of the offended party must be with her
consent, after solicitation or cajolery from the offender.
That the taking away of the offended party must be with lewd

Conviction of acts of lasciviousness, not a bar to conviction of
forcible abduction.

To prove lewd designs in forcible abduction, actual illicit
relations with the woman abducted need not be shown. Intent to
seduce is sufficient. Lustful designs may be inferred from acts or may
be shown by conduct. (People v. Ramirez, et al., 39 Phil. 738; People v.
Bustos, et al., 54 Phil. 887) So even though an accused did not actually
commit any acts of lasciviousness, libidinous designs may exist. On
the other hand, in the crime of acts of lasciviousness, the lecherous
acts must have actually been committed. Moreover, in the crime of
abduction, the person abducted must be a woman, while in the crime
of acts of lasciviousness, the lustful acts may be committed upon
persons of either sex. Accordingly, one of these two crimes involves
some important act which is not an essential element of the other, so
that the conviction of one of them is not obstacle to that of the other.
There was, therefore, no double jeopardy. (People v. Franco, CA., 53

Meaning of virginity.

The virginity referred to in Article 343 is not to be understood in
so material a sense as to exclude the idea of abduction of a virtuous
woman of good reputation.

Thus, even if the accused had sexual intercourse with the girl
before they eloped, there is still a case of abduction with consent.
(U.S. v. Casten, 34 Phil. 808)

But when the offended party had carnal knowledge with other
men, the chaste character of the girl is open to question.(U.S. v. Suan,
27 Phil. 12)
If virgin is under 12 years old, it is forcible abduction.

If the offended party is under 12 years of age, the crime committed
is forcible abduction, even if the girl agrees to the elopement.

Must the taking of the virgin have the character of permanency?

No. The crime exists where the offended girl was kept in the
house of the accused from 10:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m., the latter with lewd
designs. “No matter how short is the taking away the crime exists.”
(People v. Ingayo, CA., G.R. No. 3423, December 10, 1949)

Offended party need not be taken from her house.
The girl, through cajolery, left her mother’s house, by
prearrangement with the defendant and at his bidding, inasmuch as
he awaited her on the road and they came to the city where they hid
themselves and lodged together. (U.S. v. Reyes, 20 Phil. 510)
1191

Art 343

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The abductor need not actually and personally have taken the
abducted female from her parent’s home, or induced her to abandon
it. It is sufficient that he was instrumental in her escape. The shock,
the anxiety, the shame, and all the concomitant evils suffered by
the family of the girl are not greater when the starting point of the
abduction is the home where she lives than when it has its beginning
somewhere else. (People v. Moreno, CA., G.R. No. 7424, October, 1941)

The offended girl, 15 years old, was on her way to her aunt’s
house to spend a few days there. Through cunning, and possibly by
deceit and cajolery, the accused succeeded in persuading the girl to
go with him to a place in order to enjoy her and satisfy his carnal
lust. (People v. Ignacio, CA., 44 O.G. 2291)
Consent of the minor to being taken away may be due to honeyed
promises of marriage by the offender.

Thus, where the defendant, by means of honeyed promises of
marriage, induces a minor to leave her house and deflowers her, and
immediately after which she returns to her dwelling, he is guilty of
the offense of consented abduction. (People v. Cabrera, CA., G.R. No.
229, September 18, 1937; 37 O.G. 2029)

by means of promises made to, or cajolery or enticement exerted
upon her by her abductor. Where the meeting of the complainant and
the accused was merely accidental and lasted for only two minutes,
and the only topics of conversation was the former’s well-nigh all¬
consuming mortal terror inspired by her mother’s ire, it is difficult
to conceive that the latter could have entertained the thought of
ultimately having sexual intercourse with the complainant, as the
principal and primary motive, during the chance meeting. (People v.
Palisoc, 6 CA. Rep. 65)
The taking away must be with lewd designs.

Like in forcible abduction, the element of lewd designs is
important in consented abduction. Actual sexual intercourse with
the abducted girl is not necessary. Kissing and holding the body of
the girl while being abducted with her consent is indicative of lewd
designs. The intention to marry may show lewd designs, as when the
offender knows or should know that a minor cannot legally consent
to the marriage, and that he cannot possibly marry her because of
lack of a marriage license and parental consent. His intentions then,
instead of being good and noble, are unchaste and lewd. (See People
v. Ignacio, CA., 44 O.G. 2291, and People v. Crisostomo, 46 Phil. 775)

A girl, 16 years old, went to the house of a man whom she loved
one early morning. When the man woke up, he was surprised to find
the girl beside him on the bed. As they were in love with each other,
they had sexual intercourse without the man promising anything
to the girl. What crime was committed by the man? No crime was
committed. It cannot be consented abduction, because the girl went
to the house of the man voluntarily without solicitation or cajolery.
It cannot be seduction, because no deceit was employed by the man
before having sexual intercourse with her.
Article 343 of the R.P.C. contemplates that the accused be an
active physical agency instrumental in causing the female to leave
or abandon her house. Where the female voluntarily leaves her home
and subsequently is taken by the accused to a particular place for a
prohibited purpose, or where the female on her own volition goes to the

Purpose of the law in punishing the crime of consented abduction.
The purpose of the law is not to punish the wrong done to the
girl, because she consents thereto, but to prescribe punishment
for the disgrace to her family and the alarm caused therein by the
disappearance of the one who is, by her age and sex, susceptible to
cajolery and deceit. (U.S. v. Reyes, 20 Phil. 510)

Consented abduction with rape.
Where a 15-year-old girl was induced to leave her home and
later forcibly violated by the four accused, they are guilty of consented
abduction with rape. (People v. Amante, 49 Phil. 679)

PROVISIONS RELATIVE TO THE PRECEDING
CHAPTERS OF TITLE ELEVEN

Art. 344. Prosecution of the crimes of adultery,
concubinage, seduction, abduction, rape, and acts of
lasciviousness. The crimes of adultery and concubinage
shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the
offended spouse.

—

The offended party cannot institute criminal
prosecution without including both the guilty parties if they
are both alive, nor, in any case, if he shall have consented or
pardoned the offenders.
The offenses of seduction, abduction, rape, or acts of
lasciviousness, shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint
filed by the offended party or her parents, grandparents, or
guardian, nor, in any case, if the offender has been expressly
pardoned by the above-named persons, as the case may be.

In cases of seduction, abduction, acts of lasciviousness,
and rape, the marriage of the offender with the offended
party shall extinguish the criminal action or remit the
penalty already imposed upon him. The provisions of this
paragraph shall also be applicable to the co-principals,
accomplices, and accessories after the fact of the abovementioned crimes.

be
prosecuted upon complaint signed by
a. offended party,

her parents,

c.

grandparents, or

d.

guardians in the order in which they are named above.

The court motu proprio can dismiss the case for
failure of the
aggrieved party to file the proper complaint, though the accused
never
raised the question on appeal, thereby showing the necessity of strict
compliance with the legal requirement even at the cost of nullifying
all the proceedings already had in the lower court. (People v. Santos,
et al., 101 Phil. 798)

Underlying principle or reason why crimes against chastity cannot
be prosecuted de oflclo.
Article 344 was enacted “out of consideration for the offended
woman and her family who might prefer to suffer the outrage in
silence rather than go through with the scandal of a public trial.”
(Samilin v. Court of First Instance, 57 Phil. 298)
In some instances, the virginity of the girl may be questioned.
This would involve the examination of the girl’s past life and the
conduct of her family, which may cause painful mortifications to the
modesty and honor of the girl and cause discredit to her family. (U.S.
v. Bautista, 40 Phil. 735)
Rape may be prosecuted de oficio.

Pursuant to R.A. No. 8353, the ‘Anti-Rape Law of 1997,” rape
is a crime against persons which may be prosecuted de oficio.

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Prosecution of adultery and concubinage.
The crimes of adultery and concubinage shall not be prosecuted
except upon a complaint filed by the offended spouse. The offended
party cannot institute criminal prosecution without including both
the guilty parties, if they are both alive, nor, in any case, if he shall
have consented or pardoned the offenders. (Sec. 5, Rule 110, Rules
of Court; Art. 344, R.P.C.)

Prosecution of the crime of prostitution.

To call a married woman a prostitute is not merely to proclaim
her an adulteress, a violator of her maternal vows; it is to charge
her of having committed an offense against public morals, or moral
degeneracy far exceeding that involved in the maintenance of
adulterous relations. The imputation of a crime of prostitution against
a woman can be prosecuted de oficio. (People v. Judge Orcullo, 111
SCRA 609)
Only the offended spouse can file the complaint

The parent or grandparent, or any other person in behalf of the
offended party, is not authorized by law in any case to sign and file
complaint for adultery or concubinage.

Even in the case where the offended spouse is underage, his or
her parents cannot file the complaint for adultery or concubinage, as
the case may be, against the offenders. Or, if because of disease the
offended spouse becomes incapacitated to file the complaint, nobody
else can file it for him or her.
The dismissal by the justice of the peace of a husband’s complaint
for adultery after the preliminary investigation is a termination of the
case. It can be reopened only upon a new complaint of the offended
husband. (Quilatan and Santiago v. Caruncho, 21 Phil. 399)
Both the guilty parties, If both alive, must be included In the
complaint for adultery or concubinage.

In adultery and concubinage, both the guilty parties, when they
are both alive, must be included in the complaint. (Art. 344, par. 2;
Sec. 5, Rule 110, Rules of Court)

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimes Against Chastity

Art. 344

In adultery, the complaint must be instituted against both the wife
and her paramour. The husband is expressly prohibited from filing
the complaint against one of the parties without including therein
the other. (U.S. v. Asuncion, 22 Phil. 358)

Both parties must be included in the complaint even if one of them

is not guilty.

The reason for this ruling is that it is not for the husband to
determine the question of the guilt or innocence of the paramour in
the crime of adultery; the question must be left to the court. (U.S. v.
Asuncion, 22 Phil. 358)

Prosecution of seduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness.
The offenses of seduction, abduction, or acts of lasciviousness
shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the offended
party or her parents, grandparents, or guardian, nor, in any case, if the
offender has been expressly pardoned by the above-named persons,
as the case may be.
The offended party, even if she were a minor, has the right to
institute the prosecution for the above offenses, independently of
her parents, grandparents or guardian, unless she is incompetent or
incapable of doing so upon grounds other than her minority. Where
the offended party who is a minor fails to file the complaint, her
parents, grandparents or guardian, may file the same. The right to
file the action granted to the parents, grandparents or guardian shall
be exclusive of all other persons and shall be exercised successively
in the order herein provided. (Sec. 5, Rule 110, Rules of Court; Art.
344, R.P.C.)

The fact that she is a minor (being only 12 years old) is not an
impediment for her to sign the complaint. (People v. Medina, CA.,
45 O.G. 338)

But if the offended party is insane or physically disabled, the
father can sign the complaint. If the father is dead, the mother can do

it. If both are dead, then the grandfather should sign the complaint,

etc. (U.S. v. Bautista, 40 Phil. 735)
It is exclusive, because if the parent of the girl for instance,
refuses to file the complaint, the grandparent cannot file the
complaint.

When the offended party is a minor, her parents may file the
complaint.

But this ruling should be applied only when the mother instituted
the action without contradiction from the father.(Concurring opinion
of Justice Carson, citing Viada, Vol. 7, p. 313)

Art. 344

When the offended party is a minor and she does not file the
complaint, this may be done by her parents, grandparents or guardian,
in the order named. (Benga-Oras v. Evangelista, et al., 97 Phil. 612)

Art. 344

When the offended party is of age and is In complete possession of
her mental and physical faculties, she alone can file the complaint

The guardian is one legally appointed by the court
The term “guardian” means legal, not natural guardian; that
is, guardian legally appointed in accordance with the provision of the
law. (People v. De la Cruz, 59 Phil. 531)

When the offended party is already of age and is in complete
possession of her mental and physical faculties, no one would dispute
her paramount right to avenge the wrong done to the exclusion of
her parents and other relatives mentioned in the law. (Benga-Oras v.
Evangelista, et al., 97 Phil. 612)

Article 344 prescribes no special form of establishing the relation
between the complainant and the minor who is the victim of any of
the offenses therein enumerated nor does it require that such relation,
in the case of a guardian and ward, be necessarily proved by means
of a judicial decree or order.

If the offended woman is of age, she should be the one to file the
complaint. The other persons named in Article 344 cannot file the
complaint. (People v. Mandia, 60 Phil. 372)

It is sufficient that a person affirms under oath that he is the
guardian of a minor. (People v. Formento, et al., 60 Phil. 434)

A woman is of age when she has reached her 21 years at which
majority begins. (De la Costa v. Tolentino, 66 Phil. 101)
Is the father, if living, preferred to the mother in the filing of the
complaint for seduction?

The Supreme Court has answered this question in the negative
in the case of U.S. v. Gariboso. (25 Phil. 171)

Note: But if it is denied, he has to prove it by means of judicial
order.
When complexed with another crime, complaint need not be signed
by the offended woman.

In case of complex crimes, where one of the component offenses
is a public crime, the criminal prosecution may be instituted by the
fiscal. The reason is that since one of the component offenses is a
public crime, the latter should prevail, because public interest is
always paramount to private interest. (People v. Yu, 110 Phil. 793)

There is no indication in said article that the complaint must
be presented by the father, if living, and if not, then by the mother.
If we take, for instance, the case of the grandparents, there might be
four persons living who are included in the law who might present
the complaint. There is no indication that one of the grandparents is
preferred over another. It would seem to be clear, under the provisions
of said article, that any one of the grandparents, in the absence of
the parents, might present the complaint for the crime mentioned in
said section. This would also seem to be true as to the parents.
Note: In this case, the father of the offended girl left his home
upon knowing the commission of the offense. During his absence, the
mother of the girl presented the complaint.

view in no way warranted by the language, as well as the manifest
policy, of the law. The term “pardon” refers to the offense after its
commission. “Consent” refers to the offense prior to its commission.
No logical difference can be perceived between prior and subsequent
consent, for in both instances as the offended party has chosen to
compromise with his/her dishonor, he/she becomes unworthy to
come to court and invoke its aid in the vindication of the wrong. For
instance, a husband who delivers his wife to another man for adultery,
is an unworthy, if not more, as where, upon acquiring knowledge of the
adultery after its commission, he says or does nothing. [The Court],
therefore, hold[s] that prior consent is as effective as subsequent
consent to bar the offended party from prosecuting the offense.”

Art. 344

Express pardon of the offender by the offended party or other
persons named in the law, as the case may be, is a bar to prosecution
for seduction, abduction, rape or acts of lasciviousness. (Art. 344, par.
3)

Pardon in seduction must also come before the institution of
criminal action. (People v. Miranda, 51 Phil. 274)
Can the parent of the offended party in adultery or concubinage
validly pardon the offenders?

The law is clear on this point. It says: “nor x x x if he (the offended
party) shall have pardoned the offenders.” Hence, the parent of the
offended party cannot validly pardon the offenders in adultery or
concubinage.
Agreement to live separately, as evidence of consent

Where the spouses signed an agreement stipulating “that both of
us are free to get any mate and live with as husband and wife without
any interference by any of us, nor either of us can prosecute the other
for adultery or concubinage,” said stipulation is an unbridled license
for the commission of concubinage or adultery. It constitutes consent
(Matubis v. Praxedes, G.R. No. L-11766, October 25, 1960)

But a document which states, that the parties “will cease our
relationship for the good of all of us,” does not prove the condonation
envisaged by Article 344. (People v. Solsona, CA., 47 O.G. 1926)

Art. 344

Example of pardon:

F was aware that his wife was having carnal relations with M.
With this knowledge, F and his wife executed a separation agreement.
After this agreement was signed by them, F visited his wife and M
in their residence. Later, F filed a complaint for adultery against his
wife and M. His complaint for adultery was dismissed, because F had
pardoned the adulterous acts of his wife. (People v. Mendez and Del
Pilar, CA., 51 O.G. 1909)
Affidavit showing consent, basis for new trial.
Where during the pendency of the appeal from a judgment
convicting the husband of concubinage, the wife executed an affidavit
stating that she consented to the concubinage, the case was remanded
to the trial court for new trial. (People v. Camara, 100 Phil. 1098)

In the case of People v. Schneckenburger, et al., 73 Phil. 413, the
Supreme Court stated: “[The Court] said before in the case of People
v. Guinucud, 58 Phil. 621, that the consent which bars the offended
party from instituting a criminal prosecution in cases of adultery,
concubinage, seduction, abduction, rape, and acts of lasciviousness is
that which has been given expressly or impliedly after the crime has
been committed. [The Court] [is] now convinced that this is a narrow

Condonation is not pardon in concubinage or adultery.
As condonation is forgiveness based upon the presumption
and belief that the guilty party has repented, any subsequent acts
of the offender showing that there was no repentance will not bar
the prosecution of the offense. Any act of infidelity to the vows of
marriage subsequent to in the condonation constitutes a new offense
that is subject to criminal prosecution. (People v. Engle and Price, 8
CA., Rep. 495)
Note: When the complaint for adultery or concubinage is based
on acts already pardoned by the offended spouse, the complaint will
be dismissed.

Implied pardon or consent in adultery.

Where the offended husband, who had filed a complaint for
adultery the second day after he had surprised her in criminal
intercourse with her co-accused, permitted his wife to continue living
in the conjugal home until her arrest, in order to take care of their
children, such sufferance does not amount to implied pardon so as to
bar criminal prosecution. (People v. Boca, et al., CA., 34 O.G. 2248)

If it was the wife who abandoned the husband, his failure to look
for her would not amount to consent to her adulterous acts committed
during the period of separation. (Ocampo v. Florenciano, G.R. No.
L-13553, February 23, 1960)
Delay In the filing of complaint, if satisfactorily explained, does not
indicate pardon.

Appellants contended that complainant had consented to their
illicit acts or had pardoned them in view of the length of time that she
allowed to lapse before filing her complaint. Complainant explained
that she delayed the institution of the case because she was after
sufficient evidence to insure the conviction of appellants. She knew
that her husband was clever and resourceful. The birth of the child to
his concubine was the event she was waiting for, and soon thereafter
she filed her complaint.
Held: That the lapse of time had a plausible explanation. There
was no inexcusable delay. There was no proof of consent or pardon.
(People v. Llagas and Neri, C.A., 40 O.G. 990)

Where the offended husband discovered the illicit relations of his
wife with her co-accused in 1954, and filed his complaint for adultery
in January, 1956, because during the interim he spied on the accused
and waited for evidence, and his wife gave birth to a child in May,
1955, during the time the accused were cohabiting together, there
was no tolerance or acquiescence on the part of the husband. (People
u. Acopiado, et al., 2 CA. Rep. 725)
The pardon must be express in seduction, abduction, rape, or acts
of lasciviousness.

to the consequent alarm, the girl’s father allowed her to stay with the

accused on the faith of his assurance that he would marry her, such
consent cannot be construed as a pardon extinguishing the criminal
liability of the accused. (People v. Garcia, CA., 40 O.G. 4479)
Pardon by parent, grandparent, or guardian.
Article 344 provides that the offenses of seduction, abduction,
rape, or acts of lasciviousness shall not be prosecuted in any case,
if the offender has been expressly pardoned by the offended party or
her parents, grandparents, or guardian, as the case may be.
Can the parent validly grant pardon to the offender without the
express pardon by the offended girl?
The mother of the offended girl, 11 years of age, cannot validly
grant pardon, because the pardon must be granted directly by
the offended party, and it is only when she is dead or otherwise
incapacitated to grant it, that her parents, grandparents, or guardian
may do so for her. (People v. Arguelles, CA., G.R. No. 612, March
31, 1937) Pardon by the parent must be accompanied by the express
pardon of the girl herself. (U.S. v. Luna, 1 Phil. 360)

Pardon by the offended party who is a minor must have the
concurrence of parents.

The reason for the rule that the parents and the minor girl
concur in giving the pardon, is that the minor girl, “in her tender age
and lack of sufficient knowledge, would hardly know the full impact
and consequences of her acts. In her indifference and inexperience,
the parents are given the right and power to protect her.” (People v.
Lacson, Jr., CA., 56 O.G. 9460)

Exception.

When the offended girl has no parents who could concur in the
pardon, she can validly extend a pardon even if she is a minor, as when
the offender is her father and her mother is already dead. (People v.

Art. 345

Criminal Law

Crimes Against Chastity

Marriage of the offender with the offended party in seduction,
abduction, acts of lasciviousness and rape, extinguishes criminal
action or remits the penalty already imposed.

Marriage of the offender with the offended party in other crimes
does not extinguish criminal liability of the offender.

Marriage of the offender with the offended party benefits the
co-principals, accomplices and accessories.

Even if the accused as accomplice is already serving sentence,
the marriage of the principal with the offended party must benefit
him. (Laceste v. Santos, 56 Phil. 472)
This rule applies also to the accessory after the fact.

But the marriage must be entered into in good faith and with
the intent of fulfilling the marital duties and obligations. (People u.
Santiago, 51 Phil. 68)

Note: The co-principals referred to in Article 344 are those by
inducement and by indispensable cooperation in one single crime of
rape. If there are two or more crimes of rape committed by several
persons as principals by direct participation, the rule is not applicable
because each carnal access amounts to a separate and independent
crime of rape. (People v. Bernardo, CA., 38 O.G. 3479)
In rape, marriage extinguishes the criminal action or the penalty
Imposed only as to the principal.

In crimes against chastity, marriage between the offender
and the offended party benefits not only the principals but also the
accomplices and accessories. However, since rape has ceased to be
a crime against chastity, but is now a crime against persons, it now
appears that marriage extinguishes the penal action and the penalty
only as to the principal (i.e., husband) and not as to the accomplices
and accessories.
Actual marriage, not desire to marry, extinguishes criminal liability.

As the appellant incurred criminal liability for qualified
seduction, his alleged desire to marry the offended party could not
extinguish such liability. Only actual marriage could extinguish such
liability. (People v. Paulino, 7 CA. Rep. 553)

1204

A and B (a woman) had amorous relations. Because of certain
differences, their relationship was terminated. A committed libel
and slander by deed against B. A was convicted of both crimes. Two

months after said conviction, A contracted marriage with the offended
party.

Held: Article 344 is not applicable, because the crimes of which
A was convicted are not among those enumerated therein. (People v.
Orzame, CA., 39 O.G. 1168)
Marriage of parties guilty of adultery or concubinage, not included.

Note that the last paragraph of Article 344 specifically mentions
the crimes, and adultery and concubinage are not included.
A and B were prosecuted for adultery and, after trial, were
convicted. While serving sentence for a few days, the offended husband
died. A and B want to marry to be relieved of criminal responsibility.
Is this legally possible? No. The marriage of the parties guilty of
adultery and concubinage is not included in this provision, as a means
to extinguish the criminal action or to remit the penalty already
imposed.

The reason for this is that both parties are offenders.

In a prosecution for concubinage, the marriage between the
erring husband and his concubine, before or after the institution of
the case is not available as a defense. (People v. Baglan, et al., 10 CA.

2.

3.

In every case to support the offspring.

Civil liability of the adulterer and the concubine.

The adulterer and the concubine can be sentenced only to
indemnify for damages caused to the offended spouse.

The last paragraph of Article 345 authorizes the imposition of
indemnity in cases of concubinage against the concubine only, but not
against the guilty husband. (People v. Ramirez, et al., 63 O.G. 7939)
The guilty wife in adultery cannot also be sentenced to indemnify for
damages caused to the offended husband. The law speaks of adulterer,
not adulteress.
Under the Revised Penal Code, there is no civil liability for acts of
lasciviousness.

Note: Article 345 mentions only person guilty of rape, seduction,
or abduction, and the adulterer and concubine. The person guilty of
acts of lasciviousness is not mentioned.

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimes Against Chastity

Art. 345

Moral damages in crimes against chastity.
Article 2219 of the Civil Code provides that moral damages may
be recovered in seduction, abduction, rape, or other lascivious acts,
as well as in adultery and concubinage. The parents of the female
seduced, abducted, raped or abused may also recover moral damages.
Moral damages may be recovered both by the offended party and
by her parents.
The loss of her virginity at the hands of the appellant, together
with the attendant shame and scandal, entitles her, in the view
of th(e] Court, to the sum of P2,500 in moral damages. Her future
as a woman is definitely impaired, and the resultant prejudice
against her engendered in the male population of the barrio where
she resides cannot be blinked away. The second error of the lower
court is in making the award payable to the offended party or to
her parents, which award is, by the very wording of the judgment,
in the alternative. Article 2219 of the New Civil Code provides that
moral damages are recoverable by the offended party in the cases
of “seduction, abduction, rape, or other lascivious acts” and that the
“parents of the female seduced, abducted, raped, or abused xxx may
also recover moral damages.” (Italics supplied) The conviction of the
accused suffices as a basis to adjudge him, in the same action, liable
for an award of moral damages, without independent proof thereof,
to the victim and her parents, because the law presumes that not
only the woman who was seduced, abducted, raped or abused, but
as well her parents, naturally suffer besmirched reputation, social
humiliation, mental anguish, and wounded feelings. In the case at
bar, moral damages must be awarded to the offended woman and her
parents, not to either of them, as ordered by the court a quo. (People
v. Fontanilla, G.R. No. L-25354, June 28, 1968)

Reasons why only indemnity is possible in adultery and
concubinage.

Civil liability of the offenders in multiple rape.

Acknowledgment of the offspring is not legally possible,
because only children bom of parents who could marry at the time
of conception may be acknowledged. Support of the offspring is not
included, because the person who gives birth, if at all, is one of the
offenders and not the offended party.

All the accused must support the offspring. As any one of them
may be the father and that each and every one of them is directly
responsible that an unwilling mother may gave birth to an undesired
offspring, each and every one of them contributed to, and cooperated
in, the giving birth to the child. (People v. Velo, et al., 80 Phil. 438)

Recognition of offspring in multiple rape.

When three persons, one after another, raped a woman, not one
may be required to recognize the offspring of the offended woman, it
being impossible to determine the paternity thereof. (People v. Pedro
de Leon, et al., G.R. No. L-2094, April 1950)
Judgment to recognize offspring, when proper; Article 283, Civil
Code, applied.

The phrase “when the period of the offense coincides more or
less with that of the conception” in Article 283, No. (1), Civil Code,
means, in clearer language, that there is pregnancy within the
period of conception, which is within 120 days from the commission
of the offense. Hence, for the application of Article 283, No. (1), Civil
Code, in a criminal action for rape, there must be evidence that the
offended woman became pregnant within 120 days from the date of
the commission of the crimes. In the absence of such evidence, it is
not proper for the judgment to indulge in speculation by sentencing
the accused “to recognize the offspring, if any." (People v. Rivera, CA.,
58 O.G. 68)

Prohibition against acknowledgment of offspring when offender is
married, not applicable under the Family Code.
While under Article 283 of the Civil Code, the father is obliged
to recognize the child as his natural child in cases of rape, abduction
and seduction when the period of the offense coincides, more or
less, with the period of conception, it has been held, however, that
acknowledgment is disallowed if the offender is a married man, with
only support for the offspring as part of the sentence. With the passage
of the Family Code, however, the classifications of acknowledged
natural children and natural children by legal fiction have been
eliminated. At present, children are classified as only either legitimate
or illegitimate, with no further positive act required of the parent as the
law itself provides the child’s status. As such, natural children under
the Civil Code fall within the classification of illegitimate children
under the Family Code.

TITLE ELEVEN
Crimes Against Chastity

Art. 346

there is no further need for the prohibition against acknowledgment
of the offspring by the offender who is married which would vest
parental authority in him. Therefore, under Article 345 of the R.P.C.,
the offender in a rape case who is married can only be sentenced
to indemnify the victim and support the offspring, if there be any.
However, in light of Article 201 of the Family Code, the amount and
terms of support should be determined by the trial court only after
due notice and hearing. (People v. Bayani, 262 SCRA 688)
Civil liability in rape of married woman.
Only indemnity is allowed in rape of a married woman. (People
v. Sanico, CA., 46 O.G. 98)

In People v. Bulaybulay, G.R. No. 104275, September 28, 1995
and People v. Acabo, G.R. No. 106977, July 17, 1997, the indemnity
for rape was fixed at P50.000.
Defendant cannot be sentenced to acknowledge the offspring,
because the character of the origin prevents it, for the woman is
married. (People v. Manaba, 58 Phil. 665)

Defendant cannot be sentenced to support the offspring.
The same reason which prevents the offender from acknowledging
the offspring should also prohibit him from entering periodically
the home of the woman raped, in order to comply with the duty of
supporting the spurious offspring. If this is allowed, it will be the
source of great disturbance to the family rights of the parents who
should live in peace and enjoy the attributes of their legitimate
authority over their children. (U.S. v. Yambao, 4 Phil. 204)

Art. 346. Liability of ascendants, guardians, teachers,
or other persons entrusted with the custody of the offended
party.
The ascendants, guardians, curators, teachers,
and any person who, by abuse of authority or confidential
relationship, shall cooperate as accomplices in the
perpetration of the crimes embraced in chapters second,
third and fourth of this title, shall be punished as principals.

Article 176 of the Family Code confers parental authority over
illegitimate children on the mother, and likewise provides for their
entitlement to support in conformity with the Family Code. As such,

as principals.

There is another crime where the accomplice is punished as
principal, and that is the crime of slight illegal detention. (Art. 268,

1.

Simulation of births.

2.

Substitution of one child for another.

3.

Concealing or abandoning any legitimate child with intent to
cause such child to lose its civil status.

The object of the crime under Article 347 is the creation of false, or
the causing of the loss of, civil status.

The commission of any of the acts defined in Article 347, must
have for its object, the creation of a false civil status. The purpose is
to cause the loss of any trace as to the filiation of the child.
The child, whose birth the woman feigns, loses its civil status in
the family of the woman who has really given its birth and acquires,
through fraud, another status to which it has no right.
The same may be said with reference to the substitution of one
child for another.

Simulation of birth.
The simulation of birth takes place when the woman pretends

to be pregnant when in fact she is not, and on the day of the supposed
delivery, takes the child of another as her own.
In this case, the woman introduces a stranger in the family and

defrauds the legitimate heirs.
The woman who simulates birth and the one who furnishes the

child are both responsible as principals. (Guevara)

'See Appendix “A,” Table of Penalties, No. 19.
1212

1213

Art. 347

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

The simulation which is a crime is that which alters the civil status
of a person.

A woman who pretends to be pregnant and simulates a birth,
with no other purpose than to belie the reputation that she is sterile
but introduces no strange child in the family, and causes no child
to lose his civil status, and in fact occasions no damage, whether
immediate or remote, does not incur any criminal liability. (Albert)
The fact that the child will be benefited by the simulation of Its birth
Is not a defense.

Although the status acquired by the child through the simulation
of its birth may be better than its first legal status, the law, more than
the simulation of the civil status, punishes the offense as it creates a
false status to the detriment of the members of the family into which
the child is deceitfully introduced. (Viada, 3 Codigo Penal, 270-271)
Substituting one child for another.

This is committed when, for instance, X is born of A and B; Y
is born of C and D; and the offender, with intent to cause the loss of
any trace of their filiation, exchanges X and Y without the knowledge
of their respective parents.
The substitution may be effected by placing a live child of a
woman in place of a dead one of another woman.
Concealing or abandoning any legitimate child.

In the third way of committing the crime, three requisites must
be present, namely:
(1)

The child must be legitimate;

(2)

The offender conceals or abandons such child; and

(3)

The offender has the intent to cause such child to lose its
civil status.

The child must be legitimate and a fully developed and living
being, as the child born not capable of living has no status, nor can
he transmit any rights whatsoever. (U.S. v. Capillo, et al., 30 Phil355, citing Viada)
1214

TITLE TWELVE
Crimes Against the Civil Status of Persons

Art. 347

The unlawful sale of a child by its father, is not a crime under this

article.
Thus, a father who sold his child to a Chinese couple for money
consideration and agreed never to claim the child again is not liable
under this article. (U.S. v. Capillo, et al., 30 Phil. 349)
Note: The reason for this ruling is that there was no abandonment
of a child in the sense it should be understood in Article 347, that is,
leaving the child at a public place where other people may find it,
and causing the child to lose its civil status.
Meaning of "abandon” as used in Article 347.
The practice of abandoning newly bom infants and very young
children at the door of hospitals, churches and other religious
institutions was formerly so well known in Spain. It is in this sense
that the word “abandon* is used in Article 347.

Concealing a legitimate child must be for the purpose of causing
it to lose its civil status.
This is another way of committing the crime in the second

paragraph of Article 347. But the concealing of the legitimate child
must be with the intent to cause such child to lose its civil status.
He who places at the door of a charitable person a new-born child
which is in a condition to stand the first inclemencies of the weather
is supposed to do it in order that it may be taken up and protected
and, therefore, the legal presumption must be that he does not act
with any other purpose than to cause the loss of any trace as to the
filiation of the child. (U.S. v. Capillo, et al., 30 Phil. 354-355, citing
Groizard)

When is the abandonment of a minor a crime against security and
when is it a crime against the civil status of person?
The third form of committing this offense is by abandoning a
child. Under Article 276, a child is also abandoned.
But while in Article 276, the offender must be one who has the
custody of the child; in this article, the offender is any person.
As to the purpose of the offender, in Article 347, the purpose is
to cause the child to lose its civil status. In Article 276, the offender
has no such purpose. The purpose of the offender in Article 276 is to
avoid the obligation of rearing and caring for the child.
1215

Art 348

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

TITLE TWELVE
Crimes Against the Civil Status of Persons

Criminal Law

Problems:
1.

A woman who has given birth to a child, abandons the child
in a certain place, to free herself of the obligation and duty of
rearing and caring for the child. What crime is committed by
the woman? The crime is abandoning a minor under Article
276.

2.

3.

Suppose that the purpose of that woman in abandoning the
child is to preserve the inheritance of her child by a former
marriage, what then is the crime? Evidently, the purpose of
the woman is to cause the child to lose its civil status so that
it may not be able to share in the inheritance; hence, the crime
would fall under the second paragraph of Article 347.
Suppose a child, one day after its birth, was taken to, and left
in, the midst of a lonely forest, and it was found by a hunter
who took it home, what crime was committed by the person
who left it in the forest? It is attempted infanticide, as the
act of the offender is an attempt against its life. (See U.S. v.
Capillo, et al., 30 Phil. 349, citing Groizard)

Liability of physician or surgeon.

A physician or surgeon or public officer, who cooperates in the
execution of any of these crimes, is also liable if he acts in violation
of the duties of his profession or office. (Art. 347, par. 3)

—

Art. 348. Usurpation of civil status.
The penalty
of prision mayor3 shall be imposed upon any person who
shall usurp the civil status of another, should he do so for
the purpose of defrauding the offended party or his heirs;
otherwise, the penalty of prision correctional in its medium
and maximum periods4 shall be imposed.

Thus, where A impersonates himself to be C, the son of another,
and assumes the rights of C, the offender commits a violation of this

article.

Usurpation of profession may be punished under Article 348.

The term “civil status" includes one’s public station, or the
rights, duties, capacities and incapacities which determine a person
to a given class. (Black’s Law Dictionary, p. 1580) It seems that the
term “civil status’ includes one’s profession.
Thus, a person who, in the name of another, petitioned for
the issuance of a duplicate of the latter’s license as a professional,
assuming the latter’s person and profession, may be held liable for
usurpation of civil status.
There must be intent to enjoy the rights arising from the civil status
of another.

It is absolutely necessary, however, in order to constitute this
crime that the intent of the offender is to enjoy the rights arising from
the civil status of the person impersonated.
Otherwise, the case will be considered only as a violation of
Article 178 for assuming or using fictitious name, or as estafa under

Article 315. (Guevara)

The purpose of defrauding the offended party or his heirs qualifies
the crime.

The penalty is heavier when the purpose of the impersonation
is to defraud the offended party or his heirs.

Usurping the civil status of another is committed by assuming the
filiation, or the parental or conjugal rights of another.

This crime is committed when a person represents himself to be
another and assumes the filiation or the parental or conjugal rights
of such another person.

ILLEGAL MARRIAGES

—

Art. 349. Bigamy. The penalty of prision mayor1 shall
be imposed upon any person who shall contract a second
or subsequent marriage before the former marriage has
been legally dissolved, or before the absent spouse has
been declared presumptively dead by means of a judgment
rendered in the proper proceedings.

Elements:

1.

The offender has been legally married;

2.

The first marriage has not been legally dissolved, or in case
his or her spouse is absent, the absent spouse has not been
judicially declared presumptively dead;

Art. 349

of a marriage before contracting the second marriage. Article 40 of
the Family Code of the Philippines states that “The absolute nullity
of a previous marriage may be invoked for purposes of remarriage on
the basis solely of a final judgment declaring such previous marriage
void.” The Code Commission believes that the parties to a marriage
should not be allowed to assume that their marriage is void, even if
such is the fact, but must first secure a judicial declaration of nullity
of their marriage before they should be allowed to marry again. Thus,
in Wiegel v. Sempio-Diy, 143 SCRA 499, the Supreme Court held that
there is need of a judicial declaration of the fact that the marriage of
a person is void before that person can marry again; otherwise, the
second marriage will be void.
The subsequent judicial declaration of the nullity of the first
marriage was immaterial because prior to the declaration of nullity,
the crime had already been consummated. Moreover, petitioner’s
assertion would only delay the prosecution of bigamy cases considering
that an accused could simply file a petition to declare his previous
marriage void and invoke the pendency of that action as a prejudicial
question in the criminal case. [The] [Court] cannot allow that.
(Mercado v. Tan, G.R. No. 137110, August 1, 2000, 337 SCRA 122,
133)

3.

He contracts a subsequent marriage; and

Where there is no semblance of a valid marriage.

4.

The subsequent marriage would have been valid had it not
been for the existence of the first. (Marbella-Bobis v. Bobis,
G.R. No. 138509, July 31, 2000, 336 SCRA 747)

However, where no marriage ceremony at all was performed by
a duly authorized solemnizing officer and the parties merely signed a
marriage contract on their own, the Court held that the mere private
act of signing a marriage contract bears no semblance to a valid
marriage and thus, needs no judicial declaration of nullity. Such act
alone, without more, cannot be deemed to constitute an ostensibly
valid marriage for which petitioner might be held liable for bigamy
unless he first secures a judicial declaration of nullity before he
contracts a subsequent marriage. (Morigo v. People, GJi. No. 145226,
February 6, 2004)

The first marriage must be valid.
Under the Family Code of the Philippines, the parties cannot
presume their marriage to be void. A judicial declaration of nullity
of the first marriage is still required before one can legally contract
a second marriage.
Nullity of marriage, not a defense in bigamy charge.

It is now settled that the fact that the first marriage is void
from the beginning is not a defense in a bigamy charge. As with a
voidable marriage, there must be a judicial declaration of the nullity
1218

The difference between the Mercado and Morigo cases is that
in Mercado, the first marriage was actually solemnized while in
Morigo, there was no marriage at all. Thus, the requirement for
judicial declaration of nullity of marriage prior to contracting a second
marriage applies only to parties who contracted marriage which is
void ab initio due to the circumstances set forth in Articles 35 to 38 of
1219

Art. 349

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

the Family Code. If the parties did not contract marriage, then there
is no need for judicial declaration of nullity as there is no marriage
to declare void.
Void marriages.

The following marriages are void ab initio: (1) those contracted
by any party below 18 years of age even with the consent of parents or
guardians; (2) those solemnized by any person not legally authorized to

perform marriages unless such marriages were contracted with either
or both parties believing in good faith that the solemnizing officer had
the legal authority to do so; (3) those solemnized without a license,
except those of exceptional character, (4) bigamous or polygamous
marriages, not falling under Article 41; (5) those contracted through
mistake of one contracting party as to the identity of the other,
(6) those subsequent marriages that are void under Article 53; (7)
those contracted by any party who, at the time of the celebration,
was psychologically incapacitated to comply with the essential
marital obligations of marriage; (8) those between ascendants and
descendants of any degree; (9) those between brothers and sisters,
whether of the full or half blood; (10) those between collateral blood
relatives, whether legitimate or illegitimate, up to the fourth civil
decree; (11) those between stepparents and stepchildren; (12) those
between parents-in-law and children-in-law; (13) those between
the adopting parent and the adopted child; (14) those between the
surviving spouse of the adopting parent and the adopted child; (15)
those between the surviving spouse of the adopted child and the
adopter; (16) those between an adopted child and a legitimate child
of the adopter; those between adopted children of the same adopter;
and (17) those between parties where one, with the intention to marry
the other, killed the other’s spouse or his or her own spouse. (Arts.
35, 36, 37, and 38, Family Code of the Philippines)
Liability for bigamy, among legal consequences arising from a void
marriage.

Although the judicial declaration of the nullity of a marriage
on the ground of psychological incapacity retroacts to the date of
the celebration of the marriage insofar as the vinculum between the
spouses is concerned, it is significant to note that said marriage is not
without legal effects. Among these effects is that children conceived

Art. 349

or bom before the judgment of absolute nullity of the marriage shall
be considered legitimate. There is therefore a recognition written
into the law itself that such a marriage, although void ab initio, may
still produce legal consequences. Among these legal consequences
is incurring criminal liability for bigamy. To hold otherwise would
render the State’s penal laws on bigamy completely nugatory, and
allow individuals to deliberately ensure that each marital contract
be flawed in some manner, and to thus escape the consequences of
contracting multiple marriages, while beguiling throngs of hapless
women with the promise of futurity and commitment. (Tenebro v.
Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 150758, February 18, 2004)
Voidable marriages.

A marriage may be annulled for any of the following causes:

(1) that the party in whose behalf it is sought to have the

marriage

annulled was 18 years of age or over but below 21 and the marriage
was solemnized without the consent of the parents, guardian, or
person having substitute parental authority over the party, in that

order, unless after attaining the age of twenty-one, such party freely
cohabited with the other and both lived together as husband and wife;
(2) that either party was of unsound mind, unless such party,
after
coming to reason, freely cohabited with the other as husband and
wife; (3) that the consent of either party was obtained by fraud, unless
such party afterwards, with full knowledge of the facts constituting
the fraud, freely cohabited with the other as husband and wife; (4)
that the consent of either party was obtained by force, intimidation,
or undue influence, unless the same having disappeared or ceased,
such party thereafter freely cohabited with the other as husband and
wife; (5) that either party was physically incapable of consummating
the marriage with the other, and such incapacity continues and
appears to be incurable; (6) that either party was afflicted with a
sexually-transmissible disease found to be serious, and appears to be
incurable; and (7) that contracted by a person whose spouse has been
absent for four consecutive years, said person having a well-founded
belief that the absent spouse was already dead and after the latter
is declared presumptively dead in a summary proceeding. (Arts. 41
and 45, Family Code of the Philippines)

1221

Art. 349

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

“Before the former marriage has been legally dissolved.”
Note that what Article 349 punishes is the act of contracting a
second or subsequent marriage before the former marriage had been

dissolved.
The first marriage is, at its worst, merely voidable and not void.
(Arts. 85 and 86, New Civil Code) It is valid for all purposes until set

aside by a competent court. Even if the accused, as plaintiff in the
civil case, prevails therein and his first marriage is annulled, such
pronouncement has no retroactive effect as to exculpate said accused
in the bigamy case where the two marriages have been celebrated
previous to the filing of the complaint for annulment. “Parties to a
marriage should not be permitted to judge its nullity, only competent
courts having such authority. Prior to such declaration of nullity, the
validity of the first marriage is beyond question. A party who contracts
a second marriage then assumes the risk of being prosecuted for
bigamy.” (Landicho v. Relova, 22 SCRA 731, 735) The civil case for
annulment of the first marriage, therefore, does not pose a prejudicial
question as to warrant the suspension of the trial and proceedings
in the criminal case for bigamy. (Roco, et al. v. Cinco, et al., 68 O.G.
2952, citing People v. Aragon, 94 Phil. 357, 369)

The outcome of the civil case for annulment of petitioner’s
marriage to Narcisa had no bearing upon the determination of
petitioner’s innocence or guilt in the criminal case for bigamy, because
all that is required for the charge of bigamy to prosper is that the first
marriage be subsisting at the time the second marriage is contracted.
(Te v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 126746, November 29, 2000, 346
SCRA 327, 335;Abunado v. People, G.R. No. 159218, March 30, 2004)
Causes which may produce the legal dissolution of the first
marriage:
1.

Death of one of the contracting parties;

2.

Judicial declaration annulling a void marriage; and

3.

Judicial decree annulling a voidable marriage.

The death of the first spouse during the pendency of the bigamy
case does not extinguish the crime, because when the accused married
the second spouse, the first marriage was still subsisting. (People v.
Reyes, CA., 52 O.G. 1525)

TITLE TWELVE

Crimes Against the Civil Status of Persons

Art. 349

Effects of divorce granted by foreign courts.
If a spouse leaves the family domicile and goes to another state
for the sole purpose of obtaining a divorce, and with no intention of
remaining, his residence there is not sufficient to confer jurisdiction
on the court of that state. This is especially true where the cause
of divorce is one not recognized by the laws of the state of his own
domicile. (Ramirez v. Gmur, 42 Phil. 855)
This rule is applicable to those domiciled in the Philippines,
although they contracted marriage elsewhere. (Gorayeb v. Hashim
50 Phil. 22)

If the accused, in contracting the second marriage, acting on
the honest belief that he was lawfully divorced from his first wife,
he is liable for bigamy through reckless imprudence. (People v.
Schneckenburger, CA., G.R. No. 2457, August 31, 1938)
Note: In the case of People v. Bitdu, 58 Phil. 817, it was held
to be intentional bigamy. The reason for this ruling is that the legal
effect of divorce is a matter of law and everyone is presumed to know
the law.
Effect of divorce obtained abroad by alien spouse.

When a marriage between a Filipino citizen and a foreigner is
validly celebrated and a divorce is thereafter validly obtained abroad
by the alien spouse capacitating him or her to remarry, the Filipino
spouse shall likewise have capacity to remarry under Philippine law.
(Art. 26, par. 2, Family Code)
The twin elements for the application of Paragraph 2 of Article
26 of the Family Code are as follows:

1.

There is a valid marriage that has been celebrated between
a Filipino citizen and a foreigner; and

2.

A valid divorce is obtained abroad by the alien spouse
capacitating him or her to remarry.

The reckoning point is not the citizenship of the parties at the
time of the celebration of the marriage, but their citizenship at the time
a valid divorce is obtained abroad by the alien spouse capacitating
the latter to remarry.

In this case, when Cipriano’s wife was naturalized as an
American citizen, there was still a valid marriage that has been
celebrated between her and Cipriano. The naturalized alien wife
subsequently obtained a valid divorce capacitating her to remarry.
Clearly, the twin requisites for the application of Paragraph 2 of
Article 26 are both present in this case. Thus Cipriano, the “divorced”
Filipino spouse, should be allowed to remarry. (Republic v. Orbecido
III, G.R. No. 154380, October 5, 2005)
Defense has the burden of proof of dissolution of first marriage.
Once the prosecution has established that the defendant was
already married at the time he contracted the second marriage, the
burden of proof to show the dissolution of the first marriage is upon
the defense.

Crimes Against the Civil Status of Persons

Art. 349

One who contracted a subsequent marriage before the declaration
of presumptive death of the absent spouse is guilty of bigamy.

According to the accused, his wife whom he married in
November,
1944, disappeared and he did not know her whereabouts;
that earlier
in 1951, someone informed him that his wife had died; and that in
September of the same year, he married Eugenia Velarde.

Held: The accused committed the crime of bigamy. (People v.
Reyes, CA-G.R. No. 12107 R, June 30, 1955)

Note: For the present spouse to contract a subsequent marriage,
an absent spouse is presumed dead if he has been absent for four
consecutive years and the spouse present had a well-founded belief
that he is already dead. In case of disappearance where there is danger
of death, an absence of only two years will be sufficient. However, a
declaration of presumptive death should first be obtained from the
courts. (See Family Code of the Philippines)

Hence, it is the defense who must prove that the first wife had
died or that the marriage had been dissolved by lawful process before
the second marriage was contracted. (People v. Dungao, G.R. No.
34330, October 26, 1931)
When a person marries twice, the second marriage is presumed
valid and the former one is presumed to have been dissolved by death
or divorce. (Son Cui v. Guepangco, 22 Phil. 216; Sy Joe Lieng, etc. v.
Sy Quia, et al., 16 Phil. 137) But the presumption as to the dissolution
of the first marriage may yield to circumstances. In Rustia v. Ramos,
48 Phil. 292, in which the wife and her first husband were present
in court, when the case brought against her for the annulment of
her second marriage was being tried, and she, while testifying in
her behalf, did not claim that her first marriage had been dissolved
by divorce, the Supreme Court declined to apply the presumption of
dissolution to the first marriage and declared it to be existing at the
time of the second marriage. (Moran, Rules of Court, 1952 Ed., p. 502)

Thus, when the second marriage took place one day before the
issuance of the marriage license, such marriage is void ab initio under
Article 80(3) of the Civil Code (now Art. 4 of the Family Code). If the
second marriage is void, there is no bigamy. (People v. De Lara, CA.,
51 O.G. 4079)
If the second marriage of the accused is null and void according to

“Before the absent spouse has been declared presumptively dead.”

thereto, the accused is not liable for bigamy. (People v. Dumpo, 62
Phil. 246)

Under Article 41 of the Family Code, a summary proceeding for
the declaration of presumptive death of the absent spouse is required
before the surviving spouse can remarry.

However, in the case of Tenebro v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No.
150578, February 18, 2004, it was held that the nullity of the second

The second marriage must have all the essential requisites for

The second marriage, having all the essential requisites, would

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

TITLE TWELVE
Crimes Against the Civil Status of Persons

As a second or subsequent marriage contracted during
the subsistence of petitioner’s valid marriage to Villareyes,
petitioner’s marriage to Ancajas would be null and void ab initio
completely regardless of petitioner’s psychological capacity or
incapacity. Since a marriage contracted during the subsistence of
a valid marriage is automatically void, the nullity of this second
marriage is not per se an argument for the avoidance of criminal
liability for bigamy. Pertinently, Article 349 of the Revised
Penal Code criminalizes any person who shall contract a second
or subsequent marriage before the former marriage has been
legally dissolved, or before the absent spouse has been declared
presumptively dead by means of a judgment rendered in the
proper proceedings. A plain reading of the law, therefore, would
indicate that the provision penalizes the mere act of contracting a
second or a subsequent marriage during the subsistence of a valid
marriage.

Under Article 349 of the R.P.C., the essential elements of
the
crime of bigamy are:

Art. 349

Thus, as soon as the second marriage to Ancajas was
celebrated on April 10, 1990, during the subsistence of the
valid first marriage, the crime of bigamy had already been
consummated. To our mind, there is no cogent reason for
distinguishing between a subsequent marriage that is null and
void purely because it is a second or subsequent marriage, and
a subsequent marriage that is null and void on the ground of
psychological incapacity, at least insofar as criminal liability for
bigamy is concerned, x x x.

With all due respect, the Tenebro ruling appears to have
disregarded the fourth element of bigamy, i.e., that the second or
subsequent marriage has all the essential requisites for validity.
In the Dissenting Opinion of Justice Carpio in the Tenebro case,
he stated:
These decisions of the Court declaring there is no crime of
bigamy if the second marriage is void on grounds other than the
existence of the first marriage merely apply the clear language
and intent of Article 349 of the R.P.C. This Article provides as
follows:

—

Article 349. Bigamy. The penalty of prision mayor
shall be imposed upon any person who shall contract a second
or subsequent marriage before the former marriage has been
legally dissolved, or before the absent spouse has been declared
presumptively dead by means ofjudgment rendered in the proper
proceedings.
1226

1.

The offender is legally married;

2.

The marriage is not legally dissolved;

Art. 349

The offender contracts a second or subsequent marriage;
The second or subsequent marriage is valid except for the
4.
existence of the first marriage.
The first three elements reiterate the language of the law.
The last element, the validity of the second marriage except
for the existence of the first marriage, necessarily follows from
the language of the law that the offender contracts a second or
3.

subsequent marriage.

If the second marriage is void ab initio on grounds other
than the existence of the first marriage, then legally there exists
no second marriage. Article 36 of the Family Code enumerates
the marriages that are void from the beginning. The succeeding
article, Article 36, declares that a marriage contracted by one
psychologically incapacitated shall likewise be void. Article 1409
of the Civil Code declares inexistent and void from the beginning
contracts expressly x x x declared void by law. Thus, a marriage
contracted by one psychologically incapacitated at the time of the
marriage is legally inexistent and void from the beginning. Such
void marriage cannot constitute a second marriage to sustain a
conviction for bigamy under Article 349 of the R.P.C.
If the second marriage is void solely because of the existence
of the first marriage, the nullity of the second marriage proceeds
from its illegality or bigamous nature. However, if the second
marriage is void on grounds other than the existence of the
first marriage, the nullity does not proceed from its illegality or
bigamous nature. The first situation results in the crime of bigamy
while the second does not. This is clear from Article 1411 of the
Civil Code which provides:

Article 1411. When the nullity proceeds from
the illegality of the cause or object of the contract, and
the act constitutes a criminal act, both parties being
in pari delicto, they shall have no action against each
other, and both shall be prosecuted, x x x.
The rule shall be applicable when only one of
the parties is guilty; x x x.

1227

Art. 349

TITLE TWELVE
Crimes Against the Civil Status of Persons

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Thus, if the second marriage is void because of psychological
incapacity, the nullity does not proceed from an illegal or criminal
cause, and no prosecution could ensue. However, if the second
marriage is void solely because of the existence of the first
marriage, the nullity proceeds from an illegal or criminal cause,
and thus prosecution should follow.

The plain and ordinary meaning of Article 349 could only
be that the second marriage must be valid were it not for the
existence of the first marriage. This has been the consistent
interpretation of the Court for more than seven decades since the
enactment of the R.P.C. Text writers in criminal law have never
entertained or advanced any other interpretation. There is no
cogent reason to depart from the well-established jurisprudence
on Article 349 of the R.P.C.

Even assuming, for the sake of argument, there is doubt on
the interpretation of Article 349, substantive due process of law
requires a strict interpretation of Article 349 against the State
and a liberal interpretation in favor of the accused. The majority
opinion reverses this principle and interprets Article 349 of the
R.P.C. strictly against the accused and liberally in favor of the
State.
Article 349 of the R.P.C. does not state that it is immaterial
whether the second marriage is valid or void ab initio. This Article
does not also state that the mere act of celebration of the second
marriage, while the first marriage subsists, constitutes the crime
of bigamy. Article 349 speaks of a second or subsequent marriage
which, as commonly understood and applied consistently by the
Court, means a valid second marriage were it not for the existence
of the first marriage.

To hold that the validity of the second marriage is
immaterial, as the majority opinion so holds, would interpret
Article 349 too liberally in favor of the State and too strictly
against the accused. This violates the well-settled principle of
statutory construction.

Validity of second marriage is a prejudicial question to liability for
bigamy.

In order that petitioner may be held guilty of the crime of
bigamy, the marriage which he contracted for the second time with
Elizabeth Caesar must first be declared valid. But its validity had

been questioned in the civil action. This civil action must be decided

before the prosecution for bigamy can proceed. (Merced v. Hon. Diez,
et al., 109 Phil. 155)
Judgment of annulment precludes verdict of guilt in charge of

bigamy.

Petitioner was charged with bigamy, but she filed an action to

annul her second marriage on the ground of duress. After a finding
that there was no collusion, the second marriage was annulled by
a judgment that became final. The trial court denied her motion to
dismiss the bigamy case, on the ground that the parties and the issues
in the two cases are not the same. On certiorari and prohibition, the
fiscal contended that the annulment decision should only be a defense
at the trial.
Held: The judgment of annulment is determinative of petitioner’s
innocence and precludes a verdict that she committed bigamy. To try
the criminal case in the face of such judgment would be unwarranted.
Even if the judgment is erroneous, it is not a void judgment. (De la
Cruz v. Ejercito, 61 SCRA 1)
The second spouse is not necessarily liable for bigamy.

Appellant’s contention that the crime of bigamy entails the joint
liability of two persons who marry each other, while the previous
marriage of one is valid and subsisting, is completely devoid of merit.
Even a cursory scrutiny of Article 349 of the R.P.C. will disclose that
the crime of bigamy can be committed by one person who contracts
a subsequent marriage while the former marriage is valid and
subsisting, x x x Whether the second spouse should be included in
the information is a question of fact that was determined by the fiscal
who conducted the preliminary investigation in this case. (People v.
Nepomuceno, Jr., 64 SCRA 518)

The second husband or wife who knew of first marriage Is an
accomplice.
A person, whether man or woman, who knowingly consents or
agrees to be married to another already bound in lawful wedlock is
guilty as an accomplice in the crime of bigamy. (Viada, 3 Codigo Penal

404)

Bigamy is not a private crime.

In the crime of bigamy, it is immaterial whether it is the first or
the second wife who initiates the action, for it is a public offense which
can be denounced not only by the person affected thereby but even
by a civic-spirited citizen who may come to know the same. (People
v. Belen, CA., 45 O.G., Supp. 5, 88)
And the fact that the second wife was aware of the defendant’s
first marriage when the second marriage was solemnized, will not
afford defendant relief. This is an offense against the State, not
against the second wife. (People v. Concepcion, CA., 40 O.G. 2878)
A person convicted of bigamy may still be prosecuted for
concubinage.
They are two distinct offenses in law and in fact, as well as in the
mode of their prosecution. The first is an offense against civil status
which may be prosecuted at the instance of the State; the second, an
offense against chastity and may be prosecuted only at the instance
of the offended party. The celebration of the second marriage, with
the first still existing, characterizes the crime of bigamy; on the other
hand, the mere cohabitation by the husband with a woman who is
not his wife characterizes the crime of concubinage.

The offender under Article 352 must be authorized to solemnize
marriages.

Article 352 presupposes that the priest or minister or civil
authority is authorized to solemnize marriages. If the accused is not
authorized to solemnize marriage and he performs an illegal marriage
ceremony, he is liable under Article 177.
The offender is punished under the Marriage Law.
The penalty is imprisonment for not less than one month nor
more than two years, or a fine not less than P200.00 nor more than

What constitutes a marriage ceremony.

Facts: On the day of the scheduled wedding of a couple at a
Catholic church, the supposed officiating priest refused to solemnize
the marriage upon learning that the couple failed to secure a marriage
license. As a recourse, the couple, who were already dressed for their
wedding, proceeded to the Aglipayan Church where they requested
the accused, an Aglipayan priest, to perform a ceremony to which
the latter agreed despite having been informed by the couple that
they had no marriage certificate. The accused prepared his choir
and scheduled a mass for the couple. He conducted the ceremony in
the presence of the groom, the bride, their parents, the principal and
secondary sponsors and the rest of their invited guests. An information
for Illegal Marriage Ceremony was filed against the accused.
Held: The accused admitted that he has authority to solemnize a
marriage. Hence, the only issue to be resolved is whether the alleged
“blessing” by the petitioner is tantamount to the performance of an
“illegal marriage ceremony.”

TITLE TWELVE

Crimes Against the Civil Status of Persons

Art. 352

and 6 of the Family Code are clear on these matters. Article 6 of the
Family Code provides that “[n]o prescribed form or religious rite for
the solemnization of the marriage is required. It shall be necessary,
however, for the contracting parties to appear personally before the
solemnizing officer and declare in the presence of not less than two
witnesses of legal age that they take each other as husband and wife.”
Pertinently, Article 3(3) mirrors Article 6 of the Family Code and
particularly defines a marriage ceremony as that which takes place
with the appearance of the contracting parties before the solemnizing
officer and their personal declaration that they take each other as
husband and wife in the presence of not less than two witnesses of
legal age.
The law sets the minimum requirements constituting a marriage
ceremony: first, there should be the personal appearance of the
contracting parties before a solemnizing officer; and second, their
declaration in the presence of not less than two witnesses that they
take each other as husband and wife. As to the first requirement,
the petitioner admitted that the parties appeared before him and
this fact was testified to by witnesses. On the second requirement,
we find that, contrary to the petitioner’s allegation, the prosecution
has proven that the contracting parties personally declared that they
take each other as husband and wife.

From these perspectives, we find it clear that what the petitioner
conducted was a marriage ceremony. (Ronulo v. People, GJi. No.
182438, July 2, 2014)
A clergyman who performed a marriage ceremony, not knowing that
one of the contracting parties is a minor, is not liable.

While Article 352 does not specifically define a “marriage
ceremony” and what constitutes its “illegal” performance, Articles 3(3)

Appeal from a judgment convicting the accused of performing a
marriage ceremony where one of the contracting parties was under the
age of consent. It having been held in the case of U.S. v. Penalosa,1
Phil. 109, that neither of the spouses can be convicted for a violation of
Article 475 of the old Penal Code (corresponding to Article 350 of the
RP.C.), if he or she acted in good faith and without the knowledge that
the other was under the age of consent, the question arises whether
the person solemnizing the marriage may plead similar good faith in
defense to an action brought against them.

Held: If a man, desiring to marry a woman, may be excused

parties, would be in a far better position to invoke the protection of
the principle than would the husband. (U.S. v. San. Juan, 25 Phil.

Defamation.
Defamation, which includes libel and slander, means the offense
of injuring a person’s character, fame or reputation through false and
malicious statements. It is that which tends to injure reputation or to
diminish the esteem, respect, good will or confidence in the plaintiff
or to excite derogatory feelings or opinions about the plaintiff. It is
the publication of anything which is injurious to the good name or
reputation of another or tends to bring him into disrepute. Defamation
is an invasion of a relational interest since it involves the opinion which
others in the community may have, or tend to have, of the plaintiff.

of civilization. The law recognizes the value of such reputation and
imposes upon him who attacks it, by slanderous words or libelous
publications, the liability to make full compensation for the damages
done. (Worcester v. Ocampo, 22 Phil. 42)
If prosecuted for and found guilty of the crime of libel, he may
suffer imprisonment or be required to pay a fine, or both.
Elements of defamation:
1. That there must be an imputation of a crime, or of a vice
or defect, real or imaginary, or any act, omission, status or

circumstance.

2.

That the imputation must be made publicly.

Defamation is the proper term for libel as used in Article 353.

3.

That it must be malicious.

The Spanish text used the term “defamacion” which is translated
as “libel” in the English text.

4.

That the imputation must be directed to a natural or juridical
person, or one who is dead.

“Libel” is a defamation committed by means of writing, printing,
lithography, engraving, radio, phonograph, painting or theatrical or
cinematographic exhibition, or any similar means. (Art. 335) Oral
defamation is called slander.

5.

That the imputation must tend to cause the dishonor, discredit
or contempt of the person defamed.

There must be a defamatory imputation.

No distinction between calumny, insult and libel.

The imputation may cover:

The R.P.C. punishes all kinds of attack against honor and
reputation, thereby eliminating once and for all the idle distinction
between calumny and insult, under the old Penal Code, and libel
under Act No. 227. (People v. Del Rosario, et al., 86 Phil. 163)

a.

Crime allegedly committed by the offended party;

b.

Vice or defect, real or imaginary of the offended party; or

c.

Any act, omission, condition, status of, or circumstance
relating to the offended party.

Seditious libel is punished, not in this Chapter, but in Article 142.
Thus, a person who, feigning suicide, writes a supposed suicide
note calling the government as one of crooks and dishonest persons
infested with Nazis and Fascists, commits seditious libel. (Espuelas
v. People, G.R. No. L-2290, December 17, 1952)

Reason why defamation is punished.

The enjoyment of a private reputation is as much a constitutional
right as the possession of life, liberty, or property. It is one of those
rights necessary to human society that underlie the whole scheme
1238

Test of defamatory character of the words used.

In determining whether a statement is defamatory, the words
used are construed in their entirety and taken in their plain, natural
and ordinary meaning as they would naturally be understood by
persons reading them, unless it appears that they were used and
understood in another sense. (Novicio v. Aggabao, 463 Phil. 510, 516

[2003])

Words calculated to induce suspicion are sometimes more

effective to destroy reputation that false charges directly made.
1239

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

TITLE THIRTEEN
Crimes Against Honor

Ironical and metaphorical language is a favored vehicle for slander.
A charge is sufficient if the words are calculated to induce the hearers
to suppose and understand that the person against whom they were
uttered was guilty of certain offenses, or are sufficient to impeach
the honesty, virtue or reputation, or to hold him up to public ridicule.
(U.S. v. O’Connell, 37 Phil. 767)

FIRST ELEMENT: THERE MUST BE AN IMPUTATION OF A CRIME,

Art. 353

The meaning of the writer is immaterial.

The alleged libelous article must be construed as a whole.

(Jimenez v. Reyes, 27 Phil. 52; U.S. v. O’Connell, 37 Phil. 767; U.S.

v. Sotto, 38 Phil. 666) In other words, the article must be construed
in its entirety including the headline, as they may enlarge, explain,
or restrict, or be enlarged, explained or strengthened or restricted
by the context. Whether it is libelous depends upon the scope, spirit,
and motive of the publication taken in its entirety. (Imperial, et al. v.

The Manila Publishing Co., Inc., et al., 13 CA. Rep. 990, citing Wiley
v. Oklahoma Press Pub. Co., 106 Okla. 52; 233 PW. 244; 40 ALR 573;
Wing v. Wing, 66 Mo. 62, 22 Am. Rep. 481; Dorr v. Lopez, 51 O.G.
1326)

In applying these rules to the language of an alleged libel, the
court will disregard any subtle or ingenious explanation offered by
the publisher on being called to account. The whole question being
the effect the publication held upon the minds of the readers, and
they not having been assisted by the offered explanation in reading
the article, it comes too later to have the effect of removing the sting,
if any there be, from the word used in the publication. (U.S. v. Sotto,
38 Phil. 666)
Where the comments are insincere and intended to ridicule
rather than praise the plaintiff, the publication is libelous. Praise
undeserved is slander in disguise. (Jimenez y. Reyes, 27 Phil. 52)

Publication, even if intended for humor, may be libelous when
the language used passed from the bounds of playful jest and intensive
criticism into the region of scurrilous calumniation and intemperate
personalities. (Oliver, et al. v. “La Vanguardia, Inc.,” 48 Phil. 429)

OR OF A VICE OR DEFECT, OR ANY ACT, OMISSION, CONDITION,
STATUS OR CIRCUMSTANCE
(a)

IMPUTATION OF A CRIMINAL ACT

An article which portrays the offended party as a swindler
who, prior to his election as municipal president, collected money
from several inhabitants of the town through fraud and deceit and
constructed a house worth P40,000 with the money so collected,
imputes the commission of the crime of estafa to the offended party.
(People v. Bailo, et al., CA., 37 O.G. 2373)
Branding somebody as having murdered his brother-in-law,
enriching himself at the expense of others who trusted him, calling
one a bigamist and becoming rich overnight through questionable
transactions and influence peddling, winning in an election through
mass fraud and rampant vote-buying because of the influence of
brother-in-law are obviously libelous and slanderous for they are
malicious imputations of criminal acts tending to cause dishonor,
discredit and contempt of the complainant, punishable under the
provisions of Article 353 of the R.P.C. (People v. Dianalan, 13 CA.
Rep. 34)

Imputation of a crime may be implied from the acts and statements
of the accused.

The belief of petitioner is patently unmeritorious. While it is

true that she did not directly call LT a thief, the implication of her

acts and statements are clearly to that effect. She confronted the
complainant regarding the loss of her money, telling LT that she
was the only one who approached her table and that as soon as the
complainant left, the money had disappeared. She even remarked,
“who knows?” when complainant vehemently denied having taken
the money. Furthermore, she intimated that complainant should
allow herself to be searched. All these statements were made in a
loud voice in the presence of many persons subjecting offended party
to embarrassment and ridicule before other bank employees. These
acts likewise unravel the existence of malice in fact. Otherwise,
the inquiry should have been done discreetly and not in the form of
imputations within the hearing of other employees. (De Guzman v.
People and Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L 19075, November 23, 1966)
1241

Art 353

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Imputation of criminal intention not libelous.

Such imputation is not libelous, because intent to commit a
crime is not a violation of the law. This is more so, when it is a mere
assertion or expression of opinion as to what will be the future conduct
of another. (People v. Baja, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 5, 206)
An expression of opinion by one affected by the act of another and
based on actual fact is not libelous.

An expression of opinion, such as, that a person is unfair or
partial in the distribution of her property, where it appears that the
wife of the defendant has been deprived of her share, is not libelous.
(People v. Baja, CA., 40 O.G., Supp. 5, 206)

But in order to escape criminal responsibility for libel or slander,
it is not enough for the party who writes a defamatory communication
to another to say that he (the writer) expresses therein no more
than his opinion or belief. The communication must be made in the
performance of a “legal, moral, or social duty.” Defendant had no such
“legal, moral, or social duty” to convey his opinion or belief about,
complainant’s moral fiber, to the Director of Printing or the Secretary
of General Services. (Orfanel v. People, 30 SCRA 819-820)
(b) IMPUTATION OF A VICE OR DEFECT

When a person, in an article, imputes upon the persons
mentioned therein, lascivious and immoral habits, that article is of a
libelous nature as it tends to discredit the person libeled in the minds
of those reading the said article. (People v. Suarez, G.R. No. 35396,
April 11, 1932)
(c)

IMPUTATION OF AN ACT OR OMISSION

An article signed by the accused and published in the Philippine
Herald says that the offended party used to borrow money without
intention to pay; that he had ordered the fixing of his teeth without
paying the fees for the services rendered by the dentist, etc. contains
an imputation of an act and omission which is defamatory. (People v.

TITLE THIRTEEN

Crimes Against Honor
(d)

IMPUTATION OF CONDITION, STATUS, OR
CIRCUMSTANCE
Calling a person a bastard or leper within the hearing of other

persons is defamatory, because there is an imputation of a condition
or status which tends to cause dishonor or contempt of the offender
party.

Thus, the accused was declared guilty of the crime of libel for
writing and publishing an article containing the words“coward, vile
soul, dirty sucker, savage, hog who always looks toward the ground"
which refer to the offended party, thereby exposing the latter to public

contempt and ridicule. (U.S. v. Ortiz, et al., 8 Phil. 752)

A letter addressed to a lawyer was found libelous for using
words such as “lousy,” “inutile,” “carabao English," “stupidity,” and
“satan.” It casts aspersion on the character, integrity and reputation
of respondent as a lawyer and exposed him to public ridicule. (Buatis,
Jr. v. People, G.R. No. 142509, March 24, 2006)
The word “mangkukulam" is undoubtedly an epithet of
opprobrium. To say that complainant is a witch and sorceress is to
impute to her a vice, condition or status that is dishonorable and
contemptible, since it accuses her of having employed the black art;
of possessing supernatural power by reason of a covenant with evil
spirits; and of having trafficked with the devil. The attribution to
her of the death of three persons is an imputation of a crime. (People
u. Carmen Sario, G.R. No. L-20754 and G.R. No. L-20753, June 30,

1966)

SECOND ELEMENT: THE IMPUTATION MUST BE MADE PUBLICLY

Meaning of publication.

Publication in libel means making the defamatory matter, after
it has been written, known to someone other than the person to whom
it has been written. (Novicio v. Aggabao, 463 Phil. 510, 517 [2003])

Tolentino, CA., 37 O.G. 1763)

Publication of the defamatory imputation.
One of the typesetters of the paper testified that the defendant
handed to him, to be set in type, the article in question, and that the
manuscript thus delivered was in the handwriting of the defendant.
Held: Delivering the article to the typesetter is sufficient
publication. (U.S. v. Crame, 10 Phil. 135)
Sending to the wife, a letter defamatory of her husband, is

sufficient publication. (U.S. v. Ubnana, 1 Phil. 471) Writing a letter
to another person other than the person defamed is sufficient to
constitute publication, for the person to whom the letter is addressed
is a third person in relation to its writer and the person defamed
therein. (Orfanel v. People, 30 SCRA 819)

Note: The person defamed is the husband, and the wife is the
third person to whom publication is made.
Sending a letter in a sealed envelope through a messenger, is
not publication. (Lopez v. Delgado, 8 Phil. 26)
There is publication of defamatory letter not shown to be
sealed when sent to the addressee.
The accused signed and sent a letter to the offended party
charging the latter with having illicit relations with her husband.
There being no evidence that the letter was sealed, there is publication.

If sending a letter “not shown to be sealed” is publication, sending
of an “unsealed letter” should a fortiori be held to be publication. (U.S.
v. Grino, 36 Phil. 738; People v. Silvela, 103 Phil. 773)
There is no crime if the defamatory imputation is not published.

The law permits us to think as badly as we please of our
neighbors so long as we keep our uncharitable thoughts to ourselves.

Art. 353

THIRD ELEMENT: THE PUBLICATION MUST BE MALICIOUS
There must be malice.

—

The malice or ill-will must be proved malice in fact; or may be
taken for granted in view of the grossness of the imputation malice
in law. (People v. Andrada, C.A., 37 O.G. 1783)
Malice is a term used to indicate the fact that the offender is
prompted by personal ill-will or spite and speaks not in response to
duty, but merely to iiyure the reputation of the person defamed. (U.S.
v. Canete, 38 Phil. 253)

—

—

Malice in fact. may be shown by proof of ill-will, hatred
or purpose to injure. Thus, a republication of defamatory matter
subsequent to the commencement of an action based thereon is
inadmissible to establish malice in fact. (U.S. v. Montalvo, 29 Phil

595)

There is “actual malice” or malice in fact when the offender
makes the defamatory statement with the knowledge that it is false
or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not. The reckless
disregard standard used here requires a high degree of awareness
of probable falsity. There must be sufficient evidence to permit the
conclusion that the accused in fact entertained serious doubts as
to the truth of the statement he published. Gross or even extreme
negligence is not sufficient to establish actual malice. (Disini v. The
Secretary of Justice, 727 Phil. 28, 113 [2014])

There is express malice or “malice in fact,” because it clearly
appears that the accused Topacio was actuated by a desire to
impeach the reputation, integrity and honesty of Secretary Perez as
a government official and to force him to resign because of the alleged
misfeasance and malfeasance in office. (People u. Topacio, et al., 59
Phil. 356)
Malice in law.

— is presumed from a defamatory imputation.

So, merely composing a libel is not actionable unless it be published.
The communication of libelous matter to the person defamed alone
does not amount to publication, for that cannot injure his reputation.
A man’s reputation is the estimate in which others hold him; not the
good opinion which he has of himself. (People v. Atencio, supra)

Proof of malice is not required, because it is presumed to exist from
the defamatory imputation. (Art. 354, 1st paragraph)
But where the communication is privileged, malice is not

1244

1245

presumed from the defamatory words. The presumption of malice does
not arise in the two cases of privileged communication mentioned in
paragraph Nos. 1 and 2 of Article 354. The plaintiff or the prosecution

Art. 353

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

must prove malice in fact, whenever the defamatory imputation
appears in a privileged communication. (U.S. v. Bustos, 37 Phil. 731)
Malice in law is not necessarily inconsistent with an honest or
even laudable purpose. For that reason, even if the publication is
injurious, the presumption of malice disappears upon proof of good
intention and justifiable motive.
But where the malice in fact is present, justifiable motive cannot
exist, and the imputations become actionable. (People v. Pelegrino, 11
CA. Rep. 803, citing U.S. v. Bustos, 13 Phil. 600; Liu Ching Shing,
et al. v. Lu Tiong Ciu, 76 Phil. 609)

There is no libel in interchange of captions of pictures made
by mistake, because malice is absent.
The group picture of six well-dressed men including the plaintiff
appeared in a three-column photo published in The Manila Times
carrying a caption on the arrest by Customs authorities of six persons
for alleged “illegal salvaging” of sunken bombs and other missiles;
so also was the picture of the arrested persons bearing the caption
intended for the photo which included plaintiff. These pictures and
the captions were interchanged.

The error was discovered only after copies of the first edition
of The Manila Times had already been printed and shipped to the
defendants’ agents. Correction, however, was immediately made on
the subsequent copies of the issue of the same date and of subsequent
issues of the paper of different dates.
Held: The interchange of captions was all mistake, an honest
mistake, and there was neither intent nor malice on the part of the
defendants to ridicule or put the plaintiff in public contempt. (Solidum
v. Roces, et al., 18 CA. Rep. 465)

But in Lopez v. Court of Appeals, 34 SCRA 116, where the
photograph of the person who was given the appellation of “Hoax of
the Year” and the photograph of plaintiff in the civil case for damages
were inadvertently switched, the publisher and the editor of This
Week Magazine were held liable for damages.
Dissenting: There is need to prove that the publication was made
with actual malice
that is, with knowledge of its falsity or with
reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.

TITLE THIRTEEN

Crimes Against Honor

Art. 353

FOURTH ELEMENT: THE IMPUTATION MUST BE DIRECTED AT A
NATURAL OR JURIDICAL PERSON, OR ONE WHO IS DEAD
Identification of the offended party is required.
It is not sufficient that the offended party recognized himself
as the person attacked or defamed; it must be shown that at least a
third person could identify him as the object of the libelous publication.
(Kunkle v. Cablenews-American, 42 Phil. 757)
When the obnoxious writing does not mention the libeled party
by name, the prosecution is permitted to prove by evidence that the
vague imputation refers to the complainant. (People v. Silvela, 103
Phil. 773)

In order to maintain a libel suit, it is essential that the victim be
identifiable, although it is not necessary that he be named. It is enough
if by intrinsic reference, the allusion is apparent or if the publication
contains matters of description or reference to facts and circumstances
from which others reading the article may know the plaintiff was
intended, or if he is pointed out by extraneous circumstances so that
person knowing him could and did understand that he was the person
referred to. (Corpus v. Cuaderno, Sr., 16 SCRA 807)
Where the article is impersonal on its face and interpretation
of its language does not single out individuals, the fourth essential
requisite of the offense of libel does not exist. (People v. Andrada, CA.,
37 O.G. 92; Uy Tioco, et al. v. Yang Shu Wen, et al., 32 Phil. 624)

Illustration:
An article in the Cable news-American described a Chinese
society, whose aim was to induce a boycott by the Chinese of Japanese
goods, as having offered PIO,000 in a secret meeting for the life of
the Chinese consul-general. The two plaintiffs were president and
treasurer, respectively, of a Chinese society organized for the purpose
of promoting a boycott of Japanese goods. The plaintiffs claimed that
they were libeled by the writer of the article.

Held: Defamatory imputations directed at a class or group
of persons in general language are not actionable by individuals
composing the class or group unless the statements are sweeping;
and it is very probable that even then, no action would lie where the
body is composed of so large a number of persons that there is room
1247

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Crimes Against Honor

for persons connected with the body to pursue an upright and lawabiding course. (Uy Tioco, et al. v. Yang Shu Wen, et al., supra)

Held: The two publications were considered together to establish
the identity of the offended party. (U.S. v. Sotto, 36 Phil. 389)

But the publication need not refer by name to the offended party.
It is sufficient if it is shown that the offended party is the person
meant or alluded to therein. (Causin v. Jakosalem, 5 Phil. 155)

Innuendo.

Art. 353

TITLE THIRTEEN

Defamatory remarks directed at a group of persons is not
actionable unless the statements are all-embracing or
sufficiently specific for the victim to be identifiable.

Where the defamation is alleged to have been directed at a group
or class, it is essential that the statement must be so sweeping or
all-embracing as to apply to every individual in that group or class,
or sufficiently specific so that each individual in that class or group
can prove that the defamatory statement specifically pointed to him,
so that he can bring the action separately, if need be. (Newsweek, Inc.
v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 142 SCRA 171)

An individual Muslim has a reputation that is personal,
separate and distinct in the community. Each Muslim, as part of
the larger Muslim community in the Philippines of over five million
people, belongs to a different trade and profession; each has a
varying interest and a divergent political and religious view some
may be conservative, others liberal. A Muslim may find the article
dishonorable, even blasphemous; others may find it as an opportunity
to strengthen their faith and educate the non-believers and the
“infidels.” There is no injury to the reputation of the individual
Muslims who constitute this community that can give rise to an
action for group libel. Each reputation is personal in character to
every person. Together, the Muslims do not have a single common
reputation that will give them a common or general interest in the
subject matter of the controversy. (MVRS Publications, Inc., et al. v.
Islamic Da’wah Council of the Phils., Inc., 444 Phil. 230 [2003])

—

Libel published in different parts may be taken together to
establish the identification of the offended party.
The first publication mentions no names. It employs, however,
certain words and phrases which are defamatory. The second
publication consists of a cartoon in which the persons referred to in
the first publication are caricatured by name and to each one of them
is attached one of the defamatory words or phrases.
1248

Art. 353

It is a clause in the indictment or other pleading containing an

averment which is explanatory of some preceding word or statement.

It is the office of an innuendo to define the defamatory meaning which
the plaintiff set on the words, to show how they came to have that
meaning, and also to show how they relate to the plaintiff. (Bouvier’s,
Vol. I, 1048)
Purpose must be to injure the reputation of the offended party.

In the prosecution for libel, it is essential that the intention
of the offender in publishing the libelous matter was to discredit or
dishonor the person allegedly libeled.
“Lo quo hace el delito no es solamente la materia sino la actitud
del agente.”

If the matter charged as libelous is only an incident in an act
which has another objective, the crime is not libel. (People v. Velasco,
G.R. No. 43186, CA., February 19, 1937)
Thus, if the chief of police in good faith filed a complaint against
X for illegal possession of paraphernalia for falsification, and after
trial X was acquitted, the chief of police is not liable for libel, because
the imputation of a crime was merely an incident in the making of
the complaint intended to cause the punishment of a violation of the
law.

FIFTH ELEMENT: THE IMPUTATION MUST TEND TO CAUSE
DISHONOR, DISCREDIT OR CONTEMPT OF THE OFFENDED PARTY
Any imputation will be sufficient if it tends to cause
(1) the dishonor,
(2) discredit, or
(3) contempt of a natural or juridical person, or
(4) to blacken the memory of one who is dead.

People v. Aquino
(35 O.G. 8844)

Facts: Corazon Aquino was accused before the Court of First

Instance of Pangasinan, of the crime of grave oral defamation for
having allegedly uttered in public words to this effect: “You, Merrera
lawyers, are stealers xx x shameless xxx impolite.”
Held: At common law, “a libel on two or more persons contained
in one writing and published by a single act constitutes but one offense
so as to warrant a single indictment therefor” (State v. Hoskins, 60
Minn. 168), this for the reason that “the law makes the publication

of libel punishable as a crime, not because of injury to the reputation
but because the publication of such articles tends to affect injuriously
the peace and good order of society.”
The Solicitor General, however, cites the case of People v. Del
Rosario, et al. (G.R. No. L-2254, promulgated April 20, 1950), where
this Court upheld the theory that a “libelous publication affecting
more than one person constitutes one crime or more.” That decision,
it is to be noted, was predicated on the ruling laid down in the case
of People v. Luz Jose, G.R. No. L-50, promulgated April 20, 1946, to
the effect that libel or defamation of the nature of that committed
in the present cases
cannot be prosecuted de oficio but only at
the instance of the offended party or parties, from which th[e] Court
deduced the conclusion that in libel or defamation of that kind, the
policy of the law is to redress the injury to the individual rather than
the injury to the peace and good order of society. But that conclusion is
now without basis, for the said case of People u. Luz Jose has already
been overruled by the more recent cases of People v. Juan B. Santos,
et al. (G.R. Nos. L-7316 and L-7317, promulgated December 19, 1955)

—

1250

Art. 353

In line with this later decision, [the Court] ha[s] to hold that the
utterance of the defamatory statement complained of in the present
case should be regarded as only one offense and made the subject
of only one information, the utterance having been made but once
and referring apparently to a family of lawyers designated by their
common surname but not separately mentioned.
Decision in People v. Del Rosario is controlling.
Where the alleged slanderous utterances were committed on the
same date and at the same place, but against two different persons,
the situation has given rise to two separate and individual causes
for prosecution, with respect to each of the persons defamed and as
such, it was error for the trial court to dismiss one of the information
pertaining to one of the persons defamed and to treat the offenses
charged in one information to avoid, in the opinion of the lower court,
multiplicity of prosecutions.
[The] [Court] agree[s] with the prosecution that our decision in
People v. Del Rosario (86 Phil. 163) for libel is controlling. As in said
case, there are in the case before us, as many offenses as there were
persons defamed. (People v. Gil, et al., G.R. No. L-20398, October 31,

1968)

CybER LibEL

Section 6 of R.A. No. 10175, the Cybercrime Prevention Act of
2012, provides:
Sec. 6. All crimes defined and penalized by the Revised Penal
Code, as amended, and special laws, if committed by, through and
with the use of information and communications technologies
shall be covered by the relevant provisions of this Act: Provided,
That the penalty to be imposed shall be one (1) degree higher
than that provided for by the Revised Penal Code, as amended,
and special laws, as the case may be.

Section 6 merely makes commission of existing crimes through
the internet a qualifying circumstance. There exists a substantial
distinction between crimes committed through the use of information
and communications technology and similar crimes committed using
other means. In using the technology in question, the offender often
evades identification and is able to reach far more victims or cause

1251

Art 354

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

greater harm. The distinction, therefore, creates a basis for higher
penalties for cybercrimes. (Disini v. Secretary of Justice, G.R. No.
203335, February 11, 2014)
Identical material cannot be the subject of two separate libels.

If the published material on print, said to be libelous, is again
posted online or vice versa, that identical material cannot be the
subject of two separate libels. The two offenses, one a violation of
Article 353 of the Revised Penal Code and the other a violation of
Section 4(c)(4) of R.A. No. 10175 involve essentially the same elements
and are in fact one and the same offense. Online libel under Section
4(c)(4) is not a new crime but is one already punished under Article
353. Section 4(cX4) merely establishes the computer system as another
means of publication. Charging the offender under both laws would
be a blatant violation of the proscription against double jeopardy.

Art. 354. Requirement for publicity. Every defamatory
imputation is presumed to be malicious, even if it be true,
if no good intention and justifiable motive for making it is
shown, except in the following cases:
1. A private communication made by any person to
another in the performance of any legal, moral, or social
duty; and

2. A fair and true report, made in good faith, without
any comments or remarks, of any judicial, legislative, or

other official proceedings which are not of confidential
nature, or of any statement, report, or speech delivered in
said proceedings, or of any other act performed by public
officers in the exercise of their functions.

Malice in law is presumed from every defamatory imputation.

The opening sentence of Article 354 states the presumption of
malice in defamation. It is known as malice in law.
1252

TITLE THIRTEEN
Crimes Against Honor

Art. 354

When the imputation is defamatory, the prosecution or the

plaintiff need not prove malice on the part of the defendant. The law
presumes that the defendant’s imputation is malicious.
Even if the defamatory imputation is true, the presumption
of malice still exists, if no good intention and justifiable motive for
making it is shown.

Illustration:
If A tells C that B is a thief, and the fact is that B is really a
thief, because he was previously convicted of theft, can it be presumed
that the imputation made by A is malicious? Yes. Article 354 says
that “every defamatory imputation is presumed to be malicious even
if be true.”
But the presumption of malice is rebutted, if A can show: (1)
good intention, and (2) justifiable motive for making the imputation.
Thus, if B, in the illustration, is applying for the position of
security guard in the hardware store of C, brother of A, and the
purpose of the latter is to protect C from undesirable person who
may be employed by him, there being a good intention on the part
of A and a justifiable motive for informing C of B’s criminal record,
malice cannot be presumed.

—

The presumption of malice is rebutted, if it is shown by the
accused that
(a)

the defamatory imputation is true, in case the law allows
proof of the truth of the imputation;

(b)

it is published with good intention; and

(c)

there is justifiable motive for making it.

Defamatory imputation.

Petitioner’s words stated during the airing of his program are
clearly defamatory. The words “GAGO,” “TARANTADONG PASTOR,”
“PASTOR NG DEMONYO IYAN,” “BULAANG PROPETA” disparage
private complainant Almeda. As in Buatis, Jr. u. People, 520 Phil. 149
(2006), evidence aliunde is unnecessary to establish that these words
are without malice. Moreover, examination of the statements put forth
in the Information does not reveal any good intention on the part of

petitioner or any justifiable motive as to negate the presumption of
malice. (Soriano v. People, G.R. No. 225010, November 21, 2018)

to injure the reputation of the person defamed. (Orfanel v. People,
L-26877, December 26, 1969, 30 SCRA 819-820)

Malice is not presumed In the following:

The class of absolutely privileged communications is narrow
and is practically limited to legislative and judicial proceedings and
other acts of state, including, it is said, communications made in the
discharge of a duty under express authority of law, by or to heads of
executive departments of the state, and matters involving military
affairs. The privilege is not intended so much for the protection
of those engaged in the public service and in the enactment and
administration of law, as for the promotion of the public welfare, the
purpose being that members of the legislature, judges of courts, jurors,
lawyers, and witnesses may speak their minds freely and exercise
their respective functions without incurring the risk of a criminal
prosecution or an action for the recovery of damages. (Sison v. David,
supra, citing 33 Am. Jur., 123-124)
For reasons of public policy which looks to the free and unfettered
administration of justice, it appears to be the prevailing rule in the
United States that statement made in a pleading in a civil action are
absolutely privileged and no action for libel may be founded thereon
when pertinent and relevant to the subject under inquiry, however
false and malicious such statement may be. (Sison v. David, supra,

The prosecution must prove malice in fact to convict the accused
on a charge of libel involving a privileged communication. (Lu Chu
Sing, et al. v. Lu Tiong Gui, 76 Phil. 669)
Two kinds of privileged communications.
The two kinds of privileged communications are: (1) the absolute;
and (2) the conditional or qualified.

A privileged communication may be either absolutely privileged
or conditionally privileged. A communication is said to be absolutely
privileged when it is not actionable, even if its author has acted in bad
faith. This class includes statements made by members of Congress in
the discharge of their functions as such, official communications made
by public officers in the performance of their duties, and allegations or
statements made by the parties or their counsel in their pleadings or
motions or during the hearing of judicial proceedings, as well as the
answers given by witnesses in reply to questions propounded to them,
in the course of said proceedings, provided that said allegations or
statements are relevant to the issues, and the answers are responsive
or pertinent to the questions propounded to said witnesses. Upon the
other hand, conditionally or qualifiedly privileged communications are
those which, although containing defamatory imputations, would not
be actionable unless made with malice or bad faith. It has, moreover,
been held that there is malice when the defamer has been prompted
1254

Art. 354

820)

The rule then is well-settled in the United States that parties,
counsel, and witnesses are exempted from liability in libel or slander
for words otherwise defamatory, published in the course of judicial
proceedings provided the statements are pertinent or relevant to the
case. (Santiago v. Calvo, 48 Phil. 919)
If the case is not covered by absolute privilege, it may be tested in
the light of the qualified privilege extended to a private communication
made by any person to another in the performance of any legal, moral
or social duty.
Qualified privilege is lost by proof of malice. (U.S. v. Bustos, et

al., 37 Phil. 731)

Article 354 does not cover an absolutely privileged communication,

because the privilege character of the communication mentioned
therein is lost upon proof of malice (in fact).
1255

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Paragraph No. 1, Article 354.

Private communication made by any person to another in the
performance of any legal, moral, or social duty.
The person making the communication containing defamatory
imputation may not be guilty of libel. This exemption from liability
is predicated upon the fact that it is the duty and right of a citizen to
make a complaint of any misconduct on the part of public officials to
those charged with supervision over them, even though the charges
contained therein are not substantiated upon investigation, unless
it appears that the charges were made maliciously and without any
reasonable ground for believing them to be true. (U.S. v. Galeza, 31
Phil. 365)

Accusation aired in a public meeting, not a private communication.
The charges or accusations must be made in private
communication. Thus, in a case where the accused, instead of making
the accusations against an employee of the office of the municipal
treasurer to the proper authorities, aired them in a public meeting,
it was held that the statements made in that public meeting were
not privileged. (People v. Jaring, CA., 40 O.G. 3683)

Art. 354

2.

That the communication is addressed to an officer or a board,
or superior, having some interest or duty in the matter;

3.

That the statements in the communication are made in good
faith without malice (in fact). (U.S. v. Bustos, 37 Phil. 743;
U.S. v. Canete, et al., 38 Phil. 253)

Private communication in the performance of a legal duty.
Legal duty presupposes a provision of law conferring upon the

accused the duty to communicate. If there is no provision of law to that

i

effect, the accused has no duty to make the report or communication
to another. The report or communication is not privileged. (People v.

Hogan, CA., 55 O.G. 1597)

A communication sent by an official to his immediate superior
in the performance of a legal duty, as an explanation of a matter
contained in an indorsement sent to him by his superior officer,
although employed in a language somewhat harsh and uncalled for, is
excusable in the interest of public policy, and is considered a privileged
communication, for which the writer is not liable for damages. (Deano
v. Godinez, 12 SCRA 483)

The communication need not be in private document
The privileged communication referred to in paragraph No. 1
of Article 354, does not necessarily have to be in a private document
as it may also be in a public document, like an affidavit. (People v.
Cantos, CA., 51 O.G. 2995)
Note: The privileged communication covers also complaints
against individuals who are not public officers, like the priests. (U.S.
v. Canete, et al., 38 Phil. 253)

The defendant, as administratrix of the estate of a deceased
person, filed a written objection with the commissioners to a certain
claim presented by the plaintiff, in which written objection the
defendant made certain statements which reflected upon the virtue,
honor and reputation of the plaintiff.

Requisites of privileged communication under paragraph no.
1 of Article 354.
A private communication made by any person to another is a
privileged communication, when the following requisites are present:
1. That the person who made the communication had a legal,
moral or social duty to make the communication, or, at least,
he had an interest to be upheld;

The administrator of the estate and those directly interested in
the estate have a right to present whatever arguments they have in
opposition to the allowance of such claims.

1256

Held: The commissioners have a right to hear evidence and
decide upon the validity and legality of the claim presented against
the estate.

The written objection filed by the administratrix, being pertinent
or relevant, is a privileged communication. (Zurbito v. Bayot, 20 Phil.
219)

1257

Art. 354

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Private communication in the performance of a moral duty.

The existence of a moral duty depends upon the relationship
between the giver and receiver of the communication and whether
said communication is voluntarily given or not.
Thus, when the accused admitted that he had not been connected
with Caltex in any capacity and that the libelous letter was voluntarily
written by him and not in answer to any inquiry, the accused had
no conceivable interest in the subject matter of the communication,
which was the pilferage of kerosene from Caltex. (People v. Hogan,
supra)

Complaint made in good faith against a priest to his ecclesiastical
superior allegedly for drunkenness, taking indecent liberties of
women, illicit relations with a woman, and general immoral and
indecent behavior, is privileged, even if the proof fails to establish the
truth of the charges. The members of a religious organization have
a moral duty to bring to the attention of the church authorities the
misbehavior of their spiritual leaders or of fellow members. (U.S. v.

Canete, et al., 38 Phil. 253)

TITLE THIRTEEN

Art. 354

for him to give his information to Clapano who was not his superior
nor the party to whom the information should be given. He could have
made the revelation himself either in open session or by taking the
necessary steps to have the matter investigated. As a co-member of
the City Council, defendant owes no legal or moral duty to Clapano.
(People v. Pelayo, Jr., CA., 64 O.G. 1992-1993)
Applying to the wrong person due to honest mistake does not take
the case out of the privilege.

As regards privileged communication, the rule is that if a party
applies to the wrong person through some natural and honest mistake
as to the respective functions of various officials, such unintentional
error will not take the case out of the privilege. (U.S v. Bustos 37
Phil. 731)

Unnecessary publicity destroys good faith.
When a copy of a privileged communication is sent to a
newspaper publication, the privilege is destroyed by the conduct of
the accused. (People v. Cruz, 40 O.G., Supp. 11, 15)

Private communication in the performance of a social duty.

The complaint against a teacher addressed to the principal,
notwithstanding the fact that, for unknown reasons, it never reached
the hands of said principal, does not lose its character of a privileged
communication as far as the complainant is concerned. (People v.
Fabia, 40 O.G., Supp. 12, 18)
The existence of social duty depends upon the relationship
between the sender and recipient of the communication. (People v.
Hogan, CA., supra) If the communication was made by a person
having no social duty to perform, it is not privileged. (People v.
Adamos, 1 CA. Rep. 504)
The communication must be addressed to an officer or superior
having some interest or duty in the matter.
[The Court] cannot accept as true that defendant was actuated
by a sense of duty, moral, legal, or social, to communicate the matter
to Councilor Clapano. He himself was a member of the City Council. If
he was carried by that sense of duty as he claims, it was not necessary
1258

People v. De la Vega-Cayetano
(CA., 52 O.G. 240)

Facts: G was a Justice of the Peace and as such was authorized,
as representative of the Judge Advocate General’s Office, to receive and
deliver checks to the heirs of deceased personnel of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines or of the United States.
On October 31, 1950, G received a check for delivery to the defendant,
a widow of a deceased employee of the United States Army. For failure of
the defendant to present the required form, JAGO Form B, she was not able
to secure the check. Up to November 27, 1950, the defendant did not receive
her check from G, who was also responsible for the stopping of the former’s
pension at one time.

The defendant referred to the Judge Advocate General’s Office and
executed an affidavit, the pertinent portions of which read, as follows:

“That I have been asked by said Justice of the Peace (G) to give her a

share in my check in order to facilitate delivery, which, according to other
People she has victimized, should be at least P300 x x x.
1259

Art. 354

Criminal Law

The defendant retained copies of her said affidavit. She showed a copy
of said affidavit to B who read its contents in the presence of C, while they
were in the jeep bound for Laoag. In the house of D, the contents of said
affidavit were made known by the husband of the defendant before a group
of persons gathered there.

Held: (1) The contents of the affidavit were unduly published. (2) The
contents of the affidavit are libelous per se. The defendant admitted that she
had not personally seen G having received from somebody any money or other
consideration for the delivery of checks to pensioners. Her very witnesses,
who were pensioners like her, disclaimed that they were victimized by G.
Thus, the Supreme Court has said

—

“Having arrogated unto himself the authority to cast upon complainants
the stigma of guilt, without giving them an opportunity to be heard in their
defense, he ran escape the consequences of his officious assumption of power
by nothing short of positive proof that his accusation was warranted by the
facts, and that in making it public he was not actuated by personal spite
against the complainant, or a mere delight in the propagation of scandal, but
by a good motive and a desire to accomplish a justifiable object. The proof
of the truth of the accusation cannot be made to rest upon mere hearsay,
rumors or suspicion. It must rest upon positive, direct evidence, upon which
a definite finding may be made by the court." (U.S. v. Sotto, 38 Phil. 673)

Reason for the doctrine of privileged communication.

It is based upon the recognition of the fact that the right of
the individual to enjoy immunity from the publication of untruthful
charges derogatory to his character is not absolute and must at
times yield to the superior necessity of subjecting to investigation the
conduct of persons charged with wrongdoing. In order to accomplish
this purpose and to permit private persons having, or in good faith,
believing themselves to have knowledge of such wrongdoing, to
perform the legal, moral, or social duty, without restraining them by
the fear that an error may subject them to punishment for defamation,
the doctrine of qualified privilege has been evolved. (U.S. v. Bustos,
et al., 37 Phil. 731; U.S. v. Canete, et al., 38 Phil. 253)
The privileged character simply does away with the presumption
of malice.

The fact that a communication is privileged does not mean that
it is not actionable; the privileged character simply does away with
1260

TITLE THIRTEEN

Crimes Against Honor

Art. 354

the presumption of malice, which the plaintiff has to prove in such a

case. (Lu Chu Sing, et al. v. Lu Tiong Gui, 76 Phil. 669)

When malice in fact is proven, assertions and proofs that the

libelous articles are qualifiedly privileged communications are futile,

since being qualifiedly privileged communications merely prevents
the presumption of malice from attaching to a defamatory imputation.
(Yuchengco v. The Manila Chronicle, et al., G.R. No. 184315, November
25, 2009)

The rule is that a communication loses its privileged character and
.Is actionable on proof of actual malice.

Thus, if the writer of a letter was a good friend and a staunch
loyal political follower of the late President Quirino, the person
allegedly libeled, and had had no misunderstanding with him, and
it appearing that the statements (contained in the letter) charged as
libelous were not communicated by the writer to any outsider prior
to their publication, with which said writer had nothing to do, it was
held that those facts should disprove any malice. The letter which was
written and sent in the usual course of business for the purpose of
upholding the writer's interest was held to be prima facie a privileged
communication. There being no proof of actual malice on the part of
the writer, the charge of libel was dismissed. (People v. Rojas, G.R.
L-266, June 2, 1959)
That the statement Is a privileged communication Is a matter of
defense.

A privileged communication is a matter of defense and, like all
other matters of defense, must be established by the accused.
Exception:

The Provincial Fiscal filed with the Court of First Instance an
information for libel against the defendant which, in part, alleges:
xxx, the accused, being one of the attorneys of record for
the plaintiffs in Civil Case No. 591, x x x, tried and decided by the
herein complainant, filed in said case a motion for reconsideration
of the decision, with the following libelous words and phrases, to

wit:

1261

Art. 354

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

TITLE THIRTEEN

Criminal Law

xxx, said presiding judge willfully and maliciously violated
the law to suit the whims, caprices and abuses of the defendants
in a manner that the defendants in this case had bragged to the
people x x x, in no case said defendants shall be beaten in any
litigation before said presiding judge, x x x.

A careful scrutiny of the behavior and manner
of the actuations of this then presiding judge in this
instant case, (will show) so glaring an example of
prejudiced abuse of power that the plaintiffs could
not be given a bit of justice before him.

J ust to show the partiality of the presiding judge
and the lack of delicacy on his part, said presiding
judge used to board in the house of the defendants
and to use the car of a son of one of the defendants
for his personal convenience all the time, before and
even during the time that this case was pending in
his sala. Could the poor plaintiffs in this case expect
justice from said presiding judge? It is respectfully
submitted that his orders be carefully studied to show
the abuse of power he has committed in this case."

The trial court dismissed the case.
The prosecution claims that the trial court erred in dismissing
the case on a mere motion to quash, contending that the trial judge’s
conclusion on the face of the information that defendant-appellee was
prompted only by good motives assumes a fact to be proved, and that
the alleged privileged nature of defendant-appellee’s publication is
a matter of defense and is not a proper ground for dismissal of the
complaint for libel. (Lu Chu Sing, et al. v. Lu Tiong Gui, 76 Phil. 669)
When in the information itself it appears that the communication
alleged to be libelous is contained in an appropriate pleading in a court
proceeding, the privilege becomes at once apparent and defendant
need not wait until the trial and produce evidence before he can
raise the question of privilege. And if, added to this, the questioned
imputations appear to be really pertinent and relevant to defendant’s
plea for reconsideration based on complainant’s supposed partiality
and abuse of power from which defendant has a right to seek relief in
vindication of his client’s interest as a litigant in complainant’s court,
1262

Art. 354

it would become evident that the facts thus alleged in the information
would not constitute an offense of libel.
As has already been said by th[e] Court: “As to the degree of
relevancy or pertinency necessary to make alleged defamatory matter
privileged, the courts are inclined to be liberal. The matter to which
the privilege does not extend must be so palpably wanting in relation
to the subject matter of the controversy that no reasonable man can
doubt its irrelevancy and impropriety.” (Smith, Bell & Co. u. Ellis, 48
Phil. 475; also cited in Malit v. People, 114 SCRA 348) Having this in
mind, it cannot be said that the trial court committed a reversible error
in this case in finding that the allegations in the information itself
present a case of an absolute privileged communication justifying the
dismissal of the case. (People v. Andres, 107 Phil. 1046)
How to overcome the defense of privileged communication under
paragraph no. 1 of Article 354.
The defense of privileged communication will be rejected, if it is
shown by the prosecution or the plaintiff that (1) the defendant acted
with malice in fact, or (2) there is no reasonable ground for believing
the charge to be true.

Malice in fact — how proved.

The existence of malice in fact may be shown by extrinsic
evidence that the defendant bore a grudge against the offended party,
or that there was rivalry or ill-feeling between them which existed at
the date of the publication of the defamatory imputation, or that the
defendant had an intention to injure the reputation of the offended
party as shown by the words used and the circumstances attending
the publication of the defamatory imputation.
The accused admitted that he was motivated by hate and revenge
because the offended party instigated the filing of criminal cases
against him, without which he would not have sent the communication
at all. Malice in fact being present in this case, justifiable motives
cannot exist, and the communication becomes actionable. (People v.

Hogan, supra)

No reasonable ground for believing the charge to be true.

When the defendant admitted that he had personally made no

investigation with reference to the truth of many of the statements
1263

Art. 364

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

made in the communication to the Secretary of Justice, especially
with reference to the statements based on the rumors that a judge
and a fiscal received a bribe for dismissing a murder case, he had no
reasonable ground for believing the charge made by him to be true.
(U.S. v. Bustos, 13 Phil. 690)
But probable cause for belief In the truth of the matter charged is
sufficient.

Even when the statements are found to be false, if there is
probable cause for belief in their truthfulness and the charge is made
in good faith, the mantle of privilege may still cover the mistake of the
individual. But the statement must be made under an honest sense
of duty; a self-seeking motive is destructive. (U.S. v. Bustos, et al., 37
Phil. 731)

In a signed petition to the Executive Secretary, 34 citizens
charged a justice of the peace with malfeasance in office and asked
for his removal. The matter was referred for investigation to a judge,
who, after hearing, acquitted the justice of the peace. The justice of
the peace filed a libel case based on the petition.
Held: This is not a simple case of direct and vicious accusations
published in the press, but of charges predicated on affidavits made to
the proper official and thus qualifiedly privileged. No undue publicity
was given to the petition. No evidence of malice in fact. The accused
are not liable for libel. (U.S. v. Bustos, et al., 37 Phil. 731)
Statements as to the “lousy performance” and “mismanagement”
of the offended party cannot be regarded to have been written with the
knowledge that these were false or in reckless disregard of whether
these were false, bearing in mind that Batuigas had documentary
evidence to support his statements. Batuigas merely expressed his
opinion based on the fact that there were complaints filed against
the offended party, among others. If the comment is an expression
of opinion, based on established facts, then it is immaterial that the
opinion happens to be mistaken, as long as it might reasonably be
inferred from the facts. (Manila Bulletin v. Domingo, G.R. No. 170341,
July 5, 2017)

Paragraph No. 2, Article 354.

Fair and true report of official proceedings.
The official proceedings refer to the proceedings of the
three Departments of the Government, namely: (1) Judiciary; (2)

Legislative; and (3) Executive.
In order that the publication of a report of an official proceeding
may be considered privileged, the following conditions must exist:
(a) That it is a fair and true report of a judicial, legislative,
or other official proceedings which are not of confidential
nature, or of a statement, report or speech delivered in said
proceedings, or of any other act performed by a public officer
in the exercise of his functions;
(b)

That it is made in good faith; and

(c)

That it is without any comments or remarks.

If all these conditions are present, the person who makes the
report of the official proceedings is not guilty of libel, even if the report
contains defamatory and injurious matters affecting another person.
The report must be fair and true.

When a publisher publishes a fair and true report of a proceeding,
he is only narrating what had taken place. In such a case, even if
what had been reported is libelous, and even if some errors had been
committed in the process of the publication, the presumption of malice
is overcome by the privilege. (People v. Robie, CA.., 70 O.G. 10070)

The report of the complaint is not fair and true when, contrary
to the complaint, the report stated that the complaint charged the
plaintiff with removing the money from the vaults of Aldecoa & Co., or
with making wrong entry of the amounts in the books of the company.
(Macleod v. Phil. Pub. Co., 12 Phil. 427)
A report with comments or remarks is not privileged.

The complainant was administratively charged for mauling the
commentator of a radio station. President Magsaysay commissioned
a fiscal to investigate the charge. The investigator found the

complainant guilty and recommended his suspension as public official
for two months. The accused published in a newspaper an article
which in part stated, “the people will know because to his dying
day Ganzon will not live down this incident where while the nation
mourned the death of Magsaysay, he, Ganzon, rejoiced in the same
way that buzzards and coyotes rejoice over the same thing.” Even if
the report of the jubilation of the complainant was true, the accused
should have stopped at reciting the facts only. He should not have
made any comments or remarks. (People v. Rico, 3 CA. Rep. 225)
Judicial proceedings.

2.

True report of judicial proceedings is privileged. Malice must
be shown, by the prosecution, as it is the very gist of the
offense involving the publication of a true report of a judicial
proceeding. (U.S. v. Perfecto, 42 Phil. 113)
Allegations and averments in pleadings are absolutely
privileged only insofar as they are relevant or pertinent to

the issues.

An affidavit to support a motion for new trial in an action
by a widow to recover for the death of her husband, containing
libelous charge that the widow had been sustaining illicit
relations with one of her material witnesses, was absolutely
privileged, the allegations being relevant. (Tupas v. Parreno,
Sr., et al., 105 Phil. 1304)

3.

But where the defendant who instituted an action for
the recovery of professional fees, alleged in his (defendant’s)
complaint that the offended party frequently evaded his
obligations and that his creditors were disgusted because
they could not collect what was due them, it was held that the
allegations were impertinent and unnecessary. (Montenegro
v. Medina, 73 Phil. 602)
An action for libel on a defamatory matter uttered in the
course of a judicial proceeding might be instituted even if
the defamatory matter had not yet been stricken out of the
record. An action for libel accrues from the date of publication.
(Montenegro v. Medina, supra)
1266

4.

Art. 354

The correct rule with respect to the publication of
judicial proceedings should be that fair and true report of the
complaint filed in court without remarks nor comments even
before an answer is filed or a decision promulgated should be
covered by the privilege.
The reason for the rule that pleading in judicial
proceedings are considered privileged is not only because
said pleading have become part of public record open to
the public to scrutinize, but also due to the undeniable fact
that said pleadings are presumed to contain allegations
and assertions lawful and legal in nature, appropriate to
the disposition of issues ventilated before the courts for the
proper administration of justice and, therefore, of general
public concern. Moreover, pleadings are presumed to contain
allegations in good faith, the contents of which would be under
the scrutiny of courts and, therefore, subject to be purged of
all improprieties and illegal statements contained therein.
(Cuenco v. Cuenco, 72 O.G. 5560)
Parties, counsels, and witnesses are exempted from liability
in libel or slander for words otherwise defamatory published
in the course of judicial proceedings, provided the statement
are pertinent or relevant to the case. (Santiago v. Calvo, 48
Phil. 919; Malit v. People, 114 SCRA 348)
The reason for such requirement is that the protection
given to individuals in the interest of an efficient administration
of justice may not be abused as a cloak from beneath which
private malice may be gratified. (Montenegro v. Medina, 73

Phil. 602)
The communication must be pertinent and material to the subject
matter.
The statement uttered by an attorney while cross-examining
an adverse witness in an administrative case: “I doubt how did you
become a doctor” is not libelous or vexatious. In this case, the attorney
was prompted to say “I doubt how did you become a doctor when

—

the adverse witness who was a doctor would not answer the question
as to who prepared the document presented to her, and when the
witness repeatedly evaded the question by saying that she did not
understand the word “made." (Malit v. People, supra)

Only matters “which are not of confidential nature” may be

To be privileged, the communication must be pertinent and
material to the subject matter in which the author claims an interest
to uphold. The protection of the privilege may be lost by the manner
of its exercise. It does not protect any unnecessary defamation.
The party making the communication must not go farther than his
interests or his duties require. Irrelevant libel or the form in which
the defamatory words are used in connection with the subject may
show express malice. (People v. Fernandez, CA., 64 O.G. 343, citing
33 Am. Jur. 115-116, 176-177, 247-249; 36 C.J.S. 1241-1242, 1248)

(Sec. 2, Rule 135, Rules of Court), the same should not be published.

Art. 354

Defaming client through his lawyer.

Where the accused, to whom a claim is presented by an attorney
in behalf of the latter’s client, sends to the attorney a libelous
communication concerning the client, there is sufficient publication.
There being no relationship of principal and agent between the
accused and the lawyer, the rule that the absolute privilege accorded a
publication may be extended to the client who defames a third person
in a communication made by the client to his lawyer preliminary to
a judicial proceedings does not apply. (People v. Fernandez, id.)
Legislative proceedings.

These include proceedings of the committees of the Congress of
the Philippines. A reporter, for instance, can publish the records of
those proceedings, provided he does not give any comment or remark
thereon, and provided further that they are not of confidential nature.
Other official proceedings.

These proceedings refer to the official proceedings by other public
officers in the exercise of their functions.

published.

Thus, when the court, in any special case, has forbidden the

publication of certain records in the interest of morality or decency

Proceedings for disbarment of attorneys are private and
confidential, except the final order of the court which may be made
public. (Sec. 10, Rule 139, Rules of Court)

What public record may be published.
The privilege has been strictly limited to cases in which the right
of access is secured by law, and in which the purpose and object of
the law is to give publicity to the contents of the record or document
in the interest, or for the protection, of the public generally. (U.S. v.
Santos, 33 Phil. 533)

If the contents of the record or document, involved in any judicial
legislative or other official proceedings, are of confidential nature,
they should not be published. Hence, the publication of confidential
records containing libelous matter is not privileged.
Enumeration under Article 354 Is notan exclusive list of qualifiedly
privileged communication.

In the case of Borjal v. Court of Appeals, 301 SCRA 1, 22 (1999),
the Supreme Court recognized that the enumeration stated in Article
354 of the Revised Penal Code is not exclusive but is rendered more
expansive by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press,
thus:

... To be sure, the enumeration under Article 354 is not an
exclusive list of qualifiedly privileged communications since
fair commentaries on matters of public interest are likewise
privileged. The rule on privileged communications had its genesis
not in the nation’s penal code but in the Bill of Rights of the
Constitution guaranteeing freedom of speech and of the press. As
early as 1918, in United States v. Canete (38 Phil. 253), this Court
ruled that publications which are privileged for reasons of public
policy are protected by the constitutional guaranty of freedom
of speech. This constitutional right cannot be abolished by the

et al., G.R. No. 118971, September 15, 1999, 314 SCRA 460)

Remarks and comments on the conduct or acts of public officers.
Defamatory remarks and comments on the conduct or acta
of public officers which are related to the discharge of their official
duties will not constitute libel is the defendant proves the truth of
the imputation.
But any attack upon the private character of the public officer on
matters which are not related to the discharge of their official functions
may constitute libel. (People v. Del Fierro and Padilla, C.A., G.R. No.
3599-R, July 27, 1950)
The conduct or acts of public officers which are related to the
discharge of their official duties are matters of public interest. It is
a defense in an action for libel or slander that the words complained
are fair comment on a matter of public interest.
In defamation, where the acts imputed concern the private
life of the individual, criminal intent is presumed to arise from the
publication of defamatory matters because no one has a right to
invade another’s privacy; but where the imputation is based upon
a matter of public interest, the presumption of criminal intent does
not arise from the mere publication of defamatory matter. A matter
of public interest is a common property; hence, anybody may express
an opinion on it. The public conduct of every public man is a matter
of public concern. Libelous remarks or comments connected for one
thing, with any speech or acts performed by officers in the exercise
of their functions are not actionable, unless malice is proved. If it
is shown that the imputation is either a false allegation of fact, or
the expression of an opinion based upon mere conjecture, malicious
intent is established. In order that a discreditable imputation to a
public official may be actionable, it must be either a false allegation
of fact or a comment based upon a false supposition. If the comment
is an expression of an opinion, based upon proven facts, then it is no
matter that the opinion happens to be mistaken so long as it might be
reasonably inferred from the facts. Comment may be fair, although
wrong. So that the discreditable imputation may not be actionable,
the fact upon which the comment is reasonably based should be actual

facts; and not mere suppositions. (People v. Velasco, CA., 40 O.G.
3694)

Doctrine of fair comment
Fair commentaries on matters of public interest are privileged
and constitute a valid defense in an action for libel or slander.
The Doctrine of Fair Comment means that while in general every
discreditable imputation publicly made is deemed false, because

every man is presumed innocent until his guilt is judicially proved,
and every false imputation is deemed malicious, nevertheless, when
the discreditable imputation is directed against a public person in
his public capacity, it is not necessarily actionable. In order that
such discreditable imputation to a public official may be actionable,
it must either be a false allegation of fact or a comment based on a
false supposition. If the comment is an expression of opinion, based
on established facts, then it is immaterial that the opinion happens
to be mistaken, as long as it might reasonably be inferred from the
facts. (Borjal v. Court of Appeals, 301 SCRA 1, 22 [1999])
Fair comments on qualifications of candidates.

Public acts of public men may lawfully be made the subjects
of comment and criticism. If made in good faith, such criticism is
privileged.
The mental, moral and physical fitness of candidates for public
office may be the object of comment and criticism. But if it appears
that it was actuated by actual or express malice, and is defamatory
in its nature, the comment or criticism constitutes a criminal libel.
(U.S. v. Sedano, 14 Phil. 338)

Criticism and defamation distinguished.

Criticism deals only with such things as shall invite public

attention or call for public comment. It does not follow a public man
into his private life nor pry into his domestic concerns.
They may attack and seek to destroy, by fair means or foul, the
whole fabric of his statesmanship, but the law does not permit them to
attack the man himself. They may falsely charge that his policies are
bad, but they may not falsely charge that he is bad. (U.S. v. Contreras,
et al., 23 Phil. 513)
1271

Hence, if the criticism follows a public officer into his private life
which has no connection with the performance of his public duties,
and falsely charges him with evil motives, clearly designed to destroy
his reputation or besmirch his name, there is defamation.

of B.S. sent to the accused. These alleged scurrilous imputations are
not merely an outgrowth of a capricious imagination of the accused.
The statement was intended to counteract the impression left in the
mind of the public by that article entitled “Doubtful Citizenship.”
Held: Self-defense is man’s inborn right. In a physical assault,
retaliation becomes unlawful after the attack has ceased, because
there would be no further harm to repel.
But that is not the case when it is aimed at a person’s good name.
Once the aspersion is cast, its sting clings and the one thus defamed
may avail himself of all necessary means to shake it off. He may hit
back with another libel which, if adequate, will be justified. (People
v. Chua Hiong, CA., 51 O.G. 1932)

Art. 364

The policy of a public official may be attacked rightly or wrongly.

The policy of a public official may be attacked, rightly or wrongly,
with every argument which ability can find or ingenuity invent.
On the other hand, a public officer must not be too thin-skinned
with reference to comment upon his official acts. Only thus, can the
intelligence and dignity of the individual be exalted. The public officer
may suffer under a hostile and an unjust accusation; the wound can
be assuaged with the balm of a clear conscience. (U.S. v. Bustos, et
al., 37 Phil. 731)
Statements made In self defense or in mutual controversy are often

privileged.

In an honest endeavor to vindicate himself and his own interests,
a person is often privileged to make statements which would otherwise
be regarded as defamatory. Thus, if one’s good name is assailed in the
newspaper, he may reply defending himself, and if his reply is made
in good faith, without malice and is not unnecessarily defamatory of
his assailant, it is privileged. (People v. Baja, CA, 40 O.G. Supp. 5,

206)

But the publication of a libel by the plaintiff (or offended party)
is no legal justification of another libel by the defendant. (Pellicena
v. Gonzales, 6 Phil. 50)

Art. 354

Retaliation or vindictiveness cannot be a basis of self-defense In
defamation.
A, after alighting from a rig, went in front of the home of B, C,
and D, the three defendants, and in the heat of anger, shouted at
them the following words: “You pimp, women of ill repute, thieves,
paramours of my husband." To which B answered back, saying;“You
are a woman of the street, you smell bad, and your money was stolen
from the PCAU." The other defendant C retorted:“You are shameless,
blackmailer, murderer." And the third defendant D replied: “You
have a thick face, you are not legally married, you are the paramour
of Father Baluyut."

The offended party previously caused to be published in the
Manila Chronicle an article entitled “Doubtful Citizenship,” in
which it was made to appear that the accused, in his petition for
naturalization, obtained a decision based on questionable proofs.
After the publication of said article the accused published a
libelous statement to the effect that the offended party instigated
investigations in different government agencies against the accused,
because of his persecution mania and in the spirit of revenge; and that
the offended party was the mastermind behind the threatening letter

Held: Not because a person has called another a shameless,
good-for-nothing animal, that the person insulted would have the
right to return the insult by calling him murderer, criminal, gangster,
prostitute, etc., under the mantle of self-defense.
The defendants let loose a barrage of insults upon A, imputing
immorality, unchastity, dishonesty and criminality which were not
fair answers to A’s lambasts and were absolutely unrelated to her
imputations upon them.
It may be true that “once the aspersion is cast its sting clings,"
but will another libel shake off such sting? Will the hitting back undo
what was done? [The] [Court] take[s] it that if a person insulted
hits back, he wants to retaliate or take revenge; and retaliation or
vindictiveness can hardly be a basis of self-defense. The answering

of libel may be justified, if it is adequate; and it is inadequate when
the answer is unnecessarily scurrilous. (People u. Rayo, et al., C.A.,
53 O.G. 8618)

To repel the attack, the defendant may make an explanation
of the imputation, and it is only where, if by explaining, he must of
necessity have to use scurrilous and slanderous remarks, that he may
legally be allowed to do so without placing himself under criminal
prosecution. (People v. Pelayo, Jr., CA., 64 O.G. 1994)
Rule: The defamatory statements made by the accused must be
a fair answer to the libel made by the supposed offended party and
must be related to the imputation made. The answer should not be
unnecessarily libelous.

Defamation through amplifier is not libel, but oral defamation.

The prosecution maintains that the medium of an amplifier
system, through which the defamatory statements imputed to the
accused were allegedly made, falls within the purview of Article 355,
in the sense that an “amplifier system” is a means similar to “radio.”
This pretense is untenable. The word “radio" used in said Article
355, should be considered in relation to the terms with which it is

But defamation made in the television program is libel.

The information alleges that the utterances of the defamatory
words complained of had been made in the television program. Libel
was committed by a means similar to those mentioned in Article 355,
among which, are “radio, phonograph x x x theatrical exhibition,
cinematographic exhibition, or any similar means.” While the medium
of television is not expressly mentioned among the means specified in
the law, it easily qualifies under the general provision “or any similar
means.” (People v. Casten, et al., CA.-GJI. No. 07924-CR, promulgated
December 13, 1974)

Article 355 provides for the penalty for libel.

Note that while Articles 353 and 354 merely define defamation
and privileged communications, respectively, Article 355 prescribes
the penalty for libel.

It is evident from Article 355 that the court is given the discretion
to impose the penalty of imprisonment or fine or both for the crime
of libel. (People v. Subido, 66 SCRA 545)
Fine is preferred penalty in libel cases.

In the following cases, the Court opted to impose only a fine on

The foregoing cases indicate an emergent rule of preference for

In Fernando Sazon v. Court of Appeals and People, 325 Phil.
1053, 1068 (1996), the Court modified the penalty imposed upon
petitioner, an officer of a homeowners’ association, for the crime of
libel from imprisonment and fine in the amount of P200.00, to fine
only of P3.000, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency,
for the reason that he wrote the libelous article merely to defend his

complainant.

2.

In Quirico Mari v. Court of Appeals and People, 388 Phil.
269, 279 (2000), where the crime involved is slander by deed, the
Court modified the penalty imposed on the petitioner, an ordinary
government employee, from imprisonment to fine of Pl,000.00, with
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, on the ground that
the latter committed the offense in the heat of anger and in reaction
to a perceived provocation.

The Judges concerned may, in the exercise of sound discretion,
and taking into consideration the peculiar circumstances of
each case, determine whether the imposition of a fine alone
would best serve the interests of justice or whether forbearing
to impose imprisonment would depreciate the seriousness of
the offense, work violence on the social order, or otherwise
be contrary to the imperatives of justice;

3.

Should only a fine be imposed and the accused be unable to
pay the fine, there is no legal obstacle to the application of
the R.P.C. provisions on subsidiary imprisonment.

In Roberto Brillante v. Court of Appeals and People, G.R. Nos.
118757 and 121571, November 11, 2005, 474 SCRA 480, the Court
deleted the penalty of imprisonment imposed upon petitioner, a
local politician, but maintained the penalty of fine of P4,000.00, with
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, in each of the five cases
of libel, on the ground that the intensely feverish passions evoked
during the election period in 1988 must have agitated petitioner into
writing his open letter; and that incomplete privileged communication
should be appreciated in favor of petitioner, especially considering the
wide latitude traditionally given to defamatory utterances against
public officials in connection with or relevant to their performance of
official duties or against public figures in relation to matters of public

interest involving them.

In Jose Alemania Buatis, Jr. v. People and Atty. Jose Pieraz,
G.R. No. 142509, March 24, 2006, 485 SCRA 275, the Court opted
to impose upon petitioner, a lawyer, the penalty of fine only for the
crime of libel considering that it was his first offense and he was
motivated purely by his belief that he was merely exercising a civic
or moral duty to his client when he wrote the defamatory letter to
private complainant.

“In addition to the civil action which may be brought by the offended
party.”

Notwithstanding this clause in Article 355, a civil action for
damages may be filed simultaneously or separately with the criminal
action. (Art. 360, par. 3)

Illustration:
The accused threatened to publish in a weekly periodical, certain
letters, amorous in nature, written by a married woman and addressed
by her to a man, not her husband, unless she paid P4.000 to them.

(U.S. v. Eguia, et al., 38 Phil. 857)

[The Court] ha[s] carefully read the letter containing the alleged

libelous remarks, and we find that the letter is more threatening than
libelous, and the intent to threaten is the principal aim and object
of the letter. The libelous remarks contained in the letter, if so they
be considered, are merely preparatory remarks culminating in the
final threat. In other words, the libelous remarks express the heat of
passion which engulfs the writer of the letter, which heat of passion in
the latter part of the letter culminates into a threat. This is the more
important and serious offense committed by the accused. Under these
circumstances, the offense committed is clearly and principally that
of threats and that the statements derogatory to a person named do
not constitute an independent crime of libel. It is considered as part
of the more important offense of threats. (People v. Yebra, 60 O.G.

Extent of the application of the “Gag Law.”

The provisions of Article 357 constitute the so-called “Gag Law.”
Newspaper reports on cases pertaining to adultery, divorce, issues
about the legitimacy of children, etc., will necessarily be barred from
publication.
This article requires two things to constitute a violation of the
prohibition:
(a)

That the article published contains facts connected with
the private life of an individual; and

(b)

That such facts are offensive to the honor, virtue and
reputation of said person.

These two requisites must concur. If one of them is not present,
there is no violation of Article 357.

and virtue of the woman, do not at all interest or please the intelligent
and educated class of newspaper readers. (Guevara)
Example of a violation of Article 357:

A uttered defamatory remarks calling a priest a savage, a
carabao, that he had a concubine, and that he collected alms for
himself, not for the town.
While the case was pending trial, the local weekly edited by
the accused Ditto published the complaint verbatim including the
defamatory expressions used by A.

Held: The matter contained in the complaint filed by the priest
against A is libelous perse and affects the private life of the offended
party.
Had the offended party been a person holding a public office and
the acts imputed had relation to the discharge of his official duties,
the situation would be different. (People v. Dino, CA.-G.R. No. 8822,
September 24, 1942)
Source of news report may not be revealed.

Without prejudice to his liability under the civil and criminal
laws, the publisher, editor, columnist or duly accredited reporter of
any newspaper, magazine or periodical of general circulation cannot
be compelled to reveal the source of any news report or information
appearing in said publication which was related in confidence to such
publisher, editor or reporter unless the court or a House or committee
of Congress finds that such revelation is demanded by the security of
the State. (RA. No. 1477, amending RA. No. 53)

TITLE THIRTEEN
Crimes Against Honor

Art. 358

Factors that determine the gravity of oral defamation.
The gravity of the oral defamation depends not only (1) upon the
expressions used, but also (2) on the personal relations of the accused
and the offended party, and (3) the circumstances surrounding the
case. (People v. Jaring, CA., 40 O.G. 3683)

The social standing and the position of the offended party are
also taken into account. Thus, it was held that the slander was
grave, because the offended party had held previously the office of
Congressman, Governor, and Senator and was then a candidate for
Vice-President. (People v. Boiser, CA., 53 O.G. 2202)
The more we ponder over the fact that the complainant was a
respectable young lady, a public school teacher to whom her students
were to look up for exemplariness of character; the more we think of
the circumstances under which the unpleasant remarks were said,
in the presence of students and co-teachers of the complainant, the
more we are convinced that the crime committed by the accused is
indeed grave. (People v. Formanes, CA., 54 O.G. 6616)

Illustrations of grave slander:
What is slander?

Slander is oral defamation.
Slander is libel committed by oral (spoken) means, instead of in
writing. The term oral defamation or slander as now understood, has
been defined as the speaking of base and defamatory words which
tend to prejudice another in his reputation, office, trade, business or
means of livelihood. (Villanueva v. People, G.R. No. 160351, April 10,

2006,487 SCRA 42)

Two kinds of oral defamation:

1.

Simple slander; and

2.

Grave slander, when it is of a serious and insulting nature.

Grave slander is committed by a woman of violent temper,
who hurled at the complainant, a respectable married lady with
young daughters, offensive and scurrilous epithets, including words
imputing unchastity to the mother and tending to injure the character
of the daughters. (U.S. v. Tolosa, 37 Phil. 166)
The complaint recites that the scurrilous words impute to the
offended party the crime of estafa. The language of the indictment

strikes deep into the character of the victim: He “has sold the union”;
“he has swindled the money of the members”; he “received bribe money
in the amount of P10,000.00 x x x and another P6,000.00”; he “is
engaged in racketeering and enriching himself with the capitalists”;
he “has spent the funds of the union for his own personal use.” No
amount of sophistry will take these statements out of the compass of
grave oral defamation. (Balite v. People, 8 SCRA 280)

Examples of simple slander:
1. An accusation that the offended party has been living
successively and with several men uttered before several
1286

1287

Art. 358

persons, when intended to correct an improper conduct of the
offended party, a kin of the accused, is only a simple slander.
(People v. Clarin, 37 O.G. 1106)
Note: In the Tolosa case, the same imputation was made.
But in the Clarin case, the purpose was to correct an improper

2.
3.

4.

conduct.
Calling a person a gangster is simple slander. (Arcand v.
People, 68 Phil. 601)
Uttering defamatory words in the heat of anger, with some
provocation on the part of the offended party constitutes only
a light felony. (People v. De Modesto, 40 O.G., Supp. 11, 128)
Words uttered in the heat of anger or when passions
are running high, and not taken seriously by the offended
party, although they are clearly serious oral defamation
under ordinary circumstances, constitute only slight oral
defamation. (People v. Doronila, C.A., 40 O.G., Supp. 11, 231)
Defamation uttered in political meeting, considering that it
was committed on the eve of the elections when everyone was
excited and when feelings were running high, is only simple
slander. (People v. Laroga, 40 O.G., Supp. 11, 123)

The word “puta" does not impute that the complainant Is a prostitute.
The word “puta” alleged to have been uttered by the defendant
in referring to the offended party does not necessarily connote the
crime of prostitution, as defined in Article 202 of the R.P.C. (People
v. Atienza, G.R. No. L-19857, October 26, 1968)
The words,“Agustin, putang ina mo" is a common expression in
the dialect that is often employed not really to slander but rather to
express anger or displeasure. It is seldom, if ever, taken in its literal
sense by the hearer, that is, as a reflection on the virtue of a mother.
In the instant case, it should be viewed as part of the threats voiced
by appellant against the complainant evidently to make the same
more emphatic. (Reyes v. People, 27 SCRA 686)
The slander need not be heard by the offended party.

There is oral defamation, even if other persons and not the
offended party heard the slanderous words, because a man’s
1288

reputation is the estimate in which others hold him, not the good
opinion which he has of himself. (People v. Clarin, CA, 37 O.G. 1106;

Art. 359. Slander by deed.
The penalty of arresto
mayor in its maximum period to prision correctional in its
minimum period6 or a fine ranging from Twenty thousand
pesos (P20,000) to One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000)
shall be imposed upon any person who shall perform any
act not included and punished in this title, which shall
cast dishonor, discredit, or contempt upon another person.
If said act is not of a serious nature, the penalty shall be
arresto menor or a fine not exceeding Twenty thousand pesos
(P20,000). (As amended by RA. No. 10951)

What is slander by deed?

Slander by deed is a crime against honor which is committed
by performing any act which casts dishonor, discredit, or contempt
upon another person.

Elements:
1. That the offender performs any act not included in any other
crime against honor.
2. That such act is performed in the presence of other person or
persons.
3.

That such act casts dishonor, discredit or contempt upon the
offended party.

Slander by deed is of two kinds:
(a)

Simple slander by deed; and

(b)

Grave slander by deed, that is, which is of a serious nature.
‘See Appendix “A" Table of Penalties, No. 8.
1289

Art. 359

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Whether a certain slanderous act constitutes slander by deed of
a serious nature or not, depends on the social standing of the offended
party, the circumstances under which the act was committed, the

occasion, etc.

Slander by deed refers to performance of an act, not use of words.

Note that this crime involves an act, while libel or slander
involves words written or uttered.
Slapping the face of another Is slander by deed if the intention of
the accused is to cause shame and humiliation.

The evidence is clear that Renato Delfin did not merely push
Chuana aside, as he claims, but slapped her in order to ridicule and
shame her before other people. Said acts constitute the felony of
slander by deed, defined and penalized under Article 359 of the R.P.C.
(People v. Delfin, et al., 112 Phil. 807)
The act of slapping a Catholic priest before a large congregation
while officiating at a solemn religious ceremony invested with
sacerdotal dignity, constitutes slander by deed. (People v. Nosce, 60
Phil. 895)

The act of slapping the teacher constitutes a violation of Article
369, considering the shame and humiliation she must have suffered
at being slapped during a dance where many people were present.
(People v. Roque, CA., 40 O.G. 1710)
Fighting the offended party with intention to insult him is slander
by deed.

A street fight may give rise to slander by deed, if the intention of
the defendant in engaging the complainant to a fight is to insult and
to bring his opponent into contempt in the eyes of the public. (U.S.
v. Kanleon, 6 Phil. 489)
Pointing a dirty finger constitutes simple slander by deed.

Pointing a dirty finger ordinarily connotes the phrase uFuck
You,” which is similar to the expression uPuta” or “Putang Ina mo,”
in local parlance. Such expression was not held to be libelous in
Reyes v. People, 137 Phil. 112, 120 (1969), where the Court said
1290

TITLE THIRTEEN

Crimes Against Honor

Art. 359

that: “This is a common enough expression in the dialect that is
often employed, not really to slander but rather to express anger
or displeasure. It is seldom, if ever, taken in its literal sense by the
hearer, that is, as a reflection on the virtues of a mother.” Following
Reyes, and in light of the fact that there was a perceived provocation
coming from complainant, petitioner’s act of pointing a dirty finger
at complainant constitutes simple slander by deed, it appearing from
the factual milieu of the case that the act complained of was employed
by petitioner “to express anger or displeasure” at complainant for
procrastinating the approval of his leave monetization. While it may
have cast dishonor, discredit or contempt upon complainant, said act
is not of a serious nature. (Villanueva v. People, G.R. No. 160351,
April 10, 2006)

Determination of seriousness of slander by deed.
There is no fixed standard in determining whether a slander is
serious or not; hence, the courts have sufficient discretion to determine
the same, basing the finding on the attendant circumstances and
matters relevant thereto. (People v. Motita, CA., 59 O.G. 3020)
When the appellant saw the complainant making motions of
spitting, she felt so insulted and was incensed beyond endurance that
she spat on the face of the complainant. It is clear, therefore, that the
accused acted in the heat of passion and without thinking of the highly
offensive character of what she would do. Such act was not intended
to be taken in its natural result; if the spitting was deliberately done,
it would constitute the crime of grave slander by deed. Under the
circumstances of the case, the appellant was declared guilty of the
crime of slight slander by deed. (People v. Valmoria, CA., 64 O.G.
10991)

As a public official, petitioner, who was holding the position
of Councilor at that time, is hidebound to be an exemplar to society
against the use of intemperate language particularly because the
offended party was a Vice-Mayor. However, [the] [Court] cannot keep
a blind eye to the fact that scathing words were uttered by petitioner
in the heat of anger triggered by the fact that complainant refused,
without valid justification to approve the monetization of accrued
leave credits of petitioner, the crime committed is only slight oral
defamation. (Villanueva v. People, G.R. No. 160351, April 10, 2006)
1291

Art. 359

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Slander by deed and acts of lasciviousness, distinguished.
Kissing a girl in public and touching her breast without lewd
designs, committed by a rejected suitor to cast dishonor on the girl
was held to be slander by deed and not acts of lasciviousness. (People
v. Valencia, CA.-G.R. No. 4136-R, May 29, 1950)

Slander by deed and maltreatment, distinguished.
The nature and effects of the maltreatment determine the crime
committed. If the offended party suffered from shame or humiliation
caused by the maltreatment, it is slander by deed.

The act of holding a school teacher by the hair and shaking
him violently in the presence of school children and other teachers,
because he had stopped a boy who had been pursuing another, is not
maltreatment under paragraph 3, Article 266, but slander by deed,
because (1) of the public office held by the offended party, and (2) the
nature and effects of the maltreatment inflicted upon him. (People v.
Velez, G.R. No. 41234, August 31, 1934)
Unjust vexation, slander by deed, and act of lasciviousness,
distinguished.
The common denominator present in unjust vexation, slander by
deed, and act of lasciviousness is irritation or annoyance. Without any
other concurring factor, the offense would be merely unjust vexation
because unjust vexation is equated with anything that annoys or
irritates another without justification. If in addition to the irritation or
annoyance, there was attendant publicity and dishonor or contempt,
the offense would be slander by deed. (Art. 359, R.P.C.) However, if,
in addition to the annoyance or irritation, there was present any of
the circumstances provided for in Article 335 of the Code, on rape,
i.e., use of force or intimidation, deprivation of reason or otherwise
rendering the offended party unconscious, or if the offended party was
under 12 years of age, together with lewd designs, the crime would
be act of lasciviousness. (People v. Motita, supra)

Slander by deed; When offended party’s complaint not necessary.

Under the last paragraph of Article 360 of the R.P.C., only

defamation imputing crimes which may not be prosecuted de oficio
1292

TITLE THIRTEEN

Crimes Against Honor

Art. 360

under Article 344, i.e., adultery, concubinage, seduction, abduction,

rape and acts of lasciviousness, must be prosecuted upon complaint by
the offended party. (People u. Juan B. Santos and Francisco Cuballa,
52 O.G. No 1,203; People v. Ariel, G.R. No. L-8393, April 27, 1956) So
that where no imputation of any of the crimes mentioned in Article
344 is made, the complaint by the offended party is not necessary.
(Vda. de Corostiza u. People, G.R. No. L-909, August 28, 1956; People
v. Marquez, 68 Phil. 506) Likewise, the imputation of a vice or defect
which does not constitute a crime at all is not within the exception.
(People v. Anel, G.R. No. L-8393, April 27, 1956) As the grave slander
by deed charged in the case at bar does not impute any crime, public
or private, to the offended party, his complaint was not necessary to
confer jurisdiction upon the court. (People v. Duran, Jr., 58 O.G. 660)

Moral damages awarded do not determine the Jurisdiction of the
court.

The claim for moral damages is only an incident to a criminal
case. If awarded by the court, it is not a penalty for the commission
of a crime, nor a fine that is provided for by law as a penalty for the

offense which should determine the jurisdiction of the court. (People
v. Tejero, CA., 59 O.G. 738)

Art. 360

The persons responsible for libel are:
1. The person who publishes, exhibits or causes the publication
or exhibition of any defamation in writing or similar means.
(Art. 360, par. 1)

2.

The author or editor of a book or pamphlet.

3.

The editor or business manager of a daily newspaper magazine
or serial publication. (Art. 360, par. 2)

4.

The owner of the printing plant which publishes a libelous
article with his consent and all other persons who in any way
participate in or have connection with its publication. (U.S.
v. Ortiz, 8 Phil. 752)

The person who publishes libelous letter written by the offended
party is liable.
A, a woman, sent a love letter to B, a man, containing very
intimate expressions of sentiment. To a third person the contents of
said letter would be ridiculous. B, after breaking his relation with A,
published the letter. Is B liable for libel? Yes. The prime requisite of
the crime of libel is not necessarily the composing of the article, but
the publishing of it.
Liability of the editor is the same as that of the author.

The editor of a daily newspaper, magazine or serial publication
is liable for the defamations contained therein to the same extent as
if he were the author thereof. (People v. Bailo, et al., CA., 37 O.G.
2373)

Lack of participation in the preparation of libelous articles does not
shield the persons responsible for libel from liability.
The claim that they had no participation does not shield them
from liability. The provision in the R.P.C. does not provide absence of
participation as a defense, but rather plainly and specifically states
the responsibility of those involved in publishing newspapers and
other periodicals. It is not a matter of whether they conspired in
preparing and publishing the subject articles, because the law simply
so states that they are liable as they were the author.

1296

Art. 360

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Neither the publisher nor the editors can disclaim liability for
libelous articles that appear on their paper by simply saying they
had no participation in the preparation of the same. They cannot
say that Tulfo was all alone in the publication of Remote, on which
the subject articles appeared, when they themselves clearly hold
positions of authority in the newspaper, or in the case of Pichay, as
the president in the publishing company.
As Tulfo cannot simply say that he is not liable because he did not
fulfill his responsibility as a journalist, the other petitioners cannot
simply say that they are not liable because they did not fulfill their
responsibilities as editors and publishers. An editor or manager of
a newspaper, who has active charge and control of its management,
conduct, and policy, generally is held to be equally liable with the
owner for the publication therein of a libelous article. (Smith v. Utley,
92 Wis, 133, 65 NW 744; Faulkner v. Martin, 133 NJL 605, 45 A2d 596;
World Pub. Co. v. Minahan, 70 Okla, 107, 173 P 815) On the theory
that it is the duty of the editor or manager to know and control the
contents of the paper (Faulkner, supra), it is held that said person
cannot evade responsibility by abandoning the duties to employees
(World Pub. Co., supra), so that it is immaterial
whether or not the
editor or manager knew the contents of the publication (Faulkner,
supra; Goudy v. Dayron Newspapers, Inc., 14 Ohio App 2d 207, 43
Ohio Ops 2d 444, 237 NE2d 909). In Fermin v. People, G.R. No.
157643, March 20, 2008, the Court held that the publisher could not
escape liability by claiming lack of participation in the preparation
and publication of a libelous article.
Under Article 360 of the R.P.C., as Tulfo, the author of the subject
articles, has been found guilty of libel, so too must the editors and
president Remate, the paper on which the subject articles
appeared.
(Tulfo u. People, G.R. No. 161032, September 16, 2008)

Where the libelous article is printed and first published;

or
(2)

Where any of the offended parties actually resides at the
time of the commission of the offense.

Where one of the offended parties is a public officer.
Where one of the offended parties is a public officer whose office
is in the City of Manila at the time of the commission of the offense,
the action shall be filed in the Court of First Instance of the City of
Manila or of the city or province where the libelous article is printed
and first published.
In case such public officer does not hold office in the City of
Manila, the action shall be filed in the Court of First Instance of the
province or city where he held office at the time of the commission of
the offense or where the libelous article is printed and first published.

In case one of the offended parties is a private Individual.
In case one of the offended parties is a private individual, the
action shall be filed in the Court of First Instance of the province or
city where he actually resides at the time of the commission of the
offense or where the libelous matter is printed and first published.
The limitation of the choices of venue, as introduced into the
Penal Code through its amendment by R.A. No. 4363, was intended
“to minimize or limit the filing of out-of-town libel suits to protect an

Art. 360

alleged offender from “hardships, inconveniences and harassments”
and, furthermore, to protect “the interest of the public service”
where one of the offended parties is a public officer. The intent of
the law is clear: a libeled public official must sue in the court of
the locality where he holds office, in order that the prosecution of
the action should interfere as little as possible with the discharge
of his official duties and labors. The only alternative allowed him
by law is to prosecute those responsible for the libel in the place
where the offending article was printed and first published. Here,
the law tolerates the interference with libeled officers’ duties only
for the sake of avoiding unnecessary harassment of the accused.
Since the offending publication was not printed in the Philippines,
the alternative venue was not open to respondents Mayor Villegas of
Manila and Undersecretary of Finance Enrile, who were the offended
parties. (Time, Inc. v. Reyes, 39 SCRA 303)

The fourth paragraph of Article 360 of the R.P.C. requiring the
complaint in an action for defamation imputing a private offense to
be expressly filed by the offended party, applies not only to written
but also to oral defamation.
The fiscal filed an information, charging the accused with “telling
some people in the neighborhood that said Fausta Bravo (a married
woman) was a paramour of one Sangalang, a man not her husband.”
Fausta Bravo did not subscribe to a complaint.
Held: Since the accused imputed to Fausta Bravo the commission
of adultery, a crime which cannot be prosecuted de oficio, the
information filed by the fiscal cannot confer jurisdiction upon the
court. (People v. Padilla, 56 O.G. 3845)

Civil and criminal actions must be filed in the same court.

344)

The civil action shall be filed in the same court where the
criminal action is filed and vice versa. (Art. 360, par. 3, as amended
by R.A. No. 4363)

The alleged premarital relations of the offended husband and
wife could be a vice or defect, but it is not an imputation of adultery or
concubinage, or any of the other crimes which may not be prosecuted
de oficio. (Mangila v. Lantin, 30 SCRA 81) Likewise, if adultery is
not definitely imputed, the libel may be prosecuted upon information
signed and filed by the fiscal. (People v. Halili, CA., 57 O.G. 3135)

Exclusive jurisdiction of the court
The court where the criminal action or civil action for damages
is first filed shall acquire jurisdiction to the exclusion of other courts.
(Art. 360, par. 3, as amended by RA.
No. 4363; People v. Felisa Te,
et al., 60 O.G. 3593)

Considering the third proviso of R.A. No. 1289 which states that
“the court where the criminal action or civil action for damages is first
filed shall acquire jurisdiction to the exclusion of other courts,” it is
clear that the Court of First Instance of Manila, where the information
for libel was filed on May 18, 1955, excluded any and all other courts
of equal category. The Court of First Instance ofBatangas, therefore,
did not have jurisdiction in taking cognizance of the present case, the
information based on the same libelous publication having been filed
in that Court on July 8, 1955. (People v. Felisa Te, et
al., 60 O.G. 3593)
Offended party must file complaint for defamation imputing a
crime which cannot be prosecuted de oficio.
1298

Actual damages need not be proved, at least where the
publication is libelous per se (Phee v. La Vanguardia, supra; Jimenez

Art. 360

Although moral damages may undoubtedly also be recovered
under Article 2219 of the new Civil Code, there is a holding enunciated
before said Code went into effect, that the right to recover punitive
and exemplary damages had been abolished by the R.P.C. which
repealed Act No. 277, Section 11 of which granted such right. (See
Lu Chu Sing v. Lu Tiong Gui, supra) It would seem, however, that if
the action is one based on quasi-delict (as in the Lopez case, supra),
exemplary or corrective damages may also be awarded under Article
2231 of the New Civil Code.

Respondent sufficiently justified his claim for damages when he

show his face in government offices.” He is entitled to moral damages
of P100,000.00 and exemplary damages of P20.000. (Almendros, Jr.
v. Almendros, G.R. No. 179491, January 14, 2015)

Moral damages amounting to P500.000 was awarded to the
offended party, a high-ranking officer of an educational institution
whom Visitacion accused of criminal or improper conduct. Such

accusations were not made known only to the victim but also to other
persons such as her staff and employees of a bank the school had
transactions with. Thus, Punongbayan’s reputation was besmirched
and she was humiliated before her subordinates and other people.

For liability in damages to arise from an alleged libelous
publication without offending press freedom, there is need to prove
that the publication was made with actual malice that is, with the
knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it was
false or not. (Lopez v. Court of Appeals, 34 SCRA 116)

Clearly, her reputation was tarnished after being accused of unsavory
and questionable behavior, primarily attributable to Visitacion’s
act of circulating the letter imputing wrongdoing of Punongbayan.

Illustration of damages recoverable In defamation:

In awarding damages in libel cases, the court is given ample

Article 2219 of the Civil Code expressly authorizes the recovery

defamation. However, “while no proof of pecuniary loss is necessary
in order that moral damages may be awarded, x x x it is nevertheless
essential that the claimant should satisfactorily show the existence of

v. People, 73 Phil. 700)

TITLE THIRTEEN
Crimes Against Honor

Art. 361

Proof of truth.
The proof of the truth of the accusation cannot be made to rest

upon mere hearsay, rumors or suspicion.
It must rest upon positive, direct evidence upon which a definite
finding may be made by the Court. (See U.S. v. Sotto, 38 Phil. 666)
But probable cause for belief in the truth of the statement is
sufficient.
When evidence of the truth of imputation not admissible.

Illustration:

Example of No. 2:

A stated in the presence of some people that B, a government
official was in the habit of drinking intoxicating liquor during office
hours and that he was always in a boisterous condition. In case B
should file a complaint against A for defamation, the latter can prove
the truth of the charge.
Both public interest and the good of the service demand that a
drunkard be barred from the service.

But when the imputation involves the private life of a government
employee which is not related to the discharge of his official duties,
the offender cannot prove the truth thereof.
"In such cases if the defendant proves the truth of the imputation
made by him, he shall be acquitted."

The third paragraph of Article 361 must have reference to the

two cases referred to in the second paragraph where proof of the
truth may be admitted, namely: (1) if the act or omission imputed
constitutes a crime; and (2) if the imputation not constituting a crime
is made against Government employees with respect to facts related

to the discharge of their duties.

The question may arise whether it is necessary to show that the
accused who proved the truth of the imputation published it with good
motives and for justifiable ends in order that he may be acquitted.

It is believed that since the accused did the public a service,
proof of his good motives and justifiable ends is not necessary.
1302

A stated before several persons that B, a private individual,
is a drunkard or is suffering from contagious disease. In case A is
prosecuted for defamation, he will not be allowed to prove the truth
that B was really a drunkard or suffering from some communicable
diseases.

In a case, the defendant made several imputations against Felix
Manalo. Some of them insinuated the commission of crimes and some
did not constitute crimes. The defendant was allowed to prove the
truth of the imputations constituting crimes but he was not allowed
to prove the truth of the imputations constituting crimes.
There is no merit in petitioner’s contention that he had been
unlawfully deprived of his right to prove the truth of the libelous
imputation. The Court of Appeals has rightfully held that proof of
the truth of those acts imputed to the offended party which do not
constitute a crime cannot be admitted, since he is not a government
employee, and, consequently, none of those imputations can have any
reference to facts related to the discharge by a government employee
of his official duties. This is in consonance with the second paragraph
of Article 361 which limits the scope of the general rule set forth in
the first paragraph of the same article. (Tumang v. People, 73 Phil.
700)

It was held in Imperial, et al. v. The Manila Times Publishing
Co., Inc., et al., C.A., 67 O.G. 5711, that truth is a good defense in

and employees with respect to facts related to the discharge of their
official duties. (Art. 361, par. 2, R.P.C.; People v. Salumbides, CA-G.R.
No. 14224-R, January 22, 1960; People v. Trilanes, 10 O.G. 393) In
pari materia is the ruling laid down by the Supreme Court in the case
of U.S. v. Bustos, 37 Phil. 741, to wit:
“Under our Libel Law, defamatory remarks against
government employees with respect to facts related to the
discharge of their official duties will not constitute libel if the
defendant proves the truth of the imputation.”

Three requisites of defense in defamation:

It will be noted that in the first paragraph of Article 361, proof
of the truth is not enough. It is also required that the matter charged
as libelous was published with good motives and for justifiable ends.
1.

“If it appears that the matter charged as libelous is true.”

2.

The proof of the truth in defamation is limited only (1) to
or
act omission constituting a crime and, (2) to act or omission
of a public officer which, although not constituting a crime,
is related to the discharge of his duties.
“It was published with good motives.”

3.

Whether good motives exist is a question to be determined
by the court by taking into consideration not only the intention
of the author of the defamatory matter but all the other
circumstances of each particular case.
“And for justifiable ends.”
A published libelous article against B, stating, among
other things, that B as a captain of the Constabulary,
compelled a municipal president to kneel before the bishop. A
claimed that he published the same to promote the separation
of the church and state.

Held: The goodness of the intention is not always sufficient by
itself to justify the publication of an injurious fact; thus, the goodness
of the end is not a sufficient motive to
warrant the employment of
illicit means to obtain it. (U.S. v. Prautch, 10 Phil. 562)

1304

TITLE THIRTEEN
Crimes Against Honor

Art. 361

There could possibly be no good motives and justifiable ends in
picturing a lady before the public as having such loose morals as to
pose in the nude either alone or with a man. (People v. Salumbides,
et al., CA., 55 O.G. 2638)
“With good intention and justifiable motive.”

A, a nurse, was treating a patient suffering from gonorrhea, a
venereal disease. She believed that the patient had been contaminated
by her husband. When the husband came to the house, A said,“This
is the result of your foolishness, you contaminated your wife with
venereal disease.” This remark was made upstairs within the hearing
of several persons therein.

Held: That statement concerning the cause of the sickness of
the patient was done in private and only as a precautionary measure
to prevent further contamination. Even if it was overheard by other
persons, it was not motivated by malice on the part of A. There was
no showing that she was inspired by any feeling of spite or ill-will
towards the complainants. A, being a registered nurse and acting
under proper medical instructions, considered it her duty to warn
complainants of the dangers of the disease from which she believed
they were suffering. The warning is in the nature of a privileged
communication.
An imputation that a person has a contagious disease might,
under ordinary circumstances, be defamatory, but loses such
character when made with good intention and justifiable motive.
(People v. Chavez, CA., 53 O.G. 8886)
Good motives and justifiable ends constitute a defense insofar
as they negative malice. There is no libel if there is no malice.
Retraction may mitigate the damages.
When a periodical gives currency, whether innocently or
otherwise, to a false and defamatory statement concerning any person,
it is under both a legal and moral duty to check the propagation of
such statement as soon as practicable by publishing a retraction.

In order to have the desired effect, the retraction should contain

Thus, the author or the editor of a publication who distorts,
mutilates or discolors the official proceedings reported by him, or
add comments thereon to cast aspersion on the character of the

The plaintiff was pictured as having stabbed another person in
a fit of jealousy as his querida had abandoned him for said individual.
This was a case of mistaken identity. The defendant contended that
the publication was an honest mistake.

Held: It would serve only to mitigate damages where the article
is libelous per se. (Phee v. La Vanguardia, 45 Phil. 211)

Note: In this case, the offended party informed the defendant of
the mistake, but the latter took no step to correct it.

INCRIMINATORY MACHINATIONS
What are the felonies under Incriminatory machinations?
They are:

1.

Incriminating innocent person. (Art. 363)

2.

Intriguing against honor. (Art. 364)

—

Any person
Art. 363. Incriminating innocent person.
who, by any act not constituting perjury, shall directly
incriminate or impute to an innocent person the commission
of a crime, shall be punished by arresto mayor.1

False accusation is defamation or perjury under the Revised Penal
Code.
According to the plaintiffs, it is malicious prosecution or false
accusation; according to the defendant and the lower court, it is
defamation or libel.

Let us first consider plaintiffs’ contention. Articles 326 and 327
of the old Penal Code, which respectively defined and penalized the
crime of false accusation, were not re-enacted in the R.P.C. but, since
the old Penal Code has been repealed, they must be deemed to have
been abrogated.
Article 363 of the R.P.C., which penalizes any person who by any
act not constituting perjury shall directly incriminate or impute to
an innocent person the commission of a crime, does not apply to false
accusations but to acts tending directly to cause false accusations,
such as “planting” evidence and the like. (People v. Rivera, 59 Phil.
236)

Elements:

In the case last cited (page 242), this [C]ourt said:

1.

That the offender performs an act.

2.

That by such act he directly incriminates or imputes to an
innocent person the commission of a crime.

3.

That such act does not constitute perjury.

This article is limited to “planting” evidence and the like, which
tend directly to cause false prosecution.

This article is limited to acts of “planting" evidence and the
like, which do not in themselves constitute false prosecutions but tend
directly to cause false prosecutions. (People v. Rivera, 59 Phil. 236)
A, taking advantage of the fact that B was in the toilet while his
(B's) coat was hanging on the back of a chair, placed a small bottle of

opium in the pocket of the coat. Then A called a policeman and told
the latter that B had a bottle of opium in his pocket.

It is to be noted that Article 326 of the old Penal Code
contains the provision that the accuser could be prosecuted only
on the order of the court, when the court was convinced upon trial
of the principal cause that there was sufficient basis for a charge
of false accusation. Article 363 of the R.P.C. contains no such
safeguard. If [the Court] extended said article by interpretation
to administrative and judicial proceedings, it is apparent that we
would open the door to a flood of prosecutions in cases where the
defendants were acquitted. There is no reason to believe that the
Legislature intended such a result.

Under the R.P.C. one who falsely accuses another of a crime
may be held liable either for libel or for perjury, depending upon the
manner or form in which the act is committed. (Lu Chu Sing and
Lu Tian Chiong v. Lu Tiong Gui, 76 Phil. 674, citing the concurring
opinion of Justice Diaz in People v. Rivera, supra)

bill. It should be observed that without detaining, investigating
and searching Marcial it would have been impossible, if not
difficult, for the accused to plant the marked one peso bill, because
then they could not have simply held Marcial and placed the
marked one peso bill in his pocket, without the latter vigorously
protesting the act. Besides, if the accused simply held Marcial and
planted in his pocket the marked one peso bill without arresting
him, they could not have surely and easily discovered what they
were up to. Indeed, the accused had to arrest Marcial, even in
the absence of the valid reason, so that under the semblance of a
police investigation, they could get whatever money was inside
his pockets and include in it the marked one peso bill. In short,
the accused had to arrest Marcial so that he could be detained
and pretending to investigate him, search his person and thereby
have possibly accomplished their purpose, because Marcial would
have the opportunity of planting the marked one peso bill among
his belongings."

Art. 363

1.

2.

Incriminating an innocent person is committed by performing
an act by which the offender directly incriminates or imputes
to an innocent person the commission of a crime; in perjury,
the gravamen of the offense is the imputation itself, falsely
made, before an officer.
Incriminating an innocent person is limited to the act of
planting evidence and the like, in order to incriminate an
innocent person; while perjury is the giving of false statement
under oath or the making of a false affidavit, imputing to a
person the commission of a crime. fSee People v. Rivera, 59
Phil. 236)

Incriminatory machinations distinguished from defamation.

In incriminatory machinations, the offender does not avail
himself of written or spoken words in besmirching the victim’s
reputation, as would be in the case of defamation. In defamation,
the imputation made by the offender must be public and malicious,
and, besides, must be calculated to cause the dishonor, discredit
or contempt of the aggrieved party; this is not so in the case of
incriminatory machinations. (Guevara)
Is there a complex crime of incriminating an innocent person
through unlawful arrest?

The allegation in the information that the accused committed
the complex crime of incriminatory machinations thru unlawful arrest
and the allegation that the act of planting the incriminatory evidence
took place during the supposed investigation after the unlawful arrest
are bases for the logical assumption in the absence of evidence to
the contrary, that the two acts imputed to the accused had closely
followed each other, and that the former was a necessary means to
commit the latter. Thus, a complex crime was alleged.

—

As the Solicitor argued

—

Art. 364

Therefore, the trial court erred when it ordered the dismissal
of the case, on the ground that the information alleged two distinct
offenses of incriminating an innocent person and unlawful arrest. The
two offenses form a complex crime, which is only one crime. (People

trickery. It is akin to slander by deed, in that the offender does not
avail directly of written or spoken words, pictures, or caricatures
to ridicule his victim but of some ingenious, crafty and secret plot,
producing the same effect. (People v. Fontanilla, CA., 56 O.G. 1931)
Incriminating an innocent person distinguished from Intriguing
against honor.

In incriminating an innocent person, the offender performs
an act by which he directly incriminates or imputes to an innocent
person the commission of a crime; in intriguing against honor, the
offender resorts to an intrigue for the purpose of blemishing the honor
or reputation of another person.
Intriguing against honor distinguished from defamation.

While R was sitting on a bench at the entrance of the City Fiscal’s
Office, the accused F approached her and asked for the reason of her
presence there. When R answered that she was in the company of B,

where the source or the author of the derogatory information cannot
be determined and the defendant borrows the same and, without
subscribing to the truth thereof, passes it to others, the defendant’s
act is one of intriguing against honor. (People v. Pelayo, Jr., CA., 64
O.G. 1993)

Is F guilty of the crime of intriguing against honor, or of the
crime of defamation?
Held: Defamation is defined as “a public and malicious
imputation of a crime, or of a vice or defect, real or imaginary, or any
act, omission, condition, status, or circumstance tending to cause the
dishonor, discredit, or contempt of a natural or juridical person, or to
blacken the memory of one who is dead.” (Art. 353, R.P.C.) Having
this in mind, we hold that the case is one of defamation and not that
of intriguing against honor which may be committed by means which
“consists of some tricky and secret plot.” (People v. Fontanilla, CA.,

56 O.G. 1931)

Note: In view of this ruling, gossiping, which is done by availing
directly of spoken words, is not intriguing against honor.

TITLE FOURTEEN

The quasi-offenses under Article 365 are committed in four ways:

If the act performed would not constitute a grave or less grave

defines intentional felony, Article 365 is not applicable. There is no

2.

By committing through reckless imprudence any act which,
had it been intentional, would constitute a grave or less grave
felony or light felony. (Par. 1)
By committing through simple imprudence or negligence an
act which would otherwise constitute a grave or a less serious
felony. (Par. 2)

3.

By causing damage to the property of another through reckless
imprudence or simple imprudence or negligence. (Par. 3)

By causing through simple imprudence or negligence some
wrong which, if done maliciously, would have constituted a
light felony. (Par. 4)

“Act which, had it been Intentional, would constitute a grave felony
x x x; x x x a less grave felony x x x a light felony.”

Parricide (Art. 246) or homicide (Art. 249), if committed with
intent to kill (intentional), is a grave felony because the first is
punishable by reclusion perpetua to death and the second is punishable
by reclusion temporal, both afflictive penalties and death is capital
punishment. If either is committed through reckless imprudence or
negligence, Article 365 is applicable.

Less serious physical injuries (Art. 265) is a less grave felony,
because it is punishable by arresto mayor, a correctional penalty.
Slight physical injuries is a light felony (Art. 266), because it is
punishable by arresto menor or a fine not exceeding P200.00. If either
is committed with malice (intentional), Article 265 or Article 266 is
applicable. If committed through reckless imprudence or negligence,

(31 Phil. 414)

Facts: The accused, suddenly and without saying a word, drew
the bolo from the sheath which Isidoro Benter was carrying at his
belt. Isidoro Benter instinctively caught at the bolo to retain it. In
catching the bolo with his right hand, the bolo, in sliding through
with all its edge, wounded him across the entire width of the palm of
the hand in a direction perpendicular to the base of the fingers. The
wound was not healed for more than 40 days.
Held: The accused is not criminally liable, either for intentional
serious physical injuries or for serious physical injuries through
reckless imprudence. The law speaks of a person who by reckless
imprudence commits an act which, if maliciously performed, would
constitute a grave (less grave, or light) felony. But the act of the
accused in the case at bar does not constitute a felony, grave or menos
grave. The only act which he performed was to take, or attempt to
take from its sheath, the bolo which Benter was carrying at his belt,
and that was an act which is not defined in any law as being a crime.

for homicide through reckless imprudence. (People v. Cusi, C.A., 68
O.G. 2777)

If the accused, in drawing the bolo from its scabbard, or if any
other person in taking a revolver from the belt of a person carrying it,
should, by not employing proper care, wound the latter, clearly, then,
he would have to answer for his act of injuring the other, as guilty
of having caused an injury without malice and merely by reckless
negligence by reason of not using proper care. But the defendant did
not wound Benter. It was the latter who, by his own act in catching
hold of the edge of the blade of the bolo, wounded himself. Or, the
bolo, by its edge or by its own weight, in slipping from Benter’s hand,
because he did not grasp it firmly, wounded Benter; the bolo did this,
not the defendant.

For firing a warning shot in the air without the least intention of
causing injury to anyone, but without taking the necessary precaution
demanded by the circumstances as to time and place, and in the
process hit and killed a bystander, the accused, who is a policeman,
cannot be held liable under Article 249 of the R.P.C. for intentional
homicide, but instead is liable under Article 365 of the same Code

Art. 365

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Quasi-offenses are distinct species of crime.

The notion that quasi-offenses, whether reckless or simple, are
distinct species of crime, separately defined and penalized under the
framework of our penal laws, is nothing new. As early as the middle
of the last century, the Supreme Court already sought to bring
clarity to this field by rejecting in Quizon v. Justice of the Peace of
Pampanga the proposition that “reckless imprudence is not a crime
in itself but simply a way of committing it x x x” on three points of
analysis: (1) the object of punishment in quasi-crimes (as opposed to
intentional crimes); (2) the legislative intent to treat quasi-crimes as
distinct offenses (as opposed to subsuming them under the mitigating
circumstance of minimal intent) and; (3) the different penalty
structures for quasi-crimes and intentional crimes:
The proposition (inferred from Art. 3 of the R.P.C.) that “reckless
imprudence” is not a crime in itself but simply a way of committing it
and merely determines a lower degree of criminal liability is too broad
to deserve unqualified assent. There are crimes that by their structure
cannot be committed through imprudence: murder, treason, robbery,
malicious mischief, etc. In truth, criminal negligence in our R.P.C. is
treated as a mere quasi offense, and dealt with separately from willful
offenses. It is not a mere question of classification or terminology.
In intentional crimes, the act itself is punished; in negligence or
imprudence, what is principally penalized is the mental attitude
or condition behind the act, the dangerous recklessness, lack
of care or foresight, the imprudencia punible. x x x

Were criminal negligence but a modality in the commission
of felonies, operating only to reduce the penalty therefor, then it
would be absorbed in the mitigating circumstances of Article 13,
specially the lack of intent to commit so grave a wrong as the one
actually committed. Furthermore, the theory would require that the
corresponding penalty should be fixed in proportion to the penalty
prescribed for each crime when committed willfully. For each penalty
for the willful offense, there would then be a corresponding penalty for
the negligent variety. But instead, our Revised Penal Code (Art. 365)
fixes the penalty for reckless imprudence at arresto mayor maximum,
to prision correctional [medium], if the willful act would constitute
a grave felony, notwithstanding that the penalty for the latter could
range all the way from prision mayor to death, according to the case.
It can be seen that the actual penalty for criminal negligence bears

TITLE FOURTEEN
Quasi-Offenses

Art. 365

no relation to the individual willful crime, but is set in relation to a
whole class, or series, of crimes.
This explains why the technically correct way to allege quasicrimes is to state that their commission results in damage, either to
person or property. (Ivler v. Modesto-San Pedro, G.R. No. 172716,
November 17, 2010, 635 SCRA 19)
It should be “reckless imprudence resulting in homicide,” or “simple
imprudence causing damages to property.”

When a person, by reckless imprudence, caused the death of
another, the strict technical offense is more accurately, “reckless
imprudence resulting in homicide.”
When a person, by simple imprudence or negligence, caused
damage to the property of another, the strict technical offense is more
accurately, “simple imprudence causing damages to property.”

Criminal negligence in our R.P.C. is treated as a mere quasi¬
offense, and dealt separately from willful offenses. It is not a mere
question of classification or terminology. In intentional crimes, the
act itself is punished; in negligence or imprudence, what is principally
penalized is the mental attitude or condition behind the act, the
dangerous recklessness, lack of care or foresight; the “imprudencia
punible.” Much of the confusion has arisen from the common use of
such descriptive phrases as “homicide thru reckless imprudence,”
and the like; when the strict technical offense is more accurately,
“reckless imprudence resulting in homicide,” or “simple imprudence
causing damages to property.”

Our R.P.C. (Art. 365) fixes the penalty for reckless imprudence at
arresto mayor maximum, to prision correctional minimum (medium)
if the willful act would constitute a grave felony, notwithstanding
that the penalty for the latter could range all the way from prision
mayor to death, according to the case. It can be seen that the actual
penalty for criminal negligence bears no relation to the individual
willful crime, but is set in relation to a whole class, or series ofcrimes.

Negligence under the Revised Penal Code and that under the Civil
Code.
A negligent act causing damage may produce civil liability
arising from crime or create an action for quasi-delict under the
Civil Code. The injured party may choose which remedy to enforce.
He cannot recover damages twice for the same act or omission of the
defendant. (Art. 2177, New Civil Code)

Art. 365

Elements of reckless Imprudence.
1.

That the offender does or fails to do an act.

2.

That the doing of or the failure to do that act is voluntary.

3.

That it be without malice.

4.

That material damage results.

The Penal Code does not draw a well-defined demarcation line
between negligent acts that are delictual and those which are quasidelictual. It is possible that a negligent act may be delictual and
quasi-delictual at the same time. (Barredo v. Garcia, 73 Phil. 607)
Negligence in Civil Law may arise from contract (Art. 1170
culpa contractual) or from tort (Art. 2176 culpa aquiliana).

5.

That there is inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the
offender, taking into consideration

Imprudence and negligence, distinguished.
Imprudence indicates a deficiency of action; negligence indicates
a deficiency of perception.
Hence, failure in precaution is termed imprudence. Failure in
advertence is known as negligence.
The wrongful acts may be avoided on two levels: (1) by paying
proper attention and using due diligence in foreseeing them, and (2)
by taking the necessary precaution once they are foreseen.
Failure to do the first is negligence. Failure to do the second is
imprudence.

Reckless imprudence, defined.

Reckless imprudence consists in voluntarily, but without malice,
doing or failing to do an act from which material damage results by
reason of inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the person
performing or failing to perform such act, taking into consideration his
employment or occupation, degree of intelligence, physical condition
and other circumstances regarding persons, time, and place.
Simple imprudence, defined.

Simple imprudence consists in the lack of precaution displayed
in those cases in which the damage impending to be caused is not
immediate nor the danger clearly manifest.

reckless negligence. The expression force majeure has reference to an
event which cannot be foreseen, or which being foreseen is inevitable.
It implies an extraordinary circumstance independent of the will of
the actor. (People v. Eleazar, et al., 60 O.G. 1728)

Art. 365

3.

Doing or failing to do an act.

Where the charge is that the accused allowed their cows and
carabaos to roam and/or graze in the premises of the land planted
to coco trees and bananas tenanted by the complainant inspite of
several warnings that the latter made to the accused, the accused
may be convicted of damage to property thru reckless imprudence
if it is their reckless imprudence in letting loose their animals that
resulted in damage to property. (People v. Lumo, et al., C-A., 69 O.G.
3983) Failing to keep the animals in the corral or to keep them tied
may also constitute reckless imprudence.
Lack of foresight, as negligence.
Leaving a loaded firearm on a chair within the reach of a child
then playing in the place, making it possible for the child to pick it
up and play with it, and causing his death by its discharge, constitute
homicide through reckless negligence. (Viada, Vol. Ill, p. 629)

Test of negligence.
The test for determining whether a person is negligent in doing
an act whereby injury or damage results to the person or property of
another is this: Would a prudent man, in the position of the person to
whom negligence is attributed, foresee harm to the person injured as
a reasonable consequence of the course about to be pursued? If so, the
law imposes a duty on the actor to refrain from that course or to take
precaution against its mischievous results, and the failure to do so
constitutes negligence. Reasonable foresight of harm, followed by the
ignoring of the admonition bom of this provision, is the constitutive
fact in negligence. (Picart v. Smith, 37 Phil. 809)

Quasi-Ofienses

Art. 365

Whether tire blowout is fortuitous event.

The ruling of the Supreme Court in Rodriguez v. Red Line
Transportation, C.A.-G.R. No. 8136, December 29, 1954 and People
v. Palapad, C.A.-G.R. No. 18480, June 27, 1958, not only are not
binding on the Supreme Court but were based on considerations
quite
different from those that obtain in the case at bar. The appellate court
there made no findings of any specific acts of negligence on the part
of the defendants and confined itself to the question of whether a tire
blowout, by itself alone and without a showing as to the causative
factors would generate liability. In the present case, the cause of the
blowout was known. The inner tube of the left front tire, according
to petitioner’s own evidence and as found by the Court of Appeals,
was pressed between the inner circle of the left wheel and the rim
which had slipped out of the wheel. This was, said court correctly
held, a mechanical defect of the conveyance or a fault in its equipment
which was easily discoverable if the bus had been subjected to a more
thorough or rigid check-up before it took to the road that morning.
(La Mallorca v. De Jesus, G.R. No. L-21486, May
14, 1966, pp. 12-13)
Failure to detect mechanical defect is negligence, if accused driver
assumed the duty of inspecting the vehicle.

Where immediate personal harm or damage to property,
preventable by the exercise of reasonable care, is threatened upon
another by reason of the course of conduct about to be pursued by the
actor, his failure to use reasonable care to prevent injury constitutes

Accused-appellant, who admitted it his duty, in the absence of
the mechanic, to inspect the truck before taking it to the road, did
not make a thorough and rigid check-up of the truck, for, otherwise,
he would have discovered the mechanical defect and the fault in its
equipment which became the cause of the failure of the brakes.
A driver who assumed the duty of inspecting the vehicle before
taking it to the road is negligent if he failed to detect the mechanical
defect of the vehicle which an ordinary, experienced driver would have
discovered, and such mechanical defect was the cause of the injury
or damage to another. This rule throws upon the drivers of motor
vehicles the entire responsibility of the soundness of the vehicles they
are driving and compels them to know and to be certain about it. A

increasing perils and would make it easier for the drivers at fault to
escape liability by the simple expedient of disclaiming knowledge of
the defects of their vehicles. (People v. Martinez, 16 CA. Rep. 1115)
When the driver could not have known the defect of brakes, he Is
not liable.
The driver of a motor vehicle is not guilty of negligence and
therefore not criminally liable in case of an accident due to failure of
the brakes of his vehicle, if he did not know or could not have known
that the brakes were defective. (People v. Villacorta, 6 CA. Rep.

A was driving his car. A saw that the vehicle of B was approaching
from the opposite direction and was so near that there was no
room for him to pass, because there was a carromata ahead
of him. For overtaking and passing that carromata, resulting
in the collision between his car and the vehicle of B, A did not
take the necessary precaution to avoid damage to the property
of another. (People v. Enriquez, CA., 40 O.G. 765)

2.

When a driver, because of unreasonably fast driving and carrying
a number of passengers in excess of that permitted by law and
regulations, permitting two of his passengers to stand on the
right running board of the car, caused his car to collide with
another, as a result of which a passenger died, he did not take
precautions and the lack of precaution was inexcusable. (People
v. Ole femes, CA., 40 O.G. 765)
Appellant showed an inexcusable lack of precaution when he
disregarded a traffic sign cautioning motorists to slow down
and drove his vehicle in full speed despite being aware that he
was traversing a school zone and pedestrians were crossing the
street. He should have observed the diligence of a reasonably
prudent man by slackening his speed and proceeding cautiously
while passing the area. (Garcia v. Romano, G.R. No. 153591,
February 23, 2004)
Here, the car was clearly ahead of the trailer truck prior to the
collision. Hence, it was incumbent upon the appellant to reduce
his speed or apply on the brakes of the truck in order to allow
the car to safely negotiate a left turn at the intersection. Failing,
thus, in observing the necessary precaution to avoid inflicting
injury or damage to others, [the Court] consider[s] appellant to
be recklessly imprudent in operating his vehicle. (Veneration
v. People, G.R. No. 137447, January 31, 2005)

The doing of the act or the failure to do the act must be voluntary.
Thus, if the accused is compelled to do the act or is prevented
from doing the act by means of irresistible force or because of
uncontrollable fear (Art. 12, pars. 5 and 6), or if he is an insane or a
minor under nine years old (Art. 12, pars. 1 and 2), he cannot be held
liable for criminal negligence.

Criminal negligence presupposes lack of intention to commit the
wrong done, but that it came about due to imprudence on the part of
the offender. (People u. Guzon, CA., 51 O.G. 4132)
Thus, once intent to kill is proved, the killing of a person is not
homicide through imprudence, but plain homicide under Article 249.

Also, once intent to cause damage due to hate, revenge, or other
evil motive is shown, the crime is not damage to property through
imprudence, but malicious mischief.

Cabugao v. People

(G.R. Nos. 163879 and 165805, July 30, 2014)

Facts; On June 14, 2000, at around 4 p.m., 10-year-old
JR
complained of abdominal pain to his mother. At 5 p.m., JR’s parents
brought him to the clinic of the Dr. Cabugao, a general practitioner.
Dr. Cabugao gave JR medicines for the pain and told JR’s parents to
call him up if his stomach pains continue. Due to persistent abdominal
pains, at 4:30 a.m. the next day, they returned to Dr. Cabugao,
who advised them to bring JR to the Nazareth General Hospital
in
Dagupan City, for confinement. JR was admitted at the said hospital,
blood samples were taken and diagnostic ultrasound was conducted
on JR’s lower abdomen which made a finding of an inflammatory
process wherein appendiceal or periappendiceal pathology
cannot
be excluded. Dr. Cabugao did a rectal examination and since
the
initial impression was acute appendicitis, he referred the case to Dr.
Ynzon, a surgeon. Dr. Ynzon went to the hospital and read the
CBC
and ultrasound results, and ordered the administration of
massive
antibiotics and pain reliever to JR. Thereafter, JR was placed on

observation for 24 hours.

The next morning, JR complained again of abdominal pain and
his parents noticed a swelling in his scrotum. In the afternoon of the
same day, JR vomited out greenish stuff three times and had watery
bowels also three times. The nurses on-duty relayed JR’s condition to
Dr. Ynzon who merely gave orders via telephone. Dr. Ynzon continued
medications to alleviate JR’s abdominal spasms and diarrhea. By
midnight, JR again vomitted twice, had loose bowel movements and
was unable to sleep. The following morning, JR’s condition worsened
and he became unconscious, and was given medication. JR’s
condition
continued to deteriorate that by 2 o’clock in the afternoon, JR’s
temperature soared to 42°C, he had convulsions and finally died.
1326

TITLE FOURTEEN

Art. 365

Quasi-Ofienses

Held; Dr. Ynzon failed to observe the required standard of care

expected from doctors. It was sufficiently established that to prevent
certain death, it was necessary to perform surgery on JR immediately.
Dr. Ynzon revealed want of reasonable skill and care in attending to
the needs of JR by neglecting to monitor effectively the developments
and changes on JR’s condition during the observation period, and to
act upon the situation after the 24-hour period when his abdominal
pain persisted and his condition worsened. Lamentable, Dr. Ynzon
appeared to have visited JR briefly only during regular rounds in the
mornings. He was not there during the crucial times on June 16, 2000
when JR’s condition started to deteriorate until JR’s death. As the

attending surgeon, he should be primarily responsible in monitoring
the condition of JR, as he is in the best position considering his skills
and experience to know if the patient’s condition had deteriorated.
While the resident-doctors-on duty could likewise monitor the
patient’s condition, he is the one directly responsible for the patient
as the attending surgeon. Indeed, it is reckless and gross negligence of
duty to relegate his personal responsibility to observe the condition of
the patient. Again, acute appendicitis was the working diagnosis, and
with the emergence of graver symptoms after the 24-hour observation,
Dr. Ynzon ruled out surgery for no apparent reason.
Among the elements constitutive of reckless imprudence,
what perhaps is most central to a finding of guilt is the conclusive
determination that the accused has exhibited, by his voluntary act
without malice, an inexcusable lack of precaution. It is that which
supplies the criminal intent so indispensable as to bring an act of
mere negligence and imprudence under the operation of the penal
law. This is because a conscious indifference to the consequences of
the conduct is all that is required from the standpoint of the frame of
mind of the accused. Quasi-offenses penalize the mental attitude or
condition behind the act, the dangerous recklessness, the lack of care
or foresight, the“imprudencia punible,” unlike willful offenses which
punish the intentional criminal act. This is precisely where this Court
found Dr. Ynzon to be guilty of his seemingly (sic) indifference to
the deteriorating condition of JR that he as a consequence, failed to
exercise lack of precaution (sic) which eventually led to JR’s death.
To be sure, whether or not a physician has committed an
“inexcusable lack of precaution” in the treatment of his patient
is to be determined according to the standard of care observed by

other members of the profession in good standing under similar
circumstances bearing in mind the advanced state of the profession
at the time of treatment or the present state of medical science. In
accepting a case, a doctor in effect represents that, having the
needed
training and skill possessed by physicians and surgeons practicing
in the same field, he will employ such training, care and skill in
the
treatment of his patients. He, therefore, has a duty to use at least the
same level of care that any other reasonably competent doctor would
use to treat a condition under the same circumstances. Sadly, Dr.
Ynzon did not display that degree of care and precaution demanded

as the right of one vehicle to proceed in a lawful manner in preference
to another approaching vehicle under such circumstances of direction,
speed and proximity as to give rise to a danger of collision unless one
of the vehicles grants precedence to the other (Burrows v. Jacobsen,
311 N.W.2d 880).
(2) Although there is authority to the effect that the right
of way is merely of statutory creation and exists only according to
express statutory provision (Betchkal v. Willis, 378 N.W.2d 684), it
is generally recognized, where no statute or ordinance governs the
matter, that the vehicle first entering an intersection is entitled to
the right of way, and it becomes the duty of the other vehicle likewise
approaching the intersection to proceed with sufficient care to permit
the exercise of such right without danger of collisions. (Creech v.
Blackwell, 298 S.W.2d 394)
(3) The right of way rule is governed by Section 42 of R.A. No.
4136, which provides:
Section 42. Right of Way.
(a) When two vehicles approach or enter an intersection
at approximately the same time, the driver of the vehicle on
the left shall yield the right of way to the vehicle on the right,
except as otherwise hereinafter provided. The driver of any
vehicle traveling at an unlawful speed shall forfeit any right

The provision governs the situation when two vehicles approach
the intersection from the same direction and one of them intends
make a turn on either side of the road. But the rule embodied in
the said provision, also prevalent in traffic statutes in the United
States, has also been liberally applied to a situation in which two
vehicles approach an intersection from directly opposite directions
at approximately the same time on the same street and one of them
attempts to make a left-hand turn into the intersecting street, so as to
put the other upon his right, the vehicle making the turn being
under
the duty of yielding to the other. (McCarthy v. Beckwith, 141 N.E.

Arvo v. Delta Hardware Co., 204 N.W. 134; Cohen v. Silverman, 190

accorded to vehicles
approaching an intersection is not absolute in terms. It is actually
subject to and is affected by the relative distances of the vehicles
from the point of intersection. (Wlodkowski v. Yerkaitis, 57 A.2d 792)
Thus, whether one of the drivers has the right of way or, as
sometimes
stated, has the status of a favored driver on the highway, is a question
that permeates a situation where the vehicles approach the crossing
so nearly at the same time and at such distances and speed that if
either of them proceeds without regard to the other a collision is likely
to occur. (Reynolds v. Madison Bus Co., 26 N.W. 2d 653) Otherwise
stated, the statutory right of way rule under Section 42 of our
traffic
law applies only where the vehicles are approaching the
intersection
at approximately the same time and not where one of the vehicles
enter the junction substantially in advance of the other.
(5) Whether two vehicles are
approaching the intersection at
the same time does not necessarily depend on which of the
vehicles
enters the intersection first. Rather, it is determined by the imminence
of collision when the relative distances and speeds of the
two vehicles
are considered. (Wilmes v. Mihelich, 25 N.W.2d 833) is said that
It
two vehicles are approaching the intersection at approximately the

(6) Nevertheless, the rule requiring the driver on the left to
yield the right of way to the driver on the right on approach to the
intersection, no duty is imposed on the driver on the left to come to
a dead stop, but he is merely required to approach the intersection
with his vehicle under control so that he may yield the right of way
to a vehicle within the danger zone on his right. (Moore v. Kujath, 29
N.W.2d 883) He is not bound to wait until there is no other vehicle
on his right in sight before proceeding to the intersection but only
until it is reasonably safe to proceed. (Metzger v. Cushman’s Sons,
152 N.E. 695) Thus, in Adzuara v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 125134,
22 January 1999, 301 SCRA 657, it was established that a motorist
crossing a thru-stop street has the right of way over the one making
a turn; but if the person making the turn has already negotiated
half of the turn and is almost on the other side so that he is already
visible to the person on the through-street, he is bound to give way
to the former.

prudence in the position of the driver approaching from the left of

another vehicle that if the two vehicles continued on their courses
at their speed, a collision would likely occur, hence, the driver of the
vehicle approaching from the left must give the right of precedence
to the driver of the vehicle on his right. (Moore v. Kujath, 29 N.W 2d
883)

Right of way of police vehicles, fire trucks, and ambulances.

Upon the approach of any police or fire department vehicle, or of
an ambulance giving audible signal, the driver of every other vehicle
shall immediately drive the same to a position as near as possible and
parallel to the right-hand edge or curb of the highway, clear of any
intersection of highways, and shall stop and remain in such position,
unless otherwise directed by a peace officer, until such vehicle shall
have passed. (Sec. 49, R.A. No. 4136)

Motor vehicle overtaking another vehicle.
Section 37 of R.A. No. 4136, as amended, mandates all motorists
to drive and operate vehicles on the right side of the road or highway.
When overtaking another, it should be made only if the highway is
clearly visible and is free from oncoming vehicle. Overtaking while

approaching a curve in the highway, where the driver’s view is
obstructed, is not allowed. (Sec. 41Mb] of R.A. No. 4136) Corollarily,
drivers of automobiles, when overtaking another vehicle, are charged
with a high degree of care and diligence to avoid collision. The
obligation rests upon him to see to it that vehicles coming from the
opposite direction are not taken unaware by his presence on the side
of the road upon which they have the right to pass. (Dumayag v.
People, G.R. No. 172778, November 26, 2012, citing United States v.
Crame, Separate Opinion, 30 Phil. 2, 21-22)
Before the collision, the passenger bus was cruising along its
rightful lane when the tricycle coming from the opposite direction
suddenly swerved and encroached on its lane. The accident would
not have happened had the tricycle driver, stayed on his lane and
did not recklessly try to overtake another vehicle while approaching
a blind curve. (Dumayag v. People, supra)
Overtaking a vehicle “from the right” shows recklessness and
disregard of traffic laws and regulations, and overtaking a vehicle
while another vehicle approaching from the opposite direction is
also overtaking still another vehicle is a violation of Section 59(b) of
the Motor Vehicle Law (now Sec. 41(b] of R.A. No. 4136). (People v.
Songalla, CA., 67 O.G. 8330)

“When a motor vehicle is approaching or rounding a corner or
curve there is a special necessity for keeping to the right-hand side
of the road and the driver has not the right to drive on the left-hand
side.” (60 C.J.S. 656, 725) Overtaking on or upon approaching curves is
in itself a violation of Section 9-b of the Traffic Rules and Regulations
on National Roads Law (now Sec. 41[b] of R.A. No. 4136). (People v.
Balderas, CA., 59 O.G. 1106, 1109)
Driving within speed limit Is not a guaranty for due care.

Speed limits are merely maxima which are not to be exceeded,
so that driving within a certain speed limit is not a guaranty of due
care. The degree of care required of motorist is not governed by speed
limits but by circumstances and conditions obtaining at a particular
time. (People v. Caluza, CA., 58 O.G. 8060, citing Villar and De Vega,
Revised Motor Vehicle Law, p. 155)

TITLE FOURTEEN
Quasi-Offenses

Art. 365

Complex crime of reckless imprudence resulting in multiple
homicide with serious physical injuries and less serious physical
injuries.
The accused, being then a young college graduate and an
experienced driver, should have known to apply the brakes or swerve
to a safe place immediately upon hearing the first bumping thuds to
avoid further hitting the other victims. By his own testimony, it was
established that the road was slippery and slightly going downward;
and worse, the place of the incident was foggy and dark. He should
have observed due care in accordance with the conduct of a reasonably
prudent man, such as by slackening his speed, applying his brakes,
or turning to the left side even if it would mean entering the opposite
lane (there being no evidence that a vehicle was coming from the
opposite direction). It is highly probable that he was driving at high
speed at the time. And even if he was driving within the speed limits,
this did not mean that he was exercising due care under the existing
circumstances and conditions at the time.

Considering that the incident was not a product of a malicious
intent but rather the result of a single act of reckless driving, the
accused should be held guilty for the complex crime of reckless
imprudence resulting in multiple homicide with serious physical
injuries and less serious physical injuries. (People v. De Los Santos,
G.R. No. 131588, March 27, 2001)
Prior conviction or acquittal of reckless imprudence bars
subsequent prosecution for the same quasl-offense.

The doctrine that reckless imprudence under Article 365 is
a single quasi-offense by itself and not merely a means to commit
other crimes such that conviction or acquittal of such quasi-offense
bars subsequent prosecution for the same quasi-offense, regardless
of its various resulting acts, undergirded this Court’s unbroken
chain of jurisprudence on double jeopardy as applied to Article 365
starting with People v. Diaz, 94 Phil. 715 (1954). There, the Court en
banc ordered the dismissal of a case for “damage to property thru
reckless imprudence” because a prior case against the same accused
for “reckless driving,” arising from the same act upon which the
first prosecution was based, had been dismissed earlier. Since then,
whenever the same legal question was brought before the Court,
that is, whether prior conviction or acquittal of reckless imprudence
bars subsequent prosecution for the same quasi-offense, regardless
of the consequences alleged for both charges, the Court unfailingly
and consistently answered in the affirmative and uniformly barred

the second prosecutions as constitutionally impermissible under the
Double Jeopardy Clause.

—

In People v. Buan, 22 SCRA 1383 (March 29, 1968), the Court, speaking
thru Justice J. B. L. Reyes, held that

Reason and precedent both coincide in that once convicted
or acquitted of a specific act of reckless imprudence, the accused
may not be prosecuted again for that same act. For the essence
of the quasi offense of criminal negligence under [AJrticle 365 of
the Revised Penal Code lies in the execution of an imprudent or
negligent act that, if intentionally done, would be punishable as
a felony. The law penalizes thus the negligent or careless act,
not the result thereof. The gravity of the consequence is only
taken into account to determine the penalty, it does not qualify
the substance of the offense. And, as the careless act is single,
whether the injurious result should affect one person or several
persons, the offense (criminal negligence) remains one and the
same, and cannot be split into different crimes and prosecutions.
Thus, accused’s conviction for Reckless Imprudence Resulting in
Slight Physical Injuries bars a second prosecution for Reckless Imprudence
Resulting in Homicide and Damage to Property arising from the same
incident. (Ivler v. Modesto, G.R. No. 172716, November 17, 2010)

Motor vehicle may be on the left side of the road temporarily.

If an obstruction exists on the right hand side of a highway, the
driver of a motor vehicle may be justified in passing to the other side
and in driving along that side until he has passed that obstacle; and
if he exercises the proper degree of care while there, he is not liable
for injuries arising from collision with another vehicle.
But if, as in this case, the immediate cause of accident was the
appellant’s having made a U-turn speedily and without making the
required signal, he is liable for the damage caused. (People v. Dean,

CA., 40 O.G. 555)

Elements of simple imprudence.
1.

That there is lack of precaution on the part of the offender.

2.

That the damage impending to be caused is not immediate or
the danger is not clearly manifest.

1334

Art. 365

Quasi-Offenses

Example of simple imprudence.

Just as the truck driven by A was about to go up the pontoon
bridge, he found B’s truck stalled on top of it. B asked A to pull his
truck. C, helper of B, was requested to tie a steel cable to the two
trucks which were then facing each other at a distance of about two
meters. At a signal, A backed out his truck. Scarcely had the truck
moved about two meters when the truck ofB started functioning, and
B directed A to stop. C untied the steel cable. It was then that C was
sandwich between the two trucks, resulting in the death of C.
Held: Considering the salient physical circumstances
surrounding the accident, such as (1) the narrow distance between the
two vehicles, (2) their inclined position, (3) the approximate time (5:00
pm) when it occurred, and (4) the temporary and slippery condition
of the pontoon bridge, the court believed that the two drivers were
negligent, when both failed to exercise the necessary and reasonable
prudence and care in ascertaining before and whether or not their
trucks were already untied and the deceased safely ensconced prior
to maneuvering their vehicles. However, the negligence exhibited by
the two drivers does not approximate negligence of a reckless nature
but merely amounts to simple negligence. (People v. Custodio, et al.,

CA., 51 O.G. 3525)

Placing a loaded pistol in one’s pocket from which it fell, resulting
in the injury of another when it fired, is not negligence for which
one is liable.

The trial court concedes that the only conclusion that may be
drawn from the facts “is that the shooting was accidental.” However,
it held that the act of appellant “in keeping his loaded pistol in the
same pocket as his wallet, so that when he pulled out his wallet, the
pistol fell to the floor, is reckless negligence,” and sentenced him
accordingly. There is nothing indictable in appellant’s act of placing
his loaded pistol in his pocket with his wallet. It does not even rise
to the level of negligence. That said pistol fell when the wallet was
pulled out from appellant’s pocket does not make the situation any
worse. Besides, even if that act of appellant be in any way considered
imprudent, the same nevertheless could not be the proximate cause
of complainant’s injury. The pistol accidentally fell. And, it was in
the course of appellant’s act of safekeeping the same an altogether
lawful act that it fired. The accidental dropping of the pistol was

—

TITLE FOURTEEN

Criminal Law

Quasi-Offenses

at least an independent intervening cause which interrupted the
chain of causation between the act labeled below as negligent and the
injury caused. No liability could thus be imputable to appellant on
that score. Nor may the firing of the pistol be regarded as negligent.
The essence of a negligent act is that it be in every case voluntary.
(People v. Lopez, 44 O.G., No. 2, pp. 584, 589) As heretofore stated,
the firing of the pistol was purely accidental. It took place precisely
while appellant was making an effort to prevent it from causing injury.
Appellant himself was injured thereby. From all aspects, therefore,
appellant incurred no criminal liability. (People v. Rama, CA 61
O.G. 1195)

our considered opinion that the “damage to the property of another”
provided for in the third paragraph of said codal provision as the basis

“When the execution of the act covered by this article x x x resulted
In damage to the property of another," the penalty is only fine.

Note that when the reckless imprudence or the simple
imprudence or negligence resulted in damage to the property of
another, the penalty is only fine, not imprisonment, ranging from an
amount equal to the value of the damages to three times such value,
but shall not be less than P25.00.

Facts: A passenger bus accused was driving struck the terrace
of the commercial apartment owned by Valdellon. Accused was
convicted of reckless imprudence resulting in damage to property.
The accused was sentenced to suffer imprisonment of one year and
to pay Valdellon reasonable compensation sustained by plaintiff for
damages to her apartment, compensatory and exemplary damages,
attorney’s fees and costs of suit.
Held: The trial court erred in sentencing the accused to suffer
a straight penalty of one year. This is so because under the third
paragraph of Article 365 of the R.P.C., the offender must be sentenced
to pay a fine when the execution of the act shall have only resulted
in damage to property. (Marikina Auto Line Transport Corporation
v. People, G.R. No. 152040, March 31, 2006)

for the fine therein prescribed, is the market value of the property
destroyed at the time and place of its destruction. Hence, where the
property is only partially destroyed, the measure of damages should
be the difference between its value immediately before the injury
and immediately thereafter, together with the reasonable expenses
incurred and the value of time spent to preserve or restore the property
to its former form and condition.
There is no proof in the record of the market value of the truck in
question, or the parts thereof that were damaged, before the collision.
It is however, admitted that that truck was bought by the offended
party sometime in the year 1949, and that since then, the latter had
been using it continuously in his bakery business. It has been clearly
established also that the old hood of the truck has been replaced with
a new one, and that the spare parts with which the mechanic replaced
its damaged parts were new. There can be no dispute, therefore, that
the truck as repaired is much more valuable and stronger than it was,
immediately before the collision took place. It is, however, impossible
to ascertain on the evidence of record the difference in value of that
truck before and after the accident. [The] [Court], therefore, ha[s] to
use [its] discretion, and [it] believets] that the cost of the damages to
that vehicle may reasonably be assessed at Pl,171.64 which is the cost
of the repair and replacements of its spare parts minus 20% thereof.
(People v. Dysico, CA-G.R. No. 20929-R, 56 O.G. 2826)
Article 64 relative to mitigating and aggravating circumstances is
not applicable to crimes committed through negligence.

Article 365 of the R.P.C., being a penal legislative provision,
must be interpreted strictly. And consistent with this theory, it is

Paragraph 5 of Article 365 expressly states that in the imposition
of the penalties provided for in the Article, the courts shall exercise
their sound discretion without regard to the rules prescribed in Article
64. The rationale of the law can be found in the fact that in quasi¬
offenses penalized under Article 365, the carelessness, imprudence or
negligence which characterizes the wrongful act as may vary from one
situation to another, in nature, extent, and resulting consequences,
and in order that there may be a fair and just application of the
penalty, the courts must have ample discretion in its imposition,
without being bound by what we may call the mathematical formula
provided for in Article 64 of the R.P.C. The trial court was not bound to

1336

The measure of the damage should be the difference in value of
the property immediately before the incident and immediately after
the repair.

Art 365

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

apply paragraph 5 of Article 64 even if the accused had two mitigating
circumstances in his favor with no aggravating circumstances to offset
them. (People v. Medroso, Jr., 62 SCRA 245)

The penalties provided in Article 365 are not applicable In the
following cases:

1.

2.

When the penalty provided for the offense is equal to or lower
than those provided in the first two paragraphs of this article
(Art. 365), in which case the courts shall impose the
penalty
next lower in degree than that which should be imposed, in
the period which they may deem proper to apply.
Note: The penalty of arresto mayor in its minimum and
medium periods is provided in the first paragraph of Article
365 for committing any act which, had it been intentional,
would constitute a less grave felony. This penalty should
not be imposed if less serious physical injuries are caused
to the offended party through reckless imprudence, because
the penalty for less serious physical injuries committed with
malice is arresto mayor. In such case, the penalty of arresto
menor, which is next lower in degree than arresto mayor,
should be imposed to preserve the difference between the
penalty for intentional felony and that for culpable felony.
When, by imprudence or negligence and with violation of
the Automobile Law, the death of a person shall be caused,
in which case the defendant shall be punished by prision
correccional in its medium and maximum periods.
Note: The highest penalty prescribed under the first
paragraph of Article 365 is arresto mayor in its maximum
period to prision correccional in its medium period.

First exception applied.

To be precise, paragraph 1 of Article 365 prescribes the penalty
of 21 to 30 days of arresto menor for light felonies committed through
reckless imprudence.

However, in paragraph 6 of this very same article, there is
contained the following exception:

1338

TITLE FOURTEEN
Quasi-Offenses

Art. 365

“The provisions contained in this article shall not be applicable:
1.

When the penalty provided for the offense is equal to or
lower than those provided in the first two paragraphs of this
article, in which case the courts shall impose the penalty
next lower in degree than that which should be imposed,
in the period which they may deem proper to apply.”

The underlying reason for this reduction in penalty is to preserve
the difference between an act wilfully performed from one committed
through negligence.

Under Article 266 of the R.P.C., the penalty provided for slight
physical injuries is arresto menor, that is, imprisonment from 1 to
30 days. Considering that the penalty provided for in paragraph 1 of
Article 365 of the same Code, for imprudent acts which would have
constituted light felonies, is 21 to 30 days, the latter is definitely
graver, or, at the very least, equal to the one prescribed in Article
266. This being the case, the mandate contained in paragraph 6 of
Article 365 has to be followed. The proper penalty, therefore, for
the crime of slight physical injuries through reckless imprudence is
the penalty next lower in degree to arresto menor and this is public
censure. (People v. Regalario y Arcega, CA.-G.R. No. 00817 -R, prom.
February 9, 1961, cited in People v. Sarsoza, CA., 58 O.G. 7404)
When death or injury to any person has resulted, the motor vehicle
driver at fault shall be punished under the Revised Penal Code.
Section 56(n) of R.A. No. 4136, the Land Transportation and
Traffic Code, provides that: If, as the result of negligence or reckless
or unreasonable fast driving, any accident occurs resulting in death
or ipjury of any person, the motor vehicle operator at fault shall, upon
conviction, be punished under the provisions of the R.P.C.
Contributory negligence — not a defense
liability.

— only mitigates criminal

The defense of contributory negligence does not apply in
criminal cases through reckless imprudence, since one cannot allege
the negligence of another to evade the effects of his own negligence.

Art. 365

THE REVISED PENAL CODE

TITLE FOURTEEN

Criminal Law

But where the proximate cause of death is the negligence of the
deceased himself, and not the negligence of the accused driver of the
car, the latter cannot be held liable for homicide. (U.S. v. Tayongtong
21 Phil. 476; U.S. v. Knight, 26 Phil. 216)
A locomotive engineer, who sounded his whistle upon seeing a
laborer cleaning the railroad track, but the laborer who had left the
track returned there for some unaccountable or unjustifiable reason,
when it was too late for the engineer to avoid injuring him, was not
held guilty of homicide through reckless imprudence. He had the right
to assume that the deceased would take notice of the possibility of
a passing train and would leave the track in time to avoid injury to
himself. (U.S. v. Azajar, 30 Phil. 556)

Concurrent proximate cause of two negligent drivers.

The two defendants, by their speeding and in overtaking vehicles
ahead, even encroaching on the other’s lane, without taking due
precaution as required by the circumstances, were held guilty of
negligence which was the proximate cause of the collision.
Where the concurrent or successive negligent acts or omission
of two or more persons, although acting independently of each other
are, in combination, the direct and proximate cause of a single injury
to a third person, and it is impossible to determine in what proportion
each contributed to the injury, either is responsible for the whole
injury, even though his act alone might not have caused the entire

injury.

The “raison d’etre” behind this legal principle is that the
negligence of one person is in no sense justified by the concurring
negligence of another. (People v. Desalisa, et al., CA, 57 O.G. 8689,
citing Am. Jur. Vol. 38, p. 716)
Doctrine of "Last Clear Chance.”

The doctrine of “last clear chance”, in essence, is to the effect
that where both parties are negligent, but the negligent act of
one is appreciably later in time than that of the other, or when
it is impossible to determine whose fault or negligence should be
attributed to the incident, the one who had the last clear opportunity
to avoid the impending harm and failed to do so is chargeable with
the consequences thereof. (See Picart v. Smith, 37 Phil. 809) Stated
1340

Quasi-OfTenses

Art. 365

differently, the rule would also mean that an antecedent negligence
of a person does not preclude the recovery of damages for supervening
negligence of, or bar a defense against the liability sought by, another
if the latter, who had the last fair chance, could have avoided the
impending harm by the exercise of due diligence. (LBC Air Cargo,
Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 101683, February 23, 1995, citing
Pantranco North Express, Inc. v. Baesa, 179 SCRA 384; Gian People’s
Lumber and Hardware v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 173 SCRA
464)

In accordance with the doctrine of “Last Clear Chance,” the
contributory negligence of the party injured will not defeat the action
if it be shown that the accused might, by the exercise of reasonable
care and prudence, have avoided the consequences of the negligence
of the injured party. (People v. Quifiones, CA, 44 O.G. 1520)
Thus, the fact that another truck was parked on the wrong side
of the road bears no influence to relieve the accused from criminal
liability, because despite that admitted fact, the accused had time and
opportunity to avoid the mishap if he had been sufficiently careful
and cautious. (People v. Lopez, CA., 44 O.G. 584)
Emergency Rule.

The rule is stated thus: An automobile driver who, by the
negligence of another and not by his own negligence, is suddenly placed
in an emergency and compelled to act instantly to avoid a collision
or injury is not guilty of negligence if he makes such a choice which
a person of ordinary prudence placed in such a position might make
even though he did not make the wisest choice.

The act of a motorist in attempting to pass a car in front of him
at a moment when another vehicle is approaching constitutes gross
negligence and renders him liable for any damage resulting from said
act.
The “Emergency” rule cannot be applied to exempt him from
liability, because there is proof of negligence on his part. (People v.
Santos, et al., CA., 44 O.G. 1289; Addenbrook v. People, G.R. No.
L-22995, June 29, 1967)

1341

Art 365

THE REVISED PENAL CODE
Criminal Law

Applicability of the “Emergency” doctrine.

A person who is confronted with a sudden emergency may be left
no time for thought, must make speedy decision based largely upon
impulse or instinct, and cannot be held to the same conduct as one
who has had an opportunity to reflect, even though it later appears
that he made the wrong decision. But the “Emergency” doctrine is
applicable only where the situation which arises to confront the
actor is sudden and unexpected, and is such as to deprive him of all
opportunity for deliberation. A further qualification which must be
made is that some emergencies must be anticipated, and the actor
must be prepared to meet them when he engages in an activity from
which they are likely to arise. If a person has knowledge that unusual
consequences may result from his negligent act, he can be held liable
for an injurious consequence of such act notwithstanding it is not the
ordinary consequence of an act of that kind. (People v. Eleazar, et al.,
60 O.G. 1728)
Emergency rule, distinguished from last clear chance rule.

TITLE FOURTEEN
Quasi-Offenaes

Art. 365

Petitioner tries to extricate himself from liability by invoking
the doctrine of last clear chance. He avers that between him and Iran,
the latter had the last clear chance to avoid the collision, hence Iran
must be held liable.

Held: The doctrine of last clear chance states that a person
who has the last clear chance or opportunity of avoiding an accident,
notwithstanding the negligent acts of his opponent, is considered
in law solely responsible for the consequences of the accident.
(Bustamante v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 89880, February 6, 1991,
193 SCRA 603, 611) However, no convincing evidence was adduced by
petitioner to support his invocation of the abovecited doctrine. Instead,
what has been shown is the presence of an emergency and the proper
application of the emergency rule. Petitioner’s act of swerving to the
Tamaraw’s lane at a distance of 30 meters from it and driving the
Isuzu pick-up at a fast speed as it approached the Tamaraw, denied
Iran time and opportunity to ponder the situation at all. There was
no clear chance to speak of. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals did not
err in holding petitioner responsible for the vehicular collision and
the resulting damages, including the injuries suffered by Seyan and
the total loss of the Tamaraw jeepney.

Engada v. Court of Appeals
(G.R. No. 140698, June 20, 2003)

Facts: Iran was driving a Toyota Tamaraw jeepney bound for
Iloilo City with Seyan among those on board. While traversing the
road along Barangay Acquit, the Tamaraw passengers allegedly
saw from the opposite direction a speeding Isuzu pick-up, driven by
petitioner. The pick-up had just negotiated a hilly gradient on the
highway. When it was just a few meters away from the Tamaraw, the
Isuzu pick-up’s right signal light flashed, at the same time, it swerved
to its left, encroaching upon the lane of the Tamaraw and headed
towards a head-on collision course with it. Seyan shouted at Iran to
avoid the pick-up. Iran swerved to his left but the pick-up also swerved
to its right. Thus, the pick-up collided with the Tamaraw, hitting the
latter at its right front passenger side. The impact caused the head
and chassis of the Tamaraw to separate from its body. Seyan was
thrown out of the Tamaraw and landed on a ricefield. Seyan and Iran
were brought to the hospital. Seyan incurred medical expenses and
the Toyota Tamaraw jeepney ended up in the junk heap. Petitioner
was found guilty of Simple Imprudence resulting in physical injuries
and damage to property.

1342

A person violating a traffic regulation is presumed negligent

Under Article 2185 of the Civil Code, unless there is proof to
the contrary, a person driving a vehicle is presumed negligent if, at
the time of the mishap, he was violating any traffic regulation.
But negligence cannot be predicated upon the mere fact of minority
or lack of a driver’s license.

Having thus found earlier that appellant was not negligent in
the operation of the cargo truck, the fact that he drove without a
driver’s license is, therefore, of no moment.
“(The Court] [is] unable to see how minority, or lack of an
operator’s license, could be the proximate cause of an injury. It is
true that lack of skill or knowledge concerning the operation of an
automobile may cause an injury; and some evidence was introduced

tending to establish that Helen Oppie was not familiar with the
operation of an automobile. But if a person, adult or minor, unlicensed
to operate an automobile, is entrusted with one and operates it with

of an operator’s license.” (Oppie v. Ray, 195 N.E., pp. 81, 83; See also
Sec. 2246, Babbitt C.J., The Law Applied to Motor Vehicles, Fourth
Ed.,p. 1626; People v. Villacorta, CA., 61 O.G. 6513)

Held: With respect to the death of B and the injury received
by C, there can be no question that had the acts which caused them
been intentional, they would constitute grave felony and less grave
felony, respectively, and acts of this kind committed through reckless
imprudence, are penalized under Article 365 of the R.P.C. But it would
seem clear that the provisions of said article of the R.P.C. contemplate

The penalty next higher in degree to be imposed if the offender fails
to lend on the spot help to the injured parties.

The last paragraph in Article 365 provides for the penalty next
higher in degree upon the offender who failed to lend on-the-spot help
to the victims of his act of negligence.
Article 275 penalizes with arresto mayor “anyone who shall fail
to help or render assistance to another whom he has accidentally
wounded or iiyured.”
Failing to lend help is a qualifying circumstance.

The failure to render assistance constitutes a qualifying
circumstance because the presence thereof raises the penalty by one
degree (like treachery which qualifies homicide to murder). The same
must be alleged in the information to apprise the defendant of this
charge unlike an ordinary aggravating circumstance which, even if
not alleged in the information, can be taken into account if proved
at the trial without objection. (People v. Beduya, CA., 60 O.G. 2668-

2669)

Defendant Is not criminally liable for the death or injuries caused
by his recklessly negligent acts to trespassers whose presence In
the premises he was not aware of.
People v. Cuadra
(CA., 55 O.G. 7265)

Facts: A was driving a cargo truck. Unknown to him, several
persons boarded the truck. While driving along a road which had a
declination of 25 degrees and whose surface was slippery because
it was drizzling, the truck swerved to the right side of the road and
thus its left front and rear wheels fell into the ditch. A, in an effort
to regain the center of the road, veered the truck abruptly to the left,
but as it reached the middle of the road, it turned turtle. As a result,
B and C, two of those who rode on the rear part of the truck without
A’s knowledge and consent, were thrown out of the truck and iiyured.
B died as a consequence.

Art. 365

a situation in which A could be held to owe to the victim the duty not
to expose him to danger or injury. It is necessary that the victim be
in the premises with some color of right and that A had knowledge
of his presence therein. If the victim is a mere trespasser and A is
not aware of his presence in the premises, the latter is liable only
for injuries resulting from willful and wanton acts, but not for those
resulting from his negligence. Such is the rule in torts and in criminal
cases both here and in American jurisdictions.

In the case of People v. Meir, CA-G.R. No. 1950-B, December 6,
1948, in which the defendant was accused of homicide thru reckless
imprudence for the death of a boy about 11 years of age, who “in
childish frolic clung to the sides of appellant’s vehicle for a joy ride”
without the knowledge or consent of the defendant, and who “was
crushed against the concrete post of the hospital gate,” th[e] Court,
in acquitting the defendants, said that “no man can be punished for
not taking precautions to prevent injuries to persons that act at his
back.” And Corpus Juris Secundum digests the rule in American
jurisdiction as follows:
“The operator of an automobile is under no duty to anticipate
the presence of a trespasser on his vehicle ( Conn-Salamme v. Mulloy,
121 a. 870, 99 Conn, 474), or attempting to board it (Kan, Gamble u.
Uncle Sam Oil Co., 164, p. 627, 100 Kan. 74, L.RA. 1917 D. 875), or
to use due care to acquire knowledge of the presence of a trespasser
(Conn-Salamme v. Mulloy, supra), and he owes to a trespasser, of
whose presence on the vehicle he is unaware, no duties whatsoever,
and is not liable for any injury to such a trespasser even though his
operation of the car was grossly negligent. (Ala. Birmingham Ice &
Cold Storage Co. v. Alley, 25 So. 2d 37, 247 Ala. 503) Even when the
operator becomes aware of the presence of a trespasser, he does not
owe to the trespasser the duty of ordinary or reasonable care but
merely the duty to refrain from wantonly or willfully causing iryury
to him." (Ala. Birmingham Ice & Cold Storage Co. u. Alley, supra; 60

C.J.S. 1020)

TITLE FOURTEEN

Art. 365

Quasi-Offenses

A quack doctor who treated a sick man, resulting in the latter’s death
Is guilty of homicide through reckless imprudence.

Burden of proof in litigation involving medical negligence is with
the plaintiff.

The allegations in the information that the accused acted with
reckless imprudence and negligence in diagnosing and treating the
deceased, knowing that she did not possess the necessary technical
knowledge or skill to do so, thus causing his death, sufficiently charge
the crime of homicide through reckless imprudence, since ordinary

In litigations involving medical negligence, the plaintiffhas the
burden of establishing appellant’s negligence and for a reasonable
conclusion of negligence, there must be proof of breach of duty on the
part of the surgeon as well as a causal connection of such breach and
the resulting death of his patient. (Abaya, et al. v. Favis, 3 CA Reports
450, 454-455 [1963]) In Chan Lugay v. St. Luke’s Hospital, Inc., 10
CA Reports 415 [1966], where the attending physician was absolved
of liability for the death of the complainant’s wife and newborn baby,
this Court held that:

diligence counsels her not to tamper with human life by trying to

treat a sick man. (People v. Vda. de Golez, 108 Phil. 855)

Inexcusable lack of precaution by a physician, how determined.

In Cruz v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 122445, November 18,
1997, the Supreme Court held that:
Whether or not a physician has committed an “inexcusable
lack of precaution” in the treatment of his patient is to be
determined according to the standard of care observed by other
members of the profession in good standing under similar
circumstances bearing in mind the advanced state of the
profession at the time of treatment or the present state of medical
science. (Tolentino, Jr., MEDICINE and LAW, Proceedings of the
Symposium on Current Issues Common to Medicine and Law
UP. Law Center, 1980) In the case of Leonila Garcia-Rueda v.
Wilfred L. Pascasio, et al., G.R. No. 118141, September 5, 1997,
this Court stated that in accepting a case, a doctor in effect
represents that, having the needed training and skill possessed
by physicians and surgeons practicing in the same field, he will
employ such training, care and skill in the treatment of his
patients. He therefore has a duty to use at least the same level
of care that any other reasonably competent doctor would use
to treat a condition under the same circumstances. It is in this
aspect of medical malpractice that expert testimony is essential
to establish not only the standard of care of the profession but
also that the physician’s conduct in the treatment and care falls
below such standard. (MEDICINE and LAW, supra, p. 25; Willard
vs. Hutson, 1 ALR 3d 1092, 1102 [1963]; Snyder vs. Pantaleo,
122 A. 2d 21, 23 [1956]) Further, inasmuch as the causes of the
injuries involved in malpractice actions are determinable only
in the light of scientific knowledge, it has been recognized that
expert testimony is usually necessary to support the conclusion
as to causation. (American Jurisprudence 2d, Vol . 61, p. 510)

1346

In order that there may be a recovery for an injury,
however, it must be shown that the “injury for which recovery is
sought must be the legitimate consequence of the wrong done;
the connection between the negligence and the injury must be a
direct and natural sequence of events, unbroken by intervening
efficient causes.” In other words, the negligence must be the
proximate cause of the injury. For,“negligence, no matter in what
it consists, cannot create a right of action unless it is the proximate
cause of the injury complained of And “the proximate cause of an
injury is that cause, which, in natural and continuous sequence,
unbroken by any efficient intervening cause, produces the injury,
and without which the result would not have occurred.”
