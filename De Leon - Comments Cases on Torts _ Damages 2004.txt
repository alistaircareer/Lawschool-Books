PREFACE
This volume is intended first and foremost to provide law
students with a basic text for classroom use in the course of Torts
and Damages. However, members of the Bench and Bar will find
the work a valuable aid in their search for answers to questions
on the subject.

The authors adopt the same  approach employed in their other
works. Concepts, principles, and legal provisions are first discussed or explained, followed by examples whenever appropriate,
and then, by selected Supreme Court decisions that illustrate their
application in actual situations. In addition, numerous brief rulings
are given for the convenience of the researcher who desires to refer
to other cases pertinent to certain points of law that concern him.
Analogous or related cases are cited in the proper places with the
same end in view. Furthermore, the topics are so organized and
presented, generally with headings and sub-headings, that any
interested reader by reference to them and the Table of Contents
may see the full extent of what is included in the book and quickly
locate it.
This work has been made exhaustive and yet concise in treatment having in mind that the course must be studied in school
within the alloted time in one semester. The authors hope that it
will prove adequate to serve the purpose of those who may have
occasion to use it.

TORTS
Chapter 1
INTRODUCTION
Meaning of tort and tortious act.
(1) The word is a common law expression. It is used in
French to mean “wrong,’’ deriving from the Latin “tortus’’ meaning twisted, as if to say tortious conduct is twisted conduct or
conduct that departs from the existing norm.

In the absence of a statutory definition, a tort is a legal wrong
that causes harm for which the violator is subject to civil liability.
(2) A tortious act is a wrongful act. It has been defined as
the commission or omission of an act by one, without right,
whereby another receives some injury, directly or indirectly, in
person, property, or reputation. (74 Am. Jur. 2d 620.)
Essence of tort.
The essence of tort is the defendant’s potential for civil liability to the victim for harmful wrongdoing and correspondingly the victim’s potential for compensation or other relief.
Examples of torts can be found everywhere. In the absence
of some defense or special facts, it is a tort to punch another
in the nose, to negligently run an automobile into another, or
to negligently perform a medical operation. It may be a tort to
sell a defective product that causes harm.
Some torts cause no physical harms at all but are nonetheless

TORTS

actionable. For example, it is tortious to maliciously prosecute a
person without probable cause, to damage reputation by libel, to
interfere intentionally with a contract, or to mislead a person by
misrepresenting material facts in connection with a sale.

Many other torts can be described or named, and in fact
courts are free to recognize variations and even to recognize
“new torts’’ at any time. (D.B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts, 2000
Ed., pp. 1-2.)
Definitions of tort.
While it has been said that “a really satisfactory definition
of tort has yet to be found,’’ the following are other attempts
to define the term:

(1) A tort is a wrong independent of contract, or a breach
of duty which the law, as distinguished from a mere contract,
has imposed.1 (Western V. Tele. Co. v. Taylor, 84 Ga. 408, 11 SE
396.) It is a violation of a private legal right other than a mere
breach of contract, express or implied. (Bankers Fidelity Life
Ins. Co. v. Harrison, 104 Ga 899, 123 SE 2d 438.) for which a
civil action may be maintained.
(2) A tort is a legal concept possessing the basic elements of
a wrong with resultant injury and consequential damage which
is cognizable in a court of law. (86 C.J.S. 922.)

(3) A tort consists in a violation of a duty imposed by general law or otherwise upon all persons occupying the relation to
each other which is involved in a given transactions. (Coleman
v. California Yearly Meeting of Friends Church, 81 P. 2d 469, 27
Cal. App.2d 579.)
(4) A tort is an act or omission violative of a private right
existing in one or more persons, whether natural or artificial,
which right does not depend directly on the assent of the person or persons owing the relative duty, which directly results
in damage to him or them having the right and for which the
law undertakes to give an appropriate private remedy to the

The breach of a contract may, however, furnish a basis for liability in tort. (infra.; see
Art. 2176, Chap. 6.)

injured person against the wrongdoer. (Downs v. McCampbell,
Tex. Civ. App., 203 S.W.2d 302, 305.)

(5) A tort is the unlawful violation of a private legal right,
other than a mere breach of contract, express or implied; or, it
may be the violation of a public duty, by reason of which some
special damage accrues to the individual. (Parsons v. Foshee,
80 Ga. App. 127, 56 SE 2nd 386.)
(6) A tort consists in the violation of a right given or the
omission of a duty imposed by law. (Naguiat vs. National Labor
Relations Commission, 265 SCRA 564 [1997].) Under the definition in Naguiat, the term “tort,’’ used by the Supreme Court in
a number of cases involving quasi-delicts and delicts, has the
same meaning as tort in common law jurisdictions.

The fundamental concept of a tort is a wrongful act or omission2 resulting in breach of a private legal duty (as distinguished
from a mere breach of contractual duty) and damage from said
breach of duty of such a character as to afford a right of redress at
law in favor of the injured party against the wrongdoer.
Kinds of wrongs.

(1) Wrongs are either civil (or private) or criminal. The wrong
is criminal when it is regarded as an offense against the public
and is penalized by law as a crime or felony.

(2) They may be intentional if the defendant is consciously
aware that his conduct is wrongful, or negligent if the defendant does not intend an invasion of plaintiff’s right but is aware
that, by his behavior, he is taking unreasonable risks.
(3) Sometimes courts recognize a third category, placed
between intentional and negligent wrongs — reckless, gross
or wanton wrong. It is a species of negligence which imports
knowledge and consciousness of the high risk of harm resulting
from his conduct as to be equivalent to an intentional wrong.
(see Chap. 2.)
History of tort as a legal concept.

2
It may be criminal in character. In our jurisdiction, a civil action may be instituted
for the recovery of civil liability arising from a criminal offense considered as a quasi-delict
for purposes of such action. (see Chap. 10.) 3

4

TORTS

Tort law emerged out of criminal law, and was, therefore,
originally concerned principally with violent breaches of the
place. The development of tort as a distinct, integral concept
from an intermingling of civil wrongs and crimes is a comparatively recent event in jurisprudence.

(1) Common law tort. — Tort law is predominantly common
law, that is, judges rather than legislatures usually define what
counts as a tort and how compensation is to be measured.
Nevertheless, a statute or even the Constitution itself may make
certain conduct legally wrongful and may permit recovery of
damages for such conduct. So violation of statute or constitution
is sometimes a tort for which the violator is subject to liability.
(D.B. Dobbs, op. cit., p. 1.)
(2) No clear distinction between tort and crime. — Acts now called
torts have been committed from the very beginning of society, but
a development of anything like a clearly formulated conception
of a tort is comparatively recent. While from the earliest times
certain invasions of personal or property rights, now comprehended under the head of torts, were recognized as wrongful and
as constituting a basis for civil liability, the concepts of tort and
crime were at first confusedly intermingled, and no clear distinction was made between private and public law.

(3) Notion of tort as a specific wrong. — In the next stage of
development of the common law, the notion of tort, in a distinct
and integral sense, still remained unformulated and the history
of tort is to be sought in the history of the various delictual
actions which, in conjunction, made up the whole sum of then
recognized civil liability for wrongs. By 1720, however, an attempt was made to consider these several specific wrongs in
a work consolidating them under the general heading of torts,
although the law on the subject was as yet in no respect systematized and neither bench nor bar had as yet any notion of
a general law of torts; and Blackstone employs that term with
respect to them.
Throughout legal history, torts of a specific character have
been increasing steadily in number. (86 C.J.S. 925.)

(4) Place of torts in Philippine law. — The law of torts as very

INTRODUCTION

5

well-developed in the common law of England and America,
constitutes one of its main divisions and consists of a very
elaborate set of rules. But it has not received similar attention
in the civil law. In the latter there is no separate department
called the law of torts in the same way that there is a breach
known as the law of contracts, or the commercial law. There
were however, in the Spanish codes in force in the Philippines
a few scattered provisions which deal with cases of the nature
of torts. Besides since American occupation, a number of laws
patterned after Anglo-American models have been passed amplifying the field of torts in the Philippine legal system. M.J.
Gamboa, An Introduction to Philippine Law, 1939 Ed., 287.)
Many provisions of our present Civil Code recognize many
concepts (e.g., proximate cause, contributory negligence) in
the Anglo-American law of torts. In fact, certain provisions of
the Civil Code, particularly Articles 19, 20, and 21 (Chap. 4.),
are broad enough to include civil liability arising from crime.
(Chaps. 4, 10.)
Functions or goals of tort law.

In medieval England, the law of torts, like the law of crimes,
had modest aims, principally to discourage violence and revenge.
Today’s tort law has much grander aims. All of the aims are
laudable, but sometimes one of them will conflict with another.
The most commonly mentioned aims of tort law are compensation of injured persons and deterrence of undesirable behavior.
Both of these aims, however, are subsumed in whole or part
under broader goals.
(1) Morality or corrective justice. — Particular aims of torts
law are usually erected under one of two large systems of
thought. The first bases tort law on moral responsibility or corrective justice. It attempts to hold defendants liable for harms
they wrongfully caused and no others. Good social effects may
result when courts act to right the wrongs done by defendants,
but in this system of thought that is not the point of imposing
liability. Liability is imposed instead when and only when it is
“right’’ to do so.
(2) Social utility or policy. — The second large system of

6

TORTS

thought reverses the emphasis. It bases tort law on social policy
or a good-for-all-of-us view. Social policy may coincide with
justice in particular cases, but the dominant concern is not
justice to the individual; it is to provide a system of rules that,
overall, works toward the good of society.
(3) Legal process. — One kind of utility or social policy is
inward looking. Rules must be made with the legal process
itself in mind. They must be the kind of rules judges can understand and apply in a practical way, and they must not leave
too much to the judge’s discretion. These and a host of similar
considerations focus on the litigation process itself as a good
to be preserved rather than on the abstract ideal of justice or
social utility.

(4) Potential conflicts. — The first two ways of looking at tort
law are usually regarded as antithetical to each other. Although
justice and policy often point to the same result, they do not
always do so, and when they do not, one of these views, must
prevail or both must be compromised. The legal process view
might also conflict with the aims of justice or those of policy.
By way of example:

Suppose a city, facing a raging and spreading fire, attempts to create a firebreak by blowing up a row of houses.
Because time is critical, the city insists upon doing so before
the plaintiff, who owns one of the houses, can remove his
furniture. When the whole thing is over, the plaintiff claims
damages from the city for the value of the furniture he could
have saved. The city has acted for the good of its residents
generally, but the plaintiff is the one who pays the costs.

If the city’s action is to be judged by a standard of social
policy, some jurists might say the city should not be liable.
On the other hand, if it is judged by corrective justice standards, the city should pay for the damage it did. Otherwise,
the city would get the advantage of its action (whatever
that advantage might be) but would pay none of the costs.

There are more subtle examples, but this one is enough to
suggest the potential conflict between a decision based upon
(supposed) social policy and one based upon justice to the

INTRODUCTION

7

individuals. (D.B. Dobbs, op. cit., pp. 12-13.)

(5) Distribution of loss. — Defendants who are held liable
in torts actions often do not shoulder the burden of compensation themselves. Sometimes defendants are covered by liability
insurance and the insurer literally pays the plaintiff on behalf
of the policy holder/defendants. On other occasions even an
uninsured defendant may be able to include its prospective
liabilities in the price of the products it sells; or the defendant
may have shareholders whose investments decline in value as
a result of the payment of a liability by the company whose
shares they own.
In each of those situations, the cost of the loss suffered by
the plaintiff is not simply transferred to the defendant but is
distributed through the defendant to a large number of individuals. Promoting the broad distribution of losses is, therefore,
often considered one of the functions of tort liability.

(6) Redress of social grievances. — One view is that the right
to sue in tort promotes the redress of social grievances, especially against large impersonal institutions. In this sense, tort
law is a popular mechanism that permits ordinary people to
put authority on trial.

(7) Summary: a mixed system. — It is obvious from the preceding discussions that torts law does not serve any single goal
but a set of different goals whose strength is likely to vary with
the situation. Tort law thus performs a “mixed’’ set of functions.
In some cases, concern for corrective justice will dominate, but
in others, deterrence or concern for loss distribution will be the
key; and in many cases, because the imposition of tort liability
would not serve any of the goals of tort law effectively, liability
is not imposed. (K.S. Abraham, The Forms and Functions of
Tort Law, 2002 Ed., pp. 16-17, 19-20.)
Two general classes of torts.
Torts may be divided into two (2) general classes.

(1) Property torts. — They embrace all injuries and damages
to property, whether realty or personalty, and

(2) Personal torts. — They include all injuries to the person,

8

TORTS

whether to the body, reputation, or feelings. A tort which is not
an injury to property is a personal tort. (see Chaps. 4, 5, 7.)
Concept of personal injury in tort law.
The phrase “personal injury’’ denotes primarily an injury to
the body of a person, and a personal injury, whether administered intentionally, wantonly or by negligence, constitutes a tort.

However, a personal injury or an injury to the person, within
the meaning of the law, does not necessarily involve physical
contact with the person injured, or mere bodily or physical injuries. It may embrace all actionable injuries to the individual
himself as distinguished from injuries to his property. Thus,
“personal injury’’ may denote an injury affecting the reputation, character, conduct, manner, and habits of a person. (74
Am. Jur. 2d 620-621.)
Tort and contract.
(1) Fields of tort and contract distinct. — Breach of contract
is not in itself a tort. The conventional view goes further. It
holds that the fields of tort and contract are entirely distinct
because contract duties are created by the promises of the parties, while tort duties are imposed as rules of law. On this view,
the province of torts is wrongs and the province of contract is
agreements or promises. This perception is that the fields of
tort and contract hardly touch each other, much less overlap.
Another conventional view supports the same conclusion. It
asserts that contracts are largely about economic matters such
as buying and selling; many torts typically involve physical
harms. (D.B. Dobbs, op. cit., p. 5.)

(2) Basis of liability. — A third point is not so often mentioned, but it is important. Contract law is at least formally
strict liability law. Most of tort law, on the other hand, is at
least formally fault-based. Specifically, a person is often liable
for a contract breach even if he is not at fault and made every
efforts to perform the contract as promised. But one is not
ordinarily liable under tort law even for conduct that causes

INTRODUCTION

9

horrible injuries unless he is at fault in some way.

The reasoning and the formal themes of tort law thus differ
enormously from those of contract law. (Ibid.)

(3) Test to be applied for existence of tort. — It is a distinguishing characteristic of torts that the duties from the violation of
which torts result are creatures of the law and not of particular
agreements. Since contractual duties proper have their origin in,
and derive their vitality directly from, the assent of the parties,
a breach of such duties only does not constitute a tort.
The test to be applied is the nature of the right which has
been invaded. A contract is not, of course, essential to the existence of a tort. (86 C.J.S. 923-924.)

(4) Causes of action need not be completely disconnected from
contract. — Torts have been defined as wrongs independent of
contract. Nevertheless, causes of action need not be completely
disconnected from contracts in order to constitute torts.
Indeed, the existence of a contract may be one of the circumstances requisite to give to particular conduct the character of
a breach of duty and thus, to make it tortious. Where there is
such a contract to which are attached duties of a dual character,
some with a consensual basis and others imposed by law on
the particular relation which the parties have assumed, while
a breach of the former class of duties only is not tortious, a
breach of the latter class constitutes a tort. (Ibid. 924.)

(5) Breach of contract treated as a tort. — A tort is a wrong to
another in his rights created by law or existing in consequence
of a relation established by contract, but it cannot be based upon
the contract itself. In other words, a mere breach of contract
cannot be converted into a tort.

A breach of contract may be treated as a tort where the law
casts its separate obligation. To recover upon that theory, the
plaintiff must show not merely that the defendant assumed an
obligation under the contract, but that out of that obligation
there arose a duty to the plaintiff. (74 Am. Jur. 2d. 639-640.)
(a) More than mere breach of contract. — To establish commission of tort by breach of contract, the party sought to be
charged must be shown, for example, to have been guilty of

10

TORTS

some fraud, overreaching conversion or willful and malicious
interference with another’s contract rights. (O’Hagan v. Del
Prado, 53 N.Y.S. 2d 843; see Chap. 6, under Art. 2176.)
(b) Failure or refusal to pay debt. — In the ordinary case
of debtor and creditor, the debtor is not liable to the creditor in action in tort for failure or refusal to pay debt, since
liability arises out of contract and is limited to the amount
of the debt. (Val. Nat. Bank v. Witter, 121 P. 2d 414, 58 Ariz.
491.)

(c) Damages not within contemplation of parties. — Generally, there is no liability in tort for violation of a contract,
particularly where the damages resulting from such violation could not reasonably have been within contemplation
of the parties. (Pizzolotto v. Sims, La. App., 23 So. 2d 710.)

(d) Negligent violation of contract. — The violation of a
contract will not, as such, furnish a basis for liability in
tort. However, the act which violates the contract may be
a negligent one which creates such liability. In such a case,
it is the negligent act rather than the violation of contract
which furnishes the basis for liability. (U.S. Standard Brands
v. Baterman, C.A. Mo., 184 F.2d 1002.)
One who undertakes, pursuant to an oral agreement, to
“shoot’’ an oil well by the use of nitroglycerin may be held
liable in tort to the owner of the well in case he performs the
services incumbent upon him by reason of such agreement
in so negligent a manner as to damage or destroy the oil well.
(Jackson v. Central Torpedo Co., 117 Okla. 245, 246, p. 426.)

But an action for loss sustained by the “burning out’’ of
an engine purchased by the plaintiff from the defendant was
held based on a cause of action for breach of contract, and
not on a cause of action ex delicto, even though it is alleged
that the defendant was negligent in performing its agreement
to repair the engine before delivery to the plaintiff. (State ex
rel. Cummins Missouri Diesel Sales Corp. v. Eversole [Mo
App] 332 SW2d 53, 93 ALR2d 875.)
(e) Negligent performance or non-performance of contract.
— Although, as a general rule, mere failure to perform a

INTRODUCTION

11

contract cannot serve as a basis for tort liability for negligence, the tendency has been to recognize that liability for
negligence may be predicated upon a lack of due care in
failing to act as well as upon a negligent performance. It has
been regarded as a sound rule that where there is a general
duty, even though it arises from the relation created by, or
from the terms of, a contract, and that duty is violated, either
by negligent performance or negligent non-performance, the
breach of the duty may constitute actionable negligence. (274
Am. Jur. 2d. 640.)

(6) Refusal to contract as constituting a tort. — A refusal to
contract may constitute a tort where there is a duty imposed by
law, on one so refusing, to enter into contracts of the character
sought, as an incident to his trade or profession, but otherwise
a refusal to contract is not a tort. A refusal to continue a business relation which is terminable at will does not impose tort
liability for the harm thereby resulting whether the harm is
intended or unintended. (86 C.J.S. 925.)

(7) Claim grounded on duress. — Duress, although it often
arises in connection with breach of contract, is nevertheless a
tort, and where a claim is grounded in duress, one who sustains damage as a result of being subjected to duress may sue
as plaintiff in a tort action, thus obviating the need for privity
of contract. (Housing Authority of Dallas v. Hubbell [Tex Civ.
App], 325 SW2d 880.)
Dual liability in tort and contract.

Liability in tort may coexist with a liability in contract toward
the same person where, independently of the contract, there is
a duty which has been violated. (86 C.J.S. 925.)
It is generally recognized that a tort may involve acts which
also constitute a breach of contract, so that an action for tort
will lie, notwithstanding the act complained of would also be
ground for an action ex contractu. Under this rule, it has been
held that accompanying every contract there is a duty to perform with care, skill, reasonable expedience, and faithfulness
the thing agreed to be done. The negligent failure to observe
any of these conditions is a tort, as well as a breach of contract.

12

TORTS

Under such circumstances, the general rule is that the plaintiff may elect which to pursue. (74 Am. Jur. 2d 641; see Chap.
6, under Art.3 2176.)
Tort and crime.

Some torts are also crimes but tort law is not concerned
with the separate issue of criminal responsibility.
(1) Purposes of criminal and tort law. — The relationship between tort law and criminal law is largely explained by their
respective purposes.
(a) The purpose of criminal punishment is primarily to
vindicate the state’s interests in deterring crime and imposing
justice.

(b) The purpose of tort liability is in no way inconsistent,
but its emphasis is different. It is primarily to vindicate the
individual victim and the victim’s rights and secondarily, to
confirm and reinforce public standards of behavior.

(2) Tort law growing out of criminal law. — In the development of English law, tort law arose out of criminal law. Judges
who imposed punishment upon lawbreakers at one time also
occasionally imposed civil liability. Judges and lawyers gradually perceived that criminal punishment and civil liability had
related but distinct purposes.
Tort law developed into a separate field in itself, aimed at
providing distinctly civil remedies.

(3) Conduct as both criminal and tortious. — Today, a single
act might constitute both a crime and a tort.

Example: If a defendant beats a person, he is almost certainly committing a crime for which the State can prosecute
and punish. He is also committing a tort, for which the injured
individual may sue and recover compensation.
The individual’s tort suit may proceed whether or not the
crime is prosecuted.

(4) Interaction of criminal and tort law. — In tort cases, courts will
often take notice of the fact that the defendant’s conduct amounted
When not otherwise indicated, refers to article in the Civil Code.

3

INTRODUCTION

13

to a crime and will give weight to this fact in determining whether
the conduct also amounted to a tort. But this does not work the
other way around. Crime is usually defined by statute. Whether
the defendant’s conduct is a tort is not important in determining
whether the conduct violates criminal law.

(5) Substantive comparisons: intent and harm. — Substantively
speaking, there is no necessary correlation between tort and crime.
(a) The most fundamental basis for criminal liability is
intent, often very specific intent. Some kind of intent is also
required for some torts, but more commonly mere negligence
coupled with actual harm will suffice for liability.

(b) A second important difference in the two fields can
be seen in the different ways in which actual harm is treated.
Criminal law redresses the State’s interests in the security of
society. It may punish conduct that threatens those interests
even when no harm has been done. Speeding increases risks
to others and so may be punished criminally. Tort law, aimed
at protection of individuals, would never impose liability for
speeding alone; tort law would impose liability only if harm
results.

(6) Procedural comparisons. — On the procedural side, tort and
crime differ enormously.
(a) Criminal prosecutions ordinarily must be initiated by
the government; tort suits may be brought by an aggrieved
individual.
(b) Criminal prosecutions can succeed only if the proof
shows guilt beyond a reasonable doubt; tort suits can succeed
if the proof shows an actionable tort by a more-likely-than-not
standard. (D.B. Dobbs, op. cit., pp. 4-5; see Chap. 10.)
Damages and other remedies.

Tort law is primarily intended to redress legally recognized
harms by rendering a judgment against the wrongdoer. This
award is usually a money award called “damages,’’ and it is
usually intended as a kind of compensation for the harm suffered. In some cases, a punitive damages award may be added
to compensatory damages to deter further misconduct.
Other remedies that are infrequently available include restitu-

14

TORTS

tion, which forces the tortfeasor to disgorge gains he wrongfully
obtained by tort, and injunction, which compels him to cease his
tortuous conduct. In the great majority of tort cases, however,
a favorable judgment for the victim means an award of money
as compensation for harm caused. (Ibid., p. 2.)
Persons entitled to sue for tort.

The existence of a legal right and of a legal duty corresponding to such right are essential elements of a cause of action. Upon
the violation of such duty, a cause of action arises in favor of
the person for whose benefit, safety, or protection the duty is
imposed, and upon whom the injury has fallen.

(1) Particular individual injured. — The duty must be one
owing to the particular individual injured. A breach of duty
owed to one class of persons does not create a cause of action
in favor of a person not within the class.

(2) Person upon whom tort committed. — As a general rule,
a tort committed upon one person furnishes no cause of action in favor of another. Thus, the right to recover for mental
anguish when it exists is restricted to the person who has directly sustained the injury. Similarly, the mere fact that one had
contractual relations with an injured party, which are impaired
by the injury, does not give a right of action to the former, as
to whom the defendant committed no wrongful act.

(3) Person injured by tort committed upon another. — There are
cases, however, in which an injury to one person may operate
to the injury of another. Thus, although where a child is injured
by a tort committed upon it, the parent has no right to sue for
the injury as such, it is recognized that the parent may maintain
an action in his own right for any impairment of his parental
rights caused by the injury, including also any pecuniary loss
suffered by him traceable to the injury.
(4) Several persons wronged by same act. — The same act may
be a wrong to more than one person, and a wrong to one does
not cease to be remediable because it may also be a wrong to
another. If a tort is committed against several persons, each
person injured may sue. (86 C.J.S. 946.)
(5) Person especially injured by contract violation. — It has been

INTRODUCTION

15

recognized that no privity of contract is necessary to support
an action in tort for a direct invasion of a legal right or for the
infraction of a duty implied by law where special injury to an
individual results from the infraction. If, independent of the
contract, there exists a duty to the person injured, an action
may be maintained, even though the act upon which the tort
liability is predicated is done in performance of the contract.
(supra.)
This rule recognizes the principle that an obligation may be
assumed by contract out of which may arise a duty to others
than the other party to the contract. In such case the liability
to the injured person is based not on the nonperformance of a
contractual obligation, but on the breach of a duty imposed by
law. (74 Am. Jur. 2d 662-664.)
(6) Person directly, not collaterally, injured. — Where the cause
of action is not assignable or has not been assigned, suit must be
brought by the person whose legal rights have been infringed.
An action for damages resulting from a tort can be maintained
only by the person directly injured and not by one alleging a
collateral or resulting injury. The legal consequences of a tort
do not extend to one injured only because he had contractual
relations with the one directly injured by the tort.
The rule that a person may maintain but one action for a
single tort does not permit a suit for another’s injuries occasioned by the same tort. (86 C.J.S. 946.)
Persons liable for tort.

As a general rule, all persons or entities are liable for torts
committed by them, or by their agents while acting within the
scope of their duties or powers. (74 Am. Jur. 2d 664.)

(1) Tortfeasor. — Every person legally responsible is liable
for a tort committed by him provided, if it is the proximate
cause of an injury to another. One who contributes to a damage
cannot escape liability because his proportional contribution to
the result may not be accurately measured.
(2) Person incapable of making a contract. — Where a contract
is an essential element of the tort, a person incapable of making
the contract, such as an infant is not liable.

16

TORTS

(3) Person other than tortfeasor. — In the absence of some relation existing so as to render the doctrine of respondeat superior or
the maxim, Que facit per alium facit per se, applicable, or unless a
person participates in or ratifies a tortious act, he is not liable for
the act or omission of another. A person is responsible only for his
own torts, except as liability has been extended by statute.
It must be presumed that the legislature, in making radical
change in the rule that a person is responsible only for his own
torts, would have made its intent and purpose clear and that
it went no further than the mischief to be remedied required.
(see Art. 2180, Chap. 6.)

(a) The mere presence of a person at the commission of a
wrongful act by another will not render him liable as a participant. However, proof that a person is present at the commission of a wrongful act, without disapproving or opposing it, is
evidence from which, in connection with other circumstances,
it is competent to infer that he aided and abetted it.
(b) Mere knowledge that a tort is being committed against
another will not be sufficient to establish liability. Ordinarily,
there exists no legal duty to disclose or prevent the commission of a tort.

(c) Mere acquiescence in the commission of a tort after the
act does not make the person thus acquiescing a party to
the wrong or liable therefor as a joint tortfeasor. In order to
be liable he must not only have assented to the wrong, but
the act must have been done for his benefit or have been
of a nature to benefit him.

(d) The ratification must be founded on full knowledge
of the facts constituting the wrong which has been committed or with a purpose on the part of the principal to take
the consequences on himself without inquiry. It will not be
established from mere knowledge, approval, or satisfaction,
although where an act is simply in excess of authority, mere
approval of the wrong may be sufficient.
(e) One has no duty so to control conduct of a third person
as to prevent him from causing bodily harm to another unless a special relationship exists between one and the third

INTRODUCTION

17

person which imposed duty on one to control the third
person’s conduct. (see Chap. 6, under Art. 2176.)
Examples:

1) A citizen is not responsible in damages for the
tortious act of a peace officer who is engaged at the
citizen’s behest in performance of service for the public.

2) Private individuals or corporations who call police
officers of a city to quiet a disturbance are not liable because
of the manner in which the officers perform or neglect to
perform their public duties, unless the parties calling the
officers are a part of some unlawful plan or act and do
something in furtherance of such unlawful act.

3) Firemen engaged in extinguishing fire are not
agents or servants of owners of building, but are “public officers,’’ and, hence, owners are not responsible for
act of firemen in opening doors of bulk-head partly on
sidewalk without warning to a pedestrian who was
crossing over doors. (86 C.J.S. 946-948.)
Liability of joint tortfeasors.
So far as the number of individuals who may be held responsible are concerned, torts are either single or joint. (Ibid. 948.)

Joint tortfeasors are two or more persons who act together
in committing a wrong, or contribute to its commission, or
assist or participate therein actively and with common intent,
so that injury results to a third person from the joint wrongful
act of the wrongdoers. The primary test of “joint tortfeasors’’
is whether plaintiff has a single cause of action against such
tortfeasors or whether he has only a several cause of action
against each of them. Whether two or more persons are actually joint wrongdoers is “question of fact’’ dependent on the
circumstances. (Ibid. 949.)
(1) A person who joins in committing a tort cannot escape
liability by showing that another person is liable also. In other
words, the fact that a third person cooperated in the wrong is
no justification for the misconduct of the defendant. The general
rule as to this matter is that joint tortfeasors are jointly and
severally or solidarily liable. (Art. 2194, Chap. 6.) Hence, a tort

18

TORTS

jointly committed by several persons may be treated as joint
or solidary at the election of the aggrieved party.

(2) Where two or more persons owe another a common
duty, and by a common neglect of that duty, the other person
is injured there is a joint tort and all may be held solidary liable. This common duty may be merely a duty of two or more
persons to exercise due care.
(3) One is liable for the act of his joint tortfeasor although
the act causes other or greater injury than he intended. (74 Am.
Jur. 2d 670-671.)
(4) Persons may be solidarily liable for the commission of a
tort by reason of a contractual relation existing between them
such as, for example, agency, master and servant, and partnership. (86 C.J.S. 952-953.)

(5) The exoneration or exemption from liability of one joint
tortfeasor does not exonerate or exempt the other, unless the
liability of one results from his responsibility for the act of
another rather than from his own act. (Ibid. 954.)
Where tortfeasors acted independently
of each other.

Generally, concert of action in the execution of a common
purpose is essential to a joint tort, but, independent tortfeasors
whose torts concur to cause a single injury may be regarded in
law as joint tortfeasors.
(1) Injuries separate and distinct. — Where wrongdoers have
not acted in concert, and separate and distinct injuries are caused
by the act or neglect of each, the liability is joint or separate only,
and each is liable only for the damage caused by his own tort.
The fact that it is difficult to separate the injury done by each
from that done by the others furnishes no reason for holding
that one tortfeasor should be liable for the acts of others with
whom he is not acting in concert.
(2) Injury single and indivisible. — Where the concurrent or
successive negligent acts or omissions of two or more persons,
although acting independently of each other, are, in combination, the direct and proximate cause of a single injury to a third

INTRODUCTION

19

person, and it is impossible to determine in what proportion
each contributed to the injury, either is said to be responsible
for the whole injury, even though his act alone might not have
caused the entire injury, or the same damage might have resulted
from the act of the other tortfeasor.

This rule applies only when the damage is indivisible, and
damage is indivisible when the court cannot make a division
or apportionment thereof among the negligent actors. (74 Am.
Jur. 2d 671-672.)
Examples:

(a) Persons whose negligent construction of a sidewalk
forces a pedestrian onto the roadway in the path of passing vehicles are equally liable with the driver of the vehicle
for injury to the pedestrian by the negligent operation of
an automobile. (Shafir v. Sieben [Mo] 233 SW 419, 17 ALR
637, later app in [Mo] 274 SW 755.)
(b) Where a sheriff, who had a warrant for the arrest
of a cab driver, attempted to stop the cab, but the driver,
instead of stopping, tried to run over the sheriff, whereupon the sheriff shot at the cab, killing a passenger therein,
the sheriff and the cab driver were joint tortfeasors whose
separate acts concurred in causing the passenger’s death.
(Miller’s Admrx v. Picard, 301 Ky 157, 191 SW2d 202.)
Law governing transitory torts.

(1) Law of the place; law of the forum. — Since the jurisdiction of the forum is exclusive over causes of action which are
necessarily local in character, and since questions relative to the
conflict of laws are essentially dependent on a plurality of laws
from which one is to be selected and applied, the determination
of what law governs torts arises only in connection with torts
which are transitory in character. As to asserted torts of that
character, the ordinary rule is that the law of the place where
the injury was occasioned or inflicted governs in respect of the
right of action, and the law of the forum in respect of matters
pertaining to the remedy only.
The power of a State to impose responsibility for injuries

20

TORTS

within its borders may not be curtailed by agreements made
elsewhere.

(2) Determination of place of wrong. — The law of the place
where the act or omission, claimed as the basis of a tort, occurred governs, in determining whether there is a tort as a legal
consequence of such conduct. Generally, the place of the wrong
is determined where the last event necessary to make an actor
liable for an alleged tort takes place, or, as otherwise stated, the
place where the injury is suffered rather than the place where
the act which caused the injury was committed.

(3) Different result as to the tort liability under lex loci. — The
lex loci controls, even though, under the lex fori, a different result
as to tort liability would arise from the facts relied on. Thus,
where, by the lex loci, particular conduct by itself or in the light
of defensive matter does not give rise to a tort, it will not be
given effect as such, although by the lex fori it is a sufficient
foundation for tort, even where it is made, or recognized as
being, so by express statutory provision.
Conversely, where such conduct or circumstances are sufficient to constitute a tort under the lex loci delictus, that effect will
be given them elsewhere. While some earlier decisions inclined
toward a doctrine to the contrary, the more recent authorities
are to the effect that this is so.

(4) Tort incident to relation created by contract. — Where the duty
involved is one imposed by law as an incident to a relation created by a contract, formed in a State different from that wherein
the injury is inflicted, the question of what law governs is not
affected by that circumstance. The rights of the parties are, as in
the ordinary case, to be determined by the lex loci delictus.

(5) Enforcement of a tort liability. — In accordance with the
general rule as to procedural matters, the lex fori governs as to
remedies and remedial rights involved in the enforcement of
tort liability, as, for instance, on questions of the form of the
action, pleading, evidence, and the mode and conduct of the
trial. However, where the same statute has created both right
and remedy, which are so closely interwoven that they cannot
be separated, it has been held that the lex loci governs not only

INTRODUCTION

21

as to the right, but as to remedial matters thus associated with
the nature of the right itself. (86 C.J.S. 940-941.)
Philippine laws on torts.
Under Article 1157 of the Civil Code, “Obligations arise from:
(1) Law; (2) Contracts; (3) Quasi-contracts; (4) Acts or omissions
punished by law; and (5) Quasi-delicts.’’

(1) Main Civil Code provisions. — Obligations derived from
quasi-delicts are governed mainly by Articles 2176 to 2194, Chapter 2 (Quasi-Delicts), Title XVII (Extra-Contractual Obligations)
of the Civil Code and by special laws. (Art. 1162.) By Article
2178, the provisions that apply to culpa contractual, i.e., Articles
1172 (responsibility arising from negligence), 1173 (definition of
negligence), and 1174 (responsibility for fortuitous events) are
expressly made likewise applicable to a quasi-delict. (see Art.
2178, Chap. 6.)
(2) Other Civil Code and special law provisions. — Article 2176
is the basic provision on quasi-delict. The Civil Code, however, contains in Chapter 2 of the Preliminary Title provisions
devoted to Human Relations (Chap. 4.) which formulate some
fundamental principles or guides for human conduct, violation
of which may give rise to liability for damages. In many parts
of the Civil Code are provisions the non-observance of which
may also constitute actionable wrongs. (Chaps. 5, 7, 8.) There
are provisions of special laws that recognize liability for quasidelict, and even use the term tort as a source of liability. (Chap.
9.)
Under Article 2177, acquittal from an accusation of criminal
negligence, whether on reasonable doubt or not, shall not be a
bar to subsequent civil action, not for civil liability arising from
criminal negligence, but for damages due to a quasi-delict or
culpa aquiliana (Chaps, 4, 10.) although said article forestalls a
double recovery. (Report of the Code Commission, p. 162.)
Expanded concept of quasi-delict.
(1) General plan of the Philippine legal system. — The Code
Commission which drafted the new Civil Code (R.A. No.
386, as amended.), decided to use the term “quasi-delicts’’ for

22

TORTS

those obligations which do not arise from law, contracts, quasicontracts, and criminal offenses, which term “more nearly corresponds to the Roman Law classification of obligations, and is
in harmony with the nature of this kind of liability.’’ It rejected
the use of the word “tort’’ in Anglo-American jurisprudence,
which is much broader than the Spanish-Philippine concept
of obligations arising from non-contractual negligence or culpa
aquiliana as it is known in Spanish legal treatises. “Said word
includes not only negligence, but also intentional criminal acts,
such as assault and battery, false imprisonment and deceit. In
the general plan of the Philippine legal system, intentional and
malicious acts are governed by the Penal Code, although certain
exceptions are made in the Project.’’ (Ibid.)
Thus, it is that, as in the Spanish Civil Code from which
our own Civil Code was mainly derived, “a quasi-delict or
culpa aquiliana is a separate legal institution under the Civil
Code, with a substantiality all its own, and individuality that
is entirely apart and independent from crime.’’ (Barredo vs.
Garcia, 73 Phil. 609 [1942].)

(2) View that quasi-delict limited to negligent conduct. — According to the Supreme Court (Third Division) in Gashem Shookat Baksh
vs. Court of Appeals (219 SCRA 115 [1993].), Article 2176 which
defines quasi-delict “is limited to negligent acts or omissions and
excludes the notion of willingness or intent. Quasi-delict, known
in Spanish legal treatises as culpa aquiliana, is a civil law concept
while torts is an Anglo-American or common law concept. “Torts’’
is much broader than culpa aquiliana because it includes not only
negligence, but intentional criminal acts as well such as assault
and battery, false imprisonment and deceit.
In the general scheme of the Philippine legal system envisioned by the Commission responsible for drafting the New Civil
Code, intentional and malicious acts, with certain exceptions,
are to be governed by the Revised Penal Code while negligent
acts or omissions are to be covered by Article 2176 of the Civil
Code. In between these opposite spectrums are injurious acts
which in the absence of Article 21, would have been beyond
redress. Thus, Article 21 fills that vacuum. It is even postulated
that together with Articles 19 and 20 of the Civil Code, Article
21 has greatly broadened the scope of the law on civil wrongs;

INTRODUCTION

23

it has become much more supple and adaptable than the AngloAmerican law on torts.’’ (see Chap. 4.)

Cangco vs. Manila Railroad Co. (38 Phil. 768 [1918].) and
Manila Railroad Co. vs. Cia Transatlantica (38 Phil. 875 [1938].)
also support the view that liability arising from culpa aquiliana
is founded solely upon a voluntary act or omission, which,
without intent, malice or bad faith, but by mere negligence or
inattention, has caused damage to another.
(3) Civil Code provisions covering common law tort. — However,
certain provisions of our Civil Code particularly Articles 19, 20,
and 21 are broad enough to cover the American law concept of tort
and to include civil liability arising from crime. The same negligent
act causing damage to another may produce civil liability arising
from a felony under Article 100 of the Revised Penal Code (Chap.
10.) or create an action for quasi-delict under Articles 2176 to 2194.
(Chap. 6; see Arts. 32-36, Chap. 4.)
The provision on the common law doctrines of proximate
cause and contributory negligence (Art. 2179.) is a recognition
of the applicability of the common law concept of tort in our
jurisdiction. Indeed, many provisions and precepts in the Civil
Code are rules from the Anglo-American law.

(4) Broad interpretation of Article 2176. — Quasi-delict is broad
enough to include civil liability arising from a criminal offense.
(see Chap. 10.)
(a) Even long before the effectivity of the new Civil
Code, the Supreme Court has already adopted a broad interpretation of Article 1902 (now Art. 2176.) of the old Civil
Code. In a case involving alleged malicious interference in
the performance of a contract, it ruled:

“x x x we take the rule to be that a person is liable
for damage done to another by any culpable act, and
by ‘culpable act’ we mean any act which is blameworthy when judged by accepted legal standards. The idea
thus expressed is undoubtedly broad enough to include
any national conception of liability for the tortious acts
to be developed in any society. x x x’’ (Daywalt vs. La
Corporacion de los Padres Agustinos Recoletos, 39 Phils.

24

TORTS

587 [1919].)

(b) In Salen vs. Balce (107 Phil. 745 [1960].), involving
the application of Article 2180(2) on the vicarious liability
of parents and employers, the Supreme Court adopted the
doctrine that said article includes intentional acts covered
by Article 2176 for to hold otherwise “would result in the
absurdity that while for an act where mere negligence
intervenes the father or mother may stand subsidiarily liable for the damage caused by his or her son, no liability
would attach if the damage is caused with criminal intent.
Verily, the void that apparently exists in the Revised Penal
Code is subserved by the particular provision of our Civil
Code as may be gleaned from some recent decisions of the
Court which cover equal or identical cases.’’ (see Fuellas vs.
Cadano, 3 SCRA 361 [1961].)

“To hold that quasi-delict covers only fault or negligence not punished by law is to give the legal institution
of culpa aquiliana a very little scope and application in
actual life. Death or injury to persons and damage to
property through any degree of negligence, even the
slightest, would have to be indemnified only through the
principle of civil liability arising from a crime. In such
state of affairs, what sphere would remain for quasi-delicto
or culpa aquiliana? We are loath to impute to the lawmaker
any intention so absurd and anomalous. x x x We will
not use the literal meaning of the law to smother and
render almost useless a principle of such ancient origin
and such full-grown development as culpa aquiliana or
quasi-delito, which is conserved and made enduring in
Articles 1902 to 1910 [now 2176 to 2194] of the Spanish
Civil Code.’’ (Barredo vs. Garcia, 73 Phil. 607 [1942].)

(c) This expanded concept of quasi-delict in Article 2176
was followed in many cases particularly in Elcano vs. Hill
(77 SCRA 98 [1977].), Virata vs. Ochoa (81 SCRA 472 [1978].),
Andamo vs. Court of Appeals (191 SCRA 195 [1990].), and Wylie
vs. Rarang (209 SCRA 357 [1992].)
In Elcano, the Supreme Court said:

INTRODUCTION

25

“x x x Article 2176, where it refers to ‘fault or negligence,’ covers not only acts ‘not punishable by law’
but also acts criminal in character, whether intentional
and voluntary or negligent. Consequently, a separate
civil action lies against the offender in a criminal act,
whether or not he is criminally prosecuted and found
guilty or acquitted, provided that the offended party is
not allowed, if he is actually charged also criminally, to
recover damages on both scores, and would be entitled
in such eventuality only to the bigger award of the two,
assuming the awards made in the two cases vary.

In other words, the extinction of civil liability referred
to in paragraph (e) of Section 3 [now Sec. 2, last par.],
Rule 111, refers exclusively to civil liability founded on
Article 100 of the Revised Penal Code, whereas the civil
liability for the same act considered as a quasi-delict
only and not as a crime is not extinguished even by
a declaration in the criminal case that the criminal act
charged has not happened or has not been committed
by the accused. Briefly stated, We here hold, in reiteration of Garcia, that culpa aquiliana includes voluntary
and negligent acts which may be punishable by law.’’

(d) The Supreme Court has used in a number of times
the term “tort’’ in deciding cases involving quasi-delicts as
well as delicts. For example, in Naguiat vs. National Labor
Relations Commission (269 SCRA 564 [1997].), it said: “Essentially, ‘tort’ consists in the violation of a right given or
the omission of a duty imposed by law. Simply stated, tort
is a breach of legal duty.’’ This very broad definition would
encompass an act or omission causing damage to another
motivated by willful intent, malice or bad faith.

Chapter 2
ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS
Cause of action in tort.
(1) Test. — The fundamental test of whether a person has a
cause of action in tort against another is whether the defendant
owed plaintiff any legal duty to do something which defendant wrongfully did not do, or not to do something which he
wrongfully did so, in violation of the legal right or rights of
the plaintiff.
(2) Elements. — Its essential elements are:
(a) a legal right in favor of a person;

(b) a correlative legal obligation on the part of another;
and

(c) a wrong in the form of an act or omission in violation of said legal right and duty with consequent injury or
damage to the plaintiff.

The plaintiff may maintain an action against the defendant
for the recovery of damages suffered by him and/or other appropriate relief.
Existence of legal right and duty.
(1) Necessity for existence. — The existence of a legal right
and of a legal duty corresponding to such right are essential
elements of a cause of action of tort. A cause of action cannot
exist without the concurrence of a default and of a right and
duty. Moreover, no right or duty is considered as a basis for an
action of tort except a legal right or duty which is established
on principles of general utility.
26

ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS

27

(a) a legal right has been described as a well-founded
claim enforced by sanctions; and

(b) a legal duty is that which the law requires to be done
or forborne to a determinate person or to the public.

(2) Moral rights and duties. — There is no necessary identity,
or even relation, between a legal right or duty and a moral
right or duty. Those duties which are dictated merely by good
morals, or by humane considerations, are not within the domain
of the law. (74 Am. Jur. 2d 626-674.)

Rights and duties of a purely moral character are not such
rights and duties as afford a basis for tort. Conduct, even though
improper and causing harm to another, does not constitute a tort
unless a legal, as distinguished from a moral, right is violated
or duty disregarded. One who acts under a moral obligation or
charitable impulse does not thereby assume a legal duty that
will afford a basis for tort liability.
(3) Assumption of gratuitous undertaking. — The mere voluntary assumption of an undertaking does not in and of itself
impose a legal duty which would be the basis of tort liability.
But such voluntary assumption of an undertaking which is not
imposed as a duty will render one who undertakes it liable for
an injury which results from improper performance of it.
The person so rendering the gratuitous service to another is
not subject to liability for discontinuing the services if he does
not thereby leave the other in a worse position than he was in
when the services were began. (see Chap. 6, under Art. 2176.)

(4) Bounds of rights and duties sufficing as basis of tort. — The
underlying principle is that one owes another the duty fixed
by law not negligently or willfully or wrongfully to do an act
which will probably injuriously affect him, unless there be legal
justification. (Chap. 3.) Practical considerations must at times
determine the bounds of the rights or duties sufficing as the
basis of tort.
It has been stated that most duties imposed by the law of
torts arise out of circumstances and are based on foreseeability
or reasonable anticipation that harm or injury is a likely result
of acts or omissions. (see Art. 2179, Chap. 6.)

28

TORTS

(5) Cases of novel impression. — Despite the requirement
that the disregard of duty be one of legal cognizance, the fact
that there is no direct precedent involving the protection of a
precisely similar right or the recognition of an identical duty,
is not conclusive against the existence of a tort, although that
fact may properly be considered as tending to show the nonexistence of tort. When an injury cognizable by law is shown
to have been inflicted on plaintiff, the fact that the manner of
infliction of injury is novel, is not deterrent to application thereto
of recognized principles of law.
(6) Nature of right invaded. — The right may be one which
is available only against one or more particular persons, which
is sometimes described as a right in personam, or it may be one
available against all persons, or, as it is sometimes called, a right
in rem, the latter being, however, the typical right which is made
the subject of protection by the law of torts. However, despite
the generality of the right with respect to those against whom
it is available, it must, to be recognized in tort, be particular as
regards the possessor or person who can assert it.
The right invaded must be one personal to the party injured and may not be such as pertains to the public at large,
as distinguished from some or any of the individuals of whom
it is composed.

(a) A private individual cannot maintain an action in tort
to redress a wrong of a public nature unless he has sustained
some injury which is special and peculiar to himself.
(b) A breach of duty owed to one class of persons cannot be the basis of a right in favor of a person not within
that class. (84 C.J.S. 927-928.)

(7) Privity of contract as element in tort. — Where a contract
co-exists with duties purely legal and non-consensual in origin
and nature, the question whether such duties exist with respect
to, and hence, confer correlative rights on, persons not parties
nor privy to the contract, depends on the nature of the duties.
(a) If the duties attach to a relation or status created
by the contract, as incidents imposed thereon by the law,
no correlative rights exist beyond the limits of the relation

ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS

29

thus established; hence; there is no duty as to anyone not
a party or privy to such relationship.

(b) If the duties involved arise, without reference to any
relation assumed by contract, from circumstances in which
the presence or absence of a contract is equally immaterial,
in a legal point of view, they are not restricted to persons
who are parties or privies to a contract which happens to
be involved, and the presence of the contract does not destroy their rights which flow from other circumstances with
respect to the contract. (Ibid. 929; see Chap. 1.)
Violation of legal right and duty.
In order to constitute a tort, not only must a right and duty
exist, but there must be conduct constituting a breach of duty or
a violation of a right. There must be a wrong done. Conversely,
the absence of legal injury is fatal to the existence of a tort. The
wrongfulness of defendant’s acts is not measured by the extent
of the damage threatened. (Ibid. 931-932.)
(1) Lawful exercise of legal rights. — The proper exercise of a
legal right cannot constitute a legal wrong to another for which
an action will lie.
An act is not wrongful if done in the exercise of an equal or
superior right. A person may use all such force as is reasonably
necessary to protect his person or property, and one is not an
insurer that his lawful acts shall not injuriously affect others.
Nevertheless, even the exercise of a right, in a manner which is
unlawful, constitutes a tort, wherein the liability arises on and
for the manner of acting, rather than the act itself.
(2) Positive and negative conduct. — A breach of duty being
essential, there must be some unlawful act or omission at the
foundation of every tort. Torts ordinarily arise from the commission of acts wrongful either in themselves or by reason of
the manner of their performance, where there is a duty to act,
and a right to require action, imposed by law. There may be
torts based on the nonfeasance or omission to act.
Otherwise stated, the act causing the injury may result from
nonfeasance, malfeasance, or misfeasance. (Ibid. 932-933.)

30

TORTS

(3) Duty to avoid harm to others. — A cause of action arises
where that is not done which ought to have been done, so that a
tort may result from acts of omissions as well as of commission
in the fulfillment of a non-contractual duty of care. However,
the mere refusal of a person to do what he is not legally bound
to do is not actionable, since those duties which are dictated
merely by good morals or by humane considerations are not
within the domain of the law.
The duty to protect against wrong is, generally speaking
and excepting certain intimate relations in the nature of a trust,
a moral obligation only, not recognized or enforced by law. (74
Am. Jur. 2d 628-629.)
(4) Duty to refrain from acts harmful to others. — Whenever, by
an act which cannot be justified in law, and which could have
been avoided, a person inflicts an immediate injury by force,
he is legally answerable in damages to the party injured. Under
this rule, one injured by the wrongful act of another to which
he has in no respect contributed is entitled to compensation
from the wrongdoer.
In determining whether an act is wrongful, a test frequently
applied is the ability of a prudent man in the exercise of ordinary care to foresee that injury or damage will naturally or
probably result. (74 Am. Jur. 2d 628-629.)
(5) Concurrence of breach of duty and invasion of right. — Not
every wrongful invasion of a protected right causing damage
gives rise to a tort. To have that result, there must not only be
an invasion of right, but the invasion must be wrongful, that
is, it must result from the breach or omission of a correlative
duty; otherwise, it will not be tortious. Generally, there can be
no liability for purely accidental injuries, nor can tort be based
on involuntary conduct in the face of an overpowering emergency for which the actor is not responsible.

To constitute a tort, defendant must not only commit a
wrongful act or breach of duty, but the improper or unlawful
conduct must be voluntary and such as to interfere with or
injuriously affect plaintiff’s rights. (86 C.J.S. 933-934.)

ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS

31

Relation between wrongful act
and injury.
(1) Generally. — To authorize a recovery in tort, privity
must exist between the act of the wrongdoer and the injury
complained of. On the other hand, privity is not an element of
a tort, where the wrongful act charged be the proximate or legal
cause of the injury complained of. (see Art. 2179, Chap. 6.)
(2) Intentional injuries. — The rule that to render one liable
for an injury to another resulting from a wrongful act, the injury
must have been the proximate consequence of such act, is applied strictly where the act or omission resulting in the injury is
merely negligence. It is relaxed in its application so as to cover
a wider field or resulting injuries where the act is a willful or
malicious tort, as distinguished from mere negligence.
In this connection, intended results are often regarded as
proximate results.

Example: Where the defendant intends by his conduct
to cause serious mental distress and, in fact, does so, and
such distress is a substantial factor in bringing about the
suicide of the victim of such distress, a cause of action for
wrongful death arises.
However, just as in the cases of mere negligence, it is essential
in actions involving intentional or malicious injuries that the injury
complained of be the proximate result of the wrongful act. There
is no liability for remote harms even in intentional torts.

(3) Willful acts. — In respect of willful acts (without intention to cause injury), there is authority for the rule that persons
may be held liable for the consequences that flow therefrom
as a proximate cause thereof, whether they could have been
foreseen or anticipated or not.
(a) In such cases, intervening causes are especially likely
not to be held to preclude liability of the wrongdoer.

Example: A streetcar company has been held liable for the
injury sustained by a boy passenger whom the conductor
of the car compelled to give up his seat and make room for

32

TORTS

other passengers by whom he was carried and pushed out
on the front platform which, like the inside of the car, was
full of people, and from which he was knocked by the rush of
another passenger, and was run over by the car, although the
immediate cause of the injury was the rush of the passenger.
(Sheridan v. Brooklyn City & N.R. Co., 36 NY 39.)

Even in the case of willful acts, however, it is recognized that
there may be intervening forces sufficient to preclude liability.

Example: It has been declared that if the person who first
threw the squib had thrown it in a place where its explosion
would have been harmless, and someone, without reason
or excuse, had picked it up, and started it again, with the
injurious results that followed its explosion, this would have
presented a case where the new and intervening cause would
have been held the proximate cause, and sufficient to stand
for the misfortune. (Thompson v. Louisville & N.R. Co., 91
Ala 496, 8 So 406.)
(4) Unlawful acts. — In cases involving unlawful acts (without intention to cause injury), intervening causes are especially
likely not to be held to preclude liability of the wrongdoer.
This rule prevails even though the defendant did not intend
the particular injury which followed.
Examples:

(a) One in an unlawful pursuit of another under circumstances which are likely to cause damage to a third person
has been held liable for such injury.

(b) Unlawfully and maliciously shooting and wounding a
dog lying near his owner’s house has been held as the proximate cause of an injury to a woman who is thrown down by
the sudden and violent rushing of the wounded dog into the
house, for which the person who shot the dog is, therefore,
liable. (Isham v. Dow, 70 VT 588, 41 A 585.)
Some cases even seem to countenance the theory that one
who willfully commits an unlawful act is liable for remote and
unlikely consequences. It is a general rule, however, that an
unlawful act must be a proximate cause of an injury if liability

ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS

33

is to be predicated thereon. This rule applies to acts in violation
of a statute. (74 Am. Jur. 2d 642-645.)
Damage as an element of tort.
In addition to the elements of tort heretofore discussed,
another element requisite thereto is damage resulting from
the breach of duty and invasion of right. Mere imaginary or
speculative grievances without tangible injury to any legal right
afford no ground for judicial action. (Part II.)
(1) Nature and sufficiency. — The nature and sufficiency of
the damage constituting an essential element of tort depend
on whether the tort is one consisting of a legal wrong in itself
constituting an invasion of a right and thus, giving rise to legal
damage, or is a breach of duty not necessarily violative of legal
rights and with which some actual express damage must concur
in order to establish the violation of right essential to tort.
In the former class, damage flows from the wrongful act,
itself injurious to another’s right, although no perceptible loss
or harm accrues therefrom. In the latter, however, some specific
actual damage is a condition precedent to the tort.

Damage as an element of tort embraces injuries to person and
property. Liability for such damages cannot be avoided by merely
showing, in a personal injury case, that the person injured was
not well at the time of the injury, or that the injuries to person or
property have been or will be compensated by a third party not
in privity with the party causing the injury. (86 C.J.S. 937.)
(2) Damages recoverable. — A direct invasion of a legal right
imports damage. Whenever there is a wrongful invasion of a
clear legal right, the law infers or presumes damage sufficient
to support an action. In such case, the injury is regarded as the
gist of the action.

The general rule is that a person injured by the commission
of a tort is entitled to actual pecuniary compensation for the
injury sustained, and except where the circumstances are such
as to warrant the allowance of exemplary damages, he is limited
to such compensation. Where a legal right is to be vindicated
against an invasion that has produced no actual loss of any kind,

34

TORTS

the damages recoverable are nominal. (74 Am. Jur. 2d 625-626.)

(3) Absence of other elements. — The fact of loss to plaintiff
from defendant’s acts or omissions is not alone sufficient to
constitute a tort. In the absence of other requisite elements, it is
merely damnum absque injuria. (86 C.J.S. 938; see Chap. 6, under
Art. 2176.).)
Not every act causing damage to another creates a cause of
action. Accidents frequently occur the consequences of which the
sufferer must bear alone. Thus, one who lifts a stick to defend
himself and unintentionally strikes a bystander is not liable
for the injury inflicted thereby. Indeed, it is a well-established
maxim of the law that “damage without wrong,’’ or “damnum
absque injuria,’’ does not constitute a cause of action.
In other words, “injury’’ in its legal sense, means damage
resulting from a wrongful or unlawful act.

(a) Any damage which is occasioned by the doing of a
lawful act or the exercise of a legal right, or the doing of
a thing authorized by law, in a lawful or authorized manner, is not actionable. Hence, a person may use any lawful
means to accomplish a lawful purpose, although the means
adopted may cause damage to another.

(b) It is a general rule of law that temporary inconvenience to private persons, in common with the public in
general, occasioned by the exercise of a right conferred by
law for the benefit of the public, is damnum absque injuria,
as is any injury sustained in obeying a regulation within
the scope of the police power.
(c) An action may not be maintained for damages resulting to individuals from acts done by persons in the execution
of a public trust or for the public benefit, acting with due
skill and care and within the scope of their authority.

(d) Damages incurred in complying with the provisions
of a statute under coercion of a decree of the highest judicial
tribunal enjoining the violation thereof must be considered
damnum absque injuria. Indeed, acts done pursuant to an
existing judgment cannot be made the basis of an action for
damages for tort, even though the judgment is subsequently

ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS

35

reversed. (74 Am. Jur. 2d 630-631.)
Motive, purpose, and intent as elements
of tort.
The terms “motive,’’ “purpose,’’ and “intent’’ are frequently
used loosely, and partially at least to connote identical concepts.

(1) The term “motive’’ refers to the impelling force or underlying or subjective reason for doing an act, or the mental
state or force which induces an act of volition.
(2) Motive is frequently used to denote the object of an act
or the external or objective result desired, in which sense it is
very nearly an equivalent of the word “purpose.’’

(3) Similarly, although the term “intent’’ is frequently, and
quite accurately, used in reference to an external act or an
intelligent volition, and is thus, distinguishable from the term
“motive,’’ their use in statements of legal principles has not
always been mutually exclusive. Intent in the law of torts has
been said not to refer simply to the fact that the act itself is
intentionally done. It means that the actor acts for the purpose
of causing an invasion of another’s interest or knows that such
an invasion is resulting, or is substantially certain to result from
his conduct. (Ibid. 623.)
Materiality of motive.
It is dependent on the question of privilege. Whether a
privileged occasion existed on which defendant could rely as
justification for knowingly and intentionally causing damage
to plaintiff required determination whether, if some privilege
existed, its limits had been exceeded, or it had been lost by resort to improper means or by actions so far actuated by express
malice that all privilege ceased. (86 C.J.S. 935.)
(1) Motive is material. — Where motive is material under
the circumstances of the particular case, a bad motive, in connection with conduct which violates plaintiff’s rights, has been
held to render the conduct tortious; whereas, in the absence of
bad motives, particular conduct resulting in injury to plaintiff
has been held not to constitute a tort. (Ibid. 936.)

36

TORTS

A lawful act constitutes an actionable tort when unlawful
means are employed purposely to injure another. Where acts
constituting breach of contract were intentionally done out of
malice or ill-will, the injured party may sue in tort rather than
in contract. In both cases, tort liability is precluded in the absence of an evil motive.

A bad motive is occasionally important in determing tort
liability, especially in cases involving certain economic torts as
in the case of interference with business opportunity without
physical threat or harm (see Chap. 7.) and claims for punitive
(exemplary or corrective) damages. (Chap. 3, Part II.)
(2) Motive is immaterial. — Conduct which does not, either
by itself or because of the manner of its exercise, constitute an
invasion of the rights of another is not tortious, however bad
or malicious the actor’s motives. Although they may make a
bad act worse, malicious motives, cannot make that a wrong
which is, in its own essence, lawful.

Conversely, where an act is, either inherently or because of
the manner of performance, an unprivileged invasion of right,
the absence of malice or the presence of a good motive does not
render it any the less a tort. If the conduct is outside the zone
of privilege, it is tortious regardless of motive. (86 C.J.S. 935.)
Example: D, physician, forces treatment on P, an unwilling
patient. D may act from the motives of goodwill and in the
belief that his treatment will be best for P. He might even
believe that he has the legal right to force the treatment upon
P. But neither his good motives nor his erroneous belief that
he is acting rightfully will excuse his intended touching of
P against the latter’s will.

Here, intent not motive, is the basis of liability. A defendant whose conduct is intentional is not necessarily a
defendant who has a bad motive or who is conscious that
he is committing a wrong.
There are cases in which it has been stated that civil liability
for tort is determined by the conduct and not by the mental
state of the defendant that is, the motive of the defendant is
immaterial. A reason sometimes given for the rule is that oth-

ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS

37

erwise, the mental attitude of the alleged wrongdoer, and not
the act itself would determine whether the act was wrongful.
(74 Am. Jur. 2d 623-624.)
Torts with a particular motive or purpose.
There are, on the one hand, acts which are clearly violations
of definite legal rights, and which a good motive cannot make
less actionable. On the other hand, there are acts which a man has
a definite legal right to do without any qualification, and which,
therefore, are not actionable where done with an evil motive.

There is an intermediate class of acts which take their quality
from the motive with which, or the purpose for which, they are
done. Indeed, there are certain torts in which a particular motive or purpose constitutes an essential ingredient of the cause
of action itself. Sometimes the rule is stated to the effect that
where the lawfulness of the act is dependent on the presence
of justifiable cause, motive may be important in ascertaining
the existence of justification. (74 Am. Jur. 2d. 625.)

In this respect, it was declared in a case: “The authorities
are practically unanimous to the effect that the defendant is
liable unless he shows a justification. If this is true, it follows,
as matter of course, that his right is not absolute. It is a qualified one, and the rightfulness of its exercise depends upon all
those elements which go to make up a cause for human action.
The reasonableness of the act cannot always be satisfactorily
determined until something is known of the state of the actor’s
mind.’’ (Huskie v. Griffin, 75 NH 345, 74 A 595.)
Materiality of intent.
Liability in tort for an injury is determined by conduct, and
not the mental state or intent of the actor.

(1) Intentional act is done in ignorance. — One may do an
intentional act in ignorance that he is doing a hurt or wrong
to another, or under the honest belief that he is within the law
and his rights. Nevertheless, the law considers that one intends
the natural consequences of his own acts.

Therefore, voluntary conduct, presenting the elements of

38

TORTS

duty, breach, and damage, is tortious, although unaccompanied
by a deliberate design to injure or to commit an unlawful act.
Example: Where X playfully and without intending harm,
throws an object at Y, and hits him in the eye causing a
serious injury, Y is liable for the unintended injury.
(2) Resulting damage is different from that contemplated. — While
no one has a general license purposely to injure others, and everyone is responsible for the results of his willful acts, it is insufficient
to make particular conduct a tort that the person acting intended
to invade another’s legal rights, if his act did not so operate in
fact. A fortiori, where defendant voluntarily engages in conduct
designed to cause some damage, it is immaterial, on the question
of the existence of a tort, that the damage actually brought about
is different from that contemplated by him.
Where a willful tort is committed, the wrongdoer is responsible for the direct and proximate consequences of his act
without regard to his intention to produce the particular result.
Example: In the preceding example, if the intent of X
is to injure Y who became blind, X is responsible for the
unexpected blindness which resulted, although it was not
actually intended.
(3) Act complained of is not done unlawfully or without care. —
Where the act complained of is not done unlawfully or in the
want of due care and diligence, a wrongful intent is an essential
element. Although the ultimate motive is not bad, if the intent is
to accomplish that purpose by deliberately inflicting injury, the
goodness of the motive will not render non-tortious acts which
are torts by reason of the badness of the intent. (86 C.J.S. 936-937.)
Example: If the motive or purpose of X is to make Y stop
from a certain offensive behavior, he is still liable by reason
of the “badness of his intent,’’ i.e., to deliberately inflict injury.
Particular kinds of tortious acts.

(1) Acts intended to inflict injury. — A duty with which the
law of torts is concerned is the duty to abstain from intentional
injury to others. Therefore, it is a general rule that a cause of

ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS

39

action arises whenever one person, by an act not in the exercise
of a lawful right, causes loss or does damage to another with
an intent, either actual or constructive, to produce such harm,
without just or lawful excuse or justifiable cause or occasion.
Examples:
(a) X loads a gun and then shoots directly at Y. Here,
the court will almost inevitably conclude that X intended to
kill or injure Y unless X can prove that he did not actually
possess that intent.

(b) X blows up a car knowing that Y is in the car. In this
case, X has intentionally intended to kill or injure Y even if
he had no such desire because he was substantially certain
of the consequences of his act.
(c) In example (a), if X shoots Z reasonably believing he
is Y, X is liable, for the intent to shoot Y satisfies the intent
requirement for the shooting of Z. Here, the “transferred
intent’’ rule is applied under which the intent to commit a
tort against one victim can transfer to any other victim. It
is sufficient that the defendant intends to cause harm.
(2) Acts not intended to inflict injury. — An action may lie
for an unintentional injury, or an injury committed by mistake.
A cause of action may be predicated upon negligence, or the
failure to observe a standard of care prescribed by law, without
a conscious design to do wrong.
Examples:
(a) In the preceding first example (a), if the shooting of
Y was accidental, an action may lie for unintentional injury
predicated upon negligence.
(b) In the preceding said example (b) even if X reasonably believed that Y was not in the car, it is no defense that
he was mistaken.
(c) As a practical joke, X tells Y that her husband has
been seriously injured in an accident, and is in critical condition in the hospital. Y suffers severe emotional distress
and nervous shock, resulting in her illness. X is subject to

40

TORTS

liability to Y for her illness.
There are some particular torts, however, in which a purpose
to injure constitutes one of the ingredients of the cause of action.

(3) Malicious acts. — The terms “malice’’ and “malicious’’
have been defined not only as relating to the intentional commission of a wrongful act, but also as involving wickedness,
depravity and evil intent.
(a) An act otherwise lawful is not rendered actionable by
reason of the fact that it is done with malice. Similarly, malicious motives might make a bad case worse, but that they
cannot make that wrong which, in its own essence, is lawful.

Example: It has been held (in Rader v. Davis, 154 Iowa
336, 134 NW 849.) that a son-in-law has no right of action
“because he maliciously’’ was excluded by his father-in-law
from the latter’s premises during the burial service of his
child, the custody of which was awarded to the mother in
divorce proceedings, and which was taken by her to reside
at her father’s house.
(b) On the other hand, even a lawful act done solely out
of malice and ill-will to injure another may be actionable.
Example: It has been held that an action may lie for
written or oral falsehoods, not actionable per se nor even
defamatory, where they are maliciously published and are
calculated to produce actual damages. (Gale v. Reyes, 236
App. Div. 76, 31 NYS 2d 732.)

But, there is authority to the effect that there is no liability in tort for doing a lawful act, even though it is done
for the malicious purpose of injuring another party, where
there are also legitimate reasons for doing the act. (Brandt
v. Winchell, 170 NYS 2d 828, 148 NE 2d 160.)

(4) Willful and wanton acts. — Torts liability may be based
on willful or wanton acts.

(a) A willful act is one done intentionally, or on purpose,
and not accidentally, and willfulness implies intentional

ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS

41

wrongdoing. An injury is willful where the act which produced it was intended to have that effect.

(b) A wanton act is a wrongful act done on purpose or
in malicious disregard of the rights of others.

While willfulness or intent is an element in determining
whether the tort of wanton misconduct has been committed,
such willfulness or intent need not be proved subjectively.
The law imposes an objective standard under which in certain cases it is presumed from his conduct that the actor’s
intentions were willful or wanton.

(5) Willful or wanton negligence. — Willfulness or wantonness
imports premeditation, or knowledge and consciousness that
injury is likely to result from the act done or from the omission
to act.

Strictly speaking, it is not within the meaning of the term
“negligence,’’ which conveys the idea of inadvertence, as distinguished from premeditation or formed intention. Nevertheless,
one frequently finds in the opinions the expression “willful
negligence,’’ or “wanton negligence,’’ and it is explained that
to constitute willful negligence, the act done or omitted must
be intended, or must involve such reckless disregard of security
and right as to imply bad faith.
(6) Acts arising out of a contractual relationship. — A tort is
a wrong to another in his rights created by law or existing in
consequence of a relation established by contract, but it cannot
be based upon the contract itself. Yet breach of contract may be
treated as a tort where the law casts its separate obligation. To
recover upon that theory, the plaintiff must show not merely
that the defendant assumed an obligation under the contract,
but that out of that obligation there arose a duty to the plaintiff. A legal duty the violation of which is a tort may spring
from extraneous circumstances not constituting elements of the
contract as such, although connected with and dependent on
it. (see Chap. 1.)

Accompanying every contract, there is a duty to perform
with care, skill, reasonable expedience, and faithfulness the thing

42

TORTS

agreed to be done, and the negligent failure to observe any of
these conditions is a tort, as well as a breach of contract. The
plaintiff may elect which to pursue. Thus, duress, although it
often arises in connection with breach of contract, is nevertheless
a tort. Where a claim is grounded in duress (although it often
arises in connection with breach of contract), one who sustains
damage as a result of being subjected to duress may sue as
plaintiff in a tort action, thus obviating the need for privity of
contract. (74 Am. Jur. 2d 635-641.)
Particular types of torts.
(1) Generally. — For the law to furnish redress, the wrongful
act of the defendant must take effect upon some legal interest of the party complaining. Interests which are protected by
law embrace property rights, including contractual rights, and
personal rights, including the right to the enjoyment of one’s
reputation, the right of privacy, the right to enjoy marital and
social relations, and the right to worship according to the dictates of one’s conscience. (74 Am. Jur. 2d 645.)

The several types of tortious conduct have been classified as:
(a) Culpable and intentional acts resulting in harm;

(b) Acts involving culpable and unlawful conduct causing unintentional harm;
(c) Non-culpable acts or conduct resulting in accidental
harm for which, because of hazards involved, the law imposes absolute liability notwithstanding the abuse of fault;
and

(d) Culpable acts of inadvertence involving unreasonable
risks of harm. (86 C.J.S. 955.)

(2) Interference with property rights. — A duty with which
the law of torts is concerned is to respect the property of others. A cause of action may be predicated upon an unlawful
interference by one person with the enjoyment by another of
his private property. (Ibid. 648.)

Where a defendant, without right, without excuse, and
without being misled by the conduct of the plaintiff, has attempted to appropriate the plaintiff’s, property, or to interfere

ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS

43

with his rights, or has changed the condition of his real estate,
the defendant is compelled to undo as far as possible that which
he has wrongfully done affecting the plaintiff, and to pay the
damages. (Kershifhian v. Johnson, 210 Mass 135, 96 NE 56.)
(3) Interference with right to services. — It is a general rule of
law that one unlawfully interfering with another’s right to services is liable for actual or compensatory damages in the same
manner that he would be in case of the interference with any
other property right. If a third person tortiously inflicts physical injury upon a servant of another, as a result of which the
servant is prevented from performing the duties owing to his
master, the latter may recover from such third person damages
resulting to him.
Other instances of causes of action for loss of services include
cases of interference with the right of a husband to the services
of his wife, and with the right of a parent to the services of his
child. (74 Am. Jur. 2d. 649.)

(4) Interference with contractual rights. — In considering the
tort of interference with contractual rights, a distinction is to be
observed between interference with the formation of prospective contracts and interference with the performance of existing
contracts.

(a) The right to pursue one’s business, calling, trade, or
occupation, or the reasonable expectancy of a contract, is
a property right, which the law protects against unjustifiable or wrongful interference. Thus, wrongful or malicious
interference with the formation of a contract or the right to
pursue a lawful business, calling, trade, or occupation has
been generally held to constitute a tort.
(b) Even though no wrongful or unlawful means are
employed to accomplish the result, liability for malicious
interference may result from the intentional doing of act
without justification or excuse. Malice, in this connection, is
not to be understood in its popular sense of ill-will against a
person, but in its legal sense, as characterizing an unlawful
act, done intentionally without just cause or excuse.
(c) While the right to pursue a lawful business, calling,

44

TORTS

trade, or occupation is common and reciprocal to all, the
right is not and cannot be absolute. A person has no right
to be protected against competition. If disturbance or loss
comes as a result of competition, or the exercise of like rights
by others, it is damnum absque injuria unless some superior
right by contract or otherwise is interfered with.

However, exploitation of the competitive market should
be with lawful means and with the intent, at least in part,
to further one’s business. If conduct is directed solely to the
satisfaction of spite or ill-will and not in the advancement
of his competitive interests over his competitor, or if unfair
means are used, conduct of the person is not justified or
privileged as a competitor.
(d) A person knowingly inducing and procuring a breach
of a contract may be guilty of a tort, and it is well settled
that it is an actionable tort to interfere with an existing
contract by resort to means in themselves unlawful, such as
libel, slander, fraud, force, threats, intimidation, or coercion.

(e) The interference by a third person with a contractual
relationship, including interference with the contract without inducing a breach, as for example, by injuring persons
so that they may be disabled to perform, or by destroying
or damaging property which is the subject matter of the
contract, or by doing other acts which make performance
more burdensome, difficult or impossible, or of less or no
value to the one entitled to performance, may constitute
an actionable tort, under the theory that such interference
constitutes an invasion of the property rights of the parties
to the contract.
(f) Where a termination is procured by coercing one
of the parties to the contract, improper interference of that
character constitutes a tort available in behalf of the party
coerced and against the interferer.

(g) Mere negligent interference with a contract, or mere
nonfeasance, although resulting in a breach of another’s contract with a third person, will not subject a person to liability
of contract with a third person when he merely enters into

ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS

45

an agreement with the other with the knowledge that the
other cannot perform both it and his contract with the third
person, nor does liability exist where the breach is caused
by the exercise of an absolute right. (86 C.J.S. 955-964; see
Chap. 7.)

(5) Interference with personal rights. — Every one has a legal
right to enjoy social relations with his friends and neighbors.
Furthermore, one has a legal right to personal security in his
home, including the right of enjoyment of life, and the enjoyment of the happiness of home and the love and confidence
of his wife. One who injures another in the enjoyment of such
a right commits a tort. Similarly, it every member of a family
has a right to protect family rights against outside interference.
Ordinarily, an injury to the reputation is effected by slanderous or libelous language. But non-slanderous words, as well as
lawful acts, intended solely to injure a man in his business, are
actionable. (see Chap. 4.)

(6) Rudeness; threats; abusive language. — It is a general rule
that a cause of action may not be predicated upon mere rudeness or lack of consideration of one person for another. Again, a
mere threat to commit an injury is said not to be an actionable
private wrong, since it is only the promise of doing something
which in the future may be injurious, and may never be carried
into effect. However, where a threat of legal action prevents a
third person from giving aid necessary to the plaintiff’s bodily
security or necessary to prevent damage to his property, the
one making such threat will be liable for the resulting damage.
It is now generally recognized that disturbing or offensive
utterance, such as threats, false statements, or insulting, humiliating, scandalous, or abusive language, may give rise to an
action in tort where such language causes a mental or emotional
disturbance, or a bodily injury or illness resulting therefrom.
(74 Am. Jur. 2d 645-648; see Chap. 4.)

(7) Obstruction of, and compelling resort to, legal remedies. — One
who impedes or obstructs another’s remedy for the enforcement
of a fixed and ascertained right against a third person has been
held responsible for the injury occasioned. A like principle has

46

TORTS

been established as to perjury, or subornation of perjury.

However, there is no cause of action where no existing right
has been violated. Thus, merely compelling another to avail
himself of his legal remedy by undertaking or carrying on litigation is not such conduct as constitutes a tort. (86 C.J.S. 969.)

(8) Malicious prosecution of a criminal action. — Civil liability
may be predicated upon the malicious prosecution of a criminal
action. Where the elements constituting such a cause of action
are not present, the mere failure of the plaintiff to sustain his
action does not give rise to a cause of action in favor of the
defendant. Somewhat along the same line it has been held
that no cause of action arises out of the act of the defendant
in an action in subjecting the plaintiff to unnecessary expense
by compelling him to resort to litigation, and by interposing a
defense therein.
As a general rule, the expense incurred by the successful party
in an action, over and above the taxable costs, may not be made
the basis of a subsequent action against the unsuccessful party.
In such case, the legal costs incurred in the action are regarded
as the full measure of liability incurred by the unsuccessful
litigant. One reason assigned for the rule is that the recovery
of costs in the original action is one of the matters involved
therein, and becomes res judicata. Another reason assigned for
the rule is that it is the policy of the law not to deter a citizen
from asserting a claim he honestly deems himself entitled to
enforce because of fear of the possible consequences. (74 Am.
Jur. 2d 649-650; see Art. 2219[8], Chap. 3, Part II.)

(9) Unauthorized suit in another’s name. — A tort may arise
from the unauthorized prosecution of a suit in the name of
another, irrespective of the merits of the suit if it had been
properly brought.
(a) The gist of the tort is the improper liberty in using
the name of another person in conducting a suit by which
defendant is injured. Neither malice nor want of probable
cause is an essential element of the cause of action. Neither
is it essential to the existence of the cause of action that the
person sued without authority shall have questioned or

ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS

47

challenged the authority of the person in fact conducting
the suit at the time it is being prosecuted.
(b) While the action is usually brought by those against
whom the unauthorized suit was directed, such unauthorized
conduct has also been treated as furnishing the foundation
for an action against the person assuming to sue by the one
whose name was used without authority, for injury resulting
to the latter from such action. (86 C.J.S. 969-970.)

(9) Other particular torts. — Various acts or conduct has been
held to constitute, or not to constitute, an actionable tort under
the facts and circumstances of the particular case.

(a) Acts of public officers. — Since the exercise by one
man of a legal right cannot be a legal wrong to another,
one who, in a lawful manner, merely sets a public officer
in motion to perform a lawful act within the scope of his
authority is not liable for damages to another as a result of
such officer’s unauthorized act in the performance of his
duties. However, a person is liable where he authorizes a
public officer to do an unlawful act or a lawful act in an
unlawful manner, or to abuse, exceed, or disregard his duty
or authority, or where he counsels, directs, or participates
in the doing of any unlawful act.
(b) Injurious falsehood. — One may be legally responsible
for written or oral falsehoods maliciously circulated, which
are made with the intention of producing injury, and do
result in injury to another. Such liability may be imposed
only if the false statements are not actionable as libels or
slanders, either because they are not defamatory or for other
reasons.

The action for injurious falsehood is distinguished from
an action of libel or slander which is founded on false defamatory statements. The former action is one on the case
for damages willfully and intentionally done without just
cause, occasion, or excuse. Since the false statement injures
him only by misleading other persons into action that is
detrimental to him, it is governed by more lenient rules of
liability, although rules with respect to absolute privilege in

48

TORTS

libel and slander actions have been applied to actions for
injurious falsehood based on non-defamatory statements.

(c) Interference with right of inheritance or destruction of
will. — Ordinarily the wrongful deprivation of a person of
his just bequest under a will or the unlawful and malicious
destruction of a will resulting in loss to a beneficiary or
legatee is an actionable tort. A legatee may maintain such
an action although the legacy to him cannot be established
and admitted to probate as part of the destroyed will because only one witness supports the existence of a gift and
a statute relating to the probate of destroyed wills requires
the testimony of several witnesses.

However, the authorities are divided on the question
whether an actionable tort is committed by maliciously
interfering with a prospective right of inheritance, or by
maliciously interfering with the making of a will. Some
authorities hold that no action lies on the theory that no
legal or enforceable right has been invaded or legal duty
breached where the testator had no legal duty or obligation
to devise or bequeath any portion of his estate to an heir.
Other authorities hold that the malicious and wrongful
interference with the making of a will is actionable where
unlawful means are employed, or where force and violence
prevent another from executing the will.
(d) Trade secrets, inventions, or patents. — The misuse of,
or interference with, trade secrets, inventions, or patents may
constitute a tort, or may not constitute a tort, depending
on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Thus,
one who discloses or uses another’s trade secret, without
a privilege to do so, is liable to the other if he discovered
the secret by improper means, or his disclosure or use
constitutes a breach of confidence reposed in him by the
other in disclosing the secret to him. Also the obtaining of
an unpatented trade secret by theft, bribery, stealth, breach
of a confidential relation, or other unlawful means, violates
a property right of the owner and is a tort.
However, a licensee of an unpatented trade secret who
uses the secret beyond the scope of the license granted by

ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS

49

the owner, although liable for breach of contract, commits
no tort, or, as it is otherwise stated, no tort is committed
by one who uses information previously embraced in the
secret, if the disclosure was obtained by lawful means. (Ibid.
970-971; see Chap. 9.)
Prima facie tort doctrine.
Prima facie tort has been defined as the infliction of intentional harms, resulting in damage, without excuse or justification, by an act or a series of acts which would otherwise be
lawful. Although it is not the law that all unjustified intentional
infliction of injury is tortious, it is the sound tendency of the
law to impose liability for unjustified intentional conduct which
is calculated in the ordinary course of events to damage, and
which does, in fact, damage another.

(1) Necessity of malice. — A cause of action for prima facie tort
arises only where the defendant can be shown to have acted
maliciously, in the sense of an actual intention to harm the
plaintiff, and aside from any other motive. Phrased differently,
in order for intentional harm, inflicted without justification, to
be prima facie actionable, it must have been motivated entirely
by disinterested malevolence, that is, the intentional malicious
injury to another is done solely to harm the other.
Examples:

(a) A complaint alleging that defendant had conspired to
exclude plaintiff from a co-operative housing project because
of his religious faith was held to state a cause of action for
prima facie tort. (Bachrach v. 1001 Tenants Corp., 249 NYS
2d 855, 205 NE.2d 196.)
(b) Plaintiff could recover on a showing that after defendant had seduced a domestic servant in defendant’s home,
he represented to plaintiff that the woman was virtuous
and induced plaintiff to marry her, which plaintiff would
not have done if he had known the facts, and that after the
marriage the servant gave birth to defendant’s child. (Kujek
v. Gold-man, 150 NY 176, 44 NE 773.)

50

TORTS

Since a malicious and unjustifiable attempt to injure plaintiff,
unaccompanied by any motive of self-profit, is an essential ingredient in an action for prima facie tort, defendant’s self-interest
in pursuing profits for himself negatives the necessary malice.

(2) Necessity of special damage. — An allegation of special
damages is an essential element of a cause of action for prima
facie tort. There can be no recovery for prima facie tort unless
special damages are alleged with sufficient particularity. In other
words, there must be a showing of “special’’ as distinguished
from “general’’ damages.
Example: An attempt to state a cause of action for prima
facie tort on the basis of publication of defamatory matter identifying plaintiff (businessman) as a Communist or
Communist sympathizer was unsuccessful because of the
failure to sufficiently allege special damage. To recover, the
complaint should have stated specifically the items of loss
claimed by plaintiff, going so far as to give the names of
employers, customers, or others who are claimed to have
taken their business away from plaintiff. (Faulk v. Aware,
Inc., 155 NYS 2d 720, 160 NYS2d 621.)
There is, however, some authority that under certain circumstances an allegation of special damages is unnecessary.
(74 Am. Jur. 652-655.)
Example: It has been held that where the complaint,
charging a conspiracy to damage plaintiff in its business as
a sales representative, set forth a course of conduct which
indicated the intentional infliction of temporal damages,
an allegation of special damages was unnecessary where a
course of conduct rather than slander of title was involved.
(Grattan v. Societa Per Azzioni Cotonificio Cantoni, 137
NYS2d 255.)
Doctrine of strict or absolute liability
in tort.
A person whose actions caused harm to another may be
held responsible for that harm simply because he had acted.
In other words, he is liable although without fault.

ELEMENTS AND TYPES OF TORTS

51

The courts have evolved the doctrine of absolute liability or
liability without fault, which is predicated on the theory that
the actor, realizing the hazard of his undertaking, nevertheless
assumes the risk connected therewith, and, notwithstanding he
is free from all wrong, and has used utmost care, he nevertheless is liable for any invasion of the person or property rights
of another.
(1) Basis of liability. — Under the doctrine liability rests not
on negligence, but on intentional doing of that which person
knows or should, in exercise of ordinary care, know may in
normal course of events reasonably cause loss to another. (86
C.J.S. 934.)

(2) Application. — The rule of strict liability is said to be
applicable in situations in which social policy requires that
defendant make good the harm which results to others from
abnormal risks which are inherent in activities that are not considered blameworthy, because they are reasonably incident to
desirable industrial activity. The basis of liability in such cases
is the intentional behavior in exposing the community to the
abnormal risk.

It has been said that the so-called rule of “absolute liability’’
is not absolute at all, since both the propriety of its application
in the first instance, and any defense against it, are conditioned
by the limitations imposed by the fundamental standards which
pervade all tort law: the conduct of the reasonably prudent
man under the circumstances, and its procedural corollary that
whenever there is dispute in the evidence or uncertainty as to
whether that standard is met, the question is one for the court.

(a) The most common application of the doctrine of strict
or absolute liability in tort has been in products liability cases.
The doctrine is applied to the manufacturer of an article
placed on the market, where the manufacturer knows that
the product is to be used without inspection for defect, also
known as the doctrine of “enterprise liability.’’
(b) The rule applies in instances where “abnormally’’
dangerous activities are carried on. Among activities which
have been held to be abnormally dangerous so as to impose
absolute liability are the use of chemical sprays, the stor-

52

TORTS

age of a large amount of natural gas in a populated area,
the storage of explosives generally, and the conduction of
blasting operations which result in damage to adjoining
property. But in the case of damage or injury caused as the
result of a nuclear accident or explosion, it has been held
that liability can be predicated only upon negligence and
not upon a theory of strict liability. (Bartholomae Corp. v.
United States, 253 F2d 716, 73 ALR2d 1293.)

When harm results from the intervention of an unforeseeable act of nature or an “act of God,” liability does not fall on
the defendant. Thus, in a case, the doctrine was not applied
to damage caused by the rupture of an underground water
main under the exclusive control of a municipal corporation,
where such rupture damaged telephone lines when water
ran into a telephone company manhole since water mains
did not constitute an abnormal condition. (Pacific Northwest
Bell Tel. Co. v. Port of Seattle, 80 Wash 2d 59, 491 P2d 1037.)
(c) Other examples of absolute liability may be found
in certain cases involving injuries by animals and under
statutes imposing absolute liability upon aircraft owners
or lessees for injury to persons or property on the ground
brought about by the rise, flight, or fall of the aircraft or its
contents. (74 Am. Jur2d 632-633; see Arts. 2183, 2187, 2190,
2191, 2193, Chap. 6.)

Chapter 3
JUSTIFICATIONS AND DEFENSES
AGAINST LIABILITY
Generally.
In general, in a tort action, the defendant may assert any
justification or defense sufficient to show that the plaintiff is
not entitled to recover.
Legal liability in tort is predicated upon acts which cannot
be justified in law, or which are done without just or lawful
excuse, or justifiable cause or occasion. An act causing damage
to another does not create liability where the person doing the
act has a legal excuse or justification therefor.

Where the tort is intentional rather than the result of negligence, the law generally recognizes fewer defenses, and is more
inclined to find that defendant’s conduct was the legal cause
of the harm complained of. (74 Am. Jur. 656.)
Justifications and defenses defeating
a claim.
Courts recognize many justifications or privileges and defenses that can be invoked by a defendant to defeat a claim that
would otherwise be actionable.

(1) Justifications for conduct furnish the defendant a legal
privilege to commit acts that would, except for the justification,
count as a tort. They assert that the defendant’s act was rightful and that others should act in the same way. They furnish
defenses to intentional tort claims.
When a judge believes the defendant’s harmful act was justified, the judge believes that people in general can rightly act as
53

54

TORTS

the defendant did. For instance, reasonable acts in self-defense
may cause harm, but the judge who sanctions self-defense as a
justification believes that, even so, people in general can rightly
act as the defendant did under the circumstances that confronted
him. (D.B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts, 2000 Ed., p. 156.)
(2) Justifications are defenses but they differ from the latter.

The term “defenses’’ usually refers to affirmative defenses,
meaning those on which the defendant has the burden of proof
and the burden of persuasion. This burden means that the defendant must produce appropriate evidence on his defense and
must also persuade the court to believe it. The court’s doubts
about facts necessary to show the plaintiff’s prima facie case work
against the plaintiff; the court’s doubts about the facts necessary
to the defendant’s defense work against the defendant.

Examples of defenses are the statute of limitations or prescription that are based on policy, defenses like contributory
negligence that are based on the plaintiff’s own misconduct, or
defenses like governmental immunity based on the defendant’s
status. (Ibid., p. 155.)
The outcome of the case may be determined by the plaintiff’s
failure to prove or persuade the court on essential elements like
negligence or causation. It may equally be determined by the
defendant’s failure to prove or persuade the court that a good
affirmative defense exists. The difference, of course, is that the
plaintiff has the burden of proof when it comes to elements of
the case. In contrast, the defendant has the burden of producing
evidence about defenses like contributory fault and likewise the
burden of persuading the trier of fact about what the evidence
shows. (Ibid., p. 493.)
In case of prima facie tort.

In an action for prima facie tort (Chap. 2.), the courts generally
state that the acts complained of are not a basis for recovery
unless done without justification. This appears to be another
way of stating that the acts must have been done out of “disinterested malevolence.‘’ Thus, any acts done in furtherance of
defendant’s business from whatever motive will not subject the
defendant to liability for prima facie tort.

JUSTIFICATIONS AND DEFENSES AGAINST LIABILITY

55

In other words, the defendant’s motive must be solely malicious, uncoupled with such motives, as self interest, profit,
or business advantage. But no matter what justification is advanced, it must be one which the law will recognize. (74 Am.
Jur. 656-657.)
Mistake.
In many cases, torts are committed by one who acts under
a mistake of fact or mistake of law or legal rights.

For example, the defendant who mistakenly believes that he
is entering his own land when in fact he is entering land that
belongs to the plaintiff is a trespasser. That is to say, mistake
is no defense to the trespass claim. Similarly, the defendant’s
mistaken belief that the plaintiff is a criminal does not give the
defendant a privilege to effect an arrest or commit a tort.

Several specific privileges protect the defendant who acts
as a reasonable person under the circumstances. If one of these
privileges applies, and if the defendant acts under a mistake
that a reasonable person would make, then mistake is at least
relevant in determining whether the defendant acted as a reasonable person.
Self-defense is an example of a privilege to act as a reasonable person under the circumstances. If the plaintiff appears to
menace the defendant with guns and knives, the defendant is
privileged to respond with a reasonable amount of force in self
defense. In a sense, the defendant may be mistaken, but it is not
his subjective mistake that relieves him of liability; it is the objective reasonableness of his conduct. (D.B. Dobbs, op. cit., p. 157.)

Example: X strikes Y with a piece of wood and Y by
reasonable force is able to disarm X. Y is not privileged
thereafter to inflict a similar beating upon X.
Illegal transaction.
It is a general policy of the courts not to permit a person to
take advantage of his own wrong, or to found any claim on his
own iniquity. As a general rule, no action will lie to recover on

56

TORTS

a claim based or depending upon an illegal transaction to which
the plaintiff was a party. However, to deprive the wrongdoer
of such protection of the law, the unlawful act must be one
which the law recognizes as having a causal connection with
the injury complained of.
If at the time of the injury the plaintiff was engaged in an
act in violation of the law which did not proximately contribute
to his injury, such circumstance does not preclude a recovery.
This rule has frequently been applied in cases where the plaintiff
was participating in gambling activities at the time he incurred
an injury which had no causal relation to such activities. (74
Am. Jur. 2d. 657-658.)

Example: One who broke a tooth when he bit into a hard
metallic substance in a piece of candy manufactured by
the defendant was held not barred from recovering for his
injuries because he had won the box of candy in an illegal
bingo game, in the absence of any causal relation between
the illegal act and the injury. (Bagre v. Daggett Chocolate
Co., 126 Conn 659, 13 A2d 757.)
Necessity or self-protection.
(1) Public necessity or safety. — In general, acts pertaining
to the public welfare, convenience, necessity or safety which
conflict with private rights are not tortious. This doctrine of
necessity applies with special force to the preservation of human
life, but is not confined thereto. However, although conduct be
non-tortious by reason of necessity, a subsequent exceeding of
one’s authority may constitute one a trespasser ab initio.
(2) Defense of property. — An act which would otherwise be
a tort may be justified by necessity. This is true of an act done
under the influence of a pressing danger, such as an entry on
the land of another to avoid bodily harm, or to save property
from destruction. Indeed, the destruction of property, or even
life itself, may be justified by necessity. An occasion creating
such justification is one involving the conservation of life.

A necessity sufficient to justify an injury to the property of
another may arise out of an act of God or of strangers, such

JUSTIFICATIONS AND DEFENSES AGAINST LIABILITY

57

as public enemies. Thus, since there is a great public interest
in the prevention of crime and in the speedy apprehension of
criminals, the victim of a crime as vicious as armed robbery is,
during the course of such criminal act, excused, justified, and
privileged to use ordinary resistance which might otherwise
cause actionable damages. He is chargeable with no greater
legal duty to use over to protect himself. (74 Am. Jur. 2d. 659.)
Example: Where a tavern owner grabbed a robber’s gun
and in the resultant scuffle numerous shots were fired and
a patron of the tavern was injured, it has been held that no
recovery could be had for the injuries to the patron since the
tavern owner’s action was justified, excused, and privileged.
(Yingst v. Pratt, 139 Ind. App 695, 220 NE 2d 276.)
(3) Self-defense. — A cause of action in tort is generally
regarded as arising in favor of persons who are without fault
proximately contributing to the injury. But the mere fact that
a person is committing a tortious act at the time he is injured
does not necessarily preclude his right to maintain an action
for such injury.
Thus, a person unlawfully assaulted, when without fault,
may stand his ground and repel force with force to the extent
which to him seems reasonably necessary to protect himself
from injury. Similarly, as an incident to the right to acquire and
own property, the owner has the right to defend and protect it
against aggression, and if he commits an assault in so doing,
the law will justify him. (74 Am. Jur. 2d. 657.)

Example: X points a revolver at a Y, a policeman, and
theatens to shoot him. If Y cannot prevent X from shooting
him by any other means then by shooting X, he is privileged
to do so.
In the same example, if X is lame, and while still some
distance away starts towards Y brandishing a knife and
threatening to kill him and Y knows that he can with perfect safety avoid X’s attack, Y is not privileged to stand his
ground and shoot X.

Destruction of plaintiff’s property to prevent
spread of fire.
(1) By public authorities. — It is a general rule that where necessary to insure the public safety, the legislature may under its
police power authorize public authorities summarily to destroy
property without legal process or previous notice to the owner.
The summary destruction of buildings by public authorities is
regarded as a valid exercise of the police power when its purpose
is to avert or stay a general conflagration. No compensation need
be made to the owners of such buildings.

It is generally held that the destruction of private property
by a city or municipal fire department in order to stay a conflagration is not such an act as will sustain an action for damages
against the city or municipality.
(2) By an individual or a community of individuals. — In regard
to the question of the liability of an individual for the destruction of property to prevent the spread of fire, aside from the
justification consisting of an act done in the line of official duty,
the right of an individual to take or destroy private property
in self-defense or for the protection of life, liberty, or property
is a natural right, of which the government cannot deprive the
citizen, and is founded on necessity, and not expediency.
It may be exercised by a single individual for his own
personal safety or security or for the preservation of his own
property or by a community of individuals in defense of their
common safety or in the protection of their common rights.

(a) To constitute a justification, it is not essential that the
defendant’s own property be in imminent danger. A danger
to the property of third persons may be sufficient to constitute
justification, especially where the act is done by an individual
at the instance of those whose property is placed in jeopardy.
But, to constitute a justification for the act of a person in
destroying property of another to prevent the spread of a
conflagration, the act of the defendant must be reasonable.
(b) To secure the benefit of the justification, the necessity
must be immediate and imperative, and in some cases at

JUSTIFICATIONS AND DEFENSES AGAINST LIABILITY

59

least, extreme and overruling or overwhelming. The necessity must be clearly shown; mere expediency or utility will
not suffice. The parties will be held liable in cases where
the necessity does not exist. (74 Am. Jur. 2d 659-661.)
Consent to the act.
A person may, by language or acts, manifest a definite assent to conduct which would be violative of his rights in the
absence of consent. Such conduct, therefore, will not constitute
a tort. Such assent may also arise by operation of law. In order
to sustain this defense, however, there must be a true assent.
A claimed assent which is not voluntary, or which is given by
one incapable of assenting, is insufficient. (84 C.J.S. 930.)

One cannot maintain an action for a wrong occasioned by
an act to which he has consented, under the familiar maxim
“volenti non fit injuria,’’ except where the act involves the life of a
person, or a breach of the peace, or amounts to a public offense.
Similarly, if a person who claims to have received injury as
a result of the trespass of another consented to the act of such
person, no action of trespass lies. (74 Am. Jur. 2d. 661.)
Practical jokes; horseplay.
(1) The fact that there was no intention to inflict injury on
the plaintiff is no justification for an act which does in fact cause
injury. Therefore, the fact that a practical joke is the cause of an
injury to a person does not excuse the perpetrator from liability
in damages for the injury sustained. One who plays dangerous
practical jokes on others takes the risk that his victims may not
appreciate the humor of his conduct, and will be liable for an
injury resulting from such practical joke.

(2) A similar rule obtains where an injury was caused,
without intent, as the result of “horseplay.’’ When one does an
act which proves injurious to another, an action in tort arises in
favor of the injured person although the act was done without
malice and no injury was intended.
Examples:

60

TORTS

(a) Where friends were playing a game at the end of
which two one-dollar bills were left lying on the corner of
the table and the plaintiff in a playful spirit asked if the
defendant did not want to get them off the table, whereupon he pushed the money off the table. The defendant
then stooped down to get the money, grabbed plaintiff’s
right foot, and gave it a sharp jerk upward causing serious
injuries to plaintiff. The defendant was held liable for tort.
(Newman v. Christensen, 149 Neb. 471, 31 NW 2d 417.)
(b) An innocent bystander injured while other persons
are engaged in horseplay, throwing objects at each other
with the intention of striking each other, although in sport
and without intent to cause injury, may recover for injuries
from those participating in the horseplay. (Keel v. Hanline
[Okla.] 331 P2d 397, 74 Am. Jur. 2d. 661-662.)
Proximate cause of the injury.
Generally, a tortfeasor is liable for the natural and proximate
consequences of his act, but, unless the act complained of is the
proximate cause of the injury, there is no legal liability.

To constitute proximate cause, the injury must be the natural
and probable consequence of the wrong, that is, such a consequence as, under the surrounding circumstances of the case,
might or ought to have been foreseen as likely to flow from
the wrong. The particular result need not have been foreseen
so long as the wrongdoer might have foreseen that some injury
might result. The proximate cause need not be the sole cause.
If several efficient causes contribute to an injury, and without
the operation of each the injury would not have occurred, each
cause is a proximate cause.
As a general rule, where an independent unforeseen cause
intervenes between the original default and the final result and
is sufficient to stand as the cause of the mischief, the second
cause is ordinarily regarded as the proximate cause and the
other the remote cause. If the intervening cause is incidental,
the law looks to the original wrongful act which caused the
wrong. (86 C.J.S. 941-943, 945; see Art. 2179, Chap. 6.)

JUSTIFICATIONS AND DEFENSES AGAINST LIABILITY

61

Contributory negligence of plaintiff.
Contributory negligence is conduct on the part of plaintiff
which falls below the standard of conduct to which he should
conform for his own protection and cooperates with the negligence of defendant in bringing about the plaintiff’s harm. The
plaintiff may recover damages but the courts shall mitigate the
damages to be awarded. (see Art. 2179, Chap. 6.)

As a general rule, contributory negligence of the plaintiff is
no defense to an action for an intentional tort, nor is it a defense
to strict liability. In other words, when the defendant’s activity is
a dangerous one imposing strict liability, a plaintiff will be barred
from recovery not by mere contributory negligence but, if he has
discovered the danger, he will be barred by his own wanton, willful, or reckless misconduct which materially increases the probabilities of injury or which amounts to an invitation to injury, or
at least indifference to consequences. (74 Am. Jur. 2d 658.)
For plaintiff’s conduct to bar recovery altogether, his negligence towards his protection must be cause-in-fact and a
proximate cause of the accident resulting in damage or injury.
Last clear chance on plaintiff.

The doctrine of last clear chance instructs the court to disregard the plaintiff’s contributory negligence if the defendant’s
negligence occurred after the plaintiff’s contributory negligence.
It is based purely on chronology. So, if the negligent defendant
had the last clear chance to avoid causing damage or injury to
the plaintiff, then the plaintiff’s contributory negligence is not
a bar to recovery. (see Art. 2179, Chap. 6.)
On the other hand, if the plaintiff was the one who had the
last clear opportunity up until the moment of injury of avoiding
harm to himself, his failure to take that chance by the exercise
of reasonable care has the effect of relieving the defendant from
liability unless the plaintiff’s negligence is merely contributory
to his injury and not the proximate cause thereof.
Assumption of risk by plaintiff.

A plaintiff who fully understands a risk of harm to himself

62

TORTS

or his property brought about by the defendant but nevertheless voluntarily chooses to assumes it is not entitled to recover.
(see Art. 2179, Chap. 6.) By voluntarily exposing himself or his
property interests to a risk, the plaintiff is deemed to consent
to that risk.

The assumption may be express when by contract or otherwise, a plaintiff explicitly agrees to accept a risk; or implied,
when the plaintiff’s voluntary exposure is derived merely from
his conduct in relation to the risk, and not from explicit assent.
Immunities.

The term “immunity’’ is used to refer to the special protections sometimes accorded to certain defendants like public entities or officers and family members for reasons of public policy.
It protects a defendant from tort liability. Unlike a justification
or defense, it is not dependent on the plaintiff’s behavior, but
on the defendant’s status or relationship to the plaintiff.
(1) Historically, spouses could not sue each other. This immunity was rooted in the doctrine regarding the legal identity
of spouses.
(2) Parent-child immunity precludes tort actions between
parents and their non-adult children. The immunity has never
been held to bar property or purely economic torts.

(3) Governmental immunity protects the government from
tort liability. It should be distinguished from public official immunity which protects government officers and employees from
tort liability incurred in the course of performing their official
functions. (Diamond, Levine & Madden, Understanding Torts,
1996 Ed., pp. 261-264.)
Other defenses.

There is no tort liability and consequently, no liability for
damages in the following cases:

(1) When the defendant’s conduct was involuntary because
force or intimidation was employed upon him;

(2) When the act is in the exercise of a right or the performance of a duty, unless there is abuse (Art. 19, Chap. 4.)
(3) When the damage is caused by a fortuitous event (Art.

JUSTIFICATIONS AND DEFENSES AGAINST LIABILITY

63

1174, under Art. 2178, Chap. 6.);

(4) When the defendant acted under emergency conditions
or circumstances and his conduct did not contribute to the
creation of the emergency (Art. 2179, Ibid.);
(5) When the defendant who is responsible for acts or omissions of another proves the exercise of due diligence (Art. 2180,
2184, Ibid.);

(6) When the prescriptive period for quasi-delict has expired
(Art. 1146, under Art. 2194, Chap. 6.);

(7) When the defendant’s conduct otherwise tortious has
not caused any damage or injury; and
(8) When the plaintiff has voluntarily waived or abandoned
his right to enforce the civil liability of the defendant for damages.

The plaintiff has the burden of proof when it comes to the
elements of his case: fault or negligence, causation, and damage
(Chap. 2.), while the defendant has the burden of producing
evidence about justifications or defenses. Where the existence
of fault or negligence is presumed by law (see Arts. 2180, 2183,
2191, Chap. 6.), the burden of proof is shifted to the defendant
to overcome the presumption by way of defense.

In a few instances, the law imposes strict liability as a matter
of legal policy, irrespective of the defendant’s fault or negligence.

TORTS INVOLVING HUMAN RELATIONS
Reason for Chapter on Human Relations.

The provisions in this Chapter which are not found in the
old Civil Code are devoted to the regulation of human relations.
They incorporate not only basic principles of equity and justice
but also universal moral precepts not expressly recognized by
specific provisions of law. They cover not only negligent acts
but also intentional torts involving malice or bad faith.
According to the Code Commission:

Therein are formulated some basic principles that are
to be observed for the rightful relationship between human
beings and for the stability of the social order. The [old]
Civil Code merely states the effects of the law, but fails to
draw out the spirit of the law. This Chapter is designed
to indicate certain norms that spring from the fountain of
good conscience. These guides for human conduct should
run as golden threads through society, to the end that law
may approach its supreme ideal, which is the sway and
dominance of justice.
Needless to say, every sound legislation from time
immemorial has sought to act as an arbiter between the
conflicting rights of individuals. To accomplish so noble a
commission, the lawmaker makes it imperative that every
one duly respect the rights of others.’’ (Report, p. 39.)
Article 19. Every person must, in the exercise
of his rights and in the performance of his duties,
act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe
honesty and good faith.

Principle of abuse of rights.
Article 19 rejects the classical and traditional theory that “he
who uses a right injures no one.’’

(1) Exercise of rights entails corresponding duties. — The right
of one person entails corresponding duties to respect the rights
of others. Its exercise must never be abused, especially to the
prejudice of another. When a right is exercised in bad faith for
an illegitimate purpose or with the intention to injure another,
and without any benefit to himself, even when the act itself is
not illicit, there is an abuse of right, giving rise to liability for
damages. A right disappears the moment it is abused. A person
is protected only when he acts in the legitimate exercise of his
rights, i.e., he acts with justice, gives everyone his due, and
observes honesty and good faith.

The absence of good faith is essential to abuse of right. Good
faith, however, is always presumed but the court is given the
discretion to determine under the circumstance whether or not
there has been an abuse of right.
(2) Concept of torts expanded. — Article 19 is intended to
expand the concept of torts (see Chaps. 1, 6.) by granting adequate legal remedy for the untold number of moral wrongs
which is impossible for human foresight to provide specifically
in statutory law.
In civilized society, men must be able to assume that others
will do them no intended injury — that others will commit no
internal aggressions upon them; that their fellowmen, when they
act affirmatively will do so with due care which the ordinary
understanding and moral sense of the community exacts and that
those with whom they deal in the general course of society will
act in good faith. The ultimate thing in the theory of liability is
justifiable reliance under conditions of civilized society. (University of the East vs. Jader, 121 SCAD 314, 325 SCRA 804 [2000].)
Norms of human conduct set as guides.
(1) Standards in the exercise of rights and performance of duties.
— Article 19, known to contain what is commonly referred to
as the principle of abuse of rights, sets certain standards which
may be observed not only in the exercise of one’s rights but

66

TORTS

Art. 19

also in the performance of one’s duties. These standards are the
following: to act with justice; to give everyone his due; and to
observe honesty and good faith.
The law, therefore, recognizes the primordial limitation on
all rights: that in their exercise, the norms of human conduct
set forth in Article 19 must be observed.
(2) Right becoming a source of legal wrong. — A right, though
by itself legal because recognized or granted by law as such,
may nevertheless become the source of some illegality. When a
right is exercised in a manner which does not conform with the
norms enshrined in Article 19 and results in damage to another,
a legal wrong is thereby committed for which the wrongdoer
must be held responsible.
Although the requirements of each provision are different,
Articles 19, 20, and 21 are all related to each other. (Albenson
Enterprises Corp. vs. Court of Appeals, 217 SCRA 16 [1993].)

(3) Remedy for violation of rule of human conduct. — Article 19
lays down a rule of conduct for the regulation of human relations
and for the maintenance of social order. It does not provide a
remedy for its violation. Generally, an action for damages under
either Article 20 or Article 21 would be proper. (Globe Mackay
Cable and Radio Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 176 SCRA
778 [1989].)
Test of abuse of rights.
There is no hard and fast rule which can be applied to determine whether or not the principle of abuse of rights may be
invoked. The question of whether or not the principle of abuse
of rights has been violated, resulting in damages under Articles
20 and 21 or other applicable provision of law, depends on the
circumstances of each case. (Ibid.)
Modern jurisprudence does not permit acts which, although
not unlawful, are anti-social. There is undoubtedly an abuse of
right when it is exercised for the only purpose of prejudicing or
injuring another. When the objective of the actor is illegitimate,
the illicit act cannot be concealed under the guise of exercis-

Art. 19

TORTS INVOLVING HUMAN RELATIONS

67

ing a right. The principle does not permit acts which, without
utility or legitimate purpose cause damage to another, because
they violate the concept of social solidarity which considers
law as rational and just. Hence, every abnormal exercise of a
right, contrary to its socio-economic purpose, is an abuse that
will give rise to liability.
The exercise of a right must be in accordance with the purpose for which it was established, and must not be excessive
or unduly harsh; there must be no intention to injure another.

Ultimately, however, and in practice, courts, in the sound
exercise of their discretion, will have to determine all the facts
and circumstances when the exercise of a right is unjust, or
when there has been an abuse of right. (Baron’s Marketing
Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 286 SCRA 98 [1998], citing
1 Tolentino, supra, 1990 ed., p. 298.)
Instances of abuse of rights.
(1) Where a creditor (defendant) taking advantage of its
knowledge that insolvency proceedings were to be instituted
by the debtor if the creditors did not some to an understanding as to the manner of distribution of its assets among them,
schemed and effected the transfer of its credit to its sister
company in the United States where the debtor’s plane was
and said company secured a writ of attachment in the court
therein thereby giving control over the said plane. Although
the assignment was not violative of Sections 32 and 70 of the
Insolvency Law, the defendant acted in bad faith and betrayed
the trust and confidence of the other creditors in violation of
the principles declared in Article 19. (Velayo, etc. vs. Shell Co.
of the Philippines, Ltd., 100 Phil. 186 [1956].)

(2) Where the bank refused to approve the lease of sugar
quota by its debtor-mortgagor, knowing that the agricultural
year was about to expire at which time the mortgagor would
not be able to utilize the mortgaged sugar quota although the
difference between the price demanded by the bank and the
proposed lease was only a small amount (about P200), and
hardly anybody was willing to lease at a higher rate. (Philip-

TORTS

Art. 19

pine National Bank vs. Court of Appeals, 83 SCRA 237 [1978].)
(3) Where a public officer who had authority to approve
clearances of resigning employees did not issue a clearance to
the plaintiff but issued the same to all other employees who
were similarly situated as the plaintiff. (Llorente vs. Court of
Appeals, 202 SCRA 309 [1991].)
(4) Where the principal unreasonably terminated a general
agency agreement for selfish reasons so that it can appropriate
insurance business of the agent and receive the commission on
the renewal of insurance policies of clients sourced from his
agency, although the agency was revocable at will. (Valenzuela
vs. Court of Appeals, 190 SCRA 1 [1990]; Sevilla vs. Court of
Appeals, 160 SCRA 171 [1988].)

(5) Where the winning party in a court litigation did not
give the occupants of the house sought to be demolished sufficient time to remove their personal belongings as a result of
which said belonging was damaged. (Albetz Investments, Inc.
vs. Court of Appeals, 75 SCRA 310 [1977].)

(6) Where the termination of an employment was effected
allegedly as a retrenchment measure to prevent losses, but was
made in bad faith because another was subsequently hired.
(AHS/Phil. Employees Union vs. National Labor Relations
Commission, 149 SCRA 5 [1987].)

(7) Where an educational institution is guilty of misleading a
student into believing the latter had satisfied all the requirements
for graduation when such is not the case. It is the contractual
obligation of the school to timely inform and furnish sufficient
notice and information to each and every student as to whether
he or she had already complied with all the requirements for
the confernment of degree or whether they would be included
among those who will graduate. (University of the East vs.
Jader, 325 SCRA 804 [2000].)
(8) Where the defendant airline instead of giving expert and
proper medical treatment to plaintiff, a pilot who suffered head
injures when the airplane he was flying crash-landed beyond
the running, simply referred him to a company physicians,
despite his repeated requests for such medical assistance, and

Art. 20

TORTS INVOLVING HUMAN RELATIONS

69

later discharged him from its employ. (Philippine Airlines, Inc.
vs. Court of Appeals, 106 SCRA 391 [1981].)

(9) Where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad
faith in refusing to pay a debt, when, after buying a TV set
on installment basis, did not pay for it and even sold it, then
executed a promissory note to settle extrajudicially the criminal
complaint for estafa, and which he failed to pay despite repeated
demands. (United General Industries, Inc. vs. Paler, 112 SCRA
404 [1982].)
Art. 20. Every person who, contrary to law, willfully or negligently causes damage to another, shall
indemnify the latter for the same.
Willful or negligent act done contrary
to law.
(1) Scope. — This article is broad enough to cover all legal
(not moral) wrongs done in violation of law, whether willfully
or negligently. It embraces the Spanish-Philippine concept of
quasi-delict (Art 21761; and the tort in Anglo-American jurisprudence.

(2) General sanctions for violation of other laws. — The rule
in Article 20 compliments the principle of abuse of rights enumerated in Article 19. It “pervades the entire legal system, and
renders it impossible that a person who suffers damage because
another has violated some legal provisions, should find himself
without relief.’’ (Report of the Code Commission, p. 39.) It furnishes the general sanction for violations of other laws which
do not specifically provide any sanction, penalty or liability for
such violation.

(3) Conduct may be both a crime and a quasi-delict. — Any
person who willfully or negligently causes damage to another
in his person, his property, or in any other right shall be obliged
to indemnify the latter. A felony may be committed by means

Art. 21

of deceit (when performed with deliberate intent) or by means
of fault or negligence. (Art. 3, Revised Penal Code.) If the fault
or negligence does not constitute a penal offense, the actor is
liable only for quasi-delict under Article 2176.
In either case, it is essential that the act is voluntary for the
obligation to indemnify to arise.
Art. 21. Any person who willfully causes loss or
injury to another in a manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public policy shall compensate
the latter for the damage.
Willful acts contrary to morals, good customs
or public policy.
(1) Legal remedy for “untold number of moral wrongs.’’ — Article
21 seeks to remedy the “countless gaps in the statutes, which
leave so many victims of moral wrongs helpless, even though
they have actually suffered material and moral injury.” (Globe
Mackay Cable and Radio Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 176
SCRA 778 [1989].)
According to the Code Commission:

“The Code Commission has gone further than the sphere
of wrongs defined or determined by positive law. (see Art.
20] Fully sensible that there are countless gaps in the statutes, which leave so many victims of moral wrongs helpless, even though they have actually suffered material and
moral injury, the Commission has deemed it necessary, in
the interest of justice, to incorporate the rule in Article 21.
An example will illustrate the purview of the foregoing
norm:
‘A’ [through deception or trickery] seduces the
nineteen-year old daughter of ‘X.’ A promise of marriage
either has not been made, or can not be proved. The girl
becomes pregnant. Under the present laws, there is no
crime, as the girl is above eighteen years of age. Neither
can any civil action for breach of promise of marriage
be filed. Therefore, though a grievous moral wrong has

Art. 21

TORTS INVOLVING HUMAN RELATIONS

71

been committed, and though the girl and her family
have suffered incalculable moral damage, she and her
parents cannot bring any action for damages. But under
the proposed article, she and her parents would have
such a right of action.

Thus, at one stroke, the legislator, if the foregoing rule is
approved, would vouchsafe adequate legal remedy for that
untold number of moral wrongs which it is impossible for
human foresight to provided for specifically in the statutes.
But, it may be asked, would not this proposed article
obliterate the boundary line between morality and law? The
answer is that, in the last analysis, every good law draws
its breath of life from morals, from those principles which
are written with words of fire in the conscience of man. If
this premise is admitted, then the proposed rule is a prudent earnest of justice in the face of the impossibility of
enumerating, one by one, all wrongs which cause damage.
When it is reflected that while codes of law and statutes
have changed from age to age, the conscience of man has
remained fixed to its ancient moorings, one can not but feel
that it is safe and salutary to transmute, as far as may be,
moral norms into legal rules, thus imparting to every legal
system that enduring quality which ought to be one of its
superlative attributes.
Furthermore, there is no belief of more baneful consequences upon the social order than that a person may with
impunity cause damage to his fellow-men so long as he does
not break any law of the State, though he may be defying
the most sacred postulates of morality. What is more, the
victim loses faith in the ability of the government to afford
him protection or relief.

The same observations may be made concerning injurious
acts that are contrary to public policy but are not forbidden
by statute. There are countless acts of such character, but
have not been foreseen by the lawmakers. Among these are
many business practices that are unfair or oppressive, and
certain acts of landholders and employers affecting their
tenants and employees which contravene the public policy

72

TORTS

Art. 21

of social justice.’’ (Report, pp. 39-41.)

(2) Compared with Article 20. — Under Article 21, the act is
done willfully and is contrary to morals, good customs or public
policy, while under Article 20, the act is done either willfully
or negligently and is contrary to law. Thus, under Article 21,
liability for damages may arise even from acts which do not
constitute a violation of statute law if such acts are contrary to
morals, good customs or public policy. It is immaterial whether
the damage is caused by a positive act or omission as long as it
is willful, i.e., the actor was aware of its injurious consequence
to the person injured or to a third party.
Moral damages may be recovered. (Art. 2219[10], Chap. 3,
Part II.)

(3) Compared with Article 19. — There is a common element
under Articles 19 and 21, and that is, the act must be intentional.
However, Article 20 does not distinguish: the act may be done
either “willfully,” or “negligently.” Under any of these three (3)
provisions of law, an act which causes injury to another may be
made the basis for an award of damages. (Albenson Enterprises
vs. Court of Appeals, 217 SCRA 162 [1993].)
(4) Complaint must asks for damages. — Article 21 presupposes losses or injuries material or otherwise, which one may
suffer as a result of the violation. Where the complaint does not
ask for damages but merely seek a judicial declaration that the
plaintiffs are “the co-architects in the construction of a hospital,
so as to enhance their professional prestige,’’ Article 21 cannot
be invoked. (Ruiz vs. Secretary of National Defense, 9 SCRA 1
[1963].)
(5) Rulings under Article 21. —

(a) Where defendant, a married man, thru an ingenious
scheme or trickery, seduced an unmarried woman 24 years
of age to the extent of making her fall in love with him and
having clandestine love affairs with her. (Pe vs. Pe, 5 SCRA
200 [1962]; Quimiguing vs. Icao, 34 SCRA 132, 1970.)
(b) Where petitioner forcibly abducted private respondent, and succeeded in having carnal knowledge with her
against her will and co-habiting with her for 21 , and there-

Art. 22

73

after promising to marry her in order to escape criminal
liability, only later to renege on such promise. (Buñag, Jr.
vs. Court of Appeals, 211 SCRA 440 [1992].)

(c) Where defendant did not arrive at the wedding, after all the preparations and publicity, and was never heard
from again. This is not a mere breach of promise to marry.2
(Wassmer vs. Velez, 12 SCRA 648 [1964].)

(d) Where Meralco cut respondent’s electric supply for
failure of the latter to pay his electric bills, without at least
prior 48-hour written notice required by law. The action
was also held indicative of an intent to cause mental and
moral suffering in violation of Article 21. (Manila Electric
Company vs. Court of Appeals, 157 SCRA 243 [1988].)
Art. 22. Every person who through an act of performance by another, or any other means, acquires or
comes into possession of something at the expense
of the latter without just or legal ground, shall return
the same to him.
Acquisition of benefit without just
and legal cause.
Article 22 “compels the return of a thing acquired “without
just or legal ground.’’ This provision embodies the doctrine
that no person should injustly enrich himself at the expense
of another, which has been one of the mainstays of every legal
system for centuries. It is most needful that this ancient principle
be clearly and specifically consecrated in the proposed Civil
Code to the end that in cases not foreseen by the lawmaker, no
one may unjustly benefit himself to be prejudice of another.’’
(Report of the Code Commission, pp. 41-42.)
Article 22 is based on the principle of unjust enrichment

2
A mere breach of promise to marry is not an actionable wrong otherwise many innocent men may become the victims of designing and unscrupulous females. (Estopa vs.
Pransay, 109 Phil. 680 [1960]; Hermosisima vs. Court of Appeals, 109 Phil. 629 [1960].) Actual
damages, however, may be recovered for breach of promise to marry, such as wedding
expenses, and for anything given or losses incurred because of the promise. (see Garcia
vs. Del Rosario, 3 Phil. 189 [1904]; Domalagan vs. Bolifer, 33 Phil. 471 [1916].)

74

TORTS

Art. 22

that “no one should unjustly enrich himself at the expense of
another.’’ The provisions on quasi-contracts are based on this
doctrine. (Art. 2142.3) Note, however, that in the quasi-contract
of solutio indebiti (undue payment), it is essential that there be
a mistake in payment, while this is not necessary in an action
under Article 22.

There is unjust enrichment, for example, when a building
contractor is denied payment for increased labor cost validly
incurred and additional work validly rendered with the owner’s
express or implied agreement. (H.L. Carlos Construction, Inc.
vs. Marina Properties Corp., 421 SCRA 428 [2004].)
It is not essential to create the obligation to make restitution for the benefits received that the recipient should himself
be guilty of fault or any tortious conduct where it is just and
equitable under the circumstances that such restitution be made.
Enrichment at the expense of another, however, is not per se
prohibited. It must be “without just or legal cause.’’
Requisites of action.
Article 22 treats of what has been designated accion in rem
verso or actions for recovery what has been given or paid to
another without just or legal cause.

In order that this remedy may prosper the following requisites must be present:
(1) The defendant has been enriched, i.e., he has acquired
or come into possession of something;

(2) The enrichment has been brought about through the act
or performance of the plaintiff, defendant, or a third party, or
any other means;
(3) The plaintiff has incurred a loss, i.e., the enrichment has
been at his expense;
(4) The enrichment is without just or legal ground; and

(5) There is no other remedy on contract, quasi-contract,

Art. 2142. Certain lawful, voluntary and unilateral acts give rise to the juridical
relation of quasi-contract to the end that no one shall be unjustly enriched or benefited at
the expense of another. (n)

Art. 1174. Except in cases expressly specified by the law, or when it is otherwise

delict, or quasi-delict.

“The injury to the plaintiff need not be the cause of the
enrichment of the defendant. It is enough that there be some
relation between them, that the enrichment of the defendant
would not have been produced had it not been for the fact
from which the injury to the plaintiff is derived. But if there is
no connection whatsoever between the defendant’s enrichment
and the plaintiff’s injury, the accion in rem verso does not lie.’’
(A.M. Tolentino, Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Civil
Code, 1953 Ed., Vol. 1, p. 77.)
Nature of remedy.

The action is a subsidiary remedy. “If there is an available
action under any other institution of positive law, that action
must be resorted to, and the action under the present article
will not lie. So that if the plaintiff who claims an injury delayed
his action under the rules of contract, quasi-contract, crime, or
quasi-delict, and thereby became barred by prescription, he
cannot switch around and bring an action under this article for
the damages he could have recovered in the action he neglected
to bring.’’ (Ibid.)
Measure of indemnity.

The indemnity that can be recovered is either the amount of
loss suffered by the plaintiff or the amount of unjust enrichment
obtained by the defendant, whichever is lower. In other words, the
recovery cannot be more than the amount of loss but may be less.
By way of illustration, if the amount of loss is P10,000, while
the amount of unjust enrichment is P12,000, the plaintiff can
recover only P10,000, the amount of his loss, but if the amounts
are reversed, the recovery cannot exceed P10,000, the amount
by which the defendent has been enriched.
Art. 23. Even when an act or event causing damage to another’s property was not due to the fault
or negligence of the defendant, the latter shall be
liable for indemnity if through the act or event he
was benefited.

76

TORTS

Art. 24

Liability for damage without fault or negligence
of party benefited.

Generally, a person is not liable for loss or damages produced by fortuitous or accidental causes in the absence of fault
or negligence on his part. Article 23 qualifies the general rule
in Article 20. It provides another exception to Article 1174.4 It
imposes the duty to indemnify even without fault or negligence
provided there is benefit (see Art. 1711, Chap. 8.)
Article 23 is based on equity. The person benefited is liable
only to the extent of his enrichment. The Code Commission
gives the following example:

“Without A’s knowledge, a flood drives his cattle to the
cultivated highland of B. A’s cattle are saved, but B’s crop
is destroyed. True, A was not at fault, but he was benefited.
It is but right and equitable that he should indemnify B.’’
(Report, p. 41.)
Art. 24. In all contractual, property or other relations, when one of the parties is at a disadvantage
on account of his moral dependence, ignorance,
indigence, mental weakness, tender age or other
handicap, the courts must be vigilant for his protection.

Protection of persons suffering from
a disadvantage or handicap.

Under the doctrine of parens patria (“parent or guardian of
the country’’), the State has the sovereign power to provide
protection to rights and property of persons who are non sui
juris such as minors, insane and incompetent persons. Thus,
the State is considered the parens patria of such classes of persons who are incapable of protecting themselves (see Gov’t. of

the Phils. vs. Monte de Piedad, 35 Phil. 728 [1996]; People vs.
Baylon, 57 SCRA 114 [1974].)

Article 24 imposes upon the courts of justice the duty of
vigilance for the protection of persons under disability in all
contractual, property, and other relations. It qualifies Article
11595 on the binding effect of contractual obligations between
the contracting parties and Article 3 that “Ignorance of the law
excuses no one from compliance therewith.’’ Thus, in consonance
with the principle expressed in Article 24, the courts may grant
the termination or modification of a contract entered into by an
obligor afflicted with a special weakness, or exempt him from
the sanction imposed by law or extend him any other relief,
whenever through no fault of his, he needs judicial protection.
According to the Code Commission, Articles 24 and 13326
are intended to protect the laboring class many of whom are
in one of the conditions referred to. (Report, p. 16.)
Art. 25. Thoughtless extravagance in expenses for
pleasure or display during a period of acute public

Thoughtless extravagances in expenses.
The right to own things includes the right to possess, use
enjoy, consume, and alienate, and even destroy them. Generally,
a person has a right to make use of his property, spend or waste
it, or even destroy it provided he does not injure others. (see

Art. 1332. When one of the parties is unable to read, or if the contract is in a language
not understood by him, and mistake or fraud is alleged, the person enforcing the contract
must show that the terms thereof have been fully explained to the former. (n)
Another provision which embodies similar principle:
Art. 1337. There is undue influence when a person takes improper advantage of his
power over the will of another, depriving the latter of a reasonable freedom of choice.
The following circumstances shall be considered: the confidential, family, spiritual and
other relations between the parties, or the fact that the person alleged to have been unduly
influenced was suffering from mental weakness, or was ignorant or in financial distress.

Art. 431.) The use of property, however, bears a social function
to contribute to the common. (Sec. 6, Art. XII, Constitution.) In
other words, the right to property is not unlimited. Article 25
imposes a limitation upon this right. Under the police power
of the State, the courts may order that thoughtless extravagance
in expenses for pleasure or display be stopped during a period
of acute public want or emergency.

Ostentatious display of wealth and wasteful frivolity by
the rich may unwittingly arouse envy, discontent, and even
resentment among the masses who, because of poverty, find
it difficult to provide themselves, with the basic necessities of
life and who may thereby become more keenly conscious of
the great gap between the rich and the poor. Truth to tell, not
a few of those belonging to the marginalized sectors of society
attribute their dire economic straits to government neglect of
their interests. This situation can be taken advantage of by
undesirable elements with their own selfish agenda to foment
social unrest and political instability.
The action may be instituted at the instance of any government or private charitable institution.
Art. 26. Every person shall respect the dignity,
personality, privacy and peace of mind of his neighbors and other persons. The following and similar
acts, though they may not constitute a criminal offense, shall produce a cause of action for damages,
prevention and other relief:
(1) Prying into the privacy of another’s residence;
(2) Meddling with or disturbing the private life or
family relations of another;
(3) Intriguing to cause another to be alienated
from his friends;
(4) Vexing or humiliating another on account of
his religious beliefs, lowly station in life, place of
birth, physical defect, or other personal condition.
Respect for human personality.
The following are the rights protected under Article 26:

Art. 26

TORTS INVOLVING HUMAN RELATIONS

79

(1) Right to personal dignity (No. 4.);

(2) Right to human personality which includes the right to
personal security;
(3) Right to privacy (Nos. 1 and 2.);
(4) Right to peace of mind;

(5) Right to family relations (No. 2.); and
(6) Right to social intercourse. (No. 3.)

The acts enumerated in Article 26 do not exclude “similar
acts’’ for which an injured person may sue for relief, i.e., action
for action for damages, prevention, or other relief. Moral damages may be recovered for the acts mentioned. (Art. 2219[10].)
Note that liability is incurred though the acts may not constitute a criminal offense.
Human personality exalted.
The Code Commission expressed the purpose of Article 26
and the importance of protecting the rights mentioned above
from the acts enumerated in the provision as well as similar
acts, as follows:
“The sacredness of human personality is a concomitant
of every plan for human amelioration. The touchstone of
every system of laws, of the culture and civilization of
every country, is how far it dignifies man. If in legislation,
inadequate regard is observed for human life and safety;
if the laws do not sufficiently forestall human suffering or
do no try effectively to curb those factors or influences that
wound the noblest sentiments; if the statutes insufficiently
protect persons from being unjustly humiliated, in short, if
human personality is not properly exalted — then the laws
are indeed defective. Sad to say, such is to some degree the
present state of legislation in the Philippines. To remedy
this grave fault in the laws is one of the principal aims of
the Project of Civil Code. Instances will now be specified.

Art. 26

cope with the interferences and vexations mentioned in Article 28 [now 26]. The privacy of one’s home is an inviolable
right. Yet the laws in force do not squarely and effectively
protect this right.

The acts referred to in No. 2 are multifarious, and yet
many of them are not within the purview of the laws in
force. Alienation of the affection of another’s wife or husband, unless it constitutes adultery or concubinage, is not
condemned by the law, much as it may shock society. There
are numerous acts, short of criminal unfaithfulness, whereby
the husband or wife breaks the marital vows, thus causing
untold moral suffering to the other spouse. Why should not
these acts be the subject-matter of a civil action for moral
damages? In American law they are.

Again, there is the meddling of so-called friends who
poison the mind of one or more members of the family
against the other members. In this manner many a happy
family is broken up or estranged. Why should not the law
try to stop this by creating a civil action for moral damages?
Of the same nature is that class of acts specified in No. 3:
intriguing to cause another to be alienated from his friends.

Not less serious are the acts mentioned in No. 4: vexing
or humiliating another on account of his religious beliefs,
lowly station in life, place of birth, physical defect or other
personal condition. The penal laws against defamation and
unjust vexation are glaringly inadequate.
Religious freedom does not authorize anyone to heap
obloquy and disrepute upon another by reason of the latter’s religion.

Not a few of the rich people treat the poor with contempt
because of the latter’s lowly station in life. To a certain extent
this is inevitable, from the nature of the social make-up, but
there ought to be a limit somewhere, even when the penal
laws against defamation and unjust vexation are not transgressed. In a democracy, such a limit must be established.
The courts will recognize it in each case. Social equality is
not sought by the legal provision under consideration, but
due regard for decency and propriety.

Art. 27

Place of birth, physical defect and other personal conditions are too often the pretext of humiliation cast upon
persons. Such tampering with human personality, even
though the penal laws are not violated, should be the cause
of civil action.

The article under study denounces ‘similar acts’ which
could readily be named, for they occur with unpleasant

Art. 27. Any person suffering material or moral
loss because a public servant or employee refuses
or neglects, without just cause, to perform his official duty may file an action for damages and other
relief against the latter, without prejudice to any
disciplinary administrative action that may be taken.
Refusal or neglect of a public servant to perform
his official duty without just cause.
In order that an action under Article 27 may prosper, the
following requisites must be present:

(1) The defendant is a public official or employee charged
with the performance of official duties;

(2) He refuses or neglects to perform his official duty in
favor of the plaintiff;
(3) The refusal or neglect is without just cause; and

(4) The plaintiff suffers injury, i.e., material or moral loss,
as a consequence of the defendant’s inaction.
Remedies available.
The legal provision gives the plaintiff a cause of action for
damages, other relief, and possible disciplinary administrative
action against the defendant for dereliction of official duty.

(1) Defense of good faith not available. — The good faith of
the public officer or employee is not a defense because the
discharge of the duties of public office is imperatively required

82

TORTS

Art. 28

by law although the absence of malice may be considered in
mitigation of the damages for which the defendant is liable.

(2) Basis of civil action for damages. — The civil action for
damages may be based on Article 27, or on quasi-delict under
Article 2176 (see Art. 1162.), if it does not constitute a criminal
offense; otherwise, under Article 100 of the Revised Penal Code
(see Art. 1161.) subject to the limitation in Article 2177 that the
injured party is prohibited from recovering damages twice for
the same act or omission.

(3) Action limited to nonfeasance. — The provision speak of
the refusal or neglect to perform an official duty which the law
requires him to do. It creates a cause of action, not for wrongful official action but for unjustifiable official in action. It does
not cover malfeasance and misfeasance, but only nonfeasance.
Neither does it extend to cases covered by Articles 20 and 21.

(4) Action, a supplementary one. — The action provided in
Article 27 is a supplementary one; no action can be brought
under it against a public official or employee when the action
can be based on Articles 20 and 21. (A.M. Tolentino, Comments
and Jurisprudence on the Civil Code, Vol. 1 [1953 ed.], p. 109.)
Art. 28. Unfair competition in agricultural, commercial or industrial enterprises or in labor through
the use of force, intimidation, deceit, machination or
any other unjust, oppressive or highhanded method
shall give rise to a right of action by the person who
thereby suffers damage.
Unfair competition in enterprises
or in labor.

“The above provision in necessary in a system of free enterprise. Democracy becomes a ventable mockery if any person
or group of persons by any unjust or high-handed method may
deprive others of a fair chance to engage in business or earn a
living.’’ (Report of the Code Commission, p. 31.)

“This Article is intended to lay down a general principle
out-lawing unfair competition, both among enterprises and
among laborers. x x x because same tends to undermine free

enterprise. While competition is necessary in a free enterprise,
it must not be unfair.’’ (Memorandum of the Code Commission,
L.J., Aug. 31, 1953.)
Unfair competition may constitute a criminal offense. (see
Arts. 186, 187, 188, 189[1], Revised Penal Code.) It shall give rise
to indemnity for damages, and the civil action may be pursued
independently of the criminal prosecution. What is actionable
under Article 28 is not any competition but one that is “unfair’’
causing damage to another.
Note that whether competition is fair or unfair depends
principally on the “method’’ used, and not on the damage
caused. (see Chaps. 2, 7.)
Art. 29. When the accused in a criminal prosecution is acquitted on the ground that his guilt has not
been proved beyond reasonable doubt, a civil action
for damages for the same act or omission may be
instituted. Such action requires only a preponderance of evidence. Upon motion of the defendant,
the court may require the plaintiff to file a bond to
answer for damages in case the complaint should
be found to be malicious.
If in a criminal case the judgment of acquittal
is based upon reasonable doubt, the court shall so
declare. In the absence of any declaration to that effect, it may be inferred from the text of the decision
whether or not the acquittal is due to that ground.
Civil action for damages against accused
acquitted on reasonable doubt.
The Code Commission gave the following reasons for Article 29:

“The present [old] rule that the acquittal of the accused
in a criminal case also releases him from civil liability is
one of the most serious flaws in the Philippine legal system.
It has given rise to numberless instances of miscarriage of
justice, where the acquittal was due to a reasonable doubt

84

TORTS

Art. 29

in the mind of the court as to the guilt of the accused.
The reasoning followed is that inasmuch as the civil
responsibility is derived from the criminal offense, when
the latter is not proved, civil liability cannot be demanded.
This is one of those cases where confused thinking leads
to unfortunate and deplorable consequences. Such reasoning
fails to draw a clear line of demarcation between criminal
liability and civil responsibility, and to determine the logical
result of the distinction.
The two liabilities are separate and distinct from each
other. One affects the social order and the other, private
rights. One is for the punishment or correction of the offender while the other is for reparation of damages suffered
by the aggrieved party. The two responsibilities are so different from each other that article 1813 [now 2034] of the
present [Spanish] Civil Code reads thus: ‘There may be a
compromise upon the civil action arising from a crime; but
the public action for the imposition of the legal penalty shall
not thereby be extinguished.’ It is just and proper that, for the
purposes of the imprisonment of or fine upon the accused,
the offense should be proved beyond reasonable doubt. But
for the purpose of indemnifying the complaining party, why
should the offense also be proved beyond reasonable doubt?
Is not the invasion or violation of every private right to be
proved only by a preponderance of evidence? Is the right
of the aggrieved person any the less private because the
wrongful act is also punishable in the criminal law?
For these reasons, the Commission recommends the adoption of the reform under discussion. It will correct a serious
defect in our laws. It will close up an inexhaustible source of
injustice — a cause for disillusionment on the part of innumerable persons injured or wronged.’’ (Report,
pp. 45-46.)
Declaration in judgment of ground
of acquittal.

Every person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly
liable. (Art. 100, Revised Penal Code; see Chap. 10..) A person
acquitted in a criminal case is not relieved from civil liability

Art. 30

TORTS INVOLVING HUMAN RELATIONS

85

for the same act or omission, where the acquittal is based on
the ground that the guilt of the accused has not been proved
beyond reasonable doubt.

Acquittal on reasonable doubt is not evidence of innocence
of the accused who may have, in fact, committed the offense
of which he was charged. The acquittal is not due to the nonexistence of the crime from which liability might arise, but
because the accused is not, in the eyes of the court, sufficiently
proven as the perpetrator of the crime. Hence, the courts are
required by Article 29 to declare in the judgment whether or
not the acquittal is based on reasonable doubt.
When civil action based on delict
deemed extinguished.

Civil liability in a criminal case cannot exist where the accused
has been found to be not the author of the act complained of.

If the acquittal proceeds from a finding in a final judgment
in the criminal action that the act or omission from which the
civil liability may arise did not exist, the civil action based on
delict may be deemed extinguished. (Sec. 2, last par., Rule 117,
Rules of Court; see Chap. 10.) Thus, if a person is charged with
homicide and successfully pleaded self-defense, his acquittal by
reason thereof will extinguish his civil liability. He has not incurred
any criminal liability. On the other hand, if his acquittal is, for
instance, due to the fact that he was not sufficiently identified
to be the killer, a civil action for damages may be maintained.
Art. 30. When a separate civil action is brought to
demand civil liability arising from a criminal offense,
and no criminal proceedings are instituted during
the pendency of the civil case, a preponderance of
evidence shall likewise be sufficient to prove the
act complained of.
Separate civil action to enforce civil liability
for a criminal offense.

(1) Implied institution of civil action with criminal action. —
When a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged shall be

86

TORTS

Art. 31

deemed instituted with the criminal action unless the offended
party waives the civil action, reserves the right to institute it
separately, or institutes the civil action prior to the criminal
action. (Sec. 1[a], Rule 111, Rules of Court; see Chap. 10.)
(2) Separate civil action. — After the criminal action has been
commenced, the separate civil action arising therefrom cannot be
instituted until final judgment has been entered in the criminal
action. (Sec. 2, pars. 1, 2, Ibid.) If no criminal action is filed, the
civil action for damages may be validly instituted and it may
proceed to final judgment by mere preponderance of evidence.
In the separate civil action, a mere preponderance shall likewise
be sufficient to prove the act complained of as a felony.
(3) Independent civil action. — Article 30, like Article 29, does
not speak of an independent civil action. In the cases provided
in Articles 32, 33, 34 and 2176, the independent civil action may
be brought by the offended party. It shall proceed independently
of the criminal action and shall require only a preponderance
of evidence.
In no case, however, may the offended party recover damages twice for the same act or omission charged in the criminal
action. (Sec. 3, Ibid.) The decision in the civil case is thus independent of the result of the criminal case.
Art. 31. When the civil action is based on an
obligation not arising from the act or omission
complained of as a felony, such civil action may
proceed independently of the criminal proceedings
and regardless of the result of the later.
Civil action for damages not based
on felony.

The commission of a felony gives rise to both criminal and
civil liabilities. However, the civil action for recovery of indemnity may be based not on the felony but on an obligation
arising from other sources, such as law, contract, quasi-contract,
or quasi-delict. (Art. 1157.) In such case, the civil action may
proceed independently of the criminal proceedings and regardless of the result of the latter.

Art. 32

TORTS INVOLVING HUMAN RELATIONS

87

For instance, a criminal case filed against a driver for reckless imprudence (Art. 365, Revised Penal Code.) which resulted
in the death of a bus passenger cannot constitute a bar to an
independent civil action for damages against the bus company
based on culpa contractual, not on the alleged criminal offense.
Similarly, despite the acquittal of a public official for the crime
of malversation of public funds based upon reasonable doubt,
the government may still institute a civil action independently
of the charge of malversation to recover the accountable funds
disbursed without lawful excuse or authority, for the two actions are entirely distinct from each other, since in the first, the
obligation to return the money arises from delict, while in the
second, from law.
Art. 32. Any public officer or employee, or any private individuals, who directly or indirectly obstructs,
defeats, violates or in any manner impedes or impairs
any of the following rights and liberties of another
person shall be liable to the latter for damages:
(1) Freedom of religion;
(2) Freedom of speech;
(3) Freedom to write for the press or to maintain

(4) Freedom from arbitrary or illegal detention;
(5) Freedom of suffrage;

without due process of law;
(7) The right to a just compensation when private
property is taken for public use;
(8) the right to the equal protection of the laws;

(14) The right to be free from involuntary servitude in any form;
(15) The right of the accused to be heard by
himself and counsel, to be informed of the nature
and cause of the accusation against him, to have a
speedy and public trial, to meet the witnesses face
to face, and to have compulsory process to secure
the attendance of witness in his behalf;
(17) Freedom from being compelled to be a witness
against one’s self, or from being forced to confess
guilt, or from being induced by a promise of immunity
or reward to make such confession, except when the
person confessing becomes a State witness;
(18) Freedom from excessive fines, or cruel and
unusual punishment, unless the same is imposed
or inflicted in accordance with a statute which has
not been judicially declared unconstitutional; and
(19) Freedom of access to the courts.
In any of the cases referred to in this article,
whether or not the defendant’s act or omission
constitutes a criminal offense, the aggrieved party
has a right to commence an entirely separate and
distinct civil action for damages, and for other relief.
Such civil action shall proceed independently of any
criminal prosecution (if the latter be instituted) and
may be proved by a preponderance of evidence.
The indemnity shall include moral damages. Exemplary damages may also be adjudicated.

mandable from a judge unless his act or omission

penal statute.
Civil remedies for violation
of civil rights.
The Code Commission explained the reasons for Article 327
as follows:
“The creation of an absolutely separate and independent
civil action for the violation of civil liberties is essential to
the effective maintenance of democracy, for these reasons:

(1) In most cases, the threat to freedom originates from
abuses of power by government officials and peace officers.
Heretofore, the citizen has had to depend upon the prosecuting attorney for the institution of criminal proceedings, in
order that the wrongful act might be punished under the
Penal Code and the civil liability exacted. But not infrequently, because the Fiscal (now Prosecutor) was burdened
with too many cases or because he believed the evidence
was insufficient, or as to a few fiscals, on account of a disinclination to prosecute a fellow public official, especially
when he is of high rank, no criminal action was filed by
the prosecuting attorney.
The aggrieved citizen was thus left without redress. In
this way, many individuals, whose freedom had been tampered with, have been unable to reach the courts, which are
the bulwark of liberty.

(2) Even when the prosecuting attorney filed a criminal
action, the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt
often prevented the appropriate punishment. On the other
hand, an independent civil action, as proposed in the Project of Civil Code, would afford the proper remedy by a
preponderance of evidence.

Law, Vol. 1, 2003 Ed.

The civil action to enforce liability for damages is based on an obligation not arising

90

TORTS

Art. 32

(3) Direct and open violations of the Penal Code trampling upon the freedoms named are not so frequent as those
subtle, clever and indirect ways which do not come within
the pale of the penal law. It is in these cunning devices of
suppressing or curtailing freedom, which are not criminally
punishable, where the greatest danger to democracy lies. The
injured citizen will always have, under the Project of Civil
Code, adequate civil remedies before the courts because of
the independent civil action, even in those instances where
the act or omission complained of does not constitute a
criminal offense.’’ (Report, pp. 30-31.)

The aggrieved party may file an entirely separate and distinct civil action for damages, and for other relief, which shall
proceed independently of any criminal prosecution, even if the
latter be instituted, and shall require only a preponderance of
evidence. (2nd par.)
The indemnity for damages (Part II.) may include actual or
compensatory (Art. 2199.), moral (Art. 2217.) nominal (Art. 2221.),
temperate (Art. 2224.), and exemplary damages. (Art. 2229.)
Defense of good faith not available.
Under Article 32, the person liable may be any public officer
or employee even if he did not act with malice or bad faith.

To allow the defense of good faith would defeat the main
purpose of the provision, which is the effective protection of
individual rights. Public officials in the past have abused their
powers on the pretext of justifiable motives or good faith in the
performance of their duties. Precisely, the object of the article
is to put an end to official abuse by the plea of good faith.
(Memorandum of Dr. Jorge Bocobo, Chairman, July 22, 1950;
Lim vs. Ponce de Leon, 66 SCRA 299 [1975].)
Limited liability of judges.

While a public officer or employee is liable under Article 32
whether or not the act or omission complained of constitutes a
criminal offense, judges are not liable unless the act or omission
in violation of civil liabilities is a crime. (last par.) A person
criminally liable is also civilly liable. (Art. 100, Revised Penal

Art. 33

TORTS INVOLVING HUMAN RELATIONS

91

Code.) Civil liability in a criminal case may exist only if there
is criminal liability.

Under the Revised Penal Code, a judge incurs criminal liability for knowingly rendering an unjust judgment (Art. 204,
thereof.), rendering a manifestly unjust judgment by reason of
inexcusable negligence or ignorance (Sec. 205, Ibid.), knowingly
rendering an unjust interlocutory order or decree or rendering
a manifestly unjust order or decree by reason of inexcusable
negligence or ignorance (Art. 206, Ibid.), and malicious delay
in the administration of justice. (Art. 207, Ibid.)
Article 32 seems to consider judges a special breed of public
officers. However, a judge exempted from responsibility under
Article 32 may be held liable for refusal or neglect to perform
his official duty under Article 27.
Art. 33. In cases of defamation, fraud, and physical
injuries, a civil action for damages, entirely separate
and distinct from the criminal action, may be brought
by the injured party. Such civil action shall proceed
independently of the criminal prosecution, shall require only a preponderance of evidence.
Civil action for damages in case of defamation,
fraud, and physical injuries.
Arts. 31,8 32, 33, 34, and 2176 are instances when the law
grants the right to an injured party to bring civil actions independently of the criminal action. The separate civil action
for damages in case of defamation, fraud, or physical injuries
is similar to the action in tort for libel or slander, deceit, and
assault and battery under American law. (Report of the Code
Commission, p. 46.)
The innovation is justified thus:

“The underlying purpose of the principle under consideration is to allow the citizen to enforce his rights in a
from the felony charged in the criminal case.

Art. 33

private action brought by him, regardless of the action of
the State attorney. It is not conducive to civic spirit and to
individual self-reliance and initiative to habituate the citizens to depend upon the government for the vindication of
their own private rights. It is true that in many of the cases
referred to in the provisions cited, a criminal prosecution is
proper, but it should be remembered that while the State is
the complainant in the criminal case, the injured individual
is the one most concerned because it is he who has suffered
directly. He should be permitted to demand reparation for
the wrong which peculiarly affects him.
In England and the United States, the individual may
bring an action in tort for assault and battery, false imprisonment, libel and slander, deceit, trespass, malicious prosecution, and other acts which also fall within the criminal
statutes. This independent civil action is in keeping with
the spirit of individual initiative and the intense awareness
of one’s individual rights in those countries.
Something of that same sense of self-reliance in the enforcement of one’s rights is sought to be nurtured by the
Project of Civil Code. Freedom and civic courage thrive best
in such an atmosphere, rather than under a paternalistic
system of law.’’ (Ibid., pp. 46-47.)
Defamation, fraud, and physical
injuries construed.

Article 33 uses the words “defamation,’’9 “fraud,’’10 and
“physical injuries.’’

(1) Defamation and fraud are used in their Revised Penal
Code using these terms as names of offenses defined therein,
so that these two terms “defamation’’ and “fraud’’ must have
been used not to impart to them any technical meaning in the
laws of the Philippines, but in their generic sense.

The charge against the accused was not for homicide and physical injuries but for
reckless imprudence or criminal negligence resulting in the death (homicide) of one and

Art. 33

TORTS INVOLVING HUMAN RELATIONS

93

(2) With this apparent circumstance in mind, it is evident
that the term “physical injuries’’ could not have been used in
its specific sense as a crime defined in the Revised Penal Code,
for it is difficult to believe that the Code Commission would
have used terms in the same article — some in their general
and another in its technical sense. In other words, the term
“physical injuries’’ should be understood to mean bodily injury,
not the crime of physical injuries, because the terms used with
the latter are general terms.
In any case, the Code Commission recommended that the
civil action for physical injuries be similar to the civil action
for assault and battery in American Law, and this recommendation must have been accepted by the Legislature when it
approved the article intact as recommended. If the intent has
been to establish a civil action for the bodily harm received
by the complainant similar to the civil action for assault and
battery, as the Code Commission states, the civil action should
lie whether the offense committed is that of physical injuries,
or frustrated homicide, or attempted homicide, or even death
caused by physical injury. (Carandang vs. Santiago, 97 Phil. 94
[1955]; Dyogi vs. Yatco, 100 Phil. 1095 [1957].)
Independent civil action for damages based
on criminal negligence.
(1) It has been held that reckless imprudence or criminal
negligence (Art. 365, Revised Penal Code.) is not one of the three
(3) crimes mentioned in Article 33. There is no independent civil
action for damages that may be instituted in connection with said
offense. The extinction of the criminal action by acquittal of the
defendant on the ground that the criminal charge against him did
not exist, necessarily extinguishes also the civil action based upon
the same act.11 (Corpus vs. Paje, 28 SCRA 1062 [1969].)

The essence of the quasi-offense of criminal negligence
lies in the execution of an imprudent or negligence act that,
if intentionally done, would be punishable as a felony. The
law penalizes thus the negligent or careless act, not the result.
The gravity of the consequence is only taken into account to

94

TORTS

Art. 33

determine the penalty; it does not qualify the substance of the
offense. (People vs. Buan, 22 SCRA 1383 [1968].) With respect
to physical injuries, Article 33 applies only to those inflicted
intentionally or with malice. (see Marcia vs. Court of Appeals,
120 SCRA 193 [1983].)

(2) However, in Madeja vs. Caro (126 SCRA 293 [1983].), the
Supreme Court observed that the ruling in Corpus which states
that reckless imprudence or criminal negligence is not included
in Article 33 is not authoritative. Of the eleven justices, only
nine (9) took part in the decision and four (4) of them merely
concurred in the result. According to the Supreme Court, the
civil action for damages which Article 33 allows to be instituted
is ex-delicto. This is manifest from the provision which uses the
expressions “criminal action’’ and “criminal prosecution.’’ This
conclusion is supported by the Comment of the Code Commission. (supra.)
The High Tribunal ruled that the civil action for damage
against the respondent doctor who was accused of homicide
through reckless imprudence for the death of the patient after
an appendectomy, may proceed independently of the criminal
action against her.
Article 33 refers to special cases.
Article 33 refers to three (3) special cases: defamation, fraud,
and physical injuries which are criminal offenses. It permits an
entirely separate and distinct civil action for damages independently of the criminal prosecution in any of the three (3) cases.

The general rule is that once a criminal action is filed, any
civil action arising from the offense charged in the criminal action shall be suspended in whatever stage it may be found until
final judgment in the criminal proceedings has been rendered.
(see Sec. 2, pars. 1 and 2, Rule 111, Rules of Court; Art. 35, par. 2.)
The present article creates an exception to this rule. In these
cases, the civil action may be filed even if there had been no

physical injuries suffered by two others.
12
Art. 2189. Provinces, cities and municipalities shall be liable for damages for the death
of, or injuries suffered by, any person by reason of the defective condition of roads, streets,
bridges, public buildings, and other public works under their control or supervision. (n)

reservation made by the injured party because the law itself
makes such reservation. (see Bulaclac vs. Hernandez [C.A.], 53
O.G. 1490; Bustillo vs. Leyte Bus Auto Co., Inc. [C.A.], 56 O.G.
292.) Such civil action shall proceed to trial and final judgment
independently of the criminal prosecution and irrespective of
the result of the latter (albeit both arose from the action of the
defendant), and shall require only a preponderance of evidence
and not a proof beyond reasonable doubt that is necessary for
conviction in a criminal case.

If a civil action can proceed independently of the criminal
action, the law, in allowing such procedure, must have been
aware of the possibility that the decision in the civil case —
which merely requires preponderance of evidence to support
it — may be different from that in the criminal case which
rigidly demands proof beyond reasonable doubt for conviction.
Implicit in Article 33 is that the criminal case need not wait for
the civil case or vice versa, and that one should not be made to
depend upon the outcome of the other. Any other construction
will render the word “independently” in the provision superfluous, meaningless, and nugatory. (Dianeta vs. Makasiar, [C.A.]
55 O.G. 10276.)
Art. 34. When a member of a city or municipal
police force refuses or fails to render aid or protection to any person in case of danger to life or
property, such peace officer shall be primarily liable

subsidiarily responsible therefor. The civil action
herein recognized shall be independent of any criminal proceedings, and a preponderance of evidence
shall suffice to support such action.

[1909].) If a member of a city or municipal police force12 refuses
or fails, without just cause, to perform his duty (see Art. 27.),
he is primarily liable, and the city or municipality subsidarily,

in case of insolvency of the guilty peace officer. The local government unit cannot invoke the defense of due diligence in the
selection and supervision of its policemen since this defense is
allowed only to private employers. (see Art. 2180, Chap. 6.) But
this is true only where the function involved is strictly public
or governmental (e.g., preservation of peace and order, collection of taxes, establishment of schools).13 The defense would
be available if the function involved is performed by the city
or municipality in its private or corporate aspect (similar to a
business corporation) like when it operates, for instance, public
utilities (e.g., electric, waterworks) and public markets.
A peace officer guilty of non-performance of duty is already
liable for damages under Article 27 but Article 34 authorizes
the bringing of a separate civil action to enforce that liability
independent of any criminal proceedings. A preponderance of
evidence shall also suffice to such action.
Art. 35. When a person, claiming to be injured by
a criminal offense, charges another with the same,
for which no independent civil action is granted in
this Code or any special law, but the justice of the
peace finds no reasonable grounds to believe that a
crime has been committed, or the prosecuting attorney refuses or fails to institute criminal proceedings,
the complainant may bring a civil action for damages
against the alleged offender. Such civil action may
be supported by a preponderance of evidence. Upon

Sec. 6. The State shall establish and maintain one police force, which shall be national
in scope and civilian in character, to be administered and controlled by a national police
commission. The authority of local executives over the police units in their jurisdiction
shall be provided by law. (Art. XVI, Constitution.)
Section 6 is implemented by R.A. No. 6975 (as amended by R.A. No. 8551.), which
established the Philippine National Police (PNP), a merger of the Integrated National Police
(INP) and the Philippine Constabulary, the former “national police.’’ Article 34 applies
specifically only to a member of a city or municipal police force. There are no more local
police forces. The PNP is under the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG).

Sec. 6. Suspension by reason of prejudicial question. — A petition for suspension of the
criminal action based upon the pendency of a prejudicial question in a civil action may be
filed in the office of the prosecutor or the court conducting the preliminary investigation.
When the criminal action has been filed in court for trial, the petition to suspend shall be
filed in the same criminal action at any time before the prosecution rests. (Rule 111, Rules
of Court.)

the defendant’s motion, the court may require the
plaintiff to file a bond to indemnify the defendant in
case the complaint should be found to be malicious.
If during the pendency of the civil action, an information should be presented by the prosecuting
attorney, the civil action shall be suspended until
the termination of the criminal proceedings.
Right of victim of criminal offense to file
independent civil action.

(1) Instances. — In the cases provided in Articles 32, 33, 34,
and 2176, the law expressly provides a separate civil action
independent of the criminal action. The present article grants
an aggrieved party the right to file an independent civil action
even if no such right is expressly recognized in the Civil Code
or in any special law, in two (2) instances:
(a) The justice of the peace (now city or municipal trial
court) finds no reasonable ground to believe that a crime
has been committed after a preliminary investigation; or
(b) The prosecuting attorney (now prosecutor) refuses
or fails to institute criminal proceedings.

Such civil action may be supported only by a preponderance of evidence. For the protection of the defendant and as
a deterrence against baseless complaint, the plaintiff may be
required to file a bond to indemnify the defendant in case the
complaint should be found malicious.

(2) Suspension of the civil action. — Under the second paragraph, the general rule that the filing of the criminal action
suspends the civil action until the former action is decided,
applies, inasmuch as the civil liability is based on the felony
involved in the criminal case. Of course, where a final judgment has already been rendered in the civil case, there will be
no civil action to suspend.
Again, if the offense is one for which an independent civil
action is created by law, the filing of the criminal action will
not suspend the civil action.

Art. 36

Art. 36. Prejudicial questions, which must be
decided before any criminal prosecution may be instituted or may proceed, shall be governed by rules
of court which the Supreme Court shall promulgate
and which shall not be in conflict with the provisions of this Code.
Concept of prejudicial question.

(1) A prejudicial question is a question involved in a civil action, raised by the accused during a preliminary investigation
or in a criminal case,14 and which is of such a nature that its
resolution in the civil case would be determinative of the guilt
or innocence of the accused. For this reason, the criminal case
must be suspended, pending the final determination of such
question in the civil case.

(2) The Supreme Court defined it as one which must precede
the criminal action, that which requires a decision before a final
judgment is rendered in the principal action with which said
question is closely connected. Not all previous questions are
prejudicial questions but all prejudicial questions are necessarily previous. (Berbari vs. Concepcion, 40 Phil. 320 [1920]; Brito
Sy vs. Malate Taxicab, 102 Phil. 483 [1957].)

(3) The term has also been defined as one which arises in
a case, the resolution of which question is a logical antecedent
of the issue involved in said case and the cognizance of which
pertains to another tribunal. (People vs. Aragon, 94 Phil. 357
[1954].) It is one based on a fact distinct and separate from the
crime but so intimately connected with it that it determines the
guilt or innocence of the accused. (De Leon vs. Mabanag, 70
Phil. 202 [1940], citing Padilla, Civil Code Annotated, 1956 Ed.,
Vol. 1, p. 83; Benitez vs. Concepcion, 2 SCRA 178 [1961].)
A prejudicial question only arises when a criminal proceeding

Art. 36

TORTS INVOLVING HUMAN RELATIONS

99

is involved. (Ocampo vs. Buenaventura, 55 SCRA 267 [1974].) It
constitutes an exception to the general rule that the civil action
is suspended to await the final termination of the criminal case.
No prejudicial question is involved in cases where the law
permits civil action for damages independently of the criminal
prosecution. (supra.) In the same way that the civil suit can be
tried separately, the criminal case has to run its course.
Elements of prejudicial question.
The elements of a prejudicial question are:

(1) The previously instituted civil action involves an issue
similar or intimately related to the issue raised in the subsequent
criminal action; and
(2) The resolution of such issue determines whether or not
the criminal action may proceed. (Sec. 7, Rule 111, Rules of
Court.)
The prejudicial question must be determinative of the (criminal) case before the court and jurisdiction to try said question
must be lodged in another tribunal (hearing the civil case). In
the Philippines, where the courts are vested with both civil and
criminal jurisdictions, the principle of the prejudicial question
is to be applied even if there is only one court before which
the civil action and the criminal action are to be litigated. In
such case, the court exercising jurisdiction over the civil action
is considered distinct and different from itself when trying the
criminal action. (Merced vs. Diaz, 109 Phil. 155 [1960].)
It must appear not only the civil case involves the same facts
upon which the criminal case would be based, but also that the
resolution of the issue or issues raised in the civil action would
necessarily determine the guilt or innocence of the accused. In
an action for bigamy, for example, if the accused claims that
the first marriage is null and void and the right to decide such
validity pertains to another tribunal, the civil action for nullity
must first be decided before the action for bigamy can proceed;
hence, the validity of the first marriage is a prejudicial question.
(People vs. Aragon, 94 Phil. 357 [1954]; Mendiola vs. Macadaeg,
1 SCRA 598 [1961].)

100

Art. 36

Instances of prejudicial questions.
(1) H, a married man, contracted marriage against his will
with F who employed force and intimidation. He filed an action
for annulment of the second marriage. Subsequently, F countered
with a criminal charge of bigamy. If the second marriage is annulled because of lack of consent, H cannot be guilty of bigamy.
The annulment case raises a prejudicial question. (Merced vs.
Diez, 109 Phil. 155 [1960]; Zapanta vs. Montesa, 4 SCRA 510
[1962]; Donato vs. Luna, 160 SCRA 441 [1988]; Landicho vs.
Relova, 22 SCRA 73 [1968].)
(2) In the same example, the bigamy charge was filed by W,
the wife of H, out of jeolousy. The suit for annulment must first
be decided before the criminal action for bigamy can proceed.
(De Leon vs. Mabanag, 70 Phil. 202 [1940].)

(3) In the first example, it was H who forced F to marry
him. F filed an action to annul the marriage. Meantime, H was
accused of bigamy. F, were she the one charged with bigamy,
could raise said force or intimidation as a defense. But not H
who used the force or intimidation. He may not use his own
malfeasance to defeat the action based on his criminal act.
The civil action for annulment does not decide that H did not
enter the marriage against his will and consent, because the
complaint does not determine the existence of any charge of
bigamy. A decision thereon is not essential to the determination
of the criminal charge. It is, therefore, not a prejudicial question.
(People vs. Aragon, 94 Phil. 357 [1954].)
(4) The civil action involving the obligation to pay wages
is a prejudicial question to a criminal prosecution for delay in
the payment of said wages, unless the obligation is first proved.
(Aleria vs. Mendoza, 83 Phil. 427 [1949].)

(5) In a criminal case against one for damage to another’s
property, a civil action that involves the ownership of said
property being claimed by the former should first be resolved.
(De Leon vs. Mabanag, 38 Phil. 202 [1940].)
(6) Pending determination of the falsity of the subject testimonies of private respondents (witnesses) in the civil case against

Art. 36

TORTS INVOLVING HUMAN RELATIONS

101

the defendant in said case, the criminal action for false testimony
against them must perforce be suspended for whether or not
the said testimonies in the civil case are false is a prejudicial
question. (Ark Travel Express, Inc. vs. Abrogar, 410 SCRA 148
[2003].)
Instances of non-prejudicial questions.

(1) A civil action to cancel copyright granted to the complainant is not prejudicial to a criminal prosecution for infringement
of copyright because until and unless cancelled, the copyright
is presumed to have been duly or lawfully granted. (Ocampo
vs. Tancinco, 96 Phil. 439 [1955].)
(2) A third party complaint by a taxi passenger against the
truck driver for quasi-delict (culpa aquilina) is not a prejudicial
question to a suit against the taxi operator for breach of the
contract of carriage. (Brito Sy vs. Malate Taxicab, 102 Phil. 483
[1957].)

(3) In both the civil case for annulment of the deed of
mortgage and the criminal case for falsification of the deed
in question, where the issue was the same (the forgery of the
same signature) and/or arose from the same facts, it is not necessary that the civil case be determined first before taking up
the criminal case. This being the case, the proposition is simply
reduced to a matter of preference. (Benitez vs. Concepcion, Jr.,
2 SCRA 179 [1961].)

(4) Petitioner lodged with the Police Commission (POLCOM)
an administrative complaint against certain policemen for serious misconduct, etc. The latter, in turn, filed a civil action for
damages based on alleged harassment. There is no prejudicial
question here since there is no criminal prosecution involved.
However, the civil case is premature in view of the possibility
that the POLCOM may decide the administrative case against
the respondent policemen in which case the damage suit will
become unfounded and baseless. (Ocampo vs. Buenaventura,
55 SCRA 267 [1974].)
(5) The accused was charged with falsely testifying that
plaintiff in a civil action against him, had executed a deed of sale
which was declared non-existent and void by the court in said

102

Art. 36

civil action. After the prosecution had rested its case, and while
the defense was starting to present evidence, the prosecution
filed a motion to suspend trial on the ground of a prejudicial
question. Even if a prejudicial question was involved, it would
be unfair to deprive the accused of the opportunity to establish
her innocence. The prosecution should not have instituted the
criminal case prematurely if it really believe that a prejudicial
question was involved. (People vs. Villamor, 4 SCRA 482 [1962].)

Chapter 5
NUISANCE
Article 694. A nuisance is any act, omission,
establishment, business, condition of property, or
anything else which:
(1) Injures or endangers the health or safety of
others; or
(2 Annoys or offends the senses; or
(3) Shocks, defies or disregards decency or morality; or
(4) Obstructs or interferes with the free passage
of any public highway or street, or any body of water;
or
(5) Hinders or impairs the use of property.
Concept of nuisance.
It has been said that the term nuisance is incapable of exact
and exhaustive definition which will fit all cases, because the
controlling facts are seldom alike and because of the wide range
of subject matter embraced under the term.

The term is derived from the French word nuire, which
means to injure, hurt or harm. Literally, it means annoyance,
or anything that works hurt, inconvenience, or injury. It is so
comprehensive that it has been applied to almost all wrongs
which have interfered with the rights of the citizen in person,
property, the enjoyment of his property, or his comfort.
The nuisance doctrine operates as a restriction upon the right
of the owner of property to make such use of it as he pleases.
103

104

TORTS

Art. 694

In legal phraseology, the term “nuisance’’ is applied to that class
of wrongs which arises from the unreasonable, unwarrantable,
or unlawful use by a person of his own property, and which
produces such material annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort,
or hurt, that the law will presume a consequent damage. Anything that works an injury, harm or prejudice to an individual
or the public is a nuisance. It embraces both intentional harms
and those caused by negligence or recklessness. (58 Am. Jur.
2d 553-554.)

Although governed by its own set of rules that reflect its
close relationship to the law of property, the law of nuisance is
a subcategory of tort law in that the gravamen of the complaint
in nuisance is the allegation of injury to person or property.
As in other areas of tort, the injury need not be physical, and
can include injury to rights or property enjoyment. (Diamond,
Levine & Madden, Understanding Torts, 1996 Ed., p. 370.)
Statutory definition of nuisance.
Article 596 gives the statutory definition of “nuisance’’ in
terms of that which causes the harm or damage, and not of the
harm or damage caused. Negligence is not an essential ingredient of a nuisance but to be liable for a nuisance, there must be
resulting injury to another in the enjoyment of his legal rights.
Anything which is injurious to public health or safety, is offensive to the senses, is indecent or immoral, obstructs the free
use of any public street or body of water, impairs the use of
property, or, in any way, interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property is a nuisance. (De Leon & De Leon, Jr.
Comments and Cases on Property, 2003 Ed., p. 535.)
Nuisance distinguished from trespass.
There is a distinction between the two, although many things
are called nuisances which are mere trespasses.

(1) A nuisance consists of a use of one’s own property in
such a manner as to cause injury to the property or other right
or interest of another (Norcross v. Thomas, 51 Me. 503, 81 Am.
Dec. 588.), and generally results from the commission of an act

Art. 694

NUISANCE

105

beyond the limits of the property affected, while a trespass is
a direct infringement of another’s right of property. (Herring
v. Wilton, 100 Va 171, 55 SE 546; see 26 RCL 928.)

Thus, where there is no actual physical invasion of the
plaintiff’s property, the cause of action is for nuisance rather
than trespass. And an encroachment upon the space about another’s land but not upon the land itself is a nuisance and not
a trespass. (Conestee Mills v. Greenville, 158 SE 113, 75 ALR
519; Rafka v. Bozio, 218 P 753, 191 Cal. 746.)
(2) In trespass, the injury is direct and immediate; in nuisance, it is consequential. (86 C.J. 651.)
Nuisance distinguished from negligence.
The two are not synonymous terms. They are different in
their nature and consequences.

(1) To render a person liable on the theory of either nuisance
or negligence, there must be some breach of duty on his part,
but liability for negligence is based on a want of care, while
ordinarily, a person who creates or maintains a nuisance is liable for the resulting injury to others regardless of the degree
of care or skill exercised to avoid the injury.
(2) The creation or maintenance of a nuisance is a violation
of an absolute duty, the doing of an act which is wrongful in
itself, whereas negligence is a violation of a relative duty, the
failure to use the degree of care required under particular circumstances in connection with an act or omission which is not
of itself wrongful.
(3) Where the damage is the necessary consequence of what
the defendant is doing, or is incident to the business itself or
the manner in which it is conducted (whether there is proper
care or not), the law of negligence has no application, and the
law of nuisance applies. (58 Am. Jur. 2d 557.)
Application of rules on negligence.
These torts — nuisance and injurious negligent act or omission — may be, and frequently are, co-existing and practically
inseparable, as where acts or omissions constituting negligence
also give rise to a nuisance, and it is difficult at times to distinguish

106

TORTS

Art. 695

between actions of nuisance and those based on negligence.

It has been held that where the acts or omissions constituting negligence are the identical acts which, it is asserted, give
rise to a cause of action for nuisance, the rules applicable to
negligence will be applied. (58 Am. Jur. 2d 557-558.)
(1) For instance, the building of a structure may be negligence and at the same a nuisance rendering the one creating it
liable without proof of negligence. Where however, the liability
of the lessor of a land or building in a condition dangerous to
the health or safety of the public depends upon whether he
knew, or, with the exercise of due care, ought to have known,
of its dangerous condition, an action by one injured as a result
thereof may take the form of one for nuisance or one for negligence. (58 Am. Jur 2d. 557-558.)

(2) There may be situations where what was lawful in its origin
may be turned into a nuisance by negligence in maintenance. The
coal hole, built under a license, may involve a liability for nuisance
if there is negligence in covering it. The tumbledown house abutting on a highway is transformed into an unlawful structure if its
ruinous condition is a menace to the traveler.
In these and like situations, the danger being a continuing one,
is often characterized as a nuisance, though dependent upon negligence. (Harper & James, The Law of Torts, Vol. 1, 1956 Ed., p. 66.)
Art. 695. Nuisance is either public or private. A
public nuisance affects a community or neighborhood
or any considerable number of persons, although the
extent of the annoyance, danger or damage upon
individuals may be unequal. A private nuisance is
one that is not included in the foregoing definition.
Classifications of nuisance.
They are:

(1) According to number of persons affected:
(a) Public;

(b) Private (Art. 695.); and
(c) Mixed.

Art. 695

NUISANCE

107

(2) According to their nature:

(a) Nuisance per se; and

(b) Nuisance per accidens.

(3) According to liability:
(a) Civil; and
(b) Criminal

(4) According to duration:

(a) continuing or recurrent; and
(b) temporary or permanent.

(5) According to right to relief:
(a) actionable; and
(b) non-actionable.

(6) According to remedy available:

(a) nuisance abatable by criminal action;
(b) nuisance abatable by civil action;

(c) nuisance abatable without judicial proceedings (Arts.
699, 704, 705, 706.); and
(d) nuisance abatable with judicial proceedings. (Arts.
699, 701, 703.)
Public and private nuisances defined.
The Civil Code in Article 695 classifies nuisances according
to the extent or scope of their injurious effects into public and
private and then defines them. Other definitions:

(1) A public nuisance has been defined as the doing of or the
failure to do something that injuriously affects safety, health,
or morals of the public, or works some substantial annoyance,
inconvenience, or injury to the public. It is a nuisance which
causes hurt, inconvenience, or damage to the public generally,
or such a part of the public as necessarily comes in contact with
it in the exercise of a public or common right. It is a condition
of things which is prejudicial to the health, comfort, safety,
property, sense of decency, or morals of the citizens at large,
resulting either from an act not warranted by law, or neglect

108

TORTS

Art. 695

of a duty imposed by law. (58 Am. Jur. 2d 561.)

(2) A private nuisance has been defined as one which violates
only private rights and produces damage to but one or a few
persons, and cannot be said to be public. It has been said to
exist where one is injured in relation to a right which he enjoys
by reason of his ownership of an interest in land, and where
an individual wrong arising from an unreasonable, unwarrantable, or unlawful use of one’s property produces such material
annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort, or hurt that the law will
presume a consequent damage. (Ibid. 564.)
Public and private nuisances distinguished.
(1) The difference between a public and private nuisance is
that the former affects the public at large or such of them as may
come in contact with it, while the latter affects the individual
or a limited number of individuals only.

(2) Another difference is in the remedies available. Public
nuisances are indictable, whereas private nuisance are actionable, either for their abatement or for damages, or both. (Ibid.,
559.) Injunctive relief may be granted against a private nuisance.
(infra.)
The complainant in private nuisance seeks to protect his
own, current interest in the undisturbed enjoyment of or benefit
from property. The plaintiff need not own the property — he
need only be a lawful occupant, or the holder of one or more
other use rights. In contrast, for a suit in public nuisance, the
complainant need not have property or use interest in any property affected by the defendant’s conduct. (Diamond, Levine, &
Madden, op. cit., p. 370.)
Test of a public nuisance.
The distinction between a public nuisance and a private
nuisance does not lie in the nature or character of the nuisance
itself, but in the extent or scope of its injurious effect.
The test, however, of a public nuisance is not the number of
persons actually affected, but the possibility of injury or annoyance not to the public, but to all who come within its sphere.
To constitute a public nuisance, it is sufficient that there is a

Art. 695

NUISANCE

109

tendency to the annoyance of the public, by an invasion of its
rights which all are entitled to exercise if they see fit. And the
fact that acts or conditions may be beneficial to the public in
some degree will not prevent them from being a nuisance, if
their effects are such as to fall within the definition of a nuisance. (58 Am. Jur. 2d 564.)

There can be no doubt, for example, that a private basketball
court built on government land devoted to public use, constitutes
a public nuisance as well as nuisance per se and, therefore, can
be summarily abated. The fact that it is also used as a venue
for public meetings does not make it less a nuisance.
Public nuisance always arise out of unlawful acts, and an
act cannot be a nuisance if it is lawful, or is authorized by a
valid statute or ordinance, or is imperatively demanded by
public convenience. (Ibid.)
Mixed nuisances.
A thing may be a private nuisance without being a public one or a public nuisance without being a private one. On
the other hand, a nuisance may be both public and private in
character; it may be a public nuisance because it violates public
rights to the injury of many persons, and it may also be private
in character in that it produces special injury to private rights
(see Art. 703.) to any extent beyond the injury to the public.
Nuisance of this kind are generally called mixed nuisances.
Thus:

(1) A house abutting on a street railway track is a private
nuisance to the railway company and a public nuisance because
it obstructs the street.

(2) Raising and breeding animals (pigs, goats and sheep)
for commercial purposes in a vicinity that is fast becoming a
fashionable residential district and where it is shown that the
place where the animals are kept are found to be unsanitary
on account of the offensive odors, pernicious to health, coming
from manure scattered therein, stagnant water, etc. constitutes
both public and private nuisance. (58 Am. Jur. 2d 559-561.)
(3) The keeping or storage of gasoline may constitute a

110

TORTS

Art. 695

nuisance, either private or public. Whether or not it becomes
a nuisance depends upon the location, the quantity, and other
surrounding circumstances. While it would not necessarily
depend upon the degree of care used in the storage, the manner in which the tanks are constructed and operated may be
considered. (Javier v. Ozaeta, 64 Phil. 626 [1937].)
Nuisance per se and nuisance per accidens
defined.
Based on their nature, nuisance is either per se (or in law)
or nuisance per accidens (or in fact).
(1) Nuisance per se is an act, occupation, or structure which
is unquestionably a nuisance at all times and under any circumstances, regardless of location or surroundings. It is anything
which of itself is a nuisance because of its inherent qualities,
productive of injury or dangerous to life or property without
regard to circumstance. (see 58 Am. Jur. 2d 568-569.)
Thus:

(a) A house of prostitution is a nuisance per se aside
from being a public nuisance. The same is true of gambling
houses.

(b) The same is also true of houses constructed without
governmental authority on public streets and river beds for
they obstruct at all times the free use by the public of said
places. As such, they may be summarily removed without
judicial proceedings. (Sitchon vs. Aquino, 98 Phil. 458 [1955].)

(c) Any and all squatters on government resettlement
projects are likewise nuisances per se and public nuisances
and they can be abated or ejected without judicial proceedings. (Mendoza vs. National Housing Authority, 111 SCRA
637 [1982]; see Arts. 699[3], 705[2].)

(2) Nuisance per accidens is an act, occupation, or structure,
not a nuisance per se, but which may become a nuisance by
reason of circumstances, location, or surroundings. Thus, raising
and breeding pigs in a house within city limits is a nuisance
per accidens.

Art. 695

NUISANCE

111

Nuisance per se and nuisance per accidens
distinguished.
The difference between nuisance per se and nuisance per
accidens lies in the proof, not in the remedy. The responsibility
for a nuisance for either sort is the same.

(1) Existence. — In the case of a nuisance per se, the thing
becomes a nuisance as a matter of law. Its existence need only
be proved in any locality, without a showing of specific damages, and the right to relief is established by averment and proof
of the mere act. But whether a thing not a nuisance per se is a
nuisance per accidens or in fact, depends upon its location and
surroundings, the manner of its conduct or other circumstances,
and in such cases, proof of the act and its consequences is
necessary. The act or thing complained of must be shown by
evidence to be a nuisance under the law, and whether it is a
nuisance or not is generally a question of fact. (see 58 Am. Jur.
2d 569.)

(2) Abatement. — As nuisance per se affects the immediate
safety of persons and property, they may be summarily abated
under the undefined law of necessity. But if the nuisance be
per accidens, even the municipal authorities, under their power
to declare and abate nuisances, would not have the right to
compel the abatement of a particular thing or act as a nuisance
without reasonable notice to the person alleged to be maintaining or doing the same at the time and place of hearing before a
tribunal authorized to decide whether such a thing or act does
in law constitute a nuisance. (Monteverde vs. Generoso, 52 Phil.
23 [1928].)
Noise as a nuisance.
Generally, everyone is bound to bear the habitual or customary inconveniences that result from the proximity of others,
and so long as this level is not surpassed, he may not complain
against them. But if the prejudice exceeds the inconveniences
that such proximity habitually brings, the neighbor who causes
such disturbance is held responsible for the resulting damage,
being guilty of causing nuisance.
(1) When actionable. — A noise may constitute an action-

112

TORTS

Art. 695

able nuisance, but it must be a noise which affects injuriously
the health or comfort of ordinary people in the vicinity to an
unreasonable extent. Injury to a particular person in a peculiar
position or of specially sensitive characteristics will not render
the noise an actionable nuisance.

In the conditions of present living, noise seems inseparable
from the conduct of many necessary occupations. Its presence
is a nuisance in the popular sense in which that word is used,
but in the absence of statute, noise becomes actionable only
when it passes the limits of reasonable adjustment to the conditions of the locality and of the needs of the maker to the needs
of the listener. What those limits are cannot be fixed by any
definite measure of quantity or quality. They depend upon the
circumstances of the particular case. They may be affected, but
are not controlled, by zoning ordinances. The delimitation of
designated areas to use for manufacturing, industry or general
business is not a license to emit every noise profitably attending
the conduct of any one of them.
(2) Test. — The test is whether rights of property, health,
or comfort are so injuriously affected by the noise in question
that the sufferer is subjected to a loss which goes beyond the
reasonable limit imposed upon him by the condition of living,
or of holding property, in a particular locality in fact devoted
to uses which involve the emission of noise although ordinary
care is taken to confine it within reasonably bounds; or in the
vicinity of property of another owner who though creating a
noise is acting with reasonable regard for the rights of those
affected. (Velasco vs. Manila Electric Company, 40 SCRA 342
[1971].)

(3) Noise from electrical machinery and appliances. — With particular reference to noise emanating from electrical machinery
and appliances, the Supreme Court in Velasco cited Kentucky &
West Virginia Power Co. v. Anderson (156 S.W. 2d 857), which
ruled as follows:
“There can be no doubt but that commercial and industrial activities which are lawful in themselves may become
nuisances if they are so offensive to the senses that they
render the enjoyment of life and property uncomfortable.
It is no defense that skill and care have been exercised and

Art. 695

NUISANCE

113

the most improved methods and appliances employed to
prevent such result. Of course, the creation of trifling annoyance and inconvenience does not constitute an actionable nuisance, and the locality and surroundings are of
importance. The fact that the cause of the complaint must
be substantial has often led to expressions in the opinions
that to be a nuisance the noise must be deafening or loud
or excessive and unreasonable.

The determinating factor when noise alone is the cause of
complaint is not its intensity or volume. It is that the noise
is of such character as to produce actual physical discomfort
and annoyance to a person of ordinary sensibilities, rendering adjacent property less comfortable and valuable. If the
noise does that, it can well be said to be substantial and
unreasonable in degree; and reasonableness is a question of
fact dependent upon all the circumstances and conditions.
There can be no fixed standard as to what kind of
noise constitutes a nuisance. It is true some witnesses in
this case say they have been annoyed by the humming of
these transformers, but that fact is not conclusive as to the
non-existence of the cause of complaint, the test being the
effect which is had upon an ordinary person who is neither
sensitive nor immune to the annoyance concerning which
the complaint is made. In the absence of evidence that the
complainant and his family are supersensitive to distracting
noises, it is to be assumed that they are persons of ordinary
and normal sensibilities.’’

According to the Court, “the fact that Meralco had received
no complaint although it had been operating hereabouts for the
past 50 years with sub-stations similar to the one in controversy
is not a valid argument. The absence of suit neither lessens the
company’s liability under the law nor weakens the right of others against it to demand their just due.’’
Persons liable for damages resulting
from nuisance.

As a general rule, one who creates a nuisance is liable for
the resulting damages, and ordinarily his liability continues as
long as the nuisance continues.

114

TORTS

Art. 695

(1) Generally, all who participate in the creation or maintenance of a nuisance are liable for injuries suffered therefrom
by others.

(2) One who adopts and continues previously existing nuisance also becomes liable for its continued maintenance, and if
one person creates a nuisance and another adopts it, continues
it, and keeps it up, both are liable.
(3) But the mere failure to abate a nuisance created by
another does not alone constitute a continuation thereof; there
must be some positive participation in the continuance of the
nuisance or some positive act evidencing its adoption. Thus, a
defendant’s duty with respect to a dangerous condition which
he did not intentionally initiate is not absolute, but is to exercise
only such degree of care and diligence as the danger demands.
(4) There must be a breach of some duty on the part of a
person sought to be held liable for damages resulting from a
nuisance before an action will lie against him. Thus, one whose
duty it is to abate a nuisance should answer for the consequences
resulting from its continuance.

(5) Although there are exceptions to the rule, generally no
one is to be held liable for a nuisance which he cannot himself
physically abate without legal action against another for that
purpose, unless it is his own wrong that has involved him in
trouble.
(6) One who creates a structure which is of itself innocuous
is not liable for a nuisance arising from a subsequent optional
use of it by other persons unless he is in some way connected
with such use. (58 Am. Jur. 2d 615-616.)

(7) Where several persons, acting independently, cause damage by acts which constitute a nuisance, each is liable for the
damage which he has caused or for his proportionate share of
the entire damage, and, although it may be difficult to allocate
the actual loss caused by the several wrongdoers, the court is at
liberty to estimate the amount for which each is liable as best it
can. If the inaccuracies of the result are against the defendant,
he is hardly in a position to complain as “the difficulty would
have been avoided had defendant but taken care that no occasion should arise requiring such proportioning and assessing

Art. 695

NUISANCE

115

of the whole damages.’’ (Harper & James, op. cit., p. 89.)
Doctrine of attractive nuisance.

(1) General rule. — The general rule is that when people
come to the lands or premises of others for their own purposes, without right or invitation, they must take the lands or
premises as they see them. If they are exposed to injury from
unseen dangers, the responsibility therefor is upon themselves.
(38 Am. Jur. 2d 804.)
(2) Doctrine, a qualification to the rule. — An exception to the
rule absolving from liability owners or occupants of premises,
in reference to injuries sustained by persons trespassing upon
their property, is the so-called “attractive nuisance’’ doctrine.

According to the doctrine, one who maintains on his premises
dangerous instrumentalities or appliances of a character likely to
attract children in play, and who fails to exercise ordinary care
to prevent children from playing therewith or resorting thereto,
is liable to a child of tender years who is injured thereby, even
if the child is technically a trespasser in the premises. (Hidalgo
Enterprises, Inc. v. Balandan, 91 Phil. 488 [1952].)
The doctrine was first applied in Taylor vs. Manila Electric
Railroad and Light Co. (16 Phil. 8 [1910].)

In that case, defendant employees threw several fulminating
caps or detonators at the spot in its premises where they were
found, with the expectation that they will be buried out of sight
by the ashes which it was dumping in that neighborhood and left
them exposed at a point on its premises which the general public
including children at play, were not prohibited from visiting.

Plaintiff D. Taylor, 15 years old, and another boy, M Claparols,
12 years old, found 20 to 30 caps scattered on the ground which
they picked up. The boys then made a series of experiments
with the caps. Then they opened one of the caps with a knife,
and finding that it was filled with a yellowish substance, they
got matches, and lighted the contents. An explosion followed
causing more or less injuries to all. Plaintiff was more matured
than the average boy of his age and have considerable aptitude
and training in mechanics. He sued for damages for his injuries.

116

TORTS

Art. 695

The Supreme Court, quoting Chief Justice Colley, said:
“Children, wherever they go, must be expected to act
upon childlike instincts and impulses; and others who are
chargeable with a duty of care and caution toward them
must calculate upon this and take precautions accordingly.
If they leave exposed to the observation of children anything which would be tempting to them, and which they
in their immature judgment might naturally suppose they
were at liberty to handle or play with, they should expect
that liberty to be taken. x x x x x x

In the case of young children, and other persons not
fully sui juris an implied license might sometimes arise when
it would not on behalf of others. Thus, leaving a tempting
thing for children to play with exposed, where they would
be likely to gather for that purpose, may be equivalent to
an invitation to them to make use of it; and, perhaps if one
were to throw away upon his premises near the common
way, things tempting to children, the same implications
should arise.’’

However, the Court ruled that defendant was not civilly
liable because the proximate cause of the loss was not attributable to defendant’s negligence and plaintiff had the capacity to
realize the danger to which he exposed himself.
“But while we hold that the entry of the plaintiff upon
defendant’s property without defendant’s express invitation
or permission would not have relieved defendant from responsibility for injuries incurred thereby by plaintiff, without
other fault on his part, if such injury were attributable to the
negligence of the defendant, we are of the opinion that under
all of the circumstances of this case, the negligence of the
defendant in leaving the caps exposed on its premises was
not the proximate cause of the injury received by the plaintiff,
which, therefore, was not, properly speaking, ‘attributable to
the negligence of the defendant,’ and, on the other hand, we
are satisfied that plaintiff’s action cutting open the detonating cup and putting a match to its content was the proximate
cause of the explosion and of the resulting injuries inflicted
upon the plaintiff, and that the defendant, therefore, is not

Art. 695

NUISANCE

117

civilly responsible for the injuries thus incurred.
xxx

xxx

“The law fixes no arbitrary age at which a minor can be
said to have the necessary capacity to understand and appreciate the nature and consequences of his own acts, so as
to make it negligence on his part to fail to exercise due care
and precaution in the commission of such acts; and indeed
it would be impracticable and perhaps impossible so to do,
for in the very nature of things the question of negligence
necessarily depends on the ability of the minor to understand
the character of his own acts and their consequences and
the age at which a minor can be said to have such ability
will necessarily vary in accordance with the varying nature
of the infinite variety of acts which may be done by him.
We are satisfied that the plaintiff had sufficient capacity
and understanding to be sensible of the danger to which he
exposed himself when he put the match to the contents of
the cap; that he was sui juris in the sense that his age and
his experience qualified him to understand and appreciate the necessity for the exercise of that degree of caution
which would have avoided the injury which resulted from
his own deliberate act; and that the injury incurred by him
must be held to have been the direct and immediate result
of his own willful and reckless act, so that while it may be
true that these injuries would not have been incurred but
for the negligent act of the defendant in leaving the caps
exposed on its premises, nevertheless plaintiff’s own act was
the proximate and principal cause of [his injuries].’’

(3) Basis of liability. — A sound basis for the attractive nuisance doctrine is found in the general rules which determine the
duty of an owner or occupant to trespassers and the degree of
care which must be exercised toward children of tender years.
(a) Presence of children to be anticipated. — The fact that a
child may be a trespasser does not necessarily exonerate the
owner of premises accessible to and likely to be frequented
by children from the duty to take reasonable precautions for
their safety. It is a general rule that an owner or occupant
must exercise ordinary care to prevent an injury to a tres-

118

TORTS

Art. 695

passer whose presence upon the premises is reasonably to
be anticipated.

It is in accord with sound experience as well as humanitarian principles, to say that one who maintains upon his
premises an instrumentality or conditions attractive to children is bound to anticipate the presence of children who will
be allured to and upon the premises by the attraction, and to
exercise ordinary care for the safety of such children. Under
this theory, the use of the expression “attractive nuisance’’
indicates no departure or exception from the ordinary run
of negligence cases. The expression is merely a convenient
one used to designate a class of cases within the general
rule that one is liable for injury resulting to another from
failure to exercise the degree of care commensurate with
the circumstances.
(b) Extra precautions to be taken for their safety. — The
child who trespasses in response to an attraction upon the
premises is in no better position than an adult trespasser
whose presence was anticipated by the owner, except that
the tender age of the child requires the owner to take precautions for safety that he would not be bound to take for
the protection of an adult.

(c) Children acting upon their instincts and impulses to be
expected. — While a proprietor may owe no duty to adults
with respect to guarding instrumentalities maintained by him,
he may be liable under the doctrine of attractive nuisances
for injuries to a child of tender years for injuries sustained
from the same instrumentalities. Children, wherever they
go, must be expected to act upon children’s instincts and
impulses, and others, who are chargeable with a duty of
care and caution toward them, must calculate accordingly. If
they leave exposed to the observation of children anything
tempting to them which they, in their immature judgment,
might naturally suppose they were at liberty to handle or
play with, it should be expected that such liberty will be
taken.

The doctrine of attractive nuisance is the dictate of a policy
that is generally recognized. Conservation of child life and safety

Art. 695

NUISANCE

119

as to artificial perils is one of such importance that ordinary care
may well hold everyone responsible for creating or maintaining
a condition involving any such peril, with reasonable ground
for apprehending that children of tender years may probably
be allured thereinto. (38 Am. Jur. 2d 807-809.)

(4) Application to bodies of water. — The attractive nuisance
doctrine generally is not applicable to bodies of water, artificial
as well as natural, in the absence of some unusual condition
or artificial feature other than the mere water and its location.
Thus, a swimming pool or pond or reservoir of water is not
considered an attractive nuisance.
As lucidly explained:

“Nature has created streams, lakes and pools which
attract children. Lurking in their waters is always the danger of drowning. Against this danger, children are earlier
instructed so that they are sufficiently presumed to know
the danger; and if the owner of private property creates
an artificial pool on his own property, merely duplicating
the work of nature without adding any new danger, x x
x (he) is not liable because of having created an attractive
nuisance.’’ (Hidalgo Enterprises, Inc. v. Balandan, supra, citing Anderson v. Reith-Riley Const. Co., 44 NE 2d. 184, 185;
112 Ind. App., 170.)

In Hidalgo (supra.), petitioner was the owner of an iceplant
factory where two tanks full of water, nine feet deep, were
installed for cooling purposes of its engines. While the factory
compound was surrounded with fence, the tanks themselves
were not provided with any kind of fences or top covers.
Persons and vehicles could easily enter the factory through its
wide gate. No guard was assigned to the gate. The edges of
the tanks were barely a foot above the ground.
About noon of April 16, 1948, plaintiff’s son, a boy barely
8 years old, while playing with and in company of other boys,
entered the plant’s premises through the gate, to take a bath in
one of said tanks, and was drowned.

The Supreme Court held that “one who maintains on his
premises dangerous instrumentalities or appliances of a char-

120

TORTS

Art. 695

acter likely to attract children in play, and who fails to exercise
ordinary care to prevent children from playing therewith or
resorting thereto, is liable to a child of tender years who is
injured thereby, even if the child is technically a trespasser in
the premises.’’
Petitioner’s tanks were, however, not classified as attractive
nuisance, and, therefore, the question whether the petitioner had
taken reasonable precaution became immaterial.
(5) Degree of care required. — No one is an insurer of the
safety of children merely because he is the owner of places or
appliances that may appeal to their youthful fences.

(a) Ordinary or reasonable care. — A landowner has a right
to maintain a dangerous instrumentality on his premises that
are attractive to children, provided he exercises ordinary care
to prevent them from being injured while playing therewith.
No more than ordinary care or reasonable care under the
circumstances is required.

All that is required of the owner or occupant is to take
such measures or precautions, by way of giving warning
of danger, erecting guards, providing fences or barricades,
installing safety devices, or furnishing other means, as are
reasonably sufficient to prevent trespassing by children or
protect them if they are attracted by the instrumentality in
question. It is the failure to take such precautions which authorizes a recovery under the doctrine of attractive nuisance.
(b) Remote or improbable injuries. — An owner of land is
not required to provide against remote or improbable injuries
to children who came upon the premises, but only against
such injuries as can be reasonably anticipated to occur from
the object or instrumentality involved. While the care to be
taken by the owner or occupant must be commensurate with
the danger to, and with the immaturity and inexperience
of, the child to be protected, any requirement in this respect
must not be so onerous as to make ownership or possession of property burdensome instead of being profitable or
enjoyable.
(c) Without serious inconvenience and great expense to owner.

Art. 695

NUISANCE

121

— The use of property to which the owner is entitled should
not be encumbered with the necessity of taking precautions
against every conceivable danger to which an irrepressible
spirit of adventure may lead a child. There is no duty to
take precautions where to do so would be impracticable,
unreasonable, or intolerable. The duty to safeguard the
dangerous attraction is subject to the qualification that it can
be done without serious inconvenience and great expense
to the owner.
For example, one of the reasons given for the general
rule that a fire escape is not an attractive nuisance is that it
is impracticable to construct fire escapes so that they will
serve usefully for the purpose for which they are intended
and yet be inaccessible to adventurous children. (38 Am. Jur.
2d 812-814.)

(6) Anticipation of injured child’s presence. — The defendant is
not liable unless he knew, or reasonably ought to have known,
that the structure or instrumentality was alluring to children
and endangered them.

(a) Ground for anticipating child’s presence. — One of the
essential conditions of liability under the doctrine of attractive nuisance is that there must have been ground for
anticipating the presence of the injured child, since, unless
the presence of the injured child is reasonably to be anticipated, the duty of taking precautions for his safety does not
arise. The owners of land are not required in using it for
legitimate purposes to guard against every possible dangers
to children. To children whose presence upon the premises
cannot be reasonably anticipated, they owe no duty to keep
their land free from dangerous conditions.
The owner’s knowledge of the child’s peril may appear
from the nature and kind of attraction or from the location
and accessibility of the attraction.

(b) Reason for child’s presence. — The reason for an injured
child’s presence upon the premises is important in determining whether the proprietor should have anticipated his
presence.

122

TORTS

Art. 695

There is no ground for saying that an owner or occupant
should have anticipated the presence of a child injured in
the premises, merely because of the existence thereon of
some instrumentality. It may be shown that the child was
upon the premises for another reason, as where the child
was brought upon the premises by his parent when the
latter entered on a personal errand; or where the child was
present by invitation of one not authorized by the owner
or occupant to act in this respect; or where he was merely
using the premises for a shortcut, or as a vantage point for
viewing an independent attraction upon other premises.

(c) Child’s presence due to the attraction. — It is not sufficient for the purpose of the doctrine to show that children
generally are attracted to the dangerous instrumentality. It
must be shown that the presence of the child was due to
the attraction. If the maintenance of premises with an attractive condition thereon is deemed to impose liability on the
owner or occupant to guard it so as to prevent injuries to
attracted children on the theory that the attraction amounts
to an implied invitation to enter, then the duty exists only
as to children induced to come upon the premises by the
attraction.
Clearly, where a child is in a place where he has a right
to be, there is no reason for anticipating its presence. (Ibid.
809-812.)

(7) Dangers to which doctrine applicable/not applicable. — One
important condition of the application of the doctrine of attractive nuisance is that the danger to the child be caused by
the attraction itself, or by something with which the attraction
brings the child in contact.

(a) The doctrine applies for the protection of even a
meddling child, but it does not protect a child, as against
the owner of the premises, in respect of a danger which was
not incident to the place, but was created by the child himself
with instrumentalities procured by him off the premises, or
by a third person.
(b) The character of the danger, as open and obvious, or

Art. 696

NUISANCE

123

hidden and latent, is an important consideration. The doctrine is limited in its application to cases where the danger is
latent, and affords no basis for a recovery where the injury
complained of was produced by a peril of an obvious or patent character.

(c) A danger which is not only obvious but natural, considering the instrumentality from which it arises, is not
within the meaning of the attractive nuisance doctrine, for
the reason that an owner or occupant is entitled to assume
that the parents or guardian of a child will have warned him
to avoid such a peril. Pits and excavations on land embody
no dangers that are not readily apparent to everyone, even
to very young children. For this reason, the proprietor is
under no obligation, as a rule, to fence or otherwise guard
such places, and he will not be liable for injuries to children
who may have fallen therein.
(d) Nor is the landowner liable for injuries sustained
by earth falling into excavations as a result of the embankment being undermined by children. Dangers of an ordinary
character as those from fire and steam, may, however, be
so concealed as to authorize a recovery.
(e) The age of the injured child is, of course, a material consideration in determining whether the peril was one which
he should have recognized. Again, a child’s knowledge of
the danger may be inferred from the fact that he has been
warned thereof. (Ibid. 817-819.)
Art. 696. Every successive owner or possessor
of property who fails or refuses to abate a nuisance
in that property started by a former owner or possessor is liable therefor in the same manner as the
one who created it.
Liability of successor of property
constituting a nuisance.

Generally, only the creator of a nuisance is liable for the
damage resulting therefrom. However, since the injurious effect
of a nuisance is a continuing one, every successive owner or

124

TORTS

Art. 697

possessor of property constituting a nuisance who fails or refuses
to abate the nuisance, or maintains or permits its continuation
has the same liability as the one who created it.
To render the new owner or possessor liable, it is, of course,
necessary that he has actual knowledge of the existence of the
nuisance and that it is within his power to abate the same.

The rule that one who consents to, permits or acquiesces
in the erection of a structure with knowledge of the purpose
for which it is to be put and the consequences of its erection
and use will not be heard to say that the building or its uses
are productive of a nuisance, is not applicable where he neither
consented to, permitted nor acquiesced in the erection of the
structure (water pumping plant); nor could it fairly be said that
he had knowledge in advance of all the consequences of the
erection and the manner of operation of the same. (Bengzon vs.
Province of Pangasinan, 62 Phil. 816 [1936].)
Art. 697. The abatement of a nuisance does not
preclude the right of any person injured to recover
damages for its past existence.
Abatement of nuisance and recovery
of damages.

The action to abate and the action to recover damages are
distinct remedies either or both of which the plaintiff may
pursue at his election.
The abatement of a nuisance may have taken place after
injury or damage has already been caused. The injured person
may still recover damages resulting from or growing out of the
nuisance which has been abated. The rule is just and serves to
discourage and punish anyone who causes a nuisance.
The owner of property abated as a nuisance is not entitled
to compensation unless he can show that the abatement is unjustified. (see Art. 436.)
Art. 698. Lapse of time cannot legalize any nuisance, whether public or private.

Arts. 698-699

NUISANCE

125

Effect of lapse of time.
(1) General rule. — The right to bring an action to abate a
public or private nuisance is not extinguished by prescription.
(Art. 1143, par. 2.) Lapse of time cannot be relied upon to legalize a nuisance, whether public or private, for no right can
arise from acts or omissions which are against the law or which
infringe upon the rights of others. (Art. 2254.)

(2) Exception. — Article 698 is subject to exception under
the special rule in Article 631(2) which expressly prescribes
that easements are extinguished by obstruction and non-use
for ten years. Thus, in a case, where plaintiff had an easement
of natural drainage (see Art. 637.) over defendant’s land, it
appeared that the dams in question were constructed in 1937
but the action for their destruction was filed only in 1951. It
was held that the plaintiff’s action was barred by prescription
even though the obstruction may be regarded as in the nature
of a nuisance. If the dams were a nuisance at all, it was due
to their interference with plaintiff’s right of drainage (see Art.
694[5].) but since that right was extinguished by prescription, it
ceased to be a nuisance anymore. (Ongsiaco vs. Ongsiaco, 101
Phil. 1196 [1957].)
Art. 699. The remedies against a public nuisance
are:
(1) A prosecution under the Penal Code or any
local ordinance; or
(2) A civil action; or
(3) Abatement, without judicial proceedings.
Remedies against a public nuisance.

The above remedies are not exclusive but cumulative. All
of them may be availed of by public officers, and the last two,
by private persons, if the nuisance is especially injurious to the
latter. (Art. 703.)
Criminal prosecution is instituted only for “public nuisance’’
and not for a private nuisance. The action is brought in the

126

TORTS

Art. 699

name of the “People of the Philippines’’ since public nuisances
are considered as offenses against the State. Although there is
authority to the effect that a criminal intent is a prerequisite to
a prosecution for a criminal nuisance, other authority holds the
contrary, and in prosecutions for violation of a statute designed
to prevent the recurrence of a public nuisance, the question of
intent is immaterial. (58 Am. Jur. 2d 782.)
Abatement without judicial proceedings.
The summary abatement of nuisance without judicial proceedings is recognized and established even in the absence of
statute on the ground that the requirement of preliminary formal
legal proceedings and a judicial trial would result in defeating
the beneficial object sought to be obtained. Subject to limitations, the right may be exercised by public officers, municipal
corporations, and by private individuals.

(1) Police power of the State. — It is universally conceded that
the police power of the State includes the right to destroy or
abate by a summary proceeding whatever may be regarded as a
public nuisance, and in the exercise of this power, the legislature
may, subject to constitutional limitations, declare what shall be
deemed a nuisance and provide for its suppression. This right
is akin to the right of destroying property for the public safety
in case of the prevalence of a devastating fire or other controlling exigency.

(2) Right to compensation. — Property taken or destroyed for
the purpose of abating a nuisance is not taken for public use,
and there is accordingly no obligation to make compensation
for such taking. The State may authorize the removal, destruction or abatement of nuisances before any judicial decision, and
leave the party to his right to appeal to the courts, by an action
for damages, for a determination of the question whether the
thing abated was a nuisance. (Ibid. 792, 793-796.)

Commenting on the need for provisions on abatement of a
nuisance, the Code Commission says: “One of the most serious
hindrances to the enjoyment of life and property is a nuisance,
whether public or private. Provisions for its abatement, both

Art. 699

NUISANCE

127

judicial and extrajudicial, are, therefore, indispensable in a wellrounded Civil Code.’’ (Report, p. 51.)
(3) Cases of summary abatement. — The following are examples
of public nuisance held abatable without judicial proceedings.

(a) A factory without provision for accumulation or
disposal of waste matters and constructed without building permits, contiguously to and therefore, liable to pollute
one of the water pipelines which supplies potable water to
the Greater Manila area. (The Homeowners Association of
El Deposito, Barrio Corazon de Jesus, San Juan, Rizal vs.
Lood, 47 SCRA 174 [1972].)
(b) Houses constructed, without governmental authority,
on public streets and waterways, obstruct at all times, the
free use by the public of said street and waterways, and,
accordingly, constitute nuisances per se, aside from being
public nuisances. (Sitchon vs. Aquino, 98 Phil. 458 [1956].)

(c) Squatters. Their houses are public nuisances per se.
Squatting is unlawful even under permits or licenses issued
by competent authority. (Mendoza vs. National Housing
Authority, 111 SCRA 637 [1982]; City of Manila vs. Garcia,
19 SCRA 413 [1967].)

(d) A water pumping plant immediately adjacent to a
house rendered practically unhabitable because of the smoke,
noise, vibrations, odors and sparks from the plant. (Bengzon
vs. Province of Pangasinan, 62 Phil. 816 [1936].)
(e) Indiscriminate discard of garbage and excrete which
poses a serious threat to public health. (Reyes vs. Villegas,
12 CAR [2s] 302.)

(f) Market stalls constructed on a portion of a town
plaza which is property of public dominion devoted to
public use, which cannot be disposed of or even leased by
a municipality to private parties. (Espiritu vs. Municipal

(b) However, it does not necessarily follow that the
failure to observe Article 702 is in itself a ground for the
award of damages. Under Article 707, there are only two
cases when a private person or public official extrajudicially
abating a nuisance shall be liable for damages. (Farrales v.
City Mayor of Baguio, 44 SCRA 24 [1972].)

(c) Article 702 does not empower the district health officer to abate a public nuisance to the exclusion of all other
authorities. His power is simply to determine whether or
not abatement, without judicial proceedings, is the best
remedy against a public nuisance. While the district health
officer may also institute proceedings to abate a nuisance,
this power can be properly exercised only when the nuisance
is one that affects public health and sanitation. (Magtibay
v. Goco, 1 C.A. Rep. 419 [1961]; see Art. 707.)

(2) In the City of Manila, the abatement of illegal constructions is expressly lodged under its charter (R.A. No. 409.) in

the City Engineer. Its charter being a special law, it was held
to prevail over Articles 700 and 702 of the Civil Code which is
a general law. (Sitchon v. Aquino, 98 Phil. 455 [1956].)
(3) Under the National Building Code, the Building Official
is authorized when any building or structure is found or declared to be dangerous or ruinous, to order its repair, vacation
or demolition depending upon the degree of danger to life,
health or safety, without prejudice to further action that may
be taken under the provisions of Articles 482 and 704 to 707.
(see Sec. 214, par. 2 thereof.)
(4) The action must be commenced by the city or municipal
mayor. (Art. 701.) But a private person may also file an action
if the public nuisance is especially injurious to him. (Art. 703.)

(5) If no compelling necessity requires the summary abatement of a nuisance, the municipal authorities, under their power
to declare and abate nuisances, do not have the right to compel
the abatement of a particular thing or act as a nuisance without
reasonable notice to the person alleged to be maintaining or doing the same, of the time and place of hearing before a tribunal
authorized to decide whether such a thing or act does in law
constitute a nuisance. (Iloilo Cold Storage Co. vs. Municipal
Council, 24 Phil. 471 [1913]; Monteverde vs. Generoso, 52 Phil.
123 [1928].)
Abatement of nuisance per accidens.
Nuisances may be nuisances per se or nuisances per accidens.
(supra.)

As to the first, since they affect the immediate safety of
persons and property, they may be summarily abated under
the undefined law of necessity. But if the nuisance be of the
second class, even the municipal authorities, under their power
to declare and abate nuisances, would not have the right to
compel the abatement of a particular thing or act as a nuisance
without reasonable notice and hearing.
It will readily be seen that whether a particular thing is a
nuisance is generally a question of fact, to be determined in the
first instance before the term “nuisance’’ can be applied to it.

130

Arts. 700-702

This is certainly true of a legitimate calling, trade, or business
such as an ice plant. (Iloilo Cold Storage Co. vs. Municipal
Council, 24 Phil. 471 [1913].)
Determination of a lawful business
as a nuisance.
Whether a lawful business is or will be a nuisance is a question of fact to be determined under the peculiar circumstances
of each case.
The law of nuisance affords no rigid rule to be applied in all
instances. It is elastic. It undertakes to require only that which
is fair and reasonable under all circumstances.

(1) One who settles in a district, which possesses natural
resources of a special kind, cannot prohibit the development of
those sources merely because it may interfere in some degree
with personal satisfaction of aesthetic enjoyment. No one can
move into a quarter given over to foundries and boiler shops
and demand the quiet of a farm. On the other hand, the noisy
or noisome factory cannot with immunity invade territory
stamped by use of residence. (De Ayala vs. Barretto, 33 Phil.
538 [1916].)

(2) The regulations for the conduct, control and operation of
garages that a Municipal Council may promulgate should not
encroach upon the legitimate and lawful exercise by the citizens
of their property rights. Municipal Ordinance No. 1, in question,
which prohibits the establishment or operation of bus or freight
truck-terminals within certain area of the town, constitutes an
unwarranted and unlawful curtailment of the exercise of that
right. The plaintiff’s bus terminal is not a nuisance per se or per
accidens because it is made of strong materials and equipped
with modern toilet facilities and that it is other vehicles and
not the plaintiff’s buses going in and out of the terminal that
obstruct the smooth flow of traffic and produce traffic congestion,
and said ordinance has no bearing whatsoever on the health,
safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of the defendant
municipality. (Pampanga Bus Co., Inc. vs. Municipality of Tarlac,
3 SCRA 816 [1961].)
(3) A smoked fish factory is a legitimate industry. It is a

Arts. 700-702

NUISANCE

131

nuisance per accidens if it be, in fact, a nuisance. Consequently,
the order of the municipal president and those of the health
authorities issued with a view to the summary abatement of
what they have concluded, by their own findings, as a nuisance,
are null and void there having been no hearing in court to that
effect. (Lucas vs. Santos, 67 Phil. 547 [1939].)

(4) The fact that the defendant was operating his ice-plant
before the plaintiff built his house, which was not then a nuisance because it was only a 5-ton capacity and 25 meters away
from plaintiff’s house is not a valid defense to abatement under
the order of priorities, if, after the plaintiff has constructed his
house, the defendant expanded his ice-plant by increasing its
engine to a 40-ton capacity and was only 3 meters distant from
plaintiff’s house, thereby becoming a nuisance due to increased
noise, vibration, and emission of oil, soot, dirt, ashes and water.
(Marasigan vs. Espiritu, 16 CAR [2s] 680.)
(5) The keeping or storage of gasoline may constitute a
nuisance, either private or public. Whether or not it becomes
a nuisance depends upon the location, the quantity, and other
surrounding circumstances. While it would not necessarily depend upon the degree of care used in the storage, the manner
in which the tanks are constructed and operated may be considered. (Javier and Ozaeta vs. Earnshaw, 64 Phil. 626 [1937].)

(6) The zoning ordinance in question prohibited the body
building operations of petitioner. A body building shop is not
within the purview of “garage’’, which designates a shop for
storing, repairing, and servicing motor vehicles, being merely
a modern substitute for the ancient livery stable. The business
of petitioner is not a mere garage or automobile repair and
painting shop, much less a gasoline service station, within the
contemplation of the Ordinance.
Whether a business, occupation, act, or building is a nuisance or not, is a question of fact. Petitioner’s business is not
a nuisance per se. It is only on account of the location that it is
public nuisance. To abate it, it is not necessary, to remove all
buildings and structures built in the place where it is presently
located, as these, or parts thereof, may be utilized for pursuits
that are not forbidden by law or ordinance. (Ramcar, Inc. vs.

132

Arts. 700-702

Millar, 6 SCRA 517 [1962].)

(7) The permit issued for the operation of a rice sawmill
constructed in front of a private hospital, which sawmill exhales
foul odor or causes physical discomfort to such degree as to
constitute a nuisance, pursuant to such ordinance, the municipal
may be revoked or cancelled and the operation of a hospital
is a matter that, not only concerns its owners or operators, but
also, if not more particularly, affects the health and welfare of
the community, and that the damage sustained by the latter, in
consequence, either of the obstruction to the proper operation of
said hospital or of its closing, can not possibly be compensated
in full. (Canlas vs. Aquino, 2 SCRA 814 [1961].)

The deprivation of an adequate and substantial means of
access to a road, and the suffering of material, moral and physical injuries, such as the abandonment by tenants of the ground
floor of plaintiff’s house, resulting in loss of rentals to plaintiff
and depreciation in the value of his property while the same
remained untenanted, which are particularly sustained by the
plaintiff and the members of his family and not shared by the
general public, authorize a private person to abate a public
nuisance. (Magtibay vs. Goco, 1 CAR [2] 418).
(8) An undertaking and mortuary establishment is not a
nuisance per se since it is a lawful business. But such a business may become a nuisance by virtue of the circumstances
involved, especially when located in a residential district. In
accordance with the general principles governing the granting
of injunction against threatened or apprehended and existing
nuisances, many courts have granted injunction to prevent the
establishment or maintenance of an undertaking and embalming business in a residential area of a city where it is made to
appear that such establishment will substantially interfere with
the comfort, repose and happiness of neighboring residents and
will materially depress the value of the neighboring residences
by rendering them less desirable as home. (Del Rosario vs.
Valencia, 19 CAR [2s] 788, citing 54 Am. Jur., 513-514.)
Art. 703. A private person may file an action on
account of public nuisance, if it is specially injuri-

Art. 703

NUISANCE

133

ous to himself.
Right of private person to file action
on account of a public nuisance.
Ordinarily, the civil action against a public nuisance is commenced by the city or municipal mayor. (Art. 701.) However,
a private person may also file a civil action (Art. 699[2].) if the
public nuisance is especially injurious to himself. In other words,
the nuisance (e.g., bodies of filthy or dirty water; a building in
danger of falling on his property) becomes as to him a private
nuisance affecting him in a special way different from that sustained by the public in general. The action may be abatement,
injunction, or damage, infra.)
Generally, what constitutes special injury to a person must
be determined from the particular facts and circumstances of
each case.

To warrant a suit by an individual, there must be an invasion
or violation of some private right, as distinguished from the public
right, which the plaintiff has in common with the rest of the public. In the absence of a showing of special or unusual damages,
differing from those suffered by the general public, a cause of action does not arise in favor of a private individual. However, the
injury need not be unique to the complaining party, and the fact
that many are injured does not make the nuisance such a common one as to exclude redress by a private individual. An action
may be maintained by one who is not the sole or even a peculiar
sufferer, if his grievance is not common to the whole public, but
is a common misfortune of a number or even a class of persons.
(Johnson v. P.J.D. Reuction Co., 175 Cal. 63, 164 P. 1119; see Magtibay v. Goco, 1 C.A. Rep. 418 [1961]; 58 Am. Jur. 2d 689.)
Thus, the pollution of a navigable stream which interfered
with the fishing and bathing rights of all who would use them
is a public nuisance and not a tort against any one sustaining
the common damage. But where plaintiff showed that he maintained a commercial fish hatchery with an extensive business
which was ruined, he was entitled to recover. Again, recovery
may be had by one suffering special damage caused by a public
nuisance even though his injury did not involve an interference

134

TORTS

Art. 704

with the use of land in which he had any property interest,
e.g., where a traveler on the highway sustains personal injury
from an obstruction placed there improperly by the defendant.
Strictly speaking, this is not a case of a private nuisance but one
where plaintiff sustains special injury from a public nuisance.
(Harper & James, op. cit., p. 65.)
Art. 704. Any private person may abate a public nuisance which is specially injurious to him by
removing, or if necessary, by destroying the thing
which constitutes the same, without committing a
breach of the peace, or doing unnecessary injury.
But it is necessary:
(1) That demand be first made upon the owner
or possessor of the property to abate the nuisance;
(2) That such demand has been rejected;
(3) That the abatement be approved by the district
health officer and executed with the assistance of
the local police; and
(4) That the value of the destruction does not
exceed Three thousand pesos.
Conditions for extrajudicial abatement
of a public nuisance.

Articles 704 and 706 state what may be done in abating a
public or private nuisance: the party injured may remove, and
if necessary, destroy the thing which constitutes the nuisance,
without committing a breach of the peace, or doing unnecessary damage.
Commenting on the extrajudicial abatement of a public
nuisance by a private person, the Code Commission says:

“The latter, when carried out by a private person, has
been adopted from American law, with certain modifications. The change consists in requiring, among other things,
that the proposed abatement be approved by the mayor,
and executed with the assistance of the local police. In the
United States, these requisites are not necessary. But the

Art. 704

NUISANCE

135

Code Commission believes that in view of the newness of
the remedy, extrajudicial abatement might cause breaches of
the peace, unless the above conditions are complied with.’’
(Report, p. 52.)

In abating a nuisance, whether public (Art. 704.) or private, a
person may even go to the extent of destroying the thing which
constitutes the nuisance provided he commits no breach of the
peace nor causes unnecessary injury, and provided further that
the procedure for the extrajudicial abatement of public nuisance
prescribed in Article 704 is complied with. (Art. 706.) He must
use ordinary care to prevent the infliction of any unnecessary
injury although such care which is ordinarily expected by abators is not required when the nuisance produces imminent peril
to his person or property and is compelled to act in emergency.
In any case, the means employed must be reasonable, and
for any excessive damage or force employed, the actor will be
liable.
Purpose of giving notice.
It is established that a person who suffers injury from a private nuisance may abate it without resort to legal proceedings,
provided that he can do so without bringing about a breach of
the peace. Usually, notice must be given to the person responsible before abating the nuisance, especially if it is necessary to
enter upon his property in order to do so.
The purpose of the notice is to give such person an opportunity to abate the nuisance himself. Where, however, the
person knows that the other party claims that the thing abated
is a nuisance and desires its abatement, and refuses an offer by
such party to pay for removing it, he is not entitled to further
notice. Also, the giving of notice may be dispensed with if the
danger to health, life, or property is imminent and the necessity of prompt removal of the nuisance is urgent. (58 Am. Jur.
2d 810-811.)
Art. 705. The remedies against a private nuisance
are:

136

TORTS

Arts. 705-706

(1) A civil action; or
(2) Abatement, without judicial proceedings.
Art. 706. Any person injured by a private nuisance may abate it by removing, or if necessary, by
destroying the thing which constitutes the nuisance,
without committing a breach of the peace or doing
unnecessary injury. However, it is indispensable that
the procedure for extrajudicial abatement of a public
nuisance by a private person be followed.
Remedies against a private nuisance.

The remedies provided in Article 705 are the same as the
remedies against a public nuisance except for the absence of
the first remedy of criminal prosecution. (Art. 699[1].) There
are, in general, three (3) types of remedy on nuisance: private
abatement, injunction, and damages.
Anyone who is legally damaged by a nuisance may have the
remedies available to redress the wrong. Whether the nuisance
consists either in the escape of deleterious things or in the interference with an easement, the occupier of the land whose quiet
and peaceable enjoyment thereto has been disturbed may sue the
wrongdoer, whether such occupier be a tenant or owner of the
land. So too, one who has no property interest therein but, as
a guest or member of the owner’s family, has sustained bodily
harm may recover therefor. Who may recover for a harm due
to nuisances arising out of negligence, is, of course, governed
by the law pertaining to negligence in general.
Abatement of private nuisance.

(1) Scope of the privilege. — A privilege exists on the part of
a person harmed by a private nuisance to abate the nuisance
by the use, if necessary, of reasonable force, and the one maintaining the nuisance cannot recover for any damage done to
his property, real or personal, if he who abates the nuisance
uses due care and causes no unnecessary injury. The privilege
extends to entry on another’s land and to interference, damage
or, where circumstances justify, destruction of chattels thereon.
(2) Person entitled to abate. — Not everyone can abate a private nuisance; only the person or persons harmed thereby. This

Arts. 705-706

NUISANCE

137

rule is usually enunciated as limiting the privilege of summary
abatement to those who might bring an action for damages
therefor. If the nuisance arises because of the escape of tangible
substances onto adjoining land, it is clear that no one but him
having a legal interest in the property affected can abate since
no one else could bring an action on account of such nuisance.
But persons other than those having a legal interest in the
land may sue for damages if a nuisance interfering with the
user of the land actually produces bodily harm. If he is lawfully on the land with the consent of the owner, he may recover
damages on account of bodily harm sustained by a nuisance
on adjoining land, but, having no legal or equitable interest in
the land, he is in no position to resort to summary abatement.
(3) When privileges to be exercised. — The privilege of abatement must be exercised within a reasonable time after knowledge of the nuisance is acquired or should have been acquired
by the person entitled to abate. If the actor has delayed long
enough before resorting to legal process, and the reason for the
privilege of summary abatement fails, the privilege fails with
it.

The remedy of abatement by act of the person injured should
be resorted to within a reasonable time, as the right to abate may
be lost by acquiescence in the injury for a considerable time.
Lapse of time, however, cannot legalize any nuisance, whether
public or private (Art. 698.) where the damage is a recurring or
continuing one rather than an isolated invasion of the plaintiff’s
interest. (Harper & James, op. cit., p. 51.)
Injunctive relief against a nuisance.
(1) “Irreparable’’ injury to plaintiff. — The plaintiff must show
that the threatened harm will result in “irreparable’’ injury within
the meaning of that term in equity. If the nuisance is continuous,
the damage is great, and there is apparently no opportunity for
the defendant to alleviate the harm which his conduct causes,
his entire enterprise may be absolutely restrained even though,
but for the unreasonable harm to the plaintiff, it would be a
perfectly lawful business, e.g., stockyard, slaughterhouse, or
keeping horses in residential area.

138

TORTS

Arts. 705-706

(2) No “adequate’’ remedy in the ordinary course of law. — It
must also appear that the plaintiff has no “adequate’’ remedy at
law, as such remedies are regarded by the traditional principles
of equity.

(3) “Balance’’ of convenience with plaintiff. — The plaintiff
must also make it appear that the “balance’’ of convenience
is with him, i.e., less severe harm will result to the defendant
from granting the injunction than will result to the plaintiff by
leaving him to his legal remedy, unless serious detriment to the
public would result from a refusal to enjoin.
Before the court finds the existence of a nuisance at all, a
balancing process takes place in a comparison of the harm of
which the plaintiff complains with other factors, including the
hardship to the defendant.
(a) After consideration of all the pertinent factors, the
court may conclude that a nuisance exists and grant the
injunction.

(b) But even if the court concluding that a nuisance exists, it does not necessarily follow that it will be enjoined.
The court may come to the conclusion that the hardship
occasioned to the defendant by enjoining his entire activity
might so outweigh the harm caused to the plaintiff by its
continuance that the latter must be content with the recovery
of damages.
(c) So too, in many cases it is feasible to enjoin only such
part of the activity or the manner in which it is conducted
as caused seriously harmful consequences, leaving the defendant to modify his project to conform to the decree if he
can do so.1 (Ibid., pp. 89-91.)
Action for damages against a nuisance.
The action for damages permits the plaintiff to recover for
all damages caused up to the time of the suit if the nuisance
was such that the defendant may be expected to abate it. If the
defendant fails to abate the nuisance, its continuance constitutes
a new nuisance and gives rise to another action for damages,
as where the defendant repeatedly floods the plaintiff’s lands.

Art. 707

NUISANCE

139

But if the nuisance can not be abated or is such that the court
will not enjoin its continuance, all damages must be obtained
in one action.

The right to successive actions serves the double purpose
of compensating the plaintiff and inducing the defendant to
abate the nuisance. In addition, it prevents one person from
practically compelling another to sell a legal right. (Ibid., p. 91.)
Art. 707. A private person or a public official
extra-judicially abating a nuisance shall be liable
for damages:
(1) If he causes unnecessary injury; or
(2) If an alleged nuisance is later declared by the
courts to be not a real nuisance.
Liability for damages in case of extrajudicial abatement of nuisance.
Article 707 provides for two grounds to hold a private person or public official extrajudicially abating a nuisance liable
for damages. It serves the dual purpose of providing a sort of
deterrent against the improvident or unreasonable resort to the
remedy by unscrupulous parties and at the same time affords
the victim a civil remedy to recover damages without prejudice
to such other remedies granted by law.

141

Chapter 6
QUASI-DELICTS
Article 2176. Whoever by act or omission causes
damage to another, there being fault or negligence,
is obliged to pay for the damage done. Such fault
or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual
relation between the parties, is called a quasi-delict
and is governed by the provisions of this Chapter.
(1902a)
Conduct in general.
(1) Duty to use care. — By and large, men owe a duty to
use care in connection with their affirmative conduct, and they
owe it to all who may foreseeably be injured if that conduct is
negligently carried out. But to what extent are men under a duty
to act affirmatively in order to protect others from harm — to
what extent does a mere omission to act constitute actionable
negligence?
(2) Act or omission is conduct. — At the outset, it should be
noted that definitions of negligence commonly include both acts
and omissions which involve unreasonable risk of harm, and in
many situations, the distinction between the two is altogether
without significance in the law.

Often the same conduct could be described as either one
or the other.
Examples:

(a) The driving of an automobile through an intersection
at unabated speed without blowing a horn could be called
141

142

TORTS

Art. 2176

either negligent operation or the failure to slow down and
sound a warning when conditions required it.

(b) The operation of a machine which is dangerous because of a concealed defect could just as well be regarded
as the failure to inspect and repair the machine.

But in these cases defendant has undertaken an affirmative
line of conduct, and where that is true, he comes under the affirmative duty to take precautions reasonably needed to protect
others from injury from that conduct (as well as the negative
duty to refrain from doing anything unreasonably dangerous).
(3) Gratuitous undertaking to confer a benefit. — Another type
of case which perhaps is no different from the one just described
is presented where defendant gratuitously undertakes to confer
a benefit on plaintiff. Defendant comes under no legal obligation to confer the benefit and a duty is not created by merely
starting to perform the undertaking. (see Chap. 2.)

(a) In the performance, however, defendant must use
care not to injure plaintiff in some way over and above the
mere failure to confer the benefit.
Example: If a landlord assumes to make repairs where
there is no obligation to do so, he will be liable if he does
“a bungling job of it,’’ and the tenant is injured because
of the dangerous condition created. The repairs need not
have worsened the actual physical condition. Liability will
be imposed for the creation of an appearance of improvement which injects new danger into the situation because
the appearance is belied by the fact.
(b) A closer question is presented when there has been
no performance but the promisee is injured as a result of
his reliance on defendant’s gratuitous undertaking.
Example: A doctor, for instance, promises to visit a charity
patient and negligently fails to do so before it is too late.
The patient could and would have called another doctor if
it had not been for the first one’s promise. There is certainly
authority for denying liability here.
Yet where the plaintiff’s reliance is both reasonable and fore-

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

143

seeable and where defendant should also foresee an unreasonable
likelihood of harm to him as a result of it, if the undertaking is
not carried out, general principles call for liability where plaintiff
does rely and is harmed by defendant’s negligent failure to do
what he said he would. (Harper & James, The Law of Torts,
Vol. 2, 1956 Ed., pp. 1044-1045.)
Concept of fault.
“There is fault when a person acts in a manner contrary
to what should have done. The necessary care and precaution
vary according to the matter involved; and even with respect to
same matter, according to the time. A variation in the facts, in
the law, and in the moral and social concepts, may lead courts
to consider as culpable now an act which was not in the past
so considered, or vice-versa.
Only juridical fault, but not moral fault, gives rise to liability
for damages. Lack of charity or of altruism, constituting moral
fault, does not constitute a quasi-delict. Thus, a person who folds
his arms while another is in danger of death, is guilty only of
moral negligence, but not of juridical negligence, and cannot
be held liable for damages.

But while the law does not require charity or altruism, it
requires prudence and care, considering the attendant circumstances. For instance, the owner of an open ditch by the side of
a street, who does not light it at night, will be liable to persons
who may fall therein in the darkness. (A.M. Tolentino, Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the Civil Code, 1992 Ed., Vol.
V, 593-595.)
The fault or culpa referred to in Article 2176 is “fault substantive
and independent’’ which, in itself, is a source of obligations (Art.1
1157.), and is also known as culpa aquiliana as distinguished from
culpa contractual. (infra.) If the fault is committed intentionally to
cause damage to another, it becomes a dolo punished as a crime
by the Revised Penal Code or other penal law.
Concept of negligence.
When not otherwise indicated, refers to article in the Civil Code.
A notable exception is a Vermont statute requiring assistance when the defendant

1
2

144

TORTS

Art. 2176

“Negligence is the failure to observe for the protection of
the interests of another person, that degree of care, precaution
and vigilance which the circumstances justly demand, whereby
such other person suffers injury. It is a relative or comparative,
and not an absolute, term, and its application depends upon
the situation of the parties and the reasonable degree of care
and vigilance which the surrounding circumstances reasonably
impose. Where the danger is great, a high degree of care is necessary and the failure to observe it is a want of ordinary care.

Under this concept of negligence, it has been held that mere
intoxication is not negligence, nor does the mere fact of intoxication establish a want of ordinary care. If a person’s conduct
is characterized by a proper degree of care and prudence, it is
immaterial whether he is drunk or sober.’’ (Ibid., p. 595.)
Distinction between fault and negligence.
Liability for fault usually arises from a positive act or conduct
while that for negligence is incurred through omission. In many
situations, however, this distinction does not exist.
(supra.)

A person guilty of negligence is necessarily at fault, but there
may be fault without negligence as where the damage or injury
resulting from the wrongful act or omission was caused willfully
and not by reason of lack of care. So, fault is the broader term.
The “no duty-to-act rule.’’
(1) General rule. — Unless the defendant has assumed a duty
to act, or stands in a special relationship to the plaintiff, defendants are not liable in tort for a pure failure to act for the plaintiff’s
benefit. The fact that the defendant foresees harm to a particular
individual from his failure to act does not change the general rule.
These propositions are widely accepted and acted upon.2
Example: The Restatement illustrates the classic general
rule by supposing that the defendant sees an unsighted

knows of grave physical danger to another and can assist without danger to himself. Vt.

443, 190 Cal.Rptr. 310, 37 A.L.R. 4th 1183 [1983].) where the plaintiff alleged that a patron
of Happy Jack’s Saloon went across the street to the Circle Inn and asked the bartender

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

person about to step in front of an approaching car. The
defendant could prevent his injury or death by a word or
touch, without danger to the defendant and without delaying the defendant’s own progress. But he does nothing to
prevent injury, which in fact follows.
The general rule applies to relieve the defendant of any
liability.3

(2) Supporters and critics. — Many scholars have offered their
thoughts on the general rule.

(a) In favor of the rule, or some version of it, Professor
Epstein emphasizes the importance of individual freedom of
action, the absence of any moral duty to act, and the very
considerable difficulty of administering any general duty
to act for the benefit of others. Professor James Henderson
thinks a general duty of reasonable rescue would violate
important legal process values and would be unmanageable.
(b) Many other scholars have expressed differing views in
various degrees. One line of thought is that the rule should
be rephrased to impose an affirmative duty to act, at least
in an “emergency,’’ when reasonable people would do so,
or when the defendant has special power to prevent warm
with little effort, especially if that power was derived in part
from legal rights or privileges. Those who favor a general
duty to act when reasonable people would do so believe

there to call the police or to permit the patron to do so because a man had been threatened in Happy Jack’s. The bartender refused to call or to permit the patron to do so. The
plaintiff’s father was shot and killed in Happy Jack’s presumably after the effort to call
the police. The court thought that the rule of non-liability for non-feasance should be reexamined. Circle Inn “displayed a disregard for human life that can be characterized as
morally wrong and the burden of permitting use of the phone in a public place of business
would have been minimal.’’

Although defendant had challenged a neighbor to jump into a pit of water on the
defendant’s land, defendant had no duty to save the neighbor when he was drowning (see
Yania v. Bigan, 397 Pa. 316, 155 A.2d 343 [1959].); no duty to warn of dangerous approaching traffic (Long v. Patterson, 198 Miss. 554, 22 So.2d 490 [1945]); manager of apartment
house, who had power to take gun from suicidal tenant, had no duty to do so and is not
liable for his death (Krieg v. Massey, 239 Mont. 469, 781 P.2d 277 [1989].); duty is owed to
everyone, but as a matter of policy, defendant is not liable for failure to put out neighbor’s
campfire for protection of neighbor’s child. (cf. Rockweit v. Senecal, 197 Wis.2d 409, 541
N.W.2d 742 [1995].) Cited in D.B. Dobbs, p. 853.

Many cases that fall within this problem have tried to deal with it as a proximate
cause problem. For instance, if the defendant leaves his keys in his car, a thief may steal it

146

TORTS

Art. 2176

the law should reflect virtues like compassion as well as a
central interest in liberty.

(3) Exceptions. — There are relatively few cases as simple
at the Restatement’s illustration but the rule is not limited to
emergencies or failure to rescue.
For example, the rule is embedded in the question whether
the defendant owes a duty to protect the plaintiff from harms
inflicted by others. In the context of rescue, where the rule is
normally discussed, however, litigation is apt to turn, not on
the existence of the rule, but its scope and exceptions. In fact,
it may be that properly understood exceptions have the effect
of creating a duty to act in most instances where a reasonable
person would feel compelled to act.
The exceptional cases in which a duty of care may require
reasonable affirmative steps by the defendant include:

(a) The defendant or his instrumentalities, innocently or
not, have created risks or caused harm to the plaintiff (e.g.,
defendant a “hit and run’’ driver);
(b) The defendant is in a special relationship (e.g., common carrier-passenger, innkeeper-guest, ship captain-seaman)
to the plaintiff that is deemed to create a duty of care that
encompasses affirmative action;
(c) The defendant takes affirmative action that is either
cut short or performed negligently; and

(d) The defendant has assumed a duty of affirmative
care by action or promise that evinces such an assumption.

These exceptions to the no-duty-to-act rule do not impose
strict liability. When courts recognize a duty to act affirmatively for the plaintiff’s benefit, they only impose a duty
to act when reasonable people would do so. Consequently,
one need not rescue occupants of a burning car if to do so
would subject him to unreasonable danger. The rules of
causation likewise apply.

(4) Scope of the rule protecting nonaction. — The meaning
of nonaction, or “nonfeasance’’ as it is often called, may seem
self-evident. However, many omissions to act are not regarded
as non-feasance at all but as only a part of some larger action.

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

147

Examples:

(a) If, driving your car, you fail to apply your brakes when
you approach a person in a crosswalk, you cannot defend his
claim for injury by saying you did nothing. In such a case,
you drove a car and did it very badly and will be chargeable
with a negligent act, not merely with non-feasance.
(b) Similarly, if a contractor acting under public authority digs a hole in the highway, then fails to light it at night,
courts do not think that failing to light it is non-feasance. The
failure to light is merely one part of a course of affirmative
conduct — digging improperly without lighting or guarding
the excavation.

With cases like these in mind, negligence includes “the
omission to do something’’ a reasonable person would do as
well as the doing of something a prudent person would not do.
(5) Absence of settled criteria for distinguishing pure non-action
from conduct that includes negligent omission. — But no rule has
been formulated to prescribe whether courts are to characterize
conduct as affirmative action with an embedded omission or
as simple nonaction.
(a) In Jackson v. City of Joliet (715 F 2d 1200 [7th Cir.
1983].), an officer encountered a flaming car that had gone
off the road. He called the fire department and directed
traffic, but did nothing to rescue the occupants of the car or
to call an ambulance. One occupant, an expectant mother,
died. Quite possibly the officer’s actions were reasonable in
the light of the risks to himself. However, the court did not
even consider whether the officer was negligent or not. It
concluded that, at least in a civil rights claim, the officer’s
conduct had to be viewed as a failure to prevent death, not
as an affirmative act causing death.
(b) Since there are no settled criteria for distinguishing
pure nonaction from conduct that includes a negligent omission, the Jackson court may have been right. But it would
be just as plausible to say that the officer’s failure would
be like the contractor’s failure to light the excavation, not a
case of nonfeasance at all. That view would lead a court to
consider whether, under the circumstances, the officer was

148

TORTS

Art. 2176

negligent or not. In contrast, if the no-duty rule applies,
courts do not determine whether the defendant’s conduct
was unreasonably risky or whether it was justified.

(6) Characterization of conduct. — Perhaps the cases as a whole
would justify the unsurprising and not so helpful conclusion
that judges avoid extremes in characterizing conduct.
(a) They do not characterize conduct by segregating
highly specific omissions (like failing to brake a car) from
closely related conduct (like driving).

(b) On the other hand, they do not characterize conduct
at its most abstract level, either. A water company’s failure
to provide water to a fire hydrant is not likely to be viewed
as a case of running a water company in a negligent way
but as a case of mere nonfeasance for which there is no liability in the absence of an exceptional duty. (D.B. Dobbs,
The Law of Torts, 2000 Ed., pp. 853-856.)
No duty to control others.

(1) General rule. — In a large number of cases the defendant
himself does not directly injure the plaintiff but instead fails to
prevent the risk of injury by another. The immediate tortfeasor
is sometimes merely negligent but often he carries out a criminal
attack on the plaintiff. The question is whether the defendant,
who could have prevented the injury by a warning, or by exercising the control he had over the attacker, or otherwise, is
under any duty to do so.4
In the usual case, the problem is not rescue of a plaintiff
already in peril; it is rather the use of care to prevent harm in
the first place.

and drive too fast trying to escape, causing injury in the process. Some courts say that the
driver’s negligence is not a proximate cause (see Art. 2179.) and that he is thus, not liable.
That analysis has created several problems. First, proximate cause issues call for case-bycase analysis, not a categorical rule. Although many thefts are no doubt unforeseeable, it
cannot be so that every single theft that can ever arise is in that category. Second, proximate
cause issues, including the so-called “superseding cause,’’ turn ultimately on foreseeability.
To declare that the harm is not foreseeable is to declare that the defendant is not negligent
at all and if that is the case, there is no proximate cause issue. (D.B. Dobbs, op. cit., p. 874.)

A halfway house did not report parolee’s failure to arrive upon release from prison;
parolee went on a crime spree that included rape and murder for days before anyone
noticed; “no duty to control’’ rule relieves Halfway House from duty to make a telephone

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

149

For example, when a newly released parolee with a history
of violence toward women does not appear at the halfway
house or residential center to which he is required to report,
the halfway house can minimize the risk that the parolee will
commit crimes by warning the prison or the police that he has
not appeared as required.
Although a phone call by the halfway house in the example
does not seem onerous, given the halfway house’s effort to direct criminals into a better path, courts have often conceived of
this and a variety of other situations narrowly as a question of
the defendant’s control over others rather than as a question of
the defendant’s ability to protect the plaintiff from foreseeable
harm. They have frequently said that, with certain exceptions,
the defendant owes no duty to control the dangerous person
and have taken that premise as grounds for refusing relief to
the parolee’s victims.5

Similarly, a church Mission Board, learning that one of its
missionaries is sexually molesting his own children, has no duty
to help prevent future harm to the same child or other, even
by providing a warning to the child’s mother before washing
its hands of the matter.
In some instances, the defendant has done nothing, so the
nonfeasance rule would protect the defendant unless his relationship establishes an affirmative duty to act. However, in many
of the cases, the defendant seems to be acting affirmatively and
in so doing creating a risk of harm to the plaintiff. Perhaps
that is true in the Halfway House example, because it is possible to think that the defendant is operating a Halfway House
and doing a very bad job of it, not merely failing to use the
telephone. The rule that the defendant has no duty to control
others (or to protect the plaintiff) seems to be independent of

warning of his absence; (Johnson v. State, 553 N.W.2d 40 [Minn. 1996].); but cf. Dudley
v. Offender Aid and Restoration of Richmond, Inc., 241 Va. 270, 401 S.E. 2d 878, 9 A. 2. r.
5th 1203 [1991].): felon with history of violence in a halfway house never held to rules for
remaining in the house, raped and murdered a victim; liability of halfway house established. Cited in D.B. Dobbs, p. 874.

Quasi-delict is of ancient lineage. One of its early ancestors is the Lex Aquilia of the Roman Law. In Spanish legal terminology, it is often referred to as culpa aquiliana. The Partidos

the non-feasance rule and to go much further because it immunizes affirmative risky acts in some cases.
(2) Exceptions. — The general rule is subject to significant
exceptions that fall into three (3) categories.

(a) Statutes may impose a duty to take action and to
use care to protect others. This is the case with statutes requiring state agencies to investigate and deal with reports
of suspected child abuse.

(b) The defendant is under a duty to use reasonable
care for the plaintiff’s safety where the defendant is in a
special relationship with the plaintiff. A property owner, for
example, may owe a duty of reasonable care to protect an
invitee or other entrant upon the land.
(c) The defendant is under a duty to use reasonable care
for the plaintiff’s safety when the defendant is in a special
relationship with the immediate tortfeasor and in a position
to control his tortious behavior or at least to minimize risks
to the plaintiff by some means. For example, a jailer or other
custodian of a dangerous person owes a duty of reasonable
care to prevent that person from harming others. (Ibid., pp.
874-875.)
Negligence cause of action.
A person who negligently causes personal injury or property
damage is a subject to liability in tort.

Negligence claims represent the great majority of tort claims
presented, brought, or tried today. In part, this reflects the
large number of injuries resulting from the use of automobiles
— which are often used negligently but not so often as instruments of intentional torts. Negligence claims are not, of course,
limited to automobile cases. A wide range of a human misery is
produced by negligence and it is negligence law on the whole
that controls suits for injuries suffered by patients, tenants, and
customers at the hands of doctors, landlords, and businesses.
Negligence law usually controls when injury is inflicted in the
course of an active sport, in the course of law enforcement or
firefighting activities, or in the course of farming. People are
negligently shot, burned, drowned, or poisoned.

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

151

Although intentional wrongdoing may be found in any of
these cases and strict liability in some of them, the overwhelming number turn on a claim that the defendant was negligent.
The concept of negligence and the sets of rules that go with that
concept dominate the law of torts. (D.B. Dobbs, op. cit., p. 257.)
Characteristics of the negligence case.
Negligence cases have many important characteristics. They
may require detailed evidence, often complex and scientific evidence, for example. But in terms of broad legal structure, the
negligence case can be characterized by a few points:

(1) Open-ended claims. — The structure of the negligence
case allows the plaintiff to claim that any given conduct was
negligent. The argument is that the defendant should not have
indulged in that conduct at all or he should have carried it out
more safely. It is not necessary for the plaintiff to show some
predetermined act. At least in form, this differs from the rules
for the intentional trespassory torts which involve particular
conduct (e.g., a harm or offensive touching, an entry upon land).
Negligence law in contrast is open-ended.
There are many important rules governing negligence cases.
Nevertheless, because the negligence claim is open-ended and
requires evaluation case-by-case, rules do not always have an
enormous direct impact on the ultimate result.

(2) Actual harm requirement. — Another characteristic of
negligence cases can be seen in the rule that no claim for negligence will be recognized unless the plaintiff suffers actual
harm. The most uncomplicated meaning of the actual harm rule
is that there is no such thing as a negligence suit for nominal
damages, much less one for presumed damages. Here again,
the trespassory torts are quite different. A trespass to land, for
example, always justifies at least the recovery of nominal damages. Similar rules apply to the other trespassory torts.
The negligence claim is different. No matter how offended
or distressed the plaintiff might be when the defendant drives
at 100 mph in a school zone, the defendant is not liable for

152

TORTS

Art. 2176

negligence if he causes no harm.

(3) Preoccupation with bodily harm and property damage. — The
actual harm requirement does not itself exclude the possibility
that some purely emotional harms could be actionable against
a negligent defendant. And in fact defendants who are guilty
of negligently causing serious emotional distress are occasionally held liable for such harm even though they have caused
neither bodily injury nor property damage. However, courts
almost invariably impose especially restrictive rules on such
claims and deny recovery in many of them.
Some of the same reluctance carries over to other intangible
injuries, such as financial injuries the plaintiff suffers even when
no physical harm is done. Here, too, negligence rules are usually adapted to limit the cases in which the plaintiff can recover.
The upshot is that the core of negligence law is about injury to
persons and property. Other tort rules protect against intangible
losses like emotional or financial harm, but negligence alone is
often not enough for liability in those cases.

(4) Damages when negligence claim is established. — When the
plaintiff succeeds, in establishing a negligence claim against the
defendant, courts award damages for a wide range of injuries,
including damages for emotional harm and financial loss. There
is seldom a tort claim for stand-alone emotional or financial
harm based on simple negligence.

Once a negligence claim is established by showing that the
defendant negligently caused property damage or bodily injury,
the victim can recover all damages that are reasonably foreseeable including damages for such intangibles as pain, a sense
of lost enjoyment of life, and emotional distress. Financial loss
resulting from injury or property damage, such as lost wages or
medical expenses, is likewise recoverable, as all proven future
losses. (Ibid., pp. 257-259.)
Negligence: conduct vs. state of mind.
(1) Negligence as risk. — Negligence is conduct that creates or
fails to avoid unreasonable risks of foreseeable harm to others.
Not all risky conduct is negligent, for some risks are entirely
justified. And not all negligence is actionable as a tort, for some

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

153

negligence is permitted and some causes no harm. To determine
negligence, then, is to fit only one piece into the jigsaw puzzle
of a lawsuit.
One other warning is called for. Although negligence is indeed unreasonably risky conduct, that kind of conduct is often
referred to by saying that the defendant is negligent if he fails
to act as a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances.

(2) Negligence as conduct, not state of mind. — Because the
emphasis in negligence cases is on unreasonably risky conduct,
the concept is not entirely parallel to the case of intent, where
liability is based upon a combination of intent and conduct. A
bad state of mind is neither necessary nor sufficient to show
negligence, and conduct is everything. One who drives at a
dangerous speed is negligent even if he is not aware of his
speed and is using his best efforts to drive carefully. Conversely,
a person who drives without the slightest care for the safety
of others is not negligent unless he drives in some way that is
unreasonably risky.
State of mind, including knowledge and belief, may motivate
or shape conduct, but it is not in itself an actionable tort. The
legal concept of negligence as unduly risky conduct distinct
from state of mind reflects the law’s strong commitment to an
objective standard of behavior.

(3) Conduct including acts or omissions. — Conduct is often
an affirmative act such as driving too fast. But conduct can
include omissions or failures to act. A driver’s failure to apply
the brakes when a cow wanders into the road is conduct and
so is a jailer’s failure to prevent a prisoner’s suicide.

On the other hand, an unconscious person’s movement is
not conduct even if that movement harms someone. Conduct
involves at least a degree of volition.

(4) Intentionally risky conduct: the relation of negligence and
intentional torts. — How does this conception of negligence as
conduct work with the defendant who knows that his conduct
is riskier than normal.
First, such a defendant is not guilty of an intentional tort

154

TORTS

Art. 2176

merely because he knows of the risk. Intent to commit a battery,
for example, requires either a purpose or a substantial certainty
that such contact will result. So intentional conduct and even
intentional risk-taking is analyzed under negligence rules unless
the defendant has a purpose to invade the plaintiff’s interests
or a certainty that such an invasion will occur.
Second, the defendant who intentionally takes a risk may or
may not be negligent. Negligence will depend upon the seriousness of the risk and the reasons for taking it.
(5) Example of intentionally risky conduct. — To see these
points in an example:

Suppose the batter in a softball game knows the battled ball
might conceivably break a window outside the park and across
the street, but also knows that it is unlikely. He is intentionally
taking a risk when he attempts to bat; but the risk is small,
far short of a substantial certainty. By definition of intent, the
batter, though intentionally taking a risk, is not intentionally
causing the softball to enter another’s land.

Intentional risk-taking is not intentional touching required
in battery cases or intentional entry upon land required in
trespass cases. Is the batter then chargeable with negligence if
not intent? That depends upon whether the risk was an unreasonable one. If the house is very close even though outside the
park, maybe the batter is negligent, but if the risk of an broken
window from a batted ball is a very small risk, batting the ball
may not be negligent.
(6) When state of mind is relevant. — In spite of the fact that it
is conduct and risk, not mental state, that determine negligence,
the defendants state of mind is not necessarily irrelevant in a
negligence case. The defendant’s knowledge of facts that make
a given act risky (as distinct from his attitude) is frequently
important on the negligence issue. And his socially useful purpose in taking a risk may be evidence that has conduct is not
unreasonably risky.

Finally, a defendant who is taking an unreasonable risk
and knows it, may be guilty of reckless or wanton misconduct
that would justify punitive damages or other liabilities. None
of this, however, departs from the requirement of objectively

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

155

unreasonable outward conduct. (Ibid., pp. 275-276.)
Concept of quasi-delict.

Based on Article 2176, a quasi-delict6 may be defined as an
act or omission by a person (tortfeasor) which causes damage
to another in his person, property, or rights, giving rise to an
obligation to pay for the damage done, there being fault or
negligence but there is no pre-existing contractual relation between the parties.7
The basic principle of our law on quasi-delict, except in those
cases expressly provided for, is that a person cannot be held liable
for damage caused by him, unless he is at fault or is negligent and
the damage is produced by his wrongful act or omission.
Scope of Article 2176.

(1) Limited concept of quasi-delict. — Article 2176 is the basic
provision on quasi-delict which means culpa aquiliana, culpa
extra-contractual, or quasi-delictos as the fifth source of civil
obligations. (Arts. 1157, 1162.) The term “quasi-delict’’ refers
to those obligations which do not arise from law, contracts,
quasi-contracts, or criminal offenses.

The Code Commission which drafted the Civil Code decided
to use the term instead of “tort’’ in Anglo-American jurisprudence because the latter term has a broader scope as it “includes
not only negligence, but also intentional criminal acts, such as
assault and battery false imprisonment and deceit.’’ (Report of
the Code Commission, p. 162.) Thus, Article 2176 covers all
wrongful acts or omissions which do not constitute breach of
contract or the commission of a crime.
(2) Expanded concept of quasi-delict. — Our Supreme Court,
however, has held that under Art. 1902 of the old Civil Code
(now Art. 2176), a person is liable for any culpable act which
is blameworthy. “The idea thus expressed is broad enough to
legal institution survives in the new Civil Code being now one of the five (5) sources of
obligations. (see Barredo vs. Garcia, 73 Phil. 607 [1942].)

Art. 2176

include any rational conception of liability for the tortious acts
likely to be developed in society.’’ (Daywalt vs. Corporacion de
PP Agustinos Recollectos, 39 Phil. 507 [1919].)

Fault or negligence in Article 2176 covers not only acts
or omissions “not punishable by law” but also acts criminal
in character, whether intentional and voluntary or negligent.
Consequently, a separate civil action lies against the offender in
a criminal act, whether or not he is found guilty or acquitted,
provided, that the offended party is not allowed, if the offender
is actually charged also criminally, to recover damages on both
scores, and would be entitled in such eventuality only to the
bigger award of the two, assuming the awards made in the
two cases vary. (Elcano vs. Hill, 77 SCRA 98 [1977]; Virata vs.
Ochoa, 81 SCRA 472 [1978]; see Arts. 20, 21, Chap. 4.)
In other words, the same negligent act or omission may
create an action for damages due to quasi-delict under the
Civil Code, or an action also for damages arising from a crime
or delict under the Revised Penal Code or special law, which
civil action may be maintained separately at the election of
the plaintiff. (see Chap. 1, Introduction, “Expanded concept of
quasi-delict’’)
(3) A question of nomenclature. — Delicts, that is, acts or
omissions punished by law and quasi-delicts, that is, acts or
omissions not punished by law, are two distinct and separate
sources of obligations. (Art. 1157.) Civil obligations arising from
delicts are governed by penal laws (Art. 1161.), while obligations
derived from quasi-delicts, by Chapter 2, Title XVII of the Civil
Code and by special laws. (Art. 1162.) The title of Chapter 2 of
Title XVII is “Quasi-Delicts.’’

It very evident from the above that Article 2176 can only refer
to “quasi-delicts,’’ excluding conduct punishable by law. However,
for purposes of recovering civil liability arising from a crime or felony,
the plaintiff is given the privilege or option to treat the offense as
a quasi-delict, and not as a delict, and accordingly, base his civil
action for damages which shall be entirely separate and distinct
from, and shall proceed independently of, the criminal prosecution, on the theory of quasi-delict. In the civil action, the matter at
issue is not whether the act or omission complained of constitutes
a crime, but whether said act or omission has caused damage to

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

157

the plaintiff as a consequence of the fault and negligence of the
defendant for which reason, the defendant under Article 2176, “is
obliged to pay for the damage done.’’ (see Chap. 10.)
Requisites of quasi-delict.

Before a person can be held liable for quasi-delict, the following requisites must be present:
(1) There must be an act or omission by the defendant;
(2) There must be fault or negligence of the defendant;

(3) There must be damage or injury caused to the plaintiff;

(4) There must be a direct relation or connection of cause
and effect between the act or omission and the damage; and

(5) There is no pre-existing contractual relation between the
parties.
Burden of proof.

In an action for quasi-delict, the burden of proof is generally on the person claiming damages to establish by satisfactory
evidence that the legal cause of his damage or injury was the
fault or negligence of the defendant or of one for whose acts he
must respond (see Art. 2180.) and the damages suffered by him.
As a rule, negligence is not presumed. Mere suspicion,
surmise or speculation cannot be the basis of an award for
damages. Where negligence is presumed by law (see Arts. 2180,
2183, 2191.), the burden of proof is shifted to the defendant.
Quasi-delict arising from breach
of contract.
Article 2176 expressly excludes any “pre-existing contractual
relation between the parties,’’ i.e., the plaintiff who sustained
the damage and the defendant whose negligent act or omission
was the cause thereof. Quasi-delict is essentially extra-contractual
in nature.

However, the existence of a contract does not preclude the
commission of a quasi-delict by one against another and the
consequent recovery of damages against the former. When an
act which constitutes a breach of contract would have itself

158

TORTS

Art. 2176

constituted the source of a quasi-delictual liability had no contract existed between the parties, the contract can be said to
have been breached by tort, thereby allowing the rules on tort
to apply. (Light Rail Transit Authority vs. Navidad, 397 SCRA
75 [2003]; see Chap. 1.)
Examples:

(a) “Artist X entered into a contract with Company A,
under which, for a period of five (5) years, X was to record
on discs of Company A the songs the latter might ask, with
a stipulation that she was not going to make any recording
to anybody else. This contract was made known to Company B. Notwithstanding this, X made some recordings for
Company B. Company A sued both X and Company B for
damages, and X was held liable for contractual culpa, while
Company B was held responsible for extra-contractual culpa.’’
(A.M. Tolentino, Commentaries and Jurisprudence on the
Civil Code, 1992 Ed., Vol. V, p. 592.)
(b) “Contractual responsibility and extra-contractual
liability, however, exclude each other and cannot be cumulated. For instance, if a person is under a contract to furnish
merchandise to another, and he puts explosives or poison
therein, the act no longer constitutes a mere breach of contract but an illicit act. Contractual responsibility disappears
and gives way to extra-contractual liability.’’ (Ibid.)

(c) In a case, the holder of a first class ticket in a plane
who was ousted from his first class accommodation and
compelled to take a seat in the tourist class, was awarded
damages because although the relation between the passenger and carrier is “contractual both in origin and nature,
the act that breaks the contract may also be a tort.’’

The air carrier must answer for the willful and malevolent act of its manager. (Air France vs. Carrascoso, 18 SCRA
155 [1966].)
(d) In another case, a mistake was committed by an
employee of a bank, as a result of which the checking account of a depositor was frozen by the bank and his checks
were dishonored, but upon discovering the error, the bank

immediately corrected it, apologized to the depositor and
restored his checking account.

Damages were awarded because despite the existence of
contractual relations, the “act that breaks the contract may
also be a tort.’’ (Singson vs. Bank of the Philippine Islands,
23 SCRA 1117 [1968].)

In other words, the tort liability is said to arise from a
breach of contract when the act or omission is in itself wrongful, independently of the contract, the breach of which being
merely incidental to the commission of the tort.
Culpa aquiliana and culpa contractual
distinguished.

Culpa, or fault or negligence may be either culpa aquiliana
(also known as culpa extra-contractual) or culpa contractual.
(1) The first is the wrongful or negligent act or omission
which of itself is the source of the obligation separate from, and
independent of, contract, while the second is that act or omission
considered as an incident in the performance of an obligation
already existing and which constitutes a breach thereof.
(2) As a result of this fundamental distinction:

(a) Where liability arises from culpa aquiliana, not a
breach of positive obligation, an employer or master may
excuse himself under the last paragraph of Article 2180 by
proving that he had exercised “all the diligence of a good
father of a family to prevent the damage.” This defense is
not available if the liability of the employer or master arises
from a breach of contractual duty.
(b) In culpa aquiliana, the plaintiff has the burden of
proving that the defendant was at fault or negligent, while
in culpa contractual, it is not necessary for the plaintiff to
plead or prove that the violation of the contract was due
to fault or negligence; and

(c) Consequently, in culpa aquiliana, there is no presumption that the defendant was at fault or negligent (except as
provided in Art. 2180, last par.), while in culpa contractual,
the mere proof of the existence of the contract and its breach

160

TORTS

Art. 2176

raises such presumption and the burden is on the defendant to prove that he was not at fault or negligent, because
in culpa contractual, the rule of respondeat superior (see Art.
2180.) is followed; and

(d) Culpa aquiliana is primarily governed by Article 2176,
et seq.8 while culpa contractual is governed by Articles 11701174.9 (infra.) Article 2178, however, expressly makes Articles
1172-1174 also applicable to a quasi-delict.

Both culpa aquiliana and culpa contractual are always based
upon a voluntary act or omission which has caused damage to
another and require only preponderance of evidence.
Negligent non-performance of duties
assumed by contract.
(1) Distinguished from tort obligations. — The obligations of
tort law are for the most part non-consensual and independent
of contract. They are generally imposed on men by law simply
as part of the price of living in society, or of engaging in conduct
which is likely to affect the actor’s fellow beings.

(a) Contract obligations, on the other hand, are for the
most part based on manifested consent which indeed is
needed to bring them into being. By and large, therefore,
such obligations are limited by the terms of that consent, or
at least by terms which it is fair to impose because of that
consent.

(b) Contract obligations are generally owed only to the
parties with whom the agreement was made, and with respect only to consequences which the parties had in mind
when they made their bargain. On the other hand, a duty
undertaken by agreement is often more stringent than a
duty to perform.
Yet in any case there may be negligence in carrying out the

10
Such a duty may arise from a relationship between the parties or from the nature
of defendant’s calling. Thus, a bailee has a duty to use care to protect the subject of the
bailment because of his possession of it and his relationship to the owner, without regard

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

161

contract or in failing to carry it out, and this negligent “misfeasance’’ or “nonfeasance’’ may hurt someone, in a way over and
above the withholding of performance. Even where this involves
clearly affirmative conduct (e.g., the creation of a defective machine or dangerous premises), it is noted that for years courts were
reluctant to extend liability beyond privity of contract.10

(2) Where injury to plaintiff foreseeable. — Now they recognize
that the agreement has no tendency to limit the scope of harm
to be foreseen from unreasonably dangerous conduct done by
reason of the agreement, and this foresight of harm has been
taken as the basis of a duty not based on the consent. But where
defendant’s negligence ends merely in non-performance of the
contract and where defendant is not under any recognized duty
to act apart from contract, the courts generally still see no duty
to act affirmatively except the duty based on — and limited by
defendant’s consent.
Thus, whether the action is viewed as one in contract or in
tort, only parties to the contract (or intended beneficiaries) may
complain, and their complaint will be confined to the contract
measure of damages.11

(3) Where contract an incident to enterprise of defendant. — What
may be viewed as negligent omission, so far as the individual
contract goes, may wear the color of active negligence if the
whole venture or enterprise is thought of — in very much the
same way as the omission to inspect and repair a machine is
regarded as active negligence on the part of him who continues to operate the machine without taking the precautions. A
to any contract stipulation. And this duty may well require the taking of reasonable affirmative precautionary steps. There are other relationships also which have been held to
impose on one party to them a duty to take reasonable affirmative steps for the protection
of other persons or property within the relationship. And where a defendant has entered
into a common calling, this may impose affirmative obligations upon him apart from
contract. (Harper & James, op. cit., p. 1050.)

This meant, for example, that plaintiff could recover only the reasonable cost of
repairs in cases where a landlord had negligently failed to carry out his covenant to make
them, and nothing for personal injuries caused by lack of repairs. (Murrell v. Crawford,
102 Kan. 118, 169 Pac. 561 [1917]; Korach v. Loeffel, 168 Mo. App. 414, 151 S.W. 790 [1912];
Williams v. Fenster, 103 N.J. L. 566, 137 Atl. 406 [1926].). Contra: Busick v. Home Owners Loan

duty of care to perform such contract would be owed to those
foreseeably injured by the negligent nonperformance in a way
over and above the withholding of the benefit contracted for,
without regard to any question of reliance in the specific case.12
(Harper & James, Vol. 2, op. cit., pp. 1049-1052; see Chap. 1,
Introduction.)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. A deaf-mute was run down and killed while attempting to cross
a railroad track, the engine driver believing that his warning signals
had been heard.

Facts: EC, a deaf-mute, was run down and killed, while attempting to cross the railroad, by an engine on which the accused
was employed as engineer. The deaf-mute stepped out on the
track from an adjoining field shortly before the accident, walked
along one side of the track for some little distance and was killed
as he attempted, for some unknown reason, to cross over to the
other side.

When the accused engineer first saw the deceased, he was
walking near the track, in the same direction as that in which
the train was running. The train, a heavy freight train, had just
rounded a curve, and the man in front was about 175 meters
ahead of the engine. The engineer immediately blew his whistle
twice, and noticing, a few moments afterwards, that the man in
front did not respond to the warning by stepping aside from the
track, he tried to slow down the engine, but did not succeed in
stopping in time to avoid running down the pedestrian. He did
not attempt to stop his engine when he first saw the man walking along the side of the track; but he claims that he did all in
his power to slow down a few moments afterwards, that is to
on its observance.” Cited in Harper & James, p. 1052.
12
Thus, persons who enter leased premises as guests or business visitors of the tenant
should be allowed to recover for injuries resulting from the landlord’s negligent failure
to keep a covenant to repair, even though there is no showing that plaintiff was aware of
the covenant or in any way altered his course of action in reliance on it. (2 Restatement
of Torts 357; Annotation, 163 A.L.R. 300, 313 [1946].) Cited in Harper & James, p. 1052.

The 2000 Rules of Criminal Procedure deleted the requirement of reserving independent civil actions and allowed these to proceed separately from criminal ones. Thus,
the civil actions referred to in Articles 32, 33, 34, and 2176 of the Civil Code shall remain
“separate, distinct and independent’’ of any criminal prosecution based on the same act.

say after he had blown his whistle without apparently attracting
the attention of the pedestrian, who, about that time, turned and
attempted to cross the track.

The only evidence as to the rate of speed at which the train
was running at the time of the accident was the testimony of
the accused himself, who said that his indicator showed that he
was travelling at the rate of 35 kilometers an hour, the maximum
speed permitted under the railroad regulations for freight trains
on that road.
There was a heavy decline in the track from the turn at the
curve to a point some distance beyond the place where the accident took place, and the undisputed evidence discloses that a
heavy freight train running at the rate of 35 miles an hour could
not be brought to a stop on that decline in much less than one
hundred and 150 meters.
Issue: Was the death of EC, a deaf-mute, the result of a regrettable accident.

Held: Yes. (1) Engine driver gave sufficient warning. — “It has
been suggested that, had the accused applied his brakes when he
first saw the man walking near the track, after his engine rounded
the curve, he might have stopped the train in time to have avoided
the accident, as it is admitted that the distance from the curve
to the point where the accident occurred was about 175 meters.

But there is no obligation on an engine driver to stop, or
even to slow down his engine, when he sees an adult pedestrian
standing or walking on or near the track, unless there is something in the appearance or conduct of the person on foot which
would cause a prudent man to anticipate the possibility that such
person could not, or would not avoid the possibility of danger by
stepping aside. Ordinarily, all that may properly be required of an
engine driver under such circumstances is that he give warning of
his approach, by blowing his whistle or ringing his bell until he
is assured that the attention of the pedestrian has been attracted
to the oncoming train.’’
(2) Engine driver fairly assumed that deceased was aware of the
danger. — “Of course it is the duty of an engine driver to adopt
every measure in his power to avoid the infliction of injury upon
any person who may happen to be on the track in front of his
engine, and to slow down, or stop altogether if that be necessary,
should he have reason to believe that only by doing so can an
accident be averted. But an engine driver may fairly assume that

164

TORTS

Art. 2176

all persons walking or standing on or near the railroad track,
except children of tender years, are aware of the danger to which
they are exposed; and that they will take reasonable precautions
to avoid accident, by looking and listening for the approach of
trains, and stepping out of the way of danger when their attention
is directed to an oncoming train.’’

(3) Contrary rule would render it impracticable to operate railroads.
— “Any other rule would render it impracticable to operate railroads so as to secure the expeditious transportation of passengers
and freight which the public interest demands. If engine drivers
were required to slow down or stop their trains every time they
see a pedestrian on or near the track of the railroad it might well
become impossible for them to maintain a reasonable rate of speed.
As a result, the general traveling public would be exposed
to great inconvenience and delay which may be, and is readily
avoided by requiring all persons approaching a railroad track, to
take reasonable precautions against danger from trains running
at high speed.’’

(4) Accident attributed wholly to reckless negligence of the deceased.
— “There was nothing in the appearance or conduct of the victim
of the accident in the case at bar which would have warned the
accused engine driver that the man walking along the side of the
track was a deaf-mute, and that despite the blowing of the whistle
and the noise of the engine, he was unconscious of his danger.
It was not until the pedestrian attempted to cross the track, just
in front of the train, that the accused had any reason to believe
that his warning signals had not been heard, and by that time it
was too late to avoid the accident.
Under all the circumstances, we are satisfied that the accused
was without fault; and that the accident must be attributed wholly
to the reckless negligence of the deaf-mute, in walking on the track
without taking the necessary precautions to avoid danger from a
train approaching him from behind.’’ (United States vs. Bonifacio,
34 Phil. 65 [1916].)

2. Private respondent, while walking on the terrace of the airport,
slipped over an elevation about four (4) inches high, as a result of which
he fell on his back and broke his thigh bone.
Facts: One afternoon, private respondent with several other
persons went to the Manila International Airport to meet his future
son-in-law. In order to get a better view of the incoming passen-

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

165

gers, he and his group proceeded to the viewing deck or terrace
of the airport. While walking on the terrace, then filled with other
people, private respondent slipped over an elevation about four
(4) inches high at the far end of the terrace. As a result, private
respondent fell on his back and broke his thigh bone.
The next day, December 14, 1963, private respondent was
operated on for about three hours.

Petitioner tries to escape liability on the ground that there was
no basis for a finding of negligence. There can be no negligence
on its part, it alleged, because the elevation in question “had a
legitimate purpose for being on the terrace and was never intended
to trip down people and injure them. It was there for no other
purpose but to drain water on the floor area of the terrace.”
To determine whether or not the construction of the elevation
was done in a negligent manner, the trial court conducted an
ocular inspection of the premises. It found the elevation where
plaintiff slipped to be a step, a dangerous sliding step, and the
proximate cause of plaintiffs injury. It also observed the dangerous
and defective condition of the open terrace which has remained
unrepaired through the years.

The Court of Appeals noted that “the inclination itself is an
architectural anomaly for as stated by the said witness, it is neither
a ramp because a ramp is an inclined surface in such a way that
it will prevent people or pedestrians from sliding. But if, it is a
step then it will not serve its purpose, for pedestrian purposes.’’
Issue: Is the petitioner Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
guilty of negligent construction of the elevation in question?

Held: Yes. (1) Obligation of CAA in the maintenance of the view
deck. — “The obligation of the CAA in maintaining the viewing
deck, a facility open to the public, requires that CAA insure the
safety of the viewers using it. As these people come to the viewing
deck to watch the planes and passengers, their tendency would be
to look to where the planes and the incoming passengers are and
not to look down on the floor or pavement of the viewing deck.

The CAA should have thus made sure that no dangerous
obstructions or elevations exist on the floor of the deck to prevent
any undue harm to the public.’’
(2) Foundation of CAA’s liability. — “The legal foundation of
CAA’s liability for quasi-delict can be found in Article 2176 of the
Civil Code which provides that. x x x. As the CAA knew of the
existence of the dangerous elevation which it claims though, was

166

TORTS

Art. 2176

made precisely in accordance with the plans and specifications of
the building for proper drainage of the open terrace, its failure
to have it repaired or altered in order to eliminate the existing
hazard constitutes such negligence as to warrant a finding of liability based on quasi-delict upon CAA.’’
(3) Private respondent not guilty of contributory negligence. —
“The Court finds the contention that private respondent was, at
the very least, guilty of contributory negligence, thus reducing the
damages that plaintiff may recover, unmeritorious. Contributory
negligence under Article 2179 of the Civil Code contemplates a
negligent act or omission on the part of the plaintiff, which although not the proximate cause of his injury, contributed to his
own damage, the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s own injury
being the defendant’s lack of due care.

In the instant case, no contributory negligence can be imputed
to the private respondent, considering the following test formulated
in the early case of Picart vs. Smith, 37 Phil. 809 (1918). x x x’’

(4) Private respondent could not have reasonably foreseen the
harm. — “The private respondent, who was the plaintiff in the
case before the lower court, could not have reasonably foreseen
the harm that would befall him, considering the attendant factual
circumstances. Even if the private respondent had been looking
where he was going, the step in question could not easily be
noticed because of its construction.
Exhibit O, shows a section of the floorings on which plaintiff
had tripped. This sketch reveals two pavements adjoining each
other, one being elevated by four and one-fourth inches than the
other. From the architectural standpoint, the higher pavement is
a step. However, unlike a step commonly seen around, the edge
of the elevated pavement slanted outward as one walks to the
interior of the terrace. The length of the inclination between the
edges of the two pavements is three inches. Obviously, plaintiff
had stepped on the inclination because had his foot landed on
the lower pavement he would not have lost his balance. The same
sketch shows that both pavements including the inclined portion
are tiled in red cement, and as shown by the photograph. Exhibit
A, the lines of the tilings are continuous.

It would therefore be difficult for a pedestrian to see the
inclination especially where there are plenty of persons in the
terrace as was the situation when plaintiff fell down. There was
no warning sign to direct one’s attention to the change in the

Art. 2176

167

elevation of the floorings.’’ (Civil Aeronautics Administration vs.
Court of Appeals, 167 SCRA 28 [1988].)

3. The driver of a jeep did not stop upon reaching a railroad crossing
and a collision occurred between the jeep and a train notwithstanding
that it blew the siren while still 300 meters away.

Facts: According to two witnesses, at the time of the accident,
the jeep driven by RC, husband of petitioner, slowed down before
reaching railroad crossing in Balibago, Angeles, Pampanga, but did
not stop. They heard the whistle of the train coming from Angeles
and saw the collision. The witness (TC) for the defendant-appellee,
who was at the engine at the time of the mishap, “testified that
before the locomotive, which had been previously inspected and
found to be in good condition, approached the crossing, that is,
about 300 meters away, he blew the siren and repeated it in compliance with the regulations until he saw the jeep suddenly spurt,
and that although the locomotive was running between 20 and
25 kilometers an hour and although he had applied the brakes,
the jeep was caught in the middle of the tracks.”
Issue: Was the defendant-appellee gulty of negligence?

Held: (1) No negligence could be imputed to defendant. — “This
action is predicated on negligence, the Civil Code making clear
that whoever by act or omission causes damage to another, there
being negligence, is under obligation to pay for the damage done.
Unless it could be satisfactorily shown, therefore, that defendantappellee was guilty of negligence then it could not be held liable.

The above Civil Code provision, which is reiteration of that
found in the Civil Code of Spain, formerly applicable in this jurisdiction, had been interpreted in earlier decisions. Thus, in Smith vs.
Cadwallader Gibson Lumber Co., Manresa was cited to the following
effect: “Among the questions most frequently raised and upon
which the majority of cases have been decided with respect to the
application of this liability, are those referring to the determination of the damage or prejudice, and to the fault or negligence of
the person responsible therefor. These are the two indispensable
factors in the obligations under discussion, for without damage
or prejudice there can be no liability, and although this element
is present no indemnity can be awarded unless arising from some
person’s fault or negligence.’’
(2) Concept and test of negligence. — “Negligence was defined
by us in two 1912 decisions, United States vs. Juanillo and United

168

TORTS

Art. 2176

States v. Barias Cooley’s formulation was quoted with approval in
both the Juanillo and Barias decisions. Thus: “Judge Cooley, in his
work on Torts (3rd ed.), Sec. 1324, defines negligence to be: ‘The
failure to observe for the protection of the interests of another
person that degree of care, precaution, and vigilance which the
circumstances justly demand, whereby such other person suffers
injury.’ There was likewise a reliance on Ahern vs. Oregon Telephone
Co. Thus: ‘Negligence is want of the care required by the circumstances. It is a relative or comparative, not an absolute term and
its application depends upon the situation of the parties and the
degree of care and vigilance which the circumstances reasonably
require. Where the danger is great, a high degree of care is necessary, and the failure to observe it is a want of ordinary care under
the circumstances.’
To repeat, by such a test, no negligence could be imputed
to defendant-appellee, and the action of plaintiff-appellant must
necessarily fail. The facts, being what they are, compel the conclusion that the liability sought to be fastened on defendant-appellee
had not arisen.’’

(3) Re: defense of failure to put down crossing bars and absence of
guard at gate-house. — “The first two assigned errors would make
much of the failure of the lower court to hold that the crossing
bars not having been put down and there being no guard at the
gate-house, there still was a duty on the part of Corliss to stop
his jeep to avoid a collision and that Teodorico Capili, who drove
the engine, was not qualified to do so at the time of the accident.
For one cannot just single out a circumstance and then confidently
assign to it decisive weight and significance.
Considered separately, neither of the two above errors assigned
would call for a judgment different in character. Nor would a combination of acts allegedly impressed with negligence suffice to alter
the result. The quantum of proof required still had not been met.
The alleged errors fail of their desired effect.’’

(4) Every case dependent on its facts. — “It cannot be stressed
too much that the decisive considerations are too variable, too
dependent in the last analysis upon a common sense estimate of
the situation as it presented itself to the parties for us to be able
to say that this or that element having been isolated, negligence
is shown. The factors that enter the judgment are too many and
diverse for us to imprison them in the formula sufficient of itself to
yield the correct answer to the multi-faceted problems the question
of negligence poses. Every case must be dependent on its facts.

What Justice Cardozo announced would merely emphasize
what was set forth earlier that each and every case on questions
of negligence is to be decided in accordance with the peculiar
circumstances that present themselves. There can be no hard and
fast rule. There must be that observance of the degree of care,
precaution, and vigilance which the situation demands. Thus,
defendant-appellee acted. It is undeniable then that no negligence
can rightfully be imputed to it.’’ (Corliss vs. Manila Railroad Co.,

4. Relying on his faculties of sight and hearing, and believing that
he had no reason to anticipate any impending danger of a collision with
an approaching train, petitioner did not make a full stop at a railroad
crossing.

Facts: At about 11 o’clock in the evening, petitioners VC and
his wife were in their car with VC at the wheel. Upon reaching
the railroad tracks, finding that the level crossing bar was raised
and seeing that there was no flashing red light, and hearing no
whistle from any coming train, Cusi merely slackened his speed
and proceeded to cross the tracks. At the same time, a train bound
for Lucena traversed the crossing, resulting in a collision between
the two. The impact threw the plaintiffs-appellees out of their car
which was smashed. The wife underwent three operations for the
injuries she suffered.
Undisputably, the warning devices installed at the railroad
crossing were manually operated; there were only 2 shifts of guards
provided for the operation thereof — one, the 7:00 A.M. to 3:00
P.M. shift, and the other, the 3:00 P.M. to 11:00 P.M. shift. On the
night of the accident, the train for Lucena was on an unscheduled
trip after 11:00 P.M. During that precise hour, the warning devices
were not operating for no one attended to them.
Also, as observed by the lower court, the locomotive driver
did not blow his whistle, thus: “. . . he simply sped on without
taking an extra precaution of blowing his whistle from a distance
of 50 to 10 meters from the crossing. That the train was running
at full speed is attested to by the fact that notwithstanding the

170

TORTS

Art. 2176

application of the emergency brakes, the train did not stop until
it reached a distance of around 100 meters.”
Issue: Was defendant guilty of negligence as found by the
trial court?

Held: (1) Question of negligence one of fact. — “The question of
negligence being one of fact, the lower court’s finding of negligence
on the part of the defendant-appellant deserves serious consideration by the Court. It commands great respect and weight, the
reason being that the trial judge, having the advantage of hearing
the parties testify and of observing their demeanor on the witness
stand, is better situated to make conclusions of facts.

Thus, it has been the standing practice of appellate courts to
accord lower court’s judgments the presumption of correctness.
And unless it can be shown that error or errors, substantial in
character, be shown in the conclusion arrived at, or that there
was abuse in judicial scrutiny, We are bound by their judgments.’’
(2) Gross negligence of defendant proximate cause of the collision.
— “The facts assessed together show the inadequacy, nay, the
absence, of precautions taken by the defendant-appellant to warn
the travelling public of the impending danger. It is clear to Us
that as the signal devices were wholly manually-operated, there
was an urgent need for a flagman or guard to man the crossing
at all times. As it was, the crossing was left unattended to after
eleven o’clock every night and on the night of the accident. We
cannot in all reason justify or condone the act of the defendantappellant allowing the subject locomotive to travel through the
unattended crossing with inoperative signal devices, but without
sending any of its employees to operate said signal devices so as
to warn oncoming motorists of the approach of one of its locomotives. It is not surprising therefore that the inoperation of the
warning devices created a situation which was misunderstood by
the riding public to mean safe passage.

Jurisprudence recognizes that if warning devices are installed
in railroad crossings, the travelling public has the right to rely
on such warning devices to put them on their guard and take
the necessary precautions before crossing the tracks. A need,
therefore, exists for the railroad company to use reasonable care
to keep such devices in good condition and in working order, or
to give notice that they are not operating, since if such a signal
is misunderstood it is a menace.
Thus, it has been held that if a railroad company maintains

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

171

a signalling device at a crossing to give warning of the approach
of a train, the failure of the device to operate is generally held
to be evidence of negligence, which maybe considered with all
the circumstances of the case in determining whether the railroad
company was negligent as a matter of fact.

The set of circumstances surrounding the collision subject of
this case is very much similar to that of Lilius vs. Manila Railroad
Company, 59 Phil. 758 (1934), where this Court upheld the lower
court’s finding of negligence on the part of defendant locomotive
company upon the following facts —
‘. . . on the part of the defendant company, for not having
had on that occasion any semaphore at the crossing at Dayap,
to serve as a warning to passersby of its existence in order
that they might take the necessary precautions before crossing
the railroad; and, on the part of its employees — the flagman
and switchman, for not having remained at his post at the
crossing in question to warn passersby of the approaching
train; the station master, for failure to send the said flagman
and switchman to his post on time; and the engineer, for not
having taken the necessary precautions to avoid an accident,
in view of the absence of said flagman and switchman, by
slackening his speed and continuously ringing the bell and
blowing the whistle before arriving at the crossing.’’’

(3) Rule when traversing any “through streets’’ or railroad crossing. — “Defendant-appellant rests its defense mainly on Section
56(a) of the Motor Vehicle Law. Thus:

‘Section 56(a) — Traversing through streets and railroad
crossing, etc. — All vehicles moving on the public highways
shall be brought to a full stop before traversing any ‘through
street’ or railroad crossing. Whenever any such ‘through street’
or crossing is so designated and signposted, it shall be unlawful for the driver of any vehicle to fail to stop within twenty
meters but not less than two and one-half meters from such
‘through street’ or railroad crossing.’

The defense presupposes that the failure of plaintiffs-appellees
to stop before proceeding to traverse the crossing constitutes
contributory negligence, thereby precluding them from recovering
indemnity for their injuries and damages.
The candor of defendant-appellant in interposing such a defense is doubtful. As seemingly observed by the lower court, the
defense, through inadvertence or deliberateness, did not pursue

172

TORTS

Art. 2176

further the excepting clause of the same section, thus to go on:

‘Provided, however, that the driver of a passenger automobile or motorcycle may instead of coming to a full stop, slow
down to not more than ten kilometers per hour whenever it
is apparent that no hazard exists.’’’

(4) Petitioner had exercised all the necessary precautions. —
“Plaintiff-appellee Victorino Cusi had exercised all the necessary
precautions required of him as to avoid injury to himself and to
others. We find no need for him to have made a full stop; relying on his faculties of sight and hearing, Victorino Cusi had no
reason to anticipate the impending danger.
The record shows that the spouses Cusi previously knew
of the existence of the railroad crossing, having stopped at the
guardhouse to ask for directions before proceeding to the party.
At the crossing, they found the level bar raised, no warning lights
flashing nor warning bells ringing, nor whistle from an oncoming
train. They safely traversed the crossing. On their return home, the
situation at the crossing did not in the least change, except for the
absence of the guard or flagman. Hence, on the same impression
that the crossing was safe for passage as before, plaintiff-appellee
Victorino Cusi merely slackened his speed and proceeded to cross
the tracks, driving at the proper rate of speed for going over
railroad crossings.’’
(5) Petitioner not guilty of any contributory negligence. — “Had
defendant-appellant been successful in establishing that its locomotive driver blew his whistle to warn motorists of his approach
to compensate for the absence of the warning signals, and that
Victorino Cusi, instead of stopping or slackening his speed, proceeded with reckless speed and regardless of possible or threatened
danger, then We would have been put in doubt as to the degree
of prudence exercised by him and would have, in all probability,
declared him negligent. But as the contrary was established, we
remain convinced that Victorino Cusi had not, through his own
negligence, contributed to the accident so as to deny him damages from the defendant-appellant.’’ (Cusi vs. Philippine National
Railways, 90 SCRA 357 [1979].)

Brief rulings on quasi-delict.
In the following cases, the defendants were held liable for
quasi-delict.

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

173

(1) Where a confidential employee, knowing that his principal was negotiating with the owner of a land for the purchase
of the same, surreptiously succeeded in buying it in the name
of his wife. (Sing Juco vs. Sunyantong, 43 Phil. 589 [1922].)

(2) Where defendant constructed a dam closing the entrance
of Bocaue River, which is of public ownership causing damages
to the plaintiff. He had no right whatever to construct the said
dam. (Samson vs. Dionisio, 11 Phil. 538 [1908].)
(3) Where plaintiff booked in an airline for a flight to leave
at 2:20 p.m., arrived at the airport at 1:50 p.m. but was not able
to check in because her seat was given to another passenger.
(Korean Air Lines Co., Ltd. vs. Court of Appeals, 154 SCRA 211
[1987].)

(4) Where plaintiff, though intoxicated, was driving a calesa
whose wheels struck the streetcar railroad tracks which were
above the level of the street, as a result of which the horse
stumbled and fell, thus injuring himself. Mere intoxication is
not negligence; it does not establish a want of ordinary care. If
a person’s conduct is characterized by a proper degree of care
it is immaterial whether he is drunk or sober. Plaintiff was
awarded damage. (Wright vs. Manila Electric Railroad & Light
Co., 828 Phil. 122 [1914].)
(5) Where plaintiff was wrongfully arrested for a contractual
debt and he stayed 21 days in prison before he was released
on habeas corpus. (Ganaway vs. Fidelity & Surety Co., Inc., 45
Phil. 406 [1924]; Ganaway vs. Quillen, 42 Phil. 805 [1922].)
(6) Where a fire occurred in a gasoline station while the
gasoline from a tank truck was being hosed into the underground storage and the fire spread burning several neighboring
houses. Fire is not considered a fortuitous event (see Art. 1278.)
as it arises invariably from some act of man. (Africa vs. Calex
[Phils.], Inc., 16 SCRA 448 [1966].)

(7) Where a day before the accident, the attention of the
defendant’s foreman was called by one of the laborers to the
defect in the track but the same was not repaired. The track
sagged, the tie broke, the rails lid off and caught the legs of the
plaintiff, one of eight (8) laborers employed by the defendant

174

company to transport rails from a barge to its yard. “It was
the duty of the defendant to maintain the track in reasonably
sound condition, so as to protect the workmen from unnecessary danger. It failed in its duty, otherwise the accident could
not have occurred.’’ (Rakes vs. Atlantic Gulf, 7 Phil. 359 [1907].)

(8) Where a child who was walking a short distance in
advance of her mother along a public street, was frightened by
an automobile that suddenly appeared from the opposite direction, and she turned and fell into a street gutter or ditch where
hot water coming from defendant’s electric and ice plant was
allowed to flow, the defendant was held liable for her death
for causing hot water to flow to the street which endangered
the lives of passers-by who may fall into the gutter. (Bernal vs.
House Tacloban Electric & Ice Plant, 54 Phil. 327 [1930].)
(9) Where the bus driver, who was trying to beat the red
light, hit the victim as the latter started to cross after waiting
for the traffic light to change. (Metro Manila Transit Corp. vs.
Court of Appeals, 386 SCRA 126 [2002].)

(10) While it is true that the law does not draw an inference
of negligence from the mere showing that there was a collision
between a man and an automobile on a public street, but that
negligence must be proved, nevertheless, where it appeared
that at the time the injury was produced, the injured person
was where he had a right to be, that the automobile was being
driven on the wrong side, that no warning signal was given of
its approach, and that it could not be stopped until it was too
late, it could be held that there was a presumption of negligence
on the part of the driver, and that the burden of proof was on
him to establish that the accident occurred through other causes
than his own negligence. (U.S. vs. Crame, 30 Phil. 2 [1915].)
(11) The driver of an overtaking vehicle must see to it that
the conditions are such that an attempt to pass is reasonably
safe and prudent, and in passing must exercise reasonable care.
In the absence of clear evidence of negligence on the part of the
operator of the overtaken vehicle, the courts are inclined to put
the blame for an accident occurring while a passage is being
attempted, on the driver of the overtaking vehicle. (People vs.

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

175

Bolason, [CA] 53 O.G. 4158.)

(12) The driver of a vehicle might be held liable for any
damage he may cause even if he was not speeding, if the facts
and circumstances surrounding the particular time and place
showed that he was operating his vehicle recklessly or at a rate
of speed greater than is reasonable and proper under existing
conditions. Speed limits are only maxima not to be exceeded,
and driving at a lesser speed is no guaranty of due care. The
motorist must not only keep within the speed limit but must
observe due care; and the latter is always determined by the
surrounding circumstances of person, time and place. Moreover, speed limit is set for optimum conditions; where they do
not obtain, and the light is uncertain, or the road slippery, the
speed limit is no longer a test of diligence. (U.S. vs. Aligon, 43
Phil. 644 [1922].)

(13) Where a bank in coordination with the sheriff, caused
the annotation of notice of levy in respondent’s title, despite
its knowledge that the property was owned by the respondent
and his wife, who were not privies to the loan availment of a
corporation with the bank nor parties-defendants in the civil
case filed by said bank against the corporation. (United Coconut
Planters Bank vs. Ramos, 415 SCRA 596 [2003].)

(14) Where the defendant sheriff, disregarding the claim of
plaintiff’s attorney-in-fact in an affidavit filed with the sheriff,
that the property levied upon by him under a writ of attachment,
belonged to plaintiff and not to the defendants in a civil case,
refused to lift the attachment as a result of which the plaintiff
was deprived of the possession of said properties for about 75
days, and the plaintiff proved during the trial that the attached
properties belonged to him. (Uy Pioco vs. Osmeña, 9 Phil. 299
[1907]; Ching vs. Court of Appeals, 423 SCRA 356 [2004].)
In the the cases below, there was no quasi-delict committed.
(1) Where there was sexual intercourse between a man and
a woman under a promise of marriage, but there was no seduction, because the woman acted voluntarily. (Batarra vs. Marcos,
7 Phil. 156 [1906].)
(2) Where a bank acted in good faith in extending a loan

176

TORTS

Art. 2176

to a party which was used for an illegal purpose. “The doing
of an act which in itself is perfectly lawful will not render one
liable as for tort, simply because the unintended effect of such
act is to enable or assist another person to do or accomplish
a wrong.’’ (Bacolod-Murcia Milling Co., Inc. vs. First Farmers
Milling Co., Inc., 103 SCRA 436 [1981].)

(3) Where a caretaker of carabaos was gored to death by
one of them, for he was hired to take care of them and it was
his business to prevent them from causing injury or damage
to anyone, including himself, unless it could be shown that
there was fault or negligence on the part of the owner of the
carabaos. (Afialda vs. Hisole, 85 Phil. 67 [1949].)

(4) Where there is sufficient evidence to show that the defendant has taken all necessary precautions to avoid danger to
the lives of its patrons or prevent accident which may cause their
death, the swimming pools being provided with the necessary
accessories, tools and equipment, lifeguards, security guards,
and a male nurse, and when the body of the 14-year old son of
the plaintiff was retrieved defendant’s employees did everything
possible to bring him back to life. (Ong vs. Metropolitan Water
District, 104 Phil. 397 [1958].)
(5) Where the driver, by a sudden act of negligence, and
without the owner who was in the car, having a reasonable
opportunity to prevent the act or its continuance, injures a
person, the owner is not responsible, either civilly or criminally
therefor. (Chapman vs. Underwood, 27 Phil. 374 [1914]; Caedo
vs. Yu Khe Thai, 26 SCRA 410 [1968].)

(6) The rules regarding the duties of persons driving vehicles
or engines capable of causing injury, or even death, through
negligent operation, are predicated upon the assumption that a
corresponding degree of care is exercised by the person injured.
If the pedestrian be himself negligent, and his negligence was the
true cause of the accident, he would be barred from recovering
anything from the owner or the operator of the vehicle. It is the
duty of every person crossing a railroad track, for instance, to
use ordinary care and diligence to determine the proximity of
a train before attempting to cross. (Yamaha vs. Manila Railroad

Art. 2176

QUASI-DELICTS

177

Co., 33 Phil. 8 [1915].)

(7) Where a car collided with a train at a railroad crossing
at night when the gate of the crossing was not lowered (but
was lowered during the daytime) and there was a notice that
it was a railroad crossing, the contributory negligence of the
driver cannot be imputed to the passenger of the car who has
no control over him in the management of the car and with
whom he sustains no relation of employer and employee. The
employer was ordered to pay damages to the passenger. (Junio
vs. Manila Railroad Co., 58 Phil. 176 [1933].)
Art. 2177. Responsibility for fault or negligence
under the preceding article is entirely separate and
distinct from the civil liability arising from negligence
under the Penal Code. But the plaintiff cannot recover damages twice for the same act or omission
of the defendant. (n)
Crime or delict distinguished
from quasi-delict.
The following are the distinctions:

(1) In crime or delict, there is criminal or malicious intent
or criminal negligence, while in quasi-delict, there is only negligence;
(2) Crime affects public interest, while quasi-delict concerns
private interest or concern;

(3) In crime, there are generally two liabilities: criminal and
civil, while in quasi-delict, there is only civil liability;

(4) In crime or delict, the purpose is punishment or correction, while in quasi-delict, indemnification of the offended
party;

(5) Criminal liability can not be compromised, while the
liability for quasi-delict can be compromised as any other civil
liability;

(6) In crime, the guilt of the accused must be proved beyond
reasonable doubt, while in quasi-delict, the fault or negligence
of the defendant need only be proved by preponderance of

178

TORTS

Art. 2177

evidence; and

(7) In crime, the liability of the person responsible for the
author of the negligent act or omission is subsidiary, while in
quasi-delict, it is direct and primary. (see Art. 2180.)

Delicts are not as broad as quasi-delicts because the former
are punished only if there is a penal law clearly covering them,
while the latter include all acts in which any kind of fault or
negligence intervenes. But not all violations of the penal laws
produce civil responsibility, such as begging in violation of ordinances, violation of gambling laws, and infraction of traffic
rules when no injury or damage is caused. (Barredo vs. Garcia,
73 Phil. 607 [1942].)
Institution of criminal and/or civil
actions.

(1) Civil action for quasi-delict not precluded by acquittal of accused. — Criminal negligence (culpa criminal) is a violation of
criminal law, while civil negligence (culpa aquiliana) is a distinct
and independent negligence, entirely apart from a delict or
crime. For this reason, acquittal from an accusation of criminal
negligence whether based on reasonable doubt or not is not bar
to a subsequent civil action, not for civil liability arising from
criminal negligence but for damages due to a quasi-delict or
culpa-aquiliana. Article 2177, however, forestalls a double recovery.
(Report of the Code Commission, p. 162.)
Articles 102 and 103 of the Revised Penal Code have not
been repealed by Article 2177 which expressly recognizes civil
liability arising from negligence under the Revised Penal Code
provided the plaintiff may not recover twice for the same negligence. (Manalo vs. Robles Transportation Co., Inc., 99 Phil.
729 [1956].)

(2) Choice of action to file given to injured party. — In fine, if
the fault or negligence is purely civil, the action for damage
can only be based on quasi-delict (or breach of contract). If it
is also criminal, the injured party has the option to file:
(a) a criminal action in which case the civil action for the
recovery of civil liability arising from the offense is deemed
impliedly instituted or

Art. 2177

QUASI-DELICTS

179

(b) to maintain a separate civil action to recover damages
on the theory of quasi-delict and not based on the criminal
liability of the defendant. (Chap. 10.)

There is no obligation on the part of the injured party to
see to it that the defendant is criminally prosecuted before he
may be held civilly liable nor is such prosecution indispensable.
(3) Actions separate and independent. — Since responsibility
for fault or negligence for quasi-delict “is entirety separate and
distinct from the civil liability arising from negligence under
the Penal Code,’’ the separate civil action shall proceed independently of the criminal prosecution, and notwithstanding the
pendency or the result of the latter. (see Arts. 29-34, Chap. 4.)

(4) Causes of action not identical. — Both cases, one criminal
and the other civil, may be filed simultaneously or successively
as there is no identity of causes of action between them; and,
therefore, a decision rendered in one is not necessarily res judicata in the other.

While Article 33 (Chap. 4.) makes no mention of negligence,
Article 2177 speaks unequivocally of negligence or culpa aquiliana
and authorizes the filing of a separate and distinct civil action
based on quasi-delict independently of and notwithstanding the
pendency of the criminal action against the offender. (Batangas
Laguna Tayabas Bus Company vs. Court of Appeals, 64 SCRA
427 [1975].)
Recovery of damages twice for the same
act or omission prohibited.
The same negligent act or omission causing damage may
produce civil liability arising from a crime under Article 100 of
the Revised Penal Code (Chap. 10.) or create an action for quasidelict under Article 2176. (see Barredo vs. Garcia and Almario,
73 Phil. 607 [1942]; see Elcano vs. Hill, 77 SCRA 98 [1977].) The
Revised Penal Code in Article 365 punishes not only reckless
but also simple negligence.
Under Article 1157, quasi-delict and an act or omission
punishable by law are two different sources of obligations. Inasmuch as civil liability co-exists with criminal responsibility in

180

TORTS

Art. 2177

negligence cases, the offended party has the option between an
action for enforcement of civil liability based on culpa criminal
under Article 100 of the Revised Penal Code and an action for
recovery of damages based on culpa aquiliana under Article
2177.13 (see Art. 1161.)

These two cases of action (ex delicto or quasi-delicto) may be
availed of subject to the caveat that the offended party cannot
recover twice for the same act or omission or under both causes.
Since these two (2) civil liabilities are distinct and independent
of each other, the failure to recover in one will not necessarily
preclude recovery in the other. (Equitable Leasing Corporation
vs. Suyom, 388 SCRA 445 [2002]; People vs. Billaber, 421 SCRA
27 [2004].)
Art. 2178. The provisions of Articles 1172 to 1174
are also applicable to a quasi-delict. (n)
Application of provisions on contractual fault
or negligence to quasi-delict.

Obligations arising from contracts and quasi-delicts are
governed by special provisions or rules specifically pertaining
to one but not to the other. By Article 2178, the provisions of
Articles 1172, 1173, and 1174 are made applicable to both kinds
of obligations.

Fault or negligence, whether simple or reckless, causing
damage to another and whether producing a breach of contract,
or giving rise to civil liability between parties not connected
by any legal tie, or resulting in the commission of a crime, is
characterized as essentially the failure to exercise or observe
that degree of care and diligence required of a person under
the circumstances. Thus, the existence of negligence in a given
case may create two or more causes of action, that is, the same
act or omission may create an action for culpa contractual or
culpa aquiliana under the Civil Code, or culpa criminal under the
Revised Penal Code. (Chap. 10.)
(Neplum, Inc. vs. Orbeso, 170 SCAD 635, 384 SCRA 466 [2002]; Casupanan vs. Laroya, 164
SCAD 660, 388 SCRA 28 [2002]; Cancio, Jr. vs. Isip, 391 SCRA 393 [2002].)

Examples:

(1) If S entered into a contract of sale with B to deliver
a specific horse on a certain day and the horse died through
the negligence of S before delivery, S is liable for damages to
B for having failed to fulfill a pre-existing obligation because
of his negligence. This is culpa contractual. The contract may
be either express or implied.

(2) Assume now, that the horse belongs to and is in the
possession of B. The negligence of S which results in the
death of the horse is culpa aquiliana. In this case, there is
no pre-existing contractual relation between S and B. The
negligence itself is the source of liability. (Art. 1157[5].)
(3) A crime can be committed by negligence. If B wants,
he can bring an action for culpa criminal (damage to property
through simple or reckless imprudence). Here, the crime
is the source of the obligation of S to pay damages. (Arts.
1157[4], 1161.)

But B cannot recover damages twice for the same act or
omission of S. In other words, responsibility for quasi-delict
is not demandable together with the civil liability arising
from a criminal offense. (Art. 2177.)
Responsibility arising from negligence
demandable.
Article 1172 provides:
“Responsibility arising from negligence in the performance of every kind of obligation is also demandable, but
such liability may be regulated by the courts, according to
the circumstances. (1103)’’
In the performance of every kind of obligation, the debtor
is also liable for damages resulting from his negligence or
culpa. The courts, however, are given wide discretion in fixing
without any human agency, or if happening wholly or partly through human agency, an
event which under the circumstances is unusual or unexpected by the person to whom it
happens. x x x Accident and negligence are intrinsically contradictory; one cannot exist

the measure of damages. The reason is because negligence is a
question which must necessarily depend upon the circumstances
of each particular case. Moreover, negligence is not as serious
as fraud because in the case of the former, there is no deliberate intention to cause injury or damages. The courts, however,
may increase the damages.

When both the injured party and tortfeasor are negligent,
the fault of one cancels the negligence of the other. Thus, their
rights and obligations may be determined equitably. No one
shall enrich himself at the expense of another. (Rodzssen Supply,
Inc. vs. Far East Bank & Trust Co., 148 SCAD 392, 357 SCRA
618 [2001].)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASE:
Depositor entrusted its deposits with its messenger who left with
the bank teller its passbook which was given to the wrong person and
was later used in making the questioned withdrawal from the savings
account of the depositor.

Facts: L.C. Diaz, a professional partnership, opened a savings
account with Solidbank, a domestic banking corporation. Through
its cashier, M. Macaraya, L.C. Diaz filled up a savings (cash) deposit
ship for P990 and a savings (check) deposit for P50. Macaraya
instructed its messenger, L. Calapre, to deposit the money with
Solidbank and also gave him the Solidbank passbook.
The bank teller No. 6 acknowledged reeipt of the deposit by
returning to Calapre the duplicate copies of the two deposit slips.
Teller No. 6 stamped the deposit slips with the words “DUPLICATE’’ and “SAVING TELLER 6 SOLIDBANK HEAD OFFICE.’’
Since the transaction took time and Calapre had to make another
deposit for L.C. Diaz with Allied Bank, he left the passbook with
Solidbank. Calapre then went to Allied Bank. When Calapre returned to Solidbank to retrieve the passbook, Teller No. 6 informed
him that “somebody got the passbook.’’ Calapre went back to L.C.
Diaz and reported the incident to Macaraya.

Macaraya immediately prepared a deposit slip in duplicate
coples with a check of P200,000. Macaraya, together with Calapre,
went to Solidbank and presented to Teller No. 6 the deposit slip
and check. The teller stamped the words “DUPLICATE’’ and “SAVING TELLER 6 SOLIDBANK HEAD OFFICE’’ on the duplicate

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

183

copy of the deposit slip. When Macaraya asked for the passbook,
Teller No. 6 told Macaraya that someone got the passbook but
she could not remember to whom she gave the passbook. When
Macaraya asked Teller No. 6 if Calapre got the passbook, Teller No.
6 answered that someone shorter than Calapre got the passbook.
Calapre was then standing beside Macaraya.
L.C. Diaz, through its Chief Executive Officer, called up Solidbank to stop any transaction using the same passbook until L.C.
Diaz could open a new account. On the same day, Diaz formally
wrote Solidbank to make the same request. It was also on the same
day that Diaz learned of the unauthorized withdrawal the day
before of of P300,000 from its savings account. The withdrawal slip
for the P300,000 bore the signatures of the authorized signatories
of Diaz, namely, Diaz and RM. The signatories, however, denied
signing the withdrawal slip. A certain NT received the P300,000.
Through its counsel, L.C. Diaz demanded from Solidbank the
return of its money, but the latter refused.

Solidbank seeks the review of the decision of the Court of Appeals ordering it to pay L.C. Diaz P300,000 plus interest, P20,000
exemplary damages, P20,000 as attorney’s fees, and costs of the suit.
Issue: Is Solidbank liable for beach of contract due to negligence or culpa contractual?

Held: Yes. (1) Debtor-creditor relationship between bank and its
depositor. — “The contract between the bank and its depositor is
governed by the provisions of the Civil Code on simple loan. Article 1980 of the Civil Code expressly provides that ‘x x x savings
x x x deposits of money in banks and similar institutions shall
be governed by the provisions concerning simple loan.’ There is
a debtor-creditor relationship between the bank and its depositor. The bank is the debtor and the depositor is the creditor. The
depositor lends the bank money and the bank agrees to pay the
depositor on demand.
The savings deposit agreement between the bank and the
depositor is the contract that determines the rights and obligations of the parties.’’

(2) Fiduciary nature of banking. — “The law imposes on banks
high standards in view of the fiduciary nature of banking. Section
2 of Republic Act No. 8791 which took effect on 13 June 2000,
declares that the State recognizes the ‘fiduciary nature of banking
that requires high standards of integrity and performance.’ This
new provision in the general banking law, introduced in 2000, is

184

TORTS

Art. 2178

a statutory affirmation of Supreme Court decisions, starting with
the 1990 case of Simex International v. Court of Appeals (183 SCRA
360 [1990].), holding that ‘the bank is under obligation to treat the
accounts of its depositors with meticulous care, always having in
mind the fiduciary nature of their relationship.’’’
(3) Higher degree of diligence required of banks. — “This fiduciary relationship means that the bank’s obligation to observe ‘high
standards of integrity and performance’ is deemed written into
every deposit agreement between a bank and its depositor. The
fiduciary nature of banking requires banks to assume a degree
of diligence higher than that of a good father of a family Article
1172 of the Civil Code states that the degree of diligence required
of an obligor is that prescribed by law or contract, and absent,
such stipulation then the diligence of a good father of a family.

Section 2 of RA 8791 prescribes the statutory diligence required
from banks — that banks must observe ‘high standards of integrity
and performance’ in servicing their depositors. Although RA 8791
took effect almost nine years after the authorized withdrawal of
the P300,000 from L.C. Diaz’s savings account, jurisprudence at
the time of the withdrawal already imposed on banks the same
high standard of diligence required under RA No. 8791.
However, the fiduciary nature of a bank-depositor relationship
does not convert the contract between the bank and its depositors from a simple loan to a trust agreement, whether express
or implied. Failure by the bank to pay the depositor is failure to
pay a simple loan, and not a breach of trust. The law simply imposes on the bank a higher standard of integrity and performance
in complying with its obligations under the contract of simple
loan, beyond those required of non-bank debtors under a similar
contract of simple loan.
The fiduciary nature of banking does not convert a simple
loan into a trust agreement because banks do not accept deposits
to enrich depositors but to earn money for themselves. The law
allows banks to offer the lowest possible interest rate to depositors while charging the highest possible interest rate on their own
borrowers. The interest spread or differential belongs to the bank
and not to the depositors who are not cestui que trust of banks. If
depositors are cestui que trust of banks, then the interest spread
or income belongs to the depositors, a situation that Congress
certainly did not intend in enacting Section 2 of RA 8791.’’

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

185

(4) Diligence in safeguarding depositor’s passbook. — “Article
1172 of the Civil Code provides that “responsibility arising from
negligence in the performance of every kind of obligation is demandable.’’ For breach of the savings deposit agreement due to
negligence, or culpa cotnractual, the bank is liable to its depositor.
Calapre left the passbook with Solidbank because the ‘transaction took time’ and he had to go to Allied Bank for another
transaction. The passbook was still in the hands of the employees
of Solidbank for the processing of the deposit when Calapre left
Solidbank. Solidbank’s rules on savings account require that the
‘deposit book should be carefully guarded by the depositor and
kept under lock and key, if possible.’ When the passbook is in
the possession of Solidbank’s tellers during withdrawals, the law
imposes on Solidbank and its tellers an even higher degree of
diligence in safeguarding the passbook.

Likewise, Solidbank’s tellers must exercise a high degree of
diligence in insuring that they return the passbook only to the
depositor or his authorized representative. The tellers know, or
should know, that the rules on savings account provide that any
person in possession of the passbook is presumptively its owner.
If the tellers give the passbook to the wrong person, they would
be clothing that person presumptive ownership of the passbook,
facilitating unauthorized withdrawals by that person. For failing
to return the passbook to Calapre, the authorized representative
of L.C. Diaz, Solidbank and Teller No. 6 presumptively failed
to observe such high degree of diligence in safeguarding the
passbook, and in insuring its return to the party authorized to
receive the same.’’

(5) Presumption of fault on the part of Soidbank. — “In culpa
contractual, once the plaintiff proves a breach of contract, there is
a presumption that the defendant was at fault or negligent. The
burden is on the defendant to prove that he was not at fault or
negligent. In contrast, in culpa aquiliana the plaintiff has the burden
of proving that the defendant was negligent. In the present case,
L.C. Diaz has established that Solidbank breached its contractual
obligation to return the passbook only to the authorized representative of L.C. Diaz. There is thus a presumption that Solidbank was
at fault and its teller was negligent in not returning the passbook
to Calapre. The burden was on Solidbank to prove that there was
no negligence on its part or its employees.
Solidbank failed to discharge its burden. Solidbank did not
present to the trial court Teller No. 6, the teller with whom Calapre

186

TORTS

Art. 2178

left the passbook and who was supposed to return the passbook
to him. The record does not indicate that Teller No. 6 verified the
identity of the person who retrieved the passbook. Solidbank also
failed to adduce in evidence its standard procedure in verifying
the identity of the person retrieving the passbook, if there is such
a procedure, and that Teller No. 6 implemented this procedure
in the present case.’’
(6) Solidbank bound by negligence of its employee. — “Solidbank
is bound by the negligence of its employees under the principle
of respondeat superior or command responsibility. The defense of
exercising the required diligence in the selection and supervision
of employees is not a complete defense in culpa contractual, unlike
in culpa aquiliana.
The bank must not only exercise ‘high standards of integrity
and performance,’ it must also insure that its employees do likewise
because this is the only way to insure that the bank will comply
with its fiduciary duty. Solidbank failed to present the teller who
had the duty to return to Calapre the passbook, and thus failed
to prove that this teller exercised the ‘high standards of integrity
and performance’ required of Solidbank’s employees.’’

(7) Proximate cause of the unauthorized withdrawal. — “Proximate
cause is that cause which, in natural and continuous sequence,
unbroken by any efficient intervening cause, produces the injury
and without which the result would not have occurred. Proximate cause is determined by the facts of each case upon mixed
considerations of logic, common sense, policy and precedent.

L.C. Diaz was not at fault that the passbook landed in the
hands of the impostor. Solidbank was in possession of the passbook while it was processing the deposit. After completion of the
transaction, Solidbank had the contractual obligation to return the
passbook only to Calapre, the authorized representative of L.C.
Diaz. Solidbank failed to fulfill its contractual obligation because
it gave the passbook to another person.
Solidbank’s failure to return the passbook to Calapre made
possible the withdrawal of the P300,000 by the impostor who took
possession of the passbook. Under Solidbank’s rules on savings
account, mere possession of the passbook raises the presumption
of ownership. It was the negligent act of Solid-bank’s Teller No. 6
that gave the impostor presumptive owner-ship of the passbook.
Had the passbook not fallen into the hands of the impostor, the
loss of P30,000 would not have happened. Thus, the proximate

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

187

cause of the unauthorized withdrawal was Solidban’s negligence
in not returning the passbook to Calapre.

We do not subscribe to the appellate court’s theory that the
proximate cause of the unauthorized withdrawal was the teller’s
failure to call up L.C. Diaz to verify the withdrawal. Solidbank did
not have the duty to call up L.C. Diaz to confirm the withdrawal.
There is no arrangement between Solidbank and L.C. Diaz to
this effect. Even the agreement between Solidbank and L.C. Diaz
pertaining to measures that the parties must observe whenever
withdrawals of large amounts are made does not direct Solidbank
to call up L.C. Diaz.
There is no law mandating banks to call up their clients
whenever their representatives withdraw significant amounts from
their accounts. L.C. Diaz therefore had the burden to prove that it
is the usual practice of Solidbank to call up its clients to verify a
withdrawal of a large amount of money. L.D. Diaz failed to do so.’’
(8) Doctrine of last clear not applicable. — “The doctrine of last
clear chance states that where both parties are negligent but the
negligent act of one is appreciably later than that of the other,
or where it is impossible to determine whose fault or negligence
caused the loss, the one who had the last clear opportunity to
avoid the loss but failed to do so, is chargeable with the loss.
Stated differently, the antecedent negligence of the plaintiff does
not preclude him from recovering damages caused by the supervening negligence of the defendant, who had the last fair chance
to prevent the impending harm by the exercise of due diligence.

We do not apply the doctrine of last clear chance to the present
case. Solidbank is liable for breach of contract due to negligence
in the performance of its contractual obligation to L.C. Diaz.
This is a case of culpa contractual, where neither the contributory
negligence of the plaintiff nor his last clear chance to avoid the
loss, would exonerate the defendant from liability. Such contributory negligence or last clear chance by the plaintiff merely serves
to reduce the recovery of damages by the plaintiff but does not
exculpate the defendant from his breach of contract.’’
(9) Mitigated damages. — “Under Article 1172, ‘liability [for
culpa contractual] may be regulated by the courts, according to
the circumstances.’ This means that if the defendant exercised the
proper diligence in the selection and supervision of its employee,
or if the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, then the

188

TORTS

Art. 2178

courts may reduce the award of damages. In this case, L.C. Diaz
was guilty of contributory negligence in allowing a withdrawal
slip signed by its authorized signatories to fall into the hands of
an impostor. Thus, the liability of Solidbank should be reduced.

In Philippine Bank of Commerce vs. Court of Appeals, (269 SCRA
695 [1997].), where the Court held the depositor guilty of contributory negligence, we allocated the damages between the depositor
and the bank on a 40-60 ratio. Applying the same ruling to this
case, we hold that L.C. Diaz must shoulder 40% of the actual
damages awarded by the appellate court. Solidbank must pay
the other 60% of the actual damages.’’ (Consolidated Bank and Trust
Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 410 SCRA 562 [2003].)

Statutory definition of fault or negligence.
Article 1173 reads:

“The fault or negligence of the obligor consists in the
omission of that diligence which is required by the nature
of the obligation and corresponds with the circumstances of
the persons, of the time and of the place. When negligence
shows bad faith, the provisions of Articles 1171 and 2201,
paragraph 2, shall apply.
If the law or contract does not state the diligence which
is to be observed in the performance, that which is expected
of a good father of a family shall be required. (1104a)’’

(1) Fault or negligence is defined by the above provision.
(par. 1.)

(2) According to our Supreme Court, “negligence is conduct
that creates undue risk or harm to another. It is the failure to
observe for the protection of the interests of another person,
that degree of care, precaution and vigilance which the circumstances justly demand, whereby such other person suffers
injury.” (United States vs. Barrias, 23 Phil. 434 [1912], adopting
the definition given by Judge Cooley; Jarco Marketing Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 117 SCAD 818, 321 SCRA 375 [1999].)
It is “the want of care required by the circumstances.’’ (Cortes
vs. Manila Railroad Company, 27 SCRA 674 [1969]; Valenzuela
vs. Court of Appeals, 68 SCAD 113, 253 SCRA 303 [1996]; Smith
Bell Dodwell Shipping Agency Corp. vs. Borja, 169 SCAD 335,

Art. 2178

383 SCRA 341 [2002].)
Test for determining whether a person
is negligent.
(1) Reasonable care and caution expected of an ordinary prudent
person. — “The test for determining whether a person is negligent in doing an act whereby injury or damage results to the
person or property of another is this: Would a prudent man,
in the position of the person to whom negligence is attributed,
foresee harm to the person injured as a reasonable consequence
of the course about to the pursued? If so, the law imposes the
duty on the actor to refrain from that course or to take precaution against its mischievous results, and the failure two do so
constitutes negligence. Reasonable foresight of harm followed
by the ignoring of the admonition born of this provision, is the
constitutive fact of negligence.” (Picart vs. Smith, 37 Phil. 809
[1918].)

Simply stated: “Did the defendant in doing the alleged
negligent act use the reasonable care and caution which an ordinary prudent person would have used in the same situation.
If not, then he is guilty of negligence.’’ (Ibid.; Mandarin Villa,
Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 71 SCAD 255, 257 SCRA 538 [1996];
Jarco Marketing Corp. vs. Court of Appeals, supra.)
(2) No hard and fast rule for measuring degree of care. — By
such a test, it can readily be seen that there is no hard and
fast rule whereby the degree of care and vigilance required is
measured. It is dependent upon the circumstances in which a
person finds himself situated. All that the law requires is that it
is always incumbent upon a person to use that care and diligence
expected of reasonable men under similar circumstances. (Cusi
vs. Phil. National Railways, 90 SCRA 357 [1979]; see Illusorio
vs. Court of Appeals, 393 SCRA 89 [2002].)
(3) Negligence, a legal question.  ­— In other words, the existence
of negligence in a given case is not determined by reference to
the personal judgment of the actor in the situation before him. It
is the law that considers what would be reckless or negligent in
the man of ordinary intelligence and determines liability by that.

190

TORTS

Art. 2178

(Layugan vs. Intermediate Court, 107 SCRA 363 [1988].)
Factors to be considered.
Negligence is a question of fact, its existence being dependent
upon the particular circumstances of each case. In determining
the issue of negligence where loss or damage occurs, the following factors must be considered:

(1) Nature of the obligation. — e.g., smoking while carrying
materials known to be inflammable constitutes negligence;
(2) Circumstances of the person. — e.g., a guard, a man in
the prime of life, robust and healthy, sleeping while on duty
is guilty of negligence;

(3) Circumstances of time. — e.g., driving a car without
headlights at night is gross negligence but it does not by itself
constitute negligence when driving during the day; and

(4) Circumstances of the place. — e.g., driving at 60 kilometers
per hour on the highway is permissible but driving at the same
rate of speed in Quezon Boulevard, Manila, where traffic is
always heavy, is gross recklessness.
ILLUSTRATIVE CASE:
A commercial vessel, while under compulsory pilotage, caused considerable damage to the pier.

Facts: MV/PAVLODAR, owned and operated by FESC, arrived
at the Port of Manila from Canada. The vessel was assigned to
Berth 4 of the Manila International Port, as its berthing space.
Captain R Abellana was tasked by the Philippine Port Authority
to supervise the berthing of the vessel. Appellant
S Gavino
was assigned by the appellant Manila Pilots’ Association (MPA
for brevity’s sake) to conduct docking maneuvers for the safe
berthing of the vessel to Berth No. 4.
Gavino boarded the vessel at the quarantine anchorage and
stationed himself in the bridge, with the master of the vessel, V
Kavankov, beside him. After a briefing of Gavino by Kavankov of
the particulars of the vessel and its cargo, the vessel lifted anchor
from the quarantine anchorage and proceeded to the Manila International Port. The sea was calm and the wind was ideal for docking

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

191

maneuvers.

When the vessel reached the landmark (the big church by the
Tondo North Harbor) one-half mile from the pier, Gavino ordered
the engine stopped. When the vessel was already about 2,000 feet
from the pier, Gavino ordered the anchor dropped. Kavankov
relayed the orders to the crew of the vessel on the bow. The left
anchor, with two (2) shackles, were dropped. However, the anchor did not take hold as expected. The speed of the vessel did
not slacken. A commotion ensued between the crew members. A
brief conference ensued between Kavan-kov and the crew members. When Gavino inquired what was all the commotion about,
Kavankov assured Gavino that there was nothing to it.
After Gavino noticed that the anchor did not take hold, he
ordered the engines half-astern. Abellana, who was then on the
pier apron, noticed that the vessel was approaching the pier fast.
Kavankov likewise noticed that the anchor did not take hold.
Gavino thereafter gave the “full-astern” code. Before the right
anchor and additional shackles could be dropped, the bow of the
vessel rammed into the apron of the pier causing considerable
damage to the pier. The vessel sustained damage too.
The PPA filed a complaint for actual and exemplary damages
against FESC, Gavino, and the MPA.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the findings of the court a
quo ordering the defendants jointly and severally to pay the PPA
actual damages and the costs of the suit, except that it found no
employer-employee relationship existing between private respondent MPA and Gavino. Both FESC and MPA appealed the decision
of the Court of Appeals.
Issue: 1. Who should be held negligent — the master of the
ship, the harbor pilot, or both?
2.

Who should be held responsible for the resulting damages?

(1) Presumption of fault against a moving vessel that strikes a
stationary object. — “In admiralty, this presumption does more than
merely require the ship to go forward and produce some evidence
on the presumptive matter. The moving vessel must show that it
was without fault or that the collision was occasioned by the fault
of the stationary object or was the result of inevitable accident.
It has been held that such vessel must exhaust every reasonable
possibility which the circumstances admit and show that in each,
they did all that reasonable care required.

192

TORTS

Art. 2178

In the absence of sufficient proof in rebuttal, the presumption
of fault attaches to a moving vessel which collides with a fixed
object and makes a prima facie case of fault against the vessel.
Logic and experience support this presumption.’’

(2) Pilot supersedes master during pilotage. — “Under English
and American authorities, generally speaking, the pilot supersedes
the master for the time being in the command and navigation of
the ship, and his orders must be obeyed in all matters connected
with her navigation. He becomes the master pro hac vice and should
give all directions as to speed, course, stopping and reversing,
anchoring, towing and the like. And when a licensed pilot is
employed in a place where pilotage is compulsory, it is his duty
to insist on having effective control of the vessel, or to decline to
act as pilot. Under certain systems of foreign law, the pilot does
not take entire charge of the vessel, but is deemed merely the
adviser of the master, who retains command and control of the
navigation even in localities where pilotage is compulsory.
It is quite common for states and localities to provide for
compulsory pilotage, and safety laws have been enacted requiring
vessels approaching their ports, with certain exceptions, to take on
board pilots duly licensed under local law. The purpose of these
laws is to create a body of seamen thoroughly acquainted with the
harbor, to pilot vessels seeking to enter or depart, and thus protect
life and property from the dangers of navigation.’’

(3) Degree of care required of every man who offers his services
to another. — “An act may be negligent if it is done without the
competence that a reasonable person in the position of the actor would recognize as necessary to prevent it from creating an
unreasonable risk of harm to another. Those who undertake any
work calling for special skills are required not only to exercise
reasonable care in what they do but also possess a standard minimum of special knowledge and ability. Every man who offers his
services to another, and is employed, assumes to exercise in the
employment such skills he possesses, with a reasonable degree of
diligence.
In all these employments where peculiar skill is requisite, if
one offers his services he is understood as holding himself out
to the public as possessing the degree of skill commonly possessed by others in the same employment, and if his pretensions
are unfounded he commits a species of fraud on every man who
employs him in reliance on his public profession.’’

(4) Degree of care graduated according to danger. — “Furthermore,

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

193

there is an obligation on all persons to take the care which, under
ordinary circumstances of the case, a reasonable and prudent man
would take, and the omission of that care constitutes negligence.
Generally, the degree of care required is graduated according to
the danger a person or property attendant upon the activity which
the actor pursues or the instrumentality which he uses.

The greater the danger the greater the degree of care required.
What is ordinary under extraordinary of conditions is dictated by
those conditions; extraordinary risk demands extraordinary care.
Similarly, the more imminent the danger, the higher the degree
of care.

(5) Harbor pilot negligent. — “We give our imprimatur to the
bases for the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that Capt. Gavino
was indeed negligent in the performance of his duties:
‘x x x As can be gleaned from the logbook, Gavino ordered
the left anchor and two (2) shackles dropped at 8:30 o’clock
in the morning. He ordered the engines of the vessel stopped
at 8:31 o’clock. By then, Gavino must have realized that the
anchor did not hit a hard object and was not clawed so as to
reduce the momentum of the vessel. In point of fact, the vessel continued travelling towards the pier at the same speed.
Gavino failed to react. At 8:32 o’clock, the two (2) tugboats
began to push the stern part of the vessel from the port side
but the momentum of the vessel was not contained. Still,
Gavino did not react. He did not even order the other anchor
and two (2) more shackles dropped to arrest the momentum
of the vessel. Neither did he order full-astern.’

It was only at 8:34 o’clock, or four (4) minutes, after the anchor was dropped that Gavino reacted. But his reaction was even
(haphazard) because instead of arresting fully the momentum of
the vessel with the help of the tugboats, Gavino ordered merely
“half-astern”. It took Gavino another minute to order a “fullastern”. By then, it was too late. The vessel’s momentum could
no longer be arrested and, barely a minute thereafter, the bow of
the vessel hit the apron of the pier.

Patently, Gavino miscalculated. He failed to react and undertake
adequate measures to arrest fully the momentum of the vessel
after the anchor failed to claw to the seabed. When he reacted,
the same was even (haphazard). Gavino failed to reckon the bulk
of the vessel, its size and its cargo. He erroneously believed that
only one (1) anchor would suffice and even when the anchor failed

194

TORTS

Art. 2178

to claw into the seabed or against a hard object in the seabed,
Gavino failed to order the other anchor dropped immediately.
His claim that the anchor was dropped when the vessel was
only 1,000 feet from the pier is but a belated attempt to extricate
himself from the quagmire of his own insouciance and negligence.
In sum, then, Appellants’ claim that the incident was caused by
“force majeure” is barren of factual basis. x x x’’

(6) Master of the ship also negligent. — “The negligence on the
part of Capt. Gavino is evident; but Capt. Kabankov is no less
responsible for the allision. His unconcerned lethargy as master of
the ship in the face of troublous exigence constitutes negligence.

While it is indubitable that in exercising his functions a pilot
is in sole command of the ship and supersedes the master for the
time being in the command and navigation of a ship and that
he becomes master pro hac vice of a vessel piloted by him, there
is overwhelming authority to the effect that the master does not
surrender his vessel to the pilot and the pilot is not the master.
The master is still in command of the vessel notwithstanding the
presence of a pilot. There are occasions when the master may and
should interfere and even displace the pilot, as when the pilot is
obviously incompetent or intoxicated and the circumstances may
require the master to displace a compulsory pilot because of incompetency or physical incapacity. If, however, the master does
not observe that a compulsory pilot is incompetent or physically
incapacitated, the master is justified in relying on the pilot, but
not blindly.
The master is not wholly absolved from his duties while a pilot
is on board his vessel, and may advise with or offer suggestions
to him. He is still in command of the vessel, except so far as her
navigation is concerned, and must cause the ordinary work of the
vessel to be properly carried on and the usual precaution taken.
Thus, in particular, he is bound to see that there is sufficient watch
on deck, and that the men are attentive to their duties, also that
engines are stopped, towlines cast off, and the anchors clear and
ready to go at the pilot’s order.
A perusal of Capt. Kabankov’s testimony makes it apparent
that he was remiss in the discharge of his duties as master of the
ship, leaving the entire docking procedure up to the pilot, instead
of maintaining watchful vigilance over this risky maneuver.’’

(7) Degree of vigilance required of master of a ship. — “In sum,
where a compulsory pilot is in charge of a ship, the master being

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

195

required to permit him to navigate it, if the master observes that
the pilot is incompetent or physically incapable, then it is the duty
of the master to refuse to permit the pilot to act. But if no such
reasons are present, then the master is justified in relying upon
the pilot, but not blindly.

Under the circumstances of this case, if a situation arose where
the master, exercising that reasonable vigilance which the master
of a ship should exercise, observed, or should have observed,
that the pilot was so navigating the vessel that she was going,
or was likely to go, into danger, and there was in the exercise of
reasonable care and vigilance an opportunity for the master to
intervene so as to save the ship from danger, the master should
have acted accordingly. The master of a vessel must exercise a
degree of vigilance commensurate with the circumstances.’’
(8) Matter of negligence, a question of fact. — “Inasmuch as the
matter of negligence is a question of fact, we defer to the findings of the trial court, especially as this is affirmed by the Court
of Appeals. But even beyond that, our own evaluation is that
Capt. Kabankov’s shared liability is due mainly to the fact that
he failed to act when the perilous situation should have spurred
him into quick and decisive action as master of the ship. In the
face of imminent or actual danger, he did not have to wait for
the happenstance to occur before countermanding or overruling
the pilot. By his own admission, Capt. Kabankov concurred with
Capt. Gavino’s decisions, and this is precisely the reason why he
decided not to countermand any of the latter’s orders.

Inasmuch as both lower courts found Capt. Gavino negligent,
by expressing full agreement therewith Capt. Kabankov was just
as negligent as Capt. Gavino.’’
(9) Personal liability of harbor pilot for damages. — “In general,
a pilot is personally liable for damages caused by his own negligence or default to the owners of the vessel, and to third parties
for damages sustained in a collision. Such negligence of the pilot
in the performance of duty constitutes a maritime tort.

At common law, a shipowner is not liable for injuries inflicted
exclusively by the negligence of a pilot accepted by a vessel compulsorily. The exemption from liability for such negligence shall
apply if the pilot is actually in charge and solely in fault. Since, a
pilot is responsible only for his own personal negligence, he cannot be held accountable for damages proximately caused by the
default of others, or, if there be anything which concurred with

196

TORTS

Art. 2178

the fault of the pilot in producing the accident, the vessel master
and owners are liable.

(10) Burden of proof. — “Since the colliding vessel is prima
facie responsible, the burden of proof is upon the party claiming
benefit of the exemption from liability. It must be shown affirmatively that the pilot was at fault, and that there was no fault on
the part of the officers or crew, which might have been conducive
to the damage.’’

(11) Liability of vessel or its owner for damages. — “The fact that
the law compelled the master to take the pilot does not exonerate
the vessel from liability. The parties who suffer are entitled to have
their remedy against the vessel that occasioned the damage, and
are not under necessity to look to the pilot from whom redress
is not always had for compensation. The owners of the vessel are
responsible to the injured party for the acts of the pilot, and they
must be left to recover the amount as well as they can against
him. It cannot be maintained that the circumstance of having a
pilot on board, and acting in conformity to his directions operate
as a discharge of responsibility of the owners.
Except insofar as their liability is limited or exempted by statute, the vessel or her owner are liable for all damages caused by
the negligence or other wrongs of the owners or those in charge
of the vessel. Where the pilot of a vessel is not a compulsory one
in the sense that the owner or master of the vessel are bound to
accept him, but is employed voluntarily, the owners of the vessel
are, all the more, liable for his negligent act.

By way of validation and in light of the aforecited guidepost
rulings in American maritime cases, we declare that our rulings
during the early years of this century in City of Manila vs. Gambe
(6 Phil. 49 [1906].), China Navigation Co., Ltd. vs. Vidal (22 Phil.
121 [1942].), and Yap Tico & Co. vs. Anderson (34 Phil. 626 [1916].),
have withstood the proverbial test of time and remain good and
relevant case law to this day.’’

(12) Injury produced by several causes. — “It may be said, as
a general rule, that negligence in order to render a person liable
need not be the sole cause of an injury. It is sufficient that his
negligence, concurring with one or more efficient causes other
than plaintiff’s, is the proximate cause of the injury.

Accordingly, where several causes combine to produce injuries,
a person is not relieved from liability because he is responsible

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

197

for only one of them, it being sufficient that the negligence of the
person charged with injury is an efficient cause without which the
injury would not have resulted to as great an extent, and that such
cause is not attributable to the person injured. It is no defense to
one of the concurrent tortfeasors that the injury would not have
resulted from his negligence alone, without the negligence or
wrongful acts of the other concurrent tortfeasor.’’

(13) Responsibility of each wrongdoer for entire result. — “Where
several causes producing an injury are concurrent and each is an
efficient cause without which the injury would not have happened,
the injury may be attributed to all or any of the causes and recovery may be had against any or all of the responsible persons
although under the circumstances of the case, it may appear that
one of them was more culpable, and that the duty owed by them
to the injured person was not the same.
No actor’s negligence ceases to be a proximate cause merely
because it does not exceed the negligence of other actors. Each
wrongdoer is responsible for the entire result and is liable as
though his acts were the sole cause of the injury.’’

(14) Solidary liability of joint tortfeasors. — “There is no contribution between joint tortfeasors whose liability is solidary since
both of them are liable for the total damage.

Where the concurrent or successive negligent acts or omissions
of two or more persons, although acting independently, are in
combination the direct and proximate cause of a single injury to
a third person, it is impossible to determine in what proportion
each contributed to the injury and either of them is responsible
for the whole injury. Where their concurring negligence resulted
in injury or damage to a third party, they become joint tortfeasors
and are solidarily liable for the resulting damage under Article
2194 of the Civil Code.’’ (Far Eastern Shipping Company vs. Court
of Appeals, 297 SCRA 30 [1998].)

Presumption of contractual negligence.
(1) Quasi-delict. — In an action for quasi-delict or tort, the
negligence or fault should be clearly established because it is
the basis of the action, whereas in a breach of contract, the action can be pursued by proving the existence of the contract,
and the fact that the obligor failed to comply with the same.
(2) Contract. — When the source of an obligation is derived

198

TORTS

Art. 2178

from a contract, the mere breach or non-fulfillment of the prestation gives rise to the presumption of fault on the part of the
obligor. (Sabena Belgian World Airlines vs. Court of Appeals,
69 SCAD 494, 255 SCRA 38 [1996].) Thus, where the action is
based on a contract of carriage, and the obligor, in this case the
carrier, failed to transport the passenger to his destination, the
fault or negligence of the carrier is presumed. It is sufficient for
the plaintiff to prove the existence of the contract of carriage
and the damages or injuries suffered by him. It is the obligation
of the carrier to transport its passengers or goods safely. (see
San Pedro Bus Lines vs. Navarro, 94 Phil. 846 [1954]; Davila vs.
Phil. Air Lines, 21 SCRA 642 [1972]; Roque vs. Buan, 21 SCRA
642 [1967]; Calalas vs. Court of Appeals, 126 SCAD 677, 332
SCRA 356 [2000].)
(a) The driver’s negligence is the carrier’s. Hence, in
culpa contractual, the moment a passenger dies or is injured,
the common carrier is presumed to have been at fault or
to have acted negligently, and the disputable presumption
may only be overcome by evidence that he had exercised
extraordinary diligence as prescribed in Articles 1733, 1755,
and 1756 of the Civil Code (Chap. 8.) or that the death or
injury of the passenger was due to a fortuitous event.

However, the presumption of fault or negligence will
not arise if the loss is due to any of the causes enumerated
in Article 1734 of the Civil Code. (Ibid.) This is a closed list.
If the cause of destruction, loss or deterioration of goods
transported is other than the enumerated circumstances, then
the carrier is liable therefor. (Belgian Overseas Chartering
and Shipping N.V. vs. Phil. First Insurance Co., Inc., 169
SCAD 22, 383 SCRA 23 [2002].)
(b) The driver is not solidarily liable (see Arts. 1207,
1208.) with the carrier, the latter being exclusively responsible
to the passenger without the right of the carrier to recover
from his driver for the latter’s negligence. (Phil. Rabbit Bus
Lines, Inc. vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 189 SCRA 158
[1990].)

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

199

Concept of fortuitous event.
Art. 1174 states:
“Except in cases expressly specified by the law, or when
it is otherwise declared by stipulation, or when the nature
of the obligation requires the assumption of risk, no person
shall be responsible for those events which could not be
foreseen, or which, though foreseen, were inevitable. (1105a)’’

A fortuitous event is any event which can not be foreseen, or
which, though foreseen, is inevitable. In other words, it is an
event which is either impossible to foresee or impossible to avoid.
The essence of a fortuitous event consists of being a happening independent of the will of the obligor and which happening, makes the normal fulfillment of the obligation impossible.
Fortuitous event distinguished
from force majeure.

(1) Acts of man. — Strictly speaking, fortuitous event is an
event independent of the will of the obligor but not of other
human wills, e.g., war, fire, robbery, murder, insurrection, etc.

(2) Acts of God. — They are those events which are totally
independent of the will of every human being, e.g., earthquake,
flood, rain, shipwreck, lightning, eruption of volcano, etc. They
are also called force majeure. It generally applies to a natural
accident.14
In our law, fortuitous events and force majeure are identical in so far as they exempt an obligor from liability. Both are
independent of the will of the obligor. (Republic vs. Luzon
Stevedoring Corp., 21 SCRA 279 [1967]; University of Santo
Tomas vs. Descals, 38 Phil. 287 [1918].)
Kinds of fortuitous event.

In speaking of the contract of lease, our Civil Code distinguishes between two kinds of fortuitous events, namely:

(1) Ordinary fortuitous events or those events which are common and which the contracting parties could reasonably foresee
(e.g., rain); and
(2) Extraordinary fortuitous events or those events which are

200

TORTS

Art. 2178

uncommon and which the contracting parties could not have
reasonably foreseen (e.g., earthquake, fire, war,15 pestilence,
unusual flood). (see Art. 1680, par. 2.)
Requisites of a fortuitous event.
They are the following:

(1) The event must be independent of the human will or at
least of the obligor’s will;

(2) The event could not be foreseen (unforeseeable), or if it
could be foreseen, must have been impossible to avoid (unavoidable);
(3) The event must be of such a character as to render it
impossible for the obligor to comply with his obligation in a
normal manner; and

(4) The obligor must be free from any participation in, or the
aggravation of the injury to the obligee. (see Lasam vs. Smith,
45 Phil. 657 [1923]; see General Enterprises, Inc. vs. Lianga Bay
Logging Co., Inc., 11 SCRA 733 [1964]; Tugade vs. Court of Appeals, 85 SCRA 226 [1978]; Juntilla vs. Fontaner, 136 SCRA 624
[1985].)

The absence of any of the above requisites would prevent
the obligor from being exempt from liability. The court, however, may equitably mitigate the damages if the loss would
have resulted just the same because of the fortuitous event. (see
Art. 2215[4], Chap. 2, Part II.) The burden for proving that the
loss is due to a fortuitous event rests upon the part invoking it.
Concurrent or previous negligence of obligor.
It is essential that there is no concurrent or previous negligence or imprudence on the part of the obligor by which the
loss or injury may have been occasioned.

When the effect is found to be in part the result of the participation of man, whether due to his active intervention or neglect
or failure to act, the whole occurrence is then humanized and
removed from the rules applicable to the acts of God. (National
Power Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 211 SCRA 162 [1992],

Art. 2178

41 SCAD 605, 222 SCRA 415 [1993]; see Metal Forming Corp.
vs. Office of the President, 64 SCAD 34, 246 SCRA 731 [1995].)

In other words, in order to be exempt from liability arising
from a fortuitous event, there should have been no human participation amounting to a negligent act. (Southwestern College,
Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 96 SCAD 136, 292 SCRA 422 [1998].)
Such event should be the sole and proximate cause (Art. 2179.)
of the loss or injury. The act-of-God doctrine requires all human
agencies to be excluded from creating the cause of the mischief.
(Manila International Airport Authority v. ALA Industries Corp.,
422 SCRA 603 [2004].)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. Petitioner, charged with having misrepresented its product, avers
that it should not be made responsible for the adverse consequences of
a fortuitous event such as a typhoon.
Facts: Private respondents, spouses, charged petitioner MFC
with violation of Section 3 of Act No. 3740, “An Act to Penalize Fraudulent Advertising, Mislabeling or Misbranding of any
Product, Stocks, Bonds, Etc.”

The spouses alleged, among other things, that in selling to the
public roofing materials known as “Banawe” shingles, petitioner
made representations on the durability of the product and the sturdiness of its installation. Aside from massive advertisements in print
media and television, it also distributed brochures to its prospective
customers containing the same representations. On the first page of
the brochure appears the following: “STRUCTURALLY SAFE AND
STRONG . . . The BANAWE METAL TILE structure acts as a single
against
wind
andwhen
storm
due to the

action
with unit

Appeals, 117 SCAD 818, 321 SCRA 375 [1999].)
15
War, or its effects, or other factors which could not have been foreseen or avoided
by a party, such as uncertain conditions of peace and order then prevailing which the
court may take judicial notice of, are deemed sufficient causes that could justify the nonfulfillment of a contract and exempt the party from responsibility. (Phil. National Bank vs.
Court of Appeals, 94 SCRA 357 [1979].)
16
Art. 1306. The contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and
conditions as they may deem convenient, provided they are not contrary to law, morals,
good customs, public order, or public policy. (1255a)

on its overlaps.” Barely two (2) months after completion of the installation, portions of the roof of private respondents were blown away
by strong winds brought about by typhoon “Ruping.”

Petitioner raises as an issue whether the statement in its
brochure that “the Banawe metal tile acts as a single unit against
wind and storm pressure due to the strong hook action on its
overlaps” is a misrepresentation within the contemplation of Sec.
3 of Act No. 3740 simply because a section or portion of the roof
of private respondents was blown away by a strong typhoon. It
asseverates that under Art. 1174 of the Civil Code it should not
be made responsible for the adverse consequences of a fortuitous
event such as typhoon “Ruping” which, as admitted by private
respondents, caused the blowing away of a section or portion of
their roof. Besides, its product acts as a single unit specifically
against storm pressure.

Issue: Should MFC be made responsible for the adverse consequences of a fortuitous event such as the typhoon which caused the
section or portion of private respondents’ roof to be blown away?
Held: Yes. (1) Roofing materials bought as a single unit. — “We
agree with the observation of the Solicitor General that — Petitioner (gives) a restricted interpretation of its statement that the
structure of its roof tiles has the capacity to act as a single unit .
. . Surely, in buying the subject roof tiles, the private respondents
correctly relied on petitioner’s representations as it would be commonly and reasonably interpreted by the buying public, viz., that
since its structure acts as a single unit, wind and storm pressure
would not be able to blow away any part or portion thereof.’’
(2) Representation refers to all weather disturbances. — “Petitioner
harps on the distinction between a tropical storm and a typhoon.
According to the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, ‘the maximum winds about the
center of the disturbance (tropical storm) range from 64 to 117
kilometers per hour (kph) or 18 to 32 meters per second (mps)
or 34 to 64 knots, while the maximum winds about the center of
the disturbance typhoon) are 118 kilometers per hour or 33 meters
per second or 65 knots or more.’

Contrary to petitioner’s pretension, the phrase ‘against wind
and storm pressure’ is not couched in specific terms because as
correctly pointed out by the Office of the Solicitor General —
‘. . . in deciding whether or not to buy the subject roof
tiles being advertised by petitioner, it is reasonable to assume

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

203

that buyers, like private respondents, would consider (said)
phrase . . . referring to all kinds of weather disturbances being
experienced in our country during the rainy season, be it a
mere tropical depression, a storm or even a typhoon.’

In this regard, public respondent opined, which sustain,
that —
‘(Petitioner) cannot place undue reliance on the distinction between or among the terms ‘storm,’ ‘typhoon’ or ‘cyclone’ because it itself had caused the misrepresentations to
be couched in general terms. Also, considering the weather
situation in the country where storms and typhoons are not
a rare or unusual occurrence, these terms ought to, as they
should only be, understood as comprehending and referring
practically to the same thing, at least insofar as the jural effects
of misrepresentations (petitioner’s) are concerned.’’’

(3) Negligence of MFC concurs with a fortuitous event. — “In
order that a fortuitous event may exempt a person from liability,
it is necessary that he be free from negligence. An act of God cannot be urged for the protection of a person who has been guilty
of gross negligence in not trying to avert its results. When the
negligence of a person concurs with an act of God in producing
a loss, such person is not exempt from liability by showing that
the immediate cause of the damage was the act of God.

As correctly viewed by public respondent, although the occurrence of a typhoon is a fortuitous event which by itself might
have exempted petitioner from liability to private respondents —

‘. . . it cannot efface the fundamental fact that (petitioner)
acted in bad faith and/or with gross negligence in failing to
deliver the necessary accessories for the proper installation
of the structure . . . and actually installed inferior roofing
materials at (private respondents’) residence, in violation of
the proper installation procedure expressly specified in the
former’s brochures and advertisements for installation, i.e.,
the metal tile attached to the roof panels should be by two (2)
self-drilling screws for one (1) metal cleat. However, instead
of conforming with this procedure, (petitioner) attached some
of the metal cleats with only one (1)-inch ordinary nail each
and other were fastened with only one (1) wood screw each.’

To a large extent, the capacity of petitioner’s roof tiles to act
as a single unit depends on the strong hook action on the overlaps of the individual parts which comprise the whole structure.

204

TORTS

Art. 2178

However, as inferred by the Solicitor General —

‘. . . there can only be a strong hook action if the subject
roof tiles were properly installed by petitioner complete with
all the necessary accessories thereto . . .’

As it turned out, the tiles were improperly installed thus
contributing to the damage to private respondents’ roof.’’ (Metal
Forming Corporation vs. Office of the President, 64 SCAD 34, 247
SCRA 731 [1995].)

2. NPC was charged with having suddenly and negligently, without sufficient notice, released a large amount of water from the Angat
Dam’s spillways, as a consequence of which members of the household of
plaintiffs, together with their animals were drowned and their properties
washed away.
Facts: Private respondents sought to recover actual and moral
damages against NPC, etc. for the loss of lives and destruction
to property caused by the inundation of the town of Norzaragay,
Bulacan. The flooding was purportedly caused by the negligent
release by defendants of water through the three (3) spillways of
the Angat Dam.

In their Answers, the defendants, now petitioners, alleged
that: 1) the NPC exercised due care, diligence and prudence in
the operation and maintenance of the hydroelectric plant; 2) the
NPC exercised the diligence of a good father in the selection of
its employees; 3) written notices were sent to the different municipalities of Bulacan warning the residents therein about the
impending release of a large volume of water with the onset of
typhoon “Kading” and advising them to take the necessary precautions; 4) the water released during the typhoon was needed
to prevent the collapse of the dam and avoid greater damage to
people and property; 5) in spite of the precautions undertaken and
the diligence exercised, they could still not contain or control the
flood that resulted; and 6) the damages incurred by the private
respondents were caused by a fortuitous event or force majeure and
are in the nature and character of damnum absque injuria.
The Court of Appeals found the petitioners guilty of: “. . . a
patent gross and evident lack of foresight, imprudence and negligence . . . in the management and operation of Angat Dam. The
unholiness of the hour, the extent of the opening of the spillways,
and the magnitude of the water released, are all but products of
defendants-appellees’ headlessness, slovenliness, and carelessness.

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

205

The resulting flash flood and inundation of even areas (sic) one
(1) kilometer away from the Angat River bank would have been
avoided had defendants-appellees prepared the Angat Dam by
maintaining in the first place, a water elevation which would allow room for the expected torrential rains.”
Issue: Should petitioners be exempt from liability under Article
1174 on the ground that the damages were caused by a fortuitous
event?

Held: No. (1) Flood caused by stored water suddenly and simultaneously released. — “From the mass of evidence extant in the record,
We are convinced, and so hold that the flash flood on October 27,
1978, was caused not by rain waters (sic), but by stored waters
(sic) suddenly and simultaneously released from the Angat Dam
by defendants-appellees, particularly from midnight of October
26, 1978 up to the morning hours of October 27, 1978.
The appellate court rejected the petitioners’ defense that they
had sent ‘early warning written notices’ to the towns of Norzagaray,
Angat, Bustos, Plaridel, Baliwag and Calumpit dated 24 October
1978 and which read: x x x
‘Said notice was delivered to the ‘towns of Bulacan’ on October
26, 1978 by defendants-appellees’ driver, Leonardo Nepomuceno.

Said notice is ineffectual, insufficient and inadequate for purposes of the opening of the spillway gates at midnight of October
26, 1978 and on October 27, 1978. It did not prepare or warn the
persons so served, for the volume of water to be released, which
turned out to be of such magnitude, that residents near or along
the Angat River, even those one (1) kilometer away, should have
been advised to evacuate. Said notice, addressed ‘TO ALL CONCERN (sic),’ was delivered to a policeman for the municipality
of Norzagaray. Said notice was not thus addressed and delivered
to the proper and responsible municipal officials who could have
disseminated the warning to the residents directly affected. As
for the municipality of Sta. Maria, where plaintiffs-defendants
in Civil Case No. SM-1246 reside, said notice does not appear to
have been served.’’’
(2) Petitioner’s negligence concurred with act of God or force majeure. — “If upon the happening of a fortuitous event or an act
of God, there concurs a corresponding fraud, negligence, delay
or violation or contravention in any manner of the tenor of the
obligation as provided for in Article 1170 of the Civil Code, which
results in loss or damage, the obligor cannot escape liability.

206

TORTS

Art. 2178

The principle embodied in the act of God doctrine strictly
requires that the act must be one occasioned exclusively by the
violence of nature and all human agencies are to be excluded
from creating or entering into the cause of the mischief. When
the effect, the cause of which is to be considered, is found to be
in part the result of the participation of man, whether it be from
active intervention or neglect, or failure to act, the whole occurrence is thereby humanized, as it were, and removed from the
rules applicable to the acts of God.
Thus, it has been held that when the negligence of a person
concurs with an act of God in producing a loss, such person is
not exempt from liability by showing that the immediate cause of
the damage was the act of God. To be exempt from liability for
loss because of an act of God, he must be free from any previous
negligence or misconduct by which that loss or damage may have
been occasioned.

Accordingly, petitioners cannot be heard to invoke the act
of God or force majeure to escape liability for the loss or damage
sustained by the private respondents since they, the petitioners,
were guilty of negligence. The event then was not occasioned
exclusively by an act of God or force majeure; a human factor —
negligence or imprudence — had intervened.’’ (National Power
Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 222 SCRA 415 [1993].)

3. The roof of petitioner’s building was partly ripped of and blown
away, landing on and destroying portion of the roofing of private respondents’ house, when a powerful typhoon hit Metro Manila.
Facts: Buffeted by very strong winds of typhoon “Saling,’’
the roof of petitioner’s building was partly ripped off and blown
away, landing on and destroying portions of the roofing of private respondents’ house. After the typhoon had passed, an ocular
inspection of the destroyed buildings was conducted by a team
of engineers headed by the city building official.
Pertinent aspects of the latter’s Report stated, as follows:

“5. One of the factors that may have led to this calamitous
event is the formation of the buildings in the area and the
general direction of the wind. Situated in the peripheral lot
is an almost U-shaped formation of 4-storey building. Thus,
with the strong winds having a westerly direction, the general
formation of the buildings becomes a big funnel-like structure,

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

207

the one situated along College Road, receiving the heaviest
impact of the strong winds. Hence, there are portions of the
roofing, those located on both ends of the building, which
remained intact after the storm.

6. Another factor and perhaps the most likely reason for
the dislodging of the roofings structural trusses is the improper
anchorage of the said trusses to the roof beams. The “diameter
steel bars embedded on the concrete roof beams which serve
as truss anchorage are not bolted nor nailed to the trusses.
Still, there are other steel bars which were not even bent to
the trusses, thus, those trusses are not anchored at all to the
roof beams.”

It then recommended that “to avoid any further loss and
damage to lives, limbs and property of persons living in the
vicinity,” the fourth floor of subject school building be declared
as a “structural hazard.”

In their Answer to the complaint for damages based on culpa
aquiliana, petitioner averred that subject school building had withstood several devastating typhoons and other calamities in the
past, without its roofing or any portion thereof giving way; that
it has not been remiss in its responsibility to see to it that said
school building, which houses school children, faculty members,
and employees, is “in tip-top condition,” and furthermore, typhoon
“Saling” was “an act of God and, therefore, beyond human control” such that petitioner cannot be answerable for the damages
wrought thereby, absent any negligence on its part.
Issue: Whether the damage on the roof of the building of private
respondents resulting from the impact of the falling portions of the
school building’s roof ripped off by the strong winds of typhoon
“Saling,” was, within legal contemplation, due to fortuitous event.

Held: (1) Concept of fortuitous event. — “The antecedent of
fortuitous event or caso fortuito is found in the Partidas which
defines it as ‘an event which takes place by accident and could
not have been foreseen.’ Escriche elaborates it as ‘an unexpected
event or act of God which could neither be foreseen nor resisted.’
Civilist Arturo M. Tolentino adds that ‘[f]ortuitous events may
be produced by two general causes: (1) by nature, such as earthquakes, storms, floods, epidemics, fires, etc., and (2) by the act of
man, such as an armed invasion, attack by bandits, governmental
prohibitions, robbery, etc.’’’

208

TORTS

Art. 2178

(2) Exemption from liability for damages caused by a fortuitous
event. — “There is no question that a typhoon or storm is a fortuitous event, a natural occurrence which may be foreseen but is
unavoidable despite any amount of foresight, diligence or care.
In order to be exempt from liability arising from any adverse
consequence engendered thereby, there should have been no human participation amounting to a negligent act. In other words,
the person seeking exoneration from liability must not be guilty
of negligence.
Negligence, as commonly understood, is conduct which
naturally or reasonably creates undue risk or harm to others.
It may be the failure to observe that degree of care, precaution,
and vigilance which the circumstances justly demand, or the
omission to do something which a prudent and reasonable man,
guided by considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct
of human affairs, would do. From these premises, we proceed to
determine whether petitioner was negligent, such that if it were
not, the damage caused to private respondents’ house could have
been avoided?’’
(3) Burden of proof to establish fault or negligence. — “A person
claiming damages for the negligence of another has the burden of
proving the existence of fault or negligence causative of his injury
or loss. The facts constitutive of negligence must be affirmatively
established by competent evidence, not merely by presumptions
and conclusions without basis in fact.

Private respondents, in establishing the culpability of petitioner,
merely relied on the aforementioned report submitted by a team
which made an ocular inspection of petitioner’s school building
after the typhoon. As the term imparts, an ocular inspection is
one by means of actual sight or viewing. What is visual to the
eye though, is not always reflective of the real cause behind. For
instance, one who hears a gunshot and then sees a wounded
person, cannot always definitely conclude that a third person shot
the victim. It could have been self-inflicted or caused accidentally
by a stray bullet. The relationship of cause and effect must be
clearly shown.
In the present case, other than the said ocular inspection, no
investigation was conducted to determine the real cause of the
partial unroofing of petitioner’s school building. Private respondents did not even show that the plans, specifications and design
of said school building, were deficient and defective. Neither did
they prove any substantial deviation from the approved plans

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

209

and specifications. Nor did they conclusively establish that the
construction of such building was basically flawed.’’

(4) Prima facie evidence of regular and proper construction of subject
building. — “On the other hand, petitioner elicited from one of the
witnesses of private respondents, city building official Jesus Reyna,
that the original plans and design of petitioner’s school building
were approved prior to its construction. Engr. Reyna admitted that
it was a legal requirement before the construction of any building
to obtain a permit from the city building official (city engineer,
prior to the passage of the Building Act of 1977). In like manner,
after construction of the building, a certification must be secured
from the same official attesting to the readiness for occupancy of
the edifice. Having obtained both building permit and certificate
of occupancy, these are, at the very least, prima facie evidence of
the regular and proper construction of subject school building.
Furthermore, when part of its roof needed repairs of the damage inflicted by typhoon “Saling,” the same city official gave the
go-signal for such repairs — without any deviation from the original
design — and subsequently, authorized the use of the entire fourth
floor of the same building. These only prove that subject building suffers from no structural defect, contrary to the report that
its “U-shaped” form was “structurally defective.” Having given
his unqualified imprimatur, the city building official is presumed
to have properly performed his duties in connection therewith.

In addition, petitioner presented its vice president for finance
and administration who testified that an annual maintenance
inspection and repair of subject school building were regularly
undertaken. Petitioner was even willing to present its maintenance supervisor to attest to the extent of such regular inspection
but private respondents agreed to dispense with his testimony
and simply stipulated that it would be corroborative of the vice
president’s narration.

Moreover, the city building official, who has been in the city
government service since 1974, admitted in open court that no
complaint regarding any defect on the same structure has ever
been lodged before his office prior to the institution of the case at
bench. It is a matter of judicial notice that typhoons are common
occurrences in this country. If subject school building’s roofing
was not firmly anchored to its trusses, obviously, it could not
have withstood long years and several typhoons even stronger
than ‘Saling.’”

210

TORTS

Art. 2178

(5) Proximate cause of the damage suffered by private respondents’
house. — “In light of the foregoing, we find no clear and convincing evidence to sustain the judgment of the appellate court. We
thus hold that petitioner has not been shown negligent or at fault
regarding the construction and maintenance of its school building
in question and that typhoon ‘Saling’ was the proximate cause of
the damage suffered by private respondents’ house.
With this disposition on the pivotal issue, private respondents’
claim for actual and moral damages as well as attorney’s fees must
fail. Petitioner cannot be made to answer for a purely fortuitous
event. More so because no bad faith or willful act to cause damage
was alleged and proven to warrant moral damages.’’ (Southeastern
College, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 292 SCRA 422 [1998].)

Rules as to liability in case
of fortuitous event.
A person is not, as a rule, responsible for loss or damage
resulting from fortuitous events. In other words, his obligation
is extinguished. The exceptions are enumerated below.
(1) When expressly specified by law. — In exceptions (a), (b),
and (c) below, the special strictness of the law is justified.

(a) The debtor is guilty of fraud, negligence, or delay,
or contravention of the tenor of the obligation. (Arts. 1170,
1165, par. 3.)
(b) The debtor has promised to deliver the same (specific)
thing to two or more persons who do not have the same
interest for it would be impossible for the debtor to comply
with his obligation to two or more creditors even without
any fortuitous event taking place. (Ibid.)

(c) The debt of a thing certain and determinate proceeds
from a criminal offense, unless the thing having been offered
by the debtor to the person who should receive it, the latter
refused without justification to accept it. (Art. 1268.)
(d) The thing to be delivered is generic (Art. 1263.) for
the debtor can still comply with his obligation by delivering another thing of the same kind in accordance with the
principle that “genus never perishes” (genus nunquam perit).
(2) When declared by stipulation. — The basis for this excep-

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

211

tion rests upon the freedom of contract. (Art. 130616.) Such a
stipulation is usually intended to better protect the interest of
the creditor and procure greater diligence on the part of the
debtor in the fulfillment of his obligation. But the intention to
make the debtor liable even in case of a fortuitous event should
be clearly expressed.
(3) When the nature of the obligation requires the assumption of
risk. — Here, risk of loss or damage is an essential element in
the obligation.

For example, in a contract of insurance, the insurer is liable
for loss of the thing insured although the cause thereof is a
fortuitous event.
Doctrine of assumption of risk.
(1) Meaning. — Assumption of risk may be invoked as a
complete defense by the defendant in a quasi-delictual action.
The doctrine assumes that a plaintiff who voluntarily assumes
a risk of harm from the negligent conduct of the defendant
cannot recover from such harm. (57 Am. Jur. 2d 663.)

(2) Kinds. — The defense may arise where a plaintiff, by
contract or otherwise, expressly agrees to accept a risk of harm
arising from the defendant’s conduct, or where a plaintiff who
fully understands a risk of harm caused by the defendant’s
conduct, or by a condition created by the defendant, voluntarily
chooses to enter or remain, or to permit his property to enter
or remain, within the area of such risk, under circumstances
manifesting his willingness to accept the risk. (Ibid.)
Thus, the assumption may be made:

(a) through contract whereby the plaintiff expressly
waives in advance his right to recover damages for the
negligent conduct of the defendant; or

(b) in cases which involve no contractual relationship
between the parties, whereby one, knowing and comprehending the risk of harm, voluntarily exposed himself to it.

In either case, the plaintiff is deemed to have assumed the
risk, and even if he was not negligent in doing so, he is preclud-

212

TORTS

Art. 2178

ed from recovering damages for the resulting injury.

(3) Requisites. — The defense of assumption of risk presupposes the following:
(a) The plaintiff had actual knowledge of the danger;

(b) He understood and appreciated the risk from the
danger;
(c) He voluntarily exposed himself to such risk.

Therefore, except where he expressly so agrees, the plaintiff
does not assume a risk of harm arising from defendant’s conduct
unless he then knows the existence of the risk and appreciates
its unreasonable character or the danger involved, including the
magnitude thereof, and voluntarily accepts the risk. (Ibid. 674.)
Effect where risk not one impossible
to foresee.
Where the risk is quite evident such that the possibility of
danger is not only foreseeable, but actually foreseen, then it
could be said that the nature of the obligation is such that a
party could rightfully be deemed to have assumed it. Under
Article 1174, the event must be one impossible to foresee or to
avoid in order that a party may not be said to have assumed
the risk resulting from the nature of the obligation itself. (Dioquino vs. Laureano, 33 SCRA 65 [1970].)

Mere difficulty to foresee the happening of an event is
different from impossibility to foresee the same. (Republic vs.
Luzon Stevedoring Corp., 21 SCRA 279 [1967].)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1.

Happening of event was foreseen.

Facts: A barge owned by LSC was being towed down the
Pasig river by two of its tugboats, when it rammed against one
of the wooden piles of the Nagtahan bailey bridge, smashing the
posts and causing the bridge to list. The river, at that time, was
swollen and the current swift, on account of the heavy downpour
for two days before.
Sued by R (Republic of the Philippines) for damages caused
by its employees, LSC disclaimed responsibility on the ground,
among others, that the damages caused to the bridge were caused

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

213

by force majeure or fortuitous event. LSC strongly stresses the precautions taken by it on the day in question: that it assigned two
of its most powerful tugboats to tow the barge down the river;
that it assigned to the task the more competent and experienced
among its patrons; had the towliness, engines, and equipment
double-checked and inspected; that it instructed its patrons to take
extra-precautions; and concludes it had done all it was called to do.

Issue: Whether or not the collision of LSC’s barge with the
supports or piers of the Nagtahan bridge was, in law, caused by
fortuitous event or force majeure?

Held: (1) Precautions adopted by LSC’s showed risk anticipated. —
“These very precautions completely destroy LSC’s defense. Under
Article 1174, it is not enough that the event should not have been
foreseen or anticipated, as is commonly believed, but it must be
one impossible to foresee or to avoid. The mere difficulty to foresee
the happening is not impossibility to foresee the same. The very
measures adopted by LSC prove that the possibility of danger was
not unforeseeable, but actually foreseen, and was not caso fortuito.’’
(2) LSC assumed risk. — “Otherwise stated, LSC, knowing
and appreciating the perils posed by the swollen stream and
its swift current, voluntarily entered into a situation involving
obvious danger; it, therefore, assumed the risk, and cannot shed
responsibility merely because the precautions it adopted turned
out to be insufficient.’’
(3) LSC presumed negligent. — “Furthermore, considering that
the Nagtahan bridge was an immovable and stationery object and
provided with adequate openings for the passage of water craft,
the unusual event that the barge, exclusively controlled by LSC,
rammed the bridge raises a presumption of negligence on the
part of LSC or its employees manning the barge or the tugs that
towed it. For in the ordinary course of events, such thing does
not happen if proper care is used.’’ (Republic vs. Luzon Stevedoring
Corp., supra.)

Happening of event was clearly unforeseen.

Facts: B borrowed the car of L. While about to reach his
medical mishaps. The 13 December 1999 issue of TIME MAGAZINE featured an article on
medical negligence entitled “Doctors, Deadly Mistakes’’ which is quoted in part: “It is hardly
news that medical professionals make mistakes — even dumb, deadly mistakes. What is
shocking is how often it happens. Depending on which statistics you believe, the number

destination, the car driven by L’s driver and with B as the sole
passenger, was accidentally stoned by some “mischievous boys”
playing along the road and its windshield was broken.
Issue: Did B assume the risk of the car being stoned?

Held: No. What happened was clearly unforeseen. It was a
fortuitous event which must be borne by the owner (L) of the car.
The very wording of Article 1174 dispels any doubt that what is
therein contemplated is the resulting liability even if caused by a
fortuitous event where the party charged may be considered as
having assumed the risk incident in the nature of the obligation
to be performed.

It would be an affront, not only to logic but to the realities
of the situation, if B could be held as bound to assume the risk
of this nature. In the case of Republic vs. Luzon Stevedoring Corporation, supra, the risk was quite evident and the nature of the
obligation such that a party could rightfully be deemed as having
assumed it. It is not so in the case at bar. (Dioquino vs. Laureano,
33 SCRA 65 [1970].)

Art. 2179. When the plaintiff’s own negligence was
the immediate and proximate cause of his injury, he
cannot recover damages. But if his negligence was
only contributory, the immediate and proximate cause
of the injury being the defendant’s lack of due care,
the plaintiff may recover damages, but the courts
shall mitigate the damages to be awarded. (n)
Effect of negligence on the part
of the injured party.
(1) Negligence merely contributed to injury. — To be entitled
to damages, the law does not require that the negligence of the
defendant should be the sole cause of the damage. (Astudillo
vs. Manila Electric Co., 55 Phil. 427 [1930].) In quasi-delicts,
the contributory negligence (remote or relatively minor) of the
plaintiff shall reduce the damages that he may recover. (Art.
2214.)
There is contributory negligence (infra.) on the part of the
injured party where his conduct has contributed, as a legal
cause to the harm he has suffered, which falls below the stand-

Art. 2178

QUASI-DELICTS

215

ard
to which he is required to conform for his own
protection. (Valenzuela vs. Court of Appeals, 68 SCAD 113, 253
SCRA 303 [1996].)

(2) Negligence not contributory to injury. — But where both
fortuitous event and lack of due diligence are present under
conditions that the loss would have happened with or without
the negligence of the obligor — hence, the consequences are all
a derivation of the fortuitous event — it cannot be said that
responsibility arises therefrom. (Nakpil & Sons vs. Court of
Appeals, 144 SCRA 596 [1986]; see 8 Manresa 94-95.) In such a
case, however, the courts are not bound to discharge the obligor from all liability. Under the law (Art. 2215[4].), where “the
loss would have resulted in any event,” they “may equitably
mitigate the damages” which in view of the circumstances the
obligor should pay.
(3) Negligence the exclusive, or immediate and proximate cause
of injury. — Where the injured party’s negligence was not
merely contributory, but the immediate and proximate cause
of his injury, he has no right to recover for the injuries which
he suffered. Of course, there is no liability where the fault or
negligence of the injured party himself is the sole determining
cause of his injury.

(4) Negligence equal to that of the other. — In this case, neither
can recover from the other for damages, as where two cars, going
in opposite directions, collide on turning a street corner and it
appears from the evidence that the drivers thereof were equally
negligent and contributed equally to the damage caused to each
other car. (Bernardo vs. Legaspi, 29 Phil. 12 [1908].) Neither can
recover from the other; each must bear his own damage.
Legal cause of damage, harm, or injury.
A person claiming damages for the fault or negligence of another has the burden of establishing at least three (3) conditions:
(1) Fault or negligence of the defendant;

(2) Damage, harm, or injury to the plaintiff; and

(3) Connection of cause and effect between the fault or
negligence and the damage.

216

TORTS

Art. 2179

In other words, in a quasi-delictual action, it is not enough
that the plaintiff proves negligence and damage. It is still necessary that he furnishes proof of the casual connection between
such negligence and the said damage. The establishment of
the requisite casual connection is, therefore, an element of a
plaintiff’s cause of action for fault or negligence, to be pleaded
and proven by him.
Once defendant’s negligence is established, the inquiry is:
Was that negligence the proximate cause or legal cause of the
plaintiff’s injury? If his negligence is not established, the question of proximate cause is of no relevance.
Concept of proximate cause.
(1) No exact rule for determining when causes are proximate. — It
has been said that the definitions of “proximate cause’’ are easy
to give in general terms, but very difficult to apply in practice
to the facts of particular cases. Indeed, it is impossible by any
general rule to draw a line between those cases of injuries which
the law regards as sufficiently proximate and those which are
too remote to be the foundation of an action.

As for the value of precedents, it has been said that the
authorities on proximate cause can best be used for merely
illustrative purposes. The general rules relating to proximate
cause often did not apply to the facts and circumstances of a
particular case. They furnish no yardstick by which every case
must necessarily be determined upon its own particular facts.
(see 57 Am. Jur. 2d 492-495.)
(2) Definitions or formulations. — The following are some of
the definitions or formulations of proximate cause:

(a) It is that “cause, which, in natural and continuous
sequence, unbroken by any efficient intervening cause, produces the injury, and without which the result would not
have occurred.
And more comprehensively, the proximate legal cause is
that acting first and producing the injury, either immediately
or by setting other events in motion, all constituting a natural
and continuous chain of events, each having a close causal

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

217

connection with its immediate predecessor, the final event
in the chain immediately effecting the injury as a natural
and probable result of the cause which first acted, under
such circumstances that the person responsible for the first
event should, as an ordinary prudent and intelligent person,
have reasonable ground to expect at the moment of his act
or default that an injury to some person might probably
result therefrom.” (Mckee vs. Intermediate Appellate Court,
211 SCRA 517 [1992]; Vda. De Bataclan vs. Medina, 102 Phil.
181 [1957]; Teague vs. Fernandez, 51 SCRA 181 [1973]; Fernando vs. Court of Appeals, 208 SCRA 714 [1992]; Urbano
vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 157 SCRA 1 [1988].)

(b) “The concept of proximate cause is well defined
in our corpus of jurisprudence as ‘any cause which, in
natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any efficient
intervening cause, produces the result complained of and
without which would not have occurred and from which
it ought to have been foreseen or reasonably anticipated
by a person of ordinary case that the injury complained of
or some similar injury, would result therefrom as a natural
and probable consequence.” (Pilipinas Bank vs. Court of
Appeals, 53 SCAD 514, 234 SCRA 435 [1994].)
(c) “A prior and remote cause cannot be made the basis
of an action if such remote cause did nothing more than
furnish the condition or give rise to the occasion by which
the injury was made possible, if there intervened between
such prior or remote cause and the injury a distinct, successive unrelated, and efficient cause of the injury, even
though such injury would not have happened but for such
condition or occasion. If no danger existed in the condition except because of the independent cause, such condition was not the proximate cause. And if an independent
negligent act or defective condition sets into operation the
circumstances which result in injury because of the prior
defective condition, such subsequent act or condition is the
proximate cause.’’ (Manila Electric Co. vs. Remoquillo, 99
Phil. 117 [1956]; Vda. De Bataclan vs. Medina, supra.)
(d) “The proximate cause is the efficient cause, the one that

218

TORTS

Art. 2179

necessarily sets the causes in operation. The causes that are
merely incidental or instruments of a superior or controlling
agency are not the proximate causes and the responsible ones,
though they may be nearer in time to the result. It is only when
the causes are independent of each other that the nearest is,
of course, to be charged with the disaster.’’ (Savanah Electric
Co. vs. Wheeler, 128 Ga 550, 58 SE 38.)

(3) Rule where there are concurrent causes. — Where the concurrent or successive negligent acts or omissions of two or more
persons, although acting independently, are in combination, the
direct and proximate cause of a single injury to a third person,
and it is impossible to determine in what proportion each
contributed to the injury, either of them is responsible for the
whole injury. (Far Eastern Shipping Co. vs. Court of Appeals,
99 SCAD 347, 297 SCRA 30 [1998].)
As explained in the above cited case:

“It may be said, as a general rule, that negligence in
order to render a person liable need not be the sole cause
of an injury. It is sufficient that his negligence, concurring
with one or more efficient causes other than plaintiffs’, is
the proximate cause of the injury. Accordingly, where several
causes combine to produce injuries, a person is not relieved
from liability because he is responsible for only one of them,
it being sufficient that the negligence of the person charged
with injury is an efficient cause without which the injury
would not have resulted to as great an extent, and that such
cause is not attributable to the person injured.

It is no defense to one of the concurrent tortfeasors that
the injury would not have resulted from his negligence
alone, without the negligence or wrongful acts of the other
concurrent tortfeasor. Where several causes producing an
injury are concurrent and each is an efficient cause without
which the injury would not have happened, the injury may
be attributed to all or any of the causes and recovery may be
had against any or all of the responsible persons although
under the circumstances of the case, it may appear that one
of them was more culpable, and that the duty owed by them

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

219

to the injured person was not the same.

No actor’s negligence ceases to be the proximate cause
merely because it does not exceed the negligence of other actors. Each wrongdoer is responsible for the entire result and
is liable as though his acts were the sole cause of the injury.’’
Tests of proximate cause.

It is generally accepted that tort liability is dependent on
proof that the defendant’s wrongful act or omission was the
legal cause of the plaintiffs’ injury. However, the difficulty of
scientific proof of causation has generated differences of views
concerning the proper method for requiring or dispensing with
proof of causation.

American case law has used a number of tests in determining
the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury. None of them has
been found as a satisfactory universal formula in determining
proximate cause. Among these tests are those described below.
(1) ‘But for’’ test. — Simply stated, defendant’s conduct is
the cause of the injury which would not have been sustained if
the defendant had not been negligent. Conversely, the defendant’s conduct cannot be said to be the proximate cause of the
accident unless the accident could have been avoided without
such negligent act. (57 Am. Jur. 2d 501-502.)

This test is frequently referred to as the sine qua non rule. The
negligence need not be the sole cause of the injury. The actor
is liable to respond in damages although there are other causes
concurring with the negligence, as long as it is the “proximate
concurring cause,’’ or true cause, that is, the other cause or
causes would not have produced the injury independently of
his negligence.
For the defendant to be held liable, the plaintiff must establish that but for the defendant’s culpable conduct or activity,
the plaintiff would not have been injured.

Example: If X negligently fails to keep a life preserver
aboard his ship and Y, a passenger, would have been saved
but for the absence of the life preserver, then X’s negligence
is a “but for’’ cause of Y’s drowning. If, however, Y would

220

TORTS

Art. 2179

have drowned or been consumed by a shark despite X’s
culpable conduct in not keeping a life preserver aboard,
then X’s negligence is not a “but for’’ cause.
There is a degree of artificial abstraction in the concept of
“but for’’ causation.
Example: If X is speeding and hits Y, X can argue that he
would have hit Y even if he had been travelling at a lawful
speed. Under conventional accepted causation analysis. X’s
negligence is not a “but for’’ cause if the outcome would
have been the same even if X had not been negligent.

On the other hand, one could argue that it was the speed
with which X was travelling that placed X in the position on
the road where he collided with Y, warranting a conclusion
that X’s excessive speed was the cause. Courts, however,
have almost invariably rejected this analysis and relied on
the conventional approach to find the speed inconsequential.

As a general rule, the plaintiff has the burden of proving
“but for’’ causation. As in civil law generally, the plaintiff must
prove causation by a preponderance of the evidence. Consequently, the plaintiff must prove that more likely than not, the
defendant was a “but for’’ cause of her injury.
It is quite possible to have more than one “but for’’ cause
for an injury.

Example: If X is a passenger on a bus, the bus driver may
negligently fail to observe a railroad crossing. In addition,
the railroad crossing guard may negligently fail to stop the
bus. Furthermore, the train engineer may negligently fail to
see the bus.
In this instance, the bus driver, the crossing guard, and
the train engineer are all “but for’’ causes of the passenger’s
injury, assuming any of the three could have avoided the
accident by acting reasonably.

Thus, while the substantial factor test is often used in
the context of multiple causes, there are certain contexts
involving multiple causes appropriately resolved by the
“but for’’ test. (Diamond, Levine & Madden, Understanding

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

221

Torts, 1996, Ed., pp. 192-193.)
(2) Cause-in-fact test. — In all cases where proximate cause
is in issue, a “cause-in-fact’’ relation must exist between defendant’s conduct and plaintiff’s injury before liability may arise.

The first step is to determine whether defendant’s conduct
in point of fact was a factor in causing plaintiff’s damage. If the
injury as to causes, in fact shows that the defendant’s conduct,
in point of fact, was not a factor in causing plaintiff’s damage,
the matter ends there, but if it be shown that his conduct was a
factor in causing such damage, then the further would not have
been sustained if the defendant had not been negligent. The
question is whether his conduct played such a part in causing
the damage as would make him the author of such damage and
liable therefor in the eyes of the law. (see 57 Am. Jur. 2d. 543.)
There are rare instances when courts will shift the burden
of proof by requiring defendants to prove they were not the
actual cause.

Example: In Summers vs. Tice (199 Psd. [Cal. 1948].), two
hunters negligently fired while the plaintiff stood in the
line fire. A shotgun pellet hit the plaintiff’s eyes, but it was
impossible to establish which hunter had fired the pellet.
Under a standard “but for’’ analysis, the plaintiff would
be unable to prove more likely than not that either of the
defendants was the cause of the injury. However, neither
defendant was innocent — each having breached a duty
of care to the plaintiff — and the cause of the injury was
necessarily the responsibility of one of them.
In order to solve this dilemma, the court shifted the burden of proof to require the defendants to prove they were
not the cause of the injury. If the defendants were unable
to exculpate themselves, as was the case in Summers, both
defendants would be found liable as joint tortfeasors.

It is important to emphasize that in Summers, the plaintiff
had the obligation to establish that both defendants had breached
a duty of care. Only the burden of proof regarding causation
was shifted. Neither defendant was innocent, although only
one caused the injury.

222

TORTS

Art. 2179

The principle of Summers v. Tice has been adopted by the
Restatement, and is generally accepted where a small number
of defendants have engaged in substantially simultaneous culpable conduct imposing similar risks on the victim. Courts have
also required that all such wrongdoers be joined as defendants.
(Diamond, Levine & Madden, op. cit., p. 195.)

(3) Substantial factor test. — Under this test, if the actor’s
conduct is a substantial factor in bringing about harm to another,
the fact that the actor neither foresaw nor should have foreseen
the extent of the harm or the manner in which it occurred,
does not prevent him from being liable. (57 Am. Jur. 2d 539.)
In order to be a substantial factor in producing the harm, the
causes set in motion by the defendant must continue until the
moment of the damage or at least down the setting in motion
of the final active injurious force which immediately produced
or preceded the damage. (65 C.J.S. 1157.)
In other words, if the harmful result would not have come
about had the defendant not been negligent, his conduct is a
substantial factor and there would be legal causation. Thus,
when this test is utilized, it is also being applied as a test of
actual causation or “cause in fact’’ test.

The subtantial factor test is used by many courts as a supplement to the “but for’’ test when redundant multiple causes
would preclude liability under the “but for’’ analysis.
Example: X starts a fire on the left side of Y’s house
and Z starts a fire on the right side, and both fires merge
concurrently and destroy Y’s house. Neither fire is the “but
for’’ cause of the destruction.
In the absence of either fire, Y’s house would have been
destroyed at the same time by the remaining fire. Because
both causes are redundant, neither is a “but for’’ cause,
a result that potentially precludes the plaintiff’s recovery
against either defendant.

In order to avoid this inequitable result, many courts
including those that adhere to the “but for’’ test, utilize
a “substantial factor’’ test which simply requires that the
defendant materially contributed to the plaintiff’s injury.
(Diamond, Levine & Madden, op. cit., pp. 193-194.)

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

223

(4) Foreseeability test. — According to this test, if the defendant could not reasonably foresee any injury as a result of his act,
or if his conduct was reasonable in the light of what he could
anticipate, there is no negligence, and no liability. (57 Am. Jur.
2d 539.)

Under this test, the defendant is not liable for injurious
consequences which could not have been foreseen or reasonably anticipated under all the facts as they existed. Liability is
limited to the original risk he has created. This test is essentially
similar to the next test.
The forceability test is limited by the additional requirement
that there be superseding intervening force. Intervening forces are
new forces which join with the defendant’s negligence to injure
the plaintiff. Highly improbable and extraordinary intervening
forces are generally found superseding and preclude liability.

Some courts have characterized intervening forces as dependent or independent. A dependent intervening force is
stimulated by the defendant’s negligence while an independent
intervening force is not.
Example: If X knocks Y into the water, Z’s effort to rescue
Y by navigating toward Y is stimulated by X’s earlier negligence and consequently, is a dependent intervening force.

If W, waterskiing, inadvertently collides into Y, W’s
actions were not stimulated by X’s actions, and would be
characterized as an independent intervening force.

While dependent intervening forces are less likely to be
extraordinarily unforeseeable, the terminological distinction by
itself is generally nondeterminative. Ultimately, the characterization of the term “superseding’’ ordinarily depends on how
improbable the intervening force is.
Example: If X drops gasoline carelessly at a service station, fire is a foreseeable type of harm. If Y then carelessly
drops a match that ignites the dropped gasoline, Y is an
intervening force, but not a superseding intervening force,
since such negligence is not extraordinary or highly improbable in this context.
If Y intentionally drops the match, the criminal act of

224

TORTS

Art. 2179

arson is more likely to be characterized as superseding.

However, it would be incorrect to generalize that negligent
acts are not superseding while intentional acts are superseding.
The location of the tort and frequency of crimes, like arson, may
impact on the determination of how extraordinary an intervening force is perceived. Acts of nature, such as storms, may be
superseding, but if the storm should have been anticipated (even
if it is extraordinarily strong), then the storm is nevertheless
foreseeable and hence, not superseding. (Diamond, Levine &
Madden, op. cit., pp. 208-209.)

(5) Natural and probable consequence test. — Where this test is
used, it must appear that the injury was not only the natural but
also the probable consequence of the conduct as distinguished
from consequences that are merely possible. Since what is probable is, in a real sense, foreseeable, foreseeability appears to be
an implicit element of this test of proximate cause.
The general test of human experience that is used to determine what is foreseeable is applied in determining what is
natural and probable. The “natural and probable consequences’’
have been said to be those which human foresight can anticipate because, they happen so frequently, they may be expected
to recur, as contrasted with “possible consequences’’ which are
those that happen so infrequently that they are not expected to
happen again. (57 Am. Jur. 2d 527-530; see Picart v. Smith, 37
Phil. 809 [1918], under doctrine of last clear chance, infra; see
Art 2201, Chap. 2, Part II.)
(6) Direct consequence test. — Under this test, the defendant is liable for all the damage that flows as the ordinary and
natural, or direct consequence of his conduct to be determined
from the circumstances of the case rather than upon whether
he might or must have reasonably expected the resulting injury.
An important difference between the test requiring foreseeability or probability and this test, is that under the first,
recovery may be denied where the consequences of negligence
are so extraordinary or to be deemed merely as possible and
not foreseeable or probable, while under the second, recovery
is allowed although the consequences are most surprising, extraordinary, or bizarre. (57 Am. Jur. 2d 533.)

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

225

Under the direct test, the plaintiff is not concerned with
establishing the foreseeability of the consequences, but must
instead prove the absence of any intervening force. This is in
contrast with the foreseeable type of harm test where the existence of intervening forces does not preclude liability so long
as the type of injury is foreseeable and the intervening force is
not classified as superseding.
Example: The classic English case, In re Polemis, Furnes,
Willy and Co., (3 K.B. 560 [1921].), illustrates a fact pattern
where the plaintiff could establish proximate cause under
the direct test, but not the foreseeable type of harm test. In
Polemis, the servants of the defendant who leased a yacht
dropped a plank, creating a spark that caused petrol fumes
to ignite and the ship to explode.
The explosion was deemed unforeseeable, but the defendant’s servants’ actions were the direct cause of the explosion
because no intervening, force existed.
The defendant in Polemis failed to persuade the court to
replace the then dominant direct test with the foreseeability test,
a development which occurred in later decisions. (Diamond,
Levine & Madden, op. cit., pp. 212-213.)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:

1. The teacher-in-charge, after bringing pupils to an excavation
site dug by them, where several concrete blocks were to be buried, left
them all by themselves, and one of the pupils fell into the pit.

Facts: In 1963, MS was the principal of a public elementary
school while respondent EA was a teacher therein. At that time,
the school was littered with several concrete blocks which were
remnants of the old school shop that was destroyed in World
War II. Realizing that the huge stones were serious hazards to the
schoolchildren, another teacher by the name of SB started burying
them one by one as early as 1962 a year ago. In fact, he was able
to bury 10 of these blocks all by himself.
Deciding to help his colleague, private respondent EA gathered eighteen of his male pupils, aged ten to eleven, after class
dismissal on October 7, 1963. Being their teacher-in-charge, he
ordered them to dig beside a one-ton concrete block in order to
make a hole wherein the stone can be buried. The work was left

226

TORTS

Art. 2179

unfinished. The following day, also after classes, private respondent EA called four of the original eighteen pupils to continue the
digging. These four pupils — RA, FA, IA and NY, dug until the
excavation was one meter and forty centimeters deep. At this
point, private respondent EA alone continued digging while the
pupils remained inside the pit throwing out the loose soil that
was brought about by the digging.

When the depth was right enough to accommodate the concrete block, private respondent EA and his four pupils got out of
the hole. Then, said private respondent left the children to level
the loose soil around the open hole while he went to see SB who
was about thirty meters away. Private respondent wanted to borrow from SB the key to the school workroom where he could get
some rope. Before leaving, private respondent EA allegedly told
the children “not to touch the stone.”

A few minutes after private respondent EA left, three (3) of
the four (4) kids, W, X and Y, playfully jumped into the pit. Then,
without any warning at all, the remaining Z jumped on top of
the concrete block causing it to slide down towards the opening.
W and X were able to scramble out of the excavation on time
but unfortunately for Y, the concrete block caught him before he
could get out, pinning him to the wall in a standing position. As
a result thereof, Y sustained the several injuries. Three (3) days
later, Y died.
Issue: Were there acts and omissions on the part of private
respondent EA amounting to fault or negligence which have direct
causal relation to the death of his pupil Y?
Held: EA is liable for damage.

(1) EA acted with fault and gross negligence. — “From a review of
the record of this case, it is very clear that private respondent EA
acted with fault and gross negligence when he: (1) failed to avail
himself of services of adult manual laborers and instead utilized
his pupils aged ten to eleven to make an excavation near the oneton concrete stone which he knew to be a very hazardous task; (2)
required the children to remain inside the pit even after they had
finished digging, knowing that the huge block was lying nearby
and could be easily pushed or kicked aside by any pupil who
by chance may go to the perilous area; (3) ordered them to level
the soil around the excavation when it was so apparent that the
huge stone was at the brink of falling; (4) went to a place where
he would not be able to check on the children’s safety; and (5)
left the children close to the excavation, an obviously attractive

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

227

nuisance.’’

(2) Negligent act has direct casual connection to the death. — “The
negligent act of private respondent EA in leaving his pupils in
such a dangerous site has a direct causal connection to the death of
the child Y. Left by themselves, it was but natural for the children
to play around. Tired from the strenuous digging, they just had
to amuse themselves with whatever they found. Driven by their
playful and adventurous instincts and not knowing the risk they
were facing, three of them jumped into the hole while the other
one jumped on the stone. Since the stone was so heavy and the
soil was loose from the digging, it was also a natural consequence
that the stone would fall into the hole beside it, causing injury
on the unfortunate child caught by its heavy weight. Everything
that occurred was the natural and probable effect of the negligent
acts of private respondent EA.
Needless to say, the child Y would not have died were it not
for the unsafe situation created by private respondent EA which
exposed the lives of all the pupils concerned to real danger.’’

(3) Y cannot be charged with reckless imprudence. — “We cannot
agree with the finding of the lower court that the injuries which
resulted in the death of the child Y were caused by his own reckless imprudence. It should be remembered that he was only ten
years old at the time of the incident. As such, he is expected to
be playful and daring. His actuations were natural to a boy his
age. Going back to the facts, it was not only him but the three of
them who jumped into the hole while the remaining boy jumped
on the block. From this, it is clear that he only did what any other
ten-year old child would do in the same situation.

In ruling that the child Y was imprudent, it is evident that the
lower court did not consider his age and maturity. This should not
be the case. The degree of care required to be exercised must vary
with the capacity of the person endangered to care for himself. A
minor should not be held to the same degree of care as an adult,
but his conduct should be judged according to the average conduct
of persons of his age and experience. The standard of conduct to
which a child must conform for his own protection is that degree
of care ordinarily exercised by children of the same age, capacity,
discretion, knowledge and experience under the same or similar
circumstances. Bearing this in mind, We cannot charge the child
Y with reckless imprudence.’’
(4) Defendant should have foreseen the danger. — “The contention
that private respondent EA exercised the utmost diligence of a

very cautious person is certainly without cogent basis. A reasonably prudent person would have foreseen that bringing children
to an excavation site, and more so, leaving them there all by
themselves, may result in an accident. An ordinarily careful human being would not assume that a simple warning ‘not to touch
the stone’ is sufficient to cast away all the serious danger that a
huge concrete block adjacent to an excavation would present to
the children.
Moreover, a teacher who stands in loco parentis to his pupils
would have made sure that the children are protected from all
harm in his company.’’ (Ylarde vs. Aquino, 163 SCRA 697 [1988].)

2. At the time of the accident, the driver of the vehicle whose three
(3) passengers and several others were injured, was in violation of the
Land Transportation and Traffic Code.

Facts: This case involves a collision between a Mercedes Benz
panel truck of petitioners and a Cimarron vehicle which caused
the death of three (3) persons and the injuries of several other.

According to petitioner the negligence of the driver of the
Cimarron consisted of the following:
1. The Cimarron was overloaded because there were
from 20 to 25 passengers inside when the passenger capacity
of the vehicle was only 17.
2. The front seat of the Cimarron was occupied by four
(4) adults, including the driver.
3. The Cimarron had only one headlight on (its right
headlight) as its left headlight was not functioning.

Petitioner cites Article III, Sec. 2 of R.A. No. 4136, known
as the “Land Transportation and Traffic Code,’’ which provides that:

“No person operating any vehicle shall allow more
passengers or more freight or cargo in his vehicle than
its registered carry capacity” and Art. IV, Sec. 3(e) which
states that “Every motor vehicle of more than one meter
of projected width, while in use on any public highway
shall bear two headlights ... which not later than one-half
hour after sunset and until at least one-half hour before
sunrise and whenever weather conditions so require, shall
both be lighted.”

Art. 2179

Petitioner asserts that the fact that its panel truck encroached
on a portion of the lane of the Cimarron does not show that its
driver was negligent. Petitioner cites the case of Bayasen vs. Court
of Appeals (103 SCRA 197 [1981].), which allegedly held that the
sudden swerving of a vehicle caused by its driver stepping on
the brakes is not negligence per se. Petitioner further claims that
even if petitioner’s swerving to the lane of respondents were
considered proof of negligence, this fact would not negate the
presumption of negligence on the part of the other driver arising
from his violations of traffic rules and regulations.
Petitioner likewise invokes the ruling in Mckee vs. Intermediate
Appellate Court (211 SCRA 517 [1992].), in which a driver who invaded
the opposite lane and caused a collision between his car and a truck
coming from the opposite lane, was exonerated based on the doctrine
of last clear chance, which states that a person who has the last clear
chance or opportunity of avoiding an accident, notwithstanding the
negligent acts of his opponent, is solely responsible for the consequences of the accident.

Petitioner contends that the ruling in that case should be applied to the present case. According to petitioner, although the
driver of the panel truck was initially negligent, the driver of the
Cimarron had the last opportunity to avoid the accident. However,
because of his negligence (i.e., the aforementioned violations of
traffic rules and regulations such as the use of only one headlight
at night and the overcrowding at the front seat of the vehicle), he
was not able to avoid a collision with the panel truck.
Issues: (1) Whether the driver of the Cimarron was negligent
considering that at the time of the accident he was guilty of traffic
rules and regulations.

(2) Whether the negligence of petitioner’s driver was the
proximate cause of the accident.
Held: (1) Burden of showing casual connection between the injury
and violation of the Land Transportation Code. — “It has not been
shown how the alleged negligence of the Cimarron driver contributed to the collision between the vehicles. Indeed, petitioner
has the burden of showing a causal connection between the injury received and the violation of the Land Transportation and
Traffic Code. He must show that the violation of the statute was
the proximate or legal cause of the injury or that it substantially
contributed thereto.
Negligence, consisting in whole or in part, of violation of law,

230

TORTS

Art. 2179

like any other negligence is without legal consequence unless it
is a contributing cause of the injury. Petitioner says that ‘driving
an overloaded vehicle with only one functioning headlight during
nighttime certainly increases the risk of accident,’ that because
the Cimarron had only one headlight, there was ‘decreased visibility’ and that the fact that the vehicle was overloaded and its
front seat overcrowded ‘decreased [its] maneuverability.’ However,
mere allegations such as these are not sufficient to discharge its
burden of proving clearly that such alleged negligence was the
contributing cause of the injury.’’
(2) Either driver could not have avoided the collision. — “Furthermore, based on the evidence in this case, there was no way
either driver could have avoided the collision. x x x The foregoing
testimonies show that the driver of the panel truck lost control of
his vehicle and bumped the Cimarron. Hence, even if both headlights of the Cimarron were lighted, it would have been bumped
just the same because the driver of the panel truck could not stop
despite the fact that he applied the brakes. Petitioner’s contention
that because of “decreased visibility,’’ caused by the fact that the
Cimarron allegedly had only one headlight on, its driver failed
to see the Cimarron is without any basis in fact. Only its driver
claimed that the Cimarron had only one headlight on.

Nor is there any basis in fact for petitioner’s contention that
because of overcrowding in the front seat of the Cimarron there
was ‘decreased maneuverability’ which prevented the Cimarron
driver from avoiding the panel truck. There is absolutely no basis
for this claim. There is nothing in the testimonies of the passengers
of the Cimarron, particularly Charito Estolano, who was seated
in front, which suggest that the driver had no elbow room for
maneuvering the vehicle. To the contrary, from the testimony of
some of the witnesses, it appears that the driver of the Cimarron
tried to avoid the collision but because of the emergency created
by the speeding panel truck coming from the opposite direction
he was not able to fully move his Cimarron away from the path
of the oncoming vehicle. We are convinced that no ‘maneuvering’
which the Cimarron driver could have done would have avoided a
collision with the panel truck, given the suddenness of the events.
Clearly, the overcrowding in the front seat was immaterial.’’

(3) Negligence of petitioner’s driver was proximate cause of accident. — “All these point to the fact that the proximate cause
of the accident was the negligence of petitioner’s driver. As the
trial court noted, the swerving of petitioner’s panel truck to the

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

231

opposite lane could mean not only that petitioner’s driver was
running the vehicle at a very high speed but that he was tailgating the passenger jeepney ahead of it as well.

Petitioner’s driver claimed that the distance between the panel
truck and the passenger jeepney in front was about 12 meters. If
this was so, he would have had no difficulty bringing his panel
truck to a stop. It is very probable that the driver did not really
apply his brakes (which is why there were no skid marks) but
that finding the jeepney in front of him to be in close proximity,
he tried to avoid hitting it by swerving his vehicle to the left. In
the process, however, he invaded a portion of the opposite lane
and consequently hit the Cimarron. Indeed, the panel truck driver
testified that his vehicle was running at the speed of 60 miles
per hour. He tried to correct himself when asked by petitioner’s
counsel whether the panel truck speedometer indicated miles or
kilometers by saying that the speedometer measured kilometers and
not miles, but on cross examination his testimony got muddled.
Be that as it may, whether the driver meant 60 miles per hour
(which could be 96.77 kilometers per hour) or 60 kilometers per
hour, the fact remains that the panel truck was overspeeding
because the maximum allowable speed for trucks and buses on
open country roads, such as the Aguinaldo Highway in Imus,
Cavite, is only 50 kilometers per hour.’’
(4) Bayasen case not applicable. — “The case of Bayasen, which
petitioner invokes, cannot apply to this case. There was no swerving of the vehicle in that case but skidding, and it was caused
by the fact that the road was wet and slippery. In this case, the
road was dry and safe. There was no reason for the vehicle to
swerve because of road condition. The only explanation for this
occurrence was human error.’’

(5) Reliance on McKee case misplaced. — “Petitioner’s reliance
on the McKee case is also misplaced. In that case, the driver of
the vehicle at fault, a truck, had an opportunity to avoid the collision but he ignored the signals from the other vehicle, a car, to
slow down and allow it to safely pass the bridge. In this case,
there was no such opportunity given the Cimarron on the night
of the mishap. Everything happened so quickly that before the
passengers of the Cimarron knew it, the vehicle had been bumped
by the truck.’’ (Sanitary Steam Laundry, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals,

3. Petitioner, owner of furniture manufacturing shop, failed to
construct a firewall as required by city ordinance, as a result of which
the fire that broke out in the shop spread to an adjacent house.

Facts: The furniture manufacturing shop of petitioner was situated adjacent to the residence of private respondents. Sometime
in August 1971, private respondent GM first approached EC, petitioner’s plant manager, to request that a firewall be constructed
between the shop and private respondents’ residence. The request
was repeated several times but they fell on deaf ears.

In the early morning of September 6, 1974, fire broke out in
petitioner’s shop. Petitioner’s employees, who slept in the shop
premises, tried to put out the fire, but their efforts proved futile.
The fire spread to private respondents’ house. Both the shop and
the house were razed to the ground. The cause of the conflagration
was never discovered. The National Bureau of Investigation found
specimens from the burned structures negative for the presence
of inflammable substances.
Issues: (1) Is the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applicable to the
instant case?

(2) Would the failure of petitioner to construct a firewall in
accordance with city ordinances suffice to support a finding of
negligence?

Held: (1) Facts of the case call for application of doctrine of ipsa
loquitur. — “The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, whose application
to the instant case petitioner objects to, may be stated as follows:
‘Where the thing which caused the injury complained of is shown
to be under the management of the defendant or his servants and
the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not
happen if those who have its management or control use proper
care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose from want of care.’
[Africa v. Caltex (Phil.), Inc., G.R. No. L-12986, March 31, 1966,
16 SCRA 448.]
Thus, in Africa, supra, where fire broke out in a Caltex service
station while gasoline from a tank truck was being unloaded into
an underground storage tank through a hose and the fire spread to
and burned neighboring houses, this Court, applying the doctrine
of res ipsa loquitur, adjudged Caltex liable for the loss.

The facts of the case likewise call for the application of the
doctrine, considering that in the normal course of operations of

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

233

a furniture manufacturing shop, combustible material such as
wood chips, sawdust, paint, varnish and fuel and lubricants for
machinery may be found thereon.’’
(2) Failure to construct a firewall was an act of negligence. — “It
must also be noted that negligence or want of care on the part of
petitioner or its employees was not merely presumed. The Court of
Appeals found that petitioner failed to construct a firewall between
its shop and the residence of private respondents as required by
a city ordinance; that the fire could have been caused by a heated
motor or a lit cigarette; that gasoline and alcohol were used and
stored in the shop; and that workers sometimes smoked inside
the shop.

Even without applying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, petitioner’s failure to construct a firewall in accordance with city
ordinances would suffice to support a finding of negligence.’’ (F.F.
Cruz and Co. vs. Court of Appeals, 164 SCRA 731 [1988].)

4. At the time of the fire, petitioner’s building had only one stairway in the second storey, a violation of the city ordinance, although a
second stairway was under construction.

Facts: At about 4 o’clock in the afternoon a fire broke out in
a store of surplus materials across the street, located about 10
meters away from the vocational school of MMT.

Upon seeing the fire, some of the students in the Realistic
Institute shouted ‘Fire! Fire!’ and thereafter, a panic ensued. Four
instructresses and six assistant instructresses of the Institute were
present and they, together with the registrar, tried to calm down
the students, who numbered about 180 at the time, telling them
not to be afraid because the Gil-Armi Building would not get
burned as it is made of concrete, and that the fire was anyway,
across the street. They told the students not to rush out but just
to go down the stairway two by two, or to use the fire-escapes.
Mrs. JP, one of the instructresses, took to the microphone so as
to convey to the students the above admonitions more effectively,
and she even slapped three students in order to quiet them down.
Miss FM, the registrar, whose desk was near the stairway, stood
up and tried with outstretched arms to stop the students from
rushing and pushing their way to the stairs. The panic, however,
could not be subdued and the students, with the exception of the
few who made use of fire-escapes, kept on rushing and pushing

234

TORTS

Art. 2179

their way through the stairs, thereby causing stampede therein.

Indeed, no part of the Gil-Armi Building caught fire. But,
after the panic was over, four students, including LF, a sister of
plaintiffs-appellants, were found dead and several others injured
on account of the stampede.
There was violation of Section 491 of the Revised Ordinances
of the City of Manila consisting in the fact that the second storey
of the Gil-Armi building had only one stairway 1.5 meters wide,
instead of two of at least 1.2 meters each, although at the time of
the fire the owner of the building had a second stairway under
construction.

The petitioner relates the chain of events that resulted in
the death of LF as follows: (1) violation of ordinance; (2) fire at
a neighboring place; (3) shouts of “Fire! Fire!”; (4) panic in the
Institute; (5) stampede; and (6) injuries and death.
As thus projected, the violation of the ordinance, it is argued,
was only a remote cause, if at all, and cannot be the basis of liability since there intervened a number of independent causes
which produced the injury complained of.

Issue: Whether or not the failure to comply with the requirement of the ordinance was the proximate cause of the death of LF.

Held: (1) Where a cause intervened between prior cause and injury. — “A prior and remote cause cannot be made the basis of
an action if such remote cause did nothing more than furnish the
condition or give rise to the occasion by which the injury was
made possible, if there intervened between such prior or remote
cause and the injury a distinct, successive unrelated, and efficient
cause of the injury, even though such injury would not have happened but for such condition or occasion.

If no danger existed in the condition except because of the
independent cause, such condition was not the proximate cause.
And if an independent negligent act or defective condition sets
into operation the circumstances which result in injury because
of the prior defective condition, such subsequent act or condition
is the proximate cause.’’
(2) Petitioner’s violation of ordinance was a continuing one. — “According to the petitioner ‘the events of fire, panic and stampede
were independent causes with no causal connection at all with
the violation of the ordinance.’ The weakness in the argument
springs from a faulty juxtaposition of the events which formed a

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

235

chain and resulted in the injury.

It is true that the petitioner’s non-compliance with the ordinance in question was ahead of and prior to the other events
in point of time, in the sense that it was coetaneous with its occupancy of the building. But the violation was a continuing one,
since the ordinance was a measure of safety designed to prevent
a specific situation which would pose a danger to the occupants
of the building. That situation was undue overcrowding in case it
should become necessary to evacuate the building, which, it could
be reasonably foreseen, was bound to happen under emergency
conditions if there was only one stairway available.’’

(3) Doctrine of proximate cause applies to petitioner’s violation. —
“It is true that in this particular case there would have been no
overcrowding in the single stairway if there had not been a fire
in the neighborhood which caused the students to panic and rush
headlong for the stairs in order to go down. But it was precisely
such contingencies or events that the authors of the ordinance
had in mind, for under normal conditions one stairway would
be adequate for the occupants of the building.
Thus, as stated in 38 American Jurisprudence, page 841: ‘The
general principle is that the violation of a statute or ordinance is
not rendered remote as the cause of an injury by the intervention
of another agency if the occurrence of the accident, in the manner
in which it happened, was the very thing which the statute or
ordinance was intended to prevent.’

To consider the violation of the ordinance as the proximate
cause of the injury does not portray the situation in its true perspective; it would be more accurate to say that the overcrowding
at the stairway was the proximate cause and that it was precisely
what the ordinance intended to prevent by requiring that there be
two stairways instead of only one. Under the doctrine of the cases
cited by the respondents, the principle of proximate cause applies
to such violation.’’ (Teague vs. Fernandez, 51 SCRA 181 [1973].)

with the possibility of coming in contact with a highly charged

was due to an excusable cause, causing his death by electrocution, Meralco was not liable because the defective condition of
the wire was only the remote cause of the electrocution, the

police telephone box, and because of the noise caused thereby,
the horse was frightened and it ran away and C, one of the
passengers jumped or was thrown out, and was killed, A’s act
in stopping the horse was held as not the proximate cause of
the accident. (Gabeto vs. Araneta, 42 Phil. 232 [1921].)
(11) Where a boy, 15 years old, who found a fulminating

(13) Where the driver of a passenger jeep while being driven

the tragedy, may occur without fault. (Bayasen vs. Court of
Appeals, 103 SCRA 197 [1981].)
(14) Where defendant ordered his cargador, who had only
a student’s permit to drive his truck, and a policeman who
boarded the truck took the wheel, and while driving the truck,
it hit and ran over a pedestrian, the proximate immediate and
direct cause of the death was the negligence of the policeman.
There was no direct and proximate casual connection between
the defendant’s negligence and the death. (Gregorio vs. Go, 102
Phil. 556 [1958].)
Note: For other rulings, see Article 2176.

Doctrine of contributory negligence.
(1) Meaning. — The term has been defined as “conduct on
the part of the injured party, contributing as a legal cause to the
harm he has suffered, which falls below the standard to which
he is required to conform for his own protection.’’ (Valenzuela
vs. Court of Appeals, 68 SCAD 113, 253 SCRA 303 [1996].)

The above definition does not indicate the extent or nature
of the plaintiff’s negligence. Note that Article 2179 expressly
uses the words “immediate and proximate’’ in the first sentence,
thereby implying that contributory negligence mentioned in the
second sentence contemplates negligence of the plaintiff that is
not proximate.
Therefore, contributory negligence under Article 2179 means
negligence on the part of the injured party which merely contributes to, but is not the proximate cause of, his injury, and results
in the mitigation of the defendant’s liability and the plaintiff’s
indemnity. This is consistent with Article 2214 (Part II, Chap. 2.)
which states that “in quasi-delicts, the contributory negligence

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

239

of the plaintiff shall reduce the damages that he may recover.’’

The underlying precept of Article 2179 on contributory
negligence is that the plaintiff who is partly responsible for
his own injury should not be entitled to recover damages in
full but must bear the consequences of his own negligence.
The defendant must thus be held liable only for the damages
actually caused by his negligence. (Syki vs. Beyasa, 414 SCRA
237 [2003].)
(2) Rule under common law. — Under the common law doctrine, contributory negligence was a complete defense to an
action based on negligence, at least prior to 1945 in England
and 1908 in the United States.

It has been said that the defense is based on the assumption
that a court of law cannot apportion the damages arising from
as injury caused by the cooperative negligence of both, and
that until satisfactory means were devised for this purpose, in
cases where an injury is caused by the concurring negligence
of two or more defendants, each must be held liable for all the
damages thus caused, in accordance with the rule that where
the negligence of two wrongdoers contributes to a single injury,
each is liable for the resulting harm. (57 Am. Jur. 2d. 685.)

(3) Doctrine of comparative negligence. — The doctrine contributory negligence has been criticized as overly harsh. It has been
modified by the doctrine of comparative negligence under which
a comparison is made in terms of the degree of the negligence
of the plaintiff and that of the defendant and the amount of
damages recoverable by the plaintiff is reduced to the extent
of his negligence. This is considered a more equitable system
of apportioning liability for damages.
The pure form of this doctrine allows the plaintiff to recover
regardless of the extent of his negligence. Under the modified
form, the plaintiff can recover only if his negligence is less than
or equals that of the defendant. Expressed in terms of percentages, a plaintiff who is charged with 80% of the total negligence,
can recover only 20% of his damages.

(4) Rule followed in our jurisdiction. — What is applicable in our
jurisdiction is the “modified’’ form of comparative negligence. This

240

TORTS

Art. 2179

is evident from the language of Article 2179. When negligence of
the plaintiff is the sole cause or the proximate cause of his injury,
he cannot recover, but if his negligence only contributes remotely
or otherwise but not proximately, to his injury, he is deemed partly
responsible and his recovery shall be diminished in proportion to
the amount of fault attributable to him.
In other words, under our law, a plaintiff whose negligence
is relatively “slight,’’ or “minor,’’ or is “remote,’’ or “less in degree,’’ or “not greater’’ than that of the defendant, can recover.
So, the fact that the plaintiff is equally responsible as the defendant, does not preclude a recovery under Article 2179 unless
his negligence was the direct or proximate cause of his injury.
The doctrine as land down in Rakes vs. Atlantic Gulf & Pacific Co. (7 Phil. 359 [1907], infra.; see Taylor vs. Manila Electric
Railroad and Light Co., 16 Phil. 8 [1907].) is as follows:

“Difficulty seems to be apprehended in deciding which
acts of the injured party shall be considered immediate
causes of the accident. The test is simple. Distinction must
be made between the accident and the injury, between the
event itself, without which there could have been no accident, and those acts of the victim not entering into it,
independent of it, but contributing to his own proper hurt.
For instance, the cause of the accident under review was
the displacement of the crosspiece or the failure to replace it.
This produced the event giving occasion for damages — that
is, sinking of the track and the sliding of the iron rails. To
this event, the act of the plaintiff in walking by the side of
the car did not contribute, although it was an element of the
damage which came to himself. Had the crosspiece been out
of place wholly or partly through this act or omission of duty,
that would have been one of the determining causes of the
event or accident, for which he would have been responsible.

Where he contributes to the principal occurrence, as one
of its determining factors, he can not recover. Where, in
conjunction with the occurrence, he contributes only to his
own injury, he may recover the amount that the defendant
responsible for the event should pay for such injury, less a
sum deemed a suitable equivalent for his own imprudence.”

ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. Meralco was advised by telephone that an electrical wire fell to
the ground and before any one representing the company appeared on the
scene, a child touched the broken electrical wire and was electrocuted.

Facts: Shortly after 2 o’clock on the afternoon, trouble developed in a wire used by the defendant on Dimasalang Street for
the purpose of conducting electricity used in lighting the City of
Manila and its suburbs. JN, who had charge of a tienda nearby,
first noticed that the wire was burning and its connections smoking. JN ask JS to telephone the Malabon Station of the defendant
company. JS transmitted the message at 2:25 p.m. and received
answer from the station to the effect that they would send an
inspector. At the time that message was sent the wire had not
yet parted.
At 4 p.m. the neighborhood school was dismissed and the
children went home. Among these was ADR, of the age of 9 years,
who was a few paces ahead of two other boys, all members of the
second grade in the public school. These other two boys were JS,
of the age of 8, and SE, of the age of 10. As the three neared the
place where the wire was down, S made a motion as if to touch it.
His companion, JS, happened to be the son of an electrician and his
father had cautioned him never to touch a broken electrical wire, as
it might have a current. JS, therefore, stopped S, telling him that the
wire might be charged. S yielded to this admonition and desisted
from his design, but ADR, who was somewhat ahead, said, ‘I have
for some time been in the habit of touching wires’ (‘Yo desde hace
tiempo cojo alambres’).

JS rejoined that he should not touch wires as they carry a
current, but ADR, no doubt feeling that he was challenged in
the matter, put out his index finger and touch the wire. He immediately fell face downwards, exclaiming “Ay! madre.” The end
of the wire remained in contact with his body which fell near
the post. A crowd soon collected, and someone cut the wire and
disengaged the body. Upon being taken to St. Luke’s Hospital,
the child was pronounced dead.
The wire was an ordinary number 6 triple weather proof
wire, such as is commonly used by the defendant company for
the purpose of conducting electricity for lighting. The wire was
cased in the usual covering, but this had been burned off for
some distance from the point where the wire parted. The engineer of the company says that it was customary for the company

242

TORTS

Art. 2179

to make a special inspection of these wires at least once in six
months, and that all of the company’s inspectors were required
in their daily rounds to keep a lookout for trouble of this kind.
There is nothing in the record indicating any particular cause for
the parting of the wire.
Issues: (1) Has the defendant overcome the presumption of
negligence on its part from the breakage of the wire?
(2) Can contributory negligence he imputed to the child?

Held: (1) Presumption of negligence not overcome. — “We are of
the opinion that the presumption of negligence on the part of the
company from the breakage of this wire has not been overcome,
and the defendant is in our opinion responsible for the accident.
Furthermore, when notice was received at the Malabon station at
2:25 p.m., somebody should have been dispatched to the scene of
the trouble at once, or other measures taken to guard the point
of danger; but more than an hour and a half passed before anyone representing the company appeared on the scene, and in the
meantime this child had been claimed as a victim.’’

(2) Child not guilty of contributory negligence. — “It is doubtful
whether contributory negligence can properly be imputed to the
deceased, owing to his immature years and the natural curiosity
which a child would feel to do something out of the ordinary, and
the mere fact that the deceased ignored the caution of a companion of the age of 8 years does not, in our opinion, alter the case.
But even supposing that contributory negligence could in some
measure be properly imputed to the deceased, — a proposition
upon which the members of the court do not all agree, — yet such
negligence would not be wholly fatal to the right of action in this
case, not having been the determining cause of the accident.’’ (Del
Rosario vs. Manila Electric Co., 57 Phil. 478 [1932].)

2. At the time of the collision, the ship master was playing mahjong and the officer on watch failed to call his attention to the imminent
danger.

Facts: M/V Don Juan owned by petitioner NENACO collided off the Tablan Strait in Mindoro, with M/T Tacloban City,
an oil tanker owned by PNOC. As a result, MV/Don Juan sank.
Several of her passengers perished in the sea tragedy, including
four members of private respondents‘ families.

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

243

In finding petitioner guilty of negligence and in failing to
exercise the extraordinary diligence required of it in the carriage
of passengers, both the trial court and the appellate court relied
on the findings of this Court in Mecenas vs. Intermediate Appellate
Court (180 SCRA 83 [1989].), which case was brought for the death
of other passengers. In that case, it was found that although the
proximate cause of the mishap was the negligence of the crew
of the M/T Tacloban City, the crew of the Don Juan was equally
negligent as it found that the latter’s master, Capt. RS, was playing
mahjong at the time of collision, and the officer on watch, Senior
Third Mate RV, admitted that he failed to call the attention of RS
to the imminent danger facing them. The Supreme Court found
that Capt. RS and the crew of the M/V Don Juan failed to take
steps to prevent the collision or at least delay the sinking of the
ship and supervise the abandoning of the ship.
Petitioner Negros Navigation was found equally negligent in
tolerating the playing of mahjong by the ship captain and other
crew members while on board the ship and failing to keep the
M/V Don Juan seaworthy so much so that the ship sank within
10 to 15 minutes of its impact with the M/T Tacloban City.

In addition, the Court found that the Don Juan was overloaded.
The Certificate of Inspection, dated August 27, 1979, issued by the
Philippine Coast Guard Commander at Iloilo City stated that the
total number of persons allowed on the ship was 864, of whom
810 are passengers, but there were actually 1,004 on board the
vessel when it sank, 140 persons more than the maximum number
that could be safely carried by it.
Issue: Was M/VDon Juan guilty of CN?

Held: (1) Don Juan could have avoided collision with exercise of
ordinary diligence. — “Taking these circumstances together, and
the fact that the M/V Don Juan, as the faster and better-equipped
vessel, could have avoided a collision with the PNOC tanker, this
Court held that even if the Tacloban City had been at fault for
failing to observe an internationally-recognized rule of navigation,
the Don Juan was guilty of contributory negligence.
Through Justice F, this Court held:

‘The grossness of the negligence of the Don Juan is underscored when one considers the foregoing circumstances in
the context of the following facts: Firstly, the Don Juan was
more than twice as fast as the Tacloban City. The Don Juan’s
top speed was 17 knots; while that of the Tacloban City was

244

TORTS

Art. 2179

6.3 knots. Secondly, the Don Juan carried the full complement
of officers and crew members specified for a passenger vessel
of her class. Thirdly, the Don Juan was equipped with radar
which was functioning that night. Fourthly, the Don Juan’s
officer on-watch had sighted the Tacloban City on his radar
screen while the latter was still four (4) nautical miles away.
Visual confirmation of radar contact was established by the
Don Juan while the Tacloban City was still 2.7 miles away. In
the total set of circumstances which existed in the instant case,
the Don Juan, had it taken seriously its duty of extraordinary
diligence, could have easily avoided the collision with the
Tacloban City. Indeed, the Don Juan might well have avoided
the collision even if it had exercised ordinary diligence merely.’’

(2) Failure to (by MV/Tacloban) observe rule of navigation city
would not relieve MV/Don Juan from responsibility. — “It is true that
the Tacloban City failed to follow Rule 18 of the International
Rules of the Road which requires two (2) power-driven vessels
meeting end on or nearly end on each to alter her course to starboard (right) so that each vessel may pass on the port side (left)
of the other. The Tacloban City, when the two (2) vessels were
only three-tenths (0.3) of a mile apart, turned (for the second time)
15º to port side while the Don Juan veered hard to starboard .
. . [But] route observance of the International Rules of the Road
will not relieve a vessel from responsibility if the collision could
have been avoided by proper care and skill on her part or even
by a departure from the rules.’’
(3) MV/Don Juan negligent in failing to take early preventive action. — “In the petition at bar, the Don Juan having sighted the
Tacloban City when it was still a long way off was negligent in
failing to take early preventive action and in allowing the two (2)
vessels to come to such close quarters as to render the collision
inevitable when there was no necessity for passing so near to the
Tacloban City as to create that hazard or inevitability, for the Don
Juan could choose its own distance.
It is noteworthy that the Tacloban City, upon turning hard to
port shortly before the moment of collision, signalled its intention
to do so by giving two (2) short blasts with its horn. The Don
Juan gave no answering horn blast to signal its own intention and
proceeded to turn hard to starboard.’’
(4) Issue was cause of sinking of M/VDon Juan, not merits of
individual claims. — “Petitioner criticizes the lower court’s reliance

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

245

on the M case, arguing that, although this case arose out of the
same incident as that involved in M, the parties are different and
trial was conducted separately. Petitioner contends that the decision in this case should be based on the allegations and defenses
pleaded and evidence adduced in it or, in short, on the record of
this case.

The contention is without merit. What petitioner contends
may be true with respect to the merits of the individual claims
against petitioner but not as to the cause of the sinking of its ship
on April 22, 1980 and its liability for such accident, of which there
can only be one truth. Otherwise, one would be subscribing to
the sophistry: truth on one side of the Pyrenees, falsehood on the
other.’’ (Negros Navigation Co., Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 88 SCAD

3. Jeep of private respondents fell into an open excavation when
the jeep swerved from the inside lane of the street, respondents being
aware of the presence of said excavation.

Facts: Private respondents, spouses, sustained injuries when
their jeep ran over a mound of earth and fell into an open trench,
an excavation allegedly undertaken by PLDT for the installation
of its underground conduit system.
The evidence showed that:

“First. plaintiffs’ jeep was running along the inside lane of
Lacson Street. If it had remained on that inside lane, it would
not have hit the ACCIDENT MOUND. x x x

“Second. That plaintiff’s Jeep was on the inside lane before
it swerved to hit the ACCIDENT MOUND could have been
corroborated by a picture showing Lacson Street to the south
of the ACCIDENT MOUND. x x x

“Third. Plaintiff’s jeep was not running at 25 kilometers
an hour as plaintiff-husband claimed. At that speed, he could
have braked the vehicle the moment it struck the ACCIDENT
MOUND. The jeep would not have climbed the ACCIDENT
MOUND several feet as indicated by the tiremarks in Exhibit
B. The jeep must have been running quite fast. If the jeep had
been braked at 25 kilometers an hour, plaintiffs would not
have been thrown against the windshield and they would
not have suffered their injuries. x x x

246

TORTS

Art. 2179

“Fourth. If the accident did not happen because the jeep
was running quite fast on the inside lane and for some reason
or other it had to swerve suddenly to the right and had to
climb over the ACCIDENT MOUND, then plaintiff-husband
had not exercised the diligence of a good father of a family
to avoid the accident. With the drizzle, he should not have
run on dim lights, but should have put on his regular lights
which should have made him see the ACCIDENT MOUND in
time. If he was running on the outside lane at 25 kilometers
an hour, even on dim lights, his failure to see the ACCIDENT
MOUND in time to brake the car was negligence on his part.
The ACCIDENT MOUND was relatively big and visible,
being 2 to 3 feet high and 1-1/2 feet wide. If he did not see
the ACCIDENT MOUND in time, he would not have seen any
warning sign either. He knew of the existence and location
of the ACCIDENT MOUND, having seen it many previous
times. With ordinary precaution, he should have driven his
jeep on the night of the accident so as to avoid hitting the
ACCIDENT MOUND.”
Issue: Whose negligence was responsible for the accident?

Held: (1) Respondents’ negligence was not only contributory. — “The
above findings clearly show that the negligence of respondent Antonio Esteban was not only contributory to his injuries and those
of his wife but goes to the very cause of the occurrence of the
accident, as one of its determining factors, and thereby precludes
their right to recover damages. The perils of the road were known
to, hence, appreciated and assumed by, private respondents.

By exercising reasonable care and prudence, respondent
Antonio Esteban could have avoided the injurious consequences
of his act, even assuming arguendo that there was some alleged
negligence on the part of petitioner.’’

(2) Presence of warning signs could not have completely prevented
the accident. — “The presence of warning signs could not have
completely prevented the accident; the only purpose of said signs
was to inform and warn the public of the presence of excavations
on the site. The private respondents already knew of the presence
of said excavations. It was not the lack of knowledge of these
excavations which caused the jeep of respondents to fall into the
excavation but the unexplained sudden swerving of the jeep from
the inside lane towards the accident mound.
As opined in some quarters, the omission to perform a duty,

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

247

such as the placing of warning signs on the site of the excavation, constitutes the proximate cause only when the doing of the
said omitted act would have prevented the injury. It is basic that
private respondents cannot charge PLDT for their injuries where
their own failure to exercise due and reasonable care was the cause
thereof. It is both a societal norm and necessity that one should
exercise a reasonable degree of caution for his own protection.’’

(3) Respondent had the last clear chance to avoid accident. — “Furthermore, respondent Antonio Esteban had the last clear chance or
opportunity to avoid the accident, notwithstanding the negligence
he imputes to petitioner PLDT. As a resident of Lacson Street,
he passed on that street almost everyday and had knowledge
of the presence and location of the excavations there. It was his
negligence that exposed him and his wife to danger, hence, he is
solely responsible for the consequences of his imprudence.’’
(4) Need for carefully evaluating testimonial evidence of respondents. — “There was no eyewitness of the accident. As to how
the accident occurred, the Court can only rely on the testimonial
evidence of plaintiffs themselves, and such evidence should be
very carefully evaluated, with defendant, as the party being
charged, being given the benefit of any doubt. Definitely without
ascribing the same motivation to plaintiffs, another person could
have deliberately engineered a similar accident in the hope and
expectation that the Court can grant him substantial moral and
exemplary damages from the big corporation that defendant is.
The statement is made only to stress the disadvantageous
position of defendant which would have extreme difficulty in
contesting such person’s claim. If there were no witness or record available from the police department of Bacolod, defendant
would not be able to determine for itself which of the conflicting
testimonies of plaintiffs is correct as to the report or non-report
of the accident to the police department.”

(5) Burden of proof in negligence cases. — “A person claiming
damages for the negligence of another has the burden of proving
the existence of such fault or negligence causative thereof. The
facts constitutive of negligence must be affirmatively established
by competent evidence. Whosoever relies on negligence for his
cause of action has the burden in the first instance of proving the
existence of the same if contested, otherwise his action must fail.’’

Brief rulings on contributory negligence.
(1) There is nothing abnormal in allowing a child to run
along a few paces in advance of her while passing along a public
street. No one could foresee the coincidence of an automobile
appearing and of a frightened child running and falling into a
ditch filled with hot water flowing from the electric and ice-plant
of the defendant. (Bernal vs. House, et al., 54 Phil. 327 [1950].)
(2) A person boarding a moving car must be taken to assume
the risk of injury from boarding the car under the conditions
open to his view, but he cannot fairly be held to assume the risk
that the motorman, having the situation in view, will increase
his peril by accelerating the speed of the car before he is planted
safely on the platform. (Del Prado vs. Manila Electric Co., 52
Phil. 900 [1929].)

(3) Where two automobiles, going in opposite directions,
collide on turning a street corner, and it appears from the evidence that the drivers were equally negligent and contributed
equally to the collision, neither can recover from the other for
the damages suffered. (Bernardo vs. Legaspi, 29 Phil. 12 [1914].)
(4) Where defendant failed in its duty to maintain its tracks in
reasonably sound condition, which sagged due to the dislodging of the crosspiece or piling under the stringer by the water
of Manila Bay raised by a recent typhoon, as a result of which
the plaintiff, one of defendant’s laborers, broke his leg which
was afterwards amputated, but there was a general prohibition
made known to all against walking near the place where the
accident occurred. (Rakes vs. Atlantic Gulf & Pacific Company,
7 Phil. 359 [1907].)

(5) Where, W, while under the influence of liquor, was
driving a calesa, when its wheels struck the streetcar railroad
tracks which were above the level of the street, as a result of
which the horse slumbled, and W fell, thus injuring himself,
for mere intoxication does not establish negligence. If a person’s conduct is characterized by a proper degree of care, it is
immaterial whether he is drunk or sober. (Wright vs. Manila
Electric Railroad & Light Co., 28 Phil. 122 [1914].)
(6) Where the train boarded by the deceased was so overcrowded that he and many other passengers had no choice but

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

249

to sit on the open platform between the coaches of the train, but
the deceased “should have held tightly and tenaciously on the
upright metal bar found at the side of said platform to avoid
falling off from the speeding train.’’ (Phil. National Railways
vs. Court of Appeals, 139 SCRA 87 [1985].)
Note: For other rulings, see Article 2176.
Doctrine of last clear chance.
(1) Meaning. — The doctrine, stated broadly, is that the
negligence of the plaintiff does not preclude a recovery for the
negligence of the defendant where it appears that the defendant, by exercising reasonable care and prudence, might have
avoided injurious consequences to the plaintiff notwithstanding
the plaintiff’s negligence.
In other words, the doctrine of last clear chance means that
even though a person’s own acts may have placed him in a
position of peril, and an injury results, the injured person is
entitled to recovery. As the doctrine is usually stated, a person
who has the last clear chance or opportunity of avoiding an
accident, notwithstanding the negligent acts of his opponent, or
that of a third person imputed to the opponent, is considered
in law solely responsible for the consequences of the accident.

The practical import of the doctrine is that a negligent
defendant is held liable to a negligent plaintiff, or even to a
plaintiff who has been grossly negligent in placing himself in
peril, if he, aware of the plaintiff’s peril, or according to some
authorities, should have been aware of it in the reasonable exercise of due care, had, in fact, an opportunity later than that
of the plaintiff to avoid an accident. (Bustamante vs. Court of
Appeals, 193 SCRA 603 [1991]; 57 Am. Jur. 2d 798-799.) Stated
differently, the antecedent negligence of the plaintiff does not
preclude him from recovering damages caused by the supervening negligence of the defendant who had the last fair chance to
prevent the impending harm by the exercise of due diligence.
(Phil. Bank of Commerce vs. Court of Appeals, 269 SCRA 695
[1997].)
(2) Elements. — The doctrine may be invoked by the injured

250

TORTS

Art. 2179

person, if the following facts are present.

(a) That the plaintiff was in a position of danger and,
by his own negligence, became unable to escape from such
position by the use of ordinary care, either because it became
physically impossible for him to do so or because he was
totally unaware of the danger;

(b) The defendant knew that the plaintiff was in a
position of danger and further knew, or in the exercise of
ordinary care should have known, that the plaintiff was
unable to escape therefrom; and
(c) That thereafter defendant had the last clear chance
to avoid the accident by the exercise of ordinary care but
failed to exercise such last clear chance, and the accident
occurred as a proximate result of such failure. (57 Am. Jur.
2d 807.)

(3) Defenses available to defendant. — Although a defendant
may not invoke the doctrine, it does not preclude him from
proving that the plaintiff had the last clear opportunity to avert
the injury complained of and thus, establish that the plaintiff
was guilty of contributory negligence which proximately caused
the accident and consequently, bars plaintiff’s recovery.

Even in a case where plaintiff invokes the doctrine as his sole
cause of action, it does not eliminate the defense of plaintiff’s
sole negligence or contributory negligence. In such a case, where
it appears that the plaintiff was not oblivious to his peril, or
was able to escape the danger, or has as late an opportunity as
had the defendant to avoid it, there results an absence of one
essential element of the doctrine which precludes its application
to the plaintiff’s favor.
Nor may the doctrine be applied in plaintiff’s favor where
the defendant had no clear chance to avert injury to the plaintiff
whose own negligence created his peril, since the defendant’s
opportunity to avert the injury must be not only the “last’’
chance but a “clear’’ chance. (J. Cezar S. Sangco, p. 169, citing
Annotation; 32 ALR 2d 547.)

(4) Applications of the doctrine. — The doctrine has been
applied in the United States to cases which fit into one of the

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

251

four (4) following categories:

(a) Where plaintiff is in peril and is unable to get out of
it by the exercise of reasonable care, and defendant knows
plaintiff’s position and either realizes or has reason to realize
the danger to plaintiff, and thereafter could have avoided
the injury by the use of reasonable care.
(b) Where plaintiff is similarly in helpless peril, and
defendant though he did not discover plaintiff, would have
discovered and appreciated plaintiff’s danger in time to avoid
injuring him by the use of reasonable care, had defendant
exercised the vigilance which the law required of him for
plaintiff’s protection.
(c) Where plaintiff himself could avoid danger by checking his approach to it or by stepping out of its path but fails
to do so because of negligent inattention, and defendant
knows plaintiff’s position and realizes or has reason to realize his inattention, and after such knowledge and (actual or
constructive) realization could have avoided injury by the
use of reasonable care.

(d) Where both plaintiff and defendant are negligently
inattentive, but defendant would have discovered and realized plaintiff’s danger, had he exercised the vigilance he
owed to plaintiff, in time to avoid injuring plaintiff by the
use of reasonable care. (Harper & James, op. cit., p. 1245.)
It has been held that the doctrine is not applicable in a case of
culpa contractual. (see Consolidated Bank and Trust Corpo-ration
vs. Court of Appeals, 410 SCRA 562 [2003], under Art. 2178.)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:

1. Respondent’s car collided with a dump truck that was parked
in such a manner as to stick out onto the street, partly blocking the
way of oncoming traffic.

Facts: At about 1:30 a.m., Dionisio was driving his car, when
his car headlights (in his allegation) suddenly failed. He switched
his headlights on “bright” and thereupon he saw a Ford dump
truck looming some 2-1/2 meters away from his car. The dump
truck, owned by and registered in the name of petitioner Phoenix
Construction Inc. (“Phoenix”), was parked on the right hand side

252

TORTS

Art. 2179

of General Lacuna Street (i.e., on the right hand side of a person
facing in the same direction toward which Dionisio’s car was
proceeding), facing the oncoming traffic.

The dump truck was parked askew (not parallel to the street
curb) in such a manner as to stick out onto the street, partly blocking the way of oncoming traffic. The dump truck had earlier that
evening been driven home by petitioner Armando U. Carbonel,
its regular driver, with the permission of his employer Phoenix,
in view of work scheduled to be carried out early the following
morning. Dionisio claimed that he tried to avoid a collision by
swerving his car to the left but it was too late and his car smashed
into the dump truck.
As a result of the collision, Dionisio suffered some physical
injuries including some permanent facial scars, a “nervous breakdown” and loss of two gold bridge dentures.
The petitioners Phoenix and Carbonel contend that if there was
negligence in the manner in which the dump truck was parked,
that negligence was merely a “passive and static condition” and
that private respondent Dionisio’s recklessness constituted an
intervening, efficient cause determinative of the accident and the
injuries he sustained.

There were four (4) factual issues that were looked into and
it was established that: (a) Dionisio did not have a curfew pass
valid and effective for that eventful night; (b) He was driving fast
or speeding just before the collision with the dump truck; (c) He
had purposely turned off his car’s headlights before contact with
the dump truck so that he will not be detected by the policemen
who were manning a check-point; and (d) He was intoxicated at
the time of the accident.
Issue: What was the legal and proximate cause of the accident
and of Dionisio’s injuries?

Held: (1) Dump truck was parked in a wrongful and negligent manner.
— “The conclusion we draw from the factual circumstances outlined
above is that private respondent Dionisio was negligent the night of
the accident. He was hurrying home that night and driving faster
than he should have been. Worse, he extinguished his headlights at
or near the intersection of General Lacuna and General Santos Streets
and thus, did not see the dump truck that was parked askew and
sticking out onto the road lane.
Nonetheless, we agree with the Court of First Instance and the
Intermediate Appellate Court that the legal and proximate cause of

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

253

the accident and of Dionisio’s injuries was the wrongful or negligent
manner in which the dump truck was parked — in other words, the
negligence of petitioner Carbonel. That there was a reasonable relationship between petitioner Carbonel’s negligence on the one hand
and the accident and respondent’s injuries on the other hand, is quite
clear. Put in a slightly different manner, the collision of Dionisio’s
car with the dump truck was a natural and foreseeable consequence
of the truck driver’s negligence.’’

(2) Distinctions between cause and condition have already been
discredited. — “The petitioners, however, urge that the truck
driver’s negligence was merely a “passive and static condition”
and that private respondent Dionisio’s negligence was an “efficient
intervening cause,” and that consequently Dionisio’s negligence
must be regarded as the legal and proximate cause of the accident
rather than the earlier negligence of Carbonel. We note that the
petitioners’ arguments are drawn from a reading of some of the
older cases in various jurisdictions in the United States but we
are unable to persuade ourselves that these arguments have any
validity for our jurisdiction.
We note, firstly, that even in the United States, the distinctions
between ‘cause’ and ‘condition’ which the petitioners would have
us adopt have already been ‘almost entirely discredited.”’

(3) Truck driver’s negligence was the indispensable and efficient
cause. — “We believe, secondly, that the truck driver’s negligence
far from being a ‘passive and static condition’ was rather an indispensable and efficient cause. The collision between the dump
truck and the private respondent’s car would in all probability
not have occurred had the dump truck not been parked askew
without any warning lights or reflector devices. The improper
parking of the dump truck created an unreasonable risk of injury
for anyone driving down General Lacuna Street and for having
so created this risk, the truck driver must be held responsible.
In our view, Dionisio’s negligence, although later in point
of time than the truck driver’s negligence and therefore closer
to the accident, was not an efficient intervening or independent
cause. What the petitioners describe as an “intervening cause”
was no more than a foreseeable consequence of the risk created
by the negligent manner in which the truck driver had parked
the dump truck.
In other words, the petitioner truck driver owed a duty to
private respondent Dionisio and others similarly situated not to
impose upon them the very risk the truck driver had created. Di-

254

TORTS

Art. 2179

onisio’s negligence was not of an independent and overpowering
nature as to cut, as it were, the chain of causation in fact between
the improper parking of the dump truck and the accident, nor to
sever the juris vinculum of liability.’’

(4) Dionisio’s negligence only contributory. — “We hold that private respondent Dionisio’s negligence was ‘only contributory,’ that
the ‘immediate and proximate cause’ of the injury remained the
truck driver’s ‘lack of due care’ and that consequently respondent
Dionisio may recover damages though such damages are subject
to mitigation by the courts.’’
(5) Historical function of doctrine in the common law. — “Petitioners also ask us to apply what they refer to as the ‘last clear
chance’ doctrine. The theory here of petitioners is that while the
petitioner truck driver was negligent, private respondent Dionisio
had the ‘last clear chance’ of avoiding the accident and hence, his
injuries, and that Dionisio having failed to take that ‘last clear
chance’ must bear his own injuries alone.

The last clear chance doctrine of the common law was imported
into our jurisdiction by Picart vs. Smith but it is a matter for debate
whether, or to what extent, it has found its way into the Civil Code
of the Philippines. The historical function of that doctrine in the
common law was to mitigate the harshness of another common
law doctrine or rule — that of contributory negligence. The common law rule of contributory negligence prevented any recovery
at all by a plaintiff who was also negligent, even if the plaintiff’s
negligence was relatively minor as compared with the wrongful
act or omission of the defendant. The common law notion of last
clear chance permitted courts to grant recovery to a plaintiff who
had also been negligent provided that the defendant had the last
clear chance to avoid the casualty and failed to do so.

Accordingly, it is difficult to see what role, if any, the common law last clear chance doctrine has to play in a jurisdiction
where the common law concept of contributory negligence as an
absolute bar to recovery by the plaintiff, has itself been rejected,
as it has been in Article 2179 of the Civil Code of the Philippines.’’
(6) Reservation on applicability of doctrine in our jurisdiction. — ”Is
there perhaps a general concept of ‘last clear chance’ that may be
extracted from its common law matrix and utilized as a general
rule in negligence cases in a civil law jurisdiction like ours? We
do not believe so.

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

255

Under Article 2179, the task of a court, in technical terms, is
to determine whose negligence — the plaintiff’s or the defendant’s — was the legal or proximate cause of the injury. That task
is not simply or even primarily an exercise in chronology or
physics, as the petitioners seem to imply by the use of terms like
‘last’ or ‘intervening’ or ‘immediate.’ The relative location in the
continuum of time of the plaintiff’s and the defendant’s negligent
acts or omissions, is only one of the relevant factors that may be
taken into account. Of more fundamental importance are the nature
of the negligent act or omission of each party and the character
and gravity of the risks created by such act or omission for the
rest of the community.
The petitioners urge that the truck driver (and therefore his
employer) should be absolved from responsibility for his own
prior negligence because the unfortunate plaintiff failed to act with
that increased diligence which had become necessary to avoid the
peril precisely created by the truck driver’s own wrongful act or
omission. To accept this proposition is to come too close to wiping
out the fundamental principle of law that a man must respond for
the foreseeable consequences of his own negligent act or omission.

Our law on quasi-delicts seeks to reduce the risks and burdens
of living in society and to allocate them among the members of
society. To accept the petitioners’ proposition must tend to weaken
the very bonds of society.’’ (Phoenix Construction, Inc. vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 148 SCRA 353 [1987].)

2. Respondent entrusted company’s cash for deposit to an employee
who defrauded the company, made possible by the negligence of the bank
teller.
Facts: RL claims to have entrusted RMC funds in the form of
cash totaling P304,979.74 to his secretary, IY, for the purpose of
depositing said funds in the current accounts of RMC with PBC.
It turned out, however, that these deposits, on all occasions, were
not credited to RMC’s account but were instead deposited to Account No. 53-01734-7 of Y’s husband, BC who likewise maintains
an account with the same bank. During this period, petitioner
bank had, however, been regularly furnishing private respondent
with monthly statements showing its current accounts balances.
Unfortunately, it had never been the practice of RL to check these
monthly statements of account reposing complete trust and confidence on petitioner bank.

Art. 2179

IY’s modus operandi is far from is far from complicated. She
would accomplish two (2) copies of the deposit slip, an original
and a duplicate. The original showed the name of her husband as
depositor and his current account number. On the duplicate copy
was written the account number of her husband but the name
of the account holder was left blank. PBC’s teller, AM, would,
however, validate and stamp both the original and the duplicate
of these deposit slips retaining only the original copy despite
the lack of information on the duplicate slip. The second copy
was kept by IY allegedly for record purposes. After validation,
IY would then fill up the name of RMC in the space left blank
in the duplicate copy and change the account number written
thereon, which is that of her husband’s, and make it appear to
the RMC’s account number.
Issue: What is the proximate cause of the loss suffered by the
private respondent RMC — petitioner bank’s negligence or that
of private respondent?

Held: (1) Bank teller’s negligence proximate cause of loss. — “The
fact that the duplicate slip was not compulsory required by the
bank in accepting deposits should not relieve the petitioner bank
of responsibility. The odd circumstance alone that such duplicate
copy lacked one vital information — that of the name of the account holder — should have already put Ms. M on guard. Rather
than readily validating the incomplete duplicate copy, she should
have proceeded more cautiously by being more probing as to the
true reason why the name of the account holder in the duplicate
slip was left blank while that in the original was filled up. She
should not have been so naïve in accepting hook, line and sinker
the too shallow excuse of Mr. IY to the effect that since the duplicate copy was only for her personal record, she would simply
fill up the blank space later on.

A ‘reasonable man of ordinary prudence’ would not have
given credence to such explanation and would have insisted that
the space left blank be filled up as a condition for validation.
Unfortunately, this was not how bank teller M proceeded thus
resulting in huge losses to the private respondent. x x x
It was this negligence of M. AM, coupled by the negligence
of the petitioner bank in the selection and supervision of its bank
teller, which was the proximate cause of the loss suffered by the
private respondent, and not the latter’s act of entrusting cash to
a dishonest employee, as insisted by the petitioners.’’

Stated differently, the rule would also mean that an antecedent
negligence of a person does not preclude the recovery of damages for the supervening negligence of, or bar a defense against
liability sought by another, if the latter, who had the last fair
chance, could have avoided, the impending harm by the exercise
of due diligence. Here, assuming that private respondent RMC
was negligent in entrusting cash to a dishonest employee, thus
providing the latter with the opportunity to defraud the company,
as advanced by the petitioner, yet it cannot be denied that the
petitioner bank, thru its teller, had the last clear opportunity to
avert the injury incurred by its client, simply by faithfully observing their self-imposed validation procedure.’’ (Philippine Bank of

3. Driver of bus encroached into the lane of an incoming jeepney
and failed to return the bus immediately to its own lane upon seeing
the jeepney coming from the opposite direction.

Facts: A group, numbering 15 persons, rode in a passenger
jeepney. Upon reaching the highway at a speed of 20, kph, a
speeding Pantranco bus encroached on the jeepney’s lane while
negotiating a curve and collided with it.
As a result of the accident, eight (8) passengers died while
the rest suffered injuries.

Petitioner faults the Court of Appeals for not applying the
doctrine of the “last clear chance” against the jeepney driver.
Petitioner claims that under the circumstances of the case, it was
the driver of the passenger jeepney who had the last clear chance
to avoid the collision and was, therefore, negligent in failing to
utilize with reasonable care and competence his then existing opportunity to avoid the harm.
Issue: Should the doctrine be applied in the case?

Held: (1) When doctrine applicable. — “The doctrine applies only
in a situation where the plaintiff was guilty of prior or antecedent negligence but the defendant, who had the last fair chance
to avoid the impending harm and failed to do so, is made liable
for all the consequences of the accident notwithstanding the prior

258

TORTS

Art. 2179

negligence of the plaintiff. (Picart vs. Smith, 37 Phil. 809 [1918];
Glan People’s Lumber and Hardware, et al. vs. Intermediate
Appellate Court, Cecilia Alferez Vda. de Calibo, et al., G.R. No.
70493, May 18, 1989) The subsequent negligence of the defendant in failing to exercise ordinary care to avoid injury to plaintiff
becomes the immediate or proximate cause of the accident which
intervenes between the accident and the more remote negligence
of the plaintiff, thus making the defendant liable to the plaintiff.
(Picart vs. Smith, supra.)
Generally, the last clear chance doctrine is invoked for the
purpose of making a defendant liable to a plaintiff who was guilty
of prior or antecedent negligence, although it may also be raised
as a defense to defeat claim for damages.”

(2) Proof required. — “Contrary to the petitioner’s contention,
the doctrine of ‘last clear chance’ finds no application in this case.

For the doctrine to be applicable, it is necessary to show
that the person who allegedly had the last opportunity to avert
the accident was aware of the existence of the peril or should,
with exercise of due care, have been aware of it. One cannot be
expected to avoid an accident or injury if he does not know or
could not have known the existence of the peril. In this case, there
is nothing to show that the jeepney driver David Ico knew of the
impending danger. When he saw at a distance that the approaching
bus was encroaching on his lane, he did not immediately swerve
the jeepney to the dirt shoulder on his right since he must have
assumed that the bus driver will return the bus to its own lane
upon seeing the jeepney approaching from the opposite direction.

As held by this Court in the case of Vda. De Bonifacio vs. BLTB,
G.R. No. L-26810, August 31, 1970, 34 SCRA 618, a motorist who is
properly proceeding on his own side of the highway is generally
entitled to assume that an approaching vehicle coming towards
him on the wrong side, will return to his proper lane of traffic.
There was nothing to indicate to David Ico that the bus could
not return to its own lane or was prevented from returning to
the proper lane by anything beyond the control of its driver. Leo
Marantan, an alternate driver of the Pantranco bus who was seated
beside the driver Ramirez at the time of the accident, testified that
Ramirez had no choice but to swerve the steering wheel to the
left and encroach on the jeepney’s lane because there was a steep
precipice on the right. However, this is belied by the evidence on
record which clearly shows that there was enough space to swerve

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

259

the bus back to its own lane without any danger.’’

(3) Driver of jeepney had no opportunity to avoid collision. —
“Moreover, both the trial court and the Court of Appeals found
that at the time of the accident the Pantranco bus was speeding
towards Manila. By the time David Ico must have realized that the
bus was not returning to its own lane, it was already too late to
swerve the jeepney to his right to prevent an accident. The speed
at which the approaching bus was running prevented David Ico
from swerving the jeepney to the right shoulder of the road in
time to avoid the collision. Thus, even assuming that the jeepney
driver perceived the danger a few seconds before the actual collision, he had no opportunity to avoid it.

This Court has held that the last clear chance doctrine ‘can
never apply where the party charged is required to act instantaneously, and if the injury cannot be avoided by the application of all
means at hand after the peril is or should have been discovered.
(Ong vs. Metropolitan Water District, supra.)’’

(4) Negligence of petitioner’s driver was the proximate cause of the
accident. — “Considering the foregoing, the Court finds that the
negligence of petitioner’s driver in encroaching into the lane of
the incoming jeepney and in failing to return the bus to its own
lane immediately upon seeing the jeepney coming from the opposite direction was the sole and proximate cause of the accident
without which the collision would not have occurred.

There was no supervening or intervening negligence on the
part of the jeepney driver which would have made the prior negligence of petitioner’s driver a mere remote cause of the accident.’’

4. A person driving an automobile continued in his original direction even after he saw a man on horseback riding towards him on the
wrong side of the street.

Facts: Plaintiff was riding a pony on a bridge. He saw an
automobile coming and heard the warning signals. Perturbed
by the novelty of the apparition or the rapidity of the approach,
he improperly pulled the pony closely up against the railing on
the right side of the bridge instead of going to the left. He says
that the reason he did this was that he thought he did not have

260

TORTS

Art. 2179

sufficient time to get over to the other side. As the automobile
approached, defendant guided it towards his left, and only because
that was the proper side of the road for the vehicle but because
he assumed that plaintiff would move to the other side.

The rider had made a sign for the automobile to stop. The
defendant instead of veering to the right while yet some distance
away, or slowing down, continued to approach directly toward
the horse without diminution of speed. When he had gotten quite
nearer, there being no possibility of the horse getting across to the
other side, the defendant quickly turned his car sufficiently to the
right to escape hitting the horse alongside of the railing where
it was then standing; but in so doing the automobile passed so
close to the animal that it became frightened and turned its body
across the bridge with its head toward the railing.
The horse was struck by the car and the limb was broken.
The horse fell and plaintiff was thrown off with some violence.
He suffered contusions which caused temporary unconsciousness,
and required medical attention for several days.

Issue: Whether or not the defendant in maneuvering his car
in the manner above described was guilty of negligence.

Held: Defendant had fair opportunity to avoid accident. — “A
prudent man, placed in the position of the defendant would, in
our opinion, have recognized that the course which he was pursuing was fraught with risk, and would, therefore, have foresen
harm to the horse and the rider as a reasonable consequence of
that course. Under these circumstances, the law imposed on the
defendant the duty to guard against the threatened harm.
Although the plaintiff was guilty of negligence for being on
the wrong side of the bridge — the defendant was nevertheless
civilly liable for the legal damages resulting from the collision, as
he had a fair opportunity to avoid the accident after he realized
the situation created by the negligence of the plaintiff but failed
to avail himself of that opportunity, while the plaintiff could by
no means then place himself in a position of great safety.’’

(2) Antecedent negligence of plaintiff immaterial. — “The negligent
acts of the two parties was not contemporaneous, since the negligence of the defendant succeeded the negligence of the plaintiff
by an appreciable internal. The law is that the person who has
the last fair chance to avoid the impending harm and fails to do
so is chargeable with the consequences without reference to the
prior negligence of the other party.’’

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

261

(3) Criterion in determing existence of negligence. — “The question as to what would constitute the conduct of a prudent man
in a given situation must of course be always determined in the
light of human experience and in view of the facts involved in
the particular case.

Reasonable men govern their conduct by the circumstances
which are before them or known to them . . . they can be expected
to take care only when there is something before them to suggest
or warn of danger. Stated in these terms, the proper criterion for
determining the existence of negligence in a given case is this:
conduct is said to be negligent when a prudent man in the position of the tortfeasor would have foreseen that an effect of harm
to another was sufficiently probable to warrant his foregoing the
conduct or guarding against its consequences.’’ (Picart vs. Smith,
37 Phil. 809 [1918].)

The specific conduct requirement.
Negligence itself is not a historical fact. It cannot be proven
in any direct sense because negligence represents an evaluation
of facts rather than the facts themselves. Nevertheless, the evaluation rests upon facts about the defendant’s conduct.
(1) Facts showing specific conduct. — As a practical matter,
the fact required to show negligence must ordinarily meet a
demanding standard of specificity. They must show precisely
what the defendant did or didn’t do.
The plaintiff must point to a particular way in which that
conduct could have been made safer. The plaintiff cannot prevail by saying that the defendant drove his car so negligently
that he injured the plaintiff. Although such generalities may
suffice for some pleadings, they are too conclusory to count as
evidence. Even if such a generality could be admitted as evidence, it would not be evidence about what we need to know
to evaluate the defendant’s conduct. What we need to know is
what precise physical actions the plaintiff claims the defendant
should have done differently to present less risk.

Example: Suppose the plaintiff falls from a balcony at a
hotel. In a suit against the hotel for negligence, it won’t do
to say that the hotel negligently allowed him to fall. That
would be like saying that if an accident occurred, it must be

262

TORTS

Art. 2179

the defendant’s fault, a view that courts consistently reject.
Instead, the plaintiff must assert a particular way in which
the defendant acted or failed to act. Perhaps he would assert that the balcony railing was only 36 inches high when
it should have been 42 inches high.
(2) Purpose of specificity requirement. — Why the requirement
of such specificity? One important reason is that only when you
know specific conduct can you estimate the risks and utilities of
that conduct, a process normally implicit in finding negligence.
It is impossible to estimate either risks or utilities when no
particular conduct is identified. If, instead of judging conduct
by risks and utilities, you attempt to judge it by community
custom or by legislative standards, the same arises; you must
know the conduct you are judging.

It is, of course, possible for a plaintiff to claim that the defendant is negligent of engaging at all in some general activity
like driving cars or running hotels. But it would be almost
impossible to successfully contend that reasonable people never
ever drive cars or operate hotels because the utility of such
activities is very high. As a practical matter, then, the plaintiff
must ordinarily attempt to prove some specific ways in which
the car was driven or the hotel was maintained that could
reasonably have been made safer.
When the plaintiff proves in the example that the hotel balcony rail was only 36 inches high and claims that should have
been 42 inches high to prevent a person from leasing balance
and falling over, it becomes possible to estimate risks and the
costs of reducing them and hence, possible to judge whether
the hotel was or was not negligent.

(3) Other purposes. — There are some other reasons why
specific conduct must be identified in order to claim negligence,
but they will make more sense in connection with cause-in-fact
and proximate cause. In brief, it will be impossible to conclude
that the defendant’s conduct was a cause of the plaintiff’s harm
or that the harm was within the scope of the risk unless you
know what the risk was; to know that, you must know the
specific conduct claimed to be negligent.
(4) Res ipsa loquitur. — To prove the defendant negligent,

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

263

the plaintiff must normally provide evidence of the defendant’s
specific conduct. Proof that accident happened or even that the
defendant caused an injury is enough by itself. As courts say,
negligence is not presumed. Cases that fit the res ipsa loquitur
pattern constitute an exception. (D.B. Dobbs, op cit., pp. 369-370.)
Doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.

(1) Meaning. — Res ipsa loquitur is a Latin phrase which
literally means “the thing or the transaction speaks for itself.”
The phrase “res ipsa loquitur” is a maxim for the rule that the
fact of the occurrence of an injury, taken with the surrounding
circumstances, may permit an inference or raise a presumption of negligence, or make out a plaintiff’s prima facie case,
and present a question of fact for defendant to meet with an
explanation.

Where the thing which caused the injury complained of is
shown to be under the management of the defendant or his
servants and the accident is such as in ordinary course of things
does not happen if those who have its management or control
use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence
of explanation by the defendant, that the accident arose from or
was caused by the defendant’s want of care. (Ramos vs. Court
of Appeals, 321 SCRA 584 [1999].)

(2) Basis. — The doctrine is simply a recognition of the postulate that, as a matter of common knowledge and experience,
the very nature of certain types of occurrences may justify an
inference of negligence on the part of the person who controls
the instrumentality causing the injury in the absence of some
explanation by the defendant who is charged with negligence. It
is grounded in the superior logic of ordinary human experience
and on the basis of such experience or common knowledge,
negligence may be deduced from the mere occurrence of the
accident itself. Hence, res ipsa loquitur is applied in conjunction
with the doctrine of common knowledge. (Ibid.)

(3) A rule of evidence. — The doctrine, as a rule of evidence
is peculiar to the law of negligence which recognizes that
prima facie negligence may be established without direct proof
and furnishes a substitute for specific proof of negligence. The
doctrine is not a rule of substantive law but merely a mode of

264

TORTS

Art. 2179

proof or a mere procedural convenience.

The rule, when applicable to the facts and circumstances of
a particular case, is not intended to and does not dispense with
the requirement of proof of culpable negligence on the part of
the party charged. It merely determines and regulates what
shall be prima facie evidence thereof and facilitates the burden
of plaintiff of proving a breach of the duty of due care. (Africa
vs. Caltex, [Phil.], Inc., 16 SCRA 448 [1966].)
(4) When doctrine may be invoked. — The doctrine can be invoked when and only when, under the circumstances involved,
direct evidence is absent and not readily available. Hence, it has
generally been held that the presumption of inference arising
from the doctrine cannot be availed of, or is overcome, where
plaintiff has knowledge and testifies or presents evidence as to
the specific act of negligence which is the cause of the injury
complained of or where there is direct evidence as to the precise cause of the accident and all the facts and circumstances
attendant on the occurrence clearly appear.
Finally, once the actual cause of injury is established beyond
controversy, whether by the plaintiff or by the defendant, no
presumptions will be involved and the doctrine becomes inapplicable when the circumstances have been so completely elucidated that no inference of defendant’s liability can reasonably
be made. (Ibid.)
(5) Requisites. — Before resort to the doctrine may be allowed, the following requisites must be satisfactorily shown:

(a) The accident is of a kind which ordinarily does not
occur in the absence of someone’s negligence;
(b) It is caused by an instrumentality within the exclusive
control of the defendant or defendants; and

(c) The possibility of contributing conduct which would
make the plaintiff responsible is eliminated.

In the above requisites, the fundamental element is the
“control of the instrumentality” which caused the damage. Such
element of control must be shown to be within the dominion
of the defendant. In order to have the benefit of the rule, a
plaintiff, in addition to proving injury or damage, must show

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

265

a situation where it is applicable, and must establish that the
essential elements of the doctrine were present in a particular
incident. (Ramos vs. Court of Appeals, supra.)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. A fire broke out at a gasoline station while gasoline was being
hosed from a tank truck into the underground storage.

Facts: A fire broke out at a Caltex service station. It started
while gasoline was being hosed from a tank truck into the underground storage, right at the opening of the receiving tank where
the nozzle of the hose was inserted. The fire spread to and burned
several neighboring houses, including the personal properties and
effects inside them. Their owners, among them petitioners here,
sued respondents Caltex (Phil.), Inc. and Mateo Boquiren, the
first as alleged owner of the station and the second as its agent
in charge of operation. Negligence on the part of both of them
was attributed as the cause of the fire.
Issue: Whether or not, without proof as to the cause and origin
of the fire, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur should apply so as to
presume negligence on the part of appellees.
Held: (1) Doctrine has been applied in this jurisdiction. — “The
doctrine has actually been applied in this jurisdiction in the case
of Espiritu vs. Philippine Power and Development Co. (C.A.-G.R.
No. L-3240-R, September 20, 1949), wherein the decision of the
Court of Appeals was penned by Mr. Justice J.B.L. Reyes now a
member of the Supreme Court.
The facts of that case are stated in the decision as follows:

‘In the afternoon of May 5, 1946, while the plaintiff-appellee
and other companions were loading grass between the municipalities of Bay and Calauan, in the province of Laguna,
with clear weather and without any wind blowing, an electric
transmission wire, installed and maintained by the defendant
Philippine Power and Development Co., Inc. alongside the
road, suddenly parted, and one of the broken ends hit the
head of the plaintiff as he was about to board the truck.

As a result, plaintiff received the full shock of 4,400 volts
carried by the wire and was knocked unconscious to the
ground. The electric charge coursed through his body and
caused extensive and serious multiple burns from skull to legs,
leaving the bone exposed in some parts and causing intense

266

TORTS

Art. 2179

pain and wounds that were not completely healed when the
case was tried on June 18, 1947, over one year after the mishap.’

The defendant therein disclaimed liability on the ground that
the plaintiff had failed to show any specific act of negligence but
the appellate court overruled the defense under the doctrine of
res ipsa loquitur. The court said:
‘The first point is directed against the sufficiency of
plaintiff’s evidence to place appellant on its defense. While
it is the rule, as contended by the appellant, that in case of
non-contractual negligence, or culpa aquiliana, the burden of
proof is on the plaintiff to establish that the proximate cause
of his injury was the negligence of the defendant, it is also
a recognized principle that ‘Where the thing which caused
injury, without fault of the injured person, is under the exclusive control of the defendant and the injury is such as in
the ordinary course of things does not occur if those having
such control use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence,
in the absence of the explanation that the injury arose from
defendant’s want of care.
And the burden of evidence is shifted to him to establish
that he has observed due care and diligence (San Juan Light
& Transit Co. vs. Requena, 224 U.S. 89, 56 L.ed. 68).
This rule is known by the name of res ipsa loquitur (the
transaction speaks for itself), and is peculiarly applicable to
the case at bar, where it is unquestioned that the plaintiff had
every right to be on the highway, and the electric wire was
under the sole control of defendant company. In the ordinary
course of events, electric wires do not part suddenly in fair
weather and injure people, unless they are subjected to unusual strain and stress or there are defects in their installation,
maintenance and supervision; just as barrels do not ordinarily
roll out of the warehouse windows to injure passersby unless
some one was negligent. (Byrne vs. Boadle, 2 H & Co. 22; 159
Eng. Reprint 299, the leading case that established that rule.)
Consequently, in the absence of contributory negligence
(which is admittedly not present) the fact that the wire snapped
suffices to raise a reasonable presumption of negligence in the
installation, care and maintenance. Thereafter, as observed by
Chief Baron Pollock, if there are any facts inconsistent with
negligence, it is for the defendant to prove.’’’

(2) A fire is not considered a fortuitous event. — “It is true of
course that decisions of the Court of Appeals do not lay down
doctrines binding on the Supreme Court, but we do not consider
this a reason for not applying the particular doctrine of res ipsa
loquitur in the case at bar. Gasoline is a high]y combustible material, in the storage and sale of which extreme care must be taken.
On the other hand, fire is not considered a fortuitous event, as it
arises almost invariably from some act of man.
A case strikingly similar to the one before Us is Jones vs. Shell
Petroleum Corporation, et al., 171 So. 447:
‘Arthur O. Jones is the owner of a building in the city
of Hammon which in the year 1934 was leased to the Shell
Petroleum Corporation for a gasoline filling station. On October 8, 1934, during the term of the lease, while gasoline was
being transferred, from the tank wagon, also operated by the
Shell Petroleum Corporation, to the underground tank of the
station, a fire started with resulting damages to the building
owned by Jones. x x x

In resolving the issue of negligence, the Supreme Court of
Louisiana held:

‘Plaintiff’s petition contains two distinct charges of negligence — one relating to the cause of the fire and the other
relating to the spreading of the gasoline about the filling station.

Other than an expert to asses the damages caused plaintiff’s building by the fire, no witnesses were placed on the
stand by the defendant.
Taking up plaintiff’s charge of negligence relating to the
cause of the fire, we find it established by the record that the
filling station and the tank truck were under the control of
the defendant and operated by its agents or employees. We
further find from the uncontradicted testimony of plaintiff’s
witnesses that fire started in the underground tank attached to
the filling station while it was being filled from the tank truck
and while both the tank and the truck were in charge of and
being operated by the agents or employees of the defendant,
extended to the hose and tank truck, and was communicated
from the burning hose, tank truck, and escaping gasoline to
the building owned by the plaintiff.’

Predicated on these circumstances and the further circumstance
of defendants failure to explain the cause of the fire or to show its
lack of knowledge of the cause, plaintiff has evoked the doctrine

268

TORTS

Art. 2179

of res ipsa loquitur. There are many cases in which the doctrine
may be successfully invoked and this, we think, is one of them.

Where the thing which caused the injury complained of is shown
to be under the management of defendant or his servants and the
accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen
if those who have its management or control use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in absence of explanation by defendant,
that the accident arose from want of care.’’

(3) Gasoline station was under control of appellees. — “The principle enunciated in the aforequoted case applies with equal force
here. The gasoline station, with all its appliances, equipment and
employees, was under the control of appellees. A fire occurred
therein and spread to and burned the neighboring houses. The
persons who knew or could have known how the fire started
were appellees and their employees, but they gave no explanation
thereof whatsoever. It is a fair and reasonable inference that the
incident happened because of want of care.’’

(4) Presumption of negligence under the doctrine of res ipsa
loquitur. — “The facts, descriptive of the location and objective
circumstances surrounding the operation of the gasoline station
in question, strengthen the presumption of negligence under the
doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, since on their face they called for more
stringent measures of caution than those which would satisfy the
standard of due diligence under ordinary circumstances. x x x Even
then the fire possibly would not have spread to the neighboring
houses were it not for another negligent omission on the part of
defendants, namely, their failure to provide a concrete wall high
enough to prevent the flames from leaping over it.’’
(5) Intervention of unexpected cause. — “It is the generally accepted rule as applied to torts that ‘if the effects of the actor’s
negligent conduct actively and continuously operate to bring about
harm to another, the fact that the active and substantially simultaneous operation of the effects of a third person’s innocent, tortious or
criminal act is also a substantial factor in bringing about the harm,
does not protect the actor from liability.’
Stated in another way, ‘The intervention of an unforeseen
and unexpected cause, is not sufficient to relieve a wrongdoer
from consequences of negligence, if such negligence directly and
proximately cooperates with the independent cause in the resulting injury.’’ (Africa vs. Caltex [Phils.], 16 SCRA 448 [1966]; see F.F.
Cruz Cruz and Co. vs. Court of Appeals, 164 SCRA 731 [1988],

vessel as the ship captain remained in command and the ship’s
crew were still present. While it imposed certain rules and regulations on William Lines, it was in the exercise of due diligence and
not an indication of CSEW’s exclusive control over subject vessel.
Thus, CSEW maintains that it did not have exclusive control over
the M/V Manila City and the trial court and the Court of Appeals
erred in applying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.

The finding by the trial court and the Court of Appeals that
M/V Manila City caught fire and sank by reason of the negligence
of the workers of CSEW, when the said vessel was under the
exclusive custody and control of CSEW, being conclusive on the
parties and is not reviewable, the same was accordingly upheld.
Issue: Under the circumstances of the case, does the doctrine
apply?

Held: (1) Conditions for application of doctrine. — “For the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur to apply to a given situation, the following
conditions must concur: (1) the accident was of a kind which does
not ordinarily occur unless someone is negligent; and (2) that the
instrumentality or agency which caused the injury was under the
exclusive control of the person charged with negligence.’’

(2) Concurrence of conditions in the case. — “The facts and
evidence on record reveal the concurrence of said conditions in
the case under scrutiny. First, the fire that occurred and consumed
M/V Manila City would not have happened in the ordinary course
of things if reasonable care and diligence had been exercised. In
other words, some negligence must have occurred. Second, the
agency charged with negligence, as found by the trial court and
the Court of Appeals and as shown by the records, is the herein
petitioner, Cebu Shipyard and Engineering Works, Inc., which had
control over subject vessel when it was docked for annual repairs.

270

TORTS

Art. 2179

So also, as found by the regional court, ‘other responsible
causes, including the conduct of the plaintiff, and third persons,
are sufficiently eliminated by the evidence.”’

(3) Petitioner liable even without doctrine. — “What is more,
in the present case the trial court found direct evidence to prove
that the workers and/or employees of CSEW were remiss in their
duty of exercising due diligence in the care of subject vessel. The
direct evidence substantiates the conclusion that CSEW was really
negligent.
Thus, even without applying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, in
light of the direct evidence on record, the ineluctable conclusion is
that the petitioner, Cebu Shipyard and Engineering Works, Inc., was
negligent and consequently liable for damages to the respondent,
William Lines, Inc.’’ (Cebu Shipyard and Engineering Works, Inc. vs.
William Lines, Inc., 106 SCAD 382, 306 SCRA 762 [1999].)

3. Defamatory words were inserted in the telegram sent by respondent, which were not noticed and were included in the telegram
when delivered.

Facts: Respondent LD alleges that the defamatory words on
the telegram sent to him not only wounded his feelings but also
caused him undue embarrassment and affected adversely his
business as well because other people have come to know of said
defamatory words.

Defendant-corporation as a defense, alleges that the additional
words in Tagalog was a private joke between the sending and receiving operators and that they were not addressed to or intended
for plaintiff and therefore did not form part of the telegram and
that the Tagalog words are not defamatory. The telegram sent
through its facilities was received in its station at Legaspi City.
Nobody other than the operator manned the teletype machine
which automatically receives telegrams being transmitted. The
said telegram was detached from the machine and placed inside
a sealed envelope and delivered to plaintiff, obviously as is.
The additional words in Tagalog were never noticed and were
included in the telegram when delivered.
Issue: May the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur be applied?

Held: (1) Clear case of breach of contract. — “Petitioner is a
domestic corporation engaged in the business of receiving and
transmitting messages. Everytime a person transmits a message

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

271

through the facilities of the petitioner, a contract is entered into.
Upon receipt of the rate or fee fixed, the petitioner undertakes to
transmit the message accurately.
There is no question that in the case at bar, libelous matters
were included in the message transmitted, without the consent or
knowledge of the sender. There is a clear case of breach of contract
by the petitioner in adding extraneous and libelous matters in the
message sent to the private respondent.’’

(2) Difficulty in proving negligence in some cases. — “As a corporation, the petitioner can act only through its employees. Hence,
the acts of its employees in receiving and transmitting messages are
the acts of the petitioner. To hold that the petitioner is not liable
directly for the acts of its employees in the pursuit of petitioner’s
business is to deprive the general public availing of the services
of the petitioner of an effective and adequate remedy.
In most cases, negligence must be proved in order that plaintiff
may recover. However, since negligence may be hard to substantiate
in some cases, we may apply the doctrine of RES IPSA LOQUITUR
(the thing speaks for itself), by considering the presence of facts
or circumstances surrounding the injury.” (Radio Communications
of the Phils., Inc. [RCPI] vs. Court of Appeals, 143 SCRA 657 [1986].)

Emergency rule.
(1) Meaning. — Under this rule, a person who, without
fault or negligence on his part, is suddenly placed in an emergency or unexpected danger and compelled to act instantly
and instinctively with no time for reflection and exercise of the
required precaution, is not guilty of negligence and, therefore,
exempt from liability, if he did not make the wisest choice of the
available courses of conduct to avoid injury which a reasonably
prudent person would have made under normal circumstances.
(2) Rationale. — As explained by the Supreme Court in one
case:

“Courts have traditionally been compelled to recognize
that an actor who is confronted with an emergency is not
to be held up to the standard of conduct normally applied
to an individual who is in no such situation. The law takes
stock of impulses of humanity when placed in threatening or
dangerous situations and does not require the same standard

272

TORTS

Art. 2179

of thoughtful and reflective care from persons confronted
by unusual and oftentimes threatening conditions.

Under the ‘emergency rule’ adopted by this Court in
Gan vs. Court of Appeals (165 SCRA 378 [1988].), an individual who suddenly finds himself in a situation of danger
and is required to act without much time to consider the
best means that may be adopted to avoid the impending
danger is not guilty of negligence if he fails to undertake
what subsequently and upon reflection may appear to be
a better solution, unless the emergency was brought about
by his own negligence.” (Valenzuela vs. Court of Appeals,
68 SCAD 113, 253 SCRA 303, 318 [1996].)
(3) When rule not applicable. — Note that one confronted
with a sudden peril is not excused from all errors of judgment.
He is still required to exercise that standard of care expected
of an ordinarily prudent man faced with the same sudden or
unexpected situation. The rule is not applicable where the situation or danger was caused by his own negligence.

Example: If Y is driving has car at a very high rate of
speed in violation of traffic rules and he suddenly finds
himself confronted with the choice of hitting a pedestrian or
another car, and opts for the latter, the emergency doctrine
is unavailable because his tortious conduct contributed to
the creation of the emergency.
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. Driver of a car entered lane of cargo truck coming from opposite
direction to avoid hitting two (2) boys who suddenly darted across the
road and a collision occurred in said lane.

Facts: A head-on-collision took place in the morning between
a cargo truck driver by RG and owned by private respondents
and a car driver by JK, which resulted in the death of JK and two
others, and physical injuries to three, all passengers of the car.
The truck was bound for Manila, while the car was on is way to
Angeles from San Francisco, Pampanga.
When the northbound car was about 10 meters away from
the southern approach of a budge, two (2) suddenly darted from
the right side of the road and into the lane of the car. The boys

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

273

were moving back and forth unsure of whether to cross all the
way to the other side or turn back. JK blew the horn of the car,
swerved to the left and entered the lane of the truck; he then
switched on the headlights of the car, applied the brakes, and
thereafter attempted to return to his lane. Before he could do so,
his car collided with the truck.
The collision occurred in the lane of the truck which was the
opposite lane, on the said bridge.
The decision of the Court of Appeals is anchored principally
on its findings that it was JK’s inattentiveness or reckless imprudence which caused the accident.
Issue: Could negligence be imputed to JK?

Held: No. (1) No presumed negligence on the part of JK. — “In
the assailed resolution, the respondent Court held that the fact
that the car improperly invaded the lane of the truck and that
the collision occurred in said lane gave rise to the presumption
that the driver of the car, Jose Koh, was negligent.

On the basis of this presumed negligence, the appellate court
immediately concluded that it was Jose Koh’s negligence that
was the immediate and proximate cause of the collision. This
is an unwarranted deduction as the evidence for the petitioners
convincingly shows that the car swerved into the truck’s lane
because as it approached the southern end of the bridge, two (2)
boys darted across the road from the right sidewalk into the lane
of the car. x x x Jose Koh’s entry into the lane of the truck was
necessary in order to avoid what was, in his mind at that time, a
greater peril of death or injury to the two (2) boys. Such act can
hardly be classified as negligent.’’
(2) Definitions and test of negligence. — “Negligence was defined
and described by this Court in Layugan vs. Intermediate Appellate
Court (167 SCRA 363 [1988].) thus:

‘. . Negligence is the omission to do something which a
reasonable man, guided by those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or
the doing of something which a prudent and reasonable man
would not do (Black’s Law Dictionary, Fifth Edition, 930), or
as Judge Cooley defines it, ‘(T)he failure to observe for the
protection of the interests of another person, that degree of
care, precaution, and vigilance which the circumstances justly
demand, whereby such other person suffers injury.’ (Cooley
on Torts, Fourth Edition, vol. 3, 265.)

274

TORTS

Art. 2179

In Picart vs. Smith (87 Phil 809, 813.), decided more than seventy years ago but still a sound rule, (W)e held:
‘The test by which to determine the existence of negligence
in a particular case may be stated as follows: Did the defendant
in doing the alleged negligent act use that (reasonable care and
caution which an ordinarily prudent person would have used
in the same situation?) If not, then he is guilty of negligence.
The law here in effect adopts the standard supposed to
be supplied by the imaginary conduct of the discreet pater
familias of the Roman law. . . .’

In Corliss vs. Manila Railroad Company (27 SCRA 674 [1969].),
We held: x x x x x x

On the basis of the foregoing definition, the test of negligence
and the facts obtaining in this case, it is manifest that no negligence
could be imputed to Jose Koh.’’

(3) Emergency rule applicable. — “Any reasonable and ordinary
prudent man would have tried to avoid running over the two
boys by swerving the car away from where they were even if this
would mean entering the opposite lane. Avoiding such immediate
peril would be the natural course to take particularly where the
vehicle in the opposite lane would be several meters away and
could very well slow down, move to the side of the road and
give way to the oncoming car.

Moreover, under what is known as the emergency rule, ‘one
who suddenly finds himself in a place of danger, and is required to
act without time to consider the best means that may be adopted
to avoid the impending danger, is not guilty of negligence, if he
fails to adopt what subsequently and upon reflection may appear
to have been a better method, unless the emergency in which he
finds himself is brought about by his own negligence.’ ’’

(4) Proximate cause of collision. — “In any case, assuming,
arguendo that Jose Koh is negligent, it cannot be said that his
negligence was the proximate cause of the collision. Proximate
cause has been defined as: x x x17
Applying the above definition, although it may be said that
the act of Jose Koh, if at all negligent, was the initial act in the
chain of events, it cannot be said that the same caused the eventual injuries and deaths because of the occurrence of a sufficient
intervening event, the negligent act of the truck driver, which was
the actual cause of the tragedy. The entry of the car into the lane

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

275

of the truck would not have resulted in the collision had the latter heeded the emergency signals given by the former to slow
down and give the car an opportunity to go back into its proper
lane. Instead of slowing down and swerving to the far right of
the road, which was the proper precautionary measure under
the given circumstances, the truck driver continued at full speed
towards the car.
The truck driver’s negligence becomes more apparent in
view of the fact that the road is 7.50 meters wide while the car
measures 1.598 meters and the truck, 2.286 meters, in width. This
would mean that both car and truck could pass side by side with
a clearance of 3.661 meters to spare. Furthermore, the bridge has
a level sidewalk which could have partially accommodated the
truck. Any reasonable man finding himself in the given situation
would have tried to avoid the car instead of meeting it head-on.’’

(5) Driver’s negligence apparent in the records. — “The truck
driver’s negligence is apparent in the records. He himself said
that his truck was running at 30 miles (48 kilometers) per hour
along the bridge while the maximum speed allowed by law on a
bridge is only 30 kilometers per hour.
Under Article 2185 of the Civil Code, a person driving a vehicle is presumed negligent if at the time of the mishap, he was
violating any traffic regulation. The truck driver’s negligence was
likewise duly established through the earlier quoted testimony of
petitioner Araceli Koh McKee which was duly corroborated by
the testimony of Eugenio Tanhueco, an impartial eyewitness to
the mishap. x x x
Clearly, therefore, it was the truck driver’s subsequent negligence in failing to take the proper measures and degree of care
necessary to avoid the collision which was the proximate cause
of the resulting accident.’’

(6) Doctrine of last clear chance applicable. — “Even if Jose Koh
was indeed negligent, the doctrine of last clear chance finds application here. Last clear chance is a doctrine in the law of torts
which states that the contributory negligence of the party injured
will not defeat the claim for damages if it is shown that the defendant might, by the exercise of reasonable care and prudence,
have avoided the consequences of the negligence of the injured
party. In such cases, the person who had the last clear chance to
avoid the mishap is considered in law solely responsible for the
consequences thereof. x x x

276

TORTS

Art. 2179

In Pantranco North Express, Inc. vs. Baesa (179 SCRA 384 [1989].),
We ruled:
‘The doctrine of the last clear chance simply means that
the negligence of a claimant does not preclude a recovery
for the negligence of defendant where it appears that the latter, by exercising reasonable care and prudence, might have
avoided injurious consequences to claimant notwithstanding
his negligence.’ ’’

(7) Situation to which doctrine applies. — “The doctrine applies
only in a situation where the plaintiff was guilty of prior or antecedent negligence but the defendant, who had the last fair chance
to avoid the impending harm and failed to do so, is made liable
for all the consequences of the accident notwithstanding the prior
negligence of the plaintiff. The subsequent negligence of the defendant in failing to exercise ordinary care to avoid injury to plaintiff
becomes the immediate or proximate cause of the accident which
intervenes between the accident and the more remote negligence
of the plaintiff, thus making the defendant liable to the plaintiff.

Generally, the last clear chance doctrine is invoked for the
purpose of making a defendant liable to a plaintiff who was
guilty of prior or antecedent negligence, although it may also be
raised as a defense to defeat claim (sic) for damages.” (Mckee vs.
Intermediate Appellate Court, 211 SCRA 517 [1992].)

2. While plaintiff was at the left side of the rear of her car parked
at a lighted place along the sidewalk, she was suddenly bumped by
another car driven by defendant.

Facts: MLV was driving a car along Aurora Boulevard, Quezon
City, at 2:00 A.M. with a companion, when she noticed something
wrong with her tires. She stopped at a lighted place. She parked
along the sidewalk, put on her emergency lights, and went to the
rear to open the trunk. She was standing at the left side of the rear
of her car pointing to the tools to a man who would help her fix
the tire when she was suddenly bumped by another car driven by
defendant RL. Because of the impact, plaintiff was thrown against
the windshield of RL’s car which was destroyed and then fell to
the ground. She suffered serious injuries.
Against MLV’s corroborated claims, RL’s allegations were
neither backed up by other witnesses nor by the circumstances
proven in the course of the trial. He claimed that he was driving

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

277

merely at a speed of 55 kph. when “out of nowhere he saw a dark
maroon lancer right in front of him, which was (the) plaintiff’s
car.” He alleged that upon seeing this sudden “apparition” he put
on his brakes to no avail as the road was slippery.
Issue: Was defendant guilty of negligence?

Held: Yes. (1) Defendant was driving at a “very fast’’ speed and/
or was under influence of alcohol. — “One will have to suspend
disbelief in order to give credence to Li’s disingenuous and patently self-serving asseverations. The average motorist alert to
road conditions will have no difficulty applying the brakes to a
car traveling at the speed claimed by Li. Given a light rainfall,
the visibility of the street, and the road conditions on a principal
metropolitan thoroughfare like Aurora Boulevard, Li would have
had ample time to react to the changing conditions of the road if
he were alert — as every driver should be — to those conditions.
Driving exacts a more than usual toll on the senses. Physiological ‘fight or flight’ mechanisms are at work, provided such mechanisms were not dulled by drugs, alcohol, exhaustion, drowsiness,
etc. Li’s failure to react in a manner which would have avoided
the accident could, therefore, have been only due to either or both
of the two factors: 1) that he was driving at a ‘very fast’ speed
as testified by Rodriguez; and 2) that he was under the influence
of alcohol. Either factor working independently would have diminished his responsiveness to road conditions, since normally he
would have slowed down prior to reaching Valenzuela’s car rather
than be in a situation forcing him to suddenly apply his brakes.

Secondly, as narrated by defendant Richard Li to the San Juan
Police immediately after the incident, he said that while driving
along Aurora Blvd., out of nowhere he saw a dark maroon lancer
right in front of him, which was plaintiff’s car, indicating, again,
thereby that, indeed, he was driving very fast, oblivious of his
surroundings and the road ahead of him, because if he was not,
then he could not have missed noticing at a still far distance the
parked car of the plaintiff at the right side near the sidewalk
which had its emergency lights on, thereby avoiding forcefully
bumping at the plaintiff who was then standing at the left rear
edge of her car.

Since, according to him, in his narration to the San Juan Police,
he put on his brakes when he saw the plaintiff’s car in front of
him, but that it failed as the road was wet and slippery, this goes
to show again, that, contrary to his claim, he was, indeed, running

278

TORTS

Art. 2179

very fast. For, were it otherwise, he could have easily completely
stopped his car, thereby avoiding the bumping of the plaintiff,
notwithstanding that the road was wet and slippery. Verily, since,
if, indeed, he was running slow, as he claimed, at only about 55
kilometers per hour, then, inspite of the wet and slippery road,
he could have avoided hitting the plaintiff by the mere expedient
or applying his brakes at the proper time and distance.
It could not be true, therefore, as he now claims during his
testimony, which is contrary to what he told the police immediately after the accident and is, therefore, more believable, that he
did not actually step on his brakes, but simply swerved a little to
the right when he saw the on-coming car with glaring headlights,
from the opposite direction, in order to avoid it.

For, had this been what he did, he would not have bumped
the car of the plaintiff which was properly parked at the right
beside the sidewalk. And, it was not even necessary for him to
swerve a little to the right in order to safely avoid a collision with
the on-coming car, considering that Aurora Blvd. is a double lane
avenue separated at the center by a dotted white paint, and there
is plenty of space for both cars, since her car was running at the
right lane going towards Manila and the on-coming car was also
on its right lane going to Cubao.”

(2) Plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence. — “Contributory negligence is conduct on the part of the injured party,
contributing as a legal cause to the harm he has suffered, which
falls below the standard to which he is required to conform for
his own protection. Based on the foregoing definition, the standard or act to which, according to petitioner Li, Valenzuela ought
to have conformed for her own protection was not to park at all
at any point of Aurora Boulevard, a no parking zone. We cannot
agree.

Courts have traditionally been compelled to recognize that
an actor who is confronted with an emergency is not to be held
up to the standard of conduct normally applied to an individual
who is in no such situation. The law takes stock of impulses of
humanity when placed in threatening or dangerous situations and
does not require the same standard of thoughtful and reflective
care from persons confronted by unusual and oftentimes threatening conditions. x x x
Applying this principle to a case in which the victims in a
vehicular accident swerved to the wrong lane to avoid hitting

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

279

two children suddenly darting into the street, we held, in McKee
vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, that the driver therein, Jose Koh,
‘adopted the best means possible in the given situation’ to avoid
hitting the children. Using the ‘emergency rule,’ the court concluded that Koh, in spite of the fact that he was in the wrong
lane when the collision with an oncoming truck occurred, was
not guilty of negligence.’’

(3) Conduct required of an individual in cases of emergency. —
“While the emergency rule applies to those cases in which reflective thought, or the opportunity to adequately weigh a threatening
situation is absent, the conduct which is required of an individual
in such cases is dictated not exclusively by the suddenness of the
event which absolutely negates thoughtful care, but by the over-all
nature of the circumstances.
A woman driving a vehicle suddenly crippled by a flat tire
on a rainy night will not be faulted for stopping at a point which
is both convenient for her to do so and which is not a hazard to
other motorists. She is not expected to run the entire boulevard in
search for a parking zone or turn on a dark street or alley where
she would likely find no one to help her. It would be hazardous
for her not to stop and assess the emergency (simply because the
entire length of Aurora Boulevard is a no-parking zone) because
the hobbling vehicle would be both a threat to her safety and to
other motorists. In the instant case, Valenzuela, upon reaching
that portion of Aurora Boulevard close to A. Lake St., noticed that
she had a flat tire. To avoid putting herself and other motorists
in danger, she did what was best under the situation.

As narrated by respondent court: ‘She stopped at a lighted
place where there are people, to verify whether she had a flat
tire and to solicit help if needed. Having been told by the people
present that her rear right tire was flat and that she cannot reach
her home she parked along the sidewalk, about 1 1/2 feet away,
behind a Toyota Corona Car.’ In fact, respondent court noted, Pfc.
Felix Ramos, the investigator on the scene of the accident, confirmed
that Valenzuela’s car was parked very close to the sidewalk. The
sketch which he prepared after the incident showed Valenzuela’s
car partly straddling the sidewalk, clear and at a convenient distance from motorists passing the right lane of Aurora Boulevard.’’

of Americans killed by medical screw-ups is somewhere between 44,000 and 98,000 every

280

TORTS

Art. 2179

(4) Plaintiff had taken all reasonable precautions. — “Under the
circumstances described, Valenzuela did exercise the standard
reasonably dictated by the emergency and could not be considered to have contributed to the unfortunate circumstances which
eventually led to the amputation of one of her lower extremities.
The emergency which led her to park her car on a sidewalk in
Aurora Boulevard was not of her own making, and it was evident
that she had taken all reasonable precautions.
Obviously in the case at bench, the only negligence ascribable
was the negligence of Li on the night of the accident. ‘Negligence,
as it is commonly understood, is conduct which creates an undue
risk of harm to others.’ It is the failure to observe that degree of
care, precaution, and vigilance which the circumstances justly
demand, whereby such other person suffers injury. We stressed,
in Corliss vs. Manila Railroad Company, that negligence is the want
of care required by the circumstances.’’

(5) Defendant was grossly negligent. — “The circumstances
established by the evidence adduced in the court below plainly
demonstrate that Li was grossly negligent in driving his Mitsubishi Lancer. It bears emphasis that he was driving at a fast speed
at about 2:00 A.M. after a heavy downpour had settled into a
drizzle rendering the street slippery. There is ample testimonial
evidence on record to show that he was under the influence of
liquor. Under these conditions, his chances of effectively dealing
with changing conditions on the road were significantly lessened.
As Prosser and Keaton emphasized:

‘[U]nder present day traffic conditions, any driver of an
automobile must be prepared for the sudden appearance of
obstacles and persons on the highway, and of other vehicles
at intersections, such as one who sees a child on the curb may
be required to anticipate its sudden dash into the street, and
his failure to act properly when they appear may be found
to amount to negligence.’

Li’s obvious unpreparedness to cope with the situation confronting him on the night of the accident was clearly of his own
making.’’ (Valenzuela vs. Court of Appeals, 68 SCAD 113, 253 SCRA
303 [1996].)

Standard of care for professionals.
In contrast to the rules that apply in ordinary negligence

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

281

cases, different rules govern the conduct of professionals, including physicians, attorneys, and accountants. Most of the “action’’
in this field today involves medical malpractice, although in
the future the continuing growth of the service economy may
spawn lawsuits in a variety of fields.
(1) Compliance with the standards of the profession. — In ordinary negligence litigation, the failure to comply with custom
is not automatically negligent, and complying with custom is
not automatically reasonable care. In contrast, in cases involving
professionals, the rule is that compliance with custom insulates
the defendant from liability, and failure to comply with custom
is malpractice.

In medical malpractice, the standards of the medical profession are the relevant “custom.’’ Thus, the plaintiff’s proof that
the defendant committed malpractice consists of proof that the
defendant complied with the standards of the profession. Indeed,
in many jurisdictions a “respectable minority’’ rule obtains,
under which non-compliance with a standard rejected by much
of the profession is not malpractice, as long as the defendant
complied with a school of thought or practice followed by a
respectable minority of practitioners.
(2) Reasons for application of special standards to professionals
alone. — So radical a departure from the treatment of custom
in ordinary negligence cases is justified by necessity. Certainly,
as a general matter, the activity that is the subject of scrutiny
in professional liability cases is considerably more complex, and
the court is substantially less familiar with it, than the activities
that are the subject of ordinary negligence cases.
In a medical malpractice case, for example, to ask the judge
to go beyond professional standards to determine whether it
was reasonable for the defendant to follow a particular medical
course of treatment would in effect ask for the judge’s medical
judgment — something that no judge is likely to be capable of
giving.

For the reader who thinks that this approach lets physicians and other professionals off too easily, remember that the
dispositive effect of custom in medical malpractice cases cuts
both ways: although compliance with custom automatically
insulates the physician from liability, deviation from custom

282

TORTS

Art. 2179

automatically triggers a finding of malpractice.

Another reason for the application of the special standard
to professionals alone is that, in practice, the standard may not
operate so differently from ordinary cases. Like most legal issues,
most difficult medical issues cannot be resolved by reference
to a definitive, black-letter rule; medical judgment is required.
Expert testimony, therefore, does not usually point to a precise
“standard’’ that governs the problem that the defendant faced.
Rather, experts for each side tend to testify about what they
would have done in the defendant’s place, and what they believe
good medical practice required. Often this kind of testimony
could be interpreted to be about medical custom,
although
a court might interpret such testimony as being in conflict about
what the prevailing medical standard actually is. (K.S. Abraham,
The Forms and Functions of Tort Law, 2002 Ed.,
pp.
69-71; see Art. 2180, par. 6.)
Medical malpractice.
(1) Meaning and elements. — Medical malpractice is a particular
form of negligence which consists in the failure of a physician
or surgeon to apply to his practice of medicine that degree of
care and skill which is ordinarily employed by the profession
generally, under similar conditions, and in like surrounding
circumstances.

In order to successfully pursue such a claim, a patient must
prove that the physician or surgeon either failed to do something which a reasonably prudent physician or surgeon would
have done, or that he or she did something that a reasonably
prudent physician or surgeon would not have done, and that
the failure or action caused injury to the patient.

There are thus four (4) elements involved in medical negligence cases, namely: duty, breach, injury, and proximate causation. (Reyes vs. Sisters of Mercy Hospital, 135 SCAD 78, 341
SCRA 760 [2000].)
(2) Sacred duty of a physician. — “Throughout history, patients
have consigned their fates and lives to the skill of their doctors.
For a breach of this trust, men have been quick to demand ret-

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

283

ribution. Some 4,000 years ago, the Code of Hammurabi then
already provided:
‘If a physician make a deep incision upon a man with
is bronze lancet and cause the man’s death, or operate on
the eye socket of a man with his bronze lancet and destroy
the man’s eyes, they shall cut off his hand.’

Subsequently, Hippocrates wrote what was to become part
of the healer’s oath:

‘I will follow that method of treatment which according
to my ability and judgment, I consider for the benefit of
my patients, and abstain from whatever is deleterious and
mischievous . . . While I continue to keep this oath unviolated may it be granted me to enjoy life and practice the
art, respected by all men at all times but should I trespass
and violate this oath, may the reverse be my lot.’

At present, the primary objective of the medical profession
is the preservation of life and maintenance of the health of the
people.

Needless to say then, when a physician strays from his sacred
duty and endangers instead the life of his patient, he must be
made to answer therefor. Although society today cannot and will
not tolerate the punishment meted out by the ancients, neither
will it and this Court, as this case would show, let the act go
uncondemned.’’ (Batiquin vs. Court of Appeals, 71 SCAD 748,
258 SCRA 335 [1996].)

“The Hippocratic Oath mandates physicians to give
primordial consideration to the health and welfare of their
patients. If a doctor fails to live up to this precept, he is
made accountable for his acts. A mistake, through gross
negligence or incompetence or plain human error, may spell
the difference between life and death. In this sense, the doctor plays God on his patient’s fate.’’18 (Ramos vs. Court of
Appeals, 321 SCRA 584 [1999].)

(3) Practice of medicine conditioned upon the highest degree of
diligence. — “The practice of medicine is a profession engaged
in only by qualified individuals. It is a right earned through
years of education, training, and by first obtaining a license from

284

TORTS

Art. 2179

the state through professional board examinations. Such license
may, at any time and for cause, be revoked by the government.

In addition to state regulation, the conduct of doctors is also
strictly governed by the Hippocratic Oath, an ancient code of
discipline and ethical rules which doctors have imposed upon
themselves in recognition and acceptance of their great responsibility to society. Given these safeguards, there is no need to
expressly require of doctors the observance of ‘extraordinary
diligence.’ As it is now, the practice of medicine is already
conditioned upon the highest degree of diligence. And, as we
have already noted, the standard contemplated for doctors is
simply the reasonable average merit among ordinarily good
physicians. That is reasonable diligence for doctors or, as the
Court of Appeals called it, the reasonable ‘skill and competence
... that a physician in the same or similar locality ... should apply.’” (Reyes vs. Sisters of Mercy Hospital, supra.)
(4) Professional standard of care. — A physician will be held
to the professional standard of care when acting in a professional capacity.19 Medical malpractice actions typically arise
from a patient’s allegation of negligent diagnosis or treatment.
In order to prevail, the patient must show that the physician
fell below the applicable standard of care, thereby causing the
patient’s injury. The standard of care to which physicians are
held is set by the custom of their profession. The physician must
possess and use the knowledge and skill common to members
of the profession in good standing. This standard demands of
the physician minimal competence.20

Although courts occasionally refer to the professional standard in medical malpractice cases as the “reasonable doctor’’
standard of care, this terminology is misleading. Were a “reasonable doctor’’ standard to apply, it would permit the court to
balance factors such as burden, magnitude and probability in
order to determine if the defendant breached a duty owed to
the plaintiff. This approach is not used in medical malpractice
cases and, thus, a reference to a “reasonable doctor’’ is an imprecise manner of stating the appropriate standard of care. In
the medical malpractice context, the standard of care is set by
custom, and the determination of breach of duty arises from the
defendant doctor’s failure to act with the minimal competence

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

285

exercised by other doctors in good standing.

Put another way, liability flows from the physician’s failure
to conform to the profession’s customary practice and, unlike
the typical negligence case, the court has no discretion to find
that the standard practice is unreasonable.

It is not always correct to view the standard of care expected
of professionals as a “higher standard.’’ In most cases, the
conduct demanded of a physician exceeds that of a reasonable
person, but not always. For example, if the well-settled custom
of ophthalmologists is to test only those over 40 years old for
glaucoma, notwithstanding a tiny burden to test those under
40, a patient who is under 40 years old suing for medical malpractice because of her ophthalmologist’s failure to test her for
glaucoma has no case. This is so even if the custom itself could
be deemed unreasonable.
(5) Alternative approaches to the practice of medicine. — Often
there is more than one accepted way to practice medicine. As
long as one of the accepted approaches is followed, a doctor
is protected from malpractice liability. Thus, if Dr. X treats P’s
ailment in one manner, that other doctors might treat it differently is irrelevant provided, Dr. X’s approach is a “reputable’’
or “respectable’’ one. Further, the relative merits of each approach are irrelevant provided there is an established custom
supporting the method employed. (Ibid., pp. 98-100.)
Application of doctrine res ipsa loquitur
to medical malpractice.
(1) A question of law. — Medical malpractice cases do not
escape the application of this doctrine. Thus, res ipsa loquitur has
been applied when the circumstances attendant upon the harm
are themselves of such a character as to justify an inference of
negligence as the cause of that harm. The application of res ipsa
loquitur in medical negligence cases presents a question of law
since it is a judicial function to determine whether a certain
set of circumstances does, as a matter of law, permit a given
inference.
(2) Where doctrine applicable, expert testimony dispensed with.
— Although generally, expert medical testimony is relied upon

286

TORTS

Art. 2179

in malpractice suits to prove that a physician has done a negligent act or that he has deviated from the standard medical
procedure, when the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur is availed by
the plaintiff, the need for expert medical testimony is dispensed
with because the injury itself provides the proof of negligence.
The reason is that the general rule on the necessity of expert
testimony applies only to such matters clearly within the domain of medical science, and not to matters that are within the
common knowledge of mankind which may be testified to by
anyone familiar with the facts.

Ordinarily, only physicians and surgeons of skill and experience are competent to testify as to whether a patient has
been treated or operated upon with a reasonable degree of skill
and care. However, testimony as to the statements and acts of
physicians and surgeons, external appearances, and manifest
conditions which are observable by any one may be given by
non-expert witnesses. Hence, in cases where the res ipsa loquitur
is applicable, the court is permitted to find a physician negligent
upon proper proof of injury to the patient, without the aid of
expert testimony, where the court from its fund of common
knowledge can determine the proper standard of care.

Where common knowledge and experience teach that a
resulting injury would not have occurred to the patient if due
care had been exercised, an inference of negligence may be
drawn giving rise to an application of the doctrine of res ipsa
loquitur without medical evidence, which is ordinarily required
to show not only what occurred but how and why it occurred.
When the doctrine is appropriate, all that the patient must do
is prove a nexus between the particular act or omission complained of and the injury sustained while under the custody and
management of the defendant without need to produce expert
medical testimony to establish the standard of care. Resort to
res ipsa loquitur is allowed because there is no other way, under
usual and ordinary conditions, by which the patient can obtain
redress for injury suffered by him.
(3) Situations when doctrine applied. — Thus, courts of other
jurisdictions have applied the doctrine in the following situations: leaving of a foreign object in the body of the patient after

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

287

an operation, injuries sustained on a healthy part of the body
which was not under, or in the area, of treatment, removal of
the wrong part of the body when another part was intended,
knocking out a tooth while a patient’s jaw was under anesthetic
for the removal of his tonsils, and loss of an eye while the patient plaintiff was under the influence of anesthetic, during or
following an operation for appendicities, among others.
(4) Doctrine not automatically applicable to all cases of medical
malpractice. — Nevertheless, despite the fact that the scope of res
ipsa loquitur has been measurably enlarged, it does not automatically apply to all cases of medical negligence as to mechanically
shift the burden of proof to the defendant to show that he is
not guilty of the ascribed negligence.
Res ipsa loquitur is not a rigid or ordinary doctrine to be perfunctorily used but a rule to be cautiously applied, depending
upon the circumstances of each case. It is generally restricted
to situations in malpractice cases where a layman is able to say,
as a matter of common knowledge and observation, that the
consequences of professional care were not as such as would
ordinarily have followed if due care had been exercised.

(5) When doctrine not available in a malpractice suit. — A distinction must be made between the failure to secure results, and
the occurrence of something more unusual and not ordinarily
found if the service or treatment rendered followed the usual
procedure of those skilled in that particular practice. It must
be conceded that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur can have no
application in a suit against a physician or surgeon which involves the merits of a diagnosis or of a scientific treatment. The
physician or surgeon is not required at his peril to explain why
any particular diagnosis was not correct, or why any particular
scientific treatment did not produce the desired result.
Thus, res ipsa loquitur is not available in a malpractice suit
if the only showing is that the desired result of an operation
or treatment was not accomplished.
(6) Where extraneous interventions occurred. — The real question, therefore, is whether or not in the process of the operation,
any extraordinary incident or unusual event outside of the rou-

288

TORTS

Art. 2179

tine performance occurred which is beyond the regular scope
of customary professional activity in such operations, which, if
unexplained would themselves reasonably speak to the average
man as the negligent cause or causes of the untoward consequence. If there was such extraneous interventions, the doctrine
of res ipsa loquitur may be utilized and the defendant is called
upon to explain the matter, by evidence of exculpation, if he
could. (Ramos vs. Court of Appeals, 321 SCRA 584 [1999].)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. Six (6) hours after undergoing a surgical operation for the
removal of a stone blocking his ureter, the patient died of complications
of “unknown cause.’’

Facts: FVR, husband of petitioner LGR, underwent surgical
operation for the removal of a stone blocking his ureter. He was
attended by Dr. DAJ, surgeon, and Dr. EBR, anesthesiologist. Six
hours after the surgery, however, FVR died of complications of
“unknown cause,’’ according to the officials of the hospital.
The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) which conducted
an autopsy of FVR’s body, ruled that his death was due to lack
of care by the attending physician in administering anesthesia.
The Office of City Prosecutor resolved to exonerate Dr. EBR.

Issue: Was the City Prosecutor in a competent position to pass
judgment on the merits of a medical negligence case?

Held: No. (1) Want of medical competence is evidentiary in nature.
— “In the instant case, no less than the NBI pronounced after
conducting an autopsy that there was indeed negligence on the
part of the attending physicians in administering the anesthesia.
The fact of want of competence or diligence is evidentiary in
nature, the veracity of which can best be passed upon after a fullyear — the eighth leading cause of death even by the more conservative figure, ahead of
car crashes, breast cancer and AIDS. More astonishing than the huge numbers themselves,
though, is the fact that public health officials had known about the problem for years and
hadn’t made a concerted effort to do something about it.’’ (Ibid.)
19
The professional standard of care applies only where there is specialized skill and
training, and, often, post-graduate education. While the Restatement intends that the
professional standard of care apply to “those in the practice of a skilled trade,’’ which
includes vocations such as electricians, pilots and plumbers (Rest. § 299A), many courts
have restricted the standard of care to “professionals,’’ such as lawyers, doctors and
architects. Under this interpretation, extra skill derived from experience will not lead to
the application of the professional standard of care. For example, a truck driver, even if

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

289

blown trial for it is virtually impossible to ascertain the merits of
a medical negligence case without extensive investigation, research,
evaluation and consultations with medical experts.
Clearly, the City Prosecutors are not in a competent position
to pass judgment on such a technical matter, especially when
there are conflicting evidence and findings. The bases of a party’s
accusation and defenses are better ventilated at the trial proper
than at the preliminary investigation.’’
(2) Medical malpractice or negligence cases. — “A word on medical malpractice or negligence cases.

‘In its simplest terms, the type of lawsuit which has been
called medical malpractice on more appropriately, medical
negligence, is that type of claim which a victim has available
to him or her to redress a wrong committed by a medical
professional which has caused bodily harm.

In order to successfully pursue such a claim, a patient
must prove that a health care provider, in most cases a
physician, either failed to do something which a reasonably
prudent health care provider would have done, or that he or
she did something that a reasonably prudent provider would
not have done; and that that failure or action caused injury
to the patient.’”
(3) Elements involved. — “Hence, there are four elements
involved in medical negligence cases: duty, breach, injury and
proximate causation.
specially trained to drive big rigs, will not be held to the professional standard of care but
will, instead, be held to that of a reasonable person. There may be some elitism at work in
the determination of which “professions’’ are afforded the professional standard of care
and which are not. (Diamond, Levine & Madden, Understanding Torts, 1996 Ed., p. 98.)
20
Rest §299A cmt. E “[T]he standard of skill and knowledge required . . . is that which
is commonly possessed by members of that profession or trade in good standing. It is not
that of the most highly skilled, nor is it that of the average member of the profession or
trade, since those who have less than median or average skill may still be competent and
qualified.’’ (cited in Ibid., p. 99.)
21
Under this doctrine, the surgeon is likened to a ship captain who must not only be
responsible for the safety of the crew but also of the passengers of the vessel. The head
surgeon is made responsible for everything that goes wrong within the four corners of the
operating room. It enunciates the liability of the surgeon not only for the wrongful acts of
those who are under his physical control but also those wherein he has extension of control.
22
Where the act complained of is a breach of specific terms of the contract without
any reference to the legal duties imposed by law upon the relationship created thereby, the

290

TORTS

Art. 2179

Evidently, when the victim employed the services of Dr. DAJ
and Dr. EBR, a physician-patient relationship was created. In accepting the case, Dr. DAJ and Dr. EBR, in effect, represented that,
having the needed training and skill possessed by physicians and
surgeons practicing in the same field, they will employ such training, care and skill in the treatment of their patients. They have a
duty to use at least the same level of care that any other reasonably competent doctor would use to treat a condition under the
same circumstances. The breach of these professional duties of skill
and care, or their improper performance, by a physician surgeon
whereby the patient is injured in body or in health, constitutes
actionable malpractice.
Consequently, in the event that any injury results to the patient
from want of due care or skill during the operation, the surgeons
may be held answerable in damages for negligence.’’

(4) Two pronged evidence required. — “Moreover, in malpractice
or negligence cases involving the administration of anesthesia, the
necessity of expert testimony and the availability of the charge
of res ipsa loquitur to the plaintiff, have been applied in actions
against anesthesiologists to hold the defendant liable for the death
or injury of a patient under excessive or improper anesthesia.
Essentially, it requires two-pronged evidence: evidence as to the
recognized standards of the medical community in the particular
kind of case, and a showing that the physician in question negligently departed from this standard in his treatment.’’
(5) Element of causation. — “Another element in medical
negligence cases is causation which is divided into two inquiries: whether the doctor’s actions in fact caused the harm to the
patient and whether these were the proximate cause of the patient’s injury. Indeed here, a causal connection is discernible from
the occurrence of the victim’s death after the negligent act of the
anesthesiologist in administering the anesthesia, a fact which, if
confirmed, should warrant the filing of the appropriate criminal
case. To be sure, the allegation of negligence is not entirely baseless. Moreover, the NBI deduced that the attending surgeons did
not conduct the necessary interview of the patient prior to the
operation.
It appears that the cause of the death of the victim could have
been averted had the proper drug been applied to cope with the
symptoms of malignant hyperthermia. Also, we cannot ignore the
fact that an antidote was readily available to counteract whatever
deleterious effect the anesthesia might produce. Why these precau-

Art. 2179

291

tionary measures were disregarded must be sufficiently explained.

The petition is dismissed without prejudice to the filing of
an appeal by the petitioner with the Secretary of Justice assailing
the dismissal of her criminal complaint by the respondent City
Prosecutors.’’ (Garcia-Rueda vs. Pascasio, 86 SCAD 791, 278 SCRA
769 [1997].)

2. At the time of her admission, the patient was neurologically
sound but during the administration of anesthesia and prior to the
performance of cholescystectomy, she suffered irreparable damage to her
brain.
Facts: Erlinda Ramos was advised to undergo an operation
for the removal of a stone in her gall blader. Dr. Hozaka decided
that she should undergo a “cholescystectomy.’’ Inside the operating room, Herminia Cruz (Dean of the College of Nursing of the
Hospital) who was to provide moral support to the patient, saw
Dr. Gutierrez, anesthesiologist, intubating Erlina. She thereafter
heard Dr. Gutierrez say, “ang hirap ma-intubate nito, mali yata ang
pagkakapasok. O lumalaki ang tiyan” Because of the remarks of Dra.
Gutierrez, she focused her attention on what Dr. Gutierrez was
doing. She thereafter noticed bluish discoloration of the nailbeds of
the left hand of the hapless Erlinda even as Dr. Hosaka approached
her. She then heard Dr. Hosaka issue an order for someone to call
Dr. Calderon, another anesthesiologist. After Dr. Calderon arrived
at the operating room, she saw this anesthesiologist trying to
intubate the patient.
Erlinda stayed at the ICU for a month. Four months later,
she died.

During the whole period of her confinement, “she has been
in a comatose condition. She cannot move any part of her body.
She cannot see or hear. She is living on mechanical means. She
suffered brain damage as a result of the absence of oxygen in
her brain for four to five minutes. After being discharged from
the hospital, she has been staying in their residence, still needing
constant medical attention.
She was also diagnosed to be suffering from “diffuse cerebral
parenchymal damage.’’

Issue: Is the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur appropriate in case
at bar?
Held: (1) Doctrine applicable. — “The damage sustained by

292

TORTS

Art. 2179

Erlinda in her brain prior to a scheduled gall bladder operation
presents a case for the application of res ipsa loquitur.

A case strikingly similar to the one before us is Voss vs. Bridwell, where the Kansas Supreme Court in applying the res ipsa
loquitur stated:
‘The plaintiff herein submitted himself for a mastoid
operation and delivered his person over to the care, custody
and control of his physician who had complete and exclusive
control over him, but the operation was never performed.
At the time of submission he was neurologically sound and
physically fit in mind and body, but he suffered irreparable
damage and injury rendering him decerebrate and totally
incapacitated.

The injury was one which does not ordinarily occur
in the process of a mastoid operation or in the absence of
negligence in the administration of an anesthetic, and in the
use and employment of an endoctracheal tube. Ordinarily,
a person being put under anesthesia is not rendered decerebrate as a consequence of administering such anesthesia in
the absence of negligence. Upon these facts and under these
circumstances a layman would be able to say, as a matter of
common knowledge and observation, that the consequences of
professional treatment were not as such as would ordinarily
have followed if due care had been exercised.
Here the plaintiff could not have been guilty of contributory
negligence because he was under the influence of anesthetics and unconscious, and the circumstances are such that the
true explanation of event is more accessible to the defendants
than to the plaintiff for they had the exclusive control of the
instrumentalities of anesthesia.’’’

(2) Brain damage does not normally occur in the process of a gall
bladder operation. — “Indeed, the principles enunciated in the
aforequoted case apply with equal force here. In the present case,
Erlinda submitted herself for cholecystectomy and expected a
routine general surgery to be performed on her gall bladder. On
that fateful day she delivered her person over to the care, custody
and control of private respondents who exercised complete and
exclusive control over her. At the time of submission, Erlinda was
neurologically sound and, except for a few minor discomforts,
was likewise physically fit in mind and body. However, during
the administration of anesthesia and prior to the performance of

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

293

cholecystectomy she suffered irreparable damage to her brain.
Thus, without undergoing surgery, she went out of the operating
room already decerebrate and totally incapacitated.
Obviously, brain damage, which Erlinda sustained, is an injury
which does not normally occur in the process of a gall bladder
operation. In fact, this kind of situation does not happen in the
absence of negligence of someone in the administration of anesthesia and in the use of endotracheal tube. Normally, a person being
put under anesthesia is not rendered decerebrate as a consequence
of administering such anesthesia if the proper procedure was followed. Furthermore, the instruments used in the administration
of anesthesia, including the endotracheal tube, were all under the
exclusive control of private respondents, who are the physiciansin-charge. Likewise, petitioner Erlinda could not have been guilty
of contributory negligence because she was under the influence
of anesthetics which rendered her unconscious.’’
(3) Negligence attended management and care of patient. — “Considering that a sound and unaffected member of the body (the
brain) is injured or destroyed while the patient is unconscious and
under the immediate and exclusive control of the physicians, we
hold that a practical administration of justice dictates the application of res ipsa loquitur.

Upon these facts and under these circumstances the Court
would be able to say, as a matter of common knowledge and
observation, if negligence attended the management and care
of the patient. Moreover, the liability of the physicians and the
hospital in this case is not predicated upon an alleged failure to
secure the desired results of an operation nor on an alleged lack
of skill in the diagnosis or treatment as in fact no operation or
treatment was ever performed on Erlinda. Thus, upon all these
initial determination a case is made out for the application of the
doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.
Nonetheless, in holding that res ipsa loquitur is available to
the present case we are not saying that the doctrine is applicable
in any and all cases where injury occurs to a patient while under
anesthesia, or to any and all anesthesia cases. Each case must be
viewed in its own light and scrutinized in order to be within the
res ipsa loquitur coverage.’’

(4) Negligence was proximate cause of patient’s brain damage. —
“We hold that private respondents were unable to disprove the
presumption of negligence on their part in the care of Erlinda and

294

TORTS

Art. 2179

their negligence was the proximate cause of her piteous condition.

With regard to Dra. Gutierrez, we find her negligent in the
care of Erlinda during the anesthesia phase. As borne by the records, respondent Dra. Gutierrez failed to properly intubate the
patient. This fact was attested to by Prof. Herminda Cruz, Dean
of the Capitol Medical Center School of Nursing and petitioner’s
sister-in-law, who was in the operating room right beside the
patient when the tragic event occurred.

(5) Expert testimony is not necessary in non-technical matter’s.
— “Although Cruz is not an anesthesiologist, she can very well
testify upon matters on which she is capable of observing such
as, the statements and acts of the physician and surgeon, external
appearances, and manifest conditions which are observable by
any one. This is precisely allowed under the doctrine of res ipsa
loquitur where the testimony of expert witnesses is not required.
It is the accepted rule that expert testimony is not necessary
for the proof of negligence in non-technical matters or those of
which an ordinary person may be expected to have knowledge, or
where the lack of skill or want of care is so obvious as to render
expert testimony unnecessary. We take judicial notice of the fact
that anesthesia procedures have become so common, that even
an ordinary person can tell if it was administered properly. As
such, it would not be too difficult to tell if the tube was properly
inserted. This kind of observation, we believe, does not require a
medical degree to be acceptable.’’

(6) Anesthesiologist committed act of exceptional negligence and
professional irresponsibility. — “In the case at bar, respondent Dra.
Gutierrez admitted that she saw Erlinda for the first time on the
day of the operation itself, on 17 June 1985. Before this date, no
prior consultations with, or pre-operative evaluation of Erlinda
was done by her. Until the day of the operation, respondent Dra.
Gutierrez was unaware of the physiological make-up and needs of
Erlinda. She was likewise not properly informed of the possible
difficulties she would face during the administration of anesthesia
to Erlinda. Respondent Dra. Gutierrez’ act of seeing her patient
for the first time only an hour before the scheduled operative
procedure was, therefore, an act of exceptional negligence and
professional irresponsibility. The measures cautioning prudence
and vigilance in dealing with human lives lie at the core of the
physician’s centuries-old Hippocratic Oath. Her failure to follow
this medical procedure is, therefore, a clear indicia of her negligence.

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

295

Erlinda’s case was elective and this was known to respondent
Dra. Gutierrez. Thus, she had all the time to make a thorough
evaluation of Erlinda’s case prior to the operation and prepare
her for anesthesia. However, she never saw the patient at the
bedside. She herself admitted that she had seen petitioner only in
the operating room, and only on the actual date of the cholecystectomy. She negligently failed to take advantage of this important
opportunity. As such, her attempt to exculpate herself must fail.’’
(7) Responsibility of head of surgical team. — “As the so-called
‘captain of the ship,’21 it is the surgeon’s responsibility to see to
it that those under him perform their task in the proper manner.
Respondent Dr. Hosaka’s negligence can be found in his failure
to exercise the proper authority (as the ‘captain’ of the operative
team) in not determining if his anesthesiologist observed proper
anesthesia protocols. In fact, no evidence on record exists to show
that respondent Dr. Hosaka verified if respondent Dra. Gutierrez
properly intubated the patient.

Furthermore, it does not escape us that respondent Dr. Hosaka
had scheduled another procedure in a different hospital at the same
time as Erlinda’s cholecystectomy, and was in fact over three hours
late for the latter’s operation. Because of this, he had little or no
time to confer with his anesthesiologist regarding the anesthesia
delivery. This indicates that he was remiss in his professional duties towards his patient. Thus, he shares equal responsibility for
the events which resulted in Erlinda’s condition.’’
(8) Responsibility of the hospital. — “The unique practice (among
private hospitals) of filling up specialist staff with attending and
visiting ‘consultants,’ who are allegedly not hospital employees,
presents problems in apportioning responsibility for negligence in
medical malpractice cases. However, the difficulty is only more
apparent than real.

In the first place, hospitals exercise significant control in the
hiring and firing of consultants and in the conduct of their work
within the hospital premises. Doctors who apply for ‘consultant’
slots, visiting or attending, are required to submit proof of completion of residency, their educational qualifications; generally,
evidence of accreditation by the appropriate board (diplomate),
evidence of fellowship in most cases, and references. These requirements are carefully scrutinized by members of the hospital
administration or by a review committee set up by the hospital
who either accept or reject the application. This is particularly
true with respondent hospital.

296

TORTS

Art. 2179

After a physician is accepted, either as a visiting or attending
consultant, he is normally required to attend clinico-pathological
conferences, conduct bedside rounds for clerks, interns and residents, moderate grand rounds and patient audits and perform
other tasks and responsibilities, for the privilege of being able to
maintain a clinic in the hospital, and/or for the privilege of admitting patients into the hospital. In addition to these, the physician’s
performance as a specialist is generally evaluated by a peer review
committee on the basis of mortality and morbidity statistics, and
feedback from patients, nurses, interns and residents. A consultant remiss in his duties, or a consultant who regularly falls short
of the minimum standards acceptable to the hospital or its peer
review committee, is normally politely terminated.
In other words, private hospitals, hire, fire and exercise real
control over their attending and visiting ‘consultant’ staff. While
‘consultants’ are not, technically employees, a point which respondent hospital asserts in denying all responsibility for the
patient’s condition, the control exercised, the hiring, and the right
to terminate consultants all fulfill the important hallmarks of an
employer-employee relationship, with the exception of the payment of wages. In assessing whether such a relationship in fact
exists, the control test is determining.

Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, we rule that for the
purpose of allocating responsibility in medical negligence cases, an
employer-employee relationship in effect exists between hospitals
and their attending and visiting physicians.’’

(9) Solidary liability of respondents. — “The basis for holding
an employer solidarily responsible for the negligence of its employee is found in Article 2180 of the Civil Code which considers
a person accountable not only for his own acts but also for those
of others based on the former’s responsibility under a relationship
of patria potestas. Such responsibility ceases when the persons or
entity concerned prove that they have observed the diligence of
a good father of the family to prevent damage. In other words,
while the burden of proving negligence rests on the plaintiffs,
once negligence is shown, the burden shifts to the respondents
(parent, guardian, teacher or employer) who should prove that
they observed the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent
damage.
In the instant case, respondent hospital, apart from a general
denial of its responsibility over respondent physicians, failed to
adduce evidence showing that it exercised the diligence of a good

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

297

father of a family in the hiring and supervision of the latter. It
failed to adduce evidence with regard to the degree of supervision which it exercised over its physicians. In neglecting to offer
such proof, or proof of a similar nature, respondent hospital
thereby failed to discharge its burden under the last paragraph
of Article 2180. Having failed to do this, respondent hospital is
consequently solidarily responsible with its physicians for Erlinda’s
condition. x x x
Upon these disquisitions we hold that private respondents are
solidarily liable for damages under Article 2176[79] of the Civil
Code.’’ (Ramos vs. Court of Appeals, 321 SCRA 584 [1999].)

On January 8, 1987, he was taken to the Mercy Community
Clinic by his wife. He was attended to by respondent Dr. Marlyn
Rico, resident physician and admitting physician on duty, who
gave Jorge a physical examination and took his medical history.
She noted that at the time of his admission, Jorge was conscious,
ambulatory, oriented, coherent, and with respiratory distress. Typhoid fever was then prevalent in the locality, as the clinic had
been getting from 15 to 20 cases of typhoid per month. Suspecting
that Jorge could be suffering from this disease, Dr. Rico ordered
a Widal Test, a standard test for typhoid fever, to be performed
on Jorge. Blood count, routine urinalysis, stool examination, and
malarial smear were also made. After about an hour, the medical
technician submitted the results of the test from which Dr. Rico
concluded that Jorge was positive for typhoid fever. As her shift
was only up to 5:00 p.m., Dr. Rico indorsed Jorge to respondent
Dr. Marvie Blanes.
Dr. Blanes attended to Jorge at around six in the evening. She
also took Jorge’s history and gave him a physical examination.
Like Dr. Rico, her impression was that Jorge had typhoid fever.

298

TORTS

Art. 2179

Antibiotics being the accepted treatment for typhoid fever, she
ordered that a compatibility test with the antibiotic chloromycetin
be done on Jorge. Said test was administered by nurse Josephine
Pagente who also gave the patient a dose of triglobe. As she did
not observe any adverse reaction by the patient to chloromycetin, Dr. Blanes ordered the first five hundred milligrams of said
antibiotic to be administered on Jorge at around 9:00 p.m. A
second dose was administered on Jorge about three hours later
just before midnight.
At around 1:00 a.m. of January 9, 1987, Dr. Blanes was called
as Jorge’s temperature rose to 41°C. The patient also experienced
chills and exhibited respiratory distress, nausea, vomiting, and
convulsions. Dr. Blanes put him under oxygen, used a suction
machine, and administered hydrocortisone, temporarily easing
the patient’s convulsions. When he regained consciousness, the
patient was asked by Dr. Blaves whether he had a previous heart
ailment or had suffered from chest pains in the past. Jorge replied
he did not. After about 15 minutes, however, Jorge again started
to vomit, showed restlessness, and his convulsions returned. Dr.
Blanes re-applied the emergency measures taken before and, in
addition, valium was administered. Jorge, however, did not respond
to the treatment and slipped into cyanosis, a bluish or purplish
discoloration of the skin or mucous membrane due to deficient
oxygenation of the blood. At around 2:00 a.m., Jorge died. He
was forty years old. The cause of his death was “Ventricular Arrythemia Secondary to Hyperpyrexia and typhoid fever.”
The principal contention of petitioners was that Jorge did not
die of typhoid fever. Instead, his death was due to the wrongful administration of chloromycetin. They contended that had
respondent doctors exercised due care and diligence, they would
not have recommended and rushed the performance of the Widal
Test, hastily concluded that Jorge was suffering from typhoid
fever, and administered chloromycetin without first conducting
sufficient tests on the patient’s compatibility with said drug. They
charged respondent clinic and its directress, Sister Rose Palacio,
with negligence in failing to provide adequate facilities and in
hiring negligent doctors and nurses.
Issues: They agreed to limit the issues on the following:

(1) Whether the death of Jorge Reyes was due to or caused
by the negligence, carelessness, imprudence, and lack of skill or
foresight on the part of defendants;

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

299

(2) Whether respondent Mercy Community Clinic was negligent in the hiring of its employees; and
(3) Whether either party was entitled to damages.

Held: (1) Need for expert testimony to support conclusions as to
causation. — “In the present case, there is no doubt that a physicianpatient relationship existed between respondent doctors and Jorge
Reyes. Respondents were thus duty-bound to use at least the same
level of care that any reasonably competent doctor would use to
treat a condition under the same circumstances.
It is breach of this duty which constitutes actionable malpractice. As to this aspect of medical malpractice, the determination
of the reasonable level of care and the breach thereof, expert
testimony is essential. Inasmuch as the causes of the injuries involved in malpractice actions are determinable only in the light of
scientific knowledge, it has been recognized that expert testimony
is usually necessary to support the conclusion as to causation.’’
(2) When expert testimony may be dispensed. — “There is a case
when expert testimony may be dispensed with and that is under
the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. Petitioners asserted in the Court
of Appeals that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies to the
present case because Jorge Reyes was merely experiencing fever
and chills for five days and was fully conscious, coherent, and
ambulant when he went to the hospital. Yet, he died after only
ten hours from the time of his admission.
This contention was rejected by the appellate court. x x x

We agree with the ruling of the Court of Appeals. In Ramos
vs. Court of Appeals (321 SCRA 584 [1999].), the question was
whether a surgeon, an anesthesiologist, and a hospital should be
made liable for the comatose condition of a patient scheduled for
cholecystectomy.

In that case, the patient was given anesthesia prior to her
operation. Noting that the patient was neurologically sound at
the time of her operation, the Court applied the doctrine of res
ipsa loquitur as mental brain damage does not normally occur in
a gallblader operation in the absence of negligence of the anesthesiologist. Taking judicial notice that anesthesia procedures had
become so common that even an ordinary person could tell if it
was administered properly, we allowed the testimony of a witness
who was not an expert.
In this case, while it is true that the patient died just a few

300

TORTS

Art. 2179

hours after professional medical assistance was rendered, there
is really nothing unusual or extraordinary about his death. Prior
to his admission, the patient already had recurring fevers and
chills for five days unrelieved by the analgesic, antipyretic, and
antibiotics given him by his wife. This shows that he had been
suffering from a serious illness and professional medical help
came too late for him.’’

(3) Application of res ipsa loquitur not justified. — “Respondents
alleged failure to observe due care was not immediately apparent to a layman so as to justify application of res ipsa loquitur.
The question required expert opinion on the alleged breach by
respondents of the standard of care required by the circumstances.
Furthermore, on the issue of the correctness of her diagnosis,
no presumption of negligence can be applied to Dr. Marlyn Rico.’’

(4) Petitioners’ expert witness. — “Petitioners contend that: (1)
Dr. Marlyn Rico hastily and erroneously relied upon the Widal
test, diagnosed Jorge’s illness as typhoid fever, and immediately
prescribed the administration of the antibiotic chloromycetin; and
(2) Dr. Marvie Blanes erred in ordering the administration of the
second dose of 500 milligrams of chloromycetin barely three hours
after the first was given. Petitioners presented the testimony of
Dr. Apolinar Vacalares, Chief Pathologist of the Northern Mindanao Training Hospital, Cagayan de Oro City, who performed an
autopsy on the body of Jorge Reyes. Dr. Vacalares testified that,
based on his findings during the autopsy, Jorge Reyes did not
die of typhoid fever but of shock undetermined, which could be
due to allergic reaction or chloromycetin overdose. We are not
persuaded.

First. While petitioners presented Dr. Apolinar Vacalares as
an expert witness, we do not find him to be so as he is not a
specialist on infectious diseases like typhoid fever. Furthermore,
although he may have had extensive experience in performing
autopsies, he admitted that he had yet to do one on the body of a
typhoid victim at the time he conducted the postmortem on Jorge
action is contractual. Where the essential claim of the action is a breach of a duty imposed
by law upon the relationship of attorney/client and not of the contract itself, the action is
in tort. (Pancake House, Inc. v. Redmond, 239 Kan. 83, 716 P. 2d 575 [1986].)
23
The contract or undertaking of the lawyer helps define the boundaries of his duties.
For instance, a retainer agreement may limit the scope of the lawyer’s representation to
particular stages of a case or to certain aspects of a legal problem.
24
The lawyer-client relationship required is not necessarily a relationship between

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

301

Reyes. It is also plain from his testimony that he has treated only
about three cases of typhoid fever. x x x He is thus not qualified
to prove that Dr. Marlyn Rico erred in her diagnosis. Both lower
courts were therefore correct in discarding his testimony, which
is really inadmissible.

In Ramos, the defendants presented the testimony of a pulmonologist to prove that brain injury was due to oxygen deprivation after the patient had bronchospasms triggered by her
allergic response to a drug, and not due to faulty intubation by
the anesthesiologist. As the issue was whether the intubation was
properly performed by an anesthesiologist, we rejected the opinion of the pulmonologist on the ground that he was not: (1) an
anesthesiologist who could enlighten the court about anesthesia
practice, procedure, and their complications; nor (2) an allergologist who could properly advance expert opinion on allergic mediated processes; nor (3) a pharmacologist who could explain the
pharmacologic and toxic effects of the drug allegedly responsible
for the bronchospasms.’’

(5) Respondents’ expert witnesses. — “Second. On the other hand,
the two doctors presented by respondents clearly were experts on
the subject. They vouched for the correctness of Dr. Marlyn Rico’s
diagnosis. Dr. Peter Gotiong, a diplomate whose specialization is
infectious diseases and microbiology and an associate professor at
the Southwestern University College of Medicine and the Gullas
College of Medicine, testified that he has already treated over a
thousand cases of typhoid fever. According to him, when a case
of typhoid fever is suspected, the Widal test is normally used,
and if the 1:320 results of the Widal test on Jorge Reyes had been
presented to him along with the patient’s history, his impression
would also be that the patient was suffering from typhoid fever. As
to the treatment of the disease, he stated that chloromycetin was
the drug of choice. He also explained that despite the measures
taken by respondent doctors and the intravenous administration
of two doses of chloromycetin, complications of the disease could
not be discounted. x x x

As regards Dr. Vacalares’ finding during the autopsy that the
deceased’s gastro-intestinal tract was normal, Dr. Rico explained
that, while hyperplasia in the payer’s patches or layers of the
small intestines is present in typhoid fever, the same may not
always be grossly visible and a microscope was needed to see
the texture of the cells.

302

TORTS

Art. 2179

Respondents also presented the testimony of Dr. Ibarra T.
Panopio who is a member of the Philippine and American Board
of Pathology, an examiner of the Philippine Board of Pathology,
and chief pathologist at the Metro Cebu Community Hospital,
Perpetual Succor Hospital, and the Andres Soriano Jr. Memorial
Medical Center. He stated that, as a clinical pathologist, he recognized that the Widal test is used for typhoid patients, although he
did not encourage its use because a single test would only give
a presumption necessitating that the test be repeated, becoming
more conclusive at the second and third weeks of the disease. He
corroborated Dr. Gotiong’s testimony that the danger with typhoid
fever is really the possible complications which could develop
like perforation, hemorrhage, as well as liver and cerebral complications. As regards the 1:320 results of the Widal test on Jorge
Reyes, Dr. Panopio stated that no additional information could be
obtained from a higher ratio. He also agreed with Dr. Gotiong that
hyperplasia in the payer’s patches may be microscopic.’’

(6) Observance of due care required under the circumstances. —
“Indeed, the standard contemplated is not what is actually the
average merit among all known practitioners from the best to
the worst and from the most to the least experienced, but the
reasonable average merit among the ordinarily good physicians.
Here, Dr. Marlyn Rico did not depart from the reasonable standard
recommended by the experts as she in fact observed the due care
required under the circumstances. Though the Widal test is not
conclusive, it remains a standard diagnostic test for typhoid fever
and, in the present case, greater accuracy through repeated testing
was rendered unobtainable by the early death of the patient. The
results of the Widal test and the patient’s history of fever with
chills for five days, taken with the fact that typhoid fever was
then prevalent as indicated by the fact that the clinic had been
getting about 15 to 20 typhoid cases a month, were sufficient to
give upon any doctor of reasonable skill the impression that Jorge
Reyes had typhoid fever.
Dr. Rico was also justified in recommending the administration
of the drug chloromycetin, the drug of choice for typhoid fever.
The burden of proving that Jorge Reyes was suffering from any
other illness rested with the petitioners. As they failed to present
expert opinion on this, preponderant evidence to support their
contention is clearly absent. x x x

Third. Petitioners contend that respondent Dr. Marvie Blanes,
who took over from Dr. Rico, was negligent in ordering the

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

303

intravenous administration of two doses of 500 milligrams of
chloromycetin at an interval of less than three hours. Petitioners
claim that Jorge Reyes died of anaphylactic shock or possibly from
overdose as the second dose should have been administered five
to six hours after the first, per instruction of Dr. Marlyn Rico.
As held by the Court of Appeals, however:
‘That chloromycetin was likewise a proper prescription
is best established by medical authority. Wilson, et al., in
Harrison’s Principle of Internal Medicine, 12th ed. write that
chlorampenicol (which is the generic of chloromycetin) is
the drug of choice for typhoid fever and that no drug has
yet proven better in promoting a favorable clinical response.
“Chlorampenicol (Chloromycetin) is specifically indicated
for bacterial meningitis, typhoid fever, rickettsial infections,
bacteriodes infections, etc.” (PIMS Annual, 1994, p. 211) The
dosage likewise including the first administration of five hundred
milligrams (500 mg.) at around nine o’clock in the evening and the
second dose at around 11:30 the same night was still within medically acceptable limits, since the recommended dose of chloromycetin
is one (1) gram every six (6) hours. (cf. Pediatric Drug Handbook.
1st Ed., Philippine Pediatric Society, Committee on Therapeutics and Toxicology, 1996). The intravenous route is likewise
correct. (Mansser, O’Nick, Pharmacology and Therapeutics) Even
if the test was not administered by the physician-on-duty, the
evidence introduced that it was Dra. Blanes who interpreted
the results remain uncontroverted. (Decision, pp. 16-17) Once
more, this Court rejects any claim of professional negligence
in this regard.

As regards anaphylactic shock, the usual way of guarding
against it prior to the administration of a drug, is the skin test.
x x x What all this means legally is that even if the deceased
suffered from an anaphylactic shock, this, of itself, would
not yet establish the negligence of the appellee-physicians
for all that the law requires of them is that they perform the
standard tests and perform standard procedures. The law
cannot require them to predict every possible reaction to all
drugs administered. The onus probandi was on the appellants
to establish, before the trial court, that the appellee-physicians
ignored standard medical procedure, prescribed and administered medication with recklessness and exhibited an absence
of the competence and skills expected of general practitioners
similarly situated.’

The standard contemplated for doctors is simply the reasonably average must among ordinarily good physicians.’’ (Reyes vs.

4. The accused, being then the attending anesthesiologist and
surgeon, respectively, were charged with reckless imprudence for failing
to supply or store sufficient provisions and facilities necessary before,
during and/or after the surgical operation of a patient, causing by such
failure the untimely death of said patient the following day.
Facts: The patient Lydia Umali (LU) was examined by petitioner
Dra. Cruz, surgeon, who found a “myoma’’ in her uterus and
scheduled her for a hysterectomy operation. She was re-operated
in another hospital where she was transferred because there was
blood oozing from the abdominal incision. While petitioner was
closing the abdominal wall, the patient died. Her death certificate
states “shock’’ as the immediate cause of death and “Disseminated
Intravascular Coagulation’’ (DIG) as the antecedent cause.

In convicting the petitioner, the Municipal Circuit Trial Court
found the following circumstances as sufficient basis to conclude
that she was indeed negligent in the performance of the operation:
“. . . , the clinic was untidy, there was lack of provision like
blood and oxygen to prepare for any contingency that might
happen during the operation. The manner and the fact that
the patient was brought to the San Pablo District Hospital for
reoperation indicates that there was something wrong in the
manner in which Dra. Cruz conducted the operation. There
was no showing that before the operation, accused Dra. Cruz
had conducted a cardio pulmonary clearance or any typing of
the blood of the patient. It was (sic) said in medical parlance
that the ‘the abdomen of the person is a temple of surprises’
because you do not know the whole thing the moment it was
open (sic) and surgeon must be prepared for any eventuality
thereof. The patient (sic) chart which is a public document was
not presented because it is only there that we could determine
the condition of the patient before the surgery.’’

The court also noticed in Exh. “F-1’’ that the sister of the
deceased wished to postpone the operation but the patient was
prevailed upon by Dra. Cruz to proceed with the surgery. The
court finds that Lydia Umali died because of the negligence and
carelessness of the surgeon Dra. Ninevetch Cruz because of loss

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

305

of blood during the operation of the deceased for evident unpreparedness and for lack of skill, the reason why the patient was
brought for operation at the San Pablo City District Hospital. As
such, the surgeon should answer for such negligence.

With respect to Dra. Lina Ercillo, the anaesthesiologist, there
is no evidence to indicate that she should be held jointly liable
with Dra. Cruz who actually did the operation.”
The Regional Trial Court reiterated the abovementioned findings of the MTCC and upheld the latter’s declaration of “incompetency, negligence and lack of foresight and skill of appellant
(herein petitioner) in handling the subject patient before and after
the operation.”

And likewise affirming the petitioner’s conviction, the Court
of Appeals echoed similar observations, thus:
“. . . While we may grant that the untidiness and filthiness
of the clinic may not by itself indicate negligence, it nevertheless shows the absence of due care and supervision over her
subordinate employees. Did this unsanitary condition permeate
the operating room? Were the surgical instruments properly
sterilized? Could the conditions in the OR have contributed to
the infection of the patient? Only the petitioner could answer
these, but she opted not to testify. This could only give rise
to the presumption that she has nothing good to testify on
her defense. Anyway, the alleged ‘unverified statement of the
prosecution witness’ remains unchallenged and unrebutted.

Likewise undisputed is the prosecution’s version indicating the following facts: that the accused asked the patient’s
relatives to buy Tagamet capsules while the operation was
already in progress; that after an hour, they were also asked
to buy type “A” blood for the patient; that after the surgery,
they were again asked to procure more type ‘A’ blood, but such
was not anymore available from the source; that the oxygen
given to the patient was empty; and that the son-in-law of the
patient, together with a driver of the petitioner, had to rush to
the San Pablo City District Hospital to get the much-needed
oxygen. All these conclusively show that the petitioner had
not prepared for any unforeseen circumstances before going
into the first surgery, which was not emergency in nature, but
was elective or pre-scheduled; she had no ready antibiotics,
no prepared blood, properly typed and cross-matched, and

306

TORTS

Art. 2179

no sufficient oxygen supply.

Moreover, there are a lot of questions that keep nagging
Us. Was the patient given any cardio-pulmonary clearance,
or at least a clearance by an internist, which are standard
requirements before a patient is subjected to surgery. Did the
petitioner determine as part of the pre-operative evaluation, the
bleeding parameters of the patient, such as bleeding time and
clotting time? There is no showing that these were done. The
petitioner just appears to have been in a hurry to perform the
operation, even as the family wanted a postponement to April
6, 1991. Obviously, she did not prepare the patient; neither
did she get the family’s consent to the operation. Moreover,
she did not prepare a medical chart with instructions for the
patient’s care. If she did all these, proof thereof should have
been offered. But there is none. Indeed, these are overwhelming evidence of ‘recklessness and imprudence.”’

Issue: Was petitioner guilty of inexcusable lack of precaution
in the treatment of her patient?

Held: No. (1) Doctors are not insurers against unusual consequences.
— “Doctors are protected by a special rule of law. They are not
guarantors of care. They do not even warrant a good result. They
are not insurers against mishaps or unusual consequences. Furthermore, they are not liable for honest mistakes of judgment. . . .

The present case against petitioner is in the nature of a medical malpractice suit, which in simplest terms is the type of claim
which a victim has available to him or her to redress a wrong
committed by a medical professional which has caused bodily
harm. In this jurisdiction, however, such claims are most often
brought as a civil action for damages under Article 2176 of the
Civil Code, and in some instances, as a criminal case under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code with which the civil action for
damages is impliedly instituted. It is via the latter type of action
that the heirs of the deceased sought redress for the petitioner’s
alleged imprudence and negligence in treating the deceased thereby
causing her death.’’
(2) Circumstances insufficient to sustain a conviction. — “This
Court, however, holds differently and finds the foregoing circumstances insufficient to sustain a judgment of conviction against
the petitioner for the crime of reckless imprudence resulting in
homicide. The elements of reckless imprudence are: (1) that the
offender does or fails to do an act; (2) that the doing or the fail-

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

307

ure to do that act is voluntary; (3) that it be without malice; (4)
that material damage results from the reckless imprudence; and
(5) that there is inexcusable lack of precaution on the part of the
offender, taking into consideration his employment or occupation,
degree of intelligence, physical condition, and other circumstances
regarding persons, time and place.’’

(3) Expert testimony usually necessary to support conclusion as
to causation. — “Whether or not a physician has committed an
‘inexcusable lack of precaution’ in the treatment of his patient is
to be determined according to the standard of care observed by
other members of the profession in good standing under similar
circumstances bearing in mind the advanced state of the profession
at the time of treatment or the present state of medical science.

In the recent case of Leonila Garcia-Rueda vs. Wilfred L. Pascasio,
et al., this Court stated that in accepting a case, a doctor in effect
represents that, having the needed training and skill possessed
by physicians and surgeons practicing in the same field, he will
employ such training, care and skill in the treatment of his patients. He therefore has a duty to use at least the same level of
care that any other reasonably competent doctor would use to treat
a condition under the same circumstances. It is in this aspect of
medical malpractice that expert testimony is essential to establish
not only the standard of care of the profession but also that the
physician’s conduct in the treatment and care falls below such
standard. Further, inasmuch as the causes of the injuries involved
in malpractice actions are determinable only in the light of scientific knowledge, it has been recognized that expert testimony
is usually necessary to support the conclusion as to causation.
Immediately apparent from a review of the records of this
case is the absence of any expert testimony on the matter of the
standard of care employed by other physicians of good standing
in the conduct of similar operations. The prosecution’s expert
witnesses in the persons of Dr. Floresto Arizala and Dr. Nieto
Salvador, Jr. of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) only
testified as to the possible cause of death but did not venture to
illuminate the court on the matter of the standard of care that
petitioner should have exercised.’’
(4) Expert opinion sadly lacking in the case at bench. — “All
three courts below bewail the inadequacy of the facilities of the
clinic and its untidiness; the lack of provisions such as blood, oxygen, and certain medicines; the failure to subject the patient to a
cardio-pulmonary test prior to the operation; the omission of any

308

TORTS

Art. 2179

form of blood typing before transfusion; and even the subsequent
transfer of Lydia to the San Pablo Hospital and the reoperation
performed on her by the petitioner. But while it may be true that
the circumstances pointed out by the courts below seemed beyond
cavil to constitute reckless imprudence on the part of the surgeon,
this conclusion is still best arrived at not through the educated
surmises nor conjectures of laymen, including judges, but by the
unquestionable knowledge of expert witnesses. For whether a
physician or surgeon has exercised the requisite degree of skill
and care in the treatment of his patient is, in the generality of
cases, a matter of expert opinion.

The deference of courts to the expert opinion of qualified physicians stems from its realization that the latter possess unusual
technical skills which laymen in most instances are incapable of
intelligently evaluating. Expert testimony should have been offered to prove that the circumstances cited by the courts below
are constitutive of conduct falling below the standard of care
employed by other physicians in good standing when performing the same operation. It must be remembered that when the
qualifications of a physician are admitted, as in the instant case,
there is an inevitable presumption that in proper cases he takes the
necessary precaution and employs the best of his knowledge and
skill in attending to his clients, unless the contrary is sufficiently
established. This presumption is rebuttable by expert opinion
which is so sadly lacking in the case at bench.’’
(5) No cogent proof that death was a consequence of reckless
imprudence. — “Even granting arguendo that the inadequacy of
the facilities and untidiness of the clinic; the lack of provisions;
the failure to conduct pre-operation tests on the patient; and the
subsequent transfer of Lydia to the San Pablo Hospital and the
reoperation performed on her by the petitioner do indicate, even
without expert testimony, that petitioner was recklessly imprudent
in the exercise of her duties as a surgeon, no cogent proof exists
that any of these circumstances caused petitioner’s death. Thus,
the absence of the fourth element of reckless imprudence: that
the injury to the person or property was a consequence of the
reckless imprudence.’’
(6) Burden of establishing doctor’s negligence. — “In litigations
involving medical negligence, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing appellant’s negligence and for a reasonable conclusion
of negligence, there must be proof of breach of duty on the part
of the surgeon as well as a causal connection of such breach and

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

309

the resulting death of his patient.

In Chan Lugay vs. St. Luke’s Hospital, Inc., where the attending
physician was absolved of liability for the death of the complainant’s wife and newborn baby, this Court held that:
‘In order that there may be a recovery for an injury, however, it must be shown that the ‘injury for which recovery
is sought must be the legitimate consequence of the wrong
done; the connection between the negligence and the injury
must be a direct and natural sequence of events, unbroken by
intervening efficient causes.’ In other words, the negligence
must be the proximate cause of the injury. For, ‘negligence,
no matter in what it consists cannot create a right of action
unless it is the proximate cause of the injury complained of.’
And ‘the proximate cause of an injury is that cause, which, in
natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any efficient
intervening cause, produces the injury, and without which the
result would not have occurred.’”

(7) Petitioner civilly, but not criminally liable. — “This Court has
no recourse but to rely on the expert testimonies rendered by both
prosecution and defense witnesses that substantiate rather than
contradict petitioner’s allegation that the cause of Lydia’s death
was DIC which, as attested to by an expert witness, cannot be
attributed to the petitioner’s fault or negligence. The probability
that Lydia’s death was caused by DIC was unrebutted during
trial and has engendered in the mind of this Court a reasonable
doubt as to the petitioner’s guilt. Thus, her acquittal of the crime
of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide.

While we condole with the family of Lydia Umali, our hands
are bound by the dictates of justice and fair dealing which hold
inviolable the right of an accused to be presumed innocent until
proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Nevertheless, this Court
finds the petitioner civilly liable for the death of Lydia Umali, for
while a conviction of a crime requires proof beyond reasonable
doubt, only a preponderance of evidence is required to establish
civil liability.’’

(8) Award of moral and exemplary damages proper. — “The petitioner is a doctor in whose hands a patient puts his life and limb.
For insufficiency of evidence this Court was not able to render
a sentence of conviction but it is not blind to the reckless and
imprudent manner in which the petitioner carried out her duties.
A precious life has been lost and the circumstances leading

310

TORTS

Art. 2179

thereto exacerbated the grief of those left behind. The heirs of the
deceased continue to feel the loss of their mother up to the present
time and this Court is aware that no amount of compassion and
commiseration nor words of bereavement can suffice to assuage
the sorrow felt for the loss of a loved one. Certainly, the award
of moral and exemplary damages in favor of the heirs of Lydia
Umali are proper in the instant case.’’ (Cruz vs. Court of Appeals,
282 SCRA 188 [1997].)

5. A piece of rubber glove was left in the abdomen of a patient
after a caesarean section.

Facts: Dr. Batiquin performed a simple caesarian section on
F. Villegas (V). Soon after leaving the hospital, V, began to suffer
abdominal pains and complained of being feverish. The results of
many examinations conducted by Dr. Kho impelled her to suggest
that V. submit to another surgery.

When Dr. Kho opened the abdomen of V, she found a “foreign body’’ which looked like a piece of ‘‘rubber glove,’’ and this
“foreign body’’ was the cause of the infection of the ovaries and
consequently, of all the discomforts suffered by V after her delivery.
Issue: Are the requisites for the application of the doctrine of
res ipsa loquitur present?

Held: (1) Doctrine applicable to case. — “In the instant case,
all the requisites for recourse to the doctrine are present. First,
the entire proceedings of the caesarean section were under the
exclusive control of Dr. Batiquin.

In this light, the private respondents were bereft of direct
evidence as to the actual culprit or the exact cause of the foreign
object finding its way into private respondent Villegas’s body,
which, needless to say, does not occur unless through the intervention of negligence. Second, since aside from the caesarean section,
private respondent Villegas underwent no other operation which
could have caused the offending piece of rubber to appear in
her uterus, it stands to reason that such could only have been a
by-product of the caesarean section performed by Dr. Batiquin.
The petitioners, in this regard, failed to overcome the presumption of negligence arising from resort to the doctrine of res ipsa
loquitur. Dr. Batiquin is, therefore, liable for negligently leaving
behind a piece of rubber in private respondent Villegas’s abdomen

and for all the adverse affects thereof.’’

(2) Role of the medical profession. — “This Court reiterates its
recognition of the vital role the medical profession plays in the
lives of the people, and the State’s compelling interest to enact
measures to protect the public from ‘the potentially deadly effects
of incompetence and ignorance in those who would undertake
to treat our bodies and minds for disease or trauma.’ Indeed, a
physician is bound to serve the interest of his patients ‘with the
greatest of solicitude, giving them always his best talent and skill.’

Through her tortious conduct, the petitioner endangered the
life of Flotilde Villegas, in violation of her profession’s rigid ethical code and in contravention of the legal standards set forth for
professionals, in general, and members of the medical profession,
in particular.’’ (Batiquin vs. Court of Appeals, 71 SCAD 748, 258
SCRA 334 [1996].)

Lawyer (or attorney) malpractice.
(1) Scope of malpractice. — Lawyer malpractice is ordinarily an economic tort, causing financial harm without personal
injury or property damage. It deals only with violation of a
lawyer’s duty arising out of the lawyer’s representation of a
client. Lawyer malpractice, in other words, entails breach of
a duty created by the contract or by the relationship with the
client. Indeed, in some cases the claim may be brought as a
contract claim as well as a negligence claim22 and the contract
itself may not only create duties but limit them.23

Lawyers may be liable to clients for reasons having nothing
to do with malpractice. Negligent driving that injures a client
is surely actionable, and so is assault. Lawyers may be chargeable with defamation, and malicious prosecution, or indeed,
any tort. But while the lawyer-client relationship may facilitate
such torts, they are not ordinarily part of the representation
and not malpractice.
(2) Forms and examples. — Malpractice itself takes many
forms. For example, fiduciary breach aside, lawyers may fail to
recognize a cause of action or may fail to file a claim or defense
within the time limits imposed, may inadequately prepare for
trial, or use substandard strategies or techniques in trial itself.

312

TORTS

Art. 2179

However, malpractice claims are not confined to litigation
malpractice; they can arise in any kind of representation. Lawyers
may be negligent in drafting or recording documents in search
of records, negotiating a settlement or advising its acceptance,
in giving advice, and possibly even in accepting a case beyond
their experience and competence.

Each field of law practice tends to have its own unique
problems. Representation of several clients jointly — both
spouses in preparing wills, for example — may run risks that
the lawyer will have conflicts of interests or will face dilemmas of confidentiality unlike those routinely faced by, say, a
personal injury lawyer.

(3) Elements and rules of liability. — The plaintiff must first
show a lawyer-client relationship.24 The contract or relationship
establishes the general duty to provide professional care. Given
the relationship, the commercial loss rule does not apply to
eliminate liability for negligence. The remaining elements are
those of other negligence cases. The plaintiff must prove a breach
of the duty, cause in fact, proximate cause, and damages.
Additional elements may be required in the case of criminalcase malpractice. The duties include the duties of professional
care and competence, but also includes the special duties of
fiduciaries and the duty to provide certain information to the
client, somewhat analogous to the obligation of medical practitioners to provide patients with information.

Lawyers are also liable vicariously for the negligence of their
general partners committed within the scope of their agency,
and within limits, for the negligence of outside counsel they
have associated in the case.

(4) Standard of care. — Lawyer codes of conduct or ethics,
adopted by countries for disciplinary purposes,25 may be relevant to a court determining the civil obligations of lawyers, but
they do not create a cause of action against lawyers. Instead,
subject to slight variations in expression, attorneys owe clients
the skill, care, knowledge, and diligence exercised by reasonable and prudent lawyers in similar circumstances.26 Under
this standard, not every professional mistake is negligence. In

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

313

fact, the courts often say that lawyers are not liable for good
faith errors in judgment but, taken literally, this would virtually
eliminate all lawyer liability. The “error of judgment’’ statement
seems to apply only when reasonable professional judgments
could differ, in which case the lawyer simply has not violated
the professional standard.
The standard is the usual objective standard. Good faith of
the lawyer is no defense if he violates the standard. As with
medical malpractice, specialists may be held to the standard of
their speciality rather than to the standard of lawyers generally.

(5) Expert testimony requirement. — Courts now not only admit but generally require expert testimony to show the standard
of care. If it is not obvious that the lawyer’s conduct breached
the standard, then expert testimony may be required to show
that breach as well. Similarly, if the defendant is a specialist
(e.g., personal injury or tax lawyer), a witness who knows the
specialist’s standards is required or appropriate.
Courts seldom mention res ipsa loquitur in lawyer malpractice
cases except occasionally to say that it does not apply. However,
courts do recognize a common knowledge exception to the
expert testimony requirement to cover the case in which the
standard and its breach are so clear that no expert testimony
is required to establish them. That is the case with one of the
most routine kinds of malpractice, failures to act within the
time permitted, as where the lawyer with opportunity to do so
fails to file a suit within the statute of limitations period. (D.B.
Dobbs, op. cit., pp. 1385-1390.)
(6) Causation element. — In legal malpractice cases, the causation element often poses a substantial hurdle. Beyond establishing the attorney’s negligence, the legal malpractice plaintiff
must show by a preponderance of the evidence that if it had
not been for that attorney’s negligence he would have prevailed
in the underlying action.
Example: If L, an attorney, representing P in a legal action
against D, fails to file the complaint within the statute of
limitations, there is a clear breach of professional custom.27

314

TORTS

Art. 2179

In order to prevail in a malpractice action against L, P must
show that he probably would have prevailed in his action
against D had L filed the complaint in a timely manner.
In essence, the legal malpractice action requires the resolution of two conflicts: the initial lawsuit and the malpractice action — in essence a trial within a trial. (Diamond, Levine and
Madden, op. cit., p. 109.)
(7) Lawyer’s tort liability to non-clients. — Non-clients refer
to any person other than those who engaged the attorney as
their counsel.

In most jurisdictions, the rule remains that “absent fraud or
other bad faith, an attorney is not liable for negligent conduct
to nonclient third party.’’ In other words, there is no duty owed
to a non-client to avoid negligently inflicted economic harm.

Some jurisdictions have permitted a limited expansion of the
duty beyond clients in certain particularly compelling circumstances. Where an attorney understood that the client’s intent
was to benefit a third party, in some contexts that third party
is permitted to sue for legal malpractice. The situation often
arises in the context of wills, where an intended beneficiary
cause is deprived of receiving that which the deceased testator
intended because of the negligence of an attorney or notary.
The logic behind this limited exception to the rule restricting
liability
to clients is that if a strict privity requirement
were used, there would be no one to bring an action against
the negligent
attorney because the person who contracted
with the attorney is dead.
Beyond the will context, courts have proceeded cautiously,
rarely extending duty to those not in privity. For example, if
an attorney negligently prepares an opinion letter for a client,
few jurisdictions would permit a legal claim by someone who
foreseeably relies on the opinion letter. Much of the reluctance
to expand a duty to third parties has been out of concern over
the impact such liability could have on the attorney-client relationship.
As the California Surpreme Court noted:

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

315

“To make an attorney liable for negligent confidential
advice not only to the client who enters into a transaction
in reliance upon the advice but also to the other parties to
the transaction with whom the client deals at arm’s length
would inject undesirable self-protective reservations into
the attorney’s counseling role . . . . The attorney’s preoccupation or concern with the possibility of claims based on
mere negligence . . . . by any with whom his client might
deal ‘would prevent him from devoting his entire energies
to his clients’ interests.’ ’’

A related rationale for a narrowly defined duty is that if a
third party seeks to validate information, he can hire his own
attorney, with whom he will be in privity. There usually no
impediment (other than cost, of course) to a person hiring his
own attorney to determine, for example, whether there are any
encumbrances on property he is considering to purchase. (Ibid.,
pp. 188-189.)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:

1. Respondent lawyer was charged by his clients with gross negligence in not seasonably filing their motion for reconsideration and in
not perfecting an appeal from the trial court’s order of dismissal.

Facts: Respondent MCG was the counsel of plaintiffs to recover
a parcel of land and for an accounting of the fruits thereof.
On July 23, 1974 respondent MCG received a copy of the
order in the said case dismissing it on the grounds of laches and
prior judgment. On August 22 or the last day of the reglementary
period within which to appeal or file a motion for new trial, he
filed, through an associate, a motion for an extension of fifteen
days or up to September 6 within which to file a motion for reconsideration. The motion was granted but MCG was not able to
file the motion for reconsideration.

Instead, on the last day, September 6, he sent by registered
mail a motion for a second extension of ten days. On September
16, the last day of the second extension sought by him, he filed a
motion for a third extension of forty-eight hours. The motion for
reconsideration was mailed on September 18, 1974, the last day
of the third extension.
The trial court denied the second and third motions for extension on the ground that the order of dismissal was already final.

316

TORTS

Art. 2179

It also denied MCG’s motion for reconsideration of the orders
denying his motions for extension.
MCG then filed in the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari
and mandamus wherein he assailed the orders denying his motions
for extension. The Court of Appeals dismissed his petition. The
Supreme Court did not give due course to the appeal of respondent’s clients from the decisions of the Court of Appeals.

On September 6, 1976, complainants filed with the Supreme
Court a joint affidavit charging Atty. MCG with gross negligence
in not seasonably filing the motion for reconsideration and in
not perfecting an appeal from the trial court’s order of dismissal.

Explaining why he filed a motion for reconsideration instead
of appealing forthwith from the order of dismissal, the respondent
testified that there was vacillation among the eight plaintiffs as to
whether they would appeal; that there were no available funds
to defray the expenses of an appeal since not all of the plaintiffs
were inclined to appeal; that some of the plaintiffs wanted to
hire another lawyer; that when the period was about to expire,
the plaintiffs changed their minds and decided to continue with
the respondent’s services and that the eldest plaintiff died and
plaintiffs’ desire to appeal was communicated to the respondent
only after the funeral.
Issue: Should the respondent be exculpated from the charge
of negligence?

Held: (1) Respondent’s explanation not entirely satisfactory. — “The
[above] explanation is not entirely satisfactory. It is not sufficient
to exculpate the respondent from the charge of negligence. His
filing of motions for extension on the last day and sending them
by registered mail (thus giving the court insufficient time to act
before the extension sought had expired) and his omission to
verify whether his second motion for extension was granted are
indicative of lack of competence, diligence and fidelity in the
dispatch of his clients’ business.
If this clients were wavering on whether to appeal the order
of dismissal, he could have in the meantime, but within the thirtyday period, filed his motion for reconsideration.’’

(2) Respondent could have easily avoided the loss of his clients’
right to appeal. — “In this case, had the respondent been more
conscientious or experienced, he could have easily avoided the loss
of his clients’ right to appeal by filing the motion for reconsideration within the thirty-day period. He could have even withdrawn

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

317

from the case with his clients’ consent and required them to get
another lawyer to perfect their appeal.’’

(3) Order of dismissal presumed valid or correct. — “However,
the fact that the complainants and their six co-plaintiffs lost the
right to appeal would not necessarily mean that they were damaged. The lower court’s order of dismissal has in its favor the
presumption of validity or correctness. Indeed, an examination of
that order discloses that the trial court painstakingly studied the
motion to dismiss and carefully rationalized its order. It found that
the action was filed more than forty years after the disputed land
was registered in the name of defendants’ predecessor-in-interest.

Where a judgment became final through the fault of the lawyer
who did not appeal therefrom, that fact alone is not a sufficient
ground for the losing party to recover damages from his lawyer
since the action for damages rests ‘on the unsubstantiated and
arbitrary supposition of the injustice of the decision which became
final through the fault and negligence’ of the lawyer (Heridia vs.
Salinas, 10 Phil. 157, 162; See Ventanilla vs. Centeno, 110 Phil. 811,
where the lawyer who failed to perfect an appeal was ordered to
pay his client two hundred pesos as nominal damages).’’
(4) Respondent admonished. — “In view of the foregoing and
considering complainants’ affidavit of desistance in this case, drastic
disciplinary action against the respondent is not warranted. But he
is admonished to exercise care and circumspection in attending to
the affairs of his clients. A repetition of the same irregularity will
be treated with more severity. A copy of this decision should be
attached to respondent’s personal record.’’ (Roque vs. Gunigundo,
89 SCRA 178 [1979].)

2. The complainant against respondent lawyer was declared in

Most have patterned their rules on models drafted by the American Bar Association
the current version of which is found in the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.
The “Code of Professional Responsibility’’ was promulgated by the Supreme Court on
June 21, 1988. (see Chap. 9.)
26
Some courts express this by saying said that attorneys must exercise ordinary care
or the care of a reasonable person, but they then modify this statement by adding that

318

TORTS

Art. 2179

to appear at the hearing.

Facts: This is an administrative action against the respondent
attorney for gross negligence and misconduct, for failure to give
his entire devotion to the interest of his client, warm zeal in the
maintenance and defense of his rights, and exertion of his utmost
learning and ability in the prosecution and defense of his client,
and for not taking steps to protect the interests of his client in
the face of an adverse decision.
At the hearing of a case where the complainant was one of the
defendants, noting that his counsel had not yet arrived, prevailed
upon respondent Atty. DA who was then in court, to appear as
counsel for her. Upon noticing that the plaintiffs and their counsel
were not also present in court, the respondent, instead of asking
for a postponement, moved for the dismissal of the case. His motion was granted and the case was again dismissed. Thereafter,
the plaintiffs filed a motion for the reconsideration of the order,
to which the respondent filed an opposition in behalf of the defendants, and the motion was denied. Whereupon, the plaintiffs
appealed to the Court of Appeals. After appropriate proceedings,
the appellate court set aside the order of dismissal and remanded
the case to the lower court for further proceedings.
At the hearing before the Court of First Instance, the respondent was again prevailed upon by the complainant to appear in
his behalf. The respondent entered a “special appearance” for
the complainant and thereafter argued that the interest of justice
would best be served if the defendants were allowed to file an
action for quieting of title and the case heard jointly with the action for forcible entry. Finding merit in the argument, the court
ordered the defendant Cesario Adarne to file an action for quieting
of title within one (1) week and the plaintiffs to answer the same
within the reglementary period, after which both cases would be
tried jointly. The hearing was deferred until after the filing of the
action for quieting of title.

Subsequently, the court declared the defendants in default for
their failure to appear at the hearing set for that day and directed
the plaintiffs to present evidence to support their claim.
ordinary care in the case of professionals is the care reasonably expected of other professionals acting under the same or similar circumstances, or by saying that expert testimony
is required to establish the particular standard. (Barth v. Reagan, 139 Ill. 2d 399, 564 N.E.2d

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

319

Issue: Should the judgment of default rendered against the
complainant be attributed to the respondent?

Held: (1) Blame lies with complainant. — “The judgment by
default rendered against the complainant cannot be attributed
to the respondent attorney. The blame lies with the complainant
for having engaged the services of several lawyers to handle his
case without formally withdrawing the authority he had given to
them to appear in his behalf as to place the responsibility upon
the respondent.
To add to the confusion, the complainant had also requested
the clerk of court of the Court of First Instance of Leyte that he
(complainant) be furnished with summons and subpoena accorded
to him. He also filed a motion by himself, thus implying that he
was handling his case personally.’’
(2) Formalities for substitution not complied with. — “It appears
that there have been three changes made of the attorneys for the
complainant in the forcible entry case. x x x However, no formalities whatever were observed in those changes such that the
respondent entered a ‘special appearance’ for the complainant in
order that he could ask for the dismissal of the case for the failure
of the adverse party to prosecute.

The rule followed on matters of substitution of attorneys
as laid down by this Court is that no substitution of attorneys
will be allowed unless there be filed: x x x. Unless the foregoing
formalities are complied with, substitution will not be permitted,
and the attorney who properly appeared last in the cause, before
such application for substitution, will be regarded as the attorney
of record and will be held responsible for the proper conduct of
the cause.’’
(3) An attorney not bound to exercise extraordinary diligence.

1196 [1990]; Waldman v. Levine, 544 A.2d 683, 78 A.L.R. 4th 703 [1988].)
27
This is such an evident breach that expert testimony might be unnecessary for the
plaintiff to prevail.

320

TORTS

Art. 2179

— “Besides, the respondent honestly believed that he had appeared for the complainant only for a special purpose and that
the complainant had agreed to contact his attorney of record to
handle his case after the hearing of October 23, 1964, so that he
did nothing more about it. It was neither gross negligence nor
omission to have entertained such belief
An attorney is not bound to exercise extraordinary diligence,
but only a reasonable degree of care and skill having reference
to the character of the business he undertakes to do. Prone to err
like any other human being, he is not answerable for every error
or mistake, and will be protected as long as he acts honestly and
in good faith to the best of his skill and knowledge.’’

(4) No sufficient proof of culpable malpractice. — “It is well settled
that in disbarment proceedings, the burden of proof rests upon the
complainant and for the Court to exercise its disciplinary powers,
the case against the respondent attorney must be established by
convincing proof. In the instant case, there is no sufficient proof
to warrant the disbarment of the respondent attorney. Neither is
there culpable malpractice to justify his suspension.’’ (Adarne vs.
Aldaba, 83 SCRA 734 [1978].)

3. The complaint was dismissed because two witnesses for the
complainant refused to submit themselves to cross-examination and the
lawyer submitted the case on the basis of the evidence on record.

Facts: Respondent VE was retained to assist complainant in the
prosecution of the person allegedly responsible for her husband’s
death. Respondent presented the complainant and her witnesses.
Two of them refused to submit themselves to cross-examination.
That prompted that fiscal to recommend that the case be dismissed
for insufficiency of evidence. The recommendation was concurred
in by the City Fiscal.
Issue: The primary issue in this case is whether the respondent
was willfully negligent in the performance of his duties as counsel to the complainant to the damage and prejudice of the latter.
Held: (1) Legal presumption of innocence. — “As a rule, an attorney enjoys the legal presumption that he is innocent of the

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

321

charges until the contrary is proved, and, as an officer of the
court, he has performed his duty in accordance with his oath.
(In re Tiongko, 43 Phil. 191.) Thus, in every case of disbarment
the burden of proof lies with the complainant to show that the
respondent is guilty of the acts charged.

In the present case, there is no sufficient evidence showing
that the respondent lawyer violated his oath or was negligent in
handling the complainant’s case. x x x The complainant’s case was
dismissed apparently because of the failure of the complainant’s
witnesses to submit to cross-examination. This is clear from a
reading of Fiscal Agdamag’s memorandum. x x x Atty. Evangelista was, thus, constrained to submit the case on the basis of the
evidence already on record.
These facts do not indicate negligence on the part of the respondent. The complainant who was present during the heading
of October 10, 1972 was fully aware that she still had to present
two of her witnesses for cross-examination on the next scheduled
hearing.’’

(2) Losing in a litigation not a ground for disciplinary action. —
“It would be to place an intolerable burden on a member of the
bar if just because a client failed to obtain what is sought by her
after due exertion of the required effort on his part, he would be
held accountable. Success in a litigation is certainly not the test
of whether or not a lawyer had lived up to his duties to a client.

It is enough that with the thorough preparation of the case
handled by him, he had taken all the steps to prosecute his suit.
If thereafter the result would be the frustration of his client’s
hopes, that is a cause for disappointment, no doubt for him no
less than for his client, but not for disciplinary action. He is more
to be sympathized with than condemned — on the assumption
of course that he did what was expected of him.’’ (Atienza vs.
Evangelista, 80 SCRA 338 [1977].)

Liability of public officers for tortious acts.

(1) Acts done within scope of official authority. — A public officer, whether judicial, quasi-judicial, or executive, is generally
not personally liable to one injured in consequence of an act
performed within the scope of official authority, and in line of
official duty. The rule finds its rationale in the concept which
says that where the public employee is performing the function

322

TORTS

Art. 2179

within the ambit of his authority and the risk of injury to the
public is inherent in the activity, the employee ought not to be
required to bear the risk and, therefore, his or her negligence,
if any, will be regarded as decisional in nature and hence, immune.

(2) Acts done without or in excess of official authority. — On
the other hand, officers and employees of a state are not immune from suit for their own tortious conduct, even where
such conduct is committed in the course of their employment.
If a public officer exceeds the power conferred on him by law,
he cannot shelter himself by the plea that he is a public agent
acting under color of his office, or that the damage was caused
by an act done or omitted under color of office, and not personally. In the eyes of the law, his acts then are wholly without
authority.
This principle of personal liability has been applied to cases
where a public officer removes another officer or discharges an
employee or refuses to reinstate him wrongfully or illegally or in
bad faith. (De Leon & De Leon, Jr., The Law on Public Officers
and Election Law, 2003 Ed., pp. 288-289; see Art. 32, Chap. 4.)
Art. 2180. The obligation imposed by Article 2176
is demandable not only for one’s own acts or omissions, but also for those of persons for whom one
is responsible.
The father and, in case of his death or incapacity,
the mother, are responsible for the damages caused
by the minor children who live in their company.
Guardians are liable for damages caused by the
minors or incapacitated persons who are under their
authority and live in their company.
The owners and managers of an establishment
or enterprise are likewise responsible for damages
caused by their employees in the service of the
branches in which the latter are employed or on the
occasion of their functions.
Employers shall be liable for the damages caused

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

323

by their employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their assigned tasks, even
though the former are not engaged in any business
or industry.
The State is responsible in like manner when
it acts through a special agent; but not when the
damage has been caused by the official to whom
the task done properly pertains, in which case what
is provided in Article 2176 shall be applicable.
Lastly, teachers or heads of establishments of
arts and trades shall be liable for damages caused
by their pupils and students or apprentices, so long
as they remain in their custody.
The responsibility treated of in this article shall
cease when the persons herein mentioned prove that
they observed all the diligence of a good father of
a family to prevent damage. (1903a)
Principle of vicarious liability.
(1) Concept. — Under this principle, a person is made liable
not only for torts committed by himself, but also for torts committed by others with whom he has certain relationship and
for whom he is responsible, subject to certain conditions. It is
called the doctrine of imputed negligence under Anglo-American
law. (Tamargo vs. Court of Appeals, 209 SCRA 518 [1992].)
Negligence is said to be imputed if the tortfeasor is different
from the person who is being held responsible.
The responsibility imposed by Article 2180 is an application
of this principle. It is an exception to the rule that no person can
be held liable for the acts or omissions of another and, therefore,
it cannot be extended to persons not included in said article.

(2) Basis of liability. — The liability in Article 2180 is not
based on the American doctrine of respondeat superior or command responsibility under which the negligent act or omission
of the servant is conclusively the master’s negligence. This
doctrine bases the responsibility of the master ultimately on

324

TORTS

Art. 2179

his own negligence and not that of the servant. “He who does
a thing through another does it himself.’’ The employer cannot
escape liability by interposing the defense of due diligence in
the selection and supervision of the negligent employee. (see
Fuellas vs. Arrieglado, 104 Phil. 529 [1958]; Cuison vs. Norton
& Harrison, 55 Phil. 18 [1930]; Cangco vs. Manila Railroad Co.,
38 Phil. 768 [1918]; Caedo vs. Yu Khe Tai, 26 SCRA 410 [1968].)

The liability under Article 2180 is rather based on pater familias or the failure of the persons mentioned therein to exercise
due care and vigilance over the acts of subordinates to prevent
the damage. Negligence is imputed to them by law unless they
overcome the presumption of its existence. (last par.) In other
words, the negligence of the actor is only presumptively the
negligence of the person responsible for him.

In Cangco (supra.), cited in Tamargo (supra.), the basis for the
doctrine of vicarious liability was explained by the Supreme
Court in the following terms:
“With respect to extra-contractual obligation arising from
negligence, whether of act or omission, it is competent for
the legislature to elect — and our Legislature has so elected
— to limit such liability to cases in which the person upon
whom such an obligation is imposed is morally culpable or,
on the contrary, for reasons of public policy, to extend that
liability, without regard to the lack of moral culpability, so as
to include responsibility for the negligence of those persons
whose acts or omissions are imputable, by a legal fiction,
to others who are in a position to exercise an absolute or
limited control over them.

The legislature which adopted our Civil Code has elected
to limit extra-contractual liability — with certain well-defined
exceptions — to cases in which moral culpability can be
directly imputed to the persons to be charged. This moral
responsibility may consist in having failed to exercise due
care in one’s own acts, or in having failed to exercise due
care in the selection and control of one’s agents or servants,
or in the control of persons who, by reasons of their status,
occupy a position of dependency with respect to the person

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

325

made liable for their conduct.”
Liability of parents.
(1) Basis of liability. — The civil liability imposed upon parents for the torts of their minor children living with them, may
be seen to be based upon the parental authority vested by the
Civil Code upon such parents. The law assumes that when an
unemancipated child living with its parents commits a tortious
act, the parents were negligent in the performance of their legal and natural duty closely to supervise the child who is in
their custody and control. Parental liability is, in other words,
anchored upon parental authority coupled with presumed parental dereliction in the discharge of the duties accompanying
such authority.
The parental dereliction is only presumed and the presumption can be overturned under Article 2180 of the Civil Code by
proof that the parents had exercised all the diligence of a good
father of a family to prevent the damage. (Tamargo vs. Court
of Appeals, supra.)
In the cited case, a minor (Adelberto) of 10 years of age,
shot Jennifer Tamargo with an air rifle causing injuries which
resulted in her death. The civil complaint for damages was filed
by Jennifer’s adopting father and her natural parents against
the minor’s natural parents with whom he was living at the
time of the tragic incident. It was held:

“The shooting of Jennifer by Adelberto with an air rifle
occurred when parental authority was still lodged in respondent Bundoc spouses, the natural parents of the minor
Adelberto. It would thus follow that the natural parents
who had then actual custody of the minor Adelberto, are
the indispensable parties to the suit for damages.

x x x to hold that parental authority had been retroactively
lodged in the Rapisura spouses so as to burden them with
liability for a tortious act that they could not have foreseen
and which they could not have prevented (since they were
at the time in the United States and had no physical custody
over the child Adelberto) would be unfair and unconscion-

326

TORTS

Art. 2179

able. Such a result, moreover, would be inconsistent with
the philosophical and policy basis underlying the doctrine
of vicarious liability. Put a little differently, no presumption
of parental dereliction on the part of the adopting parents,
the Rapisura spouses, could have arisen since Adelberto
was not in fact subject to their control at the time the tort
was committed.’’

(2) Nature of liability. — The liability of the father and mother
for the damages caused by their “minor children who live in
their company,’’ under Article 2180 is not simultaneous but
alternate, the father being primarily responsible. The mother
answers only “in case of his death or incapacity.’’ (par. 2.)
The liability of parents (and guardians) under Article 2180,
however, has been modified by the Family Code (Exec. Order
No. 209) more specifically by the following provisions:

“Art. 219. Those given the authority and responsibility
under the preceding Article shall be principally and solidarily liable for damages caused by the acts or omissions of
the unemancipated minor. The parents, judicial guardians
or the persons exercising substitute parental authority over
said minor shall be subsidiarily liable.

The respective liabilities of those referred to in the preceding paragraph shall not apply if it is proved that they
exercised the proper diligence required under the particular
circumstances.
All other cases not covered by this and the preceding
articles shall be governed by the provisions of the Civil
Code on quasi-delicts. (n)’’

“Art. 221. Parents and other persons exercising parental
authority shall be civilly liable for the injuries and damages
caused by the acts or omissions of their unemancipated children living in their company and under their parental authority subject to the appropriate defenses provided by law.

“Art. 236. Emancipation shall terminate parental authority
over the person and property of the child who shall then
be qualified and responsible for all acts of civil life, save

Art. 2179

QUASI-DELICTS

327

the exceptions established by existing laws in special cases.
Contracting marriage shall require parental consent until
the age of twenty-one.
Nothing in this Code shall be construed to derogate
from the duty or responsibility of parents and guardians
for children and wards below twenty-one years of age
mentioned in the second and third paragraphs of Article
2180 of the Civil Code.’’

Thus, under the Family Code, there is no more alternative
qualification as to the civil liability of parents. The liability of
both father and mother is now primary and not subsidiary.
(Libi vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 214 SCRA 16 [1992].)

(3) Scope of liability. — The liability of parents under Article
2180 covers not only civil obligations arising from quasi-delict
but also those from criminal offenses not covered by Article 101
(infra.) of the Revised Penal Code. (Chap. 10.) It extends also
to “other persons exercising parental authority like judicially
appointed guardians and adopters.’’ (see Arts. 214, 216, 221,
Family Code.)
The responsibility is limited to “minor children who live in
their company.’’ (par. 2.) Emancipation which takes place by the
attainment of the age of majority (18 years) shall permanently
terminate parental authority. (see Arts. 228, 234, Family Code.)
Nevertheless, parental liability subsists even if the minor is already emancipated, provided he is below 21 years of age. Article
236 of the Family Code, as amended by R.A. No. 6809, provides
that “[n]othing in this Code shall be construed to derogate from
the duty or responsibility of parents and guardians for children
and wards below twenty-one years of age mentioned in the
second and third paragraphs of Article 2180 of the Civil Code.’’
The liability exists even when the minor child is already
married. (Elcano vs. Hill, 77 SCRA 98 [1977].) It should still attach even when the minor is not living with the parents if the
separation is unjustifiable because of the failure of the parents
to properly exercise their parental authority and responsibility.
ILLUSTRATIVE CASE:

The Court of Appeals ruled that the civil liability of the parents for

328

TORTS

Art. 2180

the crime committed by their minor son is subsidiary.

Facts: Wendel Libi (WL), a minor between 18 and 19 years
of age living with his parents, petitioners, and Julie Ann Gotong
(JG), 18 years old, legitimate daughter of respondent spouses were
former sweethearts. WL and JG died, each from a single shot, inflicted with the same firearm licensed in the name of WL’s father
and found inside the residence of private respondents.

Due to the absence of an eyewitness account of the circumstances surrounding the death of both minors, their parents, who
are the contending parties posited their respective theories drawn
from their interpretation of circumstantial evidence, available
reports, documents and evidence of physical facts.

Private respondents, bereaved over the death of their daughter,
submitted that Wendell caused her death by shooting her with
the aforesaid firearm and, thereafter, turning the gun on himself
to commit suicide. On the other hand, petitioners, puzzled and
likewise distressed over the death of their son, rejected the imputation and contended that an unknown third party, whom Wendell may have displeased or antagonized by reason of his work
as a narcotics informer of the Constabulary Anti-Narcotics Unit
(CANU), must have caused Wendell’s death and then shot Julie
Ann to eliminate any witness and thereby avoid identification.
As a result of the tragedy, the parents of JG filed an action
against the parents of WL to recover damages arising from the
latter’s vicarious liability under Article 2180.
The Court of Appeals ruled:

“Having been grossly negligent in preventing Wendell
Libi from having access to said gun which was allegedly kept
in a safety deposit box, defendants-appellees are subsidiarily
liable for the natural consequence of the criminal act of said
minor who was living in their company. This vicarious liability of herein defendants-appellees has been reiterated by
the Supreme Court in many cases, prominent of which is the
case of Fuellas vs. Cadano, et al. (L-14409, Oct. 31, 1961, 3 SCRA
361-367), which held that:’The subsidiary liability of parents for
damages caused by their minor children imposed by Article
2180 of the New Civil Code covers obligations arising from
both quasi-delicts and criminal offenses.
The subsidiary liability of parent’s arising from the criminal acts of their minor children who acted with discernment

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

329

is determined under the provisions of Article 2180, N.C.C.
and under Article 101 of the Revised Penal Code, because to
hold that the former only covers obligations which arise from
quasi-delicts and not obligations which arise from criminal
offenses, would result in the absurdity that while for an act
where mere negligence intervenes the father or mother may
stand subsidiarily liable for the damages caused by his or her
son, no liability would attach if the damage is caused with
criminal intent.’ (3 SCRA 361-362)’’

Issue: Whether or not Article 2180 was correctly interpreted by
respondent court to make petitioners liable for vicarious liability.

Held: (1)
Jurisprudential dicta in Fuellas vs. Cadano require
clarification. — “We agree with the conclusion of respondent court
that petitioners should be held liable for the civil liability based
on what appears from all indications was a crime committed by
their minor son. We take this opportunity, however, to digress and
discuss its ratiocination therefor on jurisprudential dicta which we
feel require clarification.
In imposing sanctions for the so-called vicarious liability of
petitioners, respondent court cites Fuellas vs. Cadano, et al., 20
which supposedly holds that ‘(t)he subsidiary liability of parents
for damages caused by their minor children imposed by Article
2180 of the New Civil Code covers obligations arising from both
quasi-delicts and criminal offenses,’ followed by an extended
quotation ostensibly from the same case explaining why under
Article 2180 of the Civil Code and Article 101 of the Revised Penal Code parents should assume subsidiary liability for damages
caused by their minor children. The quoted passages are set out
two paragraphs back, with pertinent underscoring for purposes
of the discussion hereunder.

Now, we do not have any objection to the doctrinal rule
holding, the parents liable, but the categorization of their liability
as being subsidiary, and not primary, in nature requires a hard
second look considering previous decisions of this court on the
matter which warrant comparative analyses. Our concern stems
from our readings that if the liability of the parents for crimes or
quasi-delicts of their minor children is subsidiary, then the parents
can neither invoke nor be absolved of civil liability on the defense
that they acted with the diligence of a good father of a family to
prevent damages. On the other hand, if such liability imputed to
the parents is considered direct and primary, that diligence would
constitute a valid and substantial defense.’’

330

TORTS

Art. 2180

(2) Vicarious liability of parents for quasi-delict primary and not
subsidiary. — “We believe that the civil liability of parents for quasidelicts of their minor children, as contemplated in Article 2180 of
the Civil Code, is primary and not subsidiary. In fact, if we apply
Article 2194 of said Code which provides for solidary liability of joint
tortfeasors, the persons responsible for the act or omission, in this
case the minor and the father and, in case of his death of incapacity,
the mother, are solidarily liable. Accordingly, such parental liability
is primary and not subsidiary; hence, the last paragraph of Article
2180 provides that ‘(t)he responsibility treated of in this article shall
cease when the persons herein mentioned prove that they observed
all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damages.’
’’
(3) Vicarious liability of parents for felonies likewise primary. —
“We are also persuaded that the liability of the parents for felonies committed by their minor children is likewise primary, not
subsidiary. Article 101 of the Revised Penal Code provides:
‘Art. 101. Rules regarding civil liability in certain cases.
xxx

xxx

xxx

First. In cases of subdivisions . . . 2, and 3 of Article 12,
the civil liability for acts committed by . . . a person under
nine years of age, or by one over nine but under fifteen years
of age, who has acted without discernment, shall devolve
upon those having such person under their legal authority or
control, unless it appears that there was no fault or negligence
on their part.’ (Emphases supplied.)

Accordingly, just like the rule in Article 2180 of the Civil Code,
under the foregoing provision the civil liability of the parents
for crimes committed by their minor children is likewise direct
and primary, and also subject to the defense of lack of fault or
negligence on their part, that is, the exercise of the diligence of a
good father of a family in accordance with civil law.’’

(4) Other cases on vicarious liability for felonies. — “The civil
liability of parents for felonies committed by their minor children
contemplated in the aforesaid rule in Article 101 of the Revised
Penal Code in relation to Article 2180 of the Civil Code has, aside
from the aforecited case of Fuellas, been the subject of a number
of cases adjudicated by this Court, viz.: Exconde vs. Capuno, et al.,
Araneta vs. Arreglado, Salen, et al. vs. Balce, Paleyan, etc., et al. vs.
Bangkili, et al., and Elcano, et al. vs. Hill, et al. Parenthetically, the

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

331

aforesaid cases were basically on the issue of the civil liability
of parents for crimes committed by their minor children over 9
but under 15 years of age, who acted with discernment, and also
of minors 15 years of aye or over, since these situations are not
covered by Article 101, Revised Penal Code.

In both instances, this Court held that the issue of parental
civil liability should be resolved in accordance with the provisions
of Article 2180 of the Civil Code for the reasons well-expressed in
Salen and adopted in the cases hereinbefore enumerated that to
hold that the civil liability under Article 2180 would apply only
to quasi-delicts and not to criminal offenses would result in the
absurdity that in an act involving mere negligence the parents
would be liable but not where the damage is caused with criminal intent. In said cases, however, there are unfortunate variances
resulting in a regrettable inconsistency in the Court’s determination of whether the liability of the parents, in cases involving
either crimes or quasi-delicts of their minor children, is primary
or subsidiary.’’
(5) Premise of primary liability. — “x x x Under the foregoing
considerations, therefore, we hereby rule that the parents are and
should be held primarily liable for the civil liability arising from
criminal offenses committed by their minor children under their
legal authority or control, or who live in their company, unless
it is proven that the former acted with the diligence of a good
father of a family to prevent such damages. That primary liability
is premised on the provisions of Article 101 of the Revised Penal
Code with respect to damages ex delicto caused by their children
9 years of age or under, or over 9 but under 15 years of age who
acted without discernment; and, with regard to their children over
9 but under 15 years of age who acted with discernment, or 15
years or over but under 21 years of age, such primary liability
shall be imposed pursuant to Article 2180 of the Civil Code.’’
(6) Liability now without alternative qualification. — “Under said
Article 2180, the enforcement of such liability shall be effected
against the father and, in case of his death or incapacity, the
mother. This was amplified by the Child and Youth Welfare Code
which provides that the same shall devolve upon the father and,
in case of his death or incapacity, upon the mother or, in case of
her death or incapacity, upon the guardian, but the liability may
also be voluntarily assumed by a relative or family friend of the
youthful offender.
However, under the Family Code, this civil liability is now,

332

TORTS

Art. 2180

without such alternative qualification, the responsibility of the
parents and those who exercise parental authority over the minor
offender. For civil liability arising from quasi-delicts committed by
minors, the same rules shall apply in accordance with Articles 2180
and 2182 of the Civil Code, as so modified.’’ (Libi vs. Intermediate
Appellate Court, 214 SCRA 16 [1992].)

Liability of guardians.
The principles governing the responsibility of parents for
the acts or omissions of their minor children apply to guardians with respect to their wards, but it should be noted that
the extent of the power of direction and of the moral influence
of parents is more than that of guardians.
(1) Wards of guardians. — Note that the responsibility of
guardians (par. 3.) extend to “incapacitated persons’’ even if
they are already of age. Section 2 of Rule 92 uses the word
“incompetent.’’ It “includes persons suffering the penalty of
civil interdiction or who are hospitalized lepers, prodigals,
deaf and dumb who are unable to read and write, those who
are of unsound mind, even though they have lucid intervals,
and persons not being of unsound mind, but by reason of age,
disease, weak mind, and other similar causes, cannot, without
outside aid, take care of themselves and manage their property,
becoming thereby an easy prey for deceit and exploitation.’’
(2) Guardians stand in loco parentis. — “Since children and
wards do not yet have the capacity to govern themselves, the
law imposes upon the parents and guardians the duty of exercising special vigilance over the acts of their children and wards
in order that damages to third persons due to the ignorance,
lack of foresight or discernment of such children and wards
may be avoided. If the parents and guardians fail to comply
with this duty, they should suffer the consequences of their
abandonment or negligence by repairing the damage caused.”
(Exconde vs. Capuno, 101 Phil. 843 [1957], citing 12 Manresa,
649-650; Fuellas vs. Cadaño, 3 SCRA 361 [1961].)

(3) In case of guardian de facto. — There are times when an
orphaned child is taken care of by some relative or neighbor
who is not legally appointed as guardian. If the child causes
damages, such person in custody or de facto guardian would

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

333

generally not be responsible, because of the absence of one
of the bases for the responsibility — namely, the duty to take
care of the child. But if the injury caused is the result of bad
education or training by the guardian de facto, the latter should
be held liable. (A.M. Tolentino, supra., op. cit., 614.)

The procedure for the appointment guardians is governed
by Rules 92 and 93 of the Revised Rules of Court.
Liability of owners and managers of establishment
or enterprise.

(1) Meaning of terms. — The terms “owners and managers’’
(par. 4.) and “employer’’ (par. 5.) do not include the manager of
a corporation. The term “manager’’ (“director’’ in the Spanish
version) is used in the sense of “employer.’’ Hence, no tortious
or quasi-delictual liability can be fastened on a manager of a
corporation owning a truck, the reckless operation of which allegedly resulted in the vehicular accident from which the damage arose, in connection with said accident because he himself
may be regarded as an employee or dependiente of his employer.
(Phil. Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. vs. Phil.-American Forwarders, Inc.,
63 SCRA 231 [1975].)

(2) Existence of employer-employee relationship. — In an action
against an employer, whether under paragraph 4 or 5, of Article
2180, the existence of employer-employee relationship must be
established by the plaintiff “in a satisfactory manner.’’ It cannot
be presumed, for example, that the one who drove the motor
vehicle involved in an accident is an employee of the owner
thereof. (Martin vs. Court of Appeals, 205 SCRA 591 [1992].)
There is no employer-employee relationship between the lessor and the lessee of vehicle; hence, the former is not liable for
the negligence of the latter unless it can be found that the true
nature of the alleged lease contract effected by the alleged lessor (a corporation) was nothing more than a disguise to relieve
itself of the burdens and responsibilities of an employer. (FGU
Insurance Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 92 SCAD 731, 287
SCRA 719 [1998]; MYC-Agro-Industrial Corporation vs. Vda. De
Caldo, 132 SCRA 10 [1984].)
(3) Negligence of independent contractor. — One who hires

334

TORTS

Art. 2180

an “independent contractor’’ but controls the latter’s work is
responsible also for his negligence. (Cuison vs. Norton and
Harrison Co., 55 Phil. 18 [1930].)
Liability of other employers.
(1) Engagement in business or industry. — Note that Article
2180 has separate provisions for “owners and managers of an
establishment or enterprise’’ (par. 4.) and “employers.’’ (par. 5.)
Both are employers. It is, however, not necessary that the “employer’’ under the 5th paragraph be engaged in any business or
industry. Both are made liable for damages if they are caused
by their employees acting in their service or on the occasion of
their functions, or acting within the scope their assigned tasks
at the time of the commission of the tortious act or negligence.
(2) Distinction between paragraphs 4 and 5. — The distinction
between the two provisions has been explained thus:
“Both provisions apply to employers: the fourth paragraph, to owners and managers of an establishment or enterprise; and the fifth paragraph, to employers in general,
whether or not engaged in any business or industry.

The fourth paragraph covers negligent acts of employees committed either in the service of the branches or on
the occasion of their functions, while the fifth paragraph
encompasses negligent acts of employees acting within the
scope of their assigned task. The latter is an expansion of
the former in both employer coverage and acts included.
Negligent acts of employees, whether or not the employer
is engaged in a business or industry, are covered so long as
they were acting within the scope of their assigned task, even
though committed neither in the service of the branches nor
on the occasion of their functions. For, admittedly, employees oftentimes wear different hats. They perform functions
which are beyond their office, title or designation but which,
nevertheless, are still within the call of duty.

This court has applied the fifth paragraph to cases where
the employer was engaged in a business or industry such
as truck operators and banks. The Court of Appeals cannot, therefore, be faulted in applying the said paragraph of

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

335

Article 2180 of the Civil Code to this case.

Under the fifth paragraph of Article 2180, whether or
not engaged in any business or industry, an employer is
liable for the torts committed by employees within the
scope of their assigned tasks. But it is necessary to establish
the employer-employee relationship; once this is done, the
plaintiff must show, to hold the employer liable, that the
employee was acting within the scope of their assigned task
when the tort complained of was committed. It is only then
that the employer may find it necessary to interpose the
defense of due diligence in the selection and supervision of
the employee.’’ (Castilex Industrial Corporation vs. Vasquez,
Jr., 117 SCAD 834, 321 SCRA 393 [1999].)

(3) Nature of liability. — The liability of the employer is
primary and solidary with the employee although the former
can recover from the latter whatever it pays to the plaintiff.
(Art. 2181.) This direct responsibility is more likely to facilitate
the remedy for civil wrongs. (Barredo vs. Garcia, 73 Phil. 607
[1942]; De Leon Brokerage vs. Court of Appeals, 4 SCRA 517
[1962].)
(a) The fact that an employee in criminal case was acquitted because his criminal negligence was not proven cannot
be invoked as a defense in an action for damages against
the employer based on Articles 2176 and 2180 because the
liability of the employer is primary and direct, based upon
his own negligence (culpa aquiliana) and not that of his
employees (Standard Vacuum Oil Co. vs. Tan, 107 Phil. 109
[1960].) in the absence of allegation in the civil case based
on quasi-delict that a crime had been committed in which
case the liability of the employer would only be subsidiary.
(Malipol vs. Tan, 54 SCRA 202 [1974].)
(b) Neither is the insolvency of the guilty employee, or
a prior recourse against him a condition to fasten liability
on the employer. (Bantolo vs. Bobis, 18 SCRA 690 [1966];
Galian vs. Alday, 154 SCRA 388 [1987]; Kapalaran Bus Line
vs. Coronado, 176 SCRA 792 [1989].)

Note that paragraph 5 speaks of employees and household
helpers; hence, the employer is not liable for the damages

336

TORTS

Art. 2180

caused by strangers unless he is also negligent. Neither is he
liable for the negligence of an independent contractor hired by
him unless he exercises control over the latter’s work. (Cuison
vs. Norton & Harrison Co., 55 Phil. 18 [1930].)

(4) Defense of employer. — If an injury or damage is caused
by an employee, it is presumed that the employer (pars. 4 and
5.) was negligent either in the selection of the employee or in
his supervision over him, or both. The employer can overcome
the presumption by a clear showing that in the selection and
supervision he observed all the diligence of a good father of a
family to prevent damage. (last par.) It is not necessary to state
that the employee was negligent in the selection and supervision
of its employees, inasmuch as his negligence is presumed by
operation of law. Allegations of negligence against the employee
and that of employer-employee relations in the complaint are
enough to make out a case of quasi-delict under Article 2180.
(Delsan Transport Lines, Inc. vs. C & A Construction, Inc., 412
SCRA 524 [2003].)
Supervision, in proper cases, includes the promulgation
by the employer of suitable rules and the issuance of suitable
instructions for the information and guidance of his employees
designed for the protection of persons with whom the employer
has relation through his employees. (Bahia vs. Litonjua, 30 Phil.
624 [1915].) But the mere allegation of the existence of hiring
procedures and supervisory policies, without anything more,
is decidedly not sufficient to rebut the legal presumption of
negligence. (Metro Manila Transit Corp. vs. Court of Appeals,
42 SCAD 538, 223 SCRA 521 [1993].)

(a) While the exercise of due care by the employer in
choosing a competent employee may prove the exercise of
due diligence on the part of the employer, to prevent the
damage, such circumstance is not conclusive. Thus, where
defendant company as employer was duly informed that an
employee caused an opening to be made in a dam to relieve
the pressure of the water against the bridge and embankment, and as a result, crops were lost, but defendant took
no other measures to avoid further damage, it cannot be
said that it exercised due diligence to prevent the damage.

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

337

(Maxion vs. Manila Railroad Co., 44 Phil. 597 [1923].)

(b) With respect to the selection of drivers, the owner of
a vehicle should not be satisfied with the mere possession
of a professional driver’s license and/or NBI and police
clearance but he should carefully examine the applicant
for employment as to his qualifications, his experience, and
record of service. (Campo vs. Camarote, 100 Phil. 459 [1956];
Metro Manila Transit Corp. vs. Court of Appeals, supra.)

(c) Based on jurisprudential law, the employer must not
merely present testimonial evidence to prove that he observed
the diligence of a good faith of a family in the selection and/
or supervision of his employee but he must also support such
evidence with concrete or documentary evidence. The reason
for this is to obviate the biased nature of the employer’s testimony or that of his witnesses. (Syki vs. Begasa, 414 SCRA
237 [2003].)
(d) No law requires the passing of psychological and
physical tests prior to employment but such circumstances
would certainly be a reliable indicator of the exercise of
due diligence. (Sanitary Steam Laundry, Inc. vs. Court of
Appeals, 101 SCAD 561, 300 SCRA 20 [1998].)

Note that to be exempt be absolved from liability, the employer must establish that he exercised due care not only in the
selection but also in the supervision of the employee. But while
the exercise of the required diligence is a complete defense in
culpa aquiliana, it is not in culpa contractual.

(5) Liability tortfeasor. — Although Article 2180 provides
for liability for the tortious acts of his employees, this does
not exempt the employees from personal liability especially, if
there are no persons having direct supervision over them, or
if thee is proof of the existence of negligence on their part. So
the injured party can bring an action directly against the author
of the negligent act or omission although he may sue as joint
defendants such author and the person responsible for him.
(Belazar vs. Brazas, 2 SCRA 526 [1961].)
Example: Suppose X, a passenger of a bus (Y), suffered
injuries in a collision with another bus (Z) because of the

338

TORTS

Art. 2180

negligence of both drivers. Who should be liable?

The owners of both vehicles and the two drivers are
liable solidarily. The liability of the owner of bus (Y) is
based on the contract of carriage while the owner of bus
(Z) and the two (2) drivers can be held liable on the basis
of quasi-delict. (see Vinluan vs. Court of Appeals, 16 SCRA
743 [1966].)
Where the injury is due to the concurrent negligence of the
drivers of the colliding vehicles, the drivers and owners thereof
shall be primarily, directly and solidarily liable for damages. It
is immaterial that one action is based on quasi-delict and the
other on culpa contractual, as the solidarity of the obligation is
justified by the very nature thereof. (Metro Manila Transit Corp.
vs. Court of Appeals, 223 SCRA 521 [1993].) The drivers and
their respective employers have no right of action against each
other but the owner of each vehicle can recover his damage
against either or both drivers who are solidarily liable therefor,
with a right of reimbursement in case he may have been made
to pay damages to the injured party. (see Art. 2181.)
Liability of the State for the acts
of its special agents.
(1) Two aspects of liability. — The State may act as a government entity (public aspect) exercising governmental functions,
where it is liable only for the acts of its special agents; or in
a corporate capacity (private or business aspect), as when it
engages in some private enterprises, where it may be held liable just as any other employer for the acts of its employees.
The State assumes a limited liability for the damage caused by
the tortious acts or conduct of its special agents. (Fontanilla vs.
Maliamen, 179 SCRA 685 [1989].)

(2) Liability for torts. — By special agent is meant one specifically commissioned to carry out the acts complained of outside
of such agent’s regular duties. (Republic vs. Palacio, 23 SCRA
899 [1968].)
Under Article 2180 (par. 6.), the State has voluntarily assumed
liability for acts done through special agent. The State’s agent, if a
public official, must not only be especially commissioned to do a

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

339

particular task but that such task must be foreign to said official’s
usual governmental functions. If the State’s agent is not a public
official, and is commissioned to perform non-governmental functions, then the State assumes the role of an ordinary employer and
will be liable as such for its agent’s tort. Where the government
commissions a private individual for a special governmental
task, it is acting through a special agent within the meaning of
the provision.’’28 (Fontanilla vs. Maliamen, supra.) Where the act
complained of is one performed in the discharge of the official
duties of a public officer, the State is not liable.

(3) Liability for unauthorized or illegal acts. — Inasmuch as the
State authorizes only legal acts by its officers, unauthorized acts
of government officials or officers are not acts of the State, and an
action against the officials or officers by one whose rights have
been invaded or violated by such acts, for the protection of his
rights, is not a suit against the State within the rule of immunity
of the State from suit. In the same tenor, it has been said that an
action at law or suit in equity against a State officer or the director of a State department on the ground that, while claiming to
act for the State, he violates or invades the personal and property
rights of the plaintiff, under an unconstitutional act or under an
assumption of authority which he does not have, is not a suit
against the State within the constitutional provision that the State
may not be sued without its consent. (Director of the Bureau of
Telecommunications vs. Aligean, 33 SCRA 368 [1970].)
When a public officer goes beyond the scope of his duty
particularly when acting tortiously, he is not entitled to protection on account of his office but he is liable for his acts like
any private individual. (Palma vs. Graciano, 99 Phil. 72 [1956];
Madua vs. Lopez, 102 SCRA 700 [1981].)
Liability of teachers or heads of establishments
of arts and trades.
(1) Basis of liability. — The teachers and heads mentioned
(par. 7.) stand, to a certain extent, in loco parentis to their pupils
and students.

Where the parent places a child under the effective authority
of the teacher, the latter together with the school head (and the

340

TORTS

Art. 2180

school itself for the fault of the teacher or head), not the parent,
should be the one answerable for the torts committed while
under their custody, for the very reason that the parent is not
supposed to interfere with the authority and supervision of the
teacher while the child is under instructions. (Reyes, J.B.L., Jr.,
dissenting opinion; Exconde vs. Capuno, 101 Phil. 843 [1957].)

(2) Meaning of the phrase “as long as they remain in their
custody.’’ — The phrase was held to contemplate a situation
where the pupil lives and boards with the teacher such that
the control and influence over the conduct and actions of the
pupil would pass from the father to the teacher, and so would
the responsibility for the torts of the pupil. (Mercado vs. Court
of Appeals, 108 Phil. 414 [1960].)
This interpretation was abandoned in Palisoc vs. Brillantes
(41 SCRA 557 [1971].) where the Supreme Court ruled that the
phrase means “the protective and supervisory custody that the
school and its head and teacher exercise over the pupils and
students for as long they are in the school including recess
time. There is nothing in the law which requires that for such
liability to attach, the pupil or student who commits the tortious
act must live and board in the school.’’

The student is in the custody of the school authorities as
long as he is under the control and influence of the school and
within its premises, whether the semester has not yet begun or
has already ended. (Amadora vs. Court of Appeals, 160 SCRA
315 [1988].) Under Article 218 of the Family Code, custody
extends to activities even outside the premises as long as they
are “authorized activities.’’
(3) Liability extends to pupils or students beyond the age of majority. — The responsibility under Article 2180 is not limited to
pupils, students, or apprentices who are minors. While there is
such a limitation in the case of parents and/or guardians, no
such limitation is provided as to teachers and school heads.

A student over 21 years of age, by enrolling and attending a school, places himself under the custodial supervision
and disciplinary authority of the school authorities, which is
the basis of the latter’s correlative responsibility for his torts,
committed while under such authority. Of course, the teacher’s

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

341

control is not as plenary as when the student is a minor; but
the circumstance can only affect the degree of the responsibility
but cannot negate the existence thereof. It is only a factor to be
appreciated in determining whether or not the defendant has
exercised due diligence in endeavoring to prevent the injury,
as prescribed in the last paragraph of Article 2180. (Palisoc vs.
Brilliantes, 41 SCRA 548 [1971].)
(4) Rule with respect to minors. — The Family Code provides:

“Art. 218. The school, its administrators and teachers,
or the individual, entity or institution engaged in child care
shall have special parental authority and responsibility over
the minor child while under their supervision, instruction
or custody.
Authority and responsibility shall apply to all authorized activities whether inside or outside the premises of the
school, entity or institution. (349a)’’

“Art. 219. Those given the authority and responsibility
under the preceding Article shall be principally and solidarily liable for damages caused by the acts or omissions of
the unemancipated minor. The parents, judicial guardians
or the persons exercising substitute parental authority over
said minor shall be subsidiarily liable.

The respective liabilities of those referred to in the preceding paragraph shall not apply if it is proved that they
exercised the proper diligence required under the particular
circumstances.
All other cases not covered by this and the preceding
articles shall be governed by the provisions of the Civil
Code on quasi-delicts. (n)’’

These two provisions control with respect to pupils and
students or apprentices who are minors. The basis of liability
is the special parental authority and responsibility assumed over
the minor for whose acts or omissions those given such authority and responsibility are principally and solidarily liable for
damages, with the parents, judicial guardians, or the persons
exercising substitute parental authority29 being subsidiarily liable.

(5) Liability extends to both academic and non-academic schools.
— There is really no substantial distinction between the academic and the non-academic schools insofar as torts committed
by their students are concerned. The same vigilance is expected
from the teacher over the students under his control and supervision, whatever the nature of the school where he is teaching.
(Amadora vs. Court of Appeals, 160 SCRA 315 [1988].)

However, where the school is academic rather than vocational
or technical in nature, responsibility for the tort committed by
the pupil or student will attach to the teacher in charge of such
pupil or student, following the first part of paragraph 7 of Article
2180. This is the general rule. In the case of establishments for
arts and trades, it is the head thereof, and only he, who shall be
held liable as an exception to the general rule. In other words,
teachers in general shall be liable for the acts of their students
except where the school is technical in nature; in which case it
is the head thereof who shall be answerable. (Ibid.)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASE:
A fourth year college student was fatally shot inside the school
auditorium by a classmate, when the classes had formally ended.

Facts: While they were in the auditorium of their school (Colegio de San Jose-Recoletos), Pablito Daffon (PD), a classmate,
fired a gun that mortally hit Alfredo Amadora (AA), a prospective graduate, who was only 17-years old, PD was convicted of
homicide thru reckless imprudence.

Petitioners, AA’s parents, filed a civil action for damages under
Article 2180 against the school, its Rector, the high school principal,
the dean of boys, and the physics teacher together with PD and
two other students, through their respective parents.
The respondent Court of Appeals found that Article 2180 was
not applicable as the Colegio de San Jose-Recoletos was not a
school of arts and trades but an academic institution of learning.
It also held that the students were not in the custody of the school
at the time of the incident as the semester had already ended,
that there was no clear identification of the fatal gun, and that in
any event the defendants had exercised the necessary diligence
in preventing the injury.
Issue: (1) Does Article 2180 (par. 7.) apply to an academic

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

343

institution of learning?

(2) May students be considered still in the custody of a school
where the semester had already ended?

Held: (1) Three cases decided in connection with the provision. —
These cases are Exconde vs. Capuno, Mercado vs. Court of Appeals,
and Palisoc vs. Brillantes. (supra.)

“In the Exconde Case, Dante Capuno, a student of the Balintawak Elementary School and a Boy Scout, attended a Rizal Day
parade on instructions of the city school supervisor. After the
parade, the boy boarded a jeep, took over its wheel and drove it
so recklessly that it turned turtle, resulting in the death of two of
its passengers. Dante was found guilty of double homicide with
reckless imprudence. In the separate civil action filed against
them, his father was held solidarily liable with him in damages
under Article 1903 (now Article 2180) of the Civil Code for the
tort committed by the 15-year old boy.
This decision, which was penned by Justice Bautista Angelo on
June 29, 1957, exculpated the school in an obiter dictum (as it was
not a party to the case) on the ground that it was not a school of
arts and trades. Justice J.B.L. Reyes, with whom Justices Sabino
Padilla and Alex Reyes concurred, dissented, arguing that it was
the school authorities who should be held liable. Liability under
this role, he said, was imposed on (1) teachers in general; and (2)
heads of schools of arts and trades in particular. The modifying
clause ‘of establishments of arts and trades’ should apply only to
‘heads’ and not ‘teachers.’

Exconde was reiterated in the Mercado Case, and with an
elaboration. A student cut a classmate with a razor blade during
recess time at the Lourdes Catholic School in Quezon City, and
the parents of the victim sued the culprit’s parents for damages.
Through Justice Labrador, the Court declared in another obiter
(as the school itself had also not been sued) that the school was
not liable because it was not an establishment of arts and trades.
Morever, the custody requirement had not been proved as this
‘contemplates a situation where the student lives and boards with
the teacher, such that the control, direction and influences on the
pupil supersede those of the parents.’ Justice J.B.L. Reyes did not
take part but the other members of the court concurred in this
decision promulgated on May 30, 1960.
In Palisoc vs. Brillantes, decided on October 4, 1971, a 16-year
old student was killed by a classmate with fist blows in the labo-

344

TORTS

Art. 2180

ratory of the Manila Technical Institute. Although the wrongdoer
— who was already of age — was not boarding in the school,
the head thereof and the teacher in charge were held solidarily
liable with him. The Court declared through Justice Teehankee:

‘The phrase used in the cited article — ‘so long as (the
students) remain in their custody’ — means the protective and
supervisory custody that the school and its heads and teachers
exercise over the pupils and students for as long as they are at
attendance in the school, including recess time. There is nothing
in the law that requires that for such liability to attach, the pupil
or student who commits the tortious act must live and board in
the school, as erroneously held by the lower court, and the dicta
in Mercado (as well as in Exconde) on which it relied, must now
be deemed to have been set aside by the present decision. x x x’’

(2) Case at bar. — “Unlike in Exconde and Mercado, the Colegio
de San Jose-Recoletos has been directly impleaded and is sought
to be held liable under Article 2180; and unlike in Palisoc, it is
not a school of arts and trades but an academic institution of
learning. The parties herein have also directly raised the question
of whether or not Article 2180 covers even establishments which
are technically not schools of arts and trades, and, if so, when the
offending student is supposed to be ‘in its custody.’ ’’

(3) Provision applies to academic and non-academic schools. —
“The provision in question should apply to all schools, academic
as well as non-academic. Where the school is academic rather
than technical or vocational in nature, responsibility for the tort
committed by the student will attach to the teacher in charge of
such student, following the first part of the provision. This is the
general rule. In the case of establishments of arts and trades, it
is the head thereof, and only he, who shall be held liable as an
exception to the general rule. In other words, teachers in general
shall be liable for the acts of their students except where the
school is technical in nature, in which case it is the head thereof
who shall be answerable.
Following the canon of reddendo singula singulis, ‘teachers’
should apply to the words ‘pupils and students’ and ‘heads of
establishments of arts and trades’ to the word ‘apprentices.’ ”

(4) Reason for application to academic institutions. — “The Court
thus conforms to the dissenting opinion expressed by Justice J.B.L.
Reyes in Exconde where he said in part:
‘I can see no sound reason for limiting Art. 1903 of the old

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

345

Civil Code to teachers of arts and trades and not to academic
ones. What substantial difference is there between them insofar
as concerns the proper supervision and vigilance over their
pupils? It cannot be seriously contended that an academic
teacher is exempt from the duty of watching that his pupils
do not commit a tort to the detriment of third persons, so long
as they are in a position to exercise authority and supervision
over the pupil. In my opinion, in the phrase ‘teachers or heads
of establishments of arts and trades’ used in Art. 1903 of the
old Civil Code, the words ‘arts and trades’ do not qualify
‘teachers’ but only ‘heads of establishments.’ The phrase is
only an updated version of the equivalent terms ‘preceptores
y artesanos’ used in the Italian and French Civil Codes.
If, as conceded by all commentators, the basis of the presumption of negligence of Art. 1903 is some culpa in vigilando
that the parents, teachers, etc. are supposed to have incurred in
the exercise of their authority, it would seem clear that where
the parent places the child under the effective authority of
the teacher, the latter, and not the parent, should be the one
answerable for the torts committed while under his custody,
for the very reason that the parent is not supposed to interfere
with the discipline of the school nor with the authority and
supervision of the teacher while the child is under instruction.
And if there is no authority, there can be no responsibility.’ ’’

(5) Same vigilance expected, whatever nature of school. — “There
is really no substantial distinction between the academic and the
non-academic schools insofar as torts committed by their students
are concerned. The same vigilance is expected from the teacher
over the students under his control and supervision, whatever the
nature of the school where he is teaching. The suggestion in the
Exconde and Mercado Cases is that the provision would make the
teacher or even the head of the school of arts and trades liable for
an injury caused by any student in its custody but if that same
tort were committed in an academic school, no liability would
attach to the teacher or the school head. All other circumstances
being the same, the teacher or the head of the academic school
would be absolved whereas the teacher and the head of the non“Sec. 3. The State may not be sued without its consent.’’ (Art. XVI -General Provisions,
Constitution.) Section 3 expressly states the fundamental principle of non-suability of the
State. For an extensive discussion of this topic, see H.S. De Leon, Philippine Constitutional
Law, Vol. 2, 2004 Ed., pp. 1111-1146.)
28

346

TORTS

Art. 2180

academic school would be held liable, and simply because the
latter is a school of arts and trades.
The Court cannot see why different degrees of vigilance
should be exercised by the school authorities on the basis only
of the nature of their respective schools. There does not seem to
be any plausible reason for relaxing that vigilance simply because
the school is academic in nature and for increasing such vigilance
where the school is non-academic. Notably, the injury subject of
liability is caused by the student and not by the school itself nor
is it a result of the operations of the school or its equipment. The
injury contemplated may be caused by any student regardless of
the school where he is registered. The teacher certainly should not
be able to excuse himself by simply showing that he is teaching
in an academic school where, on the other hand, the head would
be held liable if the school were non-academic.’’
(6) Reason for difference in liability between teacher in any school,
head of academic school, and head of school of arts and trades. — “These
questions, though, may be asked: If the teacher of the academic
school is to be held answerable for the torts committed by his
students, why is it the head of the school only who is held liable
where the injury is caused in a school of arts and trades? And in
the case of the academic or non-technical school, why not apply
the rule also to the head thereof instead of imposing the liability
only on the teacher?

The reason for the disparity can be traced to the fact that
historically the head of the school of arts and trades exercised
a closer tutelage over his pupils than the head of the academic
school. The old schools of arts and trades were engaged in the
training of artisans apprenticed to their master who personally and
directly instructed them on the technique and secrets of their craft.
The head of the school of arts and trades was such a master and
so was personally involved in the task of teaching his students,
who usually even boarded with him and so came under his constant control, supervision and influence. By contrast, the head of
the academic school was not as involved with his students and
exercised only administrative duties over the teachers who were
the persons directly dealing with the students. The head of the
academic school had then (as now) only a vicarious relationship
with the students. Consequently, while he could not be directly
faulted for the acts of the students, the head of the school of arts
and trades, because of his closer ties with them, could be so blamed.

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

347

It is conceded that the distinction no longer obtains at present
in view of the expansion of the schools of arts and trades, the
consequent increase in their enrollment, and the corresponding
diminution of the direct and personal contract of their heads
with the students. Article 2180, however, remains unchanged. In
its present state, the provision must be interpreted by the Court
according to its clear and original mandate until the legislature,
taking into account the changes in the situation subject to be
regulated, sees fit to enact the necessary amendment.’’
(7) Duration of responsibility. — “The other matter to be resolved is the duration of the responsibility of the teacher or the
head of the school of arts and trades over the students. Is such
responsibility co-extensive with the period when the student is
actually undergoing studies during the school term, as contended
by the respondents and impliedly admitted by the petitioners
themselves?

From a reading of the provision under examination, it is clear
that while the custody requirement, to repeat Palisoc vs. Brillantes,
does not mean that the student must be boarding with the school
authorities, it does signify that the student should be within the
control and under the influence of the school authorities at the
time of the occurrence of the injury. This does not necessarily
mean that such, custody be co-terminous with the semester, beginning with the start of classes and ending upon the close thereof,
and excluding the time before or after such period, such as the
period of registration, and in the case of graduating students, the
period before the commencement exercises. In the view of the
Court, the student is in the custody of the school authorities as
long as he is under the control and influence of the school and
within its premises, whether the semester has not yet begun or
has already ended.

It is too tenuous to argue that the student comes under the
discipline of the school only upon the start of classes notwithstanding that before that day he has already registered and thus
placed himself under its rules. Neither should such discipline be
deemed ended upon the last day of classes notwithstanding that
there may still be certain requisites to be satisfied for completion of
the course, such as submission of reports, term papers, clearances
and the like. During such periods, the student is still subject to the
disciplinary authority of the school and cannot consider himself
released altogether from observance of its rules.’’

348

TORTS

Art. 2180

(8) Students within school premises within custody of school
authorities. — “As long as it can be shown that the student is in
the school premises in pursuance of a legitimate student objective, in the exercise of a legitimate student right, and even in the
enjoyment of a legitimate student privilege, the responsibility of
the school authorities over the student continues. Indeed, even if
the student should be doing nothing more than relaxing in the
campus in the company of his classmates and friends and enjoying the ambience and atmosphere of the school, he is still within
the custody and subject to the discipline of the school authorities
under the provisions of Article 2180.’’

(9) Responsibility of teacher-in-charge. — “During all these occasions, it is obviously the teacher-in-charge who must answer for
his students’ torts, in practically the same way that the parents are
responsible for the child when he is in their custody. The teacherin-charge is the one designated by the dean, principal, or other
administrative superior to exercise supervision over the pupils in
the specific classes or sections to which they are assigned. It is not
necessary that at the time of the injury, the teacher be physically
present and in a position to prevent it. Custody does not connote
immediate and actual physical control but refers more to the
influence exerted on the child and the discipline instilled in him
as a result of such influence. Thus, for the injuries caused by the
student, the teacher and not the parent shall be held responsible
if the tort was committed within the premises of the school at
any time when its authority could be validly exercised over him.

In this connection, it should be observed that the teacher will
be held liable not only when he is acting in loco parentis for the
law does not require that the offending student be of minority
age. Unlike the parent, who will be liable only if his child is still
a minor, the teacher is held answerable by the law for the act of
the student under him regardless of the student’s age. Thus, in
Art. 216. In default of parents or a judicially appointed guardian, the following
persons shall exercise substitute parental authority over the child in the order indicated:
(1) The surviving grandparent, as provided in Art. 214;
(2) The oldest brother or sister, over twenty-one years of age, unless unfit or disqualified; and
(3) The child’s actual custodian, over twenty-one years of age, unless unfit or disqualified.
Whenever the appointment of a judicial guardian over the property of the child
becomes necessary, the same order of preference shall be observed. (Family Code)

the Palisoc Case, liability attached to the teacher and the head of
the technical school although the wrongdoer was already of age.
In this sense, Article 2180 treats the parent more favorably than
the teacher.

In any event, it should be noted that the liability imposed
by this article is supposed to fall directly on the teacher or the
head of the school of arts and trades and not on the school itself.
If at all, the school, whatever its nature, may be held to answer
for the acts of its teachers or even of the head thereof under the
general principle of respondeat superior, but then it may exculpate
itself from liability by proof that it had exercised the diligence of
a bonus paterfamilias.’’
(10) Defense available. — “Such defense is, of course, also available to the teacher or the head of the school of arts and trades
directly held to answer for the tort committed by the student. As
long as the defendant can show that he had taken the necessary
precautions to prevent the injury complained of, he can exonerate
himself from the liability imposed by Article 2180. x x x’’

(11) Liability of school itself. — “The Court is not unmindful
of the apprehensions expressed by Justice Makalintal in his dissenting opinion in Palisoc that the school may be unduly exposed
to liability under this article in view of the increasing activism
among the students that is likely to cause violence and resulting
injuries in the school premises. That is a valid fear, to be sure.
Nevertheless, it should be repeated that, under the present ruling,
it is not the school that will be held directly liable. Moreover, the
defense of due diligence is available to it in case it is sought to
be held answerable as principal for the acts or omissions of its
head or the teacher in its employ.

The school can show that it exercised proper measures in
selecting the head or its teachers and the appropriate supervision
over them in the custody and instruction of the pupils pursuant to
its rules and regulations for the maintenance of discipline among
them. In almost all cases now, in fact, these measures are effected
through the assistance of an adequate security force to help the
teacher physically enforce those rules upon the students. This
should bolster the claim of the school that it has taken adequate
steps to prevent any injury that may be committed by its students.’’
(12) Measure of responsibility imposed on teacher. — “A fortiori,
the teacher himself may invoke this defense as it would otherwise be unfair to hold him directly answerable for the damage

350

TORTS

Art. 2180

caused by his students as long as they are in the school premises
and presumably under his influence. In this respect, the Court
is disposed not to expect from the teacher the same measure of
responsibility imposed on the parent for their influence over the
child is not equal in degree.
Obviously, the parent can expect more obedience from the
child because the latter’s dependence on him is greater than on
the teacher. It need not be stressed that such dependence includes
the child’s support and sustenance whereas submission to the
teacher’s influence, besides being co-terminous with the period of
custody, is usually enforced only because of the students’ desire
to pass the course. The parent can instill more lasting discipline
on the child than the teacher and so should be held to a greater
accountability than the teacher for the tort committed by the child.’’
(13) Less accountability required of school authorities. — “And if
it is also considered that under the article in question, the teacher
or the head of the school of arts and trades is responsible for the
damage caused by the student or apprentice even if he is already
of age — and therefore less tractable than the minor — then there
should all the more be justification to require from the school authorities less accountability as long as they can prove reasonable
diligence in preventing the injury.
After all, if the parent himself is no longer liable for the
student’s acts because he has reached majority age and so is no
longer under the former’s control, there is then all the more reason for leniency in assessing the teacher’s responsibility for the
acts of the student.’’
(14) Conclusions. — “Applying the foregoing considerations,
the Court has arrived at the following conclusions:

1. At the time Alfredo Amadora was fatally shot, he
was still in the custody of the authorities of Colegio de San
Jose-Recoletos notwithstanding that the fourth year classes
had formally ended. It was immaterial if he was in the school
auditorium to finish his physics experiment or merely to submit
his physics report for what is important is that he was there
for a legitimate purpose. As previously observed, even the
mere savoring of the company of his friends in the premises
of the school is a legitimate purpose that would have also
brought him in the custody of the school authorities.
2. The rector, the high school principal and the dean
of boys cannot be held liable because none of them was the

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

351

teacher-in-charge as previously defined. Each of them was
exercising only a general authority over the student body and
not the direct control and influence exerted by the teacher
placed in charge of particular classes or sections and thus
immediately involved in its discipline. The evidence of the
parties does not disclose who the teacher-in-charge of the
offending student was. The mere fact that Alfredo Amadora
had gone to school that day in connection with his physics
report did not necessarily make the physics teacher, respondent Celestino Dicon, the teacher-in-charge of Alfredo’s killer.

3. At any rate, assuming that he was the teacher-in-charge,
there is no showing that Dicon was negligent in enforcing
discipline upon Daffon [PD] or that he had waived observance
of the rules and regulations of the school or condoned their
non-observance. His absence when the tragedy happened cannot be considered against him because he was not supposed
or required to report to school on that day. And while it is
true that the offending student was still in the custody of
the teacher-in-charge even if the latter was physically absent
when the tort was committed, it has not been established that
it was caused by his laxness in enforcing discipline upon the
student. On the contrary, the private respondents have proved
that they had exercised due diligence, through the enforcement
of the school regulations, in maintaining that discipline.
4. In the absence of a teacher-in-charge, it is probably the
dean of boys who should be held liable, especially in view of
the unrefuted evidence that he had earlier confiscated an unlicensed gun from one of the students and returned the same
later to him without taking disciplinary action or reporting the
matter to higher authorities. While this was clearly negligence
on his part, for which he deserves sanctions from the school,
it does not necessarily link him to the shooting of Amador
as it has not been shown that the confiscated and returned
pistol was the gun that killed the petitioners’ son.

5. Finally, as previously observed, the Colegio de San
Jose-Recoletos cannot be held directly liable under the article
because only the teacher or the head of the school of arts
and trades is made responsible for the damage caused by the
student or apprentice. Neither can it be held to answer for
the tort committed by any of the other private respondents
for none of them has been found to have been charged with

352

TORTS

Art. 2180

the custody of the offending student or has been remiss in
the discharge of his duties in connection with such custody.

In sum, the Court finds under the facts as disclosed by the
record and in the light of the principles herein announced that
none of the respondents is liable for the injury inflicted by Pablito
Daffon on Alfredo Amadora that resulted in the latter’s death at
the auditorium of the Colegio de San Jose-Recoletos on April 13,
1972.’’ (Amadora vs. Court of Appeals, 160 SCRA 315 [1988].)
Concurring and dissenting opinion:
“In concur, except with respect to the restricted meaning given
to the term ‘teacher’ in Article 2180 of the Civil Code as ‘teacherin-charge.’ This would limit liability to occasions where there are
classes under the immediate charge of a teacher, which does not
seem to be the intendment of the law.
As I understand it, the philosophy of the law is that whoever
stands in loco parentis will have the same duties and obligations
as parents whenever in such a standing. Those persons are mandatorily held liable for the tortuous acts of pupils and students so
long as the latter remain in their custody, meaning their protective
and supervisory custody. x x x
Thus, Article 34930 of the Civil Code enumerates the persons
who stand in loco parentis and thereby exercise substitute parental
authority: x x x

The rationale of liability of school heads and teachers for the
tortuous acts of their pupils was explained in Palisoc vs. Brillantes
(41 SCRA 548), thus:
‘The protective custody of the school heads and teacher
is mandatorily substituted for that of the parents, and hence,
it becomes their obligation as well as that of the school itself to
provide proper supervision of the students’ activities during the whole time that they are at attendance in the school,
including recess time, as well as to take the necessary precautions to protect the students in their custody from dangers
and hazards that would reasonably be anticipated, including
injuries that some students themselves may inflict willfully or
through negligence on their fellow students.’ (Italics supplied)

Of course, as provided for in the same Article 2180, the responsibility treated of shall cease when the persons mentioned
prove that they observed all the diligence of a good father of a

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

353

family to prevent damage.

And while a school is, admittedly, not directly liable since
Article 2180 speaks only of teachers and schools, heads, yet, by
virtue of the same provision, the school, as their employer,31 may
be held liable for the failure of its teachers or school heads to perform their mandatory legal duties as substitute parents (Sangco,
Philippine Law on Torts & Damages, 1978 ed., p. 201). Again, the
school may exculpate itself from liability by proving that it had
exercised the diligence of a good father of the family.

Parenthetically, from the enumeration in Article 349 of the
Civil Code, supra, it is apparent that the Code Commission had
already segregated the classification of ‘teachers and professors’
vis-à-vis their pupils, from ‘directors of trade establishments, with
regard to their apprentices.’ ’’ (Melencio-Herrera, J.)
Concurring opinion:
The seventh paragraph of Art. 2180 is a relic of the past and
contemplates a situation long gone and out of date. In a Palisoc
v. Brillantes (41 SCRA 548) situation, it is bound to result in mischief and injustice.

First, we no longer have masters and apprentices toiling in
schools of arts and trades. Students in “technological’’ colleges
and universities are no different from students in liberal arts or
professional schools. Apprentices now work in regular shops and
factories and their relationship to the employer is covered by laws
governing the employment relationship and not by laws governing
the teacher-student relationship.
Second, except for kindergarten, elementary, and perhaps
early high school students, teachers are often no longer objects of
veneration who are given the respect due to substitute parents.
Many students in their late teens or early adult years view some
teachers as part of a bourgeois or reactionary group whose advice
on behaviour, deportment, and other non-academic matters is not
only resented but actively rejected. It seems most unfair to hold
teachers liable on a presumption juris tantum of negligence for
acts of students even under circumstances where strictly speaking
there could be no in loco parentis relationship. Why do teachers
have to prove the contrary of negligence to be freed from solidary
liability for the acts of bomb-throwing or pistol packing students
who would just as soon hurt them as they would other members

Art. 2180

of the so-called establishment.

The ordinary rules on quasi-delict should apply to teachers
and schools of whatever nature insofar as grown up students are
concerned. The provision of Art. 2180 of the Civil Code involved
in this case has outlived its purpose.’’ (Gutierrez, Jr., J.)

Defense against vicarious liability.
(1) Burden of proof. — The responsibility imposed by Article 2180 is not based on respondeat superior. (supra.) It arises by
virtue of a legal presumption of negligence on the part of the
persons made responsible for the tortious conduct of another.
Such presumption is only juris tantum, not juris et de jure, and
may be rebutted by showing that they “observed all the diligence of a good father of a family to prevent the damage’’ (last
par.), which in the case of employers, means due diligence in
the selection and supervision of employees.

The burden of proof devolves upon the persons mentioned
for the reason that in most cases, it is difficult for any injured
party to prove their negligence or lack of due diligence. Once
the negligence on the part of the employee is shown, the burden
shifts to the employer who must overcome the presumption
by presenting convincing proof that he exercised the required
diligence.

(2) Meaning of “diligence of a good father of a family.’’ — The
phrase may be equated with ordinary care or that diligence which
an average or a reasonably prudent person exercises over his
own affairs. (De Leon & De Leon, Jr., Comments and Cases on
Obligations and Contracts, 2003 Ed., p. 30.) This standard of
care is also referred to as that “a man of ordinary prudence,’’
or “a man using ordinary care and skill.’’

Obviously, there is no meticulously calibrated measure of the
diligence of a good father of a family to prevent the damage.
There should be a consideration of the attendant circumstances
in each case to determine whether or not the exercise of due
diligence could have prevented the damage. (Cuadra vs. Monfort, 35 SCRA 160 [1970].)
(3) Criminal negligence. — The vicarious liability of the employer for the criminal negligence of his employee is governed

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

355

by Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code. (Chap. 10.) The conviction of the employee for criminal negligence conclusively binds
the employer who is automatically made subsidiarily liable,
to answer for the damages awarded. (Fernando vs. Franco, 37
SCRA 311 [1971].) The defense that the employer exercised due
diligence in the selection and supervision of the employee is
not available under said article.
Since the employer’s civil liability is subsidiary, and not
direct, his responsibility will arise only if the employee cannot or is unable to pay the indemnity awarded. Furthermore,
his liability cannot be more than that of the employee. The
employer stands in the position of a guarantor. The injured
party, however, can sue both at the same time, although he
has a choice of remedy either under the Revised Penal Code
or under Article 2180.

(4) Contractual negligence. — Article 2180 is exclusively
concerned with negligence in the absence of a contract. (Baer
Senior & Co.’s Successors vs. Cia Maritima, 6 Phil. 215 [1906];
Manila Railroad Co. vs. Cia Transatlantica, 38 Phil. 875 [1918];
Del Prado vs. Manila Electric Co., 52 Phil. 900 [1929]; San Pedro
Bus Line vs. Navarro, 94 Phil. 846 [1954].) The defense of exercising the required diligence in the selection and supervision
of employees is not a complete defense in culpa contractual unlike in culpa aquiliana. So, where the civil action is based upon
negligence in the performance of a contract, the defense of due
diligence is not available to the employer, as in the case of a
common carrier being held liable for damages caused to passengers or cargo by the negligence of its employees. To escape
responsibility, the employer must prove not only that there was
no fault or negligence on his part, but also on the part of his
employees.
Art. 2181. Whoever pays for the damage caused
by his dependents or employees may recover from
the latter what he has paid or delivered in satisfaction of the claim. (1904)
Right to reimbursement.

356

TORTS

Art. 2180

Although Article 2180 provides for the liability of the persons
made responsible for the acts or omissions of others, this does
not exempt the author from personal liability. So, the injured
party can bring an action directly against such author, or the
persons responsible for him, or both. In any case, the persons
enumerated in Article 2180 are given the right to seek reimbursement from the former for “what he has paid or delivered in
satisfaction of the claim’’ of the plaintiff. The rule is just because
the one at fault should answer for the damage caused by him.

“The phrase ‘dependents or employees’ in Article 2181
should be construed to include all persons for whom another
is liable under Article 2180. The reason is that the legislator, by
imposing liability upon the persons with supervisory authority
over them, did not exempt the author of the negligent act or
omission from personal liability; the injured is merely secured
against possible insolvency of said author. If he is solvent, there
is no reason why he should not be liable to another who has
paid for him.’’ (A.M. Tolentino, op. cit., pp. 621-622.)
Art. 2182. If the minor or insane person causing
damage has no parents or guardians, the minor or
insane person shall be answerable with his own
property in an action against him where a guardian
ad litem shall be appointed. (n)
Where tortfeasor a minor or insane person
without parent or guardian.
Article 2182 contemplates a situation where the minor or
insane person has no parents or guardian, and no person can
be held to answer for the damage caused by him. The action
may be brought against him where a guardian ad litem shall be
appointed by the court.32 His own property, if any, shall answer
for the damage.
Art. 2183. The possessor of an animal or whoever
may make use of the same is responsible for the
damage which it may cause, although it may escape
or be lost. This responsibility shall cease only in

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

357

case the damage should come from force majeure
or from the fault of the person who has suffered
damage. (1905)
Liability of possessor of an animal.

(1) Liability independent of fault or negligence. — The obligation imposed by Article 2182 is not based on the negligence or
the presumed lack of vigilance of the possessor or user of the
animal causing the damage. It is based on natural equity and
on the principle of social interest that he who possesses animals
for his utility, pleasure, or service, must answer for the damage
which such animal may cause. (Vestil vs. Intermediate Appellate
Court, 179 SCRA 47 [1989].)
Article 2182 is an instance of the adoption of the doctrine of
strict liability (see Chap. 2.) where tort liability cannot be avoided
even in the absence of fault or negligence and regardless of the
good faith of the defendant, clearly implying that liability is
imposed as a matter of public policy.
(2) Liability limited to possessor or user. — Liability is imposed
only on the possessor or user of the animal. Since he is the one
who has custody and control, he is, therefore, in a position to
prevent the animal from causing damage. Note that this liability
obtains even if he loses such custody and control because the
animal escaped or was lost.

The owner of an animal was held not liable for injuries
caused by it to its caretaker, who was paid by the owner for
his work. Being injured was one of the risks of the caretaker’s
occupation. It was his business to prevent the animal from
causing injury to himself or to anyone. Hence, the heirs of the
caretaker who died as a consequence of his injuries cannot sue
the owner. (Afialda vs. Hisole, 85 Phil. 67 [1949].)

(3) Kind of animal covered. — Article 2182 makes no distinction as to what kind of animal is used or possessed. Hence, it
may be construed as applicable generally to all animals, whether
domestic, domesticated, or wild. It would seem that birds are
covered since they can also cause damage.
(3) Defenses. — The only exception against liability is where
the damage was caused by force majeure (see Art. 2178.) or due

358

TORTS

Art. 2180

to the fault of the person who suffered the damage.

(a) Force majeure. — The possessor or user of an animal
is liable for acts of the animal, whether they are instinctive
or due to its defects. But when the instinctive act is due to
force majeure such as lightning, thunder, etc. or to the act of
a third person (noisy vehicles, unforeseen obstacles), there
is no liability on the part of the possessor. (A.M. Tolentino,
op. cit., p. 623.)

The owner is liable only for such damage that may
be produced as a consequence of the special danger from
the animal, resulting from its nature as a living thing with
impulses of its own. Hence, the owner will not be liable
if the animal is bodily moved by others and should fall,
causing injury to another; nor when it merely follows the
will of the person guiding it. But the owner will be liable,
if it runs wild because it is freightened by some noise or
object, because, in this case, the damage would result from
the special danger to the animal. (Ibid., pp. 623-624.)
In order that an event may be considered force majeure, it
is necessary that the same be extraordinary and unforeseen.
Thus, the passing of a vehicle creating a noise which frightens a horse, which, in turn, runs loose and kills or injures
a person, does not constitute force majeure. The event is a
common one, which the possessor of the animal could have
foreseen, and against which he could have taken proper
precaution. (Ibid., p. 624.)
(b) Fault of person suffering damage. — The possessor of
an animal is not liable if the damage or injury is caused by
the fault or negligence of the injured person himself.

The victim deprives himself of a right to complain, if
he is guilty of any act or omission which unnecessarily exposes himself to the action of the animal, whether or not he
knows its vices or habits. It is no excuse for him to say that
he was merely observing, admiring or even caressing the
animal, because the latter cannot know his purpose. Thus,
one who provokes a dog or enters another’s house at night
and is bitten by a dog, or approaches a horse from the rear
and is kicked by it, cannot recover damages. (Ibid., p. 624.)

Art. 2180

QUASI-DELICTS

359

(3) Acts of a third person. — The possessor or user of the
animal is still liable even if the damage or injury was caused
through the act or negligence of a third person unless it can
be shown that the incident was extraordinary and unforeseen
as to be equated with force majeure. In such case, the burden
of proving fault rests upon the defendant to make the third
person liable for the resulting damage. If the third person is a
child, ward, or employee of the possessor or user, Article 2180
would be applicable.
ILLUSTRATIVE CASE:
The dog that caused death of a child was owned by the deceased
father of petitioner in whose house she was staying at the time of the
incident in question.

Facts: Theness was dead at the age of three. She was bitten
by a dog while she was playing with a child of the petitioners
(spouses AV and PV) in the house of Vicente Miranda (VM), the
late father of Purita Vestil (PV). She was treated in the hospital for
“multiple lacerated wounds on the forehead’’ and administered
an anti-rabies vaccine. She developed hydrophobia, a symptom of
rabies, as a result of the dog bites and died of asphyxia bronchopneumonia, a complication of rabies.
Seven months later, the Uys, parents of Thenes, sued petitioners for damages.

PV insists that she is not the owner of the house or of the
dog left by her father as his estate has not yet been partitioned
and there are other heirs to the property. Pursuing the logic of
the Uys, she claims, even her sister living in Canada would be
held responsible for the acts of the dog simply because she is
one of VM’s heirs.
Issue: May petitioners who are not the owners of the house
where they are staying and the dog that bit and eventually killed
a child be held liable for said death?

Held: Yes. (1) Possession, not ownership of the dog, the issue.
— “What must be determined is the possession of the dog that
admittedly was staying in the house in question, regardless of the
30

Now, Article 216, Family Code; see Note 28.

360

TORTS

Art. 2180

ownership of the dog or of the house. x x x

Thus, in Afialda vs. Hisole (85 Phil. 67), a person hired as caretaker of a carabao gored him to death and his heirs thereupon
sued the owner of the animal for damages. The complaint was
dismissed on the ground that it was the caretaker’s duty to prevent
the carabao from causing injury to any one, including himself.’’

(2) House leased by PV. — “Purita Vestil’s testimony that she
was not in possession of Miranda’s house is hardly credible. x
x x There is contrary evidence that the occupants of the house
were boarders (or more of boarders than relatives) who paid the
petitioners for providing them with meals and accommodations. It
also appears that Purita Vestil had hired a maid, Dolores Jumaoas, who did the cooking and cleaning in the said house for its
occupants.
Her mother, Pacita, who was a nursemaid of Purita herself,
categorically declared that the petitioners were maintaining boarders in the house where Theness was bitten by a dog. Another
witness, Marcial Lao, testified that he was indeed a boarder and
that the Vestils were maintaining the house for business purposes.
And although Purita denied paying the water bills for the house,
the private respondents submitted documentary evidence of her
application for water connection with the Cebu Water District,
which strongly suggested that she was administering the house
in question.’’
(3) Petitioners, the possessors at time of incident. — “While it
is true that she is not really the owner of the house, which was
still part of Vicente Miranda’s estate, there is no doubt that she
and her husband were its possessors at the time of the incident
in question. She was the only heir residing in Cebu City and the
most logical person to take care of the property, which was only
six kilometers from her own house. Moreover, there is evidence
showing that she and her family regularly went to the house,
once or twice weekly, according to at least one witness, and used
it virtually as a second house.
Interestingly, her own daughter was playing in the house with
Theness when the little girl was bitten by the dog. The dog itself
remained in the house even after the death of Vicente Miranda
31

361

in 1973 and until 1975, when the incident in question occurred.
It is also noteworthy that the petitioners offered to assist the Uys
with their hospitalization expenses although Purita said she knew
them only casually.’’

(4) Mere possession, even without actual control. — “The petitioner’s contention that they could not be expected to exercise
remote control of the dog is not acceptable. In fact, Article 2183
of the Civil Code holds the possessor liable even if the animal
should “escape or be lost” and so be removed from his control.’’
(5) Vicious as well as tame animals covered. — And it does not
matter either that as the petitioners also contend, the dog was
tame and was merely provoked by the child into biting her. The
law does not speak only of vicious animals but covers even tame
ones as long as they cause injury. As for the alleged provocation,
the petitioners forget that Theness was only three years old at the
time she was attacked and can hardly be faulted for whatever she
might have done to the animal.’’ (Vestil vs. Intermediate Appellate
Court, 179 SCRA 47 [1989].)

Art. 2184. In motor vehicle mishaps, the owner
is solidarily liable with his driver, if the former, who
was in the vehicle, could have, by the use of due
diligence, prevented the misfortune. It is disputably
presumed that a driver was negligent, if he had been
found guilty of reckless driving or violating traffic
regulations at least twice within the next preceding
two months.
If the owner was not in the motor vehicle, the
provisions of Article 2180 are applicable. (n)
Liability of owner in motor vehicle
mishaps.

(1) Owners covered. — Article 2184 refers to owners of vehicles
who are not included in the terms of Article 2180 as “owners
of an establishment or enterprise.’’ (De Leon Brokerage Co.,
Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 4 SCRA 517 [1962].) It is intended to
cover only the owners of motor vehicles for private use. It is
generally not applicable to motor vehicles for public use and
convenience because the operator thereof, usually a corporation,
cannot, in the very nature of things, be in the motor vehicle

362

TORTS

Art. 2180

at the time of the mishap. However, if the manager of the bus
company was in the bus at the time of the mishap, Article 2184
may be applied by analogy. (Footnote 3, p. 1071, in Corpus vs.
Paje, 28 SCRA 1062 [1969].)

Article 2184 applies if the owner was in the vehicle at the
time of the mishap; otherwise, the provisions of Article 2180
would be applicable (par. 2.) where the owner even if he was
not in the vehicle would be liable unless he exercised due diligence to prevent the damage.
(2) Opportunity to prevent mishap. — If the causative factor
was the driver’s negligence, the owner of that car, who was
present, is likewise held liable if he could have prevented the
mishap by the exercise of due diligence. Negligence, under Article 2184, is, to a certain degree, necessarily subjective. (Caedo
vs. Yu Khe Tai, 26 SCRA 410 [1968].) The owner should not be
held liable for the negligence of a competent driver, if by the
sudden act of negligence, the owner could not have a reasonable
opportunity to prevent the act or its continuance. (Chapman vs.
Underwood, 27 Phil. 374 [1914]; see Johnson vs. David, 5 Phil.
663 [1906].)33
(3) When driver’s negligence presumed. — There is no presumption that a driver was negligent unless he had been found guilty
of reckless driving or violating traffic regulations at least twice
within two months next preceeding the mishap (Art. 2184.),
or was violating any traffic violation at the time of the motor
vehicle mishap. (Art. 2185.)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASE:

Car owner, who was present, is being held solidarily liable with his
driver whose negligence was directly the cause of the collision.

Facts: Yu’s car bumped a carretela in front and at the same
time hit another car coming from the opposite direct. Yu was in
the car at time of the mishap. There was no question that the
collision with the other car was directly traceable to his driver’s
negligence and that he must be held liable for the damages suffered by the plaintiffs.

Issue: Is Yu solidarily liable with his driver under Article 2184.

Held: No. (1) Bases of liability. — “Under [Article 2184], if the
causative factor was the driver’s negligence, the owner of the
vehicle who was present is likewise held liable if he could have

Arts. 2181-2182

QUASI-DELICTS

363

prevented the mishap by the exercise of due diligence. The rule
is not new, although formulated as law for the first time in the
new Civil Code.
It was expressed Chapman vs. Underwood, 27 Phil. 374 (1914),
where this Court held:

‘x x x The same rule applies where the owner is present,
unless the negligent acts of the driver are continued for such
a length of time as to give the owner a reasonable opportunity
to observe them and to direct his driver to desist therefrom.
An owner who sits in his automobile, or other vehicle, and
permits his driver to continue in a violation of the law by the
performance of negligent acts, after he has had a reasonable
opportunity to observe them and to direct that the driver
cease therefrom, becomes himself responsible for such acts.
The owner of an automobile who permits his chauffeur to
drive up the Escolta, for example, at a speed of 60 miles an
hour, without any effort to stop him, although he has had a
reasonable opportunity to do so, becomes himself responsible,
both criminally and civilly, for the results produced by the
acts of the chauffeur.
On the other hand, if the driver, by a sudden act of negligence, and without the owner having a reasonable opportunity to prevent the act or its continuance, injures a person
or violates the criminal law, the owner of the automobile,
although present therein at the time the act was committed,
is not responsible, either civilly or criminally, therefor. The act
complained of must be continued in the presence of the owner
for such a length of time that the owner, by his acquiescence,
makes his driver’s act his own.’

The basis of the master’s liability in civil law is not respondeat
superior but rather the relationship of pater familias. The theory
is that ultimately the negligence of the servant, if known to the
master and susceptible of timely correction by him, reflects his
own negligence if he fails to correct it in order to prevent injury
or damage.’’

(2) Negligence of driver not imputable to defendant-appellant. — “In
the present case, the defendants’ evidence is that Rafael Bernardo
had been Yu Khe Thai’s driver since 1937, and before that had been
employed by Yutivo Sons Hardware Co. in the same capacity for
over ten years. During that time he had no record of violation of
traffic laws and regulations. No negligence for having employed

364

TORTS

Art. 2183

him at all may be imputed to his master.

Negligence on the part of the latter, if any, must be sought in
the immediate setting and circumstances of the accident, that is, in
his failure to detain the driver from pursuing a course which not
only gave him clear notice of the danger but also sufficient time to
act upon it. We do not see that such negligence may be imputed.

The car, as has been stated, was not running at an unreasonable speed. The road was wide and open, and devoid of traffic
that early morning. There was no reason for the car owner to be
in any special state of alert. He had reason to rely on the skill
and experience of his driver.

He became aware of the presence of the carretela when his
car was only twelve meters behind it, but then his failure to see
it earlier did not constitute negligence, for he was not himself
at the wheel. And even when he did see it at the distance, he
could not have anticipated his driver’s sudden decision to pass
the carretela on its left side in spite of the fact that another car
was approaching from the opposite direction. The time element
was such that there was no reasonable opportunity for Yu Khe
Thai to assess the risks involved and warn the driver accordingly.

The thought that entered his mind, he said, was that if he
sounded a sudden warning it might only make the other man
nervous and make the situation worse. It was a thought that,
wise or not, connotes no absence of that due diligence required
by law to prevent the misfortune.’’
(3) Test of imputed negligence under Article 2184. — “The test
of imputed negligence under Article 2184 of the Civil Code is, to
a great degree, necessarily subjective. Car owners are not held to
a uniform and inflexible standard of diligence as are professional
drivers. In many cases they refrain from driving their own cars
and instead hire other persons to drive for them precisely because
they are not trained or endowed with sufficient discernment to
know the rules of traffic or to appreciate the relative dangers
posed by the different situations that are continually encountered
on the road.

365

how to handle a motor vehicle is not necessarily so on the part,
say, of an old and infirm person who is not similarly equipped.’’

(4) Test of negligence of car owner. —“The law does not require
that a person must possess a certain measure of skill or proficiency
either in the mechanics of driving or in the observance of traffic
rules before he may own a motor vehicle. The test of his negligence,
within the meaning of Article 2184, is his omission to do that which
the evidence of his own senses tells him he should do in order to
avoid the accident. And as far as perception is concerned, absent
a minimum level imposed by law, a maneuver that appears to be
fraught with danger to one passenger may appear to be entirely
safe and commonplace to another.

Were the law to require a uniform standard of perceptiveness,
employment of professional drivers by car owners who, by their
very inadequacies, have real need of drivers’ services, would be
effectively prescribed.’’ (Caedo vs. Yu Khe Thai, 26 SCRA 410 [1968].)

Art. 2185. Unless there is proof to the contrary,
it is presumed that a person driving a motor vehicle
has been negligent if at the time of the mishap, he
was violating any traffic regulation. (n)
Presumption that driver of motor vehicle
has been negligent.
(1) Three presumptions. — Under Article 2184, the presumption of negligence arises on the part of the driver instantly if
either of the two situations mentioned has taken place at least
twice within the next preceeding two months of the accident.

In Article 2185, if the driver was violating any traffic regulation at the time of the mishap, he is also legally presumed
to have negligently caused the damage unless he proves the
contrary.
(2) Degree of care required in the operation of motor vehicles. —
Automobiles and other motor vehicles have the same right to
use the public highways as other vehicles or pedestrians, but
their use must be accompanied by that degree of prudence in
management and consideration of the rights of others as may
be consistent with safety. The degree of care required in the
operation of an automobile on the public highways is correla-

366

TORTS

Art. 2183

tive with the conditions confronting the operator, such as the
presence or absence of other travelers and their apparent ability
to care for themselves, the unobstructedness of the view, etc.

It must always be borne in mind that an automobile is more
dangerous than vehicles drawn by animals for the reason that the
former is capable of greater destruction and is absolutely under
the power of the driver, whereas a horse or other animal can and
does to some extent aid in averting an injury or accident. So,
although it is perhaps somewhat disagreeable to reduce speed
when meeting or passing other travelers, a failure to check the
speed to such an extent that would give the driver sufficient
control to avoid or avert an accident not due to the carelessness
of his fellow-travelers, would constitute reckless negligence.
It would clearly be a failure to exercise that quantum of care
required of him under the circumstances. (U.S. vs. Juanillo, 23
Phil. 212 [1912]; see U.S. vs. Crame, 30 Phil. 2 [1915].)
Art. 2186. Every owner of a motor vehicle shall file

competent public official. (n)
Filing of bond by every owner

Articles 2184, 2185, and 2186 are special provisions which
the Code Commission says “have been deemed necessary to
cope with the alarming increase of motor vehicle mishaps.’’
(Report of the Code Commission, p. 163.)
Motor vehicle owners or operators are now required to have
third party liability insurance or surety bonds to assure victims
of motor vehicle accidents and/or their dependents, especially
when they are poor, immediate financial assistance or indemnity
regardless of the financial capability of motor vehicle owners or
operators responsible for the accident sustained. The insurer’s
liability is primary and accrues immediately upon the occurrence

of the injury or event upon which the liability depends, and
does not depend on the recovery of judgment by the injured
party against the insured. (Schafer vs. Judge, RTC, 167 SCRA
386 [1986]; First Integrated Bonding & Insurance Co., Inc. vs.
Hernando, 199 SCRA 796 [1991].) The injured or the heirs of
a deceased victim of a vehicular accident may sue directly the
insurer of the vehicle.34 (GSIS vs. Court of Appeals, 107 SCAD
676, 308 SCRA 559 [1997]; see Secs. 374-377, Insurance Code of
the Philippines, [Pres. Decree No. 1460, as amended].)
Unless registered with the Land Transportation Office (LTO),
a sale of a motor vehicle is valid and binding only between the
parties and does not affect third parties, especially the victims
of accidents involving said motor vehicle. In an action based
on quasi-delict, the registered owner of a motor vehicle subject
of an unregistered dead of sale is the one solidarily liable for
damages or injuries caused by the negligence of the driver employed by the new owner. (Equitable Leasing Corp. vs. Suyom,
174 SCAD 228, 388 SCRA 445 [2002].)

The purpose of such liability is to insure that the burdens
of such accidental deaths or injuries resulting from defective
products intended for public consumption be placed upon
those who market them, and can be treated as cost of production rather than by the injured persons who are powerless to
protect themselves.

(2) Liability even without fault or negligence. — Even if there is
no fault or negligence, public policy demands that responsibility
be fixed whenever it will most effectively reduce the hazards
to life and health inherent in defective products that reach the
market. It is evident that the manufacturer can anticipate such
hazards and guard against the recurrence of others, as the public
cannot. Those who suffer injury from defective products are
unprepared to meet its consequences.

(a) Public interest in discouraging marketing of defective
products. — It is to the public interest to discourage the
marketing of products having defects that are a menace to
the public. If such products nevertheless find their way into
the market it is to the public interest to place the responsibility for whatever injury they may cause to the manufacturer, who, even if he is not negligent in the manufacture
of the product, is responsible for its reaching the market.
However, intermittently such injury may occur and however
haphazardly they may strike, the risk of their occurrence
is a constant risk and a general one. Against such a risk,
there should be general and constant protection, and the
manufacturer is best suited to afford such protection.
It is to the public interest to prevent injury to the public
from any defective goods by the imposition of civil liability
generally.

(b) Consumers without means or skill to investigate soundness
of products. — Manufacturing processes, frequently valuable
secrets, are ordinarily either inaccessible to or beyond the
ken of the general public. The consumer has no means or
skill enough to investigate for himself the soundness of a
product. Consumers accept the products they buy on faith,

Art. 2184

QUASI-DELICTS

369

relying on the reputation of the manufacturer or the trademark.

(c) Liability not affected by presence of intermediaries. — The
manufacturer’s obligation to the consumer must keep pace
with the changing relationship between them. It cannot be
escaped because the marketing of a product has become
so complicated as to require one or more intermediaries.
The manufacturer’s liability should, of course, be defined
in terms of the safety of the product in normal and proper
use, and should not extend to injuries that cannot be traced
to the product as it reached the market. (Opinion of Justice
Traynor [later Chief Justice] in Escola vs. Coca-cola Bottling
Co.,35 24 Cal. 453, 150 P2d 436.)

(3) Liability although without contractual relation. — The doctrine of strict liability in tort operates notwithstanding that the
consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any
contractual relation with the manufacturer or processor. Such
defenses as lack of privity and waiver of implied warranties
cannot be invoked.
This liability of the manufacturer is not assumed by agreement but imposed by law as a matter of public policy. To require
the existence of a contract as an element of the consumer’s cause
of action is “to permit the manufacturer to define the scope of
its own responsibility for defective products.’’ (see Ibid.)
Requisites for liability.
The liability imposed by Article 2187 depends upon the
existence of the requisites enumerated below.

(1) Defendant is a manufacturer or processor. — “Unlike Sec.
402A of the Second Restatement of Torts according to which the
doctrine of strict liability may be applied in an action against a
seller who is engaged in the business of products and comment
In Chapman and Johnson, the owners of the vehicles involved in the accidents were
private individuals who were not engaged in any business enterprise. The cochero of a calesa
in Johnson and the driver in Chapman were held as not falling within the list of persons
enumerated in Article 2180 for whose acts the defendants would be liable.
33

TORTS

Art. 2184

thereon which specifies that the doctrine applies to manufacturers, wholesale or retail dealers or distributors, and operators of
restaurants, this article on its face explicitly limits the persons
who may be held liable thereunder only to the ‘manufacturers
and processors’ who ‘used noxious or harmful substances’, and
as to products thus manufactured only to ‘foodstuffs, drinks,
toilet articles and similar goods’; and imposes such liability
‘although no contractual relation exists between them and the
consumer.’
In specifying the manufacturers and processors as the persons liable, and expressly discarding the privity requirement
between them and the consumer, the law makes clear its intent
to limit liability for injuriously defective food products, toilet
articles and similar products to the manufacturers and processors thereof. From this it necessarily follows that sellers of the
enumerated goods which turn out to be injuriously defective
cannot be held liable for such defect for the obvious reason
that they have nothing to do either with the defect or with the
manufacture of such product. And even where the manufacturer
or processor is himself the seller of the injuriously defective toilet
article, he will be held liable therefor not as the seller but as the
manufacturer thereof. This appears to be the clear implication
of discarding the privity requirement in this article.’’36

(2) Products manufactured or processed are “foodstuffs, drinks,
toilet articles, and similar goods.’’ — “Following settled rules of
construction on the matter, the clause ‘and similar goods’ in this
article likewise delimits the other products therein referred to
those belonging to the general class of food products and toilet
articles, such as canned, bottled or packaged goods intended
for human consumption, all kinds of beverages, cosmetics and
lotions, and drugs taken to maintain or restore health. Unlike in
the United States, it does not include all products which could
be dangerous to life, health and property, such as motor vehicles,
household appliances, machine tools, if defective. This limitation
as to products reflects both our essentially agricultural economy
and the nature and extent of our industrial state. Finally, the
term ‘consumer’ includes the ‘user’ thereof such as in the case
of toilet articles and cosmetics.’’37

Art. 2184

QUASI-DELICTS

371

(3) Defendant used noxious or harmful substances in the manufacture or processing. — Such use makes the foodstuffs, etc. dangerous
to human life and public health and safety and, therefore, defective. The burden of proof that the product was in a defective or
dangerous condition at the time it was bought is upon the plaintiff.
Such proof raises the presumption that it was also in the same
condition when it left the hands of the manufacturer.
(4) Death or injury was caused by the product consumed or used
containing such noxious or harmful substances. — The plaintiff is
required to establish a casual connection between the death
or injuries and the defective condition of defendant’s product.
Direct and circumstantial evidence, and if necessary, expert
testimony, may be availed of by the plaintiff to show both the
defective condition and its proximate causation of the physical
harm. The fact that the defendant’s product was not used in
the manner it was entered, to be safe, is a defense that may
refute plaintiff’s claim of defectiveness and/or causation.
If plaintiff’s misuse or improper use was solely responsible
for the injuries, it is a complete defense, but if it merely concurred with the defective condition of the product, there is only
contributory negligence which will only mitigate the damages
to be awarded. (Art. 2179.)

“Contributory negligence is not a defense when such
negligence consists merely in a failure to discover the defect
in the product or to guard against the possibility of its existence. On the other hand, the form of contributory negligence
which consists in voluntarily and unreasonably proceeding to
encounter a known danger, and commonly passes under the
name of assumption of risk, is a [complete] defense. If the user or
consumer discovers the defect and is aware of the danger, and
nevertheless proceeds unreasonably to make use of the product
and is injured by it, he is barred from recovery.’’38
Note that the damages compensable under Article 2187 are
expressly limited to those resulting from “death or injuries,’’
thereby precluding liability for purely pecuniary damages.
Nevertheless, they may be recovered if they have been incurred
(e.g., medical expenses) as a result of “death or injuries.’’

372

TORTS

Art. 2185

(5) Victim is the consumer, user, or purchaser. — Article 2187
uses the term “consumer.’’ However, it should be deemed to
include the “user’’ and “purchaser.’’ One may be the “consumer’’
or “user’’ of a product without having purchased the same.
According to Section 402A of the Second Restatement of
Torts, the doctrine of strict liability is applicable in the case of
harm caused to the “ultimate’’ user or consumer. In Comment
I, following the said section, it is said that the “consumer’’ need
not have purchased the product at all, but may be a member
of the family of the final purchaser or his employee, or a guest
at his table, or a mere donee from the purchaser, and the term
“user’’ is defined as to include those who are passively enjoying the benefit of the product.39
Art. 2188. There is prima facie presumption of
negligence on the part of the defendant if the death
or injury results from his possession of dangerous weapons or substances, such as firearms and
poison, except when the possession or use thereof
is indispensable in his occupation or business. (n)
Presumption arising from possession of dangerous
weapons or substances.
There is a prima facie presumption that the defendant was
negligent if (1) a person dies or is injured and (2) death or injury
results from defendant’s possession of dangerous weapon or substances. The burden of proof to rebut the presumption is on the
defendant. However, to have the benefit of the presumption, the
plaintiff, must first establish the existence of the two conditions.
When the possession or use of the weapon or substances
is indispensable in the defendant’s occupation or business, no
presumption arises. The plaintiff has the burden of proving
defendant’s negligence.
Art. 2189. Provinces, cities and municipalities
shall be liable for damages for the death of, or

Liability of provinces, etc. for defective
condition of roads.
Article 2189 does not require the defective road, street, etc.
to belong to the province, city, or municipality for liability to
attach. It only requires that either control or supervision is exercised over the road, street, etc. (Guilatco vs. City of Dagupan,
171 SCRA 382 [1989]; see Jimenez vs. City of Manila, 150 SCRA
510 [1987]; Torio vs. Evangelista, 85 SCRA 599 [1978]; Dumlao
vs. Court of Appeals, 114 SCRA 247 [1982]; Palofox vs. Province
of Ilocos Norte, 162 Phil. 1186 [1958].)
Section 4 of the Charter of the City of Manila (R.A. No.
409.) provides that the City shall not be liable for damages or
injuries to persons or property arising from the failure of any
city officer to enforce its provisions or from their negligence
while enforcing said provisions. The City was held liable to one
who was injured when he fell into an uncovered manhole on
P. Burgos Avenue. Article 2189 is a particular provision which
governs liability due to “defective streets,’’ in particular. It is
not affected by Section 4 which is a general provision referring
to liability arising from negligence in general, regardless of the
object thereof. (City of Manila vs. Teotico, 22 SCRA 267 [1968].)
Art. 2190. The proprietor of a building or structure is responsible for the damages resulting from
its total or partial collapse, if it should be due to the
lack of necessary repairs. (1907)
Liability of proprietor of a building
or structure due to its collapse.
(1) Where the damage is caused by the total or partial collapse of a building or any structure, the proprietor or owner
is prima facie deemed negligent and is made liable, if it should
be due to lack of necessary repairs, because it is his duty to
maintain his property in good condition at all times to avoid
causing injury or damage to another person or property. To
relieve himself from liability, he must prove that property was
in a good state of repair or that the collapse was due to a defect

in its construction in which case the engineer or architect and/
or contract may be held responsible for the damage.40 (see Art.
1723.)

(2) The fact that the property is leased or in usufruct will
not exempt the owner from liability for his duty to make necessary repairs remains although the property is legally in the
possession and control of another. Under the law, the lessee or
the usufructuary is obliged to notify or advise the owner of
the need for urgent or extraordinary repairs. (Arts. 593, 1663.)
The failure of the lessee or usufructuary to give this notice will
entitle the owner to reimbursement, for the damages he may
have been required to pay third parties injured by the collapse
of the property.
Art. 2191. Proprietors shall also be responsible
for damages caused:
(1) By the explosion of machinery which has
not been taken care of with due diligence, and the
inflammation of explosive substances which have
not been kept in a safe and adequate place;
(2) By excessive smoke, which may be harmful
to persons or property;
(3) By the falling of trees situated at or near
highways or lanes, if not caused by force majeure;
(4) By emanations from tubes, canals, sewers or
deposits of infectious matter, constructed without
precautions suitable to the place. (1908)
Liability of proprietors for damages
34
Although the victim may proceed directly against the insurer for indemnity, the third
party liability is only up to the extent of the insurance policy and those required by law.
While it is true that where the insurance contract provides for indemnity against liability
to third persons, and such third persons can directly sue the insurer, the direct liability of
the insurer under indemnity contracts against third party liability does not mean that the
insurer can be held liable in solidum with the insured and/or the other parties found at
fault. The liability of the insurer is based on contract; that of the insured carrier or vehicle
owner is based on tort. (Ibid.)

caused by certain objects.
The Civil Code does not deal in general with inanimate
objects, but provides only for a few specific cases in this part.
The liability caused by inanimate objects is based on either one
of two principles:

(1) Principle of created risks. — When a person introduces in
society a dangerous object from necessity or profit, he exposes
others to danger. If it injures another even without negligence
on the part of the owner or proprietor, he should be liable for
the damage caused; and
(2) Principle of presumed negligence. — When an inanimate
object causes damage to another the owner thereof becomes
liable; proof of fault or negligence is unnecessary because this
is presumed. Article 2191 is based on this principle. (A.M. Tolentino, op. cit., p. 628.)
Art. 2192. If damage referred to in the two preceding articles should be the result of any defect
in the construction mentioned in Article 1723, the
third person suffering damages may proceed only
against the engineer or architect or contractor in accordance with said article, within the period therein
fixed. (1909a)
Rule if cause due to defect in construction.
As provided in the present article, the proprietor or owner
is not liable if the damages referred to in Articles 2190 and 2191
were due to any defect in the construction mentioned in Article
1723. (Chap. 8.) The third person suffering the damages may
proceed only against the engineer or architect or the contractor,
as the case may be, or against all of them in accordance with
Article 1723.
Art. 2193. The head of a family that lives in a
building or a part thereof, is responsible for damages caused by things thrown or falling from the
same. (1910)

376

TORTS

Art. 2187

Liability of head of family for damages
caused by falling objects.
This is another provision which imposes liability without
fault or negligence. (see Arts. 2183, 2188.)

The term “head of the family’’ may not be the owner of the
building and it may include a lessee who lives in the building
or a part thereof. Thus, a manager of a hotel, who was the
lessee of the upper story of a building, was held liable for the
damages caused to the goods of the owners of a store located
on the ground floor of the building, by his failure to provide
a hotel guest with a drainage receptacle for defective faucet,
whose water damaged the goods and articles of said owners.
(Dingcong vs. Kanaan, 72 Phil. 14 [1941].)
The head of the family who may have been obliged to pay
indemnity to the injured party may recover from the person
responsible for the damage. Their liability is solidary. (Art. 2194.)
Art. 2194. The responsibility of two or more persons who are liable for a quasi-delict is solidary. (n)
Solidary liability for quasi-delict.
Joint tortfeasors are solidarily liable for damages. They are
each responsible as principals, to the same extent and in the
same manner as if they had performed the wrongful act themselves individually. The injured party may proceed against any
one of them, or some, or all of them simultaneously, so long as
the indemnity has not been fully satisfied. (see Chap. 1.) There
is no contribution between joint tortfeasors whose liability is
solidary since all of them are liable for the total damage. (see
Far Eastern Shipping Company vs. Court of Appeals, 297 SCRA
30 [1998], under Art. 2178.)
The term “joint tortfeasors’’ include all persons who command, instigate, promote, encourage, advice, countenance, cooperate in, aid or abet the commission of a tort, who approve
of it after it is done for their benefit. Although called “joint,’’

Art. 2187

their liability for quasi-delict is solidary. (Worcester vs. Ocampo,
22 Phil. 42 [1921]; Manio vs. Gaddi, 44 SCRA 198 [1972].)
Thus:

(1) The City of Manila and the corporation which administered the Sta. Market in Manila were held solidarily liable as
joint tortfeasors to plaintiff who was injured when he stepped
into an uncovered opening at the market when it was flooded.
(Jimenez vs. City of Manila, 150 SCRA 510 [1987]; see Sevilla
vs. Court of Appeals, 160 SCRA 198 [1988]; Verzosa vs. Lim,
45 Phil. 416 [1924]; Philippine Shipping Co. vs. Garcia, 6 Phil.
281 [1906].)

(2) The owners of an enterprise are solidarily liable with
their driver for any accident resulting from the latter’s negligent
operation of its vehicle even if said owners were not riding
therein at the time of the accident. (De Leon Brokerage Co.,
Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 4 SCRA 517 [1962]; see Art. 2184.)
(3) A corporation is liable whenever a tortious act is committed by an officer or agent under express direction and
authority from the stockholders or members acting as a body,
or generally, from its directors or governing body. (Philippine
National Bank vs. Court of Appeals, 83 SCRA 237 [1978].)

(4) Where the driver of a dump truck parked it improperly
at night near his residence and it was bumped by the driver of
another car, who suffered damages, the driver and the owner
of the dump truck were solidarily liable for damages. (Phoenix
Construction, Inc. vs. Dionisio, 148 SCRA 353 [1987].)

(5) Where C was allowed to ride on the running board of
a bus, when it was sideswiped by the truck of S which was
driven at a considerable speed as it was negotiating a sharp
curve, the owner of the bus which violated the contract of carriage and S who committed a quasi-delict, were solidarily liable
for damages to the heirs of C. (Sabido vs. Custodio, 17 SCRA
1088 [1966].)
(6) Where the driver of a gasoline tanker run over the de36

liable without prejudice to the right of the owner to sue the
driver for reimbursement. (Malipol vs. Tan, 55 SCRA 202 [1974].)
(7) Where the injury is due to the concurrent negligence of
the drivers of the colliding passenger busses, the driver’s and
owners of said vehicles shall be primarily and solidarily liable
although the action against one is based on quasi-delict and
the other on culpa contractual. (Metro Manila Transit Corp. vs.
Court of Appeals, 223 SCRA 521 [1993].)
Existence of a concert of action or breach
of a joint duty.
Strictly speaking, the words “joint tort’’ should be used
only where the behavior of two or more tortfeasors is such as
to make it proper to treat the conduct of each as the conduct
of the others as well. In effect, this requires the existence of a
concert of action or the breach of a joint duty. In terms of legal
responsibility, the distinguishing feature of a wrong to which
the label joint tort has been affixed is that the tortfeasors will
be held jointly and severally or solidarily liable for the harm
proximately resulting.
(1) Concert of action or common plan. — Cases in which there
is a concert of action or a common plan are the clearest examples of joint torts.41

(2) Breach of common duty. — In addition, when two or

ously defective food products, toilet articles and similar goods are apparently not liable
under this article, is difficult to reconcile with the rule in People vs. Siy Cong Bieng (30 Phil.
577 [1915].) which imposed strict criminal liability to both the actual seller and his employer, regardless of whether or not the latter had any participation or knowledge of the
fact of adulteration of the coffee sold, as a matter of public policy and thereby effectively
reduce the hazards of life and health inherent in deleterious food products and drugs. For
if a person who sells, directly or through another, adulterated coffee in violation the Pure
Foods and Drugs Act can be held strictly liable criminally, there appears to be no valid
reason why a like violation under the article which results in death or physical injuries
to the consumer or user of the injuriously defective food product should not be extended
to the seller thereof as a matter of public policy and for exactly the same purpose and
justification.’’ (Ibid., pp. 382-383.)

more parties who are under a common duty to another fail in
performance, a joint tort has occurred.42

(3) Harm indivisible. — Other situations occur in which there
is neither a concert of action nor a breach of a common duty,
but where a single indivisible harm is sustained as a result of
the independent, separate, but concurring43 tortious acts of two
or more persons.44

While these situations — which may be termed “independently concurring torts’’ — may not properly be viewed as “joint
torts’’ within the definition stated above, there is an increasing
tendency in judicial decisions and among legal commentators45
to impose joint and several liability for the damage caused by
such wrongs, and thus, to establish such torts as “joint’’ in
their practical effect. It must be remembered, however, that the
harm caused here must be of an indivisible nature which is not
practicably apportionable.

(4) Harm divisible or apportionable. — On the other hand,
where the independent concurring acts have caused distinct
and separate injuries to the plaintiff, or where some reasonable
means of apportioning the damages is evident, the courts generally will not hold the tortfeasors jointly and severally liable.
Example: The cattle of several owners simultaneously
trespass on plaintiff’s land or separately owned dogs kill
plaintiff’s sheep. In such cases, no joint tort results and each
owner is liable only for the damages caused by his animals.
In dealing with independent concurring wrongs, therefore,
the issue of the divisibility of harm is paramount in determining
the liability to which the defendant will be subjected.

It is seen that substantive law exhibits four (4) categories in
which the courts have imposed joint and several liability. Two
of these (No. 1.) are more truly joint torts within the original
meaning of the term; the third (No. 2.) is in reality grounded
in the principles of the law of agency, and the last (No. 3.) is
included because it results in indivisible harm for which judicial

Prescription of action upon a quasi-delict.

Another term for “prescription of actions’’ is “limitation of
actions’’ which implies that actions to enforce or preserve a right
or claim must be brought within a certain period of time. The
respective periods of time within which various actions must
be brought are known as “prescriptive periods’’ or “periods of
limitation,’’ and the different laws prescribing such periods are
called “statutes of limitations.’’ (De Leon & De Leon, Jr., Comments and Cases on Property, 2003 Ed., p. 710.)
Under the Civil Code:

“Art. 1146. The following actions must be instituted within
four years:
(1) Upon an injury to the rights of the plaintiff;
(2) Upon a quasi-delict. (n)

Article 1146 speaks of “injury to the rights of the plaintiff’’
and “quasi-delict’’ which are the specific legal nomenclatures
for tort. (Tan v. Court of Appeals, 195 SCRA 355 [1991].)

(1) The purpose of an action or suit and the law to govern
it, including the period of prescription, are to be determined not
by the claim of the party filing the action, made in his argument
or brief, but rather by the complaint itself, its allegations and
prayer for relief.
Thus, a suit questioning petitioner’s removal as corporate
secretary is not necessarily one of quo warranto where its purpose
although it also seeks reinstatement is to ask for damages on
account of such removal. Corollarily, the one-year period fixed
in the Rules of Court (Rule 66, Sec. 16 thereof.) within which
a petition for quo warranto should be filed, counted from the date
of ouster, does not apply. The action must be brought within four
years in accordance with Article 1146(1), for the unjustified separation from employment or illegal dismissal is an injury to the rights

of the plaintiff. (De Tavera vs. Philippine Tuberculosis Society, Inc.,

Foods, Inc. vs. National Labor Relations Commission, 65 SCAD 129,
249 SCRA 379 [1995].)

(2) One’s employment or profession is a property right within the
protection of the constitutional guarantee of due process of law. Clearly
then, when one is arbitrarily deprived of his job or means of livelihood, the action to contest the legality of one’s dismissal constitutes,
in essence, an action predicated upon an injury to his rights. Where
there was no dismissal, but mere suspension of work as a result of the
suspension of one’s driver’s license due to a road mishap, the cause
of action accrues when the demand for reinstatement is categorically
rejected by the employer. (Baliwag Transit, Inc. vs. Ople, 171 SCRA
250 [1989].)
A complaint founded on an illegal dismissal is not an ordinary
money claim but one for reinstatement. Being in derogation of a
worker’s right, the action may be brought within four (4) years from
dismissal pursuant to Article 1146. (New Imus Lumber vs. National
Labor Relations Commission, 221 SCRA 589 [1993].)
(3) Similarly, the action for recovery of damages for taking or
retaining personal property, or incident to trespass upon real estate
prescribes within four years. (see De Bough vs. Singson, 92 Phil. 602
[1953]; Oriental Commercial Co., Inc. vs. Juriedini, Inc., 71 Phil. 25
[1940]; Gapuz vs. Sy Uy, 101 Phil. 1213 [Unrep. 1957].)

(4) The prescriptive period is counted from the day the action
may be brought which means from the day the quasi-delict occurred
or was committed. It has been held that an action against the Central
Bank for “tortious interference,’’ that is, in closing and liquidating a
bank, prescribes in four years from the date of closure. (Allied Banking
Corp. vs. Court of Appeals, 178 SCRA 326 [1989]; Tan vs. Court of
Appeals, supra.)
The running of the prescriptive period is not interrupted by the
filing of a criminal complaint where the civil action for quasi-delict is
filed as a distinct and separate action, independently of the criminal
case. (see Chaps. 4, 10.)

Separate walls of defendants’ two buildings fell simultaneously and crushed plaintiff’s building. (Johnson v. Chapman, 43 W. Va. 639, 28 S.E. 744 [1897];

The acts of the defendants need not be simultaneous to be “concurrent.’’ Negligence
of first defendant caused initial collision with plaintiff’s decedent’s car, and joined with
second defendant’s negligence to result in another collision which finally caused death.

“Concurrent, as distinguished from joint negligence, arises where the injury is
proximately caused by the concurrent wrongful acts or omissions of two or more persons

assignment of responsibility to each, each is liable for the entire damages.’’ (1 Shearman

Chapter 7
TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS
Article 1314. Any third person who induces another to violate his contract shall be liable for damages to the other contracting party.
Liability of third person responsible for breach
of contract.
The rule in Article 1314 is a rule of American law. It is
also proper under the general principles of the Philippine law,
because a contractual right is property. (Report of the Code
Commission, p. 135.)
(1) Real parties in interest in a contract. — The general rule is
that contract take effect only between the parties, their assigns
and heirs. (Art.1 1311, par. 1.) This means that only the parties,
their assigns and heirs can have rights and obligations under
a contract. Since a contract may be violated only by the parties
thereto as against each other, in an action upon the contract,
the real parties in interest, either as plaintiff or as defendant,
must be parties to said contract.

Therefore, a party who has not taken part in it cannot sue
or be sued for performance or for cancellation thereof, unless
he shows that he has a real interest affected thereby.
(2) Unwarranted interference by a stranger. — Article 1314 recognizes an instance when a stranger to a contract can be sued
for damages for his unwarranted interference with the contract.
It presupposes that the contract interfered with is valid and the

391

392

TORTS

Art. 1314

third person has knowledge of the existence of the contract.
(Comments and Cases on Obligations and Contracts, De Leon
and De Leon, Jr., 2003 Ed., pp. 496, 514.)

(3) Nature of liability. — The tort of interference with contracts
may be considered a quasi-delict under Article 2176 (Chap. 6.)
which may make the inducer liable to the other party for damages. It is likewise actionable under Articles 20 and 21. (Chap.
4.)
(4) Interference with another’s business. — Not all interference,
however, is actionable. The fact that defendant’s activity has
injured plaintiff’s business does not mean that plaintiff necessarily is entitled to a remedy.

(a) If the disturbance “falls within the area of socially
acceptable conduct which the law regards as privileged,’’ it
is damnum absque injuria. An injury may be of a kind which
in a relatively free economy, a citizen is obliged to suffer,
such as an injury resulting from lawful competition of which
he cannot complain. (infra.)

(b) If the means of competition are fair, advantage should
remain where success has put it; but if acts complained of
do not rest on some legitimate interest or if there is sharp
dealing or over-reaching or other conduct below the behavior
of fair men similarly situated, the ensuing loss should be
redressed. (96 Am. Jur. 2d 281.)
Tort of interference distinguished from deceit.
This tort which has come to be known as “inducing breach
of contract’’ differs from deceit as follows:
(1) The loss in deceit results immediately from conduct of
the plaintiff himself, induced to take injurious action by reliance
upon the defendant’s fraudulent misrepresentations.

(2) Usually, although not invariably, the business relations
out of which the damage arises in a deceit case are between the
plaintiff and the defendant whereas, in the case of inducement to
breach of contract, the contract involved is between the plaintiff
and a third person. The loss results from the action taken by
the third person, as a result of the defendant’s conduct. (Harper

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

393

and James, The Law of Torts, 1956 Ed., Vol. 1, p. 489.)
Rationale for the rule.
(1) Protection of the constitutional right to contract. — The right
to enter into contract is one of the liberties guaranteed by the
Constitution, and the right derived from a contract is property
that entitles each party thereto to protection and to relief for
the harm caused in case of violation or interference.

Unlawful interference with the freedom of contract is actionable. It may consist in inducing a party to break an existing
contract, or not to enter into a contract, or in preventing him
from making a contract when this is done not in the legitimate
exercise of the defendant’s own rights but with the intent to
injure the plaintiff or to gain some advantage or benefit at the
latter’s expense.
(2) Violation of rights of parties to fulfill a contract and have it
fulfilled. — Although the theory of interference generally depends
on the rule that there is a limit to intentional intermeddling in
the business affairs of another, a more limited theory supports
the tort of interference with an existing contract. Interference
with a contract is tortious because it violates the rights of the
contracting parties to fulfill the contract and to have it fulfilled,
to reap the profits resulting therefrom, and to compel performance by the other party.

In other words, a contract confers certain rights on the
person with whom it is made, and not only binds the parties
to it by the obligation entered into, but also imposes on all the
world the duty of respecting that contractual obligation. (46
Am. Jur. 2d 280-281.)
Elements of the tort.

In order to maintain an act against a third person for tort of
interference with a contractual relation, the following elements
must be shown to be present:

(1) Existence of a valid contract. — To induce one to breach
his contract presupposes the existence of a contract. The breach
must occur because of the alleged act of interference. No tort

394

TORTS

Art. 1314

is committed where at the time of interference of, for example,
a contract of sale, the purchaser has already violated the terms
thereof, and the seller has declared its rescission or cancellation,
or the contract has expired, or the injured party has given a
complete release to the other.
Procuring the breach of a contract is not wrongful if the
contract is illegal, or contrary to public policy. For example,
an action based upon the malicious inducement of a breach of
contract by a client with an attorney is not maintainable where
the contract prohibits the client from settling or compromising
the claim. And no relief will be granted if the contract is invalid
as a result of its being a means by which an unlawful combination in restraint of trade is effected. One may, by proper means,
induce non-performance of a contract whose purpose or effect is
to restrict his business opportunities in violation of public policy.

(2) Knowledge of existence of contract. — Knowledge of the
existence of a contract or business relationship is a condition
of liability for interference with it. There is no liability where
the party charged with procuring a breach of contract has acted
bona fide and for his own legitimate interest, in ignorance of the
existence of any contract. But it is not necessary to prove actual
knowledge. It is enough to show that defendant had knowledge
of facts which, if followed by reasonable inquiry, would have
led to complete disclosure of the contractual relations and rights
of the parties. If a party knows the facts which give rise to the
plaintiff’s contractual right against another, he is subject to liability even though he is mistaken as to the legal significance
of the facts and believes that there is no contract or that the
contract means something other than what it is judicially held
to mean. (Ibid. 85-289.)
The law does not require that the responsible person shall
have known the identity of the injured person. (Gilchrist vs.
Cuddy, 29 Phil. 542 [1915].)

(3) Existence of malice. — Malice in some form is generally
supposed to be an essential ingredient in cases of interference
with contract relations.

Upon the authorities, it is enough if the wrongdoer, hav-

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

395

ing knowledge of the existence of the contract relation, in bad
faith sets about to break it up. Whether his motive is to benefit
himself or gratify his spite by working mischief to a contracting
party is immaterial. Malice in the sense of ill-will or spite is not
essential. (Daywalt vs. Corporacion de UP Agustinos Recoletos,
39 Phil. 587 [1919]; see Jardine Davies, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals,
128 SCAD 20, 333 SCRA 684 [2000].) Hence, it is not necessary
to allege and prove actual malice.

As long as the interference is intentional, it is malicious
in law. There is no liability for interference unless the act in
question was done with the intent to interfere with a contract.
One whose actions were not intended to induce the breach of
a contract cannot be held liable even if a breach thereof occurs.
The knowledge, however, on the part of the defendant of the
existence of a contract creates the presumption that he intended
the consequences of his conduct, thus supplying the element of
malice or motive necessary to make the interference with the
contract a tort.

(4) Causal relation. — Unless the act complained of was the
proximate cause of the injury complained of, there is no liability
for interference. In order to constitute actionable interference
with a contract, it must be shown that by reason of defendant’s
act, a contract which otherwise would have been performed
was abandoned; that is, that there was a breach and that the
defendant was a moving cause thereof.
Representations, however fraudulent and malicious, cannot
give rise to a cause of action for maliciously causing the termination of a contract where the contracting party, in acting to
terminate the contract, did not rely on the representation. Nor
is protection afforded where the interference with an existing
contract is indirect and remote from the damage. Thus, in an
action for procuring the breach of a contract, the defendant may
not be held liable where it is found that the breach by the party
to the contract rather than the persuasion by the defendant was
the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s damage.

(5) Damage or injury. — Damage is an essential element of
the tort of interference. Before recovery can be had for alleged
actionable interference with the performance of an existing

396

TORTS

Art. 1314

contract or for procuring its breach, it must appear that the
acts of the defendant were to the plaintiff’s damage. Where
there is no existing contract, as in the tort of interference with
business relations, the plaintiff must show either that prospective economic advantage would have been achieved had it not
been for such interference or that there was, in view of all the
circumstances, a reasonable assurance thereof. (45 Am. Jur. 2d
281-282.)

(6) Absence of legal justification or excuse. — The malice that
forms an element in an action for interference is legal malice,
that is, the intentional doing of a harmful act without legal
or social justification or excuse, or, in other words, the willful
violation of a known right. (Ibid. 281.)
If the persuasion be used for the indirect purpose of injuring
the plaintiff or benefiting the defendant at the expense of the
plaintiff, it is a malicious act which is in law and fact a wrong
act, and, therefore, a wrongful act, and, therefore, an actionable
act if injury ensues from it. It thus appears that “malice’’ is
employed in this class of cases, as in many others, in a somewhat fictitious sense and means little more than the intentional
invasion of the plaintiff’s interests without a privilege to do so.
The somewhat question-begging formula often used is the
“intentional doing of a wrongful act, without legal justification
or excuse.’’ (Harper & James, op. cit., p. 429.)

(7) Sufficient justification for interference. — A third person is
not liable where sufficient justification for interference can be
shown.

(a) Thus, it was said that if a party enters into a contract
to go with another upon a journey to a remote and unhealthful climate, and a third person with a bona fide purpose of
benefiting the one who is under contract to go, dissuades
him from the step, no action will lie. But if the advice is
not disinterested and the persuasion is used for the indirect
purpose of benefiting himself at the expense of the other
contracting party, the intermeddler is liable if his advice is
taken and the contract broken. (Daywalt vs. Corpo-racion
de PP Agustinos Recoletos, 39 Phil. 587 [1919].)

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

397

(b) Similarly, an unpaid seller commits no act of unlawful interference in giving notice to a prospective buyer of
property that the unpaid seller has not yet been paid by the
vendor who brought the real property from him and that
he still have the option to rescind the sale of the property
to the vendor. (Rubio vs. Court of Appeals, 141 SCRA 488
[1986].)

(8) Actual inducement not always necessary. — The term “inducing breach of contract’’ is somewhat misleading as a description
of the tort in question. Actually, it is not always necessary that
the defendant has “induced’’ or persuaded another to repudiate his contract with the plaintiff. It is necessary, however, that
the defendant by his voluntary conduct has been the cause of
the breach. No complications arise here from the principle of
“proximate causation’’ since the defendant either acts for the
purpose of preventing performance by the third person (which
would amount to “inducement’’) or with knowledge that his
conduct will probably produce such a breach.
There may be a problem, however, of actual cause or cause in
fact. It is sometimes held that the mere entering into a contract
with knowledge that there is an outstanding inconsistent contract
is not itself a “cause’’ of the other’s breach of the prior contract.
Some recent authority, however, indicates that this may be sufficient to incur liability.2 (Harper & James, op. cit., pp. 498-499.)
How contractual interests may be impaired.
(1) False and derogatory statements. — Contractual interests
In Wade v. Culp, 107 Ind. App. 503, 23 N.E.2d 615 [1939].), the plaintiff had entered
into a contract with an inventor, whereby the latter was to invent and develop an electric
steak broiler, the plaintiff to furnish the shop, tools and finances; and, on the satisfactory
development of the same, the plaintiff was to arrange for the manufacture and distribution
of the broiler. After the broiler had been developed, the inventor entered into a contract
with the defendant company whereby it was to produce and market the broiler. Defendant
was held liable for the actual out-of-pocket losses sustained by the plaintiff as a result of the
breach of contract by the inventor. No force, threats, or fraud of any kind was employed
by the defendant company to induce the breach. Indeed, it appears that the inventor first
approached the defendant company and offered to enter into such an arrangement. The
defendant company, however, acted with full knowledge of the outstanding contract between the inventor and the plaintiff. It was only in this sense that the defendant company
“induced’’ the breach. (cited in Harper and James.)

Unless otherwise indicated, refers to article in the Civil Code.
2

398

TORTS

Art. 1314

may be impaired by false statements about the plaintiff which,
because they adversely affect his reputation in the community,
induce third persons to break their contracts with him. Again,
third persons may refuse to carry out their contracts with the
plaintiff because of false statements circulated about the plaintiff’s property, as by throwing doubt on his title thereto or by
reflecting adversely upon the quality thereof.

This type of injury is sometimes treated generally as an
unjustifiable interference with the plaintiff’s profitable economic
relations with others in the nature of injurious falsehood.

(2) Unjustifiable conduct. — In the interference just referred to,
the wrongfulness of the defendant’s conduct consists in the false
and, therefore, misleading character of the statements which he
has made. But people can be induced to break their contracts by
conduct other than false and derogatory statements about the
other party to the contract or the subject matter thereof. When
such results are caused by unjustifiable conduct which does not
fall within the legal pattern for any of the other named torts, it
has in recent years been treated as the tort of “inducing breach
of contract,’’ governed by recognized principles of tort law.
The action is an alternative to recovery against the third
person for the breach. If the plaintiff has already recovered full
damages against the person who has defaulted in performance,
he will frequently be unable to show damage in his action
against the person inducing the breach, a factor necessary to a
recovery from him in tort. (Ibid., pp. 489-490.)
Type of interests protected.
(1) Interest in the security and integrity of contractual relations.
— The interest involved in this tort may be described as the
interest of the individual in the security and integrity of contractual relations into which he has entered. The law affords
protection to such interests in various ways by reason of the
public policy involved in the security of transactions. Since most
important economic relations are controlled by contract rather
than by status, as in earlier societies, it is of the highest social
importance to preserve the integrity of contractual relations.

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

399

Of course, major protection is given this interest by the law
of contracts, with its various remedies for breach. But it is to be
observed that this protection is available against a certain type
of harm and a certain limited class of persons only, namely, the
loss caused by the contractee’s breach, in so far as such loss can
be measured by the value of the lost bargain. The protection
in only available against the party to the contract, and is not
available against third persons.

(2) Interest in the fulfillment of contracts and freedom to enter into
contracts. — The interest in the fulfillment of contracts already
made as well as the interest in freedom to make contracts quite
obviously requires protection against other types of harm. The
core of this protection is to be found in the common law tort
principle that one who intentionally induces another to break
a valid contract is, unless his conduct is privileged, liable for
damages legally caused thereby.
The germ of this principle goes back to periods when status
was more important than contract in the regulation of human
relations. Its seeds are to be found in the Roman law principle
which permitted the pater familias to sue for harm done to persons in potestate, such as a wife, child, or slave. The harm was,
for the most part, caused by physical violence, and this was
the type of harm for which the action first lay at common law.
But the fourteenth century brought the Great Plague and that
piece of social engineering known as the Statute of Labourers,
by which it was made unlawful to entice another’s servants
from his employ whether with or without physical violence.
(Ibid., p. 491.)
When principle has no application.
In any particular case, the question whether a defendant is
liable for procuring a breach of a contract is fraught with grave
policy considerations and will call for a careful analysis of a
number of factors. “In analyzing or considering the circumstances,’’ said Bowen, L.J., in Mogul Steamship Co. v. McGregor
(23 Q.B.D. 598, 618 [1889].) “I think that regard must be had to
the nature of the contract broken; the position of the parties to

400

TORTS

Art. 1314

the contract; the grounds for the breach; the means employed
to procure the breach; the relation of the person procuring the
breach to the person who breaches the contract; and I think also
the object of the person procuring the breach.’’

Aside from the first consideration, most of the factors mentioned by the learned judge go to the question of privilege, the
determination of which will embody the result of the interestbalancing process involved and the resultant appraisal of social
values.

(1) Absence of breach. — The action for inducing a breach
of contract has no application, of course, if there has been no
breach. Thus, there is no liability under the rule of Lumley v.
Gye (6 Q.B.D. 333 [1881].) for enticing away a servant or securing his discharge where the service is at will. An employer can
not be sued in the absence of contract for winning away, by the
offer of higher wages, his rival’s laborers. Such transactions are
the common occurrences of daily life.

To extend the doctrine to cover cases where no breach of
contract has taken place would be as preposterous as it would
be unjust. While in some instances, the interest in entering into
contract relations or continuing in the relationship of employer
and employee receives legal protection, it is not to be confused
with the protection accorded the interest in the fulfillment of
contracts already made. The principles of policy are distinct
and the balancing of social interests involves different sets of
values. The plaintiff’s right to carry on business, that is, to make
contracts without interference, is an altogether different right
from that of being protected from interference with his rights
under the contract already made.
(2) Lack of privity. — If the plaintiff is not a party to the
broken contract nor a third party beneficiary, he can have no
action for inducing breach.

(3) Illegal contract. — No action lies for dissuading one from
performing a contract which is illegal or contrary to public
policy. But where the contract is merely unenforceable for uncertainty, or because within the statute of frauds or the statute
of limitations, it is generally held that the doctrine of liability

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

401

for inducing a breach thereof is applicable. As said by an Oregon court, “The statute of frauds is enacted for the protection
of persons sought to be charged (on the contract). It is personal
and not available to strangers.’’ (Ringer v. Ruby, 117 Ore. 455,
460, 46 A.L.R. 245 [1926].) The object and policy of the law of
contracts in denying an action on a contract within the provisions of the statute of frauds, obviously has little application
to an action for inducing a breach.
The defendant’s conduct, if unjustifiable in a case of an enforceable contract, is quite as reprehensible when the contract is
unenforceable. Indeed, it is a plausible contention that it is more
culpable in the latter case, inasmuch as the plaintiff is denied
his remedy on the contract against the party who has broken it.

(4) Contract to marry. — In most of the cases involving the
question, it is not actionable to induce a breach of contract
to marry. The general unpopularity of actions on the contract
for breach of promise to marry and the general social policy
of making it possible for a party to a prospective marriage to
obtain information concerning the other party, seem to be the
chief considerations leading to his result. In view of the wide
abuse of the action on the contract, it would appear wise not to
extend the opportunity for an unsuccessful suitor or a designing coquette to swell the purse on the failure of a matrimonial
venture to materialize.

Although the allowance of such an action has a superficial
analogy to the action for alienation of affections of a spouse, it
is clear that there are important differences between the two.
The relationship of betrothal is by no means to be compared
to that of marriage. By modern mores, the engagement is often
regarded as a sort of pre-marriage trial run in which the parties
have the opportunity finally to decide whether they desire to
take the last important step of marriage. It is a period in which
they may well seek the advice of friends, as well as members
of their family.
Nevertheless, a few courts have made a distinction between
members of the betrothed’s family and strangers, holding the latter liable for breaking up the match if the plaintiff can prove the

402

TORTS

Art. 1314

malicious or otherwise unjustifiable character of the interference.
(5) Socially undesirable contract. — Courts have also shown
great reluctance to allow recovery for inducing the breach of
other types of contract which, though legal and enforceable,
have come to be regarded as socially undesirable. (Ibid., pp.
493-497.)
Extent of intermeddler’s liability.

(1) Maximum limit. — The defendant found guilty of inducing a breach of a contract cannot be held liable in damage for
more than the amount that can be recovered from the party
who was induced to violate the contract. In Daywalt (supra.),
the Supreme Court said:
“Whatever may be the character of the liability which a
stranger to a contract may incur by advising or assisting one
of the parties to evade performance, there is one proposition upon which all must agree. This is, that the stranger
cannot become more extensively liable in damages for the
nonper-formance of the contract than the party in whose
behalf he intermeddles. To hold the stranger liable for damages in excess of those that could be recovered against the
immediate party to the contract would lead to results at
once grotesque and unjust.’’

(2) Good faith/bad faith of party induced. — Under Article 2202,
the defendant guilty of a crime or quasi-delict shall be liable for
all damages which are the natural and probable consequences
of the act or omission complained of. It is not necessary that
such damages have been foreseen or could have reasonably
been foreseen by the defendant.

(a) However, if the party in whose behalf he intermeddled acted in good faith, said party is liable only for those
damages that are the natural and probable consequences
of the breach and the contracting parties have foreseen or
could have reasonably foreseen at the time the contract was
entered into.
(b) But if he acted in bad faith, he shall be responsible
for all damages which may be reasonably attributed to the
breach of the contract. (Art. 2201.) In such case, the liability

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

403

of the wrongdoer shall be to the same extent in accordance
with Article 2202.

In short, the extent of the liability of the wrongdoer depends
on whether the party induced acted in good faith or in bad
faith, but not for more than the amount for which the latter
can be made liable.
(3) When only wrongdoer liable. — Of course, if the breach
of the contract was against the will or without the consent of a
contracting party, due to the employment of force, intimidation,
fraud or other unlawful means on him, only the wrongdoer will
be liable for damages.
Giving advice to another.
(1) Right/duty to give honest and friendly advice. — In some
jurisdictions, the right to give honest and friendly advice has
been recognized, where the interests of the person giving it are
in some way involved. In these jurisdictions, interference by
giving such advice is not actionable. The purpose of the privilege is to protect the public and private interests and freedom
of communication, decent conduct and professional as well as
lay counsel. The defendant’s position is stronger if he is under
contractual or official duty to advice the third party.

The rule does not justify officious, self-serving, or presumptious assumption of responsibility and interference with the
rights of others.
(2) Advice given solicited/unsolicited. — Generally, one who is
asked for advice may give it in good faith although its effect is
to interfere with another’s business.

In some cases, an individual is privileged to interfere by
offering unsolicited advice. One concerned about another’s
health may recommend to him a doctor other than the one presently prescribing for him. One is justified in advising another
to consult with an attorney when the other is in need of legal
advice or assistance even though the result is to interfere with
contract relations. (45 Am. Jur. 2d 311.)
Interference with prospective contract.

404

TORTS

Art. 1314

Protection is afforded the interest in contractual relations
against harms other than inducement of breach. We may generalize that any intended and unprivileged interference which
causes loss to either party to a transaction is actionable by the
party suffering the loss. (Harper & James, op. cit., p. 499.)
(1) Evidence of prospective economic advantage or benefit. —
The existence of a contract is a primary element of liability for
inducing or procuring a breach of contract. But even in the
absence of any breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty,
one may commit a tort of unjustified interference. Where the
conduct consists in preventing another to enter into a contract,
as in the tort of interference with business relations, the plaintiff
must show either that prospective economic advantage or benefit
would have been obtained had it not been for such interference
or that there was, considering all the circumstances, a reasonable
expectation that a business relationship will arise. (45 Am. Jur.
2d 308.)

(2) Liability to promisee. — Unjustified conduct which prevents
a party to a contract from performing has subjected the actor
to liability to the promisee where the defendant injured the
promisor, where he caused a strike by the promisor’s employees, or where, by refusing to fulfill a contract of purchase, he
deprived an agent of his commission. So too, defendants have
been subjected to liability for inducing a purchaser from plaintiff
not to pay for goods bought until defendant had collected an
alleged debt from plaintiff, and by interfering with property in
such a way as to impair the performance of a contract.

(3) Liability to promisor. — The promisor may be prevented
from performance by acts which make it impossible for him
to perform. Here, the promisee sustains loss to quite the same
extent as though non-performance had been “induced’’ by
the third person. But the value of a bargain may be impaired
although there is no failure of performance. In such a case, it
may be the promisor rather than the promisee who sustains
the loss. Thus, any conduct which is intended to and which,
in fact, makes performance more onerous is, unless privileged,
a tort against the promisor. “An unlawful interference with a
person in the performance of his contract with a third party is

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

405

just as much a legal wrong as is the unlawful inducement of a
breach of that contract by the third party.’’

(4) Recovery by plaintiff induced to break contract. — In exceptional situations, the plaintiff may recover even though it
was he who had been induced by the defendant to break the
contract.

Recovery has been allowed where defendant increased the
costs to plaintiff under contract with the town to keep a road in
repair by deliberately dumping stone and rubbish on it. So, too,
unlawful conduct which prevents the plaintiff from performing
will make defendant liable for depriving him of the benefits
and profits which he would have derived from performance.

In all these and like situations, the defendant either acts for
the purpose of causing the very harm of which the plaintiff
complained or, although acting primarily to advance some interest of his own, has knowledge of facts which make it certain
that the plaintiff will suffer such harm. If the defendant neither
knows nor has reason to know that the plaintiff will sustain
loss in respect to his contract relations, it appears that there is
no liability. (Harper & James, op. cit., pp. 499-501.)
Negligent interference.
May there be liability for negligent, as distinguished from
intentional, interference with contractual relations?

In the first place, it is clear that there can be no such thing
as negligently inducing a breach of contract. The very idea of
inducement implies that the defendant acted for the purpose of
bringing about a breach or, at least, acted with knowledge that,
if he attained his purpose, a breach would result. Accordingly,
negligent interference must consist in conduct which involves
a likelihood of resulting in a breach of the contract or which in
some other way creates a risk that one or the other of the parties to the contract will be deprived of some of its advantage.
(Ibid., p. 501.)
Pre-contractual interferences.
(1) Reasonable expectations of economic advantage. — The interest

406

TORTS

Art. 1314

protected is different here than that considered in the preceding
discussions.

Instead of the interest in the security of contracts already
made, it is the interest in reasonable expectations of economic
advantage. This, of course, involves society’s interest in affording
to the individual a fair opportunity to conduct his legitimate
business affairs without interruption from others except in so far
as such interferences are sanctioned by the “rules of the game‘’
which society has adopted. It is obvious that some such protection is necessary for any orderly community in our civilization.
(2) Right against competition. — As long ago as 1871, a Massachusetts court (Walker v. Cronin, 107 Mass. 555, 564 [1871].)
said:
“Every one has a right to enjoy the fruits and advantages of his own enterprise, industry, skill and credit. He
has no right to be protected against competition, but he has
a right to be free from malicious and wanton interference,
disturbance and annoyance. If disturbance or loss comes as
a result of competition or the exercise of like rights by others, it is damnum absque injuria, unless some superior right
by contract or otherwise is interfered with. But if it comes
from the merely wanton or malicious acts of others, without
the justification of competition or the service of any interest
or lawful purpose, it then stands upon a different footing.’’

Here again, as in the case of inducing breach of contract, the
principle is that intentional interference with another’s efforts
to enter into profitable contractual relations is actionable unless
it falls within the area of socially acceptable conduct which the
law regards as privileged.

(3) Relations between employer and employee. — In addition to
cases involving trade and competition, the principle has found
frequent application to the relations between employer and
employee.

If an employer is prevented from obtaining workmen or
deprived of the continued service of his workmen, even though
their contract was at will, by conduct which is itself unlawful,
as by violence or threats of violence, he has an action against
the wrongdoer. So too, the use of such unlawful means to pre-

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

407

vent a workman from obtaining employment or to procure his
discharge from employment at will is actionable.

(4) Means employed. — The wrong ordinarily requires conduct
intended to interrupt negotiations or prevent the consummation
of a contract. As has been seen, the general rule appears to be
that liability for the interference even with existing contracts
cannot be based on mere negligent conduct. A fortiori, the general rule denies liability for unintended, even though negligent,
interference with mere prospective advantage under contracts
not yet completed.
If the means employed by the defendant in preventing
the making of contracts or other advantageous business are in
themselves unlawful, as by force or threats of force or libel or
slander, there is liability. No question of privilege is involved.
If the means employed are in themselves lawful although intended to interfere with the plaintiff’s economic expectations,
the question of liability will turn on the issue of privilege.
(5) Purpose of interference. — If the defendant’s purpose was
all bad, that is, if the acted solely for the purpose of causing
harm to the other and not to advance any interest of his own,
a third person or the public interest, again there will be no
privilege available for the obvious reason that deliberate injury
to a legally protected interest of another cannot be justified by
the mere desire to injure. But where, as in most cases, the defendant acts at least in part for the purpose of protecting some
legitimate interest which conflicts with that of the plaintiff, a
line must be drawn and the interests evaluated.
This process results in according or denying a privilege
which, in turn, determines liability. (Ibid., pp. 511-514.)
Privilege to interfere with contractual
relations and expectancies.
(1) General statement. — The generalization may be made that
any intentional interference with the performance of a contract
already made, so that a breach ensues to the plaintiff’s damage
or the performance by the plaintiff is made more onerous, or
any intentional interference with negotiations reasonably certain

408

TORTS

Art. 1314

to result in an advantageous contract on the part of the plaintiff,
is, unless privileged, an actionable wrong.

The mental element necessary to be shown on the part of
the defendant is the mere intention to invade the plaintiff’s
economic interests.
(2) Defendant’s object or motive. — It is well to keep in mind
the general social policy crystallized in the doctrine of privilege. The policy permits a privilege intentionally to invade the
legally protected interests of others only if the defendant acts
to promote the interest of others, himself or the public, and if
the interest which he seeks to advance is superior to the interest
invaded in social importance. There is no rule of thumb to be
applied in every case. In analyzing the circumstances, regard
must be had to the type of contract broken or prevented, the
means employed by the defendant, and the object or purpose
of the defendant in interfering therewith.
The type and character of the contract with which the defendant interfered may also be of importance as throwing light upon
the defendant’s object or motive. Thus, a parent’s interference
with a child’s engagement to marry presents a different motive
from a businessman’s interference with a competitor’s trade.
(3) Where purpose solely to harm plaintiff. — A thoroughly
bad motive, that is, a purpose solely to harm the plaintiff, of
course, is sufficient to exclude any apparent privilege which
the interests of the parties might otherwise create, just as such
a motive will defeat the immunity of any other conditional
privilege. If the defendant does not act in a bona fide attempt
to protect his own interest or the interest of others involved in
the situation, he forfeits the immunity of the privilege. Contrary
to the oft-repeated dogma that mere motive can not make an
otherwise lawful act unlawful, the cases abound to the effect
that when the interests of the plaintiff and the defendant are
substantially equal in social importance, a desire solely to cause
loss to the plaintiff, unmixed with any purpose to advance his
own interest, will make a defendant’s conduct actionable.

It will be seen that the doctrine that motive can not affect the
actionable character of conduct really begs the question. Conduct

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

409

is actionable, when it is indulged solely to harm another, since
the legitimate interest of the defendant is practically eliminated
from consideration. The defendant’s interest, although of such a
character as to justify an invasion of another’s similar interest,
is not to be taken into account when the defendant acts, not
for the purpose of protecting that interest, but solely to damage the plaintiff.

(4) Balancing of interests. — In balancing the conflicting
interests of the plaintiff and the defendant and assessing the
value which society places upon them, the difference between
the loss of an existing contract and the anticipated profits therefrom and the loss of merely an anticipated contract or series of
them is important. The law does not allow as much latitude in
interfering with the former as the latter. The privileges are thus
correspondingly narrower.
In both cases, the principal privileges are the privilege of
competition in trade and the privilege recognized as appropriate in industrial conflict where the interests of employees and
workmen are in conflict. Both fields of law lie outside the area
of a treatise on torts, the one usually identified as the law of
unfair competition, the other as labor law. (Ibid., pp. 514-517.)
Interference by means of competition.
(1) Methods of competition employed. — Competition in business, even though carried to the extent of ruining a rival, constitutes justifiable interference in another’s business relations,
and is not actionable as long as it is carried on in furtherance
of one’s own interest. But interference with the business relations of another by means of competition is not justifiable where
the methods of competition employed are unfair or not lawful,
or where the dominant purpose of the competition is to inflict
harm or injury and not to further one’s business. (45 Am. Jur.
2d 309.)
Thus, the act of a defendant, a man of considerable influence
in the community, in establishing a barber shop and enticing
customers away from plaintiff’s barber shop, “not for the sake
of profit himself, but regardless of loss to himself, and for the

410

TORTS

Art. 1314

sole purpose of driving his competitor out of business, and with
the intention of himself retiring upon the accomplishment of his
malevolent purpose [is] a wanton wrong and an actionable tort.
In such case, he would not be exercising his legal right, or doing
an act which can be judged separately from the motive which
actuated him.’’ (Turtle vs. Buck, 107 Minn. 145, 119 N.W. 946.)
(2) Only “unfair’’ competition prohibited. — One who causes
loss of business or occupation to another merely by engaging in
a business or occupation in good faith is not liable to the other
for loss caused, though he knows that the loss will result. The
individualistic philosophy of capitalist society adopts as one of
its basic premises the social desirability of free competition in
trade and business. Our commercial and industrial community
is organized on the assumption that the welfare of society is
best advanced by the elimination of unnecessary restrictions on
competition.
Competition as such is desirable and, therefore, lawful. It is
only “unfair’’ competition that is prohibited. (Harper & James,
op. cit., p. 517.)

(3) Right or privilege to select business relations. — Competition is an integral part of our free enterprise system. Free enterprise implies freedom to select persons with whom one will
do business. “Denial of this privilege to select business relations
would interfere, it is thought, with an important factor in the
competitive process and might defeat its aim. The privilege is
basic in the politics of individualism. Liberty of the individual
is thought to include liberty to acquire property and freedom
to engage in business transactions.’’ Thus, there is ordinarily no
liability in refusing to deal with another unless the refusal is
made for the purpose of acquiring or maintaining a monopoly.

There are, of course, specific exceptions to the general
principle. A public utility, required by law to serve all without
discrimination, may not arbitrarily refuse to deal. Subject to such
exceptions, however, the privilege of competition embraces the
primary boycott by a single person and, in general, the secondary or tertiary boycott when occurring in the ordinary course
of a single defendant’s business as a trade weapon used for
the purpose of advancing his own interests. (Ibid., p. 521; see
Art. 28, Chap. 4.)

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

411

The privilege of competition.

The privilege of competition is a basic assumption in the
law of unfair competition, as it is in even broader form, in the
economics of free enterprise and in the politics of individualism.
The privilege to engage in business and to compete contemplates
the probability of harm to the business or occupation of some
persons who are subjected to the competition. The theory is that
in the long run, competition promotes efficiency and economic
general welfare and that to subject a person to liability merely
for competition would result in preventing competition.
(1) Extends only to interference with probable expectancies. —
The privilege of competition extends only to interference with
probable expectancies. It does not justify interference with existing contract relations. A man may compete to obtain future
customer but he must keep his hands off the business which a
competitor has already obtained. Thus, a businssman may not,
by the offer of better terms or other inducement, persuade a
third person to break a contract with a competitor, nor procure
the violation of exclusive sales or agency agreements which are
valid contracts.
(2) Extends only to competitors. — The privilege of competition,
of course, extends only to competitors. If the defendant’s business interest is distinct from that of the person harmed, he is not
a competitor. And the defendant’s conflicting interest must be in
direct competition with the plaintiff’s invaded interest. Where the
defendant, a wholesaler, engaged in retail trade, solely to drive
the plaintiff out of business, it was held that his interest was not
sufficiently in conflict to make him a bona fide competitor.

(3) Bounds of the privilege. — The bounds of the privilege of
competition may be described as limited by the actor’s intention
and by the character of the practices which he employs. Stated
in other words, competition in trade, business or occupation
affords a privilege to interfere with relations of prospective
economic advantage:
(a) so long as the competitor’s purpose is regarded as
justifiable in the sense that it is within the limits of the
accepted ethical code applicable to such transactions; and
(b) so long as he does not resort to fraud or deception

412

TORTS

Art. 1314

or other means which are regarded as “unfair’’ in the sense
that they are outside the limits of current business mores.

(4) Purpose of the interference. —
­ If the purpose of the defendant is primarily to advance his own interests in the trade or
business, as the plaintiff’s competitor, the privilege of competition is not exceeded by reason of the actor’s motive.
(a) But if the sole purpose on the part of the defendant
is to invade the plaintiff’s conflicting interests, the defense
of privilege is not available. Thus, it has been held that one
may not enter a business or so conduct his business as to
ruin a competitor when the sole purpose is spite and ill-will
against the competitor.

(b) But persons engaged in commerce may deliberately
obtain the trade of others or may employ indirect methods
for the purpose of eliminating competitors from the trade,
the intent to harm others being justified by the accompanying
and paramount desire to promote their own interests. When
such practices are indulged by organizations created for the
purpose of controlling commodity prices and perfecting a
monopoly, they may be actionable under statutes against
conspiracies to harm and prohibiting contracts in restraint
of trade.

(c) Where the defendant adopts practices which are
calculated to mislead the public or which constitute fraud
or deception intended to deprive a rival of customers, he is
liable for engaging in “unfair’’ competition, which means that
he has exceeded the boundaries of the privilege to compete.
This may be done by intimidating the plaintiff’s customers,
by defaming the plaintiff or his goods, by appropriating, in
various ways, the plaintiff’s custom, good will or reputation,
frequently by “passing off’’ goods of the defendant as those
of the plaintiff.

(5) Interference through fraud or misrepresentation. — The weapons used by the trader must be those furnished by the laws of
trade, or at least must not be inconsistent with their free operation.
No man can justify an interference with another man’s business
through fraud or misrepresentation. One of the most common

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

413

ways of unfair appropriation of the plaintiff’s good will is by the
imitation of the plaintiff’s trade-mark or trade-name to such an
extent that the public is deceived thereby. (Ibid., pp. 517-520.)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. Appellants succeeded in inducing owner of a cinematographic
film already leased to a theater operator to violate his contract by offering a higher rental for the exhibition of said film in their theater.

Facts: In accordance with the terms of the contract entered
into between C, owner of a cinematograph film, and G, a theater
proprietor, the former leased to the latter a film for exhibition
in G’s theater in Iloilo for P125.00 a week. E and Z, who own
another theater in the same place and who know that said film
was leased although they did not know the identity of the lessee,
offered to lease the same from C for a rental of P350.00 a week.
In order that he might accept their offer, C wrote G stating that
he has made other arrangements for the film and returned the
money paid to him by G, thereby willfully violating his contract
because E and Z offered him a higher rental for the same period.
G commenced action seeking that the court issue a preliminary injunction against E and Z prohibiting them from receiving,
exhibiting, or using said film in Iloilo. G was able to procure an
injunction.

Issue: Are E and Z liable for interfering with the contract
between C and G, although they did not know at the time the
identity of G?
Held: Yes. The mere right to compete could not justify the appellants E and Z in intentionally inducing C to take away plaintiff
G’s contractual rights.

(1) Sufficient justification for interference with plaintiff’s right
must be an equal or superior right in defendents. — “Chief Justice
Wells in Walker vs. Cronin (107 Mass., 555), said: ‘Everyone has
a right to enjoy the fruits and advantages of his own enterprise,
industry, skill and credit. He has no right to be protected against
competition; but he has a right to be free from malicious and
wanton interference, disturbance or annoyance. If disturbance or
loss comes as a result of competition, or the exercise of like rights
by others, it is damnum absque injuria, unless some superior right
by contract or otherwise is interfered with.”
In Read vs. Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons ([1902]

414

TORTS

Art. 1314

2 K.B., 88), Darling, J., said: ‘I think the plaintiff has a cause of
action against the defendants, unless the court is satisfied that,
when they interfered with the contractual rights of plaintiff, the
defendants had a sufficient justification for their interference; . .
. for it is not a justification that ‘they acted bona fide in the best
interests of the society of masons,’ i.e., in their own interests. Nor
is it enough that ‘they were not actuated by improper motives. I
think their sufficient justification for interference with plaintiff’s
right must be an equal or superior right in themselves, and that
no one can legally excuse himself to a man, of whose contract he
has procured the breach, on the ground that he acted on a wrong
understanding of his own rights, or without malice, or bona fide,
or in the best interests of himself, or even that he acted as an
altruist, seeking only the good of another and careless of his own
advantage.’ (Quoted with approval in Beekman vs. Marsters, 195
Mass., 205)’’
(2) Mere desire to make a profit to the detriment of plaintiff sufficient
to constitute unlawful interference. — “It is said that the ground on
which the liability of a third party for interfering with a contract
between others rests, is that the interference was malicious. The
contrary view, however, is taken by the Supreme Court of the
United States in the case of Angle vs. Railway Co. (151 U. S., 1.)
The only motive for interference by the third party in that case
was the desire to make a profit to the injury of one of the parties of the contract. There was no malice in the case beyond the
desire to make an unlawful gain to the detriment of one of the
contracting parties.
In the case at bar the only motive for the interference with
the Gilchrist-Cuddy contract on the part of the appellants was a
desire to make a profit by exhibiting the film in their theater. There
was no malice beyond this desire; but this fact does not relieve
them of the legal liability for interfering with that contract and
causing its breach. It is, therefore, clear, under the above authorities, that they were liable to Gilchrist for the damages caused by
their acts, unless they are relieved from such liability by reason
of the fact that they did not know at the time the identity of the
original lessee (Gilchrist) of the film.’’

(3) Knowledge of identity of injured party not required. — “The
liability of the appellants arises from unlawful acts and not from
contractual obligations, as they were under no such obligation to
induce Cuddy to violate his contract with Gilchrist. So that if the
action of Gilchrist had been one for damages, it would be governed

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

415

by chapter 2, title 16, book 4 of the Civil Code. Article 1902 [now
2176] of that Code provides that a person who, by act or omission,
causes damage to another when there is fault or negligence, shall
be obliged to repair the damage so done. There is nothing in this
article which requires as a condition precedent to the liability of a
tortfeasor that he must know the identity of a person to whom he
causes damage. In fact, the chapter wherein this article is found
clearly shows that no such knowledge is required in order that
the injured party may recover for the damage suffered.’’

(4) Issuance of preliminary injunction justified. — “We are not
lacking in authority to support our conclusion that the court was
justified in issuing the preliminary injunction against the appellants. Upon the precise question as to whether injunction will
issue to restrain wrongful interference with contracts by strangers
to such contracts, it may be said that courts in the United States
have usually granted such relief where the profits of the injured
person are derived from his contractual relations with a large
and indefinite number of individuals, thus reducing him to the
necessity of proving in an action against the tortfeasor that the
latter was responsible in each case for the broken contract, or else
obliging him to institute individual suits against each contracting
party and so exposing him to a multiplicity of suits.
Sperry & Hutchinson Co. vs. Mechanics’ Clothing Co. (128 Fed.,
800); Sperry & Hutchin son Co. vs. Louis Weber & Co. (161 Fed., 219);
Sperry & Hutchinson Co. vs. Pommer (199 Fed., 309) were all cases
wherein the respondents were inducing retail merchants to break
their contracts with the company for the sale of the latter’s trading
stamps. Injunction issued in each case restraining the respondents
from interfering with such contracts.

In the case of the Nashville R.R. Co. vs. McConnell (82 Fed.,
65), the court, among other things, said: ‘One who wrongfully
interferes in a contract between others, and, for the purpose of
gain to himself induces one of the parties to break it, is liable to
the party injured thereby; and his continued interference may
be ground for an injunction where the injuries resulting will be
irreparable.’
In Hamby & Toomer vs. Georgia Iron & Coal. Co. (127 Ga., 792),
it appears that the respondents were interfering in a contract for
prison labor, and the result would be, if they were successful, the
shutting down of the petitioner’s plant for an indefinite time. The
court held that although there was no contention that the respondents were insolvent, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in

416

TORTS

Art. 1314

granting a preliminary injunction against the respondents.

In Beekman vs. Marsters (195 Mass., 205), the plaintiff had
obtained from the Jamestown Hotel Corporation, conducting a
hotel within the grounds of the Jamestown Exposition, a contract
whereby he was made their exclusive agent for the New England
States to solicit patronage for the hotel. The defendant induced
the hotel corporation to break their contract with the plaintiff in
order to allow him to act also as their agent in the New England
States. The court held that an action for damages would not have
afforded the plaintiff adequate relief, and that an injunction was
proper compelling the defendant to desist from further interference with the plaintiff’s exclusive contract with the hotel company.
In Elliott on Contracts, section 2511, it is said: ‘Injunction is the
proper remedy to prevent a wrongful interference with contracts
by strangers to such contracts where the legal remedy is insufficient and the resulting injury is irreparable. And where there is a
malicious interference with lawful and valid contracts a permanent
injunction will ordinarily issue without proof of express malice.
So, an injunction may be issued where the complainant and the
defendant were business rivals and the defendant had induced
the customers of the complainant to break their contracts with
him by agreeing to indemnify them against liability for damages.
So, an employee who breaks his contract of employment may be
enjoined from inducing other employees to break their contracts
and enter into new contracts with a new employer of the servant
who first broke his contract.
But the remedy by injunction cannot be used to restrain a legitimate competition, though such competition would involve the
violation of a contract. Nor will equity ordinarily enjoin employees
who have quit the service of their employer from attempting by
proper argument to persuade others from taking their places so
long as they do not resort to force or intimidation or obstruct the
public thoroughfares.’” (Gilchrest vs. Cuddy, 29 Phil. 542 [1915].)

2. Defendant, fully aware of the contract of sale but without being
prompted by improper motive, advised vendor not to carry it into effect.

Facts: Plaintiff Daywatt (D) seeks to recover from defendant
corporation the sum of P500,000, as damages, on the ground that
said corporation, for its own selfish purposes, unlawfully induced
Teodorica Endencia (TE) to refrain from the performance of her
contract for the sale of the land in question and to withhold de-

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

417

livery to the plaintiff of the Torrens title.

The cause of action is based on a liability derived from the
wrongful interference of the defendant in the performance of the
contract between the plaintiff and TE. It appears that D as the
owner of the land which he had bought from TE, entered into a
contract for the sale and disposal of said lands to a sugar growing and milling enterprise, the successful launching of which
depended on the ability of D to get possession of the land and
the Torrens certificate of title.
TE was in the end prevailed upon by the defendant to stand
out against the performance of her contract with the plaintiff with
the result that the plaintiff was kept out of possession until the
project for the establishment of a large sugar growing and milling
enterprise fell through.
Issues: (1) Whether a person who is not a party to a contract for
the sale of land makes himself liable for damages to the vendee,
beyond the value of the use and occupation, by colluding with
the vendor and maintaining him in the effort to resist an action
for specific performance.

(2) Whether the damages which the plaintiff seeks to recover
under this head are too remote and speculative to be the subject
of recovery.

Held: (1) Advice or assistance given by defendant not prompted by
improper motive. — “As preliminary to a consideration of the first
of these questions, we deem it well to dispose of the contention
that the members of the defendant corporation, in advising and
prompting Teodorica Endencia not to comply with the contract
of sale, were actuated by improper and malicious motives. The
trial court found that this contention was not sustained, observing that while it was true that the circumstances pointed to an
entire sympathy on the part of the defendant corporation with
the efforts of Teodorica Endencia to defeat the plaintiff’s claim
to the land, the fact that its officials may have advised her not
to carry the contract into effect would not constitute actionable
interference with such contract.

It may be added that when one considers the hardship that
the ultimate performance of that contract entailed on the vendor,
and the doubt in which the issue was involved — to the extent
that the decision of the Court of the First Instance was unfavorable
to the plaintiff and the Supreme Court itself was divided — the
attitude of the defendant corporation, as exhibited in the conduct

418

TORTS

Art. 1314

of its procurador, Juan Labarga, and other members of the order
of the Recollect Fathers, is not difficult to understand.

To our mind a fair conclusion on this feature of the case is
that father Juan Labarga and his associates believed in good faith
that the contract could not be enforced and that Teodorica would
be wronged if it should be carried into effect. Any advice or assistance which they may have given was, therefore, prompted
by no mean or improper motive. It is not, in our opinion, to be
denied that Teodorica would have surrendered the documents of
title and given possession of the land but for the influence and
promptings of members of the defendant corporation. But we do
not credit the idea that they were in any degree influenced to the
giving of such advice by the desire to secure to themselves the
paltry privilege of grazing their cattle upon the land in question
to the prejudice of the just rights of the plaintiff.’’

(2) Right and liability of stranger under a contract. — “A contract,
when effectually entered into between certain parties, determines
not only the character and extent of the liability of the contracting parties but also the person or entity by whom the obligation
is exigible. The same idea should apparently be applicable with
respect to the person against whom the obligation of the contract
may be enforced; for it is evident that there must be a certain
mutuality in the obligation, and if the stranger to a contract is
not permitted to sue to enforce it, he cannot consistently be held
liable upon it.

If the two antagonistic ideas which we have just brought
into juxtaposition are capable of reconciliation, the process must
be accomplished by distinguishing clearly between the right of
action arising from the improper interference with the contract by
a stranger thereto, considered as an independent act generative of
civil liability, and the right of action ex contractu against a party
to the contract resulting from the breach thereof.’’
(3) Extent of liability of stranger. — “Whatever may be the
character of the liability which a stranger to a contract may incur
by advising or assisting one of the parties to evade performance,
there is one proposition upon which all must agree. This is, that
the stranger cannot become more extensively liable in damages
for the nonperformance of the contract than the party in whose
behalf he intermeddles. To hold the stranger liable for damages
in excess of those that could be recovered against the immediate
party to the contract would lead to results at once grotesque and
unjust.

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

419

In the case at bar, as Teodorica Endencia was the party directly bound by the contract, it is obvious that the liability of the
defendant corporation, even admitting that it has made itself coparticipant in the breach of the contract, can in no event exceed
hers. This leads us to consider at this point the extent of the
liability of Teodorica Endencia to the plaintiff by reason of her
failure to surrender the certificate of title and to place the plaintiff
in possession.’’
(4) Measure of damages for wrongful detention of real property by
the vendor Teodorica Endencia. — “The most that can be said with
reference to the conduct of Teodorica Endencia is that she refused
to carry out a contract for the sale of certain land and resisted
to the last an action for specific performance in court. The result
was that the plaintiff was prevented during a period of several
years from exerting that control over the property which he was
entitled to exert and was meanwhile unable to dispose of the
property advantageously. Now, what is the measure of damages
for the wrongful detention of real property by the vendor after
the time has come for him to place the purchaser in possession?

The damages ordinarily and normally recoverable against
a vendor for failure to deliver land which he has contracted to
deliver is the value of the use and occupation of the land for
the time during which it is wrongfully withheld. And of course,
where the purchaser has not paid the purchase money, a deduction may be made in respect to the interest on the money which
constitutes the purchase price.
Substantially, the same rule holds with respect to the liability
of a landlord who fails to put his tenant in possession pursuant
to a contract of lease. The measure of damages is the value of
the leasehold interest, or use and occupation, less the stipulated
rent, where this has not been paid. The rule that the measure of
damages for the wrongful detention of land is normally to be
found in the value of use and occupation is, we believe, one of
the things that may be considered certain in the law — almost as
well settled, indeed, as the rule that the measure of damages for
the wrongful detention of money is to be found in the interest.’’

(5) Determination of extent of liability for breach of a contract. —
“The extent of the liability for the breach of a contract must be
determined in the light of the situation in existence at the time
the contract is made; and the damages ordinarily recoverable are
in all events limited to such as might be reasonably foreseen in

420

TORTS

Art. 1314

the light of the facts then known to the contracting parties.

Where the purchaser desires to protect himself, in the contingency of the failure of the vendor promptly to give possession,
from the possibility of incurring other damages than such as
are incident to the normal value of the use and occupation, he
should cause to be inserted in the contract a clause providing for
stipulated amount to be paid upon failure of the vendor to give
possession; and no case has been called to our attention where,
in the absence of such a stipulation, damages have been held to
be recoverable by the purchaser in excess of the normal value
of use and occupation. On the contrary, the most fundamental
conceptions of the law relative to the assessment of damages are
inconsistent with such idea.’’

(6) Liability for ordinary/special damages. — “The principles
governing this branch of the law were profoundly considered
in the case of Hadley vs. Baxendale (9 Exch., 341), decided in the
English Court of Exchequer in 1854. x x x.

The discussion contained in the opinion of the court in that
case leads to the conclusion that the damages recoverable in case
of the breach of a contract are two sorts, namely: (1) the ordinary,
natural, and in a sense necessary damage; and (2) special damages.
Ordinary damage is found in all breaches of contract where
there are no special circumstances to distinguish the case specially
from other contracts. x x x Special damage, on the other hand,
is such as follows less directly from the breach than ordinary
damage. It is only found in case where some external condition,
apart from the actual terms to the contract exists or intervenes, as
it were, to give a turn to affairs and to increase damage in a way
that the promisor, without actual notice of that external condition, could not reasonably be expected to foresee. Concerning this
sort of damage, Hadley vs. Baxendale (1854) (supra), lays down the
definite and just rule that before such damage can be recovered
the plaintiff must show that the particular condition which made
the damage a possible and likely consequence of the breach was
known to the defendant at the time the contract was made.’’

(7) Special damages not within the contemplation of parties. —
“In the preceding discussion, we have considered the plaintiff’s
right chiefly as against Teodorica Endencia; and what has been
said suffices in our opinion to demonstrate that the damages laid
under the second cause of action in the complaint could not be
recovered from her, first, because the damages in question are

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

421

special damages which were not within contemplation of the
parties when the contract was made, and secondly, because said
damages are too remote to be the subject of recovery.
This conclusion is also necessarily fatal to the right of the
plaintiff to recover such damages from the defendant corporation,
for, as already suggested, by advising Teodorica not to perform
the contract, said corporation could in no event render itself more
extensively liable than the principal in the contract.’’ (Daywalt vs.
Corporacion de los Padres Agustino Recoletos, 39 Phil. 587 [1919].)

3. Foreign manufacturer of wall covering products with which
petitioners has had an exclusive distributorship agreement was misled
into believing that the goods ordered by respondent were to be shipped
to another country but they were actually sent to and sold in the Philippines.

Facts: Petitioner Y has had an exclusive sales agency agreement
with House of Mayfair (HM), a foreign company, to promote and
procure orders for HM wall covering products from customers in
the Philippines. Even as Y was such exclusive distributor, private
respondent UMC, which was then Y’s dealer, imported the same
goods via the FNF Trading which eventually sold the merchandise
in the domestic market.
Y pressed the idea that he was practically by-passed and that
private respondent acted in concert with the FNF Trading in misleading HM into believing that the goods ordered by the trading
firm were intended for shipment to Nigeria although they were
actually shipped to and sold in the Philippines. UMC professed
ignorance of the exclusive contract in favor of Y. Even then, it
responded by asserting that petitioner’s understanding with HM
is binding only between the parties thereto.

In the course of the hearing, the arguments for and against
the issuance of the requested writ of preliminary injunction, Y
impressed before the lower court that he is seeking to enjoin the
sale and distribution by UMC of the same goods in the market.
The motion for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction
was denied by the lower. In the petition at hand, Y anchors his
plea for redress on his perception that UMC has distributed and
continues to sell HM covering products in contravention of Y’s
exclusive right conferred by the covenant with HM.
Issue: Did respondent appellate court correctly agree with the

422

TORTS

Art. 1314

lower court in disallowing the writ solicited by Y.

Held: No. (1) Injunction is appropriate remedy. — “Verily, injunction is the appropriate remedy to prevent a wrongful interference
with contracts by strangers to such contracts where the legal remedy is insufficient and the resulting injury is irreparable. (Gilchrist
vs. Cuddy, 29 Phil. 542 [1915]; 4-A Padilla, Civil Code Annotated,
1988 Ed., p. 90.) The liability of private respondent, if any, does
not emanate from the four corners of the contract for undoubtedly, Unisia Merchandising Co., Inc. is not a party thereto but its
accountability is ‘an independent act generative of civil liability.’
(Daywalt vs. Corporacion de PP. Agustinos Recoletos, 39 Phil.
587 [1919]; Paras, Civil Code of the Philippines Annotated, 1981
10th Ed., p. 439; Tolentino, Commentaries and Jurisprudence on
the Civil Code, 1986 Ed., p. 439).
These observations, however, do not in the least convey the
message that We have placed the cart ahead of the horse, so to
speak, by pronouncing private respondent’s liability at this stage
in view of the pendency of the main suit for injunction below. We
are simply rectifying certain misperceptions entertained by the appellate court as regards the feasibility of requesting a preliminary
injunction to enjoin a stranger to an agreement.
To Our mind, the right to perform an exclusive distributorship agreement and to reap the profits resulting from such performance are proprietary rights which a party may protect (30 Am.
Jur. Section 19, pp. 71-72; Jurado, Comments and Jurisprudence
on Obligations and Contracts, 1983 8th Rev. Ed., p. 336), which
may otherwise not be diminished, nay, rendered illusory by the
expedient act of utilizing or interposing a person or firm to obtain
goods from the supplier to defeat the very purpose for which the
exclusive distributorship was conceptualized, at the expense of
the sole authorized distributor. (43 C.J.S. 59.7)’’

(2) UMC caused breach of contract by HM. — “Another circumstance which respondent court overlooked was petitioner’s
suggestion, which was not disputed by herein private respondent
in its comment, that the House of Mayfair in England was duped
into believing that the goods ordered through the FNF Trading
were to be shipped to Nigeria only, but the goods were actually
sent to and sold in the Philippines. A ploy of this character is akin
to the scenario of a third person who induces a party to renege
on or violate his undertaking under a contract, thereby entitling
the other contracting party to relief therefrom.

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

423

The breach caused by private respondent was even aggravated
by the consequent diversion of trade from the business of petitioner to that of private respondent caused by the latter’s species
of unfair competition as demonstrated no less by the sales effected
inspite of this Court’s restraining order.’’
(3) Injury to Y irreparable without immediate reasonable redress.
— “This brings Us to the irreparable mischief which respondent
court misappreciated when it refused to grant the relief simply
because of the observation that petitioner can be fully compensated for the damage. A contrario, the injury is irreparable where
it is continuous and repeated since from its constant and frequent
recurrence, no fair and reasonable redress can be had therefor
by petitioner insofar as his goodwill and business reputation as
sole distributor are concerned. Withal, to expect petitioner to file
a complaint for every sale effected by private respondent will
certainly court multiplicity of suits.’’ (Yu vs. Court of Appeals, 217
SCRA 328 [1993].)

4. Interference with a contract of lease was motivated by interferer’s own financial or economic interest, rather than by wrongful and
malicious motives.
Facts: R, lessor, sent a letter to E, lessee, informing the latter
of a 50% increase in rent, enclosing in the letter new lease contracts for signing. R warned that failure of E to accomplish the
contracts shall be deemed as lack of interest on the lessee’s part
and agreement to the termination of the lease. E did not answer
the letter, but the lease contracts were not rescinded.

T, petitioner, requested formal contracts of lease with R for
his own textile business, TM. The lease contracts in favor of TM
were executed.
In the suit for injunction, E pressed for the nullification of the
lease contracts between R and T. E also claimed damages.
Issue: Is T guilty of tortious interference with contract and
liable for attorney’s fees.

Held: Yes. “The foregoing issues involve, essentially, the correct
interpretation of the applicable law on tortious conduct, particularly
unlawful interference with contract. We have to begin, obviously,
with certain fundamental principles on torts and damages.’’
(1) Liability for a non-trespassory invasion of another’s property.

424

TORTS

Art. 1314

— “Damage is the loss, hurt, or harm which results from injury,
and damages are the recompense or compensation awarded for
the damage suffered. One becomes liable in an action for damages
for a non-trespassory invasion of another’s interest in the private
use and enjoyment of asset if: (a) the other has property rights and
privileges with respect to the use or enjoyment interfered with, (b)
the invasion is substantial, (c) the defendant’s conduct is a legal
cause of the invasion, and (d) the invasion is either intentional
and unreasonable or unintentional and actionable under general
negligence rules.’’

(2) Elements of tort interference. — “The elements of tort interference are: (1) existence of a valid contract; (2) knowledge on
the part of the third person of the existence of contract; and (3)
interference of the third person is without legal justification or
excuse.’’
(3) Elements are present. — “A duty which the law of torts is
concerned with is respect for the property of others, and a cause
of action ex delicto may be predicated upon an unlawful interference by one person of the enjoyment by the other of his private
property. This may pertain to a situation where a third person
induces a party to renege on or violate his undertaking under a
contract. In the case before us, petitioner TM asked R to execute
lease contracts in its favor, and as a result, petitioner deprived E
corporation of the latter’s property right. Clearly, and as correctly
viewed by the appellate court, the three elements of tort interference above-mentioned are present in the instant case.’’

(4) Justification for interference. — “Authorities debate on
whether interference may be justified where the defendant acts
for the sole purpose of furthering his own financial or economic
interest. One view is that, as a general rule, justification for interfering with the business relations of another exists where the
actor’s motive is to benefit himself. Such justification does not
exist where his sole motive is to cause harm to the other. Added
to this, some authorities believe that it is not necessary that the
interferer’s interest outweigh that of the party whose rights are
invaded, and that an individual acts under an economic interest
that is substantial, not merely de minimis, such that wrongful and
malicious motives are negatived, for he acts in self-protection.
Moreover, justification for protecting one’s financial position
should not be made to depend on a comparison of his economic
interest in the subject matter with that of others. It is sufficient if

Art. 1314

TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH
CONTRACTUAL RELATIONS

425

the impetus of his conduct lies in a proper business interest rather
than in wrongful motives.

As early as Gilchrist vs. Cuddy (29 Phil. 542, 549 [1915].), we
held that where there was no malice in the interference of a
contract, and the impulse behind one’s conduct lies in a proper
business interest rather than in wrongful motives, a party cannot
be a malicious interferer. Where the alleged interferer is financially
interested, and such interest motivates his conduct, it cannot be
said that he is an officious or malicious intermeddler.’’
(5) Extent for damages. — “In the instant case, it is clear that
petitioner T prevailed upon R, to lease the warehouse to his enterprise at the expense of E. Though petitioner took interest in the
property of respondent corporation and benefited from it, nothing
on record imputes deliberate wrongful motives or malice on him.

Article 1314 of the Civil Code categorically provides also that,
‘Any third person who induces another to violate his contract shall
be liable for damages to the other contracting party.’ Petitioner
argues that damage is an essential element of tort interference,
and since the trial court and the appellate court ruled that private respondents were not entitled to actual, moral or exemplary
damages, it follows that he ought to be absolved of any liability,
including attorney’s fees.
It is true that the lower courts did not award damages, but
this was only because the extent of damages was not quantifiable.
We had a similar situation in Gilchrist, where it was difficult or
impossible to determine the extent of damage and there was nothing on record to serve as basis thereof. In that case we refrained
from awarding damages. We believe the same conclusion applies
in this case.’’

(6) Liability for damages. — “While we do not encourage tort
interferers seeking their economic interest to intrude into existing
contracts at the expense of others, however, we find that the conduct
herein complained of did not transcend the limits forbidding an
obligatory award for damages in the absence of any malice. The
business desire is there to make some gain to the detriment of the
contracting parties. Lack of malice, however, precludes damages.
But it does not relieve petitioner of the legal liability for entering
into contracts and causing breach of existing ones.
The respondent appellate court correctly confirmed the permanent injunction and nullification of the lease contracts between
R and TM, without awarding damages. The injunction saved the

426

TORTS

Art. 1314

respondents from further damage or injury caused by petitioner’s
interference.’’

(7) Liability for attorney’s fees. — “Lastly, the recovery of attorney’s fees in the concept of actual or compensatory damages,
is allowed under the circumstances provided for in Article 2208
of the Civil Code. One such occasion is when the defendant’s
act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third
persons or to incur expenses to protect his interest. But we have
consistently held that the award of considerable damages should
have clear factual and legal bases. x x x

Considering that the respondent corporation’s lease contract,
at the time when the cause of action accrued, ran only on a month
to month basis whence before it was on a yearly basis, we find
even the reduced amount of attorney’s fees ordered by the Court
of Appeals still exorbitant in the light of prevailing jurisprudence.
Consequently, the amount of two hundred thousand (P200,000.00)
awarded by respondent appellate court should be reduced to one
hundred thousand (P100,000.00) pesos as the reasonable award for
attorney’s fees in favor of E.’’ (So Ping Bun vs. Court of Appeals,
314 SCRA 751 [1999].)

Chapter 8
OTHER ACTIONABLE WRONGS
Concurrence of causes of action.
An act or omission may give rise to an action based on
law, contract, quasi-contract, delict, or quasi-delict. (Art.1 1157.)
(1) Cause of action based on fault or negligence. — A person may
incur liability for damages caused by his fault or negligence to
one with whom either he has a pre-existing contractual relation
or he has no contractual relationship.

(a) In contractual negligence (culpa contractual), there
is a pre-existing obligation, and the negligence is not the
source of the obligation, but merely an incident resulting
in its breach or non-fulfillment.
(b) In civil negligence (culpa aquiliana), there is no preexisting obligation, and the negligence itself is the direct
and independent source of the obligation of the party guilty
thereof. It is also called “tort’’ or “quasi-delict.’’
(c) The negligence is criminal (culpa criminal) if it results
in the commission of a crime.

(2) Different causes of action based on the same act or omission.
— A pre-existing contractual relation between the parties does
not, however, preclude the existence of culpa aquiliana, or even
culpa criminal based on the same act or omission.
(3) Tort arising from breach of contract. — A quasi-delict can
be the cause for breaching a contract that might thereby permit the application of principles applicable to tort even when
Unless otherwise indicated, refers to article in the Civil Code.

427

428

TORTS

there is a pre-existing contract between the plaintiff and the
defendant. This rule can govern only where the act or omission
complained of would constitute an actionable tort independently
of the contract.2 (Far East Bank and Trust Company vs. Court
of Appeals, 241 SCRA 671 [1995].)
(4) Test for application of quasi-delict provisions. — The test
(whether a quasi-delict can be deemed to underlie the breach
of a contract) can be stated thusly: “Where, without a preexisting contract between the parties, an act or omission can
nonetheless amount to an actionable tort by itself, the fact that
the parties are contractually bound is no bar to the application
of the quasi-delict provisions to the case.’’ (Ibid.)

(5) Where breach of contract with malice or bad faith. — In
culpa contractual, moral damages may be recovered where the
“defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith’’ in the breach
of the contract. (Art. 2220.) Bad faith, in this context includes
gross but not simple, negligence. Malice or bad faith, as distinguished from negligence which imports a lack of intent, implies
a conscious and intentional design to do a wrongful act. The
negligence, however, may be so gross that it amounts to malice
or bad faith.
Accordingly, where the negligence does not amount to bad
faith, and the damage claim is predicated solely on a contractual
relationship, the act or omission complained of cannot by itself
be held to stand as an independent actionable tort. But where the
evidence showns that the breach of contract was attended with
malice or bad faith or with inexcusable neglect or malfeasance,
there is a case of quasi-delict which may be made the basis for
an award of damages under Articles 20 and 21. (Chap. 4.)
As explained in Air France vs. Carrascoso (18 SCRA 155
[1996].), involving the violation by a common carrier of its
contract of air-carriage:

“A contract to transport passengers is quite different in
kind and degree from any other contractual relation. And
this, because of the relation which an air-carrier sustains with
See discussions on this topic in Chaps. 1 and 2, and under Article 2178, Chap. 6.

OTHER ACTIONABLE WRONGS

429

the public. Its business is mainly with the travelling public.
It invites people to avail of the comforts and advantages it
offers. The contract of air carriage, therefore, generates a
relation attended with a public duty. Neglect or malfeasance
of the carrier’s employees, naturally, could give ground for
an action for damages.
Passengers do not contract merely for transportation.
They have a right to be treated by the carrier’s employees
with kindness, respect, courtesy and due consideration. They
are entitled to be protected against personal misconduct,
injurious language, indignities and abuses from such employees. So it is, that any rude or discourteous conduct on
the part of employees towards a passenger gives the latter
an action for damages against the carrier.
Thus:

‘Where a steamship company had accepted a passenger’s check, it was a breach of contract and a tort, giving
a right of action for its agent in the presence of third
persons to falsely notify her that the check was worthless
and demand payment under threat of ejection, though the
language used was not insulting and she was not ejected.
And this, because, although the relation of passenger and
carrier is ‘contractual both in origin and nature’ nevertheless ‘the act that breaks the contract may be also a tort.’
And in another case:

‘Where a passenger on a railroad train, when the
conductor came to collect his fare, tendered him the
cash fare to a point where the train was scheduled not
to stop, and told him that as soon as the train reached
such point he would pay the cash fare from that point
to destination, there was nothing in the conduct of the
passenger which justified the conductor in using insulting language to him, as by calling him a lunatic, and the
Supreme Court of South Carolina there held the carrier
is liable for the mental suffering of said passenger.’

Petitioner’s contract with Carrascoso is one attended with
public duty. The stress of Carrascoso’s action as we have said,

430

TORTS

Arts. 429, 431-432

is placed upon his wrongful expulsion. This is a violation of
public duty by the petitioner-air carrier — a case of quasidelict. Damages are proper.”
Article 429. The owner or lawful possessor of a
thing has the right to exclude any person from the
enjoyment and disposal thereof. For this purpose, he
may use such force as may be reasonably necessary
to repel or prevent an actual or threatened unlawful
physical invasion or usurpation of his property.
Art. 431. The owner of a thing cannot make use
thereof in such manner as to injure the rights of a
third person.
Art. 432. The owner of a thing has no right to
prohibit the interference of another with the same,
if the interference is necessary to avert an imminent
danger and the threatened damage, compared to the
damage arising to the owner from the interference,
is much greater. The owner may demand from the
person benefited indemnity for the damage to him.
Liability of the owner or lawful
possessor of a thing.
(1) Principle of self-help. — Article 429 “embodies the doctrine
of self-help which is found in the German Civil Code, with the
limitation that the owner may use only such force as may be
reasonably necessary. The right to repel or prevent an actual
or threatened physical invasion or usurpation of property is
essential to the maintenance of property rights.’’ (Report of the
Code Commission, p. 95.)

The owner or lawful possessor must use only such force as
may be reasonably necessary to repel or prevent an invasion
or usurpation of his property; otherwise, he shall be liable for
damages. The doctrine of self-help can only be exercised at the
time of an actual or threatened dispossession (German Management & Services v. Court of Appeals, 177 SCRA 495 [1989].),
or immediately after the dispossession to regain posession (e.g.,

Art. 447

OTHER ACTIONABLE WRONGS
Property

431

running after a snatcher and using force to recover the thing
stolen). Once delay has taken place, even if excusable, the
owner or lawful possessor must resort to judicial process for
the recovery of the property (Arts. 433, 536.) for he is no longer
justified in taking the law into his own hands.
The principle of self-defense in the Revised Penal Code covers not only defense of a man’s person but also extends to his
rights, including the right of property. One of the elements of
self-defense is that the means employed must be reasonable.’’
(see Art. II[1], Revised Penal Code.)

(2) Obligation to respect the rights of others. — Article 431 is
self-explanatory. It is based on the police power of the State
expressed in the Latin maxim: sic utere tuo ut alienum non laidas.
It is particularly useful when dealing with nuisances. (Chap. 5.)
(3) Obligation permit interference under certain conditions. — As
a rule, a person cannot interfere with the right of ownership
of another. By way of exception, Article 432 allows interference
with another’s property under certain conditions. (Report of
the Code Commission, p. 95.) It is based on what is known
as the state of necessity, a justifying circumstance recognized in
the Revised Penal Code but which does not also exempt the
offender from civil liability.
It likewise embodies the principle of the “the least evil’’ rule,
i.e., that as between two evils, one is justified in choosing the
lesser evil. Article 432 is an exception to Article 429.
Art. 447. The owner of the land who makes
thereon, personally or through another, plantings,
constructions or works with the materials of another,
shall pay their value; and, if he acted in bad faith, he
shall also be obliged to the reparation of damages.
The owner of the materials shall have the right to
remove them only in case he can do so without injury
to the work constructed, or without the plantings,
constructions or works being destroys. However, if
the landowner acted in bad faith, the owner of the
materials may remove them in any event, with a right

Liability of owner of land who used materials
of another in bad faith.
(1) If he acted in good faith, he becomes the owner of the
materials (accessory) but he shall pay their value. (see Art. 466.)
However, the owner of the materials can remove them if the
removal can be done without injury to the plantings, etc. for
in such case there is really no accession.

(2) If he acted in bad faith (see Arts. 453, 526.), he becomes
the owner of the materials but he shall be obliged:
1) to pay their value; and

2) in addition, to pay damages.

Furthermore, the owner of the materials may remove them
even if the removal may cause injury to the plantings, etc. (see
Art. 470, par. 2.)
Liability of owner of materials who acted
in bad faith.
Article 447 applies when both the landowner and the owner
of the materials are in good faith and when the former is in
bad faith and the latter is in good faith. It is silent where the
latter is in bad faith.
(1) Where the landowner is in good faith and the owner
of materials is in bad faith, the latter would be liable for any
consequential damages without right of removal whether or
not injury would be caused.
(2) Where both parties are in bad faith, they shall both be
treated as being in good faith. (Art. 453.)
Art. 449. He who builds, plants or sows in bad
faith on the land of another, loses what is built,

land, and the sower the proper rent.
Art. 451. In the case of the two preceding articles, the landowner is entitled to damages from the
builder, planter or sower.
Art. 452. The builder, planter or sower in bad
faith is entitled to reimbursement for the necessary
expenses of preservation of the land.
Liability of builder, planter or sower
in bad faith on another’s land.
Based on the above provisions, the following are his liabilities:

(1) He loses what is built, planted, or sown without right
to indemnity except for necessary expenses;

(2) He may be required to remove or demolish the work,
etc. in order to replace things in their former condition at his
expense;
(3) He may be compelled to pay the price of the land, and
in the case of the sower, to pay the rent; and
(4) He is liable, as a further punishment for his bad faith,
for damages.

If there was bad faith, not only on the part of the person
who built, planted or sowed on the land of another, but also
on the part of the owner of such land, the rights of one and
the other shall be the same as though both had acted in good
faith. (Art. 453.) When the landowner acted in bad faith and the
builder, planter or sower proceeded in good faith, the provisions
of Article 447 shall apply. (Art. 454.)
In the above cases good faith does not necessarily exclude
negligence, which gives right to damages under Article 2176.

Art. 470. Whenever the owner of the accessory
thing has made the incorporation in bad faith, he

thing for the damages he may have suffered.
If the one who has acted in bad faith is the owner
of the principal thing, the owner of the accessory thing
shall have a right to choose between the former paying him its value or that the thing belonging to him be
separated, even though for this purpose it be necessary to destroy the principal thing; and in both cases,
furthermore, there shall be indemnity for damages.
If either one of the owners has made the incorporation with the knowledge and without the objection
of the other, their respective rights shall be determined as though both acted in good faith. (379a)
Liability of owner of accessory
incorporated in bad faith.
The following are tax rules:

(1) Bad faith on the part of owner of accessory:

(a) He shall lose the thing incorporated; and

(b) He shall be liable for damage to the owner of the
thing.
(2) Bad faith on the part of owner of principal:

(a) The owner of the accessory thing is given the option
either:

1) to require the owner of the principal thing to pay
the value of the accessory thing; or

2) to have the accessory thing separated even if
for the purpose it be necessary to destroy the principal
thing; and
(b) He shall be entitled to damages, in either case.

(3) Bad faith on the part of both. — Under the third paragraph,
their respective rights shall be determined as though both acted in
good faith. Article 453 should be applied. There is bad faith when
either one of the owners made the union with the knowledge and
without the objection of the other. (see Art. 453, par. 2.)

article.
If the one who caused the mixture or confusion
acted in bad faith, he shall lose the thing belonging to him thus mixed or confused, besides being
obliged to pay indemnity for the damages caused
to the owner of the thing with which his own was
mixed. (382)
Liability of owners of things mixed
in bad faith.
(1) Mixture caused by an owner in good faith or by chance. —
The share of each owner shall also be proportional to the value
of the part which belonged to him. (see Art. 413, par. 1.) The
rule is different in cases of accession which give to the owner
of the principal, right over the accessory. (see Art. 440.) Strictly
speaking, there is no accession in mixture since there is neither
a principal nor an accessory.

(a) If the things mixed are exactly of the same kind
and quality, there is no conflict of rights; all that is needed
would be to divide the mixture equally or proportionately,
as the case may be, between the different owners.

(b) Co-ownership arises when the things mixed are of
different kinds or quality. Nevertheless, if the things mixed
can be separated without injury, their respective owners may
demand their separation. The expenses incident to separation shall be borne by all the owners in proportion to their
respective interests in the mixture. (3 Manresa 299-300.)
Note that good faith does not necessarily exclude negligence
which gives right to damages. (Art. 456.)

(2) Mixture caused by an owner in bad faith. — The actor not
only forfeits the thing belonging to him but also becomes liable
to pay indemnity for the damages caused to the other owner.

Art. 474

(Art. 473, par. 2.)

(3) Mixture made with the knowledge and without the objection
of the other owner. — Applying the provisions of Article 470
(par. 3.) by analogy, their respective rights shall be determined
as though both acted in good faith.
Art. 474. One who in good faith employs the
material of another in whole or in part in order to
make a thing of a different kind, shall appropriate
the thing thus transformed as his own, indemnifying
the owner of the material for its value.
If the material is more precious than the transformed thing or is of more value, its owner may, at
his option, appropriate the new thing to himself, after
first paying indemnity for the value of the work, or
demand indemnity for the material.
If in the making of the thing bad faith intervened,
the owner of the material shall have the right to
appropriate the work to himself without paying anything to the maker, or to demand of the latter that
he indemnify him for the value of the material and
the damages he may have suffered. However, the
owner of the material cannot appropriate the work
in case the value of the latter, for artistic or scientific reasons, is considerably more than that of the
material. (383a)
Liability of user of another’s material
in bad faith.
The owner of the material has the option either to appropriate
the work to himself without paying the maker; or to demand
the value of the material plus damages. The first option is not
available in case the value of the work, for artistic or scientific
reasons, is considerably more than that of the material. (see Art.
448.) This exception prevents unjust enrichment of the owner
of the material at the expense of the maker. Here, the labor or
work is considered as the principal.

By way of illustration, a piece of canvas worth P100 may
have been used in bad faith in painting a masterpiece worth
P100,000. In such a case to allow the owner of the material to
appropriate the painting would be manifestly unjust and would
unduly enrich him at the expense of the painter. Or one’s material may have been used in good faith by a scientist in the
making of a new instrument of tremendous scientific value.
For the same reason, the owner of the material is not allowed to appropriate the thing apart from the consideration that
the country and the world in general may lose the benefit of
such instrument, if allowed to fall in the hands of an ignorant
owner of the material.
Art. 482. If a building, wall, column, or any other
construction is in danger of falling, the owner shall
be obliged to demolish it or to execute the necessary
work in order to prevent it from falling.
If the proprietor does not comply with this obligation, the administrative authorities may order the
demolition of the structure at the expense of the owner,
or take measures to insure public safety. (389a)
Art. 483. Whenever a large tree threatens to fall
in such a way as to cause damage to the land or
tenement of another or to travelers over a public or
private road, the owner of the tree shall be obliged
to fell and remove it; and should he not do so, it
shall be done at his expense by order of the administrative authorities.
Liability of owner of building, etc. or large tree
in danger of falling.
(1) Under Article 482, the owner has the duty to demolish
a building, etc. in danger of falling or to repair the same in
order to prevent it from falling. In case he fails to do so, the
administrative authorities, in the exercise of police power (see
Art. 436.), may order the demolition of the structure, or when
demolition is not necessary, take measures to insure public
safety.

(2) The police power of the State includes the power to
abate a nuisance per se or per accidens. Ruinous buildings and
trees in danger of falling are nuisances per se. (see Chap. 5.)
Art. 549. The possessor in bad faith shall reimburse the fruits received and those which the legitimate possessor could have received, and shall have
a right only to the expenses mentioned in paragraph
1 of article 546 and in article 443. The expenses
incurred in improvements for pure luxury or mere
pleasure shall not be refunded to the possessor in
bad faith; but he may remove the objects for which
such expenses have been incurred, provided that the
thing suffers no injury thereby, and that the lawful
possessor does not prefer to retain them by paying
the value they may have at the time he enters into
possession. (455a)
Art. 552. A possessor in good faith shall not be
liable for the deterioration or loss of the thing possessed, except in cases in which it is proved that
he has acted with fraudulent intent or negligence,
after the judicial summons.
A possessor in bad faith shall be liable for deterioration or loss in every case, even if caused by
a fortuitous event. (457a)
Liability of possessor in bad faith.
His rights and liabilities may be summarized as follows.
(1) Fruits. — He is not entitled to the fruits.

(a) He must reimburse the value of fruits received subject
to Article 443;
(b) He has no right whatsoever with respect to pending
fruits (Art. 449.); and

(c) He must reimburse the value of fruits which the

Arts. 589-590

Property

439

legitimate possessor could have received subject to Article
443.

(2) Necessary expenses. — He is only entitled to reimbursement without a right of retention. (Art. 546, par. 1; see Art. 443.)

(3) Useful expenses. — He is not entitled to refund (Art. 546,
par. 2.) and forfeits the improvements. (Art. 449.) The law does
not give him the right of removal.

(4) Luxurious expenses. — Likewise, he is not entitled to
refund. He loses the improvements but he is granted the limited right of removal, i.e., he may remove them if it is possible
without injury to the principal thing and the lawful possessor
does not exercise his option.
(5) Charges. — He shall share them with the owner or lawful possessor in proportion to the time of their possession. (Art.
545, pars. 1, 2.)
(6) Deterioration or loss. — He is always liable, whether due
to his fault or negligence, or due to a fortuitous event. (Art.
552.)
(7) Others. — He is liable to the owner or lawful possessor for an amount equal to a reasonable rent for the use and
occupation of the property. (Lerma v. De la Cruz, 7 Phil. 581
[1907].) He is likewise liable for any other damage caused to
the property or suffered by the lawful possessor arising from
the possession. (see Arts. 20, 21, Chap. 4; Art. 2176, Chap. 6.)
Art. 589. The usufructuary shall take care of the
things given in usufruct as a good father of a family.
(497)
Art. 590. A usufructuary who alienates or leases his
right of usufruct shall answer for any damage which
the things in usufruct may suffer through the fault or
negligence of the person who substitutes him. (498)
Liability of usufructuary.

(1) For his fault or negligence. — The care required is that of
a good father of a family which means that the usufructuary
should exercise that same diligence over the property in usufruct which he would exercise over his own. But that diligence

440

TORTS

Art. 601

should not be less than that required by the circumstances. (see
Art. 1173.) The usufructuary is liable for damages suffered by
the property due to his fault and negligence.

(2) For fault of negligence of substitute. — The usufructuary is
the owner of the right of usufruct. He may, therefore, alienate
or lease his right. (Art. 572.) However, the usufructuary shall
be liable to the owner for any damage which the property in
usufruct may suffer through the fault or negligence (also fraud
or willful acts) of the substitute without prejudice to his right
of action against the latter.

(3) For failure to notify owner of prejudicial acts by third persons.
— Article 601 speaks of any act which may be prejudicial to the
“rights of ownership,’’ not merely of the “naked ownership.’’
It may well be that an act is prejudicial alone to the usufructuary as where only the right of usufruct as a right personal
to him is involved in which case he is under no obligation to
give the notice required. However, where the act affects possession, although this is in the usufructuary, he should notify
the owner because the latter has an interest in defending it.
The usufruct will ultimately revert to the owner, and injury to
the usufructuary’s possession will also result in injury to the
right of ownership.
Art. 601. The usufructuary shall be obliged to
notify the owner of any act of a third person, of
which he may have knowledge, that may be prejudicial to the rights of ownership, and he shall be
liable should he not do so, for damages, as if they
had been caused through his own fault. (511)
Liability of usufructuary to owner for prejudicial
acts by third persons.
Article 601 speaks of any act which may be prejudicial to the
“rights of ownership,’’ not merely of the “naked ownership.’’

It may well be that an act is prejudicial alone to the usufructuary as where only the right of usufruct as a right personal
to him is involved in which case he is under no obligation to

Art. 637

Property

441

give the notice required. However, where the act affects possession, although this is in the usufructuary, he should notify
the owner because the latter has an interest in defending it.
The usufruct will ultimately revert to the owner, and injury to
the usufructuary’s possession will also result in injury to the
right of ownership.
Art. 637. Lower estates are obliged to receive the
waters which naturally and without the intervention
of man descend from the higher estates, as well as
the stones or earth which they carry with them.
The owner of the lower estate cannot construct
works which will impede this easement; neither can
the owner of the higher estate make works which
will increase the burden. (552)
Liability of owner of higher estate.
Lower estates are obliged to receive the waters which
naturally and without the intervention of man (not waters, for
example, from reservoirs or tanks) descend from the higher
estates, as well as the stones or earth carried by the waters.

(1) The owner of the lower estate cannot construct works,
which will impede this easement, such as walls, ditches or
fences, or a dam which block the natural flow of the waters.
(2) The owner of the higher tenement cannot make works
which will increase the burden. If the waters are the result of
artificial development, or are the overflow from irrigation dams,
or proceed from industrial establishments recently set up, the
owner of the lower estate shall be entitled to compensation for
his loss or damage.
In a case, liability for damages was imposed on the owner
of piggery farm for negligence in allowing the waste water containing pig manure to flood his neighbor’s property which was
practically made a catch-basin of the polluted water resulting
in the impairment of the productivity of the latter’s land and
death of several fruit trees. (Remman Enterprise, Inc. vs. Court
of Appeals, 330 SCRA 145 [2000].)

Arts. 682-684

Art. 682. Every building or piece of land is subject to the easement which prohibits the proprietor
or possessor from committing nuisance through
noise, jarring, offensive odor, smoke, heat, dust,
water, glare and other causes.
Art. 683. Subject to zoning, health, police and
other laws and regulations, factories and shops may
be maintained provided the least possible annoyance
is caused to the neighborhood.
Liability of proprietor or possessor of land
or building for nuisance.
According to the Code Commission, the easement against
nuisance and the one of lateral and subjacent support are both
taken from American law. Commenting on Article 682, it states:
“This easement is created by law and is inherent in every land.
It is a proper limitation upon ownership, as the easements of
distances and light and view. It is a manifestation of the principle that every person should so use his property as not to
cause damage or injury to others.’’ (Report of the Code Commission, p. 51.)
A nuisance (Chap. 5.) involves any act or omission which
is unlawful. (see Art. 694.) Articles 682 and 683 are more of a
restriction on the right of ownership than a true easement.
Art. 684. No proprietor shall make such excavations upon his land as to deprive any adjacent land
or building of sufficient lateral or subjacent support.
Liability of proprietor making excavations
upon his land.
An owner, by virtue of his surface right, may make excavations on his land (Art. 437.) but his right is subject to the limitation in Article 684 that he shall not deprive any adjacent land
or building of sufficient lateral or subjacent support. Between
adjacent landowners, each has an absolute property right to
have his land laterally supported by the soil of his neighbor

Arts. 1388, 1390

OTHER ACTIONABLE WRONGS
Contracts

443

and if either in excavating on his own premises so disturbs
the lateral support of his neighbor’s land as to cause it, in its
natural state, by the pressure of its own weight, to fall away or
slide from its position, the one so excavating is liable.
The proprietor intending to make any excavations is mandated to notify to all owners of adjacent lands (Art. 687.) who
are entitled to injunctive relief and to damages when proper
under the circumstances.
Art. 1388. Whoever acquires in bad faith the things
alienated in fraud or creditors, shall indemnify the
latter for damages suffered by them on account of
the alienation, whenever, due to any cause, it should
be impossible for him to return them.
If there are two or more alienations, the first acquirer shall be liable first, and so on successively.
(1298a)
Liability of purchaser in bad faith of things
alienated in fraud of creditors.
The purchaser in bad faith, who acquired the object of the
contract alienated in fraud of creditors, must return the same
if the sale is rescinded (see Art. 1383.) and should it be impossible for him to return it due to any cause, he must indemnify
the former.
Should there be two or more alienations, the first acquirer
shall be liable first, and so on successively.
Art. 1390. The following contracts are voidable
or annullable, even though there may have been no
damage to the contracting parties:
(1) Those where one of the parties is incapable
of giving consent to a contract;
(2) Those where the consent is vitiated by mistake, violence, intimidation, undue influence or fraud.
These contracts are binding, unless they are

444

TORTS

Art. 1555

annulled by a proper action in court. They are susceptible of ratification. (n)
Liability of guilty party in a
voidable contract.
The party who exerted intimidation, violence, or under influence, or employed fraud, or caused mistake upon the other
contracting party can be held civilly liable for damages without
prejudice to possible criminal liability.

The guilty party, including his successors-in-interest, cannot
ask for annulment of the contract. This rule is consistent with
the principle that he who comes to court must come with clean
hands. Note that the contract is voidable even though there may
have been no damage to the innocent party.
Art. 1555. When the warranty has been agreed
upon or nothing has been stipulated on this point,
in case eviction occurs, the vendee shall have the
right to demand of the vendor:
(1) The return of the value which the thing sold
had at the time of the eviction, be it greater or less
than the price of the sale;
(2) The income or fruits, if he has been ordered
to deliver them to the party who won the suit against
him;
(3) The costs of the suit which caused the eviction, and, in a proper case, those of the suit brought
against the vendor for the warranty;
(4) The expenses of the contract, if the vendee
has paid them;
(5) The damages and interests, and ornamental
expenses, if the sale was made in bad faith. (1478)
Liability of vendor in bad faith
for eviction.
The right of the vendee to demand “damages and interests

Art. 1569

OTHER ACTIONABLE WRONGS
Sales

445

and ornamental expenses’’ is qualified by the condition that
the sale was made in bad faith. If good faith is presumed, the
vendee is not entitled to recover damages unless bad faith on
the part of the vendor is shown in making the sale.

The word “interests’’ does not cover interest on the purchase
price as in lieu thereof the vendee is entitled to the fruits of the
thing, and in cases he has been ordered by a court to deliver
the fruits to the successful party, the vendor must indemnify
him. (see No. 2.)
Art. 1569. If the thing sold had any hidden fault
at the time of the sale, and should thereafter be
lost by a fortuitous event or through the fault of the
vendee, the latter may demand of the vendor the
price which he paid, less the value which the thing
had when it was lost.
If the vendor acted in bad faith, he shall pay
damages to the vendee. (1488a)
Liability of vendor in bad faith in case
of loss of defective thing sold.
If the thing sold had no hidden defects, its loss through a
fortuitous event or through the fault of the vendee is, of course,
to be borne by the vendee. However, the vendor is obliged to
return the price paid less the value of the thing at the time of its
loss in case where hidden defects existed. In other words, under
Article 1569, the vendor is still made liable on his warranty.
The difference between the price paid for the thing and the
value at the time of the loss, represents the damage suffered
by the vendee and is at the same time the amount with which
the vendor enriched himself at the expense of the vendee. (10
Manresa 238.) If the vendor acted in bad faith, he shall also be
liable for damages.
Art. 1576. If the hidden defect of animals, even
in case a professional inspection has been made,
should be of such a nature that expert knowledge
is not sufficient to discover it, the defect shall be

446

TORTS

Arts. 1576, 1596

considered as redhibitory.
But if the veterinarian, through ignorance or bad
faith, should fail to discover or disclose it, he shall
be liable for damages. (1495)
Liability of veterinarian in sale of animals
with redhibitory defect.
Article 1576 is a rule especially applicable to animals.

To be considered redhibitory, the defect must not only be
hidden. It must be of such a nature that expert knowledge is
not sufficient to discover it. However, if the veterinarian failed
to discover it through his ignorance, or failed to disclose it to
the vendee through bad faith, he shall be liable for damages.
The responsibility is his and not the vendor’s.
Art. 1596. Where the buyer wrongfully neglects or
refuses to accept and pay for the goods, the seller
may maintain an action against him for damages for
non-acceptance.
The measure of damages is the estimated loss
directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course
of events, from the buyer’s breach of contract.
Where there is an available market for the goods
in question, the measure of damages is, in the absence of special circumstances showing proximate
damage of a different amount, the difference between
the contract price and the market or current price
at the time or times when the goods ought to have
been accepted, or, if no time was fixed for acceptance, then at time of the refusal to accept.
If, while labor or expense of material amount is
necessary on the part of the seller to enable him to
fulfill his obligations under the contract of sale, the
buyer repudiates the contract or notifies the seller to
proceed no further therewith, the buyer shall be liable
to the seller for labor performed or expenses made

Art. 1596

OTHER ACTIONABLE WRONGS
Sales

447

before receiving notice of the buyer’s repudiation or
countermand. The profit the seller would have made
if the contract or the sale had been fully performed
shall be considered in awarding the damages. (n)
Liability of buyer who wrongfully
violates contract.
(1) Seller’s right of action for damages.

(a) If the buyer without lawful cause neglects or refuses
to accept and pay for the goods he agreed to buy, the seller
may maintain an action against him for damages for nonacceptance. (par. 1.)
(b) In an executory contract, where the ownership in
the goods has not passed, and the seller cannot maintain
an action to recover the price (see Art. 1595.), the seller’s
remedy will be also an action for damages.

(c) If the goods are not yet identified at the time of the
contract or subsequently, the seller’s right is necessarily
confined to an action for damages.

(2) Measure of damages for non-acceptance. — The measure of
damage is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting from
the buyer’s breach of contract. It is conveniently expressed by
the formula — the difference between the contract price, that is,
the amount of the obligation which the buyer failed to fulfill,
and the market or current price, that is, the value of the goods
which the seller has left upon his hands. (see Siuliong & Co.
vs. Nanyo Shoji Kaisha, 42 Phil. 722 [1922]; Warner Barnes &
Co. vs. Inza, 43 Phil. 505 [1922].) This follows the general rule
that damages comprehend not only the actual loss suffered but
also unrealized profit. (Art. 2200.)
(3) Proximate damages. — Article 1596 (par. 3.) allows the
seller under “special circumstances” proximate damages of a
greater amount than the difference between the contract price
and market price when such damages “may be reasonably attributed to the non-performance of the obligation.” (see Art.
2201, par. 2.)
(4) Measure of damages for repudiation or countermand. — In

448

TORTS

Art. 1628

case the buyer repudiates the contract or notifies the seller to
proceed no further therewith, the measure of damages to which
the seller is entitled would include:
(a) the labor performed and expenses incurred for materials before receiving notice of the buyer’s repudiation; and
(b) the profit he would have realized if the sale had been
fully performed. (Art. 1596, par. 4.)
Art. 1628. The vendor in good faith shall be responsible for the existence and legality of the credit
at the time of the sale, unless it should have been
sold as doubtful; but not for the solvency of the
debtor, unless it has been so expressly stipulated
or unless the insolvency was prior to the sale and
of common knowledge.
Even in these cases he shall only be liable for
the price received and for the expenses specified in
No. 1 of Article 1616.
The vendor in bad faith shall always be answerable for the payment of all expenses, and for damages. (1529)
Liability of assignor of credit
in bad faith.
(1) For violation of the above warranties, the liability of
the vendor (assignor) in good faith is limited only to the price
received and to the expenses of the contract, and any other
legitimate payments by reason of the assignment. (Art. 1616,
par. 1.)

(2) The assignor in bad faith is liable not only for the payment of the price and all expenses, but also for damages. An
assignor in bad faith is one who has knowledge of any of the
circumstances mentioned above (i.e., non-existence or illegality
of the credit, insolvency of the debtor, etc.) while an assignor in
good faith is one who is ignorant of them.
Art. 1667. The lessee is responsible for the

Arts. 1667-1668, 1694

OTHER ACTIONABLE WRONGS
Lease of Lands/Contract of Labor

449

deterioration or loss of the thing leased, unless
he proves that it took place without his fault. This
burden of proof on the lessee does not apply when
the destruction is due to earthquake, flood, storm
or other natural calamity. (1563a)
Art. 1668. The lessee is liable for any deterioration caused by members of his household and by
guests and visitors. (1564a)
Liability of lessee for deterioration or loss
of the thing leased.
It is presumed that the lessee received the thing leased
in good condition, unless there is proof to the contrary. (Art.
1666.); hence, he is made responsible for the deterioration or
loss of the thing leased. The burden is upon him to prove that
the same took place without his fault. This burden is shifted
to the lessor when the destruction is due to a natural calamity.

If the deterioration is caused by others, Article 1668 makes
the lessee liable whether or not he is at fault. The lessee is
supposed to be in control of the property leased. His liability,
however, is without prejudice to his right to recover from whoever is responsible for the deterioration.
Art. 1694. The head of the family shall treat the
house helper in a just and humane manner. In no
case shall physical violence be used upon the house
helper.
Liability of head of family to house helper.
It is the duty of the head of the family to treat his/her
housekeeper in a just and human manner. A househelper, like
any other human being, is entitled to be respected in his dignity,
personality and other rights. (see Arts. 19, 20, 21, 26, Chap. 4.)
The use of physical violence can give rise to civil liability
for damages as well as criminal liability. (see Art. 33, Ibid.)

“The domestic servants in the Philippines have not, as

450

TORTS

Arts. 1711-1712

a general rule, been fairly treated. Social justice is to be
measured by the manner in which the humblest servant is
dealt with, for no social system can rise above its lowliest
class any more than a chain is stronger than its weakest link.
Consequently, under the heading of ‘Household Service,’
there are provisions to strengthen the rights of domestic
servants.’’ (Report of the Code Commission, p. 15.)
Art. 1711. Owners of enterprises and other employers are obliged to pay compensation for the
death of or injuries to their laborers, workmen, mechanics or other employees even though the event
may have been purely accidental or entirely due to
a fortuitous cause, if the death or personal injury
arose out of and in the course of the employment.
The employer is also liable for compensation if the
employee contracts any illness or disease caused
by such employment or as the result of the nature
of the employment. If the mishap was due to the
employee’s own notorious negligence, or voluntary
act, or drunkenness, the employer shall not be liable for compensation. When the employee’s lack
of due care contributed to his death or injury, the
compensation shall be equitably reduced.
Art. 1712. If the death or injury is due to the
negligence of a fellow-worker, the latter and the employer shall be solidarily liable for compensation. If
a fellow-worker’s intentional or malicious act is the
only cause of the death or injury, the employer shall
not be answerable, unless it should be shown that
the latter did not exercise due diligence in the selection or supervision of the plaintiff’s fellow-worker.
Liability of employers for death, etc. of their
laborers, etc.
The present articles modified existing laws on compensation of laborers for accident or illness so as to extend better
protection to the laborer. “The safety and the decent living

of the toiling classes do not affect them alone but are matters
of deep and immediate concern to the entire nation. When in
any nation, a large section of the inhabitants are not afforded
a safe and decent life, the economic progress of the country is
impeded, and the level of general well-being is pulled down.
(Ibid., pp. 13-14.)
(1) Liability to pay compensation. — Owners of enterprises
and other employers are liable to pay compensation for:

(a) the death of, or personal injuries to, their laborers,
etc. arising out of and in the course of their employment;
or
(b) any illness or disease caused by such employment
or as a result of the nature of the employment.

(2) Enterprises covered. — Article 1711 makes no distinction
between the kinds of enterprises; hence, it applies to all industrial
and non-industrial enterprises (commercial and agricultural), as
well as to religious, charitable and educational institution.

(3) Defenses. — That the death or injury may have been
purely accidental or entirely due to fortuitous event is not
available to the employer as a defense. The employee will not
be entitled to compensation if the cause of the mishap is: (a)
the employee’s own notorious negligence; (b) voluntary act to
kill himself or to inflict such injury; or (c) drunkenness.
(a) A bus inspector riding on the left running board while
inspecting tickets of its passengers was held not notoriously
negligent. (Gevero vs. Mindanao Bus Company [C.A], G.R.
No. 7434-12, April 5, 1953].)

(b) Failure to avoid a known danger by a laborer engrossed in his work who momentarily forgets it is not
negligence. (Ibid., citing Flores vs. Mindanao Lumber Co.,
Inc., G.R. No. 43096, May 22, 1936.)
(c) But an experienced laborer, who worked after a
rain on a roof the sheets of which have not yet been nailed
down and because of his own weight, the angle of the roof,
and the slippery condition of the roof, the sheet slid to the
ground, taking him with it. As a result of the accident, he
died. His negligence falls under the designation of evident

452

Arts. 1711-1212

and manifest, or notorious negligence. (Caunan v. Compania
General de Tobaccos, 56 Phil. 542 [1932].)
Contributory negligence of the employee only mitigates the
right to compensation which shall be equitably reduced.

(4) “Arising out of’’ and “in the course of employment’’ defined. —
The first words refer to the origin or cause of the accident, and
are descriptive of its character, while the second, refer to the time,
place, and circumstances under which the accident take place.
By the use of these words, however, it was not the intention
of the legislature to make the employer an insurer against all
accidental injuries which might happen to an employee while
in the course of the employment, but only for such injuries
arising from or growing out of the risks peculiar to the nature
of the work in the scope of the workman’s employment or
incidental to such employment, and accidents in which it is
possible to trace the injury to some risk or hazard to which
the employee is exposed in a special degree by reason of such
employment. Risks to which all persons similarly situated are
equally exposed and not traceable in some special degree to the
particular employment are excluded. (Afable vs. Singer Sewing
Machine Co., 58 Phil. 39 [1933].)
(a) A bus driver is right to compensation was upheld
notwithstanding that the accident occurred after his work
and while returning to his house. (Bohol Land Transportation Co. vs. Mandanguit, 70 Phil. 685 [1940], citing Pollisco
vs. Basidan Lumber Co., G.R. No. 39721.)
(b) In another case, it was held that the laborer of the City
of Manila who worked in the public streets was entitled to
compensation under the law, notwithstanding that he temporarily left his work and crossed the street, when he was run
over by an automobile which caused his immediate death.
In Corpus Juris, Vol. 71, p. 673, we find the following. “*
* * where the employee is injured while seeking toilet facilities or going to or from a toilet, the injury arises out of the
employment and in the course of it.’’ (Ibid., citing Bellosillo
vs. City of Manila, G.R. No. 34522.)

(c) In Bohol (supra.), according to the facts found by the
Court of Appeals, M, the deceased, was the driver of one of

Arts. 1711-1712

OTHER ACTIONABLE WRONGS
Lease of Lands/Contract of Labor

the buses of the petitioner Bohol Land Transportation Co.,
and while riding said bus, it hit the bicycle mounted by C;
that moments later, almost immediately, M stopped the bus
as he received signs from some pedestrians who wanted to
board the bus, and taking advantage of this opportunity, he
alighted therefrom and went to a drug store for the purpose
of cleaning his hands which were soiled in cleaning the bus.
In the meantime, C arrived and entered the drug store
and suddenly stabbed M who died instantaneously. His
death was due to and in pursuance of his employment.

(d) In Afable (supra.), M was a collector of SSM in the
district of San Francisco del Monte, outside of the limits
of the City of Manila. While riding a bicycle one Sunday
afternoon, he was run over fatally injured at the corner of
O’Donnell and Zurbaran in the City of Manila by a truck.
The accident which caused the death of M was not due to
and in pursuance of his employment. At the time that he
was run over by the truck, M was not in the pursuance of
his employment with defendant corporation, but was on his
way home after he finished his work for the day and had
left the territory he was authorized to make collections for
the defendant.
The employer is not an insurer ‘against all accidental injuries that might happen to an employee while in the course
of the employment,’ and, as a general rule, an employee is
not entitled to recover from personal injuries resulting from
an accident that befalls him while going to or returning from
his place of employment, because such an accident does not
arise out of and in the course of his employment.’’
Where death or injury caused by a fellow worker.
(1) If due to the negligence of a fellow-worker, the employer
and the fellow-worker are made solidarily liable. Similarly,
common carriers are liable for the death of, or injuries to, passengers through the negligence or willful acts of the former’s
employees. (Art. 1759.)
Article 1712 does not adopt the doctrine known as “fellow-

454

TORTS

Arts. 1711-1712

servant rule’’ which exempts from liability an employer where
the injury was caused through the negligence of a fellow-servant
or employee. (see Rakes vs. Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Co., 7
Phil. 358 [1907].)
(2) If the only cause is the fellow-worker’s intentional or
malicious act, the employer shall be answerable, unless it should
be shown that the latter did not exercise due diligence in the
selection or supervision of the plaintiff fellow-worker. In an action for damages against an employer based on a quasi-delict
(Art. 2176.) committed by his employee, the employer may
raise the defense of diligence of a good father of a family. (Art.
2180, last par.) The exercise of due diligence is presumed. The
diligence employed by a common carrier in the selection and
supervision of its employees is not, however, a defense. (Art.
1759, par. 2.) Such defense is not available in culpa contractual
nor in criminal negligence. (see Art. 103, Revised Penal Code.)
If the death or personal injury arose out of and in the course
of employment, the employer is liable under Article 1711. But
if the fellow-worker’s intentional or malicious act is the only
cause of death, the employer is only liable if it be proved that
the employer failed to “exercise due diligence in the selection
or supervision of the plaintiff’s fellow-worker.’’
Note: The Labor Code of the Philippines (Pres. Decree No.
442, as amended.) provides for a tax-exempt employee’s compensation program whereby employees and their dependents, in
the event of work-connected disability or death, may promptly
secure adequate income benefits, and medical or related benefits. (Art. 160 thereof.) The State Insurance Fund (SIF) shall
be liable for compensation to the employee or his dependents
except when the disability or death was occasioned by the employee’s intoxication, willful intention to injure or kill himself
or another, notorious negligence, or otherwise provided in the
Code. (Art. 172, Ibid.)
Art. 1723. The engineer or architect who drew up
the plans and specifications for a building is liable
for damages if within fifteen years from the completion of the structure, the same should collapse by

Art. 1723

reason of a defect in those plans and specifications,
or due to the defects in the ground. The contractor
is likewise responsible for the damages if the edifice
falls, within the same period, on account of defects
in the construction or the use of materials of inferior
quality furnished by him, or due to any violation of
the terms of the contract. If the engineer or architect
supervises the construction, he shall be solidarily
liable with the contractor.
Acceptance of the building, after completion, does
not imply waiver of any of the causes of action by
reason of any defect mentioned in the preceeding
paragraph.
The action must be brought within ten years following the collapse of the building. (n)
Liability of engineer or architect/contractor
for collapse of building constructed.
(1) Liability of engineer or achitect. — The engineer or architect who drew up the plans and specifications shall be liable
for damages, if:

(a) The collapse took place within 15 years from the
completion of the structure;
(b) it took place by reason of a defect in the plans and
specifications, or due to the defects in the ground; and

(c) The action for damages is brought within 10 years
following the collapse of the building.

(2) Liability of contractor. — The contractor is likewise responsible for the damages if:
(a) The edifice falls within the same period;

(b) The collapse took place on account of defects in the
construction or the use of materials of inferior quality furnished by him, or due to any violation of the terms of the
contract; and
(d) The action for damages is brought within 10 years
following the collapse of the building.

456

Arts. 1732-1733

(3) Solidary liability. — In case the engineer or architect
supervised or directed the construction he shall be solidarily
liable (see Arts. 1207, 1216.) with the contractor.
Note that Article 1723 speaks of a building that should “collapse’’ or edifice that “falls;’’ hence, it does not apply to minor
defects. (see Bosque vs. Chipco, 14 Phil. 95 [1909].) However, a
third person suffering damage as a result of any defect in the
construction may proceed, against the engineer or architect or
contractor. (Art. 2192, Chap. 6.)
(4) Effect of acceptance of work. — The general rule in a
contract for a piece of work is that acceptance of the work by
the employer relieves the contractor of liability for any defect
in the work. (Art. 1719.) But mere acceptance of the building
after competition, does not imply waiver of any of the causes
of action arising from any defect in the construction.
Art. 1732. Common carriers are persons, corporations, firms or associations engaged in the business
of carrying or transporting passengers or goods or
both, by land, water, or air, for compensation, offering their services to the public.
Art. 1733. Common carriers, from the nature of
their business and for reasons of public policy, are
bound to observe extraordinary diligence in the
vigilance over the goods and for the safety of the
passengers transported by them, according to all
the circumstances of each case.
Such extraordinary diligence in vigilance over the
goods is further expressed in Articles 1734, 1735,
and 1745, Nos. 5, 6, and 7, while the extraordinary
diligence for the safety of the passengers is further
set forth in Articles 1755 and 1756.
Art. 1734. Common carriers are responsible for the
loss, destruction, or deterioration of the goods, unless
the same is due to any of the following causes only:
(1) Flood, storm, earthquake, lightning, or other

Arts. 1734, 1755-1756,

OTHER ACTIONABLE WRONGS
Common Carriers

natural disaster or calamity;
(2) Act of the public enemy in war, whether international or civil;
(3) Act or omission of the shipper or owner of
the goods;
(4) The character of the goods or defects in the
packing or in the containers;
(5) Order or act of competent public authority.
Art. 1755. A common carrier is bound to carry
the passengers safely as far as human care and
foresight can provide, using the utmost diligence of
very cautious persons, with a due regard for all the
circumstances.
Art. 1756. In case of death of or injuries to passengers, common carriers are presumed to have
been at fault or to have acted negligently, unless they
prove that they observed extraordinary diligence as
prescribed in Articles 1733 and 1755.
Art. 1759. Common carriers are liable for the death
of or injuries to passengers through the negligence
or willful acts of the former’s employees, although
such employees may have acted beyond the scope
of their authority or in violation of the orders of the
common carriers.
This liability of the common carriers does not
cease upon proof that they exercised all the diligence of a good father of a family in the selection
and supervision of their employees.
Art. 1762. The contributory negligence of the
passenger does not bar recovery of damages for
his death or injuries, if the proximate cause thereof
is the negligence of the common carrier, but the
amount of damages shall be equitably reduced.
Art. 1763. A common carrier is responsible for
injuries suffered by a passenger on account of the
wilful acts or negligence of other passengers or of

457

458

TORTS

Arts. 1732-1734, 17551756, 1759, 1762-1763

strangers, if the common carrier’s employees through
the exercise of the diligence of a good father of a
family could have prevented or stopped the act or
omission.
Liability of common carriers.
Common carriers are bound to observe extraordinary diligence in the vigilance over the goods and for the safety of the
passengers transported by them. (Art. 1733.) The contract of
carriage is a trust. A common carrier is not, however, considered an absolute insurer against all risks of travel. (Lasam vs.
Smith, 45 Phil. 565 [1924].)
(1) Vigilance over goods. — They are responsible for the loss,
destruction, or deterioration of the goods, unless the same is
due to any of the five (5) cases enumerated in Article 1734.
In other cases of loss, etc., they are presumed to have been at
fault or to have acted negligently, unless they prove that they
observed extraordinary diligence required in Article 1733. (Art.
1735.)

(2) Safety of passengers. — A common carrier is bound to
carry its passengers safely as far as human care and foresight
can provide, employing outmost diligence in the carriage of
passenger (Art. 1755.) or extraordinary diligence as imposed
by Article 1733.
(a) In case of death of, or injuries to, passengers, it is
presumed at fault unless it proves it observed extraordinary
diligence. (Art. 1756.) This liability subsists even if due to
the negligence or willful acts of its employees and although
such employees have acted beyond the scope of their authority or in violation of the carrier’s orders. (Art. 1759.)

The rule is different in quasi-delict where it is a requisite
for such liability that the employee be acting within the
scope of his assigned task. (see Art. 2180, par. 5.)

(b) The liability imposed by Article 1759 is not excused
by proof that the carrier exercised all the diligence of a good
father of a family in the selection and supervision of its
employees. In quasi-delict, the responsibility of the employ-

Arts. 1732-1734, 17551756, 1759, 1762-1763

OTHER ACTIONABLE WRONGS
Common Carriers

459

ers shall cease if they can prove that they observed all the
diligence of a good father of a family to prevent damage.
(Ibid., par. 8.)

(c) A common carrier cannot generally be held responsible for injuries suffered by its passengers on account of the
willful acts or negligence of other passengers or of strangers,
inasmuch as the carrier does not exercise any control over
them unless it be proved that its employees through the
exercise of the diligence of a good father of a family could
have prevented or stopped the act or omission. (Art. 1763;
Longalong vs. Bautista, 6 C.A. Rep. 313.)

(3) Liability for breach of contract. — Note that where there
is a breach of the carrier’s contractual obligation to carry his
passengers safely to their destination (culpa contractual), the liability of the carrier is not merely subsidiary or secondary but
direct and immediate. (Vda. De Medina vs. Cresencia, 99 Phil.
506 [1956].) The action by the passenger or shipper of goods for
breach of the contract of carriage cannot be defeated by proof
of the exercise of due diligence in the selection and supervision
of its employees.
Civil actions based on alleged breach of contract are governed by the Civil Code and are distinct and separate from the
criminal action that may be brought by the injured party, and
are, therefore, independent of and regardless of the result of
the latter. (Bisaya Land Transportation Company, Inc. vs. Mejia,
99 Phil. 50 [1956].)

(4) Liability for quasi-delict. — Nevertheless, “the act that
breaks the contract may be also a tort.’’ (Air France vs. Carrascoso, 262 SCRA 155 [1996].) Liability for quasi-delict may be due
to the other passengers or third persons. If the action is based
on quasi-delict, the presumption of negligence does not apply
although the exercise of extraordinary diligence is still required
“according to all the circumstances of each case.’’ (Art. 1733.)
Art. 1822. Where, by any wrongful act or omission of any partner acting in the ordinary course of
the business of the partnership or with the authority of his co-partners, loss or injury is caused to

460

TORTS

Arts. 1822-1824

any person, not being a partner in the partnership,
or any penalty is incurred, the partnership is liable
therefor to the same extent as the partner so acting
or omitting to act. (n)
Art. 1823. The partnership is bound to make
good the loss:
(1) Where one partner acting within the scope of
his apparent authority receives money or property
of a third person and misapplies it; and
(2) Where the partnership in the course of its
business receives money or property of a third
person and the money or property so received is
misapplied by any partner while it is in the custody
of the partnership. (n)
Art. 1824. All partners are liable solidarily with
the partnership for everything chargeable to the
partnership under Articles 1822 and 1823. (n)
Liability of partners/partnership for tort
and breach of trust.
(1) Liability arising from partner’s torts. — The following are
the requisites for liability under Article 1822:
(a) The partner must be guilty of a wrongful act or
omission; and

(b) He must be acting in the ordinary course of business,
or with the authority of his co-partners even if the act is
unconnected with the business.

So, the partners are liable for the negligent operation of a
vehicle by a partner, acting in the course of the business which
results in a traffic accident. But if he is driving a partnershipowned vehicle for purposes of his own, although with the permission of the other partners, the acting partner alone is liable.
Neither is the partnership liable if the wrongful act or omission
was committed after the partnership’s dissolution and the same
was not connected with the winding up of partnership affairs.
Partnership liability under Article 1822 does not extend to

Art. 1928

OTHER ACTIONABLE WRONGS
Agency

461

criminal liability such as embezzlement, where the wrongdoing
is regarded as individual in character. (De Leon and De Leon,
Jr., Comments and Cases on Partnership, Agency, and Trusts,
2002 Ed., p. 206.)

(2) Liability arising from partner’s breach of trust. — Under
Article 1823, the partnership is liable for any losses suffered by
a third person whose money or property is misappropriated by
a partner who received it within the scope of his authority or by
any other partner after it was received by the partnership in the
ordinary course of business while in its custody. In the first situation, the misapplication is committed by the partner who received
the money or property, while in the second, by another partner
while it is in the custody of the partnership. (Ibid., p. 207.)
(3) Nature of liability. — The partners as well as the partnership are solidarily liable to third person (Art. 1824.) for the
wrongful act or omission (Art. 1822.) or breach of trust (Art.
1823.) of a partner acting within the scope of the firm’s business or with the authority of his co-partners. This is true even
though the other partners were innocent, without prejudice to
their right to recover from the guilty partner. The obligation is
solidary because the law protects him who, in good faith, relied
upon the authority of a partner, whether such authority is real
or apparent.
The reason for the law’s imposition of wider liability on the
partnership with respect to torts and breach of trust is based
on public policy. The rule of respondeat superior (also called the
rule of vicarious liability) applies to the law of partnership in
the same manner as other rules governing the agency relationship. (Ibid., pp. 204-205.)
Art. 1928. The agent may withdraw from the
agency by giving due notice to the principal. If the
latter should suffer any damage by reason of the
withdrawal, the agent must indemnify him therefor,
unless the agent should base his withdrawal upon
the impossibility of continuing the performance of the
agency without grave detriment to himself. (1736a)

462

TORTS

Arts. 1928-1929

Art. 1929. The agent, even if he should withdraw
from the agency for a valid reason, must continue
to act until the principal has had reasonable opportunity to take the necessary steps to meet the
situation. (1737a)
Liability of agent for unjustified withdrawal
from the agency.
(1) Right of agent to withdraw. — Just as the principal may
revoke generally the agency at will (Art. 1920.), the agent may
likewise renounce or withdraw from the agency at any time,
without the consent of the principal, even in violation of the
latter’s contractual rights; subject to liability for breach of contract or for tort. This rule which applies whether the agency is
gratuitous or for compensation is based on the constitutional
prohibition against involuntary servitude.

(a) Without just cause. — The law imposes upon the
agent the duty to give due notice to the principal and if
the withdrawal is without just cause, to indemnify the
principal should the latter suffer damage by reason of such
withdrawal. The reason for the indemnity imposed by law is
that the agent fails in his obligation and as such, he answers
for losses and damages occasioned by the non-fulfillment.
(Arts. 1884, 1770.)
(b) With just cause. — If the agent withdraws from the
agency for a valid reason (Art. 1929.) as when the withdrawal
is based on the impossibility of continuing with the agency
without grave detriment to himself (Art. 1928.), or is due
to a fortuitous event (Art. 1174.), the agent cannot be held
liable. (see De la Peña vs. Hidalgo, 16 Phil. 450 [1910].) While
the agent is forbidden to prefer his interests to those of the
principal (Art. 1889.), he is not required to sacrifice his own
interests just to serve the principal.

(2) Obligation of agent to continue after withdrawal. — Even
when the agent withdraws from the agency for a valid reason,
he must continue to act until the principal has had reasonable
opportunity to take the necessary steps like the appointment of
a new agent to remedy the situation caused by the withdrawal.

Art. 1951

OTHER ACTIONABLE WRONGS
Commodatum/Pledge

The purpose of the law is to prevent damage or prejudice to
the principal.

The law reconciles the interests of the agent with those of
the principal, and if it permits the withdrawal of the agent, it
is on the condition that no damage results to the principal, and
if the agent desires to be relieved of the obligation of making
reparation when he withdraws for a just cause, he must continue to act so that no injury may be caused to the principal.
Art. 1951. The bailor who, knowing the flaws of
the thing loaned, does not advise the bailee of the
same, shall be liable to the latter for the damages
which he may suffer by reason thereof. (1752)
Liability of bailor/pledgor for flaws
of thing loaned/pledged.
(1) Liability of bailor to pay damages for known hidden flaws.
— The following are the requisites which must concur for the
application of the above article:
(a) There is flaw or defect in the thing loaned;
(b) The flaw or defect is hidden;
(c) The bailor is aware thereof;

(d) He does not advise the bailee of the same; and

(e) The bailee suffers damages by reason of said flaw
or defect.

The bailor is made liable for his bad faith. The bailee is
given the right of retention until he is paid damages. (Art. 1944.)
The bailor cannot exempt himself from the payment of
expenses or damages by abandoning the thing to the bailee
(Art. 1952.) for the amount thereof may exceed the value of
the thing loaned.
(2) Where flaw unknown to bailor. — Where the defect is not
known to the bailor, he is not liable because commodatum is
gratuitous. The rule is different in sale (see Art. 1547.) and lease
(see Art. 1653.) for in these contracts, valuable consideration
is received by the vendor (see Art. 1458.) and the lessor. (Art.

(3) Responsibility of pledgor for flaws of thing pledged. — The
same responsibility of a bailor in commodatum is imposed on a
pledgor. (Art. 2101.)
Art. 1998. The deposit of effects made by travellers in hotels or inns shall also be regarded as
necessary. The keepers of hotels or inns shall be
responsible for them as depositaries, provided that
notice was given to them, or to their employees, of
the effects brought by the guests and that, on the
part of the latter, they take the precautions which
said hotel-keepers or their substitutes advised relative to the care and vigilance of their effects. (1783)
Art. 1999. The hotel-keeper is liable for the vehicles, animals and articles which have been introduced
or placed in the annexes of the hotel. (n)
Art. 2000. The responsibility referred to in the two
preceding articles shall include the loss of, or injury
to the personal property of the guests caused by the
servants or employees of the keepers of hotels or inns
as well as by strangers; but not that which may proceed from any force majeure. The fact that travellers
are constrained to rely on the vigilance of the keeper
of the hotel or inn shall be considered in determining
the degree of care required of him. (1784a)
Art. 2001. The act of a thief or robber, who has
entered the hotel is not deemed force majeure, unless it is done with the use of arms or through an
irresistible force. (n)
Art. 2002. The hotel-keeper is not liable for compensation if the loss is due to the acts of the guest,
his family, servants or visitors, or if the loss arises
from the character of the things brought into the
hotel. (n)
Art. 2003. The hotel-keeper cannot free himself
from responsibility by posting notices to the effect

that he is not liable for the articles brought by the
guest. Any stipulation between the hotel-keeper and
the guest whereby the responsibility of the former
as set forth in Articles 1998 to 2001 is suppressed
or diminished shall be void. (n)
Liability of keepers of hotels or inns.

(1) Deposit by travelers in hotels and inn’s. — Before keepers
of hotels or inns may be held responsible as depositaries with
regard to the effects of their guests, the following elements must
concur:

(a) They have been previously informed about the effects
brought by the guests; and

(b) The latter have taken the precautions prescribed
regarding their safekeeping. (see Art. 102, Revised Penal
Code, Chap. 10.)

(2) Extent of liability of keepers of hotels and inns. — The liability is not limited to effects lost or damaged in the hotel
rooms which come under the term “baggage” or articles such
as clothing as are ordinarily used by travellers but include
those lost or damaged in hotel annexes such as vehicles in the
hotel’s garage. The responsibility imposed extends to all those
who offer lodging for a compensation, whatever may be their
character. (11 Manresa 759.)
(3) When hotel keeper liable. — In the following cases, the
hotel-keeper is liable regardless of the amount of care exercised:

(a) The loss or injury is caused by his servants or employees as well as by strangers (Art. 2000.) provided that
notice has been given and proper precautions taken (Art.
1998.); and
(b) The loss is caused by the act of a thief or robber done
without the use of arms and irresistible force. (Art. 2001.)
for in this case, the hotel-keeper is apparently negligent.

(4) When hotel-keeper not liable. — The hotel keeper is not
liable in the following cases:
(a) The loss or injury is caused by force majeure, like
flood, fire (Art. 2000.), theft or robbery by a stranger (not

466

TORTS

Arts. 1998-2003

by hotel-keeper’s servant or employee) with the use of arms
or, through an irresistible force (Art. 2001.), etc., unless he
is guilty of fault or negligence in failing to provide against
the loss or injury;
(b) The loss is due to the acts of the guests, his family,
servants, or visitors (Art. 2002.); and

(c) The loss arises from the character of the things
brought into the hotel. (Ibid.)

(5) Exemption or diminution of liability. — The rule in this
article 2003 is similar to the rule on common carriers which
does not allow a common carrier to dispense with or limit his
responsibility by stipulation or by posting of notices. (see Art.
1760.) Such stipulation is deemed contrary to law, morals, and
public policy. (Art. 1306.)

(a) Hotel-keepers and inn-keepers in offering their
accommodations to the public, practically volunteer as
depositaries, and as such, they should be subject to an extraordinary degree of responsibility for the protection and
safety of travellers who have no alternative but rely on the
good faith and care of those with whom they take lodging.
(Art. 2000.)
(b) Furthermore, inn-keepers, by the very nature of their
business, have supervision and control of their inns and the
premises thereof. As a matter of fact, authorities are to the
effect that it is not necessary in order to hold an inn-keeper
liable that the effects of the guests be actually delivered to
him or his employees; it is enough that they are within the
inn. (De Los Santos vs. Tan Khey, [CA] 580 O.G. 7693; 29

Chapter 9
TORT LIABILITY UNDER SPECIAL LAWS
Sources of tort liability for damages.
Civil obligations derived from quasi-delicts are governed
principally by the Civil Code, particularly, the provisions on
“Human Relations’’ (Arts.1 19-36, Chap. 4.) and “Quasi-Delicts.
(Arts. 2176-2194, Chap. 6.)

Those incurred for quasi-delicts committed under special
laws are governed by said laws. (Art. 1162.) With respect to
civil obligations arising from criminal offenses or delicts, the
Revised Penal Code or the penal law violated applies. (Art.
1161.) However, the victim of the crime or the offended party
is given the prerogative to consider the criminal offense as a
quasi-delict by filing an independent civil action for damages
under Articles 32, 33, 34, and 2176 of the Civil Code on the
theory of quasi-delict. (Chaps. 4, 10.)
This Chapter acquaints the student with the pertinent provisions of special laws imposing civil liability for their violations.
An extensive discussion of these laws or provisions lies outside
the scope of a book on torts and damages; it properly belongs
to works in other fields of law.

(1) Civil Code provisions. — Articles 2187 and 2188 (Chap.
6.) are new provisions in the Civil Code imposing liability on
manufacturers and processors resulting from defective products.
Unless otherwise indicated, refers to article in the Civil Code.

TORTS

These provisions, together with Article 33 (Chap. 4.), Articles
1547, 1561-1571 on sales warranties, and Article 2176 (Chap. 6.),
may be invoked in an action for damages in consumer products
and services liability cases.
The liability of the manufacturer or seller may be based on
delict punishable under the Revised Penal Code or any special
law.

(2) Objectives and basic policy. — An important development
in this field is the passage of R.A. No. 7394 (April 13, 1992),
known as the “Consumer Act of the Philippines.’’ It repeals or
amends accordingly all laws2 enacted prior thereto inconsistent
therewith. (Art. 170 thereof.)
Art. 2. Declaration of Basic Policy. — It is the policy of
the State to protect the interests of the consumer, promote
his general welfare and to establish standards of conduct
for business and industry. Towards this end, the State shall
implement measures to achieve the following objectives:
a) protection against hazards to health and safety;

b) protection against deceptive, unfair and unconscionable sales acts and practices;
c) provision of information and education to facilitate
sound choice and the proper exercise of rights by the consumer;
d) provision of adequate rights and means of redress;
and

e) involvement of consumer representatives in the formulation of social and economic policies.

(3) Definition of terms. — For purposes of the Act, the following terms, among others, are defined in Section 4:

(a) Consumer products and services means goods, services
and credits, debts or obligations which are primarily for
personal, family, household or agricultural purposes, which
shall include but not limited to food, drugs, cosmetics, and

472

TORTS

pure matter of public policy.

The Act provides liability for defective products and services
“independently of fault,’’ and without need of privity of contract
with the consumer to wit:

Art. 97. Liability for the Defective Products. — Any Filipino
or foreign manufacturer, producer, and any importer, shall be
liable for redress, independently of fault, for damages caused
to consumers by defects resulting from design, manufacture,
construction, assembly and erection, formulas and handling
and making up, presentation or packing of their products,
as well as for the insufficient or inadequate information on
the use and hazards thereof.
Art. 98. Liability of Tradesman or Seller. — The tradesman/
seller is likewise liable, pursuant to the preceding article
when:
a) It is not possible to identify the manufacturer, builder,
producer or importer.

b) The product is supplied, without clear identification
of the manufacturer, producer, builder or importer;

c) He does not adequately preserve perishable goods.
The party making payment to the damaged party may exercise the right to recover a part of the whole of the payment
made against the other responsible parties, in accordance
with their part or responsibility in the cause of the damage
effected.
A product is defective when it does not offer the safety
rightfully expected of it, taking relevant circumstances into
consideration, including but not limited to:
a) Presentation of product;

b) Use and hazards reasonably expected of it;
c) The time it was put into circulation.

A product is not considered defective because another
better quality product has been placed in the market.
The manufacturer, builder, producer or importer shall
not be held liable when it evidences:

TORT LIABILITY UNDER SPECIAL LAWS
Consumer Act

473

a) That it did not place the product on the market;

b) That although it did place the product on the market
such product has no defect;
c) That the consumer or a third party is solely at fault.

Art. 99. Liability for Defective Services. — The service supplier is liable for redress, independently of fault, for damages
caused to consumers by defects relating to the rendering of
the services, as well as for insufficient or inadequate information on the fruition and hazards thereof.
The service is defective when it does not provide the
safety the consumer may rightfully expect of it, taking the
relevant circumstances into consideration, including but not
limited to:
a) The manner in which it is provided;

b) The result of hazards which may reasonably be expected of it;
c) The time when it was provided.

A service is not considered defective because of the use
or introduction of new techniques.

The supplier of the services shall not be held liable when
it is proven:
a) That there is no defect in the service rendered;

b) That the consumer or third party is solely at fault.

Note that Articles 97 and 99 specify the matters which can be
raised as a defense by the manufacturer, etc. or service supplier.

(5) Prohibited sales acts and practices. — The pertinent provisions of the Act as are as follows:

Art. 50. Prohibition Against Deceptive Sales Acts or Practices. — A deceptive act or practice by a seller or supplier
in connection with a consumer transaction violates this Act
whether it occurs before, during or after the transaction. An
act or practice shall be deemed deceptive whenever the producer, manufacturer, supplier or seller, through concealment,
false representation or fraudulent manipulation, induces a

474

TORTS

consumer to enter into a sales or lease transaction of any
consumer product or service.
Without limiting the scope of the above paragraph, the
act or practice of a seller or supplier is deceptive when it
represents that:

a) A consumer product or service has the sponsorship,
approval, performance, characteristics, ingredients, accessories, uses, or benefits it does not have;

b) A consumer product or service is of a particular
standard, quality, grade, style, or model when in fact it is
not;
c) A consumer product is new, original or unused,
when in fact, it is in a deteriorated, altered, reconditioned,
reclaimed or second-hand state;
d) A consumer product or service is available to the
consumer for a reason that is different from the fact;

e) A consumer product or service has been supplied in
accordance with the previous representation when in fact it
is not;

f) A consumer product or service can be supplied in a
quantity greater than the supplier intends;

g) A service, or repair of a consumer product is needed
when in fact it is not;

h) A specific price advantage of a consumer product
exists when in fact it does not;
i) The sales act or practice involves or does not involve
a warranty, a disclaimer of warranties, particular warranty
terms or other rights, remedies or obligations if the indication is false; and
j) The seller or supplier has a sponsorship, approval,
or affiliation he does not have.

Art. 51. Deceptive Sales Act or Practices By Regulation.
— The Department shall, after due notice and hearing,
promulgate regulations declaring as deceptive any sales act,
practice or technique which is a misrepresentation of facts

TORT LIABILITY UNDER SPECIAL LAWS
Consumer Act

475

other than these enumerated in Article 50.

Art. 52. Unfair or Unconscionable Sales Act or Practice.
— An unfair or unconscionable sales act or practice by a
seller or supplier in connection with a consumer transaction
violates this Chapter whether it occurs before, during or
after the consumer transaction. An act or practice shall be
deemed unfair or unconscionable whenever the producer,
manufacturer, distributor, supplier or seller, by taking advantage of the consumer’s physical or mental infirmity,
ignorance, illiteracy, lack of time or the general conditions
of the environment or surroundings, induces the consumer
to enter into a sales or lease transaction grossly inimical to
the interests of the consumer or grossly one-sided in favor
of the producer, manufacturer, distributor, supplier or seller.

In determining whether an act or practice is unfair
and unconscionable, the following circumstances shall be
considered:
a) That the producer, manufacturer, distributor, supplier
or seller took advantage of the inability of the consumer to
reasonably protect his interest because of his inability to
understand the language of an agreement, or similar factors;
b) That when the consumer transaction was entered
into, the price grossly exceeded the price at which similar
products or services were readily obtainable in similar
transaction by like consumers;
c) That when the consumer transaction was entered into,
the consumer was unable to receive a substantial benefit
from the subject of the transaction;

d) That when the consumer was entered into, the seller
or supplier was aware that there was no reasonable probability or payment of the obligation in full by the consumer;
and
e) That the transaction that the seller or supplier induced the consumer to enter into was excessively one-sided
in favor of the seller or supplier.

(6) Criminal and administrative penalties. — The Act enumerates the prohibited acts (Art. 18, 40, 46, 64, 76, 106, 110-115,

476

TORTS

thereof.) for which it imposes corresponding penalties. (Arts. 19,
41, 47, 60, 65, 95, 107, 123, 124, 147 thereof.) It also provides for
administrative penalties even if not prayed for in the complaint.
(Art. 164 thereof.)
(7) Prescription. — All actions or claims accruing under the
provisions of this Act and the rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto shall prescribe within two (2) years from the time
the consumer transaction was consummated or the deceptive
or unfair and unconscionable act or practice was committed
and in case of hidden defects, from discovery thereof. (Art. 169
thereof.)
General Banking Law.

(1) Vital role of banks. — R.A. No. 8791 (May 23, 2000) is
“the General Banking Law of 2000.’’ Its policy statement reads:
“Sec. 2. Declaration Of Policy. — The State recognizes the
vital role of banks providing an environment conducive to
the sustained development of the national economy and the
fiduciary nature of banking that requires high standards of
integrity and performance. In furtherance thereof, the State
shall promote and maintain a stable and efficient banking

and responsive to the demands of a developing economy.’’

(2) Prohibited transactions. — The transactions, acts or omissions may give rise to action for damages in favor of the bank
or any person injured thereby, under Article 2176 and under
the pertinent provisions of the Revised Penal Code, without
prejudice to the penalties and administrative sanctions provided
in Sections 66 and 70 of the Act and Sections 34, 35, 36, and 37
of the new Central Bank Act. (R.A. No. 7653.)
Sec. 55. Prohibited Transactions. —

55.1. No director, officer, employee, or agent of any bank

(b) Without order of a court of competent jurisdiction,
disclose to any unauthorized person any information relative to the funds or properties in the custody of the bank
belonging to private individuals, corporations, or any other

provisions of existing laws shall prevail;

(c) Accept gifts, fees, or commissions or any other form

or other credit accommodation from said bank;
(d) Overvalue or aid in overvaluing any security for the

or any bank; or
(e) Outsource inherent banking functions.
55.2. No borrower of a bank shall —

(a) Fraudulently overvalue property offered as security
for a loan or other credit accommodation from the bank;

(b) Furnish false or make misrepresentation or suppression of material facts for the purpose of obtaining, renewing, or increasing a loan or other credit accommodation or
extending the period thereof;

(c) Attempt to defraud the said bank in the event of a
court action to recover a loan or other credit accommodation; or
(d) Offer any director, officer, employee or agent of a
bank any gift, fee, commission, or any other form of compensation in order to influence such persons into approving
a loan or other credit accommodation application.

55.3. No examiner, officer or employee of the Bangko
Sentral or of any department, bureau, office, branch or
agency of the Government that is assigned to supervise,
examine, assist or render technical assistance to any bank
shall commit any of the acts enumerated in this Section or
aid in the commission of the same.
The making of false reports or misrepresentation or
suppression of material facts by personnel of the Bangko

478

TORTS

Sentral ng Pilipinas shall be subject to the administrative
and criminal sanctions provided under the New Central
Bank Act.
55.4. Consistent with the provisions of Republic Act
No. 1405, otherwise known as the Banks Secrecy Law, no
bank shall employ casual or non-regular personnel or too
lengthy probationary personnel in the conduct of its business involving bank deposits.

Sec. 56. Conducting Business in an Unsafe or Unsound
Manner. — In determining whether a particular act or omission, which is not otherwise prohibited by any law, rule or
regulation affecting banks, quasi-banks or trust entities, may
be deemed as conducting business in an unsafe or unsound
manner for purposes of this Section, the Monetary Board
shall consider any of the following circumstances:
56.1. The act or omission has resulted or may result in
material loss or damage, or abnormal risk or danger to the
safety, stability, liquidity or solvency of the institution;

56.2. The act or omission has resulted or may result in
material loss or damage or abnormal risk to the institution’s
depositors, creditors, investors, stockholders or to the Bangko
Sentral or to the public in general;
56.3. The act or omission has caused any undue injury,
or has given any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference to the bank or any party in the discharge by the
director or officer of his duties and responsibilities through
manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable
negligence; or
56.4. The act or omission involves entering into any contract or transaction manifestly and grossly disadvantageous
to the bank, quasi-bank or trust entity, whether or not the
director or officer profited or will profit thereby.

Whenever a bank, quasi-bank or trust entity persists in
conducting its business in an unsafe or unsound manner,
the Monetary Board may, without prejudice to the administrative sanctions provided in Section 37 of the New Central
Bank Act, take action under Section 30 of the same Act and/

TORT LIABILITY UNDER SPECIAL LAWS
Corporation Code of the Philippines

479

or immediately exclude the erring bank from clearing, the
provisions of law to the contrary notwithstanding.’’

(3) Relation between depositor and bank. — A bank deposit
is really a loan which creates the relationship of debtor (bank)
and creditor (depositor). Accordingly, our Civil Code provides:
“Fixed, saving, and current deposits of money in banks and
similar institutions shall be governed by the provisions concerning simple loan.’’ (Art. 1980.)

In every case, the depositor expects the bank to treat his
account with the utmost fidelity, whether such account consists
only of a few single transaction, accurately down to the last
centavo, and as promptly as possible. This has to be done if
the account is to reflect at any given time the amount of money
the depositor can dispose as he sees fit, confident that the bank
will deliver it as and to whomever he directs. A blunder on
the part of the bank, such as the failure to duly credit him his
deposits as soon as they are made, can cause the depositor not
a little embarrassment if not financial loss and perhaps even
civil and criminal litigation. The depositor may file an action
under Article 2176 for damages suffered by him through the
fault or negligence of the bank and its employees. (Philippine
Bank of Commerce vs. Court of Appeals, 269 SCRA 695 [1997].)
(4) Business of banks affected with public interest. — As a business affected with public interest and because of the nature of
its function a bank is under obligation to treat the accounts of
its depositors with meticulous care, always having in mind the
fiduciary nature of their relationship. The degree of diligence
required is more than that of a good father of the family. Considering the said fiduciary nature of their relationship, banks
are duty bound to treat the accounts of their clients with the
highest degree of care. (Ibid.)
Corporation Code.
Batas Pambansa Blg. 68 (May 1, 1980) is “The Corporation
Code of the Philippines.’’ It is the general law governing all
private corporations.

480

TORTS

(1) Tort as a source of liability. — There are a number of provisions in the Code that recognize tort as a source of liability:
Sec. 21. Corporation by estoppel. — All persons who assume
to act as a corporation knowing it to be without authority
to do so shall be liable as general partners for all debts, liabilities and damages incurred or arising as a result thereof:
Provided, however, That when any such ostensible corporation
is sued on any transaction entered by it as a corporation or
on any tort committed by it as such, it shall not be allowed
to use as a defense its lack of corporate personality.
One who assumes an obligation to an ostensible corporation as such, cannot resist performance thereof on the
ground that there was in fact no corporation.

Sec. 31. Liability of directors, trustees, or officers. — Directors
or trustees who willfully and knowingly vote for or assent to
patently unlawful acts of the corporation or who are guilty
of gross negligence or bad faith in directing the affairs of
the corporation or acquire any personal or pecuniary interest in conflict with their duty as such directors or trustees
shall be liable jointly and severally for all damages resulting
therefrom suffered by the corporation, its stockholders or
members and other persons.

When a director, trustee, or officer attempts to acquire
or acquires, in violation of his duty, any interest adverse
to the corporation in respect of any matter which has been
reposed in him in confidence, as to which equity imposes
a disability upon him to deal in his own behalf, he shall
be liable as a trustee for the corporation and must account
for the profits which otherwise would have accrued to the
corporation. (n)
Sec. 45. Ultra vires acts of corporations. — No corporation
under this Code shall possess or exercise any corporate powers except those conferred by this Code or by its articles of
incorporation and except such as are necessary or incidental
to the exercise of the powers so conferred. (14a)

Sec. 65. Liability of directors for watered stocks. — Any director or officer of a corporation consenting to the issuance

TORT LIABILITY UNDER SPECIAL LAWS
Corporation Code of the Philippines

481

of stocks for a consideration less than its par or issued value
or for a consideration in any form other than cash, valued in
excess of its fair value, or who, having knowledge thereof,
does not forthwith express his objection in writing and file
the same with the corporate secretary, shall be solidarily
liable with the stockholder concerned to the corporation
and its creditors for the difference between the fair value
received at the time of issuance of the stock and the par or
issued value of the same. (16, 2nd par.)
Sec. 100. Agreements by stockholders. —
xxx

xxx

5. To the extent that the stockholders are actively
engaged in the management or operation of the business
and affairs of a close corporation, the stockholders shall
be held to strict fiduciary duties to each other and among
themselves. Said stockholders shall be personally liable for
corporate torts unless the corporation has obtained reasonably adequate liability insurance.’’

(2) Liability for tort committed by an ostensible corporation. — In
certain circumstances, an organization may not be a corporation
de jure — or perhaps not even de facto — may, so far as the
parties to a given transaction are concerned, be regarded practically as a corporation, being recognized as such by the parties
themselves. Actually, an organization which has not complied
with the conditions precedent to even de facto existence is not,
for any purpose, a corporation.
Nevertheless, the incidents of a corporate existence may exist
as between the parties by virtue of an estoppel. Thus, besides
corporation de jure and de facto, there is sometimes a recognition
of a third class known as corporation by estoppel, also known as
ostensible corporation.

(a) The stockholders or members of a pretended or ostensible corporation who participated in holding it out as
a corporation are generally estopped or precluded to deny
its existence against creditors for the purpose of escaping
liability for corporate debts or for unpaid part of a subscription to stock.

482

TORTS

(b) So, also are the third persons who deal with such a
corporation recognizing it as such and the pretended corporation itself, estopped from denying its corporate existence
and raising the defense of its lack of corporate personality
for the purpose of defeating a liability growing out of the
contractual relation between them and such entity (Compania Agricola de Ultramar vs. Reyes, 4 Phil. 2 [1904].), or
any tort committed by it as such (Sec. 21.), or later taking
advantage of their non-compliance with the law, chiefly in
cases where such persons have received the benefits of the
contract. (Merrill Lynch Futures, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals,
211 SCRA 824 [1992].) But one who is induced to deal with
an apparent corporation by fraud will not be estopped to
deny the corporate existence.
(c) All persons not stockholders or members who assume
to act as a corporation knowing it to be without authority
to do so shall be liable as general partners for all debts, liabilities, and damages incurred or arising as a result thereof.

(3) Liability of directors/trustees or officers. — A corporation,
being a juridical entity, may act only through its directors/
trustees, officers and employees. Obligations incurred by them,
acting as such corporate agents, are not theirs but the direct
account-abilities of the corporation they represent. True, solidary
liabilities may at times be incurred but only when exceptional
circumstances warrant such as in the cases enumerated in the
first paragraph of Section 31. (MAM Realty Development vs.
National Labor Relations Commission, 244 SCRA 797 [1995].)

Furthermore, in the case mentioned in the second paragraph,
the director/trustee or officer guilty of violation of duty shall be
held accountable for the profits which otherwise would have accrued to the corporation. Private or secret profits obtained must
be accounted for, even though the transaction on which they are
made is advantageous or is not harmful to the corporation, or
even though the director/trustee or officer acted without intent
to injure the corporation. Similarly, a director guilty of disloyal
act against the corporation is required by Section 34 of the Code
to account to the corporation for the profits obtained by him from
a business opportunity which should belong to the corporation.

TORT LIABILITY UNDER SPECIAL LAWS
Corporation Code of the Philippines

483

(4) Corporate liability for tortious acts of officers or agents. — A
corporation can only act as such through its officers and agents.
This being the case, it is responsible for the tortious acts of the
latter done within the scope of their authority or in the course
of employment to the same extent that an unincorporated individual or association would be. (see Art. 2180, Chap. 6.)
(a) A corporation cannot, in order to escape liability for
damages for the wrongful acts of its agents or employees,
assert that such acts were beyond the scope of its corporate
power or that they occurred in connection with a transaction beyond the scope of such power. It is to be kept in
mind that all torts are necessarily ultra vires, since if an act
is legally authorized, it is for that reason lawful and not a
tort. (19 C.J.S. 948.)

(b) In labor cases, the Supreme Court has held corporate
directors and officers solidarily liable with the corporation
for the termination of employment of employees done with
malice or in bad faith. (Sunio vs. National Labor Relations
Commission, 127 SCRA 390 [1984]; General Bank & Trust
Co. vs. Court of Appeals, 135 SCRA 569 [1985]; MAM
Realty Development Corp. vs. National Labor Relations
Commission, 61 SCAD 744, 244 SCRA 797 [1995]; Uichico
vs. National Labor Relations Commission, 83 SCAD 31, 273
SCRA 35 [1997].)

(5) Imputation of criminal intent. — Although it has no mind,
an intention on the part of its agent to do wrong may be imputed
to the corporation. Accordingly, corporations may be held liable
for libel and malicious prosecution. But since a corporation as
a person is a mere legal fiction, it cannot be proceeded against
criminally because it cannot commit a crime in which personal
violence or malicious intent is required. Criminal action is limited
to the corporate agents guilty of an act amounting to a crime
and never against the corporation itself. (West Coast Life Ins.
Co. vs. V. Hurd, 27 Phil. 401 [1914]; Times, Inc. vs. Reyes, 39
SCRA 303 [1971].)
The above is true with respect to crimes punishable under
the Revised Penal Code. It is the responsible officer or officers
acting for the corporation who must of necessity be the ones to

484

TORTS

assume the criminal liability; otherwise, this liability as created
by law would be illusory, and the deterrent effect of the law,
negated. The corporate officer must have actually participated
in the commission of the criminal offense or violation of law
attributed to the corporation. (see Sia vs. People, 121 SCRA
655 [1983].)
(6) Liability for watered stocks. — Section 65 prohibits the issuance of watered stock to protect persons who may acquire stock
and the creditors of the corporation particularly those who may
become such on the faith of its outstanding capital stock being
fully paid. Under the provision, not only the corporate creditors
but also the corporation itself or any dissenting stockholder, for
and in behalf of the corporation in case the corporation refuses
to claim the difference not received, can set up the inadequacy
of the consideration for the issuance of stocks.

Where the corporation issues watered stock and thereby
assumes an ostensible capitalization in excess of its real assets,
the transaction necessarily involves the misleading of subsequent creditors, and whether done with that purpose actually
in mind or not, is at least a constructive fraud upon creditors.
Hence, it is held that recovery may be had by a creditor in such
case, even though the corporation itself has no cause of action
against the stockholders.

Some of the earlier decisions put the right of recovery in
such a case upon the so-called “trust fund doctrine.” In any view
of the matter, however, the creditors’ right of action to compel
the making good of the representation as to the corporation’s
capital is based on fraud, and the trust fund doctrine is only
another way of expressing the same underlying idea. (19 Am.
Jur. 2d 250.)
(7) Liability of stockholders of a close corporation for corporate
tort. — Section 100 considers as valid between the parties the
agreements mentioned therein when executed by the stockholders of a close corporation.

But the stockholders actively engaged in the management
of a close corporation shall be personally liable for corporate
torts unless the corporation has obtained reasonably adequate

TORT LIABILITY UNDER SPECIAL LAWS
Code of Commerce

485

liability insurance. (No. 5.) It has been held that the President
of a close corporation who actually manages the business falls
within the meaning of an “employer’’ as contemplated by the
Labor Code and may be held jointly and severally liable for
the obligations of the corporation to its illegally dismissed employees. Our jurisprudence is wanting as to the definite scope
of “corporate tort.’’ Essentially, tort consists in the violation of a
right given or the omission of a duty imposed by law. Simply
stated, tort is the breach of a legal duty. (Naguiat vs. National
Labor Relations Commission, 80 SCAD 502, 269 SCRA 553 [1997].)
Code of Commerce.
This is the same Code of Commerce of Spain which was
extended to the Philippines by Royal Decree. It became effective
as law on December 1, 1888. Various laws have been passed
which have either repealed, superseded or modified numerous
provisions thereof.
(1) Shipowners and ship agents. — The persons who participate in maritime commerce are the shipowners, ship agents,
the captain and master of the vessel, and the officers and crew
of the vessel.
Art. 586. The shipowner and the ship agent shall be civilly liable for the acts of the captain and for the obligations
contracted by the latter to repair, equip, and provision the
vessel, provided the creditor proves that the amount claimed
was invested therein.
By ship agent is understood the person intrusted with
the provisioning of a vessel, or who represents her in the
port in which she may be found.

Art. 587. The ship agent shall also be civilly liable for
the indemnities in favor of third persons which arise from
the conduct of the captain in the vigilance over the goods
which the vessel carried; but he may exempt himself therefrom by abandoning the vessel with all her equipment and
the freight he may have earned during the voyage.
Art. 588. Neither the shipowner nor the ship agent shall
be liable for the obligations contracted by the captain if the

486

TORTS

latter exceed his powers and privileges pertaining to him by
reason of his position or conferred upon him by the former.
However, if the amounts claimed wee used for the benefit
of the vessel, the owner or agent shall be liable.

(2) Captain and master of vessel. — The name of captain or
master is given, according to the kind of vessel, to the person
in charge of it. The first denomination is applied to those who
govern vessels that navigate the high seas or ships of large
dimensions and importance, although they be engaged in the
coastwise trade. Masters are those who command smaller ships
engaged exclusively in the coastwise trade.
For the purpose of maritime commerce, the words “captain’’
and “master’’ have the same meaning, both being the chiefs or
commanders of ships. (see Yu Con vs. Ipil, 41 Phil. 770 [1906].)

Art. 613. A captain who navigates for freight in common or on shares, may not make any separate transaction
for his own account, and should he do so the profits shall
belong to the other persons interested, and the losses shall
be borne by his alone.
Art. 614. A captain who, having agreed to make a voyage, fails to fulfill his undertaking, without being prevented
by fortuitous event or force majeure, shall indemnify all the
losses which his failure may cause, without prejudice to
criminal penalties which may be proper.

Art. 615. Without the consent of the ship agent, the captain may not have himself substituted by another person;
and should he do so, besides being liable for all the acts of
the substitute and bound to pay the indemnities mentioned
in the foregoing article, the captain as well as the substitute
may be discharged by the ship agent.

Art. 618. The captain shall be civilly liable to the ship
agent, and the latter to the third persons who may have
made contracts with the former.
1. For all the damage suffered by the vessel and her
cargo by reason of want of skill and negligence on his part.
If a misdemeanor or crime has been committed he shall be
liable in accordance with the Penal Code.

2. For all thefts and robberies committed by the crew,

TORT LIABILITY UNDER SPECIAL LAWS
Code of Commerce

487

reserving his right of action against the guilty parties.

3. For the losses, fines and confiscations imposed on
account of violation of laws and regulations of customs,
police, health, and navigation.
4. For the damage caused by mutinies on board the
vessel, or by reason of faults committed by the crew in the
service and defense of the same, if he does not prove that
he opportunely made full use of his authority to prevent
or avoid them.
5. For those arising by reason of a misuse of powers
and nonfulfillment of duties corresponding to him in accordance with Articles 610 and 612.
6. For those arising by reason of his going out of his
course or taking a course which, in the opinion of the officers of the vessel at a meeting attended by the shippers and
super-cargoes who may be on board, he should not have
taken without sufficient cause.

No exception whatsoever shall exempt him from this
liability.
7. For those arising by reason of his voluntarily entering a port other than his destination, outside of the cases
or without formalities referred to in Article 612.
8. For those arising by reason of the non-observance of
the provisions contained in the regulations for the situation
of lights and maneuvers for the purpose of preventing collisions.
(3) Officers and crew of vessels. —

Art. 631. The sailing mate shall be liable for all the
damage caused to the vessel and cargo by reason of his
negligence or want of skill, without prejudice to the criminal
liability which may arise, if a felony or misdemeanor has
been committed.
Art. 635. A sailor who has been contracted to serve on a
vessel cannot rescind his contract nor fail to comply therewith, except by reason of a legitimate impediment which

488

TORTS

may have occurred to him.

Neither can he pass from the service of one vessel to
another without obtaining the written permission of the
captain of the vessel on which he may be.
If, without obtaining said permission, the sailor who
has signed for one vessel should sign for another one, the
second contract shall be void, and the captain may choose
between forcing him to fulfill the service to which he first
bound himself or to look for a person to substitute him at
his expense.
Said sailor shall furthermore lose the wages on his first
contract to the benefit of the vessel for which he has formerly signed.

A captain who, knowing, that the sailor is in the service
of another vessel, should have made a new agreement with
him, without requiring of him the permission referred to in
the preceding paragraphs, shall be subsidiarly liable to the
captain of the vessel to which the sailor first belonged for
that part of the indemnity, referred to in the third paragraph
of this article, which the sailor could not pay.
Art. 647. The officers and the crew of the vessel shall be
free from all obligations contracted, if they deem it proper,
in the following cases:

1. If, before commencing the voyage, the captain attempts to change it, or if there occurs a naval war with the
nation to which the vessel was destined.

2. If a disease should break out and be officially declared
an epidemic in the port of destination.
3. If the vessel should change owner or captain.

(4) Charter party. — It is a contract by virtue of which the
owner or the agent of the vessel leases for a certain price the
whole or a portion of the vessel for the transportation of goods
or persons from one port to another. (Del Viso, p. 547.)
Art. 669. The shipowner or the captain shall observe in
charter parties the capacity of the vessel or that expressly
designated in her registry, a difference greater than 2 per

TORT LIABILITY UNDER SPECIAL LAWS
Code of Commerce

489

cent between that registered and her true capacity not being permissible.

Should the shipowner or the captain contract to carry a
greater amount of cargo than the vessel can hold, in view of
her tonnage they shall indemnify the shippers whose contract
they do not fulfill for the losses they may have caused them
by reason of their default, according to the cases, viz: x x x
Art. 671. After three-fifth of the vessel is loaded, the
person from whom she is chartered may not, without the
consent of the charterers or shippers, substitute the vessel
designated in the charter party with another one, under the
penalty of making himself thereby liable for all the damages
occurring during the voyage to the cargo of those who did
not consent to the substitution.
Art. 672. If the vessel has been chartered in whole, the
captain may not, without the consent of the charterer, accept cargo from any other person; and should he do so,
said charterer may compel him to unload it and pay the
damages suffered thereby.

Art. 673. The person from whom the vessel is chartered
shall be liable for all the damages caused to the charterer by
the voluntary delay of the captain in putting to sea according to the rules prescribed, provided he has been requested,
notarially or judicially, to put to sea at the proper time.

Art. 681. Should the charterer load goods different from
those mentioned at the time of executing the charter party,
without the knowledge of the person from whom the vessel
was chartered or of the captain, and should thereby give
rise to damage, by reason of confiscation, embargo, detention, or other causes, to the person from whom the vessel
was chartered or to the shippers, the person giving rise
thereto shall be liable with the value of his shipment and
furthermore with his property, for the full indemnity to all
those injured through his fault.
Art. 682. If the goods should have been shipped for
the purpose of illicit commerce, and were carried on board
with the knowledge of the person from whom the ves-

490

TORTS

sel was chartered or of the captain, the latter, jointly with
the owner of the goods, shall be liable for all the damage
which may be caused to other shippers; and even though
it may have been agreed upon, they cannot demand any
indemnity whatsoever from the chartered for the damage
caused to the vessel.
Art. 684. If the charterer, without the occurrence of
any of the cases of force majeure expressed in the foregoing
articles, should decide to unload his goods before arriving
at the port of destination, he shall pay the full freight, the
expenses of making a port at his request, and the damages
caused the other shippers, should there be any.

(5) Bill of lading. — It is an instrument in writing, signed by
a carrier on his agent, describing the freight so as to identify it,
stating the name of the consignor, the terms of the contract for
carriage, and agreeing or directing that the freight be delivered
to the order or assigns of a specified person at a specified place.
It operates both as a receipt and as a contract.
Art. 706. x x x
xxx xxx

The bill of lading may be issued to bearer, to order or in
the name of a specified person, and must be signed within
twenty-four hours after the cargo has been received on
board, the shipper being entitled to demand the unloading
thereof at the expense of the captain if the latter should not
sign it, and, in every case, an indemnity for the damage
suffered thereby.
Art. 711. The legitimate holder of a bill of lading, who
fails to present it to the captain of the vessel before the
unloading, obliging the latter by such omission to unload
the cargo and place it in deposit, shall be responsible for
the expenses of the warehousing and other expenses arising therefrom.
Art. 712. The captain may not himself change the destination of the goods. In admitting this change at the instance
of the shipper he must first take up the bills of lading he
may have issued, under penalty of being liable for the cargo
to the legitimate holder of the same.

TORT LIABILITY UNDER SPECIAL LAWS
Code of Commerce

491

Art. 713. If before the delivery of the cargo a new bill of
lading should be demanded of the captain, on the allegation
that the failure to present the previous ones is due to their
loss or to any other just cause, he shall be obliged to issue
it, provided that security for the value of the cargo is given
to his satisfaction; but, without changing the consignment
and stating therein the circumstances prescribed in the last
paragraph of Article 707, when dealing with the bills of lading referred to therein, under penalty, should he fail to do
so, of being liable for the said cargo if improperly delivered
through his fault.

Art. 714. If before the vessel puts to sea the captain
should die or should cease to hold his position due to any
cause, the shippers shall have the right to demand of the
new captain the ratification of the first bills of lading, and
the latter must do so, provided that all the copies previously
issued be presented or returned to him, and it should appear, from an examination of the cargo, that they are correct.

The expenses arising from the examination of the cargo
shall be defrayed by the ship agent, without prejudice to his
right of action against the first captain, if the latter ceases
to be such through his own fault. If the said examination
should not be made, it shall be understood that the new
captain accepts the cargo as it appears from the issued bills
of lading.
Art. 718. After the cargo has been delivered, the bills
of lading signed by the captain, or at least the copy under
which the delivery is made, shall be returned to him with
the receipt for the goods mentioned therein.

The delay on the part of the consignee shall make him
liable for the damages which such delay may cause the
captain.

(6) Collisions. — In its strict sense, it means the impact of two
vessels both moving and is distinguished from allision, which
designates the striking of a moving vessel against one that is
stationary. But collision is used in a broad sense to include allision, and perhaps another species of encounters between vessels.

Co. vs. Compañia De Moagens, 68 Fed. 258, 15 C.A.A. 370.)

Art. 826. If a vessel should collide with another, through
the fault, negligence, or want of skill of the captain, sailing
mate, or any other member of the complement, the owner
of the vessel at fault shall indemnify the damages suffered,
after an expert appraisal.

Art. 827. If the collision is imputable to both vessels,
each one shall suffer her own damage, and both shall be
solidarily liable for the damages occasioned to their cargoes.
Art. 828. The provisions of the preceding article are applicable to the case in which it cannot be determined which
of the two vessels has caused the collision.

Art. 829. In the cases above mentioned, the civil action of
the shipowner against the person causing the injury as well
as the criminal liabilities, which may be proper, are reserved.
Art. 830. If a vessel should collide with another through
fortuitous event or force majeure, each vessel and her cargo
shall suffer their own respective damage.

Art. 831. If a vessel should be forced by a third vessel
to collide with another, the shipowner of the third vessel
shall indemnify the damages caused, the captain thereof
being civily liable to said owner.
Art. 832. If, by reason of a storm or other cause of force
majeure, a vessel which is properly anchored and moored
should collide with those nearly, causing them damage, the
injury occasioned shall be considered as particular average
of the vessel run into.

Art. 833. A vessel which, upon being run into, sinks
immediately, as well as that which, having been obliged to
make a port to repair the damage caused by the collision, is
lost during the voyage or is obliged to be stranded in order
to be saved, shall be presumed as lost by reason of collision.

Art. 834. If the vessels colliding with each other should
have pilots on board discharging their duties at the time of
the collision, their presence shall not exempt the captains
from the liabilities they incur, but the latter shall have the

TORT LIABILITY UNDER SPECIAL LAWS
Labor Code of the Philippines

493

right to be indemnified by the pilots, without prejudice to
the criminal liability which the latter may incur.

Art. 837. The civil liability incurred by the shipowners in
the cases prescribed in this section, shall be understood as
limited to the value of the vessel with all her appurtenances
and freight earned during the voyage.

(7) Shipwreck. — In a popular sense, shipwreck means a ship
which has received injuries rendering her incapable of navigation. It is also defined as the loss of a vessel at sea, either by
being swallowed up by the waves, by running against a thing
at sea, or on the coast. (Cyclopedic Law Dictionary, pp. 791,
848.)

Art. 841. If the wreck or stranding should be caused
by the malice, negligence, or lack of skill of the captain,
or because the vessel put to sea was insufficiently repaired
and equipped, the ship agent or the shippers may demand
indemnity of the captain for the damage caused to the vessel or to the cargo by the accident, in accordance with the
provisions contained in Articles 610, 612, 614, and 621.
Art. 842. The goods saved from the wreck shall be
especially bound for the payment of the expenses of the
respective salvage, and the amount thereof must be paid
by the owners of the former before they are delivered to
them, and with preference over any other obligation if the
goods should be sold.

Art. 135. Discrimination prohibited. —

It shall be unlawful for any employer to discriminate

Unfair labor practices violate the constitutional right of
workers and employees to self-organization, are inimical to
the legitimate interests of both labor and management, including their right to bargain collectively and otherwise deal
with each other in an atmosphere of freedom and mutual
respect, disrupt industrial peace and hinder the promotion
of healthy and stable labor-management relations.

Consequently, unfair labor practices are not only violations of the civil rights of both labor and management but
are also criminal offenses against the State which shall be
subject to prosecution and punishment as herein provided.

Subject to the exercise by the President or by the Secretary
of Labor and Employment of the powers vested in them by
Articles 263 and 264 of this Code, the civil aspects of all cases
involving unfair labor practices, which may include claims
for actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages,

all cases involving unfair labor practices. They shall resolve
such cases within thirty (30) calendar days from the time
they are submitted for decision.
Recovery of civil liability in the administrative proceedings shall bar recovery under the Civil Code.

No criminal prosecution under this Title may be instituted without a final judgment, finding that an unfair labor
practice was committed, having been first obtained in the
preceding paragraph. During the pendency of such administrative proceedings, the running of the period of prescription
of the criminal offense herein penalized shall be considered
interrupted: Provided, however, That the final judgment in the
administrative proceedings shall not be binding in the criminal case nor be considered as evidence of guilt but merely
as proof of compliance of the requirements herein set forth.

that may be committed by employers and labor organizations, respectively.
(6) Money claims. —

Art. 291. Money claims.

Intellectual Property Code.
(1) Laws repealed. — The Civil Code recognizes the special
laws on copyright and patent as well as on trademarks and
trade names. (Art. 522.) They are now governed by R.A. No.

which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause
mistake, or to deceive shall be liable in a civil action for
infringement by the registrant for the remedies hereinafter
set forth: Provided, That the infringement takes place at the
moment any of the acts stated in Subsection 155.1 or this
subsection are committed regardless of whether there is actual sale of goods or services using the infringing material.

or in the event such measure of damages cannot be readily
ascertained with reasonable certainty, then the court may
award as damages a reasonable percentage based upon the

Chapter 10
CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING FROM DELICTS
Cause of action for fault or negligence.
A single act or omission, there being fault or negligence,
which causes harm or injury to another, may give rise to one
cause of action, or two, or more separate causes of action.

(1) The act or omission may constitute quasi-delict or tort
(culpa aquiliana), or breach of contract (culpa contractual), or delict
(culpa criminal) only.

(2) The same act or omission may result in two or all of
them. If a contractual obligation is breached by tort, the injured
party has the option to bring an action for damages on either
ground, allowing the rules on quasi-delict or contract, as the
case may be, to apply.
(3) If the act or omission also constitutes a crime, the injured
party can pursue his claim for indemnity in the criminal action
instituted against the offender, or in an independent civil action
on the theory of quasi-delict.
(a) In a criminal case, the civil action for the recovery
of civil liability arising from the offense charged, shall be
deemed instituted with the criminal action unless the offended party waives the civil action, reserves the right to
institute it separately, or institutes the civil action prior to
the criminal action. (Sec. 1[a], Rule 111, Rules of Court.)

(b) However, in the cases provided in Articles 32, 33, 34
(Chap. 4.) and 2176 (Chap. 6.), an independent civil action
may be brought by the offended party. It shall proceed independently of the criminal action and shall require only a
preponderance of evidence. (Sec. 3, Rule 110.) The right to
519

520

TORTS

file an independent civil action is a substantive right. It may
be availed of by the offended party even in the absence of
prior reservation in the criminal action. Reservation is necessary in a criminal action only when the intention is to claim
damages based on the criminal liability of the accused.

Incidentally, a crime may be a felony defined and penalized in the Revised Penal Code, or an offense punishable by
a special law.
Dual character of crimes.

From the standpoint of its effect, a crime has a dual character
as it offends two entities and produces two kinds of injury and
two distinct liabilities.

(1) Social injury. — A crime is an offense against the State
because of the disturbance of the social order. The injury is
vindicated through the imposition of the corresponding penalty
prescribed by law; and

(2) Personal injury. — It is an offense against the private
person injured by the crime, unless it involves a crime where
no civil liability arises on the part of the offender. The injury
is indemnified through the payment of damages. (see Occeña
vs. Icamina, 181 SCRA 328 [1990].)

The dual character of a crime obtains whether the crime
committed is public or private (see Garcia vs. Court of Appeals,
260 SCRA 678 [1997].), or punishable under the Revised Penal
Code or special laws. (see Banal vs. Tadeo, 156 SCRA 325 [1987].)
Differences between civil and criminal
actions.

The principal differences between the criminal action and
the civil action arising from a crime are:

(1) The first is primarily intended for public vindication
of an outrage against the sovereignty of the States and the
punishment of the offender, while the latter is for the defense
of a private right or interest and the restitution, reparation, or
indemnification of his damage or injury;
(2) In the first, the plaintiff is the State, while in the second,

CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING FROM DELICTS

521

it is a private person;

(3) In the first, the guilt of the accused must be proven
beyond reasonable doubt, while in the second, the plaintiff
is required to establish his claim only by a preponderance of
evidence; and
(4) In the first, the cause of action is based on a crime or
felony, while in the second, on any of the other sources of obligation.
The criminal action has thus a dual purpose, namely, the
punishment of the offender which is its dominant and primordial
objective, and indemnity of the offended party. The civil action
is merely incidental to the conviction of the accused. The parties
in the criminal action are the People of the Philippines as the
plaintiff and the accused. The private complainant is merely
a witness for the State on the criminal aspect of the action. In
the civil action, the parties are the private complainant as the
plaintiff and the accused as the defendant.
Civil liability of a person guilty of a crime.
As a general rule, a person criminally liable for a crime is
also civilly liable, and if there is no criminal liability, there is
also no civil liability.
(1) Legal basis of civil liability. — A crime is an act or omission punishable by law, either by the Revised Penal Code or
by special laws. Acts or omissions punishable by the Revised
Penal Code are called “felonies.’’

The following provisions of the Civil Code assume that
the crime committed has also caused damage or injury to a
private party.
“Art. 20. Every person who, contrary to law, willfully
or negligently causes damage to another, shall indemnify
the latter for the same.

Art. 1161. Civil obligations arising from criminal offenses
shall be governed by the penal laws, subject to the provisions
of Article 2177, and of the pertinent provisions of Chapter
2, Preliminary Title on Human Relations, and of Title XVIII
of this Book, regulating damages.

522

TORTS

Art. 2177. Responsibility for fault or negligence under
the preceding article is entirely separate and distinct from
the civil liability arising from negligence under the Penal
Code. But the plaintiff cannot recover damages twice for
the same act or omission of the defendant.’’
Underlying the fundamental postulate of substantive law
that “every person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly
liable’’ (Art. 100, RPC.1), is “the traditional theory that when a
person commits a crime he offends two entities, namely, (a) the
society in which he lives in or the political entity called the State
whose law he had violated; and (b) the individual member of
that society whose person, right, honor, chastity or property was
actually or directly injured or damaged by the same punishable
act or omission.’’ (Banal vs. Tadeo, 156 SCRA 325 [1985].)

(2) Moral obligation to repair. — “Many legal scholars treat
as a misconception or fallacy the generally accepted notion
that the civil liability actually arises from the crime when, in
the ultimate analysis, it does not. While an act or omission is
felonious because it is punishable by law, it gives rise to civil
liability not so much because it is a crime but because it caused
damage to another. Viewing things pragmatically, we can readily see that what gives rise to the civil liability is really the
obligation and the moral duty of everyone to repair or make
whole the damage caused to another by reason of his own act
or omission, done intentionally or negligently, whether or not
the same be punishable by law.’’ (Ibid.)
(3) Existence of damage or injury. — “In other words, criminal
liability will give rise to civil liability only if the same felonious
act or omission results in damage or injury to another and is the
direct and proximate cause thereof. Damage or injury to another
is evidently the foundation of the civil action. Such is not the case
in criminal actions for, to be criminally liable, it is enough that the
act or omission complained of is punishable, regardless of whether
or not it also causes material damage to another.’’ (Ibid.)
(4) Nature of civil liability. — Every person who, contrary
to law, wilfully or negligently causes damage to another, shall
indemnify the latter for the same. (Art.2 20.)
Revised Penal Code.

CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING FROM DELICTS

523

“Regardless, therefore, of whether or not a special law so
provides, indemnification of the offended party may be had
on account of the damage, loss or injury directly suffered as
a consequence of the wrongful act of another. The indemnity
which a person is sentenced to pay forms an integral part of
the penalty imposed by law for the commission of a crime.
(Quemel vs. Court of Appeals, 22 SCRA 44, citing Bagtas vs.
Director of Prisons, 84 Phil. 692.) Every crime gives rise to
a penal or criminal action for the punishment of the guilty
party, and also to civil action for the restitution of the thing,
repair of the damage, and indemnification for the losses.
(United States vs. Bernardo, 19 Phil. 265.)
Indeed, one cannot disregard the private party who suffered the offense committed against him. Not only the State
but the offended party too is entitled to relief as a member
of the public which the law seeks to protect.’’ (Banal vs.
Tadeo, supra.)

The indemnity which is civil in nature, is due to the offended
party and not to the State. It assumes that damages resulted
from the commission of the crime. Civil liability arising from an
offense may be compromised or waived, but not the criminal
action for the imposition of the legal penalty. (Art. 2034; Art.
23, RPC.) Under Article 1288 of the Civil Code, compensation
or set-off is not allowed if one of the debts consists of civil liability arising from a penal offense.
(5) Proof of damages. — The offended party must prove the
damages sustained by him in the criminal action. Article 100 of the
Revised Penal Code presupposes that damages actually resulted
from the offense. In case of homicide, however, the law requires
without proof, additional payment of a fixed amount of P3,000 as
damages to the heirs of the deceased. (Art. 2206.) The indemnity
has been increased by the Supreme Court to P50,000.00.
The damages that may be recovered by the offended party
in the civil action are those provided in the Revised Penal Code.
(Arts. 104-107 thereof, infra.) and the Civil Code.
(6) Allegation of damages. — It has been held that a plea of
guilty to a complaint or information which contains no allegation of facts upon which civil liability may be predicated does
not authorize an award of indemnity. (Higino vs. Santiago, 35

524

TORTS

Phil. 20 [1916].) Under Article 100, however, when an information or criminal complaint is filed, even without any allegation
of damages and the intention to prove and recover them, it is
understood that the offender is liable for them. (People vs. Celerico, 67 Phil. 185 [1938]; People vs. Oraza, 83 Phil. 633 [1949].)
If the trial court fails to make a finding as to the accused’s
civil liability, the appellate court will remand the record to it
so that such finding may be made. (U.S. vs. Heery, 25 Phil.
600 [1913].)
Exceptions to the general rule.
(1) Criminally liable but not civilly liable. — Article 100 of the
Revised Penal Code has exceptions. There are many crimes the
commission of which is generally not attended by any damage
or injury to another. Among them are contempt of court (Sec.
1, Rule 71, Rules of Court.), treason (Art. 114, RPC.), espionage
(Art. 117, Ibid.), piracy and mutiny on the high seas or in Philippine waters (Art. 122, Ibid.), rebellion or insurrection (Art.
134, Ibid.), coup d’etat (Art. 134-A, Ibid.), gambling and betting
(Arts. 195, 197, 198, Ibid.), illegal cockfighting (Art. 199, Ibid.),
infidelity in the custody of prisoners (Art. 223, Ibid.), abortion
practiced by the woman herself (Art. 258, Ibid.), challenging to
a duel (Art. 261, Ibid.), etc.
(2) Civilly liable but not criminally liable. — Civil liability may
exist although a person is held not criminally liable. This is true
in the case of persons exempt from criminal liability under Article 12 of the Revised Penal Code, employees, etc. subsidiarily
liable under Articles 102 and 103 thereof (infra.), and relatives
mentioned in Article 332 of the same Code involving the crime
of theft, swindling, or malicious mischief committed or caused
mutually by them.

Persons who may not be criminally liable may also be civilly
liable where an accused is acquitted on ground of reasonable
doubt (Art. 29, Chap. 4.), in cases of independent civil actions
(Arts. 32, 33, and 34, Ibid.), and in civil actions to recover damages on the theory of quasi-delict. (Art. 2177, Chap. 6.)
Justifications for separate civil action to enforce

CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING FROM DELICTS

525

civil liability arising from a criminal offense.
As elucidated by Justice Bocobo in Barredo vs. Garcia (73
Phil. 607 [1942].):
(1) Separate individuality of culpa aquiliana. — “The foregoing
authorities clearly demonstrate the separate individuality of
cuasi-delitos or culpa aquiliana under the Civil Code. Specifically
they show that there is a distinction between civil liability arising from criminal negligence (governed by the Penal Code) and
responsibility for fault or negligence under Articles 1902 to 1910
[now 2176 to 2193, with the new provisions] of the Civil Code,
and that the same negligent act may produce either a civil liability arising from a crime under the Penal Code, or a separate
responsibility for fault or negligence under Articles 1902 to 1910
of the Civil Code. Still more concretely, the authorities above
cited render it inescapable to conclude that the employer — in
this case the defendant-petitioner — is primarily and directly
liable under Article 1903 [now 2180] of the Civil Code.
The legal provisions, authors, and cases already invoked
should ordinarily be sufficient to dispose of this case. But inasmuch as we are announcing doctrines that have been little
understood in the past, it might not be inappropriate to indicate
their foundations.’’

(2) Indemnification not only through the principle of civil liability
arising from a crime. — “Firstly, the Revised Penal Code in Article
365 punishes not only reckless but also simple negligence. If we
were to hold that Articles 1902 to 1910 of the Civil Code refer
only to fault or negligence not punished by law, according to the
literal import of Article 1093 [now 1162] of the Civil Code, the
legal institution of culpa aquiliana would have very little scope
and application in actual life. Death or injury to persons and
damage to property through any degree of negligence — even
the slightest — would have to be indemnified only through the
principle of civil liability arising from a crime.
In such a state of affairs, what sphere would remain for
cuasi delito or culpa aquiliana? We are loath to impute to the
lawmaker any intention to bring about a situation so absurd
and anomalous. Nor are we, in the interpretation of the laws,

526

TORTS

disposed to uphold the letter that killeth rather than the spirit
that giveth life. We will not use the literal meaning of the law
to smother and render almost lifeless a principle of such ancient
origin and such full-grown development as culpa aquiliana or
cuasi-delito, which is conserved and made enduring in Articles
1902 to 1910 of the Spanish Civil Code.’’

(3) Preponderance of evidence, not proof of guilt beyond reasonable
doubt, to establish liability for damages. — “Secondly, to find the
accused guilty in a criminal case, proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt is required, while in a civil case, preponderance of
evidence is sufficient to make the defendant pay in damages.
There are numerous cases of criminal negligence which can
not be shown beyond reasonable doubt, but can be proved by
a preponderance of evidence. In such cases, the defendant can
and should be made responsible in a civil action under Articles
1902 to 1910 of the Civil Code. Otherwise, there would be many
instances of unvindicated civil wrongs. Ubi jus ibi remedium.’’
(4) More expeditious remedy to obtain relief for civil wrongs. —
“Thirdly, to hold that there is only one way to make defendant’s
liability effective, and that is, to sue the driver and exhaust his
(the latter’s) property first, would be tantamount to compelling
the plaintiff to follow a devious and cumbersome method of
obtaining relief. True, there is such a remedy under our laws,
but there is also a more expeditious way, which is based on
the primary and direct responsibility of the defendant under
Article 1903 of the Civil Code.
Our view of the law is more likely to facilitate remedy for
civil wrongs, because the procedure indicated by the defendant
is wasteful and productive of delay, it being a matter of common knowledge that professional drivers of taxis and similar
public conveyances usually do not have sufficient means with
which to pay damages. Why then, should the plaintiff be required in all cases to go through this roundabout, unnecessary,
and probably useless procedure? In construing the laws, courts
have endeavored to shorten and facilitate the pathways of right
and justice.’’

CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING FROM DELICTS

527

(5) Character and efficacy of the action for culpa aquiliana. —
“Fourthly, because of the broad sweep of the provisions of both
the Penal Code and the Civil Code on this subject, which has
given rise to the overlapping or concurrence of spheres already
discussed, and for lack of understanding of the character and
efficacy of the action for culpa aquiliana, there has grown up a
common practice to seek damages only by virtue of the civil
responsibility arising from a crime, forgetting that there is another remedy, which is by invoking Articles 1902-1910 of the
Civil Code. Although this habitual method is allowed by our
laws, it has nevertheless rendered practically useless and nugatory the more expeditious and effective remedy based on culpa
aquiliana or culpa extra-contractual.’’
(6) Civil action independent of criminal prosecution. — “In the
present case, we are asked to help perpetuate this usual course.
But we believe it is high time we pointed out to the harm done
by such practice and to restore the principle of responsibility
for fault or negligence under articles 1902 et seq. of the Civil
Code to its full rigor. It is high time we caused the stream of
quasi-delict or culpa aquiliana to flow on its own natural channel, so that its waters may no longer be diverted into that of a
crime under the Penal Code.

This will, it is believed, make for the better safeguarding
of private rights because it re-establishes an ancient and additional remedy, and for the further reason that an independent
civil action, not depending on the issues, limitations and results
of a criminal prosecution, and entirely directed by the party
wronged or his counsel, is more likely to secure adequate and
efficacious remedy.’’
Prosecution of civil action for damages
arising from a criminal offense.
Rule 111 (Prosecution of Civil Action) of the Rules of Court
provides:

“Section 1. Institution of criminal and civil actions. — (a)
When a criminal action is instituted, the civil action for the
recovery of civil liability arising from the offense charged
shall be deemed instituted with the criminal action unless

528

the offended party waives the civil action, reserves the right
to institute it separately or institutes the civil action prior
to the criminal action.

The reservation of the right to institute separately the
civil action shall be made before the prosecution starts
presenting its evidence and under circumstances affording
the offended party a reasonable opportunity to make such
reservation. x x x x x x
(b) The criminal action for violation of Batas Pambansa
Blg. 22 shall be deemed to include the corresponding civil
action. No reservation to file such civil action separately
shall be allowed. x x x x x x
Where the civil action has been filed separately and trial
thereof has not yet commenced, it may be consolidated with
the criminal action upon application with the court trying
the latter case. If the application is granted, the trial of both
actions shall proceed in accordance with section 2 of this
Rule governing consolidation of the civil and criminal actions. (Cir. 57-97)

Sec. 2. When separate civil action is suspended. — After the
criminal action has been commenced, the separate civil action
arising therefrom cannot be instituted until final judgment
has been entered in the criminal action.
If the criminal action is filed after the said civil action
has already been instituted, the latter shall be suspended
in whatever stage it may be found before judgment on the
merits. The suspension shall last until final judgment is rendered in the criminal action. Nevertheless, before judgment
on the merits is rendered in the civil action, the same may,
upon motion of the offended party, be consolidated with
the criminal action in the court trying the criminal action.
In case of consolidation, the evidence already adduced in
the civil action shall be deemed automatically reproduced
in the criminal action without prejudice to the right of the
prosecution to cross-examine the witnesses presented by
the offended party in the criminal case and of the parties to
present additional evidence. The consolidated criminal and
civil actions shall be tried and decided jointly.

CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING FROM DELICTS

529

During the pendency of the criminal action, the running
of the period of prescription of the civil action which cannot be instituted separately or whose proceeding has been
suspended shall be tolled. (n)

The extinction of the penal action does not carry with
it extinction of the civil action. However, the civil action
based on delict may be deemed extinguished if there is a
finding in a final judgment in the criminal action that the
act or omission from which the civil liability may arise did
not exist. (2a)

Sec. 3. When civil action may proceed independently. — In
the cases provided in Articles 32, 33, 34 and 2176 of the
Civil Code of the Philippines, the independent civil action
may be brought by the offended party. It shall proceed independently of the criminal action and shall require only a
preponderance of evidence. In no case, however, may the
offended party recover damages twice for the same act or
omission charged in the criminal action. (3a)

Sec. 4. Effect of death on civil actions. — The death of the
accused after arraignment and during the pendency of the
criminal action shall extinguish the civil liability arising from
the delict. However, the independent civil action instituted
under section 3 of this Rule or which thereafter is instituted
to enforce liability arising from other sources of obligation
may be continued against the estate or legal representative of
the accused after proper substitution or against said estate,
as the case may be. The heirs of the accused may be substituted for the deceased without requiring the appointment
of an executor or administrator and the court may appoint
a guardian ad litem for the minor heirs.
The court shall forthwith order said legal representative
or representatives to appear and be substituted within a
period of thirty (30) days from notice.
A final judgment entered in favor of the offended party
shall be enforced in the manner especially provided in
these Rules for prosecuting claims against the estate of the
deceased.

530

TORTS

If the accused dies before arraignment, the case shall be
dismissed without prejudice to any civil action the offended
party may file against the estate of the deceased. (n)

Sec. 5. Judgment in civil action not a bar. — A final judgment rendered in a civil action absolving the defendant
from civil liability is not a bar to a criminal action against
the defendant for the same act or omission subject of the
civil action.’’2
Application of Rule 111.

The general rule is that “every person criminally liable
for a felony is also civilly liable.’’ (Art. 100, RPC.) However,
a person may be criminally liable and yet is not civilly liable
as when no damage or injury is caused to another’s person or
property by the punishable act or omission, or the crime is one
the commission of which is generally not attended by damage
or injury to another. (supra.)
The above provisions of Rule 111 of the Rules of Court, except
Section 3 and the second sentence of Section 4, apply only when
the person charged with an offense, if convicted, will or may also
be civilly liable therefor. This is evident from the Title of Rule III,
“Prosecution of Civil Action,’’ and the use of the phrases “the
civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from the offense’’ in Section 1, “the separate civil action arising therefrom’’
[criminal action], and “civil action based on delict’’ in Section 2,
and “the civil liability arising from the delict’’ in Section 4.
Institution of criminal and civil actions.
(1) When civil action deemed impliedly instituted. — Under Section 1, above, the general rule is that “when a criminal action
is instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability
arising from the offense charged shall be deemed instituted
with the criminal action x x x.’’
(a) Reason for rule. — The obvious reason is that the
plaintiff and the defendant in the civil action and the in-

2
The other provisions under Rule 111 are Section 6 (Suspension by reason of prejudicial
question) and Section 7 (Elements of prejudicial question). They are discussed in Chapter
4 (Torts Involving Human Relations).

CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING FROM DELICTS

531

jured party and offender in the criminal action are the same,
and both actions are based on the same punishable act or
omission charged, although the liabilities of the offender
and the civil and criminal actions are distinct and separate
even when they are instituted together. Thus, it has been
held that civil liability generally accompanies criminal liability because every person liable criminally is also liable
for reparation of damage and for indemnification of the
harm done although there may be civil liability even when
the perpetrator is held to be exempt from criminal liability.
(U.S. vs. Baggay, 20 Phil. 142 [1911].)
(b) Allegation of damages. — When a complaint or information is filed, even without any allegation of damages, it
is to be understood that the offender is liable for them, and
that the offended party has the right to prove and claim
for them. (People vs. Oraza, 83 Phil. 633 [1949]; People vs.
Celerico, 67 Phil. 185 [1938]; U.S. vs. Heery, 25 Phil. 600
[1913]; supra.)

(c) Waiver of separate civil action. — The civil action to
recover damages for the act or omission complained of is
merged with the criminal action to punish the offender.
The judgment in the civil action deemed instituted with
the criminal action will bar the subsequent filing of a “civil
action for the recovery of civil liability arising from the
offense charged.’’ By electing to recover damages on the
basis of the civil liability arising from the offense charged,
the offended party is deemed to have waived his right to
file a civil action separately from the criminal action for the
same offense.

(2) When civil action not instituted with criminal action. —
There is no simultaneous institution with the criminal action
when the offended party:
(a) waives the civil action; or

(b) reserves the right to institute the civil action separately with the criminal action; or
(c) institutes the civil action prior to the criminal action.
(Sec. 1[a], Rule 111.)

532

TORTS

Under Article 30 of the Civil Code (Chap. 4.), the injured
party is allowed to bring a separate civil action to demand civil
liability arising from a criminal offense before the criminal action is filed.
(3) Reservation of right to institute civil action separately. — The
reservation shall be made before the prosecution starts presenting its evidence, unless, under the circumstances, the offended
party had no reasonable opportunity to make such reservation,
in which case the reservation may be made thereafter.

(a) Where no reservation made. — In the absence of reservation, unless there is waiver or prior institution (which may be
considered as an implied reservation) of the civil action, said
civil action shall be deemed instituted with the criminal action.

In a case, the Chief of Police filed a criminal case of
reckless imprudence, while the victims of a vehicular accident were in a hospital for treatment, without making
a reservation as to the civil aspect, it was held that under
the peculiar circumstances of the case, the civil action filed
by the victims despite the pendency of the criminal action
should be allowed. Nevertheless, they have the “substantive’’ right to file an independent civil action as ordained
by the Civil Code. (Garcia vs. Florido, 52 SCRA 430 [1973];
see Abellana vs. Marave, 57 SCRA 106 [1974].)
(b) Where reservation made. — When proper reservation
is made, the trial court is deprived of jurisdiction over
the civil action and, with it, the jurisdiction to award any
damage in the criminal action since there is no more “civil
liability arising from the offense charged.’’ By reserving his
right to institute a separate civil action, the offended party
may subsequently file a civil action based on the offense
charged or on quasi-delict, or an independent civil action
in the cases provided in Articles 32, 33, 34 and 2176 of the
Civil Code. (Sec. 3, Rule 111.)
Civil actions which do not arise from the offense charged
need not, of course, be reserved, nor are they suspended
upon the filing of the criminal action.

(c) Bouncing Checks Law. — Reservation to file a civil
action separately from the criminal action for violation of

CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING FROM DELICTS

533

said law (B.P. Blg. 22.) is not allowed. (Sec. 1[b], Ibid.)

(4) Suspension of separate civil action. — This is provided in
Section 2 (par. 2.) above.

The injured party may file the civil action for damages arising
from the offense charged before or after the institution of the
criminal action. If the criminal action has already been brought,
the separate civil action arising therefrom cannot be instituted;
if the criminal action is filed after said civil action has already
been instituted, the latter shall be suspended.
Preference is given by the rule to the criminal action where
both actions are based on the same offense because the judgment in the criminal action may affect the prosecution of the
civil action based on the offense charged. This rule is not applicable to independent civil actions which may brought by the
offended party. (Sec. 3, Ibid.)
Effect of extinction of penal action.
(1) General rule. — The extinction of the criminal action does
not necessarily carry with it the extinction of the civil action.
(Sec. 2.), last par., Ibid.) Similarly, the extinction of the civil action
as a consequence of a final judgment absolving the defendant
from civil liability does not preclude a criminal action against
him for the same act or omission. (Sec. 5, Ibid.)

The reason is that the two actions are different from each
other, as to purpose, parties, degree of proof required, and cause
of action. (supra.) To sustain a claim for damages in a civil action
for an act or omission, the plaintiff need only prove the same
by a preponderance of evidence it being immaterial whether or
not a crime was committed. To convict an accused in a criminal
action, his guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. In
a criminal action, the purpose of the inquiry is to determine
whether or not a crime was committed, it being immaterial
whether or not it caused damage or injury to another.

(2) Finding as to the civil liability. — The acquittal of the accused may also relieve him of his civil liability arising from the
offense charged depending on the ground of acquittal. If the civil
liability in a criminal case springs from, or is a consequence of,

534

TORTS

the criminal liability, an accused acquitted of a crime, cannot
be civilly liable (see U.S. vs. Bernardo, 19 Phil. 265 [1911].)
However, in order that the civil action may be deemed
extinguished, there must be “a finding in the final judgment
in the criminal action that the act or omission from which the
civil liability may arise did not exist.’’

(3) Civil action based on delict/quasi-delict. — The “extinction
of the civil action’’ contemplated in Section 2, refers exclusively
to “civil action based on delict,’’ and not to an independent civil
action based on an act or omission (though punishable as crime)
considered as a quasi-delict and not as a crime. In such case,
the civil action is not extinguished even if there is an express
finding or declaration in the final judgment that the accused in
the criminal case is innocent or has not committed the offense
charged. More so, if the acquittal is based on reasonable doubt
(Art. 29.)

The substantive law on the matter (Arts. 32, 33, 34, and
2176.) and Section 3, Rule 111 above, are very clear that the civil
action shall be separate and distinct from the criminal action
and shall proceed independently of and, therefore, regardless
of the result of the latter.
Effect of death on civil actions.
This is provided in Section 4 above.

(1) If the accused dies before arraignment, the criminal case
shall be dismissed without prejudice to the right of the offended
party to file a civil action to recover damages against the estate
of the deceased.
(2) If he dies after arraignment and during the pendency of
the criminal action, the civil liability arising from the delict or
offense charged shall be extinguished.

(3) Where an independent civil action has been instituted,
the same may be continue against the estate or against legal
representative of the deceased after proper substitution, whether
the death of the accused occurred before or after arraignment.3
Upon the death of the accused pending appeal of his conviction, the criminal action is extinguished inasmuch as there is

CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING FROM DELICTS

535

no longer a defendant to stand as the accused. The civil action
instituted therein for recovery of civil liability ex delicto is ipso
facto extinguished grounded as it is on the criminal. (People
vs. Bayotas, 236 SCRA 239 [1994]; De Guzman vs. People, 413
SCRA 215 [2003].)
Injured party given option to file
an independent civil action.
(1) Two kinds of civil liabilities arising from delicts. — Before,
civil liabilities arising from a felony or crime or delict were
governed by the penal laws and the provisions of the Rules of
Court on criminal procedure. Under the new Civil Code and
Rule 111 of the Rules of Court, two kinds of said civil liabilities
are now recognized.
(a) Those arising from wrongful acts or omissions punishable as a felony or crime; and
(b) Those arising from same punishable acts or omissions
for which an independent civil action may be maintained
on the theory of quasi-delict.

(2) Governing laws. — The first is governed by the pertinent
provisions of the Revised Penal Code and special laws, and
Rule 111 of the Rules of Court; the second, by the pertinent
provisions of the Civil Code (see Chaps. 4 and 6.), Sections 3
and 4 of Rule 111, and the provisions of the Rules of Court on
civil procedure dealing on ordinary civil actions.

(3) Exclusive right to make election. — In No (1, b), above, the
acts or omissions punishable as a crime or felony are considered not as such, but as quasi-delicts for purposes of bringing
an independent civil action. They are to be distinguished from
acts or omissions not punishable by law, causing damage to
another, there being fault or negligence (see Art. 2176.) which
are the real, true, or pure quasi-delicts.
Under the former rule, where the act or omission is penal-

As to criminal liability, the death of the convict extinguishes the personal penalties,
but liability for pecuniary penalties is extinguished only when the death of the offender
occurs before final judgment. (Art. 89[1], Revised Penal Code.)

536

TORTS

ized by law, no civil action for the same act or omission may
be brought. Now, the injured party is given by the Civil Code,
the right to choose between a civil action for damages arising
from the offense charged or without need of making a reservation, an independent civil action arising from the same offense,
subject to the proscription against recovering damages twice for
the same punishable act or omission (Art. 2177.)
(4) Effect of exercise of right. — The election of either cause
of action is deemed a waiver of the other. In other words, the
injured party is allowed to freely determine for himself whether
to consider the same punishable act or omission as a delict or
as a quasi-delict, and to bring his civil action based on either.
Ways of instituting civil action for damages
caused by wrongful conduct.
Based on the provisions of the Civil Code (Arts. 32, 33, 34
and 2176.) and Rule 111 of the Rules of Court, there are actually
five (5) ways of instituting the civil action for the recovery of
damages due to fault or negligence, to wit:
(1) Civil action for recovery of civil liability arising from the
offense charged, deemed instituted with the criminal action;

(2) Civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from
the offense charged, separately instituted, the right to institute
separately having been reserved in the criminal action;
(3) Civil action for the recovery of civil liability for the same
offense, instituted prior to the criminal action (Sec. 1[a], Rule
111.);

(4) Civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from
the offense charged, the injured party opting to consider the
punishable act or omission as a quasi-delict; and
(5) Civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from
a non-punishable act or omission. (Sec. 3, Ibid.)

The offended party may waive, in the criminal action, the
civil action for the recovery of civil liability arising from the
offense charged. (Sec. 1[a], Ibid.) The waiver will cover only civil
actions Nos. (1) and (2) unless it clearly appears that the inten-

CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING FROM DELICTS

537

tion is to include also civil action No. (3) or No. (4), or both.
Rule 111 has no application, of course, to civil action No. (5).
Circumstances affecting civil liability
of persons criminally liable.
(1) Persons liable. — The persons criminally liable for grave
and less grave felonies are the principals, accomplices, and accessories but only the principals and accomplices are criminally
liable for light felonies. (Art. 16, RPC.) These persons are defined
in Articles 17, 18, and 19 of the Revised Penal Code. They are
the same persons who must respond for the civil liability arising from the felony they are found guilty of.
Only natural persons are criminally liable.

(2) Four kinds of circumstances. — The circumstances modifying or affecting criminal liability as well as civil liability are:

(a) Justifying circumstances, namely: 1) self-defense, 2)
defense of relatives, 3) defense of strangers, 4) avoidance of
a greater evil or injury, 5) fulfillment of a duty or exercise
of a right or office, and 6) obedience to a lawful order (Art.
11, Ibid.);
(b) Exempting circumstances, namely: 1) imbecility or insanity, 2) being under a nine (9) years of age; 3) being over
nine (9) and under below 15 years of age unless he has acted
with discernment, 4) accident without fault or intention of
causing it, 5) irresistible force, 6) uncontrollable fear, and 6)
some lawful or insuperable cause (Art. 12, Ibid.);

(c) Mitigating circumstances, namely: 1) incomplete justification and exemption, 2) being under 18 years or over 70
years, 3) lack of intention to commit the wrong, 4) sufficient
provocation or threat, 5) immediate vindication of a grave
offense, 6) passion or obsfuscation, 7) voluntary surrender or
plea of guilty, 8) physical defect or illness, and 9) analogous
circumstances (Art. 13, Ibid.); and
(d) Aggravating circumstances, namely: 1) taking advantage
of public position, 2) contempt public authorities, 3) disregard
of rank, age or sex, 4) dwelling, 5) abuse of confidence or

538

TORTS

obvious ungratefulness, 6) commission of crime in certain
places, 7) nocturnity, uninhabited place and band, 8) calamity or misfortune, 9) aid of armed men, 10) recidivism, 10)
reiteration, 11) price, promise or reward, 12) innundation, fire,
etc., 13) evident premeditation, 14) craft, fraud, or disguise,
15) abuse of superior strength, 16) treachery, 17) ignominy,
18) unlawful entry, 19) breaking of doors, etc., 20) aid of
minors under 15 years, or use of motor vehicles, and 21)
cruelty. (Art. 14, Ibid.)

(4) Effect on liability. — A circumstance justifying the act,
exempts the offender from both criminal and civil liability, while
an exempting circumstance relieves the offender from criminal
liability but he may be civilly liable under Article 101 of the
Revised Penal Code. (infra.) Mitigating circumstances lessen the
imposable penalty, while aggravating circumstances increase the
penalty.
In crimes, the damages (Part II.) to be adjudicated to the
injured party may be respectively increased or lessened according to the aggravating or mitigating circumstances. (Art.
2204.) Exemplary damages as a part of the civil liability may
be imposed when the crime was committed with one or more
aggravating circumstances (Art. 2230.)
Civil liability of persons exempt
from criminal liability.
Exemption from criminal liability (supra.) does not include
exemption from civil liability, except in the following cases:

(1) Insane, imbecile, or minor. — The civil liability for acts
committed by an imbecile or insane person, and by a person
under nine years of age, or over nine but under fifteen years
of age, who has acted without discernment (Art. 12[1, 2, 3],
RPC.), shall devolve upon those having such a person under
their legal authority or control, unless it appears that there was
no fault or negligence on their part.
Should there be no person having such insane, imbecile, or
minor under his authority, legal guardianship, or control, or if
such person be insolvent, said insane, imbecile, or minor shall
respond with their own property, excepting property exempt

CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING FROM DELICTS

539

from execution, in accordance with the civil law.

(2) Person benefited by act causing damage to another. — In the
case of a person who, in order to avoid a greater evil or injury,
does an act which causes damage to another (Art. 11[4], Ibid.),
the persons for whose benefit the harm has been prevented
shall be civilly liable in proportion to the benefit which they
may have received. The courts shall determine, in their sound
discretion, the proportionate amount for which each one shall
be liable.
When the respective shares cannot be equitably determined,
even approximately, or when the liability also attaches to the
Government, or to the majority of the inhabitants of the town,
and, in all events, whenever the damage has been caused with
the consent of the authorities or their agents, indemnification
shall be made in the manner prescribed by special laws or
regulations.
(3) Person using force on, or causing fear to, another. — In the
case of a person who acts under the impulse of an uncontrollable fear of an equal or greater injury or fails to perform as act
required by law, when prevented by some lawful or insuperable cause (Art. 12[5, 6], Ibid.), the persons using violence or
causing the fear shall be primarily liable and secondarily, or,
if there be no such persons, those doing the act shall be liable,
saving always to the latter that part of their property exempt
from execution. (Art. 101, Ibid.)
Subsidiary civil liability of innkeepers, tavernkeepers,
and proprietors of establishments.
(1) In default of the persons criminally liable, innkeepers,
tavernkeepers, and any other persons or corporations shall be
civilly liable for crimes committed in their establishments, in
all cases where a violation of municipal ordinances or some
general or special police regulations shall have been committed
by them or their employees.

(2) Innkeepers are also subsidiarily liable for the restitution
of goods taken by robbery or theft within their houses from
guests lodging therein, or for the payment of the value thereof,

540

TORTS

provided that such guests shall have notified in advance the
innkeeper himself, or the person representing him, of the deposit
of such goods within the inn; and shall furthermore have followed the directions which such innkeeper or his representative
may have given them with respect to the care of and vigilance
over such goods.

No liability shall attach in case of robbery with violence
against or intimidation of persons unless committed by the
innkeeper’s employees. (Art. 102, Ibid.)
The phrase “in default of the persons criminally liable’’, in
No. (1) implies that the liability of innkeepers, etc. is subsidiary, that is, they will be civilly liable for the crime committed
if the offender is insolvent.

With respect to No. (2), this provision of Article 102 has
already been superseded by Articles 1998 to 2003 of the Civil
Code (Chap. 8.) regarding the liability of keepers of hotels or
inns for the effects deposited by travelers, which liability is
much broader than that imposed by said provision.
Subsidiary civil liability of other persons.
The subsidiary civil liability provided for innkeepers, etc.
also apply to employers, teachers, persons, and corporations
engaged in any kind of industry for felonies committed by
their servants, pupils, workmen, apprentices, or employees in
the discharge of their duties. (Art. 103, RPC.)

The subsidiary liability in Article 103 above is to be distinguished from the primary and direct liability of employers, etc.
under Article 2180 of the Civil Code. (Chap. 6.) The liability
under Article 103 arises from a delict, while that under Article
2180 is based on quasi-delict. The defense of due diligence in
the selection and supervision of the employer may be pleaded
as a defense under Article 2180, while such defense cannot be
invoked in an action to enforce the employer’s subsidiary liability under Article 103.
A judgment of conviction sentencing an employee to pay
indemnity ipso facto makes the defendant-employer subsidiarily

CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING FROM DELICTS

541

liable under Article 103 upon proof of his insolvency. Conversely,
his acquittal will erase his primary liability as well as the employer’s subsidiary liability.
Where, at the time of the commission of the crime, the
accused is a minor under parental authority, the parents are
primarily and directly liable for the damages sustained by the
victim or heirs of the victim. (People vs. Darilay, 421 SCRA 45
[2004]; Libi vs. Court of Appeals, 214 SCRA 16 [1992].)
Scope of civil liability.
The civil liability in criminal cases includes:

(1) Restitution. — The restitution of the thing itself must be
made whenever possible, with allowance for any deterioration
or diminution of value, as determined by the court. The thing
itself shall be restored, even though it be found in the possession of a third person who acquired it by lawful means, saving
to the latter his action against the proper person who may be
liable to him.

This rule is not applicable in a case in which the thing has
been acquired by the third person in the manner and under
the requirements which, by law, bar an action for its recovery;
(2) Reparation of the damage caused. — The court shall determine the amount of damage, taking into consideration the price
of the thing, whenever possible, and its special sentimental value
to the injured party, and reparation shall be made accordingly;
and

(3) Indemnification for consequential damages. — It shall include
not only those caused the injured party, but also those suffered
by his family or by a third person by reason of the crime. (Arts.
104, 105, 106, 107, RPC.)
The obligation to demand restoration, reparation and indemnification likewise descends to the heirs of the person injured.
(Art. 108, Ibid.) If there are two or more persons civilly liable
for a felony, the courts shall determine the amount for which
each must respond. (Art. 109, Ibid.) Any person who has participated gratuitously in the proceeds of a felony shall be bound to

542

TORTS

make restitution in an amount equivalent to the extent of such
participation. (Art. 111, Ibid.)

If restitution is not possible, the law allows reparation. When
a crime is not against property, neither restitution nor reparation can be done. In any case, indemnification for consequential
damages sustained due to the commission of the crime may be
required. The phrase “participated gratuitously’’ in Article 111
has reference to an innocent person who did not know that the
property involved came from an illegal source, and, therefore,
he is only civilly but not criminally liable.
Solidary and subsidiary liabilities of principals,
accomplices, and accessories.
(1) The principals, accomplices, and accessories, each within
their respective class, shall be liable severally (in solidum) among
themselves for their quotas, and subsidiarily for those of the
other persons liable.

(2) The subsidiary liability shall be enforced, first against the
property of the principals; next, against that of the accomplices;
and lastly, against that of the accessories.
(3) Whenever the liability in solidum or the subsidiary liability has been enforced, the person by whom payment has
been made shall have a right of action against the others for
the amount of their respective shares. (Art. 110, RPC.)
By way of illustration:

Assume two principals, A and B, were sentenced to pay
an indemnity of P20,000 each, two accomplices, C and D,
P15,000 each, and two accessories, E and F, P10,000 each.
They are solidarily liable among themselves for their quotas.

Thus, if A cannot pay because of insolvency, B shall be
solidarily liable for A’s share; if B is also insolvent, subsidiary liability shall be enforced against the property of C and
D, and lastly, against E and F. If D is the one insolvent, A
and B shall be the first to be liable subsidiarily, then C, and
lastly E and F.
Extinction and survival of civil liability.

CIVIL LIABILITY ARISING FROM DELICTS

543

(1) Civil liability arising from a felony (Art. 100, RPC.), and
in certain cases (Art. 101, Ibid.), and subsidiary civil liability of
innkeepers, etc. (Art. 102, Ibid.) and other persons (Art. 103, Ibid..),
shall be extinguished in the same manner as other obligations
in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code. (Art. 112,
Ibid.)

(2) Except in case of extinction of his civil liability as
provided above, the offender shall continue to be obliged to
satisfy the civil liability resulting from the crime committed by
him, notwithstanding the fact that he has served his sentence
consisting of deprivation of liberty or other rights, or has not
been required to serve the same by reason of amnesty, pardon,
commutation of sentence, or any other reasons. (Art. 113, Ibid.)
A pardon shall in no case exempt the culprit from the payment of civil indemnity imposed upon him by the sentence.
(Art. 36, par. 2, Ibid.); neither will amnesty, commutation of
sentence, or any other reason, as provided above. Civil liability
may only be extinguished by any of the causes for extinguishment of obligations provided in Article 12314 of the Civil Code.

Art. 1231. Obligations are extinguished:
(1) By payment or performance;
(2) By the loss of the thing due;
(3) By the condonation or remission of the debt;
(4) By the confusion or merger of the rights of creditor and debtor;
(5) By compensation;
(6) By novation.
Other causes of extinguishment of obligations, such as annulment, rescission, fulfillment of a resolutory condition, and prescription, are governed elsewhere in this Code.

Part II

DAMAGES
Chapter 1
GENERAL PROVISIONS
Article 2195. The provisions of this Title shall be
respectively applicable to all obligations mentioned
in Article 1157.
Scope of provisions on damages.
The provisions of Title XVIII on Damages found in Articles
2195 to 2235 of the new Civil Code are respectively applicable
to all kinds of obligations whatever may be their sources. These
obligations all those enumerated in Article 1157, namely: law,
contracts, quasi-contracts, acts or omissions punished by law,
and quasi-delicts. They are more extensive than those contained
in the Spanish (old) Civil Code.
The Code Commission explained the changes it proposed
in the law in its Report, thus:

“The subject of ‘Damages’ is introduced in the Project.
The present Code has but few general principles on the
measure of damages. Moreover, practically the only damages in the present Code are compensatory ones and those
agreed upon in a penal clause. Moral damages are not expressly recognized in the present Civil Code, although in
one instance — injury to reputation — such damages have
been allowed by the Supreme Court of Spain, and some
Spanish jurists believe that moral damages are allowable.
The Supreme Court of the Philippines has awarded moral
544

Art. 2195

GENERAL PROVISIONS

545

damages in a few cases.

The measure of damages is of far-reaching importance in
every legal system. Upon it depends the just compensation
for every wrong or breach of contract.

The Commission has, therefore, deemed it advisable to
include in the Project a Title on ‘Damages’ which embodies
some principles of the American Law on the subject. The
American courts have developed abundant rules and principles upon the adjudication of damages.’’ (Report, p. 72.)
Concept of damages.

Damages may properly be defined as the pecuniary compensation, recompense, or satisfaction for an injury sustained,
or, as otherwise expressed, the pecuniary consequences which
the law imposes for the breach of some duty or violation of
some rights. (People vs. Ballesteros, 91 SCAD 146, 285 SCRA
438 [1998]; 8 R.C.L. 420.)
As used in the Civil Code, it may refer either to the monetary award to the person injured by the legally recognized
harm caused by another or to the loss caused to such person
by the violation of his legal rights.
In a popular sense, the word “damage’’ frequently means
depreciation in value, whether such depreciation is caused by a
wrongful or a legal act. In statutes and other legal instruments
giving compensation for “damages,’’ the word refers to some
actionable loss, injury or harm which results from the unlawful
act or omission or negligence of another. When used to signify
the money which a plaintiff ought to recover, the word “damage’’ or “damages’’ is never in any sense synonymous with, or
collateral to, the terms “example,’’ “fine’’ “penalty,’’ punishment,’’
“revenge,’’ “discipline,’’ or “chastisement.’’ (58 Am. Jur. 2d 14.)
Damages, damage, and injury
distinguished.
There is a material distinction between damages, damage,
and injury.
Injury is the legal invasion of a legal right; damage is the

546

DAMAGES

Art. 2195

loss, hurt, or harm which results from the injury; and damages
are the recompense or compensation awarded for the damage
suffered. Thus, there can be damage without injury in those
instances in which the loss or harm was not the result of a
violation of a legal duty. In such cases, the consequences must
be borne by the injured person alone.
The law affords no remedy for damages resulting from an
act which does not amount to a legal injury or wrong. These
situations are often called damnum absque injuria. (BPI Express
Card Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 296 SCRA 260 [1998].)

The above distinction is not always followed. Sometimes
they are used interchangeably.
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. Tenants of plaintiff vacated his apartment due to adobe fences
constructed by adjoining lot owners which restricted passage from and
to said apartment.

Facts: Plaintiff (private respondent) owns a parcel of land with
a 2-door apartment erected thereon. Said property is surrounded by
other immovables owned by a number of people, the defendants.

The first passageway from the plaintiff’s residence is approximately one (1) meter wide and 20 meters distant and the second,
about three (3) in width and length and about 26 meters distant.
In passing thru said passageway, a less than one (1) meter wide
path through the sceptic tank and 5-6 meters in length has to be
traversed.
When said property P was purchased by the plaintiff, there
were tenants occupying the premises. After one of said tenants
vacated the apartment, the plaintiff saw there had been built by
defendant S an adobe fence in the first passageway making it narrower in width. Defendant M constructed her own adobe fence
in such a way that the entire passageway was closed. And it was
then that the remaining tenants of the apartment vacated the area.

Defendant S testified that she constructed said fence because
there was an incident when her daughter was dragged by a bicycle
pedalled by a son of one of the tenants in said apartment along the
first passageway. She also mentioned some other inconveniences
of having at the front of her house a pathway, such as when
some of the tenants were drunk and would bang their doors and

Art. 2195

GENERAL PROVISIONS

547

windows. Some of their footwear were even lost.

The decision of the Courts of Appeals awarding damages to
the plaintiff was based solely on the fact that the plaintiff incurred
losses in the form of unrealized rentals when the tenants vacated
the leased premises by reason of the closure of the passageway.

Issue: Did the Court of Appeals err in awarding damages in
favor the of plaintiff?
Held: Yes. (1) Award of damages without substantial basis. — “The
mere fact that the plaintiff suffered losses does not give rise to a
right to recover damages. To warrant the recovery of damages, there
must be both a right of action for a legal wrong inflicted by the
defendant, and damage resulting to the plaintiff therefrom. Wrong
without damage, or damage without wrong, does not constitute
a cause of action, since damages are merely part of the remedy
allowed for the injury caused by a breach or wrong.’’

(2) Material distinction between damages and injury. — “There
is a material distinction between damages and injury. Injury is the
illegal invasion of a legal right; damage is the loss, hurt, or harm
which results from the injury, and damages are the recompense or
compensation awarded for the damage suffered. Thus, there can be
damage without injury in those instances in which the loss or harm
was not the result of a violation of a legal duty. These situations are
often called damnum absque injuria.’’

(3) Underlying basis for award of tort damages. — “In order
that a plaintiff may maintain an action for the injuries of which
he complains, he must establish that such injuries resulted from
a breach of duty which the defendant owed to the plaintiff — a
concurrence of injury to the plaintiff and legal responsibility by
the person causing it. The underlying basis for the award of tort
and damages is the premise that an individual was injured in
contemplation of law.

Thus, there must first be the breach of some duty and the
imposition of liability for that breach before damages may be
awarded, it is not sufficient to state that there should be tort liability
merely because the plaintiff suffered some pain and suffering.’’
(4) Necessity of sustaining legal injury. — “Many accidents occur and many injuries are inflicted by acts or omissions which
cause damage or loss to another but which violate no legal duty
to such other person, and consequently create no cause of action
in his favor. In such cases, the consequences must be borne by
the injured person alone. The law affords no remedy for damages

548

DAMAGES

Art. 2195

resulting from an act which does not amount to a legal injury or
wrong.

In other words, in order that the law will give redress for an
act causing damage, that act must be not only hurtful, but wrongful. There must be damnum et injuria. If, as may happen in many
cases, a person sustains actual damage, that is, harm or loss to
his person or property, without sustaining any legal injury, that
is, an act or omission which the law does not deem an injury, the
damage is regarded as damnum absque injuria.’’
(5) No legal injury sustained by plaintiff. — “In the case at bar,
although there was damage, there was no legal injury. Contrary
to the claim of private respondents, petitioners could not be said
to have violated the principle of abuse of right.

In order that the principle of abuse of right provided in Article
21 of the Civil Code can be applied, it is essential that the following requisites concur: (1) The defendant should have acted
in a manner that is contrary to morals, good customs or public
policy; (2) The acts should be willful; and (3) There was damage
or injury to the plaintiff.
The act of petitioners in constructing a fence within their lot
is a valid exercise of their right as owners, hence not contrary to
morals, good customs or public policy. The law recognizes in the
owner the right to enjoy and dispose of a thing, without other
limitations than those established by law. It is within the right of
petitioners, as owners, to enclose and fence their property. Article
430 of the Civil Code provides that ‘(e)very owner may enclose
or fence his land or tenements by means of walls, ditches, live
or dead hedges, or by any other means without detriment to
servitudes constituted thereon.”’
(6) No easement existed in favor of plaintiff. — “At the time of
the construction of the fence, the lot was not subject to any servitudes. There was no easement of way existing in favor of private
respondents, either by law or by contract. The fact that private
respondents had no existing right over the said passageway is confirmed by the very decision of the trial court granting a compulsory
right of way in their favor after payment of just compensation. It
was only that decision which gave private respondents the right
to use the said passageway after payment of the compensation
and imposed a corresponding duty on petitioners not to interfere
in the exercise of said right.
Hence, prior to said decision, petitioners had an absolute right

Art. 2195

GENERAL PROVISIONS

549

over their property and their act of fencing and enclosing the same
was an act which they may lawfully perform in the employment
and exercise of said right. To repeat, whatever injury or damage
may have been sustained by private respondents by reason of the
rightful use of the said land by petitioners is damnum absque injuria.’’
(7) Right of a person to natural use and enjoyment of his property.
— “A person has a right to the natural use and enjoyment of his
own property, according to his pleasure, for all the purposes to
which such property is usually applied.

As a general rule, therefore, there is no cause of action for
acts done by one person upon his own property in a lawful and
proper manner, although such acts incidentally cause damage or
an unavoidable loss to another, as such damage or loss is damnum
absque injuria. When the owner of property makes use thereof in
the general and ordinary manner in which the property is used,
such as fencing or enclosing the same as in this case, nobody
can complain of having been injured, because the inconvenience
arising from said use can be considered as a mere consequence
of community life.’’

(8) No cause of action in favor of plaintiff. — “The proper exercise of a lawful right cannot constitute a legal wrong for which an
action will lie, although the act may result in damage to another,
for no legal right has been invaded. One may use any lawful
means to accomplish a lawful purpose and though the means
adopted may cause damage to another, no cause of action arises
in the latter’s favor. Any injury or damage occasioned thereby is
damnum absque injuria.
The courts can give no redress for hardship to an individual
resulting from action reasonably calculated to achieve a lawful
end by lawful means.’’ (Custodio vs. Court of Appeals, 68 SCAD
258, 253 SCRA 483 [1996].)

2. The acts of the importer in contesting the forfeiture of goods
imported by him, delayed the delivery of the goods to the highest bidder.
Facts: The Collector of Customs, doubting the importation
of Virginia leaf tobacco by petitioner AH, refused to release the
shipment. AH filed an action for mandamus to compel the Collector of Customs and the Commissioner of Customs to release
the tobacco to the petitioner.
In the forfeiture sale, the bid of CTIP, Inc., private respondent,

550

DAMAGES

Art. 2195

was affirmed by the Commissioner of Customs and the goods
were awarded to it.

Under the law, AH has the right to have the decision of the
Collector of Customs reviewed by the Commissioner of Customs,
and from the decision of the latter to appeal to the Court of Tax
Appeals, and from the latter’s decision, to the Supreme Court.
The case reached the Supreme Court five (5) times.

Issue: Is AH liable to CTIP, Inc. for damages from the consequent delay in the delivery of the goods?

Held: AH has the right to take all legal steps to protect his rights.
— “This Court recognizes that petitioner has the right to take
all legal steps to enforce his legal and/or equitable rights to the
tobacco in question. One who makes use of his own legal right
does no injury. It damage results from a person’s exercising his
legal rights, it is damnum absque injuria. The consequent delay in
the delivery of the tobacco is an incident to said exercise of his
rights. But, again whatever might be petitioner’s motive in this
regard will hardly affect the outcome of his case.’’ (Auyong Hian
vs. Court of Tax Appeals, 59 SCRA 110 [1974].)

3. Bank, creditor, claims damages for fraudulent transactions
designed to defraud its debtor’s creditors, but said transactions did not
in any way affect its rights.

Facts: Petitioner MBTC, bank, filed a complaint against
respondent T.C. Leong (also known as R.C.L. Palanca) for the
unliquidated balance of an overdraft line, which has not been
paid despite repeated demand. It appears that Leong or Palanca
sold his only asset, a parcel of land, to his son Gilbert. The same
property was mortgaged to respondent B & I Realty, Inc., payable
within one (1) year, and also in favor of another respondent, CSY,
by way of second mortgage. It was alleged in the complaint that
both transactions were in fraud of creditors.
Subsequently, an amicable settlement was entired into (within
the period for filing of a petition for review of the decision of the
Court of Appeals) between MBTC and Leong and his son, which
was approved by the Supreme Court. It provided for the full
satisfaction of MBTC’s, money claim against private respondents.
The property in question had already been released from the encumbrance in favor of B & I Realty before the filing of the civil
case in the trial court.

Art. 2195

GENERAL PROVISIONS

551

Issue: Has MBTC the right to claim damages since B & I Realty,
as found by the trial court, had knowledge of the simulated sale,
between Leong and his son, and it had entered into the mortgage
contract to defraud Leong’s creditor’s?
Held: No. (1) MBTC’s rights not affected by the mortgage. — “Indeed, the records show that on September 21, 1966 or more than a
year before the rendition of the decision against Tan Chuan Leong
in Civil Case No. 69844 for recovery of sum of money and long
before the filing of the case for rescission of sale and mortgae on
July 15, 1968, the property in question had already been released
from the encumbrance in favor of B & I Realty Co., Inc. Thus, the
mortgage did not in any way affect petitioner’s rights. It were as if
said mortgage had never even existed.’’
(2) No damage or prejudice suffered by the MBTC. — “Although
the respondent corporation may have had knowledge of the simulated sale between Tan Chuan Leong and his son and had entered
into the contract of mortgage pursuant to a design to defraud
Leong’s creditors, no damage or prejudice appears to have been
suffered by the petitioner thereby. Absent damage or prejudice,
no right of action arises in favor of the petitioner. Actio non datur
non damnificato. No right of action is given where no injury is
sustained. A wronful violation of a legal right is not a sufficient
element of a cause of action unless it has resulted in an injury
causing loss or damages.

There must be, therefore, both wrongful violation and damages. The one without the other is not sufficient (1 CJS 1005). As
no man may be punished for his thoughts, bad faith alone, when
not translated into injurious action, is not punishable by law.’’

(3) B & I Realty uselessly impleaded. — “With the mortgage
no longer existing, the same could not be cited as reason for the
petitioner’s failure to collect his credit. The cancellation of respondent B & I Realty’s lien over the property had rendered the issues
of rescissibility and bad faith moot and academic. The fact that
petitioner, nonetheless, impleaded B & I Realty in its complaint,
unnecessarily compelling the latter to litigate to protect its rights
and interests justifies the award of attorney’s fees.’’
(4) Mortgage in favor CSY valid. — “As to the second mortgage
in favor of Chen Siy Yuan, the same is, as found by the respondent appellate court, valid and subsisting. The petitioner failed to
present evidence to convince this Court of bad faith on the part
of Chen Siy Yuan.

552

DAMAGES

Art. 2195

Nor do we find any evidence that would substantiate the
petitioner’s imputation of bad faith. At the time that this second
mortgage was entered into, the certificate of title stood in the
name of respondent Gilbert K. Tan Palanca, without any annotation of encumbrance in favor of the petitioner or any one else.
The mortgagee Yuan then had every right to rely upon what appeared in the certificate of title and there being nothing to excite
suspicion, did not have to inquire further.’’ (Metropolitan Bank and
Trust Company vs. Tan Chuan Leong (42 SCRA 352 [1986].)

Bases for award of tort damages.

Damages in tort constitute the “money awarded to the
person injured by the tort of another.’’ (see Restatement § 902.)

(1) Breach of duty by defendant. — In order that a plaintiff
may maintain an action for the injuries of which he complains,
he must establish that such injuries resulted from a breach of
duty which the defendant owed to the plaintiff — a concurrence
of injury to the plaintiff and legal responsibility by the person
causing it.

(2) Injury to plaintiff proximately resulting from the breach. — The
underlying basis for the award of tort damages is the premise
that an individual was injured in contemplation of law. Thus,
there must first be a breach before damages may be awarded;
and the breach of such duty should be the proximate cause of
the injury.” (BPI Express Card Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, supra.; Philippine Airlines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 417
SCRA 196 [2003].) One who exercises his rights does no injury.
(Auyong Han vs. Court of Appeals, 59 SCRA 110 [1974].)

(3) Compensation to plaintiff commensurate with his loss. — The
fundamental principle of law on damages is that one injured by a
breach of contract or by a wrongful or negligent act or omission
shall have a fair and just compensation, commensurate with the
loss sustained as a consequence of the defendant’s acts. Actual
damages are such compensation or damages for an injury that
will put the injured party in the position in which he had been
before he was injured. These pertain to such injuries or losses
that are actually sustained and susceptible of measurement.
(People vs. Olermo, 406 SCRA 412 [2003].)

Art. 2196

GENERAL PROVISIONS

553

Damages distinguished from restitution
and injunction.
Damages is distinct from restitution and injunction, both of
which are also occasionally available in tort cases.

(1) Restitution, when available, requires the defendant to
restore any gains he made in a transaction, or by his act or
omission.

(2) Injunction, when available, forbids threatened actions
or requires the defendant to alter harmful conduct or repair its
consequences. (see D.B. Dobbs, The Law of Torts, 2000 Ed., p.
1047.)
Art. 2196. The rules under this Title are without
prejudice to special provisions on damages formulated elsewhere in this Code. Compensation for workmen and other employees in case of death, injury or
illness is regulated by special laws. Rules governing
damages laid down in other laws shall be observed
insofar as they are not in conflict with this Code.
Special provisions and laws on damages.
(1) Special provisions on damages found in other provisions
of the Civil Code are applicable in the cases so provided, not
the rules under Title XVIII.

(2) Rules governing damages laid down in special laws shall
apply suppletorily; they shall be observed insofar as they are
not in conflict with Articles 2195 to 2235 of the Civil Code.
(3) In the case, however, of compensation for workmen and
other employees in case of death, injury or illness, it shall be
governed not by the Civil Code but “by special laws.’’

It would appear from Article 2195 that Articles 2195 to 2135
are intended to be of general application without prejudice to
special provisions formulated elsewhere in the Civil Code and
the rules regulating compensation for workmen and other employees for work-connected death, injury, or illness.
Elements of damages recoverable.

554

DAMAGES

Art. 2196

Properly proven, the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages
under three (3) basic categories.

(1) Time losses. — The plaintiff can recover loss of wages or
the value of any lost time or earning capacity where injuries
prevent work. (see Arts. 2205-2206.)
(2) Injury expenses. — Expenses incurred by reason of the
injury are recoverable as damages. Under the “avoidable consequences’’ rule (Art. 2203.), expenses incurred to minimize
damages may be recovered.
(a) Expense recovery in personal injury cases are usually
medical expenses and kindred items. (D.B. Dobbs, op. cit.,
p. 1048.)

(b) In a case involving injury to property, those damages
are measured by the loss in value of the property or the
cost to repair (or replace), whichever is less. In addition,
the plaintiff may recover damages for consequential loss,
such as diminished profits. (K.S. Abraham, The Forms and
Functions of Tort Law, 2002 Ed., p. 206.)

(3) Pain and suffering. — In their various forms, they include
emotional distress and consciousness of loss. (see Art. 2217;
D.B. Dobbs, op. cit., p. 1048.) Pain and suffering damages for
intangible losses may be awarded to compensate the plaintiff
for physical and emotional suffering, disfigurement, loss of life’s
enjoyments, and other similar intangible losses. (K.S. Abraham,
op. cit., p. 206.)
The basic damages recovery, comprising all these elements of
past and future damages, is subject to various adjustments, and
sometimes to limits’ to total award. (D.B. Dobbs, op. cit., p. 1048.)
The ordinary rules governing the burden of proving the
elements of the plaintiff’s claim apply to proof of damages.
The plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence
that he has suffered or will in the future suffer, the losses for
which he claims damages. (K.S. Abraham, op. cit., pp. 206-207.)
Evidence of fact, amount, and cause
of damages.
(1) Fact and amount of the damage. — It is fundamental that

Art. 2196

GENERAL PROVISIONS

555

damages cannot be presumed and must be proved by clear and
satisfactory evidence as to the fact and amount thereof. Although
the plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the pleadings for want
of specific denial of the material allegations in his complaint,
the answer being a general denial, the trial court cannot award
damages in the absence of competent proof that damages had
been suffered and of the amount thereof. (see Lichauco vs.
Guash, 76 Phil. 5 [1946].)
(2) Cause of the damage. — The act or omission of the defendant must have been the proximate cause, as distinguished from
the remote, cause of the injury. Many statements have been used
to distinguish a proximate from a remote cause (through such
words as “natural,’’ “unbroken,’’ “efficient,’’ and “produces’’)
with the usual “without which’’ test of cause-in-fact. (see Art.
2179, Chap. 6, Part I.)

(3) Proof of the damage. — The fact, amount, and cause of the
damage must be proved by a preponderance of evidence. This
requires proof, at the least, of the substantive right, its breach,
and the amount of damages which flowed from that breach.
The court must not be left to an undue amount of speculation
on any of these elements.
(a) Evidence to prove fact and cause. — The courts have
used the term “reasonable certainty’’ to mean only that the
above must be taken out of the area of speculation.

For example, the plaintiff may claim that his injuries
and resulting damage were caused by an alleged negligent
act of the defendant. Before the plaintiff can recover damages, he must meet the usual burden of proof required in
a negligence case.
(b) Evidence to prove amount. — The amount of speculation
in which the court will be allowed to engage varies with
the facts of each case. Thus, whenever the fact of injury is
proved with requisite certainty, uncertainty as to amount of
damages will not prevent a decision awarding damages.

All recoverable damages are subject to some uncertainties especially when those damages seek to compensate
the plaintiff for future injuries. Therefore, only reasonable
certainty is required in proving the fact and cause of the

556

DAMAGES

Art. 2196

injury, but the amount of damages — once their cause and
fact have been shown — need not be proved with the same
degree of certainty. (see 22 Am. Jur. 2d 41-42.) The fact that
the damages suffered cannot be calculated with absolute
exactness or mathematical accuracy is not a bar for recovery.
Workmen’s compensation scheme.
Compensation for workmen and other employees in case
of work-connected death, injury or illness is governed by the
Labor Code (infra.) and not by the Civil Code. (Art. 2196.)
(1) Need for injury compensation system. — The 19th century
was a period of enormous industrialization and urbanization
in the United State. During that period, it went from being a
nation of rural farmers to being a nation of city-dwelling factory
workers. With all this industrialization came a whole series of
problems, one of which was industrial injuries.
At the dawn of the 20th century there was growing recognition that workplace injuries were not merely a legal, but also a
social problem. The tort system itself was not providing compensation for such injuries in an adequate way. Legal doctrines
restricted workers’ rights of recovery on grounds of assumption
of risk, contributory negligence, and the “fellow-servant,’’ rule
that precluded recovery from an employer for injuries caused
by another employee’s negligence.

In addition, many work-place injuries were not the result
of anyone’s negligence and, therefore, were not subject to tort
liability, because employers were liable only for negligence.
After some years of controversy and, at first, the enactment of
partial or optional systems (in the years between 1910 and 1920),
a new system of “workers compensation’’ replaced tort liability
for workplace injuries. (K.S. Abraham, op. cit., pp. 238-239.)
(2) Rationale. — An individual injured by an innocent defendant can seek compensation from public sources rather than
from the defendant.
(a) Compensation for injury, a social responsibility. — Such
an approach treats innocently caused injury as a social responsibility rather than a matter of the defendant’s personal

Art. 2196

GENERAL PROVISIONS

557

accountability. The argument is that when both the plaintiff
and defendant are innocent, there is no justice in shifting the
plaintiff’s suffering to the equally innocent defendant, but
there might be a point in alleviating the plaintiff’s suffering
through some kind of insurance or public benefit system.

(b) Compensation for injury, a regular cost of business that
may be shifted to the public. — Plans like workers’ compensation, which require employers to pay compensation for
workers’ injuries even when employers are not at fault,
may be rationalized on the ground that injury is a regular
cost of business to be borne by the business itself. If injury
is seen to be as much a part of the worker’s life as a part
of the business, however, that explanation becomes less
convincing.
A different explanation for workers’ compensation plans
is that the employer is held liable without fault because he
can pass on the costs of employee injury to the public who
buys his products or services. In this view, the employer is
not himself ultimately responsible for worker injuries; rather,
he is a conduit for public liability. (D.B. Dobbs, op. cit., p. 21.)

(3) Criticism of schemed. — Although alternative compensation
plans help fulfill a sense of social responsibility or at least help
solve a social problem, they may raise doubts about whether
they give enough scope for either corrective justice or deterrence in the form of individual accountability for wrongs. The
workers’ compensation system, for example, substitutes limited
compensation obligations for tort liability, so that the negligent
employer escapes any obligation to make full tort payment to
a wronged individual.
From the employer’s point of view, this reduction in tort
liability may be balanced by the employer’s obligation to pay
other workers even when the employer is not at fault, but even
so, the employer’s incentive for safety is reduced. (Ibid.)

(4) Major components. — Any injury compensation system,
including tort law and workers-compensation, has three (3)
major components:
(a) The compensable event;

558

DAMAGES

Art. 2196

(b) The measure of recovery; and
(c) The payment mechanism.

In tort law, for example, the prevailing compensable event
is an injury caused by negligence; the measure of compensation
is full payment of both tangible and intangible losses; and the
payment mechanism is the injurer’s liability insurance or (so to
speak) self-insurance. Workers compensation modified the first
two of these components of the tort system, but left the third
component in place. (K.S. Abraham, op. cit., 240.)
(5) Compensable event. — The compensable event in tort was
an injury caused by an employer’s negligence. In contrast, in
workers compensation the compensable event is non-negligentlycaused injury.

Workers compensation abolishes the tort liability of the
employer and provides compensation to employees through
an exclusive remedy within an administrative system for injuries “arising out of or in the course of employment.’’ The only
defense available is that the employee intended to cause his
own injury or acted with wanton disregard for his own safety.
This is strict liability of a very broad sort. “Fault’’ has been
replaced by “cause’’ as the basis of liability.’’ (Ibid.)

(5) Measure of recovery. — Workers compensation also modifies the measure of recovery. Because of the expansion of the
compensable event and the elimination of defenses, vastly
greater numbers of workers are entitled to receive compensation. Vastly increased costs could, therefore, be expected if the
measure of recovery were not reduced. Some administrative
cost savings could be expected because of the greatly reduced
cost of determining eligibility for compensation.
(a) Recovery reduced to effect administrative cost savings. —
In tort, it typically would have taken litigation to determine
whether an employer was negligent. But most employees
who enter the job injured and at the end of the day are
uninjured have incontestably suffered a compensable event.
Indeed, what dispute resolution there is takes place out of
court, before an administrative agency.

Despite these administrative cost savings, if the measure

Art. 2196

GENERAL PROVISIONS

559

of compensation had not been changed, the new workers
compensation system would have cost many times what
the tort system did.

(b) Items of recovery. — Consequently, the amount that an
employee could recover was limited. At first, recovery was
limited to medical expenses and a portion of several weeks
wages. There was no recovery for pain and suffering at all.
Over time the number of weeks’ wages that are recoverable
has increased to the point where there is no limit in some
states and the limit is several years in others. Both wage
losses and medical expenses are paid periodically as they
are incurred. And there has also developed a rough but
restricted substitute for pain and suffering — lump-sum
awards for partial and total permanent disability have been
enacted.

For example, the statutes specify particular recoveries
to be awarded for loss of a hand, loss of an eye, paralysis
of both legs, and so forth. Often these are specified as a
multiple of a particular number of weeks’ wages. Losses
of an arm may be worth 300 weeks wages and loss of an
eye 150 weeks wages, for example. Typically, these sums
are, therefore, considerably more limited than the pain and
suffering awards that might be obtained in a tort suit for
the same loss. (Ibid., p. 240.)

(6) Employees’ compensation program under the Labor Code. —
The Labor Code of the Philippines (Pres. Decree No. 442, as
amended.) provides for a tax-exempt employees’ compensation
program whereby employees and their defendants, in the event
of work-connected disability or death, may promptly secure
adequate income benefits, and medical or selected benefits. (Art.
160 thereof.)

Coverage in the State Insurance Fund (SIF) shall be compulsory for all employers and their employees not over 60 years
of age, and those over 60 years of age paying contributions to
qualify for retirement or life insurance benefit. (Art. 168, Ibid.)
All employers are required to remit to the SIF a monthly contribution equivalent to 1% of the monthly salary credit of the
every covered employee. (Art. 183, Ibid.) From the SIF comes

560

DAMAGES

Art. 2197

the compensation to be paid to a claimant employee or the
employee’s dependents in case the employee suffers from a
work-connected injury, illness, or death.

The SIF shall be liable for compensation to the employee or
his dependents except when the disability or death was occasioned by the employee’s intoxication, willful intention to injure
or kill himself or another, notorious negligence, or otherwise
provided in the Code. (Art. 172, Ibid.)
Unless otherwise provided the liability of the SIF shall be
exclusive and in place of all other liabilities of the employer to
the employee or his dependents, although simultaneous recovery
of benefits under the program and the Social Security Law is
allowed. (see Art. 173, Ibid.)
Art. 2197. Damages may be:
(1) Actual or compensatory;
(2) Moral;
(3) Nominal;
(4) Temperate or moderate;
(5) Liquidated; or
(6) Exemplary or corrective.
Kinds of damages generally recoverable.
The word “damages’’ involve any and all manifestations
of life: physical or material, moral or psychological, mental
or spiritual, financial, economic, social political and religious.
(Castro vs. Acao Taxicab, 82 Phil. 359 [1938].)
(1) Article 2197 enumerates the different kinds of damages
that may be awarded under the Civil Code. The subsequent
articles are the detailed provisions governing each kind of damages. Note that Article 2197 classifies damages according to the
purpose or intention behind their imposition.
(2) Damages, generally speaking, are of two (2) kinds:
compensation damages and punitive (exemplary or corrective)
damages.

In cases where the parties undertake in their contract to fix

Art. 2197

GENERAL PROVISIONS

561

the damages recoverable upon a breach thereof, the damages
are spoken of as “liquidated’’ damages. The term “damages’’
also includes nominal damages given in vindication of a breach
of duty which does not result in any actual or pecuniary loss.
(58 Am. Jur. 2d 13.)

(3) Damages may be divided according to the manner of
determining the amount of indemnity.
It is liquidated or conventional, if stipulated by the parties in
a contract or non-conventional, if not agreed upon or predetermined. The latter, in turn, may be fixed by law, in which case it
is called statutory, or by the courts, and, therefore, called judicial.
(R. Puno, Damages under the Civil Code in UPLC Continuing
Legal Education for Municipal Judges, pp. 103-108 [1968].)

(4) Damages have also been classified into ordinary damages
or those which necessarily and by implication of law result
from the act or omission complained of, and special damages or
those which result directly but not necessarily or by implication
of law, from the act or omission complained of and exist only
because of special circumstances.
The first may be awarded without the second, while the
second, when proper, are added to the first. (see Art. 2201.)
Art. 2198. The principles of the general law on
damages are hereby adopted insofar as they are not
inconsistent with this Code.
Adoption of principles of the general law
on damages.
The basic provisions on damages of the present Civil Code
are based on the Spanish Civil Code. However, some principles
of American on damages, such as those on moral and temperate
damages, have been adopted and incorporated in the Civil Code.
It is reasonable to believe that “the principles of the general
law on damages’’ referred in the above legal provisions are
the principles which are generally recognized and accepted in
Anglo-American and Spanish law. (H.U. Jarencio, Torts and
Damages in Philippine Law, 1972 Ed., p. 261.)

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES
Article 2199. Except as provided by law or by
stipulation, one is entitled to an adequate compensation only for such pecuniary loss suffered by him as
he has duly proved. Such compensation is referred
to as actual or compensatory damages.
Concept of actual or compensatory damages.
(1) This is the type of damages involving pecuniary loss
referred to in the present article.

Compensatory damages may be defined as damages awarded
to a person as compensation or indemnity for such pecuniary
loss suffered by him as he has duly proved.

(a) A pecuniary loss has been defined as a loss of money
or something by which money or something of money value
may be acquired.
(b) The word indemnity for damage to the person has
been held to include compensation for everything then on,
about, or belonging to the person, as well as for all bodily
injuries which are proved to be the result of the accident.
(58 Am. Jur. 2d. 14.)

(2) The Supreme Court described this kind of damage as
follows:

“The purpose of the law in awarding actual damages
is to repair the wrong that has been done, to compensate
for the injury inflicted, and not to impose a penalty. Actual
damages are not dependent on nor graded by the intent
with which the wrongful act is done. x x x
563

564

DAMAGES

Art. 2199

‘Compensatory damages’ as indicated by the word employed to characterize them, simply make good or replace
the loss caused by the wrong. They proceed from a sense
of natural justice, and are designed to repair that of which
one has been deprived by the wrong of another.
‘Compensatory damages’ are such as are awarded to compensate the injured party for injury caused by the wrong, and
must be only such as make just and fair compensation, and are
due when the wrong is established, whether it was committed
maliciously — that is, with evil intention — or not.” (Algarra
vs. Sandejas, 27 Phil. 284 [1914], citations omitted.)

(3) The term “compensatory damages’’ generally refers to
damages awarded as compensation for wrongful conduct or
breach of contract. Under our law, it covers all losses recoverable
as a matter of right and includes all damages other than moral,
nominal, temperate or moderate, liquidated, and exemplary or
corrective damages.
Proof of compensatory damages.
(1) General rule. — Generally, every judgment for damages,
whether arising from breach of contract or the result of some
provision of law, must rest upon satisfactory proof of the realty
of the damages alleged to have been suffered. (Sanz vs. Lavin
Brothers, 6 Phil. 299 [1906].) No damages can be awarded if the
proof is flimsy and unsubstantial. (Neredia vs. Salinas, 10 Phil.
157 [1908].), or they are remote or highly speculative. (Tomassi
vs. Villa-Abille, 104 Phil. 310 [1958]; Rizal Surety and Insurance
Co. vs. Manila Railroad Co., 23 SCRA 205 [1968].)

(2) Need for receipts. — The award for wake and funeral
expenses, for example, cannot be allowed without supporting
receipts although temperate damages (Art.1 2224.) may be allowed if the fact of having incurred such expenses is incontrovertible. (People vs. Lee, 402 SCRA 124 [2003]; People vs. De
Castro, 403 SCRA 543 [2003]; People vs. Geral, 445 SCRA 104
[2003]; People vs. Segnar, Jr., 423 SCRA 206 [2004].) In a case,
When not otherwise indicated, refers to article in the Civil Code.
Art. 1305. A contract is a meeting of minds between two persons whereby one binds

Art. 2199

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

565

the receipts only proved expenses in the amount of P13,250.00.
Nevertheless, temperate damages in the amount of P25,000.00
were awarded. “This is in keeping with recent jurisprudence
to the effect that when actual damages established by receipts
during the trial amount to less than P25,000.00, an award of
temperate damages for P25,000.00 is justified.’’ (People vs. Torrecampo, 423 SCRA 433 [2004].)

A list of expenses cannot replace receipts when the latter should have been issued as a matter of course in business transactions. (People vs. Cabical, 403 SCRA 268 [2003];
People vs. Magalona, 406 SCRA 546 [2003]. Where, however,
the amount claimed as actual damages is admitted, it should
be granted. (People vs. Abolidor, 423 SCRA 260 [2004].) even
without
receipts.

(3) Amount of actual damages. — The amount of actual damages suffered must be proven with a reasonable degree of certainty, premised on competent proof and on the best evidence
obtainable by the injured party which usually means official
or valid receipts. (MOF Co. vs. Enriquez, 168 SCAD 426, 382
SCRA 248 [2002]; Chua Teck Hee vs. Phil. Publishing Co., 34
Phl. 447 [1916]; Valencia vs. Tantoco, 97 Phil. 824 [1956]; People
vs. Alfon, 399 SCRA 64 [2003]; People vs. Caraig, 400 SCRA 67
[2003]; People vs. Vicente, 405 SCRA 40 [2003]; People vs. Abes,
420 SCRA 259 [2004]; People vs. Baño, 419 SCRA 697 [2004];
People vs. Segnar, Jr., 423 SCRA 206 [2004].)
(a) The court cannot rely on the claimant’s uncorroborated testimony which lacks specific details or particulars
on the claimed damages and the amount thereof. (Casitas
vs. People, 422 SCRA 242 [2004].) It cannot base a finding of substantial damages upon speculation, conjecture or
guesswork in determining the fact and amount of damages.
Actual damages may only be awarded for expenses duly
supported by receipts. (People vs. Malinao, 423 SCRA 34
[2004].)
(b) It is not necessary to prove the exact amount of the
loss. It is enough that the loss is established by competent
evidence and the amount awarded as damages by the court
is fair and reasonable. (Hicks vs. Manila Hotel, 28 Phil. 235
[1914]; Tan Li vs. Alvear, 26 Phil. 506 [1914].)

566

DAMAGES

Art. 2199

(c) The court must be careful not to award exorbitant
damages. (Inhelder Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, 122
SCRA [1983.] It cannot rely on its own speculations as the
fact and amount of damages. (Suntay Tanjangco vs. Jovellanos, 108 Phil. 713 [1960]; Basilan Lumber Co. vs. Caga-yan
Timber Export Co., 2 SCRA 766 [1961].)

(d) Compensatory damages cannot be allowed if there
are no specific facts which should be a basis for measuring
the amount over and above attorney’s fees and costs. (Perez
Rubio vs. Philipp & Sons, Inc., 141 SCRA 488 [1987]; Danao
vs. Court of Appeals, 154 SCRA 446 [1987]; Sy vs. Court of
Appeals, 131 SCRA 116 [1984]; Perfecto vs. Gonzales, 128
SCRA 635 [1984].) In no instance may a court give more than
the damages proved by the claimant. (Marker vs. Garcia, 5
Phil. 557 [1906].)

(4) Damage presumed, or proof not required by law. — Actual
damages need not be proved in case pecuniary loss is presumed
as when a child or a spouse dies. (Mansanares vs. Moreta, 38
Phil. 821 [1918].) Neither is proof of pecuniary loss required in
case of damages other than actual or compensatory. (Art. 2216.)

(5) Damages implied by law. — In certain cases, the law
implies damages. Thus, the complainant in libel cases is not
required to introduce evidence of actual damages at least, when
the amount of the award is more or less nominal. By its very
nature, libel causes dishonor, disrepute and discredit. The injury
to the reputation of the offended party is a natural and probable
consequence of the defamatory words where they are libelous
per se. (Quemuel vs. Court of Appeals, 22 SCRA 44 [1968].)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
(1) In an action for breach of contract of sale of logs, caused by
the failure of the supplier to furnish the agreed quantity, as a result of
which the exporter of the logs became liable for demurrage and dead
freight, the exporter seeks to recover the amount of demurrage and dead
freight even if the same has not been actually paid for by the exporter.

Facts: Plaintiff BL & Co. entered into a contract of sale with
defendant CTE & Co., whereby the latter agreed to deliver to the
former 740,000 board feet of exportable logs. The plaintiff sold the

Art. 2199

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

567

logs to a Japanese buyer, who had entered into a contract with
the plaintiff through EA Co. which acted as intermediary. The logs
were to be loaded on a vessel which was chartered by the Japanese
buyer and which arrived in the Philippines at the place agreed
upon for loading. It stayed in port for a total of 8 days, but was
able to load only 483,672 board feet supplied by the defendant.
There were four (4) hatches in the vessel, hence the loading
was to have lasted two and a half days, more or less. However,
it actually took 7 days to load because no sufficient logs were
available at the place where the loading was to take place and
because of the poor stevedoring service. The Japanese buyer became
liable to demurrage and to dead freight which corresponds to the
freight of the logs which were not delivered shipside, amounting
to P19,629.18.

This is the amount awarded in the Court of First Instance.
Legal interest on the said amount and attorney’s fees amounting
to P2,000 were also granted.
On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the judgment of the Court
of First Instance was reversed. The reasons of the said appellate
court in reversing the judgment, are as follows:

“Because the damages in question are yet to he suffered
and are not actual, they may fall under the general category
of prospective damages. We are not unaware of American
decisions to the effect that, in estimating the pecuniary loss
sustained by a party as a result of another’s tort or breach of
contract, the former’s right of recovery must be for all damages
resulting therefrom, whether past, present, and prospective,
and that prospective damages may be allowed upon proof that
they are reasonably certain to occur, but in this jurisdiction
the rule is that no recovery of damages can be had without
satisfactory proof of the real existence of such damages, and
that the true measure of damages for the breach of a contract
is what the plaintiff has lost by the breach.’’

The appellant argues that the demurrage and dead freight due
the buyer in Japan had already been paid by the EA Co. through
which the BL Co. sold the logs. The receipts evidencing such payment had been submitted. It is further argued that in accordance
with the decisions of United states courts, it is enough that there
is proof or reasonable certainty that substantial future damages
will result in order that a recovery for damages can he had; that
the majority of the provisions of the Uniform Sales Law had been

568

DAMAGES

Art. 2199

adopted in the Civil Code, so that the decisions of American courts
in the matter of damages should be applied.
It is also argued that the contract between the plaintiff and
the defendant contains the following terms:

‘In case of non-compliance by the SELLER with the
amended contract conditions, the SELLER hereby agrees to
indemnify the BUYER for whatever damages the BUYER
would be held liable to their buyers in Japan as a consequence
thereof, x x x.
x x x any claims arising out of default or failure of the
SELLER to comply with loading capacity of the vessel shall
be for account of the SELLER.’

From which, the intention of the parties to make the seller liable to plaintiff for the valid claims of Japanese buyers, is evident.

Issue: In an action for damages resulting from a breach of
contract to supply, may the exporter recover from a supplier the
amount of damages for which it would be held liable under its
contract with a Japanese buyer even if such damages have not
yet been demanded from and paid by it, and before said exporter
actually paid the same?

Held: No. (1) Damages must be “duly proved.’’ — “Our answer
to the foregoing arguments of counsel of petitioner is the express
provisions of Article 2199 of the Civil Code of the Philippines to
the effect that damages must be ‘duly proved.’ This new petition,
which did not exist in the Civil Code of Spain, denies the grant
of speculative damages, damages not actually proved to have
existed and to have been caused to the party claiming the same.
In the case at bar, the evidence shows that actual damage
was caused to the agent through which petitioner sold the logs to
a Japanese buyer, as said agent had already paid the same to the
latter. However, there is no proof that respondent had already paid
the agent said damages, or that it had already been required to
pay the same, and while these have not happened, the damage to
the petitioner may not, under the above-cited article of the Civil
Code, be deemed to have actually been caused to him.’’
(2) Plaintiff has not actually suffered damage. — “As regards the
express terms of the agreement holding the seller liable for the
damages it may cause the buyer, the same are merely declaratory
of the obligation assumed, not an obligation which the obligee
may demand in compliance with upon breach of the terms of

Art. 2199

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

569

the contract and even before actual payment of damages by the
one who breached the agreement, because the obligee has not yet
actually suffered the damage or paid the same to the person to
whom damage was caused.

It is only when the obligee actually suffers the damage, that
compliance with the obligation may be demanded.’’ (Basilan Lumber
Co. vs. Cagayan Timber Export Co., 2 SCRA 766 [1961].)

2. Finding that petitioner was not motivated by malice in filing
an administrative complaint against private respondent, the lower court
nevertheless ordered petitioner to pay compensatory damages to private
respondent.
Facts: Petitioner Francisco A. Perfecto (FAP), a defeated candidate for congressman, filed an administrative complaint against
the members of the board of election inspectors of a precinct,
including private respondent Juliana Vista (JV), a poll clerk in
said precinct. The complaint charged that the said members of
the board of election inspectors were guilty of non-feasance, malfeasance and misfeasance for wilfull failure to comply with the
instructions, orders, decisions and rulings of the Commission on
Elections in connection with the elections of 1965.

As a consequence, JV, assisted by her husband, filed an action
for damages alleging that the charges were false and without basis
and had been instituted maliciously in order to harass, annoy,
demean, degrade and expose her to public ridicule and because
of which she suffered “mental torture, anguish, sleepless nights,
besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, mental shock and social humiliation which may be assessed as moral damages in the
amount of P120,000.00.’’ Further, she “claims the further sum of
P15,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P10,000.00 for attorney’s
fees and expenses in the prosecution of the suit.’’
Answering the complaint for damages, petitioner FAP avers
that the filing of the administrative complaint against private
respondent and the members of the board of election inspectors
of was done in good faith with the highest motive of bringing
to justice persons who have violated the laws of the land; that
he never had any personal grudge or ill-feeling against private
respondent previously and his only purpose in filing the administrative complaint was to deter the commission of the acts charged
for the sake of democracy, that he even asked for the dismissal

570

DAMAGES

Art. 2199

of all administrative cases he had filed against many teachers in
their conduct of the 1965 elections because he had no intention
of demeaning and degrading them and because he was satisfied
with the action taken by the Commission in connection with the
election cases in the provinces of Batanes and Cotabato.

Evidence shows that the private respondent did not act as
poll clerk on election day, November 9, 1965 because she was ill
and had been running with fever for several days prior to the
election. In fact, she was substituted by another school teacher
as poll clerk on that day.
Respondent judge awarded JV compensatory damages in the
amount of P2,000.00.
Issue: Is there merit in the petition for review to set aside the
award of compensatory damages?

Held: Yes. (1) Respondent judge found no basis for compensatory
damages. — “Respondent judge found no basis for actual or compensatory damages and exemplary damages when it said that to
slap a heavy damage upon the defendant would be tantamount
to imposing a prohibitive premium upon the filing of complaints
against public officials for misconduct in office, a policy that is
neither sound nor conducive to a healthy development of civic
courage and public interest so necessary and indispensable in the
conduct of the affairs of the government.’’

(2) Compensatory damages must be duly proved. — “Beside,
actual or compensatory damages are those recoverable because
of pecuniary loss — in business, trade, property, profession, job,
or occupation, and the same must be proved; otherwise, if the
proof is flimsy and non-substantial, no damages will be given. In
the case of Malonzo vs. Galang, 109 Phil. 16, the Court, speaking
through Justice J.B.L. Reyes, held that with respect to compensatory damages assuming that they are recoverable under the theory
that petitioner had filed a clearly unfounded suit against respondent, the same constitutes a tort against the latter that makes the
former liable for all damages which are the natural and probable
consequences of the act or omission complained of. These damages, cannot, however, be presumed and must be duly proved.’’

(3) Fact and amount of damages cannot be based on speculation.
— “Well-settled is the rule that even if the complaint filed by one
against the other is clearly unfounded this does not necessarily
mean, in the absence of specific facts proving damages, that said
defendant really suffered actual damage over and above attorney’s

Art. 2199

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

571

fees and costs. The Court cannot rely on its speculations as to the
fact and amount of damages. It must depend on actual proof of
the damages alleged to have been suffered. (Perfecto vs. Gonzales,
128 SCRA 635 [1984].)

3. The husband seeks to recover damages from the physician who
performed three separate abortions voluntarily procured by his wife, the
third and last abortion being the basis for filing the action.
Facts: Nita Villanueva became pregnant by her present husband
before they were legally married. Desiring to conceal her pregnancy from her parent, and acting on the advice of her aunt, she
had herself aborted by the defendant. After her marriage with the
plaintiff, she again became pregnant. As she was then employed
in the Commission on Elections and her pregnancy proved to be
inconvenient, she had herself aborted again by the defendant in
October 1953.

On February 21, 1955, accompanied by her sister and the latter’s daughter, she again repaired to the defendant’s clinic where
the three met the defendant and his wife. Nita was again aborted
of a two-month old foetus, in consideration of the sum of P50,000.
The plaintiff (husband) was at this time in the province of Cagayan,
campaigning for his election to the provincial board. He did not
know of, nor gave his consent, to the abortion.
It is the third and last abortion that constitutes plaintiff appellant’s basis in filing this action and award of damages.

Issue: Whether the husband of a woman who voluntarily
procured her abortion could recover damages from the physician
who caused the same.
Held: (1) Award for death of a person does not cover case of unborn
foetus. — “The Court of Appeals and the trial court predicated the
award of damages in the sum of P3,000.00 upon the provisions
of the initial paragraph of Article 2206 of the Civil Code of the
Philippines. This we believe to be error, for the said article, in
fixing a minimum award of P3,000.00 for the death of a person,
does not cover the case of an unborn foetus that is not endowed
with personality. Under the system of our Civil Code, ‘la criatura
abortiva no alcanza la categoria de persona natural y en consecuencia es un ser no nacido a la vida del Derecho’ (Casso-Cervera,
“Diccionario de Derecho Privado’’, Vol. 1, p. 49), being incapable

572

DAMAGES

Art. 2199

of having rights and obligations.’’

(2) Action for pecuniary damages pertains primarily to one injured.
— “Since an action for pecuniary damages on account of personal
injury or death pertains primarily to the one injured, it is easy
to see that if no action for such damages could be instituted on
behalf of the unborn child on account of the injuries it received,
no such right of action could derivatively accrue to its parents or
heirs. In fact, even if a cause of action did accrue on behalf of the
unborn child, the same was extinguished by its pre-natal death,
since no transmission to anyone can take place from one that
lacked juridical personality (or juridical capacity, as distinguished
from capacity to act).

It is no answer to invoke the provisional personality of a
conceived child (conceptus pro nato habetur) under Article 40 of
the Civil Code, because that same article expressly limits such
provisional personality by imposing the condition that the child
should be subsequently born alive: ‘provided it be born later with
the condition specified in the following article’.
In the present case, there is no dispute that the child was
dead when separated from its mother’s womb.

The prevailing American jurisprudence is to the same effect;
and it is geneerally held that recovery can not be had for the
death of an unborn child.’’

(3) Damages recoverable by parents of unborn child limited to moral
damages. — “This is not to say that the parents are not entitled
to collect any damages at all. But such damages must be those
inflicted directly upon them, as distinguished from the injury or
violation of the rights of the deceased, his right to life and physical
integrity. Because the parents can not expect either help, support
or services from an unborn child, they would normally be limited
to moral damages for the illegal arrest of the normal development
of the spes hominis that was the foetus, i.e., on account of distress
and anguish attendant to its loss, and the disappointment of their
parental expectations (Art. 2217), as well as to exemplary damages,
if the circumstances should warrant them (Art. 2230).
In the case before us, both the trial court and the Court of
Appeals have not found any basis for an award of moral damages, evidently because the appellee’s indifference to the previous
abortions of his wife, also caused by the appellant herein, clearly
indicates that he was unconcerned with the frustration of his

Art. 2199

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

573

parental hopes and affections.’’

(4) Plaintiff’s primary concern was to obtain personal gain. — “The
lower court expressly found, and the majority opinion of the Court
of Appeals did not contradict it, that the appellee was aware of
the second abortion; and the probabilities are that he was likewise
aware of the first. Yet despite the suspicious repetition of the event
he appeared to have taken no steps to investigate or pinpoint
the causes thereof, and secure the punishment of the responsible
practitioner. Even after learning of the third abortion, the appellee
does not seem to have taken interest in the administrative and
criminal cases against the appellant. His only concern appears to
have been directed at obtaining from the doctor a large money
payment, since he sued for P50,000.00 damages and P3,000.00 attorney’s fees, an ‘indemnity’ claim that, under the circumstances
of record, was clearly exaggerated.
The dissenting Justices of the Court of Appeals have aptly
remarked that:
‘It seems to us that the normal reaction of a hushand who
righteously feels outraged by the abortion which his wife
has deliberately sought at the hands of a physician would
be high-minded rather than mercenary; and that his primary
concern would be to see to it that the medical profession was
purged of an unworthy member rather than turn his wife’s
indiscretion to personal profit, and with that idea in mind to
press either the administrative or the criminal cases he had
filed, or both, instead of abandoning them in favor of a civil
action for damages of which not only he, but also his wife,
would be the beneficiaries.’’’

(5) Immorality and illegality of act does not justify award of damage.
— “It is unquestionable that the appellant’s act in provoking the
abortion of appellee’s wife, without medical necessity to warrant
it, was a criminal and morally reprehensible act, that can not be
too severely condemned; and the consent of the woman or that
of her hsuband does not excuse it. But the immorality or illegality
of the act does not justify an award of damage that, under the
circumstances on record, have no factual or legal basis.’’ (Geluz
vs. Court of Appeals, 2 SCRA 801 [1961].)

Brief rulings on compensatory damages.
(1) Actual damages must be specifically pleaded and prayed
for. Where, however, the prayer mentions also “such further re-

574

DAMAGES

Art. 2199

lief as this Honorable may deem just and equitable,’’ the phrase
“such further relief’’ may be deemed to include “actual damages’’ if and when proved although not alleged in the answer.
(Heirs of Justina vs. Court of Appeals, 7 SCRA 72 [1963].)
(2) An award for compensatory damages may be executed
pending appeal but not an award for moral or exemplary damages which cannot be regarded as fixed or definite until there
is a final judgment. (Radio Communications of the Philippines,
Inc. vs. Lantin, 134 SCRA 395 [1985].)

(3) Compensatory damages simply make good or replace
the loss caused by the wrong. They proceed from a sense of
natural justice and are designed to repair that of which one has
been deprived by the wrong of another. (Algarra vs. Sandejas,
27 Phil. 284 [1914].)

(4) There is no proof of damages when the action is based
on the unsubstantiated and arbitrary supposition of the injustice
of a judgment which had become final by the fault or negligence
of the lawyer. (Heredia vs. Salinas, 10 Phil. 157 [1908].)

(5) No damages were allowed to defendant’s credit as
a consequence of the attachment secured by the plaintiff as
such damages were speculative and remote “It could hardly
be foreseen as a probable consequence of the suing out of the
attachment that the hands of the creditors would come down
upon their unfortunate client with such disastrous results. x x
x’’ (Songco vs. Sellner, 37 Phil. 254 [1917]; see Tan Ti vs. Alvear,
26 Phil. 566 [1914].)
(6) Interest may be recovered for failure to pay a sum of
money. Speculative and consequential profits and losses are too
remote to be included as damages. (Sun Life Insurance Co. vs.
Rueda Hermanos Co., 37 Phil. 845 [1918].)

(7) Evidence of a plan to plant sugarcane on land sold at
public auction and the estimated possible production is too
speculative to serve as the basis for awarding damages. (Standard Oil Co. vs. Castro, 54 Phil. 716 [1930].)
(8) A passenger who is entitled to recover damages cannot
recover for services gratuitously rendered nor to medical services
not reasonably suited to his case. (De Guia vs. Manila Electric

Art. 2200

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

575

Railroad and Light Co., 40 Phil. 706 [1920].)

(9) The inconvenience resulting from the loss of a home, or
its sentimental value to the owner is not a proper element of
damage. (Republic vs. Lara, 96 Phil. 170 [1954].)

(10) The appellate court cannot award the plaintiff who did
not appeal more than the amount of actual damages granted
by the lower court although the actual damages suffered by
him exceeded said amount. (Aguilar vs. Chan, 145 SCRA 673
[1986].)

(11) Where the party who request the attachment of property
acted in good faith and without malice, the claim for damages
resulting from the attachment cannot be sustained. (California
Bus Lines, Inc. vs. State Investment House, Inc., 418 SCRA 297
[2003]; Banque Generale Belge vs. Walter Bull & Co., Inc., 84
Phil. 164 [1949].)
(12) The fact that the mother of the murdered victim received
an amount from insurance will not affect the award of actual
damaes. (Catuiza vs. People, 13 SCRA 538 [1965]; People vs.
Garcia, 423 SCRA 583 [2004].)
Art. 2200. Indemnification for damages shall
comprehend not only the value of the loss suffered,
but also that of the profits which the obligee failed
to obtain. (1106)
Kinds of compensatory damages.
As provided in the present article, there are two (2) distinct
kinds of actual or compensatory damages:

(1) Loss suffered or actual loss, which is known as daño
emergente or damnum emergens; and

(2) Unrealized profits or the profits which the complainant
failed to obtain, by reason breach of contract or as a result of
the commission of quasi-delict, which is known as lucro cessante
or lucrum cesans. (see Art. 2205.)

These damages may be awarded for pecuniary loss in business, property, profession and occupation and for injury to

576

DAMAGES

Art. 2200

business goodwill.
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. Convinced that a fraudulent misrepresentation as to the character
of the engine bought by him had been perpetrated upon him, appellee
made demands from appellant for indemnification for damages and
eventually instituted a suit for damages.

Facts: Appellant GAMI, thru a duly authorized agent, offered to sell a brand-new Fordson Diesel Engine to appellee, H.
Yaptinchay (HY), owner of the freight hauling business styled
“Hi-way Express’’. Relying on the representations of appellant’s
representative that the engine offered for sale was brand-new,
appellee agreed to purchase the same at the price of P7,590.00.
Pursuant to the contract of sale thus entered into, appellant
delivered to appellee, one (1) Fordson Diesel Engine assembly
[Model 6-D, with Engine Serial No. A-212193, at 1500 RPM, with
fly wheel, fly wheel housing, fuel injection assembly, exhauster,
fuel filter, oil filter, fuel lift pump, plus conversion kit for F-500],
subject to the standard warranties, particularly the representation,
relied upon by appellee, that the same was brand-new. Said engine
was installed by appellant in Unit No. 6 of the Hi-Way Express.
Within the week after its delivery, however, the engine in question started to have a series of malfunctions which necessitated
successive trips to appellant’s repair shop. Thus, it first sprang
an oil leak such that, on February 6, 1962, it was brought in to
‘1. Adjust idling of engine and tappete clearance, 2. Inspect and
remedy oil leaks of engine, 3. Replace clutch disc and pressure
plate w/original; and 4. Replace release bearing hub trunion bolt’.

Thereafter, the malfunctioning persisted and, on inspection,
appellee’s mechanic noticed a worn out screw which made, appellee suspicious about the age of the engine. This prompted appellee, thru his lawyer, to write appellant a letter, protesting that
the engine was not brand-new as represented.
The repeatedly recurring defects and continued failure of appellant to put the engine in good operating condition only served
to firm up in appellee’s mind the suspicion that the engine sold
to him was not brand-new as represented. He then sought the assistance of the PC Criminal Investigation Service to check on the
authenticity of the serial number of the engine, with due notice to
appellant. Scientific examination and verification tests revealed that

Art. 2200

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

577

the original motor number of the engine aforesaid was tampered.

Further inquiries by appellee from the Manila Trading Company, which also handles the importation and distribution of
similar engines, also disclosed that, unlike the engine delivered
to appellee whose engine body and injection pump were painted
with two different colors, brand-new engines are painted with
only one color all over.

Issue: Is the award of actual damages by the Court of Appeals
in the amount of P54,000.48 in the form of lucro cessante justified?

Held: No. (1) Actual damages must be proved. — “x x x In Abubakar Tan vs. Tian Ho, L-18820, December 29, 1962 and Lim Giok vs.
Bataan Cigar and Cigarette Factory, L-15861, April 16, 1960, we held
that even if the allegations regarding the amount of damages in
the complaint are not specifically denied in the answer, such damages are not deemed admitted. In Tomassi vs. Villa-Abrille, L-7047,
August 21, 1958, Suntay Tanjangco vs. Jovellanos, et al., L-12332,
June 30, 1960, and Delfin v. Court of Agrarian Relations, et al.,
L-23358, March 14, 1967, we declared in no uncertain terms that
‘actual damages must be proved, and that a court cannot rely on
‘speculation, conjecture or guesswork’ as to the fact and amount
of damages, but must depend on actual proof that damages had
been suffered and on evidence of the actual amount. x x x
The fact that the defendant does not dispute the amount of
this kind of damages does not necessarily imply that the other
party outright is entitled to the award of damages.’’

(2) Evidence to recover damages under Articles 2200 and 2201.
— “Article 2200 of the Civil Code entitles the respondent to
recover as compensatory damages not only the value of the loss
suffered but also prospective profits while Article 2201 entitles the
respondent to recover all damages which may be attributed to the
non-peformance of the obligation. However, in order to recover
this kind of damages, the plaintiff must prove his case —
‘When the existence of a loss is established, absolute
certainty as to its amount is not required. The benefit to be
derived from a contract which one of the parties has absolutely
failed to perform is of necessity to some extent, a matter of
speculation, but the injured party is not to be denied all remedy for that reason alone. He must produce the best evidence
of which his case is susceptible and if that evidence warrants
the inference that he has been damaged by the loss of profits

578

DAMAGES

Art. 2200

which he might with reasonable certainty have anticipated but
for the defendant’s wrongful act, he is entitled to recover.’
(Cerrano v. Tan Chuco, 28 Phil. 312 quoted in Central Bank
of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals, 63 SCRA 431, 457.)’’

(3) Evidence of respondent insufficient. — “Applying the foregoing test to the instant case, we find the evidence of the respondent
insufficient to be considered within the purview of ‘best evidence.’
The bare assertion of the respondent that he lost about
P54,000.00 and the accompanying documentary evidence presented
to prove the amount lost are inadequate if not speculative. The
document itself merely shows that everytime a truck travels. Mr.
Yaptinchay earns P369.88. This amount is then multiplied by the
number of trips which the truck was allegedly unable to make. The
estimates were prepared by a certain Dionisio M. Macasieb whose
identity was not even revealed by the respondent. Mr. Yaptinchay
was in the freight truck business. He had several freight trucks
among them the truck with the subject Fordson diesel engine,
covering the route from Manila to Baguio.
To prove actual damages, it would have been easy to present
the average actual profits realized by the other freight trucks plying the Manila-Baguio route. With the presentation of such actual
income the court could have arrived with reasonable certainty at
the amount of actual damages suffered by the respondent. We rule
that the award of actual damages in the amount of P54,000.00 is
not warranted by the evidence on record.’’ (G.A. Machineries, Inc.
vs. Yaptinchay, 126 SCRA 78 [1983].)

2. By reason of the failure of appellant producer to deliver any
log in violation of its contract, appellee distributor failed to earn the
commissions it should have earned during the period of the contract.

Facts: LBL Co., defendant-appellant, and GE, Inc. plaintiffappellee, entered into a contract, whereby the former, a producer
of logs from a timber concession, designated the latter as distributor of a portion of its log production to Korea and Europe
on condition that it would pay the distributor a commission of
13% of the gross F.O.B. value of the logs exported. In the agreement, the LBL Co., Inc. was named as Producer and the General
Enterprises, Inc., as Distributor.
The parties immediately began implementing the provisions

Art. 2200

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

579

of the contract by having the Distributor deliver to the Producer
the tractor it agreed to deliver and by having the Producer deliver
logs to the Distributor for export as agreed upon. On October 27,
1959, the Producer sent a notice to the Distributor stating that after
the November shipment there will be no longer logs available for
export to Korea and Europe “unless the price of such logs become
comparable to what we may expect to receive in the way of returns from lumber and veneer of barterable and export grades,’’
giving as reasons therefore the following: x x x
The Producer thereafter stopped supplying logs for export,
whereupon the Distributor reminded the Producer that it had
a contract to fulfill relative to its log production as otherwise it
would be held responsible for the consequences of the breach that
may ensue, but the Producer did not heed this reminder adducing
reasons which in its opinion justify the action it had taken, thereby
causing the Distributor to initiate an action alleging breach of
contract and praying for damages both actual and compensatory.

In due time, both parties presented their evidence, and on
December 8, 1960, the court a quo rendered decision in favor of the
plaintiff and against the defendant ordering the latter to pay the
sum of P400,000.00 as actual damages, the sum of P100,000.00 as
exemplary damages, and the sum of P40,000.00 as attorney’s fees
and expenses of litigation. This is an appeal from said decision.

Regarding the actual damages awarded to appellee, appellant
contends that they are unwarranted inasmuch as appellee has
failed to adduce any evidence to substantiate them even assuming
arguendo that appellant has failed to supply the additional monthly
2,000,000 board feet for the remainder of the period agreed upon
in the contract. Appellant maintains that for appellee to be entitled
to demand payment of sales that were not effected it should have
proved (1) that there are actual sales made of appellee’s logs which
were not fulfilled, (2) that it had obtained the best price for such
sales, (3) that there are buyers ready to buy at such price stating
the volume they are ready to buy, and (4) appellee could not cover
the sales from the logs of other suppliers. Since these facts were
not proven, appellee’s right to unearned commissions must fail.

Issue: Has appellee failed to make profits because of appellant’s
breach of contract, and in the affirmative, is there here a basis
for determining with reasonable certainty such unearned profits?
Held: Yes. (1) Lucrum cesans is also a basis for indemnification. —
“Under Article 2200 of the Civil Code, indemnification for damages

580

DAMAGES

Art. 2200

comprehends not only the value of the loss suffered but also that
of the profits which the creditor fails to obtain. In other words,
lucrum cesans is also a basis for indemnification.

During the period of June to December, 1959, in spite of the
short delivery incurred by appellant, appellee had been earning
its commission whenever logs were delivered to it. But from January, 1960, appellee has ceased to earn any commission because
appellant failed to deliver any log in violation of their agreement.
Had appellant continued to deliver the logs as it was bound to
pursuant to the agreement it is reasonable to expect that it would
have continued earning its commission in much the same manner
as it used to in connection with the previous shipments of logs,
which clearly indicates that it failed to earn the commissions it
should earn during this period of time.’’

(2) Computation of the lucrum cesans. — “And this commission
is not difficult to estimate. Thus, during the seventeen remaining
months of the contract, at the rate of at least 2,000,000 board feet,
appellant should have delivered thirty-four million board feet. If
we take the number of board feet delivered during the months
prior to the interruption, namely, 7,405,861 board feet, and the
commission received by appellee thereon, which amounts to
P79,580.82, we would have that appellee received a commission
of P.0107456 per board feet. Multi-plying 34 million board feet by
P.0107456, the product is P365,350.40, which represents the lucrum
cesans that should accrue to appellee.
The award, therefore, made by the court a quo of the amount
of P400,000.00 as compensatory damages is not speculative, but
based on reasonable estimate.’’

(3) Award of exemplary damages. — “We believe, however, that
the amount of P100,000.00 awarded to appellee as exemplary
damages is somewhat excessive it appearing that appellant in
suspending the operation of the contract has not acted in a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner to deserve such a heavy
punishment within the purview of the law. (Article 2232, new
Civil Code).
The most that can be said is that appellant, to suit its purpose,
has availed to certain misstatements or half truths as reflected in
the declarations of Mr. Dempsey, one of its high officials, in an
attempt to justify its desistance from the contract. While this is
reprehensible, it is not a wanton or malevolent perversion of the
truth. Hence, the award should be mitigated, and in our opinion

Art. 2200

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

581

the amount of P50,000.00 is a reasonable exemplary penalty.’’

(4) Award of attorney’s fees. — “We also find reasonable the
amount awarded by the court a quo as attorney’s fees considering the importance of this litigation and the amount of time and
effort therein involved. This is justified under Article 2208 of the
Civil Code.’’ (General Enterprises, Inc. vs. Lianga Bay Logging, Co.,
Inc., 11 SCRA 733 [1964].)

3. Counsel for defendant received the decision in favor of plaintiff
on September 22, 1981 thru his daughter, but claimed he came to know
of it only on February 12, 1982 because his daughter was busy reviewing for an examination and she forgot to transmit the decision to him
immediately.

Facts: The case is for a sum of money and damages. On September 14, 1981, the trial court rendered a decision in favor of
the plaintiff. The decision was received by defendant’s counsel of
record, Atty. Usison on September 22, 1981 thru his daughter Susan.

In the motion to Quash Writ of Execution, the defendants
claimed that they came to know the decision of September 14,
1981, only on February 11, 1982, when the Writ of Execution was
implemented by the sheriff. Upon the other hand, Atty. Usison,
claimed that he came to know of the decision only on February
12, 1982, when his attention was called by his client about the
Writ of Execution which the sheriff sought to enforce.
Having been apprised thereon, Atty. Usison made an investigation and came to know that while the decision was received
in his law office on September 22, 1981, it was however received
by his daughter Susan. Incidentally, at the time of receipt Susan
was busy reviewing for examination and forgot to transmit the
decision to her father immediately. The defendants contend that
these circumstances constitute an excusable negligence.

The lower court denied the Urgent Omnibus Motion seeking
to quash the writ of execution and also the Petition for Relief
From Judgment for not being sufficient in form and substance.
The petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration but the same
was denied.
In the instant petition, the petitioners assail the denial of the
above motions, which, in effect, affirmed the finality of the lower
court’s decision dated September 14, 1981, ordering the petitioner
to pay the amounts stated in the dispositive portion:

“FOR ALL THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the

DAMAGES

Art. 2200

Court hereby renders judgment in favor of the plaintiff, ordering the defendants to pay the plaintiff jointly and severally
from the filing of the complaint, the amount of P182,053.292,
representing the value of 100 cartons of denim jeans lost,
plus the legal rate of interest: P160,155.00 representing Tariff and Customs duties paid by plaintiffs on the lost items:
P2,400,000.00 representing losses in the goodwill of plaintiff:
20% of the total amount as and for Attorney’s fees and to pay
the costs of these proceedings. x x x’’

Issue: The petitioners contend that the evidence does not justify
the award of P2,400,000.00 as damages representing losses in the
goodwill of the respondents, the interest thereof, and attorney’s
fees. They state that even if these amounts of damages were left
to the discretion of the court, it is entirely unconscionable.
Held: (1) Evidence to prove actual damages. — “In the case of
G.A. Machineries, Inc. v. Yaptinchay (126 SCRA 87), we ruled that
in order for damages under Article 2200 of the Civil Code to be
recovered, the best evidence obtainable by the injured party must
be presented, and thus, ‘the bare assertion of the respondent that
he lost about P54,000.00 and the accompanying documentary
evidence presented to prove the amount lost are inadequate if
not speculative.’
We further ruled that:

‘x x x To prove actual damages, it would have been easy
to present the average actual profits realized by the other
freight trucks plying the Manila-Baguio route. With the presentation of such actual income the court could have arrived
with reasonable certainty at the amount of actual damages
suffered by the respondent. We rule that the award of actual
damages in the amount of P54,000.00 is not warranted by the
evidence on record.’ ’’

(2) Evidence of respondents does not warrant award of damages.
— “In the case at bar, the respondents failed to furnish the best
evidence obtainable or even sufficient evidence in order to warrant the award by the lower court of such a generous amount of
P2,400,000.00.
The only basis for the award was the testimony of Mr. Hipolito,
the manager of the international department of respondent GTI
Sportswear Corporation. He testified that there was an order of
12,000 pieces of cotton jeans per month starting January, 1978 up
to the end of the year and that by December of the same year, the

Art. 2200

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

583

orders were completely cancelled by their customers who came
to know about the loss. No document or written instrument was
presented, whatsoever, to prove that there were really orders of
that volume from the respondents’ customers for the whole year
of 1978, and as in the Yaptinchay case, no evidence was presented
to show the average actual profits realized by the respondents
during the previous years to enable the lower court to reasonably
ascertain the amount of actual damages that the latter suffered.

The evidence cannot warrant the award of damages for the
loss of anticipated profits, much less in the amount of P2,400,000.00
which is way above the value of the cartons of denim jeans actually
lost. The complaint itself prayed only for unrealized profits due
to the loss of 100 cartons of jeans, something not clearly proved.’’

Brief rulings under Article 2200.
(1) The measure of damages due to the seller’s breach of
a contract of sale of copra, which the purchaser had to sell to
another person, should be the difference between the stipulated
price under the contract and the market price on the date agreed
upon for delivery. (Rivera vs. Matute, 98 Phil. 516 [1956].)
(2) A hotel which granted to the plaintiff under a written
contract the exclusive right to serve its patrons with his cars
for one (1) year, “with preference over others of renewing’’ for
another year, violated the contract when it did not renew the
same for which it was liable for damages under Articles 2200
and 2201. (Hicks vs. Manila Hotel, 28 Phil. 325 [1914].)
(3) For failure of petitioner cable company to deliver to
respondent spouses a cablegram from a New York hospital,
admitting the wife to a rotating internship, causing the wife to
lose the job, the company was held liable for actual, moral, and
exemplary damages, and attorney’s fees. (Globe Mackay Cable
& Radio Corp. vs. Barrios, 119 SCRA 461 [1982].)

(4) Where one was wrongfully dismissed by the hotel which
contracted her services as professional gymnast, she was entitled
to recover the full amount which she might have earned under
the contract, less such compensation which she actually obtained
or might have obtained in some other employment during the
unexpired period. (Coleman vs. Hotel de France Co., 29 Phil.

323 [1955]; Logan vs. Phil. Acetylene Co., 33 Phil. 177 [1915];
Berbari vs. General Oil Co., 43 Phil. 414 [1922].)

The action must be for both present and future salaries,
otherwise a subsequent suit for the salaries for the remaining
portion of the term of the employment contract will be barred.
(Hicks vs. Manila Hotel Co., 28 Phil. 362 [1914].)
(5) Where the discharged employee goes into other lucrative
business, his earning capacity in such business should be appreciated in mitigation of the unearned salary. (Sotelo vs. Behn,
Meyer & Co., 57 Phil. 775 [1933].) The employer may show in
mitigation of damages that the employee obtained remunerative
employment elsewhere or that in the exercise of due diligence
he might have obtained such employment. (Garcia vs. Hotel
de France Co., 42 Phil. 660 [1922]; Aldaz vs. Gay, 7 Phil. 268
[1906]; Knust vs. Moore, 41 Phil. 184 [1920].) The fact that the
employee by use of reasonable diligence could have obtained a
similar employment does not constitute a defense. It may only
mitigate the damages. (Lemoine vs. Alkan, 33 Phil. 162 [1915].)
(6) Loss of profits of an established business which was
yielding fairly steady returns at the time of its interruption by
defendant’s wrongful act is not so speculative or contingent
that a court may refuse to allow any damages at all. (Algarra
vs. Sandejas, 27 Phil. 284 [1914].)
(7) The aggrieved party was awarded damages of P250,000
as unrealized profits for violation of a boxing contract by defendant. (Boysaw vs. Sarreal, 148 SCRA 535 [1987].)

(8) Damages claimed by an injured party because a jaw
injury prevented him from going to school for one (1) year and
resulted in the reduction of his earning capacity are manifestly
speculative and may not exist at all. (Araneta vs. Arreglado, 104
Phil. 529 [1958].) Damages by way of unrealized profits may not
be awarded in the absence of supporting evidence. They cannot be based on pure assumption or conjecture. (Batong Buhay
Gold Mines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 147 SCRA 4 [1987].)
(9) Actual damages may be awarded due to wrongful attachment but the claim for unrealized profits cannot be granted if
the same is too speculative and conjectural to be made the basis

Art. 2200

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

585

of actual damages for a future period. (BA Finance Corporation
vs. Court of Appeals, 161 SCRA 608 [1988].)
(10) The damages recoverable from a manufacturer or dealer
for breach of warranty of machinery, which he contracts to
furnish and place in operation for a certain purpose, are not
confined to the difference between the value of the machinery
as warranted and as it proves to be, but includes such consequential damages as are the direct immediate and probable
result of the breach. (Rodriguez vs. Findlay & Co., 14 Phil. 294
[1909].)

(11) With regard to loss of profits of an established business,
the general rule is that satisfactory evidence must be presented
to prove the amount of business transacted before and after
the injury complained of. (Bian Hin & Co. vs. Tan Bomping,
48 Phil. 523 [1926]; Tan Te vs. Bell, 27 Phil. 354 [1914]; Algarra
vs. Sandejas, 27 Phil. 284 [1914]; Tan Ti vs. Alvear, 26 Phil. 566
[1913].)
Art. 2201. In contracts and quasi-contracts, the
damages for which the obligor who acted in good
faith is liable shall be those that are the natural and
probable consequences of the breach of the obligation, and which the parties have foreseen or could
have reasonably foreseen at the time the obligation
was constituted.
In case of fraud, bad faith, malice or wanton
attitude, the obligor shall be responsible for all
damages which may be reasonably attributed to the
non-peformance of the obligation. (1107a)
Measure of damages in contracts
and quasi-contracts.
This article distinguishes the liability of the two (2) kinds of
obligor or debtor in contracts2 and quasi-contracts3 and provides
for different measures of damages.

(1) Obligor in good faith. — He shall be liable for those damages “that are the natural and probable consequences of the

586

DAMAGES

Art. 2201

breach of the obligation, and which the parties have foreseen
or could have reasonably foreseen at the time the obligation
was constituted.’’

(2) Obligor in bad faith. — He “shall be responsible for
all damages which may be reasonably attributed to the nonperformance of the obligation.’’

In case of fraud, bad faith or wanton attitude, there is no
necessity that the damages are a natural and probable consequence and have been foreseen or could have reasonably been
foreseen by the parties, it being sufficient that they may be
reasonably attributed to the non-performance of the obligation,
that is, there exists a clear relation of cause and effect between
such non-performance and the damages sustained.
General and special damages.

A distinction should be made between two (2) kinds of
damages contemplated by Article 2201: general damages or the
natural and ordinary damages that are normally anticipated referred to in Article 2200, and special damages or compensatory
damages for a harm other than one for which general damages
are given, which exist because of special circumstances or conditions giving rise to such damages.

(1) General damages are those which are the natural and
necessary result of the wrongful act or omission asserted as
the foundation of the liability, and include those which follow
as a conclusion of law from the statement of the facts of the
injury. In other words, they are those which are traceable to,
and the probable and necessary result of, the injury, or which
are presumed by, or implied in, law to have resulted therefrom.
It does not mean that they must, a priori, inevitably and always
result therefrom. It is enough, if, in the particular instance, they
do, in fact, result from the wrong, directly and proximately,
and without reference to the special character, conditions or
himself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service. (1254a)

Art. 2142. Certain lawful, voluntary and unilateral acts give rise to the juridical
relation of quasi-contract to the end that no one shall be unjustly enriched or benefited at
the expense of another. (n)

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

587

circumstances of the person wronged.

The law then, as a matter of course, implies or presumes
them as the effect which necessarily results from the wrong.

(2) Special damages denote such damages (e.g., hospital and
doctor’s bills) as arise from the special circumstances of the
case, which, if properly pleaded, may be added to the general
damages which the law presumes or implies from the mere
invasion of the plaintiff’s rights. They are the natural, but not
the necessary result of an injury.

In other words, special damages actually, but not necessarily, result from the injury, and thus, are not implied by law. They
have been said to be such damages as, by competent evidence, are
directly traceable to a defendant’s failure to discharge his contract
obligations or such duties as are imposed upon him by law.
(3) Distinction not absolute. — The distinction between general
and special damages arising from the breach of a contract are not
absolute, but relative. In other words, damage which is general
in relation to a contract of one kind may be classified as special in
relation to another.

The distinction is principally important with regard to the
pleadings in damage actions. General damages, which necessarily result from the injury complained of, may be recovered
under general allegation of damage, whereas special damages
must be specially pleaded. (22 Am. Jur. 2d. 32-33.)

Whether the obligor is in good faith or in bad faith, general
damages are recoverable, but special damages may be recovered
only against an obligor in bad faith except that the obligor in
good faith can also be held liable for them when he knows or
has been previously informed of such special conditions.
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. Plaintiff claims damages for breach of contract incident to the
failure of defendant to supply alcohol upon the dates and in the amounts
stated in their two contracts.
Facts: Lo Seng, as manager of Lo Seng & Co., contracted in
writing to sell to Lim Siengco 1,000 arrobas of refined alcohol,

588

DAMAGES

Art. 2201

182 proof, at the price of P7 per arroba. The first delivery was
stipulated to be made on August 15, 1919, with weekly deliveries
of 150 arrobas of said alcohol until delivery should be completed.
On the same day, Lo Seng contracted in writing to sell to the
same Lim Siengco 6,000 arrobas of crude alcohol, of 80 proof, at
the price of P3 per arroba. It was agreed that deliveries under this
contract should be made at the rate of 1,000 arrobas commencing July 30 and at intervals of about fifteen days thereafter until
the entire quantity should be delivered. In connection with this
contract for the sale of the crude alcohol Lim Siengco advanced
the sum of P1,500 at the time of the making of the contract, and
another sum of P1,500 on July 24, thereafter. A little later Lim
Siengco delivered another P1,000, making P4,000 in all advanced
by the plaintiff upon this contract.
It was also stipulated that upon each delivery of crude alcohol
made by Lo Seng as per contract, the plaintiff should pay to Lo
Seng only P2.50 per arroba of the contract price, leaving 50 centavos
of the value of each arroba to be credited upon the advancements
made as already stated.

Some time after these contracts were made, Lo Seng delivered
about 128 arrobas of fine alcohol and about 468 arrobas of crude
alcohol, after which no deliveries whatever were made upon the
contract.
Issue: Did the trial court erred in refusing to award damages
to the plaintiff for breach of contract by the defendant.

Held: Yes. (1) Plaintiff never agreed to any change in the price
of crude alcohol bought. — “It is proved and not denied that the
plaintiff advanced P4,000, upon the contract for crude alcohol. In
return for this, he has received alcohol, both crude and fine, of a
total value of P2,507.79, at the price contracted to be paid for the
two sorts of alcohol respectively. Upon liquidation of accounts this
leaves a balance due to the plaintiff of P1,492.21, which should
undoubtedly be refunded. x x x There is no proof whatever that the
plaintiff ever waived his contracts or agreed to any change therein
by which the price of alcohol was changed from that stipulated.
It results that the plaintiff is clearly entitled to recover this
item of P1,492.21, as the balance due upon the amount advanced
by him upon the making of the contracts referred to.’’

(2) Measure of damages to which plaintiff is entitled. — “The
plaintiff’s manager prepared an exhibit on representing the dif-

Art. 2201

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

589

ference between the price stipulated in the contract and the price
of fine and crude alcohol in the market on the date the account
was stated. This mode of stating the damages resulting to the
plaintiff is incorrect, the true measure of damages being the difference between the contract price and the price prevailing in the
market at the stipulated time and place of delivery.’’

(3) Proof that plaintiff was compelled to buy alcohol in the open
market and paid the price therefore not required. — “The trial judge
entertained the idea that the plaintiff could not recover any
damages unless he should show that he was compelled to buy
alcohol in the open market to replace that which the defendant
had contracted to deliver; and his Honor refused to allow any
damages because the plaintiff had not clearly shown that he had
really purchased crude and fine alcohol of the kind expressed in
the contract and the prices paid therefore.

This idea is entirely unsound. If the plaintiff had in fact been
compelled to buy alcohol like that contracted for from some other
person than the defendant, this would have been competent proof
on the question of damages, if the purchase was effected at a higher
price than that stipulated in the contract with the defendant. But
the right of the plaintiff to recover damages was not absolutely
dependent upon proof of this character. As already stated, the correct measure of damages is to be found in the difference between
the contract price and the price prevailing in the market at the
time and place stipulated for the deliveries.’’

(4) Estimated loss to the plaintiff. — “A competent witness, Mr.
A.B. Powell, was examined with reference to the prices prevailing
in Manila for crude and fine alcohol of the quantity contracted
for during the period from July to December, 1919 (transcript of
session, Dec. 13, 1922, p. 10). Taking the prices stated by him as
approximately true, and estimating the prices of the crude and
fine alcohol at the times and in the amounts stipulated for delivery, we estimate roughtly that there was a loss to the plaintiff of
about P4,610, by reason of the failure of the defendant to make
deliveries upon his contracts at the times agreed.

Summing up the three items above specified and deducting
therefrom the amount of P909.84, which represents, according to
Simonson, the value of a delivery of alcohol of September 22, 1919,
which the plaintiff did not pay for, we have in round numbers the
sum of P6,000, which in our opinion is proper to be allowed the
plaintiff upon the two causes of action set forth in the complaint.’’

2. Appellants claim that the amount awarded as compensatory
damages is inadequate considering the nature and after effects of the
physical injuries suffered by the victim of a collision accident.

Facts: The lower court held that it was the negligence of the
bus driver that caused the accident and, as a result, rendered
judgment sentencing the LTB to pay Edgardo Cariaga (EC) the
sum of P10,490.00 as compensatory damages, with interest at
the legal rate from the filing of the complaint, and dismissing
the cross-claim against the Manila Railroad Company. From this
decision the Cariagas and the LTB appealed.
The Cariagas claim that the trial court erred: in awarding only
P10,490.90 as compensatory damages to Edgardo; in not awarding
them actual and moral damages; and in not sentencing appellant
LTB to pay attorney’s fees.

On the other hand, the LTB’s principal contention in this appeal is that the trial court should have held that the collision was
due to the fault of both the locomotive driver and the bus driver
and erred, as a consequence, in not holding the Manila Railroad
Company liable upon the cross-claim filed against it.

In connection with the appeal of LTB, its first contention is
that the driver of the train locomotive, like the bus driver, violated
the law, first, in sounding the whistle only when the collision was
about to take place instead of at a distance at least 300 meters
from the crossing, and second, in not ringing the locomotive
bell at all. Both contentions, however, were found without merit
because the LTB failed to satisfactorily discharge the burden of
proving affirmatively contributory negligence on the part of the
locomotive driver.

EC was first confined at a hospital from 5:00 p.m., June 18,
1952, to 8:25 a.m., June 20, of the same year when he was taken
to the De los Santos Clinic, Quezon City. He left that clinic on
October 14 to be transferred to the University of Santo Tomas
Hospital where he stayed up to November 15. On this last date,
he was taken back to the De los Santos Clinic where he stayed
until January 15, 1953. He was unconscious during the first 35 days
after the accident. At the De los Santos Clinic, a doctor removed
the fractured bones which lacerated the right frontal lobe of his
brain and at the University of Santo Tomas Hospital, he performed

Art. 2201

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

591

another operation to cover a big hole on the right frontal part of
the head with a tantalum plate.

Issue: Is the award of P10,490.00 as compensatory damages
to EC inadequate considering the nature and the after effects of
the injuries.

Held: Yes. (1) EC has become completely misfit. — “From the
deposition of Dr. Romeo Gustilo, a neuro-surgeon, it appears that,
as a result of the injuries suffered by Edgardo, his right forehead
was fractured necessitating the removal of practically all of the
right frontal lobe of his brain. From the testimony of Dr. Jose A.
Fernandez, a psychiatrist, it may be gathered that, because of the
physical injuries suffered by Edgardo, his mentality has been so
reduced that he can no longer finish his studies as a medical student; that he has become completely misfit for any kind of work;
that he can hardly walk around without someone helping him;
and that he has to use a brace on his left leg and feet.

Upon the whole evidence on the matter, the lower court
found that the removal of the right frontal lobe of the brain of
Edgardo reduced his intelligence by about 50%; that due to the
replacement of the right frontal bone of his head with a tantalum
plate Edgardo has to lead a quiet and retired life because ‘if the
tantalum plate is pressed in or dented, it would cause his death.’
The impression one gathers from this evidence is that, as a
result of the physical injuries suffered by EC, he is now in a helpless condition, virtually an invalid, both physically and mentally.’’

(2) Income which EC could earn within category of damages which
could have reasonably been foreseen by the parties. — “Appellant LTB
admits that under Art. 2201 of the Civil Code, the damages for
which the obligor, guilty of a breach of contract but who acted in
good faith, is liable shall be those that are the natural and probable
consequences of the breach and which the parties had foreseen
or could have reasonably foreseen at the time the obligation was
constituted, provided such damages, according to Art. 2199 of the
same Code, have been duly proved. Upon this premise, it claims
that only the actual damages suffered by EC consisting of medical, hospital and other expenses in the total sum of P17,719.75 are
within this category.
We are of the opinion, however, that the income which EC
could earn if he should finish the medical course and pass the corresponding board examinations must be deemed to be within the

592

DAMAGES

Art. 2201

same category because they could have reasonably been foreseen
by the parties at the time he boarded the bus No. 133 owned and
operated by the LTB. At that time he was already a fourth-year
student in medicine in a reputable university. While his scholastic
record may not be first rate, it is, nevertheless, sufficient to justify
the assumption that he could have finished the course and would
have passed the board test in due time.

As regards the income that he could possibly earn as a medical
practitioner, it appears that, according to Dr. Amado Doria, a witness for the LTB, the amount of P300.00 could easily be expected as
the minimum monthly income of EC had he finished his studies.
Upon consideration of all the facts mentioned heretofore, this
Court is of the opinion, and so holds, that the compensatory damages awarded to EC should be increased to P25,000.00.’’ (Cariaga
vs. Laguna-Tayabas Bus Company, 110 Phil. 346 [1960].)

3. Buyer of a machinery, including the propeller, for his freight
ship asks damages for breach by seller of contract because the propeller
did not give the ship a speed of about 9 knots per hour as required by
the contract.
Facts: The complaint asks damages for breach of a written
contract between the plaintiff (buyer) and the defendant for the
delivery of the machinery, complete, for a freight ship called
Constancia in process of construction belonging to the plaintiff.

The defendant, in its answer, denies the allegation of the complaint generally, and sets up as a counterclaim the balance due from
the plaintiff on the purchase price of the machinery aforesaid, and
asks for an affirmative judgment against the plaintiff accordingly.
The deendant secured in the trial court an affirmative judgment against the plaintiff for the sum of P9,216.60, with interest
thereon, at the rate of 6% per annum, from February 28, 1907.

Before the contract was entered into, the plaintiff delivered
to Swann, as the defendant’s agent, a plan of the hull of said
vessel. Thereafter, Swann delivered to the plaintiff a plan of the
entire vessel, showing the machinery placed therein. The plans in
question showed the length and breadth of the hull, its general
outline and the number of feet of water which it drew. These
plans also showed the location and outline of the sternpost and
rudderpost of said ship.
In the process of manufacturing the propeller, the defendant

Art. 2201

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

593

thought it discovered that the propeller described in the contract
would not give the speed required by the contract and notified
the plaintiff to that effect, and at the same time asked permission
to put in its place a propeller 10 feet in diameter. This the plaintiff
declined to permit.

The machinery, so purchased, was delivered, except certain
items which were required to be upon all vessels by the rules
of the customs officials of the City of Manila and about which
there is little or no dispute. Certain other articles of small value,
necessary for the completion of the machinery, seem not to have
been delivered, but concerning these there is very little dispute
between the parties.

The machinery was duly installed in the vessel upon its
delivery. Upon the trial of the ship, after the installation of its
machinery, it was found that all of the machinery worked well
except the propeller. This, instead of giving the ship a speed of
about 9 1/2 knots an hour, gave a speed of less than 7 knots an
hour. The failure of the propeller to give the required speed to the
vessel is substantially the only point in controversy in this case.
The contention of the plaintiff is that, under the terms of the
contract, the defendant was obliged the furnish a propeller 8 feet
in diameter which would give the Constancia a speed of 9 1/2
knots an hour, and that, failing in that, the contract was broken
and the defendant should be held liable for all damages resulting.
The contract, by its words, expressly requires that the defendant must furnish a propeller which shall give to the steamship
Constancia a speed of about 9 1/2 knots per hour.
Issue: Is the defendant entitled to damages on ground of breach
of the contract by the plaintiff?

Held: Yes. (1) Language of the contract without ambiguity. —
“The words of the contract clearly demand, upon the part of the
defendant, that it furnish a propeller with a pitch proper to give
the steamship Constancia a speed of about 9 1/2 knots an hour.
Language for that purpose could scarcely be made plainer than
the language used. x x x

It was a condition, and not a theory, which confronted the
plaintiff when he purchased the machinery in question, including the propeller. He had a vessel which was designed for the
coastwise trade and, in order to be useful and efficient in that

594

DAMAGES

Art. 2201

connection, it was necessary that it should have a speed of about
9 1/2 knots an hour. All of this the defendant knew. Speed being
so important in a vessel carrying freight in competition with other
vessels having a speed at 9 1/2 knots an hour, the parties placed
in the contract a specification by which the vessel should receive
machinery of such a character that it would be able to compete
with other vessels in a similar occupation. These specifications
required that the vessel should have a speed of about 9 1/2 knots
per hour and that the machinery furnished for the vessel should
be arranged to that end, particularly the propeller. x x x
There seems to be no question that the expert witness for the
plaintiff was entirely correct when he stated that the fault of the
propeller furnished by the defendant was in its pitch and area.
He testified that the pitch of the propeller was too course and the
area was too great for the kind of vessel in which it was placed.”

(2) Damages recoverable. — “It is thus apparent that the defendant failed to comply with the terms of the contract in respect to
the propeller therein described, and the plaintiff, in consequence,
is entitled to recover appropriate damages by reason thereof.
The damages recoverable of a manufacturer or dealer for the
breach of warranty of machinery which he contracts to furnish
or place in operation for a known purpose are not confined to
the difference in value of the machinery as warranted and as it
proves to be, but include such consequential damages as are the
direct, immediate, and probable result of the breach. (30 Am. And
Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 217, and cases there cited.)
The loss of the buyer’s time and of that of his laborers resulting from the breach is recoverable where the circumstances of the
sale were such as to have put the seller upon notice that such a
loss would probably result from a breach.’’

(3) Measure of damages. — “In an action against a manufacturer
or dealer for a breach of warranty upon a sale of goods, which
he knew at the time of the sale were intended to be used for a
particular purpose, the measure of damages is not limited to the
difference in value of the goods as warranted, and as they prove
to be, as in cases where like articles are sold as merchandise for
general purposes; but profits lost and expenses incurred, because
of the breach, may be recovered.’’
(4) Items of damages for breach of contract. — “It is apparent
from the authorities above cited that the plaintiff is entitled to

Art. 2201

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

595

recover P375, the value of 30 tons of coal consumed in the trials
necessarily made to determine whether or not the propeller had
the qualities specified in the contract; also the sum of P707, the
wages of employees and other necessary expenses incurred during
said trials.
The plaintiff not having presented competent proof as to the
loss he sustained by reason of his ship being out of commission
during the time intervening between the trial of the first propeller
and the installation of the second, nothing can be awarded him as
damages in relation thereto. He is, however, entitled to be allowed
as damages the sum of P2,770.36, the amount paid by him for the
first propeller, as its purchase price, the same being worthless to
him for the purpose for which he bought it — said propeller to
be and remain the property of the defendant, with the right to
retake the same if it has not already done so.

The defendant failed to deliver to the plaintiff the following
machinery and materials which it agreed to deliver under the
contract, which said machinery and materials the plaintiff was
obliged to purchase of other parties, paying therefor the following prices, which this court finds reasonable in amount, to wit: x
x x Total.......... P1,133.45
We find, therefore, that the defendant is entitled to recover
in this action of the plaintiff the sum of P5,213.54, that being the
difference between the balance remaining due from plaintiff to the
defendant on the purchase price of said machinery, viz, P10,199.35,
and the aggregate amount of the damages herein allowed to the
plaintiff by reason of the breach of said contract by the defendant,
as aforesaid, viz., P4,985.81, with interest on said P5,213.54 at the
rate of 6 per cent per annum from February 28, 1907, and he is
hereby given judgment for that amount.’’ (Rodriguez vs. Findlay
& Co., 14 Phil. 294 [1909].)

Brief rulings under Article 2201.
(1) The damages ordinarily and normally recoverable against
a vendor for failure to deliver land which he has contracted
to deliver is the value of the use and occupation of the land
for the time during which it is wrongfully withheld. And, of
course, where the purchaser has not paid the purchase money, a
deduction may be made in respect to the interest on the money
which constitutes the purchase price.

596

DAMAGES

Art. 2201

Substantially, the same rule holds with respect to the liability
of a landlord who fails to put his tenant in possession pursuant
to a contract of lease. The measure of damages is the value of
the leasehold interest, or use and occupation, less the stipulated
rent, where this has not been paid. (Daywalt vs. La Corporacion
De Los Padres Agustinos Recoletos, 104 Phil. 397 [1919].)
(2) More extensive damages may be recovered where, at the
time of the creation of the contractual obligation, the vendor
or lessor, is aware of the use to which the purchaser or lessee
desires to put the property which is the subject of the contract,
and the contract is made with the eyes of the vendor or lessor
open to the possibility of the damage which may result to the
other party from his own failure to give possession. (Ibid.)

(3) Ordinary damages are found in all breaches of contract
where there are no special circumstances to distinguish the case
specially from other contracts. The consideration paid for an
unperformed promise is an instance of this sort of damage. In
all such cases, the damages recoverable are such as naturally
and generally would result from such a breach, “according to
the usual course of things.” In cases involving only ordinary
damage, no discussion is ever indulged as to whether that damage was contemplated or not. This is conclusively presumed
from the immediateness and inevitableness of the damage,
and the recovery of such damage follows as a necessary legal
consequence of the breach. Ordinary damage is assumed as a
matter of law to be within the contemplation of the parties.
(Ibid.)
(4) Special damage, on the other hand, is such as follows
less directly from the breach than ordinary damage. It is only
found in case where some external condition, apart from the
actual terms to the contract exists or intervenes, as it were, to
give a turn to affairs and to increase damage in a way that the
promisor, without actual notice of that external condition, could
not reasonably be expected to foresee. Before such damage can be
recovered, the plaintiff must show that the particular condition
which made the damage a possible and likely consequence of
the breach was known to the defendant at the time the contract
was made. (Ibid.)

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

(5) Where the vendor a retro repurchased on January 2, the
land sold but the vendee a retro who was in possession, did
not vacate the property after having used it gratuitously, he
should pay as damages reasonable monthly rental from January 3, until his house is removed and the land vacated by his
heirs. (Floreza vs. Evangelista, 16 SCRA 130 [1980].)

(6) Where an air carrier fails to deliver a movie film intended
for exhibition during a town fiesta, it cannot be held liable to
the shipper for unrealized profits, if the carrier could not have
foreseen the damages that would be suffered by the shipper for
the reason that it had not been informed of the need to deliver
the film in time for said fiesta. (Mendoza vs. Philippine Air
Lines, 90 Phil. 836 [1952].)
(7) Where the plaintiff distributor would have continued
to earning its commission, had not the defendant discontinued
the distribution contract, the plaintiff is entitled to damages for
defendants fraudulent breach of the agency contract. (General
Enterprises, Inc. vs. Lianga Bay Logging Co., Inc., 120 Phil. 702
[1964], 11 SCRA 733 [1964].)

(8) The damages to which the buyer of sugar is entitled is
the difference between the contract price and the amount for
which he would have sold the sugar in the market, when the
sugar should have been delivered by the seller. (Suiliong & Co.
vs. Ylagan, 43 Phil. 393 [1922]; see Enriquez vs. Diaz, 37 Phil.
982 [1918]; Castle Brothers vs. Gutierrez Hermanos, 11 Phil. 629
[1908].)
In other words, it is the difference between the value of the
goods sold at the stipulated date of delivery and the date of
actual delivery. Reasonable expenses caused by the delay of the
carrier (or buyer) may be added. (see Uy Chaco vs. Admiral
Line, 46 Phil. 415 [1924]; see Suiliong & Co. vs. Nanyo Shoji
Kaisha, 42 Phil. 722 [1922]; Lim Siengco vs. Lo Seng, 45 Phil.
732 [1924]; Lutero vs. Suilong & Co., 54 Phil. 272 [1929]; Rivera
vs. Matute, 98 Phil. 516 [1956].)
(9) Where the seller reserved the right to indemnification
for damages which he might incur for failure of the buyer to
complete the payments, the damages recoverable by the seller

598

DAMAGES

Art. 2201

under the stipulation do not include the unpaid balance of the
purchase price, since such obligation was abrogated by reason
of the rescission. The seller must prove any special damages
that he might suffered. (Estrella Oriental vs. Matsumi Nakema,
54 Phil. 294 [1929].)
(10) In ascertaining the value of a particular commodity in
a given market at a given time, or the price it ought to have
brought if then offered for sale, it is necessary to assume the
presence of a buyer at the hypothetical sale able and willing
to buy the said commodity at its fair and reasonable valuation
in the quantity and with the quality in which it is supposed to
be offered for sale. (Compagnie French-Indochinoise vs. Deutch,
39 Phil. 474 [1919] and 36 Phil. 643 [1917].)
(11) Where because of breach of a building contract by the
defendant owners, the cost to the plaintiff contractor would be
greater, the defendants will be liable for the damages caused to
the plaintiff in addition to the stipulated contract price. (Adams
vs. Sociedad Naton, 39 Phil. 838 [1919].)

(12) An air carrier is not liable for breach of contract for
having dishonored plane tickets of persons which had already
expired. (Air France vs. Court of Appeals, 126 SCRA 44 [1983].)
Art. 2202. In crimes and quasi-delicts, the defendants shall be liable for all damages which are
the natural and probable consequences of the act
or omission complained of. It is not necessary that
such damages have been foreseen or could have
reasonably been foreseen by the defendant.
Measure of damages in crimes and quasi-delicts.
(1) Limited to a fair compensation for the harm done. — In
awarding damages for tortious injury, it becomes the sole design
of the courts to provide for adequate compensation by putting
the plaintiff in the same financial position he was in prior to
the tort.
It is fundamental principle in the law on damages that a
defendant cannot be held liable in damages for more than the
actual loss which he has inflicted and that a plaintiff is entitled

Art. 2201

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

599

to no more than the just and adequate compensation for the
injury suffered. His recovery is, in the absence of circumstances
giving rise to an allowance of punitive damages, limited to a fair
compensation for the harm done. The law will not put him in a
position better than where he should be in had not the wrong
happened. (Lim vs. Court of Appeals, 373 SCRA 396 [2002].)

(2) Same as contractual debtor in bad faith. — The rule in
measuring damages in crimes and quasi-delicts is the same
as the rule in breach of contracts and quasi-contracts where
the obligor acted in good faith (Art. 2201.), except that the accused or defendant must answer for such damages whether
he had foreseen them or not. This qualification in Article 2202
can reasonably be interpreted as implying that the accused or
defendant “shall be responsible for all damages which may be
reasonably attributed’’ to the act or omission complained of.

Consequently, the accused or defendant shall be responsible
in the same manner as a contractual debtor in bad faith, not
only for the natural and probable consequences of his act or
omission but also for all damages which may be reasonably
attributed thereto, whether or not they have been foreseen or
could have reasonably been foreseen by him.
Examples:

(1) X negligently runs over Y, inflicting injuries. Although
X knows Y’s condition, he drives away and leaves Y lying in
the road. Y, unable to move, contacts pneumonia for which
he was hospitalized for several days.
X is subject to liability to Y for the illness although it
was not foreseen by X.

(2) Intending to humiliate Y but without the intention
to cause serious bodily harm, X kicks Y on the shin. Y is
suffering from a diseased leg of which X neither knows nor
has reason to know. The blow so aggravates the diseased
condition as to result in a prolonged and expensive illness,
which finally leads to permanent harm to Y’s leg.
X is subject to liability to Y for the permanent harm to
his leg, although it was not foreseen by X.

DAMAGES

Art. 2202

Brief rulings under Article 2202.

(1) Damages due to a death resulting from a crime may consist of indemnity for the victim’s death, loss of earning capacity,
moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney’s fees, litigation
expenses, and interest in proper cases. (Briñas vs. People, 125
SCRA 687 [1983].) When death occurs as a result of a crime, the
heirs of the deceased are entitled to be indemnified, without
need of any proof. (People vs. Pidoy, 405 SCRA 339 [2003]; see
Art. 2206.)
(2) The income which an injured bus passenger, a medical
student, who could no longer finish his studies because of his
reduced mental capacity, could have earned had he become a
doctor, is within the category of “natural and probable consequences’’ of the accident. (Cariaga vs. Laguna Tayabas Bus Co.,
110 Phil. 346 [1960].)
(3) The driver who negligently run over an eight year-old boy
was held liable to pay the moral damages without proof of the
actual damages she suffered as she was prematurely deprived
of the aid and assistance of the boy who would have given her
aid and assistance if he had lived to be a man. (Manzanares vs.
Moreta, 38 Phil. 821 [1918].)

(4) When the civil liability sought to be enforced in an action for damages is based on a crime or delict, the common
carrier’s alleged diligence in the selection and supervision of its
employees is not a defense. (M.D. Transit & Taxi Co., Inc. vs.
Court of Appeals, 130 Phil. 609, 90 SCRA 542 [1967].); if based
on quasi-delict, it is a defense. (see Art. 2180, Chap. 6, Part I.)

(5) If a passenger is killed in an accident through the
negligence of the taxi-driver, the civil liability of the driver is
based on crime or quasi-delict, as the case may be, but the taxioperator’s liability is based on the contract of carriage. (Maranan
vs. Perez, 20 SCRA 412 [1967]; see Briñas vs. People, 125 SCRA
687 [1983].)
Art. 2203. The party suffering loss or injury must
exercise the diligence of a good father of a family
to minimize the damages resulting from the act or
omission in question.

Art. 2202

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

601

Duty of injured party to minimize damages.
It is an elementary principle of law that a party claiming
damages must not be at fault in contributing to them by his
own negligence.

(1) Effect of failure to perform duty. — The legal provision
clearly obligates the party injured whether by a wrongful or
negligent act or omission or a breach of contract to take such
measures as prudent men usually take under the circumstances
as would alleviate and not aggravate his condition, to reduce
the damages as much as possible. (Velasco vs. Manila Electric
Co., 40 SCRA 342 [1971]; Manila Electric Co. vs. Court of Appeals, 114 SCRA 173 [1982]; Cerrano vs. Tan Chuco, 38 Phil. 329
[1918].)
No liability for damages which would have been avoided
with ordinary care and reasonable expense can be enforced or
such liability may be reduced, when the claimant, being in a
position to do so, did nothing to avoid or minimize his loss.
(2) Existence of duty not presumed. — The duty to minimize
damages does not imply that damages sustained by the plaintiff can be or should have been minimized. While the duty is
imposed by law, there is no presumption to that effect. The
defendant has the burden to show satisfactorily not only that
the injured party could have mitigated his damages but also the
amount thereof. If he fails in this regard, the amount of damages cannot be proportionately reduced. (see Hicks vs. Manila
Hotel Co., 28 Phil. 322 [1914]; Lemoine vs. Alkan, 33 Phil. 162
[1916].)
(3) Right of injured party. — The injured party may recover
expenses or for time lost in reasonable efforts to prevent or
minimize his damages. (15 Am. Jur. 2d. 424.)
Doctrine of avoidable consequences.
Article 2203 embodies this doctrine. Injured victims have
a responsibility to act reasonably to limit or mitigate losses
incurred.

602

DAMAGES

Art. 2203

Example: If X suffers personal injury as a result of Y’s
negligence, X is expected to seek appropriate medical care
to avoid more serious consequences from the injury. If X
fails to act reasonably to mitigate his injuries, Y will not be
held liable for incremental losses that otherwise could have
been avoided.
Failure to mitigate should be distinguished from contributory
negligence which contributed to causing the accident responsible
for the injury. (see Art. 2214.)
Example: The unreasonable failure to wear a motorcycle
helmet or seat belt is sometimes characterized as a lapse
in “anticipatory mitigation.’’ The lack of a helmet doesn’t
contribute to an accident occurring but increases the likelihood that incremental damages will result if an accident
occurs.
In the above example, court may allocate what it perceives
as a fair portion of the damage attributable to a failure of anticipatory mitigation to the plaintiff. (Diamond, Levine & Madden,
Understanding Torts, 1996 Ed., pp. 238-239.)
Brief rulings under Article 2203.
(1) A discharged employee is under a continuous obligation
to use reasonable diligence to obtain other suitable employment.
(Garcia vs. Hotel de France Co., 42 Phil. 660 [1922].)

(2) A victim cannot recover the cost of medical treatment
abroad if the same could have been satisfactorily performed
by local practitioners. (see Araneta vs. Arreglado, 104 Phil. 529
[1958]; Gatchalian vs. Delin, 203 SCRA 126 [1991]; Ong vs. Court
of Appeals, 301 SCRA 387 [1999].)
(3) Neither can one recover for charges of professional medical specialists when their medical services are not reasonably
demanded by the nature of his injuries. (see De Guia vs. Manila
Electric Railroad and Light Co., 40 Phil. 706 [1920].)
(4) Where the private respondent left the damaged passenger
jeepney by the roadside to corrode and decay, the defendant
should not be held liable for the damages caused thereby. (Lim

vs. Court of Appeals, 373 SCRA 394 [2002].)

(5) Where as a consequence of the refusal of the injured
party to submit to an operation, a series of infections ensued
and which required constant and expensive medical treatment
for several years, the defendant should not be charged with the
expenses. (Lasam vs. Smith, 45 Phil. 657 [1924].)
Art. 2204. In crimes, the damages to be adjudicated
may be respectively increased or lessened according
to the aggravating or mitigating circumstances.
Increase or reduction of damages
in crimes.
Mitigating circumstances, when present in the commission
of a crime, serve to reduce the penalty imposed by law, while
aggravating circumstances serve to increase the penalty. They
are based on the lesser or greater perversity of the offender
manifested in the commission of the crime.
Accordingly, the liability for damages may be respectively
increased or lessened depending on the presence of mitigating
or aggravating circumstances.
ILLUSTRATIVE CASE:

The appellant was found guilty of two crimes of homicide only, the
killing not being attended by any qualifying nor aggravating circumstance,
but extenuated by the privileged mitigating circumstance of incomplete
self-defense in view of the presence of unlawful aggression on the part
of the victims and lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the appellant — and by two generic mitigating circumstances of voluntary
surrender and passion and obfuscation.
Facts: Four individuals, together with D Fleischer and F. Rubia
were fencing the land of G. Fleischer, father of D. Fleischer. At
the place of the fencing are the house and rice drier of appellant
M. Narvaez

At that time, Narvaez was taking his rest, but when he heard
that the walls of his house were being chiselled, he arose and
there he saw the fencing going on. If the fencing could go on, he
could be prevented from getting into his house and the bodega of
his ricemill. So he addressed the group, saying — “Pare, if possible you stop destroying my house and if possible we will talk

604

DAMAGES

Art. 2204

it over — what is good,’’ addressing the deceased Rubia, who is
appellant’s compadre. The deceased Fleischer, however, answered:
‘No gademit, proceed, go ahead.’’
Appellant apparently lost his equilibrium and he got his gun
and shot Fleischer, hitting him. As Fleischer fell down, Rubia
ran towards the jeep, and knowing there was a gun in the jeep,
appellant fired at Rubia, likewise hitting him. Both Fleischer and
Rubia died as a result of the shooting.
It appears that the incident was interwined with the long drawn
legal battle between the Fleischer & Co. of which deceased F. Fleischer and Rubia were officers, on the one hand, and the land settlers
of Cotabato, among which was the appellant.

The appellant was ordered by the trial court to pay each
group of heirs of the deceased P12,000 as compensatory damages,
P10,000 as moral damages, and, P2,000 as attorney’s fees, and to
pay the costs of the suit.
Issue: Should the civil liability of the appellant be modified?

Held: Yes. (1) Victims provoked the attack. — “In the case of Zulueta vs. Pan American World Airways (43 SCRA 397), the award for
moral damages was reduced because the plaintiff contributed to
the gravity of defendant’s reaction. In the case at bar, the victims
not only contributed but they actually provoked the attack by
damaging appellant’s properties and business. Considering appellant’s standing in the community, being married to a municipal
councilor, the victims’ actuations were apparently designed to
humiliate him and destroy his reputation.
The records disclose that his wife, councilor Feliza Narvaez,
was also charged in these two cases and detained without bail
despite the absence of evidence linking her to the killings. She was
dropped as a defendant only upon motion of the prosecution.’’

(2) Appellant and his family deserve leniency. — “Moreover, these
cases arose out of an inordinate desire on the part of Fleischer and
Company, despite its extensive landholdings in a Central Visayan
province, to extend its accumulation of public lands to the resettlement areas of Cotabato. Since it had the capability — financial
and otherwise — to carry out its land accumulation scheme, the
lowly settlers, who uprooted their families from their native soil in
Luzon to take advantage of the government’s resettlement program,
but had no sufficient means to fight the big landowners, were the
ones prejudiced. Thus, the moral and material suffering of appellant and his family deserves leniency as to his civil liability.’’

(3) Appellant without property to meet his civil liabilities. — “Furthermore, Article 39 of the Revised Penal Code requires a person
convicted of prision correccional or arresto mayor and fine who has no
property with which to meet his civil liabilities to serve a subsidiary
imprisonment at the rate of one (1) day for each P2.50. However, the
amendment introduced by Republic Act No. 5465 on April 21, 1969
made the provisions of Art. 39 applicable to fines only and not to
reparation of the damage caused, indemnification of consequential
damages and costs of proceedings.

Considering that Republic Act 5465 is favorable to the accused
who is not a habitual delinquent, it may be given retroactive effect
pursuant to Article 22 of the Revised Penal Code. x x x
Appellant is hereby sentenced x x x to indemnify each group
of heirs x x x in the sum of P4,000,00 without subsidiary imprisonment and without any award for moral damages and attorney’s
fees.’’ (People vs. Narvaez, 121 SCRA 389 [1983].)

Art. 2205. Damages may be recovered:

(1) For loss or impairment of earning capacity in
cases of temporary or permanent personal injury;
(2) For injury to the plaintiff’s business standing
or commercial credit.
Principle of a single recovery.
Perhaps the most salient feature of the law governing damages in tort cases is that in the ordinary case, the plaintiff gets
only a single recovery, providing compensation not only for
past but also for future losses, if any. Naturally, this principle
of a single recovery has both advantages and disadvantages.

(1) Advantages. — The great advantage of the principle is
that the case does not go on forever. Once there has been a trial
and appeals have concluded, there is legal closure.
(a) For the plaintiff, the benefit of closure is that he can
get on with his life, both psychologically and physically. The
more injured and hurting the plaintiff appears to be at trial,
the more damages the court is likely to award. Under the
principle of a single recovery, once that recovery is obtained,
the legal incentive for the plaintiff to stay sick or injured
disappears. The defendant derives enormous benefits from

606

DAMAGES

Art. 2204

closure as well.

(b) The defendant gets repose that is very similar to
the effect of the running of a statute of limitations. Once a
case has concluded, the defendant’s financial exposure and
vulnerability to the plaintiff have ended. Economic planning
can proceed without uncertainty about whether there will
be further liability to the plaintiff in the future.

(c) Finally, for the legal system, the advantage of a single
recovery is the avoidance of multiple judicial proceedings
and their consequent administrative cost.

(2) Disadvantages. — There can be no doubt, however, that
there are disadvantages to the principle of a single recovery.

(a) One is that there is almost certainly less accuracy in
estimating future damages than there would be if determinations were made periodically as losses were incurred.
Predicting how injured (if at all) the plaintiff will be in the
future, and then calculating the amount of medical expenses,
lost wages, and pain and suffering that will result from the
plaintiff’s injuries is bound to be an exercise in informed
estimation at best. If awards were made periodically as losses
were incurred, surely greater accuracy could be achieved.

(b) A second disadvantage is that the plaintiff must be
a good investor or he will not have the award when he
needs it in the future. This need for investment of awards
for future losses is underscored by the practice of discounting awards to present value.

(3) Discounting awards to present value. — The principle of
a single recovery requires the court to “discount to present
value’’ awards made for future losses by awarding less than
the absolute peso amount of those losses. The reason for this
requirement is the “time’’ value of money that is invested today
for future needs.

For example, if the plaintiff is injured today and will continue for the next 10 years to incur medical expenses and suffer
physical pain from that injury, making an accurate award for
her future losses requires two steps.
First, the court must determine what medical expenses the

Art. 2205

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

607

plaintiff will incur and how much physical pain he will suffer
in each future year, and place a peso value on those losses. One
way to do this is to assume that there will be no inflation in the
future. Another approach, which requires even more speculation
about what the future will bring, is to estimate what effect future
inflation will have on such items of loss as medical expenses and
wages, and then to take this inflation into account in predicting
the peso value of the plaintiff’s future losses.
Either way, a second step is required. Because the function
of an award of damages is to compensate the plaintiff for his
losses and no more, an award today of the full amount that
the plaintiff will lose in the future would constitute overcompensation. If invested today, that sum would earn interest or
otherwise appreciate in value. By the time the losses for which
the damages intended to compensate the plaintiff were actually incurred, the plaintiff would have a sum greater than the
amount of those losses.

The amount of a future loss must, therefore, be discounted
to present value, i.e., reduced to a sum which, if invested, will
equal the amount of the future loss at the time it occurs.

(4) Need for a uniform discount rate. — This is a mathematical
exercise which can easily be accomplished using “present value’’
tables. But to use a present-value table one must determine
what “discount’’ rate to use.
The discount rate is simply the reverse of an assumption
about what rate of interest the plaintiff’s damages award will
earn while it is invested by the plaintiff. If the amount of the
award was arrived at on the supposition that there will be no
inflation in the future, then a “pure’’ rate of interest (one which
ignores the possibility of inflation) will be used to determine the
appropriate discount rate. But if the award assumed that there
would be inflation, then on inflation-adjusted interest rate will
have to be used to determine the discount rate.
(5) “Pure’’ rate of interest/inflation-adjusted interest rate. — These
seeming technicalities have two important implications.

First, unless a jurisdiction has adopted uniform rules regarding the appropriate discount rate to be employed in determining
the present value of an award, then any case involving poten-

608

DAMAGES

Art. 2205

tially substantial future losses is likely to involve testimony
by experts about future inflation and the appropriate discount
rate. This has always seemed to be an unnecessary as well as
an unfortunate exercise, since the result is that different courts
will make different findings about how much inflation there will
be in the future or what the market rate of interest would be in
the future if there were no inflation, both equally speculative.
It would make a lot more sense to have a uniform discount
rate, promulgated annually by rule of court or otherwise arrived at.

Second, for the theory underlying the principle of a single
recovery to work in practice, the plaintiff must be at least an
average investor. The discounting of damage awards to present
value assumes that the portion of a single recovery awarded
for future losses will appreciate over time through investment.
If that appreciation does not occur as assumed by the discount
rate used, then the plaintiff will ultimately find himself without
sufficient funds to compensate him for losses when they are
incurred and a major purpose of the law of tort damages will
not be served. (K.S. Abraham, op. cit., pp. 207-209.)
Loss or impairment of earning capacity.
(1) Partakes of the nature of actual damages. — One who is injured in his person by the wrongful act of another may recover
for any loss sustained through being temporarily deprived of
his capacity to perform his ordinary labor or to attend to his
ordinary business — that is, he may recover for any loss of
earnings, provided they are shown with reasonable certainty
and not merely speculative. (15 Am. Jur. 2d 449-500.)

The actual value of the loss of earning capacity must be
adequately established. Indemnification for the loss of earning
capacity partakes of the nature of actual damages and must be
proved not only by credible and satisfactory evidence but also
by unbiased proof. (People vs. Guillermo, 420 SCRA 326 [2004];
People vs. Sara, 417 SCRA 431 [2003].)
(2) Proof of deceased’s average income and expenses. — The selfserving testimony of a witness, being unreliable, is not enough
in the absence of documentary evidence. For lost income to

Art. 2205

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

609

be recovered there must be unbiased proof of the deceased’s
average, not just gross, income. (People vs. Rollon, 410 SCRA
295 [2003].) as well as proof of average expenses. The award
of lost income refers to the net income of the victim, that is,
the total income less average expenses. Without proof of the
victim’s average expenses, there can be no reliable estimate
of lost earnings. (People vs. Gumayao, 414 SCRA 539 [2003];
People vs. Abadies, 387 SCRA 317 [2002].)
(3) Exceptions to rule requiring documentary evidence. — There
are only two (2) exceptions to the general rule requiring documentary evidence for claims for damages for loss of earning
capacity, provided there is testimony that the victim is;
(a) self-employed earning less than the minimum wage
under current labor laws, and judicial notice may be taken
of the fact that in the victim’s line of work, no documentary
evidence is available; or
(b) employed as a daily wage worker earning less than
the minimum wage under the current labor laws. (People
vs. Oco, 412 SCRA 190 [2003]; People vs. Buenavidez, 411
SCRA 202 [2003]; People vs. Caraig, 400 SCRA 67 [2003].)
Ascertaining amount of compensation.

The process of ascertaining the amount of compensation to
be awarded for impairment of the capacity to work or to earn
requires:

(1) the determination of the extent to which such capacity
has been diminished;
(2) the determination of the permanency of the decrease in
earning capacity; and

(3) the fixing of the amount of money which will compensate for the determined extent and length of the impairment,
including a reduction of the award to its present worth.

Evidence of substantial personal injuries is sufficient to show
a loss of earning capacity. (22 Am. Jur. 2d. 136.)
Factors to consider.

There is no fixed rule for estimating the amount of damages

610

DAMAGES

Art. 2205

to be recovered for loss or diminution of earning capacity. The
court should award a fair and reasonable compensation, taking
into consideration what the plaintiff’s income would probably
have been, how long it would have lasted, and all the contingencies to which it was liable. The nature and extent of the plaintiff’s
business, profession, or employment, his skill and ability in his
occupation or profession, the loss or diminution of his capacity to
follow it, as a consequence of the injury, and the damages he has
sustained by reason of such loss or diminution, may be shown
and considered.
The plaintiff’s position in life may also be taken into consideration and the possibility of future increase in income, based
upon plaintiff’s character intelligence, ability, and work record.
The extent and seriousness of the plaintiff’s injury may be shown,
and as a basis for comparison, proof as to his condition since
the injury is admissible. (Ibid. 137.)
Earning capacity before, at, and after injury.
The extent of the diminution or impairment of earning capacity in generally arrived at by comparing what the injured
party was capable of earning at or before the time of the injury
with what he was capable of earning after it occurred. That is,
damages per decreased earning capacity should be determined
by deducting plaintiff’s earning ability after the injury from his
earning ability immediately prior to the injury — rather than
by deducting his income after the injury from his income prior
to the injury.

Generally, the plaintiff may put in evidence his actual earnings for a reasonable period before the injury and his actual
earnings, if any, after the injury, but his evidence is not determinative of that capacity.
Evidence that the plaintiff has no education or fitness for a
pursuit different from that in which he was engaged at the time
of his injury is admissible and an injury which incapacitates one
from pursuing his only calling entitles him to more compensation than if he were still qualified to take up some other usually
profitable pursuit notwithstanding the injury. (Ibid. 137, 139.)

Art. 2205

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

611

Health, age, and life expectancy
of injured person.
In determining the amounts to be awarded for decreased
earning capacity, the court should consider the health of the
injured party and his mental and physical ability to maintain
himself and his family before the injury as compared with his
conditions in this respect afterwards. The rule necessarily permits an inquiry into the capacity of the plaintiff prior to the
injury, including his physical condition, and his ability to labor
or follow his usual vocation. Proof may be made of his age, the
state of his health, and his probable life expectancy.

Evidence as to a previous disability, if any, is admissible.
The plaintiff’s ability and disposition to labor, or his business
or professional habits, may also be taken into consideration.
(Ibid. 139-140.)
Plaintiff engaged in business.
One may recover any pecuniary loss sustained by reason
of the suspension of his direction of, and attention to, his business during his absence on account of his injuries and because
of his decreased ability to give it such direction and attention
after he returned to work and in the future.

(1) Amount of loss. — If the business could not be continued
with the same success after his injury as before, a fair compensation may be made for loss of his earning power if it can be
fairly and approximately measured. This compensation should
not exceed the amount usually paid to person performing similar services for others and care must be taken not to make the
responsible party an insurer on prospective profits.

(2) Proof of amount. — In the case of a person engaged in
business, from the very nature of the situation, the amount
of loss cannot be proved with exactitude, and all that can be
required is that the evidence lay a foundation which will enable the trier of fact to make a fair and reasonable estimate. It
is competent and proper to show the nature and extent of the
business and the part the plaintiff transacted therein, the pecuniary loss sustained by reason of the partial or total absence of
his personal attention and labor, and what his services in the

612

DAMAGES

Art. 2205

business is worth, the compensation paid to persons during
such business for him, and, under some circumstances, what
the injured person’s services were worth if employed under like
circumstances by another in a similar capacity. (Ibid. 142-143.)
Plaintiff engaged in the practice of a profession.
(1) Proper measure of damages. — In the case of a professional
person, the proper measure of damages for the loss of time is
the amount he would have earned by the practice of his profession. The fact that he could not legally recover compensation
from the persons to whom such services are rendered will not
prevent a recovery for the loss sustained by reason of his being
deprived of his capacity to perform them.

The amount awarded a professional man for decreased
earning capacity should be based on the fairest estimate the
court can make of what his income would probably have been,
taking into consideration the length of time it would probably
have lasted and all the contingencies to which it was subject.
(2) Recovery for loss of time. — In order to recover for loss
of time, a professional man need just prove the amount he
would have earned in the practice of his profession during the
time in question. The court should consider the probability of
his being employed during the period for which he seeks to
recover. Testimony as to what he has been previously receiving for his services is admissible, and he may show his actual
earnings during the period of the previous year corresponding
to that in which he was injured. If he was not then engaged
in the practice of his profession it is proper to show what he
would have earned immediately thereafter, not as establishing
in itself the value of his time, but as evidence to aid the court
in fixing it. (Ibid. 142-143.)
Plaintiff unemployed.
(1) Damages for loss of earning capacity, not lost earning. —
Damages are awarded an injured plaintiff for the loss of his
capacity to earn money. They are not awarded for his lost earning, although earnings at the time of the injury, in case where

Art. 2205

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

613

the plaintiff was employed, are evidence of the value of that
earning capacity.

Therefore, it is not necessary for the plaintiff to be employed
at the time of the injury for the court to be able to compensate
him both for the value of time lost after the injury and before
the trial and the impairment to his capacity to earn money in
the future. If sufficient evidence has been introduced, substantial
damages may be awarded the unemployed plaintiff for both
of these damage elements (lost time and decreased earning
capacity).
(2) Full compensation for impairment of earning capacity. — The
time belonged to the plaintiff who had a right to work and
earn money. Even though the plaintiff was not employed, he is
entitled to full compensation for the impairment of this right,
assuming, of course, that the impairment was the result of the
fault of the defendant.

On this basis, an injured housewife has been granted a
substantial recovery for the value of the decrease in earning
capacity resulting from defendant’s fault. Likewise a person
who is performing services gratuitously may receive damages
for lost time and impaired earning capacity.
(3) Measurement of earning capacity. — Difficulty arises in
measuring the value of an unemployed plaintiff’s lost time and
capacity to earn money in the future. While the law is clear that
the plaintiff has a right to his own time — which right cannot
be taken from him by a tortfeasor without compensation —
the law is also clear that damages cannot be awarded on the
speculation, passion or guess of the court.

Where damages are not awarded against the tortfeasor for
the impairment of earning ability, it is often not because the
plaintiff’s right was not unlawfully invaded, but because damages were not proved with the requisite degree of certainty.
(Ibid. 147-148.)
Injury to business standing or commercial
credit.
Wrongful injury to the plaintiff’s reputation, credit, and financial or business standing are compensated through several

614

DAMAGES

Art. 2205

different tort actions. Among these actions are libel or slander,
malicious prosecution, and abuse of process.

(1) Need for proof of damages. — Once the court had determined that the elements of one of these actions exist, the plaintiff
may then recover for resulting damage to his reputation, commercial credit, and financial or business standing.
(a) Generally, such damages are considered as “general
damages’’ and both future as well as accrued damages can be
recovered. But damages for injury to these interests
must
be properly pleaded and proved with reasonable certainty.

(b) In many jurisdictions, recovery of substantial damages is allowed for injury to the plaintiff’s reputation, credit,
and standing, without proof of damages. Further, where the
tortious activity of the defendant is accompanied by malice,
exemplary or punitive damages may also be awarded.

(c) A recovery may be had, according to some courts, for
injury to an employee’s prestige or reputation on a breach by
the employer of a contract of employment. But loss of commercial credit is not estimated as damages for breach of contract, unless it immediately connects itself with some tangible
pecuniary loss of which it was the cause. (Ibid. 225-226.)

(2) Award of temperate of damages. — By its very nature, this
kind of damage is difficult to prove in monetary terms. However, Articles 2224 and 2225 provide for the award of temperate damages in cases where it is proven that pecuniary loss
has been suffered by the plaintiff but its amount can not, from
the nature of the case be proved with certainty. The amount of
such damages is left to the discretion of the court taking into
account the circumstances of each case. (Art. 2216.)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:

1. Appellee claims damages from appellant for three (3) separate
breaches of contract.

Facts: On January 22, 1951, the buyer-appellant Woodcraft
Works, Ltd., entered into an agreement with the plaintiff-appellee
to purchase from the latter Philippine round logs. Certain advances
which had been given by the defendant to the plaintiff, in the aggregate amount of P9,000.00, were transferred to and considered

Art. 2205

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

615

as advances on the contract.

It was stipulated that the defendant would purchase from the
plaintiff 1,700.000 board feet of logs of the specifications stated
in the contract — 1,300,000 board feet at P78,000 per thousand
and the rest at P70.000. It was also agreed that the shipment was
to be “before the end of July, but will not commence earlier than
April with the option to make partial shipment depending on the
availability of logs and vessels.’’
Of the quantity of a logs agreed upon, only two shipments
were made, one in March and the other in April, 1951, amounting to 333,832 board feet and 128,825 board feet, respectively, or
a total of 462,657 board feet. On September 13, 1951, the plaintiff
filed an action for rescission of the contract and for recovery of
damages in the sum of P155,000.00 by reason of the defendant’s
failure to comply with its obligations.
Issue: Whether or not appellant Woodcraft Works. Ltd. failed
to comply with its obligations under the contract, or more specifically, whether or not it was obligated to furnish the vessel to
receive the shipment of logs from appellee.

Held: (1) Obligation to furnish vessel devolved upon appellant. —
“The contract does not expressly provide as to which of the parties
should furnish the vessel. But it does contain provisions which
show clearly, albeit only by implication, that the obligation to do
so devolved upon appellant, thus. x x x

The contract was in the form of a letter addressed by appellant
to appellee, and the terms set forth in the portions aforequoted,
particularly with respect to wharfage dues, demurrage and conditions of the weather and of the ship’s machinery, would have been
of little concern to appellant and would not have been imposed
by it if appellee were the one to furnish the vessel.

Besides, the contemporaneous and subsequent acts of the
parties, which under the law may be taken into consideration to
determine their intention (Art. 1371, Civil Code), point unequivocally to the same conclusion. In the two shipments of logs in March
and April of 1961, the vessels ‘SS AEULUS’ and ‘SS DON JOSE’
were furnished by appellant. In several telegraphic communications exchanged between the parties it was invariably appellee
who requested information as to the arrival of the vessels and
appellant who gave the information accordingly.’’
(2) Loss which should be shouldered by appellee. — “Appellee
maintains that due to the failure of appellant to send a vessel
to Dolores, Samar, the storm on May 5, 1951 swept away almost

616

DAMAGES

Art. 2205

all the loss then awaiting shipment, amounting to 410,000 board
feet, valued at P73,537.77. On this point it should be noted that
under the contract shipment was to be made before the end of
July 1951, but not to commence earlier than April of the same year.
The obligation between the parties was a reciprocal one, appellant
to furnish the vessel and appellee to furnish the logs. It was also
an obligation with a term, which obviously was intended for the
benefit of both parties, the period having been agreed upon in
order to avoid the stormy weather in Dolores, Samar, during the
months of January to January to March.
The obligation being reciprocal and with a period, neither
party could demand performance nor incur in delay before the
expiration of the period. Consequently, when the typhoon struck
on May 5, 1951 there was yet no delay on the part of appellant
and the corresponding loss must be shouldered by appellee.’’
(3) Loss for which appellant should be held liable. — “As regards
the second breach, it has been established that after the storm of
May 5, 1951 appellee continued its logging operations. Appellant
was advised of the quantity of logs ready for shipment and was
urged to send a vessel to take delivery. It thereupon gave assurance
that a vessel, the ‘SS ALBAY,’’ with a capacity of 450,000 board
feet, was coming to Dolores, Samar, to load on June 25, 1951. Appellee readied the necessary quantity of logs but the vessel did
not arrive. As a result, 60,000 board feet of logs which had been
rafted broke loose and were lost. Appellee’s loss on this account
amounted to a total of P7,685.26, representing the value of the
logs lost, and cost of rafting and other incidental expenses.
It may be observed in this respect that although the obligation would not become due until July 31, 1951 appellant waived
the benefit of the period by assuring appellee that it would take
delivery of the logs on June 25, 1951. On that date appellee was
ready to comply, but appellant failed on his commitment, without
any satisfactory explanation for such failure. Therefore, appellant
should bear the corresponding loss.

Third and finally, as heretofore pointed out, by the end of July
1951 appellee had sufficient logs ready for shipment in accordance
with the contract. But appellant, in spite of the representations
made by the former, failed to send a vessel on the aforesaid date.
There is no evidence that such failure was due to circumstances
beyond appellant’s control. As a result logs totaling 800,000 board
feet were destroyed by marine borers, causing a loss of P62,000.00,
for which appellant should be held liable.’’

Art. 2205

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

617

(4) Evidence to prove loss of credit. — “The trial court sentenced
appellant to pay P50,000.00 representing appellee’s loss of credit
in the operation of his business. The decision does not say upon
what evidence the award is based. Nor is there any attempt in
appellee’s brief to justify the amount awarded. Actual or compensatory damages must be established by clear evidence.

In this case, other than a few letters of demand for payment
of money accounts received by appellee from its creditors and
presented as exhibits, there is nothing to go upon, and the mere
fact that such demands were made does not necessarily prove
loss of credit. This item must therefore be elimitead.’’ (Abesamis
vs. Woodcraft Works, Ltd., 30 SCRA 372 [1969].)

2. Buyers (spouses) of land previously sold by vendor claim compensatory damages for their failure to construct their house on said land,
which if constructed at present prices, would cost them 300% more than
the original amount.
Facts: Private respondents (spouses) filed a complaint against
petitioner (spouses) and another defendant for breach of contract
and payment of damages.

The complaint alleges that the parcels of land sold by the
petitioners to the respondents had been previously sold before,
and that because of the double sale, the respondents demanded
from the petitioners the return of their downpayment but the latter
refused and that as a consequence of the deceit and misrepresentation employed by them, the respondents were also prevented
from constructing their house worth P100,000 on the lots which,
if constructed, at the present would cost them 300% more than
the original amount.
The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the respondents
(plaintiffs) ordering the petitioners (defendants) “to pay jointly and
severally, the plaintiff’s P3,040.00 [downpayment], with interest at
the legal rate from June 2, 1971, until the same shall have been
fully paid; P100,000.00 as compensation for the pecuniary loss
plaintiffs suffered for failure to construct their residential house;
P5,600.00 as reimbursement for the rentals plaintiffs paid from
January 1972 to September 6, 1974; P50,000 as moral damages;
P25,000 as exemplary damages; P5,000.00 as attorney’s fees; and
the costs.’’
Issue: Did the trial court err in ordering the petitioners to pay
the private respondents P100,000.00 for compensatory damages?

618

DAMAGES

Art. 2205

Held: Yes. (1) Award of P100,000 compensatory damages patently
erroneous. — “Resolving the merits of the case, we find that the
orders of the trial court ordering the petitioners to pay the private
respondents P100,000.00 for compensatory damages is patently
erroneous because no proof whatsoever was presented or could
be presented by the private respondents to show that they had
actually suffered pecuniary loss in that amount. In fact, the whole
amount of P100,000.00 had no basis at all except the respondents’ mere allegation that they, absent the malice, bad faith, and
unlawful and deceitful acts of the petitioners, ‘could have been
constructed a residential house worth P100,000.00; that the same
residential house cannot now be constructed at that amount, but
very likely at more than three hundred percent more; such difference constitutes an actual damage on the part of the plaintiffs
(respondents) which are directly logically and naturally caused
by the aforesaid acts of defendants (petitioners) for which said
defendants are liable.’’’
(2) Alleged compensatory damages suffered purely speculative. —
“In the case of Sy v. Court of Appeals (131 SCRA 127), we ruled that
an alleged loss of income is not recoverable for being speculative
as no receipt or any kind of evidence on the matter was presented
to prove it. Likewise, in the case of Seavan Carrier, Inc. vs. GTI
Sportswear Corp. (132 SCRA 314-315), quoting G.A. Machineries, Inc.
vs. Yaptinchay (126 SCRA 87), we ruled that for damages under
Article 2200 of the Civil Code to be recovered, the best evidence
obtainable by the injured party must be presented; and thus, the
bare assertion of the respondent that he lost about P54,000.00 and
the accompanying documentary evidence presented to prove the
amount lost are inadequate if not speculative.
In the present case, the respondents were not able to prove
any actual losses suffered as a result of the petitioners’ wrongful
acts because they have not even started the construction of their
house on the disputed lots. Any alleged pecuniary loss which they
claim to have suffered because of the delay in the commencement
of construction is purely speculative and cannot be the basis of
compensatory damages as provided by law.’’

(3) Award of moral and exemplary damages for too excessive. — “As
regards the awards of P50,000.00 moral damages and P25,000.00
exemplary damages, we hold that such awards are far too excessive compared to the actual losses sustained by the respondents.
They are without bases considering that the spouses had only
paid a down-payment in the amount of P3,040.00 and had not

Art. 2205

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

619

yet occupied the property nor introduced improvements thereon
at the time they discovered the fraud perpetrated against them
by the petitioners.
In the case of San Andres v. Court of Appeals (116 SCRA 81),
we ruled:

‘While, indeed, the amount of moral damages is a matter left largely to the sound discretion of a Court, (Art. 2216,
Civil Code) we find that the sums of P30,000.00 and P5,000.00
awarded herein as moral damages and attorney’s fees, respectively, by the Court of Appeals, are excessive and should be
reduced to more reasonable amounts, considering the attendant
facts and circumstances. Moral damages, though incapable
of pecuniary estimation, are in the category of an award designed to compensate the claimant for actual injury suffered
and not to impose a penalty on the wrongdoer.’ (Malonzo v.
Galang, 109 Phil. 16, 20-21, cited in Enervida v. de la Torre,
55 SCRA 339).’’

(4) Items of damages recoverable. — “The records will show that
the injury suffered by the respondents was not serious or gross
and, therefore, out of proportion to the amount of damages generously awarded by the trial court, and subsequently affirmed by
the appellate court. We note that a total of P188,650.00 in damages
was awarded in a case involving a downpayment of P3,040.00 on
a full purchase price of P15,200.00 payable in installments.

We thus, hold that the petitioners are liable for the amount of
P3,040.00, representing the downpayment made by the private respondents on the lots in dispute, with legal interest from March 25,
1974; and for the amounts of P10,000.00 moral damages, P5,000.00
exemplary damages, and another P5,000.00 as attorney’s fees, respectively. Petitioners, however, are not liable for compensatory
damages.’’ (Siguenza vs. Court of Appeals, 137 SCRA 570 [1985].)

3. Owner of property sold by his authorized agent claims damages based upon gains or profits he might have received from cer- tain
business transactions had he received the proceeds of the sale which the
agent instead legally accredited to the account it held against said owner.

Facts: J. Delgado had his life insured in the plaintiff company
for the sum of $2,500, and received a policy representing said
contract of insurance. Later said policy was assigned to RH & Co.
by J. Delgado to guarantee the payment of a balance of a running

620

DAMAGES

Art. 2205

account which then existed between said company and J. Delgado.
The policy matured. The amount due thereon was payable. RH &
Co. and J. Delgado each claimed the amount due.
The present action was commenced by the plaintiff and the
sum of P4,234.75 was deposited in court. The plaintiff prayed that
the defendants be required to interplead and litigate their several
claims in or to the said sum of money among themselves.

Delgado claims that he had been damaged in the sum of
several thousand pesos by reason of the fact that RH & Co. failed
and refused to deliver to him the sum of P3,000 which it received
as a result of the sale of the property RH & Co. was authorized
by J. Delgado to sell for the sum of P3,000. The property was
sold. The money was received by RH & Co. and said amount
was duly accredited to the account which it held against him in
the sum of P4,500.
Delgardo asserts that RH & Co. held his life insurance policy
as a guaranty for the payment of the balance of said account and,
therefore, had no right to retain nor to accredit said sum. However
when said sum was received, said policy had not yet become the
property of RH & Co. for said purpose. There was at that time
some questions pending relating to the existence of said policy at
all, for the reason that Delgado had failed to pay the premiums
promptly in accordance with the terms of his contract. At the time
said sum was received, therefore, the policy did not constitute a
guaranty for the payment of any balance of said account. Under
the facts, RH & Co. had a right to and was fully justified in accrediting said sum on the account of Delgado.
Issue: Is Delgado entitled to damages?

Held: (1) Only legal interest recoverable. — “Considering the
conclusion which we have reached, that RH & Co. had a right
to accredit the amount received (P3,000) on the current account,
then, of course, J. Delgado is not entitled to any damages for
their failure to deliver to him said sum. But even though it he
admitted that RH & Co. should have paid to J. Delgado the said
sum and failed so to do, that then and in that case, in the absence
of fraud, etc. the only recoverable damages would be the legal
interest upon said amount. (Art. 1108 [now 2209], Civil Code)’’

(2) Claim for damages speculative. — “The damages which J.
Delgado is now claiming are based upon losses which he incurred
in certain business transactions which might have resulted in
gains or profits had he received the said P3,000. Even granting

Art. 2205

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

621

that contention, his claim is entirely too remote, speculative and
inconsequential to justify a judgment in his favor. Speculative
profits are too remote to be included in an accurate estimate of
damages.’’ (Sun Life Insurance Co. of Canada vs. Rueda Hermanos &
Co., 37 Phil. 844 [1918].)

Art. 2206. The amount of damages for death
caused by a crime or quasi-delict shall be at least
Three thousand pesos, even though there may have
been mitigating circumstances. In addition:
(1) The defendant shall be liable for the loss of the
earning capacity of the deceased, and the indemnity
shall be paid to the heirs of the latter; such indemnity
shall in every case be assessed and awarded by the
court, unless the deceased on account of permanent
physical disability not caused by the defendant, had
no earning capacity at the time of his death;
(2) If the deceased was obliged to give support
according to the provisions of Article 291, the recipient who is not an heir called to the decedent’s
inheritance by the law of testate or intestate succession, may demand support from the person causing
the death, for a period not exceeding five years, the
exact duration to be fixed by the court;
(3) The spouse, legitimate and illegitimate descendants and ascendants of the deceased may
demand moral damages for mental anguish by reason
of the death of the deceased.
Damages for wrongful death.
(1) Amount of indemnity death. — The Code Commission
explains the provisions of Article 2206 as follows:
“Human life has heretofore been very cheap, in law
and the practice thereunder. Before the passage of Commonwealth Act No. 284, in June, 1988, the practice was to
allow P1,000 to the heirs of the deceased in case of death
caused by a crime. Later, by virtue of that special law, a
minimum of P2,000 was fixed, but the court usually award

622

DAMAGES

Art. 2205

only the minimum, without taking the trouble to inquire
into the earning capacity of the victim, and regardless of
aggravating circumstances. x x x
When the first paragraph says ‘at least Three Thousand
Pesos, even though there may have been mitigating circumstances’ it is meant that the court must not stop after
awarding P3,000 because the life of a captain of industry,
scientist, inventor, a great writer, or statesman is materially
more valuable to the family and to the community than that
of an ordinary man. Moreover, aggravating circumstances
should cause exemplary damages to be awarded. The court
must, therefore, in certain cases, allow much more than
P3,000.00. In addition: indemnity for the loss of earning
capacity must in every case be assessed and awarded except
in the case mentioned in No. 1.

The last two paragraphs afford adequate remedy to those
relatives who suffer by reason of the death of their kin.’’
(Report, pp. 34-35.)

The amount of damages for death caused by a crime or
quasi-delict shall be “at least’’ P3,000. In view of the declining value of the currency and the great increase in prices, the
Supreme Court has been increasing the award of damages, the
latest minimum civil liability being P50,000, independently of
the financial capacity of the defendant. Of course, the amount
may be increased by the courts depending on the defendant’s
financial means. The death indemnity is separate and distinct
from other forms of indemnity for damages and is automatically
awarded without need of further proof other than the fact that
a crime was committed resulting in the death of the victim and
that the acused was responsible therefor. (People vs. Foncardas,
422 SCRA 356 [2004]; People vs. Malinao, 423 SCRA 34 [2004];
People vs. Catbagan, 423 SCRA 535 [2004].)
In a case, the appellant who was convicted of parricide for
causing the death of his father was ordered to indemnify the
heirs of the decedent (mother, brothers, and sister of appellant),
for they have also suffered, even if as alleged, they, “would,
perhaps feeling the natural impulse, hope to exculpate appellant.’’ (People vs. Manos, 36 SCRA 457 [1970].)

Art. 2206

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

623

There can be no exact or uniform rule for measuring the
value of human life and the measure of damages cannot be
arrived at by precise mathematical calculation but the amount
recoverable depends on the particular facts and circumstances
of each case. (22 C.J.S. 1241; People vs. Medrozo, 62 SCRA 245
[1975]; Alcantara vs. Surro, 93 Phil. 472 [1953].)
(2) Other damages recoverable. — The indemnity for the death
of the victim is an addition to other items for damages that may
be recovered under Article 2206, namely, loss of earning capacity, expenses for support, and moral damages. Other damages
may also be awarded including actual and exemplary damages,
attorney’s fees, litigation expenses, and interest in proper cases.
Under Article 2219(1, 2), the injured party who merely suffers physical injuries may recover moral damages if they are
caused by a criminal offense or a quasi-delict. (see Art. 2220.)
Compensation for loss of earning capacity.
In Metro Manila Transit Corporation vs. Court of Appeals (298
SCRA 495 [1998].), the Supreme Court made the following ruling:
(1) Nature of compensation. — “Article 2206 of the Civil Code
provides that in addition to the indemnity for death caused by a
crime or quasi-delict, the “defendant shall be liable for the loss
of the earning capacity of the deceased, and the indemnity shall
be paid to the heirs of the latter.’’ Compensation of this nature
is awarded not for loss of earnings but for loss of capacity to
earn money.

(2) Victim unemployed. — “Evidence must be presented that
the victim, if not yet employed at the time of death, was reasonably certain to complete training for a specific profession. (e.g.,
Cariaga v. Laguna Tayabas Bus Company, 110 Phil. 346 [1960].)
In People v. Teehankee (249 SCRA 54, 118-119 [1995].), no award
of compensation for loss of earning capacity was granted to
the heirs of a college freshman because there was no sufficient
evidence on record to show that the victim would eventually
become a professional pilot.
(3) Loss of earning capacity of a minor. — “But compensation
should be allowed for loss of earning capacity resulting from

624

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

the death of a minor who has not yet commenced employment
or training for a specific profession if sufficient evidence is
presented to establish the amount thereof.
In the United States it has been observed:

‘This raises the broader question of the proper measure
of damages in death cases involving children, housewives,
the old, and others who do not have market income so
that there is no pecuniary loss to survivors or to the estate
of the decedent. The traditional approach was to award no
or merely nominal damages in such cases . . . Increasingly,
however, courts allow expert testimony to be used to project
those lost earnings. (Richard A. Posner, Tort Law: Cases and
Economic Analysis, 123-25 [1982].)

Thus, in Haumersen v. Ford Motor Co. (257 N.W. 2d 7, 17
[1977].), the court allowed the heirs of a seven-year-old boy
who was killed in a car accident to recover compensation for
loss of earning capacity:
‘Considerable evidence was presented by plaintiffs in
an effort to give the jury a foundation on which to mak an
award. Briefly stated, this evidence showed Charles Haumersen was a seven-year-old of above average characteristics.
He was described as ‘very intelligent’ and ‘all-American.’
He received high marks in school. He was active in church
affairs and participated in recreational and athletic events,
often with children older than himself. In addition, he had
an unusual talent for creating numerous cartoons and other
drawings, some of which plaintiffs introduced at trial.
The record does not disclose passion and prejudice. The
key question is whether the verdict of $100,000 has support
in the evidence.
Upon analysis of the record, we conclude that we should
not disturb the award.’

The argument for allowing compensation for loss of earning
capacity of a minor is even stronger if he or she was a student,
whether already training for a specific profession or still engaged
in general studies. In Krohmer v. Dahl (402 P. 2d 979, 982 [1965].),

Art. 2206

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

625

the court, in affirming the award by the jury of $85,000.00 to
the heirs of an eighteen-year-old college freshman who died of
carbon monoxide poisoning, stated as follows:
‘There are numerous cases that have held admissible
evidence of prospective earnings of a student or trainee . . . .
The appellants contend that such evidence is not admissible
unless the course under study relates to a given occupation
or profession and it is shown that the student is reasonably
certain to follow that occupation or profession. It is true that
the majority of these decisions deal with students who are
studying for a specific occupation or profession. However, not
one of these cases indicate that evidence of one’s education
as a guide to future earnings is not admissible where the
student is engaged in general studies or whose education
does not relate to a specific occupation.’
In sharp contrast with the situation obtaining in People v.
Teehankee, where the prosecution merely presented evidence to
show the fact of the victim’s graduation from high school and
the fact of his enrollment in a flying school, the spouses Rosales did not content themselves with simply establishing Liza
Rosalie’s enrollment at UP Integrated School. They presented
evidence to show that Liza Rosalie was a good student, promising artist, and obedient child. She consistently performed well
in her studies since grade school. A survey taken in 1984 when
Liza Rosalie was twelve years old showed that she had good
study habits and attitudes. Cleofe Chi, guidance counselor of
the University of the Philippines Integrated School, described
Liza Rosalie as personable, well-liked, and with a balanced
personality. Professor Alfredo Rebillon, a faculty member of
the University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts, who
organized workshops which Liza Rosalie attended in 1982 and
1983, testified that Liza Rosalie had the potential of eventually becoming an artist. Professor Rebillon’s testimony is more
than sufficiently established by the 51 samples of Liza Rosalie’s
watercolor, charcoal, and pencil drawings submitted as exhibits
by the spouses Rosales. Neither MMTC nor Pedro Musa controverted this evidence.
Considering her good academic record, extra-curricular

626

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

activities, and varied interests, it is reasonable to assume that
Liza Rosalie would have enjoyed a successful professional career
had it not been for her untimely death. Hence, it is proper that
compensation for loss of earning capacity should be awarded to
her heirs in accordance with the formula established in decided
cases for computing net earning capacity, to wit:

Life expectancy is equivalent to two thirds (2/3) multiplied
by the difference of eighty (80) and the age of the deceased.’’
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. The mother of a male child killed through the negligence of the
defendant in driving his automobile, was not able to prove her pecuniary
loss.

Facts: A male child, 8 or 9 years of age, was killed through
the negligence of the defendant in driving his automobile. The
mother of the dead boy is a widow, a poor washerwoman. She
brings action against the defendant to recover damages for her loss
in the amount of P5,000. Without there having been tendered any
special proof of the amount of damages suffered, the trial court
found the defendant responsible and condemned him to pay to
plaintiff the sum of P1,000.

Held: (1) Action for damages for wrongful death; Background. —
“At Common Law, no civil action lies for damages caused by
the death of a human being by the wrongful or negligent act of
another. The maxim is actio personalis moritur cum persona. Two
different modes of reasoning have arrived at this result. The first
and older theory was the merger of the private right in the public
wrong. The second and younger theory was that the death of a
human being cannot be complained of as a civil injury. Under
the latter doctrine, it has been repeatedly held that a civil action
by a parent for the death of a minor child cannot be maintained.

By the Civil Law, particularly as existing in Spain, France, Porto
Rico, and Louisiana, the true principle is somewhat beclouded.
Thus, in Louisiana, a State favored by French and Spanish an-

Art. 2206

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

627

tecedents, the exact question of whether an action for damages
caused by the homicide of a human being can be maintained,
was presented by able counsel for the opinion of distinguished
jurists. And it was held in a decision, later expressly affirmed,
that, under the Civil Law, the action could not be maintained by
the surviving wife or children.
The same question has arisen in Porto Rico. It has there been
held that by the Civil Law in force in Porto Rico a civil action
lies for negligence resulting in death.

In Spain, from which both the civil law of Porto Rico and the
Philippines were derived, it has been decided that such an action
could be maintained. (Decision of the Supreme Court of Spain of
December 14, 1894.) In France, the highest court has interpreted
the Code Napoleon as sanctioning actions by those damaged by
the death of another against persons by whose fault the death
happened.
That even in those jurisdictions in which the Common Law
has force, the observance of the principle has been resisted, is
disclosed by the action of Hawaii in holding that there can be a
recovery for death by wrongful act. That the impropriety of the
judge-made rule was early disclosed, is shown by the numerous
statutes, beginning with Lord Campbell’s Act, which were enacted
to cover the deficiency by permitting of a right of action to recover
damages for death caused by wrongful act. Even in Louisiana, a
State partially governed by the Civil Law, because of a statute,
an action will now lie for pecuniary and other damages caused
by death. And finally, that eminent authorities recognize liability
in case of death by negligence is disclosed by the mere mention
of such names as Grotius, Puffendorif, and Domat. For instance,
Grotius in his Rights of War and Peace said: x x x’’

(2) Action can be maintained in our jurisdiction. — “Both because
of the civil origin of the applicable law in the Philippines, because
we are not fettered by the harsh common law rule on the subject,
because it is the modern and more equitable principle, and because
reason and natural justice are eloquent advocates, we hold that
an action for damages can be maintained in this jurisdiction for
the death of a person by wrongful act. It can be admitted, since
objection has not been made, that the primary right of action is
in the parent.’’
(3) Concept of damage. — “The second phase of our enquiry,
pertaining to the amount of compensation for the loss of a human

628

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

life, must now be settled.

‘Damage’ has been defined by Escriche as ‘the detriment,
injury, or loss which are occasioned by reason of fault of another
in the property or person.’ Of whatsoever nature the damage be,
and from whatsoever cause it may proceed, the person who has
done the injury ought to repair it by an indemnity proportionate
to his fault and to the loss caused thereby. Damnum (daño or a
loss) must be shown to sustain an action for damages.’’
(4) Presumption of pecuniary loss. — “Those seeking to recoup
damages must ordinarily establish their pecuniary loss by satisfactory proof. The customary elements of damages must be shown.
But in certain cases, the law presumes a loss because of the impossibility of exact proof and computation in respect to the amount of
the loss sustained. In other words, the loss can be proved either
by evidence or by presumption. For instance, where the relation
of husband and wife or parent and child exist, provided the child
is shown to be a minor, the law presumes a pecuniary loss to the
survivor from the fact of death, and it is not necessary to submit
proof as to such loss.

Expenses
‘Only pecuniary damages can be recovered in such actions
as this. Nothing can be given as solace or for bereavement
suffered. Under instructions declaring the true rule for estimating the damages, the jury found for plaintiff, in the sum of
$800, but one of the errors assigned is, the amount found is
excessive. As a matter of law, we cannot so declare, and as a
matter of fact, how can we know the amount is in excess of
the pecuniary damages sustained? When proof is made of the
age and relationship of the deceased to next of kin, the jury
may estimate the pecuniary damages from the facts proven,
in connection with their own knowledge and experiences in
relation to matters of common observation.
It is not indispensable there should be proof of actual services of pecuniary value rendered to next of kin, nor that any
witness should express an opinion as to the value of services
that may have been or might be rendered. Where the deceased
was a minor, and left a father who would have been entitled
to his services had he lived, the law implies a pecuniary loss,

Art. 2206

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

629

for which compensation, under the statute, may be given.’ ’’

(5) Discretion of court in fixing amount of damages. — “The
discretion of a jury, where there is a jury, or of the trial court,
where the court possesses such faculty, in fixing the amount of
damages, will not be interfered with by the appellate court unless
this discretion has been palpably abused. Since in the very nature
of things, the value of a human life cannot be exactly estimated
in money, and since the elements which go to make up any value
are personal to each case, much must depend on the good sense
and sound judgment of the jury or judge.

The rule has been applied to the death of minor children
where there was nothing to show passion, prejudice, or ignorance
on the part of the jury.’’
(6) The negligent should make reparation for the loss. — “The right
of action for death and the presumption in favor of compensation
being admitted, the difficulty of estimating in money the worth
of a life should not keep a court from judicially compensating the
injured party as nearly as may be possible for the wrong.
True, man is incapable of measuring exactly in the delicate
scales of justice the value of a human life. True, the feelings of a
mother on seeing her little son torn and mangled — expiring —
dead — could never be assuaged with money. True, all the treasure
in nature’s vaults could not begin to compensate a parent for the
loss of a beloved child. Nevertheless, within the bounds of human powers, the negligent should make reparation for the loss.’’

(7) Statutory limits should only be taken a guides. — “Attempts
at approximation in money for death have been made. Many
American statutes have arbitrarily limited the amounts that could
be recovered to five thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars. The
federal Courts have intimated that these statutory limits should
only be taken as a guide to the permissible amount of damages.
xxx
The foregoing is believed to be a fair statement of the pertinent
general principles. Before closing, notice should be taken of the
leading decisions of the supreme court of Spain and the supreme
court of Porto Rico. x x x’’

(8) Instant case differentiated from cited cases. — “Civil law
authorities are, like the common law cases, against recovery
without proof of loss. If necessary, however, the three decisions
just described, could be differentiated from the present facts. The

630

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

decision of the supreme court of Spain, it is to be remembered,
involved an action for the death of a man of mature years. The
first decision of the supreme court of Porto Rico recognizes the
principle of presumptive recovery. The second decision of the
supreme court of Porto Rico concerned an action for the death of
a son of sufficient age to have an earning capacity. None of these
is our case. Here present is the case of a young child whose death
is caused by wrongful act, leaving a poor mother to be the loser.
To answer in a different way, let us make a comparison. The
facts before us, and the facts before the Supreme Court of Illinois
in analogous cases, are substantially identical. We have proof of
the age of the deceased, proof of the name of the next of kin, and
proof that the mother is a laboring woman. Under both the Common Law and the Civil Law, plaintiff’s damage, broadly speaking,
is for the loss of the services of the deceased, or for support by
the deceased. Plaintiff having shown that the deceased was her
son and that he was 8 or 9 years of age at the time of death, it
was neither necessary nor possible to prove loss of services or
support, or to prove special damage as if the object of the loss
had been a horse or other animal. No doubt the damage could
be greatly enhanced by showing the personal characteristics of
the deceased. Outside of this, however, the pecuniary loss may
be estimated from the facts at hand with reference to the general
knowledge which all possess.’’
(9) Amount of damage inferable without need of proof. — “To
force the plaintiff to prove her loss exactly would be to ask the
impossible — would be in effect to return to the old common law
rule which prohibits a recovery Physical and gross criteria, as the
hewing of wood and carrying of water, are indeed no standards
at all. Even if the case was to be reopened, the plaintiff could
with extreme difficulty present any better evidence than that now
before us. As we have the basis of satisfactory facts from which
to infer the amount of damage, as the law presumes a pecuniary
loss because of the death, and as the trial judge has made an intelligent computation, we should rest here, with knowledge that,
within the ken of human wisdom, justice has been done.
On a careful consideration of the entire field of the law on the
subject of damages, we come to the conclusion that the amount,
in the nature of an indemnity allowed by the trial court, is neither excessive nor immoderately inadequate, and should stand.’’

2. The sisters and only surviving heirs of the deceased, a paying
passenger who died in an accident involving a bus owned by petitioner,
brought action against petitioner to recover damages for breach of contract
of carriage.

Facts: The private respondents, all surnamed Quintos, are
the sisters and only surviving heirs of Policronio Quintos, Jr.,
who died single, leaving no descendants nor ascendants. Said
respondents herein brought this action against herein petitioner,
Villa Rey Transit, Inc., as owner and operator of said passenger
bus, for breach of the contract of carriage between said petitioner
and the deceased Policronio Quintos, Jr., to recover the aggregate
sum of P63,750.00 as damages, including attorney’s fees.
Said petitioner (defendant in the Court of First Instance) contended that the mishap was due to a fortuitous event, but this
pretense was rejected by the trial court and the Court of Appeals,
both of which found that the accident and the death of Policronio
had been due to the negligence of the bus driver, for whom petitioner was liable under its contract of carriage with the deceased.
Issue: The only issue is the amount of damages recoverable
by the private respondents.
Held: (1) Factors to be considered in determination of amount of
damages. — “The determination of such amount depends, mainly
upon two (2) factors, namely: (1) the number of years on the basis of which the damages shall be computed; and (2) the rate at
which the losses sustained by said respondents should be fixed.’’

(2) Life expectancy. — “The first factor was based by the trial
court — the view of which was concurred in by the Court of Appeals — upon the life expectancy of Policronio Quintos, Jr., which
was placed at 33-1/3 years — he being over 29 years of age (or
around 30 years for purposes of computation) at the time of his
demise — by applying the formula (2/3 x [80-30] = life expectancy) adopted in the American Expectancy Table of Mortality or
the actuarial of Combined Experience Table of Mortality. Upon the
other hand, petitioner maintains that the lower courts had erred
in adopting said formula and in not acting in accordance with
Alcantara v. Surro (93 Phil. 472 [1953].) in which the damages were
computed on a four (4) year basis, despite the fact that the victim
therein was 39 years old, at the time of his death, and had a life
expectancy of 28.90 years.

632

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

The case cited is not, however, controlling in the one at bar.
In the Alcantara case, none of the parties had questioned the propriety of the four-year basis adopted by the trial court in making
its award of damages. Both parties appealed, but only as regards
the amount thereof. The plaintiffs assailed the non-inclusion, in its
computation, of the bonus that the corporation, which was the
victim’s employer, had awarded to deserving officers and employees, based upon the profits earned less than two (2) months
before the accident that resulted in his death. The defendants, in
turn, objected to the sum awarded for the fourth year, which was
treble that of the previous years, based upon the increases given,
in that fourth year, to other employees of the same corporation.
Neither this objection nor said claim for inclusion of the bonus was
sustained by this Court. Accordingly, the same had not thereby
laid down any rule on the length of time to be used in the computation of damages. On the contrary, it declared:
‘The determination of the indemnity to be awarded to the
heirs of a deceased person has therefore no fixed basis. Much is
left to the discretion of the court considering the moral and material
damages involved,’ and so it has been said that ‘there can be no
exact or uniform rule for measuring the value of a human life and
the measure of damages cannot be arrived at by precise mathematical
calculation, but the amount recoverable depends on the particular
facts and circumstances of each case.’’’
(3) Other factors. — The life expectancy of the deceased or
of the beneficiary, whichever is shorter, is an important factor.
(25 C.J.S. 124.) Other factors that are usually considered are: (1)
pecuniary loss to plaintiff or beneficiary (25 C.J.S. 1243-1250); (2)
loss of support (25 C.J.S., 1250-1251); (3) loss of service (25 C.J.S.
1251-1254); (4) loss of society (25 C.J.S. 1254-1255); (5) mental suffering of beneficiaries (25 C.J.S. 1258-1259); and (6) medical and
funeral expenses (25 C.J.S. 1254-1260).
Thus, life expectancy is, not only relevant, but, also an important
element in fixing the amount recoverable by private respondents
herein. Although it is not the sole element determinative of said
amount, no cogent reason has been given to warrant its disregard
and the adoption, in the case at bar, of a purely arbitrary standard, such as four-year rule. In short, the Court of Appeals has not
erred in basing the computation of petitioner’s liability upon the
life expectancy of Policronio Quintos, Jr.’’
(4) Rate at which damage shall be computed. — “With respect

633

to the rate at which the damages shall be computed, petitioner
impugns the decision appealed from upon the ground that the
damages awarded therein will have to be paid now, whereas most
of those sought to be indemnified will be suffered years later.
This argument is basically true, and this is, perhaps, one of
the reasons why the Alcantara case points out the absence of a
‘fixed basis’ for the ascertainment of the damages recoverable in
litigations like the one at bar. Just the same, the force of the said
argument of petitioner herein is offset by the fact that, although
payment of the award in the case at bar will have to take place
upon the finality of the decision therein, the liability of petitioner
herein had been fixed at the rate only of P2,184.00 a year, which
is the annual salary of Policronio Quintos, Jr. at the time of his
death, as a young “training assistant’’ in the Bacnotan Cement
Industries, Inc.

In other words, unlike the Alcantara case, on which petitioner
relies, the lower courts did not consider, in the present case,
Policronio’s potentiality and capacity to increase his future income.
Indeed, upon the conclusion of his training period, he was supposed to have a better job and be promoted from time to time, and,
hence, to earn more, if not — considering the growing importance
of trade, commerce and industry and the concomitant rise in the
income level of officers and employees therein — much more.’’
(5) Fixing amount of support. — “At this juncture, it should be
noted, also, that we are mainly concerned with the determination
of the losses or damages sustained by the private respondents,
as dependents and intestate heirs of the deceased, and that said
damages consists, not of the full amount of his earnings, but of
the support they received or would have received from him had
he not died in consequence of the negligence of petitioner’s agent.
In fixing the amount of that support, We must reckon with the
‘necessary expenses of his own living,’ which should be deducted
from his earnings. Thus, it has been consistently held that earning
capacity, as an element of damages to one’s estate for his death
by wrongful act, is necessarily his net earning capacity or his
capacity to acquire money, ‘less the necessary expenses for his own
living.’ Stated otherwise, the amount recoverable is not loss of the
entire earnings, but rather the loss of that portion of the earnings
which the beneficiary would have received.
In other words, only net earnings, not gross earning, are to
be considered that is, the total of the earnings less expenses nec-

634

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

essary in the creation of such earnings or income and less living
and other incidental expenses.’’
(6) Items of damages recoverable. — “All things considered, We
are of the opinion that it is fair and reasonable to fix the deductible
living and other expenses of the deceased at the sum of P1,184.00
a year, or about P100.00 a month, and that, consequently, the loss
sustained by his sisters may be roughly estimated at P1,000.00 a
year or P33,333.33 for the 33 1/3 years of his life expectancy.

To this sum of P33,333.33, the following should be added:
(a) P12,000.0, pursuant to Arts. 104 and 107 of the Revised Penal
Code, in relation to Article 2206 of our Civil Code, as construed
and applied by this Court; (b) P1,727.95, actually spent by private
respondents for medical and burial expenses; and (c) attorney’s
fees, which was fixed by the trial court, at P500.00, but which, in
view of the appeal taken by petitioner herein, first to the Court
of Appeals and later to this Supreme Court, should be increased
to P2,500.00.
In other words, the amount adjudged in the decision appealed
from should be reduced to the aggregate sum of P49,561.28, with
interest thereon, at the legal rate, from December 29, 1961, date
of the promulgation of the decision of the trial court.’’ (Villa Rey
Transit, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 31 SCRA 511 [1970].)

3. The Court of Appeals eliminated the award of compensatory
and moral damages simply because it had credited the respondent with
two (2) mitigating circumstances.

Facts: Respondent Apolonio Bustos was charged in the Court
of First Instance of Pampanga on October 26, 1962 with the crime
of murder for the killing of Raymundo Castro, whose heirs are
now the petitioners. The trial court found Bustos guilty only of
homicide and, crediting him with two mitigating circumstances
namely, passion or obfuscation and voluntary surrender.
In its amended decision, the Court of Appeals, eliminated
the award of compensatory and moral damages “in view of the
presence of two mitigating circumstances, without any aggravating one to offset them.’’
Issue: Whether the original decision of the Court of Appeals
should be affirmed in toto insofar as the award of indemnity and
damages is concerned.

Art. 2206

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

635

Held: (1) Items of damages the same generally in both criminal and
civil proceedings. — “This case affords this Court as appropriate
an opportunity as any other, to restate, in a more comprehensive
way, the law regarding the items of damages that are recoverable
in cases of death caused by a crime, whether the claim therefor is
made in the criminal proceedings itself or in a separate civil action.
In the instant case, recovery of such damages is being sought in
the criminal proceedings, but even if it were claimed otherwise,
the indemnity and damages would be the same, for generally, the
items of damages are identical in both procedures, except with
respect to attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation which can
be awarded only when a separate civil action is instituted. (Art.
2208, Civil Code.)

With the clarifications we are making herein, at least the writer
of this opinion expects that litigations regarding the aspects of the
law herein passed upon may be minimized.’’
(2) No legal or factual basis stated for indemnity and damages
awarded. — “The decision of the Court of Appeals, while correct in
making a particularization in the award of indemnity and damages,
nonetheless, still failed to comply strictly with the constitutional
requirement that all decisions of courts of record must state both
the facts and the law on which they are based. (Sec. 12, Art. VIII,
Constitution.)
In said original decision, the Court of Appeals held:

‘Coming now to the damages asked by the heirs of the deceased: Aside from the P6,000.00 indemnity awarded by the trial
court which we uphold, we feel justified, in the exercise of our
discretion, to award to the heirs of the deceased moral damages
in the amount of P6,000 plus P13,380.00 to compensate for the
loss of earning of the decedent at the annual salary of P2,676.00.
‘WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment is modified as
above indicated in so far as it concerns the amount of indemnity
and damages to be awarded to the heirs of the deceased, and
the mitigating circumstance of vindication of a grave offense
which takes the place of the circumstance of obfuscation appreciated by the trial court; and affirmed in all other respects.
Costs against the appellant.’

As can be seen, no legal or factual basis is stated therein for
the award of indemnity and damages to petitioners; worse, the
impression is given that the said award is purely a matter of discretion on the part of the court. Clearly, this is not in accordance
with the law. Indeed, it must have been this failure to refer to

636

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

the pertinent legal provisions which induced the appellate court,
at the mere invocation by respondent of Art. 2204 of the Civil
Code, to commit the error of readily eliminating in the amended
decision the items on moral damages and compensation for loss
of earning of the decedent which its original decision had correctly contained.’’
(3) Indemnity for death includes indemnification for consequential
damages. — “Having held that it had discretion in the premises,
the court easily yielded to the argument that simply because it
had credited the respondent with two mitigating circumstances, it
was already justified in eliminating the items of damages already
adverted to, presumably having in mind said Art. 2204 which
provides that: x x x
Of course, this was clear error, inasmuch as construed literally
or otherwise, the quoted provision does not warrant a complete
deletion of said items of damages. In any event, the court evidently
failed to take into account that several other provisions can come
into play considering the circumstances in this case.
When the commission of a crime results in death, the civil
obligations arising therefrom are governed by the penal laws, ‘x
x x subject to the provisions of Art. 2177, and of the pertinent
provisions of Chapter 2, Preliminary Title on Human Relations,
and of Title XVIII of this Book (Book IV) regulating damages.’
(Art. 1161, Civil Code)

Thus, ‘every person criminally liable for a felony is also civilly
liable.’ (Art. 100, Revised Penal Code.) This civil liability in case the
felony involves death, includes indemnification for consequential
damages (Art. 104, id.) and said consequential damages in turn
include ‘x x x those suffered by his family or by a third person
by reason of the crime.’ (Art. 107, id.) Since these provisions are
subject, however, as above indicated, to certain provisions of the
Civil Code, We will now turn to said provisions.
The general rule in the Civil Code is that: x x x (Art. 2002.)

When, however, the crime committed involves death, there is
Art. 2206 which provides thus: x x x

It must be stressed that this amount, as well as the amount
of moral damages, may be adjudicated even without proof of pecuniary loss, the assessment of the moral damages being ‘left to
the discretion of the court, according to the circumstances of each
case.’ (Art. 2216.)

Art. 2206

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

637

Exemplary may also be imposed. x x x Arts. 2230, 2233.)’’

(4) Items of damages heirs of deceased entitled when death occurs
as a result of a crime. — “x x x Stated differently, when death occurs as a result of a crime, the heirs of the deceased are entitled
to the following items of damages.

(a) As indemnity for the death of the victim of the offense
— P12,000.00, without the need of any evidence or proof of
damages, and even though there may have been mitigating
circumstances attending the commission of the offense.

(b) As indemnity for loss of earning capacity of the deceased — an amount to be fixed by the court according to the
circumstances of the deceased related to his actual income at
the time of death and his probable life expectancy, the said
indemnity to be assessed and awarded by the court as a
matter of duty, unless the deceased had no earning capacity
at said time on account of permanent disability not caused
by the accused. If the deceased was obliged to give support,
under Art. 291, Civil Code, the recipient who is not an heir,
may demand support from the accused for not more than five
years, the exact duration to be fixed by the court.
(c) As moral damages for mental anguish — an amount
to be fixed by the court. This may be recovered even by the
illegitimate descendants and ascendants of the deceased.

(d) As exemplary damages, when the crime is attended by
one or more aggravating circumstances, — an amount to be
fixed in the discretion of the court, the same to be considered
separate from fines.
(e) As attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation — the
actual amount thereof, (but only when a separate civil action
to recover civil liability has been filed or when exemplary
damages are awarded).
(f) Interests in the proper cases.

(g) It must be emphasized that the indemnities for loss of
earning capacity of the deceased and for moral damages are
recoverable separately from and in addition to the fixed sum of
P12,000.00 corresponding to the indemnity for the sole fact of
death, and that these damages may, however, be respectively
increased or lessened according to the mitigating or aggravating circumstances, except items 1 and 4 above, for obvious

638

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

reasons.’’

(5) Award of moral damages. — “As to award of moral damage
sin case of death, this Court has already held in Mercado v. Lira,
etc., G.R. Nos. L-13328-29, September 29, 1961, that once the heirs
of the deceased claim moral damages and are able to prove they
are entitled thereto, it becomes the duty of the court to make the
award. We held:
‘Art. 2206 states further that ‘In addition’ to the amount
of at least P3,000.00 to be awarded for the death of a passenger, the spouse, legitimate and illegitimate descendants and
ascendants of the deceased may demand moral damages as a
consequence of the death of their deceased kin, which simply
means that once the above-mentioned heirs of the deceased
claim compensation for moral damages and are able to prove
that they are entitled to such award, it becomes the duty of the
court to award moral damages to the claimant in an amount
commensurate with the mental anguish suffered by them.’

This doctrine was reiterated in Maranan vs. Perez, G.R. No.
L-22272, June 26, 1967: x x x

(6) Award of compensatory damages. — “Likewise, in the matter
of the compensatory damages for the loss of earning capacity of
the deceased, We also held in the case of Daniel Bulante v. Chu
Liante, G.R. Nos. L-21583 and L-21591, May 20, 1968 that:
‘The next item objected to refers to the damages awarded
to the heirs of the deceased passengers for loss of earning
capacity, separately from the indemnities by reason of death.
The ground for the objection is that loss of earning capacity
was not specifically pleaded or claimed in the complaint. This
item, however, may be considered included in the prayer for
‘actual damages’ and for other ‘just and equitable reliefs’ especially if taken in the light of Art. 2206, in connection with
Art. 1764, of the Civil Code, which allows, in addition to an
indemnity of at least P3,000 by reason of death, recovery for
loss of earning capacity on the part of the deceased, the same
to be paid to his heirs ‘in every case x x x unless the deceased
on account of permanent physical disability not caused by the
defendant, had no earning capacity at the time of his death.’’’

(7) Doctrines involving contracts of carriage equally applicable to
civil liability ex delicto. — “To be sure, these cases of Mercado v.
Lira, Maranan v. Perez and Bulante v. Chu Liante, from which We

Art. 2206

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

639

have quoted, were actions based on contracts of common carriers. But the above-mentioned doctrines are equally applicable
to civil liability ex delicto because, after all, Art. 2206 of the Civil
Code which was applied in said cases is precisely the provision
pertinent to liability arising from crimes (and quasi-delicts).
No doubt, said Article must have been relied upon by the
court in the above cases only because Art. 1764 of the Civil Code
provides that said ‘Art. 2206 shall also apply to the death of a
passenger caused by the breach of contract of a common carrier.’
Accordingly, the interpretation given to said article in those cases
are applicable to the case at bar. In other words, this must be so
because under the Civil Code, the same rules on damages are
generally to be observed, whether death results from a crime or
a quasi-delict or a breach of the contract of common carriage.’’
(8) Items of damages recoverable. — “As to the amount of the
indemnity for moral damages and loss of earning capacity of the
deceased in the present case, the original decision of the Court
of Appeals awarding them, does not afford sufficient basis for
Us to increase the amounts fixed by said court, as prayed for by
appellants. As has already been stated, the said decision failed to
follow the Constitution, not only in not stating the law on which
it is based but also in not making the necessary findings of fact
on which it based its discretion in fixing the respective amounts
it awarded for moral and compensatory damages. x x x Anyway
as We said at the outset, petitioners are asking Us, in the prayer
of their petition for certiorari, for nothing more than to affirm ‘in
toto’ the original decision of the Court of Appeals, and in their
lone assignment of error in the present instance, their only claim
is that ‘the Court of Appeals erred when it issued the amended
decision eliminating the award of P6,000 moral damages and the
award of P13,380.00 loss of earnings of the deceased Raymundo
Castro.’
In these circumstances, even if We should award the amounts
of damages just mentioned, inspite of the absence of the pertinent
findings of fact by the Court of Appeals, We would not have to
reach beyond amounts that are undisputed by the respondent.’’
(Heirs of Raymundo Castro vs. Bustos, 27 SCRA 327 [1969].)

4. The trial judge lumped together the awards of moral damages,
attorney’s fees and lost of earnings of the victim for a total sum of

640

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

P2,000.00.

Facts: The trial court acquitted accused-appellant of the crime
of murder on reasonable doubt but convicted two other accused,
ordering them to indemnify, the heirs of the victim in the sum of
P536,113.00 as actual damages, P2,000,000.00 as moral damages,
and to pay the costs.
Issue: Should the monetary awards be modified.

Held: Yes. The awards for moral damages, attorney’s fees and
lost earning are different in nature, and hence, require separate
determination.

(1) Lost earnings of the victim. — “Leticia Salas [surviving wife]
testified that the victim was 49 years old at the time he died. He
was serving the first year of his three-year term, as member of
the Sangguniang Panlalawigan, for which he received a monthly
salary of P14,185.00. His gross income for the next three years
would be P553,215.00.4 Allowing a deduction of 50%5 from his
gross income as his reasonable and necessary living expense, his
lost earnings as councilor for three years would be P276,607.50.
As president and founder of San Jose Institute of Technology
(SJIT), the victim received an income of P5,000.00 a month. His
gross annual income would amount to P65,000. Applying the
formula: net earning capacity = life expectancy6 x [gross annual
income — reasonable and necessary living expenses (50%)], we
determine his lost earnings to be P671,666.64. In its totality, the
lost earnings of the victim amount to P948,274.14.7

(2) Award of actual damages without basis. — “We set aside the
award of P536,113.00 as actual damages for lack of basis. During
the trial, private complainant Leticia Salas testified that the following amounts were spent as a consequence of her husband’s
untimely death: P33,000.00 for food during the eleven (11) days
of prayer; P70,000.00 for the funeral parlor; P30,000.00 for food
during the burial; P500.00 for the fees to the church; P5,000.00
for mourning clothes; P20,000.00 for food during the 40th day
service; P5,000.00 for tomb construction; P1,000.00 for gasoline;
P495.00 for the hospitalization of Nicomedes Salas; and P200.00
for telegrams. These expenses totalled P165,195.00.’’

(3) Award of moral damages excessive. — “We find the award
of P2,000,000.00 as moral damages to be excessive. Although no
proof of pecuniary loss is required in the assessment of moral
damages, the award is essentially by way of indemnity or reparation. Moral damages are not awarded to punish the defendant

Art. 2206

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

641

but to compensate the victim. The award is not meant to enrich
the victim at the expense of the defendant. We find that an award
of P50,000.00 is commensurate to the emotional suffering of the
victim’s heirs.’’
(4) Award of death indemnity and attorney’s fees reasonable. —
“Additionally, we award P50,000.00 as indemnity by reason of the
death of the victim in accord with Article 2206 of the Civil Code
and prevailing jurisprudence. The award of attorney’s fees is set
at P25,000.00 which is reasonable considering that the proceedings
at the lower court lasted four years.’’ (People vs. Aringue, 89 SCAD
810, 283 SCRA 291 [1997].)

Other cases on life expectancy.

(1) “The monetary liabilities of a person accused and convicted of a crime are specified in Article 2206 of the Civil Code:
xxx
Aside, therefore, from the ordinary indemnity for death
which is currently set by case law at P50,000.00, appellant is
obliged: (1) to compensate the heirs of Rolando Manahan for
the latter’s loss of earning capacity; (2) to give support in the
form of expenses for education to the sisters of Rolando Manahan who had been dependent on him therefor; and (3) to pay
the heirs of Rolando Manahan moral damages for the mental
anguish suffered by them. In the instant case, the trial court
lumped these monetary obligations into what it called “moral
damages.”

The more important variables taken into account in determining the compensable amount of lost earnings are: (1) the number
of years for which the victim would otherwise have lived; and
(2) the rate of loss sustained by the heirs of the deceased. In Villa
Rey Transit, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals (supra.), the Court computed
the first factor, i.e., life expectancy, by applying the formula
(2/3 x [80 age at death]) adopted in the American Expectancy
Table of Mortality or the actuarial Combined Experience Table
of Mortality. That formula was followed by the Court in cases
subsequent to Villa Rey Transit, e.g., Philippine Airlines vs. Court
of Appeals, People v. Daniel (supra); and Dangwa Transportation
Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals.
The Court notes that the formula used in Villa Rey Transit

642

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

was based on a table derived from actuarial experience prior
to 1970 when the decision in Villa Rey Transit was promulgated.
Actuarial experience subsequent to 1970 has, however, changed
and indicates a longer life expectancy in the Philippines due to
conditions including, among other things, advances in medical
science, improved nutrition and food supply, diet consciousness
and health maintenance. The 1970 mortality table was updated
in, the Commissioner’s Standard Ordinary Mortality Table (1980
CSO.) to reflect the changes of conditions.
Considering that Rolando Manahan was 26 years of age
at the time of death, he was expected to live for another 46
years. This is derived by using the generally accepted formula
in computing for life expectancy, based on the 1980 CSO table:
(Lx+1, Lx+2, .., Lx+n),

		
Lx
where n = 100 – x
		 x = age upon death
		 L = number of people in sample surviving
					after x number of years

But a man does not normally continue working to earn money
up to the final month or year of his life; hence 46 years could
be reasonably reduced to 39 years. Besides, Rolando Manahan
was a government employee who is expected to retire at the
age of 65. If there are 261 working days in a year and Rolando
Manahan was receiving P23.00 a day, Rolando Manahan’s gross
earnings would be approximately P234,000.00. A reasonable
amount must be deducted therefrom that would represent
Rolando Manahan’s necessary expenses had he been living, in
this case P120,000.00. The net or compensable earnings lost by
reason of Rolando Manahan’s death is, accordingly, P114,000.00.
Finally, the Court in the exercise of its discretion, considers
it appropriate and reasonable to award the amount of P20,000.00
to the heirs of Rolando Manahan by way of moral damages.
Ruben Manahan, brother of Rolando Manahan, testified that
their mother suffered a mild stroke upon learning of Rolando
Manahan’s slaying; this eventually resulted in the mother’s
semi-paralysis.’’ (People vs. Quilaton, 205 SCRA 279 [1992].)

Note: The Supreme Court reverted to the Villa Rey formula
in subsequent cases. (see People vs. Suitos, 220 SCRA 420
[1993]; Baliwag Transit, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 262 SCRA
230 [1996]; People vs. Cordero, 263 SCRA 122 [1996]; People
vs. Aringue, supra.)
(2) “The Court of Appeals, in reducing Luna’s life expectancy from 30 to 10 years said that his habit and manner of
life should be taken into account, i.e., that he had been engaged
in car racing as a sport both here and abroad — a dangerous
and risky activity tending to shorten his life expectancy. That
Luna had engaged in car racing is not based on any evidence
on record. That Luna was engaged in go-kart racing is the correct statement but then go-kart racing cannot be categorized as
a dangerous sport for go-karts are extremely low slung, low
powered vehicles, only slightly larger than foot-pedalled four
wheeled conveyances. It was error on the part of the Court of
Appeals to have disturbed the determination of the trial court
which it had previously affirmed.
Similarly, it was error for the Court of Appeals to reduce
the net annual income of the deceased by increasing his annual
personal expenses but without at the same time increasing his
annual gross income. It stands to reason that if his annual personal expenses should increase because of the ‘escalating price
of gas which is a key expenditure in Roberto R. Luna’s social
standing’ [a statement which lacks complete basis], it would
not be unreasonable to suppose that his income would not be
unreasonable to suppose that his income would also increase
considering the manifold sources thereof.’’ (Rodriguez-Luna vs.

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

Intermediate Appellate Court, 135 SCRA 242 [1985].)

(3) “The deceased was employed as manager of a radio
station, from which he was earning P8,400.00 a year, consisting
of a monthly salary of P600.00 and allowance of P100.00. As a
lawyer and junior partner of his father in the law office, he had
an annual income of P3,600.00. From farming he was getting
an average of P3,000.00. All in all therefore the deceased had
gross earnings of P15,000.00 a year.
According to Article 2206, paragraph (1), of the Civil Code,
‘the defendant shall be liable for the loss of the earning capacity of the deceased and indemnity shall be paid to the heirs of
the latter.’ This Article, while referring to ‘damages for death
caused by crime or quasi-delict,’ is expressly made applicable by
Article 1764 ‘to the death of a passenger caused by the breach
of contract by a common carrier.’

The deceased, Pedro Davila, Jr., was single and 30 years
of age when he died. At that age one’s normal life expectancy
is 33 1/3 years, according to the formula (2/3 x [80 – 30])
adopted by this Court in the case of Villa Rey Transit, Inc. vs.
Court of Appeals on the basis of the American Expectancy Table
of Mortality or the Actuarial of Combined Experience Table of
Mortality. However, although the deceased was in relatively
good health, his medical history shows that he had complained
of and been treated for such ailments as backaches, chest pains
and occasional feelings of tiredness. It is reasonable to make an
allowance for these circumstances and consider, for purposes of
this case, a reduction of his life expectancy to 25 years.
x x x		
xxx
Considering the fact the deceased was getting his income
from three (3) different sources, namely, from managing a radio station, from law practice and from farming, the expenses
incidental to the generation of such income were necessarily
more than if he had only one source. Together with his living expenses, a deduction of P600.00 a month, or P7,200.00 a
year, seems to Us reasonable, leaving a net yearly income of

P7,800.00. This amount, multiplied by 25 years, or P195,000.00
is the amount which should be awarded to the plaintiffs in this
particular respect.

Under Article 2206, in relation to Article 1764, of the Civil
Code, the parents of the deceased are entitled to moral damages
for their mental anguish. The trial court awarded P10,000.00 in
this concept, and We find no justification to change the award,
considering the long period of uncertainty and suffering the
plaintiffs underwent from November 23, when the plane crash
occurred, to December 19, when they received a letter from
the defendant’s president confirming the death of their son,
and again to the following December 29, when his body was
finally recovered and taken back to them. (Davila vs. Philippine
Air Lines, 49 SCRA 491 [1973].)
(4) “The amount of loss of earning capacity is based mainly
on two factors: (1) the number of years on the basis of which
the damages shall be computed; and (2) the rate at which the
losses sustained by the respondents should be fixed. (Villa Rey
Transit Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 31 SCRA 511.)
The deceased was single and thirty-two years of age at the
time of his death. He was earning P50.00 daily as driver of a
passenger jeepney.

By applying the formula 2/3 x (80 – 32) = Life Expectancy
the normal life expectancy of the victim would be thirty-two
years. Although there is no evidence as to the condition of the
victim’s health at the time of his death, we must take into account
the fact that drivers of passenger jeepneys cannot continue the
backbreaking pace and unnerving nature of their work for those
many years. It is thus reasonable to make allowances for these
circumstances and reduce the life expectancy of the deceased
to 25 years. (see Davila vs. Philippine Airlines, 28 SCRA 497.)
Relative to the second factor, we held in Villa Rey Transit,
Inc. vs. Court of Appeals (31 SCRA 511), that: x x x

‘It is reasonable to fix the deductible living and other
incidental expenses of the deceased at the sum of Eight
Hundred (P800.00) Pesos monthly or Nine Thousand, Six
Hundred (P9,600.00) Pesos annually. Likewise, it is difficult

646

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

to conclude that, George Angcahas, if he were alive, would
drive a passenger jeepney everyday for the next thirty-two (32)
years. It is more than reasonable to fix at twenty (20) days a
month Angcahas’ working days. Thus, the loss sustained by
the heirs of the deceased maybe roughtly estimated at Two
Hundred Pesos (P200.00) every month or Two Thousand,
Four Hundred Pesos (P2,400.00) annually or Seventy Six
Thousand, Eight Hundred Pesos (P76,800.00) for thirty-two
years.’’’ (People vs. Daniel, 136 SCRA 92 [1988].)

(5) “Actual damages were proved in the amount of P11,575
and not P20,000 as found by the trial court. In determining
the loss of earning capacity of 49 year old Ylarde, We use the
formula for life expectancy adopted in Davila vs. CA: 2/3 x
(80-49) = life expectancy of 20 years. This figure is multiplied
by the annual net income of the deceased (P16,000), equivalent
to P320,000 to fix the amount of loss earning capacity. Death
indemnity in the amount of P50,000 is also awarded.’’ (People
vs. Suitos, 220 SCRA 419 [1993].)
(6) “As regards the reasonableness of the damages awarded,
under Art. 1764, in conjunction with Art. 2206, of the Civil
Code, as well as established jurisprudence, several factors are
considered, namely: (a) life expectancy (considering the health of
the deceased and the mortality table being deemed conclusive)
and loss of earning capacity; (b) pecuniary loss, loss of support
and service; and (c) moral and mental sufferings. The loss of
earnings capacity is based mainly on two factors, namely, the
number of years on the basis of which the damages shall be
computed, and the rate at which the loss sustained by the heirs
should be fixed.

Finding discrepancies in the computation of respondent
Court of Appeals, we here opine that the correct computation
of the loss of earning capacity of the deceased, considering
that he was the sole bread-winner of the family and only 29
years old when he met his untimely death, should be based
on the formula: 2/3 x 51 (80 – 29 [age at time of death]) = life
expectancy. Thus

SCAD 586, 262 SCRA 230 [1996].)
(7) “Our review on the computation of damages awarded to
the legal heirs of Gary Salvosa, particularly for loss of earning
capacity, reveals that the victim’s life expectancy was fixed at
sixty (60) years. Considering that the victim was forty one (41)
years old at the time of death and had an income of P50,000.00
per year, the trial court awarded P950,000.00 for the lost earnings of the victim for 19 years.

The computation is erroneous. The formula consistently used
by this Court in determining life expectancy is (2/3 x [80 – age
of the victim at the time of death]). Thus, the victim’s income
of P50,000.00 should be multiplied by twenty six (26) years, not
nineteen (19) years. Accordingly, the award for loss of earning
capacity should be P1,300,000.00.

The actual damages awarded in the amount of P86,371.00
should also be corrected because some of the expenses included
in the computation are not in accord with the guidelines set

648

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

in People vs. Degoma and Taborada (209 SCRA 266 [1992].) We
disallow the amount of P9,000.00 spent by Ray Dean Salvosa,
brother of the victim, in connection with the investigation of the
case, and the amount of P42.00 representing snacks for lawyers.
Thus, the award for actual damages is reduced to P77,329.00.
In Degoma, we held:

‘. . . Of the expenses allegedly incurred, the Court can
only give credence to those supported by receipt and which
appear to have been genuinely incurred in connection with
the death, wake or burial of the victim. Thus, the Court
cannot take account of receipts showing expenses incurred
before the date of the slaying of the victim; those incurred
after a considerable lapse of time from the burial of the
victim and which do not have any relation to the death,
wake or burial of the victim; those incurred for purely aesthetic or social purposes, such as the lining with marble of
the tomb of the victim; those which appear to have been
modified to show an increase in the amount of expenditure
. . . ; those expenditures which could not be reasonably
itemized or determined to have been incurred in connection
with the death, wake or burial of the victim; those which,
nonetheless, would have been incurred despite the death,
wake and burial of the victim, the death, wake and burial
being merely incidental; and those which were not in fact
shouldered by the immediate heirs of the victim, such as
plane tickets by relatives or in-laws. . . .’’’ (People vs. Cordero,
263 SCRA 122 [1996].)

(8) “The amount of P100,000 was presumably awarded primarily for loss of earning capacity but even then the amount
must be modified. In accordance with our cases8 on this question, the formula for determining the life expectancy of Dalmacio Salunoy must be determined by applying the formula 2/3
multiplied by (80 minus the age of the deceased). Since Salunoy
was 46 years of age at the time of his death, as stated in his
death certificate, then his life expectancy was 22.6 years, or up
to 68 years old.
Next, his net earnings must be computed. At the time of his
death, Dalmacio Salunoy was earning more than P900.00 a month

Art. 2206

as bookkeeper at the PMCI so that his annual gross earnings
was about P11,000.00. From this amount, about 50% should be
deducted as reasonable and necessary living expenses9 because
it seems his wife occasionally finds work and thus helps in the
household expenses.

Court of Appeals, 300 SCRA 20 [1998].)

(9) “In the controlling case of Villa Rey Transit Inc. vs. Court
of Appeals (where P33,333.33 for loss of net earnings of P1,000.00
per year x 33-1/3 years of life expectancy were awarded) as
reaffirmed in Davila vs. Philippine Air Lines (where P195,000.00damages were awarded based on net earnings of P7,200.00 per
year x 25 years of life expectancy), the Court stressed two factors
in the award of such compensatory damages, to wit, (1) ‘life
expectancy is not only relevant but also an important element
in fixing the amount recoverable’ and (2) ‘earning capacity, as
an element of damages to one’s estate for his death by wrongful act is necessarily his net earning capacity or his capacity to
acquire money, ‘less the necessary expense for his own living.’
Stated otherwise, the amount recoverable is not loss of the entire
earning, but rather the loss of that portion of the earnings which
the beneficiary would have received. In other words, only net
earnings, not gross earning, are to be considered, that is, the
total of the earnings less expenses necessary in the creation of

650

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

such earnings or income and less living and other incidental
expenses.’
Petitioner, citing the Villa Rey doctrine, contends in its petition that the maximum damages that should be awarded would
amount to only P103,680.00 based on its contention that the
victim’s life expectancy should be 24 years (not 26 years) and
net earnings only at P4,320.00 a year, thus:

‘The deceased Carmen G. Mariano, at the time of her
death, was 39 years old. On the basis of the above formula
(2/3 x 80-30) the deceased’s normal life expectancy would
be 24 years and not 27 years [sic]) at that age of 39 years
old, . . ., in the case at bar, the amount of at least P800.00
should be considered as reasonable monthly deduction from
the income of the deceased or the sum of P9,600.00 a year.
‘The deceased’s yearly income was P13,920.00. Less the
above amount of P9,600.00, the deceased’s net earning capacity would, therefore, be only P4,320.00 a year. Multiply this
amount by 24 years (the deceased’s normal life expectancy
at age 39 years old, as above computed), the amount due
private respondent, as compensatory damages, will then be
P103,680.00 . . .’

In its memorandum, petitioner would further reduce the
life expectancy of the deceased Carmen G. Mariano to 20 years
instead of 24 years, arguing that ‘while it may be said that at
the time of her death, Carmen G. Mariano was in relatively
good health, yet undergoing a major surgery such as caesarian operation is a circumstance that would have affected her
normal life expectancy and this fact should be considered as
further allowance and hence, for purposes of this case, her life
expectancy may be reduced further to 20 years,’ and on this
basis ‘(T)he deceased’s yearly income was P13,920.00. Less the
amount of P9,600.00, the deceased’s net earning capacity would,
therefore, be only P4,320.00 a year. Multiply this amount by
20 years (her normal life expectancy as hereinbefore computed
by us), the amount due private respondent, as compensatory
damages, will then be only P86,400.00.’
Respondents, on the other hand, contend that in the ab-

Art. 2206

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

651

sence of a clear showing that the determination of the amount
of compensatory damages based on life expectancy and the
net earning capacity of the deceased is manifestly arbitrary or
excessive, such award should be sustained.

All factors considered, the Court believes that it is fair and
reasonable to fix the deductible living and other expenses of
the deceased at the sum of P4,800.00 a year or P400.00 a month
(one-half of the amount of P9,600.00 a year or P800.00 a month
urged by petitioners, since the deceased’s husband had also his
own earnings and this sum would be her fair share of the family’s expenses. Petitioner has expressly conceded the deceased’s
life expectancy to be at 20 to 24 years, supra. All in all, the Court
believes that an award of P200,000.00 as compensatory damages
by way of the deceased’s lost earnings is completely justified,
under the facts of the case at bar. (This would be roughly based
on an annual net earning of P9,120.00 [P13,920.00 gross earnings
less P4,800.00 annual expenses] x 22 years of life expectancy
= P200,640.00). Such award of P200,000.00 for compensatory
damages incidentally coincides with the exact amount prayed
for as compensatory damages for loss of earning capacity in
respondent’s complaint.’’ (MD Transit Inc. vs. Court of Appeals,
90 SCRA 542 [1979].)

(10) “It is worth noting that Arturo Monzon, at the time of
his death, was 40 years old and in good health. He left a widow
and 8 children with ages from 5 to 19. He had a flourishing legal
practice, specializing in taxation and was retained by a number
of large companies. He had a total net income, as formally declared in his tax returns, P213,493.13 for the year 1967. Pursuant
to the formula established and repeatedly applied by this Court
(Villa Rey Transit v. Court of Appeals, 31 SCRA 511; Davila vs.
Philippine Airlines, 49 SCRA 497; Abeto v. Philippine Airlines,
115 SCRA 389; Philippine Airlines v. Court of Appeals, 106 SCRA
391), the loss of earning capacity (as provided for in Article 2206,
New Civil Code) arising from the death of Arturo Monzon was
computed by the trial court in the following manner:
‘Loss of earning capacity equals 2/3 x [80-40] x
P213,493.13 equals P5,691,726.84.’

Inevitably, We cannot disturb the findings of the lower court

652

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

as to the amount of compensatory damages recoverable by
petitioners for the same were in accordance with the law and
jurisprudence. In trying to justify the reduction of damages,
respondent court stated in its decision that plaintiffs-appellees
(petitioners herein) previously asked for a lower compensation than in their later demand in the lower court. However,
respondent court failed to point out that the request was made
‘by way of amicable settlement.’ Obviously, the complaint which
was filed with the lower court subsequent to respondent Davies’
refusal to enter into an amicable settlement would represent a
higher amount.
In further attempting to justify its reduction of damages,
respondent court went on to say:

‘Moreover, the determination of life expectancy of a
person who perishes in an accident like the case at bar
cannot be definite as it fluctuates with several factors and
for this reason the amount always lies within the discretion

The income tax returns may give an idea of the earning
capacity of a person for a particular year, but such return
is by no means fixed or permanent for the many uncertain
years that follow later.’

We agree with respondent court in saying that life expectancy ‘fluctuates with several factors’ (p. 72, Rollo) but it is for

that very reason that a generally accepted formula cited earlier
was established by this court in a long line of cases. Otherwise
stated, while respondent court suggests that Arturo Monzon
might have lived for less than 26.4 years more, or until the age
of 66, there is also the possibility that he would have lived for
much more than 26.4 years. Hence, the need of the formula by
way of arriving at a logical and workable average. Furthermore,
it would be most unfair and illogical for respondent court to
have reduced the compensation due petitioners for the loss of
the earning capacity of Arturo Monzon by discarding the well
established formula by taking a pessimistic and depressed view
of every situation instead of an average standard. Moreover,
as a man grows older, and gains more experience, his income
generally increases, with each passing year.’’ (Monzon vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 169 SCRA 760 [1989].)
(11) “Petitioner insists that Borja is not entitled to the full
amount of damages awarded by the lower courts. It disputes
the use of his gross earning as basis for the computation of the
award for loss of earning capacity. Both courts, in computing the
value of such loss, used the remaining years of the victim as a
government employee and the amount he had been receiving
per annum at the time of the incident.

Counsel for Respondent Borja, on the other hand, claims that
petitioner had no cause to complain, because the miscomputation had ironically been in its favor. The multiplier used in the
computation was erroneously based on the remaining years in
government service, instead of the life expectancy, of the victim.
Borja’s counsel also points out that the award was based on the
former’s meager salary in 1987, or about 23 years ago when
the foreign exchange was still P14 to $1. Hence, the questioned
award is consistent with the primary purpose of giving what is
just, moral and legally due the victim as the aggrieved party.
Both parties have a point. In determining the reasonableness
of the damages awarded under Article 1764 in conjunction with
Article 2206 of the Civil Code, the factors to be considered are:
(1) life expectancy (considering the health of the victim and the
mortality table which is deemed conclusive) and loss of earning
capacity; (b) pecuniary loss, loss of support and service; and

654

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

(c) moral and mental sufferings. The loss of earning capacity
is based mainly on the number of years remaining in the person’s expected life span. In turn, this number is the basis of the
damages that shall be computed and the rate at which the loss
sustained by the heirs shall be fixed.
The formula for the computation of loss of earning capacity
is as follows:

Net earning capacity = Life expectancy x [Gross Annual
Income – Living Expenses (50% of gross annual income)],
where life expectancy = 2/3 (80 – the age of the deceased).
Petitioner is correct in arguing that it is net income (or gross
income less living expenses) which is to be used in the computation of the award for loss of income. Villa Rey Transit vs. Court
of Appeals explained that ‘the amount recoverable is not the loss
of the entire earning, but rather the loss of that portion of the
earnings which the beneficiary would have received.’ Hence, in
fixing the amount of the said damages, the necessary expenses
of the deceased should be deducted from his earnings.

In other words, only net earnings, not gross earnings, are
to be considered; that is, the total of the earnings less expenses
necessary in the creation of such earnings or income, less living and other incidental expenses. When there is no showing
that the living expenses constituted a smaller percentage of the
gross income, we fix the living expenses at half of the gross
income. To hold that one would have used only a small part of
the income, with the larger part going to the support of one’s
children, would be conjectural and unreasonable.
Counsel for Respondent Borja is also correct in saying that life
expectancy should not be based on the retirement age of government employees, which is pegged at 65. In Negros Navigation Co,
Inc. vs. CA, (281 SCRA 534, 5218 [1997].), the Court resolved that
in calculating the life expectancy of an individual for the purpose
of determining loss of earning capacity under Article 2206(1) of
the Civil Code, it is assumed that the deceased would have earned
income even after retirement from a particular job.
Respondent Borja should not be situated differently just

Art. 2206

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

655

because he was a government employee. Private employees,
given the retirement packages provided by their companies,
usually retire earlier than government employees; yet, the life
expectancy of the former is not pegged at 65 years.
Petitioner avers that Respondent Borja died nine years after
the incident and, hence, his life expectancy of 80 years should
yield to the reality that he was only 59 when he actually died.

We disagree. The Court uses the American Experience/
Expectancy Table of Mortality or the Actuarial or Combined
Experience Table of Mortality, which consistently pegs the life
span of the average Filipino at 80 years, from which it extrapolates the estimated income to be earned by the deceased had
he or she not been killed.
Respondent Borja’s demise earlier than the estimated life
span is of no moment. For purposes of determining loss of
earning capacity, life expectancy remains at 80. Otherwise, the
computation of loss of earning capacity will never become final,
being always subject to the eventuality of the victim’s death.
The computation should not change even if Borja lived beyond
80 years. Fair is fair.
Based on the foregoing discussion, the award for loss of
earning capacity should be computed as follows:

Loss of earning =
[2 (80-50)] x [(P2,752 x 12) – 16,512]
capacity

				=

P 330,240.’’

SCRA 341 [2002].)

(12) “In fixing the indemnity, account is taken of the victim’s
annual income at the time of his death and his probable life
expectancy. Thus, in People vs. Mapalit (396 SCRA 687 [2003].),
the following formula was adopted by this Court:

656

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

In the absence of proof of living expenses, the net income
is deemed to be 50% of the gross income.

Nestor was 38 years old at the time of his death. Per Certification of the Philippine National Bank where Nestor worked
as an Investment Specialist, his annual income is P55,380.00.
Thus, by reason of the death of the victim, the heirs should be
awarded the amount of P775,320.00 for loss of earning capacity,
computed as follows:
=

2/3 x (80 – 38) x (P55,380.00 – 1/2 [P27,690.00])

=

28 x P27,690.00

=
=

2/3 x 42 x P27,690.00
P775,320.00.’’

(People vs. Malinao, 423 SCRA 34 [2004].)
Brief rulings under Article 2206.
(1) It is well-settled that when death occurs as a result of
the commission of a crime, the following items of damages may
be recovered: (1) an indemnity for the death of the victim; (2)
an indemnity for loss of earning capacity of the deceased; (3)
moral damages; (4) exemplary damages; (5) attorney’s fees and
expenses of litigation; and (6) interest in proper cases.

The indemnity for loss of earning capacity, moral damages,
exemplary damages, attorney’s fees, and interests are recoverable
separately from and in addition to the fixed sum of P12,000.00
(now P50,000) corresponding to the indemnity for the sole fact
of death. The indemnity arising from the fact of death due to a
crime is fixed whereas the others are still subject to the determination of the court based on the evidence presented. The fact
that the witnesses were not interrogated on the issue of damages
is of no moment because the death indemnity fixed for death
is separate and distinct from the other forms of indemnity for
damages. (Briñas vs. People, 125 SCRA 687 [1983].)

(2) The father of the fetus that was aborted without his
consent, is not entitled to recover damages from the doctor
under Article 2206 because it is not yet endowed with juridical

(3) A widow whose husband died when he fell from a
speeding, overcrowded train, was denied moral and exemplary
damages because he was guilty of contributory negligence although the carrier was held liable for actual damages, including
loss of earning capacity and attorney’s fees. (Philippine National
Railways vs. Court of Appeals, 139 SCRA 87 [1985].)

(4) In case of death, the spouse, legitimate descendants and
ascendants, illegitimate descendants and ascendants are the
ones entitled to moral damages not the brother or sister of the
decedent. (see Receiver for North Negros Sugar Co., Inc. vs.
Ybañez, 24 SCRA 97 [1968]; Gonzales vs. Alegarbes, 99 Phil.
213 [1956]; see Art. 2219, last par.)
(5) The court may consider the financial standing or capacity of the common carrier to determine the amount of damages
to be awarded. It is in fixing a greater amount of indemnity
that courts may consider the financial capacity of the common
carrier, along with such other factors as (a) the life expectancy
of the deceased or of the beneficiary, whichever is shorter, (b)
pecuniary loss to the plaintiff or beneficiary, (c) loss of support,
(d) loss of service, (e) loss of society, (f) mental suffering of
beneficiaries, and (g) medical and funeral expenses. (Pantranco
vs. Legaspi, 12 SCRA 592 [1964]; Davila vs. Phil. Air Lines, 49
SCRA 497 [1973]; Alcantara vs. Surro, 93 Phil. 472 [1953].)

Note: In Pantranco, Reyes, J.B.L., J., concurred and dissented
in part:
“But I must dissent in so far as the decision implies that
inquiries into the resources of a defendant would be permissible whenever damages, pecuniary or moral, are sought.

To recapitulate: compensatory and moral damages can
only be awarded to indemnify the victim or his relatives
for the prejudice suffered, and the financial standing of
the person responsible is irrelevant to their evaluation. The
omission in the Civil Code of any reference to the defendant’s pecuniary ability, as was heretofore done by Commonwealth Act No. 284, confirms this thesis. The ruling in
Alcantara vs. Surro, 93 Phil. 472, is predicated precisely on

658

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

that Commonwealth Act, and not on the Civil Code now
in force, and is inapplicable. In so far as the award exceeds
indemnification, it trenches on the sphere of corrective damages that are justified by other special circumstances set out
by the Civil Code.

I am constrained to insist on these principles, because
the cases brought to this Court show a lamentable disregard
of the carefully structured system of damages of our Civil
Code. A prime illustration is the complaint that initiated
this case in the court below, where nominal and compensatory
damages are both prayed for; yet a modicum of common
sense ought to show that damages cannot be both nominal
and actual at the same time (Civil Code, Article 2221).’’

basically a process of legal substitution: the insurer, after paying
the amount covered by the insurance policy, steps into the shoes
of the insured, as it were, availing himself of the latter’s rights
that exist against the wrongdoer at the time of the loss. It has
its roots in equity designed to compel the ultimate payment of
a debt by one who in justice, equity and good conscience ought
to pay. (Phil. American General Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Court of

subrogation under Article 2207 applies only to property, and
not to life insurance. The value of human life is regarded as
unlimited and, therefore, no recovery from a third party can
be deemed adequate to compensate the insured’s beneficiary.

Life insurance contracts are not ordinarily contracts of indemnity.

(3) Right of insured to recover from both insurer and third party.
— The right of subrogation given to the insurer prevents the
insured from obtaining more than the amount of his loss. It is
a method of implementing the principle of indemnity that is at
the heart of all insurance. The right exists after indemnity has
been paid by the insurer to the insured who can no longer go
after the third party. He can only recover once.

Note, however, that if the amount paid by the insurance

Net

grieved party, i.e., the insured, not the insurer, who is entitled

to recover the deficiency from the person responsible for the
loss or injury. (see F.F. Cruz & Co., Inc. vs. Court of Appeals,
164 SCRA 731 [1988].)

(4) Right of insurer against third party limited to amount recoverable from latter by the insured. — The literal language of Article
2207 makes it clear that the insurance company that has paid
indemnity “shall be subrogated to the rights of the insured
against the wrongdoer or the person who has violated the contract.” As the insurer is subrogated merely to the rights of the
insured, it can necessarily recover only the amount recoverable
by the insured from the party responsible for the loss. It cannot
recover in full the amount it paid to the insured if it is greater
than that to which the insured could lawfully lay claim against
the person causing the loss. (Rizal Surety & Insurance Co. vs.
Manila Railroad Co., 23 SCRA 205 [1968].)

The Code Commission notes that “according to American
Jurisprudence, the fact that the plaintiff has been indemnified

660

DAMAGES

Art. 2206

by an insurance company cannot lessen the damages to be paid
by the defendant. Such rule gives more damages than those
actually suffered by the plaintiff; and the defendant, if also
sued by the insurance for reimbursement would have to pay
in many cases twice the damages he has caused. The proposed
article would seem to be a better adjustment of the rights of
the three parties concerned.’’ (Report, p. 73.)
Art. 2208. In the absence of stipulation, attorney’s
fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial
costs, cannot be recovered, except:
(1) When exemplary damages are awarded;
(2) When the defendant’s act or omission has
compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third persons
or to incur expenses to protect his interest;
(3) In criminal cases of malicious prosecution
against the plaintiff;
(4) In case of a clearly unfounded civil action or
proceeding against the plaintiff;
(5) Where the defendant acted in gross and evident bad faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiff’s
plainly valid, just and demandable claim;
(6) In actions for legal support;
(7) In actions for the recovery of wages of household helpers, laborers and skilled workers;
(8) In actions for indemnity under workmen’s
compensation and employer’s liability laws;

specified in the following article. (29a)
Art. 41. For civil purposes, the fetus is considered born if it is alive at the time it is
completely delivered from the mother’s womb. However, if the fetus had an intra-uterine
life of less than seven months, it is not deemed born if it dies within twenty-four hours
after its complete delivery from the maternal womb. (30a)

(11) In any other case where the court deems it
just and equitable that attorney’s fees and expenses
of litigation should be recovered.
In all cases, the attorney’s fees and expenses of
litigation must be reasonable.
Attorney’s fees recoverable even in the absence
of stipulation.
The old rule before the adoption of the new Civil Code was
that attorney’s fees were not a proper element of damages. The
attorney’s fees paid by a client to his lawyer were not generally
recoverable from the other party for the reason that it was not
considered a sound public policy to place a penalty on the right
to litigate. (Tan Ti vs. Alviar, 26 Phil. 566 [1914].) Thus, no right
to such fees can accrue merely because of an adverse decision.
(Justiva vs. Court of Appeals, 7 SCRA 72 [1963].)

Now, both attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation may be
awarded as an indemnity or item of damages in favor of a litigant
(not his counsel) in the 11 cases enumerated in Article 2208, even
in the absence of stipulation. In other cases, attorney’s fees are not
recoverable where no special agreement is made by the parties.

The Code Commission “believes, that following the example
of the statutes of some States of the American Union, such fees
and expenses should be allowed in certain special cases. x x x
No fear need be entertained that litigation would be encouraged by the article. On the contrary, it may be said that this
article will lessen litigation because the obligors referred to
will be more likely to satisfy claims extra-judicially if they are
advised that they could otherwise have to pay the fees of the
opposing counsel and reimburse the other party for expenses
of litigation. In all the exceptional cases enumerated, it is but
just that the losing party should pay the attorney’s fees and

662

DAMAGES

Art. 2207

expenses of litigation.’’ (Report, pp. 73-74.)
Brief rulings on attorney’s fees.

(1) The court should make an express factual findings to
justify the grant of attorney’s fees. (Damaso vs. Hernando, 104
SCRA 111 [1981]; Warner, Barnes & Co., Ltd. vs. Luzon Surety
Co., Inc., 95 Phil. 924 [1954].) The decision should state why
attorney’s fees are being allowed. There has to be factual, legal
or equitable justification for the award. The justification cannot
be left to speculation or conjectures. (Buan vs. Camaganacan,
16 SCRA 321 [1966]; Federation of Namarco Distributors, Inc.
vs. Namarco, 4 SCRA 867 [1962]; Albenson Enterprizes Corp.
vs. Court of Appeals, 217 SCRA 16 [1993]; Mateo and Matias
vs. Diaz, 374 SCRA 33 [2002].) It is now settled that awards of
attorney’s fees must be based on findings of fact and law stated
in the decision of the trial court. (Sanitary Steam Laundry, Inc.
vs. Court of Appeals, 300 SCRA 20 [1998].)

(2) The award attorney’s fees must not be simply contained
in the dispositive portion of the decision; the reasons or grounds
for the award must be set forth in the decision itself. (Pimentel
vs. Court of Appeals, 307 SCRA 38 [1999].) For lack of factual
and legal bases in the text of the trial court’s decision, the
award should be disallowed. (Phil. National Bank vs. Court of
Appeals, 395 SCRA 272 [2003].)
(3) Where the parties have made a written agreement as to
attorney’s fees, the courts are authorized to ignore the contract,
if the amount fixed is unconscionable or unreasonable, and to
limit the fee to a reasonable amount. (Bachrach vs. Golingco,
39 Phil. 138 [1918].) The agreement between the lawyer and his
client as to attorney’s fees cannot bind the other party who was
a stranger to the contract. (Corpus vs. Cuaderno, 13 SCRA 59
[1965].)

(4) The plaintiff is not entitled to attorney’s fees where the
litigation was caused not by the defendant’s failure to pay but
by the exorbitant amount claimed by the plaintiff or because the
plaintiff “asked for too much’’ and the “defendant was justified
in resisting this action.’’ (Cachero vs. Manila Yellow Taxicab, 101
Phil. 623 [1957]; Globe Assurance Co. vs. Archache, 103 Phil.

Art. 2208

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

663

1164 [1958]; Soberano vs. Manila Railroad Company, 18 SCRA
732 [1966].)
(5) If the attorney’s fees stipulated appear to be excessive
the court may fix them on a quantum meruit basis. (Mambulao
Lumber Co. vs. Phil. National Bank, 22 SCRA 359 [1968]; Araneta
vs. Bank of America, 40 SCRA 144 [1971]; Borcena vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 147 SCRA 111 [1987].) Sound public
policy demands that courts should disregard stipulations for
counsel fees whenever they appear to be a source of speculative profit at the expense of the debtor or mortgagor. (Gorospe
vs. Gochangco, 106 Phil. 425 [1959]; Sison vs. Suntay, 102 Phil.
769 [1958]; Bachrach vs. Golingco, supra.)
(6) Attorney’s fees may be awarded in cases other than the
10 cases mentioned in Article 2208 when the court deems the
award just and equitable. (par. 11.) They should be deleted if
it is not just and equitable to award the same. (Liwanag vs.
Court of Appeals, 121 SCRA 354 [1983].) If no reason is given
by the court for awarding attorney’s fees, the award should be
disallowed in cases other than the 10 cases mentioned in Article
2208.

(7) The award of attorney’s fees by the trial court may be
increased to cover counsel’s effort in pursuing the case in the
appellate court. (Bataan Hardwood Corp. vs. Dy Pac & Co.,
Inc., 43 SCRA 450 [1972].)
(8) Attorney’s fees are not taxable costs. While judicial
discretion is required for the award of attorney’s fees, the taxation of costs is a ministerial duty. (Phil. Long Distance Tel. Co.
vs. Genovea, 116 SCRA 395 [1982]; Damaso vs. Hernando, 104
SCRA 111 [1981].)

(9) If a party loses in court, this does not necessarily mean
that he is subject to liability for attorney’s fees as damages to
the winning party. It does not make his suit wrongful. This is
the rationale for taxing costs in certain cases against the losing
party. The payment of said costs is deemed a sufficient sanction. (Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. vs. Court of Appeals, 211 SCRA
554 [1992]; Ramos vs. Ramos, 61 SCRA 284 [1974]; Santiago vs.
Dimayuga, 3 SCRA 919 [1961].)

664

DAMAGES

Art. 2208

(10) Stipulated attorney’s fees not claimed in the complaint
cannot be allowed. (Matute vs. Banzali, 62 Phil. 256 [1935].) A
claim for attorney’s fees in the nature of a counterclaim is barred
if not pleaded or prayed for in the answer to the complaint.
(Tiu Po vs. Bautista, 103 SCRA 388 [1981].)
(11) The award of attorney’s fees is essentially discretionary
with the trial court and the same should not be disturbed in
the absence of abuse of discretion. (Philippine Milling Co. vs.
Court of Appeals, 100 Phil. 566 [1956]; Francisco vs. Government
Service Insurance System, 7 SCRA 577 [1963].) It is enough that
legal services, as well as their nature, extent, and such other
facts are shown to enable the court to determine the reasonable
amount that must be awarded. (Peyer vs. Peyer, 88 Phil. 366
[1951].)

(13) No proof is required of the claim for attorney’s fees
where they were awarded as liquidated damages and were not
iniquitous nor unconscionable. (Universal Motors Corp. vs. Dy
Hian Tat, 28 SCRA 161 [1969].)
(14) The grant of exemplary damages justifies the grant of
attorney’s fees. (Air France vs. Carrascoso, 17 SCRA 155 [1966].)

(15) Claims for attorney’s fees may be asserted either in the
action in which the services have been rendered or in a separate
civil action. If the main case from which the claims for attorney’s
fees may arise has not yet become final, the determination of
the propriety of said fees and the amount thereof, should be
held in abeyance. (Quirante vs. Intermediate Appellate Court,
169 SCRA 769 [1989].)

(16) Attorney’s fees claimed under a contract for professional services are different from attorney’s fees as an item of
damages wherein the award is made in favor of the litigant,
not his counsel. In the case of the latter, the litigant, not the
counsel, is the judgment creditor who may enforce the judgment
for attorney’s fees by execution. (Ibid.)
(17) Generally, attorney’s fees are not recoverable as costs
unless expressly provided by law or imposed by the court. There
is need of proof as to the amount of damages for attorney’s
fees for Article 2208 enjoins that “in all cases, the attorney’s

Art. 2208

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

665

fees and expenses of litigation must be reasonable.’’ (last par.)
However, considering the factors to determine the amount of
attorney’s fees, the appellate court may fix attorney’s fees in
the exercise of its discretion even when the trial court did not
provide for attorney’s fees and no appeal was interposed on
this score before the appellate tribunal. (Medenilla vs. Kayanan,
40 SCRA 154 [1971].)
(18) Attorney’s fees are in the nature of actual damages
which must be duly proved. A government-owned or -controlled
corporation represented by the Government Corporate counsel
in a case must prove with convincing evidence that it incurred
attorney’s fees. (Public Estates Authority vs. Uy, 372 SCRA 180
[2001].)
(19) An award of attorney’s fees is improper on the sole basis
of an adverse decision, or where a party acted in good faith in
prosecuting a cause of action though declared unfounded, or in
the absence of clear proof that an action was intended merely
to prejudice the other party. (Filinvest Credit Corp. vs. Mendez,
152 SCRA 593 [1987].)
(20) Attorney’s fees may be denied to a plaintiff who won
the case but did not come to court with clean hands. (Siasat
vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 139 SCRA 238 [1985].)
Art. 2209. If the obligation consists in the payment of a sum of money, and the debtor incurs in
delay, the indemnity for damages, there being no
stipulation to the contrary, shall be the payment
of the interest agreed upon, and in the absence of
stipulation, the legal interest, which is six per cent
per annum. (1108)
Indemnity for damages in obligations
to pay sum of money.
(1) Penalty interest for delay or non-performance. — Damages
may be recovered under Article 117011 when the obligation is to
do something other than the payment of money but when the
obligation which the debtor failed to perform consists only in

666

DAMAGES

Art. 2208

the payment of money, the rule of damages is that laid down
in Article 2209.

The damage dues (or penalty interest) do not include and
are not included in the computation of interest as the two are
distinct claims which may be demanded separately. While interest agreed upon forms part of the consideration of the contract
itself, damage dues are usually made payable only in case of
default or non-performance of the contract. (Sentinel Insurance
Co., Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 182 SCRA 516 [1990].)

(2) Rate of the penalty interest. — The rate of the penalty
interest payable shall be that agreed upon. In the absence of
stipulation of a particular rate of penalty interest, then the additional interest shall be at a rate equal to the regular monetary
interest; and if no regular interest had been agreed upon, then
the legal interest shall be paid. The payment of the regular
interest constitutes the price or cost of the use of money and
thus, until the principal due is returned to the creditor, such
interest continues to accrue since the debtor continues to use
such principal amount. (State Investment House, Inc. vs. Court
of Appeals, 198 SCRA 390 [1991].)
Note: By virtue of the authority granted to it under Section 1 of Act No. 2655, as amended, otherwise known as the
“Usury Law,” the Monetary Board, in its Resolution No. 1622,
dated July 29, 1974, has prescribed that the rate of interest for
the loan or forbearance of any money, goods or credits and the
rate allowed in judgments, in the absence of express contract
as to such rate of interest, shall be 12% per annum. (C.B. Circ.
No. 416, July 29, 1974.)
Liability for legal interest.
(1) Loan or forbearance of money. — When the obligation
consists in the payment of money (i.e., loan or forbearance of
money), the interest due should be that which may have been
stipulated in writing. Legal interest in the nature of (actual and
compensatory) damages for non-compliance with an obligation
to pay a sum of money is recoverable even if not expressly
stipulated in writing. (Integrated Realty Corp. vs. Philippine

Art. 2208

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

667

National Bank, 174 SCRA 295 [1989].)

(a) The debtor in delay is liable to pay interest which is
now 12% per annum by virtue of Central Bank Circular No.
416 (July 29, 1974) and No. 905 (Dec. 10, 1982), as indemnity
for damages even in the absence of stipulation for the payment of interest computed from default, i.e., from judicial
or extra-judicial demand. (Art. 1169.) The claim for legal
interest and increase in the indemnity may be entertained
by the appellate court in spite of the failure of the claimant
to appeal the judgment where the appeal of the defendant
was obviously dilatory and oppressive of the rights of the
claimant. (De Lima vs. Laguna Tayabas Co., 160 SCRA 702
[1988].)

(b) Furthermore, interest due shall earn legal interest
from the time it is judicially demanded although the obligation may be silent upon this point. (Art. 2212; Cortes vs.
Venturanza, 79 SCRA 709 [1977].) Where no interest had
been stipulated by the parties, the debtor is not liable to
pay compound interest even after judicial demand for in
such case, there can be no accrued (conventional) interest
which can further earn interest upon judicial demand. (Phil.
American Accident Insurance Co., Inc. vs. Flores, 97 SCRA
811 [1980]; David vs. Court of Appeals, 114 SCAD 253, 316
SCRA 710 [1999].)

(2) Other than loan or forbearance of money. — The rate of 12%
interest referred to in C.B. Circular No. 416 applies only to loan
or forbearance of money or to cases where money is transferred
from one person to another and the obligation to return the
same or a portion thereof is adjudged. (Phil. National Bank vs.
Court of Appeals, 74 SCAD 786, 263 SCRA 766 [1996].) When
an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money
(e.g., obligation arises from a contract of purchase and sale) is
breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may
be imposed at the discretion of the court (see Art. 2210.), at the
rate of 6% per annum as provided in Article 2209 of the Civil
Code.
(3) Final and executory judgment awarding a sum of money.
— When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money

668

DAMAGES

Art. 2209

becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, where
the case falls under Nos. (1) or (2) above, shall be 12% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period
being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of
credit. (De Leon and De Leon, Jr., Comments and Cases on
Obligations and Contracts, 2003 Ed., pp. 88-89.)
Art. 2210. Interest may, in the discretion of the
court, be allowed upon damages awarded for breach
of contract.
Art. 2211. In crimes and quasi-delicts, interest
as a part of the damages may, in a proper case, be
adjudicated in the discretion of the court.
Interest awarded as damages by court.
Interest may be awarded in the discretion of the court, considering the circumstances of the case, for breach of contract
and in crimes or quasi-delicts. The amount thereof cannot be
left to speculation or conjecture but must have some factual,
legal and equitable bases.
Art. 2212. Interest due shall earn legal interest
from the time it is judicially demanded, although
the obligation may be silent upon this point. (1109a)
Compounding of interest from judicial
demand.
Compound interest is interest earned upon interest due. Article
2212 contemplates a situation where the interest stipulated by
parties had accrued which would earn legal interest from the
time of judicial demand or a suit is filed for its recovery. It is
applicable only to obligations containing a stipulation for the
payment of interest. If there were no stipulation as to interest,
there would be no compounding of interest since one of the
requisites for the recovery of interest is that the payment of
interest must be expressly stipulated. (Art. 1956.)
It may be stipulated that the interest due and unpaid may
draw interest when it is due. (Gov’t. of the P.I. vs. Schenkal, 43
Phil. 616 [1922]; Villaroel vs. Alvayda, 46 Phil. 277 [1924].) The

Art. 2209

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

669

stipulation may provide for a different rate.
Art. 2213. Interest cannot be recovered upon
unliquidated claims or damages, except when the
demand can be established with reasonable certainty.
Interest on unliquidated claims or damages.
Claims or damages are unliquidated when the amount
thereof is not yet definitely ascertained; hence, it is not possible
to compute the interest upon the same.
Under Article 2213, no interest shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages except when or until the demand can
be established with reasonable certainty.
Accordingly:

(1) Where the demand is established with reasonable certainty the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is
made judicially or extra-judicially. (Art. 1169.)

(2) When such certainty cannot be so reasonably established
at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run
only from the date the judgment of the court is made (not from
promulgation of the appellate court’s decision), at which time
the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been
reasonably ascertained, for until the net amount of the debtor’s
liability has been determined, he cannot be considered delinquent in the fulfillment of his obligation to pay the same with
interest thereon. The actual base for the computation of legal
interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.
(De Leon & De Leon, Jr., op. cit., pp. 89-90.)
Guidelines for the application of the proper
interest rates.
In Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals (53 SCAD
207, 234 SCRA 78 [1994].), the Supreme Court gave the followfor damages. (1101)

670

DAMAGES

Art. 2209

ing guidelines:

(1) When an obligation, regardless of its source, i.e., law,
contracts, quasi-contracts, delicts or quasi-delicts is breached,
the contravenor can be held liable for damages. The provisions
under Title XVIII on “Damages’’ of the Civil Code govern in
determining the measure of recoverable damages.
(2) With regard particularly to an award of interest in the
concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows:

(a) When the obligation is breached, and it consists in
the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan or forbearance
of money, the interest due should be that which may have
been stipulated in writing. Furthermore, the interest due
shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially
demanded.

In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall
be 12% per annum to be computed from default, i.e., from
judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the
provisions of Article 1169.
(b) When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount
of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of
the court at the rate of 6% per annum. No interest, however,
shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages except
when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty.

Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time
the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169.) but
when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at
the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run
only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at
which time the quantification of damages may be deemed
to have been reasonably ascertained). The actual base for
the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be the
amount finally adjudged.
(c) When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of

Arts. 2210-2212 ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

671

money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest,
whether the case falls under paragraph (a) or paragraph (b),
above, shall be 12% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an
equivalent to a forbearance of credit. (see Cristina Garments,
Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 104 SCAD 313, 304 SCRA 356 [1999];
Commonwealth Insurance Corp. vs. Court of Appeals, 421
SCRA 367 [2004].)
Art. 2214. In quasi-delicts, the contributory negligence of the plaintiff shall reduce the damages that
he may recover.
Art. 2215. In contracts, quasi-contracts, and
quasi-delicts, the court may equitably mitigate the
damages under circumstances other than the case
referred to in the preceding article, as in the following instances:
(1) That the plaintiff himself has contravened the
terms of the contract;
(2) That the plaintiff has derived some benefit as
a result of the contract;
(3) In cases where exemplary damages are to be
awarded, that the defendant acted upon the advice
of counsel;
(4) That the loss would have resulted in any
event;
(5) That since the filing of the action, the defendant has done his best to lessen the plaintiff’s loss
or injury.
Reduction of damages by the court.
(1) Contributory negligence in quasi-delicts. — Here, the court
has no discretion. It “shall’’ reduce the damages that the plaintiff
may recover. (see Art. 2179, Chap. 6, Part I.)
The contributory negligence referred to in this article is negligence of the plaintiff which merely contributes to his injured.

672

DAMAGES

Art. 2213

Where he contributes to the principal occurrence as one of its
determining factors, he cannot recover. Where, in conjunction
with the occurrence he contributes only to his own injury, he
may recover the amount that the defendant responsible for the
event should pay for such injury, less a sum deemed a suitable
equivalent for his own imprudence. (Rakes vs. Atlantic Gulf &
Pacific Co., 7 Phil. 359 [1906].)

(2) When warranted by the circumstances in contracts, quasicontracts, and quasi-delicts. — The court, in the exercise of its
sound discretion, “may’’ equitably mitigate the damages under
any of the instances enumerated in Article 2215, even in quasidelicts where the plaintiff is completely free of any fault or
negligence.
The enumeration in Article 2215 is not exclusive. This is evident from the use of the phrase “as in the following instances’’
in the provision. This means that the courts, in the exercise of
discretion, may mitigate the damages recoverable in other cases
when the circumstances of the case so warrant.
Doctrine of avoidable consequences distinguished
from doctrine contributory negligence.
The doctrine of avoidable consequences, or of the duty to minimize damages (see Art. 2203.) is to be distinguished from the
doctrine of contributory negligence.

The so-called “duty’’ to avoid consequences cannot arise until
a cause of action has accrued which will entitle the plaintiff
at least to nominal damages. The defense of the contributory
negligence of the plaintiff must be based upon the plaintiff’s
obligation or duty under the contract or its incidents. It must,
therefore, antedate or be concurrent with the latter. Failure on
the part of the plaintiff, after a breach, to use due care to prevent or diminish consequences which are avoidable in whole
or in part, is a matter of defense distinct from contributory
negligence. It affects the amount of damages, and the burden
of proof is upon the party alleging it.

Otherwise stated, if the act of the injured person does not operate
in causing the injury, but merely adds to the resulting damage,
its only effect is to prevent the recovery of those damages which

Art. 2213

ACTUAL OR COMPENSATORY DAMAGES

673

proper care would have averted. In such cases, the damages
should be apportioned and the defendant held liable only for
such as his negligence produced. (15 Am. Jur. 432.)

Considering, however, that both under ours and English law,
contributory negligence goes to the mitigation of recoverable
damages merely (except when it’s the proximate cause thereof),
and is not a complete bar to the action itself as in American
law, the above distinction does not appear to be a significant
one. But the doctrine of avoidable consequences as a distinct
defense from contributory negligence can be taken into account
in our jurisdiction towards the further reduction of the amount
of recoverable damages. (J. Cezar S. Sangco, Torts and Damages,
1984 Ed., pp. 797-798.)

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Article 2216. No proof of pecuniary loss is necessary in order that moral, nominal, temperate, liquidated or exemplary damages may be adjudicated.
The assessment of such damages, except liquidated
ones, is left to the discretion of the court, according
to the circumstances of each case.
Discretion of courts to award damages.
Under the old Civil Code, practically the only damages
allowed to be recovered are compensatory damages and those
agreed upon in a penal clause. Now, courts are vested with
discretion to award moral, nominal, temperate, and exemplary
damages, “according to the circumstances of each case.’’

With respect to liquidated damages, the courts have no
discretion to fix their amount. They cannot be awarded where
the parties did not stipulate on that kind of damages (Art.1
2226.), although, when agreed upon by the parties, they “shall
be equitably reduced if they are iniquitous or unconscionable.’’
(Art. 2227.)
Proof of pecuniary loss in the award
of damages.
(1) Compensatory damages are an adequate compensation
for such pecuniary loss suffered by a person which he has duly
proved. (Art. 2199.) They cannot be presumed.
Unless other indicated, refers to article in the Civil Code.

(2) No pecuniary proof is required in the award of moral,
nominal, temperate, liquidated, or exemplary damages. Nevertheless, it is essential that there should be a clear showing of
the facts giving rise to such damages.
Section 1. — Moral Damages
Art. 2217. Moral damages include physical
suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety,
besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral
shock, social humiliation, and similar injury. Though
incapable of pecuniary computation, moral damages
may be recovered if they are the proximate result of
the defendant’s wrongful act for omission.
Concept moral damages.
Moral damages are damages for pain and suffering, which
include physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety,
besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social
humiliation, and similar injury.

The injury for which recovery is allowed includes virtually
any form of conscious pain and suffering, as well as possible
future pain and suffering, whether mental, emotional, or physical,
so long as it can be deemed a proximate result of the defendant’s
wrongful act or omission. Thus, the act or omission must not
only be wrongful; it must be the proximate cause of the injury.
Rationale for moral damages.
The grant of moral damages is based on the ancient maxim
that “when there is a wrong there is a remedy.’’ (Yutuk vs.
Meralco, 2 SCRA 337 [1961]; Layda vs. Court of Appeals, 90
Phil. 724 [1952].)
Although moral damages were not expressly recognized in
the old Civil Code, “such damages have been allowed by the
Supreme Court of Spain, and some Spanish jurists believe that
moral damages are allowable.’’ Even our Supreme Court has
awarded moral damages in a number of cases under the old

Art. 2217

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

679

Civil Code.

The Code Commission states that:
“Denial of the award of moral damages has been predicated on the idea that physical suffering, mental anguish
and similar injury are incapable of pecuniary estimation.
But it is unquestionable that the loss or injury is just as
real as in other cases. The ends of justice are better served
by giving the judge discretion to adjudicate some definite
sum as moral damages. That is more equitable than that
the sufferer should be uncompensated.
The wrongdoer cannot complain because it was he who
caused the injury. In granting moral damages, the Project
proceeds upon the ancient maxim that when there is a wrong
there is a remedy.’’ (Report, p. 74.)

Nature and purpose of moral damages.
(1) Intended as they are to compensate the claimant for his
injury, moral damages are essentially indemnity or reparation,
not punitive or corrective in nature. They are awarded only to
enable the injured party to obtain means, diversion, or amusements that will serve to alleviate the moral suffering he has
undergone by reason of the defendant’s culpable action, and
are not intended to enrich the plaintiff at the expense of the
defendant. (Kierulf vs. Court of Appeals, 80 SCAD 380, 269
SCRA 433 [1997]; Zenith Insurance Corporation, 185 SCRA 308
[1990].)
(2) In other words, the award of moral damages is aimed
at restoration within the limits of the possible, of the spiritual
status quo ante, and, therefore, it must be proportional to and
in approximation of the suffering inflicted. (Visayan Sawmill
Company, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 219 SCRA 378 [1993]; Bank
of the Phil. Islands vs. Leobrera, 416 SCRA 15 [2003].) The intensity of the pain experienced by the relatives of the victim is
proportionate to the intensity of the affection for him and bears
no relation whether with the wealth or means of the offender.
The death caused by a beggar is felt by the parents of the victim
as intensely as that caused by the scion of a wealthy family.

Art. 2217

(Reyes, J.B.L., J., concurring and dissenting opinion, Panganiban
Transportation Co., Inc. vs. Legaspi,2 12 SCRA 592 [1964].)
Proof of moral damages.
(1) Factual basis of the damages. — Proof of pecuniary loss
is not required in the award of moral damages, the amount of
indemnity being left to the discretion of the court, as it is not
susceptible of pecuniary estimation. Nevertheless, it is essential
that the claimant satisfactorily proves the existence of the factual
basis of the moral damages by testifying on the witness stand
the mental and physical pain and suffering that he experienced.
(Art. 2217.)

This is so because moral damages, through incapable of
pecuniary estimation, are in the category of an award designed
to compensate the claimant for the actual injury suffered and
not to impose penalty on the wrongdoer. (Enervida vs. De La
Torre, 55 SCRA 339 [1930]; San Andres vs. Court of Appeals,
116 SCRA 81 [1990]; Robleza vs. Court of Appeals, 174 SCRA
354 [1989]; Ruagas vs. Traya, 22 SCRA 839 [1968]; Malonzo vs.
Galang, 109 Phil. 16 [1960]; Algarra vs. Sandejas, 27 Phil. 284
[1914].)
(2) Casual relation to the defendant’s acts. — Aside from proving that complainant has in fact experienced physical suffering
mental anguish, etc., it must further be shown that his moral

In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that if the financial capacity of a common
carrier (defendant) is such that it can pay a greater amount of indemnity as demanded
by the circumstances of the case, then it should be made to pay more than the minimum
amount of P3,000 (now P50,000) under Article 2206. Its financial standing in such case is
material. In Kierulf vs. Court of Appeals (80 SCAD 380, 269 SCRA 433 [1997].), the Supreme
Court held that “the social and financial standing of a claimant of moral damages may be
considered in awarding moral damages only if he or she was subjected to contemptuous
conduct despite the offender’s knowledge of his or her social and financial standing.’’ In at
least two cases, the social and financial standing of both the offender and offended parties
were considered as additional elements which should be taken into account in determining moral damages. While it is true that social dignity does not depend upon the wealth
or poverty of a person, the amount of damages necessary to repair the damages thereto
depends upon his own social and financial standing. The financial standing and means of
the offender may also be a convenient gauge for the determination of the injury caused.
(Domingding vs. Ng, 103 Phil. 111 [1958]; Layda vs. Court of Appeals, 90 Phil. 724 [1952];
see Philippine Airllines, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 417 SCRA 196 [2003].)

Art. 2217

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

681

damages were the proximate result of the defendant’s wrongful
act or omission the factual basis for which must be satisfactorily
established by the aggrieved party. (see Art. 2719, Chap. 6, Part
I.) In the absence of a wrongful act or omission, moral damages
cannot be awarded.

(3) Amount of the damages. — There is no hard and fact rule
in the determination of what would be a fair amount of moral
damages, since each case must be governed by its own peculiar
circumstances (Filinvest Credit Corp. vs. Intermediate Appellate
Court, 166 SCRA 155 [1988]; Ayala Integrated Steel Mfg. Co.,
Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 200 SCRA 111 [1991].) Damages are
not intended to enrich a plaintiff at the expense of the defendant. (Northwest Airlines vs. Laya, 382 SCRA 730 [2002].)

In any case, the moral damages should be reasonable and
should not be scandalously excessive as to indicate that the
amount fixed was the result of passion, prejudice, or corruption on the part of the trial court. They should not be out of
proportion to the injury suffered. Judicial discretion in fixing
the award should be exercised with a balanced restraint and
measured objectivity. In determining the amount of moral damages, the actual losses sustained by the aggrieved party and
the, gravity of the injuries must be considered. (Prudenciado
vs. Alliance Transport System, 148 SCRA 440 [1987]; Siguenza
vs. Quimbao, 137 SCRA 570 [1985]; R & B Surety and Insurance Co. vs. Uson, 129 SCRA 736 [1984]; Inhelder Corporation
vs. Panganiban, 122 SCRA 576 [1986]; Phil. National Bank vs.
Court of Appeals, 315 SCRA 272 [2003]; Mayo vs. People, 204
SCRA 642 [1991].)
(4) Rule in criminal cases. — In rape cases, moral damages
may be awarded to the victim in such amount as the court
deems just under the circumstances without need of alleging
or proving the basis thereof. (People vs. Moreno, 97 SCAD 814,
294 SCRA 728 [1998]; People vs. Bugayong, 101 SCAD 309, 299
SCRA 528 [1998]; People vs. Prades, 96 SCAD 815, 293 SCRA 411
[1998].) Case law requires automatic award of moral damages
to a rape victim without need of proof because from the nature
of the crime it can be assumed that she has suffered moral injuries entitling her to such award. Such award is separate and

682

DAMAGES

Art. 2217

distinct from civil indemnity, which case law also automatically,
awards upon proof of the commission of the crime by the offender. (People vs. Orilla, 422 SCRA 620 [2004].)
The conviction of the accused in seduction and acts of lasciviousness also suffices as a basis for an award of moral damages to the victim and her parents in the same criminal action,
without independent proof thereof. (People vs. Fontanilla, 23
SCRA 1227 [1968].)

In murder and homicide cases, the award of moral damages
should be substantiated by evidence. (People vs. Caballero, 400
SCRA 424 [2003]; People vs. Abolidor, 423 SCRA 260 [2004].)
Moral damages cannot be granted in the absence of proof (People vs. Catbagan, 423 SCRA 535 [2004].) that the heirs suffered
mental anguish and wounded feelings. (People vs. Malinao, 423
SCRA 34 [2004].) Thus, in a case, the award of moral damages
to the heirs of the murdered victim was deleted, there being
no evidence, testimonial or otherwise, presented to support it.
(People vs. Foncardas, 422 SCRA 356 [2004].)
In People vs. Perez (414 SCRA 106 [2003].), it was also ruled
that moral damages may not be awarded in the absence of proof
of mental and physical suffering on the part of the heirs of the
victim. However, in People vs. Bajar (414 SCRA 494 [2003].), the
Supreme Court said:

“In recent jurisprudence (People vs. De Los Santos, 403
SCRA 153 [2003].), we held that the award of moral damages
is mandatory in cases of murder and homicide, without need
of allegation and proof other than the death of the victim.
We, therefore, award moral damages in favor of Aquilio’s
heirs in the amount of P50,000.
We reiterate what we said in People vs. Panado (348 SCRA
679 [2003].):
‘Unlike in the crime of rape, we grant moral damages in
murder or homicide only when the heirs of the victim have
alleged and proved mental suffering. However, as borne out
by human nature and experience, a violent death invariably
and necessarily brings about emotional pain and anguish

Art. 2217

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

683

on the part of the victim’s family. It is inherently human to
suffer sorrow, torment, pain and anger when a loved one
becomes the victim of a violent or brutal killing. Such violent death or brutal killing not only steals from the family
of the deceased his precious life, deprives them forever of
his love, affection and support, but often leaves them with
the gnawing feeling that an injustice has been done to them.

For this reason, moral damages must be awarded even
in the absence of any allegation and proof of the heirs’
emotional suffering. Verily, Hilda, and her son Louie Gee
would forever carry the emotional wounds of the vicious
killing of a husband and a father. With or without proof,
this fact can never be denied; since it is undisputed, it must
be considered proved.’ ’’
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. The wedding cake ordered by the plaintiffs was not delivered
because the order slip got lost but defendant sent a letter of apology
accompanied with a P5,000 check, and called plaintiffs two weeks later
and apologized.
Facts: On November 19, 1992, Mrs. R. Lo and her daughter
A. Ferrer ordered a three-layered cake from F. Bakeshop to be
delivered at 5:00 o’clock in the afternoon at the Cebu Country
Club, stating clearly that the wedding is scheduled on December
4, 1992. Plaintiffs made a deposit and later, full payment on the
remaining balance.

At 6 o’clock in the evening, there was no wedding cake. At
7:00 o’clock, the plaintiff made a follow-up call to F. Bakeshop.
At 8:00 o’clock, they were informed that no wedding cake will be
delivered because the order slip got lost. The plaintiff got a poor
substitute to a wedding cake from the Club.
At 10:00 o’clock, the wedding cake arrived but the plaintiffs
declined to accept it, besides what was actually delivered was a
two-layered cake.
Subsequently, defendant F. Francisco sent her letter of apology accompanied with a P5,000 check, which was declined by the
plaintiffs because they felt it was inadequate.
Two weeks after the wedding, the defnedant called Mrs. Lo
and apologized.

The Court of Appeals modified the decision of the trial court.

Issues: (a) Whether the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the
trial courts award of moral damages and increasing the amount
from P30,000.00 to P250,000.00; and
(b) Whether the Court of Appeals was justified in awarding
in addition to moral damages, exemplary damages of P100,000.00.

Held: (1) Award of damages for breach of contract. — “Petitioners submit that the Court of Appeals and the trial court erred in
awarding moral damages in favor of respondents because moral
damages are recoverable in breach of contract cases only where
the breach was palpably wanton, reckless, malicious, in bad faith,
oppressive or abusive.

We agree. ‘To recover moral damages in an action for breach
of contract, the breach must be palpably wanton, reckless, malicious, in bad faith, oppressive or abusive.’3

‘Under the provisions of this law,4 in culpa contractual or
breach of contract, moral damages may be recovered when
the defendant acted in bad faith or was guilty of gross negligence (amounting to bad faith) or in wanton disregard of
his contractual obligation and, exceptionally, when the act
of breach of contract itself is constitute of tort resulting in
physical injuries.5
‘Moral damages may be awarded in breaches of contracts
where the defendant acted fraudulently or in bad faith.6

Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence,
it imports a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong, a breach of known duty through some
motive or interest or ill will that partakes of the nature of fraud.’’7
(2) Absence of fraud or bad faith. — “In this case, ‘[w]e find no
such fraud or bad faith.’8

‘The person claiming moral damages must prove the existence of bad faith by clear and convincing evidence for the law

suffered sleepless nights, mental anguish, serious anxiety as
the result of the actuation of the other party. Invariably such
action must be shown to have been willfully done in bad faith
or with ill motive.10 Mere allegations of besmirched reputation,
embarrassment and sleepless nights are insufficient to warrant an award for moral damages. It must be shown that the
proximate cause thereof was the unlawful act or omission of
the [private respondent] petitioners.’’11

(3) Conditions for award of moral damages. — “An award of
moral damages would require certain conditions to be met, to
wit: (1) first, there must be an injury, whether physical, mental or
psychological, clearly sustained by the claimant; (2) second, there
must be culpable act or omission factually established; (3) third,
the wrongful act or omission of the defendant is the proximate
cause of the injury sustained by the claimant; and (4) fourth, the
award of damages is predicated on any of the cases stated in
Article 2219 of the Civil Code.12
It must again be stressed that moral damages are emphatically
not intended to enrich a plaintiff at the expense of the defendant.13 ‘When awarded, moral damages must not be palpably and
scandalously excessive as to indicate that it was the result of passion, prejudice or corruption on the part of the trial court judge14
or appellate court justices.’’’

(4) Requirements for award of exemplary damages. — “The requirements of an award of exemplary damages are: (1) they may
be imposed by way of example in addition to compensatory
damages, and only after the claimant’s right to them has been
established; (2) that they can not be recovered as a matter of right,
their determination depending upon the amount of compensatory
damages that may be awarded to the claimant; (3) the act must
be accompanied by bad faith or done in a wanton, fraudulent,
oppressive or malevolent manner.’’15
(5) Liability for nominal damages. — “Nevertheless, the facts
show that when confronted with their failure to deliver on the
wedding day the wedding cake ordered and paid for, petitioners
gave the lame excuse that delivery was probably delayed because
of the traffic, when in truth, no cake could be delivered because
the order slip got lost. For such prevarication, petitioners must be
held liable for nominal damages for insensitivity, inadvertence or
inattention to their customer’s anxiety and need of the hour.
Nominal damages are ‘recoverable where a legal right is technically violated and must be vindicated against an invasion that
has produced no actual present loss of any kind or where there
has been a breach of contract and no substantial injury or actual
damages whatsoever have been or can be shown.16 Nominal damages may be awarded to plaintiff whose right has been violated
or invaded by the defendant, for the purpose of vindicating or
recognizing that right, not for indemnifying the plaintiff for any
loss suffered.17 (Francisco vs. Ferrer, Jr., 353 SCRA 261 [2001].)

Ben Velasquez, is a land grabber.” Machete informed respondent
of what petitioner said about him. This impelled respondent to
file a complaint for damages against petitioner, claiming that his
utterances besmirched his and his family’s reputation and caused
him anxiety, mental anguish and sleepless nights.
As no amicable settlement could be reached by the parties,
trial on the merits ensued. The trial court eventually ruled in favor of respondent on the basis of the sole testimony of Machete
and awarded to respondent moral damages in the amount of
P100,000 and exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000. No
other evidence was adduced by either party.

Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals alleging that the
trial court order lacked factual basis. The Court of Appeals, however, modified the award of the trial court by reducing the moral
damages from P100,000 to P50,000 and the exemplary damages
from P50,000 to P25,000.
Issue: The petitioner argues that the appellate court gravely
erred in: (a) affirming the trial court order despite the lack of sufficient factual basis and (b) awarding moral and exemplary damages to respondent despite his failure to take the witness stand.

Held: (1) Respondent should have testified on his moral suffering,
etc. — “In order that moral damages may be awarded, there must
be pleading and proof of moral suffering, mental anguish, fright
and the like. While respondent alleged in his complaint that he
suffered mental anguish, serious anxiety, wounded feelings and
moral shock, he failed to prove them during the trial.

Indeed, respondent should have taken the witness stand and
should have testified on the mental anguish, serious anxiety,
wounded feelings and other emotional and mental suffering he
purportedly suffered to sustain his claim for moral damages. Mere
allegations do not suffice; they must be substantiated by clear
and convincing proof. No other person could have proven such
damages except the respondent himself as they were extremely
personal to him.
In Keirulf vs. Court of Appeals (80 SCAD 380, 269 SCRA 433
[1997].), we held:

‘While no proof of pecuniary loss is necessary in order that
moral damages may be awarded, the amount of indemnity
being left to the discretion of the court, it is nevertheless essential that the claimant should satisfactorily show the existence
of the factual basis of damages and its causal connection to

688

DAMAGES

Art. 2217

defendant’s acts. This is so because moral damages, though
incapable of pecuniary estimation, are in the category of an
award designed to compensate the claimant for actual injury
suffered and not to impose a penalty on the wrongdoer.

In Francisco vs. GSIS, the Court held that there must be
clear testimony on the anguish and other forms of mental
suffering. Thus, if the plaintiff fails to take the witness stand
and testify as to his/her social humiliation, wounded feelings
and anxiety, moral damages cannot be awarded. In Cocoland
Development Corporation vs. National labor Relations Commission,
the Court held that ‘additional facts must be pleaded and
proven to warrant the grant of moral damages under the Civil
Code, these being, x x x social humiliation, wounded feelings,
grave anxiety, etc. that resulted therefrom.’

The testimony of Machete was not enough evidence of the
moral damages that the respondent supposedly suffered. Machete
may have clearly testified on the specific words uttered by petitioner against respondent but he could not have testified on the
wounded feelings respondent allegedly went through by reason
of petitioner’s slanderous remark. The award of moral damages
must be anchored to a clear showing that respondent actually
experienced mental anguish, besmirched reputation, sleepless
nights, wounded feelings or similar injury. There was no better
witness to this experience than respondent himself.
Since respondent failed to testify on the witness stand, the
trial court did not have any factual basis to award moral damages to him.’’

(2) Exemplary damages allowed only in addition to the moral damages. — “Neither is respondent entitled to exemplary damages. ‘If
the court has no proof or evidence upon which the claim for moral
damages could be based, such indemnity could not be outrightly
awarded. The same holds true with respect to the award of exemplary damages where it must be shown that the party acted in a
wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner.’ Furthermore, this specie
of damages is allowed only in addition to moral damages such
that no exemplary damages can be awarded unless the claimant
first establishes his clear right to moral damages.
The affirmance of the Court of Appeals of the ruling of the
trial court is therefore not in order as it lacked sufficient factual
basis.’’ (Mahinay vs. Velasquez, 419 SCRA 118 [2004].)

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES

Execution of award of moral and exemplary
damages.
The execution of any award for moral and exemplary damages is dependent on the outcome of the main case. Unlike
actual damages for which a party may clearly be held liable if,
for example, he breaches a specific contract and the amounts
of which are fixed and certain, liabilities for moral and exemplary damages as well as the exact amounts remain uncertain
and indefinite pending appeal. (Radio Communications of the
Phils., Inc. vs. Lantin, 134 SCRA 395 [1985].)
Stated otherwise, while an award for compensatory damages may be executed pending appeal, assuming the requisites
for the court’s valid exercise of its discretion to order execution
are present, an award for moral and exemplary damages can
not be executed until there is a final and executory judgment.
Cases where moral damages allowed.
(1) Where the defendants, in utter disregard of the rights
of the plaintiff, had refused deliberately and wantonly to pay
the plaintiff what his due to the latter. (Pan Pacific Co. vs. Phil.
Advertising Corp., 23 SCRA 977 [1968].)

(2) Where an unborn child was aborted by a doctor, on account of the moral anguish caused to the parents by the loss
of the foetus, and the disappointment of their parental expectations, in addition to exemplary damages if warranted by the
circumstances. (Geluz vs. Court of Appeals, 2 SCRA 801 [1961].)
(3) Where school authorities acted in bad faith in not enforcing a decision giving school honors to a deceased student.
(Ledesma vs. Court of Appeals, 160 SCRA 449 [1988].)

(5) Where electric service was unwarrantedly disconnected.
(Yutuk vs. Meralco, 2 SCRA 337 [1961].) Under the law, Meralco
may immediately disconnect electric service on the ground of
alleged meter tampering, but only if the discovering of the
cause is personally witnessed and attested to by an officer of
the law or by a duly authorized representative of the Energy
Regulatory Board (ERC). Article 2219 lists the instances when

690

DAMAGES

Art. 2217

moral damages may be recovered. One such case is when the
rights of an individual including the right against deprivation of
property without due process of law, are violated. (Quisumbing
vs. Manila Electric Co., 380 SCRA 195 [2002].)
(6) Where a person’s house was used as an advertisement
material without his consent and no appropriate apology was
made, in addition to actual damages. (St. Louis Realty Corp.
vs. Court of Appeals, 133 SCRA 179 [1984].)

(7) Where a municipal mayor vetoed in bad faith a resolution appropriating funds for the salary of the vice-mayor, in
addition to exemplary damages and attorney’s fees. (Pilar vs.
Sangguniang Bayan, 128 SCRA 173 [1984].)

(8) An action for breach of promise to marry has no standing in
the civil law, apart from the right to recover money or property
advanced upon the faith of such promise. (De Jesus vs. Syquia,
58 Phil. 866 [1933].) No moral damages can be recovered for
actions for breach of promise to marry. (Hermosisima vs. Court
of Appeals, 109 Phil. 629 [1960].) It has been held, however, that
moral damages are recoverable where a woman, by reason of a
breach of promise to marry by a man, suffers mental anguish,
besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock and
social humiliation. (Layda vs. Court of Appeals, 90 Phil. 724
[1952]; Wassmer vs. Velez, 12 SCRA 648 [1964].)

(9) Where the plaintiffs bought from the defendants two lots
which had been previously sold by the defendants to another,
in addition to return of downpayment, exemplary damages,
and attorney’s fees. (Siquenza vs. Court of Appeals, 137 SCRA
570 [1985].)
(10) Where share tenants were denied irrigation water for
their farm lots in order to make them vacate their landholdings,
in addition to exemplary damages and attorney’s fees. (Magbanua vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 137 SCRA 328 [1985].)
(11) Where petitioner company failed to send a cable to the
relatives of the deceased residing in the U.S. as a result of which
they were not able to attend the funeral, the court rejecting
the defense that “technical and atmospheric factors beyond its
control’’ prevented the sending of the message, in addition to

compensatory and exemplary damages. (Telefact Communications [Phil.] Wireless, Inc. vs. Castro, 158 SCRA 445 [1988].)

(12) Where a credit card holder suffered humiliation and
embarrassment because he was forced to surrender his credit
card at a department store in Seattle (USA), although petitioner
company, in ordering the immediate seizure of the credit card
did not act in bad faith. (American Express International Inc.
vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 167 SCRA 209 [1988].)
(13) Where the moral damages suffered by the private respondent were the proximate result of the wrongful refusal of
the petitioner, a public officer, to perform an official duty, or
neglect in the performance thereof. (Vital-Gozon vs. Court of
Appeals, 95 SCAD 704, 292 SCRA 124 [1998].)
Cases where moral damages not allowed.
(1) Where a city mayor was ordered to pay in his private
capacity the back salaries of two (2) illegally dismissed policeman, but he was not made to pay moral damages because they
were included already in the back salaries. (Diaz vs. Amante,
104 Phil. 968 [1958]; Cariño vs. ACCFA, 124 SCRA 782 [1983].)
(2) Where the lawful wife sued her husband’s common-law
wife to enjoin the latter from using her husband’s surname,
but the said common-law wife acted in good faith since the
husband introduced her to other persons as his wife and she
did not know that her common-law mate was already married
to another. (Silva vs. Peralta, 2 SCRA 1025 [1961].)

(3) Where the claim for moral damages is based on the
mental suffering caused by the wife’s or husband’s sympathy
for the other’s suffering resulting from bodily injuries, for the
right of recovery is restricted to the person who has suffered the
bodily hurt, and there can be no recovery (by a member of a
family) for distress caused by sympathy for another’s suffering,
or for fright due to a wrong against a third person. (Strebel vs.
Figueras, 96 Phil. 321 [1954]; Araneta vs. Arreglado, 104 Phil.
529 [1958].); Soberano vs. Manila Electric Railroad, 17 SCRA 733

superior and without malice and in good faith detains a person suspected to have committed a crime. (Costosa vs. Schulte,
[C.A.] 50 O.G. 1171.)

(5) Where a complaint was filed against an other in good
faith due to an honest mistake in the appreciation of the applicable law and jurisprudence. (Laurel vs. Galvan, 20 SCRA
198 [1967]; see Phil. National Bank vs. Court of Appeals, 159
SCRA 433 [1988]; R & B Surety and Insurance Co., Intermediate
Appellate Court, 129 SCRA 736 [1984]; Grapilon vs. Municipal
Council, 2 SCRA 103 [1961]; National Rice and Corn Corp. vs.
Antonio, 2 SCRA 643 [1961].) The plaintiff may have erred but
error alone is not a ground for moral damages. (Filinvest Credit
Corp. vs. Mendez, 152 SCRA 593 [1987].)
(6) Where the action filed by the plaintiff was decided against
him, because the adverse result of an action does not per se make
the act wrongful for otherwise, it may amount to imposing a
penalty on the right to litigate. (Boysaw vs. Sarreal, 148 SCRA
635 [1987].) The expenses and annoyance of litigation form part
of the burden of living in a society which seeks to attain social
control through law. (Equitable Bank vs. Intermediate Appellate
Court, 133 SCRA 135 [1948]; Dioquino vs. Laureano, 33 SCRA 65
[1970].) If a case is filed in good faith, the worries and anxieties
the defendant may suffer do not constitute the mental anguish
for which the law allows recovery of moral damages. (Ramos
vs. Ramos, 61 SCRA 284 [1974].)
(7) Where a government employee who was dismissed but
later reinstated refused to return to work despite several calls
for that purpose. (Octot vs. Ybañez, 111 SCRA 79 [1982].)

(8) Where the claimant is the widow of a passenger who
fell from a speeding, overcrowded train, it appearing that the
passenger was guilty of contributory negligence. (Phil. National
Railway vs. Court of Appeals, 139 SCRA 87 [1985].)

(9) Where a mistake in issuing a check was rectified and
the payee of the check which was dishonored, was paid the
full amount thereof. (Manila Banking Corp. vs. Intermediate
Appellate Court, 131 SCRA 271 [1984].)

evidence of fraud, malice or bad faith on the part of the defendant carrier. (Mercado vs. Lira, 3 SCRA 124 [1961]; see Cariaga
vs. Laguna-Tayabas Bus Company, 110 Phil. 346 [1960].)
(11) Where in a case of illegal or arbitrary detention, there
is nothing in the record that shows that the victim or his family
suffered sleepless nights, serious anxiety or other similar injury.
(People vs. Deduyo, 414 SCRA 146 [2003].)

(12) Where the plaintiff failed to take the witness stand and
testify to her social humiliation, wounded feelings, anxiety, etc.
(Francisco vs. Government Service Insurance System, 7 SCRA
579 [1963].)
Art. 2218. In the adjudication of moral damages,
the sentimental value of property, real or personal,
may be considered.
Moral damages for loss of property.
Under ordinary circumstances, there can be no recovery
for mental anguish suffered in connection with an injury to
property. The reason for this is that mental suffering is not a
natural consequence of injury to property.
Where, however, the act of the offender is inspired by fraud,
malice or like motives, mental suffering is a proper element of
damages. (Arnaldo vs. Famous Dry Cleaners, [C.A.] 52 O.G.
282, cited in A.M. Tolentino, Commentaries and Jurisprudence
on the Civil Code, 1992 Ed., Vol. V, p. 657.) In such case, the
court in fixing the amount of moral damages, may consider the
sentimental value of the property real or personal, as authorized by Article 2218.
Art. 2219. Moral damages may be recovered in
the following and analogous cases:
(1) A criminal offense resulting in physical injuries;
(2) Quasi-delicts causing physical injuries;
(3) Seduction, abduction, rape, or other lascivious

acts;
(4) Adultery or concubinage;
(5) Illegal or arbitrary detention or arrest;
(6) Illegal search;
(7) Libel, slander or any other form of defamation;
(8) Malicious prosecution;
(9) Acts mentioned in Article 309;18
(10) Acts and actions referred to in Articles 21,
26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, and 35.
The parents of the female seduced, abducted,
raped, or abused, referred to in No. 3 of this article,
may also recover moral damages.
The spouse, descendants, ascendants, and brother
and sisters may bring the action mentioned in No. 9
of this article, in the order named.
Moral damages not generally recoverable.
(1) Situations when recoverable. — Generally, moral damages
cannot be awarded if the cases do not fall within Articles 2219
and 2220 which enumerate the situations when they are recoverable. In addition, Article 2219 provides that moral damages
may also be recovered in “analogous cases.’’

(2) Analogous cases. — “Analogous’’ means “bearing analogy or resemblance, correspond (to some others) or resembling
in certain aspects, as in form, proportion, relations, etc.’’ The
law does not intend that moral damages should be awarded in
all cases where the aggrieved party suffered mental anguish,
fright, moral anxiety, etc. arising out of an act or omission of
another, otherwise, there would not have been any reason for
the inclusion in the law of specific acts in Article 2219. (P.P.I.
vs. Plaza, [C.A.] 52 O.G. 6609, cited in A.M. Tolentino, supra.,

19
“A corporation may have a good reputation which, if besmirched may also be a
ground for the award of moral damages. The same cannot be considered under the facts
of this case, however, not only because it is admitted that herein appellant had already

Art. 2219

Moral Damages

p. 658.)

A like enumeration is made in cases of attorney’s fees. Note
that while Article 2208 allows attorney’s fees in case the civil action or proceeding against the plaintiff is unfounded, this ground
is not found in Article 2219 but this will fall under “analogous’’
case. It has been held, however, that a clearly unfounded civil
action is not an analogous case wherein moral damages may be
awarded. (Enervida vs. De Leon, 55 SCRA 339 [1974]; Malonzo
vs. Galang, 109 Phil. 16 [1960].)
(3) Quasi-delicts and crimes. — Article 2219 specifies “quasidelicts causing physical injuries’’ (No. 2.) as justifying moral
damages, thus implying that other quasi-delicts are excluded
(see Strebel vs. Figueras, 96 Phil. 321 [1954].) but moral damages
may be awarded for the special torts (Chap. 4.) referred to in
No. 10 — Arts. 21, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, and 35. (Ventanilla
vs. Centeno, 1 SCRA 215 [1961]; Mercado vs. Court of Appeals,
108 Phil. 414 [1960]; Malonzo vs. Galang, 100 Phil. 16 [1956].)
Moral damages may not also be recovered in crime, unless
it results in or causes physical injuries.

(4) Breach of contract of carriage. — (No. 1) Article 2219 does
not apply to a breach of contract of carriage where the passenger
suffers injuries. (Verzosa vs. Baylan, 107 Phil. 1010 [1960]; Fores
vs. Mercado, 105 Phil. 266 [1959]; see Art. 2220.) In Layda vs.
Court of Appeals (90 Phil. 724 [1952].), however, the owner of a
bus was ordered to pay P4,000 as moral damages to an injured
passenger. “In the determination of moral damages, the human
value and the dignity of man are the paramount considerations.’’
Moral damages are recoverable where it is proved that the
carrier or its employee is guilty of malice or bad faith.
Right of a juridical person to recover
moral damages.

As a general rule, a juridical person is not entitled to moral
damages but it may be awarded exemplary damages. Obviously,
a corporation, being an artificial person and having existence only
in legal contemplation, cannot experience physical sufferings,
mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety, wounded feelings, moral

696

DAMAGES

Art. 2219

shock or social humiliation which are basis of moral damages.
They can be experienced only by one having a nervous system;
a corporation has “no feelings, no emotions, no senses.’’

The statement in People vs. Manero (218 SCRA 85 [1993].)
and Mambulao Lumber Co. vs. Phil. National Bank19 (22 SCRA
359 [1968].) that a corporation may recover moral damages if
it “has a good reputation that is debased, resulting in social
humiliation,’’ is an obiter dictum. (ABS-CBN, Broadcasting Corp.
vs. Court of Appeals, 301 SCRA 572 [1999]; Development Bank
of the Phil. vs. Court of Appeals, 403 SCRA 460 [2003].)
Summary of rules for the award
of moral damages.
(1) Nature and purpose. — Moral damages are not punitive in
nature but are designed to compensate and alleviate in some way
the physical suffering, mental anguish, fright, serious anxiety,
besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social
humiliation, and similar injury unjustly caused to a person.
(2) Amount. — Although incapable of pecuniary computation,
moral damages, nevertheless, must somehow be proportional
to and in approximation of the suffering inflicted.

(3) Proximate result. — Such damages, to be recoverable,
must be the proximate result of a wrongful act or omission
the factual basis for which is satisfactorily established by the
aggrieved party.
(4) Conditions. — An award of moral damages would require
certain conditions to be met, to wit:

(a) There must be an injury, whether physical, mental
or psychological, clearly sustained by the claimant;
(b) There must be a culpable act or omission factually

ceased in its business operation at the time of the foreclosure sale of the chattels, but also
for the reason that whatever adverse effects of the foreclosure sale of the chattels could
have upon its reputation or business standing would undoubtedly be the same whether
the sale was conducted at Jose Panganiban, Camarines Norte, or in Manila which is the
place agreed upon by the parties in the mortgage contract.’’
20
Art. 1764. Damages in cases comprised in this Section [Common Carriers] shall be
awarded in accordance with Title XVIII of this Book, concerning Damages. Article 2206 shall
also apply to the death of a passenger caused by the breach of contract by a common carrier.

established;

(c) The wrongful act or omission of the defendant is the
proximate cause of the injury sustained by the claimant; and
(d) The award of damages is predicated on any of the
cases stated in Article 2219.

(5) Breach of contract. — Under the provisions of Article
2220, in culpa contractual or breach of contract, moral damages
may be recovered when the defendant acted in bad faith or
was guilty of gross negligence (amounting to bad faith) or in
wanton disregard of his contractual obligation and, exceptionally, when the act of breach of contract itself is constitutive of
tort resulting in physical injuries.
By special rule in Article 1764,20 in relation to Article 2206,
moral damages may also be awarded in case the death of a
passenger results from a breach of contract of carriage.

(6) Quasi-delict. — In culpa aquiliana, or quasi-delict, (a)
when an act or omission causes physical injuries, or (b) where
the defendant is guilty of intentional tort, moral damages may
aptly be recovered. This rule also applies, as aforestated, to
contracts when breached by tort.
(7) Crime or felony. — In culpa criminal, moral damages could
be lawfully due when the accused is found guilty of physical
injuries, lascivious acts, adultery or concubinage, illegal or
arbitrary detention, illegal arrest, illegal search, or defamation.
Malicious prosecution can also give rise to a claim for moral
damages.

(8) Analogous cases. — The term “analogous cases,” referred
to in Article 2219, following the ejusdem generis rule, must be
held similar to those expressly enumerated by the law. (Expertravel Tours, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 108 SCAD 68, 309 SCRA
141 [1999].)
(9) Controlling provisions. — Articles 2217-2220 are the con-

21
Art. 1170. Those who in the performance of their obligations are guilty of fraud,
negligence, or delay, and those who in any manner contravene the tenor thereof, are liaable
for damages. (1101.)
22
The law does not care or bother with trifles.

698

DAMAGES

Art. 2219

trolling provisions on moral damages. Being specific provisions,
they prevail over general provisions on moral damages like
Article 117021 which merely sets forth a general principle on
damages. (see Verzosa vs. Baytan, 107 Phil. 1010 [1960].)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. Two school teachers seek moral and exemplary damages against
a public school administrator who allegedly prevented them from discharging the regular duties of their position.

Facts: F. Mar and G. Ligan (respondents) were appointed teachers in the Bohol School of Arts and Trades. They filed an administrative complaint against G. Flordelis , the school administrator.
After hearing, Flordelis was exonerated and the complaint was
dismissed with the warning that a repetition of the act complained
of would be dealt with severely.
Sometimes in October, 1975, the city fiscal of Tagbilaran City
filed against Mar and Ligan and four other accused an information for perjury at the instance of Flordelis. After trial, the city
court in a decision dated November 28, 1975, convicted the six
accused of perjury. The accused appealed to the Court of Appeals
which reversed the judgment of conviction in the perjury case and
acquitted Mar and Ligan.

Mar and Ligan were not paid their salaries beginning December,
1975 although they had been holding classes. Flordelis suspended
them. Notwithstanding the judgment of acquittal in the perjury
case, Flordelis did not terminate the suspension of Mar and Ligan.
His version was that during the second semester of the school year,
1975-76, Mar and Ligan were no longer teaching because of their
refusal to accept their new assignments regarding “non-formal
education.’’ Since they did not work, their salaries were stopped.
On July 18, 1977, Mar and Ligan filed in the Court of First
Instance of Bohol an action for mandamus to compel Flordelis
to reinstate them with back salaries from December, 1975. They
prayed for moral and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees.
Issue: Are the respondents entitled to moral and exemplary
damages.

23
Art. 1306. The contracting parties may establish such stipulations, clauses, terms and
conditions as they may deem convenient, provided they are not contrary to law, morals,
good customs, public order, or public policy. (1255a)

Art. 2219

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

699

Held: No. (1) Case not covered by Articles 2219 and 2220. — “There
is no showing by the lower court and the Appellate Court and by
Mar and Ligan that this case falls within any of the cases enumerated in Articles 2219 and 2220. The same is true with respect to
the exemplary damages. No justification has been shown by the
appellees for the award of exemplary damages.’’

(2) Respondents entitled to attorney’s fees and litigation expenses.
— “But under Article 2208 of the Civil Code, Mar and Ligan are
entitled to attorney’s fees and litigation expenses for having been
compelled to litigate and incur expenses to secure relief against
their illegal suspension by Flordelis who acted in gross and evident
bad faith in refusing to reinstate them. It is just and equitable that
his estate should pay attorney’s fees and litigation expenses to
Mar and Ligan in the sum of P5,000 or P2,500 for each of them.’’
(Flordelis vs. Mar, 114 SCRA 41 [1982].)
Dissenting:

Respondents were victims of harassment and vendetta. — “Clearly,
Mar and Ligan were the victims of harassment and vendetta perpetrated by a vinctictive superior contrary to morals and good
customs. There is no doubt that they suffered mental anguish,
fright, serious anxiety, wounded feelings, moral shock, and social humiliation because a petty school official had delusions of
grandeur and omnipotence.

Because Mar and Ligan had filed an administrative complaint
against Flordelis for which he was exonerated but nonetheless
warned that a repretition of the act complained of would be dealth
with severely, he vented his spleen against them thus:
Sometimes in October, 1875, the city fiscal of Tagbilaran
City filed against Mar and Ligan and four other accused as
information for perjury at the instance of Flordelis. After
trial, the city court in a decision dated November 28, 1975,
convicted the six accused of perjury. The accused appealed to
the Court of Appeals which, in a decision dated October 4,
1977, reversed the judgment of conviction in the perjury case
and acquitted Mar and Ligan.

Mar and Ligan were not paid their salaries beginning December, 1975 although they had been holding classes. Flordelis
suspended them. He ordered the security guards to prevent
Mar and Ligan from entering the school premises. On March
22, 1977, the lawyer of Mar and Ligan made a formal demand

700

DAMAGES

Art. 2219

upon Flordelis to reinstate the two teachers to their positions
with the warning that the proper legal action would be filed
if the demand was not heeded.

Notwithstanding the judgment of acquittal in the perjury
case, Flordelis did not terminate the suspension of Mar and Ligan. x x x

He filed against Mar and Ligan an administrative complaint
for abandonment of office, malversation, insubordination, etc. and
continued their suspension from office. The Secretary of Education
and Culture in a decision dated January 18, 1978 directed that
Mar and Ligan, together with a certain Emilio Dominguez, also
a teacher in the Bohol School of Arts and Trades, whom Flordelis
had suspended, should be reinstated, given their subject loads and
paid their back salaries.
When Dominquez asked the Secretary of Education and Culture that he be reinstated as a teacher of the Bohol School of Arts
and Trades, it was inevitable that the Secretary in going over his
papers would notice also the cases of Mar and Ligan which were
interwoven with Dominguez’s case.
In granting the request of Dominguez for reinstatement, the
Secretary had perforce to rule that Mar and Ligan were similarly
entitled to reinstatement. So, in his decision of January 18, 1978,
he not only resolved the request for reinstatement of Dominguez
but also that of Mar and Ligan.

The Secretary found ‘the actuations of Mr. Flordelis to be
highly irregular, unlawful, unjust and revolting to clear conscience,
because without an administrative case he relieved Dominguez,
Mar and Ligan of their teaching loads and denied the payment
of their salaries, which actions were tantamount to suspension.
The Secretary observed that as a mere school administrator
Flordelis was not clothed with the authority to suspend his subordinates and that he could not deprive them of their teaching
loads and suspend the payment of their salaries. The Secretary
held that Dominguez, Mar and Ligan should be given their regular
teaching assignments and paid their back salaries.
I cannot conceive of a case which better illustrates the application of Art. 21 of the Civil Code.’’ (Abad Santos, J.)

A customer claims moral and exemplary damages due to the

Art. 2219

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

701

negligence of a waiter, by reason of which the tray containing drinks
was overturned and fell on her.

Facts: The spouses Lelisa Seña and Arturo Seña and their
four children went to the Tropical Palace Hotel, Parañaque, Metro
Manila in the evening of December 20, 1976 to see the Reycard
Duet Show. They occupied a table and ordered drinks before the
show started.
Lelisa’s version was that when a waiter named Baez was going
to serve them, the tray containing the drinks was overturned and
fell on her. She was drenched. Later, she felt some chill. The drinks
and the splinters from the broken glasses allegedly destroyed her
dress which, with her handbag and shoes, cost P1,000.00.

A waitress took Lelisa to the ladies’s room. She had to remove
her dress and underwear which were wet. She was not given
any towel to cover herself. She remained standing as there was
no chair. Two of her daughters followed her to the ladies’ room.
She returned to the hall after about 30 minutes later when the
show had started.
Lelisa testified that she was claiming moral damages of
P100,000 for herself and her husband due to embarrassment and
the fact that the management did not even offer any apology on
that night. She was claiming exemplary damages in the same
amount to teach the management a lesson. There was no apology
from the management.

The food and beverage manager testified that he apologized to
the plaintiffs in behalf of the management for the inconvenience
caused to them, meaning that the management was sorry for what
happened to Mrs. Seña.
The Señas sued the corporation, as employer of the waiter.
The corporation in its answer alleged that it came to know of the
incident only when it was served with summons. Had the incident
been brought to its attention on that same night, it would have
apologized immediately to the plaintiffs, made appropriate amends
and taken steps to discipline the waiter and his supervisor. In fact,
in its answer it apologized to the plaintiffs. It labeled the incident
as a fortuitous event. It alleged that it observed diligentissimi patrisfamilias to prevent the damage. It reiterated that it was sorry for
what had happened. It manifested its desire to make the proper
amends in any reasonable manner or form.
Issue: Is the grant by the trial court of moral and exemplary
damages legally justified?

702

DAMAGES

Art. 2219

Held: No. (1) Case not covered by Article 2219. — “The instant
case is not specifically mentioned in Article 2219 which refers to
quasi-delict physical injuries. The Appellate Court erred in considering it as analogous to the cases mentioned therein without
indicating what specific case the instant case resembles or is analogous to. For example, an unfounded complaint with a baseless
imputation of forgery is analogous to defamation mentioned in
Article 2219(7). It justified an award of P2,000 as moral damages
(Justiva vs. Gustio, 117 Phil. 71).
Generally, there can be no recovery of moral damages if the
case is not mentioned in Articles 2219 and 2220.’’

(2) Damages for mental anguish. — “What we call moral damages are treated in American jurisprudence as compensatory damages
awarded for mental pain and suffering or mental anguish resulting
from a wrong. (25 C.J.S. 815.) Mental suffering means distress or
serious pain as distinguished from annoyance, regret or vexation.
Mental anguish is intense mental suffering.
Generally, damages for mental anguish are limited to cases in
which there has been a personal injury or where the defendant
willfully, wantonly, recklessly, or intentionally caused the mental
anguish. (22 Am Jur 2nd 275). ‘Nor will damages generally be
awarded for mental anguish which is not accompanied by a physical injury, at least where maliciousness, wantonness, or intentional
conduct is not involved.’ (22 Am. Jur 2nd 276.)

Damages for mental anguish and suffering have been held
recoverable where the act complained of was done with such
gross carelessness or recklessness as to show an utter indifference
to the consequences. (25 C.J.S. 820.)’’
(3) Embarrassment of complainant not the mental anguish contemplated. — “We hold that the ‘embarrassment’ to which Mrs. Seña
was exposed by the incident is not the mental anguish contemplated in Article 2217 for which moral damages can be recovered.

Parenthetically, the case of People vs. Plaza, CA 52 O.G. 6609,
6612, a case decided by Justice Sanchez, may be cited. In that case,
Genoveva de Soriano was a passenger in a riverboat which was
bumped by another boat manned by Berchman Plaza and caused
the first boat to capsize and sink but did not drown Genoveva.
She did not know how to swim. Her life was endangered. She
suffered fright and mental anguish during those moments when
her fate was uncertain. Her claim for P500 as moral damages was
not allowed.

In this case, it would not be just and proper to include moral
damage in the corporation’s vicarious liability as employer. The
award of P5,000 as exemplary or corrective damages cannot also
be sustained because there was no gross negligence in this case.’’

3. A bank levied on the property of the respondent, wrongly assuming that the respondent was the same judgment debtor in a civil
case in which the bank was the judgment creditor.
Facts: For failure of ZD Corp. to pay its loan, with VR and
spouses Teofilo Ramos, Sr. and Amelita Ramos as sureties, petitioner UCPB filed a complaint (Civil Case No. 16453) for collection
against them. The decision rendered in favor of the petitioner
became final and executory and a writ of execution was issued by
the trial court. To help the sheriff implement the writ, an officer
(lawyer) of the petitioner requested an appraiser of the petitioner
to ascertain if the defendants had any leviable real and personal
property.

In the course of the investigation, the appraiser found a parcel
of land covered by TCT No. 275167 under the name of respondent
Teofilo C. Ramos, President and chairman of the board of director
of R Corp., and married to Rebecca F. Ramos. When appraised by
the petitioner of the appraiser’s report, the sheriff a prepared a
notice of levy in Civil Case No. 16453 and caused the annotation
of thereof by the Register of Deeds on said title.
Meanwhile R Corp. applied a loan with UCPB using the
same property as collateral therefor. R Corp. intended to use the
proceeds of the loan as additional capital as it need to participate
in a bidding project of San Miguel Corp. In view of the annotation of the notice of levy, the bank held in abeyance any action
on the loan application.

The respondent was shocked by the information. He was not a
party in the said case; neither was he aware that his property had
been levied by the sheriff in the said case. His blood temperature
rose so much that immediately after the meeting, he proceeded
to his doctor who gave the respondent the usual treatment and
medication for cardio-vascular and hypertension problems.

Subsequently, after it was verified that the respondent was
not the same Teofilo Ramos, Sr., the defendant in civil case No.

704

DAMAGES

Art. 2219

16453, the petitioner approved the credit line application of R
Corp. However, the respondent was concerned because when the
proceeds of the loan were released, the bidding period for the San
Miguel Corporation project had already elapsed. As business did
not go well, R Corporation found it difficult to pay the loan. It
thus applied for an additional loan with the UCPB which was,
however, denied. The corporation then applied for a loan with the
Planters Development Bank (PDB), the proceeds of which would
be used to pay its account to the UCPB. The respondent offered
to use his property covered by TCT No. 275167 as collateral for
its loan. PDB agreed to pay off the outstanding loan obligation
of R Corporation with UCPB on the condition that the mortgage
with the latter would be released. UCPB agreed.
Pending negotiations with UCPB, the respondent discovered
that the notice of levy annotated on TCT No. 275167 at the instance
of the petitioner had not yet been cancelled. When apprised thereof,
PDB withheld the release of the loan pending the cancellation of
the notice of levy. The account of R Corporation with UCPB thus
remained outstanding. The monthly amortization on its loan from
UCPB became due and remained unpaid. When the respondent
went to the petitioner for the cancellation of the notice of levy
annotated on his title, the petitioner’s counsel suggested to the
respondent that he file a motion to cancel the levy on execution
to enable the court to resolve the issue. The petitioner assured the
respondent that the motion would not be opposed.
Despite the cancellation of the notice of levy, the respondent filed a complaint for damages against the petitioner and the
sheriff, alleging that, without any legal basis, the petitioner and
the sheriff caused.

The trial court rendered a decision in favor of the respondent
ordering the petitioner to pay the following: P800,000 as moral
damages; P100,000 as exemplary damages, P100,000 as attorney’s
fees, and costs of the suit. The complaint against the sheriff was
dismissed on the ground that he was merely performing his duties.
The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals which
ruled that the petitioner was negligent.
Issues: They are the following:

(a) Whether or not the petitioner acted negligently in causing
the annotation of the levy on the title of the respondent.
(b) If so, whether or not the respondent was the real partyin-interest as plaintiff to file an action for damages against the

Art. 2219

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

705

plaintiff considering that the loan applicant with UCPB and PDB
was R Corporation.

(c) If so, whether or not the respondent is entitled to moral
damages, exemplary damages and attorney’s fees.

Held: (1) Petitioner acted negligently when it caused the annotation
of the levy. — “It bears stressing that the petitioner is a banking
corporation, a financial institution with power to issue its promissory notes intended to circulate as money (known as bank notes);
or to receive the money of others n general deposit, to form a
joint fund that shall be used by the institution for its own benefit,
for one or more of the purposes of making temporary loans and
discounts, of dealing in notes, foreign and domestic bills of exchange, coin bullion, credits, and the remission of money; or with
both these powers, and with the privileges, in addition to these
basic powers, of receiving special deposits, and making collection
for the holders of negotiable paper, if the institution sees fit to
engage in such business.
In funding these businesses, the bank invests the money that
it holds in trust of its depositors. For this reason, we have held
that the business of a bank is one affected with public interest,
for which reason the bank should guard against loss due to negligence or bad faith.

In approving the loan of an applicant, the bank concerns itself
with proper informations regarding its debtors. The petitioner, as
a bank and a financial institution engaged in the grant of loans,
is expected to ascertain and verify the identities of the persons
it transacts business with. In this case, the petitioner knew that
the sureties to the loan granted to ZDC and the defendants in
Civil Case No. 94-1822 were the Spouses Teofilo Ramos, Sr. and
Amelita Ramos were specified in the writ of execution issued by
the trial court.’’

(2) Petitioner had knowledge that the property was owned by respondent and his wife Rebecca Ramos. — “The petitioner, with Atty.
Bordalba as the Chief of LED and handling lawyer of Civil Case
No. 16453, in coordination with the sheriff, caused the annotation
of notice of levy in the respondent’s title despite its knowledge
that the property was owned by the respondent and his wife
Rebecca Ramos, who were not privies to the loan availment of
ZDC nor parties-defendants in Civil Case No. 16453. Even when
the respondent informed the petitioner, through counsel, that the
property levied by the sheriff was owned by the respondent, the

706

DAMAGES

Art. 2219

petitioner failed to have the annotation cancelled by the Register
of Deeds.’’

(3) Petitioner failed to act with reasonable care and caution. — “In
determining whether or not the petitioner acted negligently, the
constant test is: ‘Did the defendant in doing the negligent act
use that reasonable care and caution which an ordinarily prudent
person would have used in the same situation? If not, then he is
guilty of negligence.’ Considering the testimonial and documentary
evidence on record, we are convinced that the petitioner failed
to act with the reasonable care and caution which an ordinarily
prudent person would have used in the same situation.
The petitioner has access to more facilities in confirming the
identity of their judgment debtors. It should have acted more cautiously, especially since some uncertainty had been reported by the
appraiser whom the petitioner had tasked to make verifications.
It appears that the petitioner treated the uncertainty raised by
appraiser Eduardo C. Reniva as a flimsy matter. It placed more
importance on the information regarding the marketability and
market value of the property, utterly disregarding the identity of
the registered owner thereof.’’

(4) A middle name is very important or even decisive in a case.
— “It should not be amiss to note that the judgment debtor’s
name was Teofilo Ramos, Sr. We note, as the Supreme Court of
Washington in 1909 had, that a legal name consists of one given
name and one surname or family name, and a mistake in a middle
name is not regarded as of consequence. However, since the use of
initials, instead of a given name, before a surname, has become a
practice, the necessity that these initials be all given and correctly
given in court proceedings has become of importance in every
case, and in many, absolutely essential to a correct designation
of the person intended.
A middle name is very important or even decisive in a case
in which the issue is as between two persons who have the same
first name and surname, did the act complained of, or is injured
or sued or the like.’’

(5) Petitioner’s negligence, the proximate cause respondent’s damages. — “In this case, the name of the judgment debtor in Civil
Code No. 16453 was Teofilo Ramos, Sr., as appearing in the judgment of the court and in the writ of execution issued by the trial
court. The name of the owner of the property covered by TCT
No. 275167 was Teofilo C. Ramos. It behooved the petitioner to
ascertain whether the defendant Teofilo Ramos, Sr. in Civil Case

Art. 2219

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

707

No. 16453 was the same person who appeared as the owner of
the property covered by the said title. If the petitioner had done
so, it would have surely discovered that the respondent was not
the surety and the judgment debtor in Civil Case No. 16453. The
petitioner failed to do so, and merely assumed that the respondent and the judgment debtor Teofilo Ramos, Sr. were one and the
same person.

In sum, we find that the petitioner acted negligently in causing
the annotation of notice of levy in the title of the herein respondent,
and that its negligence was the proximate cause of the damages
sustained by the respondent.’’
(6) Respondent is real party-in-interest to file action for damages.
— “On the second issue, the petitioner insists that the respondent is not the real party-in-interest to file the action for damages,
as he was not the one who applied for a loan from UCPB and
PDB but Ramdustrial Corporation of which he was merely the
President and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
We do not agree. The respondent very clearly stated in his
complaint that as a result of the unlawful levy by the petitioner
of his property, he suffered sleepless nights, moral shock, and
almost a heart attack due to high blood pressure.

It must be underscored that the registered owner of the
property which was unlawfully levied by the petitioner is the
respondent. As owner of the property, the respondent has the right
to enjoy, encumber and dispose of his property without other limitations than those established by law. The owner also has a right
of action against the holder and possessor of the thing in order to
recover it. Necessarily, upon the annotation of the notice of levy
on the TCT, his right to use, encumber and dispose of his property
was diminished, if not negated. He could no longer mortgage the
same or use it as collateral for a loan.
Arising from his right of ownership over the said property is
a cause of action against persons or parties who have disturbed
his rights as an owner. As an owner, he is one who would be
benefited or injured by the judgment, or who is entitled to the
avails of the suit for an action for damages against one who disturbed his right of ownership.
Hence, regardless of the fact that the respondent was not the
loan applicant with the UCPB and PDB, as the registered owner
of the property whose ownership had been unlawfully disturbed
and limited by the unlawful annotation of notice of levy on his
TCT, the respondent had the legal standing to file the said action

708

DAMAGES

Art. 2219

for damages. In both instances, the respondent’s property was used
as collateral of the loans applied for by Ramdustrial Corporation.
Moreover, the respondent, together with his wife, was a surety
of the aforesaid loans.
While it is true that the loss of business opportunities cannot be used as a reason for an action for damages arising from
loss of business opportunities caused by the negligent act of the
petitioner, the respondent, as a registered owner whose right of
ownership had been disturbed and limited, clearly has the legal
personality and cause of action to file an action for damages. Not
even the respondent’s failure to have the annotation cancelled
immediately after he came to know of the said wrongful levy
negates his cause of action.’’
(7) Requisites for award of moral damages. — “On the third
issue, for the award of moral damages to be granted, the following must exist: (1) there must be an injury clearly sustained by
the claimant, whether physical, mental or psychological; (2) there
must be a culpable act or omission factually established; (3) the
wrongful act or omission of the defendant is the proximate cause
of the injury sustained by the claimant; and (4) the award for
damages is predicated on any of the cases stated on Article 2219
of the Civil Code.’’
(8) All requisites present. — “In the case at bar, although the
respondent was not the loan applicant and the business opportunities lost were those of Ramdustrial Corporation, all four requisites
were established. First, the respondent sustained injuries in that
his physical health and cardio-vascular ailment were aggravated;
his fear that his one and only property would be foreclosed,
hounded him endlessly; and his reputation as mortgagor had
been tarnished. Second, the annotation of notice of levy on the
TCT of the private respondent was wrongful, arising as it did
from the petitioner’s negligent act of allowing the levy without
verifying the identity of its judgment debtor. Third, such wrongful
levy was the proximate cause of the respondent’s misery. Fourth,
the award for damages is predicated on Article 2219 of the Civil
Code, particularly, number 10 thereof.’’

(9) Award of exemplary damages. — “Although the respondent
was able to establish the petitioner’s negligence, we cannot, however, allow the award for exemplary damages, absent the private
respondent’s failure to show that the petitioner acted with malice
and bad faith. It is a requisite in the grant of exemplary damages

Art. 2219

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

709

that the act of the offender must be accompanied by bad faith or
done in wanton, fraudulent or malevolent manner.’’

(10) Award of attorney’s fees. — “Attorney’s fees may be
awarded when a party is compelled to litigate or to incur expenses
to protect his interest by reason of an unjustified act of the other
party. In this case, the respondent was compelled to engage the
services of counsel and to incur expenses of litigation in order to
protect his interest to the subject property against the petitioner’s
unlawful levy. The award is reasonable in view of the time it has
taken this case to be resolved.’’

(11) Liability of petitioner. — “In sum, we rule that the petitioner acted negligently in levying the property of the respondent
despite doubts as to the identity of the respondent vis-à-vis its
judgment debtor. By reason of such negligent act, a wrongful levy
was made, causing physical, mental and psychological injuries on
the person of the respondent. Such injuries entitle the respondent
to an award of moral damages in the amount of P800,000.
No exemplary damages can be awarded because the petitioner’s negligent act was not tainted with malice and bad faith.
By reason of such wrongful levy, the respondent had to hire the
services of counsel to cause the cancellation of the annotation;
hence the award of attorney’s fees.’’ (United Coconut Planters Bank
vs. Ramos, 415 SCRA 596 [2003].)

4. Plaintiffs-appellees sued for damages for wrongful attachment,
the main case filed by them having been dismissed on purely technical
grounds.

Facts: Certain properties of F. Lazatin (FL), plaintiff-appellant,
were levied upon and sold at public auction, wherein A. Twaño
(AT) and another, defendants-appellees, were the purchasers. Before
the expiration of the redemption period, FL deposited with the
sheriff the redemption price in the sum of P13,849.88.

Subsequently, FL (who later died) filed an action to recover
from the defendants, the sum of P19,676.09, supposedly a balance of the proceeds of auto-trucks, sold directly to purchasers
by said defendants. On the same date, FL, alleging that “there is
no security whatsoever for the payment of the amount claimed in
the complaint and that the defendants are moving or are about to
remove or dispose of their property with intent to defraud their
creditors, particularly the plaintiff”, secured a writ of attachment
in the amount he deposited, and pursuant thereto, the sheriff

710

DAMAGES

Art. 2219

refused to deliver the sum of P13,849.88 which should have been
paid to the defendants.

In their answer, defendants averred that the plaintiff has filed
a clearly unfounded civil action against the herein defendants as
a result of which the latter had suffered actual or compensatory
damages by way of attorney’s fees in the sum of P3,000.00, and
moral damages in the amount of P10,000.00, and that the wrongful attachment against the properties and the sum of P13,849.88
had caused actual damages to the defendants, represented by the
legal interest on such amount.

On October 28, 1955, the trial court rendered judgment ordering the estate of FL to pay the defendants P3,000.00 as attorney’s
fees, P2,500 as moral damages, and 6% interest on the amount
of P13,849.88 from August 6, 1952 until said amount is fully paid
and the costs of the suit.
Issue: Did the trial court err in awarding actual and moral
damages to defendants?

Held: (1) Right to recover moral damages for wrongful attachment.
— “Article 2197 mentions the kind of damages recoverable, among
which are (1) actual or compensatory and (2) moral. Article 2219
provides that moral damages may be recovered in the following
and analogous cases . . . (3) malicious prosecution. There is an
abundance of cases holding that the action to recover damages
from the attachment plaintiff, for the wrongful issuance and levy
of an attachment (malicious attachment) is identical or is analogous
to the ordinary action for malicious prosecution. It may logically
be inferred, therefore, that in order that moral damages may be
recovered in connection with the writ of attachment under consideration, malice is an essential ingredient thereof.
In Songco vs. Sellner, 37 Phil. 254 [1917], where the evidence
showed that defendant suffered damages to his credit, as a result
of a writ of attachment wrongfully issued, the Court declared that
such damages were remote and speculative and that there was no
finding that the attachment was maliciously sued out.
In Aboitiz vs. Da Silva, 45 Phil. 883 [1924], the Court refused
to grant damages for loss of reputation by reason of an improper
attachment, on the ground that there was no evidence from which
malice on the part of the plaintiff or loss of credit to the defendant, may be inferred or presumed.
In Masterson vs. Smith Navigation, 60 Phil. 366 [1914], damages
to good name, allegedly suffered by the defendant as a result of

Art. 2219

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

711

a writ of attachment wrongfully issued, were disallowed on the
ground that such damages were very problematical.’’

(2) Where there is no malice. — “In American jurisdictions, where
the principles of the general laws on damages in common law
(adopted by Art. 2198), are in force, only actual or compensatory
damages are recoverable for wrongful but not malicious attachment.
An allowance may be made for injury to feeling if the attachment
was sued out maliciously and without probable cause; but in the
absence of this element there can be no recovery. (6 C.J., 533- 534;
541).’ The authorities are quite uniform in holding that, in the absence
of malice, injuries to credit, reputation and business, are too remote
and speculative to be recovered.’ (Union Nat. Bank vs. Cross, 100
Wis. 174, 75 NW 992).
Where there is no issue of malice, damages must be compensatory merely, and confined to the actual loss from deprivation of
the property attached or injury to it, or in case of closing business, to the probable profits of the business, during the time of
its stoppage (Holiday Bros. vs. Cohen 34 Ark. 707). All of which
go to show that the attachment defendant is not entitled to moral
damages, unless it is alleged and established that the writ was
maliciously sued out.’’
(3) Principles of the general law on damages. — “The defendantsappellees invoke the following rule, in support of their thesis.
‘SEC. 4. Bond required from plaintiff. — The party applying for the
order must give a bond executed to the defendant in an amount
to be fixed by the judge not exceeding the plaintiff’s claim, that
the plaintiff will pay all the costs which may be adjudged to the
defendant and all damages which he may sustain by reason of
the attachment, if the court shall finally adjudge that the plaintiff
was not entitled thereto.’ (Rule 59, R.C.)
They claim that under the above section, malice and want of
probable cause are not essential; that the language used therein is
clear and its intent and purpose are obvious; its provision cannot
be given a broader scope than what it imports; and the element
of malice cannot be implied from the terms thereof. It is finally
argued that as the attachment- plaintiff, according to the rule,
should pay ‘all the damages’ which the attachment defendant
might sustain by reason of the attachment, if the court shall finally
adjudge that the plaintiff was not entitled thereto, the ruling of
the trial court that the appellant should pay the appellees moral
damages, is correct.

712

DAMAGES

Art. 2219

We do not share this view. It should be observed that Sec. 4
of Rule 59 [now 57], does not prescribe the remedies available to
the attachment defendant in case of a wrongful attachment, but
merely provides an action for recovery upon the bond, based on
the undertaking therein made and not upon the liability arising
from a tortious act, like the malicious suing out of an attachment.
Under the first, where malice is not essential, the attachment defendant, is entitled to recover only the actual damages sustained
by him, by reason of the attachment. Under the second, where
the attachment is maliciously sued out, the damages recoverable
may include a compensation for every injury to his credit, business or feelings.

And considering the fact that the Rules of Court are of older
vintage than the new Civil Code, the matter of damages in the
said rules should he encompassed within the framework of the
Civil Code (Art. 2196 Civil Code). It is quite true that said section
4 employs the expression ‘all damages’, but this should be understood to refer to the damages resulting from the undertaking itself,
the recovery of which is subject to ‘the principles of the general
law on damages’, earlier discussed. (Art. 2198, Civil Code, supra)’’
(4) Defects of trial court’s decision. — “A cursory perusal of
the decision would show that the trial court did not make any
express ruling that the writ of attachment was maliciously sued
out by the plaintiff or any finding of facts or circumstances from
which it may be necessarily inferred that the attachment was
thus obtained. The decision does not make any finding that the
defendants-appellees did in fact suffer mental anguish or injury
to their credit or reputation. x x x
Moreover, the dissolution of the writ was due to a technicality. No moral damages can be inferred from the mere fact that
the redemption price to which defendants were entitled, had been
retained by the provincial sheriff for a period of 38 days.

While the lower court declared that the defendants-appellees
had an outstanding balance of P171,947.80 in the bank and that
they were not disposing their property in fraud of creditors or
of the plaintiff, as alleged in the petition for the issuance of the
writ, still the said court did not make any finding that the said
petition was maliciously sued out.’’
(5) Claims for attorney’s fees “in case of clearly unfounded civil
action.’’ — “Defendants’ counterclaim for the recovery of attorney’s
fees is based on paragraph 4 of the cited provision [Art. 2208],

Art. 2219

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

713

for legal services rendered in defending the main suit. There is
no showing in the decision appealed from that plaintiffs’ action
is ‘clearly unfounded’. Plaintiffs-appellants’ complaint was not
dismissed because the facts alleged therein were found untrue, but
on purely technical grounds: the special defenses of prescription
of the action and res adjudicata.
While it may be hard to believe that plaintiff had labored
under the impression that the matters involved in his complaint
had not been adjudicated in the previous litigation between the
same parties, because plaintiff himself was a lawyer, such error
of judgment on his part would not justify the inference that the
action was ‘clearly unfounded’.

As aptly observed by appellants’ counsel, defenses as the one
interposed by appellee in their counterclaim ‘raise questions of law
not always of obvious and easy solution’. While it may appear also
that the move was a scheme to prevent the defendants-appellees
from reaping the benefits of the final judgment rendered in their
favor still one cannot nullify, without cause, the good and honest
motive, which should be presumed, when a litigant goes to court
for the determination of his alleged right.’’
(6) Attorney’s fees awarded reasonable under the circumstances.
— “Withal, and considering the fact that defendants-appellees
were drawn into this litigation by plaintiff-appellant and were
compelled to hire an attorney to protect and defend them, and
taking into account the work done by said attorney, as reflected
in the record, throughout the proceedings, we deem it just and
equitable to award attorney’s fees for defendants-appellees. The
sum of P3,000.00 adjudicated by the trial court, is reasonable under
the circumstances (par. 11, Art. 2208, Civil Code).
It appears that plaintiffs-appellants have abandoned their appeal with respect to the payment of 6% interest in the amount of
P13,849.88.’’ (Lazatin vs. Twaño, 2 SCRA 842 [1961].)

Brief rulings under Article 2219.
(1) Where the complaint against a taxi-cab company is
predicated on alleged breach of contract of marriage, without
including the driver as a party defendant, moral damages cannot be recovered from the company for the one who committed
“the criminal offense resulting in physical injuries’’ is not the
company but the taxi-cab driver. (Cachero vs. Manila Yellow

714

DAMAGES

Art. 2219

Taxicab, 101 Phil. 523 [1957]; Peñalosa vs. Eastern Tayabas Bus
Co., [C.A.] 52 O.G. 8237.)

(2) Where the victim (in a frustrated murder case) sustained
nearly fatal wounds for which he was treated in for 18 days
at a hospital for such fact constituted the trauma of physical,
psychological, and moral sufferings on which the award of
moral damages under Article 2219(1) could be based without
the need for pleading or proof of the basis thereof as it is too
obvious to still require the victim to recount the same. (People
vs. Caraig, 400 SCRA 67 [2003].)

(3) The seduction contemplated in No. (3) of Article 2219 is
that punished in the Revised Penal Code. (Arts. 337, 338 thereof.)
(People vs. Fontanilla, 23 SCRA 1227 [1968].) Where a 36 years
old woman, 10 years younger than the man, “overwhelmed by
her love,’’ for him has sexual relations with him because she
“wanted to bind’’ him by “having a fruit of their engagement
even before they had benefit of clergy’’ there was no seduction.
(De Jesus vs. Syquia, 58 Phil. 866 [1933].)
(4) Where a married man, through acts of intimidation and
promise of marriage, had repeated carnal knowledge with her
servant, a 15-year old virgin. The conviction of the accused
suffices as a basis to adjudge him, in the same criminal case,
liable for an award of moral damages. (People vs. Fontanilla,
23 SCRA 1227 [1968].)

(5) The conviction of the accused in cases of seduction,
rape, or acts of lasciviousness suffices as a basis for an award
of moral damages to the victim and her parents in the same
criminal action, without independent proof thereof, because
the law presumes that not only the woman who was seduced,
abducted, raped or abused but as well as her parents naturally
suffer besmirched reputation, social humiliation, mental anguish
and wounded feelings. (Ibid.)

Note: The indemnity in the form of moral damages to a rape
victim has been increased to P50,000 without need of proof
of moral suffering. (People vs. Manalo, 396 SCRA 573 [2003];
People vs. Bondoy, 222 SCRA 216 [1993]; People vs. Baid, 336
SCRA 656 [2000].) In a case, the victim of multiple rapes was

Art. 2219

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

715

awarded P150,000. (People vs. Espinosa, 247 SCRA 66 [1995].)
The amount of P75,000 as civil indemnity is awarded if the
crime of rape is effectively qualified by any of the circumstances
under which the death penalty is authorized by the applicable
mandatory laws. (People vs. Ballester, 420 SCRA 379 [2004].)

(6) The defendant should not be made liable for moral
damages arising from libelous remarks in the pleadings where
they are relevant and pertinent to the case because the same
are covered by the mantel of privileged communication. (De La
Rosa vs. Manstela, [C.A.] 50 O.G. 254.)
(7) An award of moral damages is proper where the defendant maliciously undermined the plaintiff’s credit with a bank,
causing the bank to secure an unwarranted writ of execution
against the properties of the plaintiff and attempted to discredit
and “squeeze’’ plaintiff out of his own factory and business (also
actual and exemplary damages). (Coleongco vs. Claparola, 10
SCRA 577 [1964].)

(8) Where the defendants made serious libelous charges
against the Chairman of the Commission on Elections, assailing his integrity through a mimeographed article which was
publicly distributed and letters sents to the Commission on
Appointments, with malice aforethought, the defendants were
ordered to pay the plaintiff P20,000 as moral damages. (Imperial vs. Ziga, 19 CRA 726 [1967].)

(9) Where the defendant company imputed to the plaintiff
the crime of stealing electricity, resulting in mental anguish,
besmirched reputation, ridicule and humiliation, an award of
P25,000 was awarded to the plaintiff as moral damages. (Yutuk
vs. Manila Electric Co., 2 SCRA 337 [1961].)

(10) In estimating general damages for libel, injury to feelings and reputation, the publicity given to the libel, the extent
it tends to expose the plaintiff’s reputation to public hatred
contempt and ridicule, the social and business standing of the
plaintiff, and whether the particular method of publication adds
to the natural effects thereof and thereby increases plaintiff’s
mental suffering, are elements to be considered. (Jimenez vs.
Reyes, 27 Phil. 52 [1914].)

(11) The worries and anxieties of a defendant in a litigation
that was not maliciously instituted are not the moral damages
contemplated in the law. (Solis & Yarisantos vs. Salvador, 14
SCRA 887 [1965].)

(12) Malicious prosecution refers to unfounded criminal actions. The term has been expanded to include unfounded civil
suits instituted just to vex and humiliate the defendant despite
the absence of a cause of action or probable cause. (Equitable
Banking Corp. vs. Intermediate Appellate Court, 133 SCRA 135
[1984]; Madera vs. Lopez, 102 SCRA 700 [1981]; Buchanan vs.
Vda. De Esteban, 32 Phil. 363 [1970].)

The general rule, however, is that while a clearly unfounded
civil suit can at time be a legal justification for an award of attorney’s fees, such filing is not a ground for an award of moral
damages. The rationale for the rule is that the law could not
have intended to impose a penalty on the right to litigate. If
the rule were otherwise, then moral damages must in every
case be awarded in favor of the prevailing defendant against
an unsuccessful plaintiff. (Expertravel & Tours, Inc. vs. Court
of Appeals, 309 SCRA 141 [1999].)
(13) A breach of promise to marry may be actionable under
Article 21 (No. 10; Chap. 4, Part I.) as where the defendant
walked out of the wedding after it has been formally set and
going through all the necessary preparations and publicity.
(Wassmer vs. Velez, 12 SCRA 648 [1964].)

(14) The president of a government college, did not award
a student, minor, the honor of magna cum laude due to neglect
of duty and callousness. He was held liable for moral damages
of P20,000 by reason of Article 27 (No. 10; Chap. 4, Part I.), in
addition to nominal damages of P5,000, exemplary damages of
P10,000 and P2,000 as attorney’s fees. (Ledesma vs. Court of
Appeals, 160 SCRA 449 [1988].)
(15) Where the creditor bank not only filed an unwarranted
extra-foreclosure sale proceedings, but also published the notice
of the foreclosure and sale in the society pages of a Sunday edition of a widely circulated newspaper, instead of in the “legal
notices’’ or “classified ads’’ sections as in usual in such type
of notice, and in extraordinarily and boxed advertisements in

violation of the canons of conduct provided for in Articles 19,
20, and 21 (Chap. 4, Part I.) of the Civil Code. (Danao vs. Court
of Appeals, 154 SCRA 446 [1987].)

(16) Where the plaintiff secured an improperly and irregularly issued writ of attachment against the defendant based on a
false affidavit, the action to recover moral damages is identical
with or analogous to an ordinary action for malicious prosecution. (Phil. Commercial and Industrial Bank vs. Intermediate
Appellate Court, 196 SCRA 29 [1991].) But where the party
who requested the attachment acted in good faith and without
malice, the claim for damages resulting from the attachment
of property cannot be sustained. (California Bus Lines, Inc. vs.
State Investment House, Inc., 418 SCRA 297 [2003].)
Art. 2220. Willful injury to property may be a
legal ground for awarding moral damages if the
court should find that, under the circumstances,
such damages are justly due. The same rule applies
to breaches of contract where the defendant acted
fraudulently or in bad faith.
Injury to property and breach
of contract.
(1) If the injury to property is willful, the court may award
moral damages, if under the circumstances such damages are
justly due. Thus, where the plaintiffs, not contented with reducing
the water available for the defendants fields by the construction of a dam, deliberately blocked totally their water supply
by increasing the elevation of the dam without the defendants’
consent and without government authorization, the defendants
were held entitled to moral damages under Article 2220. (Del
Valle vs. Fernandez, 35 SCRA 352 [1970].)

(2) In case of breach of contract, moral damages may be
awarded only where the defendant acted fraudulently or in
bad faith, or with gross negligence amounting to bad faith. Bad
faith means a breach of duty through some motive or interest
or ill-will. It is still malice although self-enrichment or fraternal

718

DAMAGES

Art. 2220

interest, and not personal-ill-will may have been the motive.
(Lopez vs. Pan American World Airways, 16 SCRA 431 [1966];
Sweet Lines vs. Court of Appeals, 121 SCRA 769 [1983].)

(a) In a case, the respondent, a first class passenger, was
ousted from his first class seat by the petitioner air-carrier
manager who gave his seat to a white man and transferred
the respondent to the tourist class. He was given P25,000 as
moral damages, P10,000 as exemplary damages, and P3,000
as attorney’s fees for the discrimination and humiliation he
suffered. (Air France vs. Carrascoso, 18 SCRA 155 [1966];
Philippine Refining Co. vs. Garcia, 18 SCRA 107 [1966].)
(b) Moral damages are recoverable for breach of contract
of employment where the wrongful dismissal of an employee
was attended with malice and bad faith, or constitutes an
act oppressive to labor, or is done is a manner contrary to
morals, good customs, or public policy. (Globe Mackay Cable vs. Court of Appeals, 176 SCRA 776 [1989]; Lucena vs.
Pan-trade, Inc., 172 SCRA 733 [1989]; Colegio de San Juan
de Letran vs. Villas, 329 SCRA 550 [2003]; Quisaba vs. Sta.
Ines-Melale Veneer, 58 SCRA 771 [1974]; Lirag Textile Mills
vs. Court of Appeals, 63 SCRA 374 [1975].)
(c) Where under the contract of sale, the vendor is obligated to evict the squatters on his property, but he “made
little more than token effort to seek the ejectment of squatters
from the land, revealing her real intention to be finding a
way of getting out of her contract.’’ (Lim vs. Court of Appeals, 263 SCRA 569 [1996].)

(d) But the mere violation of a contract or a mere refusal
to accept the repurchase price in a pacto de retro sale does
not entitle a contracting party to demand moral damages.
(Botsaw vs. Interphil Promotions, Inc., 148 SCRA 635 [1987];
Legaspi vs. Salcedo, 142 SCRA 82 [1986].), nor for refusal to
deliver the goods sold for non fulfillment of a suspensive
condition. (see Visayan Sawmill Company, Inc. vs. Court of
Appeals, 219 SCRA 378 [1993].)
(e) Moral damages are not recoverable for breach of
contract of carriage (Tamayo vs. Aquino, 165 Phil. 949 [1959];

the death or physical injuries of a passenger and 2) where it
is proved that the carrier was guilty of fraud or bad faith,
even if death does not result.

(f) The mere carelessness of the carrier’s employee does
not per se constitute or justify an inference of malice or bad
faith on the part of the carrier. (Phil. Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc.

Co., Inc. vs. Bautista, 109 Phil. 712 [1960].)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. Plaintiff was intentionally and with malice off-loaded from
defendant’s plane for his “belligerent’’ attitude.

Facts: On October 23, 1964, the plaintiffs, spouses RZ and
TAZ as well as their daughter, CZ, were passengers aboard a
PANAM plane, from Honolulu to Manila, the first leg of which
was Wake Island. As the plane landed on said Island, the passengers were advised that they could disembark for a stop-over
of about 30 minutes. The plaintiff testified that, having found the
need to relieve himself, he went to the men’s comfort room at the
terminal building, but found it full of soldiers, in view of which
he walked down the beach some 100 yards away.

Meanwhile, the flight was called and when the passengers had
boarded the plane, plaintiff’s absence was noticed. The take-off
was, accordingly, delayed. Minutes later, plaintiff was seen walking back from the beach toward the terminal. Heading towards
the ramp of the plane, the plaintiff remarked, “You people almost
made me miss your flight. You have a defective announcing system
and I was not paged.’’

Mr. Sitton, defendant’s airport manager, asked plaintiffs to turn
over their baggage claim checks. Plaintiffs did so, handing him
four (4) claim checks. However, only three (3) bags were located
and segregated from the rest of the passengers’ luggage. The items
handcarried by plaintiffs, except for plaintiff’s overcoat, were
also brought down. These handcarried items, however, were not

720

DAMAGES

Art. 2220

opened or inspected. Later, plaintiffs TAZ and CZ were permitted
to reboard the plane with their handcarried luggages; and when
the plane took off, about two and a half hours later, it carried
plaintiff’s fourth bag, his overcoat and the handcarried luggage.

Once three bags had been identified, and while the search was
going on for the fourth bag, Mr. Sitton, demanded that plaintiffs
open the bags (actually, they were closed, but not locked) and allow defendant’s employees to inspect them. Plaintiff RZ refused
and warned that the defendant could open the bags only by force
and at its peril of a law suit. Mr. Sitton, then told plaintiff that he
would not be allowed to proceed to Manila on board the plane
and handed RZ the following letter stating “we are forced to off
load you from flight 84123 due to the fact that you have refused
to open your checked baggage for inspection as requested. x x x’’

All this happened in plain view and within earshot of the
other passengers on the plane, many of whom were Filipinos
who knew the plaintiffs.
Though originally all three plaintiffs had been off loaded, RZ
requested that his wife and daughter be permitted to continue
with the flight. This was allowed but they were required to leave
the three bags behind. Nevertheless, the plane did fly with the
plaintiff’s fourth bag. It was found among all other passengers’
luggage flown to Manila upon the plane’s arrival here.
Upon arrival at Manila, TAZ demanded of defendant’s Manila
office that it re-route plaintiff RZ to Manila at the earliest possible time, by the fastest route, and at its expense. The defendant
refused, so the plaintiffs were forced to pay for his ticket and to
send him money as he was without funds.

On October 27, 1964, plaintiff RZ finally arrived at Manila,
after spending two nights at Wake Island, going back to Honolulu,
and from Honolulu flying thru Tokyo to Manila.
On December 21, 1964, plaintiffs demanded that the defendant reimburse them in the sum of P1,505,502.85 for damages, but
defendants refused to do so.

Issue: Are the plaintiff entitled to actual, moral, and exemplary
damages?
Held: (1) Defendant deliberately left plaintiff at Wake Island. — “It
is urged, that plaintiff is, at most entitled to actual damages only,
because he was the first to commit a breach of contract, for having gone over 200 yards away from the terminal, where he could

Art. 2220

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

721

not expect to be paged. But, PAN AM has not pointed out what
part of the contract has been violated thereby, apart from the fact
that the award for damages made in the decision appealed from
was due, not to PANAM failure to so page the plaintiff, but to
the former’s deliberate act of leaving him at Wake Island, and the
embarrassment and humiliation caused to him and his family in
the presence of many other persons.
Then also, considering the flat nature of the terrain in Wake
Island, and the absence of buildings and structures, other than
the terminal and a modest ‘hotel,’ as well as plaintiff’s need of
relieving himself, he had to find a place beyond the view of the
people and near enough the sea to wash himself up before going
back to the plane.’’
(2) The off-loading made with malice aforethought. — “It is next
argued that plaintiff was also guilty of contributory negligence
for failure to reboard the plane within the 30 minutes announced
before the passengers debarked therefrom. This might have justified a reduction of the damages, had plaintiff been unwittingly
left by the plane, owing to the negligence of PAN AM personnel
or even, perhaps, wittingly, if he could not be found before the
plane’s departure. It does not, and can not have such justification
in the case at bar, plaintiff having shown up before the plane
had taken off, and he having been off-loaded intentionally and
with malice aforethought, for his ‘belligerent’ attitude, according
to Captain Zentner; for having dared — despite his being one of
‘three monkey’s’ — the term used by Captain Zentner to refer to
the Zulueta family — to answer him back — when he (Captain
Zentner) said: ‘what in the hell do you think you are?’ — in a
way he had ‘not been spoken to’ in his ‘whole adult life,’ in the
presence of the passengers and other PANAM employees; for
having responded to a command of either Zentner or Sitton to
open his (plaintiff’s) bags, with a categorical refusal and a challenge for Zentner or Sitton to open the bags without a search
warrant therefor, thereby making manifest the lack of authority
of the aforementioned representative of PAN AM to issue said
command and exposing him to ridicule before said passengers
and employees.
Besides, PAN AM’s own witness and employee Wayne Pendleton, testified that the plane could not take off at 4:30, as scheduled,
because “we were still waiting for two (2) local passengers.’’

(3) Plaintiff’s entitled to both moral and exemplary damages. —
“The records amply establish plaintiffs’ right to recover both moral

722

DAMAGES

Art. 2220

and exemplary damages.

Indeed, the rude and rough reception plaintiff received at the
hands of Sitton or Captain Zentner when the latter met him at the
ramp (‘what in the hell do you think you are? Get on that plane’’);
the menacing attitude of Zentner or Sitton and the supercilious
manner in which he had asked plaintiff to open his bags (‘open
your bag,’ and when told that a fourth bag was missing, ‘I don’t
give a damn’); the abusive language and highly scornful reference
to plaintiffs as monkeys by one of PAN AM’s employees (who
turning to Mrs. Zulueta and Miss Zulueta remarked, ‘will you
pull these three monkeys out of here?’); the unfriendly attitude,
the ugly stares and unkind remarks to which plaintiffs were
subjected, and their being cordoned by men in uniform as if they
were criminals, while plaintiff was arguing with Sitton; the airline
officials’ refusal to allow plaintiff to board the plane on the pretext
that he was hiding a bomb in his luggage and their arbitrary and
high-handed decision to leave him in Wake; Mrs. Zulueta’s having
suffered a nervous breakdown for which she was hospitalized as
a result of the embarrassment, insults and humiliations to which
plaintiffs were exposed by the conduct of PAN AM’s employees;
Miss Zulueta’s having suffered shame, humiliation and embarrassment for the treatment received by her parents at the airports
— all these justify an award for moral damages resulting from
mental anguish, serious anxiety, wounded feelings, moral shock,
and social humiliation thereby suffered by plaintiffs.’’
(4) Relation between carrier passenger and passenger. — “The relation between carrier and passenger involves special and peculiar
obligations and duties, differing in kind and degree, from those
of almost every other legal or contractual relation. On account
of the peculiar situation of the parties the law implies a promise
and imposes upon the carrier the corresponding duty of protection and courteous treatment. Therefore, the carrier is under the
absolute duty of protecting his passengers from assault or insult
by himself or his servants.

A contract to transport passengers is quite different in kind
and degree from any other contractual relation. And this, because
of the relation which an air-carrier sustains with the public. Its
business is mainly with the traveling public. It invites people to
avail of the comforts and advantages it offers. The contract of air
carriage, therefore, generates a relation attended with a public
duty. Neglect or malfeasance of the carrier’s employees naturally

Art. 2220

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

723

could give ground for an action for damages.

Passengers do not contract merely for transportation. They
have a right to be treated by the carrier’s employees with kindness, respect, courtesy and due consideration. They are entitled
to be protected against personal misconduct, injurious language,
indignities and abuses from such employees. So it is, that any
rude or discourteous conduct on the part of employees towards
a passenger gives the latter an action for damages against the
carrier. (Air France vs. Carrascoso, L-21438 [1966].)’’
(5) Factors in assessing moral damages. — “The question is
whether the award of P1,000,000 as moral damages was proper
and justified by the circumstances. It has been held that the discretion in fixing moral damages lies in the trial court. (Coleongco v.
Claparols, L-17616, 1964; Corpus v. Cuaderno Sr., L-23721, 1965)
Among the factors courts taken into account in assessing moral
damages are the professional, social, political and financing standing of the offended parties on one hand, and the business and
financial position of the offender on the other. (Domingding vs.
Ng, 103 Phil. 111; Northwest Airlines, Inc. vs. Cuenca, L-22425;
Lopez v. Pan American World Airways, L-22415, 1966).’’

(6) Cases of Air France and Lopez. — “In comparatively recent
cases in this jurisdiction, also involving breach of contract of air
carriage, this Court awarded the amount of P25,000, where plaintiff, a first-class passenger in an Air France plane from Manila
to Rome was, in Bangkok, forced by the manager of the airline
company to leave his first class accommodation after he was already seated because there was a white man who, the manager
alleged, had a ‘better right’ to the seat (Air France v. Carrascoso,
supra.); the amount of P200,000, where plaintiffs, upon confirmation of their reservation in defendant airline’s flight from Tokyo
to San Francisco were issued first class tickets, but upon arrival
in Tokyo were informed that there was no accommodation for
them in the first class compartment and told them they could
not go unless they took the tourist class (Lopez v. Pan American
World Airways, supra.) — in both of which cases the Court found
the airline companies to have acted in bad faith, or in a wanton,
reckless and oppressive manner, justifying likewise the award of
exemplary damages.
None of the passengers involved in said cases was, however,
off-loaded, much less in a plane as barren and isolated as Wake
Island, with the prospect of being stranded there for a week. The

724

DAMAGES

Art. 2220

aforementioned passengers were merely constrained to take a tourist or third class accommodation in lieu of the first class passage
they were entitled to. Then, also, in none of said cases had the
agents of the carrier acted with the degree of malice or bad faith
of those of PANAM in the case at bar, or caused to the offended
passengers a mental suffering arising from injuries to feelings,
fright and shock due to abusive, rude and insulting language used
by the carrier’s employees in the presence and within the hearing
of others, comparable to that caused by PANAM’s employees to
plaintiffs herein.”
(7) Plaintiff contributed to the gravity of the situation. — “To
some extent extent, however, plaintiff had contributed to the
gravity of the situation because of the extreme belligerence with
which he had reacted on the occasion. We do not overlook the fact
that he justly believed he should uphold and defend his dignity
and that of the people of this country; that the discomfort, the
difficulties, and, perhaps, the ordeal through which he had gone
to relieve himself — which were unknown to PAN AM’s agents
— were such as to put him in no mood to be understanding of
the shortcomings of others; and that said PAN AM agents should
have first inquired, with an open mind, about the cause of his
delay, instead of assuming that he was at fault and of taking an
arrogant and over-bearing attitude, as if they were dealing with
an inferior.
Just the same, there is every reason to believe that, in all probability, things would not have turned out as bad as they became
had he not allowed himself, in a way, to be dragged to the level
or plane on which PANAM’s personnel had placed themselves.’’

(8) Items of damages for which defendant liable. — “In view of
this circumstance, we feel that the moral and exemplary damages
collectible by the plaintiffs should be reduced to one-half of the
amounts awarded by the lower court, that is, to P500,000 for moral
damages, and P200,000 for exemplary damages, aside from the
attorney’s fees which should, likewise, be reduced to P75,000.00.
Modified, as above stated, in the same that plaintiffs shall
recover from defendant, Pan American World Airways, Inc.,
the sums of P500,000 as moral damages, P200,000 as exemplary
damages, and P75,000 as attorney’s fees, apart from P5,502.85 as
actual damages, and without prejudice to deducting the aforementioned sum of P50,000 already paid to Mrs. Zulueta, the decision
appealed from is hereby affirmed in all other respects, with the

Art. 2220

Moral Damages

725

costs against said defendant.’’ (Zulueta vs. Pan American World, 43
SCRA 397 [1972].)

2. Private respondent was not allowed by petitioner to continue
working for having allegedly incurred a shortage in his collections in
the sum of P12,155.68 but the trial court found the shortage to be only
P41.85.

Facts: Private respondent F. Sarabia, was employed in 1952 by
petitioner company as a bill collector. To guarantee fulfill-ment of
his obligations as such, he posted in favor of petitioner two surety
bonds in the total amount of P4,000.00.

Contending that, an auditing report presented by the accounting firm of Sycip, Gorres and Velayo in January, 1965, showed that
Sarabia had incurred a shortage in his collections for a period of
7 1/2 years in the sum of P12,155.68, the petitioner filed against
him and the surety company a suit for reimbursement on June
22, 1966. Prior thereto, or, in February, 1965, the private respondent had not been allowed by the petitioner to continue working.

In his Answer filed on October 31, 1966, Sarabia denied the
shortage, attributing it to erroneous accounting, and prayed for
attorney’s fees in the sum of P800,000 and actual damages in the
sum of P500.00. And, in an Amended Answer, Sarabia alleged an
additional counterclaim that he was dismissed without cause and
prayed for reinstatement with back salaries and damages.
Respondent surety company disclaimed any liability because
of Sarabia’s refusal to admit the shortage.

The Trial Court found the shortage to be only in the amount of
P41.85; that the case was the product of “either a willful frame-up
or a mistake in accounting’’; and ordered Sarabia’s reinstatement
with back wages from January, 1965; the payment to him of moral
damages of P20,000.00, exemplary damages of P10,000.00, attorney’s
fees of P5,000.00, and expenses of litigation of P1,000.00, costs.
The complaint as against the surety company was dismissed.

Respondent Court of Appeals affirmed the amount of the
shortage and the reinstatement ordered, but modified the judgment by limiting backwages to the monthly salary of P180.00 for
a period of three years, or the total sum of P6,480.00, as actual
damages, P10,000.00 as moral damages, P5,000.00 as exemplary
damages, P2,000.00 for attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation,

726

DAMAGES

Art. 2220

and costs; all such amounts to bear legal interest from the date
when the judgment in this case shall become final, until fully paid.
Reinstatement was conditioned upon Sarabia’s physical fitness,
who was said to be “at present old and sick,’’ and upon presentation of a duly verified certification by a Government physician.
Issue: Is the award of moral and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees proper?

Held: (1) Private respondent entitled to reinstatement and backwages.
— “That Sarabia did not actually incur any shortages except for
the amount of P41.85 is a factual finding that is binding upon
this Court in the absence of established exceptions. Considering
the error in the shortage, we agree that petitioner need not have
terminated his services. He is thus entitled to reinstatement and
backwages in the total sum of P6,480.00.’’

(2) Award of moral damages uncalled for. — “The award of moral
damages is uncalled for. In filing the present case, petitioner had
not acted with malice, fraud or in bad faith. It relied solely on the
letter of the accounting firm of Sycip, Gorres & Velayo. However,
such reliance was misplaced, for, as found by the Court of Appeals,
that letter was ‘only a brief letter mentioning some summarized
findings which are unverified and undetailed. It even stressed
the fact that there are uncertained differences ‘due to unavailable
records and/or customer’s credit balances due to overpayment’.’’
(3) Award of exemplary damages not proper. — “Neither are exemplary damages proper. Petitioner had not acted in a ‘wanton,
fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner.’ Based on
the accounting findings, incomplete though they may have been,
petitioner cannot be blamed for trying to protect itself.’’

(4) Grant of attorney’s fees and costs of suit just and equitable. —
“The grant of attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation of P2,000.00
is, we find, just and equitable.’’ (Panay Electric Co., Inc. vs. Court
of Appeals, 119 SCRA 456 [1982].)

Section 2. — Nominal Damages
Art. 2221. Nominal damages are adjudicated in
order that a right of the plaintiff, which has been
violated or invaded by the defendant, may be vindicated or recognized, and not for the purpose of
indemnifying the plaintiff for any loss suffered by him.

Art. 2220

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Moral Damages

727

Concept of nominal damages.
Nominal damages are defined in Article 2221. They are those
recoverable where a legal right is technically violated and must
be vindicated against an invasion that has produced no actual
present loss of any kind, or where, from the nature of the case,
there has been some injury arising from a breach of contract or
legal duty but the amount thereof has not been or cannot be
shown. (see Algarra vs. Sandejas, 27 Phil. 284 [1914]; 22 Am.
Jur. 2d 20.)

According to the Code Commission, “there are instances
when the vindication or recognition of the plaintiff’s right is of
the outmost importance to him, as in the case of trespass upon
real property. The awarding of nominal damages does not,
therefore, run counter to the maxim. De minimis non curat lex.22’’
(Report, p. 74.)
Nature and purpose of nominal damages.
(1) “Nominal damages’’ is a term used to distinguish a certain type of damage awards from those given as compensatory
or actual damages.

(a) Damage inferred from injury. — The law infers some
damage from the breach of an agreement or invasion of a
right, and if no evidence is given of any particular amount
of loss, it declares the right by awarding what it terms
“nominal damages.’’ (22 Am. Jur. 2d. 20.) Its allowance is
generally based on the ground that every injury from its
very nature legally imports damage.

(b) Insignificant damages distinguished from small damages.
— Any award which is not of any significant amount but
is given primarily as a court’s recognition of the justness or
rightness of a claim is a “nominal’’ award. Such damages are
to be distinguished from small damages, since, although they
may be small even to insignificance, they may be substantial
in the sense that a sum may be allowed to the injured party
sufficient to compensate him for all the damages actually
sustained. (Ibid. 22.)

728

DAMAGES

Art. 2221

(2) A violation of the plaintiff’s right, even if only technical,
is sufficient to support an award of nominal damages. As long
as there is a showing of such violation, an award of nominal
damages is proper. (Almeda vs. Cariño, 395 SCRA 144 [2003].)

(a) To vindicate rights of plaintiff. — Nominal damages
are not for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff for
any loss suffered by him, but for the vindication or recognition of a right violated or invaded. They are recoverable
where some injury has been done the amount of which
the evidence fails to show, the assessment being left to the
discretion of the court according to the circumstances of the
case. In truth, nominal damages are damages in name only
and not in fact, and are allowed, not as an equivalent of a
wrong inflicted, but simply in recognition of the existence
of a technical injury. (Robes-Francisco Realty & Dev. Corp.
vs. Court of First Instance, 86 SCRA 59 [1978]; Pedrosa vs.
Court of Appeals, 145 SCAD 146, 353 SCRA 620 [2001]; see
Ventanilla vs. Centeno, 1 SCRA 215 [1961].)

(b) To recognize existence of technical injury. — Nominal
damages are really a symbolic award given to the plaintiff
when liability of the defendant is established but the amount
of the harm done is not measurable or even demonstrable.
The award indicates that the defendant committed a wrong
and it serves to clarify or vindicate the rights of the plaintiff.
Art. 2222. The court may award nominal damages in every obligation arising from any source
enumerated in Article 1157, or in every case where
any property right has been invaded.
Obligations for violation of which nominal
damages may be awarded.
Nominal damages may be assessed by the court in every
obligation proven to have been violated whether such obligation
arises from law, contracts, quasi-contracts, crimes, or quasi-delicts
(Art. 1157.), or in every case where the property right of the
plaintiff has been invaded. They are not recoverable when there

Art. 2221

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Nominal Damages

729

is an award of actual, moral, or temperate damages.

(1) Invasion of a legal right. — Every injury to, or invasion of,
one’s legal rights, imports damage, and if substantial damage is
not established, the injured party is entitled to nominal damages.
To warrant recovery of nominal damages, there must, however,
be an unlawful invasion of a legal right. Thus, damages cannot flow from a lawful business or commercial transaction in
which a person has a right to engage, or from his refusal to do
an act where such refusal is, as a matter of law, wholly within
his power and voluntary choice (22 Am. Jur. 2d. 22.), or where
the doing of the act is entrusted by law to his sole discretion.
(2) Torts. — Nominal damages are not recoverable in cases
in which damages are an element of the cause of action and
plaintiff has failed to prove those damages. In such cases, nominal damages are not awarded.

Ordinarily, only nominal damages can be recovered for a
tort where there is no evidence from which damage can be calculated. They are not recoverable in actions to recover damages
for ordinary negligence where damages are an element of the
cause of action and the plaintiff has failed to prove the same.
However, ordinary negligence is to be distinguished from a willful wrong, and, in this respect, it has been said that recovery in
tort, save only in cases of willful wrong, is compensatory only.

(3) Breach of contract. — Upon breach of a contract, the
person guilty of the breach is liable for nominal damages, if
actual damages cannot be proved. Thus, only nominal damages are recoverable upon breach of a contract if no actual or
substantial damage resulted from the breach or no damage has
been shown.
Examples include those cases in which (a) actual damage is
uncertain or not susceptible of proof, (b) damages are too remote,
conjectural and speculative to form the basis of a legal recovery,
and (c) because of indefiniteness in the terms of the contract,
there is no basis for establishing any measure of damages for its
breach and the injured party fails to bring himself within them.
24

Art. 1229. The judge shall equitably reduce the penalty when the principal obliga-

730

DAMAGES

Art. 2222

The recovery for breach of contract may also be limited to
nominal damages where the plaintiff’s negligence contributed to
the loss, where, by the exercise of reasonable diligence, he could
have prevented an actual loss, or where it would be physically
impossible for him to perform the contract. However, recovery
should not be limited to nominal damages where the plaintiff is
shown to have suffered actual damages as a result of the breach.
In such case, he is entitled to substantial damages. (Ibid. 23-24.)
When there is breach of contract but the breach is excusable or
justifiable, nominal damages are not recoverable. (25 C.J.S. 467.)
(4) Personal injury action. — The rule permits the recovery
of nominal damages in personal injury actions where a compensable injury has been proved, but where, as the result of
something other than the paucity of the plaintiff’s evidence, no
measurable actual damage has been shown. For example, it has
been held that if a physical injury done to another is small or
the mitigating circumstances are strong, only nominal damages
will be given.
(5) Invasion of property. — Nominal damages are recoverable
for an illegal invasion of property right though no substantial
damages resulted or are proved. Thus, they may be recovered
for an injury to, or trespass on real property, where no actual
damages are shown, where property having no pecuniary value
is injured or destroyed, or for wrongful attachment, not resulting
in any actual damage, or where no special damage is alleged.

(6) Breach of duty by a public officer. — Also, only nominal
damages are recoverable for defaults or breaches of duty by
public officers where no actual damages result or none is proved.
(22 Am. Jur. 2d. 24-26.)
Brief rulings on nominal damages.

In the following cases, nominal damages were awarded
through no actual damages or substantial injury was shown to
have resulted from the violation or invasion of a right.

(1) Where the counsel was negligent in not depositing on
time the appeal bond and filing the record on appeal within
the extension period granted by the court which brought about
the refusal of the trial court to allow the record on appeal, the

Art. 2222

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES

731

right violated being the right of appeal. (Ventanilla vs. Centeno,
1 SCRA 215 [1961].)

(2) Where the counsel failed to remit on time the docket fee
and estimated costs of printing the record on appeal. (Bongcal
vs. Ensoy, 9 C.A. Rep. [2s] 795.)

(3) Where the employees of the Social Security System attempted to foreclose mistakenly the mortgage of the borrower
who was not delinquent at all (also attorney’s fees). (Social
Security System vs. Court of Appeals, 120 SCRA 707 [1983].)
(4) Where the defendant was sued for damages in his individual capacity for having issued a warrant of destraint and
levy against the properties of the plaintiff which had not paid
the tax imposed by an ordinance on beer and soft drinks and
the trial court dismissed the action (also attorney’s fees). (San
Miguel Brewery, Inc. vs. Magno, 21 SCRA 292 [1967].)
(5) Where the respondent holder of a first class ticket from
Manila to Tokyo was rudely compelled by an agent of the
petitioner, in the presence of other passengers, to move to the
tourist class, with full knowledge of the fact that the respondent was traveling in his official capacity as a delegate of the
Philippines to a conference in Tokyo (also exemplary damages).
(Northwest Airlines, Inc. vs. Cuenca, 14 SCRA 1063 [1965].)
(6) Where the petitioner, for a fee, undertook to send private
respondent two telegraphic money orders, and it was only after
two (2) months from transmittal that the respondent was able
to receive the money. (Phil. Telegraph & Telephone Corp. vs.
Court of Appeals, 388 SCRA 270 [2002].)

(7) Where the vendees of property, refused to pay the remaining balance of the purchase price, despite repeated demands,
even after they had sold the same to third parties. (Almeda vs.
Cariño, 395 SCRA 144 [2003].)

(8) Where the complainant suffered a mutilation of his left
ear when he grappled with the petitioner who shot him twice
for the gun, and a permanent scar remained in the complainant’s forearms, for even in the absence of competent proof of
the amount of actual damages, “there is no room for doubt that
some species of injury was caused to the complainant because of

732

DAMAGES

Art. 2222

the medical expenses he incurred in having his wounds treated
and the loss of income due to his failure to work during his
hospitalization.’’ (Sumalpong vs. Court of Appeals, 79 SCAD
969, 268 SCRA 764 [1997].)

(9) Where an airline company was not able to transport
the private respondents from Narita, Japan to Manila due to
the effects of the Mt. Pinatubo eruption, a fortuitous event, but
it failed in its duty to make the necessary arrangements to
transport them on the first available connecting flight to Manila
and even declassified respondents from “transit passengers’’
to “new passengers’’ as a result of which they were obliged to
make the necessary arrangements themselves for the next flight
to Manila. (Japan Airlines vs. Court of Appeals, 294 SCRA 19
[1998].)
Art. 2223. The adjudication of nominal damages
shall preclude further contest upon the right involved
and all accessory questions, as between the parties
to the suit, or their respective heirs and assigns.
Effect of adjudication of nominal damages.
An award of nominal damages precludes the recovery of
actual, moral, and temperate damages. (Ventanilla vs. Centeno,
1 SCRA 215 [1961].)

(1) Nominal damages cannot co-exist with actual or compensatory damages (Armovit vs. Court of Appeals, 184 SCRA
476 [1990]; Light Rail Transit Authority vs. Navidad, 397 SCRA
75 [2003].) They are awarded only if there is no proof of actual
damages.
(2) Where the court has already awarded compensatory damages, the award of nominal damages is unnecessary and improper.
The purpose of nominal damage is to vindicate or recognize a right
that has been violated in order to preclude further contest thereof,
and not for the purpose of indemnifying the plaintiff for any loss
suffered by him. An award of compensatory damages is in itself
a judicial recognition that the plaintiff’s right has been violated.
Thus, where substantial compensatory damages for death had
been awarded against the registered operator of a public utility

Art. 2222

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Nominal Damages

733

vehicle, an award P10,000 by way of nominal damages in the same
action was held untenable as a matter of law. (Vda. De Medina vs.
Cresencia, 99 Phil. 506 [1956].)

(3) Where the interests of the stockholders were already represented by the corporation itself, which was the proper party
plaintiff, and no cause of action accruing to them separately
from the corporation is alleged in the complaint, other than for
moral damages, the court’s ruling denying the claim for moral
damages to the corporation and no appeal from such ruling has
been taken, also rules out the claim for nominal damages and
exemplary damages to the stockholders. (Mindanao Academy,
Inc. vs. Yap, 13 SCRA 190 [1965].)
Section 3. — Temperate or Moderate Damages
Art. 2224. Temperate or moderate damages, which
are more than nominal but less than compensatory
damages, may be recovered when the court finds
that some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its
amount can not, from the nature of the case, be
proved with certainty.
Concept of temperate or moderate damages.
Temperate or moderate damages are defined in Article 2224.
The Code Commission says:

“In some States of the American Union, temperate damages are allowed. There are cases where from the nature of
the case, definite proof of pecuniary loss cannot be offered,
although the court is convinced that there has been such loss.

For instance, injury to one’s commercial credit or to
the goodwill of a business firm is often hard to show with
certainty in terms of money. Should damages be denied for
that reason? The judge should be empowered to calculate
moderate damages in such cases, rather than that the plaintiff
should suffer, without redress, from the defendant’s wrongful act.’’ (Report, p. 75.)

734

DAMAGES

Art. 2223

Art. 2225. Temperate damages must be reasonable under the circumstances.
Amount of temperate or moderate damages.
(1) Reasonable under the circumstances. — Temperate or moderate damages are included within the context of compensatory
damages. (Pleno vs. Court of Appeals, [161 SCRA 208 [1988].)
The assessment of such damages is left to the sound discretion
of the court, but the amount thereof must be reasonable under
the circumstances and the same may only be recovered when
the court finds some pecuniary loss has been suffered but its
amount, cannot from the nature of the case, be proved with
certainty in terms of money.

(2) Evidence of some pecuniary loss. — It is essential that
there be evidence that “some pecuniary loss has been suffered’’
although the same is incapable of exact estimation. The court
will calculate the temperate or moderate damages. (Necesito
vs. Paras, 104 Phil. 75 [1945].)
(3) In case of death without evidence to prove damages. — The
Supreme Court has laid down the rule that, in case of death,
where the amount of actual damages cannot be determined
because of the absence of receipts to prove the same, temperate
damages may be awarded, it being reasonable to presume that
the family of the victim necessarily incurs expenses for the wake
and the funeral. Such damages, taking into account the current
jurisprudence fixing the indemnity for death at P50,000, should
be one-half thereof or P25,000. This makes temperate damages
equal to the award of exemplary damages which is likewise
fixed at P25,000 in cases where its award is justified. (People
vs. Abrazaldo, 397 SCRA 137 [2003]; People vs. Buayaban, 400
SCRA 48 [2003]; People vs. Sara, 417 SCRA 431 [2003]; People
vs. Segnar, Jr., 423 SCRA 206 [2004].)
As to actual damages, only substantial and proven expenses
or those that appear to have been genuinely incurred in connection with the death, wake or burial of the victim will be
recognized. (People vs. Rollon, 410 SCRA 295 [2003].)
When both actual and temperate damages

Arts. 2224-2225

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Temperate or Moderate Damages

735

may be awarded.
Temperate damages, may be recovered, in lieu of actual
damages, when the court finds that some pecuniary loss has
been suffered but its amount cannot be proved with certainty.
(People vs. Berdin, 416 SCRA 582 [2003].)

In Ramos vs. Court of Appeals (321 SCRA 584 [1999].), given
as one of the illustrative cases on medical malpractice discussed
under Article 2179 (Chap. 6, Part I.), the Supreme Court sustained the award of both actual and temperate damages to
the petitioner and his wife who was rendered comatose after
a “cholecystectomy’’ operation. She suffered brain damage,
needing constant medical attention in their residence after her
discharge from the hospital.
It explains, thus:

(1) Chronic and continuing injury with possible future complications. — “Our rules on actual or compensatory damages
generally assume that at the time of litigation, the injury
suffered as a consequence of an act of negligence has been
completed and that the cost can be liquidated. However, these
provisions neglect to take into account those situations, as
in this case, where the resulting injury might be continuing
and possible future complications directly arising from the
injury, while certain to occur, are difficult to predict.

In these cases, the amount of damages which should be
awarded, if they are to adequately and correctly respond
to the injury caused, should be one which compensates for
pecuniary loss incurred and proved, up to the time of trial;
and one which would meet pecuniary loss certain to be
suffered but which could not, from the nature of the case,
be made with certainty. In other words, temperate damages
can and should be awarded on top of actual or compensatory damages in instances where the injury is chronic and
continuing. And because of the unique nature of such cases,
no incompatibility arises when both actual and temperate
damages are provided for. The reason is that these damages
cover two distinct phases.’’
(2) Additional damages to cover estimated future cost of
proper care. — “As it would not be equitable — and certainly

736

DAMAGES

Art. 2225

not in the best interests of the administration of justice —
for the victim in such cases to constantly come before the
courts and invoke their aid in seeking adjustments to the
compensatory damages previously awarded — temperate
damages are appropriate. The amount given as temperate
damages, though to a certain extent speculative, should take
into account the cost of proper care.

In the instant case, petitioners were able to provide
only home-based nursing care for a comatose patient who
has remained in that condition for over a decade. Having
premised our award for compensatory damages on the
amount provided by petitioners at the onset of litigation,
it would be now much more in step with the interests of
justice if the value awarded for temperate damages would
allow petitioners to provide optimal care for their loved one
in a facility which generally specializes in such care. They
should not be compelled by dire circumstances to provide
substandard care at home without the aid of professionals,
for anything less would be grossly inadequate. Under the
circumstances, an award of P1,500,000.00 in temperate damages would, therefore, be reasonable.’’

In the above case, the Supreme Court modified the decision
of the Court of Appeals so as to award in favor of the petitioners, and solidarily against the private respondents including
the hospital, the following: (1) P1,352,000 as actual damages,
plus monthly payment of P8,000 (to cover estimated monthly
expenses for the care of the patient) up to the time she expires
or miraculously survives; (2) P2,000,000 as moral damages; (3)
P1,500,000 as temperate damages; (4) P100,000 each (2 doctors
and the hospital) as exemplary damages and attorney’s fees;
and (5) the costs of the suit.
Brief rulings on temperate damages.
(1) Where the check of the depositor, a merchant engaged
in the import and export business, was wrongfully dishonored
by a bank, although the bank tried to rectify the error soon
after it was discovered but after the damage had been caused,
for “it can hardly be possible that a customer’s check can be
wrongfully refused payment without some impeachment of his

credit, which must in fact be an actual injury, though he cannot,
from the nature of the case, furnish independent, distinct proof
thereof. (Araneta vs. Bank of America, 40 SCRA 144 [1971].)

(2) Where the bank mistakenly dishonored the check of a
depositor, although in a matter of four (4) hours the mistake
was rectified and the check was honored (also attorney’s fees)
(Manila Banking Corporation vs. Intermediate Appellate Court,
131 SCRA 271 [1984].)
(3) In a case for unfair competition, where the plaintiff
was able to prove that he suffered pecuniary loss but not the
amount thereof. (Castro vs. Ice & Cold Storage Industries, 104
Phil. 1064 [1958].)

(4) Where a truck bumped a car causing injury to its driver,
the latter was awarded P48,244 as actual damages, P200,000
as temperate moderate damages, P200,000 as moral damages,
P4,5000 as exemplary damages, and P20,000 as attorney’s fees.
(Pleno vs. Court of Appeals, 161 SCRA 208 [1988].)
(5) Where a painter and professor of fine arts was injured
as a passenger in a jeepney accident. (Fores vs. Miranda, 105
Phil. 266 [1959].)

(6) Where defendant lawyer failed to perfect an appeal
from an adverse judgment of the trial court, the plaintiff client
was held not entitled to temperate or moderate damages since
he was already entitled to actual damages and was awarded
nominal damages. (Ventanilla vs. Centeno, 1 SCRA 215 [1961].)
Section 4. — Liquidated Damages
Art. 2226. Liquidated damages are those agreed
upon by the parties to a contract, to be paid in case
of breach thereof.
Concept and purpose of liquidated damages.
(1) Liquidated damages are defined in Article 2226. So they
cannot be awarded where the parties did not agree on that kind
of damages.

738

DAMAGES

Art. 2225

At common law, the phrase “liquidated damages’’ means a
sum of money stipulated by the parties at the time of entering
into a contract as being payable as compensation for injuries
in the event of a breach.
(2) The purpose in permitting a stipulation for damages as
compensation is to render certain and definite that which appears to be uncertain and not easily susceptible of proof. (22
Am. Jur. 2d 297-298.)
Distinguished from penalties.

Liquidated damages take the nature of penalties. (H.L. Carlos
Construction, Inc. vs. Marina Properties Corp., 421 SCRA 428
[2004].) It has been held that “there is no difference between
a penalty and liquidated damages, as far as legal results are
concerned.’’ (Lambert vs. Fox, 26 Phil. 588 [1914].) In either
case, the injured party need not prove his damages in order
that the sum stipulated may be demanded.
(1) As distinguished from liquidated damages, a “penalty’’ is
a sum inserted in a contract, not as the measure of compensation
for its breach, but rather as a punishment for default, or by way
of security for actual damages which may be sustained by reason
of non-performance. It involves the idea of punishment.
(2) A penalty is an agreement to pay a stipulated sum on
breach of contract, irrespective of the damage sustained. Its
essence is a payment of money stipulated as a deterrent to the
offending party, while the essence of liquidated damages is a
genuine covenanted pre-estimate of damages.

A provision for payment of a specified sum as compensation
for acts contemplated by the contract as opposed to compensation for injury resulting from breach of the contract, is neither
a penalty nor liquidated damages. Also to be distinguished
from both a penalty and liquidated damages is a contractual
limitation of liability. (Ibid. 298-299.)
Determining character of stipulated sum.
The question of whether a stipulated sum is a penalty or
for liquidated damages is answered by the application of one
or more aspects of the following rules.

Art. 2226

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Liquidated Damages

739

(1) Liquidated damages. — A stipulated sum is for liquidated
damages only:

(a) where the damages which the parties might reasonably anticipate are difficult to ascertain because of their
indefiniteness or uncertainty; and
(b) where the amount stipulated is either a reasonable
estimate of the damages which would probably be caused
by a breach or is reasonably proportionate to the damages
which have actually been caused by the breach.

(2) Penalty. — Ordinarily, a stipulated sum will be regarded
as a penalty:

(a) where it is evident that the sum was fixed to evade
the usury laws, or any other statute, or to cloak oppression;
(b) where the defaulting party is rendered liable for the
same amount whether the breach is total or partial, or where
the sum is set without regard to the extent of performance
where, in the nature of the promises, the extent of the performance would be important in determining the amount
of actual damages which would result; and
(c) where the contract provides for the payment of a
fine in addition to the amount of any damage caused by a
breach, such fine cannot be considered as liquidated damages but must be regarded as a penalty which cannot be
recovered.

(3) Partly liquidated damages and partly penalty. — A stipulation in a contract to forfeit a certain sum for a breach of its
terms cannot be separated, and a part discarded as a penalty,
and the remainder treated as liquidated damages. But the parties to a contract may agree that certain elements of damages
for its breach which are difficult to estimate shall be covered
by a provision for liquidated damages and that other elements
shall be ascertained in the usual manner. (Ibid. 299-300.)
Art. 2227. Liquidated damages, whether intended
as an indemnity or a penalty, shall be equitably
reduced if they are iniquitous or unconscionable.

740

DAMAGES

Art. 2226

Equitable reduction of liquidated damages.
The Code Commission says:

“They are frequently agreed upon by the parties either
by way of penalty or in order to avoid further controversy
on the amount of damages. In American law, it is only
when the clause is a penalty that the courts will reduce the
stipulated damages which are excessive. But Article 2247
[now 2227] of the proposed Code states: x x x
The reason is that in both cases, the stipulation is contra
bonos mores under Article 1326 [now 130623].

It is a mere technicality to refuse to lessen the damages to
their just amount simply because the stipulation is not meant
to be a penalty. An immoral stipulation is none the less immoral because it is called an indemnity.’’ (Report, p. 75.)

While penalties and liquidated damages are dealt with
separately in Articles 122924 and 2227, the fundamental rule
governing them still remains basically the same, leaving them
subject to reduction where equity so requires. (Joe’s Radio &
Electrical Supply vs. Alto Electronics Corp., 104 Phil. 333 [1958].)
Attorney’s fees in the nature of liquidated
damages.

Attorney’s fees provided in contracts as recoverable against
the other party as damages are in the nature of liquidated damages and the stipulation is aptly called a penal clause.25 (Polytrade
Corporation vs. Blanco, 30 SCRA 187 [1969]; Luneta Motor Co.
vs. Limagenco, 73 Phil. 80 [1942].) The attorney’s fees so provided are awarded in favor of the litigant, not his counsel. (Gan
Tiong vs. Court of Appeals, 28 SCRA 235 [1969].)

In a case, where it was stipulated in a contract to build a
chapel for P16,000, that if either party (the contractor or the
owner) failed to comply with the contract, the party should
pay the other party P4,000, the chapel was built but it was a
botched job, the owner was held entitled to recover damages,
but he was not allowed to confiscate the balance of P4,000 and
at the same time claim the stipulated liquidated damages. Since
the chapel could be used for the purpose intended, the damages

Art. 2227

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Liquidated Damages

741

of P4,000 were set-off against the unpaid balance of the contract
price. (Navarro vs. Mallari, 45 Phil. 242 [1924].)
Art. 2228. When the breach of the contract committed by the defendant is not the one contemplated
by the parties in agreeing upon the liquidated damages, the law shall determine the measure of damages, and not the stipulation.
When measure of damages stipulated,
to be determined by law.
Liquidated damages should be reduced due to the equities
of the case. (National Power Corp. vs. National Merchandising
Corp., 107 SCRA 789 [1982].) The stipulation as to the amount
of indemnity should not enforced where the breach committed
by the defendant is not the one contemplated by the parties.

Article 2228 on liquidated damages can be regarded as an
equivalent provision of Article 1229 (supra.) on penalties.

A stipulation for liquidated damage in a contract in case of
breach, presumably contemplates a total breach thereof. Where
there is partial or irregular performance, in view of Article 2228,
the liquidated damages must be reduced. If, in spite of the
breach, a party has accepted partial performance, a stipulation
for liquidated damages in case of a total breach of a contract
cannot be enforced.26 (Joe’s Radio & Electrical Supply vs. Alto
Electronics Corp., 104 Phil. 333 [1958].)
Section 5. — Exemplary or Corrective Damages
Art. 2229. Exemplary or corrective damages are
imposed, by way of example or correction for the
public good, in addition to the moral, temperate,
liquidated or compensatory damages.
Concept of exemplary or corrective
damages.
Exemplary or corrective damages are defined in Article 2229.

They are generally defined or described as damages which

742

DAMAGES

Art. 2227

are given as an enhancement of compensatory damages suffered and are allowed as a punishment of the defendant and
as a deterrent to others.

In American laws, the terms “exemplary,’’ “punitive,’’ and
“vindictive’’ are used interchangeably. (22 Am. Jur. 2d. 232.)
According to the Code Commission, the term “corrective” is
used in lieu of “punitive’’ in harmony with the modern theory
of penology. (Report, p. 75.)
Rationale for exemplary damages.
(1) The Code Commission further explained that “exemplary damages are required by public policy, for wanton acts
must be suppressed. They are an antidote so that the poison of
weakness may not run through the body politic. In conclusion,
the Commission believes that by the adoption of the Title on
‘Damages,’ whenever a right is transgressed, every manner of
loss or injury is compensated for in some way or another, as it
ought to be.’’ (Ibid., pp. 75-76.)

(2) Exemplary damages are imposed, in addition to the moral,
temperate, liquidated, or compensatory damages, to provide an
example or correction for the public good. They are designed to
reshape behavior that is socially deleterious in its consequence
(Makabili vs. Court of Appeals, 157 SCRA 253 [1988]; Ledesma
vs. Court of Appeals, 160 SCRA 449 [1988]; Mecenas vs. Court
of Appeals, 180 SCRA 83 [1992]; Zenith Insurance Corp. vs.
Court of Appeals, 185 SCRA 398 [1990]; Del Rosario vs. Court
of Appeals, 267 SCRA 158 [1997].) and deter the wrongdoer and
others like him from similar conduct in the future.
tion has been partly or irregularly complied with by the debtor. Even if there has been no
performance, the penalty may also be reduced by the courts if it is iniquitous or unconscionable. (1154a)
25
It is an accessory undertaking attached to an obligation to assume greater liability
in case of breach of the obligation, i.e., the obligation is not fulfilled or is partly or unregularly complied with. (De Leon & De Leon, Jr., Comments and Cases on Obligations and
Contracts, 2003 Ed., pp. 265-266.)
26
Art. 1234. If the obligation has been substantially performed in good faith, the obligor may recover as though there had been a strict and complete fulfillment, less damages
suffered by the obligee. (n)

Arts. 2228-2229

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Exemplary or Corrective Damages

743

(3) Exemplary damages are intended to serve as a deterrent
to serious wrong doings, and as a vindication of undue sufferings and wanton invasion of the rights of an injured or as a
punishment for those guilty of outrageous conduct. The theory
is that there should be compensation for the hurt caused by the
highly reprehensible conduct of the defendant — associated
with such circumstances as willfulness, wantonness, malice,
gross negligence or recklessness, oppression, insult, or fraud or
gross fraud that intensifies the injury. (People vs. Catubig, 363
SCRA 62 [2001]; People vs. Orilla, 422 SCRA 620 [2004].)
Conditions for the award.
Jurisprudence has set down the requirements for exemplary
damages to be awarded:

(1) They may be imposed by way of example or correction
only in addition to compensatory, moral, temperate, or liquidated
damages, and only after the claimant’s right to them has been
established;

(2) They cannot be recovered as a matter of right, their
determination depending upon the amount of compensatory
damages that may be awarded to the claimant; and

(3) The act must be accompanied by bad faith or done in
wanton, fraudulent, oppressive or malevolent manner. (Phil.
National Bank vs. Court of Appeals, 256 SCRA 44 [1996], citing

of Appeals, 165 SCRA 166 [1988].)
Under Article 2229, exemplary damages are imposed in
addition to the moral, temperate, liquidated, or compensatory
damages. Hence, in the absence of any of the four (4) kinds of
damages mentioned, exemplary damages cannot be granted.
Way of awarding moral and exemplary
damages.

The award of moral and exemplary damages in an aggregate

DAMAGES

Art. 2229

amount is not the usual way of awarding said damages. The
court should indicate what amount constitutes moral damages
and exemplary damages.

However, where the entitlement to moral damages has been
established, exemplary damages may be awarded, and even
though not so expressly pleaded in the complaint nor proved.
(Tan Kapoe vs. Masa, 134 SCRA 231 [1985]; People vs. Abolidor,

ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:

1. Respondent insurance company was sued for damages for denying a motor vehicle insurance claim on the ground that the driver of
the insured truck did not possess a proper driver’s license at the time
of the accident.
Facts: The petitioner insured his truck with respondent insurance company. While the policy was in effect, the insured truck
bumped another truck also owned by the petitioner and sustained
damages.

Petitioner filed a claim with the insurance company for the
proceeds from his policy. However, the claim was denied by the
insurance company on the ground that when its adjuster went to
investigate the matter, it was found that the driver of the insured
truck, LA, did not possess a proper driver’s license at the time
of the accident. The restriction in LA’s driver’s license provided
that he can only drive four-wheeled vehicles weighing not more
than 4,500 kgs. Since the insured truck he was driving weighed
more than 4,500 kgs., he therefore violated the “authorized driver”
clause of the insurance policy.
The petitioner claims that at the time of the accident, it was
in fact another driver named GB who was driving the insured
truck. GB possessed a driver’s license authorizing him to drive
vehicles such as the truck which weighed more than 4,500 kgs.
As evidence, the petitioner presented the Motor Vehicle Accident
Report wherein the Investigating Officer stated that it was GB
who was driving the insured truck and not LA. The said report
was made three days after the accident. However, respondent
insurance company was firm in its denial of the claim.

Hence, petitioner filed the civil case for damages before the
original trial court which “finds that plaintiff lacks sufficient cause
of action against the defendant and hence, orders his case dismissed
and further orders him to pay the defendant the following: 1)

Art. 2229

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Exemplary or Corrective Damages

745

P20,000.00 as attorney’s fees plus P500.00 for appearance fee; 2)
P50,000.00 as exemplary damages.’’ The decision was affirmed by
the Court of Appeals.
Issue: Was the award of exemplary damages and attorney’s
fees improper and without basis?

Held: (1) Award of exemplary damages. — “In Tiongco vs. Atty.
Deguma (317 SCRA 527 [1999].), we held that the entitlement to
the recovery of exemplary damages must be shown. In the case
at bar, respondent has not shown sufficient evidence that petitioner indeed schemed to procure the dubious documents and
lied through his teeth to establish his version of the facts. What
was found was that the document he presented was inadmissible,
and its contents were dubious. However, no proof was adduced
to sufficiently establish that it came to his hands through his
employment of underhanded means.
In Tiongco, we further stated:
‘Although exemplary damages cannot be recovered as a
matter of right, they also need not be proved. But a complainant must still show that he is entitled to moral, temperate or
compensatory damages before the court may consider the
question of whether or not exemplary damages should be
awarded.’
Thus, it was error for the courts below to award exemplary
damages in the absence of any award for moral, temperate or
compensatory damages.’’

(2) Award of attorney’s fees. — “The award of attorney’s fees
must also be deleted. Such award was given in its extraordinary
concept as indemnity for damages to be paid by the losing party
to the prevailing party. But it was not sufficiently shown that
petitioner acted maliciously in instituting the claim for damages.
Perforce, the award of attorney’s fees was improper.’’ (Lao vs.
Standard Insurance Co., 409 SCRA 43 [2003].)

2. Private respondents concocted a scheme to divest plaintiff of its
interests in an insurance company and for them to own the controlling
interests therein.
Facts: Sometime in 1949, J.R. Muñoz, in representation of a
New York business firm, Carum Trading, Inc., gave AV Rocha
US $400,000.00 to open an insurance company in the Philippines.

746

DAMAGES

Art. 2229

With the money, Rocha organized the Capital Insurance & Surety
Co., Inc. Under Rocha’s direction, the company prospered. A sister
corporation was subsequently also set up by Rocha, the Capital
Life Assurance Corporation.

In 1958, Rocha transferred all the shares of Capital Insurance
& Surety Co., Inc. (Capital Insurance) to Carum Trading, Inc. G.
Garrido replaced Rocha in the insurance corporation. Effective
control over Capital Insurance then passed to the hands of Sociedad
Europea de Financiacion (SEF) which came to own 89.75% of the
former’s stock, and 34.05% of the outstanding shares of Capital
Life Assurance Co. (Capital Life). That control was exercised by
Garrido, who was named General Manager of the insurance firms.
H also served as director of the companies, together with four (4)
others, including J.R. Muñoz, J. Amat, J. Amado Araneta, and A.
Gamboa (since deceased).
In 1966, Garrido and Araneta proposed to the board of directors
that Capital Insurance obtain a loan of P600,000.00 from Progressive Commercial Bank. (PCB) This, according to them, in order
that a better financial position could be projected when renewal
was sought of the license of its sister corporation, Capital Life.
Security for the loan would consist of the SEF shares in Capital
Insurance constituting, as above mentioned, 89.75% of the outstanding stock. Assurance was given by Garrido and Araneta, too, that
the loan was never to be used and would instead be placed on
time deposit in PCB. The assurance was no doubt of considerable
weight since PCB was owned and controlled by Araneta and his
family, and Garrido was himself a director thereof.

The board approved the arrangement. The loan of P600,000.00,
with maturity of 90 days and interest at 11% per annum, was obtained from PCB with the SEF shares as collateral. On October 19,
1966, PCB issued a cashier’s check in the amount of P600,000.00
in favor of SEF. The check was endorsed to said bank for “deposit
to the account of Capital Life Assurance Corporation,” and a certificate of time deposit was issued in favor of Capital Insurance.
A day earlier, on October 18, 1966 and before the cashier’s
check was drawn and deposited, and the certificate of time deposit delivered to Capital Life, Garrido, as president of Capital
Life, executed a deed assigning to PCB all the rights, title to
and interests of Capital Life in said time deposit certificate (No.
1189); and granting PCB full control of the deposit of P600,000.00
and the right to retain it until the loan was repaid together with

Art. 2229

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Exemplary or Corrective Damages

747

corresponding interest and charges, as well as all obligations in
connection therewith, and the right, if the loan were not repaid at
maturity, to charge Capital Life’s saving account for the full amount
of the outstanding balance thereof, without further notice to it.
A year and a half later, on “the pretext,” according to the
Court of Appeals, “that the loan was unpaid,” and no doubt to
the surprise and consternation of SEF and the other directors of
Capital Insurance, PCB caused the foreclosure of the pledged SEF
shares and its sale at public auction through a notary public, resulting in said shares being eventually auctioned off to PCB on May
20, 1968. PCB then scheduled a stockholders’ meeting of Capital
Insurance to effect a reorganization of the firm.
SEF, Muñoz, and Amat forthwith instituted a derivative suit
against Garrido, Araneta and PCB. They sued in their own behalf
and in behalf of Capital Insurance and prayed for annulment of
the loan and the accompanying pledge of the SEF stock on the
ground of breach of trust on the part of Garrido, Araneta and the
latter’s bank. They also accused defendants Garrido and Araneta
of mismanagement of the corporation and prayed for damages
on account thereof.
On April 30, 1985, judgment was rendered by the Trial Court
disposing of the case as follows:

“WHEREFORE, the Court renders judgment declaring the
loan of P600,000.00 obtained by plaintiff Sociedad Europea de
Financiacion, S.A., from defendant Progressive Commercial
Bank, and the promissory note that evidence it, as well as the
pledge of shares of stock of Sociedad Europea de Financiacion,
S.A., in Capital Insurance and Surety Co., Inc. to be void being absolutely simulated and fictitious. The foreclosure of the
said shares, and its acquisition at public auction by defendant
Progressive Commercial Bank are also declared void ab initio.
The writ of preliminary injunction is hereby made permanent,
without bond.
Defendant Progressive Commercial Bank or its successor
in interest is ordered to return the 8,907 shares of Capital
Insurance and Surety Co., Inc. owned by plaintiff Sociedad
Europea Financiacion, S.A. to the possession of said plaintiff,
within five (5) days after finality of this decision. In addition,
the court sentences all the defendants, jointly and severally, to
pay plaintiffs the sum of P100,000.00 as exemplary or corrective damages, plus attorney’s fees in the sum of P50,000.00,

748

DAMAGES

Art. 2229

and costs of suit.’’

The Intermediate Appellate Court affirmed the decision of the
trial court with modification:
“The plaintiffs are ordered to pay Progressive Bank as
compensation for its accommodation an amount equivalent to
the interest, penalties and charges on the ‘loan’ agreed upon.
Cost against all parties, pro-rata.”

Issues: (a) Did the Court of Appeals err in ordering petitioners
to pay Progressive Bank compensation on account of the latter’s
so-called “accommodation loan’’ of P600,000?
(b) Is the award of P100,000 as exemplary damages to the
petitioners adequate?

Held: (1) Unjust to hold petitioners liable to Progressive Bank. —
“The Court finds it inexplicable, not to say ludicrous, unjust and
inequitable, to hold the petitioners liable to, Progressive Bank for,
anything on account of the latter’s so-called ‘accommodation loan’
of P600,000.00, considering that:
1. the proceeds of the loan were immediately placed on time
deposit with the same lending institution;

2. a day after its placement, the time deposit was assigned
to the same Bank, together with all rights to the interest thereon,
full control of the deposit being given to said Bank until the accommodation loan was fully paid;
3. the Bank was at no time under any risk whatsoever, for
an ‘accommodation’ that it could recall at its pleasure because
it retained total control of the loan proceeds under time deposit
with it;

4. while retaining full disposition of the amount fictitiously
loaned, said Bank reserved, and did in fact, exercise rights proper
and appropriate only to the lender under a genuine forbearance,
such as charging interests and, later, even foreclosing on the security
for alleged nonpayment; there is no evidence that it ever set off
interests on the loan with interests that the time deposit should
justly have earned, only a fair arrangement in the circumstances;
5. as found by the trial court and affirmed by the Court of
Appeals, the loan and accompanying pledge were simulated and
the Bank was a party to the simulation.’’

(2) P100,000 exemplary damages increased to P600,000. — “The
Court feels also that the award of P100,000.00 in exemplary or
corrective damages lets the private respondents off too lightly for

Art. 2229

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Exemplary or Corrective Damages

749

the part they played in this sorry affair. Both the Trial Court and
the Court of Appeals found that the defendants had concocted a
scheme ‘to divest plaintiff SEF of its interests in Capital Insurance
and for themselves to own the controlling interest therein,’ and
carried out that illicit objective. Said award of damages should be
increased to P600,000.00.’’ (Sociedad Europea De Financiacion, S.A.
vs. Court of Appeals, 193 SCRA 105 [1991].)

Brief rulings on exemplary damages.
Exemplary damages were awarded in the following cases:

(1) Where a the accused, without a license, operated a dump
truck negligently, and hit a pedestrian who died, to deter others
from taking into their hands a motor vehicle and using it as an
instrument of death. (People vs. Medioso, 62 SCRA 245 [1975].)
(2) Where the petitioner, head of a government college,
through neglect of duty and moral callousness, did not award a
school honor, Magna Cum Laude, to a minor who died. (Ledesma
vs. Court of Appeals, 160 SCRA 449 [1988].)
(3) Where defendants forced the plaintiffs to incur expenses
in several litigations in spite of the fact that the defendants have
known the justness of the plaintiffs claims. (Bacani vs. Galauran,
4 SCRA 1063 [1962].)

(4) Where a first-class passenger was ejected from his seat
and placed in the tourist class, in addition to moral damages.
(Air France vs. Carrascoso, 18 SCRA 155 [1966]; Lopez vs. Pan
American World Airways, 16 SCRA 431 [1966]; TransWorld
Airlines vs. Vinluan, 165 SCRA 143 [1988].)
(5) Where a bus passenger, 26 years old, who was injured
and lost the use of his legs, due to the driver’s negligence, the
exemplary damages not requiring proof and needing allegation because their determination depends upon the amount of
compensatory damages. (Marchan vs. Mendoza, 24 SCRA 888
[1968] and 26 SCRA 731 [1969].)
(6) Where the victim was shot in the jaw by a minor son
with the gun of the father, to remind licensed possessors of
firearms of their duty to take all requisite measures to prevent
minors and other unauthorized persons from having access

750

DAMAGES

Art. 2229

thereto. (Araneta vs. Arreglado, 104 Phil. 529 [1958].)

(7) Where injuries were suffered by the petitioner when she
fell into an open manhole causing her right leg to be fractured,
and to be hospitalized and operated on, in addition to actual
and moral damages. (Guilatco vs. City of Dagupan, 171 SCRA
382 [1989].)
(8) Where the accident was caused by “a driver running
at full speed on a rainy day, on a slippery road in complete
disregard of the hazards to life of other people,’’ in addition
to actual and moral damages and attorney’s fees. (Prudenciado
vs. Alliance Transport System, Inc., 148 SCRA 440 [1987].)
In the cases below, exemplary damages were not allowed.

(1) Where the NAWASA acted in good faith in taking over
the waterworks in question because it assumed that R.A. No.
1383 is constitutional. (NAWASA vs. Catolico, 19 Phil. 980 [1967].)
(2) Where the actual driver of the vehicle involved in an
accident was held liable for exemplary damage, not the owner.
(Rotea vs. Halili, 109 Phil. 495 [1960].)

(3) Where an insurance company, in contesting payment
of an insurance claim, did not act in a wanton, oppressive, or
malevolent manner. (Noda vs. Cruz-Arnaldo, 151 SCRA 227
[1987].)

(4) Where the plaintiff was mistaken in instituting the complaint against the wrong party. (San Miguel Brewery, Inc. vs.
Magno, 21 SCRA 292 [1967].)
Art. 2230. In criminal offenses, exemplary damages as a part of the civil liability may be imposed
when the crime was committed with one or more
aggravating circumstances. Such damages are separate and distinct from fines and shall be paid to the
offended party.
Allowance of exemplary damages
in criminal cases.
(1) Minority view. — In some jurisdictions, recovery of exemplary damages for an injury received in consequence of an

Art. 2229

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Exemplary or Corrective Damages

751

act punishable under the criminal law is denied. The reason
given for this view is that the defendant might otherwise be
twice punished for the same offense. The fact that a criminal
proceeding may never be instituted does not change the rule
or affect the principle involved. (22 Am. Jur. 2d 338.)

(2) Majority view. — In many other jurisdictions, however,
recovery of exemplary or punitive damages will not be denied
merely because the wrongful act upon which the action is based
may be or has been punished criminally.
(a) The court take the position that the allowance of punitive damages in such cases does not violate constitutional
guarantee that no person shall be twice put in jeopardy for
the same offense, or deprived of his property without due
process of law. This is so even though such damages are
recoverable by the State.

(b) It has also been said that exemplary damages in a
civil action are not awarded in lieu of criminal or penal
punishment and have no necessary relation to the penalty
incurred for the wrong done to the public. Even though
exemplary damages are considered as strictly punitive, they
are allowed for the punishment of the private tort rather
than of the public crime, and the same act may be both
an offense, in the sense of crime, against the State and an
offense, in the sense of tort, against a private person, thus
giving to the public and the person aggrieved each a distinct
and concurrent remedy. It follows, where such is the rule,
that a judgment in one case is no bar to a prosecution of the
other. (Ibid.)

Article 2230 qualifiedly follows the prevailing majority rule
in the United States.
Exemplary damages as part of civil liability
in criminal offenses.

(1) Presence of one or more aggravating circumstances. — Under Article 2230, the award of exemplary damages in criminal
offenses as a part of the civil liability, rests in the sound discretion of the court, when the crime was committed with one
or more aggravating circumstances. The award is jusstified if

752

DAMAGES

Art. 2230

there is at least one aggravating circumstance. When granted,
such damages are separate and distinct from fines and shall be
paid to the offended party. In the absence of any aggravating
circumstance, the accused should not be made to pay exemplary
damages.

(2) Allegation/nature of the aggravating circumstances. — Aggravating circumstances, even if not alleged in the information,
can be considered as basis for an award of exemplary damages.
(People vs. Dagami, 415 SCRA 482 [2003].) In a case, since the
qualifying circumstances of the use of a deadly weapon was
present in the commission of the rapes subject of the cases, the
amount of P25,000 as exemplary damages was awarded to the
offended party in each case. (People vs. Manambay, 422 SCRA
43 [2004].)

The ordinary or qualifying nature of an aggravating incumstance is a distinction that is only of consequence to the criminal,
rather than to the civil liability of the offender. The term “aggravating circumstances’’ in Article 2230 must be understood
in its broad or generic sense. It would make little sense for an
award of exemplary damages to be due the private offended
party when the aggravating circumstance is ordinary but to be
withheld when it is qualifying. (People vs. Catubig, 363 SCRA
621 [2001]; People vs. Orilla, 422 SCRA 620 [2004].)
(3) Subsidary liability of employer. — It has been held that
where the case was predicated upon a judgment of conviction
of a driver who was made civilly liable, but no exemplary damages were imposed, it would be unproper to award exemplary
damages against his employer in the subsequent case. The
employer, as a person subsidiarily liable, can not incur greater
civil liability than his convicted employee any more than a
guarantor can be held responsible for more than the principal
debtor. (Bantoto vs. Bobis, 18 SCRA 691 [1966].)
Art. 2231. In quasi-delicts, exemplary damages
may be granted if the defendant acted with gross
negligence.
Award of exemplary damages in quasi-delicts.

Art. 2230

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Exemplary or Corrective Damages

753

As a general rule, exemplary damages are recoverable in
all actions for damages based upon tortious acts which involve
circumstances or ingredients of malice, fraud, insult, gross negligence, or a wanton and reckless disregard of the right of the
plaintiff. (supra.)
Under Article 2231, gross negligence on the part of the defendant must be shown to entitle the plaintiff to an award of
exemplary damages. (Palisoc vs. Bullantes, 41 SCRA 548 [1971].)
The presence of gross negligence is essentially a question of
fact that lies within the province of the trial court. (Corpus vs.
Cuaderno, 13 SCRA 59 [1965].)

In motor vehicle accident cases, exemplary damages may
be awarded where the defendant’s misconduct is so flagrant
as to transcend simple negligence and be tantamount to positive or affirmative misconduct rather than passive or negative
misconduct. In characterizing the requisite positive misconduct
which will support a claim for punitive damages, the courts
have used such descriptive terms as willful, wanton, grossly
negligent, reckless, or malicious, either alone or in combination.
(22 Am. Jur. 2d 334-336.)
Art. 2232. In contracts and quasi-contracts, the
court may award exemplary damages if the defendant
acted in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive,
or malevolent manner.
Award of exemplary damages in contracts
and quasi-contracts.

The claim for exemplary damages in contracts and quasicontracts must presuppose existence of any of the circumstances
mentioned in Article 2232.
As a general rule, damages for breach of contract are limited to the pecuniary loss sustained. That is to say, exemplary
damages are not, ordinarily as a rule, recoverable in actions for
breach of contract.
(1) This rule does not obtain, however, in those exceptional
cases where the breach amounts to an independent, willful tort,
in which event, exemplary damages may be recovered under

754

DAMAGES

Art. 2231

proper allegations of malice, wantonness, or oppression. Such
damages may be awarded for the breach of an obligation not
arising from contract. They are measurable in an action growing out of a breach of contract permeated with tort, where the
injured party elects to waive the contract and recover in tort.
(2) Exemplary damages have also been allowed, under exceptions to the general rule, in actions against a bank for refusal to
pay a customer’s check where it has in its hands funds of the
customer to meet it, and where a real estate broker’s conduct
was deemed to constitute fraud, malice, or oppression toward
his principal.
(3) In some states, they are recoverable in breach of conduct
where there has been some intentional wrong, insult, abuse,
harshness, or such gross neglect of duty as to evince reckless
indifference to the rights of others, or in cases where it is only
accompanied with a fraudulent act. (22 Am. Jur. 2d 337-338.)
ILLUSTRATIVE CASES:
1. As a result of injuries suffered by plaintiff-appellee while riding
as a passenger in a jeepney owned and operated by defendant-appellant,
an action for recovery of damages was filed.
Facts: The trial judge found the driver recklessly negligent.
He drove at an excessive speed, unmindful of the fact that the
road was under repair and heedless of the passengers’ pleas that
he go more slowly.

Besides the award of compensatory damages for actual expenses incurred and loss of income, the defendant, owner of the
vehicle, was ordered to pay P1,000.00 as exemplary damages and
P500.00 as attorney’s fees. On these last two items the defendant
appealed to the Court of Appeal, which rendered a judgment of
affirmance.
Issue: Is the defendant liable for exemplary damages for the
wrongful acts of his driver?

Held: No. (1) Liability of employer for exemplary damages based
upon wrongful act of his employee. — “According to the rule adopted
by many courts, ‘a principal or master can be held liable for
exemplary or punitive damages based upon the wrongful act of
his agent or servant only where he participated in the doing of

Art. 2232

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Exemplary or Corrective Damages

755

such wrongful act or has previously authorized or subsequently
ratified it with full knowledge of the facts.

Reasons given for this rule are that since damages are penal
in character, the motive authorizing their infliction will not be imputed by presumption to the principal when the act is committed
by an agent or servant, and that since they are awarded not by
way of compensation, but as a warning to others, they can only
be awarded against one who has participated in the offense, and
the principal, therefore, cannot be held liable for them merely by
reason of wanton, oppressive or malicious intent on the part of
the agent.’ (15 Am. Jur. 730)’’

(2) Vicarious liability for exemplary damages not contemplated by
law. — “It is difficult to conceive how the defendant in a breach of
contract case could be held to have acted in a wanton, fraudulent,
reckless, oppressive or malevolent manner within the meaning
of Article 2232 for something he did nor did not do after the
breach, which had no causal connection therewith. The law does
not contemplate a vicarious liability on his part: the breach is his
as party to the contract, and so if he is to be held liable at all for
exemplary damages by reason of the wrongful act of his agent, it
must be shown that he had previously authorized or knowingly
ratified it thereafter, in effect making him a co-participated.
From the decision under review, however, there is nothing to
show previous authority or subsequent ratification by appellant
insofar as the recklessness of the driver was concerned. The mere
statement that the defendant failed, even refused, to placate the
suffering of the plaintiff, necessitating the filing of the action, is
too tenuous a basis to warrant the conclusion that the defendant
approved of the wrongful act of his servant with full knowledge
of the facts.’’
(3) Causative negligence personal to the employee. — “It is not
enough to say that an example should be made, or corrective
measures employed, for the public good, especially in accident
cases where public carriers are involved.

For the causative negligence in such cases is personal to the
employees actually in charge of the vehicles, and it is they who
should be made to pay this kind of damages by way of example
or correction, unless by the demonstrated tolerance or approval
of the owners they themselves can be held at fault and their fault
is of the character described in Article 2232 of the Civil Code.
Otherwise there would be practically no difference between their

756

DAMAGES

Art. 2232

liability for exemplary damages and their liability for compensatory damages, which needs no proof of their negligence since
the suit is predicated on breach of contract and due diligence on
their part does not constitute a defense.’’ (Munsayac vs. De Lara,
23 SCRA 1086 [1968].)
_______ _______ _______
2. An airline passenger’s accommodation was upgraded from Business Class to First Class against the objection of the passenger because
he was traveling with two friends.

Facts: As part of its marketing strategy, Cathay Pacific Airways, Ltd. accords its frequent flyers membership in its Marco
Polo Club. The members enjoy several privileges, such as priority
for upgrading of booking without any extra charge whenever an
opportunity arises. Thus, a frequent flyer booked in the Business
Class has priority for upgrading to First Class if the Business Class
Section is fully booked. Respondent spouses (Vasquezes) are Gold
Card members of its Marco Polo Club.

For their return flight to Manila from Hongkong, the respondent
spouses and their two (2) friends proceeded to the Business Class
passenger lounge. When a ground attendant (Ms. Chiu) glanced at
the computer monitor, she saw a message that there was a “seat
change” from Business Class to First Class for the Vazquezes.
Ms. Chiu approached Dr. Vazquez and told him that the
Vazquezes’ accommodations were upgraded to First Class. Dr.
Vazquez refused the upgrade, reasoning that it would not look
nice for them as hosts to travel in First Class and their guests,
in the Business Class; and moreover, they were going to discuss
business matters during the flight. He also told Ms. Chiu that
she could have other passengers instead transferred to the First
Class Section.
Taken aback by the refusal for upgrading, Ms. Chiu consulted
her supervisor, who told her to handle the situation and convince
the Vazquezes to accept the upgrading. Ms. Chiu informed the
latter that the Business Class was fully booked, and that since
they were Marco Polo Club members they had the priority to be
upgraded to the First Class. Dr. Vazquez continued to refuse, so
Ms. Chiu told them that if they would not avail themselves of the
privilege, they would not be allowed to take the flight. Eventually,
after talking to his two friends, Dr. Vazquez gave in. He and Mrs.
Vazquez then proceeded to the First Class Cabin.

Art. 2232

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Exemplary or Corrective Damages

757

The respondents instituted before the regional trial court an
action for damages against Cathay, praying for the payment to
each of them the amounts of P250,000 as temperate damages;
P500,000 as moral damages; P500,000 as exemplary or corrective
damages; and P250,000 as attorney’s fees.

In their complaint, the Vazquezes alleged that when they informed Ms. Chiu that they preferred to stay in Business Class, Ms.
Chiu “obstinately, uncompromisingly and in a loud, discourteous
and harsh voice threatened” that they could not board and leave
with the flight unless they go to First Class, since the Business
Class was overbooked. Ms. Chiu’s loud and stringent shouting
annoyed, embarrassed, and humiliated them because the incident
was witnessed by all the other passengers waiting for boarding.

They also claimed that they were unjustifiably delayed to
board the plane, and when they were finally permitted to get into
the aircraft, the forward storage compartment was already full. A
flight stewardess instructed Dr. Vazquez to put his roll-on luggage
in the overhead storage compartment. Because he was not assisted
by any of the crew in putting up his luggage, his bilateral carpal
tunnel syndrome was aggravated, causing him extreme pain on
his arm and wrist. The Vazquezes also averred that they “belong
to the uppermost and absolutely top elite of both Philippine Society and the Philippine financial community, [and that] they were
among the wealthiest persons in the Philippines.”
In its answer, Cathay alleged that it is a practice among commercial airlines to upgrade passengers to the next better class of
accommodation, whenever an opportunity arises, such as when a
certain section is fully booked. Priority in upgrading is given to
its frequent flyers, who are considered favored passengers like the
Vazquezes. Thus, when the Business Class Section of Flight CX905 was fully booked, Cathay’s computer sorted out the names of
favored passengers for involuntary upgrading to First Class. When
Ms. Chiu informed the Vazquezes that they were upgraded to First
Class, Dr. Vazquez refused. He then stood at the entrance of the
boarding apron, blocking the queue of passengers from boarding
the plane, which inconvenienced other passengers. He shouted that
it was impossible for him and his wife to be upgraded without
his two friends who were traveling with them.

Because of Dr. Vazquez’s outburst, Ms. Chiu thought of upgrading the traveling companions of the Vazquezes. But when she
checked the computer, she learned that the Vazquezes’ companions

758

DAMAGES

Art. 2232

did not have priority for upgrading. She then tried to book the
Vazquezes again to their original seats. However, since the Business Class Section was already fully booked, she politely informed
Dr. Vazquez of such fact and explained that the upgrading was in
recognition of their status as Cathay’s valued passengers. Finally,
after talking to their guests, the Vazquezes eventually decided to
take the First Class accommodation.

Cathay also asserted that its employees at the Hong Kong
airport acted in good faith in dealing with the Vazquezes; none
of them shouted, humiliated, embarrassed, or committed any act
of disrespect against them (the Vazquezes). Assuming that there
was indeed a breach of contractual obligation, Cathay acted in
good faith, which negates any basis for their claim for temperate, moral, and exemplary damages and attorney’s fees. Hence,
it prayed for the dismissal of the complaint and for payment of
P100,000 for exemplary damages and P300,000 as attorney’s fees
and litigation expenses.
The trial court found for the respondents and ordered Cathay
to pay each plaintiff the following:
“a) Nominal damages in the amount of P100,000.00 for
each plaintiff;

b) Moral damages in the amount of P2,000,000.00 for
each plaintiff;

c) Exemplary damages in the amount of P5,000,000.00
for each plaintiff;
d) Attorney’s fees and expenses of litigation in the amount
of P1,000,000.00 for each plaintiff; and
e) Costs of suit.’’

On appeal, the Court of Appeals, in its decision of July 24,
2001, deleted the award for exemplary damages; and it reduced the
awards for moral and nominal damages for each of the Vazquezes
to P250,000 and P50,000, respectively, and the attorney’s fees and
litigation expenses to P50,000 for both of them.
Issues: The key issues for our consideration are whether:

(a) by upgrading the seat accommodation of the Vazquezes
from Business Class to First Class, Cathay breached its contract
of carriage with the Vazquezes;
(b) the upgrading was tainted with fraud or bad faith; and

Art. 2232

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Exemplary or Corrective Damages

759

(c) the Vazquezes are entitled to damages.

Held: (1) Legal effect of the upgrading of the seat accommodation.
— “Breach of contract is defined as the ‘failure without legal reason
to comply with the terms of a contract.’ It is also defined as the
‘[f]ailure, without legal excuse, to perform any promise which
forms the whole or part of the contract.’

In previous cases, the breach of contract of carriage consisted in
either the bumping off of a passenger with confirmed reservation
or the downgrading of a passenger’s seat accommodation from
one class to a lower class. In this case, what happened was the
reverse. The contract between the parties was for Cathay to transport the Vazquezes to Manila on a Business Class accommodation
in Flight CX-905. After checking-in their luggage at the Kai Tak
Airport in Hong Kong, the Vazquezes were given boarding cards
indicating their seat assignments in the Business Class Section.

However, during the boarding time, when the Vazquezes
presented their boarding passes, they were informed that they
had a seat change from Business Class to First Class. It turned
out that the Business Class was overbooked in that there were
more passengers than the number of seats. Thus, the seat assignments of the Vazquezes were given to waitlisted passengers, and
the Vazquezes, being members of the Marco Polo Club, were
upgraded from Business Class to First Class.
We note that in all their pleadings, the Vazquezes never denied
that they were members of Cathay’s Marco Polo Club. They knew
that as members of the Club, they had priority for upgrading of
their seat accommodation at no extra cost when an opportunity
arises. But, just like other privileges, such priority could be waived.

The Vazquezes should have been consulted first whether they
wanted to avail themselves of the privilege or would consent to a
change of seat accommodation before their seat assignments were
given to other passengers. Normally, one would appreciate and
accept an upgrading, for it would mean a better accommodation.
But, whatever their reason was and however odd it might be, the
Vazquezes had every right to decline the upgrade and insist on
the Business Class accommodation they had booked for and which
was designated in their boarding passes. They clearly waived their
priority or preference when they asked that other passengers be
given the upgrade. It should not have been imposed on them over
their vehement objection. By insisting on the upgrade, Cathay
breached its contract of carriage with the Vazquezes.’’

760

DAMAGES

Art. 2232

(2) The upgrading was not attended by fraud or bad faith. —
“Bad faith and fraud are allegations of fact that demand clear
and convincing proof. They are serious accusations that can be
so conveniently and casually invoked, and that is why they are
never presumed. They amount to mere slogans or mudslinging
unless convincingly substantiated by whoever is alleging them.
Fraud has been defined to include an inducement through
insidious machination. Insidious machination refers to a deceitful
scheme or plot with an evil or devious purpose. Deceit exists
where the party, with intent to deceive, conceals or omits to state
material facts and, by reason of such omission or concealment, the
other party was induced to give consent that would not otherwise
have been given.
Bad faith does not simply connote bad judgment or negligence;
it imports a dishonest purpose or some moral obliquity and conscious doing of a wrong, a breach of a known duty through some
motive or interest or ill will that partakes of the nature of fraud.

We find no persuasive proof of fraud or bad faith in this
case. The Vazquezes were not induced to agree to the upgrading through insidious words or deceitful machination or through
willful concealment of material facts. Upon boarding, Ms. Chiu
told the Vazquezes that their accommodations were upgraded to
First Class in view of their being Gold Card members of Cathay’s
Marco Polo Club. She was honest in telling them that their seats
were already given to other passengers and the Business Class
Section was fully booked. Ms. Chiu might have failed to consider
the remedy of offering the First Class seats to other passengers.
But, we find no bad faith in her failure to do so, even if that
amounted to an exercise of poor judgment.
Neither was the transfer of the Vazquezes effected for some
evil or devious purpose. As testified to by Mr. Robson, the First
Class Section is better than the Business Class Section in terms of
comfort, quality of food, and service from the cabin crew; thus,
the difference in fare between the First Class and Business Class
at that time was $250. Needless to state, an upgrading is for the
better condition and, definitely, for the benefit of the passenger.’’
(3) Requisites for award of moral damages. — “Although incapable
of pecuniary computation, moral damages may be recovered if they
are the proximate result of the defendant’s wrongful act or omission.
Thus, case law establishes the following requisites for the award of
moral damages: (1) there must be an injury clearly sustained by the

Art. 2232

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Exemplary or Corrective Damages

761

claimant, whether physical, mental or psychological; (2) there must
be a culpable act or omission factually established; (3) the wrongful act or omission of the defendant is the proximate cause of the
injury sustained by the claimant; and (4) the award for damages
is predicated on any of the cases stated in Article 2219 of the Civil
Code.’’

(4) Recovery of moral damages predicated upon breach of contract. —
“Moral damages predicated upon a breach of contract of carriage
may only be recoverable in instances where the carrier is guilty of
fraud or bad faith or where the mishap resulted in the death of a
passenger. Where in breaching the contract of carriage the airline
is not shown to have acted fraudulently or in bad faith, liability
for damages is limited to the natural and probable consequences
of the breach of the obligation which the parties had foreseen or
could have reasonably foreseen. In such a case the liability does
not include moral and exemplary damages.

In this case, we have ruled that the breach of contract of
carriage, which consisted in the involuntary upgrading of the
Vazquezes’ seat accommodation, was not attended by fraud or
bad faith. The Court of Appeals’ award of moral damages has,
therefore, no leg to stand on.’’

(5) Deletion of award for exemplary damages. — “The deletion
of the award for exemplary damages by the Court of Appeals is
correct.
It is a requisite in the grant of exemplary damages that the
act of the offender must be accompanied by bad faith or done in
wanton, fraudulent or malevolent manner. Such requisite is absent
in this case. Moreover, to be entitled thereto the claimant must first
establish his right to moral, temperate, or compensatory damages.
Since the Vazquezes are not entitled to any of these damages, the
award for exemplary damages has no legal basis. And where the
awards for moral and exemplary damages are eliminated, so must
the award for attorney’s fees.’’

(6) Award of nominal damages for breach of contract. — “The
most that can be adjudged in favor of the Vazquezes for Cathay’s
breach of contract is an award for nominal damages under Article
2221 of the Civil Code. x x x
Worth noting is the fact that in Cathay’s Memorandum filed
with this Court, it prayed only for the deletion of the award for
moral damages. It deferred to the Court of Appeals’ discretion in
awarding nominal damages; thus:

762

DAMAGES

Art. 2232

‘As far as the award of nominal damages is concerned,
petitioner respectfully defers to the Honorable Court of Appeals’ discretion. Aware as it is that somehow, due to the
resistance of respondents-spouses to the normally-appreciated
gesture of petitioner to upgrade their accommodations, petitioner may have disturbed the respondents-spouses’ wish to
be with their companions (who traveled to Hong Kong with
them) at the Business Class on their flight to Manila. Petitioner
regrets that in its desire to provide the respondents-spouses
with additional amenities for the one and one-half (1 1/2)
hour flight to Manila, unintended tension ensued.’

Nonetheless, considering that the breach was intended to
give more benefit and advantage to the Vazquezes by upgrading
their Business Class accommodation to First Class because of their
valued status as Marco Polo members, we reduce the award for
nominal damages to P5,000.’’

(7) Observation of the Court of Appeals regarding awards adjudged
by the trial court. — “Before writing finis to this decision, we find
it well-worth to quote the apt observation of the Court of Appeals
regarding the awards adjudged by the trial court:
‘We are not amused but alarmed at the lower court’s
unbelievable alacrity, bordering on the scandalous, to award
excessive amounts as damages. In their complaint, appellees
asked for P1 million as moral damages but the lower court
awarded P4 million; they asked for P500,000.00 as exemplary
damages but the lower court cavalierly awarded a whooping
P10 million; they asked for P250,000.00 as attorney’s fees but
were awarded P2 million; they did not ask for nominal damages but were awarded P200,000.00.
It is as if the lower court went on a rampage, and why
it acted that way is beyond all tests of reason. In fact the
excessiveness of the total award invites the suspicion that it
was the result of ‘prejudice or corruption on the part of the
trial court.’

The presiding judge of the lower court is enjoined to hearken
to the Supreme Court’s admonition in Singson vs. CA (89 SCAD
172, 282 SCRA 149 [1997]), where it said:
‘The well-entrenched principle is that the grant of moral
damages depends upon the discretion of the court based on
the circumstances of each case. This discretion is limited by

Art. 2232

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Exemplary or Corrective Damages

763

the principle that the amount awarded should not be palpably
and scandalously excessive as to indicate that it was the result
of prejudice or corruption on the part of the trial court….’

and in Alitalia Airways vs. CA (187 SCRA 763 [1990], where it
was held:
‘Nonetheless, we agree with the injunction expressed
by the Court of Appeals that passengers must not prey on
international airlines for damage awards, like ‘trophies in a
safari.’ After all neither the social standing nor prestige of the
passenger should determine the extent to which he would
suffer because of a wrong done, since the dignity affronted in
the individual is a quality inherent in him and not conferred
by these social indicators.’

We adopt as our own this observation of the Court of Appeals.’’

3. Defendant had refused deliberately and wantonly to pay plaintiff
what is justly due to the latter.
Facts: Plaintiff seeks to recover moral damages for the alleged
wanton refusal of the defendants to pay their just obligation to
the plaintiff and for taking advantage of the plaintiff’s good faith.

The records of this case disclose that the defendant, in utter
disregard of the rights of the plaintiff, had refused deliberately and
wantonly to pay the plaintiff what is justly due. The installation of
the bowling alleys, together with their equipment, and the billiard
tables had brought the defendant a lucrative income from the year
of its opening in 1951, and yet outside of the down payment which
defendant had paid on the 18 bowling alleyes, defendant had absolutely refused without just cause, to pay the balance thereof and the
cost of the bowling and billliard accessories — this notwithstanding
that the defendant had promised to pay the balance of the price of the
bowling alleys in installments, the first installment to be paid on the
day that the plaintiff would commence work on the bowling alleys.
Defendant, taking advantage of the plaintiff’s good faith,
requested a deferment of the payment until the installation shall
have been completed; but the installation having been completed,
defendants under one pretext or another, refused without just cause
to pay what is due the plaintiff. Not only that, but defendant’s
attitude towards the plaintiff was characterized by arrogance and
his letters are replete with unsavory and discourteous remarks,

764

DAMAGES

Art. 2232

which demonstrate not only the character of the man but reveal
his lack of intention to pay defendant’s just obligation.
Issue: Is the plaintiff entitled to damages?

Held: (1) Actual, moral, and exemplary damages. — “Plaintiff is
entitled to actual damages consisting in the payment of interest
and attorney’s fees, and considering that the defendants had acted
wantonly, oppressively, if not fraudulently, in the performance of
their obligation, plaintiff is likewise entitled to moral and exemplary damages, which the court fixes in the amount of P20,000.00.’’

(2) Right to attorney’s fees. — “Under the first cause of action,
plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees, since plaintiff, in accordance
with Article 2208 of the New Civil Code, has been awarded exemplary damages, and because defendant acted in gross and evident
had faith in refusing to satisfy the plaintiff’s plainly valid, just
and demandable claim, and it is just and equitable that attorney’s
fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered.
Considering the lengthy pleadings, the voluminous records,
the lengthy and protracted trial, and the professional standing of
counsel, the Court hereby charges the defendants with the payment of attorney’s fees in the amount of P15,000.00.’’ (Pan Pacific
Co. [Phil.] vs. Phil. Advertising Corporation, 23 SCRA 977 [1968].)

Art. 2233. Exemplary damages cannot be recovered as a matter of right; the court will decide
whether or not they should be adjudicated.
Discretion of court to award exemplary damages.
(1) Article 2233 quite clearly states that exemplary damages
cannot be recovered as a matter of right. Their adjudication
is at the discretion of the court. Thus, no exemplary damages
were awarded where the passenger who fell from a speeding,
overcrowded train was guilty of contributory negligence (Phil.
National Railway vs. Court of Appeals, 139 SCRA 87 [1985].), or
where the claimant was not entitled to moral damages (Estopea
vs. Pransay, Jr., 109 Phil. 640 [1960].), or where the defendant
acted in good faith. (NAWASA vs. Calotico, 19 SCRA 980 [1967].)

(2) Courts will grant them if the defendant has acted “with
gross negligence’’ (Art. 2231.), or “in a wanton, fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner’’ (Art. 2232.) in disregard

Art. 2232

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Exemplary or Corrective Damages

765

of his obligation. They were awarded where there is an abuse
of public position (People vs. Reyes, 69 SCRA 474 [1976].), or
wanton refusal to pay a just and valid debt (Ribaya vs. Carbonell, 95 SCRA 672 [1980].), or a mistake in the transmission
of telegraph. (RCPI, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 103 SCRA 359
[1981].)
(3) The appellate court may reduce or increase the amount
of exemplary damages granted by a lower court. (see Osmeña
vs. Court of Appeals, 120 SCRA 395 [1983].)
Art. 2234. While the amount of the exemplary
damages need not be proved, the plaintiff must
show that he is entitled to moral, temperate or compensatory damages before the court may consider
the question of whether or not exemplary damages
should be awarded. In case liquidated damages
have been agreed upon, although no proof of loss
is necessary in order that such liquidated damages
may be recovered, nevertheless, before the court
may consider the question of granting exemplary
in addition to the liquidated damages, the plaintiff
must show that he would be entitled to moral, temperate or compensatory damages were it not for the
stipulation for liquidated damages.
Proof of amount of exemplary damages.
Article 2234 lays down the following rules:

(1) The amount of exemplary damages need not be proved
to be entitled thereto but the plaintiff must show that he is
entitled to moral, temperate, or compensatory damages; and
(2) Where liquidated damages have been agreed upon, the
plaintiff must show that he would be entitled also to moral,
temperate, or compensatory damages were it not for the stipulation for liquidated damages.
Exemplary damages may be imposed by way of example
or correction only in addition, among others, to compensatory
damages, (Art. 229.) but they cannot be recovered as a matter

766

DAMAGES

Art. 2232

of right, their determination depending upon the discretion
of the court. (Art. 2233.) The amount of exemplary damages
need not be proved, because its determination depends upon
the amount of compensatory damages that may be awarded to
the claimant. (Merchan vs. Mendoza, 26 SCRA 731 [1969], citing
Singson vs. Aragon, 92 Phil. 518 [1953].)
Allegation of amount of exemplary
damages.
If the amount of exemplary damages need not be proved,
it need not also be alleged. The reason is obvious; it is merely
incidental or dependent upon what the court may award as
compensatory damages. Unless and until this premise is determined and established, what may be claimed as exemplary
damages would amount to mere surmise or speculation.
It follows as a necessary consequence that the amount of
exemplary damages need not be pleaded in the complaint because the same cannot be predetermined. One can merely ask
that it be determined by the court if in the use of its discretion
the same is warranted by the evidence. (Ibid.)
Art. 2235. A stipulation whereby exemplary damages are renounced in advance shall be null and void.
Waiver of exemplary damages.
A party to a contract cannot renounce or waive in advance
the liability of the other party to exemplary damages. Such a
stipulation is null and void for being contrary to public policy
“to suppress wanton acts’’ and to provide an example or correction for the public good.
Article 2235 is similar to Article 1171 which provides:

“Responsibility arising from fraud is demandable in all
obligations. Any waiver of an action for future fraud is void.’’
A contrary rule would encourage the perpetration of
fraud because the obligor knows that even if he should
commit fraud he would not be liable for it thus making the

Arts. 2233-2234

OTHER KINDS OF DAMAGES
Exemplary or Corrective Damages

767

obligation illusory. Generally, an action for future negligence
may be renounced because it is not as serious as fraud
because there is no deliberate intention to cause injury or
damages. However, where the negligence is gross or show
bad faith, it is equivalent to fraud. Any waiver of an action
for future negligence of this kind, is, therefore, void. (De
Leon & De Leon, Jr., Comments and, Cases on Obligations
and Contracts, 2003 Ed., pp. 60-61.)
