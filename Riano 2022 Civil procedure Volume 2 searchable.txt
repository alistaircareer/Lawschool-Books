ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
My Father worked tirelessly on his books, doggedly
revisiting and updating them. After his passing, I wanted
to ensure I found the right people to continue his work,
who would update his books as if they were their own. My
father poured his heart and soul into his books - they are his
legacy. I’m eternally grateful to have found the right people
to continue that legacy. I would like to thank all who, in one
way or another, contributed to the completion of these latest

editions.

“Basta para kay Dean...”. This was the answer I received
when I asked a close colleague in the legal industry of my
Father’s to update Civil Procedure I and Civil Procedure II.
I am very fortunate that there are those, like you, who still
think very fondly of him. Thank you for all your hard work
and dedication to this project. But, most importantly, I thank
you for remembering my father with kindness and warmth. I
think, aside from his books, he should also be remembered for
the person he was.
My sincere thanks also go out to Lee Anne Joy Torno
and her team at REX. You were an irreplaceable partner in
this first endeavor of mine to update my father’s books. Your
guidance and assistance throughout this whole process went
above and beyond and for that, I want to thank you from the
bottom of my heart.

To the readers, as always, these books are for you. My
Father wrote these books for his students as a guide to help
them achieve their dreams of becoming lawyers. I hope you
find in these pages the spark that ignites your instinct to
succeed in your endeavor. Best wishes and good luck!

PREFACE

Thia humble work is the second volume of a two-volume
material in Civil Procedure. This latest edition incorporates
the relevant laws newly passed as well as most recent
pronouncements of the Supreme Court. Like its previous
editions, its aim is to present the legalese found in the Rules
of Court in a simplified manner to enable the student of law to
grasp the essential concepts in Remedial Law. However, this
is more than that...much more.
This is a nod to my father’s wishes to craft his work in a
way that would tremendously benefit the law students and bar
reviewees. As my father would have wanted, this is made to
equip his intended readers with important tools which would
greatly help them in passing the annual bar examinations.
That has always been his first and foremost goal.

VI

A DAUGHTER’S MESSAGE TO THE READERS
I humbly present to you my father’s last and greatest works.
These editions are very special to me, since contained in these pages
are my father’s last words and part of the legacy that he left to the
world. Much of the writing was done in my home, surrounded by
family. My father would hunker down in front of his laptop and
write tirelessly from morning to night, taking breaks throughout
the day to play with his grandson, Christopher, or chat with me. It
was during these times that I saw my Dad’s passion for his books, as
well as his deep compassion for his students. It showed in the effort
that he took to craft each sentence, each paragraph, and each page,
so that nothing would be lost in the translation of the law. He would
read me excerpts and ask if, as a layman, I understood what he was
trying to get across. I think that was always his measure of success
for his writing: if a person, like me, with no education in the law,
could understand the concept he was trying to explain, then he was
on the right path.
This is the common thread in the books my father authored: to
simplify law concepts in a manner that is easy to grasp. He took the
most daunting law subjects, and presented them in such a way that
they became less the behemoth than they were previously thought.
He transferred, through the pages, his innate understanding of
Remedial Law subjects in a way that made it easier for his readers
to understand.

To his readers, I hope you find inspiration in these pages to
persevere and be one step closer to your dreams. I hope you find
within yourself the “homicidal instinct” to succeed, and the strength
and faith to stay in your chosen path. In the words of my dad, “Believe
in what you are now. Have faith in what you shall become. Dreams
come true with faith.”

PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Preliminaries
Nature of provisional remedies
1. Provisional remedies are temporary, auxiliary, and
ancillary remedies available to a litigant while the main
action is pending or until a final disposition of the matter
in litigation is made. Such remedies are dependent for their
application upon the existence of a principal action. Hence,
without a principal action, provisional remedies would find no
legal application. Because provisional remedies depend on a
principal action for their efficacy, the dismissal of a principal
action or its resolution will render the provisional remedies
therein ineffective.

2. These remedies are provisional because they
constitute temporary measures availed of during the pendency
of the main action and are ancillary because they are merely
incidents and are dependent upon the result of the main action
(See Raymundo v. Court of Appeals, 213 SCRA 457, 461). For
instance, a preliminary injunction, like any preliminary writ
and any interlocutory order, cannot survive the main case
of which it is an incident. An ancillary writ of preliminary
injunction loses its force and effect after the decision in the
main petition (Zuneca Pharmaceutical v. Natrapharm, Inc.,
G.R. No. 197802, November 11, 2015). Hence, when the main
action is dismissed, the provisional remedy is also dissolved.
(Bar 2002)

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Provisional remedies are not causes of action in
themselves but merely adjuncts to a main suit (Estares v.
Court of Appeals, 459 SCRA 604, 618).
3.

Purpose of provisional remedies (Bar 1996)

Provisional remedies are resorted to by litigants for any
or a combination of the following reasons:
(a) To preserve or protect their rights or interests while

the main action is pending;
(b) To secure the judgment;
,
(c) To preserve the status quo; or
(d) To preserve the subject matter of the action.

Illustrations
1. Imagine a debtor owing his creditor a substantial
amount of money and the obligation is now due. The creditor
demands payment and sues when the debtor fails to pay.
Before the suit is filed, the creditor obtains evidence that the
debtor had been selling his property with the intent to defraud
him.

Is there a way to prevent the debtor from disposing of
his remaining property? There is a way provided for under
the Rules. Under Rule 57 of the Rules of Court, at the
commencement of the action or at any time before the entry
of judgment, the creditor may have the property of the debtor
attached so such property will be placed under the custody
of the court and, thus, prevent the debtor from disposing
of or concealing the same to the prejudice of the creditor.
The attachment, called preliminary, is aimed to secure the
satisfaction of any judgment that may be rendered by the
court favorable to the creditor. The provisional remedy
under
this situation is called a preliminary attachment
while the
mam action is a suit for a sum of money.

Without this provisional remedy, the creditor, despite
prevailing m the suit, may find himself with only
an empty bag,

PART I

REMEDIES
— PROVISIONAL
Preliminaries

and without any means to collect from the debtor who, during
the litigation, had already disposed of all of his property.
2. Consider also a situation where the plaintiff¬
mortgagee files an action to foreclose a real estate mortgage
against the defendant-mortgagor. The building subject of the
mortgage is rapidly depreciating in value because of the gross
neglect of the mortgagor so that if the judgment rendered
later turns out to be favorable to the mortgagee, the value of
the property would be insufficient to discharge the mortgage
debt.

May the mortgagee avail of a provisional remedy while
the action is pending to prevent the further deterioration of
the property? Under existing rules, he may avail of a remedy
even before the finality of the proceedings by applying for
the appointment of a receiver who will be tasked with the
administration and preservation of the property. The main
action, in this example, is the action to foreclose the mortgage.
The provisional remedy is receivership under Rule 59 of the
Rules of Court.
3. Assume that a person enters the land of another
by stealth or strategy with intent to acquire permanent
possession of the same. To protect his rights over the property,
the owner files an action to recover the physical possession of
the land against the intruder. The latter resists and interposes
a prior right of possession through a series of transfers from
the original possessor whose right allegedly antedates the
plaintiff’s right.

As a result of the intrusion, the plaintiff is not in
possession of the property while the action is pending. It is in
the possession of someone who may even be willing to employ
force to retain possession of the land. The plaintiff cannot put
the land into productive use. If the land is the only source of
livelihood of the plaintiff, delays in the resolution of the case
would cause his family possible irreparable economic injury.

Under the above circumstances, does the plaintiff have
to wait for the rendition of a final judgment adverse to the
intruder before he can regain possession of the land? Is there

4

— PROVISIONAL
Preliminaries

6

any remedy available to him to regain possession of the land
while the case is pending?
Fortunately, the plaintiff does not have to agonizingly
wait for the court to finally adjudge possession in his favor.
The plaintiff may avail of a remedy under the Rules to obtain
the possession of the property while the main action is being
litigated. The court may, upon proper application by the
plaintiff, order the defendant to surrender the possession
of the property to the plaintiff even before the main case is

Under the circumstances, does the child have to wait for
the final adjudication of the issue of his entitlement to support
before he receives the relief prayed for in his complaint?
Applicable rules clearly supply an answer to the question and
meet the need for an interim relief. While the principal action
for support is pending, he may apply for support pendente lite
or support pending the resolution of the case pursuant to Rule
61 of the Rules of Court. Here, support pendente lite is the
provisional remedy and the action for support, the principal

resolved.

action.

Under prevailing law and jurisprudence, the intrusion
on the land by the defendant constitutes an actionable wrong
called forcible entry. In this cause of action, a person is
deprived by another of the possession of any land or building
by force, intimidation, threat, strategy, or stealth (See Sec. 2,
Rule 70, Rules of Court). Under Sec. 15 of Rule 70, a possessor
deprived of his possession through forcible entry may, within
5 days from the filing of the complaint, present a motion in
the action for the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction to restore him in his possession. The main action in
the illustration is forcible entry while the provisional remedy
is preliminary mandatory injunction, the latter being merely
ancillary to the former.

5. Imagine Mr. DD who borrows the car of Mr. PP. Mr.
DD promises to return the car after three days but reneges
on his promise. Mr. DD alleges that the car has actually been
pledged to him by Mr. PP, who, in turn, denies the pledge. The
latter files an action to recover possession of the car. Mr. DD
resists the claim and is ready for a protracted litigation. If the
car is being used by Mr. PP as an economic tool, may he have
the car’s possession restored to him in the meantime that the
main case has not yet been finally resolved? He may. Under
Rule 60 of the Rules, a person praying for the recovery of
possession of personal property may, at the commencement of
the action or at any time before answer, apply for an order for
the delivery of such property to him through the provisional
remedy of replevin, alleging among others, that the property
is wrongfully detained by the adverse party.

The order of the court, however, partakes only of an
interim remedy because if the evidence adduced in the
proceedings unequivocally shows that it is the defendant
who is rightfully entitled to the possession of the land, then a
judgment awarding the possession to the defendant will have
to be rendered by the court. The possession which the court
may grant to the plaintiff, during the pendency of the action,
is one that is a mere provisional or temporary possession.
4. Consider, too, the case of an illegitimate
minor
child who, with the assistance of his mother, files an action
for support against his natural father. The plaintiff-child
is
impoverished, the mother being sick, jobless,
and poor. For
the minor child, survival is a challenge he
must face on a daily
basis.

Court with jurisdiction over provisional remedies
1. The court which grants or issues a provisional remedy
is the court which has jurisdiction over the main action. Thus,
where the main case is pending in a specific Regional Trial
Court, it is this same court, not any other court, which may
grant the provisional remedy applied for. A court cannot grant
a provisional remedy where it has no jurisdiction over the
principal action.

In one case, it was declared in the clearest of terms that
“Since the RTC had no jurisdiction over the Petition x x x then
it was also devoid of any authority to act on the application

2. The authority to grant a provisional remedy is not
the sole prerogative of superior courts. Even inferior courts
may grant a provisional remedy in an action pending with
it and within its jurisdiction. Under B.P. 129, as amended,
the jurisdiction of the Municipal Trial Court includes “the
grant of provisional remedies in proper cases” (Sec. 33(1], B.P.
129, The Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, as amended).
Hence, under Sec. 15 of Rule 70, a Municipal Trial Court may
grant preliminary injunction in an action for forcible entry or
unlawful detainer, to prevent the defendant from committing
further acts of dispossession against the plaintiff. As earlier
mentioned, pursuant to the same provision, the court may
also issue a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction to a
possessor deprived of his possession through forcible entry
or unlawful detainer to restore him in his possession upon
proper application filed within 5 days from the filing of the
complaint.
3. Where the principal action is for specific perform ance,
any provisional remedy applied for in the case can only be
issued by the Regional Trial Court hearing the same case.
The provisional remedy cannot be issued by a Municipal Trial
Court which has no jurisdiction over an action incapable of
pecuniary estimation (Sec. 19(1], B.P. 129, as amended), like
an action for specific performance.
4. Where the main action is to recover the amount of
P5 million from a debtor who is disposing of his assets with
intent to defraud his creditor, a Municipal Trial Court has no
jurisdiction to issue a writ of preliminary attachment because
the principal action, by reason of the amount involved, is not
within its jurisdiction (Sec. 19[8], B.P. 129, as amended).

5. Where the main action is one for support, the
provisional remedy of support pendente lite may not be

REMEDIES
— PROVISIONAL
Preliminaries

7

granted by a Municipal Trial Court because the main action is
one within the jurisdiction of the Family Court (Sec. 5[e], R.A.
8369).

6. Where the action is one for action publiciana
involving a real property with an assessed value of P100,000.00,
any provisional remedy applied for may be granted only by
the Municipal Trial Court where the action is pending. It
cannot be issued by a Regional Trial Court because it has no
jurisdiction over the action. The principal action, by reason
of the assessed value of the property, is one cognizable by the
Municipal Trial Court (Sec. 33(3], B.P. 129, as amended).
7. Where support pendente lite is sought for by the
victim for her offspring in a criminal prosecution for rape
against the alleged father of her child, the Municipal Trial
Court has no jurisdiction to issue the provisional remedy, rape
being within the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court.
8. A party appealing from the judgment of the Court
of Tax Appeals can apply for a provisional remedy during the
appeal, only with the Supreme Court which has jurisdiction
over the appeal.

9. Where a petition for certiorari is pending in the
Court of Appeals directed against an order of the Regional
Trial Court, any application for a provisional remedy shall be
filed with the Court of Appeals where the petition is pending.

The above enumeration does not represent an
exclusive list of provisional remedies. There are provisional
remedies (interim reliefs) provided for in other rules and laws.

2.

3. Provisional remedies may also be availed of in
criminal actions pursuant to Rule 127 of the Rules of Court.
4. Provisional remedies may also be granted in the
exercise of the court’s equity jurisdiction (Reyes v. Lim, 408
SCRA 560, 566-567) where no specific provisional remedy is
provided for by the Rules in a particular case.
Deposit as a provisional remedy in the exercise of equity
jurisdiction of the court

In an action for specific performance and nullification of
sale and title plus damages, the buyer moved that the seller
be ordered to deposit with the cashier of the trial court the
PIO million down payment on the land which was paid by the
buyer. The motion was filed to prevent the dissipation of the
amount pending the resolution of the case.
The seller opposed the motion, pointing out that deposit
is not among the provisional remedies enumerated in the 1997
Rules of Civil Procedure. He argued that the enumeration
in the Rules is exclusive and that not one of the provisional
remedies in Rules 57 to 61 applies to the case. He further
contended that a court cannot apply the principle of equity
and require deposit if the law already prescribes the specific
provisional remedies which do not include deposit. He,
likewise, invoked the principle that equity is “applied only
in the absence of, and never against, statutory law or x x x
judicial rules of procedure.” The seller, likewise, insisted that
the fact that the provisional remedies do not include deposit is
a matter of dura lex sed lex.

While conceding that deposit is not among the provisional
remedies in the Rules of Court, the Supreme Court held,
nevertheless, that the facts represent a case where there is
a hiatus in the law and in the Rules of Court. If
left alone,
declared the Court, the hiatus will result in unjust
enrichment
to the seller at the expense of the buyer. The
hiatus may also

imperil restitution, which is a precondition to any annulment
or rescission of a contract. The Court ruled emphatically that
the case is not one of equity overruling a positive provision
of law or judicial rule for there is no rule that governs the
particular case. Instead, it is a case of silence or insufficiency
of the law and the Rules of Court. This silence, according to
the Court, is not a reason to refrain from ruling on the matter
because of the provisions of Art. 9 of the Civil Code which
expressly require the courts to make a ruling despite the
“silence, obscurity or insufficiency of the laws."This situation,
explained by the Court, calls for the application of equity
jurisdiction, which “fills the open spaces in the law.”
The Court, thus, specifically declared:
“x x x the trial court in the exercise of its equity
jurisdiction may validly order the deposit of the PIO
million down payment in court. The purpose of the
exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case is to prevent
unjust enrichment and to ensure restitution. Equity
jurisdiction aims to do complete justice in cases where a
court of law is unable to adapt its judgments to the special
circumstances of a case because of the inflexibility of its
statutory or legal jurisdiction. Equity is the principle by
which substantial justice may be attained in cases where
the prescribed or customary forms of ordinary law are
inadequate” (Reyes v. Lim, 408 SCRA 560, 566-567).

Provisional remedies in criminal cases
1. Provisional remedies may also be availed of in
criminal actions pursuant to Rule 127 of the Rules of Court
because of the civil liability which, as a rule, attaches to the
crime.

Under Sec. 1 of Rule 111, “When a criminal action is
instituted, the civil action for the recovery of civil liability
arising from the offense charged shall be deemed instituted
with the criminal action x x x.”
In connection with the civil action deemed instituted with
the criminal action, the provisional remedies in civil actions

may be availed of insofar as they are applicable (Sec. 1, Rule
127, Rules of Court).

2. In Sec. 2 of Rule 127, “When the civil action is
properly instituted in the criminal action as provided in Rule
111, the offended party may have the property of the accused
attached as security for the satisfaction of any judgment that
may be recovered from the accused in the following cases:

1. Attachment is defined as a provisional remedy by
which the property of an adverse party is taken into legal
custody, either at the commencement of an action or at any
time thereafter, as a security for the satisfaction of any
judgment that may be recovered by the plaintiff or any proper
party (Northern Islands Company, Inc. u. Spouses Garcia,
G.R. No. 203240, March 18, 2015; See also Watercraft Venture
Corporation v. Wolfe, G.R. No. 181721, September 9, 2015). This
provisional remedy is available in order that the defendant
may not dispose of his property during the pendency of the
action so the satisfaction of the judgment may be ensured (See
Security Bank Corporation v. Great Wall Commercial Press
Company, Inc., G.R. No. 219345, January 30, 2017).

The attachment is preliminary only when resorted to
before the finality of the judgment to secure the property of
the adverse party and to prevent its dissipation. Once the
judgment has become final and executory, the attachment
becomes a final one and is issued in order to satisfy the
judgment.
2. Preliminary attachment is purely a statutory
remedy. It cannot exist without a statute granting it (U.S. v.
Namit, 38 Phil. 926, 932). Its legal basis for application is not
only a direct provision in the Rules of Court (Rule 57) but also
in the Civil Code of the Philippines (Art. 1177, Civil Code)
which authorizes a creditor to pursue the property of the

debtor.

ii

CIVIL PROCEDURE

12

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

3. Preliminary attachment itself cannot be the subject
of a separate action independent of the principal action
because the attachment is only an incident of such action
(Northern Islands Company, Inc. v. Spouses Garcia, G.R. No.
203240, March 18, 2015). There is no separate action called
preliminary attachment. It is not a distinct proceeding and is
availed of during the pendency of a principal action because it
is a mere provisional remedy.
For instance, if a plaintiff files an action to collect a
sum of money against a defendant who is about to leave the
country, with a clear intent to defraud his creditor, the action
for collection may be coupled with an application for the
issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment directed against
the property of the defendant in order to prevent him from
disposing of his property during the pendency of the litigation.
The application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
attachment is merely ancillary to the main action, which is,
the action to collect a sum of money. When the writ is issued,
the property of the adverse party would be then put under
custodia legis to be held by the court for the satisfaction of
whatever award which may be obtained by the applicant.
Being merely ancillary to a principal proceeding,
the attachment must fail if the principal suit itself cannot
be maintained, as the purpose of the writ can no longer be
justified. Another consequence is that, where the main action
is appealed, the attachment which may have been issued as
an incident of that action, is also considered appealed and
also removed from the jurisdiction of the lower court. The
attachment itself cannot be the subject of a separate action
independent of the principal action because the attachment
is only an incident of such action (See Northern Islands
4.

Company, Inc. u. Spouses Garcia, G.R No. 203240, March 18

2015).

5. Attachment is in the nature of a proceeding quasi
in rem (Banco-Espanol Filipino u. Palanca, 37 Phil. 921, 928)
although sometimes referred to as an action in rem (Valdevieso
v. Damalerio, 451 SCRA 664, 671). While attachment is a

——

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 57 Preliminary Attachment

13

proceeding in rem or quasi in rem, this classification becomes
significant when the defendant does not appear in the action
as when he is a non-resident who is at the same time outside
of the Philippines. In this situation, the need for acquiring
jurisdiction over the property or res becomes imperative so
the court may have the authority to order that the property
be made to answer for the liability of the non-appearing
defendant.
The Court has, however, clarified that, ‘If the defendant
appears, the cause becomes mainly a suit in personam, with
the added incident, that the property attached remains liable,
under the control of the court, to answer to any demand
which may be established against the defendant by the final
judgment of the court. But, if there is no appearance of the
defendant, and no service of process on him, the case becomes,
in its essential nature, a proceeding in rem, the only effect
of which is to subject the property attached to the payment
of the defendant which the court may find to be due to the
plaintiff” (See Banco-Espanol Filipino v. Palanca, 37 Phil.
921, 929 citing Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308).
Grant of preliminary attachment is discretionary

1. The grant of the remedy of preliminary attachment
is addressed to judicial discretion to be exercised in accordance
with the requirements of the applicable rules. There is
nothing in Rule 57 which indicates that the grant of a writ of
preliminary attachment is a matter of right on the part of the
applicant. Whether or not the application shall be given full
credit is discretionary upon the court.

2. It is, of course, understood that such discretion
is not to be exercised whimsically or oppressively. Also, in
determining the propriety of the grant, the court will have
to consider the principal case upon which the provisional
remedy depends. For instance in one case, a judge was found
to have gravely abused his discretion when he issued a writ of
preliminary attachment, even if there was no ground for the
issuance of the writ based on Sec. 1 of Rule 57 of the Rules of

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Court. The Court added, as an example, that a court would
also be acting in excess of its jurisdiction if it issues a writ
on the basis of an affidavit, which does not contain all the
allegations mandated by the Rules to support the application
for the issuance of the writ (K.O. Glass Construction Co., Inc.
v. Valenzuela, 116 SCRA 563, 567).
Strict construction in favor of the defending party

Preliminary attachment should be resorted to only
when necessary and as a last remedy because it exposes the
debtor to humiliation and annoyance. It must be granted only
on concrete and specific grounds and not merely on general
averments quoting the words of the rules. Since attachment is
harsh, extraordinary, and summary in nature, the rules on the
application of a writ of attachment must be strictly construed
in favor of the defendant (Watercraft Venture Corporation v.
Wolfe, G.R. No. 181721, September 9, 2015).
Who may avail of preliminary attachment

Section 1 of Rule 57 provides that the plaintiff or any
proper party may have the property of the adverse party
attached. Clearly, it is not only the plaintiff who may apply
for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment. The
pertinent provisions of Sec. 1 of Rule 57 also make reference
to any proper party. These terms are broad enough to refer
also to a defendant who files a counterclaim, cross-claim or
third-party complaint. Hence, the proper party may also refer
to the counter-claimant, cross-claimant or the third-party
plaintiff as long as the application for the writ is supported
by
the proper ground (For further readings, see Borja v. Platon
73 Phil. 659, 660).
Purpose of preliminary attachment

Section 1 of Rule 57 categorically declares that “x x x a
have the property
adverse party attached as security for the satisfaction of the
of any
judgment that may be recovered x x x.”
Preliminary attachment
plaintiff or any proper party may

16

is, hence, designed to seize the property of the debtor before
final judgment and put the same in custodia legis even while
the action is pending for the satisfaction of a later judgment.

One case more simply puts the purposes of preliminary
attachment as follows:
“The purposes of preliminary attachment are: (1)
to seize the property of the debtor in advance of final
judgment and to hold it for purposes of satisfying said
judgment x x x; or (2) to acquire jurisdiction over the
action by actual or constructive seizure of the property
in those instances where personal or substituted service
of summons on the defendant cannot be effected x x x”
(Philippine Commercial International Bank v. Alejandro,
533 SCRA 738, 751-752).

Stage of the proceedings when preliminary attachment may
be applied for
1. An order and writ of preliminary attachment may
be applied for (a) at the commencement of the action, or (b) at
any time before entry of judgment (Sec. 1, Rule 57, Rules of
Court).

If it is applied for at the commencement of the action,
the application may be incorporated in a verified complaint
alleging all the grounds relied upon and complying with
all the requisites for the grant of the application. Here, the
application is made even before summons is served on the
defendant or even before summons is issued by the court. An
application at this stage will result in an ex parte issuance of
the writ of preliminary attachment. (Bar 2014)
If not applied for at the commencement of the action,
may be made after service of summons upon
application
the
the defendant and may even be made at any stage of the
proceedings, even after judgment, but before its entry. The
stage before the entry of the judgment is the last opportunity
to avail of the remedy. Since at this stage, the defendant has
already been summoned to the action, an application for the
issuance of an order of attachment would entail notice to the

defendant.

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

2. Under Sec. 2 of Rule 36, the date of finality of the
judgment or final order shall be deemed to be the date of its
entry. Hence, the issuance of the writ may be applied for
before the judgment becomes final and executory. After the
judgment becomes final and executory, a writ of preliminary
attachment can no longer be obtained because the judgment,
by then, has already been entered by operation of the Rules.

In the language of the Court:
“Rule 57 in fact speaks of the grant of the remedy ‘at
the commencement of the action or at any time thereafter.’
The phrase, ‘at the commencement of the action,’
obviously refers to the date of the filing of the complaint
which, as x x x pointed out, is the date that marks ‘the
commencement of the action;’ and the reference plainly
is to a time before summons is served on the defendant,
or even before summons issues. What the rule is saying
quite clearly is that after an action is properly commenced
by the filing of the complaint and the payment of all
requisite docket and other fees
the plaintiff may apply
for and obtain a writ of preliminary attachment upon
fulfillment of the pertinent requisites laid down by law,
and that he may do so at any time, either before or after
service of summons on the defendant. And this indeed, has
been the immemorial practice sanctioned by the courts:
for the plaintiff or other proper party to incorporate the
application for attachment in the complaint or other
appropriate pleading (counter-claim, cross-claim, thirdparty claim) and for the Trial Court to issue the writ ex
parte at the commencement of the action if it finds
the
application otherwise sufficient in form and
substance”
(Davao Light and Power, Inc. v. Court of
Appeals, 204
SCRA 343, 349-350; Emphasis supplied).

Kinds of attachments; distinctions (Bar 1975,

2012)

1.

1990. 1999.

There are certain types of attachments, to wit:
(a) preliminary attachment (Bar
2012);
(b) garnishment (Bar 2012);

and

17

(c) levy on execution to satisfy a final judgment
(Bar 2012).

Preliminary attachment is one issued at the
commencement of the action or at any time before entry of
the judgment as security for the satisfaction of any judgment
that may be recovered. Here, the court takes custody of the
property of the party against whom the attachment is directed
pending litigation.
2.

3. Garnishment is a kind of attachment in which the
attaching party seeks to subject to his claim either the property
of the adverse party, in the hands of a third person called the
garnishee, or the money which said third person owes the
adverse party. Examples: The deposits of the defendant in a
bank; dividends due the defendant in a corporation; wages
of the defendant held by the employer; royalties due the
defendant in the hands of a publisher.
(a) The Court considers garnishment as specie
of attachment for reaching credits belonging to the
judgment debtor and owing to him from a stranger to
the litigation (Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v.
Castro, 168 SCRA 49, 57). By means of garnishment, the
plaintiff reaches credits belonging to the defendant and
owing to him from a third person. (Bar 2008)

(b) Garnishment does not involve the actual
seizure of the property which remains in the hands of the
garnishee. Garnishment simply impounds the property in
the garnishee’s possession and maintains the status quo
until the main action is finally decided. Thus, if pursuant
to a court order, the defendant’s credit with a stockbroker

is garnished, the sheriff cannot order that said credit be
paid to the plaintiff or the sheriff upon the garnishment.
It is only after the judgment against the judgment obligor
has become final and executory that the payment is to be
made (See Sec. 15[c], Rule 57, Rules of Court). (Bar 1980,
2008)

(c) Jurisdiction over the garnishee is acquired
by the mere service upon him of the copy of the writ of

,o

CIVIL PROCEDURE

——

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 57 Preliminary Attachment

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

garnishment with a notice that his debt to the defendant
or other personal property of the defendant under his
control or possession is attached pursuant to the writ
(See Sec. 7[d], Rule 57, Rules of Court).

(d) Service of summons is not required to bind the
garnishee. Thus, it was ruled:

“In order that the trial court may validly acquire
jurisdiction to bind the person of the garnishee, it
is not necessary that summons be served upon him.
The garnishee need not be impleaded as a party to
the case. All that is necessary for the trial court to
lawfully bind the person of the garnishee or any
person who has in his possession credits belonging
to the judgment debtor is service upon him of the
writ of garnishment” (Perla Compania de Seguros,
Inc. v. Ramolete, 203 SCRA 487, 491-492).
(e) By virtue of the writ, the garnishee will
be required to hold the property or the funds in his
hands during the pendency of the litigation and at the
appropriate time, to deliver the same not to the judgment
obligor/defendant but to the new creditor, the judgment
obligee/creditor.
It was ruled that in legal contemplation, garnishment is
a forced novation by the substitution of creditors. The debtor,
who is the original creditor of the garnishee is, through service
of the writ of garnishment, substituted by the creditor who
thereby becomes creditor of the garnishee. Garnishment has
also been described as a warning to a person having
in his
possession property or credits of the judgment
debtor, not to
pay the money or deliver the property to the latter,
but rather
to appear and answer the plaintiffs suit (Perla Compania
De
Seguros, Inc. v. Ramolete, 203 SCRA 487, 491).
4. Levy upon execution is the process employed
after
the judgment has become executory by which
the
property
of
the judgment obligor is set aside and taken
into the custody of
the court before the sale of the property on
execution for the
satisfaction of a final judgment. In this process,
the sheriff

19

or an officer of the court appropriates the judgment debtor’s
property pursuant to the writ of execution as a preliminary
step to the sale on execution of the property of the judgment
debtor.
Grounds for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment
(cases where preliminary attachment is proper)
One cannot secure a writ of preliminary attachment in
every situation. The rules governing preliminary attachment
enumerate specific situations in which the remedy can be
availed of (Sec. 1, Rule 57, Rules of Court).
Example: A borrowed a substantial amount of money
from B. A failed to pay despite demand on the due date.
B sued A in the proper court. Is preliminary attachment
available to B under Sec. 1 of Rule 57 if he can show that A is
already insolvent at the time the action is filed? Preliminary
attachment is not available. Insolvency or mere inability of
the debtor to fulfill his obligation to pay a debt in an action for
a sum of money is not one of those cases enumerated in Sec. 1,
Rule 57 of the Rules of Court.

“x x x Insolvency is not a ground for attachment, especially
when the defendant has not been shown to have committed
any act intended to defraud his creditors. To authorize an
attachment, at least one of the causes mentioned in the
statute must exist. Mere insolvency x x x is not a ground for
attachment. A man may be unable to pay his debts in full,
and still be doing all in his power to pay them, and, so long as
he furnishes no statutory cause of attachment against him,
no attachment will be made against his property [Federal
Farm Mortg. Corp. v. Mulder, 280 N. W. 454, 455; Walker v.
Hagerty, 20 Neb. 482, 30 N.W. 556].” (Mac Chamorro & Co.
v. Philippine Ready Mix Concrete Co., 94 Phil. 1005; See also
Aboitiz & Company v. Cotabato Bus Co., 105 SCRA 88, 93).

A. Recovery of a specified amount of money or
damages

One of the cases in which preliminary attachment is
proper is:
1.

20

CIVIL PROCEDURE

PART I

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)
VOLUME II

“In an action for the recovery of a specified amount of
money or damages, other than moral and exemplary, on a
cause of action arising from law, contract, quasi-contract,
delict or quasi-delict against a party who is about to depart
from the Philippines with intent to defraud his creditors”
(Sec. Ifa], Rule 57, Rules of Court; Italics supplied).

2. Under the above provision, a party is sued for money
or damages, the amount of which is “specified.” That the
amount be specified is a clear requirement of the rule.
The cause of action need not arise from a contract alone.
It may be based upon any of the sources of obligations under
Art. 1157 of the Civil Code like law, quasi-contract, delict or
quasi-delict. However, where the action is for the recovery
of moral damages or exemplary damages alone, preliminary
attachment will not lie under the said provision even if the
claimant specifies the amount he seeks to recover (Sec. 1,
Rule 57, Rules of Court). Hence, it was held that a writ of
preliminary attachment cannot be issued for moral and
exemplary damages and other unliquidated and contingent
claims (Insular Savings Bank v. Court of Appeals, 460 SCRA
122, 129-130). The amount of such damages is not for a party
to determine. Its assessment is left to the discretion of the
court, according to the circumstances of each case (See Art.
2216, Civil Code of the Philippines).
3. Under Sec. 1(a) of Rule 57, it is not sufficient, for the
application for a writ of preliminary attachment, to show that
the party against whom the writ is sought is about to depart
from the Philippines. Such fact alone would not justify the
issuance of the writ. It must also show that such departure is
“with the intent to defraud his creditors.” (Bar 1982, 2011)
Establishing these facts are now matters of evidence.
The fact that the debtor is a foreigner is not, in itself,
a reason to grant the application for the writ.
Thus, it was
ruled that, a mere allegation that the defendant is a foreigner,
without showing that he intends to depart from the Philippines
to defraud his creditor, is not sufficient for
the issuance of a
writ of preliminary attachment (K.O.
Glass Construction Co.,
Inc. v. Valenzuela, 116 SCRA 563, 568-569). (Bar
2011)

B. Action for money or property embezzled (Bar 1982)
1.

Preliminary attachment is also available in:

“x x x an action for money or property embezzled
or fraudulently misapplied or converted to his own use
by a public officer, or an officer of a corporation, or an
attorney, factor, broker, agent, or clerk, in the course
of his employment as such, or by any other person in a
fiduciary capacity, or for a willful violation of duty” (Sec.
IfbJ, Rule 57, Rules of Court).

2. The main action, under the provision, is one for the
recovery of money or property that has been embezzled by
the defendant or fraudulently misapplied or converted to his
own use. The act was done in the course of his employment or
committed in a fiduciary capacity. It may also be committed
by one who has willfully violated his duty.
For the writ to be issued, there is no need for a showing
that the defendant is concealing, removing, or disposing of his
property. Under this provision, it is the character of the office
or the duty of the defendant that is to be considered when
the acts, giving rise to the cause of action, are performed.
For instance, a writ of preliminary attachment is proper in
an action against a public officer who misappropriates funds
entrusted to him.

A fiduciary duty is one “founded in trust and confidence”
(Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged,
1993, 845).
3. The writ may also be issued against a corporate
officer who, with abuse of confidence, appropriates corporate
funds for his personal use (Walter E. Olsen & Co. v. Olsen, 48
Phil. 238, 242-243).

C. Recovery of property unjustly or fraudulently
taken
1. Preliminary attachment may be availed of in:
"x x x an action to recover the possession of property
unjustly or fraudulently taken, detained or converted,

CIVIL PROCEDURE

22

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

when the property, or any part thereof, has been
concealed, removed, or disposed of to prevent its being
found or taken by the applicant or an authorized person
(Sec. l[c], Rule 57, Rules of Court).
2. Here, the main action is one for the recovery of the
possession of property. The justification for the issuance of the
writ, under this provision, is the defendant’s act of taking the
property unjustly or fraudulently. It may also result from his
act of detaining or converting said property. Aside from any
of the acts mentioned, there must also be a showing that the
defendant has concealed, removed or disposed of the property,
or any part thereof to prevent its being found or taken by
either the applicant or an authorized person.
This ground does not refer to a defendant acting in
a fiduciary capacity or to one acting in the course of his
employment. It does not also refer to one who has willfully
violated his duty. The circumstances of the defendant do not
matter under this provision as long as the acts mentioned
have been performed.

D. Fraud in contracting or performing an obligation
(Bar 2011)
1.

Preliminary attachment may be obtained in:

“x x x an action against a party who has been guilty
of fraud in contracting the debt or incurring the obligation
upon which the action is brought, or in the performance
thereof (Sec. IfdJ, Rule 57, Rules of Court).

2. The basis of the application for a writ of preliminary
attachment under this provision is the fraudulent act of a party
in either (a) contracting the debt or incurring the obligation,
or (b) in the performance of his obligation.

3. There are two (2) kinds of frauds contemplated
here: first is, dolo causante (causal fraud) and second is, dole
incidente (incidental fraud).

Dolo causante is the fraud used to induce another to enter

into a contract (Art. 1338, Civil Code). It is the fraud employed

—
—

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 67 Preliminary Attachment

23

in contracting an obligation and renders a contract annullable
or voidable (Arts. 1330 and 1390, Civil Code).
Dolo incidente is the fraud employed by a party in
the fulfillment of his obligation or after the obligation has
been contracted. This kind of fraud only obliges the person
employing it to pay damages (Art. 1344, Civil Code).
4. Under the former rule (Sec. l[d], Rule 57, 1964
Rules of Court), the fraud that justified a writ of preliminary
attachment was only the fraud committed in contracting
an obligation (dolo causante). It did not include the fraud
committed subsequent to contracting the obligation (dolo
incidente) or fraud in the performance of an obligation. With
the amendment, both kinds of frauds are now included as
grounds for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment.
Note that the present rule conspicuously includes fraud “in
the performance thereof,” making obvious reference to dolo
incidente (See Security Bank Corporation v. Great Wall
Commercial Press Company, Inc., G.R. No. 219345, January
30, 2017).

Under the present provisions of Sec. 1(d) of Rule 57, it
is submitted that the willful delivery of counterfeit money
in payment of a debt may be considered as a ground for
preliminary attachment. This is obviously an act of fraud
in the performance of the obligation. Knowingly issuing a
bouncing check to pay a debt may, likewise, be considered
fraud in the performance of the obligation.

Under the former rule, such acts were not grounds for
a preliminary attachment. Thus, in an early case applying
the old rule, although the defendant was found to be in bad
faith in issuing two (2) sets of bouncing checks in payment of
an indebtedness, such bad faith was declared not related to
his having incurred the obligation in favor of the plaintiff but
to defendant’s failure to perform said obligation. There was,
therefore, according to the Court, no ground for the plaintiff
to attach the defendant’s properties on the ground of fraud
(Javellana u. D.O. Plaza Enterprises, 32 SCRA 261, 265; See
Security Bank Corporation u. Great Wall Commercial Press
Company, Inc., G.R. No. 219345, January 30, 2017).

CIVIL PROCEDURE

——

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 67 Preliminary Attachment

VOLUME II

5. As to fraud in contracting the debt or incurring
obligation,
the
it must be shown that the debtor intended to
defraud the creditor at the time the obligation is contracted.
Consider this example: Mr. X induced his rich friend, Mr.
Y, to grant him a loan using a spunous land title as security.
Without the security, Mr. Y would not have extended the loan
to him. If Mr. Y later learns of the fraud and files an action
to recover the amount loaned to Mr. X, Mr. Y may apply for a
writ of preliminary attachment. The fraud committed by Mr.
X is a fraud in contracting the obligation or dolo causante.

The fraud must relate to the execution of the agreement
and must be the reason which induced the other party into
giving consent which he would not have otherwise given. To
constitute a ground for attachment, fraud should be committed
upon contracting the obligation sued upon.

A debt is fraudulently contracted, if at the time of
contracting it, the debtor has a preconceived plan or intention
not to pay. Fraud is a state of mind and need not be proved by
direct evidence but may be inferred from the circumstances
attendant in each case but the fraudulent intent not to honor
the admitted obligation cannot be inferred from the debtor’s
inability to pay or comply with the obligations (Philippine
Bank of Communications v. Court of Appeals, 352 SCRA
616, 622-623; Watercraft Venture Corporation v. Wolfe, G.R.
No. 181721, September 9, 2015; For further readings, see
Information Technology Foundation of the Philippines v.
Commission on Elections, G.R. No. 159139, June 6, 2017).
The circumstances constituting fraud must be stated
with particularity (Sec. 5, Rule 8, Rules of Court, as amended).
Hence, it was held that fraudulent intent is not a physical
entity, but a condition of the mind beyond the reach of the
senses, usually kept secret, very unlikely to be confessed,
and therefore, can only be proved by unguarded expressions,
conduct and circumstances. Thus, the applicant for a writ of
preliminary attachment must sufficiently show the
circumstances of the alleged fraud because fraudulentfactual

intent
cannot be inferred from the debtor’s mere
non-payment of the
debt or failure to comply with his obligation.
The particulars

26

of such circumstances necessarily include the time, persons,
places and specific acts of fraud committed. An affidavit which
does not contain concrete and specific grounds is inadequate
to sustain the issuance of such writ. In fact, mere general
averments render the writ defective and the court that ordered
its issuance acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting
to excess of jurisdiction (Watercraft Venture Corporation v.
Wolfe, G.R. No. 181721, September 9, 2015).
6. When fraud is invoked as a ground for the issuance
of a writ of preliminary attachment, under Rule 57 of the Rules
of Court, there must be evidence clearly showing the factual
circumstances of the alleged fraud. Fraud cannot be presumed
from a party’s mere failure to comply with his obligation.
Moreover, the circumstances constituting fraud must be
stated with particularity (Tsuneishi Industries [CebuJ, Inc. v.
MIS Maritime Corporation, G.R. No. 193572, April 4, 2018).
7. A writ of preliminary attachment is too harsh a
provisional remedy to be issued based on mere abstractions of
fraud. Rather, the rules require that for the writ to issue, there
must be a recitation of clear and concrete factual circumstances
manifesting that the debtor practiced fraud upon the creditor
at the time of the execution of their agreement in that said
debtor had a preconceived plan or intention not to pay the
creditor (Equitable v. Special Steel, G.R. No. 1 75350, June 13,
2012).

E. Removal or disposal of property with intent to
defraud
1.

in:

Preliminary attachment is also a remedy available

“x x x an action against a party who has removed or
disposed of his property, or is about to do so, with intent to
defraud his creditors” (Sec. l[e]. Rule 57, Rules of Court).

2. Two (2) elements are required by the rule to justify a
preliminary attachment under Sec. 1(e), Rule 57, namely: (a)
a party has removed or disposed of his property, or is about

CIVIL PROCEDURE

26

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

to do so, and (b) the acts in letter “a” must be with intent to
defraud the creditor.
Hence, mere showing that the debtor has removed
or disposed of his property is not sufficient to support an
application for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment.
The act must be shown also to have been done with the intent
to defraud the creditor. Fraud is not presumed. It must be

proven.
3. To justify the issuance of an order of attachment,
the provision does not require that money or property be
embezzled, fraudulently misapplied or converted (Sec. l[b].
Rule 57), or that the property be unjustly or fraudulently
taken, detained or converted (Sec. Ifc], Rule 57), or that the
action is against a party who has been guilty of fraud in
incurring the obligation or in the performance of an obligation
(Sec. l[d], Rule 57). A writ of preliminary attachment under
this provision merely requires that it be “an action” (which
means any action) against a person who has removed or
disposed of his property, or is about to perform such acts with
the intent to defraud his creditors.
Action against non-residents or on whom summons may be
served by publication
1.

in:

A writ of preliminary attachment may be obtained

“x x x an action against a party who does not reside
and is not found in the Philippines, or on whom summons
may be served by publication” (Sec. Iff], Rule 57, Rules of

Court).

2. The rule does not solely refer to parties who are non¬
residents but also to other parties who may be residents but
on whom summons by publication may be served. Preliminary
attachment may be availed of against their properties. These
persons include the following:
(a) resident defendants whose identity
or
whereabouts are unknown under Sec. 16 of Rule 14, as
amended by A.M. No. 19-10-20-SC; and

——

PARTI PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 67 Preliminary Attachment

27

(b) resident defendants who are temporarily out of
the country (Sec. 18, Rule 14, as amended by A.M. No. 1910-20-SC).
3. Where the identity or whereabouts of the defendant
is unknown, Sec. 16 of Rule 14, as amended, authorizes
summons by publication in any action against him. Hence,
the action may be in rem, quasi in rem or in personam. What
justifies a preliminary attachment in this case is not the act
of the defendant but the fact that he is unknown or that he is
nowhere to be found.
4. Where the defendant is a resident of the Philippines
who is temporarily out of the country, preliminary attachment
of his property may be allowed because the defendant may be
summoned by publication in accordance with Sec. 18 of Rule
14, as amended, in relation to Sec. 17 of Rule 14 of the Rules
of Court, as amended. Section 17 of Rule 14, as amended,
on extraterritorial service of summons, includes summons by
publication.

5. The application of the provision becomes more
meaningful in an in personam action, and the defendant does
not reside and is not found in the Philippines and, hence,
personal and substituted service of summons cannot be
effected. Neither can jurisdiction over his person be acquired
by summons by publication.

The remedy of the plaintiff, in order for the court to
acquire jurisdiction to try the case, is to convert the action into
a proceeding in rem or quasi in rem by attaching the property
of the defendant. Thus, in order for the court to acquire
jurisdiction to try actions in personam where the defendant
resides out of and is not found in the Philippines, it becomes
a matter of course for said court to convert the action into a
proceeding in rem or quasi in rem by attaching the defendant’s
property. The service of summons, in this case (which may be
by publication coupled with the sending by registered mail of
the copy of the summons and the court order to the last known
address of the defendant), is no longer for the purpose of
acquiring jurisdiction over the person of the defendant but for
compliance with the requirements of due process (Philippine
Commercial International Bank v. Alejandro, 533 SCRA 738,
752). (Bar 1983)

CIVIL PROCEDURE

28

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Recall that under Sec. 18 of Rule 14, as amended,
summons by publication may be served in any action
commenced against residents temporarily out of the
Philippines. Hence, preliminary attachment applies also to
such persons.
Summons by publication, however, is not the only mode
of service of summons available against defendants described
in Sec. 18, as amended. Since they are residents of the
Philippines, they may be served by substituted service under
Sec. 6, Rule 14, as amended. It has been ruled that where
the defendant is a resident who is temporarily out of the
Philippines, attachment of his or her property in an action
in personam is not always necessary in order for the court to
acquire jurisdiction to hear the case.
The Court, in so ruling, quotes Sec. 18, Rule 14 of the
Rules of Court, as amended, which provides that “When an
action is commenced against a defendant who ordinarily
resides within the Philippines, but who is temporarily out of
it, service may, by leave of court, be also effected out of the
Philippines, as under the preceding section.”
6.

The Court continues, thus:
“The preceding section referred to in the above
provision is Section 15 which provides for extraterritorial
(a) personal service out of the Philippines; (b)
service
publication coupled with the sending by registered mail
of the copy of the summons and the court order to the
last known address of the defendant; or (c) in any other
manner which the court may deem sufficient.

—

In Montalban v. Maximo, (131 Phil. 154, 165-166
[1968]), however, the Court held that “substituted service
of summons x x x is the normal mode of service of summons
that will confer jurisdiction on the court over the person
of residents temporarily out of the Philippines. Meaning,
service of summons may be effected by (a) leaving copies
of the summons at the defendant’s residence with some
person of suitable discretion residing therein, or (b) by
leaving copies at the defendant’s office or regular place of
business with some competent person in charge thereof.
Hence, the court may acquire jurisdiction over an
action

in personam by mere substituted service without need of
attaching the property of the defendant (Underscoring
supplied).
XXX

Thus, in actions in personam against residents
temporarily out of the Philippines, the court need not
always attach the defendant’s property in order to have
authority to try the case. Where the plaintiff seeks to
attach the defendant’s property and to resort to the
concomitant service of summons by publication, the
same must be with prior leave, precisely because, if the
sole purpose of the attachment is for the court to acquire
jurisdiction, the latter must determine whether from
the allegations in the complaint, substituted service (to
persons of suitable discretion at the defendant’s residence
or to a competent person in charge of his office or regular
place of business) will suffice, or whether there is a need
to attach the property of the defendant and resort to
service of summons by publication in order for the court
to acquire jurisdiction over the case and to comply with
the requirements of due process” (Philippine Commercial
International Bank v. Alejandro, 533 SCRA 738, 752).

Requisites for the issuance of an order of preliminary
attachment; affidavit and bond required

1. An order of attachment shall be granted only upon
the filing of the requisite affidavit and bond. These must be
duly filed with the court before the order of attachment is
issued (Sec. 3, Rule 57, Rules of Court). Note that the rule does
not require a hearing because the writ of attachment may be
issued ex parte (Sec. 2, Rule 57, Rules of Court).

2. The required affidavit need not be executed by the
applicant. It may be executed by some other person who
personally knows the facts (Sec. 3, Rule 57, Rules of Court).
Section 3 of Rule 57 also enumerates what the affidavit of the
applicant should contain.

3. Aside from the affidavit executed, the party applying
for an order of preliminary attachment must post a bond in
the amount fixed by the court and executed to the adverse

CIVIL PROCEDURE

Rule 67 Preliminary Attachment

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

party. This is called an attachment bond (See Secs. 3 and 4,
Rule 57, Rules of Court).

Contents of the affidavit

The affidavit shall contain the following:
(a) That a sufficient cause of action exists;
(b) That the case is one of those mentioned in Sec.
1 of Rule 57;
(c) That there is no other sufficient security for the
claim sought to be enforced by the action; and
(d) That the amount due to the applicant, or the
value of the property the possession of which he is entitled
to recover, is as much as the sum for which the order is
granted above all legal counterclaims (Sec. 3, Rule 57,
Rules of Court).
1.

2. The affidavit shall allege all the matters what the
rule requires it to contain. In a case, the Court observed that
while the applicant may have stated in his affidavit that a
sufficient cause of action exists against the defendant, he did
not state therein that “the case is one of those mentioned in
Sec. 1 hereof; that there is no other sufficient security for the
claim sought to be enforced by the action; and that the amount
due to the applicant is as much as the sum for which the order
is granted above all legal counter-claims.”
The Court held that the failure to allege in the affidavit
the requisites prescribed for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary attachment renders the writ of preliminary
attachment issued against the property of the defendant
fatally defective, and the judge issuing it is deemed to have
acted in excess of his jurisdiction (K.O. Glass Construction
Co., Inc. v. Valenzuela, 116 SCRA 563, 571).

Effect of the existence of a mortgage

Since Sec. 3 of Rule 57 requires that there must be a
showing of the insufficiency of the security for
the claim sought
to be enforced by the applicant, the writ
will not

be issued

31

if a real estate mortgage exists to secure the obligation even
if, instead of fifing an action for foreclosure, an action for a
sum of money was filed (See Salgado v. Court of Appeals, 128
SCRA 395). To justify the issuance of the writ of preliminary
attachment, it must be shown that the security is insufficient
to cover the claim.
Condition of applicant’s bond
1. The bond executed in favor of the adverse party
is conditioned upon the payment, by the party applying for
an order of attachment, of all costs which the adverse party
may be adjudged as entitled to and all damages which he
may sustain by reason of the attachment, if it shall be finally
adjudged that the party applying for attachment was not
entitled thereto (Sec. 4, Rule 57, Rules of Court; For further
readings, see Carlos v. Sandoval, 471 SCRA 266).
2. The damages, which may be claimed against the
bond, refers only to damages sustained because of or by reason
of the attachment, not by reason of some other cause.
It was ruled that the attachment bond answers only for
the payment of all damages which the defendant may sustain
if the court shall finally adjudge that the plaintiff was not
entitled to attachment. The liability attaches if the plaintiff
is not entitled to the attachment because the requirements
entitling him to the writ are wanting, or that the facts stated
in his affidavit, or some of them are untrue. Clearly, the
defendant can only claim from the bond for all the damages
which he may sustain by reason of the attachment and not
because of the sale of the attached properties prior to final
judgment (China Banking Corporation v. Asian Construction
and Development Corporation, 550 SCRA 585, 598).

Issuance of the order; ex parte or upon motion with notice
and hearing (Bar 1978, 1991, 1993, 1996, 2001, 2005)
1. The order of preliminary attachment may be granted
upon motion and notice and hearing by the court in which the
action is pending, and may even be issued on appeal by the
Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court (Sec. 2, Rule 57, Rules

32

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

of Court). When the case is on appeal, the judgment is not
yet final and executory and this means that there is yet no
entry of the judgment. An order and writ of attachment may
be applied for before the entry of judgment (See Sec. 1, Rule
57, Rules of Court).
2. It may also be issued ex parte and even before
summons is served upon the defendant. However, in this case,
the writ may not yet be enforced and validly implemented
unless preceded or simultaneously accompanied by service of
summons, copy of the complaint, application for attachment,
order of attachment and the attachment bond (Davao Light
& Power Co., Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 204 SCRA 343, 357;
Mangila v. Court of Appeals, 387 SCRA 162, 171-172). The
implementation of the writ of attachment without the required
jurisdiction over his person is null and void (BAC Mfg. & Sons,
Corp. v. Court of Appeals, 200 SCRA 130, 139).

An application for an order and writ of attachment may
be granted ex parte because it is possible that during the
course of the hearing, the party against whom the writ is
sought may dispose of his property or abscond before the writ
is issued. It has been held that nothing in the Rules of Court
makes notice and hearing indispensable and mandatory
requisites for the issuance of a writ of attachment (Filinvest
Credit v. Relova, 117 SCRA 420, 428). As a matter of fact, a
hearing would defeat the purpose of this provisional remedy.
The time which such a hearing would take, could be enough
to enable the defendant to abscond or dispose of his property
before a writ of attachment issues. Nevertheless, while no
hearing is required by the Rules of Court for the issuance
of an attachment (Belisle Investment & Finance Co., Inc. v.
State Investment House, Inc., G.R. No. 72927, June 30, 1987;
Filinvest Credit Corp. v. Relova, 117 SCRA 420), a motion to
quash the writ may not be granted without due notice to the
applicant and only after hearing (Secs. 12 and 13, Rule 57,
Rules of Court).
3. It is not the notice to the defendant that is sought
to be avoided but the time which such hearing would take
because the defendant may delay the hearing to be able to

—
—

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 57 Preliminary Attachment

33

dispose of his properties (Onate v. Abrogar, 241 SCRA 659,
667-668).

The Court further explains:
“x x x th[e] Court ruled that a hearing on a motion
or application for preliminary attachment is not generally
necessary unless otherwise directed by the Trial Court in
its discretion, x x x the Court declared that ‘(n)othing in
the Rules of Court makes notice and hearing indispensable
and mandatory requisites for the issuance of a writ
of attachment.’ The only prerequisite is that the Court
be satisfied, upon consideration of ‘the affidavit of the
applicant or of some other person who personally knows
the facts, that a sufficient cause of action exists, that the
case is one of those mentioned in Section 1 (Rule 57), that
there is no other sufficient security for the claim sought
to be enforced by the action, and that the amount due to
the applicant, or the value of the property the possession
of which he is entitled to recover, is as much as the sum
for which the order (of attachment) is granted above all
legal counterclaims.’ If the court be so satisfied, the ‘order
of attachment shall be granted,’ and the writ shall issue
upon the applicant’s posting of ‘a bond executed to the
adverse party in an amount to be fixed by the judge, not
exceeding the plaintiffs claim, conditioned that the latter
will pay all the costs which may be adjudged to the adverse
party and all damages which he may sustain by reason of
the attachment, if the court shall finally adjudge that the
applicant was not entitled thereto” (For further readings,
see Davao Light and Power, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 204
SCRA 343, 351).

Stages in the grant of preliminary attachment

Jurisprudence explains that the grant of the provisional
remedy of attachment has three stages:

First, the court issues the order granting the
application;
Second, the writ of attachment issues pursuant to
the order granting the writ; and

Third, the writ is implemented.

——

CIVIL PROCEDURE

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 67 Preliminary Attachment

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Jurisdiction over the person of the defendant is not
necessary in the first two (2) stages. In the third stage, when
the writ is to be implemented, the court must have acquired
jurisdiction over the person of the defendant. Without such
jurisdiction having been obtained, the court has no power and
authority to act in any manner against the property of the
defendant (Mangila v. Court of Appeals, 387 SCRA 162, 172).
Hence, the rule provides that no levy on attachment pursuant
to the writ of preliminary attachment shall be enforced unless
it is preceded, or contemporaneously accompanied, by the
service of summons, together with a copy of the complaint,
the application for attachment, the applicant’s affidavit and
bond, and the order and writ of attachment, on the defendant
within the Philippines (Sec. 5, Rule 57, Rules of Court). (Bar

36

When the requirement of prior or contemporaneous service
shall not apply
1. The rule preventing the sheriff from making a levy
on attachment without a prior or contemporaneous service of
summons shall not apply in the following cases:
(a) the summons could not be served personally
despite diligent efforts;

(b) the summonscould not be served by substituted
service despite diligent efforts;
(c)

the defendant is a resident of the Philippines
temporarily absent therefrom;

2014, 2018)

(d) the defendant is a non-resident of the
Philippines; and

Prior or contemporaneous service of summons (Bar 2005)

(e) the action is one in rem or quasi in rem (Sec. 5,
Rule 57, Rules of Court).

1. The writ of attachment is implemented by the sheriff
who shall make a levy on attachment pursuant to the writ
issued under Sec. 2 of Rule 57. However, under the Rules, the
sheriff is not allowed to make a levy on attachment if such
levy is not preceded or contemporaneously accompanied, by
the service on the defendant within the Philippines, of the
following:

(a) service of summons;

(b) copy of the complaint;
(c) application for attachment;
(d) applicant’s affidavit and bond; and
(e) order and writ of attachment (Sec. 5, Rule 57,
Rules of Court).

2. It is apparent that the service mentioned in the
immediately preceding paragraph is necessary to acquire
jurisdiction over the person of the defendant before
the writ is
implemented and to comply with the due process requirements
of the law.

2. In any of the above cases, the levy on attachment
would be justified even if no prior or contemporaneous service
of summons is effected. Without these exceptions, the party
against whom the writ is directed would be able to frustrate
the ends of justice by the simple expedient of disappearing
and intentionally putting himself beyond the reach of court
processes. Notice that most of these exceptions are instances
where service of summons by publication may be justified.

Duties of the sheriff
The sheriff is required to proceed with the attach¬
ment without delay and with all reasonable diligence unless
the party against whom the writ is directed makes a deposit
with the court from which the writ is issued, or gives a counter¬
bond (Sec. 5, Rule 57, Rules of Court).
1.

2. The sheriff enforcing the writ is required to attach
the property subject of said writ to await the judgment in the
case and its execution. He cannot attach every property of
the adverse party but only so much of the property located in

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

the Philippines as may be sufficient to satisfy the applicant s
demand and not more (Sec. 5, Rule 57, Rules of Court). This
rule is obviously intended to prevent excessive attachment
and abuse in the enforcement of the writ.
3. The sheriff is also precluded from attaching any
property exempt from execution (Sec. 5, Rule 57, Rules of
Court) such as those enumerated in Sec. 13 of Rule 39 of the
Rules of Court.
4. After enforcing the writ, the sheriff must, likewise,
without delay make a return to the court which issued the
writ, with a full statement of his proceedings under the writ
and a complete inventory of the property attached, together
with any counter-bond given by the party against whom
attachment is issued, and serve copies thereof on the applicant
(Sec. 6, Rule 57, Rules of Court).
Attachment of real property; growing crops
1. Real property or growing crops shall be attached by
the sheriff executing the writ by filing with the Registry of
Deeds the following:
(a) copy of the order of attachment;

(b) description of the property attached; and
(c) notice that the property subject of the writ is
attached (Sec. 7[a], Rule 57, Rules of Court).

2. The sheriff shall then leave a copy of such order,
description, and notice with the occupant of the property, if
any, or with such other person or his agent if found within the
province (Sec. 7fa], Rule 57, Rules of Court).

37

Attachment of personal property capable of manual delivery

If the property to be attached is personal property capable
of manual delivery, the sheriff shall take the property and
safely keep it in his custody. He shall issue the corresponding
receipt for the property taken (Sec. 7[bJ, Rule 57, Rules of
Court).
Attachment of stocks or shares or interest therein

Stocks or shares, or an interest in stocks or shares, of any
corporation or company shall be attached by leaving with the
president or managing agent thereof the following:
(a) copy of the writ; and

(b) notice stating that the stock or interest of the
party against whom the attachment is issued is attached
in pursuance of such writ (Sec. 7fcJ, Rule 57, Rules of

Court).

Attachment of bank deposits and similar property not
capable of manual delivery (garnishment)
1. In attaching debts and credits, including bank
deposits, financial interest, royalties, commissions, and other
personal property not capable of manual delivery, the sheriff
shall leave with the person owing such debts, or having in his
possession or under his control, such credits or other personal
property, or with his agent, the following:

(a) copy of the writ; and

operation of either the Land Registration Act or the Property

(b) notice that the debts owing by him to the party
against whom attachment is issued, and the credits and
other personal property in his possession, or under his
control, belonging to said party, are attached in pursuance
of such writ (Sec. 7[d], Rule 57, Rules of Court).

(a) number of the certificate of title, (b) volume and page in the
registration book where the certificate is registered, and (c)
registered owner or owners thereof (Sec. 7[aJ,
Rule 57, Rules
of Court).

2. The above shall be left with the person owing such
debts, or having in his possession or under his control, such
credits or other personal property, or with his agent (Sec. 7[d],
Rule 57, Rules of Court).

3.

Where the property has been brought under the

Registration Decree, the notice shall contain a reference to the

Effect of attachment of debts, credits and similar personal
property
Section 8 of Rule 57 establishes the rule that the person
having possession or control of the debts, credits, and similar
personal property belonging to the person against whom
the attachment is issued shall be liable to the applicant for
the amount of the property, debts, or credits. This liability
continues until the attachment is discharged or until the
judgment recovered by the applicant is satisfied. This liability
or responsibility shall cease if the property subject of the writ
is delivered or transferred, or the debts or credits are paid to
the clerk, sheriff or other proper officer of the court issuing the

attachment.
Attachment of interest in property belonging to the estate of
the decedent
1. A person may have an interest in the estate of a
deceased as an heir, legatee, or devisee. This interest may be

attached.
In attaching the interest of the party, against whom
attachment is issued, in property belonging to the estate of the
decedent, the sheriff shall serve the executor, administrator or
other personal representative of the decedent the following:
(a) copy of the writ; and

——

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 57 Preliminary Attachment

39

of administration of the executor, administrator or personal
representative of the decedent. The representative, however,
is obligated to report the attachment to the court when a
petition for distribution is filed. The property attached shall
be delivered to the sheriff making the levy, subject to the claim
of the heir, legatee or devisee, or any person claiming under
him (Sec. 9, Rule 57, Rules of Court).
Attachment of property in custodia legis; requirement (Bar
1999)
1. Property in custodia legis may be subject of an order of
preliminary attachment. The provisions of the last paragraph
of Sec. 7 of Rule 57 authorizes an attachment of property which
is already under the custody of the law. What will arise in this
event will be a priority in the liens which means that the first
attachment will have priority over subsequent attachments.
The attachment of a property already in custodia legis merely
operates as a lien and does not mean that the attaching court
will wrest custody of the property from another court.
2. If the property attached is in custodia legis, the rule
requires that a copy of the writ of attachment shall be filed
with the proper court or quasi-judicial agency, and notice of
the attachment served upon the custodian of said property
(Sec. 7, last paragraph, Rule 57, Rules of Court; Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas v. Lanzanos, 637 SCRA 475, 485-486).

(b) notice that said interest is attached (Sec. 7[e],
Rule 57, Rules of Court).

Examination of party whose property is attached or of
person Indebted to him

2. A copy of said writ of attachment and notice shall
also be filed in the office of the clerk of the court in which said
estate is being settled. The same shall likewise be served upon
the heir, legatee or devisee concerned (Sec. 7[e], Rule 57, Rules
of Court).

The rule empowers a court to examine under oath the
party whose property is attached for the purpose of giving
information respecting his property. Also, all other persons in
possession of or controlling any property or credit belonging to
the person whose property is attached may also be required to
appear and be examined under oath before the court in which
the action is pending. After such examination, the court may
issue an order requiring the delivery to the clerk of court any
personal property capable of manual delivery, to await the
judgment in the action (Sec. 10, Rule 57, Rules of Court).

Effect of attachment of interest In property belonging to the
estate of the decedent

The attachment of a person’s interest in the estate of
the decedent does not have the effect of impairing the powers

entry
Sale of property after levy on attachment and before
of judgment
provisional
1. A writ of preliminary attachment is a
remedy and its issuance does not have the effect of a final
judgment over the property attached. Before the entry of
the judgment in the case, the property attached remains
any manner
in custodia legis and is not to be disposed of in
custody
of the
the
whatsoever. The property remains under
therefore,
attached,
court to await judgment. The property
cannot be sold during the pendency of the action. This is the
general rule. It is, however, subject to an exception under Sec.
11 of Rule 57.
2. There may arise circumstances which would justify
the court in authorizing the sale of property attached. After
hearing with notice and it appears to the court, for instance,
that the property attached is perishable, it may order such
property to be sold at public auction. The proceeds of the sale
shall be deposited in court to await the judgment in the action.
The sale may also be ordered by the court if it determines
that doing so will serve the interests of all the parties. Note
that the order of the court shall be made only after notice and
hearing (Sec. 11, Rule 57, Rules of Court).
Thus, it was held that an attached property may be
sold after levy on attachment and before entry of judgment
whenever it shall be made to appear to the court in which the
action is pending, upon hearing with notice to both parties,
that the attached property is perishable or that the interests
of all the parties to the action will be subserved by the sale of
the attached property (China Banking Corporation v. Asian

Construction and Development Corporation, 550 SCRA 585,
592-593).

Remedy of a third person, not a party to the action, whose
property is attached (Bar 2000)

There may arise a situation where the sheriff attaches
the property of a third person who is not even a party to the
action. To attach the property of a stranger to the action is, by

—

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 57 Preliminary Attachment

—

41

all means, highly irregular. Fortunately for such third person,
he has some remedies under the Rules.
1. He may avail of the remedy called terceria by making
an affidavit of his title thereto or his right to the possession
thereof, stating the grounds of such right or title. The affidavit
must be served upon the sheriff while he has possession of the
attached property, and the attaching party (Sec. 14, Rule 57,
Rules of Court).
Upon service of the affidavit upon him, the sheriff shall
not be bound to keep the property under attachment unless
the attaching party files a bond approved by the court. The
sheriff shall not be liable for damages for the taking or keeping
of the property, if such bond shall be filed (Sec. 14, Rule 57,
Rules of Court).

The bond in Sec. 14 of Rule 57 (proceedings where
property is claimed by third person) is different from the bond
in Sec. 3 of the same rule (affidavit and bond). Under Sec. 14
of Rule 57, the purpose of the bond is to indemnify the sheriff
against any claim by the intervenor to the property seized or
for damages arising from such seizure, which the sheriff was
making and for which the sheriff was directly responsible to
the third party. Section 3 of Rule 57, on the other hand, refers
to the attachment bond to assure the return of defendant’s
personal property or the payment of damages to the defendant
if the plaintiffs action to recover possession of the same
property fails (Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation v.
Yllas Lending Corporation, 567 SCRA 454, 472).
2. The third-party claimant may also invoke the court’s
authority in the same case and move for a summary hearing
on his claim. Upon application of the third person through a
motion toset aside the levy on attachment, the court shall order
a summary hearing for the purpose of determining whether
the sheriff has acted rightly or wrongly in the performance
of his duties in the execution of the writ of attachment. The
court may order the sheriff to release the property from the
erroneous levy and to return the same to the third person.
In resolving the application, the court cannot pass upon the

execution stage of the judgment under Rule 39 because, by
then, a judgment has already been rendered. Intervention is
permitted only before the rendition of judgment by the trial
court (Sec. 2, Rule 19, Rules of Court, as amended).
4. The third-party claimant is not precluded by Sec. 14
of Rule 57 from vindicating his claim to the property in the
same or separate action. Thus, he may file a separate action
to nullify the levy with damages resulting from the unlawful
levy and seizure. This action may be a totally distinct action
from the former case (Ching v. Court of Appeals, 423 SCRA
356, 369).
The above remedies are cumulative and any one of them
may be resorted to without availing of the other remedies
(Ching v. Court of Appeals, 423 SCRA 356, 369).
Discharge of attachment; counter-bond and other grounds

A writ of attachment already enforced may be discharged
in the following ways:
(a) By filing a motion to discharge the attachment
and making a deposit or counter-bond.

The first mode is by filing a motion to discharge the
attachment, wholly or in part, on the security given. The
motion shall be filed by the party whose property has been
attached or the person appearing on his behalf. Aside
from the filing of a motion, the movant shall make a cash

Rule 57 Preliminary Attachment

—

43

deposit, or file a counter-bond executed to the attaching
party with the clerk of the court where the application is
made, in an amount equal to that fixed by the court in the
order of attachment, exclusive of costs. However, if the
discharge is sought with respect to a particular property
only, the counter-bond shall be equal to the value of that
property as determined by the court (Sec. 12, Rule 57,
Rules of Court).

After due notice and hearing, the court shall direct
that the attachment be discharged (Sec. 12, Rule 57,
Rules of Court). Note that the rule does not authorize
a discharge of the attachment ex parte. The rule clearly
requires “due notice and hearing.”
Also, the mere posting of the counter-bond does not
automatically discharge the writ of attachment. It is
only after due notice and hearing, and after the judge
has ordered the discharge of attachment that the same is
properly discharged.
The cash deposit or counter-bond shall secure the
payment of any judgment that the attaching party
may recover in the action (Sec. 12, Rule 57, Rules of
Court). Jurisprudence adds that counter-bonds are also
replacements of the property formerly attached, and just
as the latter, may be levied upon after final judgment
(Security Pacific Assurance Corporation v. Tria-Infante,
468 SCRA 526, 536).
The purpose of the counter-bond is different from
the bond posted to obtain a writ of attachment under Sec.
4 of Rule 57 which is to answer for the costs which may
be adjudged to the adverse party and the damages which
he may sustain by reason of the attachment.
(b) By filing a motion to set aside or discharge the
attachment on other grounds without need for filing a

counter-bond.
Under Sec. 13, Rule 57, Rules of Court, the party whose
property has been ordered attached may file a motion with the

I

I

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

court in which the action is pending, for an order to set aside
or discharge the attachment. The motion shall be based on
any of the following grounds:
(a) the attachment was improperly or irregularly
issued or enforced;
(b) the bond is insufficient;
(c) the attachment is excessive (but in this case,
the discharge shall be limited to the excess), and
(d) the property is exempt from execution and, as
such, is also exempt from preliminary attachment (See
Secs. 2 and 5, Rule 57, Rules of Court).
The motion may be filed (i) before levy, (ii) after levy,
or (iii) even after the release of the attached property. If the
motion be made on affidavits on the part of the movant but
not otherwise, the attaching party may oppose the motion
by counter-affidavits or other evidence in addition to that on
which the attachment was made (Sec. 13, Rule 57, Rules of
Court).

After due notice and hearing, the court shall order the
setting aside or the corresponding discharge of the attachment
(Sec. 13, Rule 57, Rules of Court). A discharge of the attachment
must be made only upon notice and after hearing.
When the attachment is challenged for having been
illegally or improperly issued, there must be a hearing with
the burden of proof to sustain the writ being on the attaching
creditor. That hearing includes not only the right to present
evidence but also a reasonable opportunity to know the claims
of the opposing parties and meet them.

It has been held that an ex parte discharge is a disservice
to the orderly administration of justice and nullifies the
underlying role and purpose of preliminary attachment in
preserving the rights of the parties pendente lite as an ancillary
remedy (Peroxide Philippines Corporation u. Court of Appeals,
199 SCRA 882, 891).

Effect of the discharge of the attachment

Upon the discharge of an attachment, the property
attached, or the proceeds of any sale thereof, shall be delivered
to the party making the deposit or giving the counter-bond,
or to the person appearing on his behalf. The deposit or
counterbond shall stand in the place of the property attached
(Sec. 12, Rule 57, Rules of Court).
Damages for a wrongful attachment (Bar 1999, 2008)

1. The tenor of Sec. 20 of Rule 57 does not prevent
the judgment obligor from recovering damages on account of
improper attachment even if the judgment is adverse to him.
Hence, even a party who loses in the main case, but is able to
establish a right to damages by reason of improper, irregular
or excessive attachment, may be entitled to damages.

It was held that the rule, which guarantees a right to
damages incurred by reason of wrongful attachment, has long
been recognized in this jurisdiction. Although Sec. 20, Rule 57
of the 1964 Rules of Court provided that there must be first
a judgment on the action in favor of the party against whom
attachment was issued before damages can be claimed by such
party, the Court, however, subsequently clarified that under
the rule, “recovery for damages may be had by the party thus
prejudiced by the wrongful attachment, even if the judgment
be adverse to him.” The Court adds that “[T]he language used

in the 1997 revision of the Rules of Civil Procedure leaves no
doubt that there is no longer a need for a favorable judgment
in favor of the party against whom attachment was issued in
order that damages may be awarded. It is indubitable that
even a party who loses the action but is able to establish a
right to damages by reason of improper, irregular, or excessive
attachment may be entitled to damages. This bolsters the
notion that the claim for damages arising from such wrongful
attachment may arise and be decided separately from the
merits of the main action” (Carlos v. Sandoval, 471 SCRA
266, 289-290).
Where there is wrongful attachment, the attachment
defendant may recover actual damages even without proof

that the attachment plaintiff acted in bad faith in obtaining
the attachment. However, if it is alleged and established that
the attachment was not merely wrongful but also malicious,
the attachment defendant may recover moral damages and
exemplary damages as well (Spouses Yu v. Ngo Yet Te, 514
SCRA 423, 434-435).
2. Damages may be awarded, on account of improper,
irregular or excessive attachment. The application for
damages must be filed (a) before the trial, or (b) before appeal
is perfected, or (c) before the judgment becomes executory.
There must be notice to the attaching party and his surety or
sureties. The application must set forth the facts showing the
applicant’s right to damages as well as the amount thereof. A
hearing is required before awarding damages (Sec. 20, Rule
57, Rules of Court).
The hearing requirement ties with the indispensable
demand of procedural due process. Due notice to the adverse
party and its surety setting forth the facts supporting the
applicant’s right to damages and the amount thereof under
the bond is essential. No judgment for damages may be
entered and executed against the surety without giving it an
opportunity to be heard as to the reality or reasonableness of
the damages resulting from the wrongful issuance of the writ
(Carlos v. Sandoval, 471 SCRA 266, 283-284).
3. If, however, the case is on appeal and the judgment
of the appellate court is favorable to the party against whom
the attachment was issued, he must claim damages sustained
during the pendency of the appeal by filing an application
in the appellate court with due notice to the attaching party
and his surety or sureties. The application for damages has
to be filed before the judgment of the appellate court becomes
executory (Sec. 20, Rule 57, Rules of Court).

Although the application is filed with the appellate court,
the application may be allowed by the appellate court to be
heard and decided by the trial court (Sec. 20, Rule 57, Rules
of Court).

Preliminary Attachment

Should the bond or deposit given by the attaching
party be insufficient to fully satisfy the award of damages,
the party against whom the attachment was issued may
recover in the same action the damages awarded to him from
any property of the attaching party which is not exempt from
execution (Sec. 20, Rule 57, Rules of Court).
5. To merit an award of actual damages arising from a
wrongful attachment, the attachment defendant must prove,
with the best evidence obtainable, the fact of loss or injury
suffered and the amount thereof. Such loss or injury must
be of the kind which is not only capable of proof but must
actually be proved with a reasonable degree of certainty. As
to its amount, the same must be measurable based on specific
facts, and not on guesswork or speculation. In particular,
if the claim for actual damages covers unrealized profits,
the amount of unrealized profits must be established and
supported by independent evidence of the mean income of
the business undertaking interrupted by the illegal seizure
,j(,
(Spouses Yu v. Ngo Yet Te, 514 SCRA 423, 435).
4.

Judgment to be included in the main case

The judgment for damages shall be included in the
judgment on the main case (Sec. 20, Rule 57, Rules of Court).
This rule suggests that the application for damages is not to
be set up independently of the main action. The rule directs
that the recovery of damages shall be in the same action and
included in the judgment of the case.

Satisfaction of the judgment out of the property attached;
return of sheriff
1. Section 15 of Rule 57 clearly outlines the procedure
for satisfying the judgment in the following manner:
(a) By paying to the judgment obligee the proceeds
of all sales of perishable or other property sold in
pursuance of the order of the court, or so much as shall
be necessary to satisfy the judgment;

CIVIL PROCEDURE

46

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

(b) If any balance remains due, by selling so much
of the property, real or personal, as may be necessary to
satisfy the balance, if enough for that purpose remain in
the sheriffs hands, or in those of the clerk of the court;

and
(c) By collecting from all persons having in their
possession credits belonging to the judgment obligor, or
owing debts to the latter at the time of the attachment
of such credits or debts, the amount of such credits and
debts as determined by the court in the action, and
stated in the judgment, and paying the proceeds of such
collection over to the judgment obligee.

2. The sheriff shall forthwith make a return in writing
to the court of his proceedings and furnish the parties with
copies thereof (Sec. 15 of Rule 57, Rules of Court).
3. If after realizing upon all the property attached,
including the proceeds of any debts or credits collected, and
applying the proceeds to the satisfaction of the judgment, any
balance shall remain due, the sheriff must proceed to collect
such balance as upon ordinary execution. Whenever the
judgment shall have been paid, the sheriff, upon reasonable
demand, must return to the judgment obligor the attached
property remaining in his hands, and any proceeds of the sale
of the property attached not applied to the judgment (Sec. 16,
Rule 57, Rules of Court).

Recovery may also be had on the counter-bond by
requiring the surety on the bond to pay the judgment obligee
upon demand the amount due under the judgment. The said
amount may be recovered from such surety or sureties after
notice and summary hearing in the same action (Sec. 17, Rule
57, Rules of Court).
4.

5. Where money has been deposited instead of giving
a counter-bond, it shall be applied under the direction of the
court to the satisfaction of any judgment rendered in favor of
the attaching party, and after satisfying the judgment, the
balance shall be refunded to the depositor or his assignee. If

forcible entry to recover the possession of the property. This
main action, as mentioned in an early part of this material,
may be coupled with a prayer for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction to restore to the plaintiff
the possession of the property during the pendency of the main
case. In either situation, the purpose is to keep the plaintiff in
possession.

Meaning of preliminary injunction

1. Preliminary injunction is an order granted at
any stage of an action, prior to the judgment or final order,
requiring a party, court, agency or person to perform or refrain
from performing a particular act or acts (Sec. 1, Rule 58, Rules
of Court; Nerwin Industries Corporation v. PNOC-Energy
Development Corporation, 669 SCRA 173, 186, April 11,
2012; Liberty Broadcasting Network, Inc. v. Atlocom Wireless
Systems, Inc., G.R. No. 205875, June 30, 2015; Marcelo v.
Peroxide Phils., Inc., G.R. No. 203492, April 24, 2017; See also
Sumifru [Philippines] Corporation v. Spouses Cereno, G.R.
No. 218236, February 7, 2018).

If it is availed of to require one to refrain from a particular
act, the preliminary injunction is prohibitory. If it requires
the performance of a particular act or acts, the preliminary
injunction is mandatory (See Sec. 1, Rule 58, Rules of
Court). Thus, if one’s land is threatened to be occupied by
another unlawfully, the filing of a main action to prevent the
dispossession becomes imperative. This main action would
necessarily be an action for injunction. This main action
may be coupled with a prayer for the issuance of writ of
a
preliminary prohibitory injunction to prevent the defendant
from performing acts of dispossession in the
meantime that
the rights of the parties are litigated in the principal
action.
The latter, a provisional remedy, is distinguished
from the
main action by the term “preliminary.” Now,
if
the rightful possessor had already been occupied,the land of
let us say,
by force, there is, likewise, a need
to file a main action called
50

Thus, whether the preliminary injunction be prohibitory
or mandatory, the objective of the writ is to maintain the
prevailing state of affairs of the parties prior to the controversy,
i.e., the plaintiff is in possession of the land. Without the writ
of preliminary injunction, the plaintiff would be deprived of
the possession of the property even before the court finally
resolves the conflicting rights of the parties.
2. Notice that the use of a provisional remedy of
preliminary injunction, like every provisional remedy, requires
a main action. This is because jurisprudence and the Rules
have repeatedly held that, it is not a cause of action in itself
but merely a provisional remedy, an adjunct to a main suit
(Estares v. Court of Appeals, 459 SCRA 604, 618) and subject
to the latter’s outcome (Dela Rosa v. Heirs of Juan Valdez,
654 SCRA 467, 478). It is a mere preventive remedy and
only seeks to prevent threatened wrong, further injury, and
irreparable harm or injustice until the rights of the parties
are settled (Republic v. Cortez, G.R. No. 197472, September 7,
2015). These rights are settled, not in the provisional remedy,
but in the principal action.

It is also referred to as a preservative remedy for the
protection of substantive rights and interests (See Cayabyab
v. Dimson, G.R. No. 223862, July 10, 2017) while the main
action is pending.
3. A preliminary injunction, as the term itself suggests,
temporary, subject to the final disposition of the
merely
is
principal action. Its purpose is to preserve the status quo of
the matter subject of the action to protect the rights of the
plaintiff during the pendency of the suit. Otherwise, if no

52

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

preliminary injunction is issued, the defendant may, before
final judgment, do the act which the plaintiff is seeking the
court to restrain. This will make ineffectual the final judgment
that the court may afterwards render in granting relief to the
plaintiff (See Dungog v. Court of Appeals, 408 SCRA 267, 275).
4. Since preliminary injunction is a mere provisional
remedy, the proceedings therein are subject to the outcome

of the main case. Matters resolved in injunction proceedings
do not, as a general rule, conclusively determine the merits of
the main case or decide controverted facts therein (Philippine
Ports Authority [PPA] v. Nasipit Integrated Arrastre and
Stevedoring Services, Inc. fNIASSI], G.R. No. 214864, March
22, 2017).
Preliminary injunction as an equitable remedy

An application for a preliminary injunction is an equitable
remedy, and one who comes to claim for equity must do so with
clean hands. It is to be resorted to by a litigant to prevent or
preserve a right or interest where there is a pressing necessity
to avoid injurious consequences which cannot be remedied
under any standard of compensation. An application for a writ
of preliminary injunction rests upon an alleged existence of
an emergency or of a special reason for such a writ before the
case can be regularly tried. By issuing a writ of preliminary
injunction, the court can thereby prevent a threatened or
continued irreparable injury to the plaintiff before a judgment

can be rendered on the claim (Sps. Nisce v. Equitable PCIBank, 516 SCRA 231, 253-255).

The Court teaches that this is so because among the
maxims of equity are: (1) he who seeks equity must do equity,

and (2) he who comes into equity must come with clean hands
(Palm Tree Estates, Inc. v. Philippine National Bank, G.R.
No. 159370, October 3, 2012). It is the “strong arm of equity,”
an extraordinary peremptory remedy that must be used with
extreme caution, affecting as it does the respective rights
of the parties (China Banking Corporation v. Sps. Ciriaco,
G.R. No. 170038, July 11, 2012).

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 58 — Preliminary Injunction

53

Purpose of preliminary injunction
1. Jurisprudence instructs that the sole purpose of
preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo until the
merits of the main case can be heard. It is usually granted to
prevent a party from committing an act, or threatening the
immediate commission of an act that will cause irreparable
injury or destroy the status quo (Marcelo v. Peroxide Phils.,
Inc., G.R. No. 203492, April 24, 2017).

2. It is well-settled that the sole object of a writ of
preliminary injunction, whether prohibitory or mandatory, is
to preserve the status quo until the merits of the case can be
heard. They are usually granted when it is made to appear that
there is a substantial controversy between the parties and one
of them is committing an act or threatening the immediate
commission of an act that will cause irreparable injury or
destroy the status quo of the controversy before a full hearing
can be had on the merits of the case. In other words, they are
preservative remedies for the protection of substantive rights
or interests, and, hence, not a cause of action in itself, but
merely adjunct to a main suit. In a sense, they are regulatory
processes meant to prevent a case from being mooted by the
interim acts of the parties (Liberty Broadcasting Network,
Inc. v. Atlocom Wireless Systems, Inc., G.R. No. 205875, June
30, 2015; Morales v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 217126-27,
November 10, 2015).

3. Status quo is defined as the last actual, peaceful,
and uncontested status that precedes the actual controversy,
that which is existing at the time of the filing of the case.
Indubitably, the trial court must not make use of its
injunctive power to alter such status (Cortez- Estrada v. Heirs
of Domingo / Antonia Samut, 451 SCRA 275, 288-289; Pineda
v. Court of Appeals, 635 SCRA 274, 283; Spouses Dulnuan
u. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, G.R. No. 196864,
July 8, 2015).
4. Because a writ of preliminary injunction has the
purpose of preserving the status quo between the parties,
courts sometimes issue the so-called status quo order or

M

However, unlike a temporary restraining order or a
preliminary injunction, a status quo order is more in the
nature of a cease and desist order, since it neither directs
prohibitory or
the doing or undoing of acts as in the case of

province of prohibitory or mandatory injunctive relief and not
of a status quo order which is limited only to maintaining the
last, actual, peaceable and uncontested state of things which
immediately preceded the controversy (Oca v. Custodio, G.R.
No. 174996, December 3, 2014).

Grant of a writ of preliminary injunction; not a judgment on
the merits
“An injunctive writ is not a judgment on the merits of the
case. A writ of preliminary injunction is generally based solely
on initial and incomplete evidence. The evidence submitted
during the hearing on an application for a writ of preliminary
injunction is not conclusive or complete, for only a ‘sampling*

is needed to give the trial court an idea of the justification for
the preliminary injunction pending the decision of the case on
the merits.
An order granting a preliminary injunction is not a final
resolution or decision disposing of the case. It is based on a
preliminary determination of the status quo and on petitioner’s
entitlement to the writ.
Thus, the findings of fact and opinion of a court when
issuing the writ of preliminary injunction are interlocutory in
nature and made before the trial on the merits is commenced
or terminated. There may be vital facts to be presented at trial
which may not be obtained or presented during the hearing

—

55

on the application for the injunctive writ. The trial court
needs to conduct substantial proceedings in order to put the
main controversy to rest” (Recto v. Escaler, 634 SCRA 180,
191; For further readings, see Bank of the Philippine Islands
v. Hontanosas, G.R. No. 157163, June 25, 2014; For further
readings, see Borlongan v. Banco de Oro, G.R. No. 21 7617,
April 7, 2017).

A writ of preliminary injunction would become a
prejudgment of a case only when it grants the main prayer in
the complaint or responsive pleading (Levi Strauss [Phils.],
Inc. v. Vogue Traders Clothing Company, G.R. No. 132993,
June 29, 2005 as cited in Borlongan v. Banco de Oro, G.R. No.
217617, April 7, 2017).
Issuance of the writ as subject to judicial discretion

The grant or denial of a writ of preliminary injunction is
discretionary upon the trial court because the assessment and
evaluation of evidence towards that end involve findings of fact
left to the said court for its conclusive determination (Liberty
Broadcasting Network, Inc. v. Atlocom Wireless Systems, Inc.,
G.R. No. 205875, June 30, 2015; See also Cayabyab v. Dimson,
G.R. No. 223862, July 10, 2017). An early case explained that
the reason for the generous latitude given to trial courts in
this regard is that the conflicting claims in an application
for a provisional writ, more often than not, involve a factual
determination which is not the function of appellate courts.
Hence, the exercise of judicial discretion by the trial court
in injunctive matters must not be interfered with except
when there is manifest abuse (Sps. Castro v. Sps. De la Cruz,
639 SCRA 187, 191; See also Cayabyab v. Dimson, G.R. No.
223862, July 10, 2017).

Stage of proceedings when granted
Preliminary injunction is granted at any stage of the
action or proceeding prior to the judgment or final order (Sec.
1, Rule 58, Rules of Court).

(Bar 1978)

Preliminary prohibitory Injunction distinguished from pre¬
liminary mandatory injunction

The following are some distinctions between prohibitory
and mandatory injunctions:
(a) Injunction is prohibitory when it requires one to
refrain from a particular act or acts (Sec. 1, Rule 58, Rules
of Court; City Government of Butuan v. Consolidated
Broadcasting System, 636 SCRA 320, 336).
Injunction is mandatory when it requires the
performance of a particular act or acts (Sec. 1, Rule 58,
Rules of Court). A mandatory injunction commands the
performance of some positive act to correct a wrong in

—

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 58 Preliminary Injunction

—

57

the past (City Government of Butuan v. Consolidated
Broadcasting System, 636 SCRA 320, 336).
(b) In prohibitory injunction, the act has not yet
been performed because it is restrained or prevented
by the injunction. Its purpose is to prevent a future or
threatened injury. Hence, in prohibitory injunction, the
status quo is preserved. It is in this sense, that it is said,
that consummated acts cannot be enjoined.
In mandatory injunction, the act has already been
performed and this act has violated the rights of another.
Since the act has already been performed, the purpose of the
injunction is to restore the status quo and then preserve the
said status quo which has been restored.

Preliminary injunction distinguished from the main action
for injunction (Bar 2006)

An injunction may either be an action in itself or a
provisional remedy. As an action in itself, it is a main action
for injunction and, as a provisional remedy, it is a preliminary
injunction (Agoo Rice Mill Corporation v. Land Bank of the
Philippines, G.R. No. 173036, September 26, 2012).
1. Preliminary injunction is not a principal action and
can only exist as an incident to a principal action (Bacolod
City Water District v. Labayen, 446 SCRA 110, 122; BP
Philippines, Inc. v. Clark Trading Corporation, G.R. No.
175284, September 19, 2012). As a provisional remedy, it is
not a cause of action in itself but merely an adjunct to a main
suit (Mabayo Farms, Inc. v. CA, 386 SCRA 110, 115; Spouses
Dulnuan v. Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company, G.R. No.
196864, July 8, 2015).
Injunction is a principal action and a cause of an action
in itself. It can even be coupled with an application for a writ
of preliminary injunction, the latter being the provisional
remedy.
2. A preliminary injunction does not seek a permanent
injunction. That is the reason for its being called “preliminary.”

CIVIL PROCEDURE

58

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

It is designed to require a party or a court, agency or a person

to refrain from a particular act or acts during the pendency of
the principal case (See Sec. 1, Rule 58, Rules of Court).
The main action for injunction seeks a judgment
embodying a final injunction. It is final when it is issued as
a judgment making the injunction permanent. It perpetually
restrains a person from the commission or continuance of
an act or confirms the previous preliminary mandatory
injunction (Sec. 9, Rule 58, Rules of Court; See also Bank of
the Philippine Islands v. Hong, 666 SCRA 71, 79, February 15,
2012). It is issued when the court, after trial on the merits, is
convinced that the applicant is entitled to have the act or acts
complained of permanently enjoined (Republic v. Cortez, G.R.
No. 197472, September 7, 2015).
3. A preliminary injunction is an order granted at any
stage of an action or proceeding prior to the judgment or final
order (Sec. 1, Rule 58, Rules of Court).
An injunction as a main action is granted after the trial
of the action if it appears that the applicant is entitled to have
the act or acts complained of permanently enjoined (Sec. 9,
Rule 58, Rules of Court). The injunction is permanent and
forms part of the judgment on the merits and it can only be
properly ordered on final judgment. (Zuneca Pharmaceutical
v. Natrapharm, Inc., G.R. No. 197802, November 11, 2015).

The hearing on the application for issuance of a
writ of preliminary injunction is separate and distinct from
the trial on the merits of the main case for injunction (Juana
Complex I Homeowners Association, Inc. v. Fil-Estate Land,
Inc., 667 SCRA 440, 453, March 5, 2012).
4.

5. A writ of preliminary injunction is generally based

the justification for the preliminary injunction pending the
decision of the case (Zuneca Pharmaceutical u. Natrapharm,

G.R. No. 172983, July 22, 2015; Republic v. Cortez, G.R. No.
197472, September 7, 2015).
In an injunction as a principal action, the right and the act
violative thereof must be established with absolute certainty
to be a basis for a final and permanent injunction (Republic v.
Cortez, G.R. No. 197472, September 7, 2015).
6. An order granting preliminary injunction is not
a final resolution or decision disposing of the case. The

findings of fact and opinion of a court when issuing the writ
of preliminary injunction are interlocutory in nature (Recto
v. Escaler, 634 SCRA 180, 191). Hence, the order of the court
may be challenged by a petition for certiorari under Rule 65
(Sec. 1(b), Rule 41, Rules of Court).
A judgment for a permanent injunction suit should be
assailed by a timely appeal (See Casilan v. Ibanez, 6 SCRA
590, 592-593).

Preliminary injunction distinguished from restraining order

Writs of preliminary injunction are granted only upon
prior notice to the party sought to be enjoined and upon
their due hearing, xxx Thus, Rule 58 requires “a full and
comprehensive hearing for the determination of the propriety
of the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction,” giving the
applicant an opportunity to prove that great or irreparable
injury will result if no writ is issued and allowing the opposing
party to comment on the application. On the other hand, a
temporary restraining order that is heard only with the
evidence presented by its applicant is ex parte, but it is issued
to preserve the status quo until the hearing for preliminary
injunction can be conducted.

Preliminary injunction is an order granted at any stage
of an action or proceeding prior to the judgment or final order,
requiring a party or a court, agency or a person to perform
to refrain from performing a particular act or acts. As an
extraordinary remedy, injunction is calculated to preserve or

case can be heard. A preliminary

the
is dissolved or until the termination of
court issuing a final injunction.
The basic purpose of restraining order, on the other
hand, is to preserve the status quo until the hearing of the
application for preliminary injunction. Under the former Rule
58 of the Rules of Court, as amended by B.P. 224, a judge (or
justice) may issue a temporary restraining order with a limited
life of 20 days from date of issue. If before the expiration of
the 20-day period the application for preliminary injunction
is denied, the temporary order would thereby be deemed
automatically vacated. If no action is taken by the judge on
the application for preliminary injunction within the said 20
days, the temporary restraining order would automatically
expire on the 20th day by the sheer force of law, no judicial
declaration to that effect being necessary. In the instant case,
no such preliminary injunction was issued; hence, the TRO
earlier issued automatically expired under the aforesaid
provision of the Rules of Court (Bicol Medical Center, et al. v.
Botor, et al., G.R. No. 214073, October 4, 2017).
Example of acts subject to the main action for injunction
Examples of acts which may be enjoined through the
main action of injunction are those mentioned in Art. 26 of

the Civil Code of the Philippines. These are:
(a) Prying into the privacy of another’s residence;
(b) Meddling with or disturbing the private life or
family relations of another;
(c) Intriguing to cause another to be alienated from
his friends; and
(d) Vexing or humiliating another on account of
his religious beliefs, lowly station in life, place of birth,
physical defect, or other personal condition.

Rule 68

Immediate execution of a judgment in an action for injunction
A judgment in an action for injunction is immediately
executory, i.e., it is enforceable after its rendition and shall
not be stayed by an appeal taken therefrom, unless otherwise
ordered by the trial court. The stay of execution shall be upon
such terms as to bond or otherwise as may be considered proper
for the security or protection of the rights of the adverse party
(Sec. 4, Rule 39, Rules of Court).
Preliminary prohibitory injunction distinguished from a
petition for prohibition
1. Preliminary prohibitory injunction is not an
independent action while a petition for prohibition is an
independent action.
2. Preliminary prohibitory injunction, in its frequent
application, is one that is generally directed against a party
litigant, although under the Rules, it may be also be directed
against a court, an agency or person (Sec. 1, Rule 58, Rules of
Court).
A petition for prohibition, as a special civil action, is
not directed against a party-litigant but against a tribunal,
corporation, board, officer or person exercising judicial, quasi¬
judicial or ministerial functions (Sec. 2, Rule 65, Rules of
Court).
3. Preliminary prohibitory injunction applies even if
there is no issue of jurisdiction, grave abuse of discretion, or
other similar acts which amount to lack of jurisdiction.

A petition for prohibition applies when the acts or
proceedings of any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or
person are without or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.
Hence, the basis of prohibition is a jurisdictional issue (Sec. 2,
Rule 65, Rules of Court).

Preliminary mandatory injunction distinguished from a
petition for mandamus
1. Preliminary mandatory injunction is a provisional
remedy, not a main or independent action. Mandamus is a
special civil action and a main action.

2. Preliminary mandatory injunction is generally
directed against a party litigant although, under the Rules,
it may also be issued against a court, agency or person (Sec.
1, Rule 58, Rules of Court). Mandamus is directed against
a tribunal, board, officer or person (Sec. 3, Rule 65, Rules of
Court).

3. Preliminary mandatory injunction is issued to
require a party to perform an act (Sec. 1, Rule 58, Rules of
Court) in order to restore the last peaceable and uncontested
status preceding the controversy.

Mandamus is one which seeks a judgment commanding
a tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person to perform a
duty which the law specifically enjoins as a duty either because
there was an unlawful neglect of such duty or a person was
unlawfully excluded from the use and enjoyment of an office to
which such person is entitled (Sec. 3, Rule 65, Rules of Court).
4. Preliminary mandatory injunction may be directed
against any act. Mandamus is directed against ministerial

acts.

Court that Issues writ of preliminary Injunction
1. Preliminary injunction is to be issued by the court
where the principal action is pending (Sec. 2, Rule 58, Rules of
Court). The term “court” includes a Municipal or a Metropolitan
Trial Court. Where the principal action is pending in the
Municipal Trial Court, then it is this court which shall issue
the writ of preliminary injunction. Where the principal action
is pending in the Regional Trial Court, then, it is this court
which shall issue the wnt of preliminary injunction.
Illustrations: (a) A party desiring to appeal from
the judgment or final order of the Court of Appeals, may

—

file a petition for review on certiorari with the Supreme
Court. The petition may include an application for a
writ of preliminary injunction. Since it is the Supreme
Court which has jurisdiction over the appeal, it is also
such court which shall have jurisdiction to issue the writ
applied for (See Sec. 1, Rule 45, Rules of Court).
(b) Under Sec. 20 of Rule 70, the plaintiff may,
within 10 days from the perfection of the appeal to the
Regional Trial Court in an unlawful detainer or forcible
entry case, file a motion for the court to issue a writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction to restore him in his
possession. Since the appealed case is pending in the
Regional Trial Court, it is this court which shall issue the
writ of preliminary injunction.

(c) Where a petition for certiorari is pending in the
Court of Appeals, and the petitioner seeks to interrupt the
course of the principal case through a writ of preliminary

injunction (Sec. 7, Rule 65, Rules of Court), the writ shall
be issued by the Court of Appeals because it is before this
court where the principal action for certiorari is pending.

2. If the main action is for injunction, the Municipal
Trial Court cannot grant the preliminary injunction. This is
because an action for injunction is one incapable of pecuniary
estimation. Under the clear terms of Sec. 19[1] of B.P. 129,
as amended, the Regional Trial Court shall exercise exclusive
original jurisdiction in all civil actions in which the subject
matter of the litigation is incapable of pecuniary estimation.

3. If the principal action or proceeding is pending in
the Court of Appeals, the application for the issuance of a
writ of preliminary injunction must be made with the Court
of Appeals and the writ shall be issued by said court or any of
its members. If it is pending in the Supreme Court, then the
application must be made with that court and the writ may
also be issued by the same court or any member thereof (Sec.
2, Rule 58, Rules of Court).

Grounds for the issuance of writ of a preliminary injunction

Section 3, Rule 58 of the Rules of Court provides that
a preliminary injunction may be granted when the following
have been established:
(a) That the applicant is entitled to the relief
demanded, and the whole or part of such relief consists
in restraining the commission or continuance of the act
or acts complained of, or in requiring the performance of
an act or acts, either for a limited period or perpetually;
(b) That the commission, continuance or non¬
performance of the act or acts complained of during the
litigation would probably work injustice to the applicant;

*

If
>

or
(c) That a party, court, agency or a person is doing,
threatening, or is attempting to do, or is procuring or
suffering to be done, some act or acts probably in violation
of the rights of the applicant respecting the subject of the
action or proceeding, and tending to render the judgment
ineffectual (Nerwin Industries Corporation v. PNOCEnergy Development Corporation, 669 SCRA 173, 186,
April 11, 2012; For further readings, see Kang v. Pagbilao
Development Corporation, G.R. No. 195374, March 10,
2014; See also Sumifru [Philippines] Corporation v.
Spouses Cereno, G.R. No. 218236, February 7, 2018).

Jurisprudential requisites for issuing a preliminary Injunction

Interpreting the provisions of Sec. 3 of Rule 58,
mentioned in the immediately preceding topic, the Court
1.

explains:

Section 3, Rule 58 of the 1997 Revised Rules on Civil
Procedure provides that a wnt of preliminary injunction,
whether mandatory or prohibitory, may be granted if the
following requisites are met.
(1) there exists a clear and
unmistakable right to
be protected; (2) this right is directly threatened by an
act sought to be enjoined; (3) the
invasion of the right

|
'

5
t

66

is material and substantial; and (4) there is an urgent
and paramount necessity for the writ to prevent serious
and irreparable damage. As such, a writ of preliminary
injunction may be issued only upon clear showing of an
actual existing right to be protected during the pendency
of the principal action. The requisites of a valid injunction
are the existence of the right and its actual or threatened
violations. Thus, to be entitled to an injunctive writ, the
right to be protected and the violation against the right
must be shown” (Spouses Dulnuan v. Metropolitan Bank
& Trust Company, G.R. No. 196864, July 8, 2015; Marcelo
v. Peroxide Phils., Inc., G.R. No. 203492, April 24, 2017;
See also Borlongan v. Banco De Oro [formerly Equitable
PCI Bank], G.R. No. 217617, April 5, 2017; AMA Land,
Inc. v. Wack Wack Residents Association, Inc., G.R. No.
202342, July 19, 201 7).
2. In satisfying these requisites, the applicant for the
writ need not substantiate his or her claim with complete
and conclusive evidence since only prima facie evidence
or a sampling is required “to give the court an idea of the
justification for the preliminary injunction pending the
decision of the case on the merits” (Bicol Medical Center, et al.
v. Botor, et al., G.R. No. 214073, October 4, 2017).

3. The very foundation of the jurisdiction to issue a
writ of injunction rests on the existence of a cause of action
and in the probability of irreparable injury, inadequacy of
pecuniary compensation, and the prevention of multiplicity of
suits (Cahambing v. Espinosa, G.R. No. 215807, January 25,
2017).
Clear and unmistakable right

1. A preliminary injunctive writ under Rule 58 issues
only upon a showing of the applicant’s “clear legal right” being
violated or under threat of violation by the defendant. “Clear
legal right,” within the meaning of Rule 58, contemplates a
right “clearly founded in or granted by law.” Any hint of doubt
or dispute on the asserted legal right precludes the grant of

66

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)
VOLUME II

PART I

preliminary injunctive relief (Executive Secretary, et al. v.
Forerunner Multi Resources, Inc., G.R. No. 188768, January
7, 2013).
2. For a writ of preliminary injunction to be issued,
the applicant must show, by prima facie evidence, an existing
right before trial, a material and substantial invasion of this
right, and that a writ of preliminary injunction is necessary
to prevent irreparable injury (Philippine Charity Sweepstakes
Office v. De Leon, G.R. Nos. 236577 and 236597, August 15,
2018). The right sought to be protected must be a present right,
a legal right which must be shown to be clear and positive.
Accordingly, this means that the applicants praying for the
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction “must show that
they have an ostensible right to the final relief prayed for in
their complaint” (Juana Complex I Homeowners Association,
Inc. v. Fil-Estate Land, Inc., 667 SCRA 440, 452, March 5,
2012; See also Lim v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 190134, July
8, 2015). While a clear showing of the right is necessary, its
existence need not be conclusively established. To be entitled
to the writ, it is sufficient that the complainant shows that
he has an ostensible right to the final relief prayed for in his
complaint (Marcelo v. Peroxide Phils., Inc., G.R. No. 203492,
April 24, 2017).

3. A more recent pronouncement by the Court
reiterates the rule that in an application for injunctive relief,
it is incumbent on the applicant to establish the actual and
existing right sought to be protected. The Court adds that the
applicant must also prove that there is an urgent need for the
writ to be issued, in order to prevent grave and irreparable
injury. Failure to establish the aforementioned requisites will
warrant the denial of the application (Sevilla v. Commission
on Elections, G.R. No. 227797, November 13, 2018).
4. Injunction is not designed to protect contingent or
future rights. Where the complainant’s right is doubtful or
disputed, injunction is not proper. The possibility of irreparable
damage without proof of actual existing right
is not a ground
for an injunction (Manila International Airport
Authority v.

Rule 58

Rivera Village Lessee Homeowners’ Association, Incorporated,

u Sps. Ciriaco, G.R. No. 170038, July 11, 2012).

I

5.
The issuance of a preliminary injunction rests
entirely within the discretion of the court taking cognizance
of the case and is generally not interfered with except in cases
of manifest abuse. For the issuance of the writ of preliminary
injunction to be proper, it must be shown that the invasion of
the right sought to be protected is material and substantial,
that the right of complainant is clear and unmistakable and
that there is an urgent and paramount necessity for the writ
to prevent serious damage. In the absence of a clear legal
right, the issuance of a writ of injunction constitutes grave
abuse of discretion.

The possibility of irreparable damage without proof of
actual existing right is no ground for an injunction. Injunction
is not designed to protect contingent or future rights. It is not
proper when the complainant’s right is doubtful or disputed
(TML Gasket Industries, Inc. v. BPI Family Savings Bank,
Inc., G.R. No. 188768, January 7, 2013).
6. In one case, the RTC, through a writ of injunction,
directed the respondent to desist from terminating the
services of the petitioner despite the lapse of its service
contract with the respondent until orders from said court. The
Supreme Court struck down said order as inconsistent with
basic rules on injunction. The petitioner, who no longer has
legal rights under a contract that has expired, cannot prevent
the respondent from entering into a contract with another
through a writ of injunction because a contract is entered
into, renewed or revived by mutual consent. By preventing
the respondent from negotiating a contract with another, the
RTC, in effect extended the life of the expired contract.

As the Court puts it: “Therefore, it has not met the first
vital requisite that it must have material and substantial rights
that have to be protected by the courts. It bears stressing that
an injunction is not a remedy to protect or enforce contingent,
abstract, or future rights; it will not issue to protect a right not

in esse and which may never arise, or to restrain an act which
does not give rise to a cause of action. There must exist an
actual right. Verily, petitioner cannot lay claim to an actual,
clear and positive right based on an expired service contract”
(Thunder Security and Investigation Agency v. National Food
Authority [Region I], 654 SCRA 714, 724).

i. When the charges are manifestly false and
motivated by the lust for vengeance; and
j.
When there is clearly no prima facie case against
the accused and a motion to quash on that ground has
been denied (BPI u. Hontanosas, G.R. No. 157163, June
25, 2014).

Irreparable injury

Injunction only seeks to prevent threatened wrong,
further injury, and irreparable harm or injustice until the
rights of the parties can be settled. Fear of potential loss of
possession and ownership, or facing a criminal prosecution
do not constitute the requisite irreparable injury that could
warrant the issuance of the writ of injunction. As a general
rule, the courts will not issue writs of prohibition or injunction
- whether preliminary or final - in order to enjoin or restrain
any criminal prosecution. But there are extreme cases in
which exceptions to the general rule have been recognized,
including:

a. When the injunction is necessary to afford
adequate protection to the constitutional rights of the
accused;
b. When it is necessary for the orderly
administration of justice or to avoid oppression or
multiplicity of actions;
c. When there is a prejudicial question that is

subjudice;

Formal requisites for issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction (Bar 2006) or a temporary restraining order
The applicable provisions of the Rules of Court enumerate
the following requisites for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction or a temporary restraining order:
(a) There must be a verified application (Sec. 4[a],
Rule 58, Rules of Court). Absence of a verification makes
an application or petition for preliminary injunction
patently insufficient both in form and substance (Rivera
v. Mirasol, 434 SCRA 315, 320).
(b) The applicant must post a bond, unless exempted
by the court. This bond, which shall be in an amount to
be fixed by the court, is executed in favor of the party
enjoined to the effect that the applicant shall pay to the
party enjoined all damages which he may sustain by
reason of the preliminary injunction or the restraining
order if the court should finally decide that the applicant
was not entitled to the writ or order (Sec. 4[b], Rule 58,
Rules of Court). (Bar 2006)

g.

(c) As to a writ of preliminary injunction, the court
must conduct a hearing. A writ of preliminary injunction
cannot be issued without a prior notice and hearing.
Under the Rules, “No preliminary injunction shall be
granted without hearing and prior notice to the party or
persons sought to be enjoined” (Sec. 5, Rule 58, Rules of
Court). It cannot be issued ex parte. (Bar 2001)

prosecution;

The application for a temporary restraining order
shall thereafter be acted upon only after all parties are
heard in a summary hearing which shall be conducted

d.

When the acts of the officer are without or in
excess of authority;
e. When the prosecution is under an invalid law,
ordinance or regulation;
f. When double jeopardy is clearly apparent;

When the court has no jurisdiction over the
offense;
h. When it is a case of persecution rather than

within twenty-four (24) hours after the sheriffs return
of service and/or the records are received by the branch
selected by raffle and to which the records shall be
transmitted immediately (Sec. 4[dJ, Rule 58, Rules of
Court).

Note: Section 4 of Rule 58 establishes the same
requirements for the issuance of a preliminary injunction and
a temporary restraining order except that the latter may, in
some cases, be issued ex parte pursuant to Sec. 5 of Rule 58,
Rules of Court.
Posting of a bond
1. “An applicant for preliminary injunction is required
file
a bond executed to the party or person sought to be
to
enjoined, to the effect that the applicant will pay to such party
or person all damages which he may sustain by reason of
the injunction x x x. The purpose of the injunction bond is to
protect the defendant against loss or damage by reason of the
injunction in case the court finally decides that the plaintiff
was not entitled to it, and the bond is usually conditioned
accordingly” (Land Bank of the Philippines v. Heirs of Listana,
649 SCRA 416, 426-427).

2. The applicant for a writ of preliminary injunction
may, however, be exempted by the court from posting a bond
(Sec. 4[b], Rule 58, Rules of Court).
3. The party filing a bond shall serve a copy of such bond
on the other party. The latter may take exceptions or object to
the sufficiency of the bond, or of the surety or sureties thereon.
If the applicant’s bond is found to be insufficient in amount,
and a bond sufficient in amount with sufficient sureties is
not filed, the injunction shall be dissolved. If the bond of the
adverse party is found to be insufficient in amount, and a bond
sufficient in amount is not filed forthwith, the injunction shall
be granted or restored, as the case may be (Sec. 7, Rule 58,
Rules of Court).

4. In one early case, a judge was made a respondent in
a special civil action for prohibition in his official capacity as

——

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 58 Preliminary Injunction

71

judge of a municipal court. The then Court of First Instance
issued a writ of preliminary injunction after the petitioner
had posted a bond to answer for whatever damages the judge
may sustain by reason of the issuance of said writ.
The Supreme Court ruled that the posting of said bond
should not have been ordered in the first place, as no private
person would be prejudiced by the preliminary injunction.
The judge was not made a respondent as a private person.
Consequently, any damage or expense incurred by him in
connection with the case would be official in nature and, for
which, no fund of private origin has to answer. Thus, the
portion of the order, which held the cash bond posted by the
petitioner answerable for whatever damages the judge may
claim, should be set aside (Lim u. Callejo, 105 SCRA 683, 691).

Rule on prior or contemporary service of summons; when
not required

1. Recall that, under the Rules, a preliminary injunction
may be granted at any stage of the proceedings but prior to
the judgment or final order (Sec. 1, Rule 58, Rules of Court).
Hence, an application for a writ of preliminary injunction or a
temporary restraining order may be included in a complaint
or any initiatory pleading (Sec. 4[c], Rule 58, Rules of Court).

2. If the case is filed in a multi-sala court, the case
shall be raffled but only after notice to and in the presence of
the party sought to be enjoined. It is, however, required that
the notice be preceded or contemporaneously accompanied by
service of summons upon the adverse party. Together with the
summons shall be a copy of the complaint and the applicant’s
affidavit and bond (Sec. 4[c], Rule 58, Rules of Court).
However, where the summons could not be served upon
the defendant either in person or by substituted service despite
diligent efforts or when the defendant is temporarily out of
the Philippines or when he is a non-resident, the requirement
of prior or contemporaneous service shall not apply (Sec. 4fc],
Rule 58, Rules of Court).

CIVIL PROCEDURE

Notice and hearing (Bar 1998, 2001)

A writ of preliminary injunction cannot be issued without
a prior notice and hearing. Under the Rules, No preliminary
injunction shall be granted without hearing and prior notice
to the party or persons sought to be enjoined” (Sec. 5, Rule 58,
Rules of Court; Lim v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 190134, July
8, 2015). It cannot be issued ex parte. (Bar 2001)
Temporary restraining order (Bar 2006)
1. A restraining order, more commonly known as a
temporary restraining order (TRO), is issued to preserve
the status quo until the hearing of the application for a writ

of preliminary injunction because the injunction cannot
be issued ex parte (Bacolod Water District u. Labayen, 446
SCRA 110, 122-123). By its nature, it could be considered as
a “provisional remedy within a provisional remedy” because it
is issued to preserve the status quo for a limited period until
the court decides to issue a writ of preliminary injunction.
The applicant shall file a bond, unless exempted by
the court (Sec. 4fb], Rule 58, Rules of Court). The rule grants
the court the discretion on the matter of the posting of a bond.
This grant of discretion is not, however, intended to give the
judge the license to exercise such discretion arbitrarily to the
prejudice of the defendant. Unless it appears that the enjoined
party will not suffer any damage, the presiding judge must
require the applicant to post a bond; otherwise, the courts
could become instruments of oppression and harassment
(Universal Motors Corporation v. Rojas, Sr., 459 SCRA 14,
23).
2.

3. If it shall appear from facts shown by affidavits or
by the verified application that great or irreparable injury
would result to the applicant before the matter can be heard
on notice, the court, in which the application for preliminary
injunction was made, may issue a temporary restraining order
(TRO) ex parte for a period not exceeding 20 days from service
on the party or person sought to be enjoined.

Rule 68

Within the said 20-day period, the court has an important
duty. The court must order said party or person to show cause
why the injunction should not be granted. Also, within the
same period, the court shall determine whether or not the
preliminary injunction shall be granted and then issue the
corresponding order (Sec. 5, Rule 58, Rules of Court; For
further readings, see Australian Professional Realty, Inc. v.
Municipality of Padre Garcia, Batangas Province, 668 SCRA
253, 261, March 14, 2012; Lim v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No.
190134, July 8, 2015).
4. If the matter is of extreme urgency, and the applicant
will suffer grave injustice and irreparable injury, the executive
judge of a multi-sala court or the presiding judge of a singlesala court may issue ex parte a TRO effective for only 72 hours
from issuance, not service. There is also a need to immediately
comply with the requirement on service of summons and other
documents as provided for in Sec. 4 (Sec. 5, Rule 58, Rules of
Court).

Within this period, the judge, before whom the case is
pending, shall conduct a summary hearing to determine
whether or not the TRO can be extended to 20 days. The 72hour period shall be included in the maximum 20-day period
set by the Rules (Sec. 5, Rule 58, Rules of Court). When the
court is a multi-sala court, the TRO is not to be issued by any
other judge other than the executive judge of said court. (Bar
1988, 2006)
5. A temporary restraining order is issued to preserve
the status quo until the hearing of the application for
preliminary injunction. For this purpose, the judge, under
Sec. 5 of Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, may issue a temporary
restraining order with a limited life of 20 days from service on
the party or person sought to be enjoined.
Jurisprudence holds that if, before the expiration of the
20-day period, the application for preliminary injunction is
denied, the temporary restraining order would be deemed
automatically vacated. If no action is taken by the judge

74

within the 20-day period, the temporary restraining order
would automatically expire on the 20th day by the sheer force
of law, no judicial declaration to that effect being necessary
(Bacolod City Water District v. Labayen, 446 SCRA 110, 124).

Duration of a temporary restraining order (Bar 1988, 2012);
duration not extendible (Bar 2006)

6. The rule against the non-extendibility of the 20-day
effectivity of a temporary restraining order is absolute if issued
by a Regional Trial Court. The failure of the trial court to fix
a period in the temporary restraining order does not convert
it to a preliminary injunction. Where there is an omission to
fix the period, the 20-day period is deemed incorporated in the
order (Bacolod City Water District v. Labayen, supra).

7. It is improper for a judge to order a hearing on the
issuance of a temporary restraining order where it was not
prayed for in the complaint (Universal Motors Corporation v.
Rojas, Sr., 459 SCRA 14, 21).
When rule against non-extendibility of a TRO applies; when
not applicable
1. Section 5 (3rd par.) provides that “In the event that
the application for preliminary injunction is denied or not
resolved within the said period, the temporary restraining
order is deemed automatically vacated. The effectivity of a
temporary restraining order is not extendible without need of
any judicial declaration to that effect, and no court shall have
authority to extend or renew the same on the same ground for
which it was issued” (Emphasis supplied). (Bar 1993)
2. It appears that the provision does not impose upon
courts a blanket prohibition to extend or renew a temporary
restraining order. Extending or renewing the temporary
restraining order is prohibited if the extension or renewal is
based on the very same ground upon which the temporary
restraining order was originally issued. If another basis or
ground should exist, aside from the original ground relied
upon while the temporary restraining order is in effect, an
extension or renewal of the order could be made subject,
however, to the same period limitations imposed by the Rules.

1. When it appears that great or irreparable injury
would result to the applicant, the court, where the application
for preliminary injunction was made, may issue a temporary
restraining order (TRO) ex parte for a period not exceeding 20
days from service on the party sought to be enjoined (Sec. 5,
par. 1, Rule 58, Rules of Court).
If the matter is of extreme urgency and the applicant will
suffer grave injustice and irreparable injury, the executive
judge of a multiple-sala court or the presiding judge of a singlesala court may issue ex parte a temporary restraining order
effective for only 72 hours from issuance, but shall immediately
comply with the rule on prior or contemporaneous service of
summons and the documents to be served therewith, unless
the same could not be served personally or by substituted
service despite diligent efforts or for other reasons stated in the
rule. This period may be extended for a period not exceeding
20 days including the original 72 hours already given (Sec. 5,
par. 2, Rule 58, Rules of Court).

In the event that the application for preliminary injunc¬
tion is denied or not resolved within 20 days, the temporary
restraining order is deemed automatically vacated. The effec¬
tivity of a temporary restraining order is not extendible with¬
out need of any judicial declaration to that effect, and no court
shall have authority to extend or renew the same on the same
ground for which it was issued (Sec. 5, par. 3, Rule 58, Rules
of Court).
Note: The effectivity of a TRO issued for 72 hours takes
effect upon issuance and not from its service or notice to the
party or person sought to be enjoined. If issued originally to be
effective for 20 days, the TRO takes effect from service on the
party or person sought to be enjoined.
2. A temporary restraining order (TRO) may be issued
by the Court of Appeals or any member thereof. If so issued,
it shall be effective for 60 days from service on the party or

76

person sought to be enjoined (Sec. 5, par. 4, Rule 58, Rules of
Court). (Bar 1988, 2012)
A temporary restraining order issued by the Court of
Appeals cannot exist indefinitely; it has a lifetime of a non¬
extendible period of 60 days and automatically expires on
the 60th day. (Bar 2006) No judicial declaration that it has
expired is necessary and the lower courts, including the Court
of Appeals, have no discretion to extend the same. A second
TRO by the Court of Appeals after the expiration of the 60day period is a patent nullity (Re: Complaint Against Justice
Elvi John S. Asuncion of the Court of Appeals, A.M. No. 066-8-CA; Padilla u. Asuncion, A.M. No. 06-44-CA-J, 518 SCRA
512, 526).
3. A temporary restraining order (TRO) may also be
issued by the Supreme Court or a member thereof. If so issued,
it shall be effective until further orders (Sec. 5, par. 4, Rule 58,
Rules of Court). (Bar 1998)

Examples of cases justifying the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction
1. The provisional remedy may be availed of when a
petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is
filed. The filing of a petition does not interrupt the course of
the principal case unless a temporary restraining order or a
writ of preliminary injunction is issued against the respondent
tribunal or officer (Sec. 7, Rule 65, Rules of Court; See also
Diaz v. Diaz, 331 SCRA 302, 319). Settled is the rule that, to
arrest the course of the principal action during the pendency
of certiorari proceedings, there must be a restraining order or
a writ of preliminary injunction from the higher court directed
to the lower court (People v. Almendros, 401 SCRA 555, 571).

Illustration: Defendant filed a petition for certiorari
alleging that the Metropolitan Trial Court gravely abused
its discretion in denying his motion to dismiss and the
subsequent motion for reconsideration. During the pendency
of the petition in the Regional Trial Court, the plaintiff filed
a motion to declare the defendant in default for failure to file

—

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 58 Preliminary Injunction

—

77

an answer to the complaint within the reglementary period.
The Metropolitan Trial Court, if it grants the motion, cannot
be considered to have committed a procedural error. This is
because the period to file an answer was not interrupted by
the filing of the petition. The defendant should have obtained
a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order
from the Regional Trial Court to interrupt the course of the
case in the Metropolitan Trial Court. (Bar 2003)
2. Preliminary injunction may be availed of when a
petition for relief, under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, is filed.
The petition for relief, which is an equitable remedy, is filed
after a judgment has already become final and executory.
Assuming that the prevailing party has not yet filed a motion
for an order of execution, the pendency of a petition for relief
will not prevent a motion for the execution of the judgment.
To stay its execution, the issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction should be applied for in the court where the petition
is filed. (Bar 2002)

3. A writ of preliminary injunction may also be availed
of when an action to annul a judgment is filed under Rule 47
to prevent the execution of the judgment.
4. A preliminary mandatory injunction may be availed
of to restore the plaintiff in his possession in a complaint for
forcible entry or unlawful detainer.
Section 15, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court provides that “A
possessor deprived of his possession through forcible entry or
unlawful detainer may, within five (5) days from the filing of
the complaint, present a motion in the action for forcible entry
or unlawful detainer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
mandatory injunction to restore him in his possession.”

Prohibition on injunctions under R.A. 8975 (An Act to
Ensure the Expeditious Implementation and Completion of
Government Infrastructure Projects) (Bar 2012)
1. To enable the State to ensure expeditious and efficient
implementation and completion of government infrastructure

projects,

avoid unnecessary increase in construction,
maintenance and/or repair costs and immediately enjoy the
social and economic benefits therefrom, Sec. 3 of R.A. 8975
specifically provides:

“No court, except the Supreme Court, shall issue
any temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction
or preliminary mandatory injunction against the
government or any of its subdivisions, officials or any
person or entity, whether public or private acting under
the government direction, to restrain, prohibit or compel
the following acts:
(a) Acquisition, clearance and development of
the right-of-way and/or site or location of any national
government project;
(b) Bidding or awarding of contract/project of the
national government as defined in Sec. 2 hereof;
(c) Commencement, prosecution, execution, imple¬
mentation, operation of any such contract or project;

(d) Termination or rescission of any such contract/
project; and
(e) The undertaking or authorization of any other
lawful activity necessary for such contract/project.”

2. Thus, it was ruled: “A Regional Trial Court (RTC)
that ignores the statutory prohibition and issues a TRO or
a writ of preliminary injunction or preliminary mandatory
injunction against a government contract or project acts
contrary to law” (Nerwin Industries Corporation u. PNOCEnergy Development Corporation, 669 SCRA 173, 174-175,
April 11, 2012).

3. The rationale for the law is easily discernible. In¬
junctions and restraining orders tend to derail the
expeditious
and efficient implementation and completion of government
infrastructure projects; increase construction, maintenance
and repair costs; and delay the enjoyment of
the social and

——

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 58 Preliminary Injunction

79

economic benefits therefrom. Thus, unless the matter is of
extreme urgency involving a constitutional issue, judges of
lower courts who shall issue injunctive writs or restraining
orders in violation of the law shall be administratively liable.
The law is clear that what is prohibited is merely the
issuance of provisional orders enjoining the implemen¬
tation of a national government project. R.A. 8975 does not
bar lower courts from assuming jurisdiction over complaints
that seek the nullification or implementation of a national
government infrastructure project as ultimate relief
(Hontiveros-Baraquel u. Toll Regulatory Board, G.R. No.
181293, February 23, 2015).

Examples of other cases where injunction/preliminary
injunction will not be issued
1. Under the Rule of Procedure in Environmental
Cases, “Except the Supreme Court, no court can issue a
TRO or writ of preliminary injunction against lawful actions
of government agencies that enforce environmental laws or
prevent violations thereof’ (Sec. 10, Rule 2, Part II, A.M. 09-68-SC).

2. No temporary or permanent injunction or restrain¬
ing order in any case involving or growing out of labor disputes
shall be issued by any court or other entity except as otherwise
provided in Arts. 218 and 264 of the Labor Code (San Miguel
Corporation v. NLRC, 403 SCRA 418, 425; Art. 254, Labor
Code of the Philippines). It is the NLRC which may grant
injunctive relief under Art. 218 of the Labor Code (Ravago
v. Esso Eastern Marine, Ltd., 453 SCRA 381, 394; See also
Lahim u. Mayor, Jr., 666 SCRA 1, February 15, 2012).

Thus, pursuant to Art. 218 of the Labor Code, Sec. 1 of
Rule X of the 2011 NLRC Rules of Procedure provides that a
preliminary injunction or restraining order may be granted
by the Commission (NLRC) through its divisions “when it is
established on the basis of the sworn allegations x x x that the
acts complained of involving or arising from any labor dispute

1
80

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

x x x if not restrained or performed forthwith, may cause grave
or irreparable damage to any party or render ineffectual any
decision in favor of such party.”
The prohibition against the issuance of injunction or
restraining order in any case growing out of a labor dispute
does not apply when the injunction is sought by a third person
whose property is sought to be levied upon, to satisfy the
liability of another person since the matter neither involves
nor grows out of a labor dispute insofar as the third party ig
concerned (Penalosa v. Villanueva, 177 SCRA 778, 786).
3. P.D. 605 bans the issuance by courts of preliminary
injunctions in cases involving concessions, licenses and other
permits issued by public administrative officials or bodies for
the exploitation of natural resources.
4. P.D. 1818 prohibits the issuance of temporary
restraining orders, preliminary injunctions, or preliminary
mandatory injunctions against the execution or implemen¬
tation of government infrastructure projects (Bangus Fry
Fisherfolk v. Lanzanos, 405 SCRA 530, 537; Circular No. 1393, Office of the Court Administrator, March 5, 1993; NPC v.
Vera, 170 SCRA 721, 724-725; PSBA-Quezon City v. TolentinoGenillo, 447 SCRA 442, 449) and essential government
projects, including arrastre and stevedoring operations
(Philippine Ports Authority v. Pier 8 Arrastre & Stevedoring
Services, Inc., 475 SCRA 426, 439).

5. A restraining order or a preliminary injunction may
not be issued by any court against the Presidential Agrarian
Reform Council (PARC) or any of its duly authorized agencies
in any case connected with the application, implementation or
enforcement of the CARP (Sec. 55, R.A. 6657, Comprehensive
Agrarian Reform Law).
6. An injunction cannot be issued against the Asset
Privatization Trust (Sec. 31-A, Proclamation 50-A; DBP v. CA,
302 SCRA 362, 377; Mantruste System v. CA, 179 SCRA 136,
144). Note: The functions of the Asset
Privatization Trust
have been taken over by the Privatization and Management
Office of the Department of Finance (E.O. 323, 2000).

——

PARTI PROVISIONAL REMEDIES

7. A court may not interfere by injunction with the
orders of another court of co-equal rank or decrees of a court
with concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction (Ching v. Court of
Appeals, 398 SCRA 88, 93).

The long-standing doctrine is that no court has the power
to interfere by injunction with the judgments or decrees of
a court of concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction. The various
trial courts of a province or city, having the same or equal
authority, should not, cannot, and are not permitted to
interfere with their respective cases, much less with their
orders or judgments. A contrary rule would obviously lead to
confusion and seriously hamper the administration of justice
(Heirs of Yadno v. Heirs of Anchales, G.R. No. 1 74582, October
11, 2012).
8. The Regional Trial Court may not issue injunction
against quasi-judicial bodies of equal rank such as the
Social Security Commission and Securities and Exchange
Commission (Philippine Pacific Fishing Co., Inc. v. Luna, 112
SCRA 604, 613).
9. The Regional Trial Court has no jurisdiction to issue
a writ of injunction against the execution of an award for
workmen’s compensation (Nocnoc v. Vera, 88 SCRA 529, 536).

10. Under Sec. 218 of R.A. 8424 or the Tax Reform Act
of 1997, injunction is not available to restrain the collection
of taxes. “No court shall have the authority to grant an
injunction to restrain the collection of any national internal
revenue tax, fee or charge imposed by this Code” (R.A.
8424, §218; Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Standard
Insurance Company, Inc., G.R. No. 219340, November 7, 2018).
Exception: When special circumstances warrant as when the
collection of taxes would cause irreparable injury (Sarasola v.
Trinidad, 40 Phil. 252, 257; For further readings, see David v.
Ramos, 90 Phil. 351).
11. Trial courts are enjoined from issuing orders
releasing imported articles impounded by the Bureau of
Customs. It is settled in jurisprudence that the Collector of

82

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Customs has exclusive jurisdiction over seizure and forfeiture
proceedings, and regular courts cannot interfere therewith or
stifle and put it to naught (Zuno u. Cabredo, 402 SCRA 75,
81).

12. An injunction cannot be issued against consummated
acts. The established principle is that when the events sought
to be prevented by injunction or prohibition have already
happened, nothing more could be enjoined or prohibited
(PNB v. Adi, 173 SCRA 550, 563) like against a judgment
that has already been executed for the purpose of stopping its
execution (Meneses v. Dinglasan, 81 Phil. 470, 476). Stated in
another way, a writ of preliminary injunction will not issue if
the act sought to be enjoined is already consummated or is a
fait accompli (David v. Navarro, 422 SCRA 490, 512; Spouses
Marquez v. Spouses Alindog, G.R. No. 184045, January 22,
2014).

13. An injunction cannot be issued to transfer possession
or control of a property to another when the legal title is still
in dispute between the parties and whose legal title has not
been clearly established (Almeida v. Court of Appeals, 448
SCRA 681, 704; Borbajo v. Hidden View Homeowners, Inc.,
450 SCRA 315, 327; Cortez-Estrada u. Heirs of Domingo
Samut/Antonia Samut, 451 SCRA 275, 292). A judge who
disregards this established doctrine is grossly ignorant of the
law (Medina v. Canoy, 663 SCRA 424, 432-433, February 22,
2012).
14. An injunction cannot be issued for the purpose of
establishing new relations between the parties (Almeida v.
Court of Appeals, supra).

15. A preliminary injunction cannot be issued where
there is a lack of a clear and unmistakable right on the part
of the applicant as when the complainant’s right is doubtful
or disputed. Granting the application
constitutes grave abuse
of discretion (Cortez-Estrada v. Heirs of
Domingo Samut/

Antonia Samut, 451 SCRA 275, 289-290).

——

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 68 Preliminary Injunction

83

16. Courts should also avoid issuing injunctions which,
in effect, would dispose of the main case without trial (LeviStrauss & Co. v. Clinton Apparelle, Inc., 470 SCRA 236, 257;
Philippine Ports Authority v. Pier 8 Arrastre & Stevedoring
Services, Inc., 475 SCRA 426, 441).

“x x x judges dealing with applications for the
injunctive relief ought to be wary of improvidently or
unwarrantedly issuing TROs or writs of injunction that
tend to dispose of the merits without or before trial.
Granting an application for the relief in disregard of that
tendency is judicially impermissible, for it is never the
function of a TRO or preliminary injunction to determine
the merits of a case, or to decide controverted facts. It is
but a preventive remedy whose only mission is to prevent
threatened wrong, further injury, and irreparable
harm or injustice until the rights of the parties can be
settled' (Nerwin Industries Corporation v. PNOC-Energy
Development Corporation, 669 SCRA 173, 188-189, April
11, 2012).

17. As a general rule, injunction, whether preliminary
or final, will not lie to restrain a criminal prosecution, except
in extreme cases like the following (Andres v. Cuevas, 460
SCRA 38, 51):
(a) to afford adequate protection to the constitu¬
tional rights of the accused;
(b) when necessary for the orderly administration
of justice or to avoid oppression or multiplicity of actions;
(c) when double jeopardy is clearly apparent;
(d) where the charges are manifestly false and
motivated by the lust for vengeance; or
(e) where there is clearly no prima facie case against
the accused and a motion to quash on that ground has
been denied (Roberts u. CA, 254 SCRA 307, 346; Brocka
v. Enrile, 192 SCRA 183, 188-189). (Bar 1999)

84

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

18. No temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary
injunction shall be issued against the extrajudicial foreclosure
of mortgage on the allegation that the loan has been paid or is
not delinquent unless the application is verified and supported
by evidence of payment. If the ground relied upon is that the
interest is unconscionable, no TRO or writ of preliminary
injunction shall be issued unless the debtor pays the mortgagee
at least 12% interest per annum on the principal obligation
as stated in the application for foreclosure sale, which shall
be updated monthly while the case is pending (A.M. No. 9910-05-0, Rules on Extrajudicial Foreclosure of Real Estate
Mortgage, effective March 10, 2007).
19. Under Sec. 25 of the New Central Bank Act (R.A.
7653), “No restraining order or injunction shall be issued by
the court enjoining the Bangko Sentral from examining any
institution subject to supervision or examination by the Bangko
Sentral, unless there is convincing proof that the action of the
Bangko Sentral is plainly arbitrary and made in bad faith and
the petitioner or plaintiff files with the clerk or judge of the
court in which the action is pending a bond executed in favor
of the Bangko Sentral, in an amount to be fixed by the court.
The provisions of Rule 58 of the New Rules of Court insofar as
they are applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions
of this section shall govern the issuance and dissolution of the
restraining order or injunction contemplated in this section.”
20. Under the Special ADR Rules, the arbitration
proceedings shall not be enjoined during the pendency of
the petition for judicial relief from the ruling of the arbitral
tribunal (Rule 3.18[B], Special ADR Rules).

21. Section 10 of R.A. 9160, as amended (The Anti¬
Money Laundering Act of 2001), provides that no court, except
the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court, shall issue a
temporary restraining order or writ of injunction against any
freeze order issued by the Anti-Money Laundering Council.
22. An inalienable public land cannot be appropriated
and thus, may not be the proper object of possession. Hence,
injunction cannot be issued in order to protect one’s alleged

right of possession over the same (Republic v. Cortez, G.R. No.
197472, September 7, 2015).
First paragraph of Sec. 14 of R.A. 6770 declared ineffective;
second paragraph declared unconstitutional

In Morales v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 217126-27,
November 10, 2015, a case involving the order of suspension
of a city mayor issued by the Office of the Ombudsman, one
issue presented to the Court for resolution was whether or not
the Court of Appeals gravely abused its discretion in issuing
a temporary restraining order and a writ of preliminary
injunction to prevent the implementation of the order of
suspension. The provision of Sec. 14 of R.A. 6770, commonly
known as the Ombudsman Law, was invoked to support the
theory which allegedly precludes the Court of Appeals from
issuing a TRO or an injunctive writ. It reads:

—

“Section 14. Restrictions.
No writ of injunction
shall be issued by any court to delay an investigation
being conducted by the Ombudsman under this Act,
unless there is a prima facie evidence that the subject
matter of the investigation is outside the jurisdiction of
the Office of the Ombudsman.

No court shall hear any appeal or application for
remedy against the decision or findings of the Ombudsman,
except the Supreme Court, on pure question of law.”

The Court in Morales found no grave abuse of discretion
on the part of the Court of Appeals in issuing the assailed
injunctive writs since its acts were accordingly based on
the then prevailing condonation doctrine invoked by the
city mayor. The first paragraph of Sec. 14 of R.A. 6770 was
declared ineffective by the Court pending its issuance of rules
of procedure on the subject.

In declaring the first paragraph “ineffective,” the Court,
in clear terms, ruled in Morales that, when Congress passed
the first paragraph of Sec. 14, R.A. 6770, it took away from
the courts their power to issue a temporary restraining order
or a writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin an investigation

CIVIL PROCEDURE

86

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

conducted by the Ombudsman. In so doing. Congress
encroached upon the Court’s constitutional rule-making
authority. Clearly, emphasized the Court, these issuances,
which are, by nature, provisional reliefs and auxiliary writs
created under the provisions of the Rules of Court, are matters

of procedure which belong exclusively within the province of
the Court. In addition, the Court pointed out that the breach of
Congress in prohibiting provisional injunctions, such as in the
first paragraph of Sec. 14, R.A. 6770, does not only undermine
the constitutional allocation of powers; it also practically
dilutes a court’s ability to carry out its functions.
As to the second paragraph of Sec. 14, the Court described
the same as inappropriate:
“Of course, the second paragraph of Section 14,
RA 6770's extremely limited restriction on remedies is
which is within
inappropriate since a Rule 45 appeal
by this
promulgated
procedure
the sphere of the rules of
orders

decisions

quasi-judicial
of
‘findings’
of lower courts, and not against
agencies. As will be later elaborated upon, x x x Congress
cannot interfere with matters of procedure; hence, it
cannot alter the scope of a Rule 45 appeal so as to apply
to interlocutory ‘findings’ issued by the Ombudsman.
More significantly, by confining the remedy to a Rule 45
appeal, the provision takes away the remedy of certiorari,
grounded on errors of jurisdiction, in denigration of the
judicial power constitutionally vested in courts. In this
light, the second paragraph of Section 14, RA 6770 also
increased this Court’s appellate jurisdiction, without a
showing, however, that it gave its consent to the same. The
provision is, in fact, very similar to the fourth paragraph
of Section 27, RA 6770 which was invalidated in the case
of Fabian v. Desierto." (See 138 Phil. 37; Cited in Morales
v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 217126-27, November 10,

the policy against the issuance of provisional injunctive
writs by courts other than the Supreme Court to enjoin an
investigation conducted by the Office of the Ombudsman
under the first paragraph of the said provision is declared
INEFFECTIVE until the Court adopts the same as part of
the rules of procedure through an administrative circular
duly issued therefor.”

Grounds for objection to an application for, or for motion of
dissolution of, injunction or restraining order
1. The application for injunction or restraining order
may be denied upon a showing of its insufficiency (Sec. 6,
Rule 58, Rules of Court). The application for injunction may
be considered insufficient if it is not verified and supported
by any of the grounds for its issuance under Sec. 3 of Rule
58, does not show facts entitling the applicant to the relief
demanded, or is not supported by the required bond under
Sec. 4 of Rule 58.
2. The injunction or restraining order may also be
denied, or, if granted, may be dissolved, on other grounds
upon affidavits of the party or person enjoined, which may be
opposed by the applicant also by affidavits (Sec. 6, Rule 58,
Rules of Court).

3. It may further be denied, or, if granted, may be
dissolved, if it appears after hearing that although the
applicant is entitled to the injunction or restraining order, the
issuance or continuance thereof, as the case may be, would
cause irreparable damage to the party or person enjoined while
the applicant can be fully compensated for such damages as
he may suffer. In this case, the person enjoined shall file a
bond in an amount fixed by the court conditioned that he will
pay all damages which the applicant may suffer by the denial
or the dissolution of the injunction or restraining order (Sec.
6, Rule 58, Rules of Court).

2015).

A part of the dispositive portion of Morales, reads:
(a) the second paragraph of Section 14 of Republic
Act No. 6770 is declared UNCONSTITUTIONAL, while

Effect of filing a counterbond

“The mere filing of a counterbond does not necessarily

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Under Sec. 6 of Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, a preliminary
injunction, if granted, may be dissolved if it appears
after hearing that although the plaintiff is entitled to the
injunction, the continuance thereof, as the case may be, would
cause great damage to the defendant while the plaintiff can
be fully compensated for such damages as he may suffer, and
the defendant files a bond in an amount fixed by the judge
conditioned that he will pay all damages which the plaintiff
may suffer by the x x x dissolution of the injunction.’ Under
this quoted provision of the rules of court, the court is called
upon to exercise its discretion in determining or weighing
the relative damages that may be suffered by the parties. If
the damages that may be suffered by the defendant by the
continuance of the injunction outweigh the damages that may
be suffered by the plaintiff by the dissolution of the injunction,
then the injunction should be dissolved, x x x An injunction
issued to stop an unauthorized act should not be dissolved by
the mere filing of a counterbond, otherwise, the counterbond
would become the vehicle of the commission or continuance
of an unauthorized or illegal act which the injunction
precisely is intended to prevent” (Director of the Bureau of

If it appears that the extent of the preliminary injunction
or restraining order granted is too great, it may be modified
(Sec. 6, Rule 58, Rules of Court).
Grave abuse of discretion as a ground for nullifying an
injunctive writ

Indeed, the rule is well-entrenched that for grave abuse
of discretion to exist as a valid ground for the nullification
of an injunctive writ, there must be a capricious and
whimsical exercise of judgment, equivalent to lack or excess
of jurisdiction. The power must be exercised in an arbitrary
manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and it must
be patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive

duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law
(Sps. Castro v. Sps. De la Cruz, 639 SCRA 187, 191).

Duty of the court that issued the writ

Added to the last paragraph of Sec. 5 of Rule 58 is the
proviso that: “The trial court, the Court of Appeals, the
Sandiganbayan or the Court of Tax Appeals that issued the
writ of preliminary injunction against a lower court, board,
officer, or quasi-judicial agency shall decide the main case or
petition within six (6) months from the issuance of the writ”
(A.M. 07-7-12-SC, Effective December 27, 2007).
Grant of final Injunction

A final injunction shall be granted by the court with
the effect of permanently restraining a party or person
enjoined from committing or continuing the acts subject of
the injunction. The court may also confirm the preliminary
mandatory injunction already issued. These, the court will do
if, after the trial of the action, it appears that the applicant
is entitled to have the act or acts complained of permanently
enjoined (Sec. 9, Rule 58, Rules of Court). The injunction in
this case is no longer preliminary.

Rule 59
RECEIVERSHIP
Nature of a receivership
1. Receivership, like injunction, may also be a principal
action as the one referred to in Sec. 4 of Rule 39. However,
Rule 59 involves only a receivership that is ancillary to a main
action.
2. Being a mere provisional remedy, the receivership
in Rule 59 presupposes that there is a principal action or
proceeding and that the property or fund subject of such action
or proceeding requires its preservation. The receivership
provided in Rule 59 covers various situations which require
that the appointment of a receiver is the most convenient
and feasible means of preserving, administering, or disposing
of the property in litigation (See Sec. Ifd], Rule 59, Rules of
Court).
Receivership is aimed at the preservation of, and at
making more secure, existing rights. It cannot be used as an
instrument for the destruction of those rights (Arranza v. B.F.
Homes, Inc., 333 SCRA 799, 815).

Examples of cases that justify the appointment of a receiver
1. There is an action or proceeding and the subject of
the same is property or fund, and that such property or fund is
in danger of being lost, removed or materially injured unless a
receiver be appointed to administer and preserve it (Sec. l[a],
Rule 59, Rules of Court).

A receiver of real or personal property, which is the
subject of the action, may be appointed by the court when it

appears from the pleadings or such other proof, as the judge
may require, that the party applying for such appointment
has: (1) an actual interest in it; and (2) that (a) such property
is in danger of being lost, removed or materially injured;
or (b) whenever it appears to be the most convenient and
feasible means of preserving or administering the property
in litigation (Commodities Storage & Ice Plant Corporation v.
Court of Appeals, 274 SCRA 439, 445; Sec. l[a], Rule 59, Rules
of Court).
2. There is an action for foreclosure of mortgage filed
by the mortgagee and it appears that the property mortgaged
is in danger of being dissipated or materially injured, and that
its value is probably insufficient to discharge the mortgage
debt, or that the parties have so stipulated in the contract of
mortgage (Sec. Ifb], Rule 59, Rules of Court). (Bar 2001)

In an action to foreclose a mortgage when the property is
in danger of being wasted or dissipated or materially injured
and that its value is in danger of not being able to cover
the mortgage debt, the mortgagee may ask for a receiver to
preserve the property. If the judgment obligor refuses to apply
his property to the satisfaction of the judgment, receivership
may be availed of (For related readings, see Philippine Trust
Company v. Santamaria, 53 Phil. 463, 467-468).
3. There is already a judgment and receivership is
applied for to aid execution because: (a) the execution has been
returned unsatisfied, (b) the judgment obligor refuses to apply
his property in satisfaction of the judgment, or otherwise to
carry the judgment into effect (Sec. Ifc], Rule 59, Rules of
Court). (Bar 2011)

Under Sec. 41 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, the court
may appoint a receiver of the property of the judgment obligor,
forbid a transfer or other disposition of his property, forbid
any interference with his property not exempt from execution.
4.

There is a pending appeal but a receiver is necessary

to preserve the property during its pendency (Sec. l[c], Rule
59, Rules of Court).

his functions in the interest of neither plaintiff nor defendant,
but for the common benefit of all the parties in interest. He
performs his duties “subject to the control of the Court,” and
every question involved in the receivership may be determined
by the court taking cognizance of the receivership proceedings
(Pacific Merchandising Corporation v. Consolation Insurance
& Surety Co., 73 SCRA 564, 569-570).

During the pendency of an appeal, the appellate court
may allow an application for the appointment of a receiver
to be filed with and decided by the court of origin and the
receiver appointed to be subject to the control of said court
(Sec. 1, last paragraph, Rule 59, Rules of Court).

5. In other cases, the appointment of a receiver is
justified when it is the most convenient and feasible means of
preserving, administering, or disposing of the property under
litigation (Sec. IfdJ, Rule 59, Rules of Court). There must be a
clear showing of necessity for the appointment of a receiver in
order to save the plaintiff from grave and irremediable loss or
damage. It is only when the circumstances so demand, either
because there is imminent danger that the property sought
to be placed in the hands of a receiver be lost or because they
run the risk of being impaired, endeavoring to avoid that the
injury thereby caused be greater than the one sought to be
avoided (Commodities Storage & Ice Plant Corporation v.
Court of Appeals, 274 SCRA 439). Hence, receivership is not
available in a mere suit for collection of a sum of money for the
purpose of assuring the collection of the debt. It is available
when the property or fund, that is the subject of the litigation,
is in danger of being lost, removed or materially injured. (Bar
1995)

Appointment of a party or clerk of court as a receiver
1. The general rule is that neither party to a litigation
should be appointed as a receiver without the consent of the
other because a receiver should be a person indifferent to the
parties and should be impartial and disinterested. A receiver
is not a representative of any of the parties but of all of them
to the end that their interests may be equally protected with
the least possible inconvenience and expense (Com modities
Storage & Ice Plant Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 274
SCRA 439, 448). (Bar 2010)
2. In an early case, Abrigo u. Kayanan, 121 SCRA 20,
25-26, the Court considered the respondent judge as having
committed grave abuse of discretion for having appointed
his clerk of court as receiver without requiring him to post a
bond. The appointment was made by the judge pursuant to
his assumption that, being a public officer, the clerk of court
“is expected to faithfully discharge the duties of a receiver in
these actions and obey the orders of the Court accordingly.”
The Court, in nullifying the appointment, observed that, “The
reason for the appointment of the receiver was the fact that the
land had been entered by numerous squatters. But a receiver
who is also burdened with his duties as Clerk of Court cannot
be in a better position than the actual possessors in dealing
with the squatters.”

Meaning of a receiver
1. A receivership involves the appointment of a receiv¬

depends upon the sound discretion of the court and is based on
facts and circumstances of each particular case” (Commodi¬

Receivership after judgment

—

95

Kinds of bonds; two bonds
1. There are two main types of bonds required, namely:
(a) The bond required before the appointment of a
receiver (Sec. 2, Rule 59, Rules of Court) and
(b) The bond required of a receiver before entering
upon his duties (Sec. 4, Rule 59, Rules of Court)

Receivership may be availed of, not only during the
pendency of the action. It may be availed of even after the
judgment to preserve the property during the pendency of
an appeal, to dispose of it according to the judgment, to aid
execution, or to carry the judgment into effect (See Sec. Ifc],
Rule 39, Rules of Court).

2. Section 2 of Rule 59 is very clear in that before
issuing the order appointing a receiver the court shall require
the applicant to file a bond executed to the party against
whom the application is presented. The use of the word “shall”
denotes its mandatory nature; thus, the consent of the other
party, or as in this case, the consent of petitioners, is of no
moment. Hence, the filing of an applicant’s bond is required at
all times. On the other hand, the requirement of a receiver’s
bond rests upon the discretion of the court. Section 2 of Rule
59 clearly states that the court may, in its discretion, at any
time after the appointment, require an additional bond as
further security for such damages (Tantano, et al. v. EspinaCaboverde, et al., G.R. No. 203585, July 29, 2013).

Requisites for the appointment of a receiver
1. A verified application must be filed by the party
applying for the appointment of a receiver (Sec. Ifa], Rule 59,
Rules of Court/,
2. The applicant must have an interest in the property
or funds subject of the action (Sec. Ifa], Rule 59, Rules of
Court); he must show that the property or fund is in danger of
being lost, removed, materially altered, wasted or dissipated
(Sec. Ifa], [b], Rule 59, Rules of Court) or there is a need to
preserve or administer the property, or that all the grounds
justifying the appointment of a receiver exist;

3. The application must be with notice and set for
hearing. A hearing is necessary because the grounds for a
receivership require the resolution of factual issues;

4. Before issuing the appointment of a receiver, the
court shall require the applicant to post a bond executed to the
party against whom the application is presented. The amount
of the bond shall be fixed by the court. It is posted to the
effect that the applicant will pay such party all damages he
may sustain by reason of the appointment of a receiver. The
amount of the bond initially fixed by the court is not the final
amount. At any time after the appointment of a receiver, the
court may require additional bond as security for the payment
of damages (Sec. 2, Rule 59, Rules of Court); and
5. Before entering upon his duties, the receiver must
be sworn to perform his duties faithfully and shall also file a
bond. This bond is to the effect that he will faithfully discharge
his duties in the action or proceeding and obey the orders of
the court (Sec. 4, Rule 59, Rules of Court).

Opposing the application for the appointment of a receiver

1. The party against whom the application for an

successful opposition, such party should file a bond executed
to the applicant, in an amount to be fixed by the court, to the
effect that such party will pay the applicant all damages he
may suffer by reason of the acts, omissions, or other matters
specified in the application as ground for such appointment

consequence, the receiver is subject to the control and

Note: A bank which has been ordered closed by the
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is placed under the
receivership of the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation
(PDIC). As a consequence of the receivership, the closed bank
may sue and be sued only through its receiver, the Philippine
Deposit Insurance Corporation. Any action filed by the closed
bank without its receiver may be dismissed.
Considering that the receiver has the power to take
charge of all the assets of the closed bank and to institute
for or defend any action against it, only the receiver, in its
fiduciary capacity, may sue and be sued on behalf of the closed
bank (Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank v. BSP and
Monetary Bank, G.R. No. 200678, June 4, 2018).

Investment of funds by receiver (Bar 2011)
1. A receiver may not invest funds in his custody
without an order from the court and without the written
consent of all the parties to the action (Sec. 6, Rule 59, Rules
of Court).

No action may be filed against a receiver without leave
of the court which appointed him (Sec. 6, Rule 59, Rules of
Court). Any action filed against a receiver without the requisite
judicial authority may be dismissed. The 2019 Amendments
to the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure now prohibits motion to
dismiss based on the ground that a condition precedent for
filing the claim has not been complied with. Such shall be
raised as an affirmative defense in the answer. Failure to raise
the ground of failure to comply with a condition precedent at
the earliest opportunity shall constitute a waiver thereof.
The court shall motu proprio resolve the affirmative defense
within 30 calendar days from the filing of the answer (Sec. 12,
Rule 8, Rules of Court, as amended).

A person who refuses or neglects, upon reasonable

1.

The Court described, thus:

“Replevin, broadly understood, is both a form of
principal remedy and of a provisional relief. It may refer
either to the action itself, i.e., to regain the possession
of personal chattels being wrongfully detained from the
plaintiff by another, or to the provisional remedy that
would allow the plaintiff to retain the thing during the
pendency of the action and hold it pendente lite. The
action is primarily possessory in nature and generally
determines nothing more than the right of possession”
(BA Finance Corporation u. Court of Appeals, 258 SCRA
102).

As the above pronouncements clearly explain, replevin
may be a main action or a provisional remedy. As a principal
action, its ultimate goal is to recover personal property capable
of manual delivery wrongfully detained by a person. Used in
this sense, it is a suit in itself.
2. The application of Rule 60 presupposes the existence
of a principal action which prays for the recovery of possession
of personal property. The party seeking to recover such
possession may “apply for an order for the delivery of such
property to him” even before judgment is rendered in the
principal action. When the party applies for the delivery of the
property subject of the action during its pendency, the party is
actually availing of the provisional remedy of replevin.
3. The main action for replevin is primarily possessory
in essence because it seeks a determination of the right of
possession of personal property.

For instance, if the plaintiff claims that the defendant is
in possession of his car without lawful cause, he may file an
action for replevin. While the action is pending, the plaintiff
may ask the court to allow him to have possession of the car
in the meantime that the main action is not yet resolved. He
may justify his application, for instance, by showing that he
uses the same in pursuit of his occupation and the continued
possession of the car by the defendant deprives him of a vital
source of income. The plaintiff may then apply for the issuance
of a writ of replevin as a provisional remedy. The remedy
availed of in seeking possession of the property prior to the
final determination of the action is the provisional remedy of
replevin and not the main action for replevin.
4. Also, when the debtor defaults in his obligation and
the creditor decides to foreclose the chattel mortgage, but the
debtor refuses to yield possession of the personal property
subject of the mortgage, the creditor may obtain a writ of
replevin as a preliminary step for the foreclosure.
Thus, it was held that a foreclosure under a chattel
mortgage may properly be commenced once there is default
on the part of the mortgagor of his obligation secured by the
mortgage. The replevin, in the instant case, has been sought
to pave the way for the foreclosure of the object covered by
the chattel mortgage (BA Finance Corporation v. Court of
Appeals, 258 SCRA 102).

5.

Replevin as a provisional remedy may also be availed
of under the following facts given in a bar examinations. “A
sold five thousand piculs of sugar to B, payable on demand.
Upon delivery of the sugar to B, however, the latter did not
pay its purchase price. After the lapse of some time from the
date of delivery of the sugar to B, A brought an action for the
rescission of the contract of sale and, as incident of this action,
asked for the manual delivery (replevin) of the sugar to him.”
(Bar 1996)

Replevin distinguished from preliminary attachment
1. The purpose of replevin is to recover personal
property capable of manual delivery from the adverse party.

I

101

The purpose of preliminary attachment is not to actually
recover any property but simply to place the property under
the custody of the court to secure the satisfaction of the
judgment that may be rendered in favor of the applicant at
some future time.
2. In replevin, the personal property belongs either
to the plaintiff or one over which the plaintiff has a right of
possession. In attachment, the property does not belong to the
plaintiff but to the defendant.

3. Replevin can be availed of only when the defendant
is in actual or constructive possession of the personal property.
Attachment can be availed of even if the property is in the
custody of third persons.
4. Replevin extends only to personal property capable of
manual delivery. Attachment extends to all kinds of property,
real or personal or even incorporeal property.

5. Replevin may be availed of without showing that the
property is being concealed or disposed of to the prejudice of
the applicant. To avail of a writ of preliminary attachment, the
applicant, in certain cases, needs to show that the property is
-being removed, concealed or disposed of.

6. Property already under custodia legis cannot be the
object of replevin. Preliminary attachment can be availed of
even if the property is in custodia legis.

7. The bond in replevin is double the value of the
property as stated in the affidavit submitted in support of
the application. In preliminary attachment, the bond is equal
to that fixed by the court which is the amount sufficient to
satisfy the applicant’s demand or the value of the property to

be attached.

Note: In injunction, the bond is the amount fixed by the
court, unless the court exempts the applicant from posting a
bond. In receivership, the bond is also fixed by the court.

When a writ of replevin may be applied for
The writ may be applied for at (a) the commencement
of the action, or (b) any time before answer (Sec. 1, Rule 60,
Rules of Court).

Procedure for the application for replevin; affidavit and bond
1. A party praying for the provisional remedy of
replevin must file an application for a writ of replevin. His
application must be filed at the commencement of the action
or at any time before the adverse party answers (Sec. 1, Rule
60, Rules of Court).
2. The application must show the following, by an
affidavit executed by the: (a) applicant, or (b) of some other
person who personally knows the facts:
(a) The applicant is the owner of the property
claimed. If he is not the owner then he must state that he
is entitled to the possession of the property. The affidavit
shall also describe the property. (Bar 2011)
Note: The applicant need not be the owner of the
property. It is enough that he has a right to its possession
(Yang v. Valdez, 177 SCRA 141, 147; BA Finance
Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 258 SCRA 102; Siy v.
Tomlin, G.R. No. 205998, April 24, 2017).
(b) The property is wrongfully detained by the
adverse party. The affidavit shall also allege the cause
of detention according to the best of his knowledge,

3. The applicant must give a bond, called a replevin
bond, executed to the adverse party in double the value of the
property as stated in the affidavit. The bond is for the return
of the property to the adverse party if such return be ordered
by the court, and for the payment to the adverse party of such
sum that may be recovered from the applicant in the action
(See Sec. 2, Rule 60, Rules of Court). (Bar 2010)

Of all the provisional remedies provided in the Rules
of Court, only Rule 60, Sec. 2 requires that the amount of
the bond be double the value of the property. The rationale
behind this requirement is that the bond functions not only to
indemnify the defendant in case the property is lost, but also
to answer for any damages that may be awarded by the court
if the judgment is rendered in defendant’s favor.
Any application of the bond in a replevin case, therefore, is
premised on the judgment rendered in favor of the defendant.
Thus, Secs. 9 and 10, Rule 60 of the Rules of Court imply that
there must be a prior judgment on the merits before there can
be any application on the bond. Section 20, Rule 57, as applied
suppletorily to Rule 60 of the Rules of Court, likewise requires
that for the defendant to be granted the full amount of the
bond, he or she must first apply to the court for damages.
These damages will be awarded only after a proper hearing.
Forfeiture of the replevin bond, therefore, requires first, a
judgment on the merits in the defendant’s favor, and second,
an application by the defendant for damages (Enriquez u. The
Mercantile Insurance Co., Inc., G.R. No. 210950, August 15,
2018).

information and belief.

Property in custodia legis

(c) The property has not been distrained or taken
for a tax assessment or a fine pursuant to law, or seized
under a writ of execution or preliminary attachment, or
otherwise placed under custodia legis. If it is so seized,
it must be alleged that it is exempt from such seizure or
custody. (Bar 2010, 2011)

1. Replevin is not available when the property is under
custodia legis, under attachment or seized pursuant to law
(Pagkalinawan v. Gomez, 21 SCRA 1275, 1279-1280). The
reason posited for this principle is that if it were otherwise,
there would be interference with the possession before the
function of the law had been performed as to the process under
which the property was taken (Chua u. Court of Appeals, 222
SCRA 85).

(d) The actual market value of the property is to be

stated.

104

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Note: Contrast this principle with the rule that a property
under custodia legis may be attached (Sec. 7, last paragraph,
Rule 57, Rules of Court).
2. “x x x Property subject of litigation is not by that
fact alone in custodia legis. x x x A thing is in custodia legis
when it is shown that it has been and is subjected to the
official custody of a judicial executive officer in pursuance of
his execution of a legal writ. Only when property is lawfully
taken by virtue of legal process is it considered in the custody
of the law, and not otherwise” (Bagalihug v. Fernandez, 198
SCRA 614, 621).
3. Also, where personal property is seized under a
search warrant and there is reason to believe that the seizure
will not anymore be followed by the filing of a criminal case,
the proper remedy is the filing of an action for replevin, and
if there are conflicting claims over the seized property, an
interpleader may be filed with the proper court, not necessarily
the same one which issued the search warrant. Where there is
still a probability that the seizure will be followed by the filing
of a criminal action or the criminal information has actually
been commenced, or filed, and actually prosecuted, and there
are conflicting claims over the property seized, the proper
remedy is to question the validity of the search warrant in the
same court which issued it and not in any other branch of the
said court (Chua v. Court of Appeals, 222 SCRA 85, 91).
4. “Regional Trial Courts are devoid of any competence
to pass upon the validity or regularity of seizure and

and to enjoin or otherwise interfere with these proceedings.
It is the Collector of Customs, sitting in seizure and forfeiture

prevent smuggling and other frauds upon Customs, but more
importantly, to render effective and efficient the collection of
import and export duties due the State, which enables the
government to carry out the functions it has been instituted
to perform.

Thus, the RTC had no jurisdiction to take cognizance
of the petition for replevin by respondents herein, issue the
writ of replevin and order its enforcement. The Collector of
Customs had already seized the vehicles and set the sale
thereof at public auction. The RTC should have dismissed
the petition for replevin at the outset. By granting the plea of
respondents (plaintiffs below) for the seizure of the vehicles
and the transfer of custody to the court, the RTC acted without
jurisdiction over the action and the vehicles subject matter
thereof’ (Asian Terminals, Inc. v. Bautista, 505 SCRA 748,
761, 762).
Undertaking of the replevin bond

1. The bond is for the: (a) return of the property to the
adverse party if such return be adjudged, and (b) payment
to the adverse party of such sum as he may recover from the
applicant in the action (Sec. 2, Rule 60, Rules of Court).
2. Where the court awards damages based on Arts. 19
and 20 of the Civil Code and not on the deprivation of personal
properties subject of the replevin bond, recourse on the bond
for the payment of such damages is not proper.

It was ruled: “A replevin bond is simply intended to
indemnify the defendant against any loss that he may suffer
by being compelled to surrender the possession of the disputed
property pending the trial of the action, x x x Nor is the surety
liable for payment of the judgment for damages rendered
against the plaintiff on a counterclaim or punitive damages
for fraudulent or wrongful acts committed by the plaintiffs and
unconnected with the defendant’s deprivation of possession by
the plaintiff. Indeed, even where the judgment was that the
defendant was entitled to the property, but no order was made

requiring the plaintiff to return it or assessing damages in
default of a return, it was declared that until judgment was
entered that the property should be restored, there could be
no liability on the part of the sureties” (Sapugay v. Court of
Appeals, 183 SCRA 464, 472; Underscoring supplied).

(Sec. 6, Rule 60, Rules of Court) upon receiving his fees and
necessary expenses for taking and keeping the same (Sec.
4, Rule 60, Rules of Court). Where the adverse party did not
object to the other party’s bond nor posted a redelivery bond to
recover the possession of the property taken under the writ of
replevin, the sheriff is under obligation to deliver the property
to the applicant (Adoma v. Gatcheco, 448 SCRA 299, 304). If
for any reason, the property is not delivered to the applicant,
the sheriff must return it to the adverse party (Sec. 6, Rule 60,
Rules of Court).

Order of the court and writ of replevin; when issued

The court shall issue: (a) an order, and (b) the
corresponding writ of replevin upon the filing of the affidavit
and the approval of the bond. The writ shall: (a) describe the
personal property alleged to be wrongfully detained, and (b)
require the sheriff to take such property into his custody (Sec.
3, Rule 60, Rules of Court).

How adverse party may seek the return of the property;
redelivery bond

1. At any time before the delivery of the property to the
applicant, the adverse party may require the return thereof.
The adverse party may object to the sufficiency of the bond
or of the sureties thereon. This is to be done by filing with
the court where the action is pending a bond (redelivery
bond) executed to the applicant, in double the value of the
property as stated in the applicant’s affidavit for the delivery
thereof to the applicant, if such delivery be adjudged, and for
the payment of such sum to him as may be recovered against
the adverse party. A copy of the bond posted by the adverse
party shall be served on the applicant (Sec. 5, Rule 60, Rules
of Court).

Duty of sheriff in the implementation of the writ

Upon the receipt of the court order, the sheriff must:
(a) serve a copy of the order on the adverse party, together
with a copy of the application, affidavit and bond; and (b) take
custody of the property (Sec. 4, Rule 60, Rules of Court).
1.

If the property or any part thereof is concealed in a
building or enclosure, the sheriff is mandated to demand its
delivery. If it is not delivered despite demand, the sheriff is
authorized by the Rules to cause the building or enclosure to
be broken open and take the property into his possession (Sec.
4, Rule 60, Rules of Court).
2. After the sheriff has taken custody of the property,
he must keep it in a secure place (Sec. 4, Rule 60, Rules of

within 5 days from the taking of the property by the

Rules of Court).
Effect of dismissal of the complaint

In Advent Capital Corporation v. Young, 655 SCRA 118,
126-127, August 3, 2011, the action for replevin filed by the
plaintiff, Advent, was dismissed by the trial court without
prejudice, because of the failure of the plaintiff to prosecute.
Should the car earlier surrendered by the defendant, Young,
under a writ of seizure issued by the court be returned to him?
The Court answered the question in the affirmative
it being the necessary consequence of the dismissal of the
replevin case.
The Court explained:
“x x x Upon the dismissal of the replevin case for
failure to prosecute, the writ of seizure, which is merely
ancillary in nature, became functus officio and should
have been lifted. There was no adjudication on the merits,
which means that there was no determination of the
issue who has the better right to possess the subject car.
Advent cannot, therefore, retain possession of the subject
car considering that it was not adjudged as the prevailing
party entitled to the remedy of replevin.
XXX

xxx The dismissal of the replevin case for failure to
prosecute results in the restoration of the parties’ status
prior to litigation, as if no complaint was filed at all. To
let the writ of seizure stand after the dismissal of the
complaint would be adjudging Advent as the prevailing
party, when precisely no decision on the merits had been
rendered. Accordingly, the parties must be reverted to
their status quo ante. Since Young possessed the subject
car before the filing of the replevin case, the same must be
returned to him, as if no complaint was filed at all.”

109

When property is claimed by a third party
1. A person who claims the property taken under a writ
of replevin may protect his rights by executing an affidavit of
his title, or right to the possession of the property and the
grounds therefor. He then serves the affidavit upon the sheriff
while the latter has possession of the property. A copy of the
affidavit shall also be served upon the applicant (Sec. 7, Rule
60, Rules of Court).
2. The sheriff who receives the affidavit of the thirdparty claimant shall no longer be bound to keep the property
under replevin or be obligated to deliver it to the applicant.
However, the affidavit may be defeated by a bond which the
applicant may post on demand of the sheriff. The applicant
may file a bond approved by the court to indemnify the thirdparty claimant in a sum not less than the value of the property
under replevin. When the bond is filed, the sheriff shall not be
liable for damages, for the taking or keeping of such property,
to any such third-party claimant. No claim for damages for
the taking or keeping of the property may be enforced against
the bond unless the action therefor is filed within 120 days
from the date of the filing of the bond (Sec. 7, Rule 60, Rules of
Court).

3. The party-claimant, however, is not precluded from
vindicating his claim to the property. He may even maintain a
separate action and seek injunctive relief against the sheriff.
The applicant is likewise not precluded by the Rules from
claiming damages against a third-party claimant who filed a
frivolous or plainly spurious claim, in the same or a separate
action (Sec. 7, Rule 60, Rules of Court).

Judgment

The judgment in a replevin suit is in the alternative, i.e.,
to deliver the property to the party entitled to the same or to
pay its value in case delivery cannot be made (Sec. 9, Rule 60,
Rules of Court). If the property is no longer in the condition in
which it should be, the party entitled to its delivery may refuse
to accept the property. He may then ask for the alternative

110

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

remedy which is the payment of its value even if he had
previously sought its delivery during the pendency of the case.

Thus, it was held that “x x x [W]here judgment is rendered
for the articles or their value and they cannot be returned
in substantially the same condition, it is settled that the
prevailing party may refuse to take them and instead sue on
the redelivery bond or, x x x execute on the judgment for value
(Kunz v. Nelson, 76 P2d 577 [1938]). If the prevailing party
has this right after judgment, it is at once obvious that he
must also have the same right when, asking for the delivery
pendente lite of the same property, he afterwards finds them
in a substantially depredated condition” (Ago v. Court of
Appeals, 16 SCRA 81, 85).

Rule 61
SUPPORT PENDENTE LITE
Nature of support pendente lite
1. Support pendente lite is a proceeding where the
amount of support is provisionally fixed by the court in favor
of the person or persons entitled thereto during the pendency
of an action for support or any applicable principal action.
In its frequent application, the main action is usually for
support and support pendente lite is the provisional remedy.
But the main action for support is not the only basis for
seeking support pendente lite. Article 198 of the Family Code
declares that, “During the proceedings for legal separation
or annulment of marriage, and for declaration of nullity of
marriage, the spouses and their children shall be supported
from the properties of the absolute community or the conjugal
partnership.” This provision not only identifies the source of
the support but also impliedly authorizes support pendente
lite. Article 203 of the Family Code likewise provides that
“Support pendente lite may be claimed in accordance with the
Rules of Court.”
Under Sec. 1 of the Rules on Provisional Orders (A.M. 0211-12-SC) in family cases, upon receipt of a verified petition
for declaration of absolute nullity of void marriage or for
annulment of voidable marriage, or for legal separation, and
at any time during the proceeding, the court, motu proprio or
upon application under oath of any of the parties, guardian
or designated custodian, may issue provisional orders and
protection orders with or without a hearing. These orders
may be enforced immediately, with or without a bond, and for
such period and under such terms and conditions as the court

m

112

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

PART I PROVISIONAL REMEDIES
Rule 61 Support Pendente Lite

may deem necessary. The provisional orders include spousal
support in Sec. 2 of the Rules and child support under Sec. 3
of the same Rules.

The application shall be accompanied by affidavits,
depositions or other authentic documents in support thereof
(Sec. 1, Rule 61, Rules of Court).

2. Orders on the matter of support pendente lite are but
an incident to the main action. Provisional remedies are writs
and processes available during the pendency of the action
which may be resorted to by a litigant to preserve and protect
certain rights and interests therein pending rendition, and for
purposes of the ultimate effects, of a final judgment in the
case. They are provisional because they constitute temporary
measures availed of during the pendency of the action, and
they are ancillary because they are mere incidents in and are
dependent upon the result of the main action (Calderon v.
Roxas, et al., G.R. No. 185595, January 9, 2013).

It has been ruled that if the right to support is put in
issue in the pleadings or the fact from which the right to
support arises has not been established, the court cannot
grant support pendente lite (Francisco v. Zandueta, 61 Phil.
752, 757).

3. Support pendente lite was made available, in one
case, in a petition for habeas corpus filed by the mother against
the father. Here, the father has recognized the child as his
and the temporary support was granted pending the fixing of
the amount of support in another action for support (David v.
CA, 250 SCRA 82, 87-88).

Who may ask for support pendente lite
By express provision of Sec. 1 of Rule 61, it may be applied
for by any party, not only the plaintiff, as long as there are
legal grounds to support such application.

When to apply for support pendente lite

Support pendente lite may be applied for at the
commencement of the proper action or proceeding, or at any
time prior to the judgment or final order (Sec. 1, Rule 61,
Rules of Court).

Procedure for application for support “pendente lite"
1. A verified application shall be filed. The verified
application shall state the: (a) grounds for the claim, and (b)
financial conditions of both parties (Sec. 1, Rule 61, Rules of
Court).

2. The adverse party shall be asked to comment on the
application within 5 days from service upon him of a copy of
the application and supporting documents to it. This comment
shall be verified and accompanied by affidavits, depositions or
other authentic documents in support thereof (Sec. 2, Rule 61,
Rules of Court).
3. After the comment is filed, or after the expiration of
the time for its filing, the application shall be set for hearing
not more than 3 days thereafter. The facts in issue in the
hearing shall be proved in the same manner as is provided for
evidence on motions (Sec. 3, Rule 61, Rules of Court).

Note: Support pendente lite cannot be granted ex parte.
The rule requires a hearing. (Bar 1981)
4. If the application is granted, the court shall fix
the amount of money to be provisionally paid or such other
forms of support as should be provided, taking into account
the necessities of the applicant and the resources or means
of the adverse party, and the terms of payment or mode for
providing the support (Sec. 4, Rule 61, Rules of Court). The
rule recognizes that the giving of money is not the only mode of
support. Hence, the use of the terms “other forms of support.”

If the application is denied, the principal case shall be
tried and decided as early as possible (Sec. 4, Rule 61, Rules
of Court).
The amount fixed in the order is only provisional. It is
not final in character and can be modified depending on the
changing conditions affecting the ability of the obligor to pay

114

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

the amount fixed for support (San Juan v. Valenzuela, 117
SCRA 926, 928).
Support pendente lite In criminal cases

1. In criminal cases, the accused may be ordered to
provide support pendente lite to the child born to the offended
party allegedly because of the crime. The remedy may be
availed of where the civil liability includes support for the
offspring born to the offended party as a consequence of the
crime provided the civil aspect thereof has not been waived,
reserved or instituted prior to its fifing. The application for
support pendente lite may be made during the pendency of
the criminal case (Sec. 6, Rule 61, Rules of Court). A previous
finding of guilt is not required. (Bar 1999) When the judgment
finds that the person giving support is not liable therefor, the
court shall order the recipient to make a restitution of what
has been received with legal interest from the date of actual
payment (See Sec. 7, Rule 61, Rules of Court).
2. The application for support pendente lite may be filed
successively by the offended party, her parents, grandparents
or guardian and the State during the pendency of the criminal
case (Sec. 6, Rule 61, Rules of Court). Such application may
be granted in rape cases for the offspring of the accused as a
consequence of the rape or seduction. (Bar 1999, 2001)

Enforcement of the order
1. The adverse party has to comply with the order to
give support pendente lite. If he does not, an order of execution
shall be issued by the court against him either motu proprio or
upon motion. He may likewise be held liable for contempt (Sec.
5, Rule 61, Rules of Court).

2. Note that, while an order for support pendente lite is
merely interlocutory and not a final order, the order is subject
to the issuance of an order of execution when the person
ordered to give support refuses or fails to do so (Sec. 5, Rule

61, Rules of Court).

—

Rule 61 Support Pendente Lite

115

3. Even a third person may obtain a writ of execution
against the person ordered to give support provided: (a) there
is due notice and hearing in the same case, and (b) that such
third person furnished the support to the applicant because
of the refusal or failure to do so by the person ordered to give
support (Sec. 5, Rule 61, Rules of Court).

Restitution
When the judgment finds that the person giving support
is not liable therefor, the court shall order the recipient to
make a restitution of what has been received with legal
interest from the date of actual payment. Should the recipient
fail to do so, the person who gave the support may file an
action against the person legally obliged to give such support
(Sec. 7, Rule 61, Rules of Court).

Provisional remedies (Interim reliefs) available to the peti¬
tioner in a petition for a writ of amparo (Bar 2012)

These interim reliefs are in the nature of provisional
remedies that apply specifically to the petition for a writ of
amparo.
1.

2. The interim reliefs provided for under Sec. 14 of the
Rule on the Writ of Amparo are the following:

—

(a) Temporary Protection Order (TPO) The filing
of the petition may possibly put the lives and safety of
the petitioner and the immediate members of his family
at risk. Hence, the court, justice or judge, upon motion
or motu proprio, may order that the petitioner or the
aggrieved party and any member of his immediate family
be protected by a government agency or by an accredited
person or private institution capable of keeping and
securing their safety (Sec. 14[a], Rule on the Writ of
Amparo). (Bar 2012)

Some persons may refuse to be protected by a
government agency and would prefer to be under the
protection of private persons or private institutions. To
ensure the capability of private persons or entities to
give temporary protection to the person who needs such
protection, they must be accredited by the Supreme

Court.

—

(b) Witness Protection Order (WPO) The court,
justice or judge, upon motion or motu proprio, may issue
a witness protection order for a witness to be admitted to
the Witness Protection, Security and Benefit Program,

also refer witnesses to other government agencies, or to
accredited persons or institutions if the witness cannot
be accommodated by the Department of Justice or the
witness refuses the protection of the Department of
Justice (Sec. 14[d], Rule on the Writ of Amparo). (Bar
2012)

The court, justice or
(c) Inspection Order (IO)
judge, upon verified motion and after due hearing, may
order any person in possession or control of a designated
land or other property, to permit entry for the purpose of
inspecting, measuring, surveying, or photographing the
property or any relevant object or operation thereon.

The motion shall state in detail the place or places
to be inspected. It shall be supported by affidavits or
testimonies of witnesses having personal knowledge
of the enforced disappearance or whereabouts of the
aggrieved party.
If the motion is opposed on the ground of national
security or of the privileged nature of the information,
the court, justice or judge may conduct a hearing in
chambers to determine the merit of the opposition. The
movant must show that the inspection order is necessary
to establish the right of the aggrieved party alleged to be
threatened or violated.
The inspection order shall specify the person or
persons authorized to make the inspection and the date,
time, place, and manner of making the inspection and may
prescribe other conditions to protect the constitutional
rights of all parties. The order shall expire five days after
the date of its issuance, unless extended for justifiable
reasons (Sec. 14[b], Rule on the Writ of Amparo).
(d) Production Order (PO) The court, justice or
judge, upon verified motion and after due hearing, may
order any person in possession, custody or control of any
designated documents, papers, books, accounts, letters,

Provisional remedies (interim reliefs) available to the
respondent in a petition for a writ of amparo

It is not only the petitioner who may avail of interim
reliefs in a petition for a writ of amparo. The respondent may
likewise avail of the appropriate reliefs upon a verified motion
of the respondent, and after due hearing the court, justice or
judge may issue (a) an inspection order, or (b) a production
order (Sec. 15, Rule on the Writ of Amparo).
Special provisional remedies under R.A. 8369

R.A. 8369 (An Act Establishing Family Courts, Granting
them Exclusive Original Jurisdiction over Child and Family
Cases) provides for certain provisional remedies described in
the law as special provisional remedies.
1. In case of violence among immediate members of the
family living in the same domicile or household, the Family
Court may issue a restraining order against the accused
or defendant if the complainant or victim files a verified
application for relief from abuse (Sec. 7, R.A. 8369).
2. In all civil actions for the custody of children, the
court may order the temporary custody of the children (Sec. 7,
R.A. 8369).

119

3. In all civil actions for support, the court may also
order (a) support pendente lite, (b) deduction from the salary,
and (c) the use of the conjugal home and other properties (Sec.

2. Certain interim reliefs may be availed of under
R.A. 9262 even before or in the absence of a decree of legal
separation, annulment or declaration of absolute nullity of
marriage and for the protection of women and their children.
Such interim reliefs are available within the protection order
defined in the law. The protection order, under the law, shall
be applicable even in cases impliedly instituted with the
criminal actions involving violence against women and their
children.
3. A protection order under Sec. 8 of R.A. 9262, is an
order issued for the purpose of preventing further acts of
violence against a woman or her child as specified in the law
and granting other necessary relief. The relief granted under
a protection order serves the purpose of safeguarding the

enforcement agencies.
4. The protection orders that may be issued under R.A.
9262 are the barangay protection order (BPO), temporary

protection orders issued by the Punong Barangay or any
available Barangay Kagawad ordering the perpetrator to
desist from committing acts described in the law, may be issued
after an ex parte determination of the basis of the application,
and when issued, shall be effective for 15 days. Immediately
after the issuance of an ex parte BPO, the Punong Barangay or
Barangay Kagawad shall personally serve a copy of the same
on the respondent, or direct any barangay official to effect its
personal service (Sec. 14, RA. 9262).

tioned upon the provision of security relief may be condi¬
or any act or omission
specified in the order.

4. Interim or provisional relief is requested by written
application transmitted by reasonable means to the court or
arbitral tribunal as the case may be and the party against

arbitration is commenced, but before the constitution of the
arbitral tribunal, or (c) after the constitution of the arbitral
tribunal and at any time during arbitral proceedings but, at
this stage, only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal has no
power to act or is unable to act effectively (Rule 5.2, A.M. No.

Nature of a civil action; purposes
1. A civil action is one by which a party sues another
for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the prevention
or redress of a wrong (Sec. 3[a], Rule 1, Rules of Court).
2. The Rules of Court in Sec. 3(a) of Rule 1 declares the
following purposes of a civil action:
(a) enforcement or protection of a right; or
(b) prevention or redress of a wrong.

Kinds of civil actions
Section 3(a) of Rule 1 classifies civil actions into the
following:
(a) ordinary civil action; and
(b) special civil action.
Ordinary and special civil actions

1. Both ordinary and special civil actions are governed
by the rules for ordinary civil actions, subject to the specific
rules prescribed for a special civil action (Sec. 3[a], Rule 1,
Rules of Court).
2. Although both types of actions are governed by
the rules for ordinary civil actions (Sec. 3[a], Rule 1, Rules
129

130

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

PART II

VOLUME II

of Court), there are certain rules that are applicable
only to
specific special civil actions. The fact that that an
action
is
subject to certain special rules, other than those applicable
ordinary civil actions, is what makes a civil action special. to

Examples of rules not common to both civil actions
1. Section 1 of Rule 2 of the Rules of Court provides
that “Every ordinary civil action must be based on a cause
of
action” (Sec. 1, Rule 2, Rules of Court; Italics supplied).
The
provision clearly makes reference only to an ordinary
civil
action, not to a special civil action.
Since an ordinary civil action must be based on a cause
of action, the defendant, in such action, must have
either
performed or omitted to do an act in violation of
the rights of
the plaintiff. This is because Sec. 2 of Rule 2 defines a
cause of
action as “the act or omission by which a party violates a right
of another” (Sec. 2, Rule 2, Rules of Court).

The concept of a cause of action requiring a
violation
of someone’s right does not, however, appear
relevant to
the special civil action of declaratory relief which is brought
before there is any breach or violation of a deed, will, contract,
statute, executive order or regulation, ordinance, or any
other
governmental regulation (Sec. 1, Rule 63,
Rules of Court).
In short, the cause of action, as defined and required of
an
ordinary civil action, finds no application to the special
civil
action of declaratory relief.
The same holds true to a complaint for interpleader.
In interpleader, the plaintiff may file a complaint
even if he
has sustained no actual transgression of his rights.
In fact,
the plaintiff, in this special civil action, claims
no interest
whatsoever in the subject matter of the action. If
an interest in the subject matter of the action, ever he has
such interest,
in whole or in part, is not disputed by the
(Sec. 1,
Rule 62, Rules of Court). This is not so in claimants
an ordinary civil
action, the cause of action of which involves
a violation of the
rights of a party.

CIVIL ACTIONS
— SPECIAL
Preliminaries

131

Recall that venue in ordinary civil actions is
determined by either the residences of the parties where the
action is personal, or by the location of the property where
the action is real. This dichotomy does not always apply to a
special civil action.
For instance, the venue in a petition for quo warranto
the Supreme Court or Court of Appeals sits if the
where
is
petition is commenced in any of these courts. The venue of
the action, in this case, is fixed by a specific rule without
regard to the residences of the parties. It is only when the
petition is lodged with the Regional Trial Court that residence
is considered in venue analysis. However, while in ordinary
personal civil actions, the residence of either the plaintiff or
the defendant is factored in the determination of venue, a
petition for quo warranto filed with the Regional Trial Court
merely considers the residence of the respondent or of any of
the respondents, and not that of the petitioner (See Sec. 7,
Rule 66, Rules of Court).
If it is the Solicitor General who commences the action,
another special rule is followed because the petition may be
brought in a Regional Trial Court in the City of Manila, in
the Court of Appeals or in the Supreme Court (Sec. 7, Rule 66,
Rules of Court).
3. Ordinary civil actions may be filed initially with
either the Municipal Trial Court or Regional Trial Court
depending upon the jurisdictional amount or nature of the
action involved. On the other hand, there are special civil
actions which can only be initially filed with a Municipal Trial
Court like forcible entry and unlawful detainer cases (Sec.
33[2], B.P. 129, as amended).
4. In an ordinary civil action, unless the complaint
is on its face dismissible under Sec. 1, Rule 9, as amended,
the court shall, within 5 calendar days from receipt of the
initiatory pleading and proof of payment of the requisite
legal fees, direct the clerk of court to issue the corresponding
summons to the defendants (Sec. 1, Rule 14, Rules of Court,
as amended). This rule does not always apply in special civil
2.

actions.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

PART II

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

In Rule 65, for instance, upon the filing of the petition
and the same is found to be sufficient in form and substance,
the court shall issue an order (not summons) requiring the
respondent or respondents to comment on the petition within
10 days from receipt of a copy of the petition (Sec. 6, Rule 65,
Rules of Court). If the petition for certiorari is filed under Rule
64, the comment shall be made within 10 days from notice
(Sec. 6, Rule 64, Rules of Court).
5. As a rule, pleadings in ordinary civil actions need
not be verified, except when otherwise specifically required by
law or rule (Sec. 4, Rule 7, Rules of Court, as amended). On
the other hand, certain special civil actions have to be verified,
as a rule, like a complaint for expropriation (Sec. 1, Rule 67,
Rules of Court), the petitions for certiorari (Sec. 1, Rule 65,
Rules of Court), prohibition (Sec. 2, Rule 65, Rules of Court),
and mandamus (Sec. 3, Rule 65, Rules of Court). An action
for the usurpation of a public office, position or franchise
under Rule 66 on quo warranto, likewise, requires a verified
petition brought in the name of the Republic of the Philippines
(Sec. 1, Rule 66, Rules of Court). A review of the judgments,
resolutions and final orders of the COMELEC and COA under
Rule 64 is brought to the Supreme Court by way of a verified
petition (Sec. 5, Rule 64, Rules of Court). In actions for forcible
entry and unlawful detainer, all pleadings shall be verified
(Sec. 4, Rule 70, Rules of Court). Also, proceedings for indirect
contempt, other than those initiated by the court against
which the contempt was committed, shall be commenced by a
verified petition (Sec. 4, Rule 71, Rules of Court).

In ordinary civil actions, if the defending party fails
to answer within the time allowed therefor, the court shall,
6.

upon motion of the claiming party with notice to the defending
party, and proof of such failure, declare the defending party in
default (Sec. 3, Rule 9, Rules of Court, as amended).

While the rule on default may apply to a special civil action
like in interpleader if any claimant fails to plead (Sec. 5, Rule
62, Rules of Court), a failure to answer the complaint in the

special civil actions of forcible entry or unlawful detainer does
not lead to a declaration of default. Instead, the court, motu
proprio or on motion of the plaintiff, shall render judgment as
may be warranted by the facts alleged in the complaint (Sec.
7, Rule 70, Rules of Court). Note also that, under Rule 70,
a motion to declare the defendant in default is a prohibited
motion (Sec. 13(8], Rule 70, Rules of Court).
The special civil actions in the Rules of Court
1. The special civil actions under the Rules are the
following:
(a) Interpleader (Rule 62);

(b) Declaratory relief and similar remedies (Rule

filing of a complaint, some special civil actions are initiated by
the filing of a petition.

Each of the following special civil actions is commenced

1. Special civil actions may be commenced in various
courts. They may be filed with the MTC (first level courts)
as in the cases of forcible entry or unlawful detainer. These
actions cannot be commenced in any other court.
2. Special civil actions which are real actions (actions
involving title to, possession of, or any interest in real property)
may be filed not only with the RTC but also with the MTC
depending on the assessed value of the property involved (Sec.
33[3], Sec. 19(2], B.P. 129, as amended) like action publiciana,
action reivindicatoria or partition of real property.

3. The special civil actions of certiorari, prohibition
and mandamus may be filed with the Regional Trial Court
if the petition relates to the act or omission of a Municipal
Trial Court, a corporation, board, officer or person. Under the
amendments effective December 27, 2007 by virtue of A.M.
No. 07-7-12-SC, the petitions may also be filed with the Court
of Appeals or the Sandiganbayan whether or not the same
is in aid of the court’s appellate jurisdiction (Sec. 4, Rule 65,
Rules of Court).

If the petition involves an act or omission of a quasi¬
judicial agency, the petition shall be cognizable, as a rule, by
the Court of Appeals, unless otherwise provided by law or rule
(Sec. 4, Rule 65, Rules of Court).

In election cases involving an act or omission of a
municipal or regional trial court, the petition shall be filed
exclusively with the Commission on Elections in aid of its
appellate jurisdiction (Sec. 4, Rule 65, as amended by A.M.
No. 07-7-12-SC, effective December 27, 2007).
Under Rule 56, the petitions may also be filed with the
Supreme Court including quo warranto petitions. A quo
warranto petition may also be filed with the Regional Trial
Court (Sec. 21(1], B.P. 129, as amended) or the Court of
Appeals (Sec. 9(1], B.P. 129 as amended).

Remember the rule that when a case is subject to
concurrent jurisdictions, the principle of hierarchy of courts
shall apply. Thus, even if a petition for certiorari may be
commenced in the RTC, CA, and SC, the petition will not be
entertained by the higher court absent justifications for its
non-filing with the lowest court.

An interpleader may be commenced in the Regional
Trial Court or in the Municipal Trial Court depending on the
subject matter or the amount of the claim.
5. A petition for declaratory relief is to be filed with
the Regional Trial Court but a similar remedy like quieting of
title may be filed with the Municipal Trial Court depending on
the assessed value of the property (Bank of Commerce v. San
Pablo, Jr., 522 SCRA 713, 724).

INTERPLEADER
Meaning of interpleader; purpose

An interpleader is a special civil action filed by a person
against whom two conflicting claims are made upon the same
subject matter and over which he claims no interest whatever,
or if he has an interest, it is one which, in whole or in part, is
not disputed by the claimants. The action is brought against
the conflicting claimants to compel them to interplead and
litigate their claims among themselves (Sec. 1, Rule 62, Rules
of Court). (Bar 1998)
Requisites for an interpleader (Bar 2012)

1. As gleaned from the Rules, an action for interpleader
requires that:
(a) There must be two (2) or more claimants with
adverse or conflicting interests upon a subject matter;

(b) The conflicting claims involve the same subject

matter;
(c) The conflicting claims are made against the

same person (plaintiff);
(d) The plaintiff' has no claim upon the subject
matter of the adverse claims or if he has an interest at
all, such interest is not disputed by the claimants (Sec. 1,
Rule 62, Rules of Court).
2. The provisions of Sec. 1 of Rule 62 emphasize the
existence of conflicting claims between or among the conflicting
claimants. It is, however, clear from the rule that the mere
137

138

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME n

existence of conflicting claims between or among several
persons is not sufficient to sustain an interpleader action
where such claims do not refer to the same subject matter.
Where the subject matters are different, the claims are to be
deemed separate and distinct, and an interpleader will not
apply.
Also, the conflicting claims over the same subject matter
will not sustain an action in interpleader if such claims are
merely claims against each other but not claims against the
plaintiff in interpleader. The rule requires that the conflicting
claims “be made against a person who claims no interest
whatever in the subject matter.”

3. It is equally clear under Sec. 1 of Rule 62 that where
the claims are against the plaintiff in interpleader who also has
an interest in the subject matter of the adverse claims, then
an interpleader will not lie. The rule requires that the person
against whom the conflicting claims are asserted “claims no
interest whatever in the subject matter,” or if he has such an
interest, it “is not disputed by the claimants.”
When interpleader is proper; when filed (Bar 2018)

1. An interpleader usually originates from a situation
where a person has property in his custody over which he him¬
self asserts no interest, but several persons claim a right to the
property. It may also arise when one, who has an obligation to
perform an act, is confronted with conflicting claims asserting
the right to be entitled to the benefits of the performance of the
obligation. The person upon whom the conflicting claims are
made is faced with a legal problem involving a determination
of who among the conflicting claimants has the legal right to
receive the property subject of the controversy or who among
them is entitled to the performance of the obligation.

Interpleader may also result when two or more persons
claim a right to collect from a debtor who admits his liability
but is uncertain as to who among several claimants is entitled
to payment. The remedy of the debtor under such a situation is
to file an action for interpleader. He then deposits the amount

owed to the court and prays that the claimants litigate their
dispute between or among themselves. In effect, the plaintiff,
in filing the action, asks from the court that he be dismissed
from the suit and be relieved of any liability arising from the
subject matter of the interpleader.
2. In a relatively recent case, the petitioners alleged
that they did not pay the rentals because they did not know to
whom payment should be made. The fact of non-payment was
clearly established by the facts. The Court, however, ruled that
this did not justify their failure to pay because, if such were
the case, they were not without any remedy. They should have
availed of the provisions of the Civil Code on the consignation
of payment and the Rules of Court on interpleader. Such
remedies were not availed of by the petitioner.
The Court clearly explained:
xxx
“In the instant case, consignation alone would
have produced the effect of payment of the rentals. The
rationale for consignation is to avoid the performance of
an obligation becoming more onerous to the debtor by
reason of causes not imputable to him. Petitioners claim
that they made a written tender of payment and actually
prepared vouchers for their monthly rentals. But that
was insufficient to constitute a valid tender of payment.
Even assuming that it was valid tender, still, it would
not constitute payment for want of consignation of the
amount. Well-settled is the rule that tender of payment
must be accompanied by consignation in order that the
effects of payment may be produced.

Moreover, Sec. 1, Rule 62 of the Rules of Court provides:

—

Section 1. When interpleader proper. Whenever
conflicting claims upon the same subject matter are or

whatever in the subject matter, or an interest which
in whole or in part is not disputed by the claimants, he
may bring an action against the conflicting claimants

to compel them to interplead and litigate their several
claims among themselves.
Otherwise stated, an action for interpleader is
proper when the lessee does not know to whom payment
of rentals should be made due to conflicting claims on
the property (or on the right to collect). The remedy is
afforded not to protect a person against double liability
but to protect him against double vexation in respect of
one’s liability.
Notably, instead of availing of the above remedies,
petitioners opted to refrain from making payments"
(Pasricha v. Don. Luis Dizon Realty, Inc., 548 SCRA 273,
290-292).

3. The special civil action for interpleader is proper
when the lessee does not know the person entitled to the
payment of the rentals due because of conflicting claims on
the property. An interpleader allows a person to pass the
legal problem over to the court which will have to eventually
adjudicate upon the adverse claims, enabling the plaintiff to
protect himself from possible lawsuits initiated by any of the
claimants (See Pasricha v. Don Luis Dizon Realty, Inc., 548
SCRA 273, 292).
As the Court put it in another case:
XXX

“The action of interpleader is a remedy whereby a
person who has property whether personal or real, in his
possession, or an obligation to render wholly or partially,
without claiming any right in both, or claims an interest
which in whole or in part is not disputed by the conflicting
claimants, comes to court and asks that the persons who
claim thesaid property or who consider themselves entitled
to demand compliance with the obligation, be required to
litigate among themselves, in order to determine finally
who is entitled to one or the other thing. The remedy is
afforded not to protect a person against a double liability
but to protect him against a double vexation in respect of
one’s liability. When the court orders that the claimants
litigate among themselves, there arises in reality a new

action and the former are styled interpleaders, and in such
a case the pleading which initiates the action is called
a complaint in interpleader and not a cross-complaint”
(Ocampo v. Tirana, 455 SCRA 62, 76; Case cited later in a
SC Minute Resolution in Stradcom Corporation v. Santos,
G.R. No. 197311, January 24, 2012).

Illustrations
1. A classic example is that of a warehouseman who has
custody of goods claimed to be owned by two or more persons
who do not have the same interests. He may file an action for
interpleader and pass on to the court the determination as to
who the rightful owner is.
The basis of the need to file an interpleader, in the case
is actually the substantive law provisions
warehouseman,
of a
Receipts
Law (Act 2137). Under said law,
of the Warehouse
where a warehouseman delivers the goods to one who is not in
fact entitled to possession, the warehouseman shall be Hable
for conversion (Sec. 10, Warehouse Receipts Law).
A warehouseman may also be sued for damages if he
refuses to deliver the goods. Hence, Sec. 17 of the same law
authorizes him to require all known claimants to interplead
to shield him from liability, thus:

—

“Sec. 17 x x x If more than one person claims the
title or possession of the goods, the warehouseman may,
either as a defense to an action brought against him for
non-delivery of the goods or as an original suit, whichever
is appropriate, require all known claimants to interplead.”

It must, however, be mentioned that the warehouseman

has actually an interest in the goods deposited to the extent
of his lien on the goods deposited or on the proceeds thereof
in his hands in accordance with Sec. 27 of the Warehouse
Receipts Law. This interest, however, does not preclude him
from filing a complaint in interpleader because such interest
is one that is not disputed by the claimants.
2. Another usual example is the case of a lessee who
may commence a complaint for interpleader when he is

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

confronted with adverse claimants on the rentals due and he
is in doubt as to who of them should be the rightful recipient
(Ocampo v. Tirana, 455 SCRA 62, 76). (Bar 1988, 2012)
Recall that under the Civil Code of the Philippines, a
cardinal principle to be observed for the validity of payment
or performance is that payment must be made “to the person
in whose favor the obligation has been constituted, or his
successor in interest, or any person authorized to receive it”
(Art. 1240, Civil Code of the Philippines). This means that, as a
rule, payment to the wrong person is not a valid payment and
does not extinguish the obligation. Hence, to protect himself
from liability for making an erroneous payment, where two
or more persons claim the right to collect, the debtor will
have to file an action for interpleader as a step towards the
extinguishment of his obligation.

An insurer may also file a complaint for interpleader
when confronted by conflicting claims on the proceeds of an
insurance policy. (Bar 1978)
3.

143

2. If the subject matter is real property with an
assessed value of not more than four hundred thousand pesos
(P400,000.00), it is the MTC which has jurisdiction. If the
assessed value of the real property exceeds such amount, the
RTC has jurisdiction (Sec. 19(2], B.P. 129, as amended by R.A.
11576).

Under the current law, where the civil action involves
interest in real property (aside from title to, or possession of,
real property), except actions for forcible entry and unlawful
detainer, the assessed value of the property is determinative
of jurisdiction (Secs. 19(2] and 33(3], B.P. 129, as amended
by R.A. 7691; See also Feria and Noche, Civil Procedure
Annotated, Vol. 2, 2001 Ed., p. 423).
3. If the subject matter subject of the interpleader is
one incapable of pecuniary estimation like the performance of
an obligation, the Regional Trial Court has jurisdiction (Sec.
19(1], B.P. 129, as amended).

How commenced

Court with jurisdiction

The court with jurisdiction over an action for interpleader
shall depend upon the following:
1. If the subject matter of the action is personal
property, valued at not more than P2 million, the Municipal
Trial Court (MTC) has jurisdiction. Where the value of the
personal property exceeds P2 million, the Regional Trial
Court has exclusive original jurisdiction. (Bar 1997)

It was held that where the conflicting claims involve
the right to receive a particular sum, the amount of the sum
claimed determines jurisdiction. The issue is who between or
among the defendants is entitled to collect the same and the
amount is the object of the action. There is no merit in the
contention that the subject matter of the litigation is not the
sum, but the right “to compel the defendants to litigate among
themselves” (Makati Development Corporation v. Tanjuatco,
27 SCRA 401, 402).

An interpleader is commenced by the filing of a complaint.
The action is brought by the person against whom conflicting
claims upon the same subject matter are made (Secs. 1 and 2,
Rule 62, Rules of Court).
Interpleader distinguished from intervention

The following are the well-recognized distinctions
between interpleader and intervention:
1. An interpleader is a special civil action, independent
and original. An intervention is not an original action but
merely ancillary and depends upon the existence of a pending
action.
2. An interpleader is commenced by the filing of a
complaint, it being an original action. An intervention is
commenced by a motion for leave to intervene filed in a
pending case attaching thereto the pleading-in-intervention.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

144

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

PART II

VOLUME II

An interpleader is filed by a person who has no
interest in the subject matter of the action or if he has an
interest, the same is not disputed by the claimants. An
intervention is filed by a person who has a legal interest in
any of the following: (a) the subject matter of the litigation;
(b) the success of either of the parties; (c) an interest against
both; or (d) he may be adversely affected by the disposition
or distribution of property in the custody of the court or of an
officer thereof.
3.

In interpleader, the defendants are brought into the
action because they are sued and impleaded as such in the
complaint. In intervention, if a complaint-in-intervention is
filed, the defendants are already parties to an existing suit,
not because of the intervention, but because of the original

suit.
Payment of docket fees; lien

The person who files the complaint pays the docket and
other lawful fees. However, these fees, as well as the costs
and litigation expenses, shall constitute a lien or charge upon
the subject matter of the action, unless the court shall order
otherwise (Sec. 7, Rule 62, Rules of Court).

Rule 62

Motion to dismiss
1. Within the time for filing an answer (which is 15
days from service of summons in accordance with Sec. 5 of
Rule 62), each claimant may file a motion to dismiss on the
ground of (a) impropriety of the interpleader action, or (b) on
other appropriate grounds specified in Rule 16 (Sec. 4, Rule
62, Rules of Court).

2. The appropriate grounds refer to those specified
in Rule 16 (Sec. 4, Rule 62, Rules of Court). These grounds,
which apply to ordinary civil actions, are also made applicable
to and may be invoked in an interpleader action. However, the
2019 Amendments to the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure has
either deleted or transposed the provisions under Rule 16. The
2019 Amendments to the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure now
prohibits motion to dismiss saved only on excepted grounds.
As a general rule, motion to dismiss is a prohibited motion
except on the following grounds:
1) That the court has no jurisdiction over the
subject matter of the claim;

2) That there is another action pending between
the same parties for the same cause; and

1. Summons shall be served upon the conflicting
claimants. Also served together with the summons is a copy of
the complaint and the order (Sec. 3, Rule 62, Rules of Court).

3) That the cause of action is barred by a prior
judgment or by the statute of limitations (Sec. 12[la],
Rule 15, Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 19-1020-SC).

2. The order that shall be served together with the
summons and a copy of the complaint refers to the order
requiring the conflicting claimants to interplead with one
another. This order shall be issued upon the filing of the
complaint (Sec. 2, Rule 62, Rules of Court).

For instance, a motion to dismiss may be filed on the
ground that the court has no jurisdiction over the subject
matter of the action as when the complaint for interpleader
involving chattels with a value of Pl million was filed with the
Regional Trial Court.

3. Aside from the order requiring the claimants to
interplead with one another, the court may include in the
order a direction that the subject matter of the action be paid
or delivered to the court. Such direction shall be made if the
interest of justice so requires (Sec. 2, Rule 62, Rules of Court).

Impropriety of the Interpleader action
1. The ground of impropriety of the filing of a complaint
for interpleader specified in Sec. 4 of Rule 62 is a special and
separate ground.

146

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 62 Interpleader

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

2. For an interpleader to be proper, the requirements
of Sec. 1 of Rule 62 should be complied with such as the
existence of conflicting claims made by the claimants upon the
same subject matter. Where the allegations in the complaint
do not show conflicting claims between or among the persons
required to interplead, the complaint is subject to dismissal
on the ground of impropriety of the interpleader. The ground
to be invoked in this situation is not a failure to state a cause
of action under Sec. 12, Rule 8, as amended, because the
meaning of a cause of action in ordinary civil actions does not
exactly apply to an interpleader. Where the claims are not
conflicting because they refer to different subject matters,
an interpleader will not also lie and a dismissal based on
impropriety of the action may also be invoked.

There could also be impropriety of the interpleader
where it appears from the allegations in the complaint that
the plaintiff claims an interest in the subject matter that is
disputed by the claimants.

It is the general rule that before a person will be deemed to
be in a position to ask for an order of interpleader, he must be
prepared to show, among other prerequisites, that he has not
become independently liable to any of the claimants. Indeed,
if a stakeholder defends a suit filed by one of the adverse
claimants and allows said suit to proceed to final judgment
against him, he cannot later on have that part of the litigation
repeated in an interpleader suit (Wack Wack Golf & Country
Club, Inc. v. Won, et al., G.R. No. L-23851, March 26, 1976).
Effect of the filing of a motion to dismiss on the period to
answer

The period to file an answer is interrupted or tolled by
the filing of a motion to dismiss. If the motion is denied, the
movant may file his answer within the remaining period to
answer, but which shall not be less than 5 days in any event.
This period shall be counted from the notice of denial of the
motion (Sec. 4, Rule 62, Rules of Court).

147

Answer

Each claimant shall file his answer setting forth his claim
within 15 days from service of the summons upon him, serving
a copy thereof upon each of the other conflicting claimants
(Sec. 5, Rule 62, Rules of Court). The rule is clear as to what
the answer should contain. The rule provides that the answer
shall set forth the claim of the answering claimant.
Default
1. If any claimant fails to plead within the time fixed,
the court may, on motion, declare him in default and thereafter
render judgment barring him from any claim in respect to the
subject matter (Sec. 5, Rule 62, Rules of Court).

2. The court, under this provision, is not authorized to
declare a claimant in default motu proprio. Any declaration of
default requires a prior motion to that effect. The tenor of the
rule suggests that a declaration of default is not mandatory
on the part of the court. The use of the word “may” leaves no
doubt as to the meaning of the rule.
3. Observe that each claimant is required under Sec.
5 of Rule 62 to serve a copy of his answer upon the other
conflicting claimants. This is because the litigation is actually
between or among the conflicting claimants, and the plaintiff
in an interpleader claims no interest in the subject matter.
Section 1 of Rule 62 clearly recognizes that the complaint in
interpleader is filed to compel the claimants to interplead and
litigate their several claims among themselves, and not for
the plaintiff to enforce or protect a right, prevent or redress a
wrong against him or to seek an affirmative relief for himself.
4. When the court declares a claimant in default, the
judgment to be rendered is specified by the rule. The judgment
is one that bars him from any claim in respect to the subject
matter (Sec. 5, Rule 62, Rules of Court).

Reply

1. Under Sec. 5 of Rule 62, each of the claimants shall
file his answer within 15 days from the service of summons

CIVIL PROCEDURE

VOLUME II

upon him. A copy of the answer shall be served by each
claimant upon each other.

2. Under Sec. 5 of Rule 62, the claimant served with
the answer may file his reply to the same. The rule does not
consider the filing of a reply mandatory.

Note: The 2019 Amendments to the 1997 Rules of Civil
Procedure prohibited the filing of a reply unless an actionable
document is attached to the answer (Sec. 10, Rule 6, Rules of
Court, as amended).

Rule 63
DECLARATORY RELIEF AND SIMILAR REMEDIES

I — DECLARATORY RELIEF

Other pleadings

Meaning

The parties to an interpleader action may file counter¬
claims, cross-claims, third-party complaints and responsive
pleadings thereto, as provided by the Rules (Sec. 5, Rule 62,
Rules of Court). Such pleadings may, likewise, be filed in an
interpleader because, as a rule, special civil actions are also
governed by the rules for ordinary civil actions, subject to
specific rules prescribed for a particular special civil action
(Sec. 3fa], Rule 1, Rules of Court).

A pre-trial is also conducted in an interpleader action in
accordance with the Rules (Sec. 6, Rule 62, Rules of Court).
Hence, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court shall also apply.

Declaratory relief is defined as an action by any person
interested in a deed, will, contract or other written instrument,
executive order or resolution, to determine any question
of construction or validity arising from the instrument,
executive order or regulation, or statute; and for a declaration
of his rights and duties thereunder. The only issue that may
be raised in such a petition is the question of construction or
validity of provisions in an instrument or statute (Province
of Camarines Sur v. Court of Appeals, 600 SCRA 569, 584585). Corollary is the general rule that such an action must
be justified, as no other adequate relief or remedy is available
under the circumstances (Almeda v. Bathala Marketing
Industries, Inc., 542 SCRA 470, 478).

Determination; adjudication

Purpose of declaratory relief

The court shall determine the respective rights of the
claimants and shall adjudicate the several claims:
(a) after the pleadings of the conflicting claimants
have been filed; and

1. The petition is brought for the court to (a) determine
any question of construction or validity arising from the
subject of the action, and (b) seek for a declaration of the
petitioner’s rights thereunder (Sec. 1, Rule 63, Rules of
Court; See also Social Justice Society v. Lina, 574 SCRA 462,
466). In its practical application, actions to declare a law, a
statute or executive order unconstitutional have been brought
as petitions for declaratory relief (See Allied Broadcasting
Center, Inc. v. Republic, 190 SCRA 782, 786).

Pre-trial

(b) the pre-trial has been conducted (Sec. 6, Rule
62, Rules of Court).

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 63 — Declaratory Relief and Similar Remedies

VOLUME II

2. An action for declaratory relief is brought to secure
an authoritative statement of the rights and obligations of
the parties under a contract or statute for their guidance
in the enforcement or compliance with the same (Meralco
v. Philippine Consumers Foundation, Inc., 374 SCRA 262,
276) and not to settle issues arising from its alleged breach
(Tambunting v. Sumabat, 470 SCRA 92, 96).
3. To reiterate, the purpose of the petition is to ask the
court to determine any question of construction or validity
arising from the subject matter, and for the declaration of
rights and duties therein (Sec. 1, Rule 63, Rules of Court).
Thus, the purpose is to seek for a judicial interpretation of
an instrument or for a judicial declaration of a person’s rights
under a statute and not to ask for affirmative reliefs like
injunction, damages or any other relief beyond the purpose of
the petition as declared under the Rules. It is not brought to
settle issues arising from a breach because after the breach of
the contract or statute, the petition can no longer be brought.
The prevailing rule, therefore, is that “where a declaratory
judgment as to a disputed fact would be determinative of issues
rather than a construction of definite stated rights, status and
other relations, commonly expressed in a written instrument,
the case is not one for declaratory judgment.” Considering the
nature of a proceeding for declaratory judgment, wherein relief
may be sought only to declare rights and not to determine
or try issues, a declaratory relief proceeding is unavailable
where judgment would have to be made, only after a judicial
investigation of disputed issues (Kawasaki Port Service
Corporation v. Amores, 199 SCRA 230, 236-237).

TWo types of actions under Rule 63; similar remedies
1. There are two types of actions referred to under Sec.
1 of Rule 63. The said Section has two paragraphs and each
deals with different types of actions.

2. The first paragraph refers to an action for declaratory
relief. The second paragraph deals with “similar” remedies.
These remedies are:

161

(a) Action for the reformation of an instrument
(Arts. 1359-1369 of the Civil Code);
(b) Action for quieting of title to real property or
remove clouds therefrom (Arts. 476-481, Civil Code); and
(c) Action for consolidation of ownership (Art. 1607,
Civil Code).
3. The Supreme Court refers to Sec. 1 of Rule 63 when
it explains, thus:
“The foregoing section can be dissected into two parts.
The first paragraph concerns declaratory relief, which
has been defined as a special civil action by any person
interested under a deed, will, contract or other written
instrument or whose rights are affected by a statute,
ordinance, executive order or regulation to determine
any question of construction or validity arising under
the instrument, executive order or regulation, or statute
and for a declaration of his rights and duties thereunder.
The second paragraph pertains to (1) an action for the
reformation of an instrument; (2) an action to quiet title;
and (3) an action to consolidate ownership in a sale with
a right to repurchase” (Reyes v. Dizon, 628 SCRA 1, 13,
August 11, 2010).

When court may refuse a judicial declaration (Bar 2012)

The types of actions under Sec. 1 of Rule 63 are
treated differently by the Rules. In declaratory relief, “the
court, motu proprio or upon motion, may refuse to exercise the
power to declare rights and to construe instruments in any
case where a decision would not terminate the uncertainty or
controversy which gave rise to the action, or in any case where
the declaration or construction is not necessary and proper
under the circumstances” (Sec. 5, Rule 63, Rules of Court).
1.

I

In declaratory relief, the court is given the discretion
to act or not to act on the petition. It may, therefore, choose
not to construe the instrument or refrain from declaring the
rights of the petitioner under the deed or law. A refusal of
the court to declare a right or construe an instrument may be

CIVIL PROCEDURE

152

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

considered as the functional equivalent of the dismissal of the
petition but on any of the two grounds under Sec. 5 of Rule 63,
namely:
(a) Where a decision on the petition would not
terminate the uncertainty or controversy which gave rise
to the action; or (Bar 2012)

(b) Where the declaration or construction is not
necessary and proper under the circumstances as when
the instrument or the statute has already been breached
(See De Borja v. Pinalakas na Ugnayan ng Maliliit na
Mangingisda ng Luzon, Mindanao, at Visaya ("PUMALUMV’], G.R. No. 185320, April 19, 2017).

On the other hand, the court does not have the
discretion to refuse to act with respect to actions described as
“similar remedies” (reformation of the instrument, quieting of
title and consolidation of ownership).
2.

Section 5 of Rule 63 makes reference to those denominated
as “similar remedies” when it declares: “Except in actions
falling under the second paragraph of Section 1 of this Rule
x x x.” Thus, in an action for reformation of an instrument,
quieting of title or consolidation of ownership, the court cannot
refuse to act and render a judgment. This is plain from the
phraseology of Sec. 5 of Rule 63.
Requisites for declaratory relief

Decisional law enumerates the requisites of an action for
declaratory relief, as follows:
(a) The subject matter of the controversy must be a
deed, will, contract or other written instrument, statute,
executive order or regulation, or ordinance;
(b) The terms of said statute or document and
the validity thereof are doubtful and require judicial

construction;
(c) There must have been no breach of the statute
or document in question;

— —

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS

153

(d) There must be an actual justiciable controversy
or the “ripening seeds” of one between persons whose
interests are adverse;
(e) The issue must be ripe for judicial determina¬
tion; and
(f) Adequate relief is not available through other
means or other forms of action or proceeding (Almeda v.
Bathala Marketing Industries, Inc., 542 SCRA, 470, 478479; De Borja v. Pinalakas na Ugnayan ng Maliliit na
Mangingisda ng Luzon, Mindanao, at Visaya [“PUMALUMV"], G.R. No. 185320, April 19, 2017; Commissioner of
Internal Revenue v. Standard Insurance Company, Inc.,
G.R. No. 219340, November 7, 2018).

Subject matter in a petition for declaratory relief; exclusive

1. The subject matter in a petition for declaratory relief
is any of the following:
(a) deed;

(b)
(c)
(d)
(e)

will;

contract or other written instrument;

statute;
executive order or regulation;
(f) ordinance; or
(g) any other governmental regulation (Sec. 1, Rule
63, Rules of Court).

2. The subject matters to be tested in a petition for
declaratory relief are exclusive. It was held that, under the
Rules, only a person who is interested “under a deed, will,
contract or other written instrument, and whose rights are
affected by a statute or ordinance, may bring an action to
determine any question of construction or validity arising
under the instrument or statute and for a declaration
of his rights or duties thereunder.” This means that the
subject matter must refer to a deed, will, contract or other
written instrument, or to a statute or ordinance, to warrant

declaratory relief. Any other matter not mentioned therein
is deemed excluded. This is under the principle of expressio
unius est exclusio alterius (Lerum v. Cruz, 87 Phil. 652, 657 as
cited in Reyes v. Ortiz, 628 SCRA 1, 14, August 11, 2010).

3. Since the enumeration of the subject matter is
exclusive (Mangakas v. Paredes, 515 SCRA 709, 716), an
action not based on any of the enumerated subject matters
cannot be the proper subject of declaratory relief.
When a petition for declaratory relief is not proper; examples
(Bar 1998)
1. An action for declaratory relief to ask the court to
declare his filiation and consequently his hereditary rights is
improper. The action is not based on a deed, a will, statute or
any of those enumerated as the subject matter of the petition
(Edades u. Edades, 99 Phil. 675, 678).

An action for declaratory relief to seek judicial
declaration of citizenship to correct a previous unilateral
registration by petitioner as an alien is improper, the action
not being founded on a deed, contract or any ordinance (Obiles
v. Republic, 92 Phil. 864, 866-867).
2.

3. Common reason suggests that a petition for
declaratory relief is not proper for the purpose of seeking
enlightenment as to the true import of a judgment. The
remedy is to move for a clarificatory judgment.

Thus, the Court declared that a petition for declaratory
relief cannot properly have a court decision as its subject
matter. A court decision cannot be interpreted as included
within the purview of the words “other written instrument”
for the simple reason that the provisions of the Rules of
Court already provide for the ways by which an ambiguous or
doubtful decision may be corrected or clarified without need
of resorting to a petition for declaratory relief (Reyes v. Dizon,
628 SCRA 1, 15).
4. A petition for declaratory relief is not proper to assail
a judgment. Before a judgment becomes final and executory,

—

Rule 63 Declaratory Relief and Similar Remedies

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

155

the aggrieved party may file a motion for reconsideration,
motion for new trial, or perfect an appeal. After the judgment
becomes final and executory, he may file a petition for relief
from judgment or an action to annul the judgment. Besides,
Sec. 1 of Rule 63 does not mention a judgment as a proper
subject of a petition for declaratory relief.
5. Even if the subject is one enumerated under the
Rules, where the contract or statute is clear in its terms and
there is no doubt as to its meaning and validity, a petition for
declaratory relief is improper. There would then be no need
for construction or declaration of one’s rights thereunder.
The petition presupposes that the terms of a document or of
a statute are of doubtful validity and, thus, require judicial
interpretation.
Issue and relief

The only issue that may be raised in such a petition is
the question of construction or validity of provisions in an
instrument or statute (Province of Camarines Sur u. Court
of Appeals, 600 SCRA 569, 584-585). The remedy sought is
the declaration of the petitioner’s rights or duties thereunder
(Sec. 1, Rule 63, Rules of Court).
Who may file the petition

Where the subject of the petition is a deed,
will, contract or other written instrument, the petition is
commenced by “any person interested” therein (Sec. 1, Rule
63, Rules of Court; Social Justice Society v. Lina, 574 SCRA
462, 466).
Those who may sue under the contract should have an
interest therein like the parties, their assignees and heirs as
required by substantive law (Art. 1311, Civil Code).
1.

2. Where the subject of the petition is a statute,
executive order or regulation, ordinance, or any other
governmental regulation, the petition is commenced by one
“whose rights are affected” by the same (Sec. 1, Rule 63, Rules
of Court).

Other parties
1,
The other parties are all persons who have or claim
any interest which would be affected by the declaration (Sec.
2, Rule 63, Rules of Court).

2. The rights of persons not made parties to the action
do not stand to be prejudiced by the declaration (Sec. 2, Rule
63, Rules of Court). Since their rights are not to be prejudiced
by their non-inclusion, the failure to implead such persons
does not, therefore, affect the jurisdiction of the court over the
petition (Baguio Citizen’s Action, Inc. v. The City Council, 121
SCRA 368, 375-376).
3. Where the action involves the validity of a local gov¬
ernment ordinance, the corresponding prosecutor or attorney
of the local government unit involved shall be similarly noti¬
fied and entitled to be heard. If such ordinance is alleged to be
unconstitutional, the Solicitor General shall also be notified
and entitled to be heard (Sec. 4, Rule 63, Rules of Court).
4. In any action which involves the validity of a statute,
executive order or regulation, or any other governmental
regulation, the Solicitor General shall be notified by the party
assailing the same and shall be entitled to be heard upon such
question (Sec. 3, Rule 63, Rules of Court).

Court with jurisdiction
1. Section 1 of Rule 63 is explicit. The action for
declaratory relief should be brought “in the appropriate
Regional Trial Court.” The purpose of the petition is to ask
the court to determine any question of construction or validity
arising from the subject matter thereof, and for the declaration
of rights and duties thereunder. Hence, the subject matter of
a petition for declaratory relief raises issues which are not
capable of pecuniary estimation and must be filed with the
Regional Trial Court (Sec. 19[1], B.P. 129; Sec. 1, Rule 63,
Rules of Court).

unconstitutionality and illegality of the questioned rule,
actually partakes of one for declaratory relief, not certiorari
over which this Court has only appellate, not original,
jurisdiction. The Supreme Court has no original jurisdiction
over a petition for declaratory relief. It only has an appellate
jurisdiction over the petition (Clark Investors and Locators
Association, Inc. v. Secretary of Finance, G.R. No. 200670,
July 6, 2015). The action for declaratory relief is not among
the petitions within the original jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court (Mangakas v. Paredes, 515 SCRA 709, 715).
Hence, where a petition seeks a declaration of the
unconstitutionality and/or nullity of a law, it must be treated
as one for declaratory relief and should be brought before
the Regional Trial Court, and not before the Supreme Court
(Allied Broadcasting Center, Inc. v. Republic, 190 SCRA 782,
786).
3. It is procedurally inappropriate to question the
validity of an executive order issued by the President of
the Philippines through a petition for certiorari. A petition
for declaratory relief under Rule 63 is the proper recourse
since the issuance of the executive order is not a judicial
or quasi-judicial act (Galicto v. Aquino III, 667 SCRA 150,
165, February 28, 2012). A petition for declaratory relief is,
likewise, the remedy to set aside an executive order issued
by a city mayor who issued the executive order in connection
with his executive functions (Liga ng mga Barangay National
v. City Mayor of Manila, 420 SCRA 562 as cited in Galicto v.
Aquino III, 667 SCRA 150, 166, February 28, 2012).

Where the action is one for quieting of title, which is
a similar remedy under the second paragraph of Sec. 1 of Rule
63, the jurisdiction will depend upon the assessed value of the
real property.
Where the action is for reconveyance of title to real
property or cancellation of title to real property, the objective
of the action is to actually obtain title to real property. Such
actions are real actions, jurisdiction over which is determined
by the assessed value of the property.

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 63 — Declaratory Relief and Similar Remedies

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Speaking through Chief Justice Puno, the Court held
that actions for reconveyance or cancellation of title or
quieting of title over real property are actions that fall under
the classification of cases that involve “title to, or possession
of, real property, or any interest therein” (Heirs of Valeriana
S. Concha u. Spouses Gregorio J. Lumocso, 540 SCRA 1, 16).
Hence, jurisdiction over such actions shall depend upon the
assessed value of the real property involved.

5. The ruling in the case of Concha was adopted in a
subsequent controversy decided through Justice Peralta. In
San Pedro v. Asdala, 593 SCRA 397, the respondents filed
with the Metropolitan Trial Court (MeTC) of Quezon City,
Branch 42, a complaint against the petitioners for action
reinvindicatoria, quieting of title and damages, with prayer
for preliminary mandatory injunction involving a property
alleged to have an assessed value of P32.100. Accordingly, the
petitioners claimed that they were the owners of a parcel of
land that encompasses and covers the subject property and that
the respondents had allegedly been prevented from entering,
possessing and using the subject property. It was further
alleged that the petitioners’ Transfer Certificate of Title over
their alleged property was spurious. The respondents prayed
among others, that they be declared the sole and absolute
owners of the subject property and that petitioners be ordered
to surrender possession of the said property to them.

The petitioners, for their part, filed a motion to
dismiss said complaint on the ground that the MeTC had
no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action, as the
subject of litigation was incapable of pecuniary estimation.
The motion to dismiss was denied. The denial was anchored
on the relevant provisions of B.P. 129 as amended declaring
that the MeTC has exclusive original jurisdiction over actions
involving title to or possession of real property of small value.
The petitioners’ motion for reconsideration was also denied.
The Supreme Court in sustaining the lower courts merely
reiterated its ruling in Heirs of Valeriano S. Concha, Sr. v.
Spouses Lumocso, 540 SCRA 1.

6.

159

Prior to Concha, the Court, through Justice Chico-

Nazario had ruled:
“The mortgage of the subject property to the Bank
of Commerce, annotated on the Spouses San Pablo’s TCT,
constitutes a cloud on their title to the subject property,
which may, at first, appear valid and effective, but is
allegedly invalid or voidable for having been made without
their knowledge and authority as registered owners. We
thus, have established that the case filed by the spouses
San Pablo before the MTC is actually an action for
quieting of title, a real action, the jurisdiction over which
is determined by the assessed value of the property. The
assessed value of the subject property located in Mandaue
City, as alleged in the complaint, is P4,900.00, which
aptly falls within the jurisdiction of the MTC” (Bank of
Commerce v. Spouses San Pablo, Jr., 522 SCRA 713, 723724; Italics supplied).

In a case involving friar lands, the Court, speaking
through Justice Bersamin, clearly instructed that the original
and exclusive jurisdiction over a complaint for quieting of title
and reconveyance belongs to either the Regional Trial Court
[RTC] or the Municipal Trial Court [MTC] (Heirs of Spouses
Reterta v. Spouses Mores, 655 SCRA 580, 585) using the
assessed value as basis (Ibid., p. 598).

7.

However, where in an action styled as for quieting or
removal of a cloud on a title, the plaintiff actually seeks for
a declaration of his rights, the action is one for declaratory
relief, which properly falls within the jurisdiction of the RTC
pursuant to Rule 63 of the Rules (See Spouses Sabitsana v.
Muertegui, G.R. No. 181359, August 5, 2013).

In relation to an action for quieting of title, a previous
pronouncement of the Supreme Court is enlightening, thus:
“The second paragraph of Section 1, Rule 63 of
the Rules of Court specifically refers to (1) an action
for the reformation of an instrument, recognized under
Articles 1359 to 1369 of the Civil Code; (2) an action to
quiet title, authorized by Articles 476 to 481 of the Civil

i

160

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)
VOLUME II

Code; and (3) an action to consolidate ownership required
by Article 1607 of the Civil Code in a sale with a right
to repurchase. These three remedies are considered
similar to declaratory relief because they also result in
the adjudication of the legal rights of the litigants, often
without the need of execution to carry the judgment into
effect.”

“To determine which court has jurisdiction over the
actions identified in the second paragraph of Section 1,
Rule 63 of the Rules of Court, said provision must be read
together with those of the Judiciary Reorganization Act of
1980, as amended.”
“It is important to note that Section 1, Rule 63 of
the Rules of Court does not categorically require that an
action to quiet title be filed before the RTC. It repeatedly
uses the word may [which means) that an action for
quieting of title may be brought under [the] Rule on
petitions for declaratory relief, and a person desiring to
file a petition for declaratory relief may x x x bring an
action in the appropriate Regional Trial Court. The use
of the word may in a statute denotes that the provision
is merely permissive and indicates a mere possibility, an
opportunity or an option.”

‘In contrast, the mandatory provision of the
Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, as amended,
uses the word shall and explicitly requires the MTC to
exercise exclusive original jurisdiction over all civil
actions which involve title to or possession of real property
where the assessed value does not exceed P20,000.00
x x x x” (Malana v. Tappa, G.R. No. 181303, September
17, 2009; Italics supplied).

The pronouncements in Malana v. Tappa were reiterated
by the Court in a more recent case. Here, the Court explained,
by way of reminder, that for the purpose of determining
jurisdiction, the trial court must interpret and apply the law
on jurisdiction in relation to the averments or allegations of
the ultimate facts in the complaint. For example, the RTC has
jurisdiction over the cause of action for injunction because it
is one incapable of pecuniary estimation. But the same cannot
be true in the case of quieting of title, which is in the nature

that is, an action that involves the issue of
ownership or possession of real property, or any interest in
in view of the expansion of the jurisdiction
real property
of the first level courts under R.A. 7691. As such, the
determination of which trial court had jurisdiction over the
real action is dependent on the assessed value of the property
in dispute. Since in the controversy at hand, the complaint
did not contain any averment of the assessed value of the
property, such failure left the trial court bereft of any basis
to determine which court could validly take cognizance of the
cause of action for quieting of title (Salvador v. Patricia, Inc.,
G.R. No. 195834, November 9, 2016).

of a real action

—

8. It is submitted that an action for reformation of
an instrument should be treated as an action incapable of
pecuniary estimation, the issue therein being one other
than for the recovery of money. Hence, the action should be
instituted with the Regional Trial Court in accordance with
Sec. 19[1] of B.P. 129, as amended.

For the same reason, an action for consolidation of
ownership should also be instituted with the Regional
Trial Court. The assessed value, in this case, should not be
considered in the determination of jurisdiction because the
action does not involve recovery of title to, or ownership of,
real property. As earlier held in Cruz u. Leis, 327 SCRA 570,
578-579, the failure by the vendor to redeem the property
within the stipulated period, vests upon the vendee absolute
title and ownership over the property sold. The action brought
for consolidation of ownership is merely to obtain a judicial
order to effect the registration of the consolidated ownership
in the Registry of Property, not to acquire ownership or title
over the property. Hence, it is not a real action.
Petition for declaratory relief treated as a petition for
prohibition
1. In one case, a petition, captioned as one for declara¬
tory relief, was filed with the Supreme Court assailing the
validity of the impending imposition of value-added tax (VAT)

162

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) on the collections of
tollway operators. The Court issued a resolution, treating the
petition as one for prohibition rather than one for declaratory
relief.

The government sought reconsideration of the Court’s
resolution, arguing that petitioners’ allegations clearly made
out a case for declaratory relief, an action over which the Court
has no original jurisdiction. The government added that the
petition did not meet the requirements of Rule 65 for actions
for prohibition since the BIR did not exercise judicial, quasi¬
judicial, or ministerial functions when it sought to impose VAT
on toll fees. Besides, the petitioners, argued the government,
had a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of law against the BLR in the form of an appeal to the
Secretary of Finance.
The Court ruled that there are precedents for treating
a petition for declaratory relief as one for prohibition if the
case has far-reaching implications and raises questions that
need to be resolved for the public good. The Court also held
that a petition for prohibition is a proper remedy to prohibit
or nullify acts of executive officials that amount to usurpation
of legislative authority. The imposition of VAT on toll fees,
explained the Court, has far-reaching implications. Its
imposition would impact, not only on the more than half a
million motorists who use the tollways every day, but more
so on the government’s effort to raise revenue for funding
various projects and reducing budgetary deficits.

“x x x To dismiss the petition and resolve the issues later,
after the challenged VAT has been imposed, could cause more
mischief both to the tax-paying public and the government. A
belated declaration of nullity of the BIR action would make
any attempt to refund to the motorists what they paid an
administrative nightmare with no solution. Consequently, it is
not only the right, but the duty of the Court to take cognizance
of and resolve the issues that the petition raises.
Although the petition does not strictly comply with the
requirements of Rule 65, the Court has ample power to waive

PART II — SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 63 Declaratory Relief and Similar Remedies

—

163

such technical requirements when the legal questions to be
resolved are of great importance to the public. The same may
be said of the requirement of locus standi which is a mere
procedural requisite” (Diaz v. Secretary of Finance, 654 SCRA
96, 109-110, July 19, 2011).
2. There are instances when a petitioner is faced with
what the Supreme Court terms as “procedural barriers” as
when he files a petition for declaratory relief with the Supreme
Court which has no original jurisdiction over such petition. On
this ground alone, the petition could be dismissed outright.
When, however, the threshold and purely legal issue
in the petition has far-reaching implications to the national
economy, the Court may treat the petition for declaratory
relief as one for mandamus or prohibition depending upon the
allegations in the petition.

The Court, in Gamboa v. Finance Secretary Teves, 652
SCRA 690, explains:
“The Court has no original and exclusive jurisdiction
over a petition for declaratory relief. However, exceptions
to this rule have been recognized. Thus, where the petition
has far-reaching implications and raises questions
that should be resolved, it may be treated as one for
mandamus” (Gamboa, supra, page 708).

The Court, in Gamboa, adds by way of examples:
“In Salvacion v. Central Bank of the Philippines,
343 Phil. 539 (1997), the Court treated the petition for
declaratory relief as one for mandamus considering the
grave injustice that would result in the interpretation
of a banking law. In that case, which involved the crime
of rape committed by a foreign tourist against a Filipino
minor and the execution of the final judgment in the
civil case for damages on the tourist’s dollar deposit with
a local bank, the Court declared Section 113 of Central
Bank Circular No. 960, exempting foreign currency
deposits from attachment, garnishment or any other order
or process of any court, inapplicable due to the peculiar
circumstances of the case. The Court held that injustice

would result especially to a citizen aggrieved by a foreign
guest like accused x x x” that would negate Article 10 of
the Civil Code which provides that “in case of doubt in
the interpretation or application of laws, it is presumed
that the lawmaking body intended right and justice
to prevail.” The Court therefore required respondents
Central Bank of the Philippines, the local bank, and the
accused to comply with the writ of execution issued in the
civil case for damages and to release the dollar deposit of
the accused to satisfy the judgment.

In Alliance of Government Workers v. Minister of
Labor, 209 Phil. 1 (1983), citing Nacionalista Party u.
Angelo Bautista, 85 Phil. 101, and Aquino v. Commission
on Elections, 62 SCRA 275, the Court similarly
brushed aside the procedural infirmity of the petition
for declaratory relief and treated the same as one for
mandamus. In Alliance, the issue was whether the
government unlawfully excluded petitioners, who were
government employees, from the enjoyment of rights to
which they were entitled under the law. Specifically, the
question was: “Are the branches, agencies, subdivisions,
and instrumentalities of the Government, including
government owned or controlled corporations included
among the four 'employers’ under Presidential Decree
No. 851 which are required to pay their employees
x x x a thirteenth (13th) month pay x x x ?” The
Constitutional principle involved therein affected all
government employees, clearly justifying a relaxation of
the technical rules of procedure, and certainly requiring
the interpretation of the assailed presidential decree”
(Gamboa, supra, 707-708).

165

merely interpreting the terms of the contract (Commissioner
of Customs u. Cloribel, 77 SCRA 459, 466).

Applicability of a compulsory counterclaim
1. A petition for declaratory relief may entertain a
compulsory counterclaim as long as it is based on or arising
from the same transaction, subject matter of the petition.
It was ruled that there is nothing in the nature of a special
civil action for declaratory relief that proscribes the filing of a
counterclaim based on the same transaction, deed or contract
subject of the complaint (Visayan Packing Corporation v.
Reparations Commission, 155 SCRA 542, 546; Philippine
Deposit Insurance Corporation u Court of Appeals, 402 SCRA
194, 200).

There is nothing in the nature of a special civil action for
declaratory relief that proscribes the filing of a counterclaim
based on the same transaction, deed or contract subject of the
complaint. A special civil action is, after all, not essentially
different from an ordinary civil action, which is generally
governed by Rules 1 to 56 of the Rules of Court, except that
the former deals with a special subject matter which makes
necessary some special regulation. But the identity between
their fundamental nature is such that the same rules govern¬
ing ordinary civil suits may and do apply to special civil actions
if not inconsistent with or if they may serve to supplement the
provisions of the peculiar rules governing special civil actions
(Department of Budget and Management v. Manila’s Finest
Retirees Association, Inc., 523 SCRA 90, 105).

Inapplicability of a third-party complaint

2.

Because of the absence of allegations seeking material
or affirmative reliefs in a petition for declaratory relief, it has
been held that when the main case is for declaratory relief,
a third-party complaint is inconceivable. The relief sought in
this kind of pleading is contribution, indemnity, subrogation
or other relief from the third-party defendant in respect of
the claim of the plaintiff against him. Accordingly, this relief
cannot be granted because, in a declaratory relief, the court is

“The question to be determined in this case is
whether a counterclaim may be filed and entertained in
declaratory relief proceedings.

A much earlier case held:

By far, the great majority of courts in the United
States of America allow the setting up of a counterclaim
in a petition for declaratory relief or judgment. (87 A.L.R.,
1249 and 68 A.L.R., 113.) The only requirement is that the
subject matter of the said counterclaim be connected with

CIVIL PROCEDURE

166

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

the subject matter of the action and must, of course, arise
out of the same transaction. (Anderson on Declaratory
Judgment, p. 263.) There, it is even allowed to bring in
third parties by counterclaim or cross-complaint. (See
also Borchard on Declaratory Judgment, pp. 812-814.) In
this judgment [th]e [Court] sees no objection to allowing
the filing of a counterclaim in a petition for declaratory
relief. Rule 10 of the Rules of Court provides for the filing
of a counterclaim. And Section 6 of said Rule 10 further
provides that a counterclaim not set up shall be barred if it
arises out or is necessarily connected with the transaction
or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing
party’s claim and does not require for its adjudication
the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot
acquire jurisdiction. This is what is generally termed a
compulsory counterclaim, one which a defendant must
interpose in order to prevent it from being barred in a
subsequent, separate action” (Ledesma v. Morales, 87
Phil. 199, 201-202).
Granting affirmative relief

In a petition for declaratory relief, the petitioner
seeks for a declaration of his rights under an instrument or a
statute. As a rule, therefore, affirmative reliefs as in ordinary
civil actions are not granted in declaratory petitions. There
were instances, however, when affirmative reliefs were
granted by the Court in a petition for declaratory relief.
1.

In Adlawan v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 170
SCRA 165, 176-177, the Court instructed:
2.

“A note on a procedural aspect in this case is,
however, in order. This action was initiated on a petition
for declaratory relief, ostensibly for a declaration of the
rights and obligations of the parties under the laws
and ordinances involved therein or invoked by them.
Consequently, in such special civil action the judgment
does not essentially entail an executory process since
generally, other than a declaration of such rights and
duties, other affirmative reliefs, as these are understood
in ordinary civil actions, are not sought by the proponent.

—

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 63 Declaratory Relief and Similar Remedies

167

However, the Court has held that although the
action is for a declaratory judgment but the allegations
in the complaints are sufficient to make out a case for
specific performance or recovery of property with claims
for damages, and the defendants did not raise an issue
in the trial court to challenge the remedy or form of the
action availed of, the court can grant such affirmative
relief as mav be warranted by the evidence. This decisional
rule applies to the case at bar” (Underscoring supplied;
Adlawan, supra, pp. 176-177).
No executory process as in ordinary civil actions
1. Since the objective of the petition is merely an
interpretation of a deed or a contract or for a definitive
pronouncement of rights under a particular law, rule or order,
there is nothing to execute in the judgment of the court the
way judgments in ordinary civil actions are executed. This
is because the judgment in a declaratory relief is confined
either to an interpretation of a deed or a declaration whether
or not the petitioner has rights under the law. As a general
principle, therefore, the judgment in a declaratory relief is
said to stand by itself and no executory process follows as of
course. It is unlike the judgment in an ordinary civil action
which is coercive in character and enforceable by execution.

2. It was ruled that the judgment in a petition for
declaratory relief can be carried into effect without requiring
the parties to pay damages or perform any act as when the
petitioner’s complaint is captioned as Quieting of Title and
Damages, but all that the petitioner prayed for is for the court
to uphold the validity of its titles as against that of respondent
(Phil-Ville Development and Housing Corporation u. Bonifacio,
651 SCRA 327, 351).
3. In one case, the petitioner posited that the trial court
erred in ordering it to pay the balance of the deposit insurance
to respondents, maintaining that the petition stemmed from a
petition for declaratory relief which does not essentially entail
an executory process, and the only relief that should have
been granted by the trial court is a declaration of the parties’
rights and duties. As such, petitioner continues, no order of

188

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

payment may arise from the case as this is beyond the office of
declaratory relief proceedings.

The Court agreed with the contention of the petitioner.
It ruled: “Without doubt, a petition for declaratory relief
does not essentially entail an executory process” (Philippine
Deposit Insurance Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 402 SCRA
194, 200).
4. Jurisprudence, however, does not absolutely close
the doors to an executory process in a petition for declaratory

relief.

In one case involving Integrated National Police retirees,
who, according to the Court, can no longer afford protracted
litigation, the Court, in what appears to be evidently an
application of the principle of the liberal construction of the
rules, declared that the execution of judgments in a petition
for declaratory relief is not necessarily indefensible since a
special civil action is, after all, not essentially different from
an ordinary civil action, which is generally governed by Rules
1 to 56 of the Rules of Court, except that the former deals with
a special subject matter which makes necessary some special
regulation. But the identity between their fundamental nature
is such that the same rules governing ordinary civil suits may
and do apply to special civil actions if not inconsistent with or
if they may serve to supplement the provisions of the peculiar
rules governing special civil actions (Department of Budget
and Management v. Manila’s Finest Retirees Association, Inc.,
523 SCRA 90, 105).
Filing before any breach or violation
1. The petition for declaratory relief is filed before there
occurs any breach or violation of the deed contract, statute,
ordinance or executive order or regulation (Sec. 1, Rule 63,
Rules of Court). It will not prosper when brought after a
contract or a statute has already been breached or violated
(Ollada v. Central Bank of the Philippines, 5 SCRA 297, 303).
Also, when the subject of the action, like a statute has already
been infringed or transgressed prior to the institution of the

—

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 63 Declaratory Relief and Similar Remedies

—

169

petition, declaratory relief is not proper (Commissioner of
Internal Revenue v. Standard Insurance Company, Inc., G.R.
No. 219340, November 7, 2018). If there has already been a
breach, the appropriate ordinary civil action, not declaratory
relief, should be filed.

An action for declaratory relief presupposes that there
has been no actual breach of the instruments involved or of
the rights arising thereunder. Since the purpose of an action
for declaratory relief is to secure an authoritative statement of
the rights and obligations of the parties under a statute, deed,
or contract for their guidance in the enforcement thereof, or
compliance therewith, and not to settle issues arising from an
alleged breach thereof, it may be entertained before the breach
or violation of the statute, deed or contract to which it refers.
A petition for declaratory relief gives a practical remedy for
ending controversies that have not reached the state where
another relief is immediately available; and supplies the need
for a form of action that will set controversies at rest before
they lead to a repudiation of obligations, an invasion of rights,
and a commission of wrongs (Phil-Ville Development and
Housing Corporation v. Bonifacio, 651 SCRA 327, 350-351 ).

2. Where the law or contract has already been
contravened prior to the filing of an action for declaratory relief,
the court can no longer assume jurisdiction over the action. In
other words, a court has no more jurisdiction over an action for
declaratory relief if its subject, i.e., the statute, deed, contract,
etc., has already been infringed or transgressed before the
institution of the action. Under such circumstances, inasmuch
as a cause of action has already accrued in favor of one or
the other party, there is nothing more for the court to explain
or clarify short of a judgment or final order (Tambunting
u. Sumabat, 470 SCRA 92, 96; Martelino v. National Home
Mortgage Finance Corporation, 556 SCRA 663, 677). Hence,
a petition for declaratory relief filed by one, who had been
previously found to have already violated the law subject of the
petition, is improper (Quisumbing v. Garcia, 573 SCRA 266,
286; See also Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Standard
Insurance Company, Inc., G.R. No. 219340, November 7, 2018).

CIVIL PROCEDURE

170

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

3. In a case, the petitioners averred in the complaint
that they had already been deprived of the possession of their
property. The proper remedy, therefore, is the filing of an
accion publiciana or an accion reivindicatoria, not a case for
declaratory relief, because the complaint for quieting of title
was filed after the respondents refused to vacate the subject
property in a direct challenge to the title of the petitioners
(Malana v. Tappa, 600 SCRA 189).

The Court, in Malana, expounds:
XXX

“Where the law or contract has already been
contravened prior to the filing of an action for declaratory
relief, the courts can no longer assume jurisdiction
over the action. In other words, a court has no more
jurisdiction over an action for declaratory relief if its
subject has already been infringed or transgressed before
the institution of the action” (Malana, supra, page 202).

However, when the breach occurs not before the
filing of the petition for declaratory relief but after the action
has been instituted and before its final termination, it is
submitted that the action need not be dismissed because it
may be converted into an ordinary action.
4.

Once converted into an ordinary action, the parties shall
be allowed to file such pleadings as may be necessary or proper
(Sec. 6, Rule 63, Rules of Court).
Although Sec. 6 of Rule 63 may allow such course of action,
the party desiring the conversion needs to argue the point and
specify the ordinary action desired. The same must also be
raised in the trial court and not for the first time on appeal
(Martelino v. National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation,
556 SCRA 663, 677).
Justiciable controversy; other requisites
1. The traditional concept of a cause of action in
ordinary civil actions, as earlier mentioned in Sec. 2 of Rule 2,
does not apply to a declaratory relief where no specific right

PART II — SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 63 Declaratory Relief and Similar Remedies

—

171

of the plaintiff has yet been violated because the action is
brought before a breach of the deed or law occurs.
Thus, in a case, the Court explained that in special
civil actions for declaratory relief, the concept of a cause of
action under ordinary civil actions does not strictly apply.
The reason for this exception is that an action for declaratory
relief presupposes that there has been no actual breach of
the instruments involved or of rights arising thereunder.
Nevertheless, a breach or violation should be impending,
imminent or at least threatened (Velarde v. Social Justice
Society, 428 SCRA 283, 294).

2. The absence of a breach should not, however, be
taken to mean that the petition need not involve a justiciable
controversy.

Thus, the Court laid down certain requirements for an
action for declaratory relief before a trial court to prosper.
It must be shown that (a) there is a justiciable controversy,
(b) the controversy is between persons whose interests are
adverse, (c) the party seeking the relief has a legal interest in
the controversy, and (d) the issue invoked is ripe for judicial
determination (Bayan Telecommunications, Inc. v. Republic,
513 SCRA 560, 568; MMDA v. Viron Transportation Co., Inc.,
530 SCRA 341, 355; CJH Development Corporation v. Bureau
of Internal Revenue, 575 SCRA 467, 471).

Bayan Telecommunications, the case cited in the
immediately preceding paragraph, stemmed from a petition
for declaratory relief filed by Bayan Telecommunications, Inc.,
against the Republic and the National Telecommunications
Commission (NTC). The petition sought the suspension of a
provision of R.A. 7925 requiring a public offering of 30% of the
aggregate common stocks of telecommunication entities with
regulated types of services. The petitioner contended that
the case presented a justiciable controversy ripe for judicial
determination as it faces a possible sanction from the NTC for
its inability to comply with the mandate of the law. The Office
of the Solicitor General argued that no justiciable controversy
was present in the case. As of the pendency of the petition,

CIVIL PROCEDURE

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 63 Declaratory Relief and Similar Remedies

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME n

there were yet no implementing rules and guidelines by the
NTC or any administrative agency to carry the questioned
provision of the law into effect.

The Supreme Court in Bayan Telecommunications, Inc.
v. Republic, 513 SCRA 560, 568, agreed with the Office of the
Solicitor General. It instructed:
“A justiciable controversy is a definite and concrete
dispute touching on the legal relations of parties adverse
having legal interests, which may be resolved by a court
of law through the application of a law. x x x a mere
apprehension of an administrative sanction does not give

rise to a justiciable controversy x X x Whatever sanctions
petitioner fears are merely hypothetical" (Underscoring
supplied).

3. As earlier held, “x x x courts cannot furnish answers
to purposeless questions that do not exist. Even in cases of
declaratory relief, there must be an actual and justiciable,
not merely theoretical, controversy” (Aragones v. Subido, 25
SCRA 95, 102).

The Court, for instance, found a justiciable controversy
in one case. In MMDA u. Viron Transportation Co., Inc., 530
SCRA 341, a petition for declaratory relief was filed with the
RTC of Manila alleging therein that the Metropolitan Manila
Development Authority (MMDA) was poised to issue a circular
that would direct the closure of all provincial terminals in the
Metropolis pursuant to Sec. 2 of the Executive Order dated
February 10, 2003 issued by the President of the Philippines.
Section 2 of the Executive Order directs the MMDA to develop
four interim mass transport terminals in Metro Manila. The
petitioner alleged that this would mean the abandonment
and closure of the existing bus terminals of provincial bus
operators.
Alleging that the MMDA did not possess the authority
to do so, the petitioner asked for a judicial construction of the
scope, extent and limitations of the power of the MMDA under
R.A. 7924, the act creating the MMDA. Another corporation

173

filed a similar petition asking that the Executive Order be
declared unconstitutional. The petitions were subsequently
consolidated.

The trial court initially sustained the constitutionality
of the Executive Order pursuant to R.A. 7924 as a valid
exercise of legislative power. Acting on the separate motions
for reconsideration of the petitioners, the court reversed itself,
this time holding that the Executive Order was an invalid
exercise of police power and that the power of the MMDA did
not include the closure of the bus terminals. The MMDA went
to the Supreme Court to challenge the orders of the trial court.
The Supreme Court found that the Executive Order
directed the immediate establishment of common bus
terminals and allocation of funds by the Department of
Budget and Management. It also observed that the MMDA
had already begun the implementation of the project such that
the construction of the first terminal was already underway.
The Court then held that “the issue had already transcended
the boundaries of what is merely conjectural or anticipatory.”

The Court explained:
“It cannot be gainsaid that the E.O. would have an
adverse effect on respondents. The closure of their bus
terminals would mean, among other things, the loss of
income from the operation and/or rentals of stalls thereat.
Precisely, respondents claim a deprivation of their
constitutional right to property without due process of
law.
Respondents have thus amply demonstrated a
personal and substantial interest in the case such that
[they havej sustained, or will sustain, direct injury as
a result of [the E.O.’s] enforcement. Consequently, the
established rule that the constitutionality of a law or
administrative issuance can be challenged by one who
will sustain a direct injury as a result of its enforcement
has been satisfied by respondents" (supra, 357-358).

4.

In another case with several consolidated petitions

challenging the constitutionality of R.A. 9372, otherwise

Rule 63 — Declaratory Relief and Similar Remedies

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

known as the Human Security Act, the Court had the occasion
to declare and rule:
"Courts do not sit to adjudicate mere academic ques¬
tions to satisfy scholarly interest, however, intellectually
challenging. The controversy must be justiciable — defi¬
nite and concrete, touching on the legal relations of the
parties having adverse legal interests. In other words, the
pleadings must show an active antagonistic assertion of
a legal right, on the one hand, and a denial thereof on the
other hand; that is, it must concern a real and not merely
a theoretical question or issue x x x.
XXX

Thus, a petition to declare unconstitutional a law
converting the Municipality of Makati into a Highly
Urbanized City was held to be premature as it was
tacked on uncertain, contingent events (Mariano, Jr.
u. Commission on Elections, 312 Phil. 259). Similarly,
a petition that fails to allege that an application for a
license to operate a radio or television station has been
denied or granted by the authorities does not present a
justiciable controversy, and merely wheedles the Court
to rule on a hypothetical problem (Allied Broadcasting
Center v. Republic, G.R. No. 91500, 190 SCRA 782).

The Court dismissed the petition in Philippine
Press Institute v. Commission on Elections, 314 Phil.
131, for failure to cite any specific affirmative action of
the Commission on Elections to implement the assailed
resolution. It refused, in Abbas v. Commission on
Elections, G.R. No. 89651, November 10, 1989, 179 SCRA
287, to rule on the religious freedom claim of the therein
petitioners based merely on a perceived potential conflict
between the provisions of the Muslim Code and those
of the national law, there being no actual controversy
between real litigants.

The list of cases denying claims resting on purely
hypothetical or anticipatory grounds goes on ad infinitum

Petitioners’ obscure allegations of sporadic “surveil¬
lance” and supposedly being tagged as “communist
fronts" in no way approximate a credible threat of
prosecution. From these allegations, the Court is being
lured to render an advisory opinion, which is not its
function” (Information Technology Foundation of the
Philippines v. COMELEC, 460 SCRA 291, as cited in
Southern Hemisphere Engagement Network, Inc. v. Anti¬
Terrorism Council, 632 SCRA 146, 176-179, October 5,
2010; Citations of the Court inserted).

5. The Court had always stressed that a person who
impugns the validity of a statute “must have a personal and
substantial interest in the case such that he has sustained,
or will sustain, direct injury as a result of its enforcement.”
The gist of the question of standing is whether a party alleges
“such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy
as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the
presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends
for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.” In public
suits, the plaintiff, representing the general public, asserts a
“public right” in assailing an allegedly illegal official action.
The plaintiff may be a person who is affected no differently
from any other person, and could be suing as a “stranger,”
or as a “citizen” or “taxpayer.” Thus, taxpayers have been
allowed to sue where there is a claim that public funds are
illegally disbursed or that public money is being deflected
to any improper purpose, or that public funds are wasted
through the enforcement of an invalid or unconstitutional
law. Of greater import than the damage caused by the illegal
expenditure of public funds is the mortal wound inflicted
upon the fundamental law by the enforcement of an invalid
statute (Lawyers Against Monopoly and Poverty v. Secretary
of Budget and Management, G.R. No. 164987, April 24, 2012
citing People v. Vera, 65 Phil. 56, 89; Navarro v. Ermita, 648
SCRA 400, 434; David v. Macapagal-Arroyo, 489 SCRA 160;
Public Interest Center, Inc. v. Roxas, 513 SCRA 457, 470).

VOLUME II

II — SIMILAR REMEDIES

(b) When a mutual mistake of the parties causes the
failure of the instrument to disclose their real agreement,
said instrument may be reformed (Art. 1361, Civil Code
of the Philippines).

Reformation of an instrument
1. “Reformation of an instrument is a remedy in equity
where a written instrument already executed is allowed by law
to be reformed or construed to express or conform to the real
intention of the parties. The rationale of the doctrine is that it
would be unjust and inequitable to allow the enforcement of
a written instrument that does not express or reflect the real
intention of the parties” (Spouses Rosario v. Alvar, G.R. No.
212731, September 6, 2017).
An action for reformation is not one brought to reform
a contract but “to reform the instrument” evidencing the
contract. Article 1359 of the Civil Code does not, in fact, refer
to reformation of contracts but of “instruments.”
2. The instrument is to be reformed because despite the
meeting of minds of the parties as to the object and cause of
the contract, the instrument which is supposed to embody the
agreement of the parties does not reflect their true agreement
by reason of mistake, fraud, inequitable conduct, or accident.
The action is brought so the true intention of the parties may
be expressed in the instrument (Art. 1359, Civil Code of the
Philippines).

Examples:
(a) The parties have agreed on the area of the land
subject of the sale. By an act of fraud of the seller who
prepared the deed of sale, a smaller area is indicated in
the deed. Here, there is nothing defective in the contract
which is the meeting of the minds. A contract does not
refer to the instrument, deed or document but to the
“meeting of the minds” (Art. 1305, Civil Code of the

177

(c) An instrument may be reformed if it does not
express the true intention of the parties because of lack
of skill of the person drafting the instrument (Art. 1364,
Civil Code of the Philippines).

|

,

(d) If the parties agree upon the mortgage or pledge
of property, but the instrument states that the property is
sold absolutely or with a right of repurchase, reformation
of the instrument is proper (Art. 1365, Civil Code of the
Philippines).

3. Where the consent of a party to a contract has been
procured by fraud, inequitable conduct or accident, and an
instrument was executed by the parties in accordance with
the contract, what is defective is the contract itself because
of vitiation of consent. The remedy is not to bring an action
for reformation of the instrument but to file an action for
annulment of the contract (Art. 1359, Civil Code of the
Philippines). A contract where one party’s consent is vitiated
is voidable or annullable (Arts. 1330 and 1390[2], Civil Code
of the Philippines).
4. Reformation of the instrument cannot be brought for
any of the following:

(a) Simple donations inter vivos wherein no condi¬
tion is imposed;

(b) Wills; or
(c) When the real agreement is void (Art. 1366,
Civil Code of the Philippines).

Philippines).

The defect is not found in the meeting of the minds.
The defect is found in the deed of sale, which is the
instrument. If an action for reformation is brought, it
must be for the purpose of reforming the instrument.

Consolidation of ownership (Bar 2012)
1. The concept of consolidation of ownership under
Art. 1607 of the Civil Code has its origins in the substantive
provisions of the law on sales. Under the law, a contract of sale

178

CIVIL PROCEDURE

—

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

—

VOLUME II

may be extinguished either by legal redemption (Art. 1619,
Civil Code of the Philippines) or conventional redemption (Art.
1601, Civil Code of the Philippines).

2. Legal redemption, also called retracto legal, is a
statutory mandated redemption of a property previously sold.
For instance, a co-owner of a property may exercise the right
of redemption in case the shares of all the other co-owners or
any of them are sold to a third person (Art. 1620, Civil Code of
the Philippines). The owners of adjoining lands shall have the
right of redemption when a piece of rural land with an area
of one hectare or less is alienated (Art. 1 621, Civil Code of the
Philippines).

3. Conventional redemption, also called pacto de retro
sale, is one that is not mandated by statute but one which
takes place because of the stipulation of the parties to the
sale.

The law provides: “Conventional redemption shall take
place when the vendor reserves the right to repurchase the
thing sold . . .” (Art. 1601, Civil Code of the Philippines). The
period of redemption may be fixed by the parties which cannot
exceed 10 years from the date of the contract. In the absence
of an express agreement, the redemption period shall be 4
years from the date of the contract (Art. 1606, Civil Code of

the Philippines).

4. Where redemption is not made within the period
agreed upon, in case the subject matter of the sale is real
property, Art. 1607 of the Civil Code provides that the
“consolidation of ownership in the vendee . . shall not be
recorded in the Registry of Property without a judicial order,
after the vendor has been duly heard.”

.

5. The action brought to consolidate ownership is not
for the purpose of consolidating the ownership of the property
in the person of the vendee or buyer but for the registration of
the property. The lapse of the redemption period without the
seller a retro exercising his right of redemption consolidates
ownership or title upon the person of the vendee by operation
of law. Article 1607 requires the filing of the petition to

179

consolidate ownership because the law precludes the
registration of the consolidated title without a judicial order.
The case of Cruz u. Leis, 327 SCRA 570, 578-579, is clear:
“It bears stressing that notwithstanding Article
1607, the recording in the Registry of Property of the
consolidation of ownership of the vendee is not a condition
sine qua non to the transfer of ownership. Petitioners are
the owners of the subject property since neither Gertrudes
nor her co-owners redeemed the same within the oneyear period stipulated in the "Kasunduan.” The essence
of a pacto de retro sale is that title and ownership of the
property sold are immediately vested in the vendee a retro,
subject to the resolutory condition of repurchase by the
vendor a retro within the stipulated period. Failure thus
of the vendor a retro to perform said resolutory condition
vests upon the vendee by operation of law absolute title
and ownership over the property sold. As title is already
vested in the vendee a retro, his failure to consolidate
his title under Article 1607 of the Civil Code does not
impair such title or ownership for the method prescribed
thereunder is merely for the purpose of registering the

consolidated title."

Quieting of title; quasi In rem action
1. Quieting of title is brought to remove a cloud on title
to real property or any interest therein. The action is called
one to quiet title to real property. The cloud is caused by any
instrument, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding which
appears to be valid or effective. However, in truth and in fact,
the same is invalid, ineffective, voidable or unenforceable, and
may be prejudicial to the title to real property. Quieting of
title may also be brought as a preventive remedy to prevent a
cloud from being cast upon title to real property or any interest
therein (Art. 476, Civil Code of the Philippines).

There may also be an action to quiet title or remove a cloud
therefrom when the contract, instrument or other obligation
has been extinguished or terminated, or barred by extinctive
prescription (Art. 478, Civil Code of the Philippines).

180

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)
VOLUME II

The plaintiff need not be in possession of the real property
before he may bring the action as long as he can show that he
has a legal or equitable title to the property which is the subject
matter of the action (Art. 477, Civil Code of the Philippines).
2. “Quieting of title is a common law remedy for the
removal of any cloud upon, doubt, or uncertainty affecting
title to real property. Whenever there is a cloud on title to
real property or any interest in real property by reason of
any instrument, record, claim, encumbrance, or proceeding
that is apparently valid or effective, but is, in truth and in
fact, invalid, ineffective, voidable, or unenforceable, and
may be prejudicial to said title, an action may be brought to
remove such cloud or to quiet the title. In such action, the
competent court is tasked to determine the respective rights
of the complainant and the other claimants, not only to place
things in their proper places, and make the claimant, who has
no rights to said immovable, respect and not disturb the one
so entitled, but also for the benefit of both, so that whoever
has the right will see every cloud of doubt over the property
dissipated, and he can thereafter fearlessly introduce any
desired improvements, as well as use, and even abuse the
property” (Phil-Ville Development and Housing Corporation v.
Bonifacio, 651 SCRA 327, 341, June 8, 2011; See also, Spouses
Santiago u. Villamor, G.R. No. 168499, November 26, 2012).
3. As the Court puts it; “the cloud on title consists of:
(1) any instrument, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding;
(2) which is apparently valid or effective; (3) but is in truth
and in fact invalid, ineffective, voidable, or unenforceable; and
(4) may be prejudicial to the title sought to be quieted” (PhilVille Development and Housing Corporation v. Bonifacio, 651
SCRA 327, 347).
4. An action to quiet title is characterized as a proceed¬
ing quasi in rem. In an action quasi in rem, an individual is
named a defendant and the purpose of the proceeding is to
subject his interests to the obligation or loan burdening the
property. Actions quasi in rem deal with the status, ownership
or liability of a particular property but which are intended
to operate on these questions only as between the particular

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 63 Declaratory Relief and Similar Remedies

181

parties to the proceedings and not to ascertain or cut off the
rights or interests of all possible claimants. The judgment
therein is binding only upon the parties who joined in the
action (Phil-Ville Development and Housing Corporation u.
Bonifacio, 651 SCRA 327, 349).

Suits to quiet title are not technically suits in rem, nor
are they, strictly speaking, in personam, but being against the
person in respect of the res, these proceedings are characterized
as quasi in rem. The judgment in such proceedings is
conclusive only between the parties. Thus, those not made
parties in the case are not bound by the decision. The rules
on quieting of title expressly provide that any declaration in
a suit to quiet title shall not prejudice persons who are not
parties to the action (Heirs of Marcelino Doronio v. Heirs of
Fortunato Doronio, 541 SCRA 479, 500-501).
Requisites for quieting of title

1. “An action for quieting of title is essentially a common
law remedy grounded on equity. The competent court is tasked
to determine the respective rights of the complainant and
other claimants, not only to place things in their proper places,
to make the one who has no rights to said immovable respect
and not disturb the other, but also for the benefit of both, so
that he who has the right would see every cloud of doubt over
the property dissipated, and he could afterwards without fear
introduce the improvements he may desire, to use, and even
to abuse the property as he deems best” (Mananquil v. Moico,
G.R. No. 180076, November 21, 2012).

Hence, in order that an action for quieting of title may
prosper, two requisites must concur: (1) the plaintiff or
complainant has a legal or equitable title or interest in the
real property subject of the action; and (2) the deed, claim,
encumbrance, or proceeding claimed to be casting cloud on his
title must be shown to be, in fact, invalid or inoperative despite
its prima facie appearance of validity or legal efficacy (PhilVille Development and Housing Corporation v. Bonifacio, 651
SCRA 327, 341, June 8, 2011; Spouses Basa u. Vda. de Senly
Loy, G.R. No. 204131, June 4, 2018).

182

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

The title need not be a legal one because an equitable title
is sufficient. The Court, in one case, clarified: “In order that
an action for quieting of title may prosper, it is essential that
the plaintiff must have a legal or equitable title to, or interest
in, the property which is the subject matter of the action.
Legal title denotes registered ownership, while equitable title
means beneficial ownership. In the absence of such legal or
equitable title, there is no cloud to be prevented or removed”
(Mananquil v. Moico, G.R. No. 180076, November 21, 2012).
2. Stated differently, the plaintiff must first show
that he has a legal or at least an equitable title over the
real property in dispute, and that some deed or proceeding
beclouds its validity or efficacy. Thus, where the certificate
of title shows that the land was clearly issued in the name of
the heirs of a certain person, the petitioner, not being an heir,
has neither legal nor equitable title to the property subject of
the action for quieting of title. The action must be dismissed
(Chung u. Mondragon, G.R. No. 179754, November 21, 2012).
Also, in order to maintain a suit for quieting of title where
the grantee of a land under a National Housing Authority
(NHA) program has passed away, the plaintiffs must show
that under the terms of the NHA program, they are legitimate
successors to or beneficiaries of the deceased upon his death.
Proof of heirship alone does not suffice. Without such evidence,
their legal or equitable interest in the property could not be
established (Mananquil v. Moico, G.R. No. 180076, November
21, 2012).

Rule 64
REVIEW OF JUDGMENTS AND FINAL ORDERS OR
RESOLUTIONS OF THE COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS
AND THE COMMISSION ON AUDIT
Preliminaries
1. Rule 64 has the Constitution of 1987 as its basis.
Section 7 of Art. IX-A (Constitutional Commissions) provides:

“. . . Unless otherwise provided by this Constitution
or by law, any decision, order, or ruling of each commission
may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari by the
aggrieved party within thirty days from receipt of a copy
thereof.”

The provision was interpreted by the Supreme Court,
through Rule 64, to refer to certiorari under Rule 65 and not
to appeal by certiorari under Rule 45. As early as the case of
Aratuc v. Commission on Elections, 88 SCRA 251, 272, the
Court had already declared:
“(The Court] hold[s], x x x that under existing
constitutional and statutory provisions, the certiorari
jurisdiction of the Court over orders, rulings and decisions
of the Comelec x x x should be confined to instances
of grave abuse of discretion amounting to patent and
substantial denial of due process x x x.”

2. The constitutional mandate is now implemented by
Rule 64 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides
for the review of the judgments, final orders or resolutions
of the Commission on Elections and the Commission on
Audit. As Rule 64 states, the mode of review is by a petition
183

CIVIL PROCEDURE

184

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

for certiorari in accordance with Rule 65 to be filed with the
Supreme Court (Lokin, Jr. v. Commission on Elections, 621
SCRA 385, 400).
Applicability of Rule 64

Rule 64 governs the review of judgments, final orders
(not interlocutory orders) or resolutions of the Commission on
Elections and the Commission on Audit (Sec. 1, Rule 64, Rules

of Court).

The above rule has been held not to be encompassing and
not all petitions for the review of judgments or final orders of
these commissions should be filed under Rule 64.
For instance, the ruling of the Commission on Elections
En Banc choosing the winning bidder for election equipment
is not reviewable under Rule 64 since in this case, the
Commission is not resolving an election controversy but merely
performing its function to procure the necessary election
paraphernalia. Under the protest mechanism of Sec. 58 of
R.A. 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act), protests on
the final decision of the head of the procuring entity should
be addressed to the Regional Trial Court under Rule 65 of the
1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court explained that “x x x
Though the provision appears unambiguous and unequivocal,
the Court has consistently held that the phrase ‘decision,
order, or ruling’ of constitutional commissions, x x x that may
be brought directly to the Supreme Court on certiorari is not
all-encompassing, and that it only relates to those rendered in
the commissions’ exercise of adjudicatory or quasi-judicial
powers. In the case of the COMELEC, this would limit the
provision’s coverage to the decisions, orders, or rulings issued
pursuant to its authority to be the sole judge of generally all
controversies and contests relating to the elections, returns,
and qualifications of elective offices.” (Querubin v. Commission
on Elections En Banc, G.R. No. 218787, December 8, 2015).
Thus, in a petition questioning the validity of certain
rules and regulations issued by the Commission on Elections
regulating the carriage of firearms during the election period,

Rule 64

PART II

—

SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS

Orders or Resolutions of the
— Review of Judgments and Final
Commission on Elections
the

and

186

Commission on Audit

the Court affirmed the rule that Rule 64 applies only to final
orders, rulings and decisions of the Commission En Banc in
the exercise of its adjudicatory and quasi-judicial powers and
not to those rulings or decisions issued under its rule-making
power. The appropriate remedy to question the validity of
the regulations issued by the Commission is a petition for
declaratory relief under Rule 63 (See Philippine Association of
Detective and Protective Agency Operators [PADPAO], Region
7 Chapter, Inc., G.R. No. 223505, October 3, 2017).
Remedy of the aggrieved party; application of Rule 65
1. A party aggrieved by the judgment, final order or
resolution of the Commission on Elections or the Commission
on Audit may file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 with
the Supreme Court (Sec. 2, Rule 64, Rules of Court).
2. If the mode of review is a petition for certiorari under
Rule 65, then this means that the judgments or final orders of
the constitutional commissions referred to in Rule 64 are not
reviewable by appeal. Under Sec. 1 of Rule 65, certiorari, as a
rule, is available only when there is no appeal, nor any other
plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
law. Hence, if appeal is available, certiorari is not the remedy.

Raising jurisdictional grounds

1. It bears stressing that the petitioner must anchor
the petition on jurisdictional grounds, i.e., that the commission
concerned acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction.

Hence, questions of facts, questions of law or mixed
questions of facts and law are not to be raised in the petition
under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, such questions amounting
to mere errors of judgments and, thus, are the proper subjects
of an appeal.

2. It is clear from the tenor of Rule 64, that the aggrieved
party cannot appeal to the Supreme Court by way of a Rule 45
petition for review on certiorari (otherwise known as appeal by

186

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

certiorari to the Supreme Court). Rule 45 is a mode of appeal
proscribed by Rule 64, said appeal being inconsistent with a
Rule 65 petition.
3. It was ruled that the office of the petition for
certiorari is not to correct simple errors of judgment; any resort

to the said petition under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, of
the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure is limited to the resolution
of jurisdictional issues. To raise the issue of the validity of a
prepayment scheme in assailing a COA resolution is to raise
an issue that is inherently a question of fact or an error of
judgment which is not within the ambit of a Rule 64 petition
(Reyna v. Commission on Audit, 642 SCRA 210, 225).
4. In a petition for certiorari under Rule 64 in relation
to Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the primordial issue to be
resolved is whether the respondent tribunal committed grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction
in issuing the assailed resolution. As a matter of policy, the
Court does not interfere with the resolutions of the COMELEC
unless it is shown that it had committed grave abuse of
discretion. In the absence of grave abuse of discretion, a Rule
64 petition will not prosper (Arnado v. COMELEC, G.R. No.
210164, August 18, 2015).

5. Decisions and resolutions of the Commission on
Audit may be reviewed and nullified only on the ground
of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction. Grave abuse of discretion exists when there is an
evasion of a positive duty or a virtual refusal to perform a duty
enjoined by law or to act in contemplation of law as when the
judgment rendered is not based on law and evidence but on
caprice, whim, and despotism (Maritime Industry Authority
v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 185812, January 13, 2015;
Daraga Press, Inc. u. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 201042,
June 16, 2015).

Rule 64 does not apply to the Civil Service Commission
1. The mode of review under Rule 64 pertains only
to the Commission on Audit (COA) and the Commission on

Rule 64

or

Elections (COMELEC) and excludes the Civil Service Com¬
mission (CSC), another constitutional commission governed
by Art. IX-B of the Philippine Constitution.
2. Rule 43 of the Rules of Court establishes a mode
of appeal from judgments or final orders of the Civil Service
Commission. Under Rule 43, an appeal from the judgment or
final order of the Civil Service Commission shall be taken to
the Court of Appeals whether the appeal involves questions
of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law (Sec. 3, Rule

43, Rules of Court) within 15 days from notice of the award,
judgment, final order or resolution (Sec. 4, Rule 43, Rules of
Court).
Findings of fact; not reviewable

1. The findings of facts of the Commission, when
supported by substantial evidence, shall be final and nonreviewable (Sec. 5, Rule 64, Rules of Court). This rule is
understandable when viewed from the nature of a petition for
certiorari which raises only issues of jurisdiction, not of facts.
2. It is well-settled that findings of fact of quasi-judicial
agencies, such as the COA, are generally accorded respect and
even finality by the Court, if supported by substantial evidence,
in recognition of their expertise on the specific matters under
their jurisdiction (Reyna v. Commission on Audit, 642 SCRA
210, 226-227, February 8, 2011).

When to file the petition; distinctions in the application of
Rule 65 to other tribunals, officers or persons
1. The petition for certiorari referred to in Rule 64
shall be filed within 30 days from notice of the judgment, final
order or resolution of the Commission on Elections and the
Commission on Audit sought to be reviewed (Sec. 3, Rule 64,
Rules of Court; The Law Firm of Laguesma Magsalin Consulta
and Gastardo u. Commission on Audit, G.R. No. 185544,
January 13, 2015).
2. While Rule 64 makes reference to the certiorari
under Rule 65, it is worthy to note that the period for filing the

petition for certiorari assailing the judgment of the Commission

that provided for under Rule 65. Under the latter rule (Sec.
4, Rule 65, Rules of Court), the petition for certiorari shall
be filed not later than 60 days from notice of the judgment,
order or resolution, or from notice of the denial of a motion for
reconsideration or motion for new trial, whether such motion
is required or not. Under Rule 64, the petition shall be filed

concerned, interrupts the period; hence, should the motion be
denied, the aggrieved party may file the petition within the
remaining period, which shall not be less than five days in
any event, reckoned from the notice of denial (Fortune Life

Insurance Company, Inc. v. Commission on Audit, G.R. No.
213525, January 27, 2015).
Motion for new trial or motion for reconsideration
1. Whether or not a party may file a motion for a new
trial or a motion for reconsideration of the judgment, final
order or resolution of the commission involved is dependent
upon the procedural rules of the commission concerned. If
such motions are allowed, the filing of either shall interrupt
the period for the filing of the petition for certiorari.

3. The period of 30 days clearly refers to a petition
directed against a judgment or a final order of the commission
concerned (Sec. 3, Rule 64, Rules of Court). It is opined that in
case a petition for certiorari directed against an interlocutory
order of the commission is allowed, the period in Rule 65
should apply.

2. If the motion is denied, the aggrieved party may

Laguesma Magsalin Consulta and Gastardo v. Commission
on Audit, G.R. No. 185544, January 13, 2015).

4. The Court made clear that while Rule 64 refers to the
same remedy of certiorari as the general rule in Rule 65, they
cannot be equated, as they provide for different reglementary

periods. Rule 65 provides for a period of 60 days from notice of
judgment sought to be assailed in the Supreme Court, while
Sec. 3 of Rule 64 expressly provides for only 30 days (Lokin v.
COMELEC, G.R. No. 193808, June 26, 2012).

The interruption of the period for the filing of the petition
assumes that the motion for reconsideration or new trial is
not pro forma. If the motion is pro forma, the period for filing
the petition is not interrupted.

Recall that a petition for certiorari, under the general rule
Sec.
in
4 of Rule 65, requires that the same be filed not later
than 60 days from notice of the judgment, order or resolution.
In case a motion for reconsideration or new trial is filed and
denied, the petition may, nevertheless, be filed not later than
60 days counted from the notice of the denial of the motion. In
effect this rule provides for a “fresh-period” rule.
The “fresh-period” rule used in Rule 65 however, does not
similarly apply to the timeliness of petitions under Rule 64
(Pates v. Commission on Elections, 591 SCRA 481, as cited in
Lokin v. COMELEC, G.R. No. 193808, June 26, 2012).
The petition is filed within 30 days from notice of the
judgment or final order or resolution sought to be reviewed.

Upon the filing of the petition, the petitioner shall pay
to the clerk of court the docket and other lawful fees. The
petitioner shall, in addition to the docket fees and lawful fees,
also deposit the amount of P500.00 for costs (Sec. 4, Rule 64,
Rules of Court).

Filing of petition does not stay execution

While the filing of a motion for reconsideration or a
motion for new trial shall interrupt the period for the filing of
the petition (Sec. 3, Rule 64, Rules of Court), the filing of the
petition itself, on the other hand, shall not have the effect of

staying the execution of the judgment, final order or resolution
of the Commission on Elections or of the Commission on Audit,
unless the Supreme Court shall direct otherwise (Sec. 8, Rule
64, Rules of Court).

In order to stay the execution of the judgment, Sec. 7
of Rule 65 may be availed of suppletorily. Under the said
provision, in order to interrupt the course of the principal case,
the petitioner should obtain a temporary restraining order or
a writ of preliminary injunction.
Form of the petition
The petition shall be verified and filed in 18 legible copies
(Sec. 5, Rule 64, Rules of Court).

Parties

The petitioner shall be the aggrieved party. The
respondents shall be the commission concerned and the person
or persons interested in sustaining the judgment, final order
or resolution (Sec. 5, Rule 64, Rules of Court).

Contents of the petition
The following constitute the basic contents of the petition
as required by Sec. 5 of Rule 64:
(a) The petition shall state the facts with certainty
and present clearly the issues involved;

(b) The petition shall set forth the grounds and
brief arguments relied upon for review;
(c)

The petition shall be accompanied by clearly
legible duplicate original or certified true copy of the
judgment, final order or resolution subject thereof,
together with certified true copies of such material
portions of the record and other documents relevant and
pertinent to the petition. The requisite number of copies
of the petition shall contain plain copies of all documents
attached to the original copy of the petition;

Among the requisites mentioned in Sec. 5 of Rule 64,
attention is specifically directed to the following:
(a) That the petition must be verified;

(b) That the petition shall state the specific
material dates showing that it was filed within the period
fixed. This is called the material data (date) rule; and
(c) That the petition shall contain a sworn certifi¬

1. Also called a “prerogative” writ because it is never

of Court).
No other pleading to be filed

2. The petition does not concern itself with errors of
judgment; its province is confined to issues of jurisdiction or
grave abuse of discretion (Almagro v. Philippine Airlines, Inc.,
G.R. No. 204803, September 12, 2018). The primordial task of
the court in a petition for certiorari is to ascertain whether the
court below acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to
excess or lack of jurisdiction in the exercise of its jurisdiction.
Grave abuse means such capricious and whimsical exercise of
judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. There is excess
of jurisdiction where the court or quasi-judicial body oversteps
its authority as declared by law. Hence, the jurisdiction of the
court in such petition is narrow in scope since it is limited only
to resolving errors of jurisdiction (See Lara's Gift and Decors,
Inc. v. PNB General Insurers Co., Inc., G.R. Nos. 230429-30,
January 24, 2018; For further readings, see Bureau of Internal
Revenue v. Acosta, G.R. No. 195320, April 23, 2018).

As a rule, no other pleading may be filed by any party.
The exception to this rule is when the filing of some other
pleading is required or allowed by the court (Sec. 7, Rule 64,
Rules of Court).
Oral arguments; memoranda; submission for decision

When the comments on the petition and the required
pleadings are filed or when the period to file the same has
expired, the case shall be deemed submitted for decision
except if the Court decides to set the case for oral argument
or requires the parties to submit memoranda (Sec. 9, Rule 64,
Rules of Court).

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

(Land Bank of the Phils, v. Court of Appeals, 409 SCRA
455, 479). Do not file certiorari if your purpose is to raise a
factual issue or to ask for a re-evaluation of the facts and the
evidence (PILTEL v. NTC, 410 SCRA 82, 88). To reiterate,
this is because the office of certiorari has been reduced to the
correction of defects of jurisdiction solely and cannot be legally
used for any other purpose (Miranda v. Sandiganbayan, G.R.
Nos. 144760-61, August 2, 2017). As long as the court acts
within its jurisdiction, any alleged errors in the exercise of its
jurisdiction will amount to nothing more than mere errors of
judgment, correctible by appeal, not by a petition for certiorari
(See Lara's Gift and Decors, Inc. v. PNB General Insurers Co.
Inc., G.R. Nos. 230429-30, January 24, 2018).
Certiorari under Rule 65; not a mode of appeal (Bar 1991)

1. A petition for certiorari under Rule 65, although
denominated as “special,” is an original action the way an
ordinary civil action is. Being an original action, it is, therefore,
not a mode of appeal even if it is filed with a higher court or
tribunal.

For reasons explained in another part of this material,
it is necessary to emphasize that the certiorari under Rule
65 is distinct from the certiorari under Rule 45. It is the
certiorari under Rule 45 which is declared by the Rules to be
a mode of appeal. Traditionally called a “petition for review
on certiorari," a petition under Rule 45 is also described by
the Rules as an “appeal by certiorari" to the Supreme Court.
On the other hand, the petition filed under Rule 65 is called a
“petition for certiorari.”
2. An appeal raises the errors of judgment of a court,
tribunal or officer and normally dwells on the factual or legal
merits of the case. This is not so when one avails of a petition
for certiorari which is not designed to review every error of a
lower court or tribunal. The petition is narrow in scope and
seeks to correct only jurisdictional errors often arising out of a
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction (See
Leynes v. Former Tenth Division of the Court of Appeals, 640

— SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
— Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

PART U
Rule 65

196

SCRA 25, 39-41; For related readings, see Philippine Electric
Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 168612, December
10, 2014).
If the error amounts to grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, the proper remedy
would indeed be a petition for certiorari under Rule 65.
However, if the allegedly erroneous findings of fact constitute
only a mistake of judgment, the proper remedy is an appeal
(Ong v. Bognalbal, 501 SCRA 490, 500-502). A petition for
certiorari is not designed to question the wisdom or legal
soundness of the decision or order but only the jurisdictional
errors of the court.

3. The remedies of appeal and certiorari are considered
as mutually exclusive and not alternative or successive.
Certiorari cannot even be a substitute for a lost appeal (See
Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank v. Court of
Appeals, 334 SCRA 305, 316-317; Orlina v. Ventura, G.R. No.
227033, December 3, 2018). Certiorari cannot co-exist with
an appeal or any other adequate remedy. If an appeal, like
a petition for review is available, the remedy is appeal, not
certiorari as a special civil action (See Portillo v. Rudolf Lietz,
Inc., G.R. No. 196539, October 10, 2012). Earlier, the Court
also held that certiorari under Rule 65 is proper only if there
is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the
ordinary course of law (Sonic Steel Industries, Inc. v. Court of
Appeals, 626 SCRA 142, 147-148).

The reason for the above rule can be found in Rule
65 itself. One of the basic requirements before availing of
certiorari and which is clearly spelled out under Sec. 1 of Rule
65 is that, “there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy, and
adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law x x x.” It would
then be of great help to remember the basic general rule that
when appeal is available as a remedy, certiorari has no place.
The Court has consistently held that one of the requisites
of certiorari is that there be no available appeal or any plain,
speedy and adequate remedy. Where an appeal is available,
certiorari will not prosper, even if the ground invoked is grave

CIVIL PROCEDURE

abuse of discretion (Catindig v. Vda. de Meneses, 641 SCRA
350, 363; Philippine Electric Corporation v. Court of Appeals,
G.R. No. 168612, December 10, 2014). Current jurisprudence
confirms the above principle and holds that even if one of
the errors assigned in the appeal is a jurisdictional error on
the part of the court rendering the judgment appealed from,
a timely appeal is the remedy, as a rule, to obtain reversal
or modification of the judgment (For further readings, see Le
Soleil International Logistics v. Sanchez, G.R. No. 199384,
September 9, 2015). It is not, therefore, correct to assume that
whenever a court commits a grave abuse of discretion, the
automatic mode of review would be a petition for certiorari.
Grave abuse of discretion, after all, is not the only element of
certiorari. There is another element such as the unavailability
of appeal or any other plan, speedy and adequate remedy in
the ordinary course of law.

Illustration: Mr. Pedro Reyes, in an action for rescission of
a contract filed against Mr. Donato Cruz in the RTC, received
an adverse judgment. After his motion for reconsideration
of the judgment was denied, he filed a petition for certiorari
with the CA alleging that the judgment was rendered under
circumstances of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack
of jurisdiction. Is the remedy availed of by Mr. Pedro Reyes
appropriate? The remedy is not appropriate. He should have
appealed from the judgment of the RTC. Where appeal is
available, a petition for certiorari is not available even if the
ground invoked is grave abuse of discretion. Jurisprudence is
replete with the pronouncement that where appeal is available
to the aggrieved party, the special civil action of certiorari will
not be entertained
remedies of appeal and certiorari are
mutually exclusive, not alternative or successive. The proper
remedy to obtain a reversal of judgment on the merits, final
order or resolution is appeal. This holds true even if the error
ascribed to the court rendering the judgment is its lack of
jurisdiction over the subject matter, or the exercise of power
in excess thereof, or grave abuse of discretion in the findings
of fact or of law set out in the decision, order or resolution.
The existence and availability of the right of appeal prohibits

197

the resort to certiorari because one of the requirements for the
latter remedy is the unavailability of appeal (See also Cuevas
v. Macatangay, G.R. No. 208506, February 22, 2017).

One early case illustrates an erroneous availment of a
petition for certiorari. In Magtoto v. Court of Appeals, G.R.
No. 175792, November 21, 2012, the plaintiff filed before the
Regional Trial Court (RTC) a complaint for specific performance
with damages and prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction
against the defendants. From the adverse judgment of the
Regional Trial Court, the defendants promptly appealed to the
Court of Appeals. The appeal, however, was dismissed by the
Court of Appeals thereby affirming the findings of the lower
court. A subsequent motion for reconsideration was, likewise,
denied by the same court. Such being the case, the defendants
filed before the Supreme Court a petition for certiorari under
Rule 65.

On a procedural ground, the petition was dismissed by
the Supreme Court for being the wrong remedy because the
defendant should have appealed the judgment of the Court
of Appeals to the Supreme Court, instead of filing before it a
petition under Rule 65. Declared the Court:

“At the outset, it must be pointed out that petitioners’
resort to a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65 of the
Rules of Court is inappropriate. Petitioners’ remedy from
the adverse Decision of the CA lies in Rule 45 which is a
Petition for Review on Certiorari x x x.”

A case much more recent than Magtoto found the Court
holding that to challenge the decision of the Court of Appeals,
the remedy is to file a petition for review on certiorari under
Rule 45. A petition under Rule 65 is a remedy of last resort,
available only when there is no appeal or any other plain,
speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law
(Navarez u. Abrogar III, G.R. No. 191641, September 2, 2015).

—

l

Even if the settled rule is that certiorari is not allowed
as a remedy when appeal is available, jurisprudence carved
out certain exceptions to the rule. In the following situations,

CIVIL PROCEDURE

198

Rule 65

VOLUME II

the Court allowed certiorari despite the availability of appeal:
(a) when it is necessary to prevent irreparable damage and
injury to a party; (b) where the trial judge capriciously and
whimsically exercised his judgment; (c) where there may be a
danger of failure of justice; (d) where an appeal would be slow,
inadequate, and insufficient; (e) where the issue is one purely
of law; (f) where public interest is involved; and (g) in case of
urgency (Municipality of Cordova v. Pathfinder Development
Corporation, G.R. No. 205544, June 29, 2016; Martinez v.
Buen, G.R. No. 187342, April 5, 2017; For further readings,
see Orlina v. Ventura, G.R. No. 227033, December 3, 2018).
A more recent case adds to the above exceptions.
Accordingly, recourse to a petition for certiorari, despite the
availability of appeal, may be allowed under the following
exceptions: (a) when public welfare and the advancement of
public policy dictate; (b) when the broader interest of justice
so requires; (c) when the writs issued are null and void; or (d)
when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise
of judicial authority (Punongbayan-Visitacion u. People, G.R.
No. 194214, January 10, 2018; Citations of the Court, omitted;

Career Executive Service Board v. Civil Service Commission,
G.R. No. 196890, January 11, 2018; For further readings, see
Orlina v. Ventura, G.R. No. 227033, December 3, 2018).
Certiorari is an original and independent action

Certiorari, as a special civil action, is an original
action invoking the original jurisdiction of a court to annul
or modify the proceedings of a tribunal, board or officer
exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions. It is an original
and independent action that is not part of the trial or the
proceedings on the complaint filed before the trial court (Siok
Ping Tang v. Subic Bay Distribution, Inc., 638 SCRA 457, 468;
See also BF Citiland Corporation v. Otake, 626 SCRA 220,
228).
1.

2. Since certiorari as a special civil action is an original
action, the decision rendered on such action is appealable,
and not reviewable by another petition for certiorari. In other

— Prohibition and Mandamus

199

words, when a petition for certiorari is filed and adjudicated
upon, the decision of the court on the petition is to be treated
as a judgment and, hence, like any other judgment in an
ordinary civil action, is appealable. It cannot be assailed by
another petition for certiorari.

Illustration: The Regional Trial Court dismissed a
petition for certiorari filed with it by Mr. XX against an order
of the Municipal Trial Court. The Regional Trial Court ruled
that the Municipal Trial Court did not commit a grave abuse
of discretion in issuing the assailed order. May the dismissal
of the petition be reviewed through a petition for certiorari
filed with the Court of Appeals? The dismissal may not be
assailed through a petition for certiorari. The dismissal, being
a judgment, should be the subject of an appeal before the
Court of Appeals.
Certiorari distinguished from appeal in general

In sum, the following are the well-recognized distinctions
between certiorari and an appeal:
A petition for certiorari is a remedy designed
for the correction of errors of jurisdiction, not errors of
judgment. Where the error is not one of jurisdiction, but
of an error of law or fact, which is a mistake or an error of
judgment, appeal is the remedy.
1.

2. A petition for certiorari is an original and
independent action that is not part of the trial that
had resulted in the rendition of the judgment or order
complained of. An appeal is merely a continuation of the
original suit.
3. Over a petition for certiorari, the higher court
uses its original jurisdiction in accordance with its power
of control and supervision over the proceedings of lower
courts. Over an appeal, the higher court exercises its
appellate jurisdiction and power of review.
4. The parties to a petition for certiorari include
the lower court or quasi-judicial agency issuing the

200

assailed order. The parties to an appeal are the original
parties to the action.
5. A petition for certiorari may be directed against
an interlocutory order of the lower court, subject to the
prohibitions under the A.M. No. 19-10-20-SC or the 2019
Amendments to the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure. An
appeal is directed to judgments and final orders or to
those that the Rules of Court declares as appealable.
6. A petition for certiorari should be filed not
later than 60 days from the notice of judgment, order,
or resolution. If a motion for new trial or motion for
reconsideration was timely filed, the period shall be
counted from the denial of the motion.
Ordinary appeals should be filed within 15 days
from the notice of judgment or final order appealed from.
Where a record on appeal is required, the appellant must
file a notice of appeal and a record on appeal within 30
days from the said notice of judgment or final order. A
petition for review should be filed and served within 15
days from the notice of denial of the decision, or of the
petitioner’s timely filed motion for new trial or motion for
reconsideration. In an appeal by certiorari, the petition
should be filed also within 15 days from the notice of
judgment or final order, or of the denial of the petitioner’s

motion for new trial or motion for reconsideration.
7. A petition for certiorari generally requires a
motion for reconsideration prior to the filing of the petition
in order to afford the tribunal an opportunity to correct
the alleged errors. Note also that this motion is a plain
and adequate remedy expressly available under the law.
Such motion is not required before appealing a judgment
or final order (The above distinctions are restatements
of the pronouncements of the Court in Leynes v. Former
Tenth Division of the Court of Appeals, 640 SCRA 25, 3941).

201

Certiorari not a substitute for a lost appeal (Bar 1991)
1. The filing of a petition for certiorari as a substitute
for a lost appeal is erroneous. Certiorari is not and cannot be
made a substitute for an appeal where the latter remedy is
available but was lost through fault or negligence. “The remedy
to obtain reversal or modification of the judgment on the merits
x x x is appeal. This holds true even if the error ascribed to the
court rendering the judgment is its lack of jurisdiction over
the subject matter, or the exercise of power in excess thereof,
or grave abuse of discretion in the findings of fact or of law set
out in the decision. The existence and availability of the right
of appeal prohibits the resort to certiorari because one of the
requirements for the latter remedy is that there should be no
appear (Bugarin v. Palisoc, 476 SCRA 587, 595-596).
It was also similarly held that a petitioner, who argues
that an appeal will not promptly relieve him of the injurious
effects of the judgment, should establish facts to show why and
how the appeal is not speedy or adequate. Such party cannot
rightfully allege that an appeal is not speedy and adequate
in an attempt to extricate himself from the effects of his own
negligence in not perfecting a timely appeal. A court does not
err in dismissing a petition for certiorari that is availed of
merely as a substitute for a lost appeal (V.C. Ponce Company,
Inc. v. Municipality of Paranaque, G.R. No. 178431, November
12, 2012; See also Saint Mary Crusade to Alleviate Poverty of
Brethren Foundation, Inc. v. Riel, G.R. No. 176508, January
12, 2015).

2.

The above pronouncements clearly hold that

certiorari cannot be allowed when a party fails to appeal a
judgment despite the availability of that remedy, certiorari

not being a substitute for a lost appeal. Thus, if the complaint
is dismissed with prejudice through a motion to dismiss,
the ordinary remedy of the plaintiff is to appeal, not file a
petition for certiorari. Appeal is the remedy because an order
dismissing a complaint with prejudice is final in character.
If the period to appeal lapses without an appeal having been
filed through a party’s negligence, certiorari cannot take the
place of a lost appeal.

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Illustration: Mr. PP files an action for damages
against Mr. DD who promptly files a motion to dismiss
on the ground of bar by a prior judgment. Assume that
the court dismisses the complaint on the ground invoked
by Mr. DD. Since a dismissal on the ground of bar by a
prior judgment bars the refiling of the same claim, the
dismissal is one with prejudice. A dismissal of an action
with prejudice is appealable. Also, under Sec. 13 of Rule
15 of the Rules of Court, as amended, the dismissal is
subject to the right of appeal. If the period for appeal
lapses without an appeal having been filed by Mr. PP,
may he avail instead of a petition for certiorari? He
cannot. The reason is plain and simple. Certiorari is not
a substitute for a lost appeal.
When certiorari is available despite the loss of appeal
While ordinarily, certiorari is not available when the
period for appeal has lapsed, certiorari may still be invoked
when appeal is lost without the appellant’s negligence. In
a case like this, the Court allows a petition for certiorari in
lieu of an appeal. Other exceptions are: (a) when the public
welfare and the advancement of public policy dictate; (b) when
the broader interests of justice so require; (c) when the writs
issued are null and void; and (d) when the questioned order
amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority (Chua
v. Court of Appeals, 344 SCRA 136, 147-148 citing Crisostomo
v. Endencia, 66 Phil. 1; Marcelo v. De Guzman, 114 SCRA
657, 663; and Tirana u. Nanawa, 21 SCRA 395, 400; Sunbeam
Convenience Foods, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 181 SCRA 443,
449; Acain v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 155 SCRA 100,
109; Philippine Electric Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R.
No. 168612, December 10, 2014).
Specific distinctions between certiorari under Rule 45 and
certiorari under Rule 65 (Bar 1991, 1998, 1999)

As one goes deeper into the Rules, one would
encounter certain principles as: “An appeal to the Supreme
Court may be taken only by a petition for review on certiorari,
except x x x” (Sec. 3, Rule 56, Rules of Court). Be reminded
1.

203

that this provision refers to the certiorari under Rule 45, not
the certiorari under Rule 65.

Under the current rules, a party desiring to appeal by
certiorari from a judgment, final order or resolution of the
Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan, Court of Tax Appeals,
Regional Trial Court or other courts whenever authorized by
law, may file a verified petition for review on certiorari with

I

the Supreme Court and which shall raise only questions of law
(Sec. 1, Rule 45, Rules of Court). (Bar 2005) Again, this is not
the certiorari contemplated under Rule 65, but the certiorari
under Rule 45.

2. There are well-settled distinctions between certiorari
wider Rule 45 and certiorari under Rule 65:

u

(a) Certiorari, under Rule 45, is a mode of appeal
(Sec. 2(c), Rule 41, Rules of Court); while certiorari under
Rule 65 is a special civil action. The latter is an original
and independent action, not a mode of appeal.
(b) Certiorari under Rule 45 is but a continuation
of the appellate process over the original case. Certiorari
under Rule 65 is not a part of the appellate process
but an original action (Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries
Association v. Nicolas, 567 SCRA 540, 550).

(c) Because certiorari under Rule 45 is a mode of
appeal, it seeks to review final judgments or final orders;
while certiorari under Rule 65 is usually directed against
an interlocutory order or matters where no appeal may be
taken from (Sec. 1, Rule 41, Rules of Court). The purpose
of a Rule 65 petition is to annul the proceedings of a
lower tribunal and prevent an unlawful and oppressive
exercise of legal authority (Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries
Association u. Nicolas, 567 SCRA 540, 550).

(d) Certiorari under Rule 45, as a rule, raises only
questions of law. Questions of fact are not entertained
(Heirs of Spouses Liwagon and Dumalagan v. Heirs of
Spouses Liwagon, G.R. No. 193117, November 26, 2014;

Management and Development Corporation, G.R. No.
214057, October 19, 2015). The resolution of factual
issues is the function of the lower courts whose findings
on these matters are received with respect and are, as
a rule, binding on the Supreme Court (China Banking
Corporation v. QBRO Fishing Enterprises, Inc., 666
SCRA 599, 605, February 22, 2012; For related readings,
see Belmonte v. Office of the Deputy Ombudsman, G.R.
No. 197665, January 13, 2016).
Certiorari under Rule 65 raises questions of
jurisdiction because a tribunal, board or officer exercising
judicial or quasi-judicial functions has acted without
jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction
(Sec. 1, Rule 65, Rules of Court; Aggabao v. COMELEC,
449 SCRA 400, 403-404; See also Saint Mary Crusade
to Alleviate Poverty of Brethren Foundation, Inc. v. Riel,
G.R. No. 176508, January 12, 2015).
(e) An appeal by certiorari under Rule 45 is filed
within 15 days from notice of judgment or final order
appealed from (Sec. 2, Rule 45, Rules of Court), while a
petition for certiorari under Rule 65 is filed not later than
60 days from notice of judgment, order or resolution sought

to be assailed, and in case a motion for reconsideration or
new trial is timely filed, whether such motion is required
or not, the 60- day period is counted from notice of denial
of said motion (Sec. 4, Rule 65, Rules of Court; A.M. No.
00-2-03 amending Sec. 4 of Rule 65 effective September 1,
2000; Systems Factors Corporation v. NLRC, 346 SCRA
149, 152).
(f) Certiorari under Rule 45 does not require a
prior motion for reconsideration while certiorari under
Rule 65 requires as a general rule, a prior motion for
reconsideration (Progressive Development Corporation v.
Court of Appeals, 301 SCRA 637, 647).

(g) Unless a rule provides for the contrary, certiorari
under Rule 45 stays the judgment appealed from;
certiorari under Rule 65 does not stay the judgment or
order subject of the petition unless enjoined or restrained
(Sec. 7, Rule 65, Rules of Court).
(h) In certiorari under Rule 45, the parties are the
original parties with the appealing party as the petitioner
and the adverse party as respondent without impleading
the lower court or its judge (Sec. 4[a], Rule 45, Rules of
Court), while in certiorari under Rule 65, the tribunal,
board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial
functions is impleaded as respondent (Sec. 5, Rule 65,
Rules of Court; Yasuda v. Court of Appeals, 330 SCRA
385, 394-395).

(i) Certiorari, as a special civil action, is filed with
the Regional Trial Court (Sec. 21(1], B.P. 129 as amended),
Court of Appeals (Sec. 9[1], B.P. 129 as amended),
Supreme Court (Sec. 5(1], Art. VIII, Constitution of the
Philippines) or Sandiganbayan; whereas certiorari, as
a mode of appeal, is filed only with the Supreme Court
(Sec. 1, Rule 45, Rules of Court).

Essential requisites for a petition for certiorari
A petition for certiorari requires the concurrence of the
following:
(a) The petition is directed against a tribunal, board
or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions.

(b) Such tribunal, board or officer has acted
without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.
(c) There is neither appeal nor any plain, speedy
remedy in the ordinary course of law for
adequate
and
the purpose of annulling or modifying the proceeding.
There must be capricious, arbitrary and whimsical
exercise of power for it to prosper (Sec. 1, Rule 65, Rules

223, 236; Milwaukee Industries Corporation v. Court of
Tax Appeals, 636 SCRA 70, 76; For further readings, see

Secretary of Finance, G.R. No. 200670, July 6, 2015).
First element; respondent must exercise judicial or quasi¬
judicial functions
1. In determining the propriety of a petition for
certiorari, the first inquiry is: Is the respondent exercising a
judicial or quasi-judicial function? This inquiry has to be made
because the rule clearly requires that a petition for certiorari
is directed against a “tribunal, board or officer exercising
judicial or quasi-judicial functions” (Sec. 1, Rule 65, Rules of
Court). Thus, if the board, tribunal or officer does not exercise
either a judicial or quasi-judicial function, certiorari will not
lie against its acts.
A respondent is said to be exercising judicial function
where he has the power to determine what the law is and
what the legal rights of the parties are, and then undertakes
to determine these questions and adjudicate upon the rights
of the parties. Quasi-judicial function is a term which applies
to the action, discretion, etc., of public administrative officers
or bodies, which are required to investigate facts or ascertain
the existence of facts, hold hearings, and draw conclusions
from them as a basis for their official action and to exercise
discretion of a judicial nature. Ministerial function is one
which an officer or tribunal performs in the context of a given
set of facts, in a prescribed manner and without regard to the
exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or impropriety
of the act done (See Aquino v. Municipality of Malay, G.R. No.
211356, September 29, 2014).

Otherwise stated, a quasi-judicial act refers to the acts of
public administrative officers or bodies required to investigate
facts or ascertain the existence of facts, hold hearings, and

—

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 65 Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

—

207

draw conclusions from them, as a basis for their official actions,
and to exercise discretion of a judicial nature (Lupangco
v. Court of Appeals, 160 SCRA 848, 856). Specifically, the
tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial
function must be clothed with power and authority to pass
judgment or render a decision on the controversy construing
and applying the laws to that end. Simply stated, where the
function is merely investigative and recommendatory with
no power to pronounce judgment on the controversy, the
designation as investigator, therefore, does not involve the
exercise of judicial or quasi-judicial power. Hence, the act/s
may not be challenged in a petition for certiorari under Rule
65 (Doran v. Luczon, 503 SCRA 106, 112).

2. The powers of an administrative body are classified
into two fundamental powers: quasi-legislative and quasijudicial. Quasi-legislative power, otherwise known as
the power of subordinate legislation, has been defined
as the authority delegated by the lawmaking body to the
administrative body to adopt rules and regulations intended
to carry out the provisions of law and implement legislative
policy. “[A] legislative rule is in the nature of subordinate
legislation, designed to implement a primary legislation
by providing the details thereof.” The exercise by the
administrative body of its quasi-legislative power through the
promulgation of regulations of general application does not,
as a rule, require notice and hearing. The only exception being
where the Legislature itself requires it and mandates that the
regulation shall be based on certain facts as determined at an
appropriate investigation.

Quasi-judicial power, on the other hand, is known as the
power of the administrative agency to determine questions of
fact to which the legislative policy is to apply, in accordance
with the standards laid down by the law itself. As it involves the
exercise of discretion in determining the rights and liabilities
of the parties, the proper exercise of quasi-judicial power
requires the concurrence of two elements: one, jurisdiction
which must be acquired by the administrative body and two,

208

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)
VOLUME II

the observance of the requirements of due process, that is, the
right to notice and hearing.

In a particular case, the argument that the certification
proceedings were conducted by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in the exercise of its “regulatory
powers” and, therefore, beyond judicial review, the Court held
that it has the power to review all acts and decisions where
there is a commission of grave abuse of discretion. No less
than the Constitution decrees that the Court must exercise
its duty to ensure that no grave abuse of discretion amounting
to lack or excess of jurisdiction is committed by any branch
or instrumentality of the Government. Such is committed
when there is a violation of the constitutional mandate that
“no person is deprived of life, liberty, and property without
due process of law.” The Court held that its power cannot
be curtailed by the FDA’s invocation of its regulatory power
(Alliance for the Family Foundation, Philippines, Inc. (ALFI)
and Atty. Maria Concepcion S. Noche, et al. v. Hon. Janette L.

Garin, et al. /Maria Concepcion S. Noche, et al. v. Hon. Janette
L. Garin, et al., G.R. No. 217872 /G.R. No. 221866, April 26,

it is the former that prevails (Land Bank of the Philippines
v. Court of Appeals, et al., G.R. No. 118712, October 6, 1995;
Department of Agrarian Reform v. Court of Appeals, et al.,
G.R. No. 118745, October 6, 1995).
4. Jurisprudence confirms that certiorari does not
lie against a respondent whose acts are neither judicial nor
(

)

2017).

3. The conclusive effect of administrative construction
is not absolute. Action of an administrative agency may be
disturbed or set aside by the judicial department if there is
an error of law, a grave abuse of power or lack of jurisdiction
or grave abuse of discretion clearly conflicting with either the
letter or the spirit of a legislative enactment. In this regard,
it must be stressed that the function of promulgating rules
and regulations may be legitimately exercised only for the
purpose of carrying the provisions of the law into effect.
The power of administrative agencies is thus confined to
implementing the law or putting it into effect. Corollary to
this is that administrative regulations cannot extend the law
and amend a legislative enactment, for settled is the rule
that administrative regulations must be in harmony with
the provisions of the law. And in case there is a discrepancy
between the basic law and an implementing rule or regulation,

209

,

quasi-judicial.
Thus, a petition for certiorari challenging the validity
of The Human Security Act of 2007 filed against the Anti¬
Terrorism Council and its members, who are government
officials who do not exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions,
cannot be given due course (Southern Hemisphere Engagement
Network, Inc. v. Anti-Terrorism Council, 632 SCRA 146, 166).
A petition for certiorari was also denied in one case
involving the issuance of a Wage Order. The Court held that in
the issuance of the assailed Wage Order, respondent Regional
Tripartite Wage Productivity Board (RTWPB) did not act in
any judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial capacity. It was in
the nature of subordinate legislation, promulgated by it in the
exercise of delegated power under R.A. 6727. It was issued
in the exercise of quasi-legislative power. Quasi-legislative or
rule- making power is exercised by administrative agencies
through the promulgation of rules and regulations within
the confines of the granting statute and the doctrine of non¬
delegation of certain powers flowing from the separation of the
great branches of the government (Metropolitan Bank & Trust
Company, Inc. v. National Wages Productivity Commission,
514 SCRA 346, 357-358; For further readings, see Galicto v.
Aquino HI, 667 SCRA 150, 167, February 28, 2012).

A case, more recent than the above, aptly illustrates the
above rule. In one case, Pres. Aquino was made respondent in
a petition for certiorari for issuing E.O. 7, entitled “Directing
the Rationalization of the Compensation and Position
Classification System in the [GOCCs] and [GFIs], and for Other
Purposes." The E.O. 7 provided for the guiding principles and
framework to establish a fixed compensation and position
classification system for government-owned and controlled

210

VOLUME II

corporations (GOCCs) and government financial institutions
(GFIs). Executive Order No. 7 ordered (1) a moratorium on
the increases in the salaries and other forms of compensation,
except salary adjustments under E.O. 8011 and E.O. 900, of
all GOCC and GFI employees for an indefinite period to be
set by the President, and (2) a suspension of all allowances,
bonuses and incentives of members of the Board of Directors/
Trustees until December 31, 2010.

The petitioner claimed that as a PhilHealth employee,
he was affected by the implementation of E.O. 7, which was
issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or
excess of jurisdiction and that E.O. 7 is unconstitutional for
having been issued beyond the powers of the President and
for being in breach of existing laws. The petitioner filed with
the Supreme Court a Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition
with Application for Writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or
Temporary Restraining Order seeking to nullify and enjoin
the implementation of E.O. 7.
The Supreme Court dismissed the petition for both “its
patent formal and procedural infirmities” aside from its having
been mooted by subsequent events. On the procedural aspect,
the Court ruled that certiorari was not the proper remedy. The
Court explained that “(U]nder the Rules of Court, petitions for
Certiorari and Prohibition are availed of to question judicial,
quasi-judicial and mandatory acts. Since the issuance of
an E.O. is not judicial, quasi-judicial or a mandatory act, a
petition for certiorari and prohibition is an incorrect remedy;
instead a petition for declaratory relief under Rule 63 of the
Rules of Court, filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC), is
the proper recourse to assail the validity of EO 7 x x x” (Galicto
v. Aquino III, 667 SCRA 150, 165, February 28, 2012).
5. A committee on the ratings of students for honor
whose actions in proclaiming the honor students of a
graduating class are questioned is not the “tribunal, board or
officer” against whom an action may lie under Sec. 1 of Rule 65
(Santiago v. Bautista, 32 SCRA 188, 198). It is not conferred
by law a judicial or a quasi-judicial function.

Rule 66 Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

6. In another case, a petition for certiorari was dis¬
missed by the Court. It held that the petitioner availed of the
wrong remedy when she filed a petition for certiorari to assail
a Show Cause Order issued by the respondents, the Chairman
of the Members of the Commission on Human Rights. The
Court found that the respondents, when they referred the case
to the Ombudsman, did not engage in judicial or quasi-judicial
functions; they did not adjudicate the rights and obligations
of the contending parties but simply undertook to initiate the
investigation of the allegations against the petitioner. The
inquiry was not a quasi-judicial proceeding, where offenses
were charged, parties were heard and penalties were imposed.
It was at most, an exercise of fact-finding investigation,
which is entirely distinct and different from the concept of
adjudication (Quisumbing v. Rosales, G.R. No. 209283, March
11, 2015).

7. Certiorari does not, likewise, he to set aside an
executive order issued, pursuant to the executive functions,
by a city mayor who does not exercise judicial or quasijudicial functions. The enactment by the City Mayor of the
assailed executive order was done not in the exercise of either
a judicial or quasi-judicial function (Liga ng mga Barangay v.
City Mayor of Manila, 420 SCRA 562; and also cited in Galicto
v. Aquino III, 667 SCRA 150, 166, February 28, 2012).

8. Certiorari does not also apply against a city council
that enacts an ordinance for the payment of garbage fees.
In passing the ordinance, the city council did not act in any
judicial or quasi-judicial capacity nor arrogated itself any
judicial or quasi-judicial prerogatives.

A respondent is said to be exercising judicial function
where he has the power to determine what the law is and
what the legal rights of the parties are, and then undertakes
to determine these questions and adjudicate upon the rights
of the parties. Quasi-judicial function, on the other hand, is
“a term which applies to the actions, discretion, etc., of public
required to investigate
administrative officers or bodies
facts,
hold hearings, and
of
existence
the
facts or ascertain

...

VOLUME II

draw conclusions from them as a basis for their official action
and to exercise discretion of a judicial nature” (Ferrer v.
Bautista, G.R. No. 210551, June 30, 2015).
9. Not every executive order issued by an executive
official should, however, be construed as in connection with the
exercise of an executive function for it should be the nature of
the act, not the nature of the office which determines whether
or not an act is executive or quasi-judicial.
In one case, the Court of Appeals denied a petition for
certiorari directed against the executive order of the mayor
ordering the demolition of certain structures that were
illegally constructed. The Court of Appeals premised the
dismissal on the character of the respondent mayor’s order
not being a consequence of the exercise of either a judicial or
quasi-judicial function, but one issued in the exercise of an
executive function. The Supreme Court reversed and found
the petition to be in order. Ruled the Court:

“The CA fell into a trap when it ruled that a mayor,
an officer from the executive department, exercises an
executive function whenever he issues an Executive
Order. This is too presumptive for it is the nature of the
act to be performed, rather than of the office, board, or
body which performs it, that determines whether or not
a particular act is a discharge of judicial or quasi-judicial
functions x x x.

In the case at bench, the assailed EO 10 was issued
upon the respondent mayor’s finding that Boracay West
Cove’s construction, expansion, and operation of its hotel
in Malay, Aklan is illegal. Such a finding of illegality
required the respondent mayor’s exercise of quasi-judicial
functions, against which the special writ of certiorari may
lie” (Aquino v. Municipality of Malay, G.R. No. 211356,
September 29, 2014).

10. The act of issuing a revenue regulation by the
Secretary of Finance based on the National Internal Revenue
Code is one quasi-legislative in nature which is outside the
scope of a petition for certiorari. Secondly, while this case is

——

Rule 65 Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

213

styled as a petition for certiorari, there is, however, no denying
the fact that, in essence, it seeks the declaration by this Court
of the unconstitutionality and illegality of the questioned rule,
thus partaking the nature, in reality, of one for declaratory
relief over which the Court has only appellate, not original,
jurisdiction (Clark Investors and Locators Association, Inc. v.
Secretary of Finance, G.R. No. 200670, July 6, 2015).
11. A more recent pronouncement was made by the
Court in a petition for certiorari and prohibition under Rule
65 of the Rules of Court filed by the officers and members
of the Philippine Public Health Association, Inc. (PPHAI),
assailing the validity of certain joint circulars of the
Department of Budget and Management (DBM), Department

of Health (DOH), and Civil Service Commission (CSC). The
joint circulars were issued to implement R.A. 7305, otherwise
known as The Magna Carta of Public Health Workers. The
petition was declared unmeritorious, since, among others,
the respondents were found not to have acted in any judicial,
quasi-judicial, or ministerial capacity in their issuance of
the assailed joint circulars. In issuing and implementing
the subject circulars, respondents were not called upon to
adjudicate the rights of contending parties to exercise, in any
manner, discretion of a judicial nature. The issuance and
enforcement by the Secretaries of the DBM, CSC and DOH
of the questioned joint circulars were done in the exercise of
their quasi-legislative and administrative functions. It was
in the nature of subordinate legislation, promulgated by
them in their exercise of delegated power. Quasi-legislative
power is exercised by administrative agencies through the
promulgation of rules and regulations within the confines of
the granting statute and the doctrine non -delegation of powers
from the separation of the branches of the government. Their
acts were, therefore, not proper subjects of certiorari and
prohibition (Cawad u. Abad, G.R. No. 207145, July 28, 2015).

Expanded scope of certiorari

While Rule 65 specifically requires that the respondent be
a tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial

functions, recent pronouncements of the Court have extended
the reach of the petition to functions or acts that are neither
judicial nor quasi-judicial. Such pronouncements have likewise
categorically broadened the purpose of a petition for certiorari
to include raising constitutional issues and reviewing and/or
nullifying the acts of legislative and executive officials.
(a) In Araullo v. Aquino III, G.R. No. 209287, July 1,

2014.& case assailing the constitutionality of the Disbursement
Acceleration Program (DAP) and other issuances of the
Department of Budget and Management, the Court ruled:
“With respect to the Court, however, the remedies of

certiorari and prohibition are necessarily broader in scope
and reach, and the writ of certiorari or prohibition may
be issued to correct errors of jurisdiction committed not
only by a tribunal, corporation, board or officer exercising
judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions but also
to set right, undo and restrain any act of grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction by
any branch or instrumentality of the Government, even
if the latter does not exercise judicial, quasi-judicial
or ministerial functions. This application is expressly
authorized by the text of the second paragraph of Section
1.” (Italics supplied)

q

The provision invoked by the Court to justify the broad
application of certiorari even to acts which are neither judicial
nor quasi-judicial is the second paragraph of Sec. 1 of Art. VIII
of the Philippine Constitution defining judicial power and
which includes the duty “x x x to determine whether or not
there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack
of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of
the Government.” Thus, declared the Court, “the petitions for
certiorari and prohibition are appropriate remedies to raise
constitutional issues and to review and/or prohibit or nullify
the acts of legislative and executive officials.”
(b) In another case involving a petition for certiorari
against the Judicial and Bar Council, the Court declared that
“it is clear that the JBC does not fall within the scope of a

216

tribunal, board, or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial
functions. In the process of selecting and screening applicants,
the JBC neither acted in any judicial or quasi-judicial capacity
nor assumed unto itself any performance of judicial or quasijudicial prerogative. However, since the formulation of
guidelines and criteria, including the policy that the petitioner
now assails, is necessary and incidental to the exercise of the
JBC’s constitutional mandate, a determination must be made
on whether the JBC has acted with grave abuse of discretion
amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing and
enforcing the said policy.” The Court took cognizance of the
petition on the basis of the definition of judicial power in the
Philippine Constitution as pronounced in the earlier case of
Araullo v. Aquino III (Villanueva v. Judicial and Bar Council,
G.R. No. 211833, April 7, 2015).
(c) In yet another case, the Court also took cognizance of
a petition for certiorari involving the sale by the Power Assets
and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) of a power
plant, which supposedly contravened the policy of competitive
bidding. The PSALM was created by law not to exercise
either judicial or quasi-judicial functions but to undertake
certain mandated privatization of disposable assets of certain
government entities. The basis for assuming jurisdiction over
the petition was the Constitutional mandate on the judiciary
“to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction on the part of any
branch or instrumentality of the Government” (Osmena III v.
Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation,
G.R. No. 212686, September 26, 2015).

(d) In a later case, the Court also sustained a petition for

certiorari and prohibition, based on the expanded concepts of
such special civil actions in the Constitution, filed to question
the validity of certain ordinances imposing curfew hours on
minors (Samahan ng mga Progresibong Kabataan [SPARK]
v. Quezon City, G.R. No. 225442, August 8, 201 7).

VOLUME II

Second element; the respondent has acted without
jurisdiction, or in excess of its or his jurisdiction, or with
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction
1. The second element refers to the jurisdictional
errors committed by the respondent. The sole office of a writ
of certiorari is the correction of errors of jurisdiction, including
the commission of grave abuse of discretion amounting to
lack of jurisdiction and does not include correction of public
respondent’s evaluation of the evidence and factual findings
based thereon. An error of judgment that the court may
commit in the exercise of its jurisdiction is not correctible
through the original special civil action of certiorari (People v.
Court of Appeals, 626 SCRA 351, 374, August 3, 2010).
Hence, certiorari will not be issued to cure errors in
proceedings, or correct erroneous conclusions of law or fact
and as long as a court acts within its jurisdiction, any alleged
errors committed in the exercise of its jurisdiction will only
amount to errors of judgment. Such errors are reviewable by
timely appeals and not by the special civil action of certiorari
(Heirs of Domingo Valientes v. Ramas, 638 SCRA 444, 456).
2. As earlier mentioned, a petition for certiorari must
be grounded on jurisdictional errors. This is clear from Sec. 1
of Rule 65 which requires that for the petition to be available,
the tribunal, board or officer which exercises judicial or quasi¬
judicial functions should have "acted without or in excess of its
or his jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting
to lack or excess of jurisdiction x x x

Illustration: During the formal offer of evidence by
the plaintiff, the defendant opposed the admission of
a purported deed of sale between the parties, arguing
against its genuineness and due execution. His objection
was overruled and the deed was admitted for the purpose
for which it was offered. On the premise that the objection
was legally sound, is the error of the court sufficient
to sustain a petition for certiorari against it? It is not
sufficient to sustain a petition under Rule 65. The error of
the court could be deemed a mere error in its conclusion,

217

hence, a mere error of judgment. If the judgment in the

case would, later on, be adverse to the defendant, the
error of the court would be a proper subject of an appeal.

3. Factual findings of administrative or quasi-judicial
bodies, including labor tribunals, are accorded much respect
by this Court as they are specialized to rule on matters falling
within their jurisdiction especially when these are supported
by substantial evidence. However, a relaxation of this rule is
made permissible by this Court whenever any of the following
circumstances is present:
a) when the findings are grounded entirely on
speculations, surmises or conjectures;

b) when the inference
mistaken, absurd or impossible;
c)

made is

manifestly

when there is grave abuse of discretion;

d) when the judgment is based on a misapprehen¬
sion of facts;
e)

when the findings of fact are conflicting;

f) when in making its findings, the Court of
Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings
are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and
the appellee;

g)

when the findings are contrary to that of the

trial court;
h) when the findings are conclusions without
citation of specific evidence on which they are based;
i) when the facts set forth in the petition, as well
as in the petitioner is main and reply briefs, are not
disputed by the respondent;
j) when the findings of fact are premised on the
supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the
evidence on record; and
k) when the Court of Appeals manifestly
overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the

VOLUME II

parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a
different conclusion (Cuevas v. Macatangay, G.R. No.
208506, February 22, 2017).
4. Substantially, under Sec. 1 of Rule 65, the act of the
tribunal, board or officer which is the object of the petition
should constitute errors of jurisdiction which may be any of
the following:
(a) acting without jurisdiction;

(b) acting in excess of jurisdiction even if initially
the tribunal, board or officer had jurisdiction; or
(c) acting with grave abuse of discretion amounting
to lack of jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction even if
the tribunal, board or officer initially had jurisdiction.

5. Generally, a superior court does not assess or weigh
the sufficiency of evidence upon which the respondent tribunal,
board or officer based its or his resolution or decision (Biasura
v. RTC Branch 42, Dagupan City, 499 SCRA 204, 208-209).
Where the issue or question involved affects the wisdom or
legal soundness of the decision, and not the jurisdiction of the
court to render said decision, the same is beyond the province
of a special civil action for certiorari (Catindig v. Vda. de
Meneses, 641 SCRA 350, 362).
Hence, in a petition for certiorari, the jurisdiction of the
court is narrow in scope. It is limited to resolving only errors of
jurisdiction. It is not to stray at will and resolve questions and
issues beyond its competence, such as an error of judgment
(Leviste v. Alameda, 626 SCRA 575, 611-612; See also Araullo
v. Aquino, G.R. No. 209287, July 1, 2014). Certiorari is a
remedy narrow in scope and inflexible in character. Being so,
it is not a general utility tool in the legal workshop. At this
juncture, the rule must again be emphasized: Certiorari will
issue only to correct errors of jurisdiction, and not errors of

judgment.

6. Any perceived error in the court’s interpretation of
the law and its assessment of evidence is correctible by appeal,
not certiorari, as the same would only be considered an error

219

of judgment and not of jurisdiction. In particular, the RTC’s
denial of the Motion to Suppress/Exclude Evidence based on
its assessment that the evidence sought to be suppressed/
excluded is admissible, was done in the proper exercise of

its jurisdiction. Assuming that the RTC’s determination is
erroneous, the mistake is clearly not an error of jurisdiction but
of judgment which is not correctible by certiorari (Candelaria
v. RTC, Branch 42, City of San Fernando fPampanga], G.R.
No. 173861, July 14, 2014).

Where the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter,
the orders or decisions upon all questions pertaining to the
cause are orders or decisions within its jurisdiction and
however erroneous they may be, they cannot be corrected by
certiorari. Elsewise stated, when the court has jurisdiction
over the case, its questioned acts, even if its findings are
not correct, would at most constitute errors of law and not
abuse of discretion correctible by the extraordinary remedy of
certiorari (Angara u. Fedman Development Corporation, G.R.
No. 156822, October 18, 2004).

7. A restatement of jurisprudence on the matter may
be summed up, thus: As long as a court has jurisdiction and
acts within the parameters of such jurisdiction, an error
committed by it in the exercise of such jurisdiction is not a
jurisdictional error but a mere error of judgment. Such error
may be one of fact or one of law. The error may be assailed by
way of an appeal. However, if the court exercises a jurisdiction
which it does not initially possess, the error would be an error
of jurisdiction correctible by a petition for certiorari. Also,
even if the court initially has jurisdiction, but in the course of
the exercise of such jurisdiction, the court acted in excess of
that jurisdiction or gravely abuses its discretion in a manner
amounting to lack of jurisdiction, the error of the court is one
of jurisdiction. Such error may also be assailed through a
petition for certiorari as long as there is no appeal, nor any
plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of

law.

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)
VOLUME II

Acting without Jurisdiction; In excess of jurisdiction; grave
abuse of discretion

Without jurisdiction denotes that the tribunal, board, or
officer acted with absolute lack of authority. There is excess of
jurisdiction when the public respondent exceeds its power or
acts without any statutory authority. Grave abuse of discretion
connotes such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment
as to be equivalent to lack or excess of jurisdiction; otherwise
stated, power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner
by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal hostility; and such
exercise is so patent or so gross as to amount to an evasion
of a positive duty or a virtual refusal either to perform the
duty enjoined or act at all in contemplation of law (Austria u.
Crystal Shipping, Inc., G.R. No. 206256, February 24, 2016;
See also, Revilla, Jr. v. Sandiganbayan [First Division], July
24, 2018).

Excess of jurisdiction distinguished from absence of
jurisdiction

Excess of jurisdiction as distinguished from absence of
jurisdiction means that an act, though within the general
power of a tribunal, board, or officer, is not authorized and
invalid with respect to the particular proceeding because the
conditions, which alone authorize the exercise of the general
power in respect thereof, are wanting. Without jurisdiction
means lack or want of legal power, right, or authority to
hear and determine a cause or causes, considered either in
general or with reference to a particular matter. It means lack
of power to exercise authority (Chamber of Real Estate and
Builders Association, Inc. [CREBA] v. Secretary of Agrarian
Reform, 621 SCRA 295, 313; See also Saint Mary Crusade to
Alleviate Poverty of Brethren Foundation, Inc. u. Riel, G.R. No.
176508, January 12, 2015; Angara v. Fedman Development
Corporation, G.R. No. 156822, October 18, 2004).

In simpler terms, acting in excess of jurisdiction does
not connote a total absence of jurisdiction. It signifies an act
initially authorized by law but performed beyond the bounds

—

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS

221

of that authority. Under our judicial system, such act is
equivalent to lack of jurisdiction. Lack of jurisdiction means
just what the term says it is. It is an absence of power or
authority to perform a particular act.
Grave abuse of discretion
1. The standard of review in a petition for certiorari
is whether the respondent has committed any grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction (Lagman
v. Mediaidea, G.R. No. 231771, July 4, 2017). Certiorari
will not lie when there is a mere abuse of discretion by the
tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial
functions. Such kind of abuse does not amount to lack or
excess of jurisdiction. For certiorari to lie, the abuse must be
“grave” (Sec. 1, Rule 65, Rules of Court).

Mere abuse of discretion is not enough. It must be grave,
as when it is exercised arbitrarily or despotically by reason
of passion or personal hostility (Basmala v. COMELEC, 567
SCRA 664, 668). In a special civil action for certiorari, the
petitioner carries the burden of proving not merely reversible
error, but grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or
excess of jurisdiction, on the part of the public respondent for
his issuance of the impugned order (Gravides u. COMELEC,
G.R. No. 199433, November 13, 2012; See also JM Agronomic
Company, Inc. v. Liclican, G.R. No. 208587, July 29, 2015).
2. The phrase “grave abuse of discretion” amounting
to lack or excess of jurisdiction means such capricious and
whimsical exercise of judgment by the tribunal exercising
judicial or quasi-judicial functions as to amount to lack of
power (Jardin v. NLRC, 326 SCRA 299, 304; See also Saint
Mary Crusade to Alleviate Poverty of Brethren Foundation,
Inc. v. Riel, G.R. No. 176508, January 12, 2015; J M Agronomic
Company, Inc. v. Liclican, G.R. No. 208587, July 29, 2015;
Amado u. COMELEC, G.R. No. 210164, August 18, 2015).
To be considered “grave,” discretion must be exercised in
a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility,
and must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion

of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty
enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law (Tua u.
Mangrobang, G.R. No. 170701, January 22, 2014; Dacles v.
Millenium Erectors Corporation, G.R. No. 209822, July 8,
2015).

7.

223

There is a grave abuse of discretion if a judge hears

a motion on the same day it was filed (Ardosa v. Gal-lang, 284
SCRA 58, 64) because the other party needs time to oppose
the motion.
8. It is a grave abuse of discretion on the part of a court
to order immediate execution of a final order without awaiting
the expiration of the period to appeal therefrom and without
even a motion having been filed for execution pending appeal
(PNB v. Sayo, Jr., 292 SCRA 202, 241).
9. By considering the motion for execution of the
petitioner abandoned and ordering the payment of separation
pay even if he did not abandon his claim for reinstatement, the
Executive Labor Arbiter committed a grave abuse of discretion
(Naga College Foundation Education Workers Organization v.
Bose, 289 SCRA 274, 282).
10. Rendering a decision in favor of complainants
against the alleged employer without first determining the
existence of an employer-employee relations and the failure to
express the factual and legal bases of a decision is an evasion
of a constitutional duty which constitutes a grave abuse of
discretion (Miguel v. JCT Group, Inc., 453 SCRA 529, 539-

3. A mere denial of an application for an ex parte order
for the seizure of evidence is not indicative of a grave abuse
of discretion where petitioner failed to point out specific
instances how the respondent court supposedly exercised its
power in a despotic, capricious or whimsical manner (Microsoft
Corporation v. Best Deal Computer Center Corporation, 389
SCRA 615, 620).
4. There is no grave abuse of discretion on the part of
the Court of Appeals if it dismisses an appeal on account of
the failure of the petitioner to file an appellant’s brief. This is
in accordance with Sec. 7, Rule 44 of the Rules of Court, which
imposes upon the appellant the duty to file an appellant’s brief
in ordinary appealed cases before the Court of Appeals. Non¬
filing of an appellant’s brief or a memorandum of appeal is one
of the explicitly recognized grounds to dismiss the appeal, as
provided in Sec. 1(e) of Rule 50 of the Rules of Court (Lumbre
v. Court of Appeals, 559 SCRA 419, 430; For further readings,
see Bureau of Internal Revenue v. Acosta, G.R. No. 195320,
April 23, 2018).

540).

11. When a court allows an uninterested person to
intervene in a case, the mistake is not simply an error of
judgment, but one of jurisdiction. That kind of error may be
reviewed in a special civil action for certiorari (Anonuevo v.
Intestate Estate of Jalandoni, 636 SCRA 420, 428-429). One
who has no legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the
success of either of the parties or both, or who is not so situated
as to be adversely affected by a distribution or disposition of
property involved in the case, has no standing to intervene.
12. There is no grave abuse of discretion if the trial
court, in the interest of justice, required a full-blown hearing
to determine factual issues in a land registration case even if
the petitioner did not comply with some procedural rules (City
of Dumaguete v. Philippine Ports Authority, 656 SCRA 102,
116-117).

5. A judge gravely abuses his discretion when he
extends by 20 days the 72-hour restraining order he initially
issued because in no case shall the total period of effectivity of
the temporary restraining order exceed 20 days including the
72 hours originally provided (Sec. 5, Rule 58, Rules of Court;
Beso v. Aballe, 326 SCRA 100, 107-108).
6. There is a grave abuse of discretion where the trial
court fails to determine a factual controversy before issuing
a writ of demolition. Failure to do so is to disregard basic
principles of due process because before demolition could be
effected, the parties concerned must be heard. Such error may
be corrected by a writ of certiorari (Bermudez v. Gonzales, 347
SCRA 611, 619).

I

224

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

13. The grant or denial of a motion for postponement
is not indicative of a grave abuse of discretion when no
substantial rights are affected and the intention to delay is
not manifest. After all, postponements and continuances
are parts and parcel of the procedural system for dispensing
justice (Spouses Sibay v. Spouses Bermudez, G.R. No. 198196,
July 17, 2017).
14. The errors of the court in applying the facts and
the evidence and its erroneous conclusions are mere errors
of judgment and do not rise to the level of grave abuse of
discretion; otherwise, every mistake of the court will deprive
it of its jurisdiction and every erroneous judgment will be a
void judgment (See Miranda v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. Nos.
144760-61, August 2, 2017).

15. A manifest disregard of the basic rules and proce¬
dures constitute a grave abuse of discretion (Cruz v. People,
G.R. No. 224974, July 3, 2017).

16. The ombudsman’s failure to evaluate a criminal
complaint in accordance with its own rules constitutes grave
abuse of discretion (Espaldon v. Buban, G.R. No. 202784,
April 18, 2018).

Burden Imposed on petitioner
The burden is on petitioner to prove that the respondent
tribunal committed not merely a reversible error but also
a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction (Umali u. Judicial and Bar Council, G.R. No.
228628, July 25, 2017).

Third element: absence of appeal or any plain, speedy and
adequate remedy (Bar 1999)
1. For a writ of certiorari to issue, a petitioner must not
only prove that the tribunal, board or officer exercising judicial
or quasi-judicial functions has acted without or in excess of
jurisdiction but must also show that he has no plain, speedy
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law (Sonic
Steel Industries, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 626 SCRA 142, 147-

— —

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 65 Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

226

148; See also Bank of Commerce v. Radio Philippines Network,
Inc., G.R. No. 195615, April 21, 2014; Heirs of Sobremonte u.
Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 206234, October 22, 2014).
2. The settled rule is that certiorari is not available
where the aggrieved party’s remedy of appeal is plain, speedy,
and adequate in the ordinary course of law, the reason being
that certiorari cannot co-exist with an appeal, these remedies
being mutually exclusive (Caballes v. Court of Appeals, 452
SCRA 312, 323; Freedom from Debt Coalition u. MWSS, 539
SCRA 621, 633-634).
Hence, a petitioner avails of the wrong remedy to question
the decision of the Court of Appeals before the Supreme
Court by filing before it a petition for certiorari. A petition for
certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court is availed of only
when there is no appeal, or any plain, speedy, and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law. In fact, a motion for
reconsideration is recognized as an adequate remedy against
a decision, resolution, or order of a lower court, as it provides
the court opportunity to correct any error it might have
committed. The availability of the remedy of a motion for
reconsideration generally precludes immediate recourse to a
certiorari petition. The petitioner who never filed a motion for
reconsideration or an appeal from the judgment of the Court
of Appeals, cannot now file a petition for certiorari without
even offering an explanation for not availing of the remedies
allowed it under the Rules. The long delay negates the urgency
of its cause of action and indicates that it resorted to certiorari
as a substitute for a lost appeal even if the petition was
filed within the 60-day period to institute the petition (680
Home Appliances, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 206599,
September 29, 201 4).

3. Jurisprudence states that “[i]t is [the] inadequacy,
[and] not the mere absence of all other legal remedies and the
danger of failure of justice without the writ, that must usually
determine the propriety of certiorari [or prohibition]. A remedy
is plain, speedy[,] and adequate if it will promptly relieve the
petitioner from the injurious effects of the judgment, order,

226

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

or resolution of the lower court or agency, x x x. ” (Morales u.
Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 217126-27, November 10, 2015).
When certiorari is allowed despite availability of appeal (Bar
1999, 2002)

1. Even if the extraordinary remedy of certiorari is
not proper when an appeal is available, it may be allowed
when it can be shown that appeal would be inadequate,
slow, insufficient, and will not promptly relieve a party from
the injurious effects of the order complained of (Hualam
Construction and Development Corporation v. Court of
Appeals, 214 SCRA 612, 628). (Bar 1999)

2. Although Sec. 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court
provides that the special civil action of certiorari may only
be invoked when “there is no appeal, nor any plain, speedy
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,” this
rule is not without exception. The availability of the ordinary
course of appeal does not constitute a sufficient ground to
prevent a party from making use of the extraordinary remedy,
of certiorari where the appeal is not an adequate remedy or
equally beneficial, speedy, and sufficient. It is the inadequacy
not the mere absence - of all other legal remedies and the
danger of failure of justice without the writ that must usually
determine the propriety of certiorari. A writ of certiorari has
been allowed when the orders of the lower court were issued
either in excess of or without jurisdiction. Certiorari may
also be availed of where an appeal would be slow, inadequate
and insufficient and that to strictly observe the general rule
would result in a miscarriage of justice (Land Bank of the
Philippines v. Umandap, 635 SCRA 116, 126-127; See also
Aquino v. Municipality of Malay, G.R. No. 211356, September
29, 2014).

-

Necessity for a motion for reconsideration

1. Settled is the rule that, except in some recognized
situations, the filing of a motion for reconsideration is a
condition sine qua non to the filing of a petition for certiorari

—

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 65 — Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

227

(Romy’s Freight Service v. Castro, 490 SCRA 160, 164; Nuque
v. Aquino, G.R. No. 193058, July 8, 2015) to allow the court
an opportunity to correct its imputed errors (Reyes v. Court
of Appeals, 321 SCRA 368, 373). The filing of a motion for
reconsideration before a resort to certiorari is intended to afford
the public respondent an opportunity to correct any actual or
fancied error attributed to it by way of re-examination of the
legal and factual aspects of the case (Villena v. Rupisan, 520
SCRA 346, 358-359; Bokingo v. Court of Appeals, 489 SCRA
521, 529-530; Morales v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 21712627, November 10, 2015).

Another reason for filing a motion for reconsideration
prior to resorting to the extraordinary remedy of certiorari or
prohibition is that said motion may still be considered as a
plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
of law (Morales v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos. 217126-27,
November 10, 2015).
2. The mere fact that a petitioner fails to move for the
reconsideration of the court a quo’s order denying his motion
is a sufficient cause for the outright dismissal of a petition
for certiorari. Certiorari, as a special civil action, will not lie
unless a motion for reconsideration is first filed. To warrant a
deviation from this rule, one must proffer a compelling reason
(Bokingo v. Court of Appeals, 489 SCRA 521, 529-530).
Exceptions to the requirement of a motion for reconsidera*
tion (Bar 1989)
1. A motion for reconsideration is a condition sine qua
non for the filing of a petition for certiorari. The purpose of
the motion is to grant an opportunity to the court below to
correct any actual or perceived error attributed to it by a re¬
examination of the legal and factual circumstances of the
case. This is, however, not an ironclad rule. It admits of welldefined exceptions (Spouses Larry and Flora Davis v. Spouses
Florencio and Lucresia Davis, G.R. No. 196795, March 7,
2018).
Certain exceptions were crafted to the general rule
requiring a prior motion for reconsideration before the filing

CIVIL PROCEDURE

228

Rule 65

VOLUME II

of a petition for certiorari, which exceptions also apply to a
petition for prohibition. Some of the recognized exceptions
include:
(a) the order is a patent nullity, as where the court
a quo has no jurisdiction;
(b) the questions raised in the certiorari proceeding
have been duly raised and passed upon by the lower
court, or are the same as those raised and passed upon in
the lower court;
(c) there is an urgent necessity for the resolution of
the question and any further delay would prejudice the
interests of the government or of the petitioner;

also City Government of Baguio v. Masweng, G.R. No.
195905, July 4, 2018).

2. Where the petition is filed questioning the authority
of the Court of Appeals to enjoin the implementation of
a preventive suspension order issued by the Office of the
Ombudsman, an exception to the requirement of a prior
motion for reconsideration exists. The petition tests the
constitutional and statutory limits of the fundamental powers
of key government institutions - namely, the Office of the
Ombudsman, the Legislature, and the Judiciary - and hence,
involves an issue of transcendental public importance that
demands no less than a careful but expeditious resolution. Also
raised is the equally important issue on the propriety of the
continuous application of the condonation doctrine as invoked
by a public officer who desires exculpation from administrative
liability. As such, the Ombudsman’s direct resort to certiorari
and prohibition before the Court, notwithstanding the failure
to move for the prior reconsideration of the assailed issuances
of the Court of Appeals, is justified (Morales v. Court of
Appeals, G.R. Nos. 217126-27, November 10, 2015).
3. In a case, the petitioner bank had sought the
quashal of the alias writ of execution issued by the Regional
Trial Court. Twice, the attempts to quash were denied. The
court had obviously refused to budge on the issues raised by
the petitioner. Another motion for reconsideration would have
been superfluous. There was no point in asking the court to
reconsider its refusal to quash the writ. Besides, circumstances
existed indicating that there was an urgent need for the
immediate resolution of the case by the Court of Appeals
because of great prejudice to the petitioner occasioned by any
further delay in resolving the matters raised. Accordingly,
the Sheriff had been resolute and relentless in trying to
execute the judgment and dispose of the levied assets of the
petitioner. The Sheriff started garnishing the bank’s deposits
in various banks. He also seized the bank’s computers,
printers, and monitors, causing the temporary cessation of its
banking operations in that branch and putting the bank in
an unwarranted danger of a run. Clearly, the petitioner had

valid justifications for skipping the technical requirement of a
motion for consideration before filing a petition for certiorari
(Bank of Commerce u. Radio Philippines Network, Inc., G.R.
No. 195615, April 21, 2014).
Filing of the petition for certiorari
1. The person aggrieved may file a verified petition with
the proper court. The verified petition is required to: (a) allege
the facts with certainty; (b) pray that judgment be rendered
annulling or modifying the proceedings of the tribunal, board
or officer; and (c) grant such incidental reliefs as law and
justice may require (Sec. 1, Rule 65, Rules of Court).

2. Specifically, the petition shall contain the full names
and addresses of all the petitioners and respondents, a concise
statement of the matters involved, the factual background of
the case, and the grounds relied upon for the relief prayed for
(Sec. 3, Rule 46, Rules of Court).
3. A special civil action for certiorari may be filed by an
aggrieved party alleging grave abuse of discretion amounting
to excess or lack of jurisdiction on the part of the trial court. In
a long line of cases, the Court construed the term “aggrieved
parties” to include the State and the private offended party or
complainant. It was held that the offended parties in criminal
cases have sufficient interest and personality as “person(s)
aggrieved” to file the special civil action of prohibition and
certiorari under Secs. 1 and 2 of Rule 65. The aggrieved parties
are the State and the private offended party or complainant.
The complainant has such an interest in the civil aspect of
the case that he may file a special civil action questioning the
decision or action of the respondent court on jurisdictional
grounds. In so doing, complainant should not bring the action
in the name of the People of the Philippines. He should do so
and prosecute it in his name as such complainant (Salvador v.
Chua, G.R. No. 212865, July 15, 2015).

The general rule is that a judgment of acquittal rendered
after trial on the merits shall be immediately final and
unappealable because further prosecution will place the

231

accused in double jeopardy. However, the defense of double
jeopardy will not lie in a Rule 65 petition. Unlike in an appeal,
this remedy does not involve a review of facts and law on
the merits, an examination of evidence and a determination
of its probative value, or an inquiry on the correctness of
the evaluation of the evidence. Judicial review in certiorari
proceedings shall be confined to the question of whether the
judgment for acquittal is per se void on jurisdictional grounds.
The court will look into the decision’s validity
if it was
rendered by a court without jurisdiction or if the court acted
with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess
of jurisdiction
not on its legal correctness. The abuse of
discretion must be so patent and gross as to amount to an
evasion of a positive duty or virtual refusal to perform a duty
imposed by law, or to act in contemplation of law or where
the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner
by reason of passion and hostility. More specifically, to prove
that an acquittal is tainted with grave abuse of discretion,
the petitioner must show that the prosecution’s right to due
process was violated or that the trial conducted was a sham
(People v. Sandiganbayan, et al., G.R. No. 198119, September
27, 2017).

Other requirements for filing the petition
1. The petition shall be accompanied by (a) a certified
true copy of the judgment, order or resolution subject of the
petition, (b) copies of all pertinent pleadings and documents,
and (c) a sworn certification of non-forum shopping (Sec. 1,
Rule 65, Rules of Court; Caingat v. NLRC, 453 SCRA 142,

148-149).

2. Observe that the foregoing rule speaks of two sets of
documents to be attached to the petition. The first set consists
of a certified true copy of the judgment, order or resolution

subject of the petition. Duplicate originals or certified true
copies thereof must be appended to enable the reviewing
court to determine whether the court, body or tribunal, which
rendered the same, committed grave abuse of discretion.

——

CIVIL PROCEDURE

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 66 Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

The second set consists of pleadings, portions of the
case record and other documents which are material and
pertinent to the petition. In this second set, mere photocopies
thereof may be attached to the petition. The requirement for
certified true copies refers to the judgment, order or resolution
(Air Philippines v. Zamora, 498 SCRA 59, 68-69; See also
Wenceslao, et al. v. Makati Development Corporation, et al.,
G.R. No. 230696, August 30, 2017) and are the documents
mentioned in the first set.
The use of mere photocopies of certified true copies of
judgments or orders subject matter of a petition renders that
petition insufficient in form, and a court commits no error in
dismissing the said petition (Pinakamasarap Corporation v.
NLRC, 503 SCRA 128-136).
3. A petition is procedurally flawed if Sec. 1 of Rule 65
is not complied with because these are documents important
for the court’s appraisal, evaluation and judicious disposition
of the case. Non-observance of the rule is a sufficient cause for
the dismissal of the petition and cannot be merely brushed
aside as a mere technicality (Lim v. Vianzon, 497 SCRA 482,

(c) when notice of the denial of the motion for new
trial or reconsideration was received (Sec. 3, Rule 46,
Rules of Court).
The requirement is for the purpose of determining the
timeliness of the petition, since the perfection of an appeal,
in the manner and within the period prescribed by law, is
jurisdictional and failure to perfect an appeal, as required by
law, renders the judgment final and executory (Great Southern
Maritime Services Corporation u. Acuna, 452 SCRA 422, 432).

232

492-493).

Certification against forum shopping

In filing a certiorari petition, the party aggrieved must
also attach a sworn certification of non-forum shopping (Sec.
1, Rule 65; Sec. 3, Rule 46; Go v. Sunbanon, 642 SCRA 367,
378).
Material dates in the petition; “material date rule”

Under the material date rule, the following material
dates must be stated in the petition:
(a) when notice of the judgment, final order or
resolution subject of the petition was received;
(b) when a motion for new trial or reconsideration
was filed, if any; and

233

When to file petition; extension generally prohibited
1. The main rule to be remembered is that the petition
is to be filed not later than 60 days from notice of the judgment,
order or resolution. In case a motion for reconsideration or new
trial is timely filed, whether such motion is required or not,
the 60-day period shall be counted from notice of the denial of
said motion (Sec. 4, Rule 65, Rules of Court; Land Bank of the
Philippines v. Saludanes, 477 SCRA 506, 509-510; Coca-Cola
Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. Del Villar, 632 SCRA 293, 310).
2. Effective December 27, 2007 per A.M. No. 07-712-SC, the old last paragraph of Sec. 4 of Rule 65 has been
deleted. The said paragraph provided: No extension of time to
file the petition shall be granted except for the most compelling
reason and in no case to exceed 15 days (Sec. 4, Rule 65, Rules
of Court). The rule now is that petitions for certiorari must be
filed strictly within 60 days from notice of the judgment, order
or resolution, or from notice of the order denying the motion
for reconsideration or new trial.
The 60-day period starts from notice to the counsel, if a
litigant is represented by counsel. Notice to him is considered
notice to the party (Pagdanganan, Jr. v. Sarmiento, G.R. No.
206555, September 17, 2014).

3.

The pronouncements of the Court in one case are

instructive:

“While the proper courts previously had discretion to
extend the period for filing a petition for certiorari beyond

CIVIL PROCEDURE

Rule 65

VOLUME II

the 6O-day period, the amendments to Rule 65 under
A M. No. 07-7-12-SC disallowed extensions of time to file
a petition for certiorari with the deletion of the paragraph
that previously permitted such extensions.
XXX

If the Court intended to retain the authority of the
proper courts to grant extensions under Sec. 4 of Rule 65,
the paragraph providing for such authority would have
been preserved. The removal of the said paragraph under
the amendment by A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC of Sec. 4, Rule 65
simply meant that there could no longer be any extension
of the 60-day period within which to file a petition for

certiorari.
The rationale for the amendments under A.M. No.

07-7-12-SC is essentially to prevent the use (or abuse) of
the petition for certiorari under Rule 65 to delay a case or
even defeat the ends of justice. Deleting the paragraph
allowing extensions to file petition on compelling grounds
did away with the filing of such motions. As the Rule now
stands, petitions for certiorari must be filed strictly within
60 days from notice of judgment or from the order denying
a motion for reconsideration” (Laguna Metts Corporation
v. Caalam, 594 SCRA 139, 144-146).

4. However, in a case decided after Laguna Metts
Corporation, the Court declared, that the filing of a motion
for extension of time to file a petition under Rule 65 is not
absolutely prohibited. The Court explained that if absolute
proscription were intended, the deleted portion could just have
been simply reworded to specifically prohibit an extension
of time to file such petition. Because of the lack of express
prohibition, it was held in Domdom that motions for extension
may be allowed, subject to the Court’s sound discretion, and
only under exceptional and meritorious cases (Domdom v.
Sandiganbayan, 613 SCRA 528, 535).
Subsequent pronouncements also affirmed the relaxation
of the procedural technicalities introduced under A.M. No. 077-12-SC in order to serve substantial justice and safeguard

A more recent case declared:

11. in the name of substantial justice and fair play;
12. importance of the issues involved; and

13. exercise of sound discretion by the judge guided
by all the attendant circumstances.
Thus, there should be an effort on the part of the
party invoking liberality to advance a reasonable or
meritorious explanation for his/her failure to comply with
the rules” (People v. Espinosa, G.R. No. 199070, April 7,
2014, citing Labao v. Flores, 634 SCRA 723, November 15,
2010; THEMARIS Philippines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,
G.R. No. 191215, February 3, 2014; Naguit v. San Miguel
Corporation, G.R. No. 188839, June 22, 2015; Central
Bicol State University v. Province of Camarines Sur, G.R.
No. 210861, July 29, 2015; See also Adtel, Inc. v. Valdez,
G.R. No. 189942, August 9, 2017).

5. The Court, however, still prefers the observance of
the general rule on the period for filing the petition.
The Court, in one case, instructed that the fact that the
delay in the filing of the petition for certiorari was only one (1)
day is not a legal justification for non-compliance with the rule
requiring that it be filed not later than 60 days from notice of
the assailed judgment, order or resolution. The Court cannot
subscribe to the theory that the ends of justice would be better
subserved by allowing a petition for certiorari filed only oneday late. When the law fixes 60 days, it cannot be taken to
mean also 61 days. While it is always in the power of the Court
to suspend its own rules, or to except a particular case from
its operation, the liberality with which equity jurisdiction is
exercised must always be anchored on the basic consideration
that the same must be warranted by the circumstances
obtaining in the case. Where there is no showing of any
exceptional circumstance that may rationalize a digression
from the rule on timeliness of petitions, the period mandated
by the rule must be observed (Visayan Electric Company
Employees Union v. Visayan Electric Company, Inc., G.R. No.
205575, July 22, 2015).

Court where petition is filed
1. If the petition relates to the acts or omissions of a
municipal trial court or corporation, board, officer or person,
then the petition shall be filed with the Regional Trial Court
exercising jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by
the Supreme Court (Sec. 4, Rule 65, Rules of Court).

2. If it involves the acts or omissions of a quasi-judicial
agency, the petition shall be filed with and cognizable only by
the Court of Appeals, unless otherwise provided by law or the
Rules of Court (Sec. 4, Rule 65, Rules of Court).
3. The rule used to be that the petition may be filed with
the Sandiganbayan if it is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction
(Sec. 4, Rule 65, Rules of Court). However, A.M. 07-7-12-SC,
which took effect on December 27, 2007, now provides that the
petition may be filed with the Sandiganbayan whether or not
the same is in aid of its appellate jurisdiction.
It has been observed, however, that under the law, the
authority of the Sandiganbayan to entertain petitions for
certiorari, prohibition and mandamus is only in aid of its
appellate jurisdiction. There appears to be a need to take a
second look at the amendment which clearly is not in accord
with substantive law. The pertinent provision provides:
“The Sandiganbayan shall have exclusive original
jurisdiction over petitions for the issuance of the writs
of mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, habeas corpus,
injunctions, and other ancillary writs and processes in aid
of its appellate jurisdiction and over petitions of similar
nature, including quo warranto, arising or that may arise
in cases filed or which may be filed under Executive Order
Nos. 1, 2, 14 and 14-A, issued in 1986: Provided, That
the jurisdiction over these petitions shall not be exclusive
of the Supreme Court” (Sec. 4, R.A. 8249 amending P.D.
1606; Underscoring supplied).

4. In election cases involving an act or omission of a
Municipal or Regional Trial Court, the petition shall be filed
exclusively with the Commission on Elections, in aid of its

238

CIVIL PROCEDURE

—

VOLUME II

appellate jurisdiction (Last paragraph of Sec. 4, Rule 65 per
A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC, effective December 27, 2007). (Bar 2012)

In Galang v. Geronimo, G.R. No. 192793, February 22,
2011, a petition for certiorari and prohibition under Rule 65
was filed with the Supreme Court, alleging that respondent
RTC judge acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction, in considering as valid the sheriffs service of
summons on a person not residing in petitioner’s residence.
The respondent, however, contended that the petition for
certiorari should not have been filed with the Supreme Court
but with the Commission on Elections.

In resolving the issue on whether or not the petition
should be filed with the Supreme Court, the Court relied upon
the provisions of Sec. 4 of Rule 65 which provides:
“In election cases involving an act or omission of a
municipal or a regional trial court, the petition shall be
filed exclusively with the Commission on Elections, in aid
of its appellate jurisdiction.”

The Court then asked:“x x x fWJould taking cognizance of
apetition for certiorari questioning an interlocutory order of the
Regional Trial Court in an electoral protest case be considered
in aid of the appellate jurisdiction of the COMELEC?”
Citing previous decisions, the Court ruled in the
affirmative. It held that a court may issue a writ of certiorari in
aid of its appellate jurisdiction if said court has jurisdiction to
review, by appeal or writ of error, the final orders or decisions
of the lower court. Accordingly, since it is the COMELEC
which has jurisdiction to take cognizance of an appeal from

239

the decision of the Regional Trial Court in election contests
involving elective municipal officials, then it is also the
COMELEC which has jurisdiction to issue a writ of certiorari
in aid of its appellate jurisdiction. Clearly, ruled the Court,
“petitioner erred in invoking this Court’s power to issue said
extraordinary writ.” The petition failed.

Meaning of "in aid of Its appellate jurisdiction”

From the context of the arguments of the parties, it is
evident that the petitioner did not file the petition with the
Commission on Elections in his belief that since there is yet
no existing appeal filed with said body, it could not yet act “in
aid of its appellate jurisdiction.”

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 65 Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

Observance of the “hierarchy of courts” principle

>

The Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction to issue writs
of certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto, habeas
corpus, and injunction is not exclusive. It is shared by the
Supreme Court with the Regional Trial Court and the Court
of Appeals. This concurrence of jurisdiction, however, should
not be taken to mean that the parties have an absolute,
unrestrained freedom of choice of the court to which they
will file their application or petition. There is an ordained
sequence of recourse to courts vested with concurrent
jurisdiction, beginning from the lowest, on to the next highest,
and ultimately to the highest. This hierarchy is determinative
of the venue of appeals, and the proper forum for petitions
for extraordinary writs. A direct invocation of the Supreme
Court’s original jurisdiction to issue these writs should be
allowed only when there are special and important reasons
therefor, clearly and specifically set out in the petition. This
is established policy. It is a policy that is necessary to prevent
inordinate demands upon the Court’s time and attention
which are better devoted to those matters within its exclusive
jurisdiction, and to prevent the further clogging of the Court’s
docket (Montes v. Court of Appeals, 489 SCRA 432, 442443; Sec. 9[1], B.P. 129; Sec. 5(1], Art. VIII, Constitution of
the Philippines; Sec. 21[1], B.P. 129; See Clark Investors and
Locators Association, Inc. v. Secretary of Finance, G.R. No.
200670, July 6, 2015).

Parties to the petition
1. The petition shall be filed by the “person aggrieved”
(Sec. 1, Rule 65, Rules of Court). The person aggrieved under
Sec. 1 of Rule 65 is not to be construed to mean that any person

240

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)
VOLUME II

who feels injured by the lower court’s order or decision can
question the said court’s disposition by certiorari. It pertains
to the person who was a party in the proceedings before the
lower court (Tong u. Court of Appeals, 325 SCRA 394, 402403).

2. Where the petition relates to the acts or omissions
of a judge, court, quasi-judicial agency, tribunal, corporation,
board, officer or person, the petitioner shall join as private
respondents with the public respondent, persons interested in
sustaining the proceedings in the court (Sec. 5, Rule 65, Rules
of Court).
Duty of private respondent

The private respondent should appear and defend not only
in his own behalf but also in behalf of the public respondent
affected by the proceedings. If costs are awarded in favor of the
petitioner, such costs shall be against the private respondent
only and not against the public respondent (Sec. 5, Rule 65,
Rules of Court).
Public respondent; appearance not required; exception

The public respondent is not mandated to appear in, or file
an answer or comment to the petition or any pleading, unless
specifically directed by the court where the action is pending.
If the case is elevated to a higher court by either party, the
public respondent shall be included therein as a nominal
party. However, unless otherwise specifically directed by the
court, he shall not appear or participate in the proceedings
therein (Sec. 5, Rule 65, Rules of Court).
Filing of petition does not stay proceedings; necessity for a
writ of injunction
1. If a petition for certiorari is filed with a higher court
against an alleged grave abuse of discretion
by

committed
a
lower court in the course of its proceedings, may the court
below suspend its proceedings in deference to the higher
court?

Rule 65 Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

241

Current rules answer the question in the negative. The
provisions of Sec. 7 of Rule 65 are clear on the matter. To
suspend the proceedings, the court against whom the petition
is directed must be prevented from proceeding with the case
by a duly issued writ of preliminary injunction or temporary
restraining order (See also BF Citiland Corporation v. Otake,
626 SCRA 220, 228; See Silverio v. Silverio, G.R. No. 186589,
July 18, 2014). Hence, because of the clear tenor of Sec. 7
of Rule 65, the pendency of a petition for certiorari before
the Supreme Court will not prevent the Sandiganbayan
from proceeding to trial absent the issuance of a temporary
restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction (Cagang
v. Sandiganbayan, G.R. Nos. 206438 and 206458, July 31,
2018).
2. In clear-cut language, the rule provides that the
filing of a petition for certiorari does not interrupt the course
of the principal action, unless an application for a temporary
restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction is
granted by the higher court (Sec. 7, Rule 65, Rules of Court;
Lu v. Chiong, G.R. No. 222070, April 16, 2018). The reason is
not hard to see. A petition for certiorari is an original action
and not a continuation of the proceedings in the lower court.
Consequently, the petition is actually not concerned with the
merits of the case below. Hence, the mere filing of a petition
for certiorari with a higher court before the defendant files and
serves his answer to the complaint, does not stop the running
of the period within which to file an answer to the complaint
filed with the lower court. (Bar 2013)

Illustration: In a case filed before the RTC, the
defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on
the ground of failure to state a cause of action. The
court denied the motion and the subsequent motion
for reconsideration. A petition for certiorari was then
filed with the Court of Appeals to nullify and set aside
the orders of the RTC. While the petition for certiorari
was pending, the plaintiff filed a motion to declare the
defendant in default for failure to file an answer within

242

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)
VOLUME II

the reglementary period. Would the RTC be in error if it
declares the non-answering defendant in default1?
The RTC would not be faulted if it grants the motion to
declare the defendant in default. The running of the period to
file an answer was not interrupted because the defendant did
not avail of a writ of preliminary injunction when he filed the
petition for certiorari (For related readings, see Diaz u. Diaz,
331 SCRA 302, 319). Settled is the rule that to arrest the
course of the principal action during the pendency of certiorari
proceedings, there must be a restraining order or a writ of
preliminary injunction from the appellate court directed
against the lower court (People v. Almendros, 401 SCRA 555,
571).

Judicial courtesy is not the prevailing rule; exception
1. It has been the common practice of a lower court to
suspend the proceedings of the principal case pending before
it whenever a petition for certiorari is filed against it. The
reason which it usually invokes is judicial courtesy.

With the amendment, the lower court or tribunal,
which is the object of the petition for certiorari, can no longer
conveniently use judicial courtesy as an excuse for deferring
the proceedings. It has to proceed with the principal case
within the required period unless it is prevented from doing
so by a temporary restraining order or a writ of preliminary
injunction.
Under the new rule, the public respondent has the duty
to proceed with the principal case within 10 days from the
filing of the petition for certiorari with a higher court or
tribunal, absent a temporary restraining order or a writ of
preliminary injunction, or upon its expiration. Failure of the
public respondent to proceed with the principal case may be a
ground for an administrative charge (Amendment to
Sec. 7 of
Rule 65perA.M. No. 07-7-12-SC, effective December 27, 2007).
2. Section 7, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court provides the
general rule that the mere pendency of a special
civil action

PART II
Rule 66

243

for certiorari, commenced in relation to a case pending before
a lower court or court of origin, does not stay the proceedings
therein in the absence of a writ of preliminary injunction or
temporary restraining order. It is true that there are instances
where, even if there is no writ of preliminary injunction or
temporary restraining order issued by a higher court, it would
be proper for a lower court or court of origin to suspend its
proceedings on the precept of judicial courtesy. The principle
of judicial courtesy, however, remains to be the exception
rather than the rule. As held by th[e] Court x x x the precept
of judicial courtesy should not be applied indiscriminately and
haphazardly if we are to maintain the relevance of Sec. 7, Rule
65 of the Rules of Court” (De Leon v. Public Estates Authority,
626 SCRA 547, 562)
3. The principle of judicial courtesy, to justify the
suspension of the proceedings before the lower court even
without an injunctive writ or order from the higher court,
may still apply “if there is a strong probability that the issues
before the higher court would be rendered moot and moribund
as a result of the continuation of the proceedings in the lower
court” (Sara Lee Philippines, Inc. v. Macatlang, G.R. No.
180148, January 14, 2015).
Duty of the court which issued the preliminary injunction
1. Recall that the mere filing of a petition for certiorari
does not interrupt the course of the principal case, unless the
lower court or tribunal is restrained from proceeding with
the case either by a temporary restraining order or a writ
of preliminary injunction issued by the court in which the
petition for certiorari is filed (Sec. 7, Rule 65, Rules of Court).

By virtue of the amendment introduced by A.M. No.
07-7-12-SC, the trial court, Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan
or Court of Tax Appeals that issued the writ of preliminary
injunction against the lower court, tribunal, board, officer, or
quasi-judicial agency shall decide the main case or petition
within 6 months from the issuance of the writ (Last paragraph,
Sec. 5, Rule 58, Rules of Court).

Order to comment
1. Unlike an ordinary civil action, where the issuance
and service of summons follow the filing of the complaint, no
summons is issued in a petition for certiorari.

2. Instead of summons, the court shall issue an order
requiring the respondent to comment on the petition within 10
days from receipt of a copy of the petition. However, the order
to comment shall be issued only if the court finds that the
petition is sufficient in form and substance (Sec. 6, Rule 65,
Rules of Court). The inevitable implication is that the petition
may be outrightly dismissed if found not to be sufficient in
both form and substance.

The determination of the completeness or sufficiency of
the form of the petition, including the relevant and pertinent
documents which have to be attached to it, is largely left to the
discretion of the court taking cognizance of the petition. If the
petition is insufficient in form and substance, the same may
be dismissed without further proceedings. That is the import
of Sec. 6, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court (Palm Tree Estates,
Inc. v. Philippine National Bank, G.R. No. 159370, October 3,
2012).
3. The order to comment shall be served together with
a copy of the petition and the annexes thereto (Sec. 6, Rule 65,
Rules of Court). Note that it is a comment that shall be filed
by the respondent, and not a motion to dismiss.
4. In petitions for certiorari before the Supreme Court
and the Court of Appeals, the provisions of Sec. 2 of Rule 56
shall be observed. Before giving due course thereto, the court
may require the respondents to file their comments to, and
not a motion to dismiss, the petition. Thereafter, the court
may require the filing of a reply and such other responsive or
other pleadings as it may deem necessary and proper (Sec. 6,
Rule 65, Rules of Court).

Proceedings after comment; Judgment
1. After the comment or other pleadings are filed (or
the
time to file the same has expired), the court has
the following

— —

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 65 Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

246

options: (a) hear the case, or (b) require the parties to submit
memoranda (Sec. 8, Rule 65, Rules of Court).
2. If after such hearing or submission of memoranda
(or upon the expiration of the period for filing the same), the

court shall render judgment for the relief prayed for or to
which the petitioner is entitled. This shall be done if the court
finds that the allegations of the petition are true (Sec. 8, Rule
65, Rules of Court). Observe that the court need not conduct
a hearing. Instead, it may require the filing of memoranda,
unless, of course, it finds a hearing necessary.
Grounds for dismissal of the petition; unmeritorious
petitions

1. The court may dismiss the petition on any of the fol¬
lowing reasons:

(a) The petition is found to be patently without
merit;

(b) The petition is prosecuted manifestly for delay;

or
(c)

The questions raised in the petition are too
unsubstantial to require consideration (Sec. 8, Rule 65,
Rules of Court).
2. In the event of dismissal of unmeritorious petitions,
the court may award in favor of the respondent treble costs
solidarily against the petitioner and counsel, in addition to
subjecting the counsel to administrative sanctions under
Rules 139 and 139-B of the Rules of Court (Sec. 8, Rule 65,
as amended by A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC, effective December 27,
2007). In addition, the Court (Supreme Court) may impose
motu proprio, based on res ipsa loquitur, other disciplinary
sanctions or measures on erring lawyers for patently dilatory
and unmeritorious petitions for certiorari (Sec. 8, Rule 65,
as amended by A.M. No. 07-7-12-SC, effective December 27,
2007).

Service of copy of judgment to public respondent
A certified copy of the judgment rendered in the
certiorari proceedings shall be served upon the court, quasi¬
judicial agency, tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person
concerned in such manner as the court may direct (Sec. 9,
Rule 65, Rules of Court).
Contempt for disobedience

Disobedience to the judgment or order shall be punished
as contempt (Sec. 9, Rule 65, Rules of Court).
Relief

The primary relief will actually be the annulment or
modification of the judgment, order, resolution or proceeding
subject of the petition . It may also include such other incidental
reliefs as law and justice may require (Sec. 1, Rule 65, Rules of
Court). The court, in its judgment, may also award damages.
The execution of the award for damages or costs shall follow
the procedure in Sec. 1 of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (Sec. 9,
Rule 65, Rules of Court).
Review of judgment in a certiorari petition
1. The decision of a court in a petition for certiorari
in Rule 65 is reviewable by appeal because certiorari is an
original action. For example, the decision of the Court of
Appeals in a petition for certiorari filed before it is appealable
to the Supreme Court by way of a petition for review on
certiorari under Rule 45. Under Sec. 3 of Rule 56, an appeal to
the Supreme Court may be taken only by a petition for review
on certiorari.

2. Foilowing the same principle as above, the decision of
the RTC in a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 is appealable
to the Court of Appeals, by way of a notice of appeal,
not a
petition for review under Rule 42. This
is because the decision
of the RTC in a petition for certiorari
is one made in the
exercise of its original jurisdiction (BF
Citiland Corporation

—

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 65 — Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

247

v. Otake, 626 SCRA 220, 228). Under current rules, the notice
of appeal is to be made pursuant to Rule 41.
Liberal construction; when a Rule 45 petition Is considered
as a Rule 65 petition and vice*versa.

In many instances, the Court has treated a petition for
review on certiorari under Rule 45 as a petition for certiorari
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court. This happens in cases
where the subject of the recourse is one of jurisdiction, or
the act complained of is perpetrated by a court with grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction,
but when the petition denominated as a Rule 45 petition
neither involves any issue on jurisdiction nor a grave abuse
of discretion on the part of the Court of Appeals, it should
be dismissed outright (China Banking Corporation v. Asian
Construction and Development Corporation, 550 SCRA 585,
592; For further readings, see Kom u. Rodriguez, G.R. No.
215764, July 6, 2015).
Also, in accordance with the liberal spirit pervading the
Rules of Court and in the interest of substantial justice, the
Court has treated a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 as a
petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 particularly:
(1) if the petition for certiorari was filed within the
reglementary; period within which to file a petition for review
on certiorari', (2) when errors of judgment are averred; and
(3) when there is sufficient reason to justify the relaxation of

the rules as when there is a significant issue of jurisdiction
(City of Manila v. Grecia-Cuerdo, G.R. No. 175723, February
4, 2014).

Distinctions between certiorari under Rule 64 and certiorari
under Rule 65
1. The certiorari in Rule 64 is directed only against the
judgments, final orders or resolutions of the Commission on
Elections and Commission on Audit (Sec. 1, Rule 64, Rules
of Court). The certiorari in Rule 65 is directed against other
entities or offices which refer to any tribunal, board or officer

248

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions (Sec. 1, Rule 65,
Rules of Court).

2. The certiorari in Rule 64 is filed within 30 days from
notice of the judgment, final order or resolution (Sec. 3, Rule
64, Rules of Court). The certiorari in Rule 65 is filed within
60 days from notice of the judgment, final order or resolution
sought to be reviewed (Sec. 4, Rule 65, Rules of Court).
3. In Rule 64, the filing of a motion for reconsideration
or new trial, if allowed, interrupts the period for the filing of
a petition for certiorari. If the motion is denied, the aggrieved
party may file the petition within the remaining period, but
not less than 5 days reckoned from the notice of denial (Sec. 3,
Rule 64, Rules of Court). In Rule 65, the period within which
to file the petition, if the motion for reconsideration or new
trial is denied, is still a fresh-period of 60 days from notice of
the denial of the motion (Sec. 4, Rule 65, Rules of Court).
Examples of situations where certiorari is a remedy

1. An order denying a petition for relief is not appealable
under the terms of Sec. 1(a) of Rule 41, as amended. The
remedy is the appropriate special civil action under Rule 65,
and one remedy under said rule is certiorari.
2. An order dismissing an action without prejudice
may be the subject of a petition for certiorari (Sec. Ifg], Rule
41, Rules of Court), but an order dismissing an action with
prejudice is appealable and, hence, not a proper subject of a
petition for certiorari.

An order dismissing a complaint for failure to comply
with the rules on certification against forum shopping is
a
dismissal without prejudice. Under Sec. 1(g) of Rule 41, as
amended, such dismissal is not appealable, the remedy
being
the appropriate special civil action under Rule
65.
3. A denial of a motion to dismiss for lack
over the subject matter, and the denial of of jurisdiction
a
for
reconsideration of the order of denial (both of motion
which are

249

interlocutory orders), may be subject to certiorari where the
denial is obviously in error and, hence, may be interpreted as
a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.
4. Under the 2000 National Prosecution Service Rules
on Appeal, a resolution of the Justice Secretary affirming,
modifying or reversing the resolution of the Investigating
Prosecutor is final, and there is no more judicial appeal or
other remedy in the ordinary course of law. The remedy of the
aggrieved party is to file a petition for certiorari under Rule
65 of the Rules of Court since there is no more appeal or other
remedy available. To file an appeal with the Court of Appeals,
by way of a petition for review under Rule 43, is to resort to
an improper remedy. A petition for certiorari under Rule 65
should be filed, instead, with the Court of Appeals (Alcaraz v.
Gonzalez, 502 SCRA 518, 529-530; Tan v. Matsuura, G.R. No.
179003, January 9, 2013, cited in Spouses Gaditano v. San
Miguel Corporation, G.R. No. 188767, July 24, 2013).

On the other hand, a judgment or final order of the Court
Appeals
of
on the petition for certiorari against the Secretary
of Justice is reviewable by the Supreme Court by a petition
for review on certiorari under Rule 45, not the original action
for certiorari under Rule 65 (Sec. 1, Rule 45, Rules of Court).
A petition for certiorari filed by a city mayor before
the Court of Appeals in order to nullify the preventive
suspension order issued by the Ombudsman is in order
because the order of suspension is an interlocutory order,
hence, unappealable (Morales v. Court of Appeals, G.R. Nos.
217126-27, November 10, 2015).
5.

6. Resolutions of the Ombudsman in preliminary
investigations of criminal cases are reviewed by the Supreme
Court. The remedy from the adverse resolution of the
Ombudsman is a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, not
a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 (Enemecio
u. Office of the Ombudsman, supra; See also Republic v.
Cojuangco, Jr., 674 SCRA 492, 503-504, June 26, 2012).

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

The remedy of a party aggrieved by the decision of
the National Labor Relations Commission is to promptly move
for the reconsideration of the decision and, if denied, to timely
file a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65 within 60
days from notice of the decision (St. Martin. Funeral Home v.
NLRC, 295 SCRA 494, 508-509).
7.

In labor disputes, grave abuse of discretion may be
ascribed to the NLRC when its findings and conclusions
are not supported by substantial evidence (Bahia Shipping
Services, Inc., Fred Olsen Cruise Line v. Hipe, Jr., G.R. No.
204699, November 12, 2014; Magsaysay Maritime Corporation
v. Panogalinog, G.R. No. 212049, July 15, 2015).
8. A judgment, resolution or final order of the
Commission on Elections may be brought by the aggrieved
party to the Supreme Court on a petition for certiorari under
Rule 65 (Sec. 2, Rule 64, Rules of Court).
9. A judgment, resolution or final order of the Com¬
mission on Audit may be brought by the aggrieved party to
the Supreme Court on certiorari under Rule 65 (Sec. 2, Rule
64, Rules of Court) by filing the petition within 30 days from
notice (Sec. 3, Rule 64, Rules of Court).
10. An interlocutory order of a court is reviewable by a
petition for certiorari (Sec. 1, Rule 41, Rules of Court).
Ordinarily, the remedy against an interlocutory order
is not to resort forthwith to certiorari, but to continue with
the case in due course and, when an unfavorable verdict is
handed down, to take an appeal in the manner authorized by
law. However, where there are special circumstances clearly
demonstrating the inadequacy of an appeal, the special civil
action of certiorari may exceptionally be allowed (Angara v.
Fedman Development Corporation, G.R. No. 156822, October

18, 2004).

It has been held that, “The trial court’s denial of the
motion to dismiss is not a license for the defendant to file a
Rule 65 petition. An order denying a motion to dismiss cannot
be the subject of a petition for certiorari as the
defendant still

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 65 Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

—

has an adequate remedy before the trial court
i.e., to file
an answer and to subsequently appeal the case if he loses the
case. As exceptions, the defendant may avail of a petition for
certiorari if the ground raised in the motion to dismiss is lack
of jurisdiction over the person of the defendant or over the
subject matter” (Tung Hu Steel Enterprises, Inc. v. Ting Guan
Trading Corporation, G.R. No. 182153, April 7, 2014).
Some proceedings where certiorari is not available
1. Certiorari is not available if there is appeal, or a
plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
law (Sec. 1, Rule 65, Rules of Court). If appeal is available, an
appeal must be taken even if the ground relied upon is grave
abuse of discretion (Philippine Electric Corporation v. Court of
Appeals, G.R. No. 168612, December 10, 2014).

2. If a complaint is dismissed on the grounds of (a) res
judicata, (b) prescription, (c) extinguishment of the obligation,
or (d) unenforceability under the statute of frauds, such
dismissal shall bar the refiling of the same action or claim.
The remedy is to appeal, not certiorari (Sec. 5, Rule 41, Rules
of Court). The dismissal in any of these cases is one with
prejudice, hence, appealable.

Note: If a complaint is dismissed on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction over the subject matter or improper venue or on
grounds which do not preclude the refiling of the complaint,
such dismissal is one without prejudice and, hence, not
appealable. The remedy is the appropriate special civil action
in Rule 65 which includes certiorari (Sec. l[g], Rule 41, Rules
of Court).

3. Under the 2019 Amendments to the 1997 Rules
of Civil Procedure, petitions for certiorari, prohibition
and mandamus are not available against the following
interlocutory orders:
(a) order denying affirmative defenses (Sec. 12,
Rule 8 of the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 1910-20-SC);

— —

(b) order of the court to submit the case for judgment
(Sec. 10, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court, as amended by
A.M. No. 19-10-20-SC);

order denying the demurrer to evidence (Sec. 2,
of
Rule 33 the Rules of Court, as amended by A.M. No. 1910-20-SC);
(c)

(d) any action of the court on a motion for judgment
on the pleadings (Sec. 2, Rule 34 of the Rules of Court, as
amended by A.M. No. 19-10-20-SC); and
(e) any action of the court on a motion for summary
judgment (Sec. 3, Rule 35 of the Rules of Court, as
amended by A.M. No. 19-10-20-SC).

4. Petitions for certiorari, prohibition and mandamus
are not available against an interlocutory order in certain
cases like:
(a) petition for a writ of amparo (Sec. 1 IflJ, Rule on
the Writ of Amparo);
(b) petition for a writ of habeas data (Sec. 13(1],
Rule on the Writ of Habeas Data);
(c) small claims cases (Sec. 14fg], A.M. 08-8-7-SC);
(d) cases governed by the Rules on Summary
Procedure (Sec. 19[g], Rules on Summary Procedure).
Such petitions are likewise not allowed in forcible entry
and detainer cases (Sec. 13(7], Rule 70, Rules of Court).

(Bar 2004)

Although a petition for certiorari is prohibited in cases
subject to summary procedure, the Court, in one case,
allowed the petition because the trial court gravely abused
its discretion by indefinitely suspending the proceedings in
ejectment cases thus, acting contrary to the purposes of the
Rules on Summary Procedure. The Supreme Court recognized
that because the order of the trial court cannot be appealed
from it being interlocutory and since the proceedings are
covered by the Rules on Summary Procedure, a “procedural
void” exists. Invoking its power to suspend the rules to
promote substantial justice, the Supreme
Court gave due

263

course to the petition pro hoc vice because of the extraordinary
circumstances of the case. The Court observed that allowing
the petition would avoid the mischiefs sought to be curbed
by the Rules and would give spirit and life to the Rules on
Summary Procedure.

In Go u. Court of Appeals, 297 SCRA 574, 583, the Court
ruled:
“x x x th[e] Court holds that in situations wherein a
summary proceeding is suspended indefinitely, a petition
for certiorari alleging grave abuse of discretion may be
allowed. Because of the extraordinary circumstances in
this case, a petition for certiorari, in fact, gives spirit
and life to the Rules on Summary Procedure. A contrary
ruling would unduly delay the disposition of the case and
negate the rationale of the said Rules.”

In cases where the purpose of the petition for
certiorari is to question the merits of an arbitral award,
the petition is not available (Rule 19.7, Special ADR Rules;
Department of Environment and Natural Resources v. United
Planners Consultants, Inc., G.R. No. 212081, February 23,
5.

2015).

6. Decisions and final orders of the Sandiganbayan
shall be appealable to the Supreme Court by way of a petition
for review on certiorari under Rule 45 raising pure questions
of law. Certiorari under Rule 65 is not the remedy (Sec. 1,
Rule 45, Rules of Court; People v. Espinosa, 409 SCRA 256,
261).
7. Decisions of the Court of Appeals shall be appealable
to the Supreme Court by way of a petition for review on
certiorari under Rule 45 raising pure questions of law.
Certiorari under Rule 65 is not the remedy (Sec. 1, Rule 45,
Rules of Court).
8. Decisions of the Court of Tax Appeals en banc shall
be appealable to the Supreme Court by way of a petition for
review on certiorari under Rule 45 raising pure questions of
law. Certiorari under Rule 65 is not the remedy (Sec. 1, Rule
45, Rules of Court; Sec. 1 1, R-A. 9282).

9. A court order denying a motion for the issuance
of a writ of possession is in the nature of a final order, as it
left nothing else to be resolved thereafter. Proceeding from
this premise, petitioner’s proper remedy was, thus, to appeal
from the order. It is settled that the proper remedy to obtain
a reversal of judgment on the merits, final order or resolution
is appeal. This holds true even if the error ascribed to the
court rendering the judgment is its lack of jurisdiction over
the subject matter, or the exercise of power in excess thereof,
or grave abuse of discretion in the findings of fact or of law
set out in the decision, order or resolution. The existence
and availability of the right of appeal prohibits the resort
to certiorari because one of the requirements for the latter
remedy is the unavailability of appeal (Nuque v. Aquino, G.R.
No. 193058, July 8, 2015).
B. Prohibition (Rule 65)

Purpose and function of the action
1. The present Rules of Court uses two special civil
actions for determining and correcting grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction. These
are the special civil actions for certiorari and prohibition, and
both are governed by Rule 65. A similar remedy of certiorari
exists under Rule 64, but the remedy is expressly applicable
only to the judgments and final orders or resolutions of the
Commission on Elections and the Commission on Audit
(Araullo v. Aquino III, G.R. No. 209287, July 1, 2014).
2. Prohibition is an extraordinary writ commanding
a tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person, whether
exercising functions that are judicial, quasi-judicial or
ministerial, to desist from further proceedings when such are
conducted without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave
abuse of its discretion, there being no appeal or any other
plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of
law (Sec. 2, Rule 65, Rules of Court).
3. It is a process by which a superior court prevents
inferior courts, tribunals, officers, or persons from usurping or

266

exercising a jurisdiction with which they have not been vested
by law (City Engineer of Baguio v. Baniqued, 571 SCRA 617,
625). Stated in another way, the purpose of prohibition is to
prevent an encroachment, excess, usurpation or assumption
of jurisdiction on the part of a tribunal, corporation, board
or officer. It is granted when it is necessary for the orderly
administration of justice, or prevent the use of the strong arm
of the law in an oppressive or vindictive manner, or multiplicity
of actions (Longino v. General, 451 SCRA 423, 436).

Stated in another way, the purpose of a petition for
prohibition is to secure an order or judgment to command
the respondent tribunal, board, corporation or officer to
desist from further proceedings in the action (Sec. 2, Rule
65, Rules of Court; Ongsuco v. Malones, 604 SCRA 499, 515).
The function of prohibition is to prevent the unlawful and
oppressive exercise of legal authority and to provide for a
fair and orderly administration of justice (Spouses Yusay u.
Court of Appeals, 647 SCRA 269, 283). Where the purpose is
to secure a judgment annulling or modifying the proceedings
of a court or tribunal, the remedy is a petition for certiorari
(Sec. 1, Rule 65, Rules of Court). In essence, certiorari is a
corrective remedy while prohibition is a preventive remedy.

If, for instance, a motion to dismiss a complaint for lack
of jurisdiction over the subject matter is denied in a manner
clearly showing a grave abuse of discretion and despite a
motion for reconsideration of the order of denial, a petition for
certiorari and prohibition would be proper to annul the order
of the court (certiorari) and for the lower court to desist from
further proceeding (prohibition) in the action.

One relatively recent case sums up the nature and
function of prohibition, thus:
4.

“Prohibition is an extraordinary writ directed
against any tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person,
whether exercising judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial
functions, ordering said entity or person to desist from
further proceedings when said proceedings are without
or in excess of said entity1s or person s jurisdiction, or are

accompanied with grave abuse of discretion, and there
is no appeal or any other plain, speedy and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law. Prohibition lies
against judicial or ministerial functions, but not against
legislative or quasi-legislative functions. Generally, the
purpose of a writ of prohibition is to keep a lower court
within the limits of its jurisdiction in order to maintain the
administration of justice in orderly channels. Prohibition
is the proper remedy to afford relief against usurpation of
jurisdiction or power by an inferior court, or when, in the
exercise of jurisdiction in handling matters clearly within
its cognizance the inferior court transgresses the bounds
prescribed to it by the law, or where there is no adequate
remedy available in the ordinary course of law by which
such relief can be” (Araullo v. Aquino III, G.R. No. 209287,
July 1, 2014; For additional readings, see Southern Luzon
Drug Corporation v. Department of Social Welfare and
Development, G.R. No. 199669, April 25, 2017).

Note: In Araullo v. Aquino III, G.R. No. 209287, July
1, 2014, the Court likewise held: “x x x the petitions for
certiorari and prohibition are appropriate remedies to raise
constitutional issues and to review and/or prohibit or nullify
the acts of the legislative and executive departments.”
5. The Court also considers a petition for prohibition
as a proper remedy to prohibit acts of executive officials that
amount to usurpation of legislative authority. With this end
in view, and setting aside procedural technicalities, there are
times when a petition for declaratory relief is treated by the
Court as a petition for prohibition. Thus, in a case assailing
the validity of the impending imposition of the value-added
tax (VAT), an issue was raised on whether or not the Court
correctly treated a petition for declaratory relief as one for
prohibition.

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

Note: The same case expanded the reach of both
petitions for certiorari and prohibition. The Court ruled that
with respect to the Court, the writ of certiorari or prohibition
may apply even to respondents which do not exercise judicial,
quasi-judicial or ministerial functions. The basis of the ruling
is the definition of judicial power in Sec. 1, Art. VIII of the
Constitution. Held the Court:
“With respect to the Court, however, the remedies of
certiorari and prohibition are necessarily broader in scope
and reach, and the writ of certiorari or prohibition may
be issued to correct errors of jurisdiction committed not
only by a tribunal, corporation, board or officer exercising
judicial, quasi-judicial or ministerial functions but also
to set right, undo and restrain any act of grave abuse
of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction
by any branch or instrumentality of the Government,
even if the latter does not exercise judicial, quasi-judicial
or ministerial functions. This application is expressly
authorized by the text of the second paragraph of Section
1” (Araullo v. Aquino III, G.R. No. 209287, July 1,
2014;
Italics supplied). The basis of this pronouncement is the
definition of ‘judicial power’ under Sec. 1, Art VIII
of the
Philippine

Constitution.

257

In Diaz v. Secretary of Finance, 654 SCRA 96, 108-109, the
Court issued a resolution treating the petition denominated
as declaratory relief by the petitioners, as one for prohibition.
The Court, in Diaz, ruled that there are precedents for treating
a petition for declaratory relief as one for prohibition if the
case has far-reaching implications and raises questions that
need to be resolved for the public good. The Court also held
that a petition for prohibition is a proper remedy to prohibit
or nullify acts of executive officials that amount to usurpation
of legislative authority. Although the petition did not strictly
comply with the requirements of Rule 65, the Court has ample
power to waive such technical requirements when the legal
questions to be resolved are of great importance to the public.

For a party to be entitled to a writ of prohibition, he
must establish the following requisites:
(a) The impugned act must be that of a tribunal,
corporation, board or person exercising judicial, quasijudicial, or ministerial functions (Ongsuco u. Malones,
604 SCRA 499, 515; Sec. 2, Rule 65, Rules of Court);
1.

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

(b) The tribunal, corporation, board or person must
have acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction
(Sec. 2, Rule 65, Rules of Court);
(c) There is no appeal or any other plain, speedy,
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law
(Sec. 2, Rule 65, Rules of Court; Longino v. General, 451
SCRA 423, 436; Barbers v. COMELEC, 460 SCRA 569,
581; Montes v. Court of Appeals, 489 SCRA 432, 441;
Arimao v. Taher, 498 SCRA 74, 86; Destileria Limtuaco
& Company, Inc. v. Advertising Board of the Philippines,
572 SCRA 455, 459-460); and
(d) Like a petition for certiorari, the petition for
prohibition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy
of the judgment or order subject of the petition, copies
of all pleadings and documents relevant and pertinent

thereto, and a sworn certification of non-forum shopping
as provided in Sec. 3 of Rule 46 (Sec. 2, Rule 65, Rules of
Court).

2. In prohibition, the respondent may be one exercising
not only judicial or quasi-judicial functions but also ministerial
functions (Sec. 2, Rule 65, Rules of Court). In certiorari, the
petition is directed against one exercising judicial or quasijudicial functions (Sec. 1, Rule 65, Rules of Court).
3. A respondent is said to be exercising judicial function
when he has the power to determine what the law is and what
the legal rights of the parties are, and then undertakes to
determine these questions and adjudicate upon the rights of
the parties.

Quasi-judicial function is a term which applies to the
action and discretion of public administrative officers or
bodies, which are required to investigate facts or ascertain
the existence of facts, hold hearings, and draw conclusions
from them as a basis for their official action and to exercise
discretion of a judicial nature.

Ministerial function is one which an officer or tribunal

performs in the context of a given set

of facts, in a prescribed

manner and without regard for the exercise of his/its own
judgment upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done
(Destileria Limtuaco & Company, Inc. v. Advertising Board of
the Philippines, 572 SCRA 455, 460).
Prohibition is an original action

A special civil action of prohibition is an original and
independent action and not merely a continuation or a part
of the trial resulting in the rendition of the judgment or
order complained of. Neither is such an action ancillary or
substitute to the action for which the supervisory authority
of the appellate court is sought and directed (Mayon Estate
Corp. v. Marietta Altura, 440 SCRA 377, 387). Hence, like an
original action, the decision of a lower court on a petition for
prohibition filed before it, is appealable.
Availability of other remedies precludes resort to prohibition

Prohibition is an extraordinary remedy in the sense that
it is ordinarily available only when the usual and ordinary
proceedings at law or in equity are inadequate to afford redress
(Heirs of Sofia Nanaman Lonoy v. Secretary of Agrarian
Reform, 572 SCRA 185, 207). Being an extraordinary remedy,
prohibition cannot be resorted to when the ordinary and
usual remedies provided by law are adequate and available.
If the petitioner has another remedy like appeal, such fact is
generally held to be a sufficient reason for denying the issuance
of the writ (Delta Development & Management Services, Inc.
v. Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, 546 SCRA 240,
244). The Rules unequivocally require that before resorting to
prohibition, it must be established that “there is no appeal, or
any other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of law” (Sec. 2, Rule 65, Rules of Court).

Premature resort to prohibition
Also, the remedy of prohibition is not available against
a mere resolution expressing the desire of a Sangguniang
Panlungsod to expropriate property. At this stage, it would be

CIVIL PROCEDURE

260

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

premature for the petitioners to mount any judicial challenge
against the resolution because the power of eminent domain
could be exercised by the City only through the filing of a
verified complaint with the proper court. Before the City, as
the expropriating authority, files such verified complaint, no
expropriation proceeding could be said to exist. Until then,
the petitioners as the owners could not be deemed as having
been deprived of their property under the power of eminent
domain (Spouses Yusay v. Court of Appeals, 647 SCRA 269,
285).
Prohibition distinguished from certiorari
1. Subject to the expanded concept of both petitions, a
writ of prohibition is directed not only against a respondent
exercising judicial or a quasi-judicial functions but even against
one exercising ministerial functions. A writ of certiorari seeks
to annul acts of a respondent performing judicial or quasi¬
judicial functions (Secs. 1 and 2, Rule 65, Rules of Court).

2. A writ of prohibition is directed against the tribunal
itself commanding it to desist from further proceeding with
the case. A writ of certiorari is directed against the action of
the court which is sought to be annulled.
3. The purpose of prohibition is to command the
respondent to desist from further proceedings (Sec. 2, Rule 65,
Rules of Court). The purpose of certiorari is to annul or modify
the judgment, order, resolution or proceedings of the public
respondent (Sec. 1, Rule 65, Rules of Court).

Examples:
(a) In an action for a sum of money, the defendant
moved to dismiss the complaint for improper venue, it
being obvious that the venue was improperly laid, the
complaint having been filed in a place which was neither
the residence of the plaintiff nor that of the defendant. The
motion and the subsequent motion for reconsideration of
the order of denial were denied.

SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS

Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

261

The court, in this case, could be deemed to have
acted with grave abuse of discretion. To prevent the
court from proceeding with the case, a petition for
prohibition would be proper to command the court to
desist from further proceedings. To annul the order of
the court, the remedy would be a petition for certiorari.
To interrupt the proceedings and prevent the court from
further proceedings during the pendency of the petitions,
a prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction would be
availed of. Thus, it is not uncommon to file a petition for
certiorari and prohibition, coupled with an application
for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction. (Bar
1980)
(b) Where a motion to dismiss is wrongfully denied
under circumstances attended by a grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction, prohibition is
also a proper remedy to prevent the court from proceeding
with the action.
(c) Prohibition, not mandamus, is a proper remedy
when a motion to dismiss is wrongfully denied (Enriquez
v. Macadaeg, 84 Phil. 674, 676).

Observance of the hierarchy of courts

The filing of the petition requires observance of the
doctrine of hierarchy of courts. For instance while the Supreme
Court, Court of Appeals and Regional Trial Court have original
concurrent jurisdiction to issue writs of certiorari, prohibition
and mandamus, if what is assailed relates to acts or omissions
of a lower court or of a corporation, board, officer or person, the
petition must be filed in the Regional Trial Court exercising
jurisdiction over the territorial area as defined by the Court
(Land Bank of the Philippines u. Atlanta Industries, Inc., G.R.
No. 193796, July 2, 2014).

262

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

C. Mandamus (Bar 2012)
Nature and purpose of mandamus
1. Mandamus is an extraordinary writ commanding
a tribunal, corporation, board, officer or person to do an act
required to be done, as in the following:

he unlawfully neglects the
performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as
a duty, and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law (Sec. 3, Rule 65,
Rules of Court; See Pagdanganan v. Court of Appeals,
G.R. No. 202678, September 5, 2018). The duty referred
herein is one which results from an office, trust or station
(Sec. 3, Rule 65, Rules of Court).
(a) When it or

(b) When one unlawfully excludes another from
the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such
other is entitled and there is no other plain, speedy and
adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law (Sec. 3,
Rule 65, Rules of Court).

2. The principal function of mandamus is to command
and to expedite, not to inquire and to adjudicate (BPI Family
Savings Bank v. Manikan, 395 SCRA 373, 375). The writ of
mandamus, however, will not issue to compel an official to do
anything which is not his duty to do or which it is his duty not
to do, or to give to the applicant anything to which he is not
entitled by law. Nor will mandamus issue to enforce a right
which is in substantial dispute or as to which a substantial
doubt exists (Star Special Watchman and Detective Agency,
Inc. v. Puerto Princesa City, G.R. No. 181792, April 21, 2014).

3. Mandamus shall issue when any tribunal, corpo¬
ration, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the
performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as
a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. It is proper
when the act against which it is directed is one addressed
to the discretion of the tribunal or officer. Mandamus is not
available to direct the exercise of a judgment or discretion

in a particular way (De Castro,v. Judicial and Bar Council,
615 SCRA 666, 751; Knights of Rizal v. DMCI Homes, Inc.,
G.R. No. 213948, April 25, 2017). It is, therefore, not available
against discretionary acts (Umali v. Judicial and Bar Council,
G.R. No. 228628, July 25, 2017).
4. A recent pronouncement by the court sums up the
principles governing a petition for mandamus, thus:

“Under Section 3, Rule 65 of the Rules of Civil
Procedure, a petition for mandamus may be filed when
any tribunal, corporation, board, officer, or person
unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the
law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting from an office,
trust, or station. It may also be filed when any tribunal,
corporation, board, officer, or person unlawfully excludes
another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to

which such other is entitled.

For mandamus to lie, the act sought to be enjoined
must be a ministerial act or duty. An act is ministerial if
the act should be performed ‘[under] a given state of facts,
in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the mandate of
a legal authority, without regard to or the exercise of
[the tribunal or corporation’s] own judgment upon the
propriety or impropriety of the act done.’ The tribunal,
corporation, board, officer, or person must have no choice
but to perform the act specifically enjoined by law. This is
opposed to a discretionary act whereby the officer has the
choice to decide how or when to perform the duty” (Cudia
v. Superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy,
G.R. No. 211362, February 24, 2015; For further readings,
see Lihaylihay u. The Treasurer of the Philippines, G.R.
No. 192223, July 23, 2018).

Prayer In a petition for mandamus

In a petition for mandamus, the petitioner prays,
(a) that judgment be rendered commanding the
respondent to do the act required to be done to protect
the rights of the petitioner; and

264

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

(b) that the respondent pay the damages sustained
by the petitioner by reason of the wrongful acts of the
respondent (Sec. 3, Rule 65, Rules of Court).

Requisites for mandamus

Before the writ of mandamus is issued, the following
requisites must be complied with:
(a) The plaintiff has a clear legal right to the act
demanded. It will never be issued in doubtful cases
(Pe franco v. Moral, 322 SCRA 439, 448; See also Baguilat,
Jr. v. Alvarez, G.R. No. 227757, July 25, 2017);

Note: Mandamus does not establish a legal right,
but merely enforces one that is already clearly established
(Lim Tay v. Court of Appeals, 293 SCRA 634, 653).
(b) It must be the duty of the defendant to perform
the act because the same is mandated by law;
(c) The defendant unlawfully neglects the
performance of the duty enjoined by law;

(d) The act to be performed is ministerial, not
discretionary; and
(e) There is no appeal or any other plain, speedy
and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law (Sec.
3, Rule 65, Rules of Court).

——

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 65 Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, a clear legal right is a right
which is indubitably granted by law or inferable as a matter of
law. If the right is clear and the case is meritorious, objections
raising merely technical questions will be disregarded. But
where the right sought to be enforced is in substantial doubt
or dispute, mandamus cannot issue (Angeles v. Secretary of
Justice, 614 SCRA 478, 494).
3. For mandamus to issue, it is essential that the person
petitioning for it has a clear legal right to the claim sought. It
will not issue to enforce a right, or to compel compliance with a
duty, which is questionable or over which a substantial doubt
exists. Thus, unless the right to relief sought is unclouded, it
will be denied (Araos u. Regala, 613 SCRA 207, 215).
4. When the question is one of public right and the
object of the mandamus is to procure the enforcement of
a public duty, the people are regarded as the real party in
interest, and the relator at whose instigation the proceedings
are instituted need not show that he has any legal or special
interest in the result, it being sufficient to show that he is
a citizen and as such interested in the execution of the laws
(Francisco, Jr., et al. u. Toll Regulatory Board, et al., G.R. No.
166910, October 19, 2010).

Ministerial act versus discretionary act
The distinction between a ministerial act and a discre¬
tionary one has been delineated in the following manner:

Existence of a clear legal right
1. For a writ of mandamus to be issued, it is essential
that petitioner should have a clear legal right to the thing
demanded and it must be the imperative duty of the respondent
to perform the act required (Philippine Coconut Authority v.
Primex Coco Products, 495 SCRA 763, 777; Umali v. Judicial

and Bar Council, G.R. No. 228628, July 25, 2017).

2. The writ of mandamus can be awarded only when the
petitioners’ legal right to the performance of the particular act,
which is sought to be compelled, is clear and complete. Under

266

“The distinction between a ministerial and
discretionary act is well delineated. A purely ministerial
act or duty is one which an officer or tribunal performs in
a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience
to the mandate of a legal authority, without regard to or
the exercise of his own judgment upon the propriety or
impropriety of the act done. If the law imposes a duty
upon a public officer and gives him the right to decide
how or when the duty shall be performed, such duty is
discretionary and not ministerial. The duty is ministerial
only when the discharge of the same requires neither the

266

CIVIL PROCEDURE

—

VOLUME II

exercise of official discretion or judgment” (Espiridion
v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 146933, June 8, 2006, 490
SCRA 273 as cited in De Castro v. Judicial and Bar
Council, 615 SCRA 666, 753).

Ministerial act or duty
1. Mandamus is a writ that commands the performance
of a purely ministerial duty imposed by law (Black s Law
Dictionary, 5th Ed., 866). A duty is ministerial when it
demands no special judgment, discretion or skill. It is one
in which nothing is left to discretion and is a simple and
definite duty imposed by law (Black’s Law Dictionary, 5th Ed.,
899). Hence, mandamus will not be available to compel the
performance of a discretionary act.
Mandamus, for example, will not lie to control the
discretion of a judge or compel him to decide a motion pending
before him in a particular way (Morada v. Caluag, 5 SCRA
1128, 1130). In matters involving the exercise of judgment
and discretion, mandamus may only be resorted to, to compel
the respondent to take action; it cannot be used to direct the
manner or the particular way discretion is to be exercised
(Cuarto v. Ombudsman, 658 SCRA 580, 594). Hence, a judge
may be compelled to act and rule on the motion. (Bar 1991)

2. For the writ of mandamus to issue, the petitioner
must show that the act sought to be performed or compelled is
ministerial on the part of the respondent. An act is ministerial
when it does not require the exercise of judgment and the act is
performed pursuant to a legal mandate. The burden of proof is
on the petitioner to show that he is entitled to the performance
of a legal right, and that the respondent has a corresponding
duty to perform the act. The writ may not issue to compel an
official to do anything that is not his duty to do so, or that is
his duty not to do, or to obtain for the petitioner anything to
which he is not entitled by law (Mandanas v. Ochoa, G.R. No.
199802, July 3, 2018).

3. Mandamus is not proper against a government
school or an official with a duty that involves the exercise of

—

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 65 Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamui

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

267

discretion like on matters of admission of students (For related
readings, see University of the Philippines v. Ayson, 1 76 SCRA
571, 577; UP Board of Regents v. Ligot-Telan, 227 SCRA 342,
361-362).

4. Mandamus will not also lie to compel an academic
institution like the University of the Philippines to allow the
graduation of a student who has failed to comply with the
academic rules of the school (Magtibay v. Garcia, 120 SCRA

370, 374).

5. Mandamus is not available to compel a school to
confer upon a graduate his degree with honors (University of
San Carlos v. Court of Appeals, 166 SCRA 570, 576).

6. It was ruled that the powers to confer degrees at the
PMA, grant awards, and commission officers in the military
service are discretionary acts on the part of the President as
the AFP Commander-in-Chief. With respect to the prayer
directing the PMA to restore a cadet’s rights and entitlements
$s a full-fledged graduating cadet, including his diploma,
awards, and commission as a new Philippine Navy ensign, the
same cannot be granted in a petition for mandamus on the
basis of academic freedom. The matters raised in the petition
were within the ambit of or encompassed by the right of
academic freedom; therefore, beyond the province of the Court
to decide (Cudia v. Superintendent of the Philippine Military
Academy, G.R. No. 211362, February 24, 2015).

7. Any claim for re-correction or revision of exami¬
nation by the Professional Regulation Commission cannot
be compelled by mandamus. The function of reviewing and
re-assessing answers to the examination questions is a
discretionary function of the Medical Board, or the Board
of Accountancy as the case may be, not a ministerial and
mandatory one, hence, not within the scope of the writ of
mandamus. The obvious remedy of the petitioners from the
adverse judgment by the board concerned is an appeal to
the Professional Regulation Commission itself, and thence
to the Court of Appeals. There is an obvious undesirability
of a procedure which would allow courts to substitute their

CIVIL PROCEDURE

judgment for that of government boards in the determination
of successful examinees in any administered examination
an area in which courts have no expertise (Antolin u.
Domondon, 623 SCRA 163, 177, July 5, 2010).

appears, and (b) to follow the proper procedure for the
discharge of these persons in order that they may be utilized
as prosecution witnesses (Cuarto v. Ombudsman, 658 SCRA
580, 595-596, October 5, 201 1 ).

Where administrative remedies are available,
mandamus does not apply (Systems Plus Computer College
of Caloocan City v. Local Government of Caloocan City, 408
SCRA 494, 498). Prior resort to exhaustion of administrative
remedies, however, is not required where the questions raised
are purely legal (Madrigal v. Lecaroz, 191 SCRA 20, 26) or
when the respondent is estopped from invoking the rule of
exhaustion on administrative remedies (Vda. de Tan u.
Veterans Backpay Commission, 105 Phil. 377, 383).

If, on the basis of the same evidence, the Ombudsman
arbitrarily excludes from an indictment some individuals
while impleading all others, the remedy of mandamus lies
since he is duty-bound, as a rule, to include in the information
all persons who appear responsible for the offense involved
(Cuarto v. Ombudsman, G.R. No. 169042, October 5, 2011).

—

8.

It is axiomatic, to begin with, that a party who seeks the
intervention of a court of law upon an administrative concern
should first avail himself of all the remedies afforded by
administrative processes. The issues that an administrative
agency is authorized to decide should not be summarily
taken away from it and submitted to a court of law without
first giving the agency the opportunity to dispose of the
issues upon due deliberation. The court of law must allow
the administrative agency to carry out its functions and
discharge its responsibilities within the specialized areas of its
competence. This rests on the theory that the administrative
authority is in a better position to resolve questions addressed
to its particular expertise, and that errors committed by
subordinates in their resolution may be rectified by their
superiors if given a chance to do so (Special People, Inc.
Foundation v. Canda, et al., G.R. No. 160932, January 14,
2013).

9. Mandamus will not lie to compel a prosecutor to file
an information (Hegerty v. Court of Appeals, 409 SCRA 285,
291) because mandamus is a remedy to compel the performance
of a ministerial duty imposed by law upon a respondent.

Mandamus, however, lies to compel a prosecutor who
refuses: (a) to include in the information certain persons,
whose participation in the commission of a crime clearly

10. Mandamus will Ue to compel execution of a judgment
(Lumapas v. Tamin, 334 SCRA 391, 396), because execution
of a final and executory judgment is a matter of right (Sec. 1,
Rule 39, Rules of Court).
11. Mandamus will not Ue to compel the performance of
an act prohibited by law (Mossesgeld u. Court of Appeals, 300
SCRA 464, 468).

12. When a municipaUty fails or refuses, without
justifiable reason, to effect payment of a final money judgment
rendered against it, the claimant may avail of the remedy of
mandamus in order to compel the enactment and approval of
the necessary appropriation ordinance, and the corresponding
disbursement of municipal funds therefore (Star Special
Watchman and Detective Agency, Inc. v. Puerto Princesa City,
Mayor Edward Hagedorn, G.R. No. 181792, April 21, 2014).
13. When the court refuses to accept an amendment of
a pleading as a matter of right, mandamus may Ue. A party
may amend his pleading once as a matter of right at any time
before a responsive pleading is served (Sec. 2, Rule 10, Rules
of Court, as amended).
14. “Under the Constitution, it is mandatory for the
JBC to submit to the President the Ust of nominees to fill a
vacancy in the Supreme Court in order to enable the President
to appoint one of them within the 90-day period from the
occurrence of the vacancy. The JBC has no discretion to submit

CIVIL PROCEDURE

270

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

the list to the President after the vacancy occurs because that
shortens the 90-day period allowed by the Constitution for
the President to make the appointment. For the JBC to do
so will be unconscionable on its part, considering that it will
thereby effectively and illegally deprive the President of the
ample time granted under the Constitution to reflect on the
qualifications of the nominees named in the list of the JBC
before making the appointment.
The duty of the JBC to submit a list of nominees before the
start of the President’s mandatory 90-day period to appoint is
ministerial, but its selection of the candidates whose names
will be in the list to be submitted to the President lies within
the discretion of the JBC. The object of a petition for mandamus
should only refer to the duty to submit to the President the
list of nominees for every vacancy in the Judiciary, because in
order to constitute unlawful neglect of duty, there must be an
unjustified delay in performing that duty. For mandamus to
lie against the JBC, therefore, there should be an unexplained
delay on its part in recommending nominees to the Judiciary,
that is, in submitting the list to the President” (De Castro v.
Judicial and Bar Council, 615 SCRA 666, 752, March 17,
2010)

Discretionary acts not compellable by mandamus
1. As a rule, mandamus will not he in the absence of
any of the following grounds:
(a) that the court, officer, board, or person against
whom the action is taken unlawfully neglected the
performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins
as a duty resulting from office, trust, or station; or

(b) that such court, officer, board, or person has
unlawfully excluded petitioner/relator from the use and
enjoyment of a right or office to which he is entitled.
Neither will the extraordinary remedy of mandamus lie
to compel the performance of duties that are discretionary

in nature.

PART II — SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 66 Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

271

In a particular case, the petition of mandamus sought
an order to direct the mayor to cancel the lease contract of
petitioners with the Municipal Government and to lease the
vacated market stalls to interested persons. The court held
that the privilege of operating a market stall under license

is always subject to the police power of the city government
and may be refused or granted for reasons of public policy
and sound public administration. Being a delegated police
power falling under the general welfare clause of Section
16 of the Local Government Code, the grant or revocation of
the privilege is, therefore, discretionary in nature. (Laygo v.
Municipal Mayor of Solano, Nueva Vizcaya, G.R. No. 188448,
January 1 1, 2017).

2. The special civil action of mandamus only lies to
enforce the performance of a ministerial act or duty and not
to control the performance of a discretionary power (City of
Davao v. Olanolan, G.R. No. 181149, April 17, 2017).
3. Reconstitution is not a ministerial task. It involves
the exercise of discretion in the evaluation of evidence
presented before it. How to rule on the admission of the
reconstituted evidence cannot be compelled by mandamus
(Chua v. Court of Appeals, 411 SCRA 611, 616).
Also, the issuance by the Land Registration Authority
officials of a decree of registration is not a purely ministerial
duty in cases where they find that such would result to the
double titling of the same parcel of land (Angeles u. Secretary
of Justice, 614 SCRA 478, 495).
4. A court may be compelled by mandamus to act on a
particular complaint filed before it, but it will not lie to order
the court to decide in a particular manner and for or against
a litigant. Mandamus may lie to compel a judge to decide a
case pending before it because he has a duty to resolve a case.
However, the remedy is not available to compel a judge to
decide in favor of a particular party. (Bar 1991)

When mandamus may lie to compel discretionary acts
1. Mandamus shall issue when any tribunal,
corporation, board, officer or person unlawfully neglects the
performance of an act that the law specifically enjoins as a
duty resulting from an office, trust, or station. It is proper
when the act against which it is directed is one addressed to
the discretion of the tribunal or officer. In matters involving
the exercise of judgment and discretion, mandamus may
only be resorted to in order to compel respondent tribunal,
corporation, board, officer or person to take action, but it
cannot be used to direct the manner or the particular way
discretion is to be exercised, or to compel the retraction or
reversal of an action already taken in the exercise of judgment
or discretion (Ampatuan, Jr. v. De Lima, G.R. No. 127921,
April 3, 2003).
2. When the act sought to be performed involves the
exercise of discretion, the respondent may only be directed by
mandamus to act but not to act in one way or the other. It is,
nonetheless, available to compel action, when refused, even in
matters involving judgment and discretion, but not to direct
the exercise of judgment in a particular manner.

273

of mandamus to be used for the purpose of enforcing a mere
contract right would be a wide departure from the settled
practice in respect to the character of cases in which relief by
mandamus may be obtained (Manalo v. PAIC Savings Bank,
453 SCRA 747, 754; Lucman u. Malawi, 511 SCRA 268, 279).
Nature of the judgment in mandamus

1. A favorable judgment rendered in a special civil
action for mandamus is in the nature of a special judgment.
As such, it requires the performance of any act other than the
payment of money or the sale or delivery of real or personal
property the execution of which is governed by Sec. 11, Rule
39 of the Rules of Court. Under the said provision, “[W]hen
a judgment requires the performance of any act other than
those mentioned in the two preceding sections, a certified copy
of the judgment shall be attached to the writ of execution and
shall be served by the officer upon the party against whom
the same is rendered, or upon any other person required
thereby, or by law, to obey the same, and such party or person
may be punished for contempt if he disobeys such judgment”
(National Home Mortgage Finance Corporation v. Abayari,
602 SCRA 242, 252).

However, this rule admits of exceptions. Mandamus is the
proper remedy in cases where there is gross abuse of discretion,
manifest injustice, or palpable excess of authority (Dejuras u.
Villa, 635 SCRA 569, 578; M.A. Jimenez Enterprises, Inc. u.
Ombudsman, 650 SCRA 381, 399).

2. The respondent who receives an adverse judgment
shall be ordered to perform the act required to be done to
protect the rights of the petitioner and to pay the damages
sustained by the petitioner by reason of the wrongful acts of
the respondent (Sec. 3, Rule 65, Rules of Court).

Contractual obligations, not compellable by mandamus

Declaratory relief treated as mandamus

Mandamus cannot be availed of as a remedy to enforce
the performance of contractual obligations. No rule of law is
better settled than that mandamus does not lie to enforce the
performance of contractual obligations. It was not intended
to aid a plaintiff in the enforcement of a mere contract right,
or to take the place of the other remedies provided by law
for the adjudication of disputed claims. To permit the writ

As earlier discussed under the topic “declaratory relief,”
the court may treat a petition for declaratory relief as one for
mandamus if the issue involved has far-reaching implications
(Gamboa v. Teves, 652 SCRA 690).

D. Writ of Continuing Mandamus/Writ
ofKalikasan (Rules of Procedure
for Environmental Cases)

DI. Writ of continuing mandamus
(Bar 2015, 2016)

The case

(

The concept of “continuing mandamus" gained promi¬
nence in the case of MMDA v. Concerned Residents of Manila
Bay, G.R. Nos. 171947-48, December 18, 2008.
This case started when the respondents, Concerned
Residents of Manila Bay, filed a complaint before the
Regional Trial Court (RTC) in Imus, Cavite against several
government agencies, among them the petitioners, for the
clean up, rehabilitation, and protection of the Manila Bay.
In their individual causes of action, respondents alleged that
the continued neglect of petitioners in abating the pollution
of the Manila Bay constitutes a violation of environmental
laws. Inter alia, respondents, as plaintiffs a quo, prayed that
petitioners be ordered to clean the Manila Bay and submit to
the RTC a concerted concrete plan of action for the purpose.
The RTC rendered a decision in favor of the respondents.
The petitioners, before the Court of Appeals, were one in
arguing, among others, that the cleaning of the Manila Bay is
not a ministerial act which can be compelled by mandamus.
The Court of Appeals, however, sustained the RTC.

The same issue was also raised in the Supreme Court
where the petitioners maintained that the duty to take
measures and maintain adequate solid waste and liquid
disposal systems necessarily involves policy evaluation and
the exercise of judgment on the part of the agency concerned.
They argued that the petitioners, specifically the MMDA, in
carrying out its mandate, has to make decisions, including
choosing where a landfill should be located by undertaking
feasibility studies and cost estimates, all of which entail the
exercise of discretion.

Certiorari, Prohibition and Mandamus

Respondents, on the other hand, countered that the
statutory command is clear and that petitioners’ duty to
comply with and act according to the clear mandate of the law
does not require the exercise of discretion; that the MMDA
in particular, is without discretion to choose which bodies of
water they are to clean up, or which discharge or spill they
are to contain. By the same token, they also maintained
that petitioners are bereft of discretion on whether or not to
alleviate the problem of solid and liquid waste disposal; in
other words, it is the MMDA’s ministerial duty to attend to
such services.

The Supreme Court agreed with the respondents
declaring that the petitioners’ obligation to perform their
duties as defined by law, on one hand, and how they are to
carry out such duties, on the other, are two different concepts.
While the implementation of the MMDA’s mandated tasks
may entail a decision- making process, the enforcement of the
law or the very act of doing what the law exacts to be done is
.ministerial in nature and may be compelled by mandamus.
A discretionary duty is one that “allows a person to exercise
judgment and choose to perform or not to perform.” Any
suggestion that the MMDA has the option whether or not to
perform its solid waste disposal-related duties ought to be
dismissed for want of legal basis.
The heads of petitioners-agencies MMDA, DENR,
DepEd, DOH, DA, DPWH, DBM, PCG, PNP Maritime Group,
DILG, and also of MWSS, LWUA, and PPA, in line with the
principle of “continuing mandamus," were required, from
finality of the decision, to each submit to the Court a quarterly
progressive report of the activities undertaken in accordance
with this decision.
Meaning of continuing mandamus
Continuing mandamus is a writ issued by a court in an
environmental case directing any agency or instrumentality
of the government or officer thereof to perform an act or series
of acts decreed by final judgment which shall remain effective

276

until judgment is fully satisfied (Sec. 4[c], Rule I, Part I, Rules
of Procedure for Environmental Cases, A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC).
When the writ is available

1. The writ is available when any agency, instrumen¬
tality of the government, or officer thereof:
(a) unlawfully neglects the performance of an act
which the law specifically enjoins as a duty resulting
from an office, trust or station in connection with the
enforcement or violation of an environmental law rule or
regulation or a right therein; or

(b) unlawfully excludes another from the use or
enjoyment of such right (Sec. 1, Rule 8, Part III, Rules of
Procedure for Environmental Cases).

2. In any of the above instances, there must be a
showing that there is no other plain, speedy and adequate
remedy in the ordinary course of law (Sec. 1, Rule 8, Part III,
Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).
Who may file the petition

The petition shall be filed by the person aggrieved by the
unlawful acts or omissions of the respondent (Sec. 1, Rule 8,
Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).
There is a difference between a petition for the issuance
of a writ of kalikasan and a petition for the issuance of a
writ of continuing mandamus. In the former, it is sufficient
that the petition is filed by a person who represents the
inhabitants prejudiced by the environmental damage subject
of the petition. In the latter, it is necessary that the petition
be filed by one personally aggrieved by the unlawful acts or
omissions of the respondent (Segovia v. The Climate Change
Commission, G.R. No. 211010, March 7, 2017).

277

supporting evidence, specifying that the petition concerns
an environmental law, rule or regulation, and praying that
judgment be rendered commanding the respondent to do an
act or series of acts until the judgment is fully satisfied, and
to pay damages sustained by the petitioner by reason of the
malicious neglect to perform the duties of the respondent,
under the law, rules or regulations. The petition shall also
contain a sworn certification of non-forum shopping (Sec. 1,
Rule 8, Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).
Where to file the petition
The petition shall be filed with the: (a) Regional Trial
Court exercising jurisdiction over the territory where the
actionable neglect or omission occurred, (b) Court of Appeals,
or (c) Supreme Court (Sec. 2, Rule 8, Part III, Rules of Procedure
for Environmental Cases). (Bar 2015)

No docket fees

There are no docket fees to be paid. The petitioner shall
be exempt from the payment thereof (Sec. 3, Rule 8, Part III,
Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).
Action of the court when the petition is filed

1. When the petition is duly filed, the court may: (a)
issue such orders to expedite the proceedings, and (b) also
grant a Temporary Environmental Protection Order (TEPO)
for the preservation of the rights of the parties pending such
proceedings (Sec. 5, Rule 8, Part III, Rules of Procedure for
Environmental Cases).

2. The TEPO is granted if it appears that the matter
is of extreme urgency and the applicant will suffer grave
injustice and irreparable injury (Sec. 8, Rule 2, Part II, Rules
of Procedure for Environmental Cases).

Form and contents of the petition

Order to comment

The petition filed by the person aggrieved shall be verified.

Proceedings after comment is filed

Comments of petitioner

1. After the comment is filed or the time for the filing
thereof has expired, the court has options, to wit:

The petitioner may submit its comments or observations
on the execution of the judgment (Sec. 7, Rule 8, Part III, Rules
of Procedure for Environmental Cases).

(a) The court may hear the case. If it does so decide
to conduct a hearing, the rule requires that it be summary
in nature (Sec. 6, Rule 8, Part III, Rules of Procedure for
Environmental Cases).

(b) The court may, however, opt to merely require
the parties to submit memoranda (Sec. 6, Rule 8, Part III,
Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).

2. The petition shall be resolved without delay within
60 days from the date of the submission of the petition for
resolution (Sec. 6, Rule 8, Part III, Rules of Procedure for

(a) grant the privilege of the writ of continuing
mandamus requiring the respondent to perform an act or
series of acts until the judgment is fully satisfied; and
(b) grant such other reliefs as may be warranted
resulting from the wrongful or illegal acts of the
respondent (Sec. 7, Rule 8, Part HI, Rules of Procedure
for Environmental Cases).

2. The court shall also require the respondent to
submit periodic reports detailing the progress and execution

Return of the writ; final return

Upon full satisfaction of the judgment, the respondent
shall make a final return of the writ to the court which rendered
the judgment by the respondent. If the court finds that the
judgment has been fully implemented, the satisfaction of
judgment shall be entered in the court docket (Sec. 8, Rule 8,
Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).

D2. Writ of Kalikasan (Bar 2015, 2016, 2018)

any public interest group accredited by or registered with
any governmental agency (Sec. I, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of
Procedure for Environmental Cases, A.M. No. 09-6-8-SC).

2. The petition for the writ may be filed not only on
one’s personal behalf but also on behalf of persons whose
constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology
is violated (Sec. 1, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for

Environmental Cases).

Requisites for the writ to be available

For a petition for writ of kalikasan to prosper, the
following requisites must concur:
1. There is an actual violation of the constitutional
right to a balanced and healthful ecology is not required
before the writ may be availed of. It is sufficient that the right
is threatened with a violation (Sec. 1, Rule 7, Part HI, Rules of
Procedure for Environmental Cases).
2. The violation or threatened violation is caused by an
unlawful act or omission and the one responsible for such is
any of the following:
(a) public official;

(b) public employee;
(c)

private individual; or

(d) private entity (Sec. 1, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of
Procedure for Environmental Cases).
3. The unlawful act or omission involves an environ¬
mental damage of such magnitude as to prejudice the life,
health or property of inhabitants in two or more cities or prov¬
inces (Sec. 1, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environ¬
mental Cases; Segovia v. The Climate Change Commission,
G.R. No. 211010, March 7, 2017).
A mere repeated invocation of a violation of the
constitutional right to health and a balanced and healthful
ecology is not sufficient. The petitioner must show that the
respondent has violated or would be violating a law, rule or
regulation that would affect the people’s right to a balanced
and healthful ecology (Segovia v. The Climate Change
Commission, G.R. No. 211010, March 7, 2017).

Verified petition; contents
1. The rule requires that the petition be verified and
contain the personal circumstances of the petitioner.

evidence (Sec. 2, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for
Environmental Cases).

The petition shall also contain the equivalent of a
certification against forum shopping. The certification, which
shall be under oath, shall state that:
(a) the petitioner has not commenced any action or
filed any claim involving the same issues in any court,
tribunal or quasi-judicial agency, and no such other
action or claim is pending therein;
(b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a
complete statement of its present status; and
(c) if the petitioner should learn that the same or
similar action or claim has been filed or is pending, he

by the court (Sec. 6, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for
Environmental Cases).
2. The writ shall first be served personally upon the
respondent. In case the writ cannot be served personally, the
rule on substituted service shall apply (Sec. 6, Rule 7, Part III,
Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases). The substituted
service referred to is Sec. 6 of Rule 14 of the Rules of Court, as

the date of the filing of the petition. Such order, however, shall
not be issued as a matter of course. It shall be issued only if
the petition is sufficient in form and substance (Sec. 5, Rule 7,
Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).

A court officer or deputized person who: (a) unduly delays,
br (b) refuses to serve the writ shall be punished for contempt
without prejudice to other civil, criminal or administrative
actions (Sec. 7, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for
Environmental Cases).

Duty of the clerk of court

Return of respondent; non-extendible

Upon receipt of the order of the court, the clerk of court
shall issue the writ of kalikasan under the seal of the court
including the issuance of a cease and desist order and other
temporary reliefs which shall be effective until further orders
(Sec. 5, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental
Cases).
Penalty for refusing to issue the writ

1. Recall that the court, upon finding the petition
sufficient in form and substance, shall issue an order not only
for the issuance of the writ but also for filing of the verified
return by the respondent (Sec. 5, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of
Procedure for Environmental Cases). This verified return shall
be filed by the respondent within a period of 10 days after
service of the writ (Sec. 8, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure
for Environmental Cases).

If the clerk of court either (a) unduly delays, or (b) refuses
to issue the writ after its allowance by the court, he shall be
punished by the court for contempt without prejudice to other
civil, criminal or administrative actions (Sec. 7, Rule 7, Part
III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).

The period to file a return is non-extendible (Sec. 8, Rule
7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases). A
motion for extension of time to file a return is prohibited (Sec.
9[b], Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental
Cases).

VOLUME II

2. The respondent cannot delay the filing of a return
on the pretext that the petition contains matters which are
not averred with sufficient definiteness or clarity because a
motion for bill of particulars is a prohibited motion (Sec. 9fdJ,
Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).
A motion for postponement is, likewise, not allowed (Sec. 9[c],
Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).
Contents of the verified return of respondent

1. The verified return shall contain all defenses to show
that the respondent did not: (a) violate, (b) threaten to violate,
(c) allow the violation of any environmental law, rule or
regulation, or (d) commit any act resulting to environmental
damage of such magnitude as to prejudice the life, health
or property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces
(Sec. 8, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental
Cases).

The defenses must be contained in the return and a
general denial of the allegations in the petition shall be
considered as an admission thereof (Sec. 8, Rule 7, Part III,
Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).
2. The return shall include affidavits of witnesses,
documentary evidence, scientific or other expert studies, and,
if possible, object evidence, in support of the defense of the
respondent (Sec. 8, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for
Environmental Cases).

Waiver of defenses

All defenses not raised in the return shall be deemed
waived (Sec. 8, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for Envi¬
ronmental Cases).
Effect of failure to file the return

The respondent cannot be declared in default
for failure to file a return because a motion to declare the
respondent in default is a prohibited motion (Sec. 9fh], Rule 7,
Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).

2. In case the respondent fails to file a return, the court
shall proceed to hear the petition ex parte (Sec. 10, Rule 7,
Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).

The respondent is not allowed to file a motion to
petition, instead of filing a return, because it is
the

Contempt proceedings

1. The respondent who: (a) refuses, (b) unduly delays
filing
of a return, or (c) makes a false return may, after
the
hearing, be punished for indirect contempt under Rule 71 of
the Rules of Court (Sec. 13, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure
for Environmental Cases).

2. The same contempt proceedings may apply to any
person who: (a) disobeys, or (b) resists a lawful process or
order of the court (Sec. 13, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure
for Environmental Cases).
Preliminary conference; modes of discovery
1. Upon receipt of the return of the respondent, the
court may call a preliminary conference in order to: (a) simplify
the issues, and (b) determine the possibility of obtaining
stipulations or admissions from the parties (Sec. 11, Rule 7,
Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases). The
phraseology of the rule discloses that a preliminary hearing is
not mandatory. The term “may” confers the discretion to call
a preliminary conference upon the court.

2. A party may file a motion for certain reliefs. The
motion must be verified. Such reliefs are:
(a) Ocular inspection order; and
(b) Production or inspection of documents or things
(See Sec. 12, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for
Environmental Cases).

habeas corpus, amparo and habeas data (Sec. 11, Rule 7, Part
III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases).
Submission of case for decision; submission of memoranda

After hearing, the court shall issue an order submitting
the case for decision. The court may, however, require the
filing of memoranda within a non-extendible period of 30

The court shall render judgment within 60 days from the.
time the petition is submitted for decision. The judgment shall
either grant or deny the privilege of the writ of kalikasan (Sec.
15, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure for Environmental
Cases).
Reliefs which the court may grant under the writ

The following reliefs may be granted under a writ of
kalikasan:
(a) Directing the respondent

to permanently

cease and desist from committing acts or neglecting the

performance of a duty in violation of environmental laws
resulting in environmental destruction or damage;
(b) Directing the respondent public official, gov¬
ernment agency, private person or entity to protect, pre¬

serve, rehabilitate or restore the environment;
(c)

Directing the respondent public official, govern¬
ment agency, private person or entity to monitor strict
compliance with the decision and orders of the court;

287

(d) Directing the respondent public official, govern¬

the people to a balanced and healthful ecology or to the
protection, preservation, rehabilitation or restoration
of the environment, except the award of damages to
individual petitioners (Sec. 15, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of
Procedure for Environmental Cases).

Appeal

A party may appeal to the Supreme Court under Rule 45 of
the Rules of Court within 15 days from the date of notice of the
adverse judgment or denial of the motion for reconsideration.
The appeal may raise questions of fact (Sec. 16, Rule 7, Part

Rule 66
QUO WARRANTO

Nature and purpose of the action

1. A quo warranto proceeding is generally defined
as an action against a person who usurps, intrudes into,
or unlawfully holds or exercises a public office (Tecson u.
COMELEC, 424 SCRA 277, 326) or even a public franchise
(Sec. 1, Rule 66, Rules of Court).

2. Under Sec. 1 of Rule 66, it is specifically described as
an action for the usurpation of a public (a) office, (b) position,
or (c) franchise that is commenced by a verified petition in the
name of the Republic of the Philippines.
Quo warranto distinguished from mandamus

A quo warranto proceeding is brought against the holder
of the office, who is the person claiming the office as against
the petitioner. In mandamus, the suit is brought against
the person who is responsible for unlawfully excluding the
petitioner from office, like an appointing authority (See
Cornejo v. Gabriel, 41 Phil. 188, 189). (Bar 2001)
A petition generally brought in the name of the Republic;
verified petition

Under the Rules of Court, quo warranto is a special
civil action commenced in the name of the Republic of the
Philippines by a verified petition (Sec. 1, Rule 66, Rules of
Court). In certain instances, however, the petition may be
brought by an individual in his own name if he claims to

exercised by another (Sec. 5, Rule 66, Rules of Court).
Against whom petition may be brought

1. The petition for the usurpation of a public office,
position or franchise may be brought against any of the
following:
(a) person;

(b) public officer; or
(c)

association.
2. If brought against a person, said person is one who
usurps, intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises a public
office, position or franchise. This person may be any person,
including a public officer. (Bar 2018)
If filed against a public officer, said officer is one does or
suffers an act which, by the provision of law, constitutes a
ground for the forfeiture of his office.
If filed against an association, it is one which acts as
a corporation within the Philippines without being legally
incorporated or without lawful authority to do so (Sec. 1, Rule
66, Rules of Court).
3. The special civil action of quo warranto is a
prerogative writ by which the Government can call upon
any person to show by what warrant he holds a public
office or exercises a public franchise. It is settled that “the
determination of the right to the exercise of a franchise, or
whether the right to enjoy such privilege has been forfeited
by non-user, is more properly the subject of the prerogative
writ of quo warranto, the right to assert which, as a rule,
belongs to the State ‘upon complaint or otherwise,’ the reason
being that the abuse of a franchise is a public wrong and not
a private injury.” A forfeiture of a franchise will have to be

declared in a direct proceeding for the purpose brought by the
State because a franchise is granted by law and its unlawful
exercise is primarily a concern of Government. Quo warranto

291

is specifically available as a remedy if it is thought that a
government corporation has offended against its corporate
charter or misused its franchise (Divinagracia v. Consolidated
Broadcasting System, Inc., et al., G.R. No. 162272, April 7,
2009).

Who may commence the petition

The petition can be commenced by the: (a) Solicitor
General, or (b) a public prosecutor (Sec. 2, Rule 66, Rules of
Court), or (c) a private person (Sec. 5, Rule 66, Rules of Court).

Under Sec. 1 of Rule 66, “an action for the usurpation
of a public office, position or franchise may be brought in
the name of the Republic of the Philippines against a person
who usurps, intrudes into, or unlawfully holds or exercises
public office, position or franchise.” Even while the action is
maintained in the name of the Republic, the Solicitor General
or a public prosecutor is obliged to commence such action
upon complaint, and upon good reason to believe that any case
specified under Sec. 1 of Rule 66 can be established by proof
(Divinagracia v. Consolidated Broadcasting System, Inc., et
al., G.R. No. 162272, April 7, 2009).
When the action must be commenced (by the government)

When directed by the President of the Philippines, or
when upon complaint or otherwise he has good reason to
believe that any case specified in the Rules can be established
by proof, the Solicitor General or the public prosecutor must
commence the action (Sec. 2, Rule 66, Rules of Court).
When the action may be commenced with the permission of
the court

1. The Solicitor General or public prosecutor may bring
the action at the request and upon the relation of another
person with the permission of the court in which the action is
to be commenced (Sec. 3, Rule 66, Rules of Court).
2. In the above situation, the officer bringing the action
may first require an indemnity for the expenses and costs

292

of the action. Such indemnity, which shall be in an amount
approved by the court and deposited with it, shall be provided
by the person at whose request and upon whose relation the
action is brought (Sec. 3, Rule 66, Rules of Court).

3. When the application is made for permission to
commence such action, the court shall direct that notice be
sent to the respondent so that he may be given the opportunity
to be heard and to oppose the application (Sec. 4, Rule 66,
Rules of Court).
If the permission is granted, the court shall issue an
order to that effect. Copies of such order shall be served on
all the interested parties. The petition shall then be filed
within the period ordered by the court (Sec. 4, Rule 66, Rules
of Court).
When an individual may commence the action

1. The petition may also be commenced by a person in
his own name other than by the Solicitor General or public
prosecutor (Sec. 5, Rule 66, Rules of Court).

However, not any person may file the petition for quo
warranto. The person authorized to file the same is the one
who claims to be entitled to a public office or position which
was usurped or unlawfully held or exercised by another person
(Sec. 5, Rule 66, Rules of Court).

Section 5 of Rule 66 teaches:
“A person claiming to be entitled to a public office
or position usurped or unlawfully held or exercised by

another may bring an action therefor in his own name”
(See also Liban v. Gordon, 593 SCRA 68, 76).

2. The private person, as petitioner, may maintain
the action without the intervention of the Solicitor General
(Navarro v. Gimenez, 10 Phil. 226, 228-229). In bringing a
petition for quo warranto, he must show that he has a clear
right to the office allegedly being held by another (Cuevas v.
Bacal, 347 SCRA 338, 355).

293

Thus, one who does not claim to be entitled to the office
allegedly usurped or unlawfully held or exercised by another
cannot question his title thereto by quo warranto. Mere
assertion of a right to be appointed to the office is not sufficient
regardless of the alleged flaws in the title of respondent
(Cuyegkeng v. Cruz, 108 Phil. 1147, 1158).
Allegations when the petition is filed against a usurper;
parties

1. When the action is against a person for usurping a
public office, position or franchise, the petition shall set forth:
(a) the name of the person who claims to be entitled thereto,
if any; (b) the petitioner’s right to the same; and (c) unlawful
possession of the office, position or franchise by the respondent
(Sec. 6, Rule 66, Rules of Court).

2. All persons who claim to be entitled to the public
office, position or franchise may be made parties. In the same
action, the court shall determine their respective rights to
such public office, position or franchise (Sec. 6, Rule 66, Rules
of Court).

Jurisdiction and venue (Bar 1991)

The quo warranto petition described in the first six
sections of Rule 66 can be brought only in the Supreme Court,
Court of Appeals, or Regional Trial Court. If it is brought in
the Regional Trial Court, it shall be that which has jurisdiction
over the territorial area where the respondent or any of the
respondents resides (Sec. 7, Rule 66, Rules of Court).
However, when the action is commenced by the Solicitor
General, the petition may be brought in the Regional Trial
Court of the City of Manila, the Court of Appeals or the
Supreme Court (Sec. 7, Rule 66, Rules of Court).
Quo warranto in the Sandiganbayan

In certain cases, the petition may be brought in the
Sandiganbayan. P.D. 1606, as amended by R.A. 8249, Sec. 4
provides:

•

“The Sandiganbayan shall have exclusive original
jurisdiction over petitions for the issuance of the writs
of mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, habeas corpus,
injunctions, and other ancillary writs and processes in aid
of its appellate jurisdiction and over petitions of similar
nature, including quo warranto, arising or that may
arise in cases filed or which may be filed under Executive
Order Nos. 1, 2, 14 and 14-A, issued in 1986: Provided,
That the jurisdiction over these petitions shall not be
exclusive of the Supreme Court” (Italics and emphasis
supplied).

Quo warranto under the Omnibus Election Code
1. Under the Omnibus Election Code, a petition for quo
warranto may be brought in the COMELEC, Regional Trial
Court, or Metropolitan or Municipal Trial Court, as the case
may be. Section 253 of the Code provides, thus:

—

“Section 253. Petition for quo warranto. Any voter
contesting the election of any Member of the Batasang
Pambansa, regional, provincial, or city officer on the
ground of ineligibility or of disloyalty to the Republic
of the Philippines shall file a sworn petition for quo
warranto with the Commission within ten days after the
proclamation of the results of the election.
Any voter contesting the election of any municipal
barangay
officer on the ground of ineligibility or of
or

disloyalty to the Republic of the Philippines shall file a
sworn petition for quo warranto with the regional trial
court or metropolitan or municipal trial court, respectively,
within ten days after the proclamation of the results of
the election” (Italics supplied).

Note: Under Sec. 253, a quo warranto proceeding may be
filed with the MTC when the election of a barangay officer is

contested.
2. The Court, however, ruled that where the issue
is the qualification of an elected member of the House of
Representatives, a quo warranto petition is deemed correctly

filed with the House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal
(HRET).
The case of Fernandez u. HRET is instructive. Here, the
COMELEC dismissed for lack of merit the petition of the private
respondent seeking to disqualify a candidate for representative
of Laguna. Later, the petitioner was proclaimed as the duly
elected representative of the legislative district. The private
respondent then filed a petition for quo warranto before the
HRET “praying that the petitioner be declared ineligible
to hold office as a Member of the House of Representatives
representing the First Legislative District of the Province of
Laguna, and that petitioner’s election and proclamation be
annulled and declared null and void.” The private respondent’s
main ground for the quo warranto petition was that petitioner
lacked the required one-year residency provided under Art.
VI, Sec. 6 of the 1987 Constitution.
On the procedural issue, the Court unequivocally ruled:
XXX

“x x x The first issue is procedural and involves the
jurisdiction of the HRET vis-a-vis that of the COMELEC
in cases involving the qualification of Members of the
House of Representatives. Petitioner suggests that the
matters raised in HRET Case No. 07-034 were already
passed upon by the COMELEC in SPA No. 07-046 (PES),
thus the HRET should have dismissed the case for forum¬
shopping.
[The Court] do[es] not agree. The 1987 Constitution
explicitly provides under Article VI, Section 17 thereof
that the HRET and the Senate Electoral Tribunal (SET)
shall be the sole judges of all contests relating to the
election, returns, and qualifications of their respective
members. The authority conferred upon the Electoral
Tribunal is full, clear and complete. The use of the word
sole emphasizes the exclusivity of the jurisdiction of these
Tribunals, which is conferred upon the HRET and the
SET after elections and the proclamation of the winning
candidates. A candidate who has not been proclaimed and
who has not taken his oath of office cannot be said to be a
member of the House of Representatives.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

,

Thus, private respondent correctly pointed out
that a petition for quo warranto is within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the HRET, and cannot be considered forum¬
shopping even if, as in this case, the COMELEC had
already passed upon in administrative or quasi-judicial
proceedings the issue of the qualification of the Member
of the House of Representatives while the latter was
still a candidate” (Fernandez v. House of Representatives
Electoral Tribunal, 608 SCRA 733, 752-753).

Quo warranto in the Omnibus Election Code (elective office)
distinguished from a quo warranto in an appointive office

The following are the distinctions between quo warranto
elective office and quo warranto in an appointive office:
an
in
(a) In the first, the governing law is the Election
Law; in the second, the rules that govern are the
provisions of the Rules of Court.
(b) In the first, the issue is the eligibility or

ineligibility of the person elected or his loyalty or
disloyalty to the Republic (Sec. 253, Omnibus Election
Code); in the second, the issue is the legality or illegality
of the occupancy of the office by virtue of an appointment.

In the first, the petition is filed within 10 days
after the proclamation of the results of the election (Sec.
253, Omnibus Election Code); in the second, it is filed
within one (1) year from the time the cause of ouster, or
the right of the petitioner to hold the office or position,
arose (Sec. 11, Rule 66, Rules of Court).
(c)

(d) In the first, the petition is brought in the
Comelec, Regional Trial Court or Municipal Trial Court,
as the case may be (Sec. 253, Omnibus Election Code); in
the second, the petition is brought in the Supreme Court,
Court of Appeals or Regional Trial Court (Sec. 7, Rule 66,

Rules of Court).
(e) In the first, the petitioner may be any voter
even if he is not entitled to the office (Sec. 253, Omnibus

— —

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 66 Quo Warranto

297

Election Code); in the second, the petitioner is the person
claiming to be entitled to the office (Sec. 5, Rule 66, Rules
of Court).
(f) In the first case where the person elected
is ineligible, the court cannot declare that candidate
occupying the second place as elected, even if he were
eligible, since the law only authorizes a declaration of
election in favor of the person obtaining the plurality of
votes. In the second case, the court determines who is
legally appointed, and can and ought to declare the person
entitled to occupy the office (Nuval v. Guray, 52 Phil. 645,
654 on the Resolution of the Motion for Reconsideration).

The above paragraph must be deemed modified by
the ruling of the Court in Maquiling u. COMELEC which
recognizes that the winner in an election is the qualified
candidate with the most number of votes if the candidate who
garnered the highest number of votes is actually ineligible for
the office. The rule, therefore, precludes the application of the
rule on succession in Sec. 44 of the Local Government Code
providing for the succession of the official next in rank in case
of a permanent vacancy in the highest office.

The case holds that when the law requires certain
qualifications to be possessed or that certain disqualifications
be not possessed by persons desiring to serve as elective public
officials, those qualifications must be met before one even
becomes a candidate. When a person who is not qualified is
voted for and eventually garners the highest number of votes,
even the will of the electorate expressed through the ballot
cannot cure the defect in the qualifications of the candidate.
Even if the ineligible candidate receives the highest number of
votes, such votes cast are not considered at all in determining
the winner of an election. The winner in the election is the
candidate who garnered the highest number of votes among
the qualified candidates (Maquiling u. COMELEC, G.R. No.
195649, April 16, 2013; For related readings, see Amado u.
COMELEC, G.R. No. 210164, August 18, 2015).

CIVIL PROCEDURE

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 66 — Quo Warranto

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Quo warranto distinguished from an election protest
1. As a general rule, the proper remedy after the
proclamation of the winning candidate for the position
contested would be to file a regular election protest or quo

warranto (Espidol v. COMELEC, 472 SCRA 380, 410).
However, a quo warranto petition in an election of public
officials should not be confused with an election protest. The
cause of action in the first is the eligibility of the candidate
or lack of it, or his being disloyal to the Republic (Sec. 253,
Omnibus Election Code; See also Fortuno v. Palma, 156
SCRA 691, 699). The cause of action in an election protest is
the irregularity in the conduct of the elections (Lokin, Jr. v.
COMELEC, 621 SCRA 385, 399).
Lokin, Jr. explains:
“An election protest proposes to oust the winning
candidate from office. It is strictly a contest between
the defeated and the winning candidates, based on
the grounds of electoral frauds and irregularities, to
determine who between them has actually obtained the
majority of the legal votes cast and is entitled to hold the
office. It can only be filed by a candidate who has duly
filed a certificate of candidacy and has been voted for in
the preceding elections.
A special civil action for quo warranto refers to
questions of disloyalty to the State, or of ineligibility of the
winning candidate. The objective of the action is to unseat
the ineligible person from the office, but not to install
the petitioner in his place. Any voter may initiate the
action, which is, strictly speaking, not a contest where the
parties strive for supremacy because the petitioner will
not be seated even if the respondent may be unseated.”
(For further readings, see Torres-Gomez v. Codilla, Jr.,
668 SCRA 600, 613, March 20, 2012).

2. A controversy where the petitioner is seeking to be
seated as the second nominee of a party list organization is
neither an election protest nor a quo warranto proceeding
(Lokin, Jr. v. COMELEC, 621 SCRA 385, 399).

299

Period for filing (Bar 1980)
An action for quo warranto by reason of ouster from a
public office shall be filed within one year after the cause of
such ouster, or the right of the petitioner to hold such office or
position, arose (Sec. 11, Rule 66, Rules of Court).
Judgment in quo warranto proceedings

1. In case of usurpation of a public office, when the
respondent is found guilty of usurping, intruding into, or
unlawfully holding or exercising a public office, position or
franchise, the judgment shall include the following:
(a) The respondent shall be ousted and excluded
from the office;

(b) The petitioner or relator, as the case may be,
shall recover his costs; and
(c) Such further judgment determining the
respective rights in and to the public office, position or

franchise of all the parties to the action as justice requires
(Sec. 9, Rule 66, Rules of Court).
2. The court may render judgment for costs against
either the petitioner, relator, or respondent, or the person
or persons claiming to be a corporation. The court may also
apportion the costs, as justice requires (Sec. 12, Rule 66, Rules
of Court).
Rights of persons adjudged entitled to public office
1.

The person adjudged to be entitled to the public

office may exercise the following rights after taking his oath
of office and executing the required bond:
(a) take upon himself the execution of the office;
(b) immediately thereafter demand of the respon¬
dent all the books and papers in the respondent’s custody
or control appertaining to the office to which the judg¬
ment relates (Sec. 10, Rule 66, Rules of Court).

300

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

2. If the respondent refuses or neglects to deliver any
book or paper pursuant to such demand, he may be punished
for contempt as having disobeyed a lawful order of the court
(Sec. 10, Rule 66, Rules of Court). Note: A disobedience to a
lawful order of a court is cause for an indirect contempt. This
contempt is punished after a charge in writing has been filed,
and an opportunity given to the respondent to be heard (Sec.
3[b], Rule 71, Rules of Court).
3. The person adjudged entitled to the office may
also recover the damages sustained by him by reason of the
usurpation (Sec. 10, Rule 66, Rules of Court).
Period to claim damages

If the petitioner is adjudged to be entitled to the office, he
may sue for damages against the alleged usurper within one
year from the entry of judgment establishing his right to the
office in question (Sec. 11, Rule 66, Rules of Court).
Quo warranto against corporations

1. Although a quo warranto proceeding may be brought
against an association which acts as a corporation within the
Philippines without being legally incorporated or without
lawful authority so to act (Sec. IfcJ, Rule 66, Rules of Court),
the petition may be brought only against a de facto corporation,
not a de jure corporation. The latter corporation has no defect
in its incorporation and exercises corporate powers because it
was organized in full compliance with the laws (Black’s Law
Dictionary, 5th Ed., 382). There, is therefore, no reason to
attack its existence and its exercise of corporate powers.

2. A de facto corporation is one which, in good faith,
claims to be a corporation being organized pursuant to a valid
law, and assumes corporate powers because it was issued a
certificate of incorporation. Traditionally, it has been referred
to as a corporation which exists in fact but not in law.
Under the Corporation Code, the due incorporation of any
corporation claiming in good faith to be a corporation under

—

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 66 Quo Warranto

—

301

such Code, and its right to exercise corporate powers, shall
not be inquired into collaterally in any private suit to which
such corporation may be a party. Such inquiry may be made
by the Solicitor General in a quo warranto proceeding (Sec. 20,
Corporation Code of the Philippines).
The Case of Republic v. Sereno (G.R. No. 237428, May 11,
2018)

The Solicitor General, representing the Republic of
the Philippines, sought to nullify the appointment of the
respondent, Maria Lourdes P.A. Sereno as Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court, an impeachable officer under the Constitution.
The petition was anchored on the respondent’s alleged lack of
proven integrity, a qualification imposed by the constitution
upon those appointed to a judicial position. The petition alleged
that the respondent’s failure to submit her SALNs (Statement
of Liabilities and Net Worth) as required by the Judicial and
Bar Council (JBC), disqualified her, at the outset, from vying
for the position as Chief Justice since this failure indicated
her lack of proven integrity. The Solicitor General claims that
a quo warranto petition is a proper remedy to question the
validity of respondent’s appointment. It is different, argued
the Solicitor General, from an impeachment proceeding
because the petition, on one hand, seeks to question the
validity of the respondent’s appointment. An impeachment
complaint, on the other hand, does not question the validity
of one’s appointment but seeks the removal of an officer for
committing acts constituting a ground for impeachment like
culpable violation of the constitution or betrayal of public
trust. The petition was filed not on account of the commission
of impeachable offenses. It was filed because the respondent
was not qualified for the position. The petition also alleged
that the petition is seasonably filed within the one-year
period under Sec. 11 of Rule 66 of the Rules of Court, since the
alleged transgressions of the respondent were discovered only
during the hearings of the House Committee on Justice on the
impeachment complaint filed against her.

302

CIVIL PROCEDURE

PART II

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

The respondent argued, in her comment to the petition,
that on the basis of the relevant Constitutional provisions and
jurisprudence, a Chief Justice may be removed from office
only by impeachment since the framers of the Constitution
intended “to create an exclusive category of officers who
can be removed only by impeachment and not otherwise.”
She further argued that the removal of a member of the
Supreme Court through quo warranto would render “inutile”
the Congress’ “check” on the Supreme Court. It would be
absurd, respondent contended, for the framers to provide a
cumbersome process for removing impeachable officers “only
to allow a less difficult means to achieve the same purpose.”
Respondent also emphatically asserted that the petition is
time-barred since Sec. 11 of Rule 66 requires that the petition
be filed within one year from the “cause of ouster” and not
from the “discovery” of the disqualification. The respondent
also stressed that the failure to file SALNs or to submit the
same to the JBC has no bearing on one’s integrity and is not
a ground for disqualification. Respondent also contended
that the issue of whether an applicant is a person of “proven
integrity” is a question “constitutionally committed to the
JBC” and such integrity has been decided in the affirmative
when it included the name of respondent in the shortlist of
nominees for the position of Chief Justice. Whether or not a
person was of “proven integrity” is a political question which
only the JBC and the President, as the appointing authority,

could determine.

A quo warranto petition may be commenced against
impeachable officials; jurisdiction of the Supreme Court

The Supreme Court has concurrent jurisdiction with
the Court of Appeals and the Regional Trial Court to issue
the extraordinary writs, including quo warranto. A direct
invocation of the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction to issue
such writs is allowed when there are special and important
reasons for the filing of the petition. A direct resort to the
Supreme Court may be justified when the matter raised is of
transcendental importance and has far-reaching implications
as when the petition is directed against the Chief Justice.

— SPECIAL
— Quo Warranto

303

Rule 66

“An outright dismissal of the petition based on
speculation that the respondent will eventually be tried on
impeachment is a clear abdication of the Court’s duty to
settle actual controversy squarely presented before it. Quo
warranto proceedings are essentially judicial in character
it calls for the exercise of the Supreme Court’s constitutional
duty and power to decide cases and settle actual controversies.
This constitutional duty cannot be abdicated or transferred in
favor of, or in deference to, any other branch of the government
including the Congress, even as it acts as an impeachment
court through the Senate.”
The Court further explained that “x x x To differentiate
from impeachment, quo warranto involves a judicial
determination of the eligibility or validity of the election or
appointment of a public official based on predetermined rules
while impeachment is a political process to vindicate the
violation of the public’s trust. In quo warranto proceedings
referring to offices filled by appointment, what is determined
is the legality of the appointment. The title to a public office
may not be contested collaterally but only directly, by quo
warranto proceedings. The usurpation of a public office is
treated as a public wrong and carries with it public interest,
and as such, it shall be commenced by a verified petition
brought in the name of the Republic of the Philippines
through the Solicitor General or a public prosecutor. The
Solicitor General is given permissible latitude within his legal
authority in actions for quo warranto, circumscribed only by
the national interest and the government policy on the matter
at hand ” (Republic v. Sereno, G.R. No. 237428, May 1 1, 2018).

Expropriation

Rule 67

Rule 67
EXPROPRIATION
Preliminaries
1. Together with the police power and the power of
taxation, the power of eminent domain is one of the inherent
powers of the State. Because they are inherent in every
sovereign state, these powers need not be conferred by law
or by the Constitution; and any provision in the fundamental
law making reference thereto should not be construed as a
conferment of such power but a recognition of a power that
already exists.

2. Eminent domain is the right or power of a sovereign
state to appropriate private property to particular uses to
promote public welfare. It is an indispensable attribute of
sovereignty, a power grounded in the primary duty of the
government to serve the common need and advance the
general welfare. It is a power inseparable from sovereignty
since it is essential to the existence of the State and inherent
in government (See National Transmission Corporation v.
Oroville Development Corporation, G.R. No. 223366, August
1, 2017).

3. Eminent domain is generally described as “the
highest and most exact idea of property remaining in the
government” that may be acquired for some public purpose
through a method in the nature of a forced purchase by the
State. Also often referred to as expropriation and, with less
frequency, as condemnation, it is, like police power and
taxation, an inherent power of sovereignty and need not
be clothed with any constitutional gear to exist; instead,
provisions in our Constitution on the subject are meant more
to regulate, rather than to grant, the exercise of the power. It
304

—

306

is a right to take or reassert dominion over property within
the state for public use or to meet a public exigency and is
said to be an essential part of governance even in its most
primitive form and thus inseparable from sovereignty. In
fact, “all separate interests of individuals in property are
held of the government under this tacit agreement or implied
reservation. Notwithstanding the grant to individuals, the
eminent domain, the highest and most exact idea of property,
remains in the government, or in the aggregate body of people
in their sovereign capacity; and they have the right to resume
the possession of the property whenever the public interest so
requires it.”

Expropriation proceedings are not adversarial in the
conventional sense, for the condemning authority is not
required to assert any conflicting interest in the property.
Thus, by filing the action, the condemnor in effect merely
serves notice that it is taking title and possession of the
property, and the defendant asserts title or interest in the
property, not to prove a right to possession, but to prove a right
to compensation for the taking. The only direct constitutional
qualification is thus that “private property shall not be taken
for public use without just compensation.” This prescription is
intended to provide a safeguard against possible abuse and so
to protect as well the individual against whose property the
power is sought to be enforced (Air Transportation Office v.
Gopuco, Jr., G.R. No. 158563, June 30, 2005).
4. While the power of eminent domain does not owe
its existence from the Constitution, certain restraints may be
set to it by the Constitution to protect the citizenry against
state encroachment into fundamental and equally inherent
individual rights. Thus, the provisions of Sec. 9, Art. Ill (Bill
of Rights) of the Constitution lay down specific limitations to
its exercise by requiring that the taking of private property be
done only for public use and upon payment of just compensa¬
tion. The due process and equal protection clauses in Sec. 1
of Art. Ill of the Constitution, likewise, serve as limitations
to the exercise of such power. As jurisprudence emphatically
puts it:

306

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)
VOLUME II

“x x x [T]he exercise of such right is not unlimited,
for two mandatory requirements should underlie the
Government’s exercise of the power of eminent domain,
namely: (1) that it is for a particular public purpose;
and (2) that just compensation be paid to the property
owner. These requirements partake the nature of implied
conditions that should be complied with to enable the
condemnor to keep the property expropriated." (Republic
u. Heirs of Borbon, G.R. No. 165354, January 12, 2015).

5. Other constitutional provisions on eminent domain
describe the uses to which the power may be put to use.
For example, Sec. 18 of Art. XII (National Economy and
Patrimony) recognizes the authority of the state to transfer to
public ownership and operation, privately-owned enterprises
and utilities upon the payment of just compensation, in the
interest of national welfare or defense.
The state may also expropriate idle or abandoned
agricultural lands for distribution to the beneficiaries of the
agrarian reform program (Sec. 22, Art. XVIII, Transitory
Provisions, Philippine Constitution).
6. The scope of the power of eminent domain, as
exercised by Congress, is plenary and as broad as the police
power. Such power, however, may also be delegated to local
political subdivisions and public utilities.
Describing the delegation of the power, the Supreme
Court declared:

. . While such power may be validly delegated to
local government units, other public entities, and public
utilities, the exercise of such power by the delegated entities
is not absolute. In fact, the scope of delegated legislative
power is narrower than that of the delegating authority
and such entities may exercise the power to expropriate
private property only when authorized by Congress and
subject to its control and restraints imposed through the
law conferring the power or in other legislations. Indeed,
local government units themselves have no inherent
power of eminent domain. Thus, strictly speaking, the
power of eminent domain delegated to local government

units is in reality not eminent but ‘inferior’ since it must
conform to the limits imposed by the delegation and thus,
partakes only of a share in eminent domain. The national
legislature is still the principal of the local government
units and the latter cannot go against the principal’s will
or modify the same.
Indeed, despite the existence of legislative grant in
favor of local governments, it is still the duty of the courts
to determine whether the power of eminent domain is
being exercised in accordance with the delegating law”
(Beluso v. Municipality of Panay, Capiz, 498 SCRA 113,
121-122).

Essence of expropriation; concept of “public use”

1. “In esse, expropriation is forced private property
taking, the landowner being really without a ghost of a chance
to defeat the case of the expropriating agency. In other words,
in expropriation, the private owner is deprived of property
against his will. Withal, the mandatory’ requirement of due
process ought to be strictly followed, such that the state must
show, at the minimum, a genuine need, an exacting public
purpose to take private property, the purpose to be specifically
alleged or least reasonably deducible from the complaint.

Public use, as an eminent domain concept, has now
acquired an expansive meaning to include any use that is
of ‘usefulness, utility, or advantage, or what is productive of
general benefit [of the public].’ If the genuine public necessity
xxx ceases or disappears, then there is no more cogent point
for the government’s retention of the expropriated land. The
same legal situation should hold if the government devotes
the property to another public use very much different from
the original or deviates from the declared purpose to benefit
another private person. It has been said that the direct use
by the state of its power to oblige landowners to renounce
their productive possession to another citizen, who will use it
predominantly for that citizen’s own private gain, is offensive
to our laws” (Vda. de Ouano u. Republic, 642 SCRA 384,
408-409; See Republic v. Heirs of Borbon, G.R. No. 165354,
January 12, 2015).

VOLUME II

In the exercise of the power of eminent domain, a socialized
housing project falls within the ambit of public use as it is in
furtherance of the constitutional provisions on social justice
(Abad v. Fit-Homes Realty and Development Corporation, 636
SCRA 247, 254).
2. It is essential that the element of public use of
the property be maintained throughout the proceedings
for expropriation. More particularly, with respect to the
element of public use, the expropriator should commit to use
the property pursuant to the purpose stated in the petition
for expropriation filed, failing which, it should file another
petition for the new purpose. If not, it is then incumbent upon
the expropriator to return the said property to its private
owner, if the latter desires to reacquire the same. Otherwise,
the judgment of expropriation suffers an intrinsic flaw, as it
would lack one indispensable element for the proper exercise
of the power of eminent domain, namely, the particular public
purpose for which the property will be devoted. Accordingly,
the private property owner would be denied due process of law,
and the judgment would violate the property owner’s right to
justice, fairness and equity (Republic v. Heirs of Borbon, G.R.
No. 165354, January 12, 2015).
Meaning of just compensation
1. The payment of just compensation is an essential
component of the exercise of the power of eminent domain
because of the Constitutional precept that private property
shall not be taken without just compensation (Sec. 9, Art. Ill,
Philippine Constitution). Taking of private property without
just compensation is a violation of a person’s property right.
In situations where the government does not take the trouble
of initiating an expropriation proceeding, the private owner
has the option to compel payment of the property taken,
when justified (Republic v. Ortigas and Company Limited
Partnership, G.R. No. 171496, March 3, 2014).

2.

Generally, just compensation is the fair and full
equivalent value of the loss (Evergreen Manufacturing Corpo¬
ration v. Republic, G.R. No. 218628, September 6, 2017).

—

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 67 Expropriation

—

309

Specifically, just compensation is defined as the full and
fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the
expropriator. The measure is not the taker’s gain, but the
owner’s loss. The word “just” is used to intensify the meaning
of the word “compensation” and to convey the idea that the
equivalent to be rendered for the property to be taken shall be
real, substantial, full and ample. The constitutional limitation
of “just compensation” is considered to be a sum equivalent to
the market value of the property, broadly defined as the price
fixed by the seller in open market in the usual and ordinary
course of legal action and competition; or the fair value of the
property; as between one who receives and one who desires to
sell it, fixed at the time of the actual taking by the government
(Republic v. Rural Bank of Kabacan, Inc., 664 SCRA 233, 244,
January 25, 2012; See Republic v. Asia Pacific Integrated
Steel Corporation, G.R. No. 192100, March 12, 2014; See also
Evergreen Manufacturing Corporation v. Republic, G.R. No.
218628, September 6, 2017).
3. The court teaches that in order to determine just
compensation, the trial court should first ascertain the market
value of the property by considering the cost of acquisition,
the current value of like properties, its actual or potential
losses, and in the particular use of lands, their size, shape,
location, and the tax declarations thereon. If as a result of the
expropriation, the remaining lot suffers from an impairment or
decrease in value, consequential damages may be awarded by
the trial court, provided that the consequential benefits which
may arise from the expropriation do not exceed said damages
suffered by the owner of the property (Republic v. Spouses
Salvador, G.R. No. 205428, June 7, 2017). The market value of
the property is “broadly defined as the price fixed by the seller
in the open market in the usual and ordinary course of legal
action and competition, or the fair value of the property; as
between one who receives and one who desires to sell it, fixed
at the time of the actual taking by the government” (Republic
v. Cebuan, G.R. No. 206702, June 7, 2017).

Roughly, from the foregoing, the just compensation refers
to the market value of the property plus the consequential

I

damages suffered by the owner. To be deducted therefrom
are the consequential benefits received by the owner but such
benefits shall not exceed the damages suffered.

Requisites of “taking” in eminent domain cases

Jurisprudence has laid down the following requisites for
“taking”:

The concept of just compensation does not imply

(a) The expropriator must enter a private property;

fairness to the property owner alone. Compensation must
also be just to the public, which ultimately bears the cost of
expropriation (National Transmission Corporation v. Oroville
Development Corporation, G.R. No. 223366, August 1, 2017).

(b) The entrance to the property must be for more
than a momentary period;
(c) The entry into the property should be under
warrant or color of legal authority;

5. The concept of just compensation embraces not
only the correct determination of the amount to be paid to
the owner of the land, but also payment within a reasonable
time from its taking. Without prompt payment, compensation
cannot be considered “just” inasmuch as the property owner is
made to suffer the consequence of being immediately deprived
of his land (Land Bank of the Philippines v. Prado Verde
Corporation, G.R. No. 208004, July 30, 2018).

(d) The property must be devoted to a public use or
otherwise informally appropriated or injuriously affected;

and
(e) The utilization of the property for public use
must be in such a way as to oust the owner and deprive
him of all beneficial enjoyment of the property.

Thus, when an expropriator, authorized by law to exercise
eminent domain, enters a private property to construct
transmission lines to be used in generating electricity for the
benefit of the public, stays in the property for indefinitely in
the property, and as a result thereof, the owner of the property
is deprived of the beneficial ownership of the same, there
is “taking” (National Transmission Corporation v. Oroville
Development Corporation, G.R. No. 223366, August 1, 2017).

The delay in the payment of just compensation is a
forbearance of money. As such, the forbearance is necessarily
entitled to earn interest (Evergreen Manufacturing Corpo¬
ration v. Republic, G.R. No. 218628, September 6, 2017).
The rationale for imposing the interest is to compensate the
landowner for the income he would have made had he been
properly compensated at the time of the taking (Land Bank of
the Philippines v. Prado Verde Corporation, G.R. No. 208004,
July 30, 2018).

Government has no unrestricted title to the land expropriated

Purpose of just compensation

“x x x A condemnor should commit to use the
property pursuant to the purpose stated in the petition for
expropriation, failing which it should file another petition for
the new purpose. If not, then it behooves the condemnor to
return the said property to its private owner, if the latter so
desires. The government cannot plausibly keep the property
it expropriated in any manner it pleases and, in the process,
dishonor the judgment of expropriation. This is not in keeping
with the idea of fair play.

The purpose of just compensation is not to reward the
owner for the property taken, but to compensate him for the
loss thereof. As upheld by jurisprudence, the true measure
of the property is the market value at the time of the taking
since it is when the loss resulted. As such, the state is only
bound to make good the loss sustained by the owner of the
property expropriated (See Republic v. Macabagdal, G.R. No.
227215, January 10, 2018).

The notion that the government, via expropriation
proceedings, acquires unrestricted ownership over or a fee
I

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 67 Expropriation

simple title to the covered land, is no longer tenable, x x x
Expropriated lands should be differentiated from a piece of
land, ownership of which was absolutely transferred by way
of an unconditional purchase and sale contract freely entered
by two parties, one without obligation to buy and the other
without the duty to sell. In that case, the ‘fee simple concept’
really comes into play. There is really no occasion to apply the
‘fee simple concept’ if the transfer is conditional. The taking
of a private land in expropriation proceedings is always
conditioned on its continued devotion to its public purpose.
As a necessary corollary, once the purpose is terminated or
peremptorily abandoned, then the former owner, if he so
desires, may seek its reversion, subject of course to the return,
at the very least, of the just compensation received” (Vda. de
Ouano v. Republic, 642 SCRA 385, 409).

2. The above provision lays down the following
requisites that must concur before a local government unit
can exercise the power of eminent domain:

312

Exercise of eminent domain by local government units
Section 19 of R.A. 7160, otherwise known as the
Local Government Code, which delegates to local government
units the power of eminent domain, expressly provides:
1.

—

“SEC. 19. Eminent Domain. A local government
unit may, through its chief executive and acting pursuant
to an ordinance, exercise the power of eminent domain
for public use, or purpose, or welfare for the benefit of the
poor and the landless, upon payment of just compensation,
pursuant to the provisions of the Constitution and
pertinent laws: Provided, however. That the power of
eminent domain may not be exercised unless a valid and
definite offer has been previously made to the owner, and
such offer was not accepted: Provided, further, That the
local government unit may immediately take possession
of the property upon the filing of the expropriation
proceedings and upon making a deposit with the proper
court of at least fifteen percent (15%) of the fair market
value of the property based on the current tax declaration
of the property to be expropriated: Provided, finally. That,
the amount to be paid for the expropriated property shall
be determined by the proper court, based on the fair
market value at the time of the taking of the property.”

313

(a) An ordinance is enacted by a local legislative
council to exercise the power of eminent domain, or
pursue expropriation proceedings over a particular
private property through its chief executive;
(b) The power of eminent domain is exercised for
public use, purpose or welfare, or for the benefit of the
poor and the landless;

(c) The power may be exercised through its chief
executive acting pursuant to the enacted ordinance;

(d) There is payment of just compensation, as
required under the Constitution, and other pertinent
laws; and
(e) A valid and definite offer has been previously
made to the owner of the property sought to be
expropriated, but said offer was not accepted.

Exercise of eminent domain through an ordinance

"

The Court, in no uncertain terms, has pronounced that
a local government unit cannot authorize an expropriation of
private property through a mere resolution of its lawmaking
body. R.A. 7160 expressly requires an ordinance for the
purpose and a resolution that merely expresses the sentiment
of the municipal council will not suffice.
Said the Court in a significant case:
“A resolution will not suffice for a local government
unit to be able to expropriate private property; and the
reason for this is settled because a municipal ordinance
is different from a resolution. An ordinance is a law, but
a resolution is merely a declaration of the sentiment or
opinion of a lawmaking body on a specific matter. An
ordinance possesses a general and permanent character,
but a resolution is temporary in nature. Additionally, the
two are enacted differently a third reading is necessary

for an ordinance, but not for a resolution, unless decided
otherwise by a majority of all the Sanggunian members”
(Beluso v. Municipality of Panay, Capiz, 498 SCRA 113,
124).

How the local government unit may immediately take
possession of the property

Pursuant to Sec. 19 of R.A. 7160, the local government
unit may immediately take possession of the property when
the following statutory requirements are met:
(a) Expropriation proceedings are filed; and

(b) The local government makes a deposit with the
proper court of at least 15% of the fair market value of
the property based on the current tax declaration of the
property to be expropriated. Note: The amount to be paid
for the property shall be based on the fair market value
at the time of the taking of the property.

Expropriation not limited to acquisition of title

Is expropriation limited only to the acquisition of title
over the property expropriated?

In National Power Corporation v. Santa Loro Vda. de
Capin, 569 SCRA 648, 666-667, this question was categorically
answered when the Court discussed the extent of expropriation
and the consequent compensation to the owner of the property:
“Expropriation is not limited to the acquisition of
real property with a corresponding transfer of title or
possession. The right-of-way easement resulting in a
restriction or limitation on property rights over the land
traversed by transmission lines also falls within the ambit
of the term ‘expropriation.’ ”

As the Court thoroughly explained in National Power
Corporation v. Gutierrez, 193 SCRA 1, 7:
“The foregoing facts considered, the acquisition of
the right-of-way easement falls within the purview of the
power of eminent domain. Such conclusion finds support

316

in similar cases of easement of right-of-way where the
Supreme Court sustained the award of just compensation
for private property condemned for public use” (See
National Power Corporation v. Court of Appeals, 129
SCRA 665, 671; Garcia v. Court of Appeals, 102 SCRA
597, 606).
Stages in the expropriation process

There are two stages in the expropriation process, namely:

The first stage is the determination of the authority of
the plaintiff to expropriate. This determination includes
an inquiry into the propriety of the expropriation
its
necessity and the public purpose.
The first stage will end in the issuance of an order of
expropriation if the court finds for the plaintiff, or in the
dismissal of the complaint if it finds otherwise.
The second stage is the determination of just
compensation through the court-appointed commissioners
(National Power Corporation v. Jocson, 206 SCRA 520,

—

536).

It is jurisprudentially-settled that the valuation of
property or determination of just compensation in eminent
domain proceedings is essentially a judicial function which is
vested with the courts and not with administrative agencies
(Land Bank of the Philippines v. Omengan, G.R. No. 196412,
July 19, 2017; Land Bank of the Philippines u. Rural Bank of
Hermosa, G.R. No. 181953, July 25, 2017). This is the reason
for the authority given to a court, in eminent domain cases,
to even set aside the report of the commissioners assigned to
determine just compensation (Sec. 8, Rule 67, Rules of Court).

Matters to be alleged in a complaint for expropriation
1. There is no reason for the institution of expropriation
proceedings when the owner is willing to part with his
property. The commencement of a complaint for expropriation
is necessary only when the owner does not agree to sell his

CIVIL PROCEDURE

316

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

property, or if he is willing to sell but does not agree with the
price offered.

An expropriation proceeding is commenced by the

2.
filing of a verified complaint which shall:

(a) state with certainty the right of the plaintiff to
expropriation and the purpose thereof;
(b) describe the real or personal property sought to
be expropriated; and

(c) join as defendants all persons owning or claim¬
ing to own, or occupying, any part of the property or in¬
terest therein, showing, so far as practicable, the interest
of each defendant. If the plaintiff cannot identify the real
owners with accuracy, averment to that effect shall be
made in the complaint (Sec. 1, Rule 67, Rules of Court).

Service of summons; who may be defendants

The defendant shall be served with summons (Sec.
3, Rule 67, Rules of Court).
1.

2. The defendants in an expropriation case are not
limited to the owners of the property condemned. They
include all other persons owning, occupying or claiming to
own the property. When property is taken by eminent domain,
the owner x x x is not necessarily the only person who is
entitled to compensation. In the American jurisdiction, the
term “owner,” when employed in statutes relating to eminent
domain to designate the persons who are to be made parties to
the proceeding, refers, as is the rule in respect of those entitled
to compensation, to all those who have lawful interest in the
property to be condemned, including a mortgagee, lessee and
vendee in possession under an executory contract. Every
person having an estate or interest at law or in equity in the
land taken is entitled to a share in the award. If a person
claiming an interest in the land sought to be condemned is not
made a party, he is given the right to intervene and lay claim
to the compensation (Republic v. Mangotara, 624 SCRA 360,
423).

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 67 Expropriation

317

Court with jurisdiction
1. An action for expropriation is filed with the Regional
Trial Court because it is an action incapable of pecuniary
estimation regardless of the value of the subject property.
The primary consideration of an expropriation suit is whether
the government or any of its instrumentalities has complied
with the requisites for the taking of private property. Hence,
the courts determine the authority of the government entity,
necessity of the expropriation, and observance of due process.
In the main, the subject of an expropriation suit is the
government’s exercise of eminent domain, a matter that is
incapable of pecuniary estimation. Although the value of the
property to be expropriated is estimated in monetary terms,
this is merely incidental to the expropriation suit because the
amount of compensation is only determined after the court is
satisfied with the propriety of the expropriation (See Barangay
San Roque v. Heirs of Pastor, 334 SCRA 127, 134).
2. In eminent domain cases, the determination of
just compensation is principally a judicial function of the
Regional Trial Court acting as a special agrarian court. It
exercises exclusive original jurisdiction over all petitions for
the determination of just compensation to landowners (Land
Bank of the Philippines u. Prado Verde Corporation, G.R. No.
208004, July 30, 2018).

Defenses and objections in the answer
1. The defendant shall serve an answer if he has an
objection to the: (a) filing of the complaint, (b) allegations in
the complaint, or (c) objection or defense to the taking of his
property. This answer shall be served within the time stated
in the summons (Sec. 3, Rule 67, Rules of Court).
Note: In expropriation proceedings, the period within
which to file an answer is stated in the summons. In ordinary
civil actions, the period to file an answer is specified in Rule
11 of the Rules of Court, as amended.
2. The answer is required to specifically designate or
identify the property in which the defendant claims to have

CIVIL PROCEDURE

318

PART II

VOLUME II

an interest, and state the nature and extent of the interest
claimed. He must also allege all his objections and defenses
to the taking of his property because those not adduced are
deemed waived (Sec. 3, Rule 67, Rules of Court).
Observe that this rule is similar to the principle observed
in the omnibus motion rule under Sec. 9 of Rule 15 of the Rules
of Court, as amended, governing ordinary civil actions which
requires that a motion attacking a pleading, order, judgment
or proceeding shall include all grounds then available, and all
objections not so included shall be deemed waived.
Remedy when some defenses are omitted

If the answer omits some defenses, the remedy, in
order to prevent a waiver of those defenses not alleged, is to
seek leave to amend the answer within 10 days from the filing
thereof. Leave is required because of the tenor of the rule
which provides “x x x the court, in the interest of justice, may
permit amendments to the answer to be made not later than
ten (10) days from the filing thereof” (Sec. 3, Rule 67, Rules of
Court; Italics supplied).
1.

2. In ordinary civil actions, an amendment of the
pleading could be a matter of right, and no leave is required,
as long as the amendment is made before the service of
a responsive pleading (Sec. 2, Rule 10, Rules of Court, as
amended). So, in the case of an answer, the same may be
amended as a matter of right before a reply is served.
In expropriation proceedings, however, the permission of
the court is always required before the answer is amended for
the purpose of incorporating defenses and objections not so
alleged (Sec. 3, Rule 67, Rules of Court).

Counterclaims, cross-claims, or third-party complaints

In ordinary civil actions, the defendant may file an answer
with a counterclaim, cross-claim or with leave of court, file a
third-party complaint. Under Sec. 3 of Rule 67, none of these
pleadings shall be alleged or allowed in the answer or in any

— —

SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 67 Expropriation

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

319

subsequent pleading. Hence, under Rule 67, the defendant
cannot file an answer with a counterclaim, answer with a
cross-claim, or third-party complaint.

Waiver of defenses or failure to answer; effect
While it is the rule that the failure to allege defenses and
objections in the answer will have the effect of a waiver of
such defenses, the defendant who does not file an answer, will
not totally lose his standing in court unlike the defendant in
an ordinary civil action who cannot take part in the trial if he
is declared in default for failure to file his answer.
By contrast, in expropriation proceedings, whether or
not a defendant has previously appeared or answered, he
may present evidence as to the amount of the compensation
to be paid for his property, and share in the distribution of the
award (Sec. 3, Rule 67, Rules of Court).

When an answer is not required

An answer is not required if the defendant has no objection
or defense to the action or to the taking of his property.
Instead, he may file and serve a: (a) notice of appearance,
and (b) manifestation to the fact that he has no objection or
defense to the taking of his property, within the time stated
in the summons. In the manifestation, he shall specifically
designate or identify the property in which he claims to have
an interest. Thereafter, he shall be entitled to notices of all
proceedings affecting the property even if he has no objections
or defenses (Sec. 3, Rule 67, Rules of Court).

Entry upon the property or possession thereof; deposit and
notice (Bar 2009, 2011)
1. The recognition of the requirements of the public good
allows the expropriator to take or enter upon the possession

of the real property upon the filing of the complaint, or at any
time after the filing of the complaint after due notice to the

defendant.

320

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

PART II

However, it is not the mere filing of the complaint which
entitles the plaintiff to take or enter upon the possession of
the real property subject of the complaint. Under Sec. 2 of
Rule 67, as presently written, in order to be entitled to the
possession of the property, the plaintiff, upon the filing of the
complaint or at any time thereafter, must deposit with the
proper government authority an amount equivalent to the
assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation with
an authorized government depositary, which deposit shall be
held by the bank subject to the orders of the court (Sec. 2, Rule
67, Rules of Court).
If personal property is involved, which has no assessed
value, the amount to be deposited shall be fixed by the court
after the value of the property is provisionally ascertained
(Sec. 2, Rule 67, Rules of Court).
2. The deposit referred to shall be in money, unless the
court authorizes a deposit in the form of a certificate of deposit
of a government bank of the Republic of the Philippines
payable on demand to the authorized depositary (Sec. 2, Rule
67, Rules of Court).

3. Notice is required to be sent to the defendant before
the plaintiff shall have the right to take or enter upon the
possession of the real property involved (Sec. 2, Rule 67, Rules
of Court).
Effect of making the required deposit (Bar 2011)
1. The deposit having been made, the court shall
order the sheriff or other proper officer to place the plaintiff
in possession of the property involved and promptly submit a
report to the court. Copies of the report are to be served to the
parties (Sec. 2, Rule 67, Rules of Court).

Note that Sec. 2 of Rule 67 does not require a prior hearing
before immediate possession can be granted to the plaintiff. A
fair reading of the provision discloses that the said provision
merely requires notice to the defendant and the making of the

required deposit.

2. Jurisprudence confirms the above rule as it declares
that prior hearing is not required before the Republic of
the Philippines can be granted immediate possession of the
property. The defenses by the owner against immediate
possession can be considered on the trial on the merits. All that
is required is notice to the owner and the deposit (San Diego v.
Valdellon, 80 SCRA 305, 310; National Power Corporation u.
Jocson, 206 SCRA 520, 536-537).

Purpose of the deposit

The deposit requirement serves as an advanced payment
to the owner of the property should the court decide in favor
of the plaintiff, and should it be otherwise, the deposit shall
serve as indemnity against any damage which the owner may
have sustained (Visayan Refining Company v. Camus and
Paredes, 40 Phil. 550, 563).
Entry upon the property or possession under R.A. 8974;

Immediate payment

R.A. 8974, otherwise known as “An Act to Facilitate the
Acquisition of Right-of-Way, Site or Location for National
Government Infrastructure Projects and for Other Purposes,”
and its Implementing Rules and Regulations has modified
Sec. 2 of Rule 67.
As observed by the Court in one case:
“There are at least two crucial differences between
the respective procedures under R.A. 8974 and Rule 67.
Under the statute, the Government is required to make
immediate payment to the property owner upon the filing
of the complaint to be entitled to a writ of possession,
whereas in Rule 67, the Government is required only to
make an initial deposit with an authorized government
depositary. Moreover, Rule 67 prescribes that the initial
deposit be equivalent to the assessed value of the property
for purposes of taxation, unlike R.A. 8974 which provides,

The relevant provision of R.A. 8974 states:
“SEC. 4. Guidelines for Expropriation Proceedings.
Whenever it is necessary to acquire real property
for the right-of-way, site or location for any national
government infrastructure project through expropriation,
there are appropriate proceedings before the proper court
under the following guidelines:

—

a) Upon the filing of the complaint, and after due
notice to the defendant, the implementing agency shall
immediately pay the owner of the property the amount
equivalent to the sum of (1) one hundred percent (100%)
of the value of the property based on the current relevant
zonal valuation of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR)-,
and (2) the value of the improvements and/or structures
as determined under Sec. 7 hereof ” (Italics supplied).

In contrast, the first paragraph of Sec. 2 of Rule 67
provides:
“SEC. 2. Entry of plaintiff upon depositing value
with authorized government depositary. Upon the filing
of the complaint or at any time thereafter and after due
notice to the defendant, the plaintiff shall have the right
to take or enter upon the possession of the real property
involved if he deposits with the authorized government
depositary an amount equivalent to the assessed value of
the property for purposes of taxation to be held by such
bank subject to the orders of the court. Such deposit shall
be in money, unless in lieu thereof the court authorizes
the deposit of a certificate of deposit of a government bank
of the Republic of the Philippines payable on demand
to the authorized government depositary” (Republic v.
Gingoyon, 478 SCRA 474, 516-517; See also Republic u.

New system of immediate payment under R.A. 8974;
application of the rule
While Rule 67 merely requires the Government to deposit
with an authorized government depositary the assessed value
of the property for expropriation for it to be entitled to a writ
of possession, R.A. 8974 requires that the Government make
a direct payment to the property owner before the writ may
issue. Moreover, such payment is based on the zonal valuation
of the BIR in the case of land, the value of the improvements
or structures under the replacement cost method, or if no such
valuation is available and in cases of utmost urgency, the
proffered value of the property to be seized.

R.A. 8974, which provides for a procedure eminently more
favorable to the property owner than Rule 67, inescapably
applies in instances when the national government
expropriates property “for national government infrastructure
projects.” Thus, if expropriation is engaged in bv the national
government, for purposes other than national infrastructure
projects, the assessed value standard and the deposit mode
prescribed in Rule 67 continues to apply. The intent of R.A.
8974 to supersede the system of deposit under Rule 67 with the
scheme of “immediate payment” in cases involving national
government infrastructure projects is indeed very clear (For
related readings, see Republic v. Gingoyon, 478 SCRA 474,
515-518; MCWD v. J. King and Sons, 585 SCRA 484, 492).
Prospective application of R.A. 8974

The law does not have a retroactive effect. First, R.A.
8974 is substantive law. A law looks forward not backwards
[lex prospicit non respicitj. Second, there is nothing in R.A.
8974 which expressly provides that it should have retroactive
effect. Third, retroactivity is not implied from R.A. 8974 or in
any of its provisions. Hence, where “the complaint for eminent
domain was filed on September 15, 1999, or prior to the
effectivity of R.A. No. 8974 on November 26, 2000, then R.A.
8974 and the standards indicated therein are not applicable in
determining just compensation x x x” (Republic v. Larrazabal,

(Sec. 11, Rule 67, Rules of Court).

Rule if the trial court’s decision is reversed on appeal

If, on appeal, the appellate court determines that the
plaintiff has no right of expropriation, judgment shall be
rendered ordering the Regional Trial Court to enforce the

and to determine the damages which the defendant sustained
and may recover by reason of the possession taken by the

expropriation

Ascertainment of just compensation; hearing mandatory

After the rendition of the order of expropriation, the
plaintiff shall not be permitted to dismiss or discontinue the
proceeding except upon such terms as the court deems just
and equitable (Sec. 4, Rule 67, Rules of Court).

1. The order of expropriation, as far as the court is
concerned, settles the issue as to the right of expropriation
and propriety of the public use or purpose. The order of
expropriation merely declares that the plaintiff has the lawful
right to expropriate the property but contains no ascertainment
of the compensation to be paid to the owner of the property.
The next vital issue in the proceedings is the determination of
just compensation.

Appeal from the order of expropriation

The order of expropriation is appealable. The final order
sustaining the right to expropriate the property may be
appealed from by any party aggrieved by such order (Sec. 4,
Rule 67, Rules of Court).
Matters not affected by the appeal

1. Recall that the second stage in the expropriation
process is the determination of just compensation. When the

Hence, upon the rendition of the order of expropriation,

ascertain the just compensation for the property. Objections
to the appointment may be made within 10 days from service
of the order of appointment of the commissioners to the
parties, and shall be resolved within 30 days after all the

VOLUME II

commissioners shall have received copies of the objections

(Sec. 5, Rule 67, Rules of Court). (Bar 2011)

The commissioners are entitled to fees which shall be
taxed as part of the costs of the proceedings, and all costs,
as a rule, shall be paid by the plaintiff except those of rival
claimants litigating their claims (Sec. 12, Rule 67, Rules of
Court).

2. It has been ruled that the appointment of com¬
missioners to ascertain just compensation for the property
sought to be taken is a mandatory requirement in expropriation
cases. Where the principal issue is the determination of
just compensation, a hearing before the commissioners is
indispensable to allow the parties to present evidence on the
issue of just compensation.
While it is true that the findings of commissioners may
be disregarded and the trial court may substitute its own
estimate of the value, the latter may only do so for valid
reasons, that is, where the commissioners have applied illegal
principles to the evidence submitted to them, where they have
disregarded a clear preponderance of evidence, or where the
amount allowed is either grossly inadequate or excessive.
Thus, trial with the aid of the commissioners is a
substantial right that may not be done away with capriciously
or for no reason at all. Where no trial or hearing was conducted
to afford the parties the opportunity to present their own
evidence, the court should disregard the commissioners’
findings. The absence of such trial or hearing constitutes
a violation of the right of due process (National Power
Corporation v. De la Cruz, 514 SCRA 56, 69-70).

3. The parties may introduce their evidence in the
hearing before the commissioners and argue their case either
by themselves or by counsel. In ascertaining the compensation,
the commissioners shall assess the consequential damages to
the property not taken and deduct from such consequential
damages the consequential benefits to be derived by the owner
from the public use or purpose of the property taken but in
no case shall the consequential benefits assessed exceed the

327

consequential damages nor shall the owner be deprived of the
actual value of his property so taken (Sec. 6, Rule 67, Rules of

Court).

4. In determining just compensation, the measure to
be borne in mind is not the taker’s gain but the owner’s loss
since what is involved is the takeover of private property
under the State’s coercive power. The State must ensure that
the individual whose property is taken is not shortchanged
and must, hence, carry the burden of showing that the "just
compensation requirement of the Bill of Rights is satisfied”
(Apo Fruits Corporation u. Land Bank of the Philippines,
632
SCRA 727, 746-747).

Judgment as to compensation
1. The court, after hearing, may either accept the
report, set aside the same, or accept the report in part and
reject the same in part. If it accepts the report, it shall
render
judgment in accordance with the report. If it sets aside the
report, it may appoint new commissioners or recommit
the
same to the commissioners for further report of facts. It may
even accept the report in part and reject it in part. Whatever
other orders the court may make shall always consider the
interest of all the parties to the case (Sec. 8, Rule 67, Rules of

Court).

2. The Court cautioned the RTC to observe the following
guidelines for the proper determination of just compensation:
(1) just compensation must be valued at the time of taking
of
the property expropriated, or the time when the owner was
deprived of the use and benefit of his property; (2) interest
may be awarded as may be warranted by the
circumstances
of the case; and (3) just compensation must be arrived
at
pursuant to the guidelines set forth in Sec. 17 of R.A.
6657 and
outlined in a formula provided in DAR A.O. No. 5. If the RTC
finds these guidelines inapplicable, it must clearly explain the
reasons for deviating therefrom and for using other factors or
formula in, arriving at the reasonable just compensation for

the property expropriated (Spouses Mercado v. Land Bank of
the Philippines, G.R. No. 196707, June 17, 2015).

328

CIVIL PROCEDURE

PART II

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

3. The value at the time of the filing of the complaint
should be the basis for the determination of the value when the
taking of the property involved coincides with or is subsequent
to the commencement of the proceedings (National Power
Corporation v. Marasigan, et al., G.R. No. 220367, November
20, 2017).

Appeal from the judgment as to compensation; effect
1. The judgment rendered by the court as to the just
compensation may be appealed from but the appeal shall not
have the effect of delaying the right of the plaintiff to enter
upon the property and appropriate the same for public use
or purpose. But if the appellate court determines that the
plaintiff has no right of expropriation, judgment shall be
rendered ordering the Regional Trial Court to restore the
property to the defendant and determine the damages which
he may have sustained by reason of the possession taken by
the plaintiff (Sec. 11, Rule 67, Rules of Court).

2. If the judgment is affirmed on appeal, the costs of
the appeal shall be paid, not by the plaintiff, but by the owner
of the property who appealed the judgment (Sec. 12, Rule 67,
Rules of Court).

3. Be it remembered that it is not only the judgment
of the court as to the compensation which is appealable. The
previous order of expropriation is also appealable (Sec. 4, Rule
67, Rules of Court).
When to ascertain just compensation
At what point should compensation for the property
taken be determined? Is it as of the filing of the complaint for
expropriation or the time the plaintiff takes possession of the
property?
1. Section 4, Rule 67 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure
provides that just compensation is to be determined “as of the
date of the taking of the property or the filing of the complaint,
whichever came first” (National Power Corporation v. Bagui,
569 SCRA 401, 412; For further readings, see Republic v.

Payment of just compensation
1. The payment shall consist of the amount fixed in
the judgment including the legal interest from the taking of
possession of the property (Sec. 10, Rule 67, Rules of Court).

2. If the defendant declines to receive the amount
tendered, the same shall be ordered deposited in court and
such deposit shall have the same effect as actual payment
thereof to the defendant or to the person ultimately adjudged
entitled thereto (Sec. 10, Rule 67, Rules of Court).
Payment in case of uncertain ownership; conflicting claims
If the ownership of the property taken is uncertain, or
there are conflicting claims to any part thereof, the court may
order that the sum representing the compensation for the
property be paid to the court. Said payment shall be for the
benefit of the person adjudged in the same proceeding to be
entitled thereto (Sec. 9, Rule 67, Rules of Court).

Right of plaintiff after judgment and payment

After payment by the plaintiff of the just compensation
and legal interest applicable as determined in the judgment,
he shall have the right to: (a) enter upon the property
expropriated, and (b) appropriate the same for the public use
or purpose defined in the judgment, or (c) retain possession
already taken in accordance with Sec. 2 of Rule 67 (Sec. 10,
Rule 67, Rules of Court).

Non-payment of just compensation does not automatically
entitle the private landowner to recover possession of the
expropriated lots. However, in cases where the government
failed to pay just compensation within 5 years from the
finality of judgment in the expropriation proceedings,
the
owners concerned shall have the right to recover possession of
their property. This is in consonance with the principle that
the government cannot keep the property and dishonor the
judgment. To be sure, the five-year limitation will encourage
the government to pay just compensation punctually. This is
in keeping with justice and equity (Yujuico v. Atienza, Jr., 472
SCRA 463, 487; Republic v. Lim, 462 SCRA 265, 288-289).
Recording of the judgment and its effect
1. The judgment entered in expropriation proceedings
shall state definitely the particular property or
interest
expropriated, which shall be adequately described (Sec. 13,
Rule 67, Rules of Court).

2. The judgment shall also state definitely the
nature of the public use or purpose for which the property is
expropriated. When the property expropriated is real estate,
a certified copy of such judgment shall be recorded in the
registry of deeds of the place where the property is situated.
The recording shall vest upon the plaintiff the title to the real
estate so described for such public use or purpose (Sec. 13,
Rule 67, Rules of Court).

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 68 — Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage

Rule 68
FORECLOSURE OF REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE
A real estate mortgage is an accessory contract
executed by a debtor in favor of a creditor as security for
the principal obligation. This principal obligation is usually
a simple loan or mutuum described in Art. 1953 of the Civil
Code of the Philippines.
To be a real estate mortgage, the contract must be
constituted on either immovables (real property) or alienable
real rights. If constituted on movables, the contract is a chattel
mortgage (Art. 2124, Civil Code of the Philippines).
2. A real estate mortgage creates a real right which
follows the property whoever the owner may be after the
constitution of the mortgage. Hence, the new owner, who
knows of the mortgage (or if registered), is bound by the
mortgage even if he is not a party to the contract of mortgage.
Article 2126 of the Civil Code of the Philippines is explicit:
“The mortgage directly and immediately subjects the property
upon which it is imposed, whoever the possessor may be, to
the fulfillment of the obligation for whose security it was
constituted.”
3. The mortgagor need not be the debtor and the latter
need not be the mortgagor. The mortgagor who is not the debtor
in the principal obligation is referred to as an accommodation
mortgagor. This situation is not prohibited by law and has, in
fact, a legal basis. The law provides: “Third persons who are
not parties to the principal obligation may secure the latter by
pledging or mortgaging their own property” (Art. 2085, Civil
Code of the Philippines).
1.

332

333

Accommodation mortgagors, as such, are not in any way
liable for the payment of the loan or principal obligation of
the debtor/borrower. The liability of the accommodation
mortgagors extends only up to the loan value of the mortgaged
property and not to the entire loan itself (Belo v. Philippine
National Bank, 353 SCRA 359, 377).
4. There can be several mortgages over the same
property since there is neither a law nor rule prohibiting the
existence of more than one encumbrance over a property. These
encumbrances have no effect on the ownership of the property
and are treated merely as liens, the first one being normally
treated as more superior over subsequent encumbrances.
However, even a junior encumbrancer is not precluded by any
rule from initiating foreclosure proceedings ahead of a prior
encumbrancer in case the debt in his favor matures earlier.
If the second mortgagee, for instance, files a complaint
foreclosure,
for
there is also no rule prohibiting the former
from impleading the first mortgagee (De la Riva v. Reynoso,
61 Phil. 734, 736). If the first mortgagee is not impleaded, he
may intervene in the action if he desires, and if the obligation
in his favor is already due and payable. This is because he
has a legal interest in the subject matter of the litigation, a
requisite for intervention under Rule 19 of the Rules of Court,
as amended.

5. While Art. 2125 of the Civil Code of the Philippines
provides that, “in order that a mortgage may be validly
constituted, x x x the document in which it appears be recorded
in the Registry of Property,” the same provision also provides
that if the instrument is not recorded, “the mortgage is,
nevertheless, binding between the parties.” Thus, the failure
to register the instrument does not affect its validity between
the parties. The registration of the mortgage is, however,
necessary for the purpose of binding third persons.
Dragnet clause or blanket mortgage clause (Bar 2012)
1. A mortgage contract may have a provision in which
the mortgage is a security for past, present, and future

i

334

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 68 Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

indebtedness. This clause, known as a dragnet clause or blanket
mortgage clause, has its origins in American jurisprudence.
The Supreme Court ruled that mortgages given to secure
future advancements are valid and legal contracts.
A dragnet clause, in other words, is a stipulation in a
mortgage contract that extends the coverage of a mortgage
to advances or loans other than those already obtained
or specified in the contract. While a real estate mortgage
may secure future loans or advances, these future debts
must be specifically described in the mortgage contract.
An obligation is not secured by a mortgage unless it comes
fairly within the terms of the mortgage contract. Also, the
documents evidencing the subsequent advances should refer
to the mortgage as providing security therefor (Paradigm
Development Corporation of the Philippines v. Bank of the
Philippine Islands, G.R. No. 191174, June 7, 2017).
Accordingly, it has been settled in a long line of decisions
that mortgages given to secure future advancements are valid
and legal contracts, and the amounts named as consideration
in said contracts do not Emit the amount for which the
mortgage may stand as security if, from the four corners of the
instrument, the intent to secure future and other indebtedness
can be gathered (Prudential Bank v. Alviar, 464 SCRA 353,
363-364; See also Paradigm Development Corporation of the
Philippines v. Bank of the Philippine Islands, G.R. No. 191174,
June 7, 2017).
A “dragnet clause” operates as a convenience
and accommodation to the borrowers as it makes available
additional funds without their having to execute additional
security documents, thereby saving time, travel, loan closing
costs, costs of extra legal services, recording fees, etc. While
a real estate mortgage may exceptionally secure future loans
or advancements, these future debts must be sufficiently
described in the mortgage contract. An obligation is not
secured by a mortgage unless it comes fairly within the terms
of the mortgage contract (Traders Royal Bank u. Castanares,
636 SCRA 519, 528-529).
2.

336

When foreclosure is proper; demand to pay
1. Foreclosure of real estate mortgage presupposes that
the debtor failed to pay his debt despite demand. The default
of the debtor must first be established. Such default occurs
when payment is not made after a valid demand, unless the
contract between the parties carries with it a stipulation that
demand is not necessary for default to arise.
2. The issue of whether demand was made before the
foreclosure was effected is essential. If demand was made and
duly received by the respondents and the latter still did not pay,
then they were already in default and foreclosure was proper.
However, if demand was not made, then the loans had not yet
become due and demandable. This meant that respondents
had not defaulted in their payments and the foreclosure by
petitioner was premature. Foreclosure is valid only when the
debtor is in default in the payment of his obligation (General
Milling Corporation v. Ramos, 654 SCRA 256, 266, citing
Development Bank of the Philippines v. Licuanan, 516 SCRA
644).

Alternative remedies of the creditor; splitting a single cause
of action (Bar 1999)
1. In case of default of the debtor, the creditor has the
following alternative remedies:

(a) To file an action for collection of a sum of money;

or
(b) To foreclose the mortgage, if one has been
constituted.

Hence, it has been held that: “x x x a mortgagee-creditor
has a single cause of action against a mortgagor-debtor, that is,
to recover the debt. The mortgagee-creditor has the option of
either filing a personal action for collection of sum of money or
instituting a real action to foreclose on the mortgage security.
An election of the first bars recourse to the second, otherwise,
there would be multiplicity of suits in which the debtor would
be tossed from one venue to another depending on the location

(Flores v. Lindo, Jr., 648 SCRA 772, 777).

an example of splitting of a single cause of action, a practice
that is vexatious and oppressive.

The rule is far from novel. Previously, it was likewise
declared that an election of one operates as a waiver of the
other. For this purpose, a remedy is deemed chosen upon the
filing of the complaint for collection or upon the filing of the
complaint for foreclosure of mortgage. As to an extrajudicial
foreclosure, such mode is deemed elected by the filing of the
application for foreclosure with the Office of the Sheriff of the
Province where the sale is to be made (Bank of America, NT &
SA v. American Realty Corporation, 321 SCRA 659, 667-669;
See also Marilag v. Martinez, G.R. No. 201892, July 22, 2015).

Bank of America categorically ruled that the mere act of
fifing of an ordinary action for collection operates as a waiver
of the mortgagee-creditor’s remedy to foreclose the mortgage.
By the mere act of filing of an ordinary action for collection
against the principal debtors, the creditor is deemed to have
elected a remedy, as a result of which a waiver of the other
must necessarily arise. Corollarily, no final judgment in the
collection suit is required for the rule on waiver to apply (Bank
of America, supra at 670). Thus, by instituting a civil action to
recover on the promissory note, the plaintiff is considered to
have abandoned his mortgage lien on the property (Industrial
Finance Corporation v. Apostol, 177 SCRA 521, 524).

One recent pronouncement in a similar case explained:
"As petitioner had already instituted judicial
foreclosure proceedings over the mortgaged property, she
is now barred from availing herself of an ordinary action
for collection, regardless of whether or not the decision
in the foreclosure case had attained finality. In fine, the
dismissal of the collection case is in order” (Marilag v.
Martinez, G.R. No. 201892, July 22, 2015; Underscoring
by the Court).

2. Based on the above cases, a creditor cannot file a
civil action against the debtor for collection of the debt and
subsequently file an action to foreclose the mortgage. This is

Pactum commlssorium; not a valid agreement

1- Pactum commissorium is “a stipulation empowering
the creditor to appropriate the thing given as guaranty for the
fulfillment of the obligation in the event the obligor fails to
live up to his undertakings, without further formality, such as
foreclosure proceedings, and a public sale.”

!

The elements of pactum commissorium, which enable the
mortgagee to acquire ownership of the mortgaged property
without the need of any foreclosure proceedings, are: (1) there
should be a property mortgaged by way of security for the
payment of the principal obligation, and (2) there should be
a stipulation for automatic appropriation by the creditor of
the thing mortgaged in case of non-payment of the principal
obligation within the stipulated period (Edralin v. Philippine
Veteran’s Bank, 645 SCRA 75, 89, March 9, 2011; Garcia u.
Villar, G.R. No. 158891, June 27, 2012).
2. If the debt is not paid and the debtor defaults, the
creditor cannot ipso facto appropriate the mortgaged property
despite a stipulation to that effect because of the policy against
a pactum commissorium, an agreement that is legally infirm.
Article 2088 of the Civil Code of the Philippines expressly
prohibits the creditor from appropriating the things given by
way of pledge or mortgage, and any stipulation to the contrary
is null and void. This appropriation, to be null and void has
been interpreted to refer to an automatic appropriation
granted by contract to the creditor in case of non-payment
of the obligation within the stipulated period (Bustamante v.
Rosel, 319 SCRA 413, 420).

Court with jurisdiction
1. Traditionally, an action to foreclose a mortgage
has been considered to have the characteristics of an action
that is incapable of pecuniary estimation because the court,

PART II — SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 68 Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage

CIVIL PROCEDURE

—

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

in this action, would have to resolve the issue of whether or
not there is a legal basis for foreclosure, a matter that is not
pecuniarily estimable. From this perspective, the court which
has jurisdiction over such action would be the Regional Trial
Court. Also, under the original provisions of B.P. 129, an
action for foreclosure of a real estate mortgage was deemed a
real action and, hence, cognizable by the RTC.

339

explained, that the MTC has jurisdiction to take cognizance of
real actions or those affecting title to real property, or for the
recovery of possession, or for the partition or condemnation of,
or foreclosure of a mortgage on real property depending on the
assessed value of the property.

5. A more recent case made a definitive declaration
on the matter of jurisdiction of foreclosure of a real estate
mortgage. It ruled that foreclosure of real estate mortgage is a
real action. Hence, it is the assessed value of the property which
determines the court’s jurisdiction. Where the assessed value
of the property is only P13,380.00, the MTC has jurisdiction,
not the RTC. The need for a case-to-case basis determination.
While Russel v. Vestil, included foreclosure as one of those
actions incapable of pecuniary estimation, the same case also
declared that under B.P. 129, as amended, where the action
involves title to, or possession of real property or any interest
therein, the court’s jurisdiction will be determined by the
assessed value of the property involved (Roldan v. Barrios,
G.R. No. 214803, April 23, 2018).

The traditional view no longer applies because of the
amendments introduced by R.A. 7691 and later on adopted
by R.A. 11576 (An Act Further Expanding the Jurisdiction
of the Metropolitan Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts in
Cities, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial
Courts, Amending for the Purposes Batas Pambansa Big.
129, Otherwise Known as The Judiciary Reorganization Act
of 1980,’ As Amended) which considers the assessed value
of the property in real actions. An action to foreclose a real
estate mortgage may also be rightly considered as an action
involving interest in real property, hence, a real action. Under
B.P. 129, as amended, where the action is one “involving title
to, or possession of, real property or any interest therein,” the
determination of jurisdiction shall be made by inquiring into
the assessed value of the property (Secs. 33[3J and 19(2], B.P.
129 as amended). From this point of view, exclusive original
jurisdiction would fall either in the MTC or the RTC depending
on the assessed value of the property involved.
2.

Modes of foreclosure of real estate mortgage; judicial
foreclosure and extrajudicial foreclosure
1. There are two accepted modes of foreclosure of a real
estate mortgage, namely:
(a) Judicial foreclosure pursuant to Rule 68 of the
Rules of Court; and

3. It is significant to note that the late Justice Jose
Y. Feria opined that the action may be filed either with the
Municipal Trial Court or the Regional Trial Court. The MTC
has jurisdiction if the assessed value of the mortgaged real
estate is not more than P20,000.00, or in Metro Manila, not
more than P50,000.00, and the amount of the mortgage debt
is not more than P300,000.00; or in Metro Manila, not more
than P400,000.00; otherwise the action shall be filed with
the RTC (Provisional Remedies and Special Civil Actions,
Reviewer-Primer, Feria and Noche, 2007 Ed., p. 244).

(b) Extrajudicial foreclosure pursuant to Act 3135,
as amended by Act 4118.

2. Extrajudicial foreclosure is the mode to be used if
there is a special power inserted in or attached to the real
estate mortgage contract allowing an extrajudicial foreclosure
sale (Sec. 1, Act 3135, as amended). Where there is no such
special power, the foreclosure shall be done judicially following

the procedure set forth in Rule 68.

Notably, a pronouncement was made in Barrido u.
Nonato, G.R. No. 1 76492, October 20, 2014, in which the Court

Applicability of Rule 68

Judgment on foreclosure; payment or sale

Rule 68 applies only to judicial foreclosures of real estate
mortgage (Sec. 1, Rule 68, Rules of Court).

1. If, after the trial, the court finds that the matters
set forth in the complaint are true, it shall render a judgment
containing the following matters:

Allegations in a complaint for foreclosure
The complaint for foreclosure of real estate mortgage
shall set forth the following:
(a) The date and due execution of the mortgage;
(b) The assignments of the mortgage, if any;
(c) The names and residences of the mortgagor and
mortgagee;
(d) A description of the mortgaged property;
(e) A statement of the date of the note and other
documentary evidence of the obligation secured by the
mortgage;
(f) The amount claimed to be unpaid thereon; and
(g) The names and residences of all persons having
or claiming an interest in the property subordinate in
right to that of the holder of the mortgage, all of whom
shall be made defendants in the action (Sec. 1, Rule 68,
Rules of Court). These include persons who may now
own the property mortgaged. Under Art. 2130 of the
Civil Code of the Philippines, the mortgagor may sell the
property despite a mortgage constituted over it because
a “stipulation forbidding the owner from alienating the
immovable mortgaged shall be void.” Also included as
defendants are the junior encumbrancers earlier referred
to; the persons who may have, under the contract,
obligated to pay the mortgage debt; or those who may

(a) ascertainment of the amount due to the plaintiff
upon the mortgage debt or obligation, including interest
and other charges as approved by the court, as well as

have control over the property mortgaged.
Procedure

Because of the absence of special provisions in Rule 68 on
the mechanics of the suit, a foreclosure suit will proceed like
an ordinary civil action insofar as they are not inconsistent
with Rule 68.

costs;

(b) judgment for the sum found due;
(c) order that the amount found due be paid to the
court or to the judgment obligee within a period of not
less than 90 days nor more than 120 days from the entry
of judgment; and (Bar 2000)
(d) admonition that, in default of such payment,
the property shall be sold at public auction to satisfy the
judgment (Sec. 2, Rule 68, Rules of Court).

2. The judgment of the court on the above matters is
considered a final adjudication of the case and, hence, subject
to challenge by the aggrieved party by appeal or other post¬
judgment remedies.

3. The period given in the rule is not merely a procedural
requirement; it is a substantive right granted to the mortgage
debtor as the last opportunity to pay the debt and save his
mortgaged property from final disposition at the foreclosure
sale. It is one of the two steps necessary to destroy what in law
is known as the mortgagor’s “equity of redemption,” the other
being the sale. It may not be omitted (De Leon v. Ibanez, 95
Phil. 119, 122). Again, it was ruled that this is a substantial
requirement which cannot be omitted (Rosales v. Court of
Appeals, 353 SCRA 179, 188).

Equity of redemption (Bar 1984, 2000, 2012)
1. The period mentioned in the judgment of the court
is the period within which the mortgagor may start exercising
his “equity of redemption,” which is the right to extinguish the

I

mortgage and retain ownership of the property by paying the
debt. The payment may be made even after the foreclosure
sale provided it is made before the sale is confirmed by the
court (GSIS v. CFI, 175 SCRA 19, 25).

2. A clearer statement of the principle is found in
Limpin. v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 166 SCRA 87, 95.
Referring to the 90-day period, it ruled:
“This is the mortgagor’s equity (not right) of
redemption which x x x may be exercised by him even
beyond the 90-day period x x x and even after the
foreclosure itself, provided it be before the order of
confirmation of the sale. After such order of confirmation,
no redemption can be effected any longer x x x.”

Right of redemption

1. The right of redemption is a right granted to a
mortgagor to reacquire the property even after the confirmation
of the sale and the registration of the certificate of sale.

2. There is no right of redemption in a judicial
foreclosure of mortgage under Rule 68. This right exists only
in extrajudicial foreclosures where there is always a right of
redemption within one year from the date of sale (Sec. 6, Act
3135) but interpreted by the Court to mean one year from the
registration of the sale (Santos v. Register of Deeds of Manila,
38 SCRA 42, 45; Reyes v. Tolentino, 42 SCRA 365, 368).
3. In judicial foreclosures, there is only an equity
of redemption which can be exercised prior to the order of
confirmation of the foreclosure sale. This means that after the
foreclosure sale but before its confirmation, the mortgagor may
exercise his right to pay the proceeds of the sale and prevent
the confirmation of the sale. This is the well-recognized
general rule.

This rule, however, has an exception. There is a right of
redemption in a judicial foreclosure if the foreclosure is in favor
of banks as mortgagees, whether the foreclosure be judicial or
extrajudicial. This right of redemption is explicitly provided in

— —

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 68 • Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage

343

par. 1, Sec. 47 of the General Banking Law of 2000. While the
law mentions the redemption period to be “one year after the
sale of the real estate, ” this has been construed to mean “one
year counted from the date of registration of the certificate of
sale in the Registry of Property” (Huerta Alba Resort, Inc. v.
Court of Appeals, et al., 339 SCRA 534, 550-551 citing GSIS
v. CFI, 175 SCRA 19; Limpin v. IAC, 166 SCRA 87, 93; and
Quimson v. PNB, 36 SCRA 26, 32). Hence, if the mortgagee
is a bank, the mortgagor may exercise a right of redemption
even if the foreclosure is judicially made pursuant to Rule 68
of the Rules of Court.
4. The period of redemption in extrajudicial foreclosures
is shortened by the General Banking Act of 2000 (Sec. 47, 2nd
paragraph) when the mortgagor is a juridical person. The
period of redemption is “until, but not after" the registration
of the certificate of sale with the Register of Deeds, “which in
no case shall be more than three (3) months after foreclosure,
whichever is earlier.” Since the law mandates that the
registration should be effected not more than 3 months after
the foreclosure, the redemption cannot be made after the lapse
of 3 months from the foreclosure of the mortgaged property.

Sale of the mortgaged property; effect
1. If the mortgagor fails to pay the sum due within
the period (90-120 days from the entry of judgment) stated
by the court in its judgment, it would be good practice for
the mortgagee to file a motion for the sale of the mortgaged
property because, under the Rules, the court shall order the
sale of the property only “upon motion” (Sec. 3, Rule 68, Rules
of Court).

Jurisprudence suggests that the motion for the sale of the
mortgaged property is non-litigable and may be made ex parte
pursuant to the judgment of foreclosure (Government of P.I. v.
De las Lajigas, 55 Phil. 668, 672). The Court, in Government
of P.I., clarified the rule, thus:

CIVIL PROCEDURE

344

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II
XXX

“x x x It is insisted that the sale could not be effected
without notification to the debtor party of the motion for
the execution of the judgment. This view is, in our opinion,
untenable. The judgment of foreclosure had become
final, and the motion asking for execution was a motion
which in its very nature was grantable as of course; and
the failure to give notice of the motion is no ground for
nullifying the sale.”

The manner of sale shall follow the rules governing
execution sales under Rule 39 (Sec. 3, Rule 68, Rules of Court).
In addition, the provisions under Rule 39 governing the
manner of use of the property pending the redemption (Sec. 31,
Rule 39); disposition of the rents, earnings and income of the
property pending redemption (Sec. 32, Rule 39); and recovery
of the price of the sale by the purchaser and revival of the
judgment (Sec. 34, Rule 39), shall, likewise, be applicable to
judicial foreclosures insofar as they are not inconsistent with
Rule 68 or if such provisions may serve to supplement the
latter rule (Sec. 8, Rule 68, Rules of Court).
2.

Confirmation of the sale
1. After the foreclosure sale has been effected, the
mortgagee should file a motion for the confirmation of the sale
(Sec. 3, Rule 68, Rules of Court). Unlike the motion for the
sale of the mortgaged property, which is done ex parte, the
motion for the confirmation of the sale requires a notice and a
hearing.

In the hearing, the mortgagor will be allowed the
opportunity to show cause why the sale should not be confirmed
(Tiglao v. Botones, 90 Phil. 275, 278). If the mortgagor was
not notified of the hearing, the subsequent confirmation of the
sale is vitiated, and consequently, it is as if no confirmation
ever took place. Being so, the mortgagor may, therefore, still
insist on his right to exercise his equity of redemption even
after the alleged confirmation which is, in fact, of no effect.

——

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage

Rule 68

346

The case of Tiglao is emphatic:
“x x x th[e] Court held that a hearing “is a very
essential part of those proceedings because the hearing
gives the interested parties an opportunity to lay before
the court their reasons why the sale should or should not
be confirmed, and it is the result of this hearing which
diverts the title if the sale is confirmed.
In the case of Grimalt u. Velasquez, 36 Phil. 936,
938, th[e] Court, relying upon its decision in Raymundo
v. Sunico, supra, ruled that “in order that a foreclosure
sale may be validly confirmed by the court, it is necessary
that a hearing be given the interested parties at which
they may have an opportunity to show cause why the sale
should not be confirmed; that a failure to give notice is
good cause for setting aside the sale.
XXX

Notice and hearing of motion for confirmation
are therefore essential to the validity of the order of
confirmation, not only to enable the interested parties
to resist the motion but also to inform them of the time
when their right of redemption is cut off.”

2. After the hearing and the court finds valid grounds
for its confirmation, it shall issue an order confirming the
foreclosure sale. This order confirming the sale is a judgment
in itself and is deemed a final adjudication on the propriety
and merits of the sale. It is, hence, also appealable.
Effect of confirmation of the sale

The confirmation of the sale shall operate to divest the
rights in the property of all the parties to the action and
vest their rights in the purchaser, subject to such rights of
redemption as may be allowed by law (Sec. 3, Rule 68, Rules
of Court).

Effect of finality of the confirmation of the sale; writ of
possession (Bar 2016)

1. The order of confirmation is appealable, and if
not appealed from within the period for appeal, such order

becomes final.

2. Upon the finality of the order of confirmation or upon
the expiration of the period of redemption when allowed by
law, the purchaser at the auction sale or last redemptioner, if
any, shall be entitled to the possession of the property and he
may secure a writ of possession, upon motion, from the court
which ordered the foreclosure unless a third party is actually
holding the same adversely to the judgment obligor (Sec. 3,
Rule 68, Rules of Court).

foreclosing the mortgage, and when there shall be any balance
or residue after paying off the mortgage debt due, the same
shall be paid to junior encumbrancers in the order of their
priority. If there be any further balance after paying them or
if there be no junior encumbrancers, the same shall be paid to
the mortgagor or any person entitled thereto (Sec. 4, Rule 68,
Rules of Court).

Be it noted that the writ of possession shall be issued
upon motion. Hence, the purchaser or last redemptioner must
file a motion for the issuance of a writ of possession in the
court which ordered the foreclosure (See Sec. 3, Rule 68, Rules
of Court). The writ of possession is a means of recognizing and
enforcing rights of the purchaser emphasized in Sec. 3 of Rule
68 which provides that the confirmation of the sale operates
to divest all parties to the action of their respective rights and
vest them in the purchaser.

Registration of the sale

3. The law expressly authorizes the purchaser to
petition for a writ of possession by filing an ex parte motion.
That being so, there is no need for the purchaser to notify
the parties of the proceedings. The motion for issuance of a
writ of possession is an exception to the general three-day
notice rule for motions. Nevertheless, the ex parte nature of
the proceeding does not deny due process to the petitioners
because the issuance of the writ of possession does not bar a
separate case for annulment of the mortgage and foreclosure
sale (Carlos v. Court of Appeals, 537 SCRA 247, 253).

It was also ruled that a pending suit for annulment of the
mortgage or annulment of the foreclosure proceedings does
not defeat the right of the purchaser to a writ of possession
to which the purchaser is entitled as a matter of right. An
injunction to prohibit the issuance or enforcement of the writ
is entirely out of place (Carpo v. Chua, 471 SCRA 471, 486487).

Disposition of the proceeds of the foreclosure sale

The proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged property shall,
after deducting the costs of the sale, be paid to the person

1. A certified copy of the final order of the court
confirming the sale is necessary for the sale to be registered
in the registry of deeds. If there is no right of redemption,
the certificate of title in the name of the mortgagor shall be
cancelled, and a new one shall be issued in the name of the
purchaser (Sec. 7, Rule 68, Rules of Court).

2. When a right of redemption exists, the certificate
of sale and the order confirming the sale shall be registered
and a brief memorandum thereof shall be made by the
register of deeds upon the certificate of title. The certificate
of title, however, in the name of the mortgagor shall not be
cancelled. In the event the property is redeemed, the deed of
redemption shall be registered with the register of deeds and
a brief memorandum thereof shall likewise be made upon the
certificate of title (Sec. 7, Rule 68, Rules of Court).

3. If the property is not redeemed, the final deed of
sale executed by the sheriff in favor of the purchaser at the
foreclosure sale shall be registered with the register of deeds.
The certificate of title in the name of the mortgagor shall then
be cancelled and a new one shall be issued in the name of the
purchaser (Sec. 7, Rule 68, Rules of Court).

Deficiency Judgment; when there is no deficiency judgment
1. If there be a balance due to the plaintiff after
applying the proceeds of the sale, the court, upon motion,
shall render judgment against the defendant for any such
balance. Execution may issue immediately if the balance is all
due at the time of the rendition of the judgment. If not due,

348

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

the plaintiff shall be entitled to execution at such time as the
remaining balance shall become due and such due date shall
be stated in the judgment (Sec. 6, Rule 68, Rules of Court).
Note that the deficiency judgment is, in itself, a judgment,
hence, also appealable.
2. No independent action need be filed to recover the
deficiency from the defendant. The deficiency judgment shall
be rendered upon motion of the mortgagee.
3. It has been suggested that the mortgagor, who is not
the debtor and who merely executed the mortgage to secure
the principal debtor’s obligation, is not Hable for the deficiency
unless he assumed liability for the same in the contract
(Philippine Trust Company v. Echaus Tan Siua, 52 Phil. 852,
856). (Bar 2011)
4. Where the debtor-mortgagor is a non-resident, who,
at the time of the filing of the action for foreclosure and during
the pendency of the proceedings, was outside the Philippines,
a deficiency judgment under Sec. 6 of Rule 68 would not be
procedurally feasible. A deficiency judgment is, by nature,
in personam and jurisdiction over the person is mandatory.
Having been outside the country, jurisdiction over his person
could not have been acquired.

Rule in case there Is a surplus instead of a deficiency
It is the duty of the mortgagee to return to the mortgagor
any surplus in the selling price during the foreclosure sale
(Sulit v. Court of Appeals, 268 SCRA 441, 455-457).
Summary of distinctions between judicial foreclosure and
extrajudicial foreclosure of real estate mortgage

Judicial and extrajudicial foreclosures may be distin¬
guished from each other, as follows:
(a) A judicial foreclosure is governed by the Rules
of Court; an extrajudicial foreclosure is governed by Act

3135, as amended.

— —

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 68 Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage

349

(b) A judicial foreclosure involves the filing of an
independent action; an extrajudicial foreclosure does not
require the filing of an action.

(c) There is an equity of redemption in a judicial
foreclosure and no right of redemption except when the
mortgagee is a banking institution; there is a right of
redemption in extrajudicial foreclosure of mortgage.
(d) In a judicial foreclosure of mortgage, there
could be a deficiency in judgment rendered by the court
in the same proceeding; there can be no judgment for a
deficiency in an extrajudicial foreclosure because there is
no judicial proceeding, although recovery of the deficiency
is allowed.

(e) In a judicial foreclosure, recovery of the
deficiency can be done by mere motion for a deficiency
judgment; in an extrajudicial foreclosure, the recovery
of the deficiency is through an independent action and,
although nothing about the recovery of the deficiency is
provided in Act 3135, there is no prohibition either.

PART II

Rule 69
PARTITION
Preliminaries
1. An action for partition is typically brought by a
person claiming to be the owner of a specified property against
defendants whom the plaintiff recognizes as co-owners
(Ignacio v. Reyes, G.R. No. 213192, July 12, 2017). The Civil
Code of the Philippines defines partition as the separation,
division, and assignment of a thing held in common among
those to whom it may belong (Art. 1079, Civil Code of the
Philippines; See also Vda. de Viray v. Spouses Usi, G.R. No.
192486, November 21, 2012). Partition is the division between
two or more persons of real or personal property, owned in
common, by setting apart their respective interests so that
they may enjoy and possess these in severalty, resulting in
the partial or total extinguishment of co-ownership (Leoveras
v. Valdez, 652 SCRA 61, 75-76).

2. Partition among heirs is not legally deemed a
conveyance of real property resulting in change of ownership.
It is not a transfer of property from one to the other, but rather,
a confirmation or ratification of title or right of property that
an heir is renouncing in favor of another heir who accepts
and receives the inheritance. It is merely a designation and
segregation of that part which belongs to each heir (Heirs of
Ureta, Sr. v. Heirs of Ureta, 657 SCRA 555, 596 [2011]).
3. Partition presupposes the existence of a co-ownership
over a property between two or more persons. Thus, it was
ruled that a division of property cannot be ordered by the
court unless the existence of co-ownership is first established,
and that an action for partition will not lie if the claimant has
no rightful interest in the property (Co Giuk Lun v. Co, 655
SCRA 131, 138).
350

CIVIL ACTIONS
—RuleSPECIAL
69 — Partition

351

4. The rule allowing partition originates from a wellknown principle embodied in the Civil Code that no co-owner
shall be obliged to remain in the co-ownership. Because of
this rule, he may demand, at any time, the partition of the
property owned in common, insofar as his share is concerned
(Art. 494, Civil Code of the Philippines).
5. There are, nevertheless, instances when a co-owner
may not demand partition at any time as when: (Bar 2010)
(a) There is an agreement among the co-owners to
keep the property undivided for a certain period of time
but not exceeding 10 years. This term may, however, be
extended by a new agreement (Art. 494, Civil Code of the
Philippines);
(b) When partition is prohibited by the donor or
testator for a period not exceeding 20 years (Arts. 494
and 1083, Civil Code of the Philippines);
(c) When partition is prohibited by law (Art. 494,
Civil Code of the Philippines);
(d) When the property is not subject to a physical
division and to do so would render it unserviceable for
the use for which it is intended (Art. 495, Civil Code of the
Philippines); (Bar 2011) or
(e) When the condition imposed upon voluntary
heirs before they can demand partition has not yet been
fulfilled (Art. 1084, Civil Code of the Philippines).

6. One of the legal effects of partition, whether by
agreement among the co-owners or by judicial proceeding, is
to terminate the co-ownership and, consequently, to make the
previous co-owners the absolute and exclusive owner of the
share allotted to him (Leoveras v. Valdez, 652 SCRA 61, 77,

June 15, 2011).
Prescription of action; effect
1. An important principle to note is that prescription
does not run in favor of a co-owner or co-heir against his co¬
owner or co-heirs as long as there is a recognition of the co-

352

CIVIL PROCEDURE

PART II

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

ownership, expressly or impliedly (Art. 494, Civil Code of the
Philippines).

2. A case held that while the action to demand partition
of a co-owned property does not prescribe, a co-owner may
acquire ownership thereof by prescription where there exists
a clear repudiation of the co-ownership and the co-owners
are apprised of the claim of adverse and exclusive ownership
(Heirs of Restar v. Heirs of Cichon, 475 SCRA 731, 738).

The right of action to demand partition does not
prescribe (De Castro v. Echarri, 20 Phil. 23), except where one
of the interested parties openly and adversely occupies the
property without recognizing the co-ownership, in which case,
acquisitive prescription may set in (Regalado, Remedial Law
Compendium, Volume I, Tenth Edition, 2010 Ed., p. 864).

Court with jurisdiction
1. The primary issue to be determined in an action for
partition boils down to whether or not the plaintiff has a right
to partition, an issue incapable of pecuniary estimation. Thus,
from this perspective, it used to be argued that the action
would be cognizable by the Regional Trial Court.

However, an action for partition of real property also
involves “interest in real property.” Section 19(2) of B.P. 129,
as amended by R.A. 11576, requires that in all civil actions
involving the title to, or possession of, real property, or any
interest therein, the jurisdiction should be determined by
inquiring into the assessed value of the real property. Under
this provision, an action for partition of real property may be
filed with the MTC depending on the assessed value of the
property.
2. Justice Jose Y. Feria believes that the action may
be filed either with the MTC or the RTC. If the subject
matter of the action is personal property valued at not
more than P300,000.00, and in Metro Manila at not more
than P400,000.00; or real property valued at not more than
P20,000.00, and in Metro Manila at not more than P50,000.00,

the Municipal Trial Courts have jurisdiction. Beyond these
amounts, the Regional Trial Courts have jurisdiction
(Provisional Remedies and Special Civil Actions, ReviewerPrimer, Feria and Noche, 2007 Ed., p. 266).
3. In a relatively recent case, the Court ruled that
jurisdiction over partition of real property would depend upon

the assessed value of the property.

The case was one for partition of real property filed by
a former husband after his marriage to respondent marriage
was declared void, where the Court upheld the MTCC decision
which took cognizance of the case, the assessed value of the
property being merely P8,080.00. This amount, held the
Court, does not exceed the required limit of P20,000.00 for real
actions outside Metro Manila to fall within the jurisdiction of
the MTCC. Such court has jurisdiction to take cognizance of
real actions or those affecting title to real property, or for the
recovery of possession, or for the partition or condemnation
of, or foreclosure of a mortgage on real property on the basis
of the property’s assessed value pursuant to Sec. 33 of B.P.
129, as amended by R.A. 7691 (Barrido v. Nonato, G.R. No.
176492, October 20, 2014).

Note: The same is adopted later on by R.A. 11576 (An Act
Further Expanding the Jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Trial
Courts, Municipal Trial Courts in Cities, Municipal Trial
Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts, Amending for the
Purposes Batas Pambansa Big. 129, Otherwise Known as The
Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980,’ As Amended).
4. However, where the action is not merely for partition
but annulment of title and documents, the action is incapable
of pecuniary estimation and thus, cognizable by the RTC
(Spouses Butiong v. Plazo, G.R. No. 187524, August 5, 2015).
This should be taken to mean that the primary purpose of
the action is not partition of real property but annulment of

documents.

PART II

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Modes of partition
1.

Partition may be made in either of two ways:
(a) By agreement of the parties; or
(b) By judicial proceedings under the Rules of

Court (Art. 496, Civil Code of the Philippines) when the
parties cannot reach an agreement (Figuracion-Gerilla v.
Vda. de Figuration, 499 SCRA 484, 490).
2. The right of the co-owners to opt for an agreement
of partition in lieu of a judicial partition is recognized by the
Rules of Court. The provisions of Sec. 12 of Rule 69 thereof
provides that “Nothing in this Rule x x x shall be construed
x x x as to restrict or prevent persons holding real estate jointly
or in common from making an amicable partition thereof by
agreement and suitable instruments of conveyance without
recourse to an action.” If the co-owners cannot agree on the
partition of the property, the only recourse is the filing of an
action for partition.

Stages/phases in partition
1. The Court has described the stages or phases of
partition as follows:

“The first phase of a partition and/or accounting
suit is taken up with the determination of whether or not
a co-ownership in fact exists, and a partition is proper
(i.e., not otherwise legally proscribed) and may be made
by voluntary agreement of all the parties interested in
the property. This phase may end with a declaration
that plaintiff is not entitled to have a partition either
because a co-ownership does not exist, or partition is
legally prohibited. It may end, on the other hand, with
an adjudgment that a co-ownership does in truth exist,
partition is proper in the premises, and an accounting of
rents and profits received by the defendant from the real
estate in question is in order x x x.”

The second phase commences when it appears that
“the parties are unable to agree upon the partition”

—Rule
69 — Partition

directed by the court. In that event[,] partition shall be
done for the parties by the [c]ourt with the assistance of
not more than three (3) commissioners. This second stage
may well also deal with the rendition of the accounting
itself and its approval by the [cjourt after the parties have
been accorded opportunity to be heard thereon, and an
award for the recovery by the party or parties thereto
entitled of their just share in the rents and profits of the
real estate in question x x x” (Lacbayan u. Samoy, 645
SCRA 677, 688 citing Municipality of Bihan v. Garcia,
180 SCRA 576; Italics supplied).

2. The settlement of the issue on ownership is the first
stage in an action for partition, and the action will not lie if
the claimant has no rightful interest in the property in dispute
(Garingan u. Garingan, 455 SCRA 480, 488).

Multiple appeals

The action for partition is subject to multiple appeals and
would require a record on appeal. Multiple appeals are allowed
in special proceedings, actions for recovery of property with
accounting, actions for partition of property with accounting,
special civil actions of eminent domain and foreclosure of
mortgage. The rationale behind allowing more than one appeal
in the same case is to enable the rest of the case to proceed
in the event that a separate and distinct issue is resolved by
the court and held to be final (Roman Catholic Archbishop of
Manila v. Court of Appeals, 258 SCRA 186, 194).

Who may file action for partition; defendants
1. The action shall be brought by the person who has
a right to compel the partition of real estate (Sec. 1, Rule 69,
Rules of Court) or of an estate composed of personal property,
or of both real and personal property (Sec. 13, Rule 69, Rules
of Court).
2. The plaintiff is a person who is supposed to be a co¬
owner of the property or estate sought to be partitioned. The
defendants are all the co-owners.

366

CIVIL PROCEDURE

PART II

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

Indeed, the presence of all indispensable parties is a
condition sine qua non for the exercise of judicial power. It is
precisely when an indispensable party is not before the court
that the action should be dismissed. Thus, the plaintiff is
mandated to implead all the indispensable parties, considering
that the absence of one such party renders all subsequent
actions of the court null and void for want of authority to act,
not only as to the absent parties but even as to those present.
One who is a party to a case is not bound by any decision
of the court, otherwise, he will be deprived of his right to
due process. Without the presence of all the other heirs as
plaintiffs, the trial court could not validly render judgment
and grant relief in favor of the private respondent. The failure
of the private respondent to implead the other heirs as partiesplaintiffs constituted a legal obstacle to the trial court and
the appellate court’s exercise of judicial power over the said
case, and rendered any orders or judgments rendered therein
a nullity. (Sepulveda, Sr. v. Pelaez, G.R. No. 152195, January
31, 2005).

Matters to be alleged in the complaint
1. The plaintiff shall: (a) state in his complaint (i) the
nature and extent of his title, and (ii) an adequate description
of the real or personal estate of which partition is demanded,

VOLUME II

All the co-owners must be joined. Accordingly, an action
will not lie without the joinder of all co-owners and other
persons having interest in the property (Moran, Comments on
the Rules of Court, 1997 Ed., citing Garcia de Lara v. Gonzales
de Lara, 2 Phil. 294; Reyes v. Cordero, 46 Phil. 658, 661-662).
All the co-owners, therefore, are indispensable parties. (Bar
2009)
3. Section 1, Rule 69 of the Rules of Court provides that
in an action for partition, all persons interested in the property
shall be joined as defendants. Thus, all the co-heirs and
persons having an interest in the property are indispensable
parties; as such, an action for partition will not lie without the
joinder of the said parties.

and (b) join as defendants all other persons interested in
the
property (Secs. 1 and 13, Rule 69, Rules of Court).
He must
also include a demand for an accounting of the rents, profits
and other income from the property which he may be
entitled
to as his share (Sec. 8, Rule 69, Rules of Court).
These cannot be demanded in another action because
they are parts of the cause of action for partition.
These will
be barred if not set up in the same action pursuant to the rule
against splitting a single cause of action.
2. When the allegations in the complaint allege that the
plaintiff asserts exclusive ownership of the property sought
to
be partitioned, the nature of the action is not one for partition.
It is an action for the recovery of property (De la Cruz u. Court
of Appeals, 412 SCRA 282, 289).
Order for partition; final order Is appealable
1. During the trial, the court shall determine whether
or not the plaintiff is truly a co-owner of the property, that
there is indeed a co-ownership among the parties, and that
a partition is not legally proscribed, thus, may be allowed.
If the court so finds that the facts are such that a partition
would be in order, and that the plaintiff has a right to demand
partition, the court will issue an order for partition.
2. If, after the trial, the court finds that the plaintiff has
the right to a partition, the court shall order the partition of
the property among all the parties in interest. Worthy of note
is the present rule that a final order decreeing (a) partition

and (b) accounting may be appealed by any party aggrieved
thereby (Sec. 2, Rule 69, Rules of Court).

Partition by agreement
Observe that the order for partition is one that
directs the parties or co-owners to partition the property
where they may make the partition among themselves by
proper instruments of conveyance, if they agree among
themselves. If they do agree, the court shall then confirm the

partition so agreed upon by all the parties, and such partition,
together with the order of the court confirming the same, shall
be recorded in the registry of deeds of the place where the
property is situated (Sec. 2, Rule 69, Rules of Court).

2. Instead of the property being so assigned,
an
interested party may ask that the same be sold, in which case,
the court shall order the commissioners to sell the property at
a public sale (Sec. 5, Rule 69, Rules of Court).

2. There always exists the possibility that the co¬
owners are unable to agree upon the partition. If they cannot

Report of the commissioners

partition the property among themselves, the next stage in
the action will follow, and this stage is the appointment of
commissioners.

Partition by court-appointed commissioners; appointment
If the parties are unable to agree upon the partition,
the court shall appoint not more than three commissioners,
who are competent and disinterested persons, to make the
partition for the parties (Sec. 3, Rule 69, Rules of Court;
Honculada v. Ragay, 450 SCRA 66, 71). The appointment of
commissioners, which is mandatory under the circumstances,
presupposes that the parties cannot agree upon the partition
among themselves.

Observe that the provision authorizes the commissioners

merely to make or effect the partition (Sec. 3, Rule 69, Rules
of Court). Nothing in the provision grants them the authority
to adjudicate on questions of title or ownership of property.
Hence, Sec. 12 of Rule 69 emphasizes that partition of property
under Rule 69 is not meant to prejudice, defeat, or destroy the
rights of any person holding a title paramount to the title of
the parties among whom the partition shall have been made.

When division would be prejudicial
1. If the commissioners determine that the property
cannot be divided if the interests of the parties will be
prejudiced, the court may order that it be assigned to one of
the parties willing to take the same, provided that such party
pays to the other parties such amounts as the commissioners
deem equitable (Sec. 5, Rule 69, Rules of Court).

The commissioners shall make a full and accurate report
to the court of all their proceedings as to the partition. Upon
the filing of such report, copies thereof shall be served by the
clerk of court upon all interested parties with a notice that
they are allowed 10 days within which to file objections to the
findings of the report, if they so desire (Sec. 6, Rule 69, Rules
of Court).
Action of the court upon the report of the commissioners

The court may, upon hearing, take any of the following
actions on the report of the commissioners:
(a) accept the report and render judgment in
accordance with the same;

(b) recommit the same to the commissioners for
further report of facts, instead of accepting the report;
(c)

sioners;

set aside the report and appoint new commis¬

(d) accept the report in part and reject it in part; or
(e) make such order and render such judgment
that shall effectuate a fair and just partition of the estate
(Sec. 7, Rule 69, Rules of Court).

Proceedings before the commissioners; no binding effect
The proceedings had before the commissioners shall not
bind the parties or pass title to the property until the court
shall have accepted the report of the commissioners and
rendered judgment thereon (Sec. 6, Rule 69, Rules of Court).

Judgment of partition; effects of judgment
1. The judgment shall have the effect of vesting in each
party to the action the portion of the real estate assigned to
him (Sec. 11, Rule 69, Rules of Court).

2. If the whole property is assigned to one of the parties
upon his paying to the others the sum or sums ordered by the
court, the effect of the judgment shall be to vest in the party
making the payment the whole of the real estate free from any
interest on the part of the other parties to the action (Sec. 11,
Rule 69, Rules of Court).

3. If the property is sold and the sale is confirmed by
the court, the effect of the judgment shall be to vest the real
estate in the purchaser or purchasers making the payment
or payments, free from the claims of any of the parties to the
action (Sec. 11, Rule 69, Rules of Court).
Recording of the judgment

A certified copy of the judgment shall be recorded in the
registry of deeds of the place where the real estate is situated,
and the expenses of such recording shall be taxed as part of
the costs of the action (Sec. 11, Rule 69, Rules of Court).
Rule when there are expenses to be paid from the estate
In a situation where there remains an issue as to the
expenses chargeable to the estate, partition is inappropriate.
The determination of the expenses like those related to the
deceased’s final illness and burial, which are chargeable to
the estate, cannot be done in an action for partition. Thus,
the heirs have to first submit the decedent father’s estate to
settlement because in estate settlement proceedings, there
is a proper procedure for the accounting of all expenses for
which the estate must answer. If it is any consolation at all to
petitioner, the heirs or distributees of the properties may take
possession thereof even before the settlement of accounts, as
long as they first file a bond conditioned on the payment of the

FORCIBLE ENTRY AND UNLAWFUL DETAINER
Actions to recover possession of real property
Under existing law and jurisprudence, there are three
kinds of actions available to recover possession of real
property, namely:
(a) accion interdictal;

(b) accion publiciana; and

accion reivindicatoria (Cano Vda. de Viray v.
Spouses Usi, G.R. No. 192486, November 21, 2012).
(c)

Distinctions

The following are the simplified distinctions among the
above actions:
(a) Accion interdictal is the summary action for
either forcible entry or detentacion, where the defendant’s
possession of the property is illegal ab initio; or for
unlawful detainer or desahucio, where the defendant’s
possession was originally lawful but ceased to be so by
the expiration of his right to possess, both of which must
be brought within one (1) year from the date of actual
entry on the land, in case of forcible entry; and from the
date of last demand, in case of unlawful detainer. (Bar
2014)

(b) Accion publiciana, is a plenary action for
recovery of the right to possess real property when the
action is brought more than one (1) year from the accrual
of the cause of action.
362

363

Also, if the dispossession did not occur
either under
circumstances of unlawful detainer or forcible entry, the
action becomes one for accion publiciana (For further
readings, see Balibago Faith Baptist Church, Inc. v.
Faith
in Christ Jesus Baptist Church, Inc., G.R. No. 191527,
August 22, 2016).
(c) Accion reiuindicatoriaor accion de
reivindicacion
is an action which seeks the recovery of ownership and
includes the jus possidendi. It is an action whereby
plaintiff alleges ownership over a parcel of land and seeks
recovery of its full possession. It is different from accion
interdictal or accion publiciana where plaintiff merely
alleges proof of a better right to possess without claim of
title (Serdoncillo v. Benolirao, 297 SCRA 448, 459-460;
For further readings, see Tagalog v. Vda. de Gonzalez,
G.R. No. 201286, July 18, 2014).

Court with jurisdiction over forcible entry and unlawful
detainer (accion Interdictal) (Bar 2013)
1. The actions for forcible entry and unlawful detainer
are within the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the
Municipal Trial Court, Municipal Circuit Trial Court and the
Metropolitan Trial Court (Sec. 33(2], B.P. 129, as amended)
and shall be governed by the rules on summary procedure
irrespective of the amount of damages or unpaid rentals
sought to be recovered (Sec. 3, Rule 70, Rules of Court).
2. It needs to be emphasized that the jurisdiction of the
Municipal Trial Court or Metropolitan Trial Court, in cases of
forcible entry and unlawful detainer, is described as “exclusive
and original” (Sec. 33[2], B.P. 129, as amended).

3. Jurisdiction in ejectment cases is determined by
the allegations pleaded in the complaint. It cannot be made
to depend on the defenses set up in the answer or pleadings
filed by the defendant. Neither can it be made to depend on
the exclusive characterization of the case by one of the parties.
The test for determining the sufficiency of those allegations is
whether, admitting the facts alleged, the court could render a

that there are two entirely distinct and different causes of
action under Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, namely:
(a) A case for forcible entry, which is an action
to recover possession of a property from the defendant
whose occupation thereof is illegal from the beginning
since he acquired possession by force, intimidation,

364

Court with jurisdiction In action publiciana and action

reivindicatorla
1. Both actions are real actions. As such, jurisdiction
is determined by the assessed value of the property involved
(Secs. 33[3] and 19[2], B.P. 129, as amended).
2. The rule that action publiciana lies with the
Regional Trial Court, regardless of the value of the property,
no longer holds true. As things now stand under R.A. 11576, a
distinction must be made between those properties where the
assessed value does not exceed P400,000.00 (in which case, an
action publiciana should be filed with the MTC). Where the
assessed value is greater than the amounts mentioned, the
Regional Trial Court has jurisdiction.
3. The jurisdiction of the court under R.A. 7691
(likewise adopted in R.A. 11576) over an action involving title
to or possession of land is now determined by the assessed
value of the said property and not the market value thereof.
The assessed value of real property is the fair market value
of the real property multiplied by the assessment level. It is
synonymous to taxable value. The fair market value is the
price at which a property may be sold by a seller, who is not
compelled to sell, and bought by a buyer, who is not compelled
to buy (See Hilario v. Salvador, 457 SCRA 815, 826; Salvador
v. Patricia, Inc., G.R. No. 195834, November 9, 2016).

Definitions of the actions; general distinctions
1. The actions of forcible entry and unlawful detainer
belong to the class of actions known by the generic name action
interdictal (ejectment). In other words, action interdicted
comprises two distinct causes of action, namely, forcible entry
(detentacion) and unlawful detainer (desahucio). Both the
Rules of Court, as well as judicial pronouncements, emphasize

366

threat, strategy or stealth; and (Bar 2013)

(b) A case for unlawful detainer, which is an action
for recovery of possession from the defendant whose
possession of the property was inceptively lawful by virtue
of a contract (express or implied) with the plaintiff, but
became illegal when he continued his possession despite
the termination of his right thereunder (Sarmienta v.
Manalite Homeowners Association, 632 SCRA 538, 546;
Balibago Faith Baptist Church, Inc. v. Faith in Christ
Jesus Baptist Church Inc., G.R. No. 191527, August 22,
2016).
2. In forcible entry, one is deprived of physical
possession of real property by means of force, intimidation,
strategy, threats, or stealth; whereas in unlawful detainer,
one illegally withholds possession from the plaintiff after the
expiration or termination of his right to hold possession under
any contract, express or implied. The two are distinguished
from each other in that in forcible entry, the possession of the
defendant is illegal from the beginning, and that the issue is
which party has prior de facto possession; while in unlawful
detainer, possession of the defendant is originally legal but
became illegal due to the expiration or termination of the
right to possess (Valdez v. Court of Appeals, 489 SCRA 369,
376; Balibago Faith Baptist Church, Inc. v. Faith in Christ
Jesus Baptist Church, Inc., G.R. No. 191527, August 22, 2016;
French v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 220057, July 12, 2017).

Issue In forcible entry and unlawful detainer (actions for
ejectment)
It is settled that in ejectment proceedings, the only
issue for the court’s resolution is, who between the parties is

CIVIL PROCEDURE

366

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

entitled to the physical or material possession of the subject
property. Issues as to ownership are not involved, except only
for the purpose of determining the issue of possession (G.R.
No. 225176, January 19, 2018). When, in forcible entry and
unlawful detainer cases, the defendant raises the issue of
ownership, and the question of possession cannot be resolved
without deciding the issue of ownership, the issue of ownership
shall be resolved only to determine the issue of possession
(Sec. 33[2], B.P. 129 as amended).

Allegations in forcible entry

One case held that two allegations are indispensable
in actions for forcible entry to enable first level courts to
acquire jurisdiction over them: first, that the plaintiff had
prior physical possession of the property; and second, that the
defendant deprived him of such possession by means of force,
intimidation, threats, strategy, or stealth (Abad v. Farrales,
647 SCRA 473, 479, April 11, 2011). These allegations are not
required in an unlawful detainer case.
2. Unlawfully entering the subject property, erecting
a structure thereon and excluding the lawful possessor there¬
from would necessarily imply the use of force. In order to
constitute force, the trespasser does not have to institute a
state of war. No other proof is necessary (Antazo v. Doblada,
611 SCRA 586, 594). The acts of going to the property and
excluding the lawful possessor therefrom necessarily imply
exertion of force over the property. The words “by force,
intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth” include every
situation or condition under which one person can wrongfully
enter upon real property to exclude another, who has prior
possession (Banes v. Lutheran Church in the Philippines, 475
SCRA 13, 34-35).
1.

3. Prior physical possession is the primary consideration
in a forcible entry case. A party who can prove prior possession
can recover such possession even against the owner himself
(Antazo v. Doblada, 611 SCRA 586, 593).

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 70 Forcible Entry and Unlawful Detainer

367

Allegations in unlawful detainer
1. Be it noted that in unlawful detainer is an action
to recover possession of real property from one who illegally
withholds possession after the expiration or termination of
his right to hold possession under any contract, express or
implied. The possession of the defendant in unlawful detainer
is originally legal but became illegal due to the expiration or
termination of the right to possess.
As such, jurisprudence holds that in unlawful detainer
cases, the issue to be resolved is the right of physical or
material possession of the subject real property independent
of any claim of ownership by any of the parties involved
(Mendoza v. Court of Appeals, 452 SCRA 117, 121; Tagalog v.
Vda. de Gonzalez, G.R. No. 201286, July 18, 2014).
An allegation that the defendant is unlawfully withholding
possession from the plaintiff is deemed sufficient, without
necessarily employing the terminology of the law. The phrase
“unlawfully withholding” has been held to imply possession
on the part of the defendant, which was legal in the beginning,
having no other source than a contract, express or implied,
and which later expires as a right and is being withheld by
defendant (Rosa Rica Sales Center, Inc. v. Ong, 467 SCRA 35).
2. A complaint sufficiently alleges a cause of action for
unlawful detainer if it recites the following:

(a) Initially, possession of property by the defendant
was by contract with or by tolerance of the plaintiff;

(b) Eventually, such possession became illegal
upon notice by plaintiff to defendant of the termination

of the latter’s right of possession;
(c) Thereafter, the defendant remained in
possession of the property and deprived the plaintiff of
the enjoyment thereof; and
(d) Within one (1) year from the last demand on
defendant to vacate the property, the plaintiff instituted
the complaint for ejectment (Romullo u. Samahang

Association, Inc., 632SCRA 411, 419-420, October 6, 2010;
See also Dionisio v. Linsangan, 644 SCRA 424, 431; See
also French v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 220057, July 12,
2017). Since the allegations in the complaint determine
both the nature of the action and the jurisdiction of the
court, the complaint must specifically allege the facts
constituting unlawful detainer. In the absence of these
factual allegations, an action for unlawful detainer is not
the proper remedy and the municipal trial court has no
jurisdiction over the case (De Guzman-Fuerte v. Spouses
Estomo, G.R. No. 223399, April 23, 2018).
When the complaint fails to aver facts how entry was effected
1. To give the court jurisdiction to effect the ejectment
of an occupant or deforciant from the land, it is necessary
that the complaint must sufficiently show such a statement of
facts as to bring the party clearly within the class of cases for
which the statutes provide a remedy, without resort to parol
testimony, as these proceedings are summary in nature.

The jurisdictional facts must appear on the face
complaint.
When the complaint fails to aver facts
of the
constitutive of forcible entry or unlawful detainer, as where
it does not state how entry was effected or how and when
dispossession started, the remedy should either be an accion
publiciana or accion reivindicatoria (Jose v. Alfuerto, G.R. No.
169380, November 26, 2012; Citation omitted; Munoz v. Court
of Appeals, 214 SCRA 216, 223-224; Suarez v. Emboy, G.R.
No. 187944, March 12, 2014).
2.

Summary nature of the actions

The proceedings in forcible entry and unlawful detainer
actions are summary in nature and designed to provide for an
expeditious means of protecting actual possession or the right
to possession of the property involved (Tubiano u. Razo, 335
SCRA 531, 536; Sudaria v. Quiambao, 537 SCRA 689, 697).
Both of these actions fall under the coverage of the Rules on

unpaid rentals sought to be recovered (Sec. 3, Rule 70, Rules

Possession as the issue
1. Possession, in the eyes of the law, does not mean
that a man has to have his feet on every square meter of the
ground before he is deemed to be in possession (De la Rosa v.
Carlos, 414 SCRA 226, 235).

2. Since the issue in ejectment cases is mere possession,
it is worth remembering that the decision in an ejectment case
does not bind the title to or ownership of the land or building.
It does not also bar an action between the same parties
respecting title to the property (Balanon-Anicete v. Balanon,
402 SCRA 514, 518).
3. Where the basic issue is not possession but
interpretation, enforcement and/or rescission of the contract,
the same is no longer an ejectment suit. Hence, it is beyond
the jurisdiction of the MTC to hear and determine (Villena v.
Chavez, 415 SCRA 33, 41).
4. Where the action seeks to recover ownership from
the defendant including the possession of the property, the
action is no longer interdictal but an accion reivindicatoria or
accion de reivindicacion (Serdoncillo v. Benolirao, 297 SCRA
448, 459).

Meaning of prior physical possession In forcible entry cases
1. The Court, in referring to “prior physical possession”
by the plaintiff in forcible entry cases, did not refer to a literal
concept of physical possession. Thus, it ruled:
“As a rule, the word “possession” in forcible entry
suits indeed refers to nothing more than prior physical
possession or possession de facto, not possession de jure
or legal possession in the sense contemplated in civil law.
Title is not the issue, and the absence of it is not a ground
for the courts to withhold relief from the parties in an
ejectment case.

370

Rule 70

VOLUME II

The Court, however, has consistently ruled in a
number of cases that while prior physical possession is
an indispensable requirement in forcible entry cases,
xxx possession can be acquired not only by material
occupation, but also by the fact that a thing is subject to
the action of one’s will or by the proper acts and legal
formalities established for acquiring such right.

Possession can be acquired by juridical acts. These
are acts to which the law gives the force of acts of
possession. Examples of these are donations, succession,
execution and registration of public instruments,
inscription of possessory in formation titles and the like.
The reason for this exceptional rule is that possession in
the eyes of the law does not mean that a man has to have
his feet on every square meter of ground before it can be
said that he is in possession. It is sufficient that petitioner
was able to subject the property to the action of his will
xxx” (Mangaser v. Ugay, G.R. No. 204926, December 3,
2014).

The Court, explaining the rationale for including juridical
acts in the concept of physical possession in forcible entry
cases, continued:
“If the Court were x x x to disregard juridical acts to
obtain prior possession, then it would create an absurd
situation. It would be putting premium in favor of land
intruders against Torrens title holders, who spent months,
or even years, in order to register their land, and who
religiously paid real property taxes thereon. They cannot
immediately repossess their properties simply because
they have to prove their literal and physical possession of
their property prior to the controversy. The Torrens title
holders would have to resort to ordinary civil procedure by
filing either an accion publiciana or accion reinvidicatoria
and undergo arduous and protracted litigation x x x. It
will defeat the very purpose of the summary procedure of
an action for forcible entry” (Mangaser u. Ugay, G.R. No.
204926, December 3, 2014).

2. The law does not require that a person should have
his feet on every square meter of the ground before it can be

said that he is in possession thereof. Visiting the property
on weekends and holidays is evidence of actual or physical
possession. The fact that one’s residence is somewhere else,
by itself, does not result in loss of possession of the subject
property (Fahrenbach v. Pangilinan, G.R. No. 224549, August
7,2017).

Nature of the entry is to be considered
1. In forcible entry, the possession of the defendant is
illegal from the very beginning having deprived the actual
possessor of his possession by force, intimidation, threat,
strategy or stealth (Sec. 1, Rule 70, Rules of Court; Tirona v.
Alejo, 367 SCRA 17, 29; For related readings, see Heirs oflsip
v. Quintos, G.R. No. 1 72008, August 1, 2012).
In unlawful detainer, the possession of the defendant is
legal in the beginning which, however, subsequently becomes
illegal because of the expiration or termination of the right to
have possession, by virtue of any contract, express or implied,
and after a demand to vacate was not heeded by the defendant
(Sec. 1, Rule 70, Rules of Court; Heirs of Demetrio Melchor
v. Melchor, 415 SCRA 726, 733; Esmaquel u. Coprada, 638
SCRA 428, 436).

2. From jurisprudence, therefore, we learn that it is the
nature of the defendant’s entry into the land which determines
the cause of action, whether it is forcible entry or unlawful
detainer. If the entry is illegal, then the action which should
be filed against the intruder is forcible entry. If, however, the
entry is legal but the possession thereafter becomes illegal,
the case is unlawful detainer (Suarez v. Emboy, G.R. No.
187944, March 12, 2014).

Allegations required
1. In forcible entry, the plaintiff must allege in the
complaint, and prove, that he was in prior physical possession
of the property in dispute until he was deprived thereof by
the defendant by any of the means provided in Sec. 1, Rule

372

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

70 of the Rules either by force, intimidation, threat, strategy,
or stealth (Sarmienta v. Manalite Homeowners Association,
Inc., 632 SCRA 538, 545-547). The plaintiff is not required
to expressly employ the language of the law. It is sufficient
for him to allege facts showing that the dispossession took
place under such circumstances (Nunez v. SLTEAS Phoenix
Solutions, Inc., 618 SCRA 134, 142).

The above allegations are not required in unlawful
detainer (Heirs of Demetrio Melchor u. Melchor, 415 SCRA
726, 733; See also Spouses Gaela v. Spouses Tan, G.R. No.
185627, March 15, 2017). Instead, in unlawful detainer, there
must be an allegation in the complaint of how the possession
of the defendant started or continued, that is, by virtue of
lease or any contract, and that he held possession of the land
or building after the expiration or termination of the right to
hold possession by virtue of any contract, express or implied
(Sarmienta v. Manalite Homeowners Association, Inc., 632
SCRA 538, 545-546).
2. In forcible entry, a demand to vacate is not required
before the filing of the action because the occupancy is illegal
from the very beginning. Notice that the requirement for
demand in Sec. 2 of Rule 70 refers to a demand to vacate
upon the lessee. There is no lessee in an action for forcible
entry because of the nature of the entry on the land by the
defendant.

In unlawful detainer, demand to vacate is necessary as a
rule and within one-year from the last demand on defendant to
vacate the property, the plaintiff may institute the complaint
for ejectment (Romullo v. Samahang Magkakapitbahay ng
Bayanihan Compound Homeowners Association, Inc., 632
SCRA 411, 420).
3. The one-year period within which to bring an action
for forcible entry is generally counted from the date of actual
entry on the land, except that when the entry was made
through stealth, the one-year period is counted from the time
the plaintiff learned thereof (Balibago Faith Baptist Church,

Forcible Entry and Unlawful Detainer

Rule 70

373

Inc. v. Faith in Christ Jesus Baptist Church, Inc., G.R. No. '
191527, August 22, 2016).
In unlawful detainer, it is counted from the date of the last
demand to vacate (Romullo v. Samahang Magkakapitbahay
ng Bayanihan Compound Homeowners Association, Inc., 632
SCRA 411, 420, October 6, 2010; Republic v. National Power
Corporation, G.R. No. 194880, June 20, 2012). When the
demand to vacate is not heeded, then the unlawful withholding
of possession begins (Esmaquel v. Coprada, 638 SCRA 428,
436, December 15, 2010).
When defendant occupies premises by mere tolerance
1. If the defendant stays in the premises by mere
tolerance of the owner, the possession becomes unlawful upon
failure to comply with the demand to vacate made by the
owner. The unlawful withholding of possession is to be counted
from the date of the demand to vacate and the possessor by
tolerance refuses to comply with such demand (Areal v. Court
of Appeals, 285 SCRA 34, 43). With the clear realization that
they are settling on land that they do not own, occupants of
a land by mere tolerance of the owners should always expect
that one day, they have to vacate the same (Guyamin u. Flores,
G.R. No. 202189, April 25, 2017).

While tolerance is lawful, such possession becomes
illegal upon demand to vacate by the owner and the possessor
by tolerance refuses to comply with such demand. A person
who occupies the land of another at the latter’s tolerance or
permission, without any contract between them, is necessarily
bound by an implied promise that he will vacate upon demand,
failing which a summary action for ejectment is the proper
remedy against him (Monasterio-Pe v. Tong, 646 SCRA 161,
172, March 23, 2011; Beltran v. Nieves, 634 SCRA 242, 249;
Sarmienta v. Manalite Homeowners Association, Inc., 632
SCRA 538, 549; See also Piedad v. Gurieza, G.R. No. 207525,
June 18, 2014; Pro-Guard Security Services Corporation v.
Tormil Realty and Development Corporation, G.R. No. 176341,
July 7, 2014).

374

CIVIL PROCEDURE

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 70 Forcible Entry and Unlawful Detainer

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

As a consequence, the possessor by tolerance is liable to
pay rentals, not from the time the premises were occupied
but from the time the demand to vacate was made up to the
time that the premises are fully vacated (Pro-Guard Security
Services Corporation v. Tormil Realty and Development
Corporation, G.R. No. 1 76341, July 7, 2014; See also Piedad v.
Gurieza, G.R. No. 207525, June 18, 2014).
2. It is settled that one whose stay is merely tolerated
becomes a deforciant illegally occupying the land the moment
he is required to leave. It is essential in unlawful detainer
cases, of this kind, that plaintiff s supposed acts of tolerance
must be present right from the start of the possession, which
is later sought to be recovered.

As explained in Sarona v. Villegas, 22 SCRA 1257, cited
in Munoz v. Court of Appeals, 214 SCRA 216, 224, tolerance
must be present right from the start of possession sought to
be recovered to categorize a cause of action as one for unlawful
detainer (See also Valdez v. Court of Appeals, 489 SCRA 369,
377). To justify an action for unlawful detainer, the permission
or the tolerance must exist at the start of possession by the
defendant. Otherwise, if the possession was unlawful from the
start, an action for unlawful detainer would be an improper
remedy (Ten Forty Realty and Development Corporation v.
Cruz, 410 SCRA 484, 490; Refugia v. Court of Appeals, 258
SCRA 347, 370; Saddi v. Renomeron, G.R. No. 211004, August
23, 2017).

When the rule on tolerance does not apply
1. The rule as to tolerance does not hold true in a case
where there was forcible entry at the start (Munoz v. Court
of Appeals, 214 SCRA 216, 224). The Court has consistently
adopted the position that tolerance or permission must have
been present at the beginning of the possession. Hence, if the
possession was unlawful from the start, an action for unlawful
detainer would not be the proper remedy (Jose v. Alfuerto,
G.R. No. 169380, November 26, 2012).
2. Where the complaint clearly alleges that the
defendants’ occupancy of the premises was unlawful from

376

the start and was bereft of contractual or legal basis, the
plaintiffs allegations run counter to the requirements
for unlawful detainer (Jose v. Alfuerto, G.R. No. 169380,
November 26, 2012). Common reason then suggests that if the
possession of the defendant was illegal at the inception and
not merely tolerated, the defendant’s entry into the land was
effected clandestinely, or one made without the knowledge of
the owners. It is, therefore, a possession by stealth which is
forcible entry.
Real and in personam nature of the actions; venue (Bar 1991)

Forcible entry and unlawful detainer actions are
those affecting possession of real property; hence, real actions.
The venue of these actions, therefore, is the place where the
property subject of the action is situated (Sec. 1, Rule 4, Rules
of Court).
1.

2. Forcible entry and unlawful detainer actions are not
only real actions. They are also actions in personam because
the plaintiff seeks to enforce a personal obligation of the
defendant to vacate the property subject of the action and
restore physical possession thereof to the plaintiff (Domagas
v. Jensen, 448 SCRA 663, 676).

Who may institute the action for forcible entry or unlawful

detainer

Unlawful detainer is a summary action for the recovery
of possession of real property. This action may be filed by any
person (natural or juridical), lessor, vendor, vendee or any
person against whom the possession of any land or building is
unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination of the
right to hold possession by virtue of any contract, express or
implied (Sec. 1, Rule 70, Rules of Court).
Effect of the pendency of an action involving ownership on
the action for forcible entry and unlawful detainer
1. A pending action involving ownership of the
subject property does not bar the filing of an ejectment suit,

376

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

nor suspend the proceedings of one already instituted. The
underlying reason is to prevent the defendant from trifling
with the summary nature of an ejectment suit by the simple
expedient of asserting ownership over the disputed property
(Tecson v. Gutierrez, 452 SCRA 781, 787).
2. As stated in another case: “x x x the pendency of
an action questioning the ownership of the property does
not bar the filing or consideration of an ejectment suit nor
the execution of the judgment therein” (Silverio v. Court of
Appeals, 407 SCRA 240, 246).
Examples of cases which do not bar an action for forcible
entry or unlawful detainer

There are cases filed with the Regional Trial Court which
do not abate or prevent the filing of an action for forcible
entry and unlawful detainer. Jurisprudence outlines certain
precedents, thus:
XXX

“1. Injunction suits instituted in the RTC by
defendants in ejectment actions in the municipal trial
courts or other courts of the first level (Nacorda v. Yatco,
17 SCRA 920 [1966]) do not abate the latter; and neither
do proceedings on consignation of rentals (Lim Si v. Lim,
98 Phil. 868 [1956], citing Pue, et al. v. Gonzales, 87 Phil.
81 [1950]).
2. An “accion publiciana” does not suspend an
ejectment suit against the plaintiff in the former (Ramirez
v. Bleza, 106 SCRA 187 [1981]).

3. A “writ of possession case” where ownership is
concededly the principal issue before the Regional Trial
Court does not preclude nor bar the execution of the
judgment in an unlawful detainer suit where the only
issue involved is the material possession or possession de
facto of the premises (Heirs of F. Guballa, Sr. u. C.A., et
al., 168 SCRA 518(1988]).
4. An action for quieting of title to property is not
a bar to an ejectment suit involving the same property
(Quimpo v. De la Victoria, 46 SCRA 139 [1972]).

— —

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Forcible Entry and Unlawful Detainer

Rule 70

5. Suits for specific performance with damages do
not affect ejectment actions (e.g., to compel renewal of a
lease contract) (Desamito v. Cuyegkeng, 18 SCRA 1184
[1966]; Pardo de Tavera u. Encarnacion, 22 SCRA 632
[1968]; Rosales v. CFI, 154 SCRA 153(1987]; Commander
Realty, Inc. v. C.A., 161 SCRA 264 [1988]). (Bar 2000)
6. An action for reformation of instrument (e.g.,
from deed of absolute sale to one of sale with pacto de
retro) does not suspend an ejectment suit between the
same parties (Judith v. Abragan, 66 SCRA 600 [1975]).

7. An action for reconveyance of property or“accion
reivindicatoria” also has no effect on ejectment suits
regarding the same property (Del Rosario u. Jimenez, 8
SCRA 549 [1963]; Salinas v. Navarro, 126 SCRA 167; De
la Cruz v. C.A., 133 SCRA 520 [1984]; Drilon v. Gaurana,
149 SCRA 352 [1987]; Ching v. Malaya, 153 SCRA
412 [1987]; Philippine Feeds Milling Co., Inc. v. C.A.,
174 SCRA 108; Dante v. Sison, 174 SCRA 517 [1989];
Guzman v. CA. [annulment of sale and reconveyance],
177 SCRA 604 [1989]; Demamay v. C.A., 186 SCRA 608
[1990]; Leopoldo Sy v. C.A., et al. [annulment of sale and
reconveyance], G.R. No. 95818, August 2, 1991).
8.
Neither do suits for annulment of sale, or title,
or document affecting property operate to abate ejectment
actions respecting the same property (Salinas v. Navarro
[annulment of deed of sale with assumption of mortgage
and/or to declare the same an equitable mortgage], 126
SCRA 1 67 [1983]; Ang Ping u. RTC [annulment of sale and
title], 154 SCRA 153 [1987]; Caparros v. C.A. [annulment
of title], 1 70 SCRA 758 [1989]; Dante v. Sison [annulment
of sale with damages], 1 74 SCRA 517; Galgala v. Benguet
Consolidated, Inc. [annulment of document], 177 SCRA
288(1989]).

The underlying reasons for the above rulings were
that the actions in the Regional Trial Court did not involve
physical or de facto possession and, on not a few occasions,
that the case in the Regional Trial Court was merely a
ploy to delay disposition of the ejectment proceeding, or
that the issues presented in the former could quite as

377

378

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

easily be set up as defenses in the ejectment action and
there resolved” (Wilmon Auto Supply Corp. v. Hon.. Court
of Appeals, 208 SCRA 108, 115-116).

When judicial action is not necessary
1. In a case, the petitioner (Republic of the Philippines)
argued that a judicial action is not necessary to evict
respondents from the leased military quarters because their
contracts of lease have long expired. Petitioner adds that
the contracts of lease specifically authorized petitioner to
extrajudicially take over the possession of the leased military
quarters after the expiration of their contracts.

The Court of Appeals, in affirming the writ of preliminary
injunction issued by the trial court to prevent the ejectment
of the respondents, ruled that the trial court acted within its
jurisdiction in issuing the writ. While the Court of Appeals
agreed that contractual stipulations empowering the lessor
to repossess the leased property extrajudicially from a lessee
whose lease contract has expired have been held to be valid,
procedural due process dictates that petitioner should resort to
judicial processes to question one’s right to occupy the leased
quarters. According to the Court of Appeals, an ejectment suit
is necessary to resolve the issue.

In the Supreme Court, the petitioner raised the issue
whether,
on
under the facts of the case, there was an
indispensable need for it to file an ejectment suit before it may
evict respondents from the subject military housing quarters.
The Court agreed with the petitioners. It ruled that
contractual stipulations empowering the lessor to repossess
the leased property extrajudicially from a lessee whose
lease contract has expired have been held to be valid. Under
the contract, respondents authorized the petitioner to
extrajudicially take over the possession of the leased military
housing quarters after their retirement. Being the law
between the parties, the stipulations must be respected. Since
the respondents agreed to abide by the regulations of the
military facility, judicial action is no longer necessary to evict

——

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Forcible Entry and Unlawful Detainer

Rule 70

379

respondents from the military quarters (Republic u. Peralta,
653 SCRA 629, 636-637, July 6, 2011).
2. Where a donation has an automatic revocation
clause, the occurrence of the condition agreed to by
the
parties as to cause the revocation, is sufficient for a party to
consider the donation revoked without need of any judicial
action. A judicial finding that the revocation is proper is only
necessary when the other party actually goes to court for
the
specific purpose of challenging the propriety of the revocation
(Province of Camarines Sur u. Bodega Glassware, G.R. No
194199, March 22, 2017).
3. In the same case of Republic v. Peralta, supra
at p. 638, the Court likewise declared that “x x x there is
considerable authority in American law upholding the validity
of stipulations authorizing the use of ‘all necessary force’ or
‘reasonable force’ in making re-entry upon the expiration of
the lease.”

Demand in unlawful detainer cases (Bar 1990)
1. Unless there exists a stipulation to the contrary, an
unlawful detainer case shall be commenced only after demand
to pay or comply with the conditions of the lease and to vacate
is made upon the lessee (Sec. 2, Rule 70, Rules of Court).
2. It is the demand to vacate the premises and the
refusal to do so which make unlawful the withholding of
the possession. Such refusal violates the plaintiffs right of
possession and gives rise to an action for unlawful detainer.
Thus, the requirement for a demand implies that the
mere failure of the occupant to pay rentals or to comply with
the conditions of the lease does not ipso facto render his
possession of the premises unlawful. It is the failure to comply
with the demand to vacate that vests upon the lessor a cause
of action (For related reading, see Larano v. Sps. Calendacion,
525 SCRA 57, 67).
3. To understand the manner of the demand required
by the Rules for an unlawful detainer case, attention need be
given to the phraseology of Sec. 2 of Rule 70.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

380

(THE BAK LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Where the suit is based on the defendant’s failure to pay
the rentals agreed upon, the proper demand should be “to pay
and to vacate.” It should not be “to pay or to vacate.” The latter
demand, which is in the alternative, does not make out a case
for unlawful detainer since it is not in accordance with the
required tenor of the demand prescribed in Sec. 2 of Rule 70.
Thus, a demand “to pay P5 million by way of unpaid rentals
or to vacate if not paid within five days” does not make out an
action for unlawful detainer, but merely one for collection of
a sum of money which must be filed with the Regional Trial
Court (Sec. 2, Rule 70, Rules of Court; For further readings,
see Cetus Development, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 176 SCRA 72,
80-81).

Where the suit is predicated upon the defendant’s noncompliance with the conditions of the lease contract, the
proper demand should be “to comply. . . and to vacate,” and
not “to comply. . . or to vacate.” The latter type of demand
gives rise to an action for specific performance, not unlawful
detainer (Sec. 2, Rule 70, Rules of Court; Cetus Development,
Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 176 SCRA 72, 80-81).

In Barrazona v. RTC of Baguio, Branch 61, 486 SCRA
555, an action for a sum of money was filed with the Regional
Trial Court, where the defendant moved for the dismissal
of the case, on the ground, among others, that the RTC has
no jurisdiction over the complaint because the allegations
therein clearly indicate that the action is one for ejectment
(unlawful detainer), which is under the exclusive and original
jurisdiction of the MTC. A perusal of the allegations indeed
showed that plaintiff made several demands upon petitioner
to pay her overdue rentals and to vacate the premises. The
Court ruled that these allegations make out a case for unlawful
detainer, and not for an action for a sum of money even if the
alleged arrears is over P900,000.00.
5. A demand in the alternative to pay the increased
rental or otherwise vacate the land is not the demand that
gives rise to a cause of action for unlawful detainer. If the lessee
decides to stay in the premises, he thereby merely agrees to
pay and assume the new rental, and cannot be ejected until he

defaults in said obligation and the necessary demand is first
made (Penas v. Court of Appeals, 233 SCRA 744, 747; Vda. de
Murga v. Chan, 25 SCRA 441, 448).
Form of demand
1. The demand may be in the form of a written notice
served upon the person found in the premises. The demand
may also be made by posting such written notice on the
premises if no person can be found thereon (Sec. 2, Rule 70,
Rules of Court).

2. It has been ruled, however, that the demand upon a
tenant may be verbal and is deemed a sufficient compliance
with the jurisdictional requirements (Jakihaca v. Aquino,
181 SCRA 67, 70). Since the demand is not written, sufficient
evidence must be adduced to show that there was indeed a
demand like testimonies from disinterested and unbiased
witnesses.

When right to commence the action arises

The right to commence the action shall commence if the
lessee fails to comply with the requisite demand after 15 days
in the case of land or 5 days in the case of buildings (Sec. 2,
Rule 70, Rules of Court).
When demand is not necessary in unlawful detainer cases
1. Demand is not required when: (a) there is a
stipulation dispensing with a demand (Art. 1169, Civil Code
of the Philippines), or (b) the ground for the suit is based on
the expiration of the lease.

Upon the expiration of the lease, the lessee is already
considered to be unlawfully withholding the property; hence,
the cause of action for unlawful detainer immediately arises.
In such a case, demand to vacate is no longer necessary
(Panganiban v. Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation, 395
SCRA 624, 636) and the lessor can now file an action for
ejectment. (Bar 1997)

382

CIVIL PROCEDURE

As a rule, demand is required only when the action is
predicated on the lessee’s failure to pay rent or comply with the
conditions of the lease, and not when the action is to terminate
the lease because of the expiration of the term (Labastida v.
Court of Appeals, 287 SCRA 662, 671; Co Tiamco v. Diaz, 75
Phil. 672, 677).
2. Demand to vacate is, however, required when the
lease is on a month-to-month basis to terminate the lease upon
the expiration of the month. In the absence of such notice,
the lease of private respondent continues to be in force and
cannot be deemed to have expired as of the end of the month
automatically (Yap v. Cruz, 208 SCRA 692, 695).

lessee’s right of continued enjoyment of the property leased.
Accordingly, “x x x no such presumption may be indulged
in with respect to special agreements which by nature are
foreign to the right of occupancy or enjoyment inherent in a
contract of lease” (Dizon v. Magsaysay, 57 SCRA 250, 254). By
sheer logic, an option to buy the property in the original lease
contract is not germane to possession of the premises and is
not deemed revived.
4. When there is tacita reconduccion, the lessee cannot
be deemed as unlawfully withholding the property. There is
no unlawful detainer to speak of (Bowe u. Court of Appeals,
220 SCRA 158, 166).

Answer to the complaint; waiver of defenses

Under Art. 1670 of the Civil Code of the Philippines,
if, at the end of the contract of lease, the lessee should continue
enjoying the property leased for 15 days with the consent of
the lessor, and no notice to the contrary has been given, it
is understood that there is an implied new lease, not for the
period of the original contract, but for the time established in
Arts. 1682 and 1687 of the Civil Code.
For instance, if the period for the lease has not been fixed,
it is understood to be from year to year, if the rent agreed is
annual. It is understood to be from month to month, if the
agreed rent is monthly; from week to week, if paid weekly;
and from day to day, if paid daily (Art. 1687, Civil Code of the
Philippines).

3. Cross-claims and compulsory counterclaims not
asserted in the answer shall be considered barred. The
answer to counterclaims or cross-claims shall be served and
filed within 10 days from service of the answer in which they
are pleaded (Sec. 6, Rule 70, Rules of Court).

2. The Court explained that an implied new lease or
tacita reconduccion will set in if it is shown that: (a) the term

1.

of the original contract of lease has expired; (b) the lessor
has not given the lessee a notice to vacate; and (c) the lessee
continued enjoying the thing leased for fifteen days with the
acquiescence of the lessor. This acquiescence may be inferred
from the failure to serve a notice to quit (Bowe v. Court of
Appeals, 220 SCRA 158, 166).
3. The terms of the contract which are revived in the
implied new lease are those terms which are germane to the

1. The rule requires the defendant to file his answer to
the complaint and serve a copy thereof on the plaintiff within
10 days from service of summons (Sec. 6, Rule 70, Rules of
Court).

2.

Affirmative and negative defenses not pleaded in
the answer shall be deemed waived, except lack of jurisdiction
over the subject matter (Sec. 6, Rule 70, Rules of Court).

Recall that, under Sec. 3 of Rule 9 of the Rules of
Court, as amended, if the defending party fails to answer
within the time allowed for the filing of such pleading, “the
court shall, upon motion of the claiming party x x x, declare
the defending party in default.”
2. Under Sec. 7 of Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, if the
defendant fails to answer the complaint within the period
provided, the court has no authority to declare the defendant

in default. Instead, the court, motu proprio or on motion of the
plaintiff, shall render judgment as may be warranted by the
facts alleged in the complaint and limited to what is prayed
for therein.
Defense of tenancy (Bar 2008)
1. Jurisdiction over the subject matter is determined
by the allegations in the complaint (Marino, Jr. v. Gamilia,
450 SCRA 198, 208). Hence, the defenses in the answer do not
determine jurisdiction.

2. If the defendant raises the issue of tenancy as a
defense and alleges lack of jurisdiction because a tenancy case
falls within the jurisdiction of the Department of Agrarian
Reforms Adjudicatory Board (DARAB), it would be error for
the court to dismiss the complaint on that ground alone. The
mere raising of the issue of tenancy does not automatically
divest the court of jurisdiction because, as earlier pointed out,
the jurisdiction of the court is determined by the allegations
in the complaint and is not dependent upon the defenses set
up by the defendant.

3. As it has always been held, in an ejectment case,
the jurisdiction of the court is determined by the allegations
in the complaint. The test for determining the sufficiency of
the allegations is whether, admitting the facts alleged, the
court could render a valid judgment in accordance with the
prayer of the plaintiff (Heirs of Demetrio Melchor v. Melchor,
415 SCRA 726, 732).
4. The mere assertion of tenancy as a defense does not
ipso facto deprive the court of jurisdiction over an ejectment
case. The case of Onquit u Binamira-Parcia, 297 SCRA 354,
362, states in the clearest of terms:

“x x x Well-settled is the principle that the courts
shall not be divested of jurisdiction over a case merely
by what is raised in the answer. What determines the
nature of an action and a court’s jurisdiction over it are
the allegations set up by the plaintiff. Basic is the rule
that the material averments in the complaint, which in

——

PART II

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Forcible Entry and Unlawful Detainer

386

this case is for ejectment, determine the jurisdiction of
the court. And, jurisprudence dictates that the court does
not lose its jurisdiction over an ejectment case by the
simple expedient of a party raising as a defense therein
the alleged existence of a tenancy relationship between
the parties. It is the duty of the court to receive evidence
to determine the veracity of allegations of tenancy" (Italics
supplied).

5. Where tenancy is raised as a defense, the court must
conduct a hearing on the matter to determine the veracity of
the allegations of tenancy (For further readings, see Onquit v.
Binamira-Parcia, 297 SCRA 354, 362).

6. While it is true that the jurisdiction of the court
in a suit for ejectment or forcible entry is determined by the
allegations in the complaint, yet where tenancy is averred as
a defense and, upon hearing, it is shown to be the real issue,
the court should dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction
(Ignacio u. CF1 of Bulacan, 42 SCRA 89, 95; Bernarte v. Court
of Appeals, 263 SCRA 323, 339-340).
Resolving the defense of ownership
1. The assertion of ownership by the defendant over the
disputed property does not serve to divest the inferior court of
its jurisdiction (Rural Bank of Sta. Ignacia, Inc. v. Dimatulac,
401 SCRA 742, 750). The defendant cannot deprive the court
of jurisdiction by merely claiming ownership of the property
involved (Perez v. Cruz, 404 SCRA 487, 493; Duran v. Court of
Appeals, 488 SCRA 438, 448).

2.

The rule is well-settled that what determines the

nature of the action, as well as the court which has jurisdiction
over the case, are the allegations in the complaint (Sarmienta
v. Manalite Homeowners Association, Inc., 632 SCRA 539).
The summary nature of the action is not changed by a
claim of ownership of the property by the defendant. Hence,
the MTC is not divested of its jurisdiction over an unlawful
detainer action simply because the defendant asserts
ownership over the property (For further readings, see also

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Spouses de la Cruz v. Spouses Capco, G.R. No. 176055, March
17, 2014).
3.

An ejectment case can be either for forcible entry
or unlawful detainer. It is a summary proceeding designed
to provide expeditious means to protect the actual possession
or the right to possession of the property involved. The sole
question for resolution in the case is the physical or material
possession (possession de facto) of the property in question,
and neither a claim of juridical possession (possession de
jure) nor an averment of ownership by the defendant can
outrightly deprive the trial court from taking due cognizance
of the case. Hence, even if the question of ownership is raised
in the pleadings, the court may pass upon the issue but only
to determine the question of possession especially if the
question of ownership is inseparably linked with the question
of possession. The adjudication of ownership in that instance
is merely provisional, and will not bar or prejudice an action
between the same parties involving the title to the property
(Quijano v. Amante, G.R. No. 164277, October 8, 2014).

4. Section 33[2] of B.P. 129, as amended by R.A. 7691,
provides in part:
“x x x when x x x the defendant raises the question
of ownership in his pleadings and the question of
possession cannot be resolved without deciding the issue
of ownership, the issue of ownership shall be resolved
only to determine the issue of possession."

Section 33[2] obviously does not deprive the MTC of the
authority to deal with the issue of ownership in an ejectment
case. On the contrary, when the defendant raises the issue of
ownership, the court may resolve the issue of ownership but
only under the following conditions:
(a) when the issue of possession cannot be resolved
without deciding the issue of ownership; and

(b) the issue of ownership shall be resolved only to
determine the issue of possession (Sec. 16, Rule 70, Rules
of Court; Duran v. Court of Appeals, 488 SCRA 438, 448).

— —

PART II SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 70 Forcible Entry and Unlawful Detainer

387

Such judgment would not bar an action between the same
parties respecting title to the land or building.

Section 16 of Rule 70 reiterates the above rule, thus:
“When the defendant raises the defense of ownership
in his pleadings and the question of possession cannot
be resolved without deciding the issue of ownership, the
issue of ownership shall be resolved only to determine the
issue of possession.”

5. As emphasized in another case, the adjudication is
merely provisional and would not bar or prejudice an action
between the same parties involving title to the property
(Esmaquel v. Coprada, 638 SCRA 428, 436).
6. When the property is registered under the Torrens
system, the registered owner’s title to the property is presumed
legal and cannot be collaterally attacked, especially in a mere
action for unlawful detainer, and it does not even matter if
the party’s title to the property is questionable. In a particular
case, the petitioners contended that the respondents obtained
their certificates of title through forgery. Obviously, this
argument is equivalent to a collateral attack against the
Torrens title of the respondents an attack that the Court
cannot allow in the instant unlawful detainer case (Spouses
Gaela v. Spouses Tan, G.R. No. 185627, March 15, 2017).

—

Judgment conclusive only on possession

The judgment rendered in an action for forcible entry or
detainer shall be conclusive with respect to the possession only
and shall not bind the title or affect the ownership of the land
or building. Such judgment shall not bar an action between
the same parties respecting title to the land or building (Sec.
18, Rule 70, Rules of Court). This rule is consistent with Sec.
33[2] of B.P. 129, as amended, and Sec. 16 of Rule 70.

Conciliation requirement
In case conciliation is required and there is no showing of
compliance with such requirement, the case shall be dismissed.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

388

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

The dismissal, however, is one without prejudice. Hence, the
case may be revived but only if the conciliation requirement is
complied with (Sec. 12, Rule 70, Rules of Court).
Pleadings allowed in forcible entry and unlawful detainer;
verification (Bar 2018)

The only pleadings allowed to be filed are the: (a)
complaint, (b) compulsory counterclaim, (c) cross-claim
pleaded in the answer, and (d) answers thereto. All pleadings
shall be verified (Sec. 4, Rule 70, Rules of Court).

Prohibited pleadings, petitions and motions
1. Under Sec. 13 of Rule 70 of the Rules of Court,
not all pleadings may be filed in cases covered by summary
procedure. For example, a reply, third-party complaint and

pleadings-in-intervention are not allowed.
2. Under the same section, motions for a bill of
particulars, new trial, reconsideration of a judgment; reopening
of trial; extension of time to file pleadings, affidavits or any
other paper; and a motion to declare the defendant in default;
or a dilatory motion for postponement are all disallowed.
A motion to dismiss the complaint is also disallowed
except on the ground of (a) lack of jurisdiction over the subject
matter, or (b) failure to comply with Sec. 12 of Rule 70.

3. Section 13 of Rule 70 likewise prohibits the filing of
a petition for relief from judgment, a petition for certiorari,
mandamus, or prohibition against any interlocutory order
issued by the court. The same rule also prohibits the filing of

memoranda.
The prohibition is consistent with the summary
nature of the actions for forcible entry and unlawful detainer.
A contrary rule would place the actions under the category of
non-summary civil actions.

389

Preliminary injunction; how to obtain possession of
the
premises during the pendency of the action in the MTC

A possessor deprived of his possession through forcible
entry or unlawful detainer may, within five days
from the
filing of the complaint, file a motion in the same
action for
the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction to
restore him in his possession. This motion shall be
resolved
within 30 days from its filing (Sec. 15, Rule 70, Rules of Court).
Preliminary Injunction to prevent further acts of disposses*
slon

The court may also grant preliminary injunction, in
accordance with Rule 58 of the Rules of Court, to prevent
the defendant from committing further acts of dispossession
against the plaintiff (Sec. 15, Rule 70, Rules of Court).

Preliminary Injunction when case is on appeal to the RTC

1. If the judgment of the MTC is appealed, the Regional
Trial Court may issue a writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction to restore the plaintiff in his possession, upon
his
motion, which shall be filed within 10 days from the perfection
of the appeal (Sec. 20, Rule 70, Rules of Court).
2. The grant of a writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction is predicated upon a finding that the (a) defendant’s
appeal is frivolous or dilatory, or (b) plaintiff’s appeal is prima
facie meritorious (Sec. 20, Rule 70, Rules of Court).

Preliminary conference; submission of affidavits and
position papers

1. A preliminary conference shall be held not later than
30 days after the last answer has been filed (Sec. 8, Rule 70,
Rules of Court). A pre-trial is not held since there is no trial in
forcible entry and unlawful detainer cases. Even if there is no
pre-trial, the provisions on pre-trial in Rule 18 of the Rules of
Court shall be applicable to the preliminary conference unless
inconsistent with Rule 70 (See Sec. 8, Rule 70, Rules of Court).

2. No postponement of the preliminary conference
shall be granted, except for highly meritorious grounds. The
determination of what ground is highly meritorious or not and
the applicable sanctions that may be imposed, are matters left
to the sound discretion of the court (See Sec. 8, Rule 70, Rules
of Court).
Appearance of the plaintiff in the preliminary
conference is mandatory. His failure to appear shall be cause
for the dismissal of the complaint. If the defendant appears in
the absence of the plaintiff, said defendant shall be entitled
to a judgment in his counterclaim as may be warranted by
the facts alleged and limited to what is prayed for therein.
All cross-claims, however, shall be dismissed (See Sec. 8 in
relation to Sec. 7 of Rule 70, Rules of Court).

3.

If the plaintiff appears and the defendant does not
appear, the plaintiff shall, likewise, be entitled to a judgment
as may be warranted by the facts and limited to what is prayed
for therein (See Sec. 8 in relation to Sec. 7 of Rule 70, Rules
of Court). This rule shall apply only when there is only one
defendant. If there are two or more defendants sued under a
common cause of action who had pleaded a common defense
one or more shall appear in the preliminary conference, the
plaintiff shall not be entitled to a judgment. Instead, the
proceedings shall go on as if every party appeared in the
conference (See Sec. 8, Rule 70, Rules of Court).
4. Within 5 days after the termination of the pre¬
liminary conference, the court shall issue an order stating
the matters taken up therein (See Sec. 9, Rule 70, Rules of
Court).
5. Within 10 days from receipt of the order mentioned
above, the parties shall submit the affidavits of their witnesses
and other evidence on the factual issues defined in the order,
together with their position papers setting forth the law
and the facts relied upon by them (Sec. 10, Rue 70, Rules of

Court).

Judgment

1. Within 30 days after receipt of the
position papers, or the expiration of the periodaffidavits and
for filing the
same, the court shall render judgment (Sec.
11, Rule 70,
Rules of Court). Without any order of extension by
the
failure to decide even a single case within the required Court,
period
constitutes gross inefficiency (Gamboa-Roces v.
Perez,
A.M.
No. MTJ-16-1887, January 9, 2017).
Judgment shall be rendered by the court
in favor of the
plaintiff if the court finds that the allegations
in the complaint
are true. The judgment shall be for the (a)
restitution of the
premises, and (b) payment of the sum justly
due as
rent or as reasonable compensation for the use and arrears of
occupation
of the premises, attorney’s fees and costs (Sec. 17,
Rule 70,
Rules of Court).

2. Judgment shall be rendered for the
defendant to
recover his costs if the court finds that the allegations in the
complaint are not true (Sec. 17, Rule 70, Rules of
Court).
3. If a counterclaim is established, the court
shall
render judgment for the sum found in arrears from
either
party and award costs as justice requires (Sec. 17,
Rule 70,
Rules of Court).

Immediate execution of judgment (MTC) (Bar 1997, 2017)
1. Under Sec. 19 of Rule 70, a judgment on a forcible
entry and detainer case is immediately executory to avoid
injustice to a lawful possessor, and the court’s duty to
order
the execution is practically ministerial (Bugarin v. Palisoc,
476 SCRA 587, 594).
2. The rule mandating the immediate execution of
judgment in an ejectment case applies when the judgment is
against the defendant. Under Sec. 19 of Rule 70, execution
shall issue immediately upon motion ‘If judgment is rendered
against the defendant x x x.” Conversely, the judgment is
not immediately executory if it is rendered in favor of the
defendant and against the plaintiff.

CIVIL PROCEDURE

Decision of the RTC on appeal Is immediately executory
1. Once the RTC decides on the appeal, such decision, if
against the defendant, is also immediately executory, without
prejudice to an appeal (Sec. 21, Rule 70, Rules of Court). The
said Sec. 21 of Rule 70 is clear:
"SEC. 21. The judgment of the Regional Trial Court
against the defendant shall be immediately executory,
without prejudice to a further appeal that may be taken
therefrom.”

2. Note, however, the phraseology of Sec. 21 of the
1991 Rule on Summary Procedure which provides: “x x x The
decision of the Regional Trial Court in civil cases governed
by this Rule, including forcible entry and unlawful detainer,
shall be immediately executory, without prejudice to a further
appeal that may be taken therefrom.”
Section 21 of the 1991 Rule on Summary Procedure
suggests that decisions of the RTC in civil cases under
summary procedure appealed to it, including forcible entry
and unlawful detainer, are immediately executory whether
or not the judgment be against the plaintiff or the defendant
because the said rule makes no specific reference to the
defendant. It is submitted, however, that Rule 70 should be
controlling because the same is a specific rule.
How to stay immediate execution of the judgment (Bar 1990,
2009, 2017)

The defendant must take the following steps to stay
the execution of the judgment:
1.

(a) Perfect an appeal;
(b) File a supersedeas bond to pay for the rents,
damages and costs accruing down to the time of the

judgment appealed from; and
(c) Deposit periodically with the Regional Trial
Court, during the pendency of the appeal, the adjudged
amount of rent due under the contract or if there be no

contract, the reasonable value of the use and occupation
of the premises (Bugarin u. Palisoc, 476
SCRA 587, 595;
Sec. 19, Rule 70, Rules of Court).
2. All the above requisites must concur. Thus,
the defendant had appealed and filed a supersedeas even if
bond, but

failed to pay the accruing rentals, the appellate
court could,
upon motion of the plaintiff, with notice to
the defendant, and
upon proof of such failure, order the
immediate
of the appealed decision without prejudice to execution
the
taking its course. Such deposit, like the supersedeas appeal

bond, is
a mandatory requirement; hence, if it is not
complied with,
execution will issue as a matter of right (Antonio v.
Geronimo,
476 SCRA 340, 349).
3. By virtue of Sec. 19 of Rule 70, the defendant,
to stay the execution of the judgment, shall file a in order
supersedeas bond, approved by the Municipal Trial “sufficient
Court and
executed in favor of the plaintiff to pay the rents, damages
and costs accruing down to the time of the judgment appealed
from x x x.”

In other words, the supersedeas bond covers the
monetary judgment of the lower court. If the judgment
does
not make any pronouncement as to the pecuniary liability of
the defendant, the bond should not be required. Attorney’s
fees are not covered by a supersedeas bond (Once v. Gonzales,
76 SCRA 258, 261).
In Once, the Court was emphatic:
xxx
“We hold that the lower court committed a patent

error in ordering execution of the city court’s judgment

on the ground that Bienvenido Once did not file a
supersedeas bond. No such bond was necessary because no
back rentals were adjudged in the city court’s judgment.
The attorney’s fees of Pl,000 need not be covered by a
supersedeas bond.’’ (Bar 1990)

4. In a decision that made pronouncements as to the
monetary liability of the defendant in an ejectment suit,

I
i

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)
VOLUME II

the defendant filed a notice of appeal on time but did not
file a supersedeas bond. Nevertheless, the judge denied the
plaintiff’s motion for execution contending that the appeal was
perfected on time. The Court, ruling on the administrative
case against the judge, held that granting the plaintiff’s
motion for execution became a ministerial duty of the judge
upon the defendant’s failure to file a supersedeas bond, and
that the execution of the decision could not be stayed by the
mere taking of an appeal. The perfection of the appeal must be
coupled with the filing of the requisite bond (Ferrer i>. Rabaca,
632 SCRA 204, 214-215).

Where to appeal; writ of preliminary mandatory injunction
1. The judgment or final order of the court is appealable
to the appropriate Regional Trial Court (Sec. 22, B.P. 129, as
amended).
2. The mode of appeal is the same as in ordinary civil
actions under Rule 40 of the Rules of Court where a notice
of appeal is filed with and the docket fee paid in the court of
origin, which is the Municipal Trial Court.
3. On appeal, recall that upon motion of the plaintiff,
within 10 days from the perfection of the appeal to the
Regional Trial Court, the latter may issue a writ of preliminary
mandatory injunction to restore the plaintiff in possession if
the court is satisfied that the defendant’s appeal is frivolous
or dilatory, or that the appeal of the plaintiff is prima facie
meritorious (Sec. 20, Rule 70, Rules of Court).
Persons bound by the judgment In ejectment cases
As a rule, the judgment in an ejectment case is binding
only upon the parties properly impleaded and given an
opportunity to be heard. This is because an ejectment suit is
an action in personam. However, the judgment may become
binding on anyone who has not been impleaded in certain

instances.

detainer case, may be ejected from the land subject of the case.
The Court ruled in the affirmative. Although an ejectment
is an action in personam wherein the judgment is binding suit
only
upon the parties properly impleaded and given an
opportunity
to be heard, the judgment becomes binding on anyone who
has
not been impleaded if he or she is a: (a) trespasser, squatter
or
agent of the defendant fraudulently occupying the
property to
frustrate the judgment; (b) guest or occupant of the premises
with the permission of the defendant; (c) a transferee pendente
lite; (d) sublessee; (e) co-lessee; or (f) member of the family,
relative or privy of the defendant (Sunflower Neighborhood

his judgment.” As to the sheriff, it is merely his ministerial
duty to implement the writ (Bank of the Philippine Island v.
Calanza, 633 SCRA 186, 195).

Rule 71
CONTEMPT
Meaning of contempt of court
1. Contempt of court has been defined as a willful
disregard or disobedience of a public authority. In its broad
sense, contempt is a disregard of, or disobedience to, the rules
or orders of a legislative or judicial body or an interruption of
its proceedings by disorderly behavior or insolent language in
its presence or so near thereto as to disturb its proceedings
or to impair the respect due to such a body. In its restricted
and more usual sense, contempt comprehends a despising of
the authority, justice, or dignity of a court (Ligon v. Regional
Trial of Makati City, Branch 56, G.R. No. 190028, February
26, 2014; Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation v. Serra,
G.R. No. 216124, July 19, 2017).

To be considered contemptuous, it was held that “an
act must be clearly contrary to or prohibited by the order of
the court or tribunal” and that the act “which is forbidden
or required to be done is clearly and exactly defined, so that
there can be no reasonable doubt or uncertainty as to what
specific act or thing is forbidden or required.”
Thus, a Labor Arbiter who erroneously issues a partial
writ of execution based on an equally erroneous interpretation
of law and jurisprudence, and a sheriff acting in accordance
with the writ, cannot be guilty of contempt. On the part of the
Labor Arbiter, he can only be deemed to have committed a
grave abuse of discretion correctible by a petition for certiorari
but not for indirect contempt. According to the Court, “No
one who is called upon to try the facts or interpret the law
in the process of administering justice can be infallible in
2.

396

A sheriff whose acts were performed pursuant to the
directives of the Court was merely performing a ministerial
duty cannot be cited for contempt for improper conduct, a
ground for indirect contempt (NPC Drivers & Mechanics
Association v. NPC, G.R. No. 156208, June 30, 2014).
It has been, however, declared that “x x x any publication,
pending a suit, reflecting upon the court, the jury, the parties,
the officers of the court, the counsel with reference to the
suit, or tending to influence the decision of the controversy,
is contempt of court and is punishable” (A.M. No. 10-10-4SC, Re: Letter of the UP Law Faculty Entitled: Restoring the
Integrity: a Statement by the Faculty of the University of the
Philippines College of Law on the Allegations of Plagiarism
and Misrepresentation in the Supreme Court, March 8, 2011).

Contempt power is inherent in courts
1. The power to punish for contempt is inherent in all
courts, and need not be specifically granted by statute. It lies
at the core of the administration of a judicial system. Indeed,
there ought to be no question that courts have the power,
by virtue of their very creation, to impose silence, respect,
and decorum in their presence, submission to their lawful
mandates, and preserve themselves and their officers from
the approach and insults of pollution. The power to punish
for contempt essentially exists for the preservation of order
in judicial proceedings and for the enforcement of judgments,
orders, and mandates of the courts, and, consequently, for the
due administration of justice. The reason behind the power to
punish for contempt is that respect for the courts guarantees
the stability of their institution; without such guarantee, the
institution of the courts would be resting on a very shaky
foundation (Lorenzo Shipping Corporation v. Distribution
Association Management of the Philippines, 656 SCRA 331,
343-344; See also Oca v. Custodio, G.R. No. 199825, July 26,

2017).

398

PART II

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

2. Such power should be exercised on the preservative,
not on the vindictive, principle. Only occasionally should the
court invoke its inherent power in order to retain that respect,
without which, the administration of justice will falter or
fail. Only in cases of clear and contumacious refusal to obey
should the power be exercised. Such power, being drastic and
extraordinary in its nature, should not be resorted to unless
necessary in the interest of justice (Bank of the Philippine
Islands v. Calanza, 633 SCRA 186, 192-193, October 13, 2010;
See also Garcia v. Manrique, G.R. No. 186592, October 10,
2012).

Purposes and nature of contempt proceedings

Contempt proceedings have a dual function: (a)
vindication of public interest by punishment of contemptuous
conduct; and (b) coercion to compel the contemnor to do what
the law requires him to uphold the power of the Court, and
also to secure the rights of the parties to a suit awarded by the
Court (Regalado v. Go, 514 SCRA 616, 627).
1.

2. The power to punish for contempt essentially exists
for the preservation of order in judicial proceedings and for
the enforcement of judgments, orders, and mandates of
the courts, and consequently, for the due administration of
justice. The reason behind the power to punish for contempt
is that respect for the courts guarantees the stability of their
institution; without such guarantee, the institution of the
courts would be resting on a very shaky foundation (Lorenzo
Shipping Corporation v. Distribution Management Association
of the Philippines, 656 SCRA 331, 343-343).

Direct and indirect contempt

Contempt of court is of two kinds, namely: direct
and indirect contempt (Ligon v. Regional Trial of Makati City,
Branch 56, G.R. No. 190028, February 26, 2014).
2. Direct contempt, or contempt in facie curiae, is
misbehavior committed in the presence of or so near a court
or judge so as to obstruct or interrupt the proceedings before
1.

the same, including disrespect toward the court, and can be
punished summarily without hearing. It is conduct directed
against or assailing the authority and dignity of the court or a
judge, or in the doing of a forbidden act (Encinas v. National
Bookstore, Inc., G.R. No. 162704, July 28, 2005; See also Oca
v. Custodio, G.R. No. 199825, July 26, 2017).
3. Indirect contempt is not committed in the presence of
or so near a court but constitutes contempt as when an officer
of the court misbehaves in the performance of his official
functions; when a person disobeys or resists a lawful writ,
process, order or judgment of a court; when a person assumes
to be an attorney or an officer of a court and acting as such
without authority; or performs any conduct tending, directly or
indirectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration
of justice (Oca v. Custodio, G.R. No. 199825, July 26, 2017).
Indirect contempt is to be punished after charge and hearing
(Sec. 3, Rule 71, Rules of Court).
Specific acts punishable as direct contempt; examples (Bar
2012)
1.

Any of the following acts constitutes direct contempt:

(a) Misbehavior in the presence of or so near the
court as to obstruct or interrupt the proceedings before

the same;
(b) Disrespect toward the court;
(c)

Offensive personalities toward others;

(d) Refusal to be sworn as a witness or to answer as
a witness; and

(e) Refusal to subscribe an affidavit or deposition
when lawfully required to do so (Sec. 1, Rule 71, Rules of
Court).

The acts of a party or a counsel which constitute
willful and deliberate forum shopping also amount to direct
contempt (Sec. 5, Rule 7, Rules of Court).
2.

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

3. Unfounded accusations, allegations or words tending
to embarrass the court or bring it into disrepute have no place
in a pleading. If a pleading containing derogatory, offensive
and malicious statements is submitted in the same court
or judge in which the proceedings are pending, it is direct
contempt, equivalent as it is to a misbehavior committed in
the presence of or so near a court or judge as to interrupt the
administration of justice (Re: Letter dated 21 February 2005 of
Atty. Noel S. Sorreda, 464 SCRA 32, 41). (Bar 2012)
It has been similarly held that contemptuous statements
made in pleadings filed with the court constitute direct
contempt. A pleading containing derogatory, offensive or
malicious statements submitted to the court or judge in which
the proceedings are pending has been ruled to be equivalent
to misbehavior committed in the presence of or so near a court
or judge as to interrupt the proceedings before the same within
the meaning of the Rules of Court and, therefore, constitutes
direct contempt (Cruz v. Gingoyon, 658 SCRA 254, 256).
4. Contempt of court presupposes a contumacious
attitude, a flouting of arrogant belligerence, and a defiance
of the court. There is no basis for a direct contempt where
there is no proof that the laughter, conversations and glances
of persons were directed to the judge and that they disrupted
or obstructed the proceedings (Laurel v. Francisco, 624 SCRA
1, 48-50, July 6, 2010).
5. Even assuming that the impressions and conclusions
of the person held in contempt are justified by the facts, the
same is still not a valid defense in cases of contempt. “Where
the matter is abusive or insulting, evidence that the language
used was justified by the facts is not admissible as a defense.
Respect for the judicial office should always be observed and
enforced” (Cruz v. Gingoyon, 658 SCRA 254, 268, September
28, 2011 citing Salcedo v. Hernandez, 61 Phil. 724, 729 [1935],

citing In re: Stewart, 118 La., 827; 43 S., 455).

No formal proceeding required; summary proceedings
1. No formal proceedings are required to cite a person
in direct contempt. The court may summarily adjudge one in

PART II

SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS

Rule 71

Contempt

401

direct contempt without a hearing (Sec. 1, Rule 71, Rules of
Court; Encinas v. National Bookstore, Inc., 464 SCRA 572
574).

2. The court may proceed, upon its own knowledge
of the facts without further proof and without issue or trial
in any form, to punish a contempt committed directly under
its eye or within its view. But there must be adequate facts
to support a summary order for contempt in the presence of
the court. The exercise of the summary power to imprison for
contempt is a delicate one and care is needed to avoid arbitrary
or oppressive conclusions (Lorenzo Shipping Corporation v.
Distribution Management Association of the Philippines, 656
SCRA 331, 346, August 31, 2011).

Penalties for direct contempt
1. The penalty for direct contempt depends upon the
court against which the act was committed.
(a) If the act constituting direct contempt was
committed against a Regional Trial Court or a court
of equivalent or higher rank, the penalty is a fine not
exceeding two thousand pesos or imprisonment not
exceeding ten (10) days, or both (Sec. 1, Rule 71, Rules of
Court).

(b) If the act constituting direct contempt was
committed against a lower court, the penalty is a fine
not exceeding two hundred pesos or imprisonment not
exceeding one (1) day, or both (Sec. 1, Rule 71, Rules of
Court).

2. If the contempt consists in the refusal or omission to
do an act which is yet within the power of the respondent to
perform, he may be imprisoned by order of the court concerned
until he performs it (Sec. 8, Rule 71, Rules of Court).

Remedy of a person adjudged in direct contempt
1. A person adjudged in direct contempt may not
appeal therefrom. His remedy is a petition for certiorari or

402

PART II — SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS
Rule 71 Contempt

CIVIL PROCEDURE

—

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

prohibition directed against the court which adjudged him in
direct contempt (Sec. 2, Rule 71, Rules of Court).
2. Pending the resolution of the petition for certiorari
or prohibition, the execution of the judgment for direct
contempt shall be suspended. The suspension, however, shall
take place only if the person adjudged in contempt files a bond
fixed by the court which rendered the judgment. This bond
is conditioned upon his performance of the judgment should
the petition be decided against him (Sec. 2, Rule 71, Rules of
Court; Canada v. Suerte, 474 SCRA 379, 386-387).

Nature of indirect contempt
1. Indirect contempt or constructive contempt is that
which is committed out of the presence of the court. Any
improper conduct tending, directly or indirectly, to impede,
obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice would
constitute indirect contempt (Ligon v. Regional Trial of
Makati City, Branch 56, G.R. No. 190028, February 26, 2014).
2. The proceedings for punishment of indirect
contempt are criminal in nature. This form of contempt is
conduct that is directed against the dignity and authority of
the court or a judge acting judicially; it is an act obstructing
the administration of justice which tends to bring the court
into disrepute or disrespect. Intent is a necessary element in
criminal contempt, and no one can be punished for a criminal
contempt unless the evidence makes it clear that he intended
to commit it (Marantan v. Diokno, G.R. No. 205956, February
12, 2014).

In contempt, the intent goes to the gravamen of the offense.
Thus, the good faith or lack of it, of the alleged contemnor is
considered. Where the act complained of is ambiguous or does
not clearly show on its face that it is contempt, and is one
which, if the party is acting in good faith, is within his rights,
the presence or absence of a contumacious intent is, in some
instances, held to be determinative of its character. A person
should not be condemned for contempt where he contends
for what he believes to be right and in good faith institutes

408

proceedings for the purpose, however erroneous may be his
conclusion as to his rights. To constitute contempt, the act
must be done wilfully and for an illegitimate or improper
purpose (St. Louis University v. Olairez, G.R. No. 162299,
March 26, 2014).
Specific acts punishable as indirect contempt; examples
1. A person guilty of the following acts may be punished
for indirect contempt:
(a) Misbehavior of an officer of a court in the per¬
formance of his official duties or in his official transac¬

tions;

(b) Disobedience of or resistance to a lawful writ,
process, order, or judgment of a court, including the act
of a person who, after being dispossessed or ejected from
any real property by the judgment or process of any court
of competent jurisdiction, enters or attempts or induces
another to enter into or upon such real property, for the
purpose of executing acts of ownership or possession,
or in any manner disturbs the possession given to the
person adjudged to be entitled thereto; (Bar 1995, 2012)
(c) Any abuse of or any unlawful interference with
the processes or proceedings of a court not constituting
direct contempt;

(d) Any improper conduct tending, directly or indi¬
rectly, to impede, obstruct, or degrade the administration
of justice;
(e) Assuming to be an attorney or an officer of a
court, and acting as such without authority;

(f) Failure to obey a subpoena duly served (Bar
2012); or
(g) The rescue, or attempted rescue, of a person or
property in the custody of an officer by virtue of an order
or process of a court held by him (Sec. 3, Rule 71, Rules of
Court; See also St. Louis University v. Olairez, G.R. No.

162299, March 26, 2014).

CIVIL PROCEDURE
(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

2. The sub judice rule restricts comments and
disclosures pertaining to the judicial proceedings in order
to avoid prejudging the issue, influencing the court, or
obstructing the administration of justice. A violation of this
rule may render one liable for indirect contempt under Sec.
3(d), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court (Marantan v. Diokno, G.R.
No. 205956, February 12, 2014).
3. The failure by counsel to inform the court of the
death of his client constitutes indirect contempt within the
purview of Sec. 3 of Rule 71 (Bar 1998) since it constitutes
an improper conduct tending to impede the administration of
justice. It is also a ground for disciplinary action under Sec. 16
of Rule 3 of the Rules of Court.
4. The act of re-entry by a party into the land from
which he was ordered by the court to vacate may be punished
for contempt of court even after the lapse of 5 years from the
date of the execution of the judgment (Benedicto v. Canada, 21
SCRA 1066 as cited in Patagan v. Panis, 159 SCRA 507, 513514). The same case held that the re-entry is clearly a defiance
of the authority of the court. As it is, the decision sought to
be enforced had long become final and executory. And unless
and until the said decision is annulled or set aside in a proper
proceeding, the same must be given effect (Patagan v. Panis,
159 SCRA 507, 513). (Bar 1995)

5. There can be no indirect contempt for performing
an act beyond the effectivity of a temporary restraining order
which has lapsed automatically even if performed during the
period of extension granted by the court for the same reason
for which the order was originally granted. The effectivity of a
temporary restraining order is not extendible without need of
any judicial declaration. No court has the authority to extend
or renew the same on the same ground for which it was issued
(See Sec. 5, Rule 58, Rules of Court). (Bar 1993)
6. In a petition for a writ of Kalikasan, the court may,
after hearing, punish the respondent who refuses or unduly
delays the filing of a return, or who makes a false return, for

PART II

—RuleSPECIAL

406

indirect contempt (Sec. 13, Rule 7, Part III, Rules of Procedure
or Environmental Cases).
1. In a petition for a writ of Kalikasan, the court may,
after hearing, punish any person who disobeys or resists a
lawful order of the court for indirect contempt (Sec. 13, Rule
7, Part HI, Rules of Procedure or Environmental Cases).
8. Failure to remit and/or withhold or any delay in the
remittance of support to the woman and/or her child without
justifiable cause shall render the respondent or his employer
liable for indirect contempt of court (Sec. 8[g], R.A. 9262).
Clear and present danger rule in contempt

1. As important as the maintenance of freedom
speech,
is the maintenance of the independence of the
of
Judiciary. The “clear and present danger” rule may serve as
an aid in determining the proper constitutional boundary
between these two rights. The “clear and present danger^’
rule means that the evil consequence of the comment must
be “extremely serious and the degree of imminence extremely
high” before an utterance can be punished. There must exist
a clear and present danger that the utterance will harm the
administration of justice. Freedom of speech should not be
impaired through the exercise of the power of contempt of
court unless there is no doubt that the utterances in question

make a serious and imminent threat to the administration of
justice. It must constitute an imminent, not merely a likely,
threat (Marantan u. Diokno, G.R. No. 205956, February 12,
2014).
2. It was ruled that for a comment to be considered
as contempt of court “it must really appear” that such does
impede, interfere with and embarrass the administration
of justice. What is, thus, sought to be protected is the allimportant duty of the court to administer justice in the
decision of a pending case. Where the comments made
by respondents is an expression of an opinion “that their
loved ones were murdered by the accused,” such are mere
reiterations of their position in the case. It was ruled that the

PART II — SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS

407

Court in this case detected no malice on the face of the said
statements. The mere restatement of their argument in their
petition did not even tend to influence the Court. A public
utterance or publication is not to be denied the constitutional
protection of freedom of speech and press merely because it
concerns a judicial proceeding still pending in the court. The
respondents’ comments pose a serious and imminent threat
to the administration of justice. No criminal intent to impede,
obstruct, or degrade the administration of justice can be
inferred from the comments of the respondents (Marantan u.
Diokno, G.R. No. 205956, February 12, 2014).

3. In contempt proceedings, the respondent must be
given the right to defend himself or herself and have a day in
court a basic requirement of due process. This is especially
so in indirect contempt proceedings, as the court cannot
decide them summarily pursuant to the Rules of Court. In
indirect contempt proceedings, the respondent must be given
the opportunity to comment on the charge against him or her,
and there must be a hearing, and the court must investigate
the charge and consider the respondent’s answer (Capitol
Hills Golf & Country Club, Inc. v. Sanchez, G.R. No. 182738,
February 24, 2014).

3. Courts will not freely infringe on the constitutional
right to freedom of expression. It may interfere, on occasion,
for the proper administration of justice. However, the power
of contempt should be balanced with the right to freedom of
expression, especially when it may have the effect of stifling
comment on public matters. Freedom of expression must
always be protected to the fullest extent possible (Roque, Jr.
v. Armed Forces of the Philippines, et al., G.R. No. 214986,
February 15, 2017).

4. There are two ways by which a person can be charged
with indirect contempt, namely: (a) through a verified petition;
and (b) by order or formal charge initiated by the court motu
proprio (Sec. 4, Rule 71, Rules of Court).

How a proceeding for indirect contempt is commenced (Bar
2012)
1. Unlike direct contempt which is summary, an act
constituting an indirect contempt is to be punished only after
a charge in writing and hearing (Sec. 3, Rule 71, Rules of
Court). The requirement of a written charge and hearing shall
not, however, be construed to prevent the court from issuing
process to bring the respondent into court, or from holding him
in custody pending the proceedings (Sec. 3, last paragraph,
Rule 71, Rules of Court).

Generally, the procedural requisites before the
accused may be punished for indirect contempt are: (a) charge
in writing; (b) opportunity for the person charged to appear
and explain his conduct; and (c) opportunity to be heard by
himself or counsel (Barredo-Fuentes v. Albarracin, 456 SCRA
120, 131).
2.

—

(a) If the charge is initiated motu proprio by the
court against which the contempt was committed, it is
commenced by an order of the same court or any formal
charge requiring the respondent to show cause why he
should not be punished for contempt (Sec. 4, Rule 71,
Rules of Court).
(b) If initiated by someone other than the court, the
charge is commenced by filing a verified petition. This
petition shall be accompanied by supporting particulars
and certified true copies of documents or papers involved

therein.

The petition shall likewise comply with the requirements
for the filing of initiatory pleadings for civil actions in the
court concerned (Sec. 4, Rule 71, Rules of Court). Since it is
considered an initiatory pleading and must comply with the
requirements for the filing of initiatory pleadings, the petition
must, hence, contain a certification against forum shopping
mandated under Sec. 5 of Rule 7, as amended. The verified
petition for contempt shall be docketed, heard and decided
separately unless the court in its discretion orders the contempt
charge, which arose out of or related to the principal action,
to be consolidated with the main action for joint hearing and

i

PART II

VOLUME II

decision (Comilang v. Belen, A.M. No. RTJ-10-2216, June 26,
2012; Sec. 4, Rule 71, Rules of Court).
The procedural requirements are mandatory considering
that contempt proceedings against a person are treated as
criminal in nature (Office of the Court Administrator u. Lerma,
632 SCRA 698, 717-718).
5. The provisions of the Rules are worded in very
clear and categorical language. Where the charge for indirect
contempt is not initiated by the courts, it is required that a
verified petition, which fulfills the requirements on initiatory
pleadings, be filed (Sec. 4, Rule 71, Rules of Court).

Prior to the 1997 amendment of the Rules, a mere motion
was tolerated by the courts in initiating indirect contempt
proceedings. After the amendments, however, such practice
can no longer be countenanced and a conviction for indirect
contempt by mere motion suffers from a serious procedural
defect (For further readings, see Regalado v. Go, 514 SCRA
616, 629).

A recent case declares:
“A charge for indirect contempt, such as disobedience
to a court’s lawful order, is initiated either motu proprio
by order of or a formal charge by the offended court, or
by a verified petition with supporting particulars and
certified true copies of documents or papers involved
therein, and upon full compliance with the requirements
for filing initiatory pleadings for civil actions in the
court concerned. It cannot be initiated by a mere motion"
(Ladano u. Neri, G.R. No. 178622, November 12, 2012;
Italics supplied).

6. If the contempt charges arose out of or are related
to a principal action pending in the court, the petition for
contempt shall allege such fact but it shall be docketed,
heard and decided separately from the principal action. The
court, however, in the exercise of its discretion, may order the
consolidation of the contempt charge and principal action for
joint hearing and decision (Sec. 4, Rule 71, Rules of Court).

SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS

Rule 71

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

Contempt

Necessity for hearing
1. A respondent in a charge for indirect contempt must
be served with a copy of the petition.

While the respondent is not required to file a formal
answer similar to that in ordinary civil actions, the court
must set the contempt charge for hearing on a fixed date and
time on which the respondent must make his appearance to
answer the charge.

On the date and time of the hearing, the court shall
proceed to investigate the charges and consider such answer
or testimony as the respondent may make or offer (Sec. 6, Rule
71, Rules of Court).
A hearing is required in order to resolve a charge of
indirect contempt; the respondent to the charge may not be
convicted on the basis of written pleadings alone. In contempt
proceedings, the prescribed procedure must be followed. To be
sure, since an indirect contempt charge partakes the nature
of a criminal charge, conviction cannot be had merely on
the basis of written pleadings. A respondent in a contempt
charge must be served with a copy of the motion/petition.
Unlike in civil actions, the Court does not issue summons on
the respondent. While the respondent is not required to file
a formal answer similar to that in ordinary civil actions, the
court must set the contempt charge for hearing on a fixed date
and time on which the respondent must make his appearance
to answer the charge (Silverio v. Silverio, G.R. No. 186589,
July 18, 2014).

2. If he fails to appear on the date of the hearing after
due notice without justifiable reason, the court may order
his arrest, just like the accused in a criminal case who fails
to appear when so required. The court does not declare the
respondent in default. The last paragraph of Sec. 3 of Rule
71 grants the court the authority to hold the respondent in
custody pending the proceedings.

3. If the hearing is not ordered to be had forthwith, the
respondent may be released from custody upon the filing of a

PART II

bond for his appearance at the hearing (Sec. 6, Rule 71, Rules
of Court).
Court where the charge for indirect contempt is to be filed

Where the charge for indirect contempt is to be filed
depends upon the level of the court against which the
contemptuous act was committed.
(a) Where the act was committed against a Regional
Trial Court or a court of equivalent or higher rank, or
against an officer appointed by it, the charge may be filed
with such court (Sec. 5, Rule 71, Rules of Court). (Bar
2012)
(b) Where the act was committed against a lower
court, the charge may be filed with the Regional Trial
Court of the place in which the lower court is sitting. It
may also be filed with the lower court against which the
contempt was allegedly committed. The decision of the
lower court is subject to appeal to the Regional Trial Court
(Sec. 5, Rule 71, Rules of Court; En Banc Resolution, SC,
July 21, 1998).

Unless otherwise provided by law, where the
act was committed against persons, entities, bodies or
agencies exercising quasi-judicial functions, the charge
shall be filed with the Regional Trial Court of the place
wherein the contempt was committed (Sec. 12, Rule 71,
Rules of Court).
(c)

Penalty for indirect contempt

The punishment for indirect contempt depends upon the
level of the court against which the act was committed.
(a) Where the act was committed against a Regional
Trial Court or a court of equivalent or higher rank, he
may be punished by a fine not exceeding thirty thousand
pesos or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months or both
(Sec. 7, Rule 71, Rules of Court; Ciocon-Reer v. Lubao,
A.M. OCA IPI 093210-RTJ, June 20, 2012).

CIVIL ACTIONS
—RuleSPECIAL
71 Contempt

—

411

(b) Where the act was committed against a lower
court, he may be punished by a fine not exceeding five
thousand pesos or imprisonment not exceeding one (1)
month, or both (Sec. 7, Rule 71, Rules of Court; Ciocon-

Reer v. Lubao, A.M. OCA IPI 093210-RTJ, June 20,

2012).

(c) If the contempt consists in the violation of a
writ of injunction, temporary restraining order or status
quo order, he may also be ordered to make complete
restitution to the party injured by such violation of the
property involved or such amount as may be alleged and
proved (Sec. 7, Rule 71, Rules of Court).
(d) Where the act was committed against a person
or entity exercising quasi-judicial functions, the penalty
imposed shall depend upon the provisions of the law
authorizing a penalty for contempt against such persons
or entities. Rule 71, however, has suppletory effect (Sec.
12, Rule 71, Rules of Court).

Imprisonment until the order is obeyed
1. Section 8 of Rule 71 of the Rules of Court provides
for indefinite incarceration in contempt proceedings to
compel a party to comply with the order of the court. “When
the contempt consists in the refusal or omission to do an act
which is yet in the power of the respondent to perform, he
may be imprisoned by order of the court concerned until he
performs it.”

This may be resorted to where the attendant circum¬

stances are such that the non-compliance with the court order

is an utter disregard of the authority of the court, which has
no other recourse but to use its coercive power. When a person
or party is legally and validly required by a court to appear
before it for a certain purpose, and that requirement is dis¬
obeyed, the only remedy left for the court is to use its coercive
power of contempt to bring such person or party before it.
2. The punishment is imposed for the benefit of a
complainant or a party to a suit who has been injured, aside

n

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

from the need to compel performance of the orders or decrees
of the court, which the contemnor refuses to obey although
able to do so. In effect, it is within the power of the person
adjudged guilty of contempt to set himself free.
3. It is only the judge, who orders the confinement of
a person for contempt of court, who can issue the Order of
Release (Inoturan v. Limsiaco, Jr., 458 SCRA 48, 56).
Release of respondent

A person imprisoned for contempt may be discharged
provided that the interest of the public will not be prejudiced
by such release. The release shall be upon the order of the
same court which ordered the imprisonment (Sec. 10, Rule 71,
Rules of Court).
Remedy of a person adjudged in indirect contempt

A person adjudged in indirect contempt may appeal from
the judgment or final order of the court in the same manner
as in criminal cases. The appeal will not, however, have the
effect of suspending the judgment if the person adjudged in
contempt does not file a bond in an amount fixed by the court
from which the appeal is taken. This bond is conditioned upon
his performance of the judgment or final order if the appeal is
decided against him (Sec. 11, Rule 71, Rules of Court).
Contempt against quasi-judicial entitles (Bar 2013)

1. The rules on contempt under Rule 71 apply to
contempt committed against persons or entities exercising
quasi-judicial functions. Said rules also suppletorily apply to
rules on contempt which may, pursuant to law, be adopted by
such quasi-judicial bodies (Sec. 12, Rule 71, Rules of Court).

2. The court that has jurisdiction over charges for
indirect contempt committed against quasi-judicial bodies is
the Regional Trial Court of the place where the contemptuous
act was committed (Sec. 12, Rule 71, Rules of Court).

CIVIL ACTIONS
—RuleSPECIAL

413

3. Quasi-judicial bodies that have the power to cite
persons for indirect contempt pursuant to Rule 71 of the
Rules of Court can only do so by initiating them in the proper
Regional Trial Court. It is not within their jurisdiction and
competence to decide the indirect contempt cases. These
matters are still within the province of the Regional Trial
Courts. The requirement for a verified petition must also be
complied with. The DARAB, for example, has no power to
decide the contempt charge filed before it (Land Bank of the
Philippines u. Listana, 408 SCRA 328, 336).
4. Under Art. 218 of the Labor Code, the NLRC (and
the labor arbiters) may hold any offending party in contempt,
directly or indirectly, and impose appropriate penalties in
accordance with law. The penalty for direct contempt consists
of either imprisonment or fine, the degree or amount depends
on whether the contempt is against the Commission or the
labor arbiter. The Labor Code, however, requires the labor
arbiter or the Commission to deal with indirect contempt in
the manner prescribed under Rule 71 of the Rules of Court.
Rule 71 of the Rules of Court does not require the labor
arbiter or the NLRC to initiate indirect contempt proceedings
before the trial court. This mode is to be observed only when
there is no law granting them contempt powers. As is clear
under Art. 218(d) of the Labor Code, the labor arbiter or the
Commission is empowered or has jurisdiction to hold the
offending party or parties in direct or indirect contempt.
“The petitioners, therefore, have not improperly brought the
indirect contempt charges against the respondents before the
NLRC” (Robosa v. National Labor Relations Commission,
G.R. No. 176085, February 8, 2012).

Other kinds of contempt; criminal and civil contempt

Contempt, whether direct or indirect, may be
classified as civil or criminal depending on the nature and
effect of the contemptuous act.
1.

Criminal contempt is “conduct directed against the
authority and dignity of the court or a judge acting judicially;

414

CIVIL PROCEDURE

PART II

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

it is an act obstructing the administration of justice which
tends to bring the court into disrepute or disrespect.” On
the other hand, civil contempt is the failure to do something
ordered to be done by a court or judge for the benefit of the
opposing party therein and is, therefore, an offense against
the party in whose behalf the violated order was made. If the
purpose is to punish, then it is criminal in nature; but if to
compensate, then it is civil (Burgos v. Macapagal-Arroyo, 653
SCRA 512, 536, July 5, 2011 citing Montenegro v. Montenegro,
431 SCRA 415).

2. The following pronouncements made in Lorenzo
Shipping Corporation u. Distribution Association Management
of the Philippines, 656 SCRA 331, 334, are highly instructive:

a. Proceedings for contempt are sui generis, in
nature criminal, but may be resorted to in civil, as well
as in criminal actions, and independently of any action.
They are of two classes, the criminal or punitive, and the
civil or remedial.
b. A criminal contempt consists in conduct that
is directed against the authority and dignity of a court
or judge acting judicially, as in unlawfully assailing or
discrediting the authority and dignity of the court or
judge, or doing a duly forbidden act.

c. A civil contempt consists in the failure to do
something ordered to be done by a court or judge in a
civil case for the benefit of the opposing party therein.
d. It is, at times, difficult to determine whether
the proceedings are civil or criminal. In general, the
character of the contempt of whether it is criminal or civil
is determined by the nature of the contempt involved,
regardless of the cause in which the contempt arose, and
by the relief sought or dominant purpose.

The proceedings are to be regarded as criminal when
the purpose is primarily punishment, and civil, when the
purpose is primarily compensatory or remedial. Where the
dominant purpose is to enforce compliance with an order of
a court for the benefit of a party in whose favor the order

CIVIL ACTIONS
—RuleSPECIAL
71 Contempt

—

416

runs, the contempt is civil; where the dominant purpose is to
vindicate the dignity and authority of the court, and protect

the interests of the general public, the contempt is criminal.
Indeed, the criminal proceedings vindicate the dignity of the
courts, but the civil proceedings protect, preserve, and enforce
the rights of private parties and compel obedience to orders,
judgments and decrees made to enforce such rights (See also
Rosario Textile Mills, Inc. u. Court of Appeals, 409 SCRA 515,
523-524).
3. In proceedings for criminal contempt, the defendant
is presumed innocent and the burden is on the prosecution to
prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt. The presumption
of innocence can be overcome only by proof of guilt beyond
reasonable doubt, which means proof to the satisfaction of
the court and keeping in mind the presumption of innocence
that precludes every reasonable hypothesis except that for
which it is given. It is not sufficient for the proof to establish a
probability, even though strong, that the fact charged is more
likely true than the contrary. It must establish the truth of
the fact to a reasonable and moral certainty - a certainty that
convinces and satisfies the reason and conscience of those who
are to act upon it (Burgos v. Macapagal-Arroyo, 653 SCRA
512, 537, July 5, 2011 citing Montenegro v. Montenegro, 431
SCRA 415).

Criticism of courts
1. As an officer of the court, a lawyer may criticize the
court. The right of a lawyer, or any person, for that matter, to
be critical of courts and magistrates, as long as they are made
in properly respectful terms and through legitimate channels
has long been recognized and respected (Fudot u. Cattleya
Land, Inc., 570 SCRA 86, 108-109).
2. It was likewise held that no matter how firm a
lawyer’s conviction in the righteousness of his cause, there
is simply no excuse for denigrating the courts and engaging
in public behavior that tends to put the courts and the legal
profession into disrepute (A.M. 10-10-4-SC Re: Letter of the
Law Faculty of the UP Law Entitled “Restoring Integrity: A

416

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

Statement by the Faculty of the University of the Philippines
College of Law on the Allegations of Plagiarism and
Misrepresentation in the Supreme Court).
3. One relatively recent case instructs: “The power
to punish for contempt does not, however, render the courts
impenetrable to public scrutiny nor does it place them beyond
the scope of legitimate criticism. Every citizen has the right
to comment upon and criticize the actuations of public officers
and such right is not diminished by the fact that the criticism
is aimed at judicial authority. It is the cardinal condition of
all such criticisms, however, that it shall be bona fide, and
shall not spill over the walls of decency and propriety. A wide
chasm exists between fair criticism, on the one hand; and
abuse and slander of courts and the judges thereof, on the
other. Intemperate and unfair criticism is a gross violation of
the duty to respect courts and therefore warrants the wielding
of the power to punish for contempt” (Garcia v. Manrique,
G.R. No. 186592, October 10, 2012).
Contempt of court as distinguished from disciplinary actions
in the practice of law

While a lawyer’s violation of his duties as an officer of the
court may also constitute contempt, the grounds for holding
a person in contempt and for holding him administratively
liable for the violation of his lawyer’s oath are distinct and
separate from each other. They are specified in Rule 71 of the
Rules of Court. A finding of contempt on the part of a lawyer
does not preclude the imposition of disciplinary sanctions
against him for his contravention of the ethics of the legal
profession.

Moreover, it has been held that the imposition of a fine
as a penalty in a contempt proceeding is not considered res
judicata to a subsequent charge for unprofessional conduct. In
the same manner, an attorney’s conviction for contempt was
not collaterally estopped by reason of a subsequent disbarment
proceeding in which the court found in his favor on essentially
the same facts leading to conviction. It has likewise been the
rule that a notice to a lawyer to show cause why he should not

PART II

—

SPECIAL CIVIL ACTIONS

Rule 71

— Contempt

417

be punished for contempt cannot be considered as a notice to
show cause why he should not be suspended from the practice
of law, considering that they have distinct objects and for each
of them a different procedure is established. Contempt of court
is governed by the procedures laid down under Rule 71 of the
Rules of Court, whereas disciplinary actions in the practice of
law are governed by Rules 138 and 139 thereof (Siy v. NLRC,
G.R No. 158971, August 25, 2005).
Contempt in relation to execution of judgments

1. Generally, contempt is not a means of enforcing a
judgment. For example, the mere refusal or unwillingness of
a judgment debtor to comply with an order of a court to vacate
the property is not a sufficient ground to hold him in contempt.
A writ of possession is not directed against a judgment debtor
but to a sheriff who is ordered to deliver the property to the
prevailing party. As such writ does not command a judgment
debtor to do anything, he cannot be guilty of “disobedience of
or resistance to a lawful writ, process, order, or judgment or
command of any court” punishable under Rule 71 of the Rules
of Court (See also Barrete v. Amila, 230 SCRA 219, 223).
The proper procedure is not for the court to cite the
losing party, in actions to recover real property for instance,
in contempt. What the sheriff should do is to dispossess him
of the property. If after the dispossession, he should continue
to execute acts of ownership or possession, or in any manner
disturb the possession of the judgment creditor, then and
only then may he be charged with and punished for contempt
(Pascua u. Heirs of Segundo Simeon, 161 SCRA 1, 5). It is
not the refusal of the losing party to vacate which constitutes
contempt but the act of re-entry after his ouster from the
property. The contempt proceedings in this case will be
pursuant to Sec. 3(b) of Rule 71.

2. When the subject of execution is a special judgment,
which directs the performance of an act other than the
payment of money, sale or delivery of property or those other
acts mentioned in Secs. 9 and 10 of Rule 39, the judgment
can be complied with only by the judgment obligor or officer

418

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

so directed by the judgment and not anyone else. This kind
of judgment, like in mandamus, is specifically directed to the
person required to obey the same. If he disobeys the judgment,
he may be punished for contempt (Sec. 11, Rule 39, Rules of
Court). The refusal constitutes a violation of a writ, process or
order directed to the party required to obey the same and falls
squarely within the purview of Sec. 3(b) of Rule 71 in relation
to Sec. 11 of Rule 39.

3. An officer, who disobeys a writ of certiorari against
him, shall be punished for contempt (Sec. 9, Rule 65, Rules of
Court).
Contempt powers of the legislature; legislativeinvestigations
1. The contempt power of the legislature has been
traditionally exercised in relation to its power to conduct
legislative inquiries. Section 21 of Art. VI of the Philippine
Constitution provides:

“x x x The Senate or House of Representatives or
any of its respective committees may conduct inquiries
in aid of legislation in accordance with its duly published
rules of procedure. The rights of persons appearing in or
affected by such inquiries shall be respected.”

2. Clearly, the above provision, while recognizing the
congressional power to conduct legislative inquiries, also
provides for the following limitations to the power:

i

PART II

CIVIL ACTIONS
—RuleSPECIAL
71 Contempt

—

419

provision(s) of the Constitution. Thus, as provided
therein, the investigation must be “in aid of legislation
in accordance with its duly published rules of procedure”
and that “the rights of persons appearing in or affected
by such inquiries shall be respected.” It follows then that
the rights of persons under the Bill of Rights must be
respected, including the right to due process and the right
not to be compelled to testify against one’s self’ (Bengzon,

Jr. u. Senate Blue Ribbon Committee, G.R. No. L-89914,
November 20, 1991).

4. There is no express constitutional provision which
vests Congress with the power to cite non- members of the

legislature for contempt. This power has, however, been
invoked by Congress as a means of preserving its authority
and dignity (Arnault v. Nazareno, 87 Phil. 29 [1950]; Arnault
v. Balagtas, 97 Phil. 358 [1955]), in the same way that courts
wield an inherent power to “enforce their authority, preserve
their integrity, maintain their dignity, and ensure the
effectiveness of the administration of justice. (Commissioner
v. Cloribel, 127 Phil. 716, 723 [1967]; In re: Kelly 35 Phil.
944, 950 [1916], and other cases)’’ (Negros Oriental II Electric
Cooperative, Inc. u. Sangguniang Panlungsod of Dumaguete,
G.R. No. 72492, November 5, 1987).
The extent of the contempt powers of the legislature was
clearly explained in the early case of Arnault v. Balagtas, G.R.
No. L-6749, July 30, 1955, when the Court, in no uncertain
terms, described such powers as implied or inherent to the
exercise of legislative powers.

(a) it must be exercised in aid of legislation;
(b) it must be in accordance with the duly published
rules of procedure; and
(c) the rights of persons appearing in or affected by
such inquiries shall be respected.

3.

Jurisprudence teaches, thus:

‘The power of both houses of Congress to conduct
inquiries in aid of legislation is not, therefore, absolute
or unlimited. Its exercise is circumscribed by the x x x

Contempt power of local legislative bodies
The case of Negros Oriental II Electric Cooperative, Inc.
u. Sangguniang Panlungsod of Dumaguete, G.R. No. 72492,
November 5, 1987, instructs that local legislative bodies do
not possess the contempt power of Congress. Clearly, the
Court holds:
“The exercise by the legislature of the contempt
power is a matter of self-preservation as that branch
of the government vested with the legislative power,

420

CIVIL PROCEDURE

(THE BAR LECTURES SERIES)

VOLUME II

independently of the judicial branch, asserts its authority
and punishes contempts thereof. The contempt power
of the legislature is, therefore, sui generis, and local

legislative bodies cannot correctly claim to possess it
for the same reasons that the national legislature does.
The power attaches not to the discharge of legislative
functions per se but to the character of the legislature as
one of the three independent and coordinate branches
of government. The same thing cannot be said of local
legislative bodies which are creations of law.
To begin with, there is no express provision either in
the 1973 Constitution or in the Local Government Code
(Batas Pambansa Big. 337) granting local legislative
bodies, the power to subpoena witnesses and the power to
punish non- members for contempt. Absent a constitutional
or legal provision for the exercise of these powers, the
only possible justification for the issuance of a subpoena
and for the punishment of non-members for contumacious
behaviour would be for said power to be deemed implied

in the statutory grant of delegated legislative power. But,
the contempt power and the subpoena power partake of
a judicial nature. They cannot be implied in the grant of
legislative power. Neither can they exist as mere incidents
of the performance of legislative functions. To allow local
legislative bodies or administrative agencies to exercise
these powers without express statutory basis would run
afoul of the doctrine of separation of powers.
XXX

There being no provision in the Local Government
Code explicitly granting local legislative bodies, the power
to issue compulsory process and the power to punish for
contempt, the Sanggunian Panlungsod of Dumaguete
is devoid of power to punish the petitioners Torres and
Umbac for contempt. The Ad-Hoc Committee of said
legislative body has even less basis to claim that it can
exercise these powers” (Underscoring supplied).
