Since the first edition was launched in 2015, there has been a
lot of positive feedback from students, bar reviewees, law professors,
lawyers and judges alike about this humble work.
One reason is that this book includes all the rules on special
proceedings, from Rules 72 to 109, with explanation as to which
rules are still relevant, and which have already been superseded
by certain laws and Supreme Court issuances. Notably, the said
rules, together with special writs aside from habeas corpus, plus an
exegesis on declaration of nullity of void marriages, annulment of
voidable marriages and legal separation, not to mention the rules
on arbitration, completely cover all kinds of special proceedings.
Hence, it is considered to be an ideal textbook in law school.
Another reason is the exhaustive discussion of settlement of
estate of deceased persons. Many judges consider such cases as most
problematic" simply because many of the rules pertaining thereto
are already archaic. In fact, the rules on special proceedings are the
only set of rules in the Rules of Court which have not been revised.
These are part of the original Rules of Court promulgated by the
Supreme Court to be effective on January 1, 1964. The term "Court of
First Instance" is still used, instead of "Regional Trial Court" which
came about by virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, the Judiciary
Reorganization Act of 1980, which took effect on August 14, 1981.
The seven stages and six flowcharts in the chapter on settlement of estate are meant to illumine and make the rules intelligible,
especially for practitioners and members of the bench, who may
sometimes be flummoxed by the arcane jargon employed therein.
Also, said chapter has the most number of case digests, stressing
its importance.
This second edition is enlivened by the addition of recent
cases, showing that the field of special proceedings continues to be
a dynamic one, and will hopefully serve as cogent guidance for the
reader, be it in the academe or elsewhere.

My co-author, Atty. Dianna Louise R. Wilwayco-Dela Guerra,
who brought honor to the Ateneo Law School by placing second in the
2013 bar examinations, and is now an experienced practitioner, has
done her best, as always, to help out in this endeavor. She deserves
my heartfelt gratitude.
PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
MAGDANGAL M. DE LEON

Special Proceedings is one of the branches of Remedial Law.
Next to Civil Procedure (Rules 1-71), it hes the most number of
rules, 38 in all (Rules 72.-109), 18 of them pertaining to settlement
of estate of deceased persons. In law school, it is not considered to
be an "exciting" subject, thus requiring a creative approach by a
skilled professor to ignite and sustain his students' interest.
Among the 13 special proceedings subject of the rules, only
eight are still relevant, namely: settlement of estate, escheat,
guardianship, adoption, habeas corpus, change of name, declaration
of absence, and cancellation of entries in the civil registry. Some have
been rendered inoperative, such as the rule on voluntary dissolution
of corporation and the rule on constitution of family home, by
salient provisions of the Corporation Code and the Family Code,
respectively. Rule 101 on Hospitalization of Insane Persons is no
longer utilized. Rules 99.-100 on Adoption and Rescission of Adoption
have been superseded by the Rule on Adoption, which now prescribes
the procedure in both domestic and inter-country adoptions, in
relation to legislations on the subject. As to Guardianship, Rules 9297 have been modified in the sense that said rules are now applicable
only to incompetents who are not Minors, because of the Rule on
Guardianship of Minors, which falls under the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Family Courts. Similarly, correction of entries under Rule 108
is now limited to substantial corrections on account of Republic Act
No. 9048, which gives jurisdiction to the Local Civil Registrar over
corrections of clerical errors.
Aside from the special proceedings under the Rules of Court,
the Supreme Court has promulgated the Rules on Writs of Amparo,
Habeas Data and Kalikasan, which are special proceedings. These
rules ere covered, together with the Writ of Habeas Corpus, in the
chapter on Special Writs. Likewise, worthy of inclusion are the rules
on declaration of nullity of void marriages and annulment of voidable
marriages and legal separation, which are also special proceedings.
Arbitration is likewise relevant, considering that under the
Arbitration Law (Republic Act No. 876) and Alternative Dispute

iv

Resolution Act of 2004 (Republic Act No. 9285). proceedings for
recognition and enforcement of arbitral agreement or for vacation,
setting aside, correction or modification of an arbitral award and any
application with a court for arbitration assistance and supervision
are deemed special proceedings. The procedure is outlined in the
Special Rules of Court on Alternative Dispute Resolution.
The book is divided into several major perts: Part I consists of
the Rules on Settlement of Estate (Rules 73.90); and Part II deals
with other Special Proceedings (Rules 91-108), as well es Appeals
in Special Proceedings (Rule 109).
Part III is about the Rules on Declaration of Nullity of Void
Marriages and Annulment of Voidable Marriages and Legal Separation, together with Provisional Orders. Part IV covers Arbitration,
and Part V is a Summary of the Venues of Special Proceedings.
Strikingly, this subject has been animated by recent rulings of
the Supreme Court, such as those in settlement of estate, adoption,
habeas corpus, amparo, habeas data and nullity of marriage, which
demonstrates that special proceedings are an integral part of the
judicial landscape.
I hope that this humble work would be of practical value to law
students, bar reviewees, law professors, lawyers, and even members
of the bench. My utmost gratitude to my co-author, Atty. Dianna
Louise R. Wilwayco, one of my most brilliant students, who, at a
very young age, is already making her mark in the legal firmament
of our country. Also deserving of acknowledgment is Atty. Reyna Fe
C. Itchon-Fernandez, for her indispensable assistance in additional
research of legal materials and editing of this book.

INTRODUCTION
Civil Action and Special Proceedings distinguished
The 1997 Rules of Court defines a civil action as one by which
a party sues another for the enforcement or protection of a right or
the prevention or redress of a wrong.' This follows the definition
of an action in the Old Rules of Court.2 It is a "formal demand of
one's legal rights in a court of justice in the manner prescribed by
the court or by the law. It is the method of applying legal remedies
according to definite established rules."i A special proceeding,
on the other hand, pertains to a remedy by which a party seeks to
establish a status, a right, or a particular fact.' It is not accurate to
characterize a special proceeding as a mere form of or subspecies of
an action, since an action is an ordinary suit in the courts of justice,
while special proceedings refer to every other remedy furnished by
law.
Explaining the crucial distinction between an ordinary action
and a special proceeding, Chief Justice Moran stated:~
Action is the act by which one sues another in a court
of justice for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the
prevention or redress of a wrong while special proceeding is
the act by which one seeks to establish the status or right of a
party, or a particular fact. Hence, action is distinguished from
spc,cial proceeding in that the former is a formal demand of a
right by one against another, while the latter is but a petition

for a declaration of a status. right, or fact. Where a party litigant
seeks to recover property from another, his remedy is to file
an action. Where his purpose is to seek the appointment of a
guardian for an insane, his remedy is a special proceeding to
establish the fact or status of insanity calling for an appointment
of guardianship."
An action, furthermore, must necessarily involve at least
two parties: a plaintiff who initiates a case with the filing of the
complaint and a defendant who responds through an answer. The
very definition of a civil action contemplates at least two parties in
the phrase "a party sues another," who is a definite adverse party.'
The issues or disputes alleged in the pleadings are generally heard
by a court of general jurisdiction, which must rule on the respective
rights and obligations of the parties. An action is adversarial in
nature because it is always based on a cause of action. except for
certain special civil actions, which are not based on a cause of action.
Conversely, special proceedings usually involve just one party, who
usually initiates the proceedings with a petition, an application, or
a special form of a pleading. Oppositors may join the proceedings by
responding through their oppositions. The issues that may be ruled
upon by the court are dictated by the law, because it exercises limited
jurisdiction in a special proceeding. As a general rule, it is nonadversarial in nature when initiated, but it may become adversarial
in the course of the proceedings when there are oppositors. Moreover,
special proceedings are not usually based on a cause of action, with
certain exceptions such as in habeas corpus. In a special proceeding,
the remedy is generally granted upon application or motion, and
formal pleadings are not usually required, unless the statute
expressly provides so.

CHAPTER I - INTRODUCTION
Rule 72 - Subject Matter and Applicability of General Rules

General provision
RULE 72
SUBJECT MATTER AND APPLICABILITY

OF GENERAL RULES
SEC. I. Subject matter of special proceedings. Rules of special proceedings are provided for in the
following cases:
(a) Settlement of estate of deceased persons;
(b) Escheat;
(c)

Guardianship and custody of children;

(d) Trustees;
(e) Adoption;
(f)

Rescission and revocation of adoption;

(i)

Change of name;

j)

Voluntary dissolution or corporations;

(k) Judicial approval ofvoluntary recognition
of minor children;

(l)

Constitution of family home;

(m) Declaration of absence and death;
Nature of Special Proceedings
Generally, special proceedings are non-adversarial in nature,
because there is no definite adverse party in such proceedings.'
For this reason, it is entitled, for example, as "In the Matter of the
Intestate Estate of..." or"In Re: Petition for Appointment ofGuardian
Ad Litem of the Minors.." It may remain non-adversarial until the
case is concluded, or it may also happen that it is transformed into
an adversarial proceeding, such as when there are oppositors to the
petition.

(n) Cancellation or correction of entries in

Rule 72, Section 1 is not meant to be Bn r.xclusive list of what
may be considered as special proceedings. As long as the remedy
seeks the establishment of a right, status, or a particular fact, then
such may be called a special proceeding, regardless of whether it is
included in the foregoing enumeration. For instance, a petition for
liquidation of an insolvent corporation, such as a bank, was classified
as a special proceeding resembling a petition for the settlement of
the estate of a deceased person. The issue whether such petition for
liquidation is an ordinary civil action or a special proceeding was

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS
Essentials for Bench and Bar

resolved in Pacific Banking Corporation Employees Organization v.
Court of Appeals' in this wise:
..A petition for liquidation of an insolvent corporation
should be classified as a special proceeding and not an ordinary

action. Such petition does not seek the enforcement or protection
of a right nor the prevention or redress of a wrong against a
party. It does not pray for affirmative relief for injury arising
from a party's wrongful act or omission nor state a cause of
action that can be enforced against any person. What it seeks
is merely a declaration by the trial court of the corporation's
insolvency so that its creditors may be able to file their claims in
the settlement of the corporation's debts and obligations."
Likewise, a petition for annulment of marriage is a special
proceeding since it seeks to establish a status or right or a
particular fact.• ln the same vein, questions as to who are the heirs
of the decedent, proof of filiation of illegitimate children, and the
determination of the estate of the decedent have to be decided in a
probate court or in a special proceeding, and cannot be adjudicated
in an ordinary action for recovery of ownership and possession."

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS
Essentials for Bench and Bar

SEC. 2. Applicability of rules of civil actions.
- In the absence of special provisions, the rules
provided for in ordinary actions shall be, as far as
practicable, applicable in special proceedings.
Like civil actions, the rules on special proceedings must be
liberally construed in order to promote their objective of securing a
just, speedy, and inexpensive disposition of every proceeding." This
is premised on Section 2, which provides that the rules for ordinary
actions shall be applicable to special proceedings, save in cases
where special provisions exist and provide otherwise. As a result,
the Supreme Court has held that the provisions of the Rules of Civil
Procedure, particularly on: (1) preparation, filing and service of
applications, motions. and other papers, (2) omnibus motion rule,
(3) subpoena, (4) computation of time. (5) motion for new trial, (6)
modes of discovery, (7) trial before commissioners, and (8) demurrer
to evidence" also apply to special proceedings. In fact, the procedure
of appeal in special proceedings should follow the procedure of
appeal in civil actions, to wit:"

CHAPTF,R 1- INTRODL'CTION
Rule 72 Subject Matter and Applicability of General Rules

Furthermore, in Sheker u. Estate of Alice O. Sheker, the
Supreme Court ruled that a certification against forum shopping is
required in special proceedings, viz..
"This means that in the absence of special provisions, rules
in ordinary actions may be applied in special proceedings as
much as possible and where doing so would not pose an obstacle
to said proceedings. Nowhere in the Rules of Court docs it
categorically say that rules in ordinary actions are inapplicable
or merely suppletory to special proceedings. Provisions of the
Rules of Court requiring a certification of non-forum shopping
for complaints and initiatory pleadings, a written explanation
for non-p4;1n.onal service and filing, and the payment of filing
fees for money claims against an estate would not in any way
obstruct probate proceedings, thus, they are applicable to special
proceedings such as the settlement of the estate of a deceased
person as in the present case."a-1

"Moreover, Section 2, Rule 73, of the Rules of Court
provides that the rules on ordinary civil actions are applicable
in special proceedings where they are not inconsistent with, or
when they may serve to supplement the provisions relating to
special proceedings. Consequently, the procedure of appeal is
the same in civil actions as in special proceedings." (See Moran's
Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. II, 1957 Ea., p. 326.)

Since a special proceeding is not a suit or ordinary action
whereby a party sues another for the enforcement of a right or
the prevention of a wrong, the requirement that no suit shall be
filed or maint.nincd between members of the same family unless it
should appear that earnest efforts toward a compromise have been
made, hut that the same have failed, does not apply to a special
proceeding."

SETTLEMENT OF ESTATE
OF DECEASED PERSONS
CHAPTER II
IN GENERA L, VENUE, AND PROCESS
When succession vasts
Article 777 of the Civil Code provides the substantive basis for
the rules governing the estate of deceased persons. The article states
that the rights to succession are transmitted from the moment of
death of the decedent. Nevertheless, before the actual transmission
of rights, the procedural guidelines set forth in Rules 73 to 90 must
be observed. Once the procedure outlined in the Rules of Court is
complied with, the rights of the heirs retroact to the time of death of
the person whose estate was settled.

VENUE AND PROC ESS

SEC. 1. Where estate ofdeceased persons settled.
- If the decedent is an inhabitant of the Philippines
at the time of his death, whether a citizen or alien,
his will shall be proved, or letters of administration
granted, and his estate settled, in the Court of
First Instance in the province in which he resides
at the time of his death, and if he is an inhabitant
of a foreign country, the Court of First Instance
of any province in which he had estate. The court
first taking cognizance of the settlement of the
estate of a decedent, shall exercise jurisdiction to
the exclusion of all other courts. The jurisdiction
assumed by a court, so far as it depends on the
place of residence of the decedent, or of the location
of his estate, shall not be contested in a suit or
proceeding, except in an appeal from the court, in
the original case, or when the want of jurisdiction
appears on the record.

Modes of settlement of estate

Proceedings for settlement of estate

The estate of a deceased person may be settled with or without
court intervention. Court intervention is not necessary in case of
extrajudicial settlement, which presupposes that the deceased has
left no will, no debts, and whose heirs are all of age.' The decedent's
estate may also be settled with the intervention of the court in the
following scenarios:

In a special proceeding for settlement of estate, the petitioners
seek to establish a status, e right, or a particular fact, i.e., the feet of
death and to be duly recognized as among the heirs of the deceased
so that they can validly exercise their right to participate in the
settlement end liquidation of the estate of the decedent consistent
with the limited end special jurisdiction of the probate court.6

Summary settlement of estate of small value,2
Partition, a and

The settlement of estate requires certain steps to be taken
before a compulsory heir may get his legal share. The net estate of the
decedent must be ascertained, by deducting all payable obligations
and charges from the value of the property owned by the deceased at
the time of his death; then, all donations subject to collation would be
added to it. With the partible estate thus determined, the legitime of
the compulsory heir or heirs can he established; and only thereafter
can it be ascertained whether or not a donation had prejudiced the
legitime."

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS
Essentials for Bench and Bar

Jurisdiction over settlement of estate
Municipal Trial Courts and Regional Trial Courts are
both empowered to take cognizance of estate proceedings. What
determines which court has jurisdiction will depend on the gross value
of the estate concerned. The Municipal Trial Court' has exclusive
jurisdiction to settle an estate if its gross value does not exceed
P300,000.00 or P400,000.00 if within Metro Manila. If it exceeds
these amounts, then the Regional Trial Court has jurisdiction.
This is pursuant to Republic Act No. 7691, which amended Batas
Pambansa Blg. 129, effective April 15, 1994.' Thus, for purposes of
determining which court has jurisdiction in the settlement of the
estate of a deceased person, neither residence nor citizenship is
taken into account. In fact, the gross value of the estate delineates
which court has jurisdiction therein. It is only probate proceedings
that fall under the jurisdiction of the municipal trial court. All other
special proceedings are triable by, and fall within the exclusive
original jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Courts and Family Courts.
Rule 73, Section 1 relates to venue, not Jurisdiction

Rule 73, Section 1 actually provides for the venue of actions for
the settlement of the estate of deceased persons. As held in Garcia
Pule u. Court of Appeals:•
The forequoted Section 1, Rule 73 (formerly Rule 75,
Section 1), specifically the clause 'so far as it depends on the
place of residence of the decedent. or or the location of the
state,' is in reality a matter of venue, as the caption of the
Rule indicates: 'Settlement of Estate of Deceased Persons.
Venue and Processes.' It could not have been intended to define
the jurisdiction over the subject matter, because such legal
proV1sion is contained in a law of procedure dealing merely with
procedural matters. Procedure is one thing, jurisdiction over the
subject matter is another. The power or authority of the court
over the subject matter 'existed was fixed before procedure in
a R'\ven cause began.' That power or authority is not altered or
changed by procedure, which simply directs the manner in which
the power or authority shall be fully and justly exercised. There
are cases though that if the power is not exercised conformably

with the provisions of the procedural law, purely, the court
attempting to exercise it loses the power to exercise it legally.
However, this docs not amount to a loss of jurisdiction over the
subject matter. Rather, it means that the court may thereby lose
jurisdiction over the person or that the judgment may thereby
be rendered defective for lack of something essential to sustain
it. The appearance of this provision in the procedural law at once
raises a strong presumption that it has nothing to do with the
jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter. In plain words,
it is just a matter of method, of convenience to the parties."

Clearly, Rule 73, Section 1 relates to the matter of venue of
estate proceedings when it refers to the decedent's place or residence
or location of the decedent's estate. In order to determine the proper
venue in estate proceedings, one looks into the fact of residency in
the Philippines and not the fact of citizenship. If the decedent was
residing in the Philippines at the time of death, regardless of whether
the decedent is a citizen or alien, the estate must be settled in the
decedent's place of residence. Conversely, if the decedent was not a
resident at the time of death, estate proceedings may be commenced
in any place where any of the decedent's properties are located.
In order to preclude different courts which may properly
assume jurisdiction from doing so, the Rule specifies that "the court
first taking cognizance of the settlement of the estate of a decedent,
shall exercise jurisdiction to the exclusion of all other courts."10
Preference, however, is given in favor of the court where testate
proceedings, as compared to intestate proceedings, are held.
Consequently, as soon as the probate court acquires jurisdiction
over all the properties of the deceased, no other court can dispose of
such properties without the probate court's approval, for that would
be tantamount to divesting the latter with jurisdiction. u This rule,
however, is limited only to Philippine courts. 12
Once the court assumes jurisdiction, it shall not be contested so
far as it depends on the decedent's place of residence or the location
of the estate. As an exception, impropriety of venue may be raised
"Malig u Bush, G.R. No. L22761, May 31, 1969.
Union Bank u. Santibanez, GR No. 149926. Februry 23, 2005.
Section I of Rule 73 refers to courts in the Philippines and simply means
that once a special proceeding for the settlement of the estate of u decedent is fled in
one of such courts, that court has exclusive jursdiction over said estate und no other
special proceedings involving the same subject mntter my be fled before any other
court. (Republic u. Vtlarama, G.R. No, 117733, September 5, 1997)

SPF.CIAL PROCEEDINGS

in two instances: (1) in an appeal from the court, in the original
case, or (2) when the want of jurisdiction appears on the record.
Thus, venue may be assailed only when the estate proceedings
brought up on appeal or if a plain reading of the records of the case
will immediately show that venue was improperly laid. To illustrate
the second scenario, for example, while the petition for probate of
the will alleges that the decedent was a resident of Makati City at
the time of death, the petition was filed in the city of Paranaque.
Obviously, the petition should be dismissed for improper venue
because the allegations of the petition indubitably show that it
should have been filed in Makati City. Nevertheless, the fact that the
estate proceedings are initiated neither in the decedent's residence
nor where the decedent's estate is located is not jurisdictional and
may be waived if not raised. u Objection to improper venue should be

How then is "residence" defined for purposes of settlement of
estate? It refers to ..actual or physical" residence, as distinguished
from "legal residence" or "domicile." Though residence may be
considered as synonymous with "domicile," such assertion only
applies in election cases. It has been held that for purposes of fixing
the venue under the Rules of Court, the "residence" of a person
refers to one's personal, actual or physical habitation, or actual
residence or place of abode, which may not necessarily be one's legal
residence or domicile provided one resides therein with continuity
and consistency." In other words, "resides" should be viewed or
understood in its popular sense; it signifies physical presence in •
place and actual stay thereat."Thus, the fact that a deceased person's
death certificate shows that he was a resident of Capas, Tarlac, did
not stop the Supreme Court from upholding the jurisdiction of the
Regional Trial Court of Las Piias City, where he actually resided."
Moreover, as a matter of principle, testate proceedings take
precedence over mtestate proceedings over the 8same estate."

Roberts u. Leonidas" involved two proceedings to settle the estate of
Edward M. Grimm. Intestate proceedings were initiated in the Court
of First Instance of Manila, Branch 20 by Ethel Grimm Roberts,
the decedent's daughter from his first marriage. Subsequently, a
petition for reprobate of will was initiated by the decedent's second
wife, which wills were already admitted into probate in Utah. Ethel
Roberts sought the dismissal of the testate proceedings. In affirming
the lower court's denial of the motion to dismiss, the Supreme Court
held that the probate of the decedent's will is mandatory. It was
further held that ..(i]t is anomalous that the estate of a person who
died testate should be settled in an intestate proceeding. Therefore,
the intestate case should be consolidated with the testate
proceeding and the judge assigned to the testate proceeding should
continue hearing the two cases. "211
The pronouncement in Roberts that the intestate and testate
proceedings should be consolidated in the testate proceedings
was not strictly followed in Uriarte u. Court of First Instance." In
Uriarte, petitioner Vicente, the alleged natural son of the decedent,
initiated intestate proceedings to settle the estate of his father in
Negros Occidental. The decedent's other heirs opposed the intestate
proceedings, claiming that the decedent left and executed a will.
Instead of presenting the will for probate in the existing intestate
proceedings in Negros Occidental, the private respondents filed a
petition for probate of the decedent's alleged will in Manila. The
Supreme Court ruled that the private respondents should have
submitted the decedent's will for probate either on motion in the
pending intestate proceedings or as a separate proceeding.a The
Court further held:
Th us it has been held repeatedly that, if' in the course
of intestate proceedings pending before a court of first instance
it is found that the decedent had left a last will, proceedings
for the probate of' the latter should replace the intes tate

without prejudice that should the alleged last will be rejected or
is disapproved, the proceeding shall continue us an intestacy. As
already adverted to, this is a clear indication that proceedings for
the probate of a will enjoy priority over intestate procee dings."

Conversely, such court, may upon learning that a petition
for probate of the decedent's last will has been presented in
another court where the decedent obviously had his conjugal
domicile and resided with his surviving widow and their minor
children. and that the allegation of the intestate petition before
it stating that the decedent died intestate may be actually false,
may decline to take cognizance of the petition and hold the
petition before it in abeyance. and instead defer to the second
court which has before it the petition for probate of the decedent's
alleged last will."

In Cuenco v. Court of Appeals," the settlement of estate was
instituted in two courts, an intestate and a testate proceeding. The
question of jurisdiction was raised in both courts. Former Senator
Mariano Cuenco's children by his first marriage (respondents)
instituted intestate proceedings in Cebu City, alleging that the
decedent was a resident of Cebu at the time of his death. A week
later, Senator Mariano Cuenco's second wife (petitioner) filed a
petition for probate of his will in Quezon City. When the testate
proceedings were initiated in Quezon City, the respondents had not
yet complied with the Cebu Court's order to publish the notice of
hearing. Upon learning of the existence of the intestate proceedings
in the Cebu Court, the pet1t1oneropposed the same and filed a motion
to dismiss. The Cebu Court issued an order deferring to the testate
proceedings in the Quezon City Court. The respondents, on the other
hand, questioned the Quezon City Court's jurisdiction, arguing
that exclusive jurisdiction was vested in the Cebu Court when they
instituted the intestate proceedings. Thus, on the issue of which
among the Quezon City Court and Cebu Court had jurisdiction the
Supreme Court qualified that the rule on venue "does not state that
the court with whom the estate or intestate petition is first filed
acquires exclusive Jurisdiction.":15 In order for the court to which the
estate proceeding is first filed to acquire exclusive jurisdiction, said
court must also first take cognizance of the same, to wit:
"A _fair reading of the Rule
since it deals with venue
and comity between courts of equal and co-ordinate jurisdiction
- mdicates that the court with whom the petition is first filed
must also first tahe cognizance of the settlement of the estate in
""""; "a rise jurisdiction over it o the exclusion of all other

16

The factual milieus in Uriarte and Cuenco seem similar and
yet the Court's ruling on which court should the proceedings be
consolidated appears contradictory. This is explained by the fact that
in Uriarte, there was a showing that the petitioner in the probate
proceeding had knowledge prior to filing the testate proceeding that
an intestate proceeding was already pending. In Cuenca, the petition
for probate was filed without knowledge of an existing intestate
proceeding, which was filed just a week earlier.
Extent of jurisdiction of probate court
A probate court acting as such exercises limited jurisdiction.
The said court is primarily concerned with the administration,
liquidation, and distribution of the estate." In fact, the main function
of a probate court is to settle and liquidate the estates of deceased
persons either summarily or through the process of administration.:.
Thus, it hes authority to: (1) determine the heirs, and (2) make a
just and legal distribution of the estate. It is within the jurisdiction
of the probate court to approve the sale of properties of a deceased
person by his prospective heirs before final adjudication; to
determine who are the heirs of the decedent; the recognition of a
natural child; the status of a woman claiming to be the legal wife
of the decedent; the legality of disinheritance of an heir by the
testator; and to poss upon the validity of a waiver of hereditary
rights. Moreover, its jurisdiction extends to matters incidental or
collateral to the settlement and distribution of the estate, such as
the determination of the status of each heir and whether property

deceased spouse."
Along the same track is the ruling in Romero v. Court of
Appeals:"
"In the present case, petitioners assume that the properties
subject of the allegedly illegal sale are conjugal and constitute
part of their share in the estate. To date. there has been no final
inventory of the estate or final order adjudicating the shares o(
the heirs. Thus, only the probate court can competently rule on
whether the properties arc conjugal and form part of tho estate.
It is only the probate court that can liquidate the conjugal
partnership and distribute the same to the heirs, afte r the debts

Pertinent is the following disquisition on the issue of
jurisdiction:
Heir of Ypon v. Ricaforte
G.R. No. 19868, July 8, 2013
FACTS: Magdaleno Ypon (Magdaleno) died intestate,
childless, and leaving certain properties. Gaudioso Ricaforte
(Gaudioso) claimed that he was the sole heir of Magdaleno,
executed an Affidavit of Self-Adjudication, and caused the
cancellation of the titles covering Magdaleno's real properties.
Petitioners, together with their cousins, filed a complaint for
the cancellation of title and reconveyance against Gaudioso. In
hie Answer, Gaudioso alleged that he was Magdaleno's lawful
eon, and claimed that the petitioners were not real-parties-ininterest as there was no showing that they have been declared
as Magdaleno's lawful heirs.
The trial court ruled that while the petitioner had
established their relationship with Magdaleno in a previous
special proceeding, this did not mean that they could already be
considered as his compulsory heirs.
Did the trial court have the authority to determine
Magdaleno's lawful heirs?
HELD: NO. The rule that the determination of a
decedent's lawful heirs should be made in the corresponding

Venue and Proc ess

special proceeding precludes the trial court, in an ordinary
action for cancellation of title and rcconveyancti, from granting
the same. la the case of Heirs of Teofilo Gabatan w. Court of
Appeals, the Court, citing: several other precedents, held that
the determination of who are the decedent's lawful heirs must be
made in the proper special proceeding for such purpose, and not
in an ordinary suit for recovery of ownership and/or possession,
as in this case:
Jurii1prudencc dictates that the determination
of who are the legal heirs of the deceased must be
made in the proper special proceedings in court. and
not in an ordinary suit for recovery of ownership and
possession of property. This must take precedence
over the action for recovery of possession and
ownership. The Court has consistently ruled that the
trial court cannot make a declaration of heirship in
the civil action for the reason that such a declaration
can only be made in a special proceeding. Under
Section 3, Rule 1 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Court,
a civil action is defined as one by which a party
sues another for the enforcement or protection of a
right, or the prevention or redress of a wrong while
a special proceeding is a remedy by which a party
seeks to establish a status, a right, or a particular
fact. It is then decisively clear that the declaration
of heirship can be made only in a special proceeding
inasmuch as the petitioners here are seeking the
establishment of a status or right.
In the more recent case of Milagros ,foaquino u. 1..nurdes
Reyes, the Court reiterated its ruling that matters relating to
the rights of fliation and heirship must be ventilated in the
proper probate court in a special proceeding instituted precisely
for the purpose of determining such rights.

or

By way
exception, the need to institute a separate
special proceeding for the determinntion of heirship may be
dispensed with for the sake of practicality, as when the parties
in the civil case had voluntarily submitted the issue to the trial
court and already presented their evidence regarding the issue
of heirship, and the RTC h!ld consequently rendered judgment
thereon, or when a special proceeding had been instituted hut
had been fnally closed and terminated, and hence, cannot be
reopened.
In this case, none of the foregoing exceptions, or those of
similar nature, appear to exist. Hence, there lies the need to
institute the proper special proceeding in order to determine

17

18

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS
Essentials for Bench and Bar

the heirship of the parties involved, ultimately resulting to the
dismissal of the complaint.
Since a determination of heirship cannot be made in an
ordinary action for recovery of ownership and/or possession, the
dismissal of the complaint was altogether proper. The trial court
erred in ruling on Gaudioso's heirship which should, as herein
discussed, be threshed out end determined in the proper special
proceeding. As such, the foregoing pronouncement should
therefore be devoid of any legal effect.
It bears noting that the case of Heirs of Teofilo Gabatan u.
Court of Appeals cited above made an exception to the rule that a
determination of heirship cannot be made in an ordinary action for
recovery of ownership and possession, thus:
"There appears to be only one parcel of' land being
claimed by the contending parties as their inheritance from
Juan Gabalan. lt would be more practical to dispense with
a separate special proceeding for the determination of'
the status of respondent as the sole heir of' Juan Gaba tan,
specially in light of the fact that the parties to Civil Case No. 89.
092, had voluntarily submitted the issue to the RTC and already
presented their evidence regarding the issue of heirship in these
proceedings.""
Jurisdiction over questions of title to property

As a general rule, however, a probate court cannot adjudicate
or determine title to properties claimed to be a part of the estate and
equally claimed as belonging to outside parties. As an exception,
for the purpose of determining whether a certain property should
or should not be included in the inventory, the probate court may
pass upon the title thereto but such determination is not conclusive
and is subject to the final decision in a separate action regarding
ownership, which may be instituted by the parties.;M
Order of inclusion or exclusion merely provisional and interlocutory

deceased person through the fling of the corresponding proceedings
has supervision and control over the said properties, and under the

said power, it is its inherent duty to see that the inventory submitted
by the administrator appointed by it contains all the properties,
rights, and credits which the law requires the administrator to set
out in his inventory. In compliance with this duty, the court also
has the inherent power to determine what properties, rights, and
credits of the deceased should be included in or excluded from the
inventory. Should an heir or person interested in the properties of a
deceased. person duly call the court's attention to the fact that certain
properties, rights, or credits have been left out in the inventory, it
is likewise the court's duty to hear the observations, with power to
determine if such observations should be attended to or not and if
the properties referred to therein belong prima face to the intestate,
but no such determination is final and ultimate in nature as to the
ownership of the said properties . .)&
Questions of title may be passed on provisionally, but the final
determination of the ownership of the property must be threshed
out in a separate civil action and not in the probate court.

Miguelita's mother, respondent Mimmuela ChuatocoChing, filed an opposition on the rounds that (a) petitioner
is incompetent and unfit to exercise the duties of an administrator; and (b) the bulk of Miguelita's estate is composed of

Petitioner moved to strike out respondent's opposition,

the surv iving spouse, has the preferential right to be appointed
as administrator under the law.

during the proc eedings. The patent rationale for this rule is
that such court exercises special and limited jurisdiction.

Respondent countered that she has direct and material
interest in the estate because she gave half of her inherited
properties to Miguelita on condition that both of them ..would
undertake whatever business endeavor they decided to, in the
capacity of business partners."
In her omnibus motion, respondent nominated her son
Emmanuel Ching to act as special administrator. The intestate
court issued an order appointing petitioner and Emmanuel as
joint regular administrators of the estate.
Consequently, Notice to Creditors was published, but
no claims were filed against the estate. Th ereafter, petitioner
submitted to the intestate court an inventory of Miguelita's
estate. Emmanuel did not submit an inventory.
The intestate court declared petitioner and his two minor
children as the only compulsory heirs of Miguelita. Petitioner
filed an omnibus motion preying, among others. that an Order
be issued directing the partition and distribution of the
estate amo ng the declared heirs.
Respondent opposed petitioner's motion on the ground that
the partition and distribution of the estate is "premature and
precipitate," considering that there is yet no determination
"whether the properties specifed in the inventory are conjugal,
paraphcrnal, or owned in a joint venture." Respondent claimed
that she own s the bulk of Miguelita's estate as an "heir and coThe intestate court denied petitioner's prayer for
partition and distribution of the estate, holding that it is indeed
prema ture, indicating that it will fin>t resolve respondent's
claim of ownership. Petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals a
Petition for Certiorari, which the latter dismissed.
May a trial court, acting as an intestate court, hear and
pas s upon questions of ownership involving properties claimed
to be part of the decedent's estate?
HELD: NO. The general rule is that the jurisdiction of
the trial court either as an intestate or a probate court relates
only to matters having to do with the settlement of the estate
and probate of will of deceased persons but does not extend to
the determination of questions of ownership that arise

A well-recognized deviation to the rule is the principle that
an intestate or a probate court may hear and pass upon questions
of ownership when its purpose is to determine whether or not a
property should be included in the inventory. In such situations,
the adjudication is merely incidental and provisional. Th us, in
Pastor, hr. v. Court of Appea ls, we held:
xx As a rule, the question of ownership is an
extraneous matter which the probate court cannot
resolve with finality. Thus, for the purpose of
determ ining whether a certain property should
or should not be included in the inventory of
estate properties, the probate court may pass
upon the title thereto, but such determination
is provisional, not conclusive, and is subject
to the final decision in a separate action to
resolve title."
The Court of Appeals relied heavily on the above principle
in sustaining the jurisdiction of the intestate court to conduct
a hearing on respondent's claim. Such reliance is misplaced.
Under the said principle, the key consideration is that the
purpos e of the intestate or probate court in hearing and passing
upon questions of ownership is merely to determ ine whether
or not a property should be included in the inventory.
The facts of this case show that such was not the purpose of the
intestate court .
It is apparent that the purpo se of the hearing set by the
intestate court was actually to "determine the propriety of
oppositor's (respondent's) claim." According to the intestate
court, "if it is true that the oppositor (respondent) owns the
bulk of (Miguelita's) properties, 'then it means that she has
a material and direct interest in the estate' and, hence, 'she
should be given her day in court.' " The intended "day in
court" or hearing is geared towards resolving the propriety of
respondent's contention that she is the true own er of the bulk of
Miguelita's estate.
Clearly, the RTC, acting as an intes tate court, had
overstepped its jurisdiction. Its proper course should have
been to maintain a hands-off stance on the matter. It is well.
settled in this jurisdiction, sanctioned and reiterated in a long
line of decisions, that when a question arises as to ownership
of property alleged to be part of the estate of the deceased
person, but claimed by some other person to be his property,

not by virtue of any right of inheritance from the deceased but
by title adverse to that of the deceased and his estate, such
question cannot be determined in the course of an mtestate or
probate proceedings, The intestate or probate court has no
jurisdiction to adjudicate such contentions, which must
be submitted to the court in the exercise of its general
jurisdiction as a regional trial court. Jurisprudence leeches
us that:
"IA) probate court or one in charge of
proceedings whether testate or intestate
cannot adjudicate or determine title to

properties claimed to be a part of the estate
and which are claimed to belong to outside
parties. All that the said court could do us regards
said properties is to determine whether they should
or should not be included in the inventory or list of
properties to be administered by the administrator.
If there is no dispute. well and good. but if there
is, then the parties, the administrator, and the
opposing parties have to resort to an ordinary act1on
for a final determination of the conflicting claims of
title because the probate court cannot do so."
Hence, respondent's recourse is to file a separate action
with a court of general jurisdiction. The intestate court ts ~ot
the appropriate forum for the resolution of her adverse claim
of ownership over properties ostensibly belonging to Miguelita's
estate.
Exceptions to probate court's limited jurisdiction

Notwithstanding the rule that questions of title should be
ventilated in a separate action, the probate court may pass upon the
issue of ownership where the interested parties are the heirs who
have all appeared in the proceeding and rights of third parties are
not impaired." In addition, without prejudice to the rights of third
parties, all the parties may consent to the probate court passing
upon the ownership of a property subject of probate proceedings.

Rule 73- Venue and Process

Aranas v, Mercado
GR. No. 156407, January 12, 2014
FACTS: Emidio S. Mercado (Emigdio) owned shares in
Mervir Realty Corporation (Mervir Realty) and Cebu Emerson
Transportation Corporation (Cebu Emerson). He assigned his
real properties in exchange for stocks in Mervir Realty and
sold his real property in Badian, Cebu (Badian Property) to
Mervir Realty. Emigdio died intestate, survived by his second
wife. Teresita and their five children, and hiR children from his
first wife, including Thelma M. Aranas (Thelma). Teresita was
appointed as administrator. Teresita indicated in her inventory
that at the time of his death, Emigdio "left no real properties but
only personal properties."
Thelma claimed that Emigdio owned properties that were
not included in the inventory. The parties agreed to submit
themselves to the jurisdiction of the court on the issue of what
properties should be included or excluded in the inventory.
Thereafter, the Regional Trial Court ruled that Teresita should
have included in the Badian Property in the inventory.
Did the Regional Trial Court have the authority to order
the inclusion of the Badian Property in the inventory in the
course of the intestate proceedings of Emigdio?
HELD: YES. The usage of the word all in Section 1, Rule
83 demands the inclusion of all the real and personal properties
of the decedent in the inventory. However, the word all is
qualified by the phrase which has come into his possession or
knowledge, which signifies that the properties must be known
to the administrator to belong to the decedent or are in her
possession as the administrator. Section 1 allows no exception,
for the phrase true inventory implies that no properties
appearing to belong to the decedent can be excluded from the
inventory, regardless of their being in the possession of another
person or enllty.
The objective of the Rules of Court in requiring the
inventory and appraisal of the estate of the decedent is "to aid
the court in revising the accounts and determining the liabilities
of the executor or the administrator, and in making a final and
equitable distribution (partition) of the estate and otherwise to
facilitate the administration of the estate." Hence, the RTC ht
presides over the administration of an estate is vested with wide
discretion on the question of what properties should be included
in the inventory. According to Perolta o. Peralta, the Court of
Appeals cannot impose its judgment in order to supplant that of
the RTC on the issue of which properties arc to be included or

23

excluded from the inventory in the absence of positive abuse of
discretion," for in the administration of the estates of deceased
persons, "the judges enjoy ample discretionary powers and the
appellate courts should not interfere with or attempt to replace
the action taken by them, unless it be shown that there has bee n
a positive abuse of dis cretion."

court In making its determination, the Regional Trial Court
acted with circumspection, and proceeded under the guiding
policy that it was best to include all properties in the possession
of the administrator or were known to the administrator to
belong to F.migdio rather than to exclude properties that could
turn out in the end to be actually part of the estate.

There is no dispute that the jurisdiction of the trial court
as an intestate court is special and limited. Th e trial court
cannot adjudicate title to properties claimed to be a part of the
estate but are claimed to belong to third parties by title adverse
to that of the decedent and the estate, not by virtue of any right
of inheritance from the decedent. All that the trial court can
do regarding said properties is to determine whether or not
they should be included in the inventory of properties to be
administered by the administrator.
However, this general rule is subject to exceptions as
justified by expedi ency and convenience.
First, the probate court may provisionally pass upon in
an intestate or a testate proceeding the question of inclusion in,
or exclusion from, the inventory of a piece of property without
prejudice to final determination of ownership in a separate
action. Second, if the interested parties arc all heirs to the
estate. or the question is one of collation or advancement, or the
parties consent to the assumption of jurisdiction by the probate
court and the rights of third part ies arc not impaired, then
the probate court is competent to resolve issues on ownership.
Verily, its jurisdiction extends to matters incidental or
collateral to the settlement and distribution of the estate, such
as the determination of the status of each heir and whether the
property in the inventory is conjugal or exclusive property of the
deceased spouse.
The exchange of shares of stoc k of Mervir Realty with
the real properties own ed by Emigdio would still have to be
inquired into. That Emigdio executed the deed of assignment
two days prior to his death was a circumstance that should
put any interested party on his guard regarding the exchange,
considering that there wus finding about Emigdio having been
sick of cancer of the pancreas at the time. The fact that the
properties were already covered by Torrens titles in the name
of Mervir Renlty could not be a valid basis for immediately
excluding them from the inventory in view of the circumstances
admitted ly surrounding the execution or the deed of assignment.
The determination of which properties should be excluded
from or included in the inventory of estate properties was well
within the authority and discretion of the RTC as an intestate

A more rec ent case reiterates the above doctrine:

active atatu,;. BPI sent a letter to Anita and informed her that
her joint account with Reynaldo would become dormant if no
transaction will be made. As such, Anita decided to withdraw
her funds. Due to the conflict of claims between the heirs and
Ani ta, BPI withheld the release of the funds because of the
contl.icting claims between Anita and respondents. Anita filed
before the trial court a petition for the: (a) settlement of the
Intestate Estate of the late Reynaldo; and (b) issuance of letters
of administration to any competent neutral willing perso n,
other than any of the heirs of Reynaldo. The heirs filed a motion
to dismiss the case.

HELD: NO. Wh ile it may be true that the RTC, acting

probate court, is competent to issue orders involving inclusion or
exclusion of certa in properties in the inventory of the estate of
the decedent, and to adjudge, albeit, provisionally the question
of title over properties, it is no less true that such authority
conferred upon by law and reinforced by jurisprudence, should
be exercised judiciously, with due regard and caution to the
pec uliar circumstances of each individual case.

acco unt; for the intes tate estate of Reynaldo has already bee n
extrajudicially settled by his heirs. The trial court, in this case,
exercised sound judiciousness when it ruled out the inclusion of
the BPI joint account in the estate of the decedent.
Equally importa nt is the rule that the determination of
whether or not a particular matter should be resolved by the
Court of First Instance in the exercise of its general jurisdiction
or of its limited jurisdiction as A special court (probate, land
registration, etc.) is in reality not a jurisdictional question. It
is in essence a procedural question involving a mode of practice
which may be waived."
Such waiver introduces the exception to the general
rule that while the probate court exercises limited
jurisdiction, it may settle questions relating to ownership
when the claimant and all other parties having legal
interest in the property consent, expressly or impliedly,
to the submission of the question to the probate court for
adjudgm ent.
Such waiver was evident from the fact that the respondents
sought for affirmative relief before the court a quo as they
claimed ownership over the funds in the joint account of their
father to the exclusion of his co-depositor. Respondents impliedly
agreed to submit the issue of ownership before the trial court,
acting as an intestate court, when they raised on affirmative
relief before it. To reiterate, the exercise of the trial court of its
limited jurisdiction is not jurisdictional, but procedural; hence,
waivable.

A creditor cannot sue the surviving spouse of a decedent in

against the conjugal property. The proper remedy is for the creditor
to file a claim in the settlement of estate of the decedent. The
rationale behind this policy is that upon death of one spouse, powers

Under the Civil Code, absence of seven years, it being unknown
whether or not the absentee lives, is sufficient for the presumption
of death to arise for all purposes except for succession. An absence
of ten years is necessary for purposes of opening up the absentee's
succession.0 Nevertheless, if the absentee disappeared after the ago
of 75, absence of five years is enough in order that his succession
may be opened.H Absence of four years, however, is adequate for the
presumption of death to arise in the following situations:
(1)

A person on board a vessel lost during a sea voyage, or en
aeroplane which is missing;

(2)

A person in the armed forces who has taken part in war,
and has been missing;

(3)

A person who has been in danger of death under other
circumstances and his existence has not been known for
four years."

If the absentee turns out to be alive, he or she may recover the
balance of one's estate after the payment of all debts. The balance
may be recovered on motion in the same proceedings. A person who
was erroneously declared presumptively dead, either because the
absentee appears or the fact that the absentee is alive is proved, may
recover one's property in the condition it may be found and the price
of the property that may have been alienated or property acquired
with such sums, but the fruits and rents may not be recovered.~

this rule. It shall be presumed that the decedent left
no debts if no creditor files a petition for letters of

of the decedent.
30

Extrajudicial settlement by agreement
In order to afford the decedent's heirs a cost-efficient manner
of settling the estate, the Rules of Court has provided them with the
option of doing so without court intervention. The rationale behind
this provision is that when a person dies without leaving pending
obligations to be paid, the decedent's heirs, whether of age or not,
are not bound to submit the property to a judicial administration
and the appointment of an administrator are superfluous and
unnecessary proceedings.' This, however, does not preclude the
heirs from resorting to judicial settlement of the estate if they do not
desire to resort for good reasons to an ordinary action of partition.
The provision on extrajudicial settlement is not mandatory or
compulsory. In fact, the heirs are given the discretion to pursue
this course of action, provided only that the requisites therefor
are present. Section l allows the heirs to divide the estate among
themselves as they may see fit, or to resort to an ordinary action
of partition, and it does not compel them to do so if they have good
reasons to take a different course of action. t
Section l, Rule 74 provides that in cases where the heirs
disagree as to the partition of the estate and no extrajudicial
settlement is possible, then an ordinary action for partition may
be resorted to.' Where the more expeditious remedy of partition is
available lo the heirs, then the heirs or majority of them may not be
compelled to submit to administration proceedings.
Requisites for extrajudicial settlement
Before the heirs may avail themselves of this provision, the
following requisites must be met:'

(I)

Decedent died intestate;

(2)

There are no outstanding debts at time of settlement;

(3)

Heirs are all of legal age or minors represented by judicial
guardians or legal representatives;

(4)

The settlement is made in a public instrument or by
means of an affidavit, in case of a sole heir, duly filed with
Register of Deeds;

(5)

Publication of the extrajudicial settlement in newspaper
of general circulation in the province once a week for
three consecutive weeks; and

(6)

Fling of a bond equivalent to value of personal property
posted with Register of Deeds.'

In order for the provision on extrajudicial settlement to come
into play, it is indispensable that the decedent left no will. If the
decedent left a will, both substantive and procedural law mandate
that the will be presented and admitted into probate, and the
estate be distributed in accordance with the decedent's wishes. The
heirs cannot disregard the decedent's disposition of one's estate by
resorting to extrajudicial settlement as this is contrary to public
policy. The law enjoins the probate of the will and public policy
requires it, because unless the will is probated and notice thereof
given to the whole world, the right of a person to dispose of his
property by will may be rendered nugatory. Absent legatees and
devisees, or such of them as may have no knowledge of the will,
could be cheated of their inheritance through the collusion of some
of the heirs who might agree to the partition of the estate among
themselves to the exclusion of others. If the decedent left a will and
no debts, and heirs desire to make an extrajudicial partition of the
estate, they must first present the will to the court for probate and
divide the estate in accordance with the will.
In Portugal v. Portugal-Beltran,• the respondent executed an
affidavit of self-adjudication on the mistaken belief that she was the
sole heir of the decedent. The Supreme Court, in a case of annulment
of title initiated by the coheirs, characterized extrajudicial

CHAPTER III -- SUMMARY SETTLEMENT OF ESTATES
Rule 74 Summary Settlement of Estates

settlement of estate as follows: "Rule 74, Section 1 is an exception
to the general rule that when a person dies leaving a property, it
should be judicially administered and the competent court should
appoint a qualified administrator, in the order established in Sec. 6,
Rule 78 in case the deceased left no will, or in case he did, be failed
to name an executor therein."
If the heirs disagree on how they will distribute the decedent's
estate, their remedy would be to file an ordinary action for Partition
in accordance with Rule 69.
As to the second requisite, Section 1 provides for the presumption
that the decedent left no debts. In order for this presumption to arise,
no creditor should have filed a petition for letters of administration
within two years after the decedent's death.
Affidavit of self-adjudication by sole heir
The form of the extrajudicial settlement depends on the number
of heirs. If the decedent left more than one heir, the settlement must
made in a public instrument. If the decedent left only one heir,
it suffices that the heir executes an affidavit of self-adjudication.
The provision is clear that an affidavit of self-adjudication is allowed
only where the decedent left a sole heir. This was clarified by the
Supreme Court in In the Matter of the Intestate Estate of Delgado,'
which involved the estate of Josefa Delgado. Josefa was married to
Guillermo Rustia, with whom she had no children. In the said case,
Guillermo executed an affidavit of self-adjudication upon the death
of his wife. Josefa, however, was also succeeded by her full-blood
siblings as intestate heirs. In annulling Guillermo's affidavit of selfadjudication, the Supreme Court held:

be

"Since Josefa Delgado had heirs other than Guillermo Rustia,
Guillermo could not have validly adjudicated Josefa's estate all to
himself. Rule 74, Section 1 of the Rules of Court is clear. Adjudication
by an heir of the decedent's entire estate to himself by means of an
affidavit is allowed only if he is the sole heir to the estate."

have the right to extrajudicially settle the estate. It would be
incongruous for a person who is not called to the decedent's
succession es an intestate heir to participate and derive any
right from the extrejudicial settlement. 10
Can the heirs enter into an oral partition ofthe decedent's estate
notwithstanding the requisite that the extrajudicial settlement
must be contained in a public instrument? Yes. The Supreme Court
recognized the validity of an oral partition in Vda. de Reyes v. Court
of Appeals.u There is nothing in Section 1, Rule 74 from which it
can be inferred that a written instrument or other formality is an
essential requisite to the validity of the partition. Accordingly, an
oral partition is valid. Likewise, while the rule is unequivocal when
it says that the public instrument or the affidavit ofself-adjudication
must be filed with the Register of Deeds, this is really for the
protection of the heirs. Failure to file the extrajudicial settlement
or the affidavit of self-adjudication does not affect its validity when
there are no creditors or when no rights of creditors are involved. n
In Hernandez u. Andal, 13 the Supreme Court emphatically declared:
"The requirement that a partition be put in a public
document and registered has, in our opinion, for its purpose the
protection of creditors and at the same time the protection of
the heirs themselves against tardy claims. Note that the lost
sentence of the section speaks of debts and creditors. The object
of registration is to serve as constructive notice, and this means
notice to others. It must follow that the intrinsic validity of
partition not executed with the prescribed formalities does not
come into play when, as in this case, there are no creditors or
the rights of creditors are not affected. No rights of creditors
being involved, it is competent for the heirs of an estate to enter
into an agreement for distribution in a manner and upon a plan
different from those provided by law."
Registration, therefore, notifies third parties who wish to
acquire the property that it is subject to an encumbrance of two
(2) years, counted from the date of distribution of the estate to the
heirs."

CHAPTER III--- SUMMARY SETTLEMENT OF ESTATES
Rule 74 Summary Settlement of Estates

It is further required under Section 2 of Rule 74 that the
extrajudicial settlement be published in a newspaper. of general
circulation once a week for three consecutive weeks. Compliance
with the publication requirement does not bind persons who have not
participated in or who had no notice of the cxtrajudicial settlement.16
Extrajudlclal settlement - on whom binding
The procedure outlined in Section 1 of Rule 74 is an ex parte
proceeding. The rule plainly states, however, that persons who did
not participate nor had notice of an extrajudicial settlement will not
be bound thereby. Publication that binds the world contemplates a
notice that has been sent out or issued before any deed of settlement,
partition, or both is agreed upon (i.e., a notice calling all interested
parties to participate in the said deed of extrajudicial settlement
and partition), and not after such an agreement has already been
executed. The publication of the settlement does not constitute
constructive notice to the heirs who had no knowledge or did not take
part in it because the same was notice after the fact of execution. The
requirement of publication is geared for the protection of creditors
and was never intended to deprive heirs of their lawful participation
in the decedent's estate. 18
FIiing of bond
The last requisite for extrajudicial settlement is for the parties
to simultaneously file a bond with and as a condition precedent
to the filing of the public instrument, stipulation in the action for
partition, or of the affidavit of self-adjudication in the office of the
Register of Deeds. The amount of the bond shall be equivalent to the
value of the personal property involved, which shall be certified to
under oath by the parties concerned. 11 It shall be conditioned upon
the payment of any just claim that may be filed under Section 4 of
Rule 74. Bond is required only when personal property is involved
in the extrajudicial settlement. Real estate is subject to lien in favor

G.R. No. 187524, August 5, 2015
FACTS: Pedro L Rioza died intestate, leaving several
heirs, including his children with his first wife. respondents Ma.
Gracia R. Plazo and Ma. Fe Alaras, as well as several properties
includin g a resort, and a family home, and the land on which it
stands.
The heirs filed a Complaint for Judicial Partition with
Annulment of Title and Recovery of Possession. Part icularly,
the complaint alleged: (l) that Pedro died intestate; (2) that
res pondents, together with their coheirs, are all of legal age,
with the exception of one who is represented by a judicial
representative duly authorized for the purpose; (3) that the
heirs enumerated are the only known heirs of Pedro; (4) that
there is an account and description of all real properties left by
Pedr o; (5) that Pedro's estate has no known indebtedness; and
(6) that respondents, as rightful heirs to the decedent's estate,
pray for the partition of the same in accordance with the laws
of intestacy. The petitioner opposed the petition and maintains
that since respondents' complaint alleged the following causes
of action, the same is actually one for settlement of estate and
not of judicial partition.
Is the case an action for settlement of estate and not for judicial

partition?
HELD: The petition is for judicial partition. It is true
that some of respondents' causes of action pertaining to the
properties left behind by the decedent Pedro, his known heirs,
and the nature and extent of their interests thereon, may fall
under an action for settlement of estate. However, a complete
reading of the complaint would readily show that, based on
the nature of the suit, the allegations therein, and the reliefs
prayed for. the action is clearly one for judicial partition with
annulment of title and recovery of possession.

AB can be gleaned from Section 1, Rule 74 of the Rules
of Court, the allegations of respondents in their complaint are
mandatory, to a complaint for partition of real estate. It is clear,
that based on the allegations of the complaint, the case is one for

CHAPTER III - SUMMARY SETTL EMENT OF ESTATES
Rule 74- Summary Settlement of Estates
judicial partition. That the complaint alleged causes of action
identifying the heirs of the decedent, properties of the estate,
and their rights thereto, does not perforce make it an action for
settlement of estate.
The general rule is that when a person dies intestate, or,
if testate, failed to name an executor in his will or the executor
so named is incompetent, or refuses the trust, or fails to furnish
the bond required by the Rules of Court, then the decedent's
estate shall be judicially administered and the competent court
shall appoint a qualified administrator in the order established
in Sec tion 6 of Rule 78 of the Rules of Court. An exception to
this rule, however, is found in Section 1 of Rule 74 wherein
the heirs of a decedent, who left no will and no debts due from
his estate, may divide the est.ate either extrajudicially or in
an ordinary action for partition without submitting the same
for judicial administration nor applying for the appointment
of an administrator by the court. The reason is that where the
dece ased dies without pending obligations, there is no necessity
for the appointment of an administrator to administer the estate
for them and to deprive the real owners of their possession to
which they are immediately entitled.
In this case, it was expressly alleged in the complaint,
and was not disputed , that Pedro died without a will, leaving
his estate without any pending obligations. Thus, contrary
to petitioner's contention, respondents were under no legal
obligation to submit the subject properties of the estate to a
spec ial proceeding for settlement of intestate estate, and are,
in fact, encouraged to have the sam e partitioned, judicially or
extrajudicially.
That the complaint contained allegations inherent in an
action for settlement of estate docs not mean that there was
a prohibited joinder of causes of action for questions as to the
estate's properties as well as a determination of the heirs, their
status as such, and the nature and extent of their titles to the
estate, may also be properly ventilated in partition proc eedings
alone. In fact, a complete inventory of the estate may likewise
be done during the partition proct.-edings, especially since the
estate has no debts. Indeed, where the more expeditious remedy
of partition is available to the heirs. then they may not be
compelled to submit to administration proc eed ings, dispensing
of the risks of delay and of the properties being dissipated.
Moreover, the fact that respondents' complaint also prayed
for the annulment of title and recovery or pos session does not
strip the trial court off of its jurisdiction to hear and decide the
case. Asking for the annulment of certain transfers of property
could very well be achieved in an action for partition, as can be

37

,--38

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS

seen in cases where courts determine the parties' rights arising
from complaints asking not only for the partition of estates but
also for the annulment of titles and recovery of ownership and
[possession of property].
Indeed, an action for partition does not preclude the
settlement of the issue of ownership. In fact, the determination
as to the existence of the same is necessary in the resolution of
an action for partition. The first phase of a partition and/
or accounting suit is taken up with the determination
of whether or not a co-o wnership in fact exists, and a
partition is proper. An action for partition, therefore, is
premised on the existence or non-existence of co.ownership

between the parties. Unless and until the issue of co·ownership
is definitively resolved, it would be premature to effect a
partition of an estate.

Summary settlement of estates of small value
Unlike extrajudicial settlement, summary settlement of estate
may be chosen by the heirs regardless of whether the decedent died
testate or intestate. The following requisites must be present before
the heirs may make use of this provision:

The complaint must allege that the gross value of the
estate of the deceased does not exceed Pl0,000.00;

(2)

A bond has been duly filed in an amount fixed by the

court; and

In connection with Section 1, Rule 73, it was mentioned that
the jurisdiction over estate proceedings depends on the gross value
of the estate in question. By virtue of Section 2, Rule 74, summary
settlement of estates of small value appears to be within the exclusive
jurisdiction of Municipal Trial Courts since the gross value of the
estate must not exceed P10,000.00. In other words, the gross value
of summary settlement of estates shall necessarily fall within the
jurisdiction of the Municipal Trial Courts, which has jurisdiction
over all matters of estate where the gross estate does not exceed
either P300,000.00 or P400,000.00, if within Metro Manila.
Summary settlement of estate may be initiated by the heirs,
creditors, or other interested persons filing a petition with the court.
Thereafter, the petition must be published in a newspaper of general
circulation once a week for three consecutive weeks. Notice must
also be given to other interested persons as may be directed by the
court. It is only after compliance with these publication and notice
requirements tht the court may hear the petition. Specifically, the
hearing on the petition must be held not less than one month nor
more then three months from the date of the Inst publication of the
notice. During the hearing, the court may proceed summarily and
even without the appointment of an executor and administrator.
The court may also admit the will, if there is any, into probate. It

participate in the estate. Once the court determines who are entitled
to participate in the estate, it shall order the payment of debts if
there be any if it finds them due, after which it may apportion and
divide the estate among those entitled thereto. The heirs, in their
own right, who are of lawful age and legal capacity, or by their legal
guardians or trustees legally appointed or qualified. may then be
entitled to receive and enter into possession of the portion of the
estate awarded to them.

Distinction between extrajudicial settlement and summary
settlement of estate of small value

The powers of the court over summary settlement of estate are
not limited to the foregoing. It also has the power to make orders as
may be just with regard to the cost of the proceedings, as well as the
power to order the recording in the office of the clerk all orders and
judgments made or rendered in the course of the hearings. Likewise,
it may order that the same be recorded in the office of the Register
of Deeds when the estate involves real estate.
The Supreme Court has declared that a third person should
not be allowed to claim title and ownership against the decedent in
the summary proceedings:
"The policy of the law is to terminate proceedings for the
settlement of the estate of deceased persons with the least lose
of time. This is [e]specially true with small estates for which
the rules provide precisely a summary procedure dispensing
with the appointment of an administrator together with the
other involved and cumbersome steps ordinarily required
in the determination or the assets or the deceased and the
persons entitled to inhirit [sic] therefrom and the payment of
his obligations. Definitely, the probate court is not the best
forum for the resolution of adverse claims of ownership of any
property ostensibly belonging to the decedent's estate. While
there are settled exceptions to this rule as applied to regular
administration proceedings, it is not proper to delay the
summary settlement of a deceased person just because an heir
or a third person claims that certain properties do not belong
to the estate but to him. Such claim must be ventilated in an
independent action, and the probate court should proceed to the
distribution of the estate, if there are no other legnl obstacles
to it, for after all, such distribution must alway be subject to
the results of the suit. For the protection of the claimant the
approprrnte step is to have the proper annotation of lis pendens
entered."

The distinctions between Sections I and 2 of Rule 74 are as
follows:
Extrajudicial Settlement
t---

Summary Settlement

No court intervention required

Judicial adjudication although
summary

The value of the estate is
immaterial

Gross value of the estate must
not exceed P10,000

Allowed only in intestate suecession

Allowed in both testate and
intestate succession

There must be no outstanding
debts at the time of the
settlement of the estate

Available even if there are
debts: it is the court which will
make provision for its payment

Resorted to at the instance of
and by agreement of all heirs

May be instituted by any
interested party, even a creditor
of the estate without the consent
of all the heirs

Amount of bond is equivalent
to the value of the personal
property

Amount of bond is to be determined by the court

SEC. 3. Bond to be fled by distributee. - The
court, before allowing a partition in accordance
with the provisions of the preceding section, may
require the distributees, if property other than real
is to be distributed, to be file a bond in an amount
to be fixed by court, conditioned for the payment
of any just claim which may be filed under the next
succeeding section.
SEC. 4. Liability of distributees and estate. If it shall appear at any time within two (2) years
after the settlement and distribution of an estate
in accordance with the provisions of either of the
first two sections of this rule, that an heir or other
person has been unduly deprived of his lawful
participation in the estate, such heir or such other

r---42

person may compel the settlement of the estate in
the courts in the manner hereinafter provided for
the purpose of satisfying such lawful participation.
And if within the same time of two (2) years, it shall
appear that there are debts outstanding against
the estate which have not been paid, or that an heir
or other person has been unduly deprived of his
lawful participation payable in money, the court
having jurisdiction of the estate may, by order for
that purpose, after hearing, settle the amount of
such debts or lawful participation and order how
much and in what manner each distributee shall
contribute in the payment thereof, and may issue
execution, if circumstances require, against the
bond provided in the preceding section or against
the real estate belonging to the deceased, or both.
Such bond and such real estate shall remain
charged with a liability to creditors, heirs, or other
persons for the full period of two (2) years after
such distribution, notwithstanding any transfers
or real estate that may have been made.
Under Section 3, it is only when personal property is involved in
the summary settlement of estate that the distributees are required
to file a bond, the amount of which shall be fixed by the court. The
bond is conditioned for the payment of any just claim that may be
filed pursuant to Section 4.
Remedies of aggrieved parties after the extrajudicial or summary
settlement of estate
Section 4 provides for three instances when an heir may be
compelled to settle the decedent's estate in court:
(1)

There has been undue deprivation of lawful participation
on the estate on the part of an heir or other interested
person;

(2)

There exists debts against the estate; or

(3)

There has been undue deprivation of lawful participation
payable in money on the part of an heir or other interested
person.

CHAPTER III -- SUMMARY SETTLEMENT OF ESTATES
Rule 74 Summary Settlement of Estates

43

Thus, an heir or interested person who was able to participate
either in the extrajudicial or summary settlement of estate of
the decedent has a period of two years after the settlement and
distribution to assail its validity. The prescriptive period stated
under Section 4 applies only to persons who participated, took part
in, or had notice of the settlement of, the estate provided under Rule
74. 1~ PersonM who did not participate in the extrajudicial or summary
settlement of estate are not bound by this prescriptive period." It
may be argued that the publication of the extrajudicial settlement
or the petition for the summary settlement of the estate constitutes
notice to the world and thereby precludes claims not initiated within
the two.year period. This argument has been struck down by the
Supreme Court, saying that publication of the settlement docs not
constitute constructive notice to the heirs who had no knowledge
or did not take part in it.1: This is especially true for extrajudicial
settlement, where publication is made after the fact of its execution,
when the heirs had already executed the extrajudicial settlement.
What then is the remedy of an heir who is deprived of one's
share in the estate because one did not participate, take part, or
had no notice of the settlement of estate? An heir may file an action
for reconveyance within 10 years, which is based on an implied
or constructive trust.11 This implied or constructive trust is an
obligation created by law, which an interested person may enforce
within the 10-year prescriptive period.n This prescriptive period
shall commence upon the issuance of a new title over the property in
question," or from the time of actual notice in case of unregistered
deed.
Notwithstanding the alleged existence of fraud in excluding
certain heirs from the settlement of estate, the Supreme Court has
held that the prescriptive period is 10 years, and not four years
counted from discovery, as stated in Gerona v. De Guzman. 'The

Neri v. Heirs of Uy
G.R. No, 194366, October 10, 2012
FACTS: During her lifetime, Anunciacion Neri
(Anunciacion) had seven children, two from her first marriage
with Gonzalo Illut (Gonzalo), namely, Eutropia and Victoria,
and five from her second marriage with Enrique Neri (Enrique),
the petitioners. Throughout the marriage of spouses Enrique
and Anunciacion, they acquired several homestead properties
located in Samal, Davao del Norte (Samal Properties).
When Anunciacion died intestate, Enrique, in his personal
capacity and as natural guardian of some of petitioners
Rosa and Douglas, and the other petitioners, executed an
Extrajudicial Settlement of the Estate with Absolute Deed of
Sale. They adjudicated among themselves the Sama! Properties
and thereafter conveyed them to Spouses Uy. Subsequently,
the petitioners sought the annulment of the sale of the Sama)
Properties as having been sold within the prohibited period.
Eutropia and Victoria joined in the annulment proceed ings
since they were excluded and deprived of their legitimes.
The trial court voided the sale since Eutropia and Victoria
were deprived of their hereditary rights and that Enrique had
no authority to sell the shares of his minor children. However,
the Court of Appeals held that the extrajudicial settlement and
sale were valid and binding as against Enrique and his children.
It further held that it was unconscionable to deprive the Spouses
Uy of their property after 17 years, since Eutropia and Victoria
filed their action more than two years from their knowledge that
they were excluded as heirs.

valid and binding upon them and consequently, a total nullity.
The effect of excluding the heirs in the settlement of estate
was further elucidated in Segura w. Segura, thus:
It is clear that Section l of Rule 74 does not apply to
the partition in question which wu null and void as far as
the plaintiffs were concerned. The rule covers only valid
partitions. The partition in the present case was invalid
beca use it excluded six of the nine heirs who were entitled
to equal shares in the partitioned property. Under the rule
..no extrajudicial settlement shall be binding upon any
person who has not participated therein or had no notice
thereof." As the partition was a total nullity and did not
affect the excluded heirs, it was not correct for the trial
court to hold that their right to challenge the partition had
prescribed after two years from its execution ...
However, while the settlement of the estate is null and void,
the subsequent sale of the subject properties made by Enrique
and his children, Napoleon, Alicia. and Visminda, in favor of
Spouses Uy is valid but only with respect to their proportionate
shares therein. With respect to Rosa and Douglas who were
minors at the time of the execution of the settlement and sale,
their natural guardian and father, Enrique, represented them
in the transaction. However, on the basis of the laws prevailing
at that time, Enrique was merely clothed with powers of
administration and bereft of any authority to dispose of their
2/16 shares in the estate of their mother, Anunciacion. The
disputed sale entered into by Enrique in behalf of his minor
children without the proper judicial authority, unless ratified
by them upon reaching the age of majority, is unenforceable in
accordance with Articles 1317 and 1403(1) of the Civil Cod e.
Reco rds, however. show that Rosa had ratified thf! extrajudicial
settlement of the estate with absolute deed of sale. Considering,
thus, that the extrajudicial settlement with sale is invalid and
therefore, not binding on Eutropia, Victoria, and Douglas, only
the shares of Enrique, Napoleon, Alicia, Visminda, and Rosa in
the homestead properties have effectively been disposed in favor
of Spouses Uy.
On the issue of prescription, the Court agrees with
petitioners that the present action has not presc ribed in so far
as it seeks to annul the extrajudicial settlement of the estate.
Contrary to the ruling of the CA, the prescriptive period of
two years provided in Section l, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court

who were deprived of their lawful participation in the subject

inexistence of a contract does not prescribe" in accordance with

Article 1410 of the Civil Code.
However. the action to recover property held in trust
prescribes after 10 years from the time the cause of Bet.ion

accrues. which is from the time of actual notice in case of
unrcgiste~ deed. In this case, Eutropia, Victoria, and Douglas
claimed to have knowledge of the extrajudicial settlement with
sale after the death of their father, Enrique, in 1994 which
spouses Uy failed to refute. Hence. the complaint filed in 1997
was well within the prescriptive period of 10 years.

An exception carved out by jurisprudence is that an action for
reconveyance is imprescriptible when the plaintiff, the legal owner,
and not the defendant registered owner, is in possession of the land
to be reconveyed.1-1
It must, however, be remembered that reconveyance can no
longer be availed of once the property has passed to an innocent
purchaser for value. The aggrieved heirs may hence sue for damages
against their coheirs who have perpetrated the fraud.29

allegedly excluded some of the heirs, who had no knowledge of,
and thus, did not consent thereto. The remedy resorted to by the

action for annulment of said deed.

annulment of extrajudicial settlement is imprescriptible:

CHAPTER III -- SUMMARY SETTLEMENT OF ESTATES
Rule 74 Summary Settlement of Estates

Bautista u. Bautitrta
G.R. No. 160556, August 3, 2007
FACTS: Teodora Rosario owned a parcel of land in
Pangasinn (the property). She died intestate, leaving behind
her spouse Isidro Bautista (Isidro) and five children, namely:
Teoflo Bautista (Teoflo), Alegrin Bautista (Alegria). Angelica
Bautista (Angelica), Pacita Bautista (Pacita), and Gil Bautista
(Gil). Isidro, Pacita, Gil, Alegria, and Angelica executed a Deed of
Extrajudicial Partition. 'Teofilo was excluded from the partition.
Alegria and Angelica, who, under the Deed of Extrajudicial
Partition, acquired all of the property, sold the same to Pacita
and her common-law husband Pedro Tandoc (Pedro). Pacita,
with Pedro's conformity, later conveyed the property in favor of
Cesar Tamondong, Pedro's nephew.
Teofila thereafter filed a complaint against Alegria,
Angelica, Pedro (by this time, Po.cita was already dead), Priscilla
(wife of his deceased brother, Gil), and Gil's children. Teofila
claimed that he was defrauded and that the sale between Pacita
and Cesar Tamondong was fictitious.
The Court of Appeals ruled that Teoflo's action has
already prescribed.
Has Teoflo's right to nullify the Deed of Extrajudicial Partition
already prescribed?

HEl.D: NO. The Deed of Extrajudicial Partition in the
case at bar being invalid, the action to have it annulled does
not prescribe. Since t.he deed of extrajudicial partition is invalid,
it transmitted no rights to Teoflo's coheirs. Consequently, the
subsequent transfer by Angelica and Alegria of the property to
Pacita and her husband Pedro, as well us the transfer of the
property lo Cesar Tamondong is invalid, hence, conferring no
rights upon the transferees under the principle of nemodat quod
non habet.

are the childre n of Valeriano and Alfora Goyagoy, while Leon cio
is the son of Vicenta and Braulio Goygoy. The res pondents
allegedl y did not know of the demise of their respective parents.
It appeared that the petitioners falsified a document
entitled "Extra-judicial Settlement with Simultaneous Sale
of Portion of Registered Land (Lot 4144) dated December 3,
1967" (the extrajudicial settlement of estate and sale) so that
the respondents were deprived of their shares in Lot No. 4144.
The docu ment purpo rtedl y bore the respondents' signatures,
making them appear to have participated in the execution of the
document when they did not. Th e document ostensibly conveyed
the subject property to Macababbead for the sum of P1,800.00.
Lot No. 4144 was registered in the names of its new owners.
Subsequently, Macababbad regi stered portions of Lot No. 4144
in his name and sold other portions to thir d part ies. Chua filed a
petition for the issuance of a title evidencing his ownership over
a subdivided portion or Lot No. 4144 covering 803.50 square
meters.
Thus, the respondents filed an action for quieting of
title, nullity or titles, re-conveyance, damages and attorney's
fees against the petitioners. Th e trial court dismissed the
complaint beca use there was failure to implead indiitpensable
parties, namely, the other heirs or Pedro and Pantaleona and
the perso ns who have already acquired title to portions of the
subject property in good faith. On appeal, however, the CA
ruled that the respondents' cause of action had not prescribed,
because in assailing the extrajudicial partition as void, the
[respondents] have the right to bring the action unfettered by a
presc riptive period."

Does the issuance of the certificates of titles in the name of
petitioners convert the action to one ofreconveyance oftitled land
which, under settled jurisprudence, prescribes in 10 years?
HELD: NO. Prec edents say it does not; the action
remains imprescri ptible, the issuance of the certificates of titles
notwithstanding. lngjlJII•Tiro is instructive on this point:

Article 1468 of the Civil Cod e provides: "By

obligates himself to trans fer the ownership of end
d eliyer a determinate thing, and the other to pay
to
therefor a price certa in in money or its equivalent.
It is essential that the vendors be the owners or the
property sold otherwise they cannot dispos e that
which does not belong to them. As the Romane put
it: "Nemo dat quod non habet." No one can give

Rule 74 - Summary Settlement of Estates
more than what he hes. The sale or the realty to
respondents is null and void insofar as it prejudiced
petitioners' interests and participation therein.
At best, only the ownership of the shares of Luisa,
Maria, and Gui Iler ma in the disputed property could
have been transferred to respondents.
Consequently, respondents could not have
acquired ownership over the land to the extent
of the shares of petitioners. The issuance of a
certificate of title in their favor could not vest upon
them ownership of the entire property; neither could
it validate the purchase thereof which is null and
void. Registration does not vest title; it is merely the
evidence or such title. Our land registration laws
do not give the holder any better title than what
he actually has. Reing null and void, the sale to
respondents or the petitioners' shares produced no
legal effects whatsoever.
Similarly, the claim that Francisco Injug
died in 1963 but appeared to be a party to the

Extrajudicial Settlement and Confirmation of Sale
executed in 1967 would be fatal to the validity of the
contract, if proved by clear and convincing evidence.
Contracting parties must be juristic entities at the
time of the consummation of the contract. Stated
otherwi se, to form a valid and legal agreement
it is necessary that there he a party capable of
contracting and party capable of being contracted
with. Hence. if any one party to a supposed contract
was already dead at the time of its execution, such
contract is undoubtedly simulated and false and
therefore null and void by reason of its having bee n
made after the death of the party who ppears as
one of the contracting parties therein. The death of a
person terminates contractual capacity.
In actions for reco nveyance of the property
predicated on the fact that the conveyance complained
or was null and void ab initio, a clim of prescription
of action would be unavailing. "The action or defense
for the declaration of the inexistence of a contract
docs not prescribe." Neither could laches be invoked
in the case at bar. Laches is a doctrine in equity and
our courts are basically courts of law and not courts
of equity. Equity, which has bee n aptly described
as "justice outside legality," should be applied only
in the absence of, and never against, statutory law.

Aequetas nunguam contravenit legig. Th e positive
mandate of Article 1410 of the Civil Cod e conferring
imprescriptibility to actions for declaration of the
inexistence of a contract should preempt and prevail
over all abstract argu ments based only on equity.
Certainly, laches cannot be set up to resist the

petitioners can validly vindicate their inheritance

from the allegations that the complainants never intended to part

with the property, as their signatures in the disputed instrument
were forged, such complaint is one for annulment and not merely for
reconveyance." It is, therefore, imprescriptible.

We have a similar ruling in Heirs of Rosa
Du maliang 1,1. Serban.
The respondents' action is therefore imprescriptible and
the CA committed no reversible error in so ruling.
Was the trial court's dismissal of the complaint for failure
to implead indispensable par ties proper?
YES. Rule 3, Section 11 of the Rules of Court provides
that neither misjoinder nor nonjoinder of parties is a gro und for
the dismissal of an action. In an action for reconveyance, all the
owners of the property sought to be recovered are indispensable
parties. Thus, if reconveyance were the only relief prayed for,
impleading petitioners Macababbad and the spouses Chua and
Say would suffi ce. On the other hand, under the claim that
the action is for the declaration of the nullity of extrajudicial
settlement of estate and sale, all of the parties who executed
the same should be impleaded for a complete resolution of the
case. Th is case, however, is not without its twist on the issue of
impleading indispensable parties as the trial court never issued
an order directing their inclusion. Under this legal situation,
particularly in light of Rule 3, Section 11 of the Rules of Court.
there can be no basis for the immediate dismisaa l of the action.

The rulings in Bautista and Macababbad were based on Article
1410 of the Civil Code, which reads:
"Th e action or defense for the declaration of the inexistence
of a contract does not prescribe."

Among the contracts that are inexistent and void from the
beginning under Article 1409 are:
·c2) Those which are absolutely simulated or fictitious."

A ruling on prescription necessarily requires an analysis of the
~ause of action of the plaintiff in a case. Thus, although the word
reconveyance" may appear in the tide of the complaint, but it ia c]ear

ALLOWANCE OF WILL NECESSARY

SEC, 1. Allowance necessary. Conclusive as
to execution. - No will shall pass either real or
personal estate unless it is proved and allowed in
the proper court. Subject to the right of appeal,
such allowance of the will shall be conclusive as to
its due execution.
Kinds of wills
A will has been defined as a species of conveyance whereby
a person is permitted, with the formalities prescribed by law, to
control to a certain degree the disposition of his estate after his
death. Under the Civil Code, there are two kinds of wills which a
testator may execute. The first is the notarial will, which must be
acknowledged before a notary public by a testator and the attesting
witness and is governed by Articles 804 to 809 of the Civil Code.
The second is the holographic will, which Article 810 of the Civil
Code defines as one that is entirely written, dated, and signed by the
testator himself. This kind of will, unlike the ordinary type, requires
no attestation by witnesses. A common requirement in both kinds of
will is that they should be in writing and must have been executed
in a language or dialect known to the testator.'

the testator's intention is lo be ascertained from the words of the
will. taking into consideration the circumstances under which it was
made. Such construction as will sustain and uphold the will i.n all its
parts must be adopted.'
A will is a personal, solemn, revocable, and free act by which a
person disposes of his property, to take effect after his death. Since
the will expresses the manner in which a person intends how his
properties be disposed, the wishes and desires of the testator must be
strictly followed. Thus, a will cannot be the subject of a compromise
agreement which would thereby defeat the very purpose of making
a will.
Allowance of will ls conclusive as to Its due execution
A will is defined as "an act whereby a person is permitted, with
the formalities prescribed by law, to control to a certain degree the
disposition of his estate, to take effect after his death." The probate
of a will is required before its provisions may be carried out. Probate
refers to a judicial act whereby an instrument is adjudged valid and
is ordered to be recorded. It is the statutory method of establishing
the proper execution of an instrument and giving notice of its
contents. Its purpose is to finally and definitively settle all questions
concerning the capacity of the testator and the proper execution and
witnessing of his last will and testament, irrespective of whether its
provisions arc valid and enforceable or otherwise.' Once admitted
into probate, it conclusively establishes against the whole world the
fact that a will was duly executed with the formalities prescribed by
law and that the testator had the capacity to make a will.4
The allowance of a will is only conclusive as to its due execution,
because the authority of the probate court is limited to ascertaining
whether the testator, being of sound mind, freely executed the will
in accordance with the formalities prescribed by law. When the
court determines the due execution of wills, it means that: (1) the
formalities of the law have been complied with, (2) the capacity of
the testator has been established, and (3) the will is genuine, all of

which refer to the extrinsic validity of a will. Thus, the Supreme
Court held that the wife's claim of title to the properties forming part
of her deceased husband's estate should be settled in an ordinary
action before the regular courts,' since these did not refer to the
formal validity of the will.
As a consequence of the allowance of a will, it cannot be
impugned on any of the grounds authorized by law. except that of
fraud, in any separate or independent action or proceeding.
As an exception to the general rule that probate proceedings
are limited to the examination of, and resolution on, the extrinsic
validity of the will, the Supreme Court, in Nuguid v. Nuguid,
passed upon the intrinsic validity of the will subject thereof because
"practical considerations" so demanded.
Probate of will ls mandatory
The law enjoins probate of the will and public policy requires
it. Unless a will is probated and notice given to the whole world, the
right of a person to dispose of his property by will may be rendered
nugatory.9 Consequently, a petition for probate may be filed any
time and the action to admit the decedent's will to probate does not
prescribe. The presentation and probate of a will are requirements
of public policy, being primarily designed to protect the testator's
expressed wishes, which are entitled to respect as a consequence of
the decedent's ownership and right of disposition within legal limits.
Evidence of it is the duty imposed on a custodian of a will to deliver
the same to the Court, and the fine and imprisonment prescribed
for its violation. (Rule 75) It would be a non sequitur to allow public
policy to be evaded on the pretext of estoppel."
A decedent's heirs ere also precluded from disregarding the
provisions of a will and partitioning the estate as they please. When
the decedent leaves a will, the law enjoins its probate. The heirs may
validly partition the estate only after the will has been probated.'

CHAPTER IV - PRODUCTION OF WILL
Production of Will; Allowance of Will Necessary

.

Relevantly, in Union Bank of the Philippines v. Santibanez, the
Supreme Court enunciated:
"It must be stressed that the probate proceeding had
already acquired jurisdiction over all the properties of the
deceased, including the three (3) tractors. To dispose of them
in any way without the probate court's approval is tantamount
to divesting it with jurisdiction which the Court cannot allow
Every act intended to put an end to indivision among co-heirs
and legatees or devisees is deemed to be a partition, although
it should purport to be a sale, an exchange, a compromise, or
any other transaction. Thus, in executing any joint agreement
which appears to be in the nature of an extra-judicial partition,
as in the case at bar, court approval is imperative, and the heirs
cannot just divest the court of its jurisdiction over that part of
the estate."
The requirement of probate is not limited to instruments
designated as wills. For as long as the instrument or document
involves the disposition of estate that takes effect upon death, it
should be presented to the court for probate. In a case, the Supreme
Court declared that a donation mortis causa must comply with the
formalities required for the validity of wills. Even if the donation
did follow the prescribed formalities on the law on wills, it must
still be presented and admitted to probate before rights may arise
therefrom. In this regard, the instrument must have a testamentary
character. This testamentarycharacter refers to either the disposition
of a property or the appointment of an executor. A document that
neither does any of these, even if it follows the solemnities required
for the validity of a will, does not have the requisite testamentary
character that calls into application the rules on probate. To be sure,
an instrument that appoints an executor, but does not provide for
the disposition of the testator's estate, must also be probated. In
this regard, a codicil that revokes a will previously executed must be
probated to effect the revocation. This prevents the probate of a will
that hes been previously revoked by the testator.
Nature of probate proceedings

The probate of a will is a proceeding in rem because it hinds
the whole world by virtue of the publication of the petition. The

probate court's jurisdiction extends to all persons interested in said
will or in the settlement of the estate of the decedent. Publication
is notice to the whole world that the proceeding has for its object to
bar indefinitely all who might be minded to make an objection of any
sort against the right sought to be established, including the State,
It is the publication of such notice that brings in the whole world as
a party in the case and vests the court with jurisdiction to hear and
decide it."
Effect of probate
For a will to take effect, it has to be probated, approved or
allowed in the proper testamentary proceedings. Once allowed,
the principle of res judicata applies, which means that the testator
was of sound and disposing mind at the time when he executed
the will and was not acting under duress, menace, fraud, or undue
influence; that the will was signed by him in the presence of the
required number of witnesses, and that the will is genuine and not
a forgery. Accordingly, these facts cannot again be questioned in a
subsequent proceeding, not even in a criminal action for the forgery
of the will. After the finality of the allowance of a will, the issue as to
the voluntariness of its execution cannot be raised anymore.1~
During probate the court does not look Into Intrinsic validity;
exception
The general rule is that the probate court's authority is limited
only to the extrinsic validity of the will, the due execution thereof,
the testator's testamentary capacity, and the compliance with the
requisites or solemnities prescribed by law. The intrinsic validity
of the will normally comes only after the court has declared that
the will has been duly authenticated. Said court at this stage of the
proceedings is not called upon to rule on the intrinsic validity or
efficacy of the provisions of the will." Any inquiry into the intrinsic
validity or efficacy of the provisions of the will or the legality of any
devise or legacy is premature. u
Probate is one thing; the validity of the testamentary provisions
is another. The first decides the execution of the document and the

testamentary capacity of the testator; the second relates to descent
and distribution."
When a judge looks into the due execution of a will, the inquiry
essentially goes into the testator's voluntariness of making the
dispositions in the will. The testamentary capacity is also examined
on this level, which looks into the soundness of the mind of the
testator. Soundness of mind, in turn, refers to knowledge of three
important considerations: (1) nature of the estate, (2) objects of
bounty, and (3) character of the testamentary act." As to the nature
of the estate, a testator must "have a fairly accurate knowledge of
what he owns,"20 which depends in part on the size of the estate to be
disposed. The second consideration simply means that the testator
"should know under ordinary circumstances who his relatives in the
most proximate degrees are."11 The testator, in making a will, must
know that the document being executed: (a) gratuitously disposes
of one's property, (b) that shall take effect upon death, which is the
very nature of a will. Finally, the extrinsic validity of a will requires
a careful consideration of whether the formalities and solemnities
prescribed by the law have been complied with.
It is only when the probate court has authenticated a will,
and has thus admitted it into probate, that the court looks into
the intrinsic validity of the same - i.e., determining whether the
provisions of the will do not violate any laws. During probate, the
court is not called upon to rule on intrinsic validity or legality of the
provisions of the will.7
Jurisprudence, however, provides for exceptions where
the probate court looked into the intrinsic validity of a will. In
exceptional instances, courts are not powerless to pass upon certain
provisions of will which it may declare invalid even as it upholds
the extrinsic validity of will. When a will is void on face value.
the probate court may disregard passing on the extrinsic validity

of the will for practical considerations." The probate of a will may
become an idle ceremony if it is apparent on the face of the will that
it is intrinsically void. Where practical considerations demand that
the intrinsic validity of the will be passed upon, even before it is
probated, the court should meet the issue.u
In Nuguid v. Nuguid,• the probate court delved into the
intrinsic validity of the will because its single testamentary provision
showed that the testator's parents were preterited. Rosario Nuguid
died single and without issue. She was survived by her parents 1
and six siblings. Remedios, one of Rosario's siblings, presented to
the court Rosario's holographic will. In the will, Rosario instituted r
Remedios as her sole and universal heir to succeed to her property,
which constituted her sole estate. The Supreme Court declared that 1
Rosario's parents were preterited in the will, which had only one
disposition. The result of the annulment of the institution of heirs
was the declaration that the entire will was void considering that it
had only one provision. Had Rosario's will included an institution
of legacies or devises, then those provisions would have remained
valid. However, since Rosario's will contained only the institution
of her sister as her sole heir, the will was declared void. Even if the
probate court was precluded from looking into the intrinsic validity
of the will, to remand the case to the lower court for probate will be
a waste of time, effort, expense, plus added anxiety, since the will
appears to be void on its face.21

in any other manner, and shall, within such period,

Duties of a custodian

A custodian refers to a person who receives a will with
knowledge, or under such circumstances that he ought to have
known that he was receiving custody of a will. The custodian,
by accepting the will, does not undertake to exercise diligence in
inquiring into the testator's death. Mere possession of a will does not
make the holder thereof a custodian of the will. A custodian is chosen
by a testator in advance, and entrusted with the custody of a will
by mutual agreement with the testator. This custodianship creates
a bailor-bailee relationship between the testator and custodian,
the letter being the bailee. The custodian, as bailee, is obligated to
keep and preserve the will safely for the benefit of the testator until
the latter's death. As a consequence, the custodian must keep the
contents of the will inviolate, and must not reveal its contents to
anyone. At any given time, the testator-bailor, however, may order
the custodian to return the will on demand.
A custodian is not obligated to discover whether the testator
is still alive or already dead. It is only when the custodian agrees,
obligates one's self, and represents to another that one was wellequipped to obtain information as to the death of the maker of the
will in his custody, that one must disclose possession of the will and
present it to the court for probate within a reasonable time after the
testator's death.
Upon knowledge of the testator's death, the custodian must
deliver the will either to the clerk of court in the place where the
decedent last resided or to the executor named in the will. The same
obligation is imposed on the executor who is also the custodian of
the will. The reason behind the custodian's obligation to deliver
the will to the court is to ensure discovery of wills and discourage
ts concealment. The failure of a custodian to present the will to
the court. for probate within the period given in the rule, does not
preclude its probate.

The executor named in the will is also given 20 days from

An executor is given the same period to signify to the court in

the nature of a trust is imposed on the executor once one receives
the will.

Whan will may be probated
Ordinarily, probate proc eedings are instituted only after the

the estate of the testator. However, Article 838 of the Civil Code
authorizes the filing of a petition for probate of the will fled by the

viz.:
Mast of the cases that reach the courts involve either
the testamentary capacity of the testator or the formalities
adopted in the execution of wills. There are relatively few cases
concerning the intrinsic validity of testamentary dispositions.
It is far easier for the courts to determine the mental condition
of a testator during hill lifetime than after his death. Fraud,
intimidation and undue influence are minimized. Furthermore,
if a will does not comply with the requirements prescribed by
law, the same may be corrected at once. The probnte during the
testator's life, therefore, will lessen the number of contest upon
wills. Once a will is probated during the lifetime of the testator,
the only questions that may remain for the courts to decide
after the testator's death will refer to the intrinsic validity of
the testamentary dispositions. It is possible, of course, that even
when the testator himself asks for the allowance of the will, he
may be acting under duress or undue influence, but these are
rare cases.
Afte r a will has been probated during the lifetime of the
testator, it does not necessarily mean that he cannot alter or
revoke the same before his death. Should he make a new will,
it would also be allowable on his petition, and if he should die
before he has had a chance to present such petition, the ordinary
probate proc eedi ng after the testator's death would be in order."

Who may file petition for probate
Section 1 enumerates the persons who may petition for the
allowance of the will: executor, devisee, legatee, any other person
interested in the estate, and the testator himself. A devisee or
legatee named in a will need not be a relative of the decedent to
enable such person to file the petition. An interested party allowed
to file a petition for probate is one who would be benefited by the
estate, such as an heir, or one who has a claim against the estate
such as a creditor.' The petition for probate shall prosper regardless
of whether the petitioner bas the will in his possession, is lost, or
destroyed.'

How jurisdiction acquired

The probate court acquires Jurisdiction over the settlement
proceedings in two ways:
(1)

Attachment of a copy of the will to the petition; or

(2)

Delivery of the will to the court.

The original copy of the will need not be attached to the
petition for probate. It is sufficient that a copy thereof is annexed
to the petition since the submission of the original will is not a
jurisdictional requirement. If the will is delivered to the court, it
may, motu propio, take steps to fix time and place for proving the
will and issue corresponding notices.
Man, delivery of wlll sufficient

The use in Section 3 of the disjunctive in the words "when a will
is delivered to, or a petition for the allowance of a will is filed" plainly
indicates that the court may act upon the mere deposit therein of a
decedent's testament, even if no petition for its allowance is as yet
filed. Where the petition for probate is made after the deposit of the
will, the petition is deemed to relate back to the time when the will
was delivered.•
Notice of hearing
The court has to comply with two obligations after the will is
delivered to the court or a petition for its allowance is filed:
(1)

Fix the time and place for proving the will when all
concerned may appear to contest its allowance; and

(2)

Cause the notice of the time and place to be published
for three successive weeks in a newspaper of general
circulation in the province.

Alaban vu. Court of Appeals
G.R. No. 156021, September 23, 2005
FACTS: Respondent Francisco Provido (Francisco) filed
a petition for lhe probnlc of the Last Will and Testament of the
late Soledad Provido Elevencionado (Soledad). Francisco alleged
that he was the heir of the decedent and the executor of her
will. The Regional Trial Court (RTC) Uoilo admitted the will to
probate and issued letters testamentary to Francisco.
More than four months later, petitioners fled a motion
for the reopening of the probate proceedings and opposed the
allowance of the will of the decedent, as well es the issuance
of letters testamentary to respondent, claiming that they ure
the intestate heirs of the decedent. The RTC denied petitioners'
motion. The RTC held that petitioners were deemed notified of

the hearing by publication. Moreover, the RTC's decision was
already final and cxecut.ory even before petitioners' filing of the
motion to reopen.
It appears that one of the petitioners. Dolores M. Flores
(Flores), who is a niece of Soledad, filed a petition for letters of
administration with the RTC of General Santos City, claiming
that Soledad died intestate without any issue, survived by five
groups of collateral heirs. Flores, armed with a Special Power
of Attorney from most of the other petitioners. prayed for her
appointment as administratrix of the estate of the decedent. The
HTC dismissed the petition on the gro und of lack of jurisdiction.
stating that the probate court in Iloilo has jurisdiction since the
venue for a petition for the settlement of the estate of a decedent
is the place where the decedent died.
Were the petitioners notified of the petition for probate of
will?
HELD: YE S. It is the publication of such notice that
brings in the whole world as a party in the case and vests the
court with juri sdiction to hear and decide it. Thus, even though
petitioners were not mentioned in the petition for probate,
they eventually became parties thereto as a consequence of the
publication of the notice of hearing.
According to the Rules of Court, notice is required to be
perso nally given to known heirs, legatees, and devisees of the
testator.
A perusal of the will shows that Francisco was
instituted as the sole heir of Soledad. Petitioners,
as nephews and nieces of the decedent, are neither
compulsory nor testate heirs who are entitled to be
notified of the probate proceedings under the Rules.
Francisco had no legal obligation to mention petitioners
in the petition for probate, or to personally notify them
of the same .
The noninclusion of petitioners' names in the petition and
the alleged failure to personally notify them or the proceedings
do not constitute extrinsic fraud. Petitioners were not denied
their day in court, as they were not prevented from participating
in the proceedings and presenting their case before the probate
court.

If notice is given through personal servi ce the interested
parties must be notified at least 10 days before the hearing. I'
notice is given through registered mail, it should be sent at least 2)

days before the date of the hearing. In addition, the requirement of
publication constitutes as constructive notice that binds the whole
world. A settlement proceeding may be annulled if it is shown that
the notice is not published in accordance with Section 3. On the other
hand, when it is the testator who files the petition for probate, only
the testator's compulsory heirs are notified by the court. In such
case, the publication requirement is dispensed with.
Personal notice under Section 4 of Rule 76 is not a jurisdictional
requirement
Leriou v. Longa
G.R. No, 203923, October 8, 2018
FACTS: Respondent-minors Yohanna and Victoria,
represented by their mother, Mary Jane B. Sta. Cruz,
instituted a spec ial proceeding entitled "In the Matter of the
Intestate Estate of Enrique T Longa Petition for Letters of
Administration." with the RTC in Muntinlupa City alleging that
Enrique died intestate, survived by petitioners Eleptherios and
Stephen and respondents Yohanna and Victoria, his legitimate
and illegitimate children, respectively; and that Enrique left
several properties with no creditors. The RTC issued an Order
appointing Mary Jane B. Sta. Cruz (respondent-administratrix)
as the administratrix of Enrique's estate. The RTC issued
the Letters of Administrator. The petitioners opposed the
appointment. Petitioners aller,ed that they were denied due
process because respondents failed to adduce evidence, i.e.,
Return of Service, tu show that petitioners were furnished
with the Petition for Letters Administration and the RTC
Order dated July 4, 2007. Petitioners assert that the e-mails
between respondent-administratrix and petitioner Elephterios,
and the stamp "RECEIVED" of the DFA Records Division, do
not prove that they actually received the Petition for Letters of
Administration and the HTC Order. Petitioners contend that,
without the mandatory and jurisdictional requirement on notice
lo the known heirs of the decedent, all proceedings before the
RTC relative to the Petition for Letters Administration arc
null and void. On the other hand, the respondents claim that
the petitioners arc disqualified from administering the estate
beca use they are non-residents.
Is personal notice under Section 4of Rule 76a jurisdictional
requirement?
HELD: NO. Contrary to petitioners' argument that
persons! notice under Sec tion 4 of Rule 76 is a jurisdictional

70

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS
Essentials for Bench and Bar
requirement, the Court, in A fa ban v. Court ofAppeals, explained
that it is just a matter of personal convenience. Moreo ver, it

should be emphasized that a testate or intestate settlement
of a deceased's estate is a proceeding in rem, such that the
publication under Section 3 of the same Rule, vests the court

with jurisdiction over all persons who are interested therein.
In the instant case, the court Order was published for three
consecutive weeks in Balita, a newspaper of general circulation.
By such publication which constitutes notice to the whole world,
petitioners are deemed notified about the intestate proceedings

of their father's estate.
The instant case is analogous to Pilapil u. Heirs of
Marimino R. Briones where some of the heirs did not receive
any personal notice about the intestate proceedings, yet they
were deemed notified through publication since the intestate
proceeding is in rem. 'The Court in Pilapil adjudged:
While it is true that since the CFI was not
informed that Maximino still had surviving siblings
and so the court was not able to order that these
siblings be given personal notices of the intestate
proceedings, it should be borne in mind that the
settlement of estate, whether testate or intestate, is
a proceeding in rem, and that the publication in the
newspapers of the filing of the application and of the
date set for the hearing of the same, in the manner
prescribed by law, is a notice to the whole world of
the existence of the proceedings and of the hearing
on the date nd time indicated in the publication.
The publication requirement of the notice in
newspapers is precisely for the purpose of informing
all interested parties in the estate of the deceased
of the existence of the settlement. proceedings, most
especially those who were not named as heirs or
creditors in the petition, regardless of whether such
omission was voluntarily or involuntarily made.
SEC. 5. Proof at hearing. What sufficient in
absence of contest. - At the hearing compliance
with the provisions of the last two preceding
sections must be shown before the introduction of
testimony in support of the will. All such testimony
shall be taken under oath and reduced to writing.
Ifno person appears to contest the allowance of the
will, the court may grant allowance thereof on the

CHAPTER V PROBATE OF WILL
Rule 76 Allowance or Di»allowance of Will

71

testimony of one of the subscribing witnesses only,
if such witness testify that the will was executed as
is required by law.
In the case of a holographic will, it shall be
necessary that at least one witness who knows the
handwriting and signature of the testator explicitly
declare that the will and the signature arc in the
handwriting of the testator. In the absence of any
such competent witness, and if the court deem it
necessary, expert testimony may be resorted to.
The petitioner should present, to the satisfaction of the probate
court, the following:
(1) Evidence that the order of the court fixing the time and
place for proving the will has been published for three
successive weeks prior to the time appointed;
(2) Evidence that a notice of such hearing has been served
upon the known heirs, legatees, devisees of the resident
testator at least 20/10 days prior;
(3) I the petitioner is not the executor, evidence that notice
hes been served upon the executor, if his/her place of
residence is known; and
(4) Testimonies of the subscribing witnesses in support of the
will.
Proof of notice and publication
Before the court proceeds with hearing the petition for probate,
it must be shown that notices were given to the proper parties and
that the petitioner complied with the puhlicntion requirement.
Compliance with the required publication may be proved by
presenting to the court the affidavit. of the publisher and copies
of the actual newspapers on which the notice was published. The
court, however, is not compelled to dismiss the petition for probate
if it fails to require or the petitioner fails to show proof of notice and
publication.
Required testimony
If no one contests the petition for probate, es a general rule, the
testimony of one witness is sufficient for the court to admit the will to
probate. When a notarial will is under probate, the testimony of one

72

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS
Essentials for Bench and Bar

of the witnesses to the will that the substantive requirements were
complied with is sufficient. As to a holographic will, the testimony
of one witness is sufficient as long as the said witness knows the
handwriting and signature of the testator and such witness explicitly
declares that the will is in the handwriting and has the signature of
the testator. The court may resort to expert testimony if there is no
competent person who can testify to the foregoing. However, if the
testator himself petitions for the probate of his holographic will, his
affirmation of the said will and his signature thereon are sufficient
to prove its genuineness and due execution.
SEC. 6. Proofoflost or destroyed will. Certificate
thereupon. - No will shall be proved as a lost or
destroyed will unless the execution and validity of
the same be established and the will is proved to
have been in existence at the time of the death or
the testator. or is shown to have been fraudulently
or accidentally destroyed in the lifetime of the
testator without his knowledge, nor unless its
provisions are clearly and distinctly proved by at
least two (2) credible witnesses. When a lost will is
proved, the provisions thereof must be distinctly
stated and certified by the judge. under the seal
of the court, and the certificate must be filed and
recorded as other wills are filed and recorded.
Proof of lost or destroyed will
A lost or destroyed notarial will may be proved by a photocopy
of the same coupled with the testimony of the subscribing witnesses.
As a rule, the original holographic will must be presented to the
court during the settlement proceedings. The rationale is that if
the holographic will has been lost or destroyed and no other copy
is available, the will cannot be probated because the best and only
evidence is the handwriting of the testator in said will. It is necessary
that there be a comparison between sample handwritten statements
of the testator and the handwritten will. e
However, the Supreme Court, in Bonilla u. Aran.za II ruled that
a photocopy of the testator's holographic will may be presented in

lieu of the original that was lost. Whether the will was a notarial or
a holographic one, its loss or destruction may only be proved upon
the concurrence of the following requisites:
(1)

Its execution and validity are established;

(2)

It must have been in existence at the time of the
testator's death, or is shown to have been fraudulently or
accidentally destroyed during the lifetime of the testator
without his knowledge; and

(3)

Its provisions must be clearly and distinctly proved by at
least two credible witnesses.

When a will is proved as lost, its provisions must be distinctly
stated and certified by the judge under the seal of the court. The
certification must also be filed and recorded in compliance with
Section 13.
SEC, 7. Proof when witnesses do not reside in
province. - If it appears at the time fixed for the
hearing that none of the subscribing witnesses
resides in the province, but that the deposition of
ooe or more of them can be taken elsewhere, the
court may, on motion, direct it to be taken, and
may authorize a photographic copy of the will to
be made and to be presented to the witness on his
examination, who may be asked the same questions
with respect to it and to the handwriting of the
testator and others, as would be pertinent and
competent if the original will were present,
SEC, 8. Proof when witnesses dead or insane or
do not reside in the Philippines. - If it appears at
the time fixed for the hearing that the subscribing
witnesses are dead or insane, or that none of them
resides in the Philippines, the court may admit the
testimony of other witnesses to prove the sanity
of the testator, and the due execution of the will;
and as evidence of the execution of the will, it may
admit proof of the handwriting of the testator and
of the subscribing witnesses, or of any of them.

Testimony of witnesses other than subscribing witnesses
As a rule and with respect to a notaria) will, the courts must
examine the testimony of the subscribing witnesses. The court may,
however, examine witnesses other than the subscribing witnesses in
the following instances:
(1) The subscribing witness is insane;
(2) The subscribing witness is dead; or
(3) None ofthe subscribing witnesses reside in the Philippines.
Where none of the subscribing witnesses reside in the province
where the probate proceeding is pending, the petitioner may file
a motion with the court for the taking of their deposition. When
deposition is resorted to, the court may authorize a photographic
copy of the will to be made and presented to the witness during
the examination. Such witness may be asked questions with respect
to matters pertaining to the will. Deposition may be resorted to if
the deponent lives at least 100 kilometers away from the territorial
jurisdiction of the probate court."
The insanity, death, or non-residence of the subscribing
witnesses in the Philippines shall not prevent the court from
admitting the will into probate as long as the testator's sanity and
the due execution of the will are proved. As long as the petitioner
is able to prove that the testator was sane at the time the will was
executed and the due execution thereof, the court should admit the
will into probate. If the testimony of any of the surviving subscribing
witnesses can be taken, even through deposition, proof of the will by
nonsubscribing witnesses cannot be authorized.
SEC. 10. Contestant to file grounds of contest. Anyone appearing to contest the will must state in
writing his grounds for opposing its allowance, and
serve a copy thereof on the petitioner and other
parties interested in the estate.
Contesting a will
A person may contest the allowance of a will, in which case, the
grounds must be stated in a written opposition. The contestant must
serve a copy of the opposition to the petitioner and other parties
interested in the case.

CHAPTER V PROBATE OF WILL
Rule 76- Allowance or Di»allowance of Will

In order that a person may be allowed to intervene in a probate
proceeding be must have an interest in the estate, or in the will, or
in the property to be affected by it either as executor or as a claimant
of the estate. An interested party has been defined as one who would
be benefited by the estate such as an heir or one who has a claim
against the estate like a creditor."
The reason for the rule excluding strangers from contesting
the will is not to prevent the court from learning facts which would
justify or necessitate a denial of probate, but rather that the courts
and the litigants should not be molested by the intervention in the
proceedings of persons with no interest in the estate which would
entitle them to be heard with relation thereto.
SEC. 11. Subscribing witnesses produced or
accounted for where will contested. - If the will is
contested, all the subscribing witnesses, and the
notary in the case of wills executed under the
Civil Code of the Philippines, if present in the
Philippines, and not insane, must be produced and
examined, and the death, absence, or insanity of any
of them must be satisfactorily shown to the court.
If all or some of such witnesses are present in the
Philippines but outside the province where the will
baa been filed, their deposition must be taken. If
any or all of them testify against the due execution
of the will, or do not remember having attested
to it, or are otherwise of doubtful credibility, the
will may, nevertheless, be allowed if the court is
satisfied from the testimony of other witnesses and
from all the evidence presented that the will was
executed and attested in the manner required by
law.
If a holographic will is contested, the same
shall be allowed if at least three (3) witnesses who
know the handwriting of the testator explicitly
declare that the will and the signature are in the
handwriting of the testator; in the absence of
any competent witness, and if the court deem it
necessary, expert testimony may be resorted to.

CHAPTER V PROBATE OF WILL
Rule 76-- Allowance or Di#allowance of Will

When a notarial will is contested, all the subscribing witnesses,
as well as the notary public who notarized the will, must testify
in the probate proceedings. With respect to a holographic will, at
least three witnesses must testify as to the testator's handwriting
and signature. If the court deems it necessary and in the absence of
any competent witness, the probate court may examine an expert
witness. As an exception, when the testator himself petitions for
the probate of his holographic will, the burden is on the person
contesting the will to disprove its genuineness and due execution.
SEC. 12. Proof where testator petitions for
allowance of holographic will. - Where the testator
himself petitions for the probate of his holographic
will and no contest is filed, the fact that be affirms
that the holographic will and the signature are in
bis own handwriting, shall be sufficient evidence
of the genuineness and due execution thereof. IC
the holographic will is contested, the burden or
disproving the genuineness and due execution
thereof shall be on the contestant. The testator may,
in his turn, present such additional proof as may be
necessary to rebut the evidence for the contestant.
A summary of the required testimonies for purposes of probate
is shown below:

that the instrument should be his will at the time
of fxring his signature thereto.
Dlsallowance of a will
A.11 of the formalities required by the statute arc of equal
importance, and the courts have no discretion to dispense with
them, or supply a defect caused by a failure to comply with some of
them. 18 Parol or extrinsic evidence is not admissible to show that a
decedent intended to execute his will according to all the formalities
prescribed by statute.
Section 9 is a reproduction of Article 839 of the Civil Code. A
will cannot be disallowed for grounds other than those stated above.
As such, if the testator fails to sign and date some of the dispositions
in a holographic will, the result is that these dispositions cannot
be effectuated. Such failure, however, does not render the whole
testament void. In addition, if there are unauthenticated alterations,
cancellations, or insertions made on the date of the holographic will
or on testator's signature, their presence does not invalidate the will
itself. The lack of authentication will only result in disallowance of
such changes."
The grounds for the disallowance of a will are exclusive and
may be categorized into three main groups:
(1)

Noncompliance with the legal formalities required by
law;

(2)

Lack of testamentary capacity; and

(3)

The will was not duly executed.

Formal requisites
The disallowance of a will for failure to comply with the legal
formalities under Section 9(a) refers to those requirements under
Articles 804 to 819 of the Civil Code, viz.:
"Art. 804. Every will must be in writing and executed in a

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS
Essentials for Bench and Bar

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the will has substantially
complied with the requisites for notarial wills, the court may admit it
to probate. Substantial compliance is acceptable where the purpose
of the law has been satisfied, the reason being that the solemnitiea
surrounding the execution of wills are intended to protect the testator
from all kinds of fraud and trickery but are never intended to be so
rigid and inflexible as to destroy the testamentary privilege."
The substantial compliance rule applies only in the absence
of bad faith, forgery, fraud, or undue and improper pressure and
influence. As long as it is proved that the will was in fact executed
and attested in substantial compliance with Article 805, any defect
or imperfection in the form of the attestation or in the language used
shall not invalidate a testamentary privilege.11
AP, to holographic wills, the law only requires the following:
(a)

It must in be writing and executed in the language known
to the testator; and

(b)

The testator himself must entirely write, date, and sign
the will.

Also, under Article 811 of the Civil Code, in the probate of
a holographic will, it shall be necessary that at least one witness
who knows the handwriting and signature of the testator explicitly
declare that the will and the signature are in the handwriting of
the testator. If the will is contested, at least three of such witnesses
shall be required.
This means that no holographic will can be probated, without
the testimony of at least one witness if the will is uncontested, and
at least three witnesses if the same is contested.As the Court

that it is not the object of the law to restrain and curtail the
exercise of the right to make a will.
However, we cannot eliminate the possibility of a false
document being adjudged as the will of the testator, which is
why if the holographic will is contested, that law requires three
witnesses to declare that the will was in the handwriting of the
deceased."
Testamentary capacity

Section 9b) refers to the testator's testamentary capacity to
make a will. The testator's testamentary capacity is determined at
the time the will was executed and no other. Consequently, even if
the testator becomes insane after he executes his will, the insanity
shall not nullify the will. Conversely, a will cannot be validated if
the person who executes a will without testamentary capacity later
gains it.
In Torres v. l.opez, 2~ the Supreme Court defined testamentary
capacity as the capacity to comprehend the nature of the transaction
in which the testator is engaged at the time, to recollect the property
to be disposed of and the persons who would naturally be supposed
to have claims upon the testator, and to comprehend the manner in
which the instrument will distribute his property among the objects
of his bounty. Adopting this definition, Article 799 of the Civil Code
refers to testamentary capacity as the testator's ability to know the
following:
(1)

The nature of the estate to be disposed. of;

(2)

The objects of his bounty; and

(3)

The character of the testamentary act.

Substantive requirements

"In the case of Ajero vs. Court of Appeals, we said that
the object of the solemnities surrounding the execution of
wills is
close the door against bad faith and fraud, to avoid
substitution of wills and testaments and to guaranty their truth
and authenticity. Therefore, the laws on this subject should be
mnterpreted in such a way as to attain these primordial ends.

tes tator be in full possession of all his reasoning faculties, or
that his mind be wholly unbroken, unimpaired, or unshattered
by disease, injury or other cause.

the testator made it during a lucid interval.

Due execution
While testamentary capacity looks into the testator's capacity
to dispose, due execution refers to the testator's voluntariness to
dispose of his estate. If a person is unduly influenced or pressured
to execute a will, there is really no intent to bestow that property.

When a person executes a will that produces effects in the
Philippines, the will must be reprobated in the Philippines to
effectuate its provisions. Otherwise stated, reprobate is a special

Reprobate or reauthentication of a will already probated and
allowed in a foreign country is different from probate of a will, albeit
executed abroad, presented for the first time before a competent
court here. In Palaganas v. Palaganas, it was argued that wills
executed by foreigners abroad must first be probated and allowed in

"G.R. No. 169144, January 26, 201.

the country of its execution before it can be probated here. Finding
no merit in such argument, the Supreme Court explained:
.. But our laws do not prohibit the probate of wills executed
by foreigners abroad although the same have not as yet been
probated and allowed in the countries of their execution. A
foreign will can be given legal effects in our jurisdiction. Article
816 of the Civil Code states that the will of an alien who is
abroad prod uces effect in the Philippines if made in accordance
with the formalities prescribed by the law of the place where he
res ides, or according to the formalities observed in his country.

The rules do not require proof that the foreign will
has already been allowed and probated in the country of its
execution.
Besides, petitioners' stand is fraught with impracticality.
Uthe instituted heirs do not have the means to go abroad for the
probate of the will, it is us good as depriving them outright or
their ir.heritance, since our law requires that no will shall pass
either real or personal property unless the will has been proved
and allowed by the proper court."
SEC. 2. Notice of hearing for allowance, - When
a copy of such will and of the order or decree of
the allowance thereof. both duly authenticated. are
filed with a petition for allowance in the Philippines,
by the executor or other person interested. in the
court having jurisdiction. such court shall fix a time
and place for the hearing, and cause notice thereof
to be given as in case of an original will presented
for allowance.
A petition for allowance of a will that is already admitted
into probate in a foreign country should be accompanied by an
authenticated copy of the will and an authenticated decree of the
allowance. Similar to regular probate proceedings, the petition must
be filed by the executor or other person interested in the court where
he had estate, following Rule 73, Section 1. 'The same procedure fo
the probate of wills is adopted with respect to wills executed in fl
foreign country.
The petitioner must present evidence of the following before
the reprobate of the will:
(1)

Due execution of the will in accordance with the forei
laws;

CHAPTER V_ PROBATE OF WILL

(1)

the Philippines;

(2)

The will has been admitted to probate in such country;

(3)

The fact that the foreign tribunal is a probate court;

(4)

The laws of a foreign country on procedure and allowance
of wills."

A person who seeks to reprobate a will executed in a foreign
country must prove the laws and procedure of that foreign country
on wills. AB foreign laws do not prove themselves and our courts
do not take judicial notice of them, the petitioner in the probate
proceedings has the burden to prove evidence of such foreign law."
Courts will presume that the foreign law is the same as local law
following the doctrine of processual presumption in the absence
of proof of the applicable foreign law. Where a foreign law is not
pleaded or, even if pleaded, is not proved, the presumption is that
the foreign law is the same as Philippine law.11
In accordance with the notice requirement set above, the will
probated abroad should be treated as if it were an "original will.. or
a will that is presented for probate for the first time. Accordingly,
compliance with Sections 3 and 4 of Rule 76, which require
publication and notice by mail or personally to the "known heirs,

and to the executor, if he is not the petitioner, is required.n

the same effect as if originally proved and allowed

and Administration of Estate Thereunder

The following requisite8 must be shown before a will proved
abroad may be allowed in the Philippines:

The domiciliary administrator does not have the power to
administer properties located outside the Philippines by virtue of the
will. The general rule universally recognized is that administration
extends only to the assets of a decedent found within the state or
country where it was granted, so that an administrator appointed
in one state or country has no power over property in another state
or country."
Admission of a foreign will to probate shall have the following
effects:
(1) The court shall grant letters testamentary or letters of
administration with the will annexed;

88

(1)

The testator was domiciled in a foreign country;

(2)

The will has heen admitted to probate in such country;

(3)

The foreign court is, under the laws of said foreign country,
a probate court with jurisdiction over the proceedings;

(4)

Proof of compliance with the law on probate procedure in
said foreign country;

(5)

The legal requirements in said foreign country for the
valid execution of the will have been complied with;

(6)

Filing a petition in the Philippines with copy of the will
and of its decree of allowance; and

(7)

Notice and hearing.

The necessity of presenting evidence on the foreign laws upon
which the probate in the foreign country is based is impelled by the
fact that our courts cannot take judicial notice of them."

(2)

The said letters shall extend only to the testator's estate
located in the Philippines;

(3)

The estate shall be disposed of following the will after just
debts and expenses of administration are paid; and

(4)

Any residue shall be disposed of as provided for estates in
the Philippines belonging to persons who do not reside in
the country.

When the will is allowed, it shall have the same effect as ii
originally proved and allowed in such court.
SEC. 4. Estate, how administered. - When a
will is thus allowed, the court shall grant letters
testamentary, or letters of administration with
the will annexed, and such letters testamentary
or of administration, shall extend to all the estate
of the testator in the Philippines. Such estate,
after the payment of just debts and expenses of
administration, shall he disposed of according to
such will, so far as such will may operate upon it;
and the residue, if any shall be disposed of as is
provided by law in cases ofestates in the Philippines
belonging to persons who are inhabitants of

Executors and administrators
An executor is a person nominated by a testator in his will to
carry out his direction and request thereof and to dispose of the
property according to his testamentary provisions after his death.
An administrator, on the other hand, is a person appointed by
the court of probate to administer and settle intestate estates and
such testate estates where no executor is named, or the executor
named are incompetent, refuses the trust, or fails to give a bond.

92

An executor or administrator occupies a position of trust and
confidence. The law considers them as trustees of the estate and
the funds of the estate as trust funds. As such, they arc required
to exercise reasonable diligence and act in entire good faith in the
performance of that trust. Although the executor and administrator
are not guarantors or insurers of the safety of the estate nor are
they expected to be infallible, yet the same degree of prudence, care,
and judgment which a person of a fair average capacity and ability
exercises in similar transactions of one's own, serves as the standard
by which one's conduct is to be judged.
The provisions in the Rules of Court providing for the
appointment of an administrator where there is no will or the will
does not name an executor seeks to protect not only the estate of
the deceased but also the rights of the creditors in order that they
may be able to collect their credits, and of the heirs and legatees in
order that they may receive the portion of the inheritance or legacy
appertaining to them after all the debts and expenses chargeable
against the deceased's estate have been paid. Under the provisions
of the law, therefore, the judicial administrator is the legal
representative not only of the testate or intestate estate, but also
of the creditors, and heirs and legatees, inasmuch as he represents
their interest in the estate of the deceased.'
Who are Incompetent to become an executor or administrator
Section 1 1ists down the disqualifications of an executor or
administrator. By inference, the requirements for an executor or
administrator are as follows:
(1)

At least 18 years old;

(2)

A resident of the Philippines; and

(3)

The court deems such person as fit.

Minors are disqualified as executors or administrators because
they have no legal capacity to enter into contracts on their own.'
With regard to the residency qualification, it must he noted that
there is no statutory requirement that only residents may be
appointed as executors or administrators of the estate. The Suprer

CHAPTER VI- LETTERS TESTAMENTARY AND OF
93
ADMINISTRATION, EXECUTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
Rule 78- Letters Testamentary and of Administration, When and o Whom Issued

Court explained in Guerrero u. Teran' that the courts, charged with
the responsibilities of protecting the estates of deceased persons,
wards of the estate, etc., will find much diffic:ulty in complying with
this duty by appointing administrators and guardians who are not
personally subject to their jurisdiction. Notwithstanding that there
is no statutory requirement, the courts should not consent to the
appointment of persons as administrators and guardians who are
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of our courts here.
The fitness or unsuitability of a person's appointment as
executor or administrator is within the sound judgment of the court
and will not be interfered with.' The court may consider a person
unfit for the following reasons:
(1)

Drunkenness;

(2)

Improvidence;

(3)

Want of understanding or integrity; or

(4)

Conviction of an offense involving moral turpitude.

The degree of drunkenness that is sufficient to disqualify a
person from being an executor or administrator refers to that degree
which would impair a person's sound judgment and reason that would
necessarily affect the person's integrity and honesty. The second
consideration is improvidence, i.e., unwise or ill-advised spending.
An improvident person lacks the good judgment and foresight
necessary for the fulfillment of the executor and administrator's
responsibilities to manage and preserve the estate. When the rules
speak of lack of understanding, it refers to a person's inability to
know the nature and functions as executor or administrator. On
the other hand, lack of integrity connotes lack of credibility, which
affects his honesty in the management of the estate.
Not all criminal offenses involve moral turpitude. In explaining
crimes that involve moral turpitude, the Supreme Court, in Republic
v. Marcosc iting Villaber v. Commission on Elections," ruled:
As to the meaning of'moral turpitude'we have consistently

man owes his follow men. or to society in general, contrary lo
the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man

In In re Vnzon, the term 'moral turpitude' is considered
as encompassing 'everything which is done contrary to justice,
honesty, or good morals.'

We, however, clarified in Dela Torre vs, Commission
on Elections that 'not every criminal act involves moral
turpitude,' and that 'as to what crime involves moral

turpitude is for the Supreme Court to determine."
The enumeration ofbasis for "unfitness" is not exclusive to those
stated in Section 1. The court may consider other factors that may
show that the person is unfit as executor or administrator. In Lim.
u. Diaz-Millarez, 11 the Supreme Court considered adverse interest
as a ground for disqualification. It ruled that one is considered to be
unsuitable for appointment as administrator when he has adverse
interest of some kind or hostility to those immediately interested in
the estate.

three possible authorities: (1) letters testamentary, (2) letters of

ADMINISTRATION, EXECUTORS AN ADMINISTRATORS
Rule 78- Letter Testamentary and of Administration, When snd to Whom Issued

Essentials for Bench and Bar

The order of the court admitting the will to probate may be
appealed by the party aggrieved by such decision.1' In such case, the
court must still issue the letters testamentary to the person named
as executor. The Supreme Court observed in Ozaeta v. Pecson:u
"Th e choice of his executor is a precious prerogative of a
testator, a nece ssary concomitant of his right to dispose of his
property in the manner he wishes. It is natural that the testator
should desire to appoint one of his confidence. one who can be
trusted to carry out his wishes in the disposal of the estate. The
curtailment of this right may be considered as a curtnilment
of the right to dispose. And as the rights granted by will take
effect from the time of death, the management of his estate
by the administrator of his choice should be made as soon a8
practicable, when no reasonable objection to his assumption of
the trust can be interposed any longer. It has been held that
when a will has been admitted to probate, it jg the duty of the
to issue letters tes tamenta ry to the per son .named
court
executor upon his application- It is the testator that appoints
his executor, as the question as to his peculiar fitness for such
a position or his want of ability to manage the estate cannot be
addressed to the discretion of the county judge."

as

Only if the appointed executor is incompetent, refuses the
trust, or fails to give bond may the court appoint other persons to
administer the estate."
SEC. 5. Where some coexrecutors disqualified
others may act. -- When all of the executors named in
a will cannot act because of incompetency, refusal
to accept the trust, or failure to give bond. on the
part of one or more of them, letters testamentary
may issue to such of them as are competent, accept
and give bond, and they may perform the duties
and discharge the trust required by the will.
The testator is not prohibited from nominating more than one
person as his executor. In such case, the coexecutors exercise joint
administration over the estate. As such, the coexecutors cannot
designate only one of them to administer the testator's estate
because this would be contrary to the testator's wishes.

SEC. 6. When and to whom letters of administration granted. - If no executor is named in the
will, or the executor or executors are incompetent,
refuse the trust. or fail to give bond, or a person
dies intestate, administration shall be granted:
(a) To the surviving husband or wife, as the
case may be, or next of kin, or both. in the discretion
of the court, or to such person as such surviving
husband or wife, or nezt of kin, requests to have
appointed, if competent and willing to serve;
(b) If such surviving husband or wife, as the
case may be, or nezt of kin, or the person selected
by them, be incompetent or unwilling, or if the
husband or widow, or next of kin, neglects for thirty
(30) days after the death of the person to apply for
administration or to request that administration
be granted to some other person, it may be granted
to one or more of the principal creditors, if may be
granted to one or more of the principal creditors, if
competent and willing to serve;

(c) If there is no such creditor competent and
willing to serve, it may be granted to such other
person as the court may select.
Order of preference
Section 6 on the order of preference in appointment as
administrator may be simplified as follows:
(1)

Surviving spouse;

(2)

Next of kin;

(3)

Persons requested by the surviving spouse or next of kin;

(4)

Principal creditors; or

(5)

Other persons selected by the court.

"Malolea II o. Phillps, G.R. N. 1296056, January 31, 2000.

In determining who should be appointed as administrator,

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS
Essentials for Bench and Bar

98

of the one to be appointed as such administrator."" Nevertheless,
the preference established by law is not absolute, if there are other
reasons justifying the appointment of an administrator other than
surviving spouse. If the interest in the estate is what principally
determines the preference in the appointment of an administrator
of the estate of a deceased person, and if, under the circumstances
of each case, it develops that there is another who has more interest
therein than the surviving spouse, the preference established in the
latter's favor becomes untenable."
An "interested party," in estate proceedings, is one who would
be benefited in the estate, such as an heir, or one who has a claim
against the estate, such as a creditor. Also, in estate proceedings,
the phrase "next of kin" refers to those whose relationship with
the decedent is such that they are entitled to share in the estate as
distributees. Thus, in Qu iazo n v. Belen," the Supreme Court held:
In the instant case. Elise, as a compulsory heir who
sta nds to be benefited by the distribution of Eliseo's
estate, is deeme d to be an interested party. With the
overwhelming evidence on record prod uced by Elise to prove
her fliation to Eliseo, the petitioners' pounding on her lack
of interest in the administration of the decedent's estate,
is just a desperate attempt to sway this Court to reverse the
findings of the Court of Appeals. Certainly, the right of Elise

The underlying assumption behind the order of preference

economical administration of the estate, or, on the other hand,
suffer the consequences of waste, improvidence or mismanagement,
have the highest interest and most influential motive to administer

the estate correctly. The order of preference does not rule out the
appointment of co-administrators, especially in cases where justice
and equity demand that opposing parties or factions be represented
in the management of the estate.
The Supreme Court has sanctioned the appointment of more
than one administrator for the benefit of the estate and those
interested therein, viz.: (1) to have the benefits of their judgment
and perhaps at all times to have different interests reprcscnted;21 (2)
where justice and equity demand that opposing parties or factions
be represented in the management of the estate of the deceased;21
(3) where the estate is large, or, from any cause, an intricate and
perplexing one to settle; (4) to have all interested persons satisfied
and the representatives to work in harmony for the best interest of
the estate;2• and (5) when a person entitled to the administration of
an estate desires to have another competent person associated with
him in the office•
When the rules speak of the surviving spouse, it refers to the
partner in the conjugal partnership and the decedent's heir. The
surviving spouse is the preferred administrator precisely because
one is interested in the decedent's estate as the partner in the
conjugal partnership,3As owner of one-halfof the conjugal properties
and at the same time a compulsory heir, it would be unfair if the
surviving spouse be deprived of any hand in the administration of
the deceased-spouse's estate.21 While the surviving spouse is entitled
to preference in the appointment, circumstances might warrant
his rejection and appointment of someone else, at the discretion
of the court. The preference for the surviving spouse assumes that
the marriage to the decedent is valid. If the marriage between the
surviving spouse and decedent is voidable, it does not affect the
preference for the surviving spouse. Where the marriage is void, the

"surviving spouse" cannot be preferred since the very basis for the
preference (i.e., the marital union) is absent.
Meaning of next of kin
Angeles v. Maglayau defines "next of kin" as those who
are entitled, under the statute of distribution, to the decedent's
property; one whose relationship is such that he is entitled to share
in the estate as distributed, or, in short, an heir. In determining the
decedent's "next of kin," the probate court may pass upon the issue of
fliation especially when the application for letters of administration
claims to be the decedent's heir. A separate action will only result in
a multiplicity of suits.
In the case of Ventura v. Ventura,'° the Supreme Court held:

)

In the case at bar, the surviving spouse of the deceased
Gregorio Ventura is Juana Cardona while the next of kin are:
Mercedes and Gregoria Ventura (legitimate children by hie
late wife Paulina Simpliciano) and Maria and Miguel Ventura
(illegitimate children). The "next of kin" has been defined as
those persons who are entitled under the statute of distribution
to the decedent's property. It is generally said that "the nearest
of kin, whose interest in the estate is more preponderant, is
preferred in the choice of administrator." Among members
of a class the strongest ground for preference is the amount
or preponderance of interest. As between next of kin, the
nearest of kin is to be preferred. As the nearest of kin of
Gregorio Ventura, Mercedes and Gregoria Ventura are entitled
to preference over Mara and Miguel Ventura. Hence, under
the aforestated preference provided in Section 6 of Rule 78,
the person or persons to be appointed administrator are Juana
Cardona, as the surviving spouse, or Mercedes and Gregoria
Vent um as nearest of kin, in the discretion of the Court, in order
to represent both intercsts.11
The court may appoint any of the decedent's principal creditors
only when the surviving spouse or next of kin: (1) is incompetent or
unwilling to be appointed, or (2) neglects for at least 30 days after
the decedent's death to apply for administration or to request that
administration be granted to some other person.

Furthermore, the order of preference provided above is limited
to the selection of a regular administrator and does not apply to the
selection of a special administrator. Furthermore, the preference
under Section 6, Rule 78 for the next of kin refers to the appointment
of a regular administrator, and not of a special administrator, as the
appointment of the latter lies entirely in the discretion of the court,
and is not appealable."
RULE 79
OPPOSING ISSUANCE OF LETT ERS TESTAMENTARY. PETITION
AND CONTEST FOR LETTERS OF ADMINISTRATION

SEC. 1. Opposition to issuance of letters
testamentary. Simultaneous petition for administration. - Any person interested in a will may state
in writing the grounds why letters testamentary
should not issue to the persons named therein
as executors. or any of them, and the court, after
hearing upon notice, shall pass upon the sufficiency
of such grounds. A petition may, at the time, be filed
for letters of administration with the will annexed.
The interested person who is allowed to oppose the issuances
of letters testamentary is one who stands to be benefitted such as an
heir, or one who has a claim against the estate, such as a creditor.
The interest must be material And direct and not merely indirect or
contingent." Where the right of the person filing a petition for the
issuance of letters of administration is dependent on a fact which
has not been established or worse, can no longer be established,
such contingent interest does not make her an interested party.Ji It
has been further clarified that the heir who may be interested i.n the
issuance of letters testamentary refers to forced heirs only:
"Ag stated above the appellants in this case re not forced
heirs of the decenscd 11.nd therefore have no right to any part

entitled to intervene in this case and protect their interest in so
far as they may have been prejudiced by the will. It is evident
therefore that they have not been injured or prejudiced in any
manner whatsoever. Only forced heirs whose rights have been
prejudiced hove a right to intervene in a case of this character"
This principle was elucidated in Maloles II • Phillips.
"Even if petitioner is the nearest next of kin of Dr. De
Santos. he cannot be considered an 'heir' of the testator. It is a
fundamental rule of testamentary succession that one who has
no compulsory or forced heirs may dispose of his entire estate by
will. Thus, Art. 842 of the Civil Code provides:
'One who has no compulsory heirs may dispose
by will of all his estate or any part of it in favor of
any person hsving capacity to succeed.
One who has compulsory heirs may dispose
of his estate provided he does not contravene the
provisions of this Code with regard lo the legitimate
of said heirs.'
Compulsory heirs are limited to the testator's
(1)
Legitimate children and descendants, with respect
to their legitimate parents and ascendants;
(2)
In default of the foregoing, legitimate parents
and ascendants, with respect to their legitimate children and

drunkard brother as administrator of their parents' estate. In such
case, even if the minor is disqualified as administrator, he is given
standing to contest the appointment of an incompetent person.
SEC. 2. Contents of petition for letters
of administration. - A petition for letters of
administration must be filed by an interested
person and must show, so far as known to the
petitioner:
(a) The jurisdictional facts;
The names, ages, and residences of
the heirs, and the names and residences of the
creditors, of the decedent;
(b)

(c) The probable value and character of the
property of the estate;

(d) The name of the person for whom letters
of administration are prayed.
(e) But no defect in the petition shall render
void the issuance of letters of administration.
The contents of a petition for letters of administration are
similar to the contents required for a petition for the probate of a
willY The only difference between the contents is the requirement
in a petition for probate that the name of the will's custodian be
stated if the will has not yet been delivered to the court.

. Petitioner, as nephew of the testator, is not a compulsory
heir who may have been preterited in the testator's will."

The jurisdictional facts required in a petition for issuance
of letters of administration are: (1) the death of the testator; (2)
residence at the time of death in the province where the probate
court is located; and (3) if the decedent was a non-resident, the fact
of being a resident of a foreign country and that the decedent has
left an estate in the province where the court is sitting."

The rule does not require that the oppositor be qualified as
administrator. A person may oppose the petition for probate without
simultaneously seeking appointment as administrator. As an
example, an heir who is a minor may oppose the appointment of his

any competent person or person named in the

Publication and notice jurisdictional
Publication and notice through publication of the petition for
the settlement of the estate of a deceased person is jurisdictional,
the absence of which makes court orders affecting other persons,
subsequent to the petition void and subject to annulment, Without
the requisite publication and notice, the court does not acquire
jurisdiction over the subject matter. Therefore, the court has the
following obligations as soon as a petition for letters of administration
is filed:
(1)

Fix the time and place of hearing;

(2)

Cause notice of the time and place of hearing to he given
to:
(a)

Decedent's known heirs;

(b)

Decedent's known creditors; and

(c)

Other persons believed to have interest in the estate.

Following the mandate of Rule 76, Section 3, the notice must
be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the province
where the court has jurisdiction once a week for three consecutive
weeks. Also, under Section 4, notice must be sent either by personal
service or registered mail. There must be notice to "known heirs and
creditors of the decedent, and to any other person believed to have
an interest in the estate" if names and addresses are known.
SEC, 4. Opposition to petition for adminietration. - Any interested person may, by filing a
written opposition, contest the petition on the
ground of the incompetency of the person for
whom letters are prayed therein, or on the ground
of the contestant's own right to the administration,

"De Guzman w. Angeles, G.R. No. 78590, June 20, 1988.

Any person interested in a will may oppose in writing the
issuance of letters testamentary to persons named as executors, and
at the same time file petition for letters of administration with will
annexed.
SEC. 5. Hearing and order for letters to issue.
-- At the hearing of the petition, it must first be
shown that notice has been given as hereinabove
required, and thereafter the court shall bear the
proofs of the parties in support of their respective
allegations, and if satisfied that the decedent left
no will, or that there is no competent and willing
executor, it shall order the issuance of letters of
administration to the party best entitled thereto.
SEC. 6. When letters of administration granted
to any applicant. - Letters of administration may
be granted to any qualified applicant, though it
appears that there arc other competent persons
having better right to the administration, if such
persons fail to appear when notified and claim the
issuance of letters to themselves.
RULE 80
SPECIAL ADMINISTRATOR

SEC, 1. Appointment of special administrator,
- When there is delay in granting letters testamentary or of administration by any cause including

deceased until the questions causing the delay are
decided and executors or administrators appointed.

of the entire estate, with a view to its smooth administration and
speedy settlement. The appointment of a special administrator ia
justified only when there is delay in granting letters testamentary
(in case the decedent leaves behind a will) or administration (in the
event that the decedent leaves behind no will) occasioned by any
cause.41
When appointed, he or she is not regarded as an agent or
representative of the parties suggesting the appointment. The
principal object of the appointment of a temporary administrator ia
to preserve the estate until it can pass to the hands of a person fully
authorized to administer it for the benefit of creditors and heirs,
pursuant to Section 2 of Rule 80 of the Rules of Court. 11
The appointment of a special administrator is within the court's
discretion, but such discretion must be exercised with reason, guided
by the directives of equity, justice, and legal principles." A court is
not required to follow the order of preference prescribed under Rule
78, Section 6 for the appointment of a special administrator. The
preference accorded by the aforementioned provision to the surviving
spouse refers to the appointment of a regular administrator or
administratrix, not to that of a special administrator, and that the
order appointing the latter lies within the discretion of the probate
court." \\-Oile the rule is that the order of preference for a regular
administrator need not be followed in the appointment of a special
administrator, the Supreme Court has recognized that a court may
take into account such principles in the appointment of a special
administrator.

The ruling in Ocampo u. Ocampo is instructive: "Inasmuch
as there was a disagreement as to who should be appointed as
administrator of the estate of Vicente and Maxima, the RTC,
acting as a probate court, deemed it wise to appoint joint special
administrators pending the determination of the person or persons
to whom letters of administration may be issued. The RTC was
justified in doing so considering that such disagreement caused
undue delay in the issuance of letters of administration, pursuant to
Section 1 of Rule 80 of the Rules of Court."

Order appointing special administrator not appealable
The appointment of a special administrator is an interlocutory
or preliminary order to the main case for the grant of letters of
administration in a testateor intestate proceeding."The appointment
or removal of special administrators, being discretionary, is thus
interlocutory and may be assailed through a petition for certiorari
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court."

possession and charge of the goods, chattels, rights,

and maintain suits as administrator. He may sell
only such perishable and other property as the
court orders sold. A special administrator shall not
be liable to pay any debts of the deceased unless so
ordered by the court.
The special administrator's powers are limited
to the following actions:

exercised without grave abuse, higher courts will not interfere with

to make his personal likes and dislikes prevail over, or his passions

standard of responsibility is comparable to that of a bailee." Given
this standard, the executor or administrator must act honestly
and in good faith; otherwise, he becomes personally liable to those

the named executor from giving a bond. In such case, the court may
nevertheless require the executor to give a bond on the condition that
the executor shall pay the decedent's debts. The court also has the
discretion to require the executor to give additional bond whenever
there is a change in his circumstance or in other sufficient cases.

112

The first condition of the bond is for the administrator or
executor to submit a true and complete inventory of the decedent's
properties that shall comprise his estate. The inventory must include
properties in the administrator's physical possession and even
those that come to his knowledge. In other words, for as long as the
administrator has knowledge that a certain property belongs to the
decedent's estate, he must include it in the inventory. It may happen,
however, that another person claims ownership of the decedent's
property. In such a case, the court may provisionally rule on the
title to the property for purposes of its inclusion or exclusion from
the inventory. However the court decides the matter, the decision
shall not be conclusive, because title over property is a subject of a
separate action.

in his will directs that the executors serve without

only to pay the debts of the testator; but the court
may require of the executor a further bond in
case of a change in his circumstance, or for other
sufficient case." with the conditions named in the

As a rule, an executor is required to give a bond conditioned
on one's performance of the obligations enumerated in Section 1. An

RULE 82

CHAPTER VI-- LETTERS TESTAMENTARY AND OF
ADMINISTRATION, EXECUTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
Rule 82 - Revocation of Adaiutraion, Death Hesiuation, and Reoval
of Executors or Administrator

(4)

REVOCATION OF ADMINISTRATION, DEATH, RESIGNATION,
AND REMOVAL OF EXECUTORS OR ADMINISTRATORS
SEC. 1. Administration revoked if will discovered. Proceedings thereupon, - If after letters
of administration have been granted on the estate
of a decedent as if he had died intestate, his will
is proved and allowed by the court, the letters or
administration shall be revoked and all powers
thereunder cease, and the administrator shall
forthwith surrender the letters to the court, and
render his account with such time as the court
directs. Proceeding for the issuance of letters
testamentary or of administration under the will
shall be as hereinbefore provided.
There are two instances when the court may revoke letters of
administration that have already been granted:
(I)

When the decedent's will is discovered and admitted to
probate; and

(2)

When letters of administration are illegally issued or
issued without jurisdiction.

Mere discovery of the decedent's will is not sufficient basis to
revoke the letters of administration. The fact of discovery does not
ipso facto nullify the letters of administration issued by the court
The decedent's will must be probated first before the court may
revoke the letters of administration.
While the second ground for revocation does not appear in
Section 1, it is submitted that where the probate court acts in excess
or without jurisdiction, the letters of administration may be revoked
at any time.
The revocation of the letters of administration produces the
following consequences:
1)

AII powers under the letters of administration cease;

(2)

The administrator shall surrender the letters to the court

(3)

THe administrator must render his account within the!

116

Proceedings for the issuance of letters testamentary or
administration shall follow.

SEC. 2. Court may remove or accept resignation
of executor or administrator. Proceeding upon
death, resignation, or removal. - If an executor or
administrator neglects to render his account and
settle the estate according to law. or to perform an
order or judgment of the court, or a duty expressly
provided by these rules, or absconds. or becomes
insane, or otherwise incapable or insuitable to
discharge the trust, the court may remove him, or
in its discretion, may permit him to resign. When
an executor or administrator dies, resign, or is
removed the remaining executor or administrator
may administer the trust alone. unless the court
grants letters to someone to act with him. If
there is no remaining executor or administrator
administration may be granted to any suitable
person.
Removal or resignation of executor or administrator
While Section l speaks of revocation of the letters of
administration, Section 2 refers to the administrator's removal.
The difference lies in the fact that in Section I, the letters of
administration should not have been issued in the first place. In
essence, letters of administration are revoked for circumstances
or grounds that exist prior to its issuance. Conversely, Section 2
presupposes that letters of administration were lawfully issued, but
for reasons that occur after the letters are issued, there is sufficient
basis to remove the person appointed as administrator.
An administrator may be removed or allowed to resign for the
following grounds:
(1)

Neglect to render one's account and settle the estate
according to law;

(2)

Neglect to perform an order or judgment of the court, or a
duty expressly provided by the Rules of Court;

(3)

Abscond; and

(4)

Becomes insane or otherwise incapable or unsuitable to
discharge the trust.

Suntay III v. Cojuangco-Suntay
G.R. No. 183053, October 10, 2012
FACTS : Cristina Aguinaldo.Suntay (Cristina) died and
was survived by her spouse, Dr. Federico Suntay (Federico), and
five grandchildren: three legitimate grandchildren, including
herein respondent, Isabel; and two illegitimate grandchildren,
including petitioner Emilio III, all by Federico's and Cristina's
only child, Emilio A. Suntay (Emilio D, who predeceased his
parents.
Spouses Federico and Cristina raised Emilio III and
Nenita. Isabel and her siblings, Margarita and Emilio II, lived
with their mother Isabel Cojuangco, following the separation of
Isabel's parents, Emilio I and Isabel Cojuangco.

Rule 82 - Revocation of Adrirsstratou, Death, Resignation, rd Removal

parce ls of land, cash, bank deposits, jewelry, shares of stock,
motor vehicles, and other personal properties, contrary to
Sec tion l, paragraph a, Rule 81 of the Rules of Court.
2.
Emilio III did not take action on both occasions
against Federico's settlement of the decedent's estate which
adjudicated to himself a number of properties proper!y belonging
to said estate (whether wholly or partially), and which contained
a declaration that the decedent did not leave any descendants or
heirs, except for Federico, entitled to succe ed to her estate.

More than three years after Cristina's death, Federico
adopted bis illegitimate grandchildren, Emilio Ill and Nenita.

The general denial made by Emilio Ill does not erase his
unsuitability as administrator roo ted in his failure to "make
and return xxx true and complete inventory which became
proven fact when he actually filed partial inventories before the
probate court and by his inaction on two occasions of Federico's
exclusion of Cristina's other compulsory heirs, herein Isabel and
her siblings, from the list of heirs.

Isabel filed before the Regional Tri al Court (RTC) a
petition for the issuance of letters of administration over
Cristina's estate. Federico opposed the petition and nominated
Emilio III to administer Cristina's estate on his behalf in the
event letters of administration issues Lo Federico. Federico
died during the pendency of the case. The trial court thereafter
rendered a decision appointing Emilio III as administrator of
Cristina's estate.

NJ administrator, Emilio III enters into the office,
posts a bond and executes an oath to faithfully discharge the
duties of settling the decedent's estate with the end in view of
distribution to the heirs, if any. This he failed todo. The foregoing
circumstances of Emilio Ill's omission and inaction become
even more signifi cant and speak volume of his unsuitability as
administrator as it demonstrates his interest adverse to those
immedi ately interested in the estate of the decedent, Cristina.

babel contends that the explicit provisions of Section 6,
Rule 78 of the Rules of Court on the order of preference for the
issuance of letters of administration cannot be ignored and that
Art icle 992 of the Civil Code must be followed. Isabel further
asserts that Emilio III had demonstrated adverse interests and
disloyalty to the estate, thus, he does not deserve to become a
co-administrator thereof.

In this case, palpable from the evidence on reco rd, the
pleadings, and the protracted litigation, is the inescapable fact
that Emilio Ill and respondent Isabel have a deep aversion
for each other. To our mind, it becomes highly impractical,
nay, improbable, for the two to work ns co administrators of
their grandmother's estate. The allegations of Emilio III. the
testimony of Federico and the other witnesses for Federico
and Emilio III that Isabel and her siblings were estranged
from their grandparents further drive home the point tbo.t
Emilio Ill bears hostility towards Isabel. More importantly, it
ppears detrimental to the decedent's estate to appoint a coadministrator (Emilio III) who has shown 1111 ndvcrse interest
of some kind or hostilitv to those. such as herein respondent
Isabel, immediately interested in the said estate.

Was there basis to remove Emilio III as a co-administrator?
HELD: YES. Contrary to the assumption made in the
Decision that Emilio Ill's demonstrable interest in the estate
makes him a suitable co-administrator thereof, the evidence
reveals that Emilio III has turned out to be an unsuitable
administrator of the estate. Respondent Isbel points out that
after Rmilio Ill's appointment as administrator of the subject
estate in 2001, he has not looked after the welfare of the subject
estate and hs actually acted to the damage and prejudice
thereof as evidenced by the following:
1.
Emilio III, despite several orders from the probate
court for a complete inventory, omitted in the partial inventories

for the office of judicial administrator rests. to a great extent, in the
sound judgment of the court exercising the power of appointment
and said judgment is not to be interfered with on appeal unless the
said court is clearly in error.•l The Supreme Court has recognized
the following as sufficient basis to remove an administrator:

relates to the preservation of sufficient assets to answer for the debt,
and the general competence or good faith of the administrator is
necessary to fulfill such purpose."
With respect to resignation, the following steps must be made
before the court may accept the same:

(1)

An administrator who disbursed funds of the estate
without judicial approval,

(1)

The administrator submits a resignation letter to the
court; and

(2)

False representation by an administrator in securing his
appointment,"

(2)

The administrator prepares an inventory of the properties
in his possession.

(3)

An administrator who holds an interest adverse to that
of the estate or by his conduct showing his unfitness to
discharge the trust, and

(4)

An administrator who has the physical inability and
consequent unsuitability to manage the estate."

The removal of an administrator under Section 2 of Rule 82 lies
within the discretion of the court appointing him. The sufficiency
of any ground for removal should thus be determined by the said
court, whose sensibilities are, in the first place, affected by any act
or omission on the part of the administrator not conformable to or
in disregard of the rules or the orders of the court. Consequently,
appellate tribunals are disinclined to interfere with the action taken
by a probate court in the matter of the removal of an executor or
administrator unless positive error or gross abuse of discretion is
shown."
Notably, the grounds enumerated above pertain to the regular
administrator. The probate court has wider latitude in the removal
of a special administrator.
The question now is: who may ask for the removal of an
administrator? While the provision is silent as to who may seek from
the court the removal of the administrator, jurisprudence provides
that a creditor, even a contingent one, would have the personality
to seek such relief. After all, the interest of the creditor in the estate

Rule 83 Inventory and Appraisal Provision for Support of Family

121

The rule obligates the administrator or executor to submit a
true inventory of the decedent's estate within three months from
his appointment. Section 1 of Rule 83 requires the administrator
to return to the court a true inventory and appraisal of all the
real and personal estate of the deceased within three months from
appointment, while Section 8 of Rule 85 requires the administrator
to render an account of his administration within one year from
receipt of the letters testamentary or of administration.:0 The
purpose of the inventory is to aid the court in revising the accounts
and determining the liabilities of the executor or administrator and
in making a final and equitable distribution (partition) of the estate
and otherwise to facilitate the administration of the estate.'1
As discussed earlier, the probate court has authority to
provisionally determine whether a certain property should be
included in the inventory.
While the rule appears to unequivocal that the inventory must
be submitted within three from appointment, such period is not
mandatory."
In the case of Aranas v. Mercado," the probate court, acting
on a motion filed by one of the heirs of the decedent to amend the
inventory of the latter's properties, ordered the administrator to
redo the inventory and to include all the properties of the decedent.
The administrator appealed the order, claiming that some of the
properties of the decedent have already been sold. Upholding the
probate court's order, the Supreme Court held that the usage of the
word "all" in Section 1, Rule 83 means that no properties appearing
to belong to the decedent can be excluded from the inventory. The
fact that the properties were already covered by Torrens titles in
the name of a third person cannot be a valid basis for immediately
excluding certain properties from the inventory. The Torrens system
ls ~ot a mode of acquiring title to lands, as it is merely a system of
registration of titles to lands."

SPECLAL. PROCEEDINGS
Essentials for Bench and Bar

The objective of the Rules in requiring the inventory and
appraisal of the estate of the decedent is to aid the court in revising
the accounts and determining the liabilities of the executor or the
administrator, and in making a final and equitable distribution or
the estate. Absent grave abuse of discretion in the part of the RTC,
the Court of Appeals cannot supplant the former's judgment on
which properties are to be included in the inventory.

CHAPTER VI - LETTERS TESTAMENTARY AND OF
ADMINISTRATION, EXECUTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
Rule 83 Inventory and Appraisal. Provision for Support of Family

123

While Section 3 appears to limit the allowance to the surviving
spouse and minor or incapacitated children, the Supreme Court
has recognized the right of an emancipated child of the decedent to
support:
"While the Rules of Court limit allowances to the widow
and minor or incapacitated children of the deceased, the Civil
Code gives the surviving spouse and his/her children without
distinction. Hence. the private respondents Victor. Rodrigo,
Anselmina and Miguel all surnamed Santero are entitled to
allowances as advances from their shares in the inheritance
from their father Pablo Santero. Since the provision of the Civil
Code, a substantive law, gives the surviving spouse and to the
children the right to receive support during the liquidation of
the estate of the deceased, such right cannot be impaired by
Ruic 83 Sec. 3 of the Rules of Court which is a procedural rule.
Be it noted however that with respect to 'spouse', the same must
be the 'legitimate spouse."""

SEC. 2. Certain articles not to be inventoried.
- The wearing apparel of the surviving husband
or wife and minor children. the marriage bed and
bedding. and such provisions and other articles as
will necessarily be consumed in the subsistence
of the family of the deceased, under the direction
of the court, shall not be considered as assets, nor
administered as such, and shall not be included in
the inventory.
SEC. 3. Allowance to widow and family. - The
widow and minor or incapacitated children of
a deceased person, during the settlement of the
estate, shall receive therefrom, under the direction
of the court, such allowance as are provided by law.
The widow and the minor or incapacitated children of the
decedent are entitled to receive an allowance while the estate
is being settled. These allowances are in the nature of advance
payments of their share in the estate, which shall be deducted from
their respective shares that may be allotted to them. The allowance
does not actually encumber the decedent's property; rather, it refers
to the general estate, which includes the surviving spouse's share
in the conjugal partnership. Consequently, allowance must still
be granted even if the decedent's liabilities exceed the value of the
estate since the allowance actually already refers to the surviving
spouse's share in the conjugal partnership. Nonetheless, allowance
may be denied when the decedent's liabilities exceed the estate's
value where the surviving spouse did not contribute any property
to the marriage. In such case, the surviving spouse and the minor
or incapacitated children cannot be granted an allowance, because
there would be no property left from which their advances may be
deducted after the creditors are paid.

GENERAL POWERS AND DUTIES OF EXECUTORS
AND ADMINISTRATORS

SEC. 1. Executor or administrator to have
access to partnership books and property. How
right enforced. - The executor or administrator of
the estate of a deceased partner shall at all times
have access to, and may examine and take copies
of, books and papers relating to the partnership
business, and may examine and make invoices of
the property belonging to such partnership; and
the surviving partner or partners, on request,
shall exhibit to him all such books, papers, and
property in their hands or control. On the written
application of such executor or administrator, the
court having jurisdiction of the estate may order
any such surviving partner or partners to freely
permit the exercise of the rights, and to exhibit
the hooks. papers, and property, as in this section
provided, and may punish any partner failing to do
so for contempt.
Section 1 refers to the special powers granted the executor
or administrator when the estate involved belongs to a partner.
The provision contemplates that the decedent, during hie lifetime,
was a member of a partnership. Due to the nature of a contract of
partnership, the rules provide for safeguards to protect that deceased
partner's interest in the partnership:
(1)

One shall at all times have access to, and may examine
and take copies of books and papers relating to the
partnership business; and
124

The provision also empowers the court to penalize a partner for
contempt if he fails to follow the court's orders.
SEC. 2. Executor or administrator to keep
buildings in repair. - An executor or administrator
shall maintain in tenantable repair the houses and
other structures and fences belonging to the estate,
and deliver the same in such repair to the heirs or
devisees when directed so to do by the court.
SEC. 3. Executor or administrator to retain
whole estate to pay debts, and to administer estate
not willed. - An executor or administrator shall
have the right to the possession and management
of the real as well as the personal estate of the
deceased so long as it is necessary for the payment
of the debts and the expenses of administration.
The right of an executor or administrator to the possession and
management of the real and personal properties of the deceased is
not absolute and can only be exercised "so long as it is necessary for
the payment of the debts and expenses of administration."

court;
Possess and manage the decedent's real and personal
properties as may be necessary for the payment of debts
and expenses of administration.

Is court intervention required before an executor or
administrator may enter into a lease agreement over the decedent's
estate? Answering this question, the Supreme Court held that
entering into a lease contract is merely an act of administration,
for which no court order is required to render it valid.i The same
rule also applies if the lease agreement exceeds one year.' In San
Diego v. Nombre, the Supreme Court clarified that a court order
is required only if the lease will be registered in the Registry of
Property following Article 1647 of the Civil Code.' The Supreme
Court further explained that the provision requiring agents to secure
a special power of attorney before one may enter into lease contracts
exceeding one year does not apply to an executor or administrator.
While an agent and administrator may have identical duties,
the administrator cannot be considered as the court's agent. The
administrator represents the court as well as the heirs and creditors
of the estate, but an agent. is only answerable to one's principal.

unless by a written instrument filed in the court he
renounces all claim to the compensation provided
by the will.
Expenses and teas allowed the executor or administrator
The Supreme Court observed in De Gala-Sison v. Maddela:
"It must be noted that petitioner is seeking as her
compensation as administratrix an amount greater than that
ordinarily allowed under the rules on the ground that the
estate is large, its settlement 'having been attended with great
difficulty (since 1947 or almost 17 years ago) and required
a high degree of capacity.' In order to entitle the executor or
administrator to additional compensation, the estate must be
large, the settlement extraordinarily difficult, and a high degree
of capacity demonstrated by him. The amount of his fee in special
cases under the Rules is a matter largely in the discretion of the
probate court. which will not be disturbed on appeal, except for
an abuse of discretion."

In De Guzman u. De Guzman-Carillo,1 the expenses of
administration of the estate of the decedent were described by the
Court:
"An executor or administrator is allowed the necessary
expenses in the care, management, and settlement of the estate.
He is entitled to possess and manage the decedent's real and
personal estate as long as it is necessary for the payment of the
debts and the expenses of administration. He is accountable for
the whole decedent's estate which has come into his possession,
with ell the interest, profit, and income thereof, and with the
proceeds of so much of such estate as is sold by him, at the price
at which it was sold (Sec. 3, Rule 84; Secs. 1 and 7, Rule 85,
Rules of Court).
xxx administration expenses should be those which are
necessary for tho management of the estate, for protecting
it against destruction or deterioration, and, possibly, for
the production of fruits. They are expenses entailed for the
preservation and productivity of the estate ond its management
for purposes of liquidation, payment of debts. and distribution of
the residue among the persons entitled thereto."

shall render an account of his administration
within one ()) year from the time of receiving
letters testamentary or of administration, unless
the court otherwise directs because of extensions
of time for presenting claims against. or paying the
debts of, the estate, or for disposing of the estate;
and he shall render such further accounts as the
court may require until the estate is wholly settled.
Section 8 of Rule 85 provides that the "executor or administrator shall render an account of his administration within one (l) year
from the time of receiving letters testamentary or of administration,
and he shall render such further accounts as the court may require
until the estate is wholly settled." As held in one case:
The fact that the executrix received funds of the estate
afte r the approval of her final accounts and before the issuance
of an order finally closing the proceedings is admitted. She must,
therefore, account for the same. in consonance with her duty to
account for all the assets of the decedent's estate which have
come into her poss ession by virtue of her office. An executor
should account for all his receipts and disbursements since his
last accounting."

SEC. 9. Examinations on oath with respect to
account. - The court may examine the executor
or administrator upon oath with respect to every
matter relating to any account rendered by him,
and shall so examine him as to the correctness of his
account before the same is allowed, except when no
objection ls made to the allowance of the account
and its correctness is satisfactorily established by
competent proof. The heirs, legatees, distributees,
and creditors of the estate shall have the same
privilege as the executor or administrator of being
examined on oath on any matter relating to an
administration account.

of the time and place of examining and allowing
the same; and such notice may be given personally
to such persons interested or by advertisement in

directs.
The instances when notice has to be given to interested parties
are provided in: (1) Section 10, Rule 85 in reference to the time

administrator; (2) Section 7(b) of Rule 89 concerning the petition to
authorize the executor or administrator to sell personal estate, or to
sell, mortgage, or otherwise encumber real estates; and (3) Section

requiring presentation is to apprise the administrator and the

timely arrangement may be made for its payment in full or by pro.

upon the death of a person, his entire estate is burdened with the
payment of all of his debts and no creditor shall enjoy any preference
or priority; all of them shall share pro rata in the liquidation of the
estate of the deceased.1
Type of claims that may be flied
Only money claims against the decedent are allowed. under
Rule 86, but not all money claims may be prosecuted under the
said rule: only those contracted before the decedent's death may
be brought under Rule 86. Furthermore, the word "claim" includes
every species of liability which an executor or an administrator of
an estate can be called upon to pay, or provide for payment, out of
the general fund of the estate.' It only has reference to such debts or
demands against the decedent as might have been enforced against
him in his lifetime by personal actions for the recovery of money,
and upon which only a money judgment could have been rendered.'
Claims originating after the decedent's death may he allowed as
expenses of administration,~ but not as money claims under Rule 86.
Such expenses may be collected from the administrator or executor
personally or by motion in the testate or intestate proceedings
without the formality and limitations for money claims against the
decedent."
AJso, claims for taxes, whether assessed before or after the
death of the deceased, can be collected from the heirs even after the
distribution of the properties of the decedent. They are exempted
from the application of the statute of non-claims. The heirs shall be
liable therefor, in proportion to their share in the inheritance.'

With respect to a creditor of the conjugal partnership, the
edy would be to file a claim against the estate of the decedent.
.i.as.a»oreither of the spouses, no complaint for the collection
~debtedness chargeable against the conjugal partnership can
be brought against the surviving spouse. Instead, the claim must
be made in the proceedings for the liquidation and settlement of
the conjugal property. The reason for this is that upon the death of
one spouse, the powers of administration of the surviving spouse
cease and are passed to the administrator appointed by the court
having jurisdiction over the settlement of estate proceedings.
Indeed, the surviving spouse is not even a de facto administrator
such that conveyances made by him of any property belonging to
the partnership prior to the liquidation of the mass of conjugal
partnership property are void.

r

Availing of a writ of execution is an improper remedy for the
payment of debts and expenses of administration. The ordinary
procedure by which to settle claims of indebtedness against the estate
of a deceased person is for the claimant to present a claim before the
probate court so that the court may order the administrator to pay
the amount thereof. The legal basis for such a procedure is the fact
that in the testate or intestate proceedings to settle the estate of a
deceased person, the properties belonging to the estate are under the
jurisdiction of the court and such jurisdiction continues until said
properties have been distributed among the heirs entitled thereto.
During the pendency of the proceedings all the estate is in custodia
legis and the proper procedure is not to allow the sheriff, in case of
the court judgment, to seize the properties but to ask the court for
an order to require the administrator to pay the amount due from
the estate and required to be paid. g
SEC. 2. Time within which claims shall be filed.
- In the notice provided in the preceding section,
the court shall estate the time for the filing of claims
against the estate, which shall not be more than
twelve (12) not less than six (6) months after the
date of the first publication of the notice. However,

entered, on application of a creditor who has failed

to file his claim within the previously limited, the
court may, for cause shown and on such terms as
are equitable, allow such claim to be tiled within a
time not escceding one (1) month.
Time for filing claims; exceptions
The time within which claims may be filed against the estate
are as follows: (a) not more than 12 months, nor (b) less than 6
months, reckoned from the date of the first publication of the notice.
The range of the period specified in the rule is intended to give the
probate court the discretion to fix the period for the filing of claims.
The probate court is permitted by the rule to set the period provided
it is not less than 6 months nor more than 12 months from the
date of the first publication of the notice thereof. Such period, once
fixed by the court, is mandatory. The purpose of the law, in fixing a
period within which claims against an estate must be presented, is
to insure a speedy settlement of the affairs of the deceased person
and the early delivery of the property to the person entitled to the
same."?
It is clear from the foregoing that the period prescribed in the
notice to creditors is not exclusive; that money claims against the
estate may be allowed any time before an order of distribution is
entered, at the discretion of the court for cause and upon such term•
as are equitable.'
Indeed, the period prescribed in the notice is not exclusive."
At any time before the order of distribution is entered, a creditor
who failed to file bis claim within the time set may move to be
allowed to file such claim. The probate court may for good cause
shown and on such terms as arc just allow such claim to be filed
within a period not exceeding one month. However, the one month
extension does not commence from expiration of the original period
for fling claims. It begins from the date of the order of the court
allowing said fling." The probate court's discretion in allowing a
claim after the regular period for filing claims but before entry of an
order of distribution presupposes not only a claim of apparent merit

jut also that cause existed to justify the tardiness in fling the claim.
Under Section 2, Rule 87, the court has no authority to admit a
belated claim for no cause or for an insufficient cause."
Section 2 does not state what cause shall be considered sufficient
for the purpose. Clearly, it is left to the discretion of the court. to
determine the sufficiency thereof; and when the court allows a claim
to be filed for cause or causes which it considers are sufficient, the
appellate court cannot reverse or set aside the action of the court
below unless the latter has abused its discretion."
Statute of non-claims
The statute of non-claims is the period fixed for the filing of
claims against the estate, such that, claims not filed within the said
period are barred forever. The guidelines as to the statute of nonclaims are as follows:
(1)

The period fixed by probate court must not be less than
six months nor more than 12 months from the date of first
publication of the notice.

(2)

Such period once fixed by the court is mandatory and it
cannot be shortened.

(3)

The statute of non-claims supersedes the statute of
limitations.

Even if a claim has not yet prescribed under the statute of
limitations, if such claim is not made with the probate court within
the time set forth in the notice, the creditor may no longer collect
because of the statute of non-claims. In other words, the statute of
non-claims effectively shortens the statute of limitations as regards
the right of action to pursue the debtor is concerned.. Still, before a
creditor may go against the estate, the claim must both he within
the statute of limitations and statute of non-claims. In short, the
statute of limitations and non-claims must both concur before a
creditor may collect against the estate.
There are two exceptions to the statute of non-claims. First, the
creditor may apply with the court for a new period not exceeding one
month from the order allowing the same for just cause in accordance

"1a

138

with Rule 86, Section 2. Second, the creditor may set up his clail!l
as a counterclaim in an action filed by the executor or administrator
against him in accordance with Rule 86, Section 5.
In Danan u. Buencamino," the Supreme Court ruled that a
claim filed two days after the period fixed by the order of the probate
court could still prosper. In deciding in favor of the creditor, the
Court declared that the administratrix was estopped and that laches
had already set in considering that that the issue of the timeliness of
the claim was made after seven years.
Moreover, though presentment of probate claims hi
imperative, it is generally understood that it may be waived by the
estate's representative. And, waiver is to be determined from the
administrator's "acts and conduct." Certainly, the administrator's
failure to plead the statute of non-claims, his active participation,
and resistance to plaintiffs claim, in the civil suit, amount to such
waiver.''
SEC. 3. Publication of notice to creditors. Every executor or administrator shall, immediately
after the notice to creditors is issued, cause the
same to be published three (3) weeks successively in
a newspaper of general circulation in the province,
and to be posted for the same period in four public
places in the province and in two public places in
the municipality where the decedent last resided.
Immediately after the notice to the creditors is issued, the
executor or administrator shall cause the following:
(1)

Publication of the notice three weeks successively in a
newspaper of general circulation in the province; and

(2)

Posting of the notice for three weeks successively in the
following places:
(a)

Four public places in the province; and

(b)

Two public places in the municipality where the
decedent last resided.

139

Publication amounts to constructive notice and is binding
against the whole world. Consequently, a creditor cannot be
Emitted to file his claim beyond the period fixed in the notice
: the ground that he had no knowledge of the admimatrat1on
proceedings."
SEC. 4. Filing of copy ofprinted notice. - Within
ten (10) days after the notice has been published
and posted in accordance with the preceding
section. the executor or administrator shall file or
cause to be filed in the court a printed copy of the
notice accompanied with an affidavit setting forth
the dates of the first and last publication thereof
and the name of the newspaper in which the same
is printed.
A copy of the printed notice must be filed with the court
within 10 days after publication and posting. Aside from the actual
printed copy, the affidavit of the published must also be submitted,
setting forth the dates of the first and last publication, as well as
the newspaper on which it was printed. The rationale behind this
provision is to inform the creditors as well as the courts that the
notice requirement has been duly followed.
SEC. 6. Claims which must be filed under

claims for money against the decent, arising from
contract, express or implied. whether the same be
due. not due, or contingent, all claims for funeral

of presenting them independently to the court as

judgment is rendered in favor of the defendant,
the amount so determined shall be considered the
true balance against the estate, as though the claim
had been presented directly before the court in the
administration proceedings. Claims not yet due, or
contingent, may be approved at their present value.
Claims to file within the period
The following claims must be filed within the period stated in
the notice:
(1)

Claims for money against the decedent arising from
contract, express or implied, whether due, not due or
contingent

(2)

Claims for funeral expenses and expenses for last sickness
of decedent

(3)

Judgment for money against decedent

The judgment referred to above must be presented as a claim
against the estate where the judgment debtor dies before levy on
execution of his properties.e When the action is for recovery of
money arising from contract, and defendant dies before entry of final
judgment, it shall not be dismissed but shall be allowed to continue
until entry of final judgment. A favorable judgment obtained by
plaintiff shall be enforced under Rule 86.10

Mone y claims against Iha decedent
Section 5 of Rule 86 expressly allows the prosecution of money
claims arising from a contract against the estate of a deceased
debtor. In point is the following case:
Stronghold Insurance Company, Inc. v.
Republic-Asahi Glass Corporation
G.R. No. 147561, June 22, 2006
FACTS: On May 24, 1989, Republic-Asa hi Glass Corporation (Republic-Asahi) entered into a contract with Jose D.
Santos, Jr., the proprietor of ,JDS Construction (JDS), for
the construction of roadways and a drainage system where
Republic-Asahiwas to pay JDS P5,300,000.00. In order to
guarantee the performance of its undertakings, JDS posted a
performance bond, which JDS executed, jointly and severally
with Stro nghold Insurance Co., Inc. (SICI).
Dissatisfied with the progress of the work underta ken by
JDS, Republic-Asahi extrajudicially rescinded the contract. Such
rescission, according to Art icle XV of the contract shall not be
construed as a waiver of [respondents') right to recover damages
from JDS and the latter's sureties. Thereafter, Republic-Asahi
sent a letter to SICI filing its claim under the bond. Republic
then filed a complaint against JDS and SICI. The Sheriff was
not able to serve summons on Jose D. Santos, Jr. since he was
already dead.
SICI claimed that Republic-Asahi's money claim s against
it and JDS have bee n extinguished by the death of Jose D.
Santos, Jr.
Was SICI's obligation extingu ished by dose D. Santos, Jr.'s
death ?

Moreover, the probate court cannot order the payment oC
money without a claim filed with it. Legally speaking, the allowance
of the claim would be like rendering a judgment without the filing of
a complaint, or even the making or presentment of a claim."

HELD: NO. As a general rule, the death of either the
creditor or the debtor does not extinguish the obligation.
Obligations are transmissible to the heirs, except when the
transmission is prevented by the law, the stipulations of the
parties, or the nature of the obligation. Only obligations that
are perso nal or are identified with the persons themselves are
extinguished by death.

SCRA ;~ua 1elista ti. La l"rollttdora, Inc., G.R. No. L-32824, March 31, 1971, 38

Section 5 of Rule 86 or the Rules of Court expres sly allows
the prosecution of money claims arising from a contract against
the estate of a deceased debtor. Evidently, those claims are not
actually extinguished. Wh at is extinguished is only the obligee's
action or suit filed before the court, which is not then acting as
a probate court .

Essentials for Bench and Bar

In the present case. whatever monetary liabilities or
obligations Santos had under his contracts with respondent
were not intransmissible by their nature, by stipulation,
or by provision of law. Hence, his death did not result in the
extinguishment of those obligations or liabilities. which merely
passed on Lo his estate. Death is not a defense that he or his estate
can set up to wipe out the obligations under the performance
bond. Consequently, petitioner as surety cannot use his death
to escape its monetary obligation under its performance bond.
Claims must be made within the time prescribed in the notice,
otherwise, they arc barred forever. The exception to this rule is
when the claim is setup as a counterclaim in an action brought by
the executor or administrator of the estate. The law imposes a time
limit. for the filing of the claims for the following reasons:
(1)

To protect the estate of the deceased by informing the
executor or administrator of the claims against it, thus
enabling him to examine each claim and to determine
whether it is a proper one which should be allowed;

(2)

For the speedy settlement of affairs of deceased; and

(3)

The early delivery of property to distributes, legatees, or
heirs.

A money claim against an estate is more akin to a motion for
creditors' claims to be recognized and taken into consideration in
the proper disposition of the properties of the estate. A money claim
is only an incidental matter in the main action for the settlement
of the decedent's estate; more so if the claim is contingent since
the claimant cannot even institute a separate action for a mere
contingent claim. Hence, a contingent money claim, not being an
initiatory pleading, does not require a certification against non·
forum shopping."
To reiterate, only money claims may be filed against the estate,
but not nil money claims may be pursued. Only the money claims
based on liabilities that arose before the decedent's death may be
claimed. By way of exception, funeral expenses and expenses for the
decedent's last illness may be claimed against the estate. In this

regard, expenses incurred after the decedent's death may be claimed
as expenses of admm1stratlon.
Ordinary action for collection not allowed
In Nacar u. Nistal, Justice Vasquez, in his concurring opinion,
aptly observed:
The fundamental error committed by the private
respondents was in pursuing their claim in an ordinary action,
and that by the respondent municipal judge in entertaining the
same.
As can be seen from the caption and the body of the
complaint filed in Civil Case No. 66, the claim of the private
respondents was not against herein petitioner Nicanor Nacar
but against the estate of the deceased Isabelo Nacar. It is a
claim for money arising from unpaid indebtedness granted on
various dates. Isabelo Nacar died before the said complaint was
filed. It docs not appear that any proceeding has been filed to
settle his estate.
Under these facts, the filing of an ordinary action to
recover said claim is not allowed in any court. Even if settlement
proceedings hod been taken to settle the estate of Isabelo Nacar,
the suit to recover the claim of the private respondents may not
be filed against the administrator or executor of his estate. This
is expressly provided for in Section 1 of Rule 87 of the Rules of
Court, as follows:
No action upon a claim for the recovery of money or debt
or interest thereon shall be commenced against the executor or
administrator;
The claim of private respondents, being one arising
from a contract, may be pursued only by filing the same in the
administration proceedings that may be taken to settle the
estate of the deceased Isbelo Nacar If such a proceeding is
instituted and the subject claim is not filed therein within the
period prescribed, the same shall be deemed 'barred forever.'
Even if this action were commenced during the lifetime of
Isabelo Nacar, the same shall have to be dismissed. and the
claim prosecuted in the proper dministration proceedings.""

Essentials for Bench and Dar
Contingent claims
Contingent claims refer to those claims in which liability
depends on some future event that may or may not happen, and
which makes it uncertain whether there will ever be any liability.
The expression is used in contradistinction to an absolute claim
which is subject to no contingency and may be proved and allowed~
a debt by the committee of claims. The absolute claim is such a claim
as, if contested between living persons, would be the proper subject
of immediate legal action and would supply a basis of a judgment for
a sum certain.
A contingent claim does not follow the temporary orders of
dismissal of an action upon which it is based; it awaits the final
outcome thereof and only said final result can cause its termination.
The rules provide that a contingent claim is to be presented in the
administration proceedings in the same manner as any ordinary
claim, and that when the contingency arises which converts the
contingent claim into a valid claim, the court should then be informed
that the claim had already matured. Thus, in Btlan u. Layo,._ the
Court held that whether or not the heirs of the deceased, Juan C.

mplled contract
The term "implied contract" is used in the common law sense
and includes those arising from ex Lege or quasi-contract, such as
for the return of goods from the person to whom the goods were
mistakenly delivered, who thus becomes a debtor in favor of the true
owner who is a creditor, under an implied contract.
Metropolitan Bank & Trust Company v. Absolute
Management Corporation
G.R. No. 170498, January 9, 2013
FACTS: Sherwood Holdings Corporation, Inc. (SHCD fled
a complaint for sum of money against Absolute Management
Corporation (A.!\-1'.C). SHCI alleged that it made advance
payments to AMC for the purchase of pieces of plywood and
plyboards, covered by Metrobank checks. These checks were all
crossed, and were all made payable to AMC. They were given to
Chua, AMC's General Manager.
Chua died in 1999, and a special proceeding for the
settlement of his estate was commenced before the RTC of
Passy City. This proceeding was pending at the time AMC filed
its answer with counterclaims and third-party complaint.
SHCI made demands on AMC, after Chua's death,
for allegedly undelivered items. Upon investigation, AMC
discovered that in 1998, Chu received from SHCI 18 Metrobank
checks. These were all payable to AMC and were crossed or
for payee's account only." A.\1:C argued that it was unaware of
Chua's transactions with SHCI and it did not receive any money
from the latter.
Metrobank admitted that it deposited the checks in
question to the account of Ayala Lumber and Hardware, a
sole proprietorship Chua owned and managed. The deposit
was allegedly done with the knowledge and consent of AMC.
According to Metrobank, Chu then pave the assurance that
the arrangement for the handling of the checks carried AMc;'s
consent. Chua also submitted documents showing his position
and interest in AMC. Metrobnk filed a motion for leave to
admit fourth-party complaint against Chua's estate. It alleged
that Chua's estate should reimburse Metrobank in case it would
be held liable in the third-party complaint filed against it by
AMC.

Should Metrobank be allowed to fle a fourth-party
complaint against Chua's estate?
HELD: YES. The term quasi-contract is included in
the concept "implied contracts" as used in the Rules of Court.
Accordingly, liabilities of the deceased arising from quaeicontracts should be filed as claims in the settlement of his
estate, as provided in Section 5, Rule 86 of the Rules of Court.
Both the RTC and the Court of Appeals described Metrobank's
claim against Chua'fl estate as one based on quasi-contract. A
quasi-contract involves a juridical relation that the law creates
on the basis of certain voluntary, unilateral and lawful acts of a
person, to avoid unjust enrichment....Article 2154 of the Civil
Code embodies the concept "solutio indebit" which arises when
something is delivered through mistake to a person who has no
right to demand it. It obligates the latter to return what has
been received through mistake.
A distinctive character of Metrobank's fourth-party
complaint is its contingent nature the claim depends on the
possibility that Metrobank would be adjudged liable to AMC,
a future event that may or may not happen. This characteristic
unmistakably marks the complaint as a contingent one that
must be included in the claims falling under the terms of Section
6, Rule 86 of the Rules of Court.

Claim for damages arising from breach of contract of transpor•

Bautista v. De Guzman
G.R. No. L-28298, November 25, 1983
FACTS: Numeriano Bautista was a passenger of a
jeepney that was owned and operated by Rosendo De Guzman.
Eugenio Medrano was Rosendo's employee nod was the driver
of the jeepney Numeriano was in. Eugenio drove the jeepney
recklessly, und Numeriano sustained injuries which caused hie
death. Eugenio was convicted in a criminal case for homicide
through reckless imprudence, and he was ordered to indemnify
Bautista's heirs. However, the writ of execution wee returned
unsatisfied. Later, Rosendo died.
Unable to collect damages from Eugenio, the Bautista&
fled a complaint against the De Guzmns. The court dismissed
the complaint holding that the suit was a money claim against a
dead debtor (Rosendo) and should have been filed in the testate
or mtcstate proceedings.

'

APTER VIII - CLAIMS AGAINST THE ESTATE MD ACTIONS
AND AGAINST EXECUTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
Rule 86 - Claims Against the Estate

Was the dismissal of the complaint proper
HELD: YES. Section 5, Rule 86 of the Rules of Court
is mandatory. The requirement therein is for the purpose
of protecting the estate of the deceased. The executor or
administrator is informed of the claims against it, thus enabling
him to examine each claim and to determine whether it is a
proper one which should be allowed.
Therefore, upon the dismissal of the first complaint,
they should have presented their claims before the intestate
proceedings fled in the same court. Instead of doing so, however,
the plaintiffs-appellees slept on their right. They allowed said
proceedings to terminate and the propert ies to be distributed
to the heirs pursuant to a project of partition before instituting
this separate action.
With the exception provided for in Rule 86, the failure
of the Bautistas to present their claims before the intestate
proceedings of the estate of Rosendo de Guzman within the
prescribed period constituted a bar to a subsequent claim
against the estate or a similar action of the same import.
Therefore, it was an error on the part of the trial court to
hold that the plaintiffs-appellees had a cause of action against
the defendants-appellants who are the heirs of the deceased
against whom the liability is sought to be enforced, much less
take cognizance of the complaint. As in the first complaint, said
court could not have assumed jurisdiction over the second case
for the simple reason that it was no longer acting as a probate
court which was the proper forum to file such complaint. The
termination of the intestate proceedings and the distribution
of the estate to the heirs did not alter the fact that plaintiffsappellees' claim was a money claim which should have been
presented before the probate court. The liability of the late
Rosendo de Guzman rose from the breach of his obligations
under the contract of carriage between him and the unfortunate
passenger. The obligations are spelled out by law but the liability
arose from a breach of contractual obligations. The resulting
claim is a money claim.
The only instance wherein a creditor can file an action
against a distributee of the debtor's asset is under Section 5,
Rule 88 of the Rules of Court which provides:
If such contingent claim becomes absolute
and is presented to the court, or to the executor or
administrator, within two (2) years from the time
limited for other creditors to present their claims. it
may be allowed by the court if not disputed by the

executor or administrator, and, ifdisputed, it may be
proved and allowed or disallowed by the court as the
facts may warrant. If the contingent claim is allowed,
the creditor shall receive payment to the same
extent as the other creditors if the estnte retained
by the executor or administrator is sufficient. But if
the claim is not so presented, after having become
absolute, within said two (2) years, and allowed,
the assets retained in the hands of the executor
or administrator, not exhausted in the payment of
claims, shall be distributed by the order of the court
to the persons entitled to the same; but the assets
so distributed may still be applied to the payment

of the claim when established, and the creditor
may maintain an action 1:1.gainst the distributees to
recover the debt, and such distribute-es and their
estates shall be liable for the debt in proportion to
the estate they have respectively received from the
property of the deceased.
Even under the above rule. the contingent claims must first
have been established and allowed in the probate court before
the creditors can file an action directly, against the distributee11.
Such is not the situation, however, in the case al bar. The
complaint herein was filed after the intestate proceedings had
terminated and the estate finally distributed to the heirs. If
we are to allow the complaint to prosper and the trial court to
take cognizance of the same, then the rules providing for the
claims against the estate in a testate or intestate proceedings
within a specific period would be rendered nugatory as a
subsequent action for money against the distributees may be
filed independently of such proceedings. This precisely is what
the rule seeks to prevent so as to void further delays in the
settlement of the estate of the deceased and in the distribution
of hie property to the heirs, legatees, or devisees.
Furthermore, even assuming that the plaintiffs-appellecs
had no knowledge of the intestate proceedings which is not
established, the law presumes that they had such knowledge
because the settlement of estate is a proceeding in remark nnd
therefore the failure to file their claims before such proceedings
barred them from subsequently filing the same claims outside
said proceedings.

Claims which survive death
Claims for civil liability survive notwithstanding the death of
the accused if the same may also be based on a source of obligation

other than delict, such as contract, law, quasi-contract, and quasidelict. A separate civil action may be enforced either against:
()

The estate of the accused, in case of a contract; or

(2)

The executor or administrator, in case of law, quasicontract, and quasi-delict.

Civil actions for tort or quasi-delict do not fall within the class
of claims to be filed under the notice to creditors required under Rule
86. These actions, being civil, survive the death of the decedent and
may be commenced against the administrator pursuant to Section
1, Rule 87.°
Judgment for money
When judgment in a civil case has become final and executory,
execution is not proper remedy to enforce payment; the claimant
should present the claim before the probate court" Similarly,
mandamus is not an available remedy for the immediate payment
of a claim by an administrator because such is not a matter of
right. In the absence of any showing that the probate judge who
is taking cognizance of the estate proceedings had already allowed
the administrator to dispose of the estate and to pay the debts and
legacies of the deceased, a writ of mandamus will not issue to compel
him to order payment of a creditor's claim.»
Property levied upon in case the judgment debtor dies after the
entry of judgment may be sold for the satisfaction of the judgment
in case death occurs "after execution is actually levied." On the
other hand, Section 5 of Rule 86 provides that a judgment for money
against the decedent must be filed with the court in the proceeding
for the settlement of the estate. In other words, the cut-off date is
the date of actual levy of execution. If the judgment debtor dies after
such levy, the property levied upon may be sold; if before, the money
Judgment must be presented as a claim against the estate, although
of course, the same need no longer be proved, the judgment itself
being conclusive. Nevertheless, the judgment creditor will share the
estate with other creditors, subject only to such preferences as are
Provided by law."

CHAPTER VIII CLAIMS AGAINST THE ESTATE AND ACTIONS
BY AND AGAINST EXECUTORS AND ADMINISTRATORS
Rule 86- Claims Against the Estate

SEC. 6. Solidary obligation of decedent. Where the obligation of the decedent is solidary
with another debtor, the claim shall be filed against
the decedent as if he were the only debtor, without
prejudice to the right of the estate to recover
contribution from the debtor. In a joint obligation
of the decedent, the claim shall be confined to the
portion belonging to him.

f the death of one of the solidary debtors, he (the creditor) may, if he
~ chooses, proceed against the surviving solidary debtors without
necessity of fling a claim in the estate of the deceased debtors. It
is not mandatory for him to have the case dismissed as against the
surviving debtors and file his claim against the estate of the deceased
solidary debtor, as was made apparent in the aforequoted decision.
For the court to require the creditor to proceed against the estate,
making it a condition precedent for any collection action against the
surviving debtors to prosper, would deprive him of his substantive
rights provided by Article 1216 of the Civil Code."

It may happen that the decedent is a debtor in either a
solidary or joint obligation. If the obligation is solidary, the creditor
is mandated to file a claim against the decedent as if he were the
only debtor, i.e., to collect the entire amount. If the creditor succeeds
in collecting from the decedent debtor, the estate has the right to
recover the respective contributions of the other debtors. Conversely,
if the obligation is joint, the claim shall be properly limited to the
portion owed by the decedent. Accordingly, failure to file a claim for
the solidary obligation against the decedent's estate bars it." While
collection from the decedent's estate is barred by the failure to file
a claim for solidary obligation, this does not result in the extinction
of the obligation. A cursory perusal of Section 6, Rule 86 reveals
that nothing therein prevents a creditor from proceeding against
the surviving solidary debtors. The provision merely sets up the
procedure in enforcing collection in case a creditor chooses to pursue
his claim against the estate of the deceased solidary debtor. The rule
has been set forth that a creditor (in a solidary obligation) has the
option whether to file or not to file a claim against the estate of the
solidary debtor.
It is clear that Article 1216 of the Civil Code" is the applicable
provision in this matter. The provision gives the creditor the right
to "proceed against anyone of the solidary debtors or some or all of
them simultaneously." The choice is undoubtedly left to the solidar
creditor to determine against whom he will enforce collection. In case

Rule 86- Claims Against the Estate

Options available to a secured creditor
A creditor holding a claim against the deceased secured by
mortgage or other collateral security has three options:
(1)

Abandon the security and prosecute his claim against the
estate and share in the general distribution of the assetu
of thereof;

(2)

Foreclose his mortgage judicially or realize upon hia
security by action in court, making the executor or
administrator a party defendant and if there is judgment
for deficiency, he may file a contingent claim against the
estate within the statute of non-claims;

(3)

Rely solely on his mortgage and foreclose the same
extrajudicially at anytime within the period of the statute
of limitations but he cannot be admitted as creditor and
shall cot receive in the distribution of the other assets cl.
the estate.

As explained in Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals
"Case law now holds that this rule grants to the mortgagee
three distinct, independent and mutually exclusive remedies
that can be alternatively pursued by the mortgage creditor for
the satisfaction of his credit in case the mortgagor dies:
(1)
to waive the mortgage and claim the entire debt
from the estate of the mortgagor as an ordinary claim;
(2)
to foreclose the mortgage judicially and prove any
deficiency as an ordinary claim; and
(3) to rely on the mortgage exclusively, foreclosing the
same at any time before it is barred by prescription without
right to file a claim for any deficiency:

their properties. After Flaviano died intestate, Salud and their
children appointed Edgar Malasang as their attorney-in-fact.
Edgar then fled a petition for letters of administration of the
intestate estate of Flaviano, which the court granted. The court
then issued a Notice to Creditors for the fling of money claims
against Flaviano's estate. During the pendeney of the intestate
proceedings, Edgar and his brother, Oscar, obtained several
loans from MBC, secured by promissory notes.
The probate court terminated the proceedings after
Flaviano's surviving heirs executed an extrajudicial partition
of the estate. However, the loan obligations of the estate
to MBC remained unsatisfied due to its certification that
Flaviano's account was undergoing restructuring. The court,
however. recognized MBC's rights under the mortgage executed
by the Spouses Maglasang, as well as its right to foreclose
the mortgaged property. MBC proceeded to extrajudicially
foreclose the mortgage, and it was the highest bidder at the
public auction. However, there was a deficiency in Spouses
Maglasang's obligation. Consequently, MBC fled a suit for the
recovery of the deficiency against Flaviano's estate, his widow,
and petitioners.
Petitioners assert that it is not Act No. 3135 but Section
7, Rule 86 of the Rules of Court which applies in this case.
Having filed its claim against the estate during the intestate
proceedings, petitioners argue that MDC had effectively waived
the remedy of foreclosure and, even assuming that it still had
the right to do so, it was precluded from filing a suit for the
recovery of the deficiency obligation.

HELD: NO. Jurisprudence breaks down the rule under
Section 7, Rule 86 and explains that the secured creditor has
three remedies/options that he may alternatively adopt for the
satisfaction of his indebtedness. In particular. he may choose to:
(a) waive the mortgage and claim the entire debt from the estate
of the mortgagor as an ordinary claim; (b) foreclose the mortgage
JUdtcially and prove the deficiency as an ordinary claim; and (c)
rely on the mortgage exclusively, or other security and foreclose
the same before it is barred by prescription, without the right to
file a claim for any deficiency. It must, however, be emphasized.
that these remedies are distinct, independent, and mutually
exclusive from each other; thus, the election of one effectively
bars the exercise of the others.

deficiency from the estate.
To obviate any confusion, the Court observes that the
operation of Act No. 3135 does not entirely discount the
application of Section 7, Rule 86, or vice-versa. Ruther, the
two complement each other within their re8pcctivc spheres of
operation. On the one hand. Section 7, Rule 86 lays down the
options for the secured creditor to claim against the estate and,
according to jurisprudence, the availment of the third option
bars him from claiming any deficiency amount. On the other
hand. after the third option is chosen. the procedure governing
the manner in which the extrajudicial foreclosure should proceed
would still be governed by the provisions of Act No. 3135. Simply
put. Section 7, Rule 86 governs the parameters and the extent
to which a claim may be advanced against the estate. whereas
Act No. 3136 sets out the specific procedure to be followed when
the creditor subsequently chooses the third option - specifically,
that of extrajudicially foreclosing real property belonging to the
estate. The application of the procedure under Act No. 3135
must be concordant with Section 7, Rule 86 as the latter is a
special rule applicable to claims against the estate. and at the
same time, since Section 7, Rule 86 docs not detail the procedure
for extra-judicial foreclosures, the formalities governing the
manner of availing of the third option - such as the place
where the application for extrajudicial foreclosure is filed. the
requirements of publication and posting and the place of sale must be governed by Act No. 3135.
In this case, MBC sought to extrajudicially foreclose the
mortgage of the properties previously belonging to Spouses
Maglasang and, therefore, availed of the third option. Lest it
be misunderstood, it did not exercise the first option of directly
filing a claim against the estate, s petitioners nssert, since it
merely notified the probate court of the outstanding amount of
its claim gainst the estate of Flaviano and that it was currently
restructuring the account. Thus, hving unequivocally opted
to exercise the third option of extrajudicial foreclosure under
Section 7, Ruic 86, MBC is now precluded from filing a suit to
reco ver any deficiency amount as earlier discussed.

If the court adjudges that it would be in the best interest of
the estate, it may order the executor or administrator to rede"
property mortgaged or pledged by paying the debt for which it is he'
as security. The mortgagee does not lose his right to extrajudicialb

If the creditor chooses to abandon the security, he cannot
later maintain an action upon the mortgage to foreclose it. He may
also, at his own election, foreclose the mortgage and realize upon
the security. But the law does not permit that he may have both
remedies. If he elects one he must renounce the other. If he fails
in one, he fails utterly. He is not permitted, under said section, to
annoy those interested in the estate of deceased persons, by two
actions for exactly the same purpose."

stating its loss or destruction. When the claim is
due, it must be supported by affidavit stating the
amount justly due, that no payments have been
made thereon which are not credited, and that
there are no offsets to the same, to the knowledge of
the affant. If the claim is not due, or is contingent,
when filed, it must also be supported by affidavits
stating the particulars thereof. When the affidavit
is made by a person other than the claimant, he
must set forth therein the reason why it is not
made by the claimant. The claim once filed shall
be attached to the record of the case in which the
letters testamentary or of administration were
issued, although the court, in its discretion, and as
a matter of convenience, may order all the claims
to be collected in a separate folder.

Rule 87 .-- Actions by and Against the Executors and Administrators

RULE 87
ACTIO NS BY AND AGAINST TH E EXECUTORS
AND ADMINISTRATORS

SEC. 1. Actions which may and which may not
be brought against executor or administrator. - No
action upon a claim for the recovery or money or
debtor interest thereon shall be commenced against
the executor or administrator; but to recover
real or personal property, or an interest therein,
from the estate, or to enforce a lien thereon, and
actions to recover damages for an injury to person
or property, real or personal, may be commenced
against him.

bound to protect the estate from any disbursements based on claims
not chargeable to the estate."
Actions to recover real or personal property, or an interest
therein, survive the decedent's death. Thus, an action for quieting of
title with damages" end en action for recovery of personal property
such as a motor vehicle" are not extinguished by the death of a party.
Likewise, the executor or administrator may sue upon any
cause of action which accrued to the decedent during his lifetime...
My action affecting the property rights of a deceased which may
be brought by or against him if he were alive, may be instituted
and prosecuted by or against the administrator, unless by its very
nature, it cannot survive, because death extinguishes such right.

SEC. 2. Executor or administrator may bring or
defend actions which survive. - For the recovery or
protection of the property or rights of the deceased,
an executor or administrator may bring or defend,
in the right of the deceased, actions for causes
which survive.

SEC. 3. Heir may not sue until share assigned.
- When an e:s:ecutor or administrator is appointed
and assumes the trust, no action to recover the title
or possession of lands or for damages done to such
lands shall be maintained against him by an heir or
devisee until there is an order of the court assigning
such lands to such heir or devisee or until the time
allowed for paying debts has expired.

To recall, money claims should be filed against the decedent's
estate; they may not be pursued against the executor or administrator.
Only the following actions may be commenced against the executor
or administrator:

Before distribution is made or before any residue known, the
heirs and devisees have no cause of action against the administrator
for recovery of property left by the deceased."

(1)

Recovery of real or personal property or an interest
therein;

(2) Enforcement of a lien on real or personal property; and
(3) Recovery of damages for an injury to person, propert-1
whether real or personal.
AB a rule of thumb, actions which survive the decedent's death
should be made against the executor or administrator. Conversely,
actions that do not survive must be claimed against the estate
Moreover, the term "claims" required to be presented against
decedent's estate is generally construed to mean debts or demand'
of a pecuniary nature which could have been enforced against the
deceased in his Lifetime or liability contracted by the deceased befort
his death. The court charged with the settlement of the estate 18

(3)

The executor or administrator is unwilling or refuses to
bring suit;"
The executor or administrator is alleged to have
participated in the act complained of and he is made
party defendant."

(4)

In one case, the heirs were allowed to file a petition for correction
of clerical errors in the description of the property in the project of
partition after it was approved by the probate court.n
The heir is not entirely precluded from suing the executor or
administrator. However, the suit may only prosper if:
(1)

There is an order of the court assigning the property to
such heir; or

(2)

The time allowed for the payment of a debt has expired.

Simply put, the partition and delivery of his corresponding
share must precede the suit filed by the heir. The rationale for the
foregoing rule was aptly explained by Chief Justice Moran, to wit:
An executor or administrator who assumes the trust,
takes possession of the property left by the decedent for the
purpose of paying debts. While his debts are undetermined and
unpaid, no residue may be settled for distribution among the
heirs and devisees. Consequently, before distribution is made, or
before any residue is known, the heirs or devisees have no cause
of uction against the executor or administrator for recovery of
the property left by the deceased."»
SEC. 4. Executor or administrator may
compound with debtor. - Within the approval of the
court, an executor or administrator may compound
with the debtor of the deceased for a debt due, and
may give a discharge of such debt on receiving a
just dividend of the estate of the debtor.

Section 4 empowers the executor or administrator to
compromise with the decedent's debtor.
SEC. 5. Mortgage due estate may be foreclosed.

_ A mortgage belonging to the estate of a deceased
person, as mortgagee or assignee of the right or
a mortgage, may be foreclosed by the executor or
administrator.
As earlier discussed, the rule is that the executor or
administrator is not chargeable for the loss sustained. by the estate.
Nevertheless, if, through his negligence, the estate sustains a loss
due to his failure to foreclose or delay until the mortgage property
has depreciated such that the full amount of the debt cannot be
recovered, the executor or administrator shall bear the loss. The
executor or administrator must show to the satisfaction of the court
the reason for the failure to foreclose and the loss resulting to the
estate. Assuming that the executor or testator successfully forecloses
the mortgaged property, the distribution of the proceeds shall be
determined by the heirs among themselves. Such issue cannot be
litigated or determined in the foreclosure case, unless all the heirs
are made parties to the said proceeding.
SEC. 6. Proceedings when property concealed,
embezzled, or fraudulently conveyed. --Ifan executor
or administrator, heir, legatee, creditor or other
individual interested in the estate of the deceased,
complains to the court having jurisdiction of
the estate that a person is suspected of having
concealed, embezzled, or conveyed away any of the
money, goods, or chattels of the deceased, or that
such person has in his possession or has knowledge
of any deed, conveyance, bond, contract, or other
Writing which contains evidence of or tends or

to appear before it any may examine him on oath
on the matter of such complaint; and if the person
so cited refuses to appear, or to answer on such
examination or such interrogatories as are put to
him, the court may punish him for contempt, and
may commit him to prison until he submits to the

estate as came to his possession in trust for such
executor or administrator, and of his proceedings
thereon; and if the person so cited refuses to appear
to render such account, the court may punish him
for contempt as having disobeyed a lawful order of
the court.
SEC. 8. Embezzlement before letters issued.- It

chattels, or effects of such deceased, such person
shall be liable to an action in favor of the executor
or administrator of the estate for double the value
of the property sold, embezzled, or alienated, to be
recovered for the benefit of such estate.

164

When the property of the decedent is concealed, embezzled,
or fraudulently conveyed, the interested party must bring it to the
court's attention, which shall them cite the person suspected to
appear in court. If the person cited refuses, the court may punish
him for contempt and order his commitment to prison until be

When the executor or administrator, heir, legatee,
creditor, or other individual interested in the estate of
the deceased complains to the court having jurisdiction of
the estate that a person is suspected of having concealed.

chattels of the deceased; or

(2)

When such person has in his possession or hes knowledge
of any deed, conveyance, bond, contract, or other writing,
which contains evidence of or tends or discloses the right,
title, interest, or claim of the deceased.

The section only provides a proceeding for examining persons
suspected of having concealed, embezzled, or conveyed away property
of the deceased or withholds information of documentary evidence
tending to disclose rights or claims of the deceased to such property
or to disclose the possession of his last will end testament. The
purpose of the proceeding is to elicit evidence, end the section doe
not, in terms, authorize the court to enforce delivery of possess1on
of the things involved. To obtain the possession, recourse rnust
therefore generally be had to an ordinary action."
SEC. 7. Person entrusted with estate compelled
to render account, - The court, on complaint of
an executor or administrator, may cite a person
entrusted by an executor or administrator with
any part of the estate of the deceased to appear
before it, and may require such person to render a
full account, on oath, of the money, goods, chattels,

If before the grant of letters testamentary or of administration,
a person embezzles or alienates money or property of the deceased,
such person shall be liable to an action in favor of the executor or
administrator for double the value of the property sold, embezzled
or alienated. This is the "double value rule."

When writ of execution may issue

SEC. 5. How contingent claim becoming
absolute in two years allowed and paid. Action
against distributees later.- If such contingent claim
becomes absolute and is presented to the court, or
to the executor or administrator, within two (2)
years from the time limited for other creditors to
present their claims, it may be allowed by the court
if not disputed by the executor or administrator
and, if disputed, it may be proved and allowed or
disallowed by the court as the facts may warrant. If
the contingent claim is allowed, the creditor shall
receive payment to the same extent as the other
creditors if the estate retained by the executor or
administrator is sufficient. But if the claim is not
so presented, after having become absolute, within
said two (2) years, and allowed, the assets retained
in the hands of the executor or administrator,
not e:s:hausted in the payment of claims, shall be
disturbed by the order of the court to the persons
entitled to the same; but the assets so distributed
may still be applied to the payment of the claim
when established, and the creditor may maintain
an action against the distributees to recover the
debt, and such distributees and their estates shall
be liable for the debt in proportion to the estate
they have respectively received from the property
of the deceased,

Although a writ of execution may not issue to recover a clai
aga1~st the estate, a writ of execution may issue in accordance wit~
Section 6. In declaring such writ as valid, the Supreme Court said:
Execution may issue only where the devisees, legatees o
heirs have entered into possession of their res pective portions
in the estate prior to settlement end payment of the debts and
expenses of administration and it is later ascerta ined that there
are such debts and expenses to be paid, in which case 'the court
having jurisdiction of the estate may, by order for that purpo se,
after hearing. settle the amount of their several liabilities
and order how much and in what manner each person shall
contribute, and may issue execution if circumstances require. "

Section 6 clearly authorizes execution to enforce payment of the
debts of the estate. A legacy is not a debt of the estate, but according
to Section 6, legatees are among those against whom execution is
authorized to be issued.' Sections 15 and 16, as well as Sections I
to 5, and 7(a) of Rule 89 all refer to the payment of legacies as if
such are debts. The correct rule is amply stated in Rule 90, Section
1, which does not include legacies as among those that should be
paid before the order of distribution - only debts, funeral charges,
expenses of administration, allowance to widow and inheritance tax.
Again, it is only after the debts end expenses of administration have
been paid that the residue shall be given to heirs and those entitled
by way of inheritance or legacy.'
SEC. 4. Estate to be retained to meet contingent
claims. - If the court is satisfied that a contingent
claim duly filed is valid, it may order the executor
or administrator to retain in his hands sufficient
estate to pay such contingent claim when the same
becomes absolute, or if the estate is insolvent,
sufficient to pay a portion equal to the dividend of
the other creditors.

A contingent claim is one that is subject to the happening of a
future uncertain event. The requisites for the estate to be required
to retain estate to meet the contingent claim are as follows:

that such sale, mortgage, or encumbrance would
be beneficial to the persons interested; and if
a part cannot be sold, mortgaged, or otherwise

such real estate, or so much thereof as 1s necessary
or beneficial under the circumstances.

SALES, MORTGAGES, AND OTHER ENCUMBRANCES OF
PROPERTY OF DECEDENT
SEC. 1. Order of sale of personalty. - Upon
the application of the executor or administrator,
and on written notice to the heirs and other
persons interested, the court may order the whole
or a part of the personal estate to be sold, if it
appears necessary for the purpose of paying debts,
expenses of administration, or legacies, or for the
preservation of the property.
The executor or administrator is prohibited from selling
personal property of the decedent without court order even if the
heirs and other persons interested have consented thereto. An
executor or administrator may be held answerable for selling the
decedent's property without a court order. The assent of the heirs
is insufficient to vest in him the power to dispose of the decedent's
property. Moreover, the court cannot motu proprio order the sale of
personal property. It is essential that the executor or administrator
applies for such sale with the court and gives written notice to the
heirs and other persons interested. It must also be shown that the sale
is necessary for the payment of debts, expenses of administration, or
legacies, or the preservation of the property.
SEC. 2. When court may authorize sale, mortgage, or otherencumbrance ofrealty topay debts and
legacies through personalty not exhausted. - When
the personal estate of the deceased is not sufficient
to pay the debts, expenses of administration, and
legacies, or where the sale of such personal estate
may injure the business or other interests of those
interested in the estate, and where a testator has
not otherwise made sufficient provision for the
payment of such debts, expenses, and legacies,
the court, on the application of the executor or
administrator and on written notice of the heirs,
devisees, and legatees residing in the Philippines,
may authorize the executor or administrator to
sell, mortgage, or otherwise encumber so much
as may be necessary of the real estate, in lieu or

The court, on application, may authorize the executor or
administrator to sell mortgage, or otherwise encumber the decedent's
real estate, instead of his personal property, in order to pay debts,
expenses, and legacies. 'The sale, mortgage, or other encumbrance
is conditioned on the application of the executor or administrator,
written notice to the heirs, devisees, and legatees residing in the
country, and such would be beneficial to the person interest.
The executor or administrator is not constrained to sell,
mortgage, or encumber the whole property or none. Only so much
as may be necessary of the real estate need be sold, mortgaged,
or encumbered. Nevertheless, the whole property may be sold,
mortgaged, or encumbered in the following instances:
(1)

If the sale, mortgage, or encumbrance of a part will injure
those interested in the remainder; and

(2)

If it is necessary under the circumstances.

SEC. 3. Persons interested may prevent such
sale, etc., by giving bond. - No such authority to sell,
mortgage, or otherwise encumber real or personal
estate shall be granted if any person interested in
the estate gives a bond, in a sum to be fixed by the
court, conditioned to pay the debts, expenses or
administration, and legacies within such time as
the court directs; and such bond shall be for the
security of the creditors, as well as of the executor
or administrator, and may be prosecuted for the
benefit of either.

or administrator to sell the personal estate or to

estate for the payment of debts or legacies in the
other country, in same manner as for the payment
of debts or legacies in the Philippines.

SEC. 4. When court may authorize sale of
estate as beneficial to interested persons. Disposal
of proceeds.- When it appears that the sale of the
whole or a part of the real or personal estate, will be
beneficial to the heirs, devisees, legatees, and other
interested persons, the court may, upon application
of the e:r.ecutor or administrator and on written
notice to the heirs, devisees, and legatees who are
interested in the estate to be sold, authorize the
ezecutor or administrator to sell the whole or a
part of said estate, although not necessary to pay
debts, legacies, or expenses of administration; but
such authority shall not be granted if inconsistent
with the provisions of a will. In case of such sale, the
proceeds shall be assigned to the persons entitled
to the estate in the proper proportions.
The primary consideration for the court is the interest and
benefit to the heirs, devisees, legatees, and other interested persons.
While the sale may not be necessary for the payment of debts,
expenses of administration, or legacies, the court may nevertheless
authorize such sale. Any proceeds derived from such sale shell be
assigned to the persons entitled to the estate in the proper portions.
Note that the only limitation on a sale otherwise beneficial to
interested persons would be its inconsistency with the provisions of
a will.
SEC. 5. When court may authorize sale,
mortgage, or other encumbrance of estate to pay
debts and legacies in other countries. - When the
sale of personal estate, or the sale, mortgage, or
other encumbrance of real estate is not necessary
to pay the debts, expenses of administration, or
legacies in the Philippines, but it appears front
records and proceedings of a probate court in
another country that the estate of the deceased
in such other country is not sufficient to pay the

SEC. 6. When court may authorize sale, mortgage, or other encumbrance of realty acquired on
execution or foreclosure. - The court may authorize
executor or administrator to sell mortgage, or
otherwise encumber real estate acquired by him
on execution or foreclosure sale, under the same
circumstances and under the same regulations as
prescribed in this rule for the sale. mortgage, or
other encumbrance of other real estate.
SEC. 7.Regulation forgranting authority to sell,
mortgage, or otherwise encumber estate. - The court
having jurisdiction of the estate of the deceased
may authorize the e:r.ecutor or administrator to sell
personal estate, or to sell, mortgage, or otherwise
encumber real estate, in cases provided by these
rules and when it appears necessary or beneficial
under the following regulations.
(a) The executor or administrator shall file
a written petition setting forth the debts due from
the deceased, the expenses of administration,
the legacies, the value of the personal estate, the
situation of the estate to be sold, mortgaged, or
otherwise encumbered, and such other facts as
show that the sale, mortgage, or other encumbrance
is necessary or beneficial.
(b) The court shall thereupon fix a time and
place for hearing such petition. and cause notice
stating the nature of the petition, the reasons
for the same, and the time and place of hearing,
to be given personally or by mail to the persons

encumbrance;

shall be authorized until notice of the application
for that purpose has been given personally or by
mail to all persons interested, and such further
notice has been given, by publication or otherwise,
as the court deems proper; nor if the assets in
the hands of the executor or administrator will
thereby be reduced so as to prevent a creditor from
receiving his full debt or diminish his dividend.

(d) I the requirements in the preceding
subdivisions of this section have been complied
with, the court. by order stating such compliance,
may authorize the executor or administrator to sell,
mortgage, or otherwise encumber, in proper cases,
such part of the estate as is deemed necessary,
and in case of sale the court may authorize it to be
public or private, as would be most beneficial to all
parties concerned. The executor or administrator
shall be furnished with a certified copy of such
order;

The provision presupposes that the contract entered into by the
deceased during his lifetime is valid and binding. There should be
no controversy involving real property or interest therein. Such sale
must not reduce the value of the estate to the extent or depriving
creditors payment of their claims.

(e) I the estate is to be sold at auction. the
mode of giving notice of the time and place of the
sale shall be governed by the provisions concerning
notice of execution sale;

of deeds of the province in which the real estate
thus sold, mortgage, or otherwise encumbered
is situated, a certified copy of the order of the

real property, or an interest therein, the court
having jurisdiction of the estate may, on application
for that purpose. authorize the executor or

to such contract, or with such modifications as are
agreed upon by the parties and approved by the
court; and if the contract is to convey real property

held; and the court may order the execution of such
trust, whether created by deed or by law.

After the foregoing payments are made, the residue may be
distributed to those entitled thereto. The practice in the distribution
of the estates of deceased persons is to assign the whole of the
properties left for distribution to the heirs in a certain definite
proportion, an aliquot part pertaining to each of the heirs.2

SEC. 1. When order for distribution of residue
made. - When the debts. funeral charges. and
expenses of administration, the allowance to the
widow, and inheritance tax. if any, chargeable
to the estate in accordance with law. have been

from the executor or administrator, or any other
person having the same in his possession. Ir there
is a controversy before the court as to who are
the lawful heirs of the deceased person or as the
distributive shares to which each person is entitled
under the law, the controversy shall be heard and
decided as in ordinary cases.

It is only after the payment of all debts, funeral expenses,
charges of administration, allowance to widow and inheritance tax
shall have been effected that the court should make the declaration
of heirs or of such persons as are entitled by law to the residue.

No distribution shall be allowed until the
payment of the obligations above mentioned has
been made or provided for, unless the distributees,
or any of them, give a bond, in a sum to be fixed
by the court, conditioned for the payment of said
obligations within such time as the court directs.

However, what the court is enjoined from doing is the

A final decree of distribution of the estate of a deceased person
vests the title to the land of the estate in the distribute-es. If the
decree is erroneous, it should be corrected by opportune appeal, for

186

Liquidation
There are two requisites before the distribution of the estate:
(1)

Liquidation; and

(2)

Declaration of heirs.

Liquidation refers to the determination of all assets of the
estate and payment of all debts and expenses. The declaration
of heirs is undertaken to determine to whom the residue of the
estate should be distributed. The declaration is made in the same
proceeding, a separate action for the declaration of heirs not being
the proper recourse.
The decedent's net estate is ascertained by deducting all payable
obligations and charges from the value of the property owned by the
deceased at the time of death. Thereafter, all donations subject to
collation would be added to it. This is the partible estate. From there,
the legitime of the compulsory heirs can be established. Thereafter,
the court may determine whether a donation has prejudiced the
Jegitimes.'
Project of partition
Towards the end of the proceedings in a petition for settlement
of estate, a project of partition is usually prepared and presented to
the court. The project of partition is a proposal for distribution of the
hereditary estimates and determines the persons entitled thereto.'

administration only after the payment of all the debts and

FACTS: Petitioner Oscar and respondent Rodrigo are
two of the four children of the spouses Pedro and Anastacia
Reyes. Pedro, Anastacia, Oscar, and Rodrigo each owned shares
of stock of Zenith Insurance Corporation (Zenith), a domestic
corporation established by their family. Pedro died in 1964,
while Anastacia died in 1993. Although Pedro's estate was
judicially partitioned among his heirs sometime in the 1970s,
no similar settlement and partition appear to have been made
with Anastacia's estate, which included her shareholdings in
Zenith. As of June 30, 1990, Anastacia owned 136,598 shares of
Zenith: Oscar and Rodrigo owned 8,715,637 and 4,250 shares,
respectively.
Zenith and Rodrigo filed a complaint with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) against Oscar. Rodrigo sought
to obtain an accounting of Zenith's funds which were formerly
and presently in the control, custody, or possession of Oscar.
He also sought the determination of the shares of stock of his
parents. Rodrigo claimed that Oscar frfrndulently appropriated
their parents' shares of stock. In the meantime, the jurisdiction
over the matter was transferred to the RTC. When Republic
Act (R.A.) No. 8799 took effect. the SEC's exclusive and original
jurisdiction over cases enumerated in Section 5 of Presidential
Decree (P.D.) ~o. 902·A was transferred to the HTC designated
as a special commercial court Thereupon, Oscar filed a :i.1otion

done. The RTC of Makati, acting as a special commercial court,

has no jurisdiction to settle, partition, and distribute the estate
of a deceased. A relevant provision
Section 2 of Ruic 90 of the
Revised Rules of Court
that contemplates properties of the
decedent held by one of the heirs declares:
Questions as to advancement made or
alleged to have been made by the deceased Lo any
heir may be beard and determined by the court
having jurisdiction of the estate proc eedings,
and the fnal order of the court thereon shall be
binding on the person raising the questions and on
the heir. [Emphasis supplied.]
Worth noting are this Court's statements in the case of
Natcher v. Court of Appeals:
Matten which involve settlement and
distribution of the estate of the decedent fall
within the exclusive province of the probate
court in the exercise of its limited jurisdiction.

It is clear that trial courts trying an
ordinary action cannot resolve to perform
acts pertaining to a special proceeding because
it is subject to specific prescribed rules. [Emphasis
supplied.]
Thal an accounting of the funds and assets of Zenith to
determine the extent and value of Anastacia's shareholdings will
be undertaken by a probate court and not by a special commercial
court is completely consistent with the probate court's limited
jurisdiction. It hos the power to enforce an accounting as a
necessary means to its authority to determine the properties
included in the inventory of the estate to be m.lminialered,
divided up, and distributed. Beyond this, the determination of
title or ownership over the subject shares (whether belonging to
Anastacia or Oscar) may be conclusively settled by the probate
court as a question of collation or advancement. We had occasion
to recognize the court's authority to act on questions of title or
ownership in a collation or advancement situation in Coca w.
Pangilinan where we ruled:
It should be clarified that whether a particular
matter should be resolved by the Court of First
Instance in the exercise of its general jurisdiction or
of its limited probate jurisdiction is in reality not a
jurisdictional question. In essence, it is a procedural

question involving a mode of practice "which may be
waived."
AP, a general rule, the question as to title to
property should not be passed upon in the testate
or intestate proceeding. That question should be
ventilated in a separate action. 'I'hat general rule has
qualifications or exceptions justifed by exped iency
and convenience,

Thus, the probate court may provisionally
pass upon in an intestate or testate proceeding
the question of inclusion in, or exclusion from, the
inventory of a piece of property without prejudice to
its final determination in u separate action.
Although generally, a probate court may
not decide a question or title or ownership,
yet if the interested parties are all heirs, or the
question is one or collation or advancement, or
the parties consent to the assumption of jurisdiction
by the probate court and the rights of third parties
are not impaired, the probate court is competent
to decide the question or ownership. !Citations
omitted. Emphasis suppled.]
In sum, we hold that the nature of the present controversy
is not one which may be classified as an intra-corporate dispute
and is beyond the jurisdiction of the Hpecial commercial court to
resolve. In short, Rodr igo's complaint also fails the nature of the
controversy teat.

.7%22%%.41.11:27

LCN Construction Corporation. es the only remRining
claimant against the Intestate Estate of the Late Raymond
Triviere, sought recourse from the Court of Appeals through
a petition for certiorari, contending that the nwards violate
Section I, Rule 90 of the Rules of Court, as there still exists its
(LCN's) unpaid claim in the sum of P6,016,570.65. The Court of
Appeals revoked the shnres awarded by the RTC to the children
and widow of the deceased on the basis thnt Section 1, Rule 90
of the Rules of Court proscribes the distribution of the residue of
the estate until all its obligations have been paid.
Was the advance distribution of the estate of the decedent valid?
HELD: NO. While the awards in favor of petitioner
children and widow was not yet a distribution of the residue of
the estate, given that there was still a pending claim against
the estate, still, they did constitute a partial and advance
distribution of the estate. Virtually, the petitioner children
and widow were already being awarded shares in the estate,
although not all of its obligations had been paid or provided for.
Section 2, Rule 109 of the Revised Rules of Court expressly
recognizes advance distribution of the estate, thus:
Section 2. Advance distribution in special proceedings.- Notwithstanding a pending controversy
or appeal in proceedings to settle the estnte of a
decedent, the court may, in its discretion and
upon such terms as it may deem proper ond
just, permit that such part of the estate as my not
be affected by the controversy or appeal be distributed among the heirs or legatees, upon compliance
with the conditions set forth in Rule 90 of these
rules. (Emphases supplied.)
The second paragTUph of Section 1 of Rule 90 of the
Revised Rules of Court allows the distribution of the estate prior
to the payment of the obligations mentioned therein, provided
that "the distributees, or any of them, gives a bond, in a sum
to be fixed by the court, conditioned for the payment of said
obligations within such time as the court directs."
In sum, although it is within the discretion of the RTC
whether or not to permit the advance distribution of the
estate, its exercise of such discretion should be qualified by tho

following: [1] only part of the estate that is not affected by any

post a bond, fixed by the court, conditioned for the payment
of outstanding obligations of the estate (second paragraph
of Section 1, Rule 90). There is no showing that the RTC, in
awarding to the petitioner children and widow their shares in
the estate prior to the settlement of all its obligations, complied
with these two requirements or, at the very least, took the same
into consideration. Its Order of June 12, 2003 is completely silent
on these matters. It justified its grant of the award in a single
sentence which stated that petitioner children and widow had
not yet received their respective shares from the estate after all
these years. Taking into account that the claim of LCN against
the estate of the late Raymond Triviere allegedly amounted to
P6,016,570.65, already in excess of the P4,738,558.63 reported
total value of the estate, the RTC should have been more prudent
in approving the advance distribution of the same.
Petitioners earlier invoked Dael u. Intermediate Appellate
Court, where the Court sustained an Order granting partial
distribution of an estate.
However, Dael is not even on all fours with the case at bar
given that the Court therein found that:
•
Where, however, the estate has sufficient
assets to ensure equitable distribution of the
inheritance in accordance with law and the final
judgment in the proceedings and it does not appear
there are unpaid obligations, as contemplated
in Rule 90, for which provisions should have been
made or a bond required, such partial distribution
may be allowed. (Emphasis suppled.)
No similar determination on sufficiency of assets or
absence of any outstanding obligations of the estate of the late
~Ym~nd Trivie_rc was made by the RTC in this case. In fact,
here ts a pending claim by LCN against the estate and the
amount thereof exceeds the value of the entire estate.
,, Furthermore, in Dael, the Court actually cautioned
partial distribution of the decedent's estate pending final
termination of the testate or intestate proceeding should as
much as possible be discouraged by the courts, and, except in
:treme caseR, such form of ndvnnces of inheritance should not
• countenanced. The reason for this rule is that courts should
tuard with utmost zeal and jealousy the estate of the decedent
the end that the creditors thereof be adequately protected

191

and all the rightful heirs be assured of their shares in the
inheritance.
Hence, the Court does not find that the C'..ourt of Appea19
erred in disallowing the 11.dvance award of shares by the RTC

petitioner children and the widow of the late Raymond Triviere.
Although the right of an heir over the property of the decedent
is inchoate as long as the estate has not been fully settled and
partitioned, the law allows a co-owner to exercise rights of ownership
over such inchoate right. Once an action for the settlement of an
estate is filed with the court, the properties included therein are
under the control of the intestate court. Not even the administrator
may take possession of any property that is part of the estate without
the prior authority of the court.''
An heir of the deceased. may sell his undivided or ideal share
during the pendency of the estate proceedings without the prior
approval of the probate court, he being the co-owner with other heir
of the estate. Court approval is necessary only if specific property cl
the estate is sold."

hav::"not received their share, their remedy would be to file a motion
for execution within five (6) years. Nevertheless, if other grounds
raised, such as forgery, the final Judgment cannot be attacked
are pt through a separate action. Like ordinary cases, the validity of
agent can be assailed through a petition for relief under
Rule 38, annulment of judgment under Rule 47, and a petition for

Remedy of a preterited heir
The intestate proceedings, although closed and terminated,
can still be opened within the prescriptive period upon petition
by the preterited heir.U The prescriptive period within which the
preterited heir may initiate the proceeding is 10 years, it being an
action upon an obligation created by law.
Moreover, where the judgment has become final, the remedy of
a party-heir would be to file an independent suit against the parties
and all other heirs for the recovery of her share in the estate."

Remedy of hair entitled to residue but not given hia share

tn1tanc:H when the court may issue a writ of execution

An heir entitled to the residue of the estate may demand hi,
share through the following courses of action:

As a general rule, a probate court cannot issue a writ of
execution. The following are the exceptions:

(1)

A motion in the same probate or administration
proceedings; or

{2)

A motion to reopen the settlement proceedings if it bad
already been closed."

The heir should not fle an independent action which would
be tried by another court or judge that might reverse a decision or
order of the probate court already final and executed and reshufl
properties long ago distributed and disposed of. u
If the proceeding is already closed and it involves persons wbO
are non-parties to the partition, a motion to reopen may be filed b_t•

used the word "may," it is nevertheless clear that the same provisioa
contemplates a probate court when it speaks of the "court having
jurisdiction of the estate proceedings." Thus, a court acting in its
general jurisdiction, is devoid of authority to render an adjudicatio
and resolve the issue of advancement of real property. An action for
reconveyance and annulment of title with damages is not the proper
suit to thresh out the issue."

- If at the time of distribution the ezecutor or
administrator has retained sufficient effects in
his hands which may lawfully be applied for the
expenses of partition of the properties distributed,
such expenses of partition may be paid by such
executor or administrator when it appears
equitable to the court and not inconsistent with
the intention of the testator; otherwise, they
shall be paid by the parties in proportion to their
respective shares or interest in the premises, and
the apportionment shall be settled and allowed

ESCHEAT
RULE 91
ESCHEATS

SEC. 1. When and by whom petition fil,d. - Wh en
a person dies intestate, seized of real property in
the Philippines, leaving no heir or person by law
entitled to the same. the Solicitor General or his
representative in behalf of the Republic or the
Philippines, may file a petition in the Court of First
Instance of the province where the deceased last
resided or in which be had estate, if be resided
out of the Philippines, setting forth the facts, and
praying that the estate or the deceased be declared
echeated.
Nature of proceedings

Escheat is a proceeding whereby the state, by virtue of its
sovereignty, steps in and claims the real or personal property rJ
a person who dies intestate leaving no heir. In the absence of a
lawful owner, a property is claimed by the State to forestall an open
"invitation to. self-service by the first comers." Escheat proceedin
rest on the principle of ultimate ownership by the state of all proper
within its jurisdiction.

Three kinds of escheat
A petition for escheat may be filed under three circumstances.
First, under Section l of Rule 91, a petition may be filed when a
person dies intestate, with real properties within the Philippines,
leaving no heir entitled to the same. Second, under Section 5 of the
same rule, a petition for reversion of property alienated in violation
of the Constitution or statute. Third, under Act No. 3936, unclaimed
balances in banks is also subject of escheat proceedings.

Where filed
A petition for escheat may be filed with the Regional Trial
Court of the province where the deceased last resided or in which he
had estate, if he was a non-resident.
Who may file petition
Escheat proceeding must be initiated by the Solicitor General.
All interested parties, such as the actual occupant end the adjacent
lot owners shall be personally notified of the proceedings and given
the opportunity to present their valid claims, otherwise the property
will be reverted to the State.4 "lnterested party" is any person
alleging to have a direct right or interest in the property sought to
be escheated.
Who may oppose petition
Any person alleged to have a direct right or interest in
the property sought to be escheated, likewise an interested and
:ressa1?' party, may properly oppose the petition for escheat or
ea claim thereto with the court within the period provided for in
Section 4 of the Rule."

Requisites for fifing of petition

For an escheat proceeding to prosper, the following must b
preBt!nt: (1) that a person died intestate; (2) that he left no heirs or

CHAPTER XI - ESCHEAT
Rule 9I
Escheats

A respondent may file a motion to dismiss for failure to state
a cause of action, where the petition for escheat does not state facts
which entitle petitioner to the remedy prayed for.7 The rcspundent
may also cite other grounds for dismissal under the Rules of Court,

Publication of the notice of hearing is a jurisdictional requisite,
noncompliance with which affects the validity of the proceedings.

206

Escheat proceedings cannot be converted Into settlement of estate
In a case, the proceedings were instituted as escheat proceed.
ings and not for the settlement of the estate of deceased persoM
The court acquired jurisdiction to hear the petition for escheat by
virtue of the publication of the petition for escheat. The jurisdiction
acquired cannot be converted into one for the distribution of the
properties of the decedent. For the distribution of the estate of the
decedent to be instituted, the proper petition must be presented and
the proceedings should comply with the requirements of the Rule.
Hence, the escheat court does not have the power to order, or to
proceed with, the distribution of the estate of a decedent in escheat
proceedings, and adjudicate the properties to the oppositors.
SEC. 2. Order for hearing. - If the petition Is
sufficient in form and substance, the court, by an
order reciting the purpose of the petition, shall
fix a date and place for the bearing thereof, which
date shall be not more than six (6) months after the
entry of the order, and shall direct that a copy of
the order be published before the hearing at least
once a week for six (6) successive weeks in some
newspaper of general circulation published in the
province, as the court shall be deem best.
Notice and publlcallon

The court must fix a date and place for the hearing of the
petition. The date of hearing should not be more than six months
after entry of the order. Also, the order must be published at lea&~
once a week for six consecutive weeks in newspaper of gene~:
circulation in the province. This is a deviation from the other specie
proceedings, which require publication for three consecutive weeks

SEC. 3. Hearing and judgment. - Upon
satisfactory proof in open court on the date fixed
in the order that such order has been published as
directed and that the person died intestate, seized
of real or personal property in the Philippines,
leaving no heir or person entitled to the same, and
no sufficient cause being shown to the contrary,
the court shall adjudge that the estate of the
estate of the deceased in the Philippines, after the
payment of just debts and charges, shall escheat;
and shall, pursuant to low, assign the personal
estate to the municipality or city where he last
resided in the Philippines, and the real estate to the
municipalities or cities, respectively, in which the
same is situated. If the deceased never resided in
the Philippines, the whole estate may be assigned
to the respective municipalities or cities where the
same is located. Such estate shall be for the benefit
of public schools, and public charitable institutions
and centers in said municipalities or cities.
Thecourt,atthe instance ofan interested party,
or on its own motion, may order the establishment
of a permanent trust, so that only the income from
the property shall be used.
Judgment in escheat proceedings
A judgment in escheat proceedings when rendered by a court of
competent jurisdiction is conclusive against all persons with actual
or constructive notice, but not against those who are not parties or
privies thereto."
However, before the court may render judgment in an escheat
Proceeding, it must first he sRtisfactori)y proved in open court that:
(a) the order has been published as directed, and (b) the person died
intestnte with real or personal property in the Philippines, leaving
no heir or person entitled to the same. The court shall order the

The right to escheat may be waived, either expressly or
impliedly. Hence, when the right to escheat claimed by the
municipality has existed long prior to the registration proceedings
instituted by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Manila, and, as the
same has not been asserted in said proceedings, it is deemed to have
been completely waived. u

Vicente Tan v. City ofDavao
G.R. No. L-44347, September 29, 1988
FACTS : On September 12, 1962, the City or Davao filed
a petition in the Court of First Instance of Davao, Branch I to
declare Dominga Garcia's land eschcated in its favor. It alleged
that Dominga Garcia and her children are presumed to be dead
and since Dominga Garcia left no heir or person by law entitled
to inherit her estate, the same should be escheated pursuant to
Rule 92 (now Rule 91) of the Rules of Court.

When proceedings will not prosper
In Municipal Council of San Pedro Laguna v. Colegio de San
dose," the petitioners sought to escheat a certain Hacienda de San
Pedro Tunasan. In their petition, the Municipality based their claims
to escheat the property on the fact that certain properties including
the Hacienda, were confiscated by the Crown of Spain, which later
passed on title to the property to the Government of the Philippines.
The Court ruled that the petition for escheat of Hacienda de San
Pedro Tunasan cannot prosper. It explained that the Municipality
cannot claim that the same be escheated to it, because it is no longer
the case of real property owned by a deceased person who bas not
left any heirs or person who may legally claim it.
It has also been held that Rule 91 does not cover properties
taken from enemy nationals as a result of World War II and required
to be transferred to the Republic of the Philippines by the United
States in accordance with its own enactment commonly known
the Philippine Property Act of 1946. Such properties, includinf
the land in dispute, belong to the Philippine government not by
virtue of the escheat proceedings but on the strength of the transfer
authorized and required by the said Act."

'GR. No. L46460, February 26, 1938
,gt
"Republic w. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 73881, February 21,"

209

Ramon Pizarro opposed the escheat petition on the
ground that courts are not authorized to declare that a person
is presumed to be dead and that Dominga Garcia's being in Red
China is not a sufficient ground to deprive her of her property
by escheat proceedings.
May the court declare an absentee presumptively dead in
connection with on action for settlement of the intestate estate of
the absentee?

HELD: YES. The Court of Appeals did not err in affirming
the trial court's ruling that Dominga Garcia and her heirs may
be presumed dead in the escheat proceedings as they are, in
effect, proceedings to settle her estate. Indeed, while a petition
instituted for the sole purpose of securing a judicial declaration
that II person is presumptively dead cannot be entertained if that
were the only question or matter involved in the case, the courts
are not barred from declaring an absentee presumptively dead
as an incident of, or in connection with, an action or proceedi ng
for the settlement of the intestate estate of such absentee.

Direct evidence proving that Dominga Garcia, her husband
and her children are in fact dead, is not necessary. It may be
presumed under Article 390 of the Civil Code which provides:
ART. 390. After an absence of seven years, it
being unknown whether or not the absentee still
lives. he shall be presumed dead for all purposes,
except for those of succession.
The absentee shall not be presumed dead for the purpose
of opening his succe ssion till after an absence of Len years.
Th e evidence of the City of Davao preponderantly shows
that in 1923 Dominga Garcia and her family left the Philippines
bound for China. Since then until the instant petition was
filed on September 12, 1962, period covering about 39 years,
nothin g had been heard about them.

SEC. 4. When and by whom claim to estate

or other person entitled to such estate appears and
files a claim thereto with the court within five (6)
years from the date of such judgment, such person
shall have possession of and title to the same, or if
sold, the municipality or city shall be accountable
to him for the proceeds after deducting reasonable
charges for the care of the estate; but a claim not
made within the said time shall be forever barred.
Period for filing claim to estate
Since escheat is one of the incidents of sovereignty, the state
may, and usually does, prescribe the conditions and limits the time
within which a claim to such property may be made. The procedure
by which the escheated property may be recovered is genera111
prescribed by statute, and a time limit is imposed within which su
action must be brought. a A devisee, legatee, widow, widower, oroth~
person entitled to the estate must file a claim with the court with
five years from the date of such judgment in the escheat proceedin'5·
The five-year perio_d is not a device capriciously conjured by the s_ts;

claims, otherwise they may lose them forever in a final judgment."
Thereafter, such claimant shall have possession and title thereto. If
the property has already been sold, the municipality or city shall be
accountable to him for proceeds, after deducting reasonable charges
of care of estate. Hence, where claimants contested the escheat
judgment in the guise of the petition for annulment filed before the
bourt of Appeals after the lapse of almost eight years, the belated
assertion of right militates against recovery."
Where a person comes into an escheat proceeding as a claimant,
the burden is on such intervenor to establish his title to the property
and his right to intervene.11
Lack of jurisdiction of escheat court
In the absence of jurisdiction to order an escheat due to noncompliance with jurisdictional requirements under the Rules of
Court, the court has no jurisdiction to grant the remedy enabling
the devisee, legatee, heir, widow, widower or other person entitled
to the estate to appear within a specific period from the date of the
decree of escheat and file a claim to the estate."
SEC. 6. Other actions for echeat. - Until
otherwise provided by law, actions reversion or
escheat of properties alienated in violation of the
Constitution or of any statute shall be governed by
this rule, except that the action shall be instituted
in the province where the land lies in whole or in
part.
Escheat and reversion distinguished
Escheat and reversion proceedings have the same effects, but
different procedures are followed.

Under Republic Act No. 8435, otherwise known as the
"Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997" (approved
on December 22, 1997), idle agricultural land may be subject to
reversion proceedings. Section 11 of said law provides:
"Stction 11. Penalty for Agricultural Inactivity and

owner."
Act No. 3936, as amended, outlines the proper procedure to be
followed by banks and other similar institutions in filing a sworn
tatement with the Treasurer concerning dormant accounts. Section
: thereof sets a detailed system for notifying depositors of unclaimed
balances. This notification is meant to inform them that their deposit
could be escheated if left unclaimed. Accordingly, before filing a
sworn statement, banks and other similar institutions are under
obligation to communicate with owners of dormant accounts. The
purpose of this initial notice is for a bank to determine whether an
inactive account has indeed been unclaimed, abandoned, forgotten,
or left without an owner. If the depositor simply does not wish to
touch the funds in the meantime, but still asserts ownership and
dominion over the dormant account, then the bank is no longer
obligated to include the account in its sworn statement. It is not the
intent of the law to force depositors into unnecessary litigation and
defense of their rights, as the state is only interested in escheating
balances that have been abandoned and left without an owner.
In case the bank complies with the provisions of the law and
:e uncla~med balances are eventually escheated to the Republic,
e bank shall not thereafter be liable to any person for the same
and any action which may be brought by any person against in any

bank es a party was explained in Republic of the Philippines u. Coti:rr
of First Instance of Manila:
..A 'real party in interest' has been defined as the party
who would be benefitted or injured by the judgment of the suit
or the party entitled to avail of the suit. There cn be no doubt
that private respondent bank falls under this definition for the
escheat of the dormant deposits in favor of the government
would necessarily deprive said bank of the use of such deposits.
It is in this sense that it stands to be 'injured by the judgment of
the suit;' and it is for this reason that Section 3 of Act No. 3936
specifically provides that the bank shall be joined as a party in
the action for escheat, thus:
Section 3. Wh enever the Attorney General
shall be informed of such unclaimed balances, he
shall commence an action or actions in the name of
the People of the Philippines in the Court of First
Instance of the province where the bank is located,
in which shall be joined as parties the bank and such
creditors or depositors. All or any member of such
creditors or depositors or banks. may be included in
one action. (Emphasis supplied.)
Indeed, if the bank were not a real party in interest, the
legislature would not have provided for its joining as a party in
the escheat proceedings.
Besides, under Section 2, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court,
private respondent bank is a real party in interest as its pres ence
in the action is necessary for a complete determination and
settlement of the questions involved therein. Private respondent
bank being a real party in interest, it may and can file a motion
to dismias on the ground of improper venue."

CHAPTER XII
GENERAL GUARDIANS AND GUARDIANSHIP and
GUARDIANSHIP OF MINORS

Guardianship defined
Guardianship is a trust relation in which one person called
"guardian" acts for another called a "ward," whom the law regards as
incapable of managing his own affairs. A guardianship is designed
further the ward's well-being, not that of the guardian. It is intended
to preserve the ward's property, as well as to render any assistance
that the ward may personally require. In particular, a guardian iu
person in whom the law has entrusted the custody and control of the
person, estate, or both of an infant, insane. or other person incapable
of managing his own affairs. While custody involves immediate care
and control, guardianship indicates not only those responsibilities.
but those of one in loco parentis as well.'
Basis of guardianship

competent guardian may be removed
A guardian is or becomes incompetent to serve the trust if he
. so disqualified by mental incapacity, conviction of crime, moral
:elinquency or physical disability as to be prevented from properly
discharging the duties of his office. A guardian, once appointed
may be removed in case he becomes insane or otherwise incapable
of discharging his trust or unsuitable therefor, or has wasted or
mismanaged the estate, or failed for 30 days after it is due to render
an account or make a return. l
Factors in selecting guardian

Having in mind that guardianship proceeding is instituted
for the benefit and welfare of the ward, the selection of a guardian
must, therefore, suit this very purpose. Thus, in determining
the selection of a guardian, the court may consider the financial
situation, the physical condition, the sound judgment, prudence and
trustworthiness, the morals, character and conduct, and the present
and past history of a prospective appointee, as well as the probability
of his, being able to exercise the powers and duties of guardian for
the full period during which guardianship will be necessary.

Where minors are involved, the State acts as parens patriot
It is the duty of protecting the rights of persons or individuals who

Kinds of guardians
There are three kinds of guardians: (1) legal guardians, (2)
guardian ad litem, and (3) judicial guardian.
A legal guardian is such by provision of law without the need for
judicial appointment. For instance, parents are the legal guardians
over the persons of their minor children or in respect of their minor
children's property where the value does not exceed P50,000.00. A
guardian ad litem is a competent person appointed by the court for
purposes of a particular action or proceeding involving a minor. A
judicial guardian is a person appointed by the court for the person,
property, or both of the ward to represent the latter in all acts and
litigations.

In resolving whether to appoint a guardian ad litem for the

court has discretion in appointing a guardian ad litem that will
best promote the interest of justice. The appointment of a guardUJ11
ad litem is designed to assist the court in its determination of the
incompetent's best interest.'
Parents as guardians
When the property of the child under parental authority
is worth P2,000.00 or less, the father or the mother, without th,
necessity of court appointment, shall be his legal guardian. When
the property of the child is worth more than P2,000.00, the father
or the mother shall be considered guardian of the child's property,
with the duties and obligations of guardians these Rules, and shall
file the petition required by Section 2 hereof. For good reasons, the
court may, however, appoint another suitable person. (Rule 93, Se.
7) This is deemed to have been modified by the Family Code (E.0.
209). Article 225 thereof provides:
"Wh en the market value of the property or the annual
income of the child exceeds P50,000.00, the parent concerned
shall be required to furnish a bond in such amount as the court
may determine, but in no case less than ten percentum (10%) of
the value of such property or annual income, to guarantee the
performance of the obligations prescribed for general guardian,:

A similar provision is found in the Rule on Guardianship rl
Minors, particularly in Section 16 thereof, which states:
"Sec. 16. Bond of parents as guardians of property of the
minor.-- If the market value of the property or the annual
income of the child exceeds P50,000.00, the parent concerned
Rhall furniRh a bond in such amount as the court may determine.

Rule 93-- Appointment of Guardins

Jurisdictional facts
The jurisdictional facts that must be alleged in a petition for
appointment of a guardian are: (a) the incompetency of the person
for whom guardianship is sought; and (b) that the ward is domiciled
in the Philippines. Note, however, that the specific jurisdictional
facts that must be alleged in the petition would depend on whether
the proposed ward is an incompetent or a minor.

the person for whom letters

SEC, 8. Court to wet time for hearing. Notice
thereof. - When a petition for the appointment of a
general guardian is filed, the court shall fix a time
and place for hearing the same, and shall cause

sonable notice thereof to be given to the persons
re:ntioned in the petition residing in the province,
~eluding the minor if above l4 years of age or the
:ncompetent himself, and may direct other general
or special notice thereof to be given.
Notice of application and hearing
Unlike in other types of special proceedings, publication is
not required in a petition for appointment of guardians. A notice
of hearing of the petition served on the persons mentioned in the
petition who are residing in the Philippines and the incompetent
himself is sufficient for the court to acquire jurisdiction.
Notice jurisdictional

Service of notice upon the minor if 14 years of age or over or
upon the incompetent is jurisdictional. Without such notice, the
court acquired no jurisdiction to appoint a guardian. 10
The rules do not necessitate that creditors of the minor or
incompetent be likewise identified and notified. The reason is
simp!e: because their presence is not essential to the proceedings for
appointment of a guardian. They will only insist that the supposed
mnor or incompetent is actually capacitated to enter into contracts,
as to preserve the validity of said contracts and keep the supposed
aunor or mcompetent obligated to comply therewith. LL

guardian of his person or estate, or both, with the
powers and duties hereinafter specified.
luuance of letters of guardianship during pendency of appeal
In Francisco u. Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court upheld
the propriety of execution pending appeal in appointing respondent
as guardian to succeed petitioner while the latter's appeal was still
pending. Upon urgent and compelling reasons, execution pendinr
appeal is a matter of sound discretion on the part of the trial court.
and the appellate court will not interfere, control or inquire into the
exercise of this discretion, unless there bas been an abuse thereof
Inasmuch as the primary objective for the institution of guardianship
is for the protection of the ward, there is more than sufficient reason
for the immediate execution of the lower court's judgment for tbe
replacement of the first guardian. 1•
SEC. 6. When and how guardian for non·
resident appointed. Notice. - When a person liable
to be put under guardianship resides without the

Philippines but has estate therein, any relative or

a court having jurisdiction for the appointment
of a guardian for the estate, and if, after notice
given to such person and in such manner as the
court deems proper, by publication or otherwise,

guardian has been removed as such does not relieve him nor her

It is not necessary for a grant of authority to the guardian ta

to maintain the ward and his family or to maintain or educat-0 the

thereof.
SEC. 3. Guardian to settle accounta, collect
debts, and appear in actions for ward. - A guardian
must settle all accounts of his ward, and demand,
sue for, and receive all debts due him, or may, with
the approval of the court, compound for the same
and give discharges to the debtor, on receiving 8
fair and just dividend of the estate and effects; and
he shall appear for and represent his ward in all
actions and special proceedings, unless another
person be appointed for that purpose.
SEC. 4. Estate to be managed frugally, and
proceeds applied to maintenance of ward. - A
guardian must manage the estate of his ward frugally and without the waste, and apply the income
and profits thereof, so far as may be necessary, to
the comfortable and suitable maintenance of the
ward and his family, if there be any; and if such
income and profits be insufficient for that purpose,
the guardian may sell or encumber the real estate,

to such of the proceeds as may be necessary to such
maintenance.

Rule 96- General Powers and Duties of Guardi an,
h ll paea either real or personal property unless it is proved
]k~wed in accordance with the Rules of Cour" (AR T. 838,
id) An owner's intention to confer title in the future to persons
yessing property by his tolerance, is not inconsistent with the
= er's taking back possessto_n in ~he meantime for any re~son
deemed sufficient. And that in this case there was sufficient
cause for tho owner's resumption of pos session is apparent: she
needed to generate income from the house on account of the
physical infirmities afflicting her, arising from her extreme age.
Am paro Evangelista was appointed by a competent court
the general guardian of both the person and the estate of her
aunt, Carmen Caiz. Her Letters of Guardianship dated
Dece mber 19, 1989 clearly installed her as the "guardian over
the person and properties of the incompetent CARMEN CAN IZA with full authority to take possession of the property of said
incompetent i.n any province or provinces in which it may be
situated and to perform all other acts necessary for the management of her properties.." By that appointment, it bec ame
Evangelista's duty to care for her aunt's person, to attend to
her physical and spiritual needs, to assure her wellbeing, with
right to custody of her person in preference to relatives and
friends. It also became her right and duty to get possession of,
and exercise control over, Caiza's property, both real and personal, it being recognized principle that the ward has no right to
possession or control or his property during her incompetency.
That right to menage the ward's estate carries with it the right
to take possession thereo f and reco ver it from anyone who re•
tains it, and bring and defend such actions as may be need ful
for this purpo se.
Actually, in bringing the action of desahucio, Evangelista
was merely discharging the duty to attend to "the comfortable
and suitable maintenance of the ward.. explicitly imposed on her
by Section 4, Rule 96 or the Rules or Court, viz.:
Sec. 4. Estate to be managed frugally, and
proceeds applied to maintenance of ward. - A
guardian must manage the estate of his ward
frugally and without waste, and apply the income
end profits thereof, so far as maybe nece ssary, to
the comfortable and suitable maintenance of the
ward and his family, if there be any; and if such
""P e and profits be insufficient for that purpose,
e guardian may sell or encumber the real estate,
""P
P being authorized by order to do so, and apply
such of the proceed s as may be nece ssary to such
maintenance."

to a partition of real or personal estate held by the

such notice to relatives of the ward as the court
may direct, and a careful investigation as to the
necessity and propriety of the proposed action,

th determination of said title or right whether in favor of

property must be determined in a separate ordinary action and
not in guardianship proceedings.

SEC. 6. Proceedings when the person suspected
of embezzling or concealing property of ward. -Upon complaint of the guardian or ward, or of any
person having actual or prospective interest in the
estate of the ward as creditor, heir, or otherwise,
that anyone is suspected of having embezzled,
concealed, or conveyed away any money, goods, or
interest, or a written instrument, belonging to the
ward or his estate, the court may cite the suspected
person to appear for examination touching such
money, goods, interest. or instrument, and make
such orders as will secure the estate against such
embezzlement, concealment or conveyance.
As a general rule, a guardianship court has no power to order
the person suspected of embezzling or concealing property of the
ward to deliver the same to the court. A guardianship court only has
the power to cite such person to obtain information on the property."
"In Cui vs. Pieceio et al., supra, this Court held that the
jurisdiction of the court in guard.ionship proceedings, ordinarily,
is to cite persons suspected of having embezzled, concealed or
conveyed the property beloning to the ward for the purpose of
obtaining information which may be used in an action later to
be instituted by the f!Uardian to protect the right of the ward.
Generally, the guardianship court exercisinp special and limited
jurisdiction cannot actually order the delivery of the property
of the ward found to be embezzled, conceled or conveyed. In a
categorical language of this Court, only in extreme cases, where
property clearly belongs to the ward or where his title thereto
has been already judicially decided, may the court direct its
delivery to the guardian. In effect, there can only be delivery
or return of the embezzled, concealed or conveyed property

described in the first inventory shall be appraised.
In the appraisement the court may request the
assistance of one or more of the inheritance tax
appraisers. And whenever any property of the ward
not included in an inventory already rendered is
discovered, or succeeded to. or acquired by the
ward, like proceedings shall be had for securing an
inventory and appraisement thereof within three
(3) months after such discovery, succession, or
acquisition.
SEC. 8. When guardian 'a accounts presented

- Upon the expiration of a year from the time of
his appointment, and as often thereafter as may
be required, a guardian must present his account
to the court for settlement and allowance. In the
settlement of the account. the guardian, other
than a parent, shall be allowed the amount of his
reasonable expenses incurred in the execution
of his trust and also such compensation for his
"?ices as the court deems just, not exceeding
teen per centum of the net income of the ward.

Vancil v. Belmes
G.R. No. 132223, June 19, 2001
FACTS: Sometime in May of 1987, Bonifacia Vancil
commenced before the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City a
guardianship proceedings over the persons and properties of
minors Valerie und Vincent. At the time, Valene was only 6
ears old while Vincent was a 2-year old child. It is claimed in the
~etition that the minors are residents of Cebu City, Ph1lipp10es
and have an estate consisting of prcceeds from their father's
death pension benefits with a probable value of Pl00,000.00.
On July 15, 1987, petitioner Bonifacio Vancil was
appointed legal and judicial guardian over the persons and
estate of Valerie Vancil and Vincent Vancil, Jr.
On August 13, 1987, the natural mother of the minors,
Helen Belmes, submitted an opposition to the subject
guardianship proceedings as she had already filed a similar
petition for guardianship before the Regional Trial Court of
Pagadian City.
Thereafter, Helen Belmes followed her opposition with
a motion for the Removal of Guardian and Appointment of a
New One, asserting that she is the natural mother in actual
custody of and exercising parental authority over the subject
minors Rt Maralag, Dumingag, Zamboonga de! Sur where they

judicial order to the contrary. xx.

Valerie several times. But Valerie, being now of major age, is no
longer subject of this guard ianship proceeding.

Indeed , being the natural mother of minor Vinrent,
respondent has the corresponding natural and legal right to his
custod y. In Sagala-Eslao vu. Court of Appeals, this Court held:
"Of considerable importance is the rule long
accepted by the courts that 'the right of parents to the
custody of their minor children is one of the natural
rights incident to parenthood,' a right supported by
law and sound public policy. The right is an inherent
one, which is not created by the state or decisions
of the courts, but derives from the nature of the
parental relationship."
Petitioner's claim to be the guardian of said minor can only
be realized by way of substitute parental authority pursuant to
Art icle 214 of the Famil y Cod e, thus:
"Art . 214. In case of death, absence or
unsuitability of the parents, substitute parental
authority shall be exercised by the survi ving
gra ndparent. ox .
In Sanlos, Sr. u. Court of Appeals, this Court ruled:
Th e law vests on the father and mother joint
parental authority over the persons of their common
children. In case of absence or death of either parent,
the parent present shall continue exercising parental
authority. Only in case of the parents' death, absence
or unsuitability may substitute parental authority
be exercised by the surviving grandparent."
Petitioner, as the surviving grandparent, can exerci9e
substitute parental authority only in case of death, absence or
unsuitability of respondent. Considering that respondent is very
much alive and has exercised continuously pu-entnl authority
over Vincent, petitioner has to prove, in asserting her right to
be the minor's guardian, respondent's ummitnbility. Petitioner,
however, has not proffered convincing evidence showing that
respondent is not suited to he the guard inn of Vincent. Petitioner
merely insists that respondent is morally unfit ae guardian of
Valerie considering that her (respondent's) live-in partner raped

Rule 97- Termination of Guardianship

Even assuming that respondent is unfi t as guardian of
minor Vincent, still petitioner cannot qualify as a substitute
guardian. It bears stressing that she is an American citizen and
a resident of Colorado. Obviously, she will not be able to perform
the responsibilities and obligations required of a guardian. In
facet, in her petition, she admitted the difficulty of discharging
the duties of a guardian by an expatriate, like her. To be sure,
she will merely delegate those duties to someone else who may
not also qualify as a guardian.

SEC. 2. Who may petition for appointment of
guardian. - On grounds authorized by law, any
relative or other person on behalf of a minor, or the
minor himself if fourteen years of age or over, may
petition the Family Court for the appointment of a

Rule 97 Termination of Guardianship

SEC. 4. Grounds of petition. - The grounds for
the appointment of a guardian over the person or
property, or both, of a minor are the following:
(a) Death, continued absence, or incapacity
of his parents;

while the Rule on Guardianship of Minors provides guidelines
ht« appointment of such guardian, Rules 92-97 do not contain
",,liios on the qualifications which the court may consider in
dian. The qualifications were taken mainly from Francisco u.
1$;
5~zeals.i with the addition of relationship of trust and lack
of conflict of interest with the minor.

(b) Suspension, deprivation or termination
of parental authority;

Non-resident guardian• not to be appointed

(c) Remarriage of his surviving parent. if
the latter is found unsuitable to exercise parental
authority; or

In Vancil u. Belmes," the Supreme Court held that courts
should not appoint persons as guardians who ere not within the
jurisdiction of our courts for they will find it difficult to protect the
wards. Cited therein was the rationale in Guerrero s. Teran," viz.:

(d) When the best interests of the minor so
require.
Grounds for appointment of a guardian
Section 1, Rule 93 of the Rules of Court only mentions two
grounds for the appointment of a guardian - where the minor or
incompetent has no parent and where he has no lawful guardian.
More grounds are provided under Section 4 above, including •
general ground founded on the primordial purpose of guardianship
- when the best interests of the minor require.
SEC. 6. Qualifications of guardians. - In
appointing a guardian, the court shall consider the
guardian's:
(a)

Moral character;

(b)
(c)

mental

and

psychological

Financial status;

(d) Relationship of trust with the minor;
(e) Availability to exercise the powers and
duties of a guardian for the full period of the
guardianship;
(f)

Lack of conflict of interest with the minor.

and

(g) Ability to manage the property of the
minor.

"Notwithstanding the fact that there is nothing in the
law which requires the courts to appoint residents only as
administrators or guardians, the courts, charged with the
responsibilities of protecting the estates of deceased persons,
wards of the estate, etc., will find much difficulty in complying
with this duty by appointing administrators and guardians who
are not personally subject to their jurisdiction."
SEC. 6. Who may be appointed guardian of the
person or property, or both, of a minor.- In default
of parents or a court-appointed guardian, the court
may appoint a guardian of the person or property,
or both, of a minor, observing as far as practicable,
the following order of preference:
(a) The surviving grandparent and in case
several grandparents survive, the court shall
select any of them taking into account all relevant
considerations;
(b) The oldest brother or sister of the minor
:~er twenty-one years of age, unless unfit or
1squalified;

..

(c) The actual custodian of the minor over

Order of preference In appointment of a guardian
The above order of preference was lifted from Article 216 cl
the Family Code. However, the last item ("any person, who in tk

enumerated do not qualify as guardians.
Also, the application of Article 216 was extended to guardian.

following.
(1)

Persons mentioned in the petition residing in the
Philippines; and

(2)

The minor if he is 14 years of age or over.

Where the minor is at least 14 years old, service of notice
upon such minor is jurisdictional, without which the court does not
acquire jurisdiction over the petition.
SEC. 9. Case •tudy report. - The court shall
order a social worker to conduct a case study of
the minor and all the prospective guardians and
submit his report and recommendation to the court
for its guidance before the scheduled hearing. The
social worker may intervene on behalf of the minor

Grounds for termination of guardianship
There are only two grounds for termination of guardianship:
(1)

the ward has come of age (emancipation); or

(2)

the ward h.. died

Emancipation takes place when the ward turns 18.
Before the amendment of Article 234 of the Family Cod
emancipation also took place by the marriage of the minor o
the recording in the Civil Registry of an agreement in a pub
instrument executed by the parents exercising parental auth~
and the minor at least 18 years of age. Republic Act No.
(approved on December 18, 1989) amended this Article by limitifi
emancipation to only one ground
attainment of age of msjo",
and lowering the majority age from 21 to 18. Thus, termination "
guardianship does not include marriage of the minor and volunt
emancipation as grounds.

,,"
,",""sou4 Ju4omsnot ty the court in tho +ointment,
We learn from Lorenzo u. Posadas1 that a probate court m
exercise sound judgment in appointing a trustee to carry into e(T=
the provisions of the will - where a trust is actually created by
the will by the provision that certain of the property shall be le
together undisposed during a fixed period and for a stated purPl»t.

Acquiring the trust by prescription
While a trust may be created by provisions in a testator's will
a trustee may acquire the trust by prescription provided there is
a repudiation of the trust, such repudiation being open, clear u~
unequivocal, known to the cestui qui trust.'
Rule 98 applies only to express trust, one which is created by
will or written instrument, and not to an implied trust, which is
deducible from the nature of the transaction as a matter of inten~
or which are superinduced on the transaction by operation of la•
as matters of equity, independent of the particular intention of the
parties.'
Distinguished from executor or administrator
A trustee, like an executor or administrator, holds an of6ct
of trust, particularly when the trustee acts as such under judicial
authority. The executor's or administrator's duties are, however.
fixed or limited by law, while those ofthe trustee: ore usually governt4
by the intention of the trustor or the parties, if it is established by
contract. A trustee's duties generally cover a wider range than th0st
of executors or administrators of the estate.

Extent of authority of trustee
The powers of a trustee appointed by a Philippine court cannot
extend beyond the confines of the territory of the Republic of th,
Philippines. This is based on the principle that his authority cannot
extend beyond the jurisdiction of the country under whose courts be
was appointed.
Also, in the execution of trusts, the trustee is bound to comply
with the directions contained in the trust instrument defining the
extent and limits of his authority, and the nature of his power and
duties.

CHAPTER XIV
ADOPTION
concept of adoption
Adoption is defined es the process of making a child, whether
related or not to the adopter, possess in general, the rights accorded
to a legitimate child. Adoption is a juridical act, a proceeding in rem
which creates between two persons a relationship similar to that
which results from legitimate paternity and filiation. The modern
trend is to consider adoption not merely as an act to establish a
relationship of paternity and fliation, but also as an act which endows
the child with a legitimate status. This was, indeed, confirmed in
1989, when the Philippines, as a State Party to the Convention of
the Rights of the Child initiated by the United Nations, accepted
the principle that adoption is impressed with social and moral
responsibility, and that its underlying intent is geared to favor the
adopted child.'
The relationship established by the adoption, however, is
limited to the adopting parent, and does not extend to his other
relatives, except as expressly provided by law. Thus, the adopted
child cannot be considered as a relative of the ascendants and
collaterals of the adopting parents, nor of the legitimate children
which they may have after the adoption, except that the law imposes
certain impediments to marriage by reason of adoption. Neither
are the children of the adopted considered as descendants of the
adopter. The relationship created is exclusively between the adopter
and the adopted, and does not extend to the relatives of either. As
a. consequence, the adopted is an heir of the adopter but not of the
relatives of the adopter.

-

M The act of adoption fixes a status, i.e., that of parent and child.

Nature of adoption
In an adoption case which involves the status of a person, the"
is no particular defendant to speak of since the action is one in rem
In such case, jurisdiction over the person of the defendant is a non.
essential condition for the taking of a deposition for the jurisdiction
of the court is based on its power over the res, to render judgment
with respect to such "thing (or status, as in this case) so as to bar
indifferently all who might be minded to make an objection against
the right so established.•
Adoption is a proceeding in rem, which no court may entertain
unless it has jurisdiction, not only over the subject matter of the
case and over the parties, but also over the res, which is the personal
status of the parties. Our Civil Code adheres to the theory that
jurisdiction over the status of a natural person is determined by th,
latter's nationality. Personal status, in general, is determined by
and/or subject to the jurisdiction of the domiciliary law.
Purpose of adoption
Adoption used to be for the benefit of the adaptor. It was
intended to afford persons who have no child of their own the
consolation of having one by creating thru legal fiction the relation of
paternity and fliation where none exists by blood relationship. Th,
present tendency, however, is geared more toward the promotion or
the welfare of the child, and enhancement of his opportunities for 1
useful and happy life.•
It is the state's policy to ensure that every child remains under
the care and custody of his parents and is provided with love, cart,

Under the law now in force, having legitimate, legitimated,
acknowledged natural children or children by legal fiction is no
longer a ground for disqualification to adopt.
How adoption statutes construed
The main purpose of adoption statutes is the promotion of the
welfare ofchildren. Accordingly, the law should be construed liberally,
in a manner that will sustain rather than defeat this purpose. The
law must also be applied with compassion, understanding and less
severity in view of the fact that it is intended to provide homes, love,
care and education for less fortunate children.'
Adoption statutes, being humane and salutary, hold the
interests and welfare of the child to be of paramount consideration.
They arc designed to provide homes, parental care and education
for unfortunate, needy or orphaned children and give them the
protection or society and family in the person of the adopter, as well
as for childless couples or persons to experience the joy of parenthood
and give them legally a child in the person of the adopted for the
manifestation of their natural parent instincts. Every reasonable
intendment should be sustained to promote and fulfill these noble
and compassionate objectives of the law."

Simulation of child's birth In lieu of adoption
It has become a practice in recent times for people who want to
avoid the expense and trouble of a judicial adoption to simply register
the child as their supposed child in the civil registry. Defritely,
the mere registration of a child in his or her birth certificate as
the child of the supposed parents is not a valid adoption, does no
confer upon the child the status of an adopted child and the legal
rights of such child, and even amounts of simulation of the child'1
birth or falsification of his or her birth certificate, which is a publx
document.
Simulation Birth Rectification Act
The Simulated Birth Rectification Act (Republic Act No.
11222), which took effect on March 29, 2019, grants amnesty to
individuals who falsified civil registry records to make it appear
a child's birth record that the child was born to a woman who is Dci
the biological mother, thereby causing the loss of the child's tr

adoption procedure to rectify the status and fliation of a child wbost

G.R. No. 248035, November 27, 2019
FACTS: Petitioners filed a petition for domestic adoption
of a minor child with the Regions} Trial Court of Makati.
However, the RTC held that since petitioners are both foreigners,
then the petition for adoption presented a proper case of inter•
country adoption, instead of considering said petition as being
appropriately filed under the Domestic Adoption Act of 1998.
Thus, the RTC directed the transmittal of a copy of the petition
and its annexes to the Inter-Country Adoption Board (ICAB) for
appropriate action.
Did the RTC act correctly in referring the adoption case to th
/CAB?

HELD: NO. Petitioners, who are both American citizens,
have been residing and have been gainfully employed in the
Philippines since the year 2007 (in the case of petitioner Park)
and since 2009 (in the case of petitioner Lee), and are thus living
in the Philippine-a for at least three continuou yeare prior to the
filing of the petition for adoption, as required. by the Domestic
Adoption Act.
In view of the foregoing. this Court finds that petitioners'
Petition for Adoption was appropriately fled under the Domestic
Adoption Act in order for tho appropriute Family Court RTC
to take cognizance thereof.
Since the case appropriately falls under the Domesti
Adoption Act, it is for the best interest ofthe child that the instant

326

The provision on joint adoption by spouses is mandatory. As
feral rule, the husband and wife must fle a joint petition for
option. This is in consonance with the concept of joint parental
authority over the child which is the ideal situation. As the child
to be adopted is elevated to the level of a legitimate child it is but
:atural to require the spouses to adopt jointly The rule also insures
armony between the spouses."
in jo• Thedfilin.g of a case for dissolution of the marriage is irrelevant
of ~nt ~ option cases. It is not equivalent to a decree of dissolution
.Until and unless there is a judicial decree for the
ease,,,"""rise. the marriage still subsists. That beine
option by the husband and the wife is required.

Section 7(c), Article III of RA 8562 and Article 185 of the Family
Code.

(ii) one who seeks to adopt the legitimate son/
daughter of his/her Filipino spouse; or
(iii) one who is married to a Filipino citizen and
seeks to adopt jointly with his/her spouse a relative within

Filipino spouses; or

May petitioner, who has remarried, singly adopt?
HELD: NO. It is undisputed that, at the time the petition
for adoption were filed, petitioner had already remarried.
She fled the petitions by herself, without being joined by her
husband Olario. We have no other recourse but to affirm the
trial court's decision denying the petitions for adoption. Dura

petitioner.
. .
Petitioner, in her Memorandum, insists that subsequent
entag would show that joint adoption could no longer be possible
_e olario has fled a case for dissolution of his marriage to
petitioner in the Los Angeles Superior Court.

The use of the word "shall" in the above-quoted provision
means that joint adoption by the husband and the wife i
mandatory. This is in consonance with the concept of joint
parental authority over the child which is the ideal situation.
As the child to be adopted is elevated to the level of a legitimate
child, it is but natural to require the spouses to adopt jointly.
The rule also insures harmony between the spouses.

We disagree. The filing of a case for dissolution of the
marriage between petitioner and Olario is of no moment. It
is not equivalent to a decree of dissolution of marriage. Until
d unless there is a judicial decree for the dissolution of the
~arriage between petitioner and Olario, the marriage still
subsists. That being the case, joint adoption by the husband and
the wife is required. We reiterate our ruling above that since,
at the time the petitions for adoption were filed, petitioner was
married to Olario, joint adoption is mandatory.

The law is clear. There is no room for ambiguity. Petitioner,
having remarried at the time the petitions for adoption were
filed, must jointly adopt. Since the petitions for adoption were
filed only by petitioner herself, without joining her husband,
Olario, the trial court was correc t in denying the petitions for
adoption on this ground.

In ease husband and wife jointly adopt or one spouse
adopts the illegitimate child of the other, joint parental authority
hall be exercised by the spouses. Parental authority includes
caring for and rearing the children for civic consciousness and
dficiency and the development of their moral, mental and
physical character and well-being."

Neither does petitioner fall under any of the three
exceptions enumerated in Section 7. First, the children to be
adopted are not the legitimate children of petitioner or of her
husband Olario. Second, the children are not the illegitimate
children of petitioner. And third, petitioner and Olario are not
legally separated from each other.

Whose consent nece ssary

The fact that Olario gave his consent to the adoption
as shown in his Affidavit of Consent does not suffice. There
are certain requirements that Olario must comply, being an
American citizen. He must meet the qualifications set forth in
Section 7 of RA 8552 such as: (1) he must prove that his country
has diplomatic relations with the Republic of the Philippines;
(2) he must have been living in the Philippines for at least three
continuous years prior to the filing of the application for adoption;
(3) he must maintain such residency until the adoption decree
is entered; (4) he has legal capacity to adopt in his own country;
and (5) the doptee is allowed to enter the adopter's country
as the latter's adopted child. None of these qualifications were
shown and proved during the trial.
These requirements on residency and certification of the
alien's qualification to adopt cannot likewise be waived pursuant
to Section 7. The children or adoptees are not relatives within
the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity of petitioner or
of Olario. Neither arc the adoptees the legitimate children

Caatro u. Gregorio
G.R. No. 188801, October 15, 2014

The general requirement of consent and notice to the natu a]
parents is intended to protect the _natural parental relations~
from unwarranted interference by interlopers, and to insure 4,
opportunity to safeguard the best interests of the child in th
manner of the proposed adoption. Clearly, the written consent;
the biological parents is indispensable for the validity of a decree ri
adoption. Indeed, the natural right of a parent to his child requires
that his consent must be obtained before his parental rights and
duties may be terminated and re-established in adoptive parenu.u
While the Domestic Adoption Act requires the written consent of
the adoptee's biological parents, the Supreme Court has clarified
that even if the biological parents arc known, their consent ia not
required if they have abandoned the child."

FACTS: Atty. Jose Castro (Jose) is the estranged husband
fRos »ro Castro (Rosario) and father ofJoanne. In August 2000,
~ ~cd O petition for adoption over Jose Maria Jed Lemuel
1
ded) and Ana Maria Reina Gregorio Regina), his
.date children with Lilibeth Gregorio Lilibeth)., whom
Rosaro alleged was his housekeeper. dose was 70 years old at
the time of the filing of the petition.
The Social Welfare Officer conducted a Home Study
Report. At the time of the report, Jose was living with Jed and
Regina temporarily. The children have allegedly bei?n in _his
custody since Lilibeth's death in 1995. The trial court approved
the adoption having ruled that the court received no opposition
from any person. A certificate of finality was thereafter issued.

Abandonment means neglect and refusal to perform the filial
and legal obligations of love and support. If a parent withhold
presence, love, care, the opportunity to display filial affectioa
and neglects to lend support and maintenance, the parent, in
effect, abandons the child.e Thus, merely permitting the child to
remain for a time undisturbed in the care of others is not such an
abandonment. Section 9 of Republic Act No. 8552 provides that if
the written consent of the biological parents cannot be obtained, the
written consent of the legal guardian of the minors will suffice.

A few months later, Rosario filed a complaint for
disbarment against Jose, alleging that Jose had been remiss
in providing support for their daughter for the past 36 years.
She claims that Jose had been showering gifts to his driver and
alleged lover, Larry, and even went to the extent of adoption
Larry's two children, Jed and Regino, without her and Joanne's
knowledge and consent. Jose denied being remiss in his duties
to Joanne during her minority. He said he always offered help,
but it was often declined. He also asserted that he adopted Jed
and Regina because they are his illegitimate children. Jose died
a few months later.

In a situation where a spouse seeks to adopt his or her own
children born out of wedlock, joint adoption is not necessal')'.
However, the spouse seeking to adopt. must first obtain the consent
of his or her spouse, notwithstanding if the spouses are separated
de facto.

• In2007, Rosario and Joanne filed a petition for annulment
Jud.cment. seeking to annul the court's order approving the
~option of Jed and Regina. Rosario and Joanne ~Ueged that
ey learned of the adoption in 2005, and that Rosario's affidavit
Ponsent was fraudulent. They also allege that Jed and Reina's
t;:ih certificates showed different sets of information, such as
The age of their mother, Lilibeth, at the time she gave birth.
"[''Rue that one set of birth certificates states the father to
•h~ ose ~nd in another set of National Statistic Office certificates

no,,,""" Alleged that Jed and Regina are not actually Jose's
lane,,""children but the legitimate children of Lilibeth and
w ci were marned at the time of their birth.

The law also requires the written consent of the adopter'J
children if they are 10 years old or older. The consent f the
adopter's other children is necessary as it ensures harmony amonr
the prospective siblings. It also sufficiently puts the other children
on notice that they will have to share their parent's love and care, as
well as their future legitimes, with another person.

Petitioners argue that the adoption of illegitimate
children requires the consent, not only of the spouse, but also
the legitimate children 10 yea re or over of the adopter, and such
conse nt was never sec ured from Joanne.
Respondents argu e in their comment that petitioners could
not have bee n deprived of their day in court Hince their interest
was "amply protected by the participation and representation of
the Solicitor General through the deputized public prosec utor."
Respondents also argue that there was constructive notice
through publication for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper
of general circulation, which constitutes not only notice to them
but also notice to the world of the adoption proceedings. They
argu e that since the alleged fraud was perpetrated during the
trial, it cannot be said to be extrinsic fraud but intrinsic fraud,
which is not a gro und for annulment of judgment. They also
argu e that petitioners were not indispensable parties because
adoption is an action in rem and, as such, the only indispensable
part y is the state.
Should the court have notified the petitioners of the
adoption?
HELD: YES. It is settled that "the jurisdiction or the
court is determined by the statute in force at the time of the
commencement of the action." As dose filed the petition for
adoption on August 1, 2000 , it is Republic Act No. 8552 which
applies over the proceedings. The law on adoption requires
that the adoption by the father of a child born out of wedlock
obtain not only the consent of his wife but also the consent of his
legi timate children.
Under Art icle JJI. Sec tion 7 of Republic Act No. 85652, the
husband must first obtain the consent of his wife if he see ks to
adopt his own children born out of wedlock:

"

In the absence of any decree of legal separation or
annulment, Jose and Rosario remained legally married
despite their de facto separation. For Jose
be eligible to
adopt Jed and Regina, Rosario must first signify her consent
to the adoption. Jose, however, did not validly obtain Rosario a
consent. His submission of a fraudulent affidavit of consent in
her name cannot be considered compliance of the requisites of
the Jaw. Had Rosario been given notice by the trial court of the
proceedings, she would have had a reasonable opportunity to
contest the validity of the affidavit. Since her consent was not
obtained, dose was ineligible to adopt.

Where the petition for adoption includes a prayer for a change

state the following:

Complete name which the adoptee will use if the petition
is granted;

(4)

Date and place of hearing which shall be set within 6
months from the date of the issuance of the order and shall
direct that a copy thereof be published before the date of

reports had not been attached to the petition due to
unavailability at the time of the filing of the latter; and

Since the trial court failed to personally serve notice on
Rosario and Joanne of the proceedings. it never validly acquired
jurisdiction.

(1)

The registered name of the child;

(2)

(3)

The full name by which the child is to be known. (Sec. 10)

The law allows the adoptee, as a matter of right and obligation,
to bear the surname of the adopter, upon issuance of the decree of
adoption. It is the change of the adoptee's surname to follow that
of the adopter which is the natural and necessary consequence of a
grant of adoption and must specifically be contained in the order of
the court, in fact, even if not prayed for by petitioner.
However, the given or proper name, also known as the first or
Christian name, of the adoptee must remain as it was origina.11)'
registered in the civil register. The creation of an adoptuv
relationship does not confer upon the adopter a license to change the
adoptee's registered Christian or first name. The automatic chan~
thereof, premised. solely upon the adoption thus granted, is be.yon
the purview of a decree of adoption. Neither is it a mere incident
in nor an adjunct of an adoption proceeding, such that a pra!

cannot properly be granted.

of the Family Cod e, as amended by Republic Act No. 9255, oh.
erwise known as "An Act Allowing Illegitimate Children to he
the Surname of Their Father," is silent as to what middle name
a child may use.
The middle name or the mother's surname is only
considered in Article 375(1), quoted above, in case there i
identity of names and surnamt'S between ascendants and
descendants. in which case, the middle name or the mother's
surn ame shall be added.
Notably, the law is likewise silent as to what middle
name an adoptee may use. Art icle 365 of the Civil Code merely
provides that "an adopted child shall bea r the surname of the
adopter." Also, Art icle 189 of the Family Code, enumerating the
legal effects of adoption, is likewise silent on the matter, thus:
(D) For civil purpo ses , the adopted shall be
deemed to be a legitimate child of the adopters
and both shall acquire the reciprocal rights and
obligations arising from the relationship of parent
and child. including the right of the adopted to

However, as correctly pointed out by the OSG, the
members of the Civil Code and Family Law Committees that
drafted the Family Code recognized the Filipino custom of
adding the surname of the child's mother as his middle name.
In the case of an adopted child, the law provides that "the
adopted shall bear the surname of the adopters." Again, it ii
silent whether he can use a middle name. What it only expressly
allows, as a matter of right and obligation, is (or the adoptee to
bear the surname of tbe adopter, upon issuance of the decree of
adoption.
Adoption is defined as the process of making a child,
whether related or not to the adopter, po Mse llS in general,
the rights accorded to a legitimate child. It is a juridical
act, a proceeding in rem which create, between two persona
a relationship similar to tha t which results from legitimate
paternity and fliation. The modern trend is to consider adoption
not merely as an act to establish a relationship of paternity
and fliatin, but also as an act which endows the child with a
legitimate status. This was, indeed, confirmed in 1989, when th e
Philippines, as a State Party to the Convention or the Rights or
the Child initiated by the United Nations, accepted the prin~i_p lc
that adoption is impressed with soc ial and moral responsihihtY,
and that its underlying intent is geared to favor the adopted

.

Republic Act No. 8562, otherwis e known as the "Domestic

],~» Aa or 1998." sec ures these rights and privileges for
the adopted .
One of the effects of adoption is that the adopted is
di
ed to be a legitimate child of the adopter for all intents
,~lo ses vursuant to Ar icle 189 of the Family Code and
Section 17, Article V of RA 8552.
Being a legitimate child by virtue of her adoption, it
follows that Stephanie ii; entitled to all the rights provided by law to a legitimate child without discrimination
of any kind, including the right to bear the surname
of her father and her mother, as discussed above. This is
consistent with the intention of the members of the Civil Code
and Family Law Committees as earlier discussed. In fact, it is a
Filipino custom that the initial or surname of the mother should
immediately precede the surname of the father.
Additionally, as aptly stated by both parties, Stephanie's
continued use of her mother's surname (Garcia) as her middle
name will maint11in her maternal lineage. Article 189(3) of
the Family Code and Section 18 Article V of RA 8552 (law on
adoption) provide that the adoptee remains an intestate heir
of his/her biological parent. Hence, Stephanie can well assert
or claim her hereditary rights from her natural mother in the
future.
Moreover, reco rds show that Stephanie and her mother
are living together in the house built by petitioner for them at
:,90 Tuma~a. San Jose. B.11li_u .11g, Bulacan. Petitioner provides
or all their needs. Stephanie is closely attached to both her
n4father. she cans therm "M aw " and "Poma." indeed ,

RESCISSION OF ADOPTION

Republic Act No. 8552 has unqualifiedly withdrawn from an
adopter a consequential right to rescind the adoption decree. ft
is still noteworthy, however, that an adopter, while barred from
severing the legal ties of adoption, can always for valid reasons
cause the forfeiture of certain benefits otherwise accruing to an
undeservi ng child. For instance, upon the grounds recognized by
Jaw, an adopter may deny to an adopted child his legitime and, bya
will and testament, may freely exclude him from having a share in
the disposable portion of his estate.2•

Who may file
A petition for the rescission of adoption may only be filed by the
following individuals:
(1)

The adopted who is at least 18 years of age;

(2)

With the assistance of the Department of Social Welfel'!
and Development, if the adopted child is still a minor: or

(3)

The legal guardian or counsel if the adopted is over I
years of age but is incapacitated.

GR. No. 143939, July 14, 2003

FACTS: In 1972, Dr. Diosdado Lahom and Isabelita
Lahom legally adopted her nephew Jose Melvin Sibulo I
keeping with the court order, the Civil Registrar of Naga Ci!
changed the name "Jose Melvin Sibulo" to "'Jo~e Melvin Lohom-

In December 1999, Mrs. Lahom commenced a petition
ind the decree of adoption before the Regional Trial
~ r;:c(RTC), Branch 22, of Naga City. In her petition, she
red that -- "despite the proddings and pleadings of said
ses, respondent refused to change his surname from
,j o Lahom, to the frustrations of petitioner particularly
I
h husband until the latter died" and that "respondent's only
ve to his adoption is his expectancy of his alleged rights
over the properties. of herein petitioner find her late husband,
dearly shown by his recent filing of Civil Case No. 99·446:l for
partition against petitioner, thereby totally eroding her love and
affection towards respondent."
Upon Jose Melvin's motion, the RTC dismissed the
petition.
May the subject adoption, decreed on May 5, 1972, sill be
revoke d or rescinded by an adopter after the effectivity of R.A.
No. 8552?
HELD: NO. Prior to the institution of the case, spec ifically
on March 22, 1998, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 8552, also known as
the Domestic Adoption Act, went into effect. The new statute
deleted from the law the right of adopters to rescind a decree of
adoption. Sec tion 19 of Article VJ of R.A. No. 8552 reads:
"SEC. 19. Grounds for Rescission of Adoption.

In Republic u. Court of Appeals, a petition to adopt Jason
Condat was filed by Zenaida C. Bobiles on 02 February 198g
when the Child and Youth Welfare Code (Presidential Decree
No. 603) allowed an adoption to be sought by either spouse or
both of them. After the trial court had rendered its decision
and while the case was still pending on appeal, the Family
Code of the Philippines (Executive Order No. 209), mandating
joint adoption by the husband and wife, took effect. Petitioner
Republic argued that the COM should be dismissed for having
been filed by Mrs. Bobiles alone and without being joined by
the husband. The Court concluded that the jurisdiction of the
court ii. determined by the statute in force at the time of the
commencement of the action. The petition to adopt Jason,
having been filed with the court at the time- when P.D. No. 603
was still in effect, the right of Mrs. Bobiles to file the petition,
without being joined by her husband, according to the Court had
become vested.
In Republic v. Miller, Claude and Jumrus Miller, both
aliens. sought to adopt Michael M11d11yag. On 29 July 1988, the
couple filed a petition to formalize Michael's adoption having
theretofore been taken into their care. Al the time the action
was commenced, PD. No. 603 allowed aliens to adopt. Afer
the decree of adoption and while on appeal before the Court ol
Appeals, the Family Code was enacted into law on 08 August
1988 disqualifying aliens from adopting Filipino children. The
Republic then prayed for the withdrnwal of the adoption decree.
In discarding the argument posed by the Republic. the Supreme
Court ruled that the controversy should be resolved in the light of
the law governing at the time the pellllon woe filed.
It was months after the effectivity of R.A. No. 8552 that
herein petitioner filed un action to revoke the decree of adoption
granted in 1975. By then, the new law, hod already nbrognted
and repealed the right of an adopter under the Civil Code and
the Family Code to rescind a decree of adoption. Consistently
with it.A earlier pronouncements, the Court should now hold
that the action for rescission of the adoption decree, having been
initiated by petitioner after R.A. No. 8552 had come into force,
no longor couJd be pursued.
Interestingly, even before the passage of the statute, an
action to set aside the adoption is subject to the fve.year bi
rule under Rule 100 of the Rules of Court and that the adopter
would lose the right to revoke the adoption decree after the lapse

Matters relating to adoption, including the withdrawal of the
right of an adopter to nullify the adoption decree, are subject to
regulation by the State. Concomitantly, a right of action given
by statute may be taken away at any time before it has been
exercised.

While R.A. No. 8552 has unqualifiedly withdrawn from
1n adopter a consequential right to rescind the adoption decree
even in cases where the adoption might dearly turn out to be
undesirable. it remains, nevertheless, the bounden duty of the
Court to apply the law. Dura ler sed lex would be the hackneyed
truism that those caught in the law have to live with. It is
still noteworthy, however, that an adopter, while barred from
severing the legal ties of adoption. can always for valid reasons
cause the forfeiture of certain benefits otherwise accruing to an
undeserving child. For instance, upon the grounds recognized by
law, an adopter may deny to an adopted child his legitime and,
by a will and testament, may freely exclude him from having a
share in the disposable portion of his estate.
Grouncta for rescission
Adoption may be rescinded based on four grounds, namely:
(I)
Repeated physical and verbal maltreatment by the
adopter despite having undergone counseling;

JUDICIAL APPROVAL OF VOLUNTARY RECOG NITION
OF MINOR NATURAL CHILDREN

SEC. t. Venue. Where judicial approval of a
voluntary recognition of a minor natural child is
required, such child or his parents shall obtain the
same by filing a petition to that effect with the Court
of First Instance of the province in which the child
resides. In the City of Manila, the petition shall be
filed in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court.
Application of Rule 105

Rule 105 applies to judicial approval of a voluntary recognitio1
of a minor natural child. The petition may be filed by the minor
himself or the recognizing parent. A natural child is one born
outside of wedlock of parents who, at the time of the conception
the former, were not disqualified by any impediment to marry each
other.'
It beers noting that the Family Code has limited th
classification of children to legitimate and illegitimate, there!
eliminating the category of acknowledged natural children and
natural children by legal fiction}
Section 1 of Rule 106 applies "where judicial approval oh
voluntary recognition of a minor natural child is required." Under
Article 172 of the Family Code, judicial approval of a volunt':7
recognition is not required where recognition is made in any f dt

a final judgment,
an admission in a public instrument, and
a private handwritten instrument signed by the parent
concerned

The Supreme Court, construing Article 172 of the Family Code,
made the following pronouncement in De desus v. Estate of Dizon:
The fliation of illegitimate children, like legitimate
children, is established by (d) the record of birth appearing
the civil register or a final judgement; or (2) an admission
of legitimate fliation in a public document or a private
handwritten and signed by the parent concerned. In the absence
thereof, fliation shall be proved by (1) the open and continuous
possession of the status of a legitimate child; or (2) any other
means allowed by the Rules of Court and special laws. The due
recognition of an illegitimate child in a record of birth, a will, a
statement before a court or reco rd, or in any authentic writing
is, in itself, a consummated act of acknowledgement of the child,
and no further court action is required. In fact, any writing is
treated not just a ground for compulsory recognition; it is in itself
voluntary recognition that does not require a separate action
for judicial approval. Where, instead, a claim for recognition is
predicted on other evidence merely tending to prove paternity,
i.e., outside of a record of birth, a will, a statement before a court
or reco rd or en authentic writing, judicial action within the
applicable statute of limitations is essential in order to establish
the child's acknowledgement."

xxx does not itse lf constitute an acknowledgment; it is only
ro und for the child to compel, by judicial action, recognition by
his assumed parent."

Voluntary vis-a-vls compulsory recognition
The distinction between voluntary and compulsory recogi t

was delineated in Gapusan-Chua u. Court of Appeals:'
recognit ion 'is an admission of the fact of
"Voluntary
paternity or maternity by the presumed pnrcnt, upressed in the
form prescribed by the Ci,,il Code. IL<i essence lies in th1! avowal
of the parent that the child is his: the form».lity is add@d to
make the admission incontcstublc, in view of its consequences.'
The form is prescribed by Art icle 278 of the Civil Code, earlier
adverted to; it provides that a voluntary recognition 'shall be
made in the reco rd of birth, a will, a statement before a court of
reco rd, or in any authentic writing.'
Compulsory recognition is sometimes also called judicial
recognition, to distinguish it from that which is a purely
voluntary act of the parent. It is recognition decreed by final
judgment of a competent court. It is governed by Articles 283
and 284, setting forth the cases in which the father or mother.
respectively, is obliged to recognize a natural child, and Article
285 providing that generally, the action for recognition of
natural children may be brought only during the lifetime of the
presumed parents.

SEC. 2. Contents of petition. -- The petition
for judicial approval of a voluntary recognition of
a minor natural child shall contain the following
allegations:

petition.

pen to file action
Arieles 173 and 175 of the Family Code provide when the
action to claim legitimacy may be filed.
"'Art. 173. The action to claim legitimacy may be brought
b the child during his or her lifetime and shall be transmitted
the heirs should the child die during minority or in a state
or insanity. In these cases, the heirs shall have a period of five
years within which to institute the action.

i

Art. 175. Illegitimate children may establish their
illegitimate fliation in the same way and on the same evidence
as legitimate children.
The action must be brought within the same period
specified in Article 173, except when the action is based on the
second paragraph of Article 172, in which case the action may be
brought during the lifetime of the alleged parent."
This was elucidated in Uyguanco v. Court of Appeals,' viz.:
"The problem of the private respondent is that, since he
seeks to prove his flition under the second paragraph of Article
172 of the Family Code, his action is now barred becuse of his
alleged father's death in 1975. The second paragraph of Article
175 reads as follows:
The action must be brought within the same

172, in which case the action may hf! brought during

of her voluntary recognition, the evidence shows that she ha
in fact consented thereto. Her consent to her recognition is not
only implicit from her failure to impugn it at any time before
her mother's death, but is made clearly manifest and conclusive
by her assertion of that recognition in the judicial proceeding
for the settlement of her mother's estate as basis for her nght
thereto. Assuming on the other hand, that she was a minor at
the time of her recognition, and therefore judicial approval of
the recognition was m.-ccssnry, the absence thereof wag cured
by her ratification of that recognition, after having reached
the age of majority. by her initiation of the proceedings for the
settlement of her deceased mother's estate on the claim precisely
that she was the decedent's acknowledged natural daughter.
The requirement of judicial approval imposed by Article 281 is
clearly intended for the benefit of the minor. 'The lack of judicial
approval cannot impede the effectivity of the acknowledgment
made. The judicial approval is for the protection of the minor
against any acknowledgment made to his prejudice.' 'Therefore,
the lack, or insufficiency of such approval is NOT a defect
available to the reco gnizing parent but one which the minor may
raise or waive.' If after reaching majority the minor consents to
the acknowledgment, the lack of judicial approvnl should make
no difference. Implied consent to the acknowledgment may be
shown (e.g..) by such acts as keeping, even after reaching the
age of majority, the acknowledgment papers and the use of the
parent's surname.

Under Articles 152 and 163 of the Family Code, a family home
is deemed constituted on a house and lot from the time it is occupied
as a family residence. Indeed, there is no need to constitute the
same judicially or extrajudicially as required in the Civil Code. If
the family actually resides in the premises, it is, therefore, a family
home as contemplated by law. Th us, the creditors should take the
necessary precautions to protect their interest before extending
credit to the spouses or head of the family who owns the home."
Art icles 152 and 153 of the Family Code state:
"Art . 152. The family home, constituted jointly by the
husband and the wife or by an unmarried head of a family, is
the dwelling house where they and their family reside, and the
land on which it is situated.
Art. 153. The family home is deemed constituted on a houee
and lot from the time it is occupied as a family residence. Fro m
the time of its constitution and so long a any of its beneficiaries
actually resides therein, the family home continues to be such
and is exempt from execution, forced sale or attachment except

At the execution sale, no bid below the value allowed for a
family home shall be considered. The proc eeds shall be applied
first to the amount mentioned in Article 157, and then to the
liabilities under the judgment and the costs. The excess, if any,
ah all be delivered to the judgment debtor.

De Mesa v. Acero 17 summarized the rules on constitution of
family homes, for purposes of exemption from execution, as follows:

Art . 161. For purposes of availing of the benefits of a family
home as provided for in this Chapter, a person may constitute,
or be the beneficiary of, only one family home.

Is the family home exempt from execution? Yes, but subject to
certain exceptions. Art icle 155 of the Famil y Co de provides:
"Art . 155. The family home shall be exempt Crom execution,
forced sale or attachment except:
(1)

For non-payment of tax es;

(2) For debts incurred prior to the constitution f the
family home;
(3)
For debts secured by mortgages on the premise
before or after such constitution; and

However, a family home cannot be established on propert y

Th e family home must be established on the properties

and partly on the exclusive property of either spouse with the

The settled rule, however, is that the right to exemption
forced sale under Article 163 of the Family Code is a per
pnvilcgc granted to the Judgment debtor and as such, it must ht
claimed not by the sheriff, but by the debtor himself before k,
sale of the property at pubhc auction. It is not sufficient that k,
person claiming exemption merely alleges that such property is
family home. This claim for exemption must be set up and prove4
to the Sheriff. Having failed to set up and prove to the sheriff the
supposed exemption of the subject property before the sale therel
at public auction, the petitioners now are barred from raising the
same. Failure to do so estops them from later claiming the said
exemption."

RULE 102
HABEAS CORPUS

SEC. 1. To what habeas corpus extends. Except as otherwise expressly provided by law,
the writ of habeas corpus shall extend to all cases
of illegal confinement or detention by which any
person is deprived of bis liberty. or by which the
rightful custody of any person is withheld from the
person entitled thereto.
The writ of habeas carpus extends to all cases of illegal
confinement or detention. Such confinement or detention involves
either of two things: (a) the deprivation of liberty, or (b) the rightful
custody of any person is withheld from the person entitled thereto.
Purpose
In general, the purpose of the writ of habeas corpuJ i8 to
determine whether or not a particular person is legally held. A
prime specification of an application for a writ of habeas corpus, ill
fact, is an actual and effective, and not merely nominal or moral
illegal restraint of liberty. "The writ of habeas corpus was devistd
and exists as a speedy and effectual remedy to relieve persons fro
unlawful restraint, and as the best and only sufficient defenst ~
personal freedom. A prime specification of an application for 8 "11~
of habeas corpus is restraint of liberty. The essential object 111ol
purpose of the writ of habeas corpus is to inquire into all mann~r
involuntary restraint as distinguished from voluntary, and o
a person therefrom if such restraint is illegal. Any restraint whic t
will preclude freedom of action is sufficient." The basic rcquiremeny
before a ~rit of habeas corpus may be issued is the restraint_ofl:~rtof
must be in the nature of an illegal and involuntary deprivat,,,jsicP
freedom of action: Nevertheless, the second part of the P~ hcful
states that the writ may be resorted to in cases where "the rig

r

The most basic criterion for the issuance of the writ is that the
individual seeking such relief is illegally deprived of his freedom
of movement or placed under some form of illegal restraint. If an
individual's liberty is restrained via some legal process, the wnit of
habeas corpus is unavailing. Fundamentally, in order to justify the
grant of the writ of habeas corpus, the restraint of liberty must be
in the nature of an illegal and involuntary deprivation of freedom of
action."
The ultimate purpose of the writ of habeas corpus is to relieve
a person from unlawful restraint. The writ exists as a speedy and
effectual remedy to relieve persons from unlawful restraint and as
an effective defense of personal freedom. It is issued only for the lone
purpose of obtaining relief for those illegally confined or imprisoned
without sufficient legal basis. It is not issued when the person is in
custody because of a judicial process or a valid judgment.

Nature
. Proceedings in habeas corpus are separate and distinct from the

11
: ~ case from which the proceedings spring. They rarely, if ever,

ue! the merits of the case and require no pronouncement with
~t thereto. They deal simply with the detention of the prisoner
n atop with the authority by virtue of which he is deta.ined.1~

CHAPTER XVI - SPECIAL WRITS
Rule 102 -- Habeas Corpus

SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS
Essentials for Rench and Bar

In Caballes u. Court of Appeals," the Supreme
summarized the nature of the writ of habeas corpus:

Ca

A

violation of the accused's constitutional rights;

e court trying the case has jurisdiction; and
Th
The penalty imposed is excessive or beyond what the
3
( ) court could legally impose.
2)

Habeas corpus is a summary remedy. It is analogou,
to a proceeding in rem when instituted for the sole purpose f
having the person of restraint presented before the judge in
order that the cause of his detention may be inquired into and
his statemenL-. final. The writ of habeas corpus does not act upon
the prisoner who seeks relief, but upon the person who holds
him in what is alleged to be the unlawful authority. Hence,
the only parties before the court arc the petitioner (prisoner)
and the person holding the petitioner in custody, and the only
question to be resolved is whether the custodian has authority
to deprive the petitioner of his liberty. The writ may be denied
if the petitioner fails to show facts that he is entitled thereto ex
merito justicias.
A writ of habeas corpus, which is regarded as a"palladiumn
of liberty" is a prerogative writ which does not issue as a matter
of right but in the sound discretion of the court or judge. It
is, however, a writ of right on proper formalities being made
by proof. Resort to the writ is to inquire not into the criminal
act of which a complaint is mode but unto the right of liberty,
notwithstanding the act, and the immediate purpose lo be served
is relief from illegal restraint. The primary, if not the only object
of the writ of habeas corpus ad subjuciendum is to determine the
legality of the restraint under which a person is held."

iterate, the remedy is available only. when there. is en
"?"auo of liberty. Consequently, if the detention or

deprivation of constitutional right, if shown to exist, would oust It
1
ofjurisdiction. In such a case, habeas corpus could be relied upon to
regain ones liberty.
'The writ of habeas corpus will not issue in behalf of a person not
actually restrained of his liberty. This means that a person released
on bail cannot avail of this remedy. Persons discharged on bail are
not restrained of their liberty so as to be entitled to discharge on
habeas corpus, but upon their surrender to proper officers by their
sureties it has been held that habeas corpus will lie.

SEC. 2. Who may grant the writ. - The writ
of habeas corpus may be granted by the Supreme
Court, or any member thereof in the instances
authorized by law, and if so granted it shall be
enforceable anywhere in the Philippines, and may
be made returnable before the court or any member
thereof, or before a Court of First Instance, or any
Judge thereof for the hearing and decision on the
merits. It may also be granted by a Court of First
Instance, or a judge thereof, on any day and at any
tune, and returnable before himself, enforceable
only within his judicial district.

Availability of the writ

The writ may issue even if another remedy, which is 1tss
effective may be availed ofby the defendant. Moreover, the writ mar
be granted upon a judgment already final.11 For instance, a pers~
may apply for the writ when a sentence imposed punishment ~
excess of the power of the court. This is because the sentence is voi_
as to such excess and the prisoner entitled to be released on a;~
of habeas corpus if he has served so much of the sentence that
have been lawfully imposed."
An assertion that a person is illegally confined or detained, ill
general, may involve any of the following:

Ampatuan v. Macaraig
G.R. No. 182497, June 29, 2010
FACTS: Atty. Dalaie. Head of the COMELEC Leal
Department, was killed. In the course of the investigation,
POI Basser B. Ampatuan (POI Ampatuan) was identified as
the perpetrator. The Manila Prosecutor's Office then conducted
inquest proceedings, where probable cause was found to charge
POI Ampatuan with Grave Misconduct (Murder). Through a
Memorandum, Police Director General Avelino I. Razon, Jr.
directed the Regional Director of the National Capital Regional
Police Off6ce (NCRPO) to place POI Ampatuan under restrictive
custody. A few days after, Police Director Acua issued Special
Order No. 921, placing POI Ampatuan under restrictive custody
of the Regional Director, NCRPO.
Meanwhile, the City Prosecutor of Manila recommended
that the case against POI Ampatuan be act for further
investigation and that the latter be released from custody
unless he is being held for other charges or legal ground•Thereafter, petitioner, wife of POI Ampatuan, fled a petition
for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus.

Restrictive custody is, at best, nominal restraint which
is beyond the ambit of habeas corpus. It is neither actual nor
effective restraint that would call for the grant of the remedy
prayed for. It is a permissible precautionary measure to assure
the PNP authorities that the police officers concerned are always
accounted for.
Since the basis of POI Ampatuan's restrictive custody is
the administrative case filed against him, his remedy is within
such administrative process.
We likewise note that POl Ampatuen has been
under restrictive custody since April 19, 2008. 'I'o date, the
administrative case against him should have already been
resolved and the issue of his restrictive custody should have
been rendered moot and academic, in accordance with Section
65 of Republic Act No. 8551.

minimum to 30 years as maximum. Only after he has served
this will he commence serving the less severe penalty imposed
in the illegal possession of firearms case: imprisonment for 4
years, 2 months and 1 day as minimum to 6 years as maximum.
Per the certification issued by the Bureau of Corrections. as
of April 3, 2007, Barredo has served a total of 18 years, 4 months
and 26 days, inclusive of his good conduct time allowance and
preventive imprisonment. Thus. while he has already served the
minimum penalty in the carnapping case, he ha, not yet served
the minimum penalty in the illegal possession of firearms case.
Consequently, Barredo is not entitled to the issuance of a writ
of habeas corpus. Neither is he eligible for parole because only
prisoners who have served the minimum penalty imposed on
them may be released on parole on such terms and conditions as
may be prescribed by the Board of Pardons and Parole.

The general rule is that the release, whether permanent or
temporary, of a detained person renders the petition for habea

corpus moot and academic.

Section 45 thereof.
On the same day, July 1, 2002, the Board of Commiss ioners
(BOC) conducted a summary proceeding and issued a Summary
Deportation Order revoking the VLS8. issued to Javed Kiani.
The next day, July 2, 2002, Javed Kiani's wife, JeanyVi. filed a Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus before the
RTC of Manila. naming the BID and its intelligence officers
as respondents. She prayed that the court issue a writ of
habeas corpus directing respondents to produce the person of
Javed Kiani before it "in the soonest time possible and to show
the cause or legal justification for the latter's detention and
imprisonment, if any; and for such other or further reliefs a,
may be deemed just and equitable under the premises."
On July 18, 2002, the RTC issued an Order granting bail
(orJ11vcd Kiani on a bond of P50,000.00, and ordered respondent
BID Intelligence Officers to file their return on the writ. The
respondents complied, and alleged in their return that Javed
Kiani had already been charged before the BOC and ordered
deported; hence, the petition had become moot and academic.
On October 28, 2002, the RTC issued an Order granting
the motion for reconsideration filed by the Office of the Solicitor
General and setting aside its July 18, 2002 Order. In dismissing
the petition. it ruled that deany.Vi was barred from questioning

37(a)(7) and Section 45 of the Philippine Immigration Act o(
1940, as amended. The filing of the Charge Sheet before the
BSI cured whatever irregularities or infirmitie11 were attondant
to his arre st. The remedy of petitioner was to file a motion for
the dismissal of the Charge Sheet and the Mission Order of the
Immigration Commissioner, not a petition for a writ of habeas
corpus before the RTC. The RTC had no authority to nullify the
Mission Order issued by the lmmib'l'&tion CommiMioncr, much
less set aside the arrest of Javed Kiani. As held by this Court in

Be that as it may, there was a valid judicial
process justifying Ma Jing's detention even before
respondent judge rendered his decision as shown
by tbe Return of the Writ which averred, among
others, that a Charge Sheet was filed against Ma

initially illegal, the filing of the Charge Sheet cured
whatever incipient infirmity there was in her arrest.
Respondent judge therefore had no authority to
release the party who was thus committed.
Once a person detained ie duly charged in court,
he may no longer question his detention through a
petition for issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. His
remedy would be to quash the information and/or
the warrant of arrest duly issued. The writ of habeas
corpus should not be allowed after the party sought
to be released had been charged before any court
The term "court" includes quasi-judicial bodies like
the Deportation Board of the Bureau of Immigration.
The CA acted in accord with jurisprudence when it
affirmed the ruling of the RTC d1.:claring th11t it had no jurisdiclion over petitioner's pica to set aside the Summary Deporta
tion Order issued by the BOC against her husband Javed Kiuni.
Under Section 8, Chapter 3, Title), Book Ill of Executive Order

the Philippines, subject to the requirements of due process. The
Immigration Commissioner is vested with authority to deport
aliens under Section 37 of thff Philippine Immigrntion Act. or
1940, as amended. Thus, a party aggrieved by a Deportation
Order isued by the BOC is proscribed from assailing said Order
in the RTC even via a petition for a writ of habeas corpus."

Kunting fled the petition for the issuance of a writ of
habeas corpus, arguing that he has been rcHtrained of his
liberty. He Raid that since the RTC and DOJ did not act, he filed
his petition to put an end to his illegal detention classified in the
records as for safekeeping purposes only.
Should Kunting's petition be granted?
HELD: NO. Kunting's detention by the PNP-IG was
under process issued by the RTC. He was arrested by the PNP
by virtue of the alias order of arrest issued by Judge Bucoy. His
temporary detention at PKP•IG. Camp Crame, Quezon City,
was thus authorized by the RTC.
Moreover, Kunting was charged with four counts of
Kidnapping for Ransom and Serious Illegal Detention. In
accordance with the last sentence of Section 4 of Rule 102, the
writ cannot be issued and Kunting cannot be discharged since
be has been charged with a criminal offense.
In Larranaga v. Court of Appeals," the Supreme Court held
that the filing of charges and issuance of warrant of arrest cure!

In the Matter of the Petition for Habeas Corpus of
Eufemia E. Rodriguez
G.R. No. 169482, January 29, 2008
FACTS : Eufemia, a 94.year old widow, was living with
Edgardo Veluz, her nephew and the latter acted as her guardian.
In 2005, Luisa Villanueva and Teresita Pabello took Eufemia
from Edgardo's house. Edgardo made repeated demands for
the return of Eufemia but there proved futile. Edgardo filed
a petition for habeas corpus claiming that Luisa and Teresita
were depriving Eufemia of her liberty.
The lower court and Court of Appeals ruled that Edgardo
failed to present any convincing proof that Luisa and Teresita
(Eu_femia'a legally adopted children) were unlawfully restraining
their mother of her liberty. Edgardo also failed to establish his
legal right to custody.

Notwithstanding the foregoing. Section 26 of Rule 114 of tbe
Revised Rules of Criminal Procedure expressly provides that sn
application for bail is note her to objections on illegal arrest, Jack of
or irregular preliminary investigation, provided the accused raise
them before entering his plea.

Edgardo claims that in a petition for habeas corpus, the
court must limit itself to determining whether or not a person is
being unlawfully deprived of liberty and that there is no need to
consider legal custody or custodial rights.

SEC. 5. When the writ must be granted and
issued. - A court or judge authorized to grant the
writ must, when a petition therefor is presented
and it appears that the writ ought to issue, grant
the same forthwith, and immediately thereupon
the clerk of the court shall issue the writ under the
seal of the court; or in case of emergency, the judge
may issue the writ under his own hand, and maY
depute any officer or person to serve it.

is being restrained of her liberty. SiKJlificantly, althou b
Edgardo admits that he did not have legal custody of Eufom~
he nonetheless insists that Luisa and Teresita themselves
no right to her custody.

+

Fundamentally, in order to justify the grant of the writ of

habeas corpus, the restraint of liberty must be in the nature of
an illegal and involuntary deprivation of freed om of action.
In passing upon a petition for habeas corpus, a court or
judge must first inquire into whether the petitioner is being
restrained of his liberty. If he is not, the wnt will be refused.
Inquiry into the cause of detention will proceed only where such
restraint exists. If the alleged cause is thereafter found to be
unlawful, then the writ should be grunted and the petitioner
discharged. Needless to state, if otherwise, again the writ will
be refused.

While habeas corpus is a writ of right, it will not issue as a
matter of course or as a mere perfunctory operation on the filing
of the petition. Judicial discretion is called for in its issuunce and
it must be clear to the judge to whom the petition is presented
that, prima facie, the petitioner is entitled to the writ. It is
only if the court is satisfied that a person is being unlawfully
restrained of his liberty will the petition for habeas corpus be
granted. If the respondents are not detaining or restraining the
applicant or the person in whose behalf the petition is fled, the
petition should be dismi.ued.
In this case, the Court of Appeals made an inquiry into
whether Eufemia was being restrained of her liberty. It found
that she was not.
There is no proof that Eufemia is being detained and
restrained of her liberty by respondents. Nothing on record
reveals that she was forcibly taken by respondents. On the
contrary, respondents, being Eufemia's adopted children, are
taking care of her.
SEC. 6. To whom writ directed, and what to
require. - In case of imprisonment or restraint by
an officer, the writ shall be directed to him, and
shall command him to have the body of the person
restrained of his liberty before the court or judge
designated in the writ at the time and place therein
specified. In case of imprisonment or restraint by
a person not an officer, the writ shall be directed
to an officer, and shall command him to take 8nd

407

+ve the body of the person restrained of his
Jibcrty before the court or Judge designated in the
writ at the time and place therein specified, and to
umumon the person by whom he is restrained then
:nd there to appear before said court or judge to
show the cause of the imprisonment or restraint.
When an officer commits the imprisonment or restraint, the
writ shall be directed to him. The writ shall command the officer to
have the body of the person restrained before the court designated in
the writ at the time and place stated therein. In case imprisonment
or restraint is committed by a person not an officer, the writ shall
nevertheless be directed to an officer. The officer is commanded to
take and have the body of the person restrained before the court
designated in the writ at the time and place stated therein. In
addition, the writ shall summon the person who causes the restraint
to show the cause of the imprisonment or restraint.

Peremptory writ of habeas corpus versus writ of preliminary
citation
peremptory writ of habeas corpus is a written document
unconditionally commanding the respondent to have the body of the
""Pedperson before the court at a time and place specified therein.
Is different from a writ of preliminary citation, which requires
the respondent to appear and show cause why the peremptory writ
should not be granted.

and preserving a copy on which to make return or
service. If that person cannot be found, or baa not
the prisoner in his custody. then the service shall
be made on any other person having or exercising
such custody.

SEC. 9. Defect of form. - No writ of habeas
corpus can be disobeyed for defect of form, if it
ficiently appears therefrom in whose custody
:r under whose restraint the party imprisoned or
restrained is held and the court or judge before
whom he is to be brought.

It is essential that the writ specifies the name of the person
be produced, if such name is known. If his name is not known, be
may be otherwise described or identified.
Service of the writ may be made by the following individuals
(1) the sheriff, (2) other proper officer, or (3) by a person deputed by
the court or judge. The writ is served by leaving the original with the
person to whom it is directed. A copy of the writ is preserved because
the return shall be made thereon. lf the person cannot be found or
does not have the prisoner in his custody, the sheriff is authorized to
serve the writ on any other person having or exercising such custody.
The return must be signed and sworn to by the person making
it, because it serves as prima face evidence of the cause of the
restraint as provided therein."
SEC, 8. How writ executed and returned. - The
officer to whom the writ is directed shall convey
the person so imprisoned or restrained. and named
in the writ, before the judge allowing the writ. or
in case of his absence or disability. before some
other judge of the same court. on the day specified
in the writ, unless. from sickness or infirmity of
the person directed to be produced, such person
cannot, without danger, be bought before the court
or judge; and the officer shall make due return of
the writ, together with the day and the cause of the
caption and restraint of such person according to
the command thereof.

SEC. 11. Return to be signed and sworn to. - The
return or statement shall be signed by the person
who makes it; and shall also he sworn by him if the
prisoner is not produced, and in all other cases
unless the return is made and signed by a sworn
public officer in his official capacity.
SEC. 12. Hearing on return. Adjournments. When the writ is returned before one judge, at a
time when the court is in session, be may forthwith
adjourn the case into the court, there to be heard
and determined. The court or judge before whom
the writ is returned or adjourned must immediately
proceed to hear and examine the return, and
such other matters as are properly submitted for
consideration, unless for good cause shown the
hearing is adjourned, in which event the court or
Judge shall make such order for the safekeeping of
the person imprisoned or restrained as the nature
of the case requires. If the person imprisoned or
restrained is not produced because of his alleged
sickness or infirmity, the court or judge must be
~atisfied that it is so grave that such person cannot
he produced without danger, before proceeding to

authority, the return shall be considered only as
plea of the facts therein set forth, and the party
claiming the custody must prove such facts.
The weight of the return is determined by the color of author+
or the lack of it, for which a person is detained. The return shall
considered as prima facie evidence of the cause of the restraint ift~
person is in custody under a warrant of commitment in pursuang
of law. If, however, his liberty is restrained by any alleged pnva
authority, the return is considered only as a pica of the facts there
set forth. Consequently, the party claiming custody has the burden
to prove such facts.

that the prisoner was lawfully committed, and is
plainly and specifically charged in the warrant of
commitment with an offense punishable by death,
he shall not be released, discharged, or bailed. If he

such sum as the court or judge deems reasonable,
considering the circumstances of the prisoner and
the nature of the offense charged, conditioned
for his appearance before the court where the
offense is properly cognizable to abide its order of
judgment; and the court or judge shall certify the
proceedings, together with the bond, forthwith to
the proper court. If such bond is not so filed, the
prisoner shall be recommitted to confinement.
A person shall not be released, discharged. or bailed in tit

G.R. No. 138268, May 26, 1999
FACTS: Jury Andal, Ricardo Andal, and Edwin Mendou
(Petitioners) were convicted of rape with homicide. Petitioner
filed for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that there was
mistrial. Petitioners argue that the trial court was ousted "
ju,isdic:tion to try their case since the pre-trial idcntiticntion
of the accused wus ma1.fo without the assistance of counsel snd
without a valid waiver from the accused. 'They make referef
to Justice Teehankee's separate opinion in Olaguer u. Mdi@,
Commission No. 34 where he opined tht once a depriva']
a constitutional right is shown to exist, tho court that rende

ye judgment is deemed ousted of jurisdiction and habeas corpus
is the appropriate remedy to assail the legality of the detention.
ls the writ of habeas corpus the appropriate remedy to
inquire inlO the violation of petitioners' constitutional rghts?
HELD: YES. We agree with petitioners that the
xtraordinary writ of habeas corpus is the appropriate
;cmedY to inquire into questions of violation of the petitioners
constitutional rights and that this Court has jurisdiction to
entertain this review.
Under Rule 102, Section 1 of the Revised Rules of Court,
it is provided that except as otherwise expressly provided by
law, the writ of habeas corpus shall extend to all cases of illegal
confinement or detention by which any person is deprived of his
liberty, or by which the rir,htful custody of any person is withheld
from the person entitled thereto. He may al.so avail him~elf of
the writ where as a consequence of a judicial proceeding (a) there
has been a deprivation of a constitutional right resulting in the
restraint of a person; (b) the court had no jurisdiction to impose
the sentence; or (c) an excessive penalty has been imposed, as
such sentence is void as to such excess.
However, in this case, we find that there was no violation
of the constitutional rights of the accused and a resultant
deprivation of liberty or due process of law. The factual milieu
does not show a mistrial or a violation of the constitutional
nights of the accused.

Republic Act No. 8291 took effect, which effectively ~du~

the imposable penalty for the offense of illegal possession {
firms. Hence. for the illegal possession of a low powered frea}
such as that of Danilo. the penalty is now prtsiori corrtccio~
in its maximum period. Danilo argues that the penalty
imprisonment imposed upon his for illegal possession of firearm
has been lowered to imprisonment of 4 years, 2 months, and l
day to 6 years by virtue of Republic Act No. 8294. Consider
that Danilo has already served total of 9 years and 3 months
he contends that he has already served the mAximum period 0£
the two prison terms imposed upon him, and he is, therefore
entitled to be restored to his liberty.
'
Should the writ of habeas corpus be granted?

HELD: YES. Article 70 of the Rt-vised Pc>nal Code is dear
on the matter of service of two or more penalties. Wh en the
culprit has to serve two or more penalties, he should serve them
simultaneously if the nature of the penalties will so permit;
otherwise said penalties shall be executed successively, following
the order of their respective severity. Terms or imprisonment
must therefore be served successively. Thus, we have held that
in the service of two prison terms, the second sentence did not
commence to run until the expiration or the first.
It stands to reason that the penalty for robbery has to be
served by Danilo first before service of the second sentence for
illegal possession of a low powered firearm may even commence.
Thus. the maximum period of Dunilo's incarceration is 12 years
and 8 months. Danilo's service of 9 and 3 months of the prison
terms imposed upon him is therefore not sufficient to meet the
maximum period of 12 years and 8 months, and he cannot be
released Crom confinement on this basis.
Fortunately, however, Dnnilo can and shall be restored to
bis liberty in light of our pronouncement in People u. Wa/pan
Ladjaalam that the accused cnn be convicted of simple illegal
possession of firearms, provided that no other crime wa9
committed by the person arrested. Conversely stated, if another
crime was committed by the nccused, he cannot be convicted of
Rimple illegal possession of frenrms.
It bean reiterating thnt this Court's interpretation ~
laws are as much a prt of the lw of the land us the lettl'rs ~
the laws themselves. Meaning, our interpretntion of Rcpu~~~
Act No. 8294 forms part of the said law. In view of the
entrenched rule that criminal laws shall be given retro"""
effect if favorable to the accused. petitioner Danilo Evan?",]
is deemL-d to have committed only the crime of robbery for" ·ht
he has already served more than the maximum period oft
penalty imposed upon him.

Rule 102 Habeas Corpus

Habeas corpus and certiorari
The writs of habeas corpus and certiorari may be ancil)
each other where necessary to give effect to the supervs,, "
of the higher courts. A writ of habeas corpus reaches the b~O•en
the jurisdictional matters, but not the record. A writ
reaches the record but not the body. Hence, a writ of habeas
may be used with the writ of certiorari for the purpose
However, habeas corpus does not he where the petitioner has k,
remedy of appeal or certiorari bccnuse it will not be permitted to
perform the functions of a writ of error or appeal for the purpose¢

«,"

A writ of habeas corpus is not intended as a substitute fe
the functions of the trial court. In the absence of exceptiontl
circumstances, the orderly course of trial should be pursued and th
usual remedies exhausted before the writ may be invoked. Habau
corpus is not ordinarily available in advance of trial to determine
jurisdictional questions that may arise. It has to be an exceptional
case for the writ of habeas corpus to be available to an accused befer
trial. In the absence of special circumstances requiring immediut
action, a court will not grant the writ and discharge the prisoner ii
advance of a determination of his case in court.'
Habeas corpus In custody cases

The case of Salientes v. Abanilla" involved the propriety of the
writ of habeas corpus in relation to the father's right to see his child l
this case, Loran Abanilla and Marie Antonette Salientes were livint
in the latter's parents' house. Due to in-law problems, Abanilla lt
and was thereafter prevented from seeing his son with SalienttsThereafter. he filed a petition for habeas corpus, which was gran~
by the trial court. Salientes argued that the writ of habeas corf)i)J
is not available against the mother of a child below seven years
of age following the tender age doctrine. The Court declared 1~;
habeas corpus may be resorted to in cases where rightful cuSI '
is withheld from a person entitled thereto. Under Aricle 21 %"
Family Code, Abanilla and Salientes have joint parental auth0·~

Under Section 1, Rule 102 of the Rules of Court, the writ of
habeas corpus is available, not only in cases of illegal confinement or
detention by which any person is deprived of his liberty, but also in
cases involving the rightful custody over a minor. The general rule is
that parents should have custody over their minor children. But the
State has the right to intervene where the parents, rather than care
for such children, treat them cruelly and abusively, impairing their
growth and well-being and leaving them emotional scars that they
carry throughout their lives unless they are liberated from such
parents and properly counseled."

Rule 102 Habeas Corpus

Essentials for Be nch and Bar

Mother given custody of child below seven years old

The general rule is recommended in order to
avoid a tragedy where a mother has see n her baby
torn away from her. No man can sound the deep
sorrows of a mother who is deprived of her child of
tender age. The exception allowed by the rule has to
be for 'compelling rensons' for the good of the child:
those cases must indeed be rare, if the mother's
heart is not to be unduly hurt. lf she has erred, as
in cases of adultery, the penalty of imprisonment
and the (relative) divorce decree will ordinarily be
sufficient punishment for her. Moreover, her moral
dereliction will not have any effect upon the buby
who is as yet unable to understand the situation."
(Report of the Cod e Commission, p. 12)

Pablo-Gualberto v. Gualberto
G.R. No. 164994, June 28, 2005
FACTS : Wh en love is lost between spouses and the
marriage inevitably results in separation, the bitterest tusl
is often over the custod y of their children. The Court ia now
tasked to settle the opposing claims of the parents for cust4 ,
pendente lite of their child who is less than seven years old. On
the one hand, the mother insists that, based on Art icle 213 of
the Family Code. her minor child cannot be separated from her
On the other hand. the father argues that she is "unfit" to take
care of their son; hence, for "compelling reasons," he must be
awarded custod y of the child.
Who should have custody of the child?
HELD: The mother should have custody of the child.
Arti cle 213 of the Famil y Code provides:
"AR T. 213. In case of separation of the parents,
parental authority shall be exercised by the parent
designated by the court. The court shall take into
account all relevant considerations, especially the
choice of the child over seven years of age, unless
the par ent chosen is unfi:t.

A similar provision is embodied in Art icle 8 of the Child
and Youth Welfare Cod e (Pres idential Decree No. 603). Art icle
17 of the same Code is even more explicit in providing for the
child's custody under various circumstances, specifically in case
the parents are separated. It clearly mandates that "no child
under five years of age shall be separated from his mother,
unless the court finds compelling reasons to do so." The provision
is reprod uced in its entirety as follows:
..Art . 17. Joint Parental Authority. - The
father and the mother shall exercise jointly just and
reasonable parental authority and responsibility
over their legitimate or adopted children. In case
of disagreement, the father's decision shall prevail
unless there is a judicial order to the contrary.

No child under seven years of age shall be
separatl?d from the mother, unless the court finds
compelling reasons to order otherwise."

In case of the absence or death of either parent,
the present or surviving parent shall continue to
exercise parental authority over such children,
unless in case of the surviving parent's remarriage,
the court for justifiable reasons, appoints another
Person as guardian.

Thia Court has held that when the parents are separated,
legally or otherwise. the foregoing provision governs the custody
of their child. Article 213 takes its bearing from Art icle 363 of
the Civil Code, which reads:
Art . 363. In all questions on the care, custody,
education and property of children, the hitter's
welfare shall be paramount. No mother shall be
separated from her child under seven years of age,
unless the court finds compelling reasons for such
measure." (Italics supplied)
The general rule that children under seven years of a°

430

SPECIAL. PROCEEDINGS

CHAPTER XVI - SPECIAL WRITS
Rule 102 Habeas Corpus

has reverted to the Civil Code provision mandating that a. child
below seven years should not be separated from the mother.

Tender:.Age. Presumption
inted out earlier, there is express statutory
.:::io::.hat, 11s n general rule, ll mother is to he preferred in
custody of children under the are of seven. The caveat
,,{ele 213 of the Family Code cannot be ignored, except
when the court finds cause to order otherwise.

Mandatory Character of Article 2L? of the FamilyCde
In Lacson u. San ,lost•Lacson, the Court held that the use
of "shall" in Article 363 of the Civil Code nnd the observations
made by the Code Commission underscore the mandatory
character of the word. Holding in that case that it was a mistal
to deprive the mother of custody of her two children, both then
below the age of seven, the Court stressed:
.. (Article 363] prohibits in no uncertain terms
the separation of a mother and her child below seven
years. unless such a separation is grounded upon
compelling reasons as determined by a court."
In like manner, the word "shall" in Article 213 of the
Family Code and Section 6 of Rule 99 of the Rules of Court has
been held to connote a mandatory character. Article 213 and
Rule 99 similarly contemplate a situation in which the parents of
the minor are married to each other. but are separated by virtue
of either a decree of legal separation or a de facto separation. In
the present case, the parents are living separately as a matter
of fact.

The Best Interests of the Child aPrimary Consideration
The Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that
"(i]n all actions concerning c:hildren, whether undertaken
by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law,
administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best intert,tJ
of the child shall be a primary consideration.~
The principle of "best interest of the child" pervade,
Philippine cases involving adoption, guardianship, suppor
personal status, minors in conflict with the law, and child
custody. In these cases, it has long been recognized that 1
choosing the parent to whom custody is given, the welfare of tho
minors should always be the paramount consideration. Courts
are mandated to take into account all _rP.levant cin:umstanc~
that would have a bearing on the children's wellbeing ""
development. Aside from the material resources and the mo:
and !WCial situations _of each parent, other factor~ may also d
considered to ascertain which one has the capab11ity to atte~
to the physical, educntional, social and moral welfare of the
children. Among these factors re the previous care and devotto~
shown by each of the parents; their religious background. """"
uprightness, home environment nd time availability; as weli"
the children's emotional and educational needs.

""[Z4

The so-called "ender-age presumption"under Article 213of
the Family Code may be overcome only by compelling evidence of
the mother's unfitness. The mother has been declared unsuitable
to have custody of her children in one or more of the following
instances: neglect, abandonment, unemployment, immorality,
habitual drunkenness, drug addiction, maltreatment of the
child. insanity or affliction with a commumcable disease.
Here, Crisanto cites immorality due to alleged lesbian
relations as the compelling reason to deprive Joycelyn of custody.
It has indeed been held that under certain circumstances, the
mother's immoral conduct may constitute a compelling reason
to deprive her of custody.
But sexual preference or moral laxity alone does not
prove parental neglect or incompetence. Kot even the fact that
a mother is a prostitute or has been unfaithful to her husband
would render her unfit to have custody of her minor child. To
deprive the wife of custody, the husband must clearly establish
that her moral lapses have had an adverse effect on the welfare
of the child or have distracted the offending spouse from
exercising proper parental care.
To this effect did the Court rule in Unson III v. Navarro,
wherein the mother was openly living with her brother-in-law,
the child's uncle. Under that circumstance, the Court deemed
it in the nine-year-old child's best interest to free her "from the
obviously unwholesome, not to say immoral influence, that the
~ituation in which the mother ha[d] placed herself might create
mn [the child's) moral and social outlook."
In Espiritu. u. CA, the Court took into account psychological
and case study reports on the child, whose feelings of insecurity
; nd anxiety had been traced to strong conflicts with the mother.
: the Psychologi1st the child revealed, among other thin gs, that
~-clatter was disturbed ~pan_ seeing "her mother huJ!l{lng and
"
a 'bad' mn who lived in their house nd worked for her
"her.' The Coor held ht the "illicit or immoral activities of
the mother had already caused the child emotional disturbances,
:e:~~lllity conAicts, and exposure to conflicting moral values

Based on the above jurisprudence, it is therefore not
enough for Crisanto to show merely that Joycelyn was a lesbian
He must also demonstrate that she carried on her purpo rted
relationship with a person of the same sex in the presence of
their son or under circumstances not conducive to the child's
proper moral development. Such a fact has not OOC n shown
here. There is no evidence that the son was exposed to the
mother's alleped sexual proclivities or that his proper moral and
psychological development suffered as a result.

the~efore be filed with any of the proper RTCs within the judicial
region where enforcement thereof is sought.
On this point, Section 13 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129
(BP 129), otherwise known as the Judiciary Reorganization

enumeration of judicial regions in the country, states:

Evangelical Church at United Nations Avenue, Manila. A year
later, respondent gave birth to a bahy girl whom they named
Sequeira Jennifer Delle Francisco Thornton.

bored as a plain housewife. She wanted to return to her old job••
a"guest relations officer" in nightclub, with the freedom to
out with her friends. On December 7, 2001, respondent left the

Petitioner fled a petition for habeas corpus in the

%"";i ecru»e cot he «teat«o hat he cha was i
,uan. Petitioner then went to Basilan to ascertain the
whereabouts of respondent and their daughter. However, he
did not find them there and the barangay office of Sta. Clara,
Lamitan, Basilan, issued a certification that respondent was no
l 0 ger residing there. Petitioner gave up his search when he
~ hold of respondent's cellular phone bilh1 showing calls from
~~erent places such as Cavite, Nueva Ecija, Metro Manila and
other provinces.
Petitioner then filed another petition for habeas corpus,
this time in the Court of Appeals which could issue a writ of
habeas corpus enforceable in the entire country. However, the
petition was denied by the Court of Appeals on the ground
that it did not have jurisdiction over the case. It ruled that
since RA 8369 (The Family Courts Act of 1997) gave family
courts exclusive original jurisdiction over petitions for habeas
corpus, it impliedly repealed RA 7902 (An Act Expanding the
Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals) and Batas Pambansa 129
(The Judiciacy Reorganization Act of 1980).
Does the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction to issue writs
of habeas corpus in cases involving custody of minors in the light
of the prouision in Republic Aet No. 8369 giving family courts
exclusive original jurisdiction over such petitions?
HELO: YES. The provisions of RA 8369 reveal no manifest
intent to revoke the jurisdiction of the Court or Appeals and
Supreme Court to issue writs of habeas corpus relating to the
custody of minors. Further, it cannot be said that the provisions
of RA 8369, RA 7092 and BP 129 are absolutely incompatible
since RA 8369 does not prohibit the Court or Appeals 11.nd the

keas corpus which may be issued exclusively by family courts
,, section 50) of RA 8369 pertain to the ancillary remedy

The primordial consideration is the welfare and best
interests of the child. We rule therefore that RA 8369 did not
divest the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of their
jurisdiction over habeas corpus cases involving the custody of
minors.
In any case. whatever uncertainty there was has been
settled with the adoption of A.M. No. 03.03.04.SC Re. Rule on
Custody of Minors and Writ of Habeas Corpus in Relation to
Custody of Minors, Section 20 of which provides that the petition

may likewise be filed uwith the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals,
or with any of its members and, if so granted, the writ shall bl
enforceable anywhere in the Philippines."
In Madrifian u. Madririan.'1 the Supreme Court was faced with
the same jurisdictional question as to habeas corpus cases involving
custody of minors. It ruled:
.. In Thornton v. Thornton. this Court resolved the issue ol
the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction to issue writs of habeas corpus
in cases involving custody of minors in the light of the provision
in RA 8369 giving family courts exclusive original jurisdiction
over such petitions:
The Court of Appeals should take cognizance of the
case since there is nothing In RA 8369 that revoked its
jurisdiction to issue writs of habeas corpus involving the
custody or minors.
We note that after petitioner moved out of their Parafiaque
residence on May 18, 2002, he twice transferred his sons to
provinces covered by different judicial regions. This situation
is what the 1'hornton interpretation of RA 8369's provision on
jurisdiction precisely addressed.

In the same case, the Supreme Court made the followiDC
clarification:
"Moreover, a careful rending of Section 6b) of RA 836 9
reveals that family courts are vested with original exclus""
jurisdiction in custody cases, not in habeas corpus cases. Writs

G.R. No. 180906, October 7, 2008
FACTS: Raymond and Reynaldo were taken by some
members of the CAFGU. They were interrogated and beaten up
several times. After detention of more than one year, Raymond
and Reynaldo were able to escape. Thereafter, respondents filed
a petition for prohibition. injunction. and temporary restraininr
order against the petitioners. In the meantime and while the
petition was pending, the Rule on the Writ of Amparo was
promulgated. The Court then resolved to treat the petition a.s •

Herein petitioners presented a lone witness in the
summary hearings, Lt. Col. Ruben U. Jimenez. Lt. Col.

the respondents by CAFGU auxiliaries under his unit. Jinienei
found that the participation of the petitioners in the abduction
and disappearance of the Manolo brothers were unsubstantiated.

HELD: YES. The Court promulgated the Amparo Rule
in light of the prevalence of extralegal killing and enforced
disappearances. It was an exercise for the first time of the Courts
expanded power to promulgate rules to protect our peoples
constitutional rights, which made its maiden appeornnct· in
the 1987 Coni.titution in reapom1c to the Filipino experience

l""",~,a

The writ of amparo serves both preventive and curative
roles in addressing the problem of extralegal killings and
enforced disappearances. It is preventive in that it breaks the
expectation of impunity in the commission of these offenses;
it is curative in that it facilitates the subsequent punishment
or perpetrators as it will inevitably yield leadi; to subsequent
investigation and action. In the long run. the goal of both the
preventive and curative roles is to deter the further commission
of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances.
In the case at bar. respondents initially filed an action for
Prohibition, Injunction, and Temporary Restraining Order to
stop petitioners and/or their officers and agents from depriving
the respondents of their right to liberty and other basic rights
on August 23, 2007, prior to the promulgation of the Amparo
Ruic. They also sought ancillary remedies including Protective
Custody Orders, Appointment of Commissioner, Inspection and
Access Orders and other legal and equitable remedies under
Arti~le VUI, Section 5(5) of the 1987 Constitution and Rule 135,
Section 6 of the Rules of Court. When the Amparo Rule came
into effect on October 2'1, 2007, they moved to have their petition
treated s an amparo petition as it would be more effective and
:~itable to the circumstances of the \.fanalo brothers enforced

to security of person.

sometime in June 2007 when respondents were detained
1
""",~ Limay. Bataan. respondents captors even told rhea
~t they were still deciding whether they should be executed.

Respondents assert that their cause of action consist in
the threat to their right to life and liberty, and a violation
of their right to security.

The possibility of respondents being executed stared them
the eye while they were in detention. With their escape, this
ntinuing threat to their life is apparent, moreso now that they
surfaced and implicated specific officers in the military
not only iu their own abduction and torture, but also in those
of other persons known to h11vc disappeared such as Sherlyn
Cadapan, Karen Empeo, and Manuel Menno, among others.

A closer look at the right to security of person would yield
various permutations of the exercise of this right. First, the
rlllt'. ht to security of person Is freedom from fear. In iu
wheres clauses, the Universal Declarntion of Human Right
(UDHR) enunciates that a world in which human beings shall
enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear
and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the
common people. Second, the right to security of person
Is a guarantee of bodily and psychological integrity
or security. Article III. Section II of the 1987 Constitutioa
guarantees that, as a general rule, one's body cannot be
seflrched or invaded without a ,;ean::h warrant. Third, the
right to security of person ls a guarantee of protection
of one's rights by the government. In the context of the
writ of amparo, this right is built into the guarantees of the
right to life and liberty under Article Ill, St.-ction l of the
1987 Constitution and the right to security of person (as
freedom from threat and gunrantee of bodily and psychological
integrity) under Article lll, Section 2 The right to security of
person in this third sense is a corollary of the policy that the
State guarantees full respect for human rights under Article II,
Section 11 of the 1987 Constitution.
Applying the foregoing concept of the right to secu rity of
person to the case at bar. we now determine whether there is a
continuing violation of respondents right to security.
First, the violation of the right to security as freedom
Crom threat to respondents life, liberty and security.
While respondents were detained, they were threatened
that if they escaped. their families, including them, would be
killed. In lutymond's narration, he was tortured and poured
with gasoline after he was caught the first time he attempted
to escape from Fort Magsaysay. A call from a certin Mam, who
wanted to see him before he was killed, spared him.
This time, respondents have fnally escaped. The condition
of the threat to be killed has come to pass. It should be 11tres&ed
that they are now free from captivity not because they were
released by virtue of a lawful order or voluntarily freed by the~r
abductors. It ought lo be recallt..J lhat towards the end f the

111

Understandably, since their escape, respondents have
been under concealment and protection by private citizens
because of the threat to their life, liberty and security. The
threat vitiates their free will as they are forced to limit their
movements or activities. Precisely because respondents are
being shielded from the perpetrators of their abduction, they
cannot be expected to show evidence of overt acts of threat such
a& face-to.face intimidation or written threats to their life, liberty
and security. Nonetheless, the circumstances of respondents
abduction. detention, torture and escape reasonably support a
conclusion that there is an apparent threat that they will again
be abducted, tortured, and this time, even executed. These
constitute threats to their liberty, security, and life, actionable
through a petition for a writ of amparo.
Next, the violation of the right to security as
protection by the government. Apart from the failure of
military elements to provide protection to respondents by

Coverage: extralegal kHJinga and enforced dlsappearances, or
threats thereof
The writ of amparo covers extralegal killings and enforced
disappearances. Extralegal killings are killings committed without
due process of law, i.e., without legal safeguards or judicial
proceedings. Enforced disappearances, on the other hand, are
attended by the following characteristics: an arrest, detention or
abduction of a person by a government official or organized groups
or prvate individuals acting with the direct or indirect acquiescence
ofhthe government; the refusal of the State to disclose the fate or

is it a writ that courts shall issue on amorphous and uncera,
grounds.

m

The privilege of the Writ of Amparo is a remedy availabl ta
victims of extra-judicial killings and enforced disappearance:
threats of ll similar nature, regardless of whet_her the perpetra;
of the unlawful act or omission is a public official or employee oR
private individual.

Ramon Tulfo taking _p hotos of Claudine and this led to a brawl.
n's brothers aired on their TV program comments and
against Spouses Raymart and Claudine, threatening
ex~liation. The spou~s hence filed a petition for the issuance of
:Writ of Amparo against Hamon's brothers and they. in turn,
fled a Manifestation and motion to Deny Issuance of Protection
Order and/or Dismissal of the Petition Mota Proprio. This was
opposed by the spouses for being a prohibited pleading. The
RTC dismissed the petition for the issuance of a wnt of amparo.

R

"{l,es

Government lnvotvement an lndlspenaable requirement

l he RTC's dismissal correct?

For the protective writ of amparo to issue, allegation and
proof that the persons subject thereof are missing are not enough
It must also be shown and proved by substantial evidence that the
disappearance was carried out by. or with the authorization. support
or acquiescence of, the State or a political organization, followed
by a refusal to acknowledge the same or give information on the
fate or whereabouts of said missing persons, with the intention of
removing them from the protection of the law for a prolonged period
of time. Simply put, the petitioner in an amparo case has the burden
of proving by substantial evidence the indispensable element ol
government participation. To fall within the ambit of A.M. No.
07.9.12-SC in relation to Republic Act No. 9851 (An Act Defininc
and Penalizing Crimes Against International Humanitarian Law,
Genocide and Other Crimes Against Humanity), the disappearanct
must be attended by some governmental involvement. This hallmark
of State participation differentiates an enforced disappearance cast
from an ordinary case of a missing person."

HELD: YF..S. The writ of Am paro was intended to
address and, thus, is presently confined to cases involving
extralegal killings and/or enforced disappearances,
or threats. "Extrajudicial killings," according to case law,
arc generally characterized as "killings committed without
due process of law," i.e. without legal safeguards or judicial
proceedings," while "~nforced disappcnrnnccs," according to Sec.
3(g) of RA 9851 (Philippine Act on Crimes Against International
Huma~tarian Law, Genocide, and Other Crimes Against
Humanity,) "means the arrest, detention, or abduction of
persons by, or with the authorization, support or acquiescence
of, a State or a political organization followed by a refusal to
acknowledge that deprivation of freedom or to give information
on that fate or whereabouts of those persons, with the intention
of removing from the protection of the law for a prolonged period

May the writ of amparo extend to violation of a person'
right to property'
HELD: NO. The threatened demolition of a dwelling by
virtue or a final judgment of the court, which in this case was
affirmed with finality by this Court in G R. Nos. 177448, 180768
177701, 177038, is not included among the enumeration of
rights in Section 1 of the Rule on the Writ of Amparo for which
the remedy of a writ of amparo is mndP. available. Their claim
to their dwelling, assuming they still have any despite the final

and executory judgment adverse to them, does not constitute
right. to life, liberty and security. There is, therefore, no legal
basis for the issuance of the writ of amparo.
Besides, the factual and legal basis for petitioners, claim
to the land in question is not alleged in the petition at all. The
Court can only surmise that these rights nnd interest had
alreadv been threshed out and settled in the four cases cited
above. No writ of amparo may be issued unless there is a clear
allegation of the supposed factual and legal basis of the right
sought to be protected.
Under Section 6 of the same rules, the court shall issue
the writ upon the filing of the petition, only if on its face, the
court ought to issue said writ.
Considering that there is no legal basis for its issuance, as
in this case, the writ will not be issued and the petition will be
dismissed outright.
This new remedy of writ of amparo which is made
available by this Court is intended for the protection of the
highest possible rights of any person, which is his or her rh
to life, liberty and security. The Court will not pre any tum
or effort on its part in order to give priority to petitions of thi
nature. However, the Court will also not waste it.a precious tinie
and effort on matters not covered by t.hc writ.

Court denied the petition, holding that the restriction on Reyes's
right to travel as a consequence of the pendency of the criminal
case filed against him was not unlawful. Reyes has also failed to
establish that his right to travel was impaired in the manner and to
the extent that it amounted to a serious violation of his right to life,

recourse or remedy.

Agcaoili, Jr. v. Forillaa
G.R. No. 232395, July 3, 2018
FACTS: House Resolution No. 882 was issued directing the
House of Committee to conduct an inquiry, in aid of legislation, of
the alleged unauthorized purchases of the Government of !locos
Norte in violation of RA No. 7171 and PD 1445. Petitioners. who
are employees of the! government of Jlocos ~•forte and Governor
Imee Marcos, were invited to shed light on the alleged anomalies.
Petitioners refused to appear before the hearing and because of
this, they were cited in contempt and ordered detained. This
prompted the petitioners to file a petition for Hobtas Corpus
before the Court of Appeals. While such petition was pending
before, they also filed the present petition before the Supreme
Court to take cognizance of the petition for Habeas Corpus and
in addition for the issuance of a Writ of Amparo.
While the petitions were pending, the respondents and
the House Committee lifted the contempt order and ordered
the release of the petitioner. Despite the lifting of the contempt,
petitioners contend that their rights to liberty and personal
security were violated as they have been detained, while co.
petitioner Marcos is continuously being threatened with arrest.
Should the Writ of Amparo be issued?
HELD: NO. The writ of Amparo cannot be issued in cues
where the alleged threat to life, liberty and security has ceased
and is no longer imminent or continuing.
In this case, the alleged unlawful restraint on petitioners
liberty has effectively ceased upon their subsequent release
from detention. On the other hnnd, the 11pprehenaion of co·
petitioner Marcos that she will be detained is, at best, merely
speculative. In other words, co-petitioner Marcos has failed to
show any cle,i.r threat to her right to liberty actionable through
a petition for a writ of Amparo. Here, it appears that petitioners
and co-petitioner Marcos even attended and pnrticipntcd in the
Ruh1u,quent hearings on House Resolution Ko. 882 without snY
untoward incident. Petitioners and co-petitioner Marco11 t~ua
failed to establish that their attendance nt and participntion
in the legislative inquiry as resource persona have st:riousl)'
violated their right to liberty and security, for which ~o 0ther
legal recourse or remedy is available. Perforce, the petition for
the issuance or a writ of Amparo must be dismissed.

After Marcelino's death, Christina disclosed to Marcelino's

for adoption which respondents allegedly used as basis
misrepresent that all legal requisites for adoption of the minor
child had been complied with. The RTC dismissed the petition
for the issuance of a writ of amparo without prejudice to the
filing of the appropriate action in court. The RTC held that
Christina availed of the wrong remedy to regain custody of
her child Haby Julian. The RTC further stated that Chriatina
should have fled a civil case for custody of her child as laid down
in the Family Code and the Rule on Custody of Minon and Writ
of Habeas Corpus in Relation to Custody of Minors.
ls a petition for a writ of amparo the proper recourse for
obtaining parental authority and custody of a minor child?
HELD: NO. Chrii.tina alleged that the respondent DSWD
officers caused her "enforced separation from Baby Julian and
that their action Amounted to an "enforced disnppean1nce•
within the context of the Amparo rule. Contrary to her position,
however, the respondent DSWD officers never concealed Baby
Julian's whereabouts. In fact, Christina obtained a copy of the
DSWD's Memorandum explicitly stating that Baby Julian was
in the custody of the Medina Spouses when she filed her petition
before the RTC. Besides, she even admitted in her petition
for review on certiorari that the respondent DSWO officers
presented Baby Julian before the RTC during the hearing
held in the afternoon of August 5, 2010. There is therefore, no
"enforced disappearance" as used in the context of the Amparo
rule as the third and fourth elements are missing.
Christina's directly accusing the respondents of forcibly
separating her from her child and placing the latter up for
adoption, supposedly without complying with the necessary
legal requisites to qualify the child for adoption, clearly
indicates that she is not searching for a lost child but asserting
her parental authority over the child and contesting custo!
over him. Since it is extant from the pleadings filed that what 1
involved is the issue of child custody and the exercii;o of parental
rights over a child, who, for nil intents and purpose11, hne been
legally considered a ward of the State, the Amparo rulo cannot
be properly applied.
To reiterate, the privilege oft he writ of amparo is a remedy
available to victims of extra-judicial killings and enforced
disappearances or threats of a similar nature, regardless O
whether the perpetrntor of the unlawful act or omission 18 '

G.R. No. 204528, February 19, 2013
FACTS: Magtanggol Gatdul fled a petition for th
issuance of a writ of amparo against petitioners Secretary Leil
M. de Lima, Director Nonnatus R Rojas, and Deputy Director
Hcynaldo O. Esmeralda. Gatdula wanted petitioners to "cease
and desist from framing up Gatdula for the fake ambush
incident by filing bogus chara-es of frustrated murder against
Gatdula." Instead of deciding on whether to issue a writ, the
judge issued summons and ordered petitioners to file an answer,
He also set the case for hearing in order to determine whether a
temporary protection order may he issued. During the hearing,
counsel for petitioners manifested that a return, not an answer,
is appropriate for an amparo case.
In an order, Judge Pampilo insisted that the required
pleading is an answer and not a return since no writ hos been
issued. The RTC thereafter rendered a "decision" a-ranting the
issuance of the writ. while at the same time granting the interim
reliefs prayed for. Petitioners thus filed a petition for review on
certiorari via Rule 45 assailing the RTC's "decision."

HELD,
1.
The "decision" assailed by the petitioners could
not be the judgment or final order that is nppea\able under
Section 19 of the Rule on the Writ of Amparo. This "decision
pertained to the issuance of the writ under Section 6 of the Rule
on the Writ of Amparo, not the judgment under Section 18.
The "decision" is thus an interlocutory order, a9 11uggcsted _by
the fact that temporary protection, production and inspect1on
orders were given together with the decision. The tcmpor~r)'
protection, production and inspection orders are interim reliefs
that mny be granted by the court upon filing of tho petition but
before final judgment is rendered.

,,jZ Pailo insisted on issuing summons and requirinr an
Answer.
.
A writ of Amparo is a special proceeding. It is a
3
remedy by which a party seeks to establish a status, a right
or particular fact. It is not a civil nor a criminal action, hence,
the application of the Revtsed Rule on Summary Procedure is
seriously misplaced.
4.
No. Without a Return, the issues could not have
been properly joined.
5.
No. The Return in Amparo cases allows the
respondents to frame the issues subject to a hearing. Hence, it
should be done prior to the hearing, not after. A memorandum,
on the other hand, is a synthesis of the claims of the party
litigants and is a final pleading usually required before the case
is submitted for decision. One cannot substitute for the other
ainct> these submissions have different functions in facilitating
the suit. More importantly, a memorandum is a prohibited
pleading under the Rule on the Writ of Amparo.
The privilege of the Writ or Amparo should be
distinguished from the actual order called the Writ of Amparo.
The privilege includes availment of the entire procedure outlined
in AM No 07.9.12.SC, the Rule on the Writ of Amparo. After
examining the petition and its attached affidavits, the Return
and the evidence presented in the summary hearing, the
Judgment should detail the required acts from the respondents
that will mitigate, if not totally eradicate, the violation of or the
threat to the petitioner's life, liberty or security.
A judgment which simply grants "the privilege of the writ"

An inspection order is an interim relief designed to give support
or strengthen the claim of a petitioner in an amparo petition, in
order to aid the court before making a decision. A basic req uirement
before an amparo court may grant an inspec tion order is that the
place to be inspec ted is reasonably determinable from the allegations
of the party seeking the order. In Ba lao u. Arroyo,11 the issuance of
inspection order was properly denied since the petitioners specified
several military and police establishments based merely on the
allegation that the testimonies of victims and witnesses in previow
incidents of similar abductions involving activists disclosed that
those premises were used as detention centers. In the same vein ,
the prayer for issuance of a production order was predicated Oil
petitioners' bare allegation that it obtained confidential informauon
from an unidentified military source, that the name of James ,,.,u
included in the so-called Order of Battle. Indeed, the trial court could
not have sanctioned any "fishing expedition" by precipitate issuance
of inspection and production orders on the basis of insufficient
claims of one party.

accompanied them were from the Commission on Human
Rights (CHR). Cruz, a member of the CHR, took photographs
of Rodriguez's bruises. Th e soldiers accompanied Rod riguez and
his family to the CHR office, where Rodriguez were made to sign
an affidavit stating that he was neither abducted nor tortured.
Rodriguez was then finally able to come home. A few days after
Rodriguez was set free, he was examined by a phyHicinn, Dr.
Pamugas. Dr. Pamugas found that Rodriguez was a victim of
torture. Some time later, Rodriguez noticed that he was being
followed by suspicious-looking men.

2.
NO It bears stressing that since there is n
determination of administrative, civil or criminal liability in
amparo and habeas data proceedings, courts can only go as f,
as ascertaining ~sponsi_hility or acc_ountab11ity for the enforced
disappearance or extrajudiciul killing. 'The Court of Appeal
dismissed the petition with respect to former President Arroyo
on account of her presidential immunity from suit. Rodriuez
contends, though, that she should remain a respondent in thi
case to enable the courts to determine whether she is responsible
or accountable therefor. In this regard, it must be clarified that
the Court of Appeals rationale for dropping her from the list of
respondents no longer stands since her prcsidcnli11} immunity i!
limited only to her incumbency. It is clear th11.t former President
Arroyo cannot use the presidential immunity from suit to shield
herself from judicial scrutiny that would assess whether, within
the context of amparo proceedings, she was responsible or
accountable for the abduction of Rodriguez.

On the issue of knowledge, it must be pointed out that
h international tribunals apply a strict standard of
""".. ie.. actual knowledge, such may nonetheless be
""","aced through circumstantial evidence. In the Philippines,
es
liberal view is adopted and supenors may be charged
"" ,,euve knowledge. Under E.O. 226. a government
heta table for neglect of duty under the doctrine
"}~la responsibility if he has knowledge that a crime
or offense shall be committed, is being committed, or has
been committed by his subordinates, or by others within his
of responsibility and, despite such knowledge, he did not
[revenive or corrective action either before, during. or
immediately after its commission. Knowledge of the commission
of Lrrcgularitws, crimes or offenses IS presumed when (a) the
acts arc widespread within the government officials area of
junsdiction; (b) the acts have been repeatedly or regularly
committed within his area of responsibility; or (c) members of
his immediate staff or office personnel are involved.

3.
YES. Although originally used for ascertaining
criminal complicity, the command responsibility doctrine
has also found application in civil cases for human rights
abuses. Precisely in the case at bar, the doctrine of command
responsibility may be used to determine whether respondents
are accountable for and have the duty to address the abduction
of Rodriguez in order lo enable the courts to devise remedial
measures to protect his rights.
Having established the applicability of the doctrine or
command responsibility in amparo proceedings, it must now be
resolved whether the president, as commander-in-chief of the
military, can be held responsible or accountable for extrajudicial
killings and enforced disappearances. We rule in the affirmative.
To hold someone liable under the doctrine of command
responsibility, the following elements must obtain:
(a) the existence of a superior-subordinate
relationship between the accused as superior and the
perpetrator of the crime as his subordinate;
(b) the superior knew or had reason to know that
the crime was about to be or had been committed; end
(c)
the superior filed to take the ncccs9ary nnd
reasonable measures to prevent the criminal acts or
punish the perpetrators thereof.
The president, being the commander-in-chief of all armed
forces, necessarily possesses control over the military that
qualifies him ui; 11 superior within the purview of the command
responsibility doctrine.

""",{~e

4.
YES The right to security of a person includes the
positive obligation of the government to ensure the observance
of the duty to investigate. In the instant case, this Court
rules that respondents in G.R. No. 191805 are responsible or
accountable for the violation of Rodriguez's right to lire, liberty
and security on account of their abject failure to conduct a fair
and effective official investigation of his ordeRI in the hands of
the military. Respondents Gen. Ibrado, PDG. Verzosa, Lt. Gen.
Bangit, Maj. Gen. Ochoa. Col. De Vera and Lt. Col. Mina only
conducted a perfunctory investigation, exerting no efforts to
take Ramirez's account of the events into con~idcration. Rather,
these respondents solely relied on the reports and narrntion of
the military. Clearly. the absence or A. fair and effective official
investi1tation into the claims of Rodriguez violated his right to
security, for which respondents in G.R. No. 191805 must be held
responsible or accountable.

A rght can include the updating, rectification, suppression or
destruction of the database or information or files in possession or

The writ of habeas data is an independent and summary

to enforce one's right to the truth and to informational privacy. It
must be emphasized that in order for the privilege of the writ to be

enumeration of individuals maintaining PAGs. Subsequent!

In striking down Gamboa's claims, the Supreme Court not
that the Constitution explicitly mandates the dismantling of Pri\· ed
armies and other armed groups not recognized by the duly eonstitu=
authonty. Thus, the creation ofthe Zenarosa Commission articulat
a legitimate state aim. which is to investigate the existence of PA~
with the ultimate objective of dismantling them permanently. Th,
feet that the PNP released information to the Zenarosa Commiss
without prior communication to Gamboa and without affordinr
her the opportunity to refute the same cannot be interpreted as
violation or threat to her right to privacy since that act jg an inherent
and crucial component of intelligence-gathering and investigation.
Gamboa was also unable to prove through substantial evdeoe
that her inclusion in the list of individuals maintaining PAGs made
her and her supporters susceptible to harassment and to increased
police surveillance. In this regard, the respondents sufficieoU)'
explained that the investigations conducted against her were iI
relation to the criminal cases in which she was implicated. As publ:
officials, they enjoy the presumption of regularity, which she failed
to overcome. The state interest of dismantling PAGs far outweighs
the alleged intrusion on the private life of Gamboa, especially whtt
the collection and forwarding by the PNP of information against her
was pursuant to a lawful mandate. Therefore, the privilege oftbt

:essibility of a user's profile as well as information uploaded by the
:ser. It observed that through the availability of said privacy tools,
many users are said to have a subjective expectation that only those
to whom they grant access to their profile will view the information
they post or upload thereto. This, however, does not mean that any
Facebook user automatically has a protected expectation of privacy
in all of his or her Facebook activities. Before one can have an
expectation of privacy in his or heronline activity, it is first necessary
that said user, in this case the children of petitioners, manifest the
intention to keep certain posts private, through the employment of
measures to prevent access thereto or to limit its visibility. Hence,
affirming the RTC's denial of the issuance of the habeas data writ,
the Court observed:
ha

_in sum, there can be no quibbling that the images in

Castillo v. Cruz
G.R. No. 182165, November 25, 2009
FACTS: Respondent Spouses Cruz, lensed parcel of land
situated at Barrio Guinhwnu, Malolos (the property), refused
vacate the property, despite demands by the lessor Provincial
Government of Bulacan (the Province) which intended to utilize
it for local projects. The Province thus filed a complaint for
unlawful detainer against the Spouses Cruz before the then
Municipal Trial Court (MTC) of Bulacan, where the MTC
rendered judgment against Spouses Cruz. This was affirmed by
the RTC and the decision became fnal and executor.
Spouses Cruz refused to vacate the property. They fled a
petition for annulment or judgment before the RTC of Malolos
Branch 18 and a civil case for injunction before RTC of Mallos
Branch IO. Thereafter. RTC Branch 10 issued an Order issuing
a permanent writ of injunction until the MTC resolves Spouses
Cruz's motion for the determination of the metes and bounds of
400 sq. meters leased premises.
Finding that the fallo of the RTC Order treats, as a
suspensive condition for the lift in~ of the permanent injunction,
the determination of the boundaries of the property. the
Province returned the issue for the consideration of the MTC. In
a Geodetic Engineers Report submitted to the MTC, the metes
and bounds or the property were indicated. The MTC approved
the Report and ruled that the permanent injunction which the
RTC issued is ineffective. The MTC thus issued a Seco nd Ahas
Writ of Demolition. After the demolition, Spouses Cruz with
their sons, entered the property and represented themselves 11
owners of the property which was for lease.
Petitioners who were deployed by the City Mayor. ""°
were instructed by Governor Mendoza to protect, secure, an
maintain posse ssion of the property, entered the propcrtYPetitioners arrested the respondents and filed criminal charges
against them when they refused lo turn over the propertY
and when they shoved the petitioners. Thereafter, they filed a
petition for writ of amparo and habeas data.
Respondents averred that despite the Perman"%"'
Injunction, petitioners unlawfully entered the property wit
the use of heavy equipment, tore down the barbed wire fence

q tents, and arre sted them when they resisted petitioners
_ d that as early ns tn the evening or February 20, 2008,

""rae Pili»mine National Police had already camped
in front of the property.

Does the Rule on the Writ of Habeas Data apply in
this case'
HELD: NO. The coverage of the writs is limited to the
rotec tion of rights to life, liberty and security. And the
~ril-8 cover not only actual but also threats of unlawful acts or
omissions.
To thus be covered by the privilege of the writs, respondents must meet the threshold requirement that their right
lo life, ~ and ~ is violated or threatened with an
unlawful act or omission. Evidently, the present controversy
arose out of a property dispute between the Provincial
Government and respondents. Absent any considerable nexus
between the acts complained of and its effect on respondents
right to life. liberty and security, the Court will not delve on the
propriety of petitioners entry into the property.
Apropos is the Court's ruling in Tapuz v. Del Rosario:
To start off with the basics. the writ of amparo was
originally conceived as a response to the extraordinary rise
in the number of killings and enforced disappearances, and
to the perceived lack of available and effective remedies
to address these extraordinary concerns. It is intended to
address violations of or threats to the rights to life, liberty
or security, as an extr,mrdinRry and independent remedy
beyond those available under the prevailing Rules, or
a11 a remedy supplemental to these Rules. What it is
not, is a writ to protect concerns that are purely
property or commercial. Neither is it a writ that we
shall issue on amorphous and uncertain grounds.
Consequently, the Rule on the Writ of Amparo in line with
the extraordinary character of the writ and the reasonable
certainty that its issuance demands requires that every
petition for the issuance of the writ must be supported by
Justifying allegations of fact, to wit.
xxxx

The writ shall issue if the Court is preliminarily

P"stied with he prima facie existence of the ultimate

the aggrieved party was or is being committed . (Emphai
and italics in the original, citallon om1tt.t.-d)
Oddly, respondents also seek the issuance of a writ of
habeas data when it is not even alleged that petitioners are
gathering. collecting or storing dnta or information regarding
their person, family, home and correspondence.
It need not be underlined that respondents' petitiona for
wri ts of amparo and habeas data are cxtrnordinary remedies
which cannot be uS<.'<i a& tools to atoll the execution of a final and
executory decision in a property dispute.
AT ALL EVENTS, respondents' fling of the petitions for
writs of amparo and habeas data should have been barred, for
criminal proceedings against them had commenced after they
were arrested in flagrante delicto and proceeded against in
accordance with Sect ion 6, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court.

Like the writ of amparo, the writ of habeas data will net
issue to protect, under the context of the due process clause of the
Constitution, purely property or commercial concerns nor when the
grounds invoked in support of the petitions therefor are vague C(
doubtful. Employment constitutes a property right.
Manila Electric Company u. Lim
G.R. No. 184769, October 5, 2010
FACTS: Rosario G. Lim (respondent) is an administrative
clerk at MERA I.CO. In dune 2008, an anonymous letter was
posted at the door of the Metering Offce of the Administration
building of MERA LCO Plaridcl. Rulat:,rn Sec tor, at which
respondent is assigned, denouncing respondent. The letter
reads:
Cherry Lim:

Copies of the letter were also inserted in the lockers
MERAI.CO linc,;men. Informed sbout it, respondent re~rted
the matter to the Plaridel Station of the Philippine Nation
Police.

476

MERA LC O, by a memorandum, then directed the transfer
of respondent to MERA LC O's Alaba~g Sector in light of receipt
f reports that there were accusations and threats directed
gainst her from unknown individuals which could possibly
mpromise her safety and security. Respondent appealed her
:O.nsfer. She also opined that the sources of the threats being
unknown, the veracity were highly suspicious.
Respondent then filed a petition for writ of habeas data
citing petitioners' unlawful act and omission consisted of
their continued failure and refusal to provide her with details
or information about the alleged report which MERAL CO
purported ly received concerning threats to her safety .u.nd
security amount to a violation of her right to privacy in life,
liberty and security, cor-rectible by habeas data. Respondent
thus prayed for the issuance of a writ commandin g petitioners to
file a written return containing the following: (a) full disclosure
of the data or information about respondent in relation to the
report MERAL CO received on the alleged threat to her safety
and security, (b) measures taken by petitioners to ensure the
confidentiality of such data or information, and (c) currency and
accuracy of such data or information obtained. The Regional
Trial Court (RTC) issued a Temporary Restraining Order (THO)
and directed the petitioners to file their written return.
Petitioners moved for the dismissal of the petition and
recall of the TRO on the grounds that, inter alia, resort to a
P'ion for writ of habeas data was not in order; and the RTC

security as a remedy independently from those provided under
prevailing Rules.
Castillo u. Cruz underscores the emphasis laid down i}
Tapuz u. del Rosario that the writs of amparo and habeas data
will NOT issue to protect purely property or commercial concerns
nor when the grounds invoked in support of the petitions therefor
are vague or doubtful. Employment constitutes a property right
under the context of the due process clause of the Constitution.
It is evident that respondent's reservations on the real reasons
for her transfer - a le1:itimate concern respecting the term,
and conditions of one's employment - are what prompted her
to adopt the extraordinary remedy of habeas data Jurisdiction
over such concerns is inarguably lodged by law with the NLRC
and the Labor Arbiters.
In another vein, there is no showing from the factu
presented that petitioners committed any unjustifiable or
unlawful violation of respondents right to privacy ui,.Q,ui, the
right to life, liberty or security. To argue that petitioners refusal
to disclose the contents of reports allegedly received on the
threats to respondents safety amounts to a violation of her right
to privacy is at best speculative. Respondent in fact trivializes
these threats and accusations from unknown individuals in
her earlier-quoted portion of her July 10, 2008 letter as highly
suspicious, doubtful or are just mere jokes if they existed at all.
And she even suspects that her transfer to another place of work
betray[s] the real intent of management and could be a punitive
move. Her posture unwittingly concedes that the issue is laborrelated.

SEC. 2. Who May File. - Any aggrieved party
may file a petition for the writ of habeas data. However, in cases of extralegal killings and enforced
disappearances, the petition may be filed by:
(a) Any member of the immediate family of

Section 6 of the Rule on the Writ of Habeas Data requires
material allegations of ultimate facts in a petition for the issuam
of a writ of habeas data. In Tapuz u. Rosario,14 Spouses Sanson filed
a complaint for forcible entry against Tapuz and his co-petitioner
alleging that they were the registered owners of a certain parted
of land and that the petitioners entered into the property through
force and intimidation. The lower court ultimately ruled in favor o
Spouses Sanson. In a petition for certiorari fled with the Supre
Court, the petitioners also prayed for the issuance of a writ
habeas data for the release of a PNP report on the burning f thev
homes and the alleged acts of violence employed by Spouses San%

Upon its finality, the judgment shall be
enforced by the sheriff or any lawful officers as may
be designated by the court, justice or judge within
five (5) working days.
Substantial evidence required
An indispensable requirement before the privilege of the Writ
may be extended jg the showing, at least by substantial evideng
of an actual or threatened violation of the right to privacy in life·
liberty or security of the victim. The case of Roxas u. Arro~
involved petitioner's detention due to her alleged membership in
the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People's Army (CPP.
NPA). Ro xas was subsequently released, but seeking sanctuary
against the threat of future harm as well as the suppression of any
existing government files or records linking her to the communist
movement, she filed a Petition for the Writs of Amparo and Habea,
Data in the Supreme Court. The Court overturned the Court of
Appeals' grant of the petition for habeas data, ruling that there was
actually no evidence on record that shows that any of the public
respondents had violated or threatened the right to privacy of the
petitioner. The act ascribed by the Court of Appeals to the public
respondents that would have violated or threatened the right to
privacy of the petitioner, i.e., keeping records of investigations and
other reports about the petitioner's ties with the CPP.NPA, was not
adequately proven- considering that the origin of such reco rds
were virtually unexplained and its existence, clearly, only inferred
by the appellate court from the video and photograph released by
Re presentatives Palparan and Alcover in their press conference. No
evidence on reco rd even shows that any or the public respondent
had access to such video or photograph.
In Lee v. Ilagan," the subject matter of the case was an alleged
sex video involving respondent Police Superintendent Neri A.
Ilagan and another woman, which respondent sought to recover
fro m petitioner Dr. Joy Margate Lee, his former live-in partn~r.
Reversing the RTC decision granting the writ of habro-s data ID
favor or respondent, the Supreme Court pronounced:

"In this case, the Court finds that Ilagan wns not able

interest and any violation of his right to life, liberty or security.
Ide vd courts cannot speculate or contnve versions of possible
[~k asions. As the rules and exustin jurisprudeae o
the matter evoke, alleging and eventually proving the nexus
between one's privacy right to the cogent rights to life, liberty
or security are crucial in habeas data cases, so much so that
a failure on either account certainly renders a habeas data
petition dismissible, as in this case.
In fact, even discounting the insufficiency of the
allegations, the petition would equally be dismissible due
to the inadequacy of the evidence presented. As the records
show, all that Ilagan submitted in support of his petition was
bis self-serving testimo ny which hardly meets the substantial
evidence requirement as prescribed by the Habeas Data Rule.
This is because nothing therein would indicate that Lee actually
proceeded to commit any overt act towards the end of violating
llagan's righl to privacy in life, liberty or security. Nor would
anyth ing on reco rd even lead a reasonable mind to conclude
that Lee was going to use the subject video in order to achieve
unlawful ends - Ray for instance, to spread it to the public so
ts to ruin Ilagan's reputation. Contrastingly, Lee even made it
clear in. her testimony that the only reason why she reproduced
the subject video was to legitimately utilize the same as evidence

1.

Was the requirement of specificity met in this case ?

2.
Was petitioner able to discharge the burden of proof
to establish his claims for a writ of habeas data?

HELD,
1.
YES. The Court notes that the petition for the
issuance of the privilege of the writs of amparo and habeas
data is sufficient as to its contents. Anent the documents
sought to be the subject of the writ or habeas data prayed for.
the Court finds the requirement of specificity to have been
satisfied. The documents subject of the petition include the
order or battle, those linking the petitioner to the CPP and
those he signed involuntarily, and military intelligence report.a
making references to him. Although the exact locations and the
custodians of the documents were not identified, thifl does not
render the petition insufficient. Section 6(d) of the Ruic on the
Writ of Habeas Data is clear that the requirement of specificity
arises only when the exact locations and identities of the
custodians are known.
2.
NO The Court has ruled that in view of the
recognition of the evidentiary difficulties attendant lo the filing
of a petition for the privilege of the writs of amparo and habeas
data, not only direct evidence, but circumstantial evidence,
indicia, and presumptions may be considered, MO long as they
lead to conclusions consistent with the admissible evidence
adduced.
With the foregoing in mind, the Court atill Ands thal
the CA did not commit a reversible error in dt.>claring that no
substantial evidence exist to compel the grant of the reliefs
prayed for by the petitioner. The Court took a second look on t~
evidence on record and finds no reason to reconsider the den
of the issuance of the writs prayed for.
In the hearing before the CA. it was claimed that """

The

Section 19 of both the Rules on the Writ of Amparo and
Habeas Data is explicit that questions of fact and law can be
raised before the Court in a petition for review on certiorari
under Rule 45.
It cannot be overemphasized that Section 1 of both the
Rules on the Writ of Amparo and Habeas Dalo expressly include
in their coverage even threatened violations against a person's
right to life, liberty or security. Further, threat and intimidation
that vitiate the free will - although not involving invasion of
bodily integrty - nevertheless constitute a violation of the right
to security in the sense of "freedom from threat."
It must he stressed, however, that such "threat" must find
rational basis on the surrounding circumstances of the case. In
this case, the petition was mainly anchored on the alleged threats
•Kainst_his life, liberty and security by reason of his inclusion in
the military's order of battle, the surveillance and monitoring
acliVlt1es m~de on him, and the intimidation exerted upon him
to compel him to he a military asset. While as stated earlier,
mere threats fall within the mantle of protection of the writs of
anrro and habeas data, in the petitioner's case, the restraints
an threats allegedly made allegations lack corroborations, are
n: sdupported by independent and credible evidence, and thus
8
n on nebulous grounds.

identified as the one who told him that he was included in th
order of battle. The 2nd Infantry (Jungle Fighter) Division of
the Philippine Army also conducted an investigation pursuant
to the directive of AFP Chief of Staff Gen. Esperon, and it
was shown that the persons identified by the petitioners who

The appeal shall be given the same priority as
in habeas corpus and amparo cases.

Given that the totality of the evidence presented by
the petitioner failed to support his claims, the reliefs prayed

amparo and habeas data cases does not mean that a claimant
is dispensed with the onus of proving his case. "Indeed, even
the liberal standard of substantial evidence demands soma
adequate evidence."

"In the light of the foreg oing, the Court defers to
the Executive Branch on the matter of compensation and
rehabilitation
measures
through
diplomatic channels.
Resolution of these issues impinges on our relations with
another State in the context of common security interest8
under the VFA. It is settled that "[t)hc conduct of the foreign
relations of our government is committed by the Constitution
to the executive and legislative - 'the political' - departments of
the government, and the propriety of what may be done in the
exercise of this political power is not subject to judicial inquiry
or decision."

18 a petition for the issuance of a Writ of Kalikasan under the Rule

of Procedure for Environmental Cases (Rules), involving violations;
of envir onmental laws and regulations in relation to the gro unding
of the US military ship USS Guardian over the Tu bbataha Reels,
the Supreme Court declared:
"'Th e liberaliution of sta nding first enunciated in Op0sa ,
insofar as it refers to minors and generations yet unborn, is now
enshrined in the Rules which allows the filing of a citizen suit in
environmental cases. The provision on citizen suits in the Rule,
'collapses the traditional rule on personal and direct interest, 0
the principle that humans are stewards of nature."
As to the reliefs to wh..ich petitioners are entitled, the Supreme
Court further observed:
..We agree with respondents (Philippine officials) in
asserting that this petition has become moot in the sense that
the salvage operation sought to be enjoined or restrained had
already been accomplished when petitioners sought recourse
from this Court. But insofar s the directives to Philippine
respondents to protect and rehabilitate the coral reef structure
and marine habitat adversely affected by the ground_ing
incident are concerned, petitioners are entitled to these reliefs
notwithstanding the completion of the removal of the USS
Guardian from the core! reef."

The issue of locus standi was also raised in Resident Marine
Mammals of the Protected Seascape Tanon Strait v. Secretary
Angelo Reyes," which is
petition for certiorari. mandamus, and
injunction seeking the enforcement of our environmental laws. Do
resident marine mammals and stewards have legal standing to file
the petition? The Supreme Court ruled i.n the affirmative, as follows:
a

'"It had been suggested by animal rights advocates and
environmentalists that not only natural and juridical perso ns
should be given legal standing because of the difficulty for
persons, who cannot show that they by themselves are real
part1es-in•interests, to bring actions in representation of
these animals or inanimate objects. For this reason, many
envronmental cases have been dismissed for failure of the
petitioner to show that he/she would be directly injured or
%"ted by the outcome of the case. However, in our juri sdiction,
us standi in environmental cases has been gven a more
""PTalzed approach. Wh ile developments in Philippine legal
eory and Jurisprudence have not progressed as far as Justice
DouRlns's paradigm of legal standing for inanimate objects. the

or generations yet unborn, may ftle an
action to enforce rights or obligations under
environmental laws. Upon the filing of a citizen
suit, the court shall i,sut! u.n order which shall
contain a brief description of the cause of action
and the reliefs prayed for, requiring all interested
parties to manifest their interest to intervene in the
case within fifteen (15) days from notice thereof. The
plaintiff may publish the order once in a newspaper
of a general circulation in the Philippines or furnish
all affected barangays copies of said order.
Citizen suits filed under RA. No. 8749 and
RA. No. 9003 shall be governed by their respective
provisions. (Emphasis ours.)
Explaining the rationale for this rule. the Court, in the
Annotations to the Rules or Procedure for Environmental Cases,
commented:
Citizen suit. To further encourage the
protection or the environment, the Rules enable
litigants enforcing environmental rights to file their
cases as citizen suits. This provision liberalizes
standing for all cases filed enforcing environmental
laws and collapses the traditional rule on personal
and direct interest, on the principle that humans
are stewards of nature, The terminology or
the text reflects the doctrine first enunciated in
Oposa ti. Factoran, insofar as it refers to minors
and generations yet unborn. (Emphasis supplied,
citation omitted)
Althour,h this petition was fled in 2007, years before the
effectivity of the Rules of Procedure for Environmental Cases,
it has been consistently held that rules of procedure "may be
retroactively applied to actions pending and undetermined at
the time of their pRssage and will not violate any right of a
person who may feel that he is adversely affected, inasmuch at
there is no vested rights in rules of procedure."
Elucidating on this doctrine, the Court, in Systems Factor,
Corporation u. National Labor Relations Commission held that
Remedial statutes or statutes relating to
remedies or modes of procedure, which do not create
new or take away vested rights, hut only operate
in furtherance of the remedy or confirmation ol
rights alrendy existing, do not come within the

al conception or a retroactive law, or the general
'1e against retroactive operation of statutes.
,ates regulating the procedure of the courts
4Il be construed as applicable to actions pending
nd undetermined at the time of their passage.
Procedural Jaws are retroactive in that sense and to
that extent. xx.
Mreover, even before the Rules of Proc edure for
,r enal Cases became effective, this Court had already
permissive position on the issue of locus standi in
enal cases. I Ooa, we allowed the suit to be
brought in the name of generations yet unborn "based on the
concept of intergenerational responsibility insofar as the right
to a balanced and healthful ecology is concerned." Furthermore,
we said that the right to a balanced and healthful ecology, a
night that does not even need to be stated
our Constitution
it is assumed to exist from the inception of humankind,
811
carr es with it the correlative duty to refrain from impairing the
environment.

ak«

in

In light or the foregoing, the need to give the Resident
Marine Mammals legal standing has been eliminated by our
Rules, which allow any Filipino citizen, as a steward of nature,
to bring a suit to enforce our environmental laws. It is worth
nothing here that the Stewards are joined as real parties in the
Petition and not just in representation of the named cetacean
species. The Stewards, Ramos and Eisma-Osorio, having shown
in their petition that there may be possible violations of laws
concerning the habitat of the Resident Marine Mammals, are
therefore declared to possess the legal standing to file this
petition."

was shown by the petitioners, thus:
In this case. apart from repeated invocation of the
constitutional right to health and to a balanced and healthful
ecology and bare allegations that their right was violated, the
petitioners failed to show that public respondents are guilty of
any unlawful act or omission that constitutes a violation of the
petitioners' right to a balanced and healthful ecology.
Wh ile there can be no disagreement with the general
propositions put forth by the petitioners on the correlation of
air quality and public health, petitioners have not been able
to show that respondents arc guilty of violation or neglect of
environmental laws that causes or contributes to bad air quality.
Notably, apart from bare allegations, petitioners were not able
to show that respondents failed to execute any of the laws
petitioners cited. In fact, apart from adducing expert testimony
on the adverse effects of air pollution on public health, the
petitioners did not go beyond mere allegation in establishing the
unlawful acts or omissions on the part of the public respondents
that have a causal link or reasonable connection to the actual
or threatened violation of the constitutional right to a balanced
and healthful ecology of the magnitude contemplated under the
Rules, as required of petitions of this nature."

Rule 103-- Change of Name

CHAPTER XVII
CHANGE OF NAME, CORRECTION OF CLERICAL
ERRORS, AND CANCELLATION OR CORRECTION Of
ENTRIES IN CIVIL REGISTRY
RULE 103
CHANGE OF NAME

Purpose of the rule
Rule 103 procedurally governs judicial petitions for change o{
given name or surname, or both, pursuant to Article 376 of the Civil
Code, which prohibits persons from changing one's name or surname
without judicial authority. The objective of the rule is to prevent
fraud, since the rule involves substantial changes in a person's
name. This is because the state has an interest in the names borne
by individuals and entitles for purpose of identification. A change of
name is a privilege end not a right. Before a person can be authorized
to change the name given him either in his certificate of birth or in
the civil registry he must show proper or reasonable cause or any
compelling reason which may justify such change.:
This rule provides the procedure for an independent special
proceeding in court to establish the status of a person involving hi
relations with others, that is, his legal position in, or with regard to,
the rest of the community. In petitions for change of name, a person
avails of a remedy to alter the "designation by which he is know~
and called in the community in which he lives and is best known.
When granted, a person's identity and interactions are affected as
he bears a new "label or appellation for the convenience of the w~rl~
at large in addressing him, or in speaking of, or dealing with "",
Judmal perm1ss1on for a change of name aims to prevent fraud'
to ensure a record of the change by virtue of a court decree.'

ature o the proceedings
The proceeding under Rule 103 is also an action in rem which
.
publication of the order issued by the court to afford the
reguire~d all other interested parties to oppose the petition. When
the decision binds not only the parties imp»leaded but
hole world. N3 notice to all, publication serves to indefinitely
~; :u who might make an objection. "It is the publication of such
ice that brings in the whole world as a party in the case and vests

id±,

Officia l name
The only name that may be changed is the true or official name
recorded in the civil register. A person's name in the civil register,
for legal purposes, is his real name, because the civil register is
an official record of the civil status of persons. A name given to a
person in the church records or elsewhere or by which he is known
in the community - when at variance with that entered in the civil
register is unofficial and cannot be recognized as his real name.
SEC. 1. Venue.- A person desiring to change his
name shall present the petition to the Court of First

the City of Manila, to the Juvenile and Domestic

SEC. 2. Contents of petition. - A petition for
change of name shall be signed and verified by the
person desiring his name changed, or some other
person on his behalf. and shall set forth:
(a) That the petitioner has been a bona fide
resident of the province where the petition is filed
for at least three (3) years prior to the date of such
filing;
(b) The cause for which the change of the
petitioner's name is sought;

(c) The name asked for.
Contents of the petition
Jurisprudence has consistently held that in a petition for
change of name the title of the petition should include (1) the

applicant's real name, (2) his aliases or other names, if any, and (3)
the name sought to be adopted even if these data are found in the
body of the petition. For the publication to be valid end effective, the
published order should reproduce the title of the petition contairuoc
the data already stated and should contain correct information as to
(1) the name or names of the applicant; (2) the cause for the chanced
name, and (3) the new name asked for.'
The petition for change of name must be filed by the person
desiring to change his/her name, even if it may be signed and verified
by some other person in his behalf. Thus, in Republic v. Marcos,' lht
Court held that a mother cannot petition the change of name of her
minor daughter.
Jurisdictional defects
It has been held that the failure to include the true name""
party whose name is sought to be changed, in the title of the petltlthe
and of the notices published in connection therewith, precludes r
court from obtaining jurisdiction to entertain the same. More0v

over the pet1t1on.
Not only must the true name and the one prayed for be included
in the title, it must also be correctly spelled out. In Jayme S. Tan v.
Republic," the Supreme Court found the petition for change of name
defective. It considered the incorrect spelling of the petitioner's
e in the petition and the order as a substantial defect in the
"... order, because it did not correctly identify the party to
:d proceedings. Adopting the Solicitor General's arguments, the
Supreme Court held :
"Not only was it misleading to the courts of Justice, but
also prejudiced the interests of the general public. By said act,
he made it difficult or virtually impossible for anyone who might
have an adverse interest to oppose his petition. In the eyes of
the law therefore, petitioner has not complied strictly with the
legal requirement regarding publication, thereby rendering the
entire proceeding had in the court below null and void."

Jurisdictional requirements
Section 3 outlines the jurisdictional requirements before
1
petition for change oi name may proceed:
(1) The petition must be published before the hearing at lean
once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper of geDeral
circulation published in the province; and

(2)
state:

Both the title and the body of the petition must accurately
(a)

Names or aliases of the applicant;

That the petitioner has been a bona fide resident cl
the province where the petition is filed for at least three (3)
years prior to the date of such filing;
(b)

(c)

Cause for which the change of name is sought; and

(d)

New name asked for.

The reason for these requirements is that a change of name is
a matter of public interest. The petitioner might be in, the rogues
gallery or hiding to avoid service of sentence or compliance with a
judgment in a criminal case, or could have escaped from prison: or
if an alien, he might have given cause for deportation or might be
one against whom an order of deportation was issued or that the
new name the petitioner desires to adopt may be similar to that
of a respectable person and the latter might hove evidence that
petitioner is of unsavory reputation that might impair his own
good name. Reing a privilege and not a right, a change of name lits
within the discretion of the court give or withhold. Failure to comply
with these jurisdictional requirements, renders the proceedings
nullity."

(3)

Change will avoid confusion;

(4) When one has continuously used and been known
since childhood by a Filipino name, and was unaware of alien
parentage;
(5) Sincere desire to adopt Filipino name to erase signs
of former alienage, all in good faith and without prejudicing
anybody;
(6) Surname causes embarrassment and there is no
showing that the desired change of name was for a fraudulent
purpose or that the change of name would prejudice public
interest.
In granting or denying petitions for change of name, the question of proper and reasonable cause is left to the sound discretion of
the court. The evidence presented need only be satisfactory to the
court and not all the best evidence available. A special proceeding
for a change of name involves a judicious evaluation of the sufficiency and propriety of the justifications advanced in support thereof,
mindful of the consequent results in the event of its grant and with

alleging that the petition did not contain any of Sali's aliases.
Is Rule 108 the appropriate remedy for change of name
thereby dispensing of the requirement of stating the aliases
the petition?
HELD: YES. Sali was correct in usin Rule 108 for the
case ony involves correction of entries in the civil registry
However, it must be noted that at the time of application, RA
9048 was already in effect.
The petition for change of first name may be allowed,
among other grounds, if the new first name has been habitually
and continuously used by the petitioner and he or she has
been publicly known by that first name in the community. The
local city or municipal civil registrar or consul general has the
primary jurisdiction to entertain the petition. It is only when
such petition is denied that a petitioner may either appeal to
the civil registrar general or fle the appropriate petition with
the proper court.
The petition. insofar as it prayed for the change of Sali's
first name, was not within the RTC's primary jurisdiction. It was
improper because the remedy should have been administrative
which is the filing of the petition with the local civil registrar
concerned. For failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the
RTC should have dismissed the petition to correct Sali's first

surname

I Alfon u. Republic," a legitimate child was allowed by the
Supreme Court to continue using the surname of her mother rather
than that of her legitimate father as it serves her best interest and
there is no legal obstacle to prevent her from using the surname of
her mother to which she is entitled. Also, in Calderon u. Republic1"the
Supreme Court, upholding the best interest of the child concerned,
even allowed the use of a surname different from the surnames of
the child's father or mother.
In Republic v. Capote;io the Supreme Court allowed a minor to
change his surname to his mother's since he was never recognized
by his father while his mother has always recognized him as her
child. A change of name will erase the impression that he was ever
recognized by his father.
Indeed, the rule regarding the use of a child's surname is
second only to the rule requiring that the child be placed in the best
possible situation considering his circumstances.11
To summarize, our laws on the use of surnames state that
legitimate end legitimated children shall principally use the
~urn~me of the father. The Family Code gives legitimate children
.,,""""ear the surnames of ihe father and the mother, while
theirfath~rchildr~n shall_ use_ t~e s~rna~e of their mother, unless

No need for change of name by married woman
In case of annulment of marriage or divorce. there is no need
to file a petition for resumption of maiden name or surname. TM
true and real name of a person is that given to him and entered ii
the civil register which a woman may continue to use despite he,
marriage or cessation of marriage for whatever cause. The use of th~
husband's name is merely permissive which the wife may contint.tt
to use except in case of legal separation.n Thus, under Article 3i0ol
the Civil Code, a married woman may use:
(l) Her maiden first name end surname and add he
husband's surname,
(2)

Her maiden first name and her husband's surnamt,

or
(3) Her husband's full name, but prefixing g word
indicating that she is his wife, such as "Mrs."

On the other hand, Article 372 provides that when Jepl
separation has been granted, the wife shall continue using her ns
and surname employed before the legal separation.

r the change of his first name was. his sex reassignment. He
!tended to make ~1s firs~ name compatible with the sex he thought
transformed himself into through surgery. However, a change
of naiJle does not alter one's legal capacity or civil status. Republic
Na, 9048 does not sanction a change of first name on the ground
~tsex reassignment. Rather than avoiding confusion, changing
titioner's first name for his declared purpose may only create
:ave complications in the civil registry and the public interest.
Before a person can legally change his given name, he must
present proper or reasonable cause or any compelling reason
justifying such change. In addition, he must show that he will be
prejudiced by the use of his true and official name. In this case,
Silverio failed to show, or even allege, any prejudice that he might
suffer as a result of using his true and official name. In sum, the
petition in the trial court in so far as it prayed for the change
of petitioner's first name was not within that court's primary
jurisdiction as the petition should have been filed with the local civil
registrar concerned, assuming it could be legally done. It was an
improper remedy because the proper remedy was administrative
that is, that provided under Republic Act No. 9048. It was also filed
in the wrong venue as the proper venue was in the Office of the
~ivil Registr~r of Manila where his birth certificate is kept. More
importantly, it had no merit since the use of his true and official
name does not prejudice him at all.

pRORS• AN

AB observed in Lee v. Court ofAppeals.
The above law speaks clearly. Clerical or typomraphical
in entries of the civil register are now to be corrected
""""ea «hoot nsea or a judicial order and by the city or
ipal civil registrar or consul general. The obvious effect is
o remove from the ambit of Rule 108 the correction or changing
uch errors in entries of the civil register. Hence, what is left
p, the scope of operation of Rule 108 are substantial changes
and corrections in entries of the civil register. This is precisely
the opposite of what Ty Kong Tin and other cases of its genre
had said, perhaps another indication that it was not sound
doctrine after all.
It may be very well said that Republic Act No. 9048 is
Congress' response to the confusion wrought by the failure to
delineate as to what exactly is that so-called summaryprocedure
for changes or corrections of a harmless or innocuous nature as
distinguished from that appropriate adversary proceeding for
changes or corrections of a substantial kind. For we must admit
that though we have constantly referred to an appropriate
adversary proceeding, we have failed to categorically state just
what that procedure is. Republic Act No. 9048 now embodies
that summary procedure while Rule 108 is that appropriate
adversaryproceeding."

by Republic Act No. 10172. As amended, the following entries
now be changed through administrative proceedings:
may
(1)

First name;

(2)

Nickname;

(3)

Day and month in the date of birth; and

(4)

Sex.

The law is also clear that administrative correction of entn
must not involve any change of: (a) nationality, (b) age, and (
status. Thus, although a person's citizenship was inadvertedly al
mistakenly entered as "Chinese" instead of"Filipino," the jurisdiction
of the court to order the correction or alteration of entries in the cirl
registry, allowed under Article 412 of the Civil Code, is limited only
to innocuous or clerical mistakes."
Under said law, jurisdiction over applications for change U
first name is now primarily lodged with administrative officers. Th,
law now excludes the change of first name from the coverage of Rule
103 "until and unless an administrative petition for change of name
is first filed and subsequently denied" and removes "correction or
changing of clerical errors in entries of the civil register from the
ambit of Rule 108." Hence, what is left for the scope of operation of
the rules are substantial changes and corrections in entries of the
civil register." In sum, the remedy and the proceedings regulating
change of first name are primarily administrative in nature, not
judiciaJ.n
Who may and where to file the petition
An administrative proceeding for correction of clerical error
pursuant to Republic Act No. 9048 may be initiated by any per
having direct and personal interest in such correction. A person ts

roceeding summary in nature. However, it ia also true that a
;»t in law may be enforced and a wrong may be remedied as
log as the appropriate remedy is used. This Court adheres to
+he principle that even substantial errors in a civil registry may
be corrected and the true facts established provided the parties

aggrieved by the. error avail themselves of the appropriate
adversary proceeding. As a matter of fact. the opposition of the
Solicitor General dated February 20, 1970 while questioning the
use ofArticle 412 of the Civil Code in relation to Rule 108 of the
Revised Rules of Court admits thut "the entries sought to be
corrected should be threshed out in an appropriate proceeding."
What is meant by "appropriate adversary proceeding"?
Black's Law Dictionary defines "adversary proceeding as follows:

One having opposing parties; contested, as
distinguished from an ex parte application, one
of which the party seeking relief has given legal
warning to the other party, and afforded the latter
an opportunity to contest it. Excludes an adoption
proceeding.

Nature of proceedings
Jurisprudence provides that Rule 108 should be limited
solely to implementation of Article 12, the substantive Jew Oil
the matter of correcting errors in the civil register. Article 412
contemplates a summary proceeding, involving correction of clerical
errors, or a harmless. innocuous nature, not changes involvint
civil status, nationality or citizenship, which are substantial an&'
or controversial. However, not all actions filed under Rule 108
are summary in nature. For instance. the fact that the petition is
published once a week for three consecutive weeks, the Solicitor
General was served with copies of the petition as well as notict:1
of hearing, the Solicitor opposed the petition, among other
strongly indicates that the proceeding is adversarial. Republic F
Valencia.n clarifies when the proceedings are considered summan·
or adversarial:
It is undoubtedly true that if the subject matter o
a petition is not for the correction of clerical errors of 8
harmless and innocuous nature, but one involving nationality
or citizenship, which is indiaputably substantial as well
as conirovertcd, affirm11tive relief cannot be granted in •

With respect to the correction in Carlita's birth
certificate of his name from "CHrlito ,John" to "Carlito," the
same was properly granted under Rule 108 of the Rules of
Court. As correctly pointed out by the C[ourt] [of] A[ppeals],
the cancellation or correction of entries involving changes of
name falls under letter "6" of the following provision of Section
2 of Rule 108: "Entries subject to cancellation or correction.
- Upon good and valid grounds, the following entries in the
civil rcgist.cr may be cancelled or corrected: x xx(o) changes of
name." Hence, while the jurisdictional requirements of Rule 103
(which governs petitions for change of name) were not complied
with. observance of the provisions of Rule 108 suffices to effect
the correction sought for."

Entries subject to cancellation or correction under Rule 108
relation to Republic Act No. 9048
The obvious effect of Republic Act No. 9048 is merely to make
possible the administrative correction of clerical or typographical
errors or change of first name or nickname in entries in the cil
register, leaving to Rule 108 the correction of substantial changes i
the civil registry in appropriate adversarial proceedings. 11 Republic
Act No. 9048 is Congress' response to the confusion wrought by th
failure to delineate as to what exactly is that so-called summaryprocedure for changes or corrections of a harmless or innocuo:.a
nature as distinguished from that appropriate adversary proceednf
for changes or corrections of a substantial kind. Republic Acl No.

DCANCELLATION OR CORRECTION OF ENTRIES IN CIVIL REGISTy

under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court are those provided in Ara,,
1
407 and 408 of the Civil Code." The acts, events or factual e
contemplated under Article 407 of the Civil Code include event~
that occur after birth. However, ~o reasonable interpretation or°:
provision can justify the conclusion that it covers the correction' e
the ground of sex reassignment. To correct simply means "to ma:
or set aright; to remove the faults or error from" while to chant!
means "to replace something with something else of the same kind
or with something that serves as a substitute." The Court declared
that Silverio's birth certificate contained no error. All entries
therein. including those corresponding to his first name and ser
were all correct. No correction was necessary.

Besides, granting that Rule 103 applies to this case and
hat compliance with the procedural requirements under Rule
g8
falls
short of what is mandated, it still cannot be denied that
1
Mercadera complied with the requirement for an adversarial
roceeding before the lower court. The publication and posting
:r the notice of hearing in a newspaper of general circulation
and the notices sent to the OSG and the Local Civil Registry
are sufficient indicia of an adverse proceeding. The fact that no
one opposed the petition, including the OSG, did not deprive
the court of its jurisdiction to hear the flame and did not make
the proceeding less adversarial in nature. Considering that the
QSG did not oppose the petition and the motion to present its
evidence ('x.parte when it had the opportunity to do so, it cannot
now complain that the proceedings in the lower court were
procedurally defective."

Correction of names under Rulo 108
In Republic v. Mercadera,•' the state, through the Office
of the Solicitor General (OSG), argued that the conversion from
"MARILYN" to "MERLYN" is not a correction of an innocuous error
but a material correction tantamount to a change of name which
entails a modification or increase in substantive rights. For the
OSG, this was a substantial error that requires compliance with the
procedure under Rule 103, and not Rule 108.
The Court disagreed with the OSG, holding that the petitioo
filed by Mercadera before the RTC correctly falls under Rule 108 as
it simply sought a correction of a misspelled given name. To correct
simply means "to mnke or set aright; to remove the faults or error
from." To change means "to replace something with something else
of the same kind or with something that serves es a substitute."
From the allegations in her petition, Mercadera clearly prayed for
the lower court "to remove the faults or error" from her registered
given name "MARILYN," and "to make or set aright" the same "
conform to the one ahe grew up to, "MERLYN." It further held:

already married to a certain Ye Son Sune, a Korean Nation,j
on June 24, 2002, at the Office of the Municipal Trial Court i
Cities (MTCC), Palace of Justice. She denied having contracted
said m11.mage ~nd cle.1med that she did not know the alleged
husband; she did not appear before the solemnizing offir.cr; and,
that the signature appearing in the marriage certificate is not
hers. She, thus, filed a Petition for Cancellation of Entries in
the Marriage Contract, especially the entries in the wife portion
thereof. Respondent impleaded the Loca l Civil Registrar of Cebu.
City, as well as her alleged husband, as parties to the cue .
Afte r trial, the RTC gra nted the petition. Hut the decision
was appealed by the Republic of the Philippines through the
Office of the Solicitor General, to the Supreme Court, claiming
tbat there arc no errors in the entries sought to be cancelled
or corrected, because the entries made in the certificate of
marriage are the ones provided by the person who appeared and
represented herself as Merlinda L Olaybar and arc, in fact, the
latter's perso nal circumstances. In directing the cancellation of
the entries in the wife portion of the certificate of marriage, the
RTC. in effect, declared the marriage null and void ab initio.
Thus, the petition instituted by respondent is actually a petition
for declaration of nullity of marriage in the guise of a Rule 108
proceeding.

Is the Republic's appeal meritorious?
HELD: NO. In filing the petition for correction of entry
under Rule 108, respondent made the Loe .al Civil Registrar
of Cebu City, as well as her alleged husband Ye Son Sune.
as parties-respondents. It is likewise undisputed that the
procedural rcquirement.9 aet forth in Rule 108 were complied
with. The Office of the Solicitor General was likewise notified
of the petition which in turn authorized the Office of the City
Prosecutor to participate in the proceedings. More importantly,
lriol wee conducted where respondent herself, the stenographer
of the court where the allcccd mRrriage was conducted. as well
as a document examiner, testified. Several documents were
also considered as evidence. With the testimonies and other
evidence presented , the trial court found that the signatur
appearing in the subject marriage certificate wns different from
respondent's signature appearing in some of her governme
issued identification cards. The court thus made a cntci:oncal
conclusion that respondent's signature in the mllrria~
certificate was not html end, therefore, wns forged. Clearly. "
was established that, as she claimed in her petition, no such
marriage was celebrated.

Aside from the certificate of marriage, no such evidence
was presented to show the existence of marr iage. Rather,
respondent showed by overwhelming evidence that no marriage
was entered into and that she was not even aware of such
i stence. The testimonial and documentary evidence clearly
:stablishcd that the only "evidence" of marriage which is the
marriage certificate was fl forgery. Wh ile we maintain that Rule
108 cannot be availed of to determine the validity of marriage,
we cannot nullify the proceedings before the trial court where
all the parties had been Riven the opportunity to contest the
allegations or respondent; the proc edures were followed, and
all the evidence of the parties had already been admitted and
examined. Respondent indeed sought, not the nullification
of marriage as there was no ma rriage to speak of, but
the correction of the record of such marriage to reflect
the truth as set forth by the evidence. Otherwise stated,
in allowing the correction of the subject certificate of
mar riage by cancelling the wife portion thereof, the trial
court did not., in any way, declare the marriage void as
there was no marriage to speak of.

Reiterating Labayo-Rowe v. Republic," the Supreme Co
instructs that "changes which may affect the civil status f ttrt
legitimate to illegitimate. . are substantial and controve 1'0Qi
alterations which can only be allowed after appropriate adver:5laj
proceedings .." Since respondent's desired change affects hie c:
status from legitimate to illegitimate, Rule 108 applies. In Coseeng.
Magpayo, the petition was erroneously filed in Quezon City aid
not in Makati City where his birth certificate was registered. T
respondent's further failure to implead the civil register of Maitti
City and his parents rendered the petition fatally defective. Th,
when a petition for cancellation or correction of an entry in the eil
register involves substantial and controversial alterations including
those on citizenship, legitimacy of paternity or flition, or legitimacy
of marriage, a strict compliance with the requirements of Rule 108
is mandated."
Correcting the entry on petitioner's birth certificate that his
parents were married on December 23, 1983 in Bicol to "not married"
is a substantial correction requiring adversarial proceedings. Said
correction is substantial as it will affect his legitimacy and convert
him from a legitimate child to an illegitimate one. Corrections of
entries in the civil register including those on citizenship,
legitimacy of paternity or fliation, or legitimacy of marriage
involve substantial alterations. Substantial errors in a civil
registry may be corrected and the true facts established provided the
parties aggrieved by the error avail themselves of the approprialt

No petition for declaratlon of presumptive death
In Lukban v. Republic, 1 petitioner filed a petition to declare
her husband presumptively dead due to his absence for around 20
years. The Supreme Court declared that her petition cannot prosper
because it is not authorized by law:
Th e philosophy behind the ruling that such judicial
pronouncement cannot be mode in a proceeding of this nature
is weU expresse d in the case above-cited. Thus, we there said
that 'A judicial pronouncement to that effect, even if final and
executory, would still be a prima face presumption only. It
is still disputable. It is for that reason that it cannot be the
subject of a judicial pronouncement or declaration. if it is the
only question or mutter involved in a case, or upon which a
"SP9"Ptent court has to pass. It is, therefore, clear that a judicial
e.:::larat1on that a person is presumptively dead, because he had
been unherd from in seven years, being a presumption juris
~ant~m only, subject to contrary proof, cannot reach the st.age of
nality or bec ome final.'a

dect Th~s, there is no such thing as an independent action for
4"""ion of presumption of death. The presumption may arise
e invoked in an action or special proceeding.

As an exception, under Article 41 of the Family Code, for tilt
purpose of the present spouse contracting a second marriage, he
she must file a summary proceeding for declaration of presumptive
death of the absentee, without prejudice to the latter's rcappcaran~.
This is intended to protect the present spouse from criminal

With a judicial declaration that the missing spouse is presumptive];
dead, good faith of the present spouse in contracting marriage it

Under Article 41 of the Family Code, a marriage contracted
by any person during the subsistence of a previous marriage shall
be null and void, unless before the celebration of the subsequent
marriage, the absent spouse was absent for:
4 consecutive years - spouse present had a well•
founded belief that absent spouse was already dead

forth in Art. 391 of the Civil Code, viz.:
(1) A person on board a vessel lost during a sea voyage,

(2) A person in the armed forces who has taken part in

Remedy against fraudulently obtained Judgment declar
presumptive death
Santo v. Santos
GR. No. 1877061, October 8, 2014

FACTS: Ricardo Santos (Ricardo) filed a petition for the
declaration of absence or presumptive death of his wife, Celer
for purposes of remarriage. Ricardo alleged that he and Celenna
'JUSTICE ALICIA V. SEMPIO DIY, HANDBOOK ON THE FAMILY
OF THE PHILIPPINES, 1996 ed.,p. 69.

.

:.Tarlac City, but because their business did not prosper,

!11.itns that despite his efforts to locate her, he never heard of
erina since she left for Hong Kong He supposedly fled the
tution 12 years after Celerinn left for Hong Kong. The lower
pe rt granted the petition and declared Celerina presumptively
July 27, 2007. Ricardo remarried on September 17,

I.

2008.
According to Celerina, she only found out about the petition
Ricardo filed when she could no longer avail of the remedies
of new trial, appeal, petition for relief from judgment. Thus,
Celerina fled a petition for annulment ofjudr.ment, alleging that
she never left the country and that she had never been absent
for 12 years. Celerina claims that it was Ricardo who left their
conjugal dwelling in May 2008 to cohabit with another woman.
The Court of Appeals dismissed Celerina's petition stating that
the proper remedy was for her to file a sworn statement before
the civil registry, declaring her reappearance in accordance with
Article 42 of the Family Code.
Did the Court of Appeals err in dismissing Celerina's
petition for annulment ofjudgment for being a wrong remedy for
a fraudulently obtained judgment declaring presumptive death?
HELD: YES. Celerina fled her petition for annulment of
judgment on November 17, 2008. This was less than two years
from the July 27, 2007 decision declaring her presumptively
dead and about a month from her discovery of the- decision in
October 2008. The petition was, therefore, filed within the fouryear period allowed by law in case of extrinsic fraud, and before
the action is barred by laches, which is the period allowed in
case of lack of jurisdiction.
The Family Code provides that it is the proof of absence of
:C~POU6€? for four consecutive years, coupled with a. well-founded
,He[by the present spouse that the absent spouse is already
d, that constitutes a justification for a second marriage

The existence of these conditions means that reappearanee
does not always immediately cause the subsequent marriage'
termination. Heapperance of the absent or presumptively dead
spouse will cause the termination of the subsequent marriage
only when all the conditions enumerated in the Family Code
are present.
Hence, the subsequent marriage may still subsist despite
the absent or presumptively dead spouse'::1 reappearance (1)
if the first marriage has already been annulled or has been
declared a nullity; (2) if the sworn statement of the reappearance
is not recorded in the civil registry of the subsequent spouse-a'
residence; (3) if there is no notice to the subsequent spousts; or
(4) if the fact of reappearance is disputed in the proper court,
of law, and no judgment is yet rendered confirming, such fact of
reappearance.
When subsequent marriages are contracted after a judicial
declaration of presumptive death, a presumption arises that the
first spouse is already dead and that the second marriage it
legal. This presumption should prevail over the continuance of
the marital relations with the first spouse. The second marriage,
as with all marriages, is presumed. valid. The burden of proof to
show that the first marriage was not properly dissolved rests on
the person asaailin g the validity of the seco nd marriage.
Thia court recogn ized. the conditional nature al
reappearance as a cause for terminating the subsequent
marriage in Social Security System u. Vda. de Bailon. This court
noted that mere reappearance will not terminate the subsequent
marnge even if the parties to the subsequent marriage
were notified if there was Mno step ... taken to terminate
the subsequent marriage, either by [filing an) affidavit (of'
reappearance] or by court action(.)" "Sine<! the second marriage
has been contracted because of a presumption that the former
spouRP. is dcud, such presumption continues inspite of the
spouse's physical reappearance, and by fiction of law, he or she
must still be regarded as legally an absentee until the subsequen
ma rriag e is terminated as provided by law."
A subsequent marriage contracted in bad faith, even if it
was contracted after a court declaration of presumptive death,
lacks the requirement of a well.founded belief that the 11pouse
is already dead. The firat marriage will not be considered
validly terminated. Marriages contracted prior o the vali
termination of a subsisting marriage are generally conKtder~
bigamous and void. Only II subsequent marriage contracted
good faith is prolL'CtL-<l by law.

I

CHAPTER XVIII-- ABSENTEES
Rule I07 Absentee
Therefore, the party who contracted the subsequent
rriage in bad faith is also not immune from an action to
hi s subsequent marri age void for being bigamous. The
rhibition against marriage during the subsistence of another
marriage still applies.

I,_

If, as Celerina contends, Ricardo was in bad faith when he
filed his petition to declare her presumptively dead and when
he contracted the subsequent marriage, such marriage would
be considered. void for being bigamous under Article 35(4) of
the Family Code. This is because the circumstances lack the
element of "well-founded belief" under Article 41 of the Family
Code, which is essential for the exception to the rule against
bigamous marriages to apply.
The provision on reappearance in the Family Cod e as a
remedy to effect the termination of the subsequent marriage
does not preclude the spouse who was declared presumptively
dead from availing of other remedies existing in law. This
court bad, in fact, recognized that a subsequent marriage
may also be terminated by filing "an action in court to prove
the reappearance of the absentee and obtain a declaration of
dissolution or termination of the subsequent marriage.n
Celerina does not admit to have been absent. She also
eeks not merely the termination of the subsequent marriage
but also the nullification of its effects. She contends that
reappearance is not A sufficient remedy because it will only
terminate the subsequent marriage but not nullify the effects
of the declaration of her presumptive death and the subsequent
marriage.
Celerina is correct. Since an undisturbed subsequent
marriage under Article 42 of the Family Code is valid until
"7nated, the "children of such marriage shall be considered

The Family Code was explicit that the court's judgment
in summary proceedings, such as the declaration of presumptive
death of an absent spouse under Article 41 of the Family Code,
shall be immediately final and executory.

F

Article 41, in relation to Article 247, of the Family Code
provides:

erroneous, therefore, on the part of the RTC
give due course
to the Republic's appeal and order the transmittal of the entire
records of the case to the Court of Appeals.

Art. 41. A marriage contracted by any person
during subsistence of a previous marriage shall be
null and void. unless before the celebration of the
subsequent marriage, the prior spouse had been
absent for four consecutive years and the spouse
present has a well-founded belief that the absent
spouse was already dead. In case of disappearance
where there is danger of death under the
circumstances set forth in the provisions of Article
391 of the Civil Code, on absence of only two years
shall be sufficient.

An appellate court acquires no jurisdiction to review a
judgment which, by express provision of law, is immediately final
and executory. As we have said in V~loria u. Comelec, "the right
to appeal is not a natural right nor is it a part of due process,
for it is merely a statutory privilege." Since. by express mandate
of Article 247 of the Family Code, all judgments rendered in
summary judicial proceedings in Family Law are "immediately
final and executory," the right to appeal was not granted to
any of the parties therein. The Republic of the Philippines, as
opposit.or in the petition for declaration of presumptive death,
should not be treated differently. It had no right to appeal the
RTC decision of November 7, 2001."

For the purpose of contracting the subsequent
marriage under the preceding paragraph the spouse
present must institute a summary proceeding
as provided in this Code for the declaration of
presumptive death of the absentee, without prejudice
to the effect of reappearance of the absent spouse.
Art. 247. The judgment of the court shall be

Strict standard approach consistent with the state's poly
to protect and strengthen marriage
Further, the Supreme Court, in Cantor, stressed: "The Court,
fully aware of the possible collusion of spouses in nullifying their
marriage, has consistently applied the 'strict standard' approach.
This is to ensure that a petition for declaration of presumptive
death under Article 41 of the Family Code is not used as a led
to conveniently circumvent the laws. Courts should never all
procedural shortcuts and should ensure that the stricter standard
required by the Family Code is met."
In fact. the rationale for the strict standard approach was also
articulated in Republic v. Court of Appeals (Tenth Dw.), viz.:
"In view of the summary nature of proceedings under
Article 41 of the Family Code for the declaration of presumptive
death of one's 1,pouse, Che degree of due diligence set by this
Honorable Court in the above-mentioned cases in locating the
wherenbouts of a missing spouse must be strictly complied with.
There have been times when Article 41 of the Family Code had
been resorted to by parties wishing to remarry knowing rully
well that their alleged missing spouses are alive nd well. It
is even possible that those who cannot have their marriages
declared null and void under Article 36 of the Family Code
resort to Article 41 of the Family Code for relief because o' th e
summary nature of its procecdings."W

We need only to cite the instances when this Court, on

Rationale for multiple appeals

Multiple appeals are permitted in special Proceedings 68
practical recognition of the possibility that mate~inl is.sues maa
be finally determined at various stages of the spr.c1al proceeding/
Section 1, Rule 109 of the Rules of Court underscores the multi,.
part nature of special proceedings by enu~erating the Particul&r
judgments and final orders already subject of appeal by any
interested party despite other parts of the proceedings being stl]
untried or unresolved.
In this multi-appeal mode, the probate court loses jurisdiction
only over the subject matter of the appeal but retains jurisdicti
over the special proceeding from which the appeal was taken for
purposes of further remedies the parties may avail of.'
Where multi-appeals are allowed, a separate petition for
certiorari may be allowed on an interlocutory aspect of the case that
is separate and distinct as an issue from the aspect of the case that
has been adjudged with finality by the lower court. In Brio,ies u.
Henson-Cruz, the matter appealed was the special administrator's
commission, a charge that is effectively a claim against the estate
under administration, while the matter covered by the petition for
certiorari was the appointment of an auditor who would pass upon the
special administrator's final account. The Supreme Court ruled that
by their respective natures, these matters can exist independently ix"
one another and can proceed separately as envisioned by the Rules
under Rule 109.°
When record on appeal required
Rule 109 contemplates multiple appeals during the penden!
of special proceedings. A record on appeal - in addition to the notice
of appeal - is thus required to be filed as the original records of the
case should remain with the trial court to enable the rest of the ca:
to proceed in the event that a separate and distinct issue is Te"!""
by said court and held to be final.' Thus, in Republic u. Nishina,

Art. 66. The reconciliation referred to in the preceding
Articles shall have the following consequences:

"8""",nae tier to obtain a legal separation, which may express
~plied from the acts of the parties. There would be collusion
?f h parties had arranged to make it appear that a matnmomal
had been committed although it was not, or if the parties
+ad connived to bring about a legal separation even in the absence
of grounds therefor.
Collusion is sought to be prevented in all cases for legal
separation as well as annulment and declaration of nullity of
marriage. The rationale therefor was amplified in 1'uazon u. Court
of Appeals,' thus:

696

(l) The legal separation proceedings, if still pending,
shall thereby be terminated at whatever stage; and
(2)
The final decree of legal separation shall be set
aside, but the separation of property and any forfeiture of the
share of the guilty spouse already effected shall subsist, unless
the spouses agree to revive their former property regime.
The court's order containing the foregoing shall be
recorded in the proper civil registries.
Art. 67. The agreement to revive the former prope rty
regime referred to in the preceding Article shall be executed
under oath and shall specify:
(1)
regime;

The properties to be contributed anew to the restored

(2) Those to be retained as separated properties of each
spouse; and
(3) The names of all their known creditors, their
addresses and the amounts owing to each.
The agreement of revival and the motion for its approval
shall be filed with the court in the same proceeding for legal
separation, with copies of both furnished to the creditors named
therein. After due hearing, the court shall, in its order, take
measure to protect the interest of creditors and such order shall
be recorded in the proper registries of properties.
The recording of the ordering in the registries of property
shall not prejudice any creditor not listed or not notified, unless
the debtor-spouse has sufficient separate properties to satisfy
the creditor's claim."
Collusion

Article 60 of the Family Code provisions on legal sepsratiOO
states that no decree of legal separation shall be based up0n:
stipulation of facts or a confession of judgment, and that in 11.0Y: 1~
the court shall order the prosecuting attorney or fiscal 4""e

Collusion in legal separation means the agreement betW;;'.
husband and wife for one of them to commit, or to appear to"",,al
or to be represented in court as having committed, a matrm

{1,

NA grant of annulment of marriage or legal separation
by default is fraught with the danger of collusion. Hence, in
all cases for annulment, declaration of nullity of marriage and
legal separation, the prosecuting attorney or fiscal is ordered
to appear on behalf of the state for the purpose of preventing
any collusion between the parties and to take care that their
evidence is not fabricated or suppressed. If the defendant
spouse fails to answer the complaint, the court cannot declare
him or her in default but instead, should order the prosecuting
attorney to determine if collusion exists between the parties.
The prosecuting attorney or fiscal may oppose the application
for legal separation or annulment through the presentation of
his own evidence, if in bis opinion, the proof adduced is dubious
and fabricated. Our Constitution is committed to the policy
of strengthening the family as a basic social institution. Our
family law is based on the policy that marringe is not a mere
contract, but a social institution in which the state is vitally
lht~restcd. The state can find no stronger anchor than on good,
aoh.d and happy families. The break-up of families weakens our
social and moral fabric and, hence, their preservation is not the
concern alone of the family members.
a r ~e facts in the case at bar do not call for the strict
PP' cation of Arieles 48 and 60 of the Family Code. For one.

was characterized by a no.holds barred contes t and not }y
collusion.
The role of the prosecuting attom1:>y or fiscal in annulment
of marringe and legal sepration proceedings is to determine
whether collusion exists between the parties and to take care
thut the evidence is not suppressed or fabricated. Petitioner's
vehement opposition to the annulment proceedings negates the
conclusion that collusion existed between the parties. There is
no allegation by the petitioner that evidence was suppressed
or fabricated by any of the parties. Under these circumstances,
we are convinced that the non-intervention of a prosecuting
attorney to assure "lack of collusion between the contending
parties is not fatal to the validity of the proc eedings in the trial."

Appointment of administrator of conjugal properties after filing of
petition for legal separation
The law grants to the spouses joint administration over the
conjugal properties as clearly provided in Article 124 of the Family
Cod e. However, Article 61 states that after a petition for legal
separation has been filed, the trial court shall, in the absence of
a written agreement between the couple, appoint either one of the
spouses or a thir d perso n to act as the administrator.
However, implied appointment was recognized in Sabalones

Court of Appeals:
"Wh ile it is true that no formal designation of the
administrator has been made, such designation was implicit in
the decision of the trial court denying the petitioner any share
in the conjugal properties (and thus also disqualifying him as
administrator thereof). That dcsir,nntion was in effect approved
by the Court of Appeals when it issued in favor of the respondent
wife the preliminary injunction now under challenge.'

This is an action in rem, for it concerns the status of the
rties herein, and status affects or binds the whole word. The

Prosecutor required to Intervene In proceedings
The intervention of the prosecutor is required under Artie(
of the Family Code, viz.:
e 48
In all cases of annulment or dP.Claration of ~bsolute nullity
of mamagc, the Cuurt shall order the prosecuting attorney or
fiscal assigned to it to appear on behalf of the State to take steps
to prevent collusion between the parties and to take care that
evidence is not fabricated or suppressed. xx x"

The purpose is to prevent collusion. However, in Tuazon
Court of Appeals,' the facts of the case did not call for the strict
application of Articles 48 and 60 of the Family Code, thus:
"For one, petitioner was not declared in default by the trial
court for failure to answer. Petitioner filed his answer to the
complaint and contested the cause of action alleged by private
respondent. He actively participated in the proceedings below
by filing several pleadings and cross-examining the witnesses
of privaw respondent. It is crystal clear that every stage of the
litigation was characterized by a no-holds barred contest and
not by collusion.
The role of the prosecuting attorney or fiscal in annulment
of marriage and legal separation proceedings is to determine
whether collusion exists between the parties and to take care
that the evidence is not suppressed or fabricated. Petitioner's
vehement opposition to the annulment proceedings negates the
conclusion that collusion existed between the parties. There it
no allegation by the petitioner that evidence was suppressed
or fabricated by any of the parties. Under these circumstance,
we are convinced that the non-intervention of a prosecuting
attorney to assure lack of collusion between the contending
parties is not fatal to the validity of the proceedings in tho trial
court."

Nature of an action for annulment of marriage
The nature of an action for annulment of marriage was
expounded in Rayray v. Chae Kyung Lee," as follows:
GR No 116607, April 10, 1996.
aaass"
Art 60 No decree of legal 11cparatior. shall be hosed upon a ittP

GR. No. L18176, October 26, 1966.

P"",a

; the present case is the relation between said parties, or
heir marriage tie. Jurisdiction over the same depends upon the
], aLuy or domicile of the parties, not the place of celebration
of marriage, or the locus celebrationis. Plaintiff here is a citizen
of the Philippines, domiciled therein. His status is, therefore,
ubject to our jurisdiction, on both counts. True that defendant
and- under plaintiffs- theory still is a non-resident alien.
But, this fact does not deprive the lower court of its jurisdiction
to pass upon the validity of her marriage lo plaintiff herein.
Indeed, marriage is one of the cases of double status, in
that the status therein involves and affects two persons. One is
married, never in abstract or a vacuum, but, always to somebody
else. Hence, a judicial decree on the marriape status or a person
necessarily reflects upon the status of another and the relation
between them. The prevailing rule is, accordingly, that a court
has jurisdiction over the res, in an action for annulment or
marriage, provided, at least, one of the parties is domiciled in. or
a national of, the forum. Since plaintiff is a Filipino, domiciled in
the Philippines, it follows that the lower court had jurisdiction
over the res, in addition to its jurisdiction over the subjectmatter and the parties. In other words, it could validly inquire
into the legality or the marriage between the parties herein."

Meaning of psychological incapacity
Article 36 of the Family Code did not define the term
psychological incapacity' as ground for declaration of nullity or
marriage. Nor were any examples given. The reason was explained
by the Committee that drafted the Family Code, viz.:
"The Committee did not give any examples or psychological
incapacity for fear that the giving of examples would limit the
applic_ability of the provision under the principle of ejusdem
8"eris. Rather, the Committee would like the jude to interpret
he provision on a case-to-case basis, guided by experience, the
findings of experts and researchers in psychological disciplines,
"Pd by decisions of Church tribunals which, although not
"""Hin on the civil courts, my be given persuasive effect since
e Prov1s1on wus taken from Canon Law."'

The

the following rationale:
'"Psychological incapacity' should refer to no less than a
mental (not physical) incapncity thnt cnuses a party to be truly
incognitive of the basic marital covenants that concomitantly
must be assumed and discharged by the parties to the marriage
which, as so expressed by Article 68 of the Family Code. include
their mutual obligations to live together. observe love, respect
and fidelity and render help and support. There is hardly
any doubt that the intendment of the law has been to confine
the meaning of "psychological incapacity" to the most serious
cases of perso nality disorders clearly demonstrative of an utter
intensitivity or inability to give meaning and significance to the
marri age. This psychologic condition must exist at the time the
marriage is celebrated. The law does not evidently envision,
upon the other hand, an inability of the spouse to have sexual
relations with the other. This conclusion is implicit under Art icle
64 of the Family Code which considers children conceived prior
to the judicial declaration of nullity of the void marriage to be
'legitimate.'
The other forms of psychoses. if existing at the inception
of marriage, like the state of a pnrty being of unsound mind
or concealment of drug addiction, habitual alcoholism,
homosexuality or lesbianism, merely renders the marriage
contract voidable pursuant to Art icle 46, J,'amily Code. If drug
addiction, habitual alcoholism, lesbianism or homosexuality
should occur only during the marriage, they become mere
grounds for legal separation under Art icle 55 0f the Family
Code. These provisions of the Cod e, however, do not nccessRrily
preclude the possibility of thc!K! veriouy circumstnnres being
themselves, depending on the degree und severity of the
disorder, indicia of psychological incapacity.
Until further statutory and jurisprudential parameters are
established, every circumstance that may have some bearing on
the degree, extent, and other conditions of that incapacity mus
in every case, be carefully examined and evaluated so that no

to

In another case, the Supreme Court elucidated on the meaning
of psychological incapacity as set forth in Santos: The incapacity
must be grave or serious such that the party would be incapable of
carryi ng out the ordinary duties required in marriage; it must be
rooted in the history of the party antedating the marnage, although
the overt manifestations may emerge only after marriage; and it
must be incurable or, even if it were otherwi se, the cure would be
beyond the means of the party involved.
Later, more definitive guidelines in the interpretation and
application of Article 36 of the Family Code were laid down in
&public u. Court of Appeals and Molina, thus:
"(l} The burden of proo f to show the nullity of the marriage
belongs to the plaintiff. Any doubt should be resolved in favor of
the existence and continuation of the marriage and against its
dissolution and nullity. This is roo ted in the fact that both our
Constitution and our laws cherish the validity of marriage and
unity of the family. Thus, our Constitution devotes an entire
Article on the Family, recognizing it "as the foundation of the
nation." It decrees marriage as legally "inviolable," thereby
Protecting it from dissolution at the whim of the purtie.!"I. Both
the family and marriage are to be "protected" by the state.
The Family Code echoes this constitutional edict on
~arriuge and the family and emphasizes their permanence,
tnviolability and solidarity.

(2)
The root cause of the psychological incapacity
must be (a) medically or clinically identified, (b) alleged in the
complaint, (e) sufficiently proven by experts, and (d) clearly
explained in the decision. Article 36 of the Family Code requires
that the incapacity must be psychological • not physical
although its manifestations and/or symptoms may be physical
The evidence must convince the court that the parties, or one of
them, was mentally or psychically ill to such an extent that the
person could not have known the obligations he was assuming,
or knowing them, could not have given valid assumption
thereof. Although no example of such incapacity need be given
here so as not to limit the application of the provision under the
principle of ejusdem generis, nevertheless such root cause must
be identified as a psychological illness and its incapacitating
nature fully explained. Expert evidence may be given by
qualified psychiatrists and clinical psychologists.
(3) The incapacity must be proven to be existing at "the
time of the celebration" of the marriage. The evidence must show
that the illness was existing when the parties exchanged their
I do's." The manifestation of the illness need not be perceivable
at such time, but the illness itself must have attached at suc h
moment, or prior thereto.
(4) Such incapacity must also be shown to be medically
or clinically permanent or incurable. Such incurability may be
absolute or even relative only in regard to the other spouse,
not necessarily absolutely against everyone of the same sex
Furthermore, such incapacity must be relevant to the assumption
of marriage obligations, not necessarily to those not related to
marriage, like the exercise of a profession or employment in a
job. x xx
(5)
Such illness must be grave enough to bring about
the disability of the party to assume the essential obligation9
of marriage. Thus, "mild characteriological peculiarities, mood
changes, occasional emotional outbursts" cannot he accepted as
root causes 'The illness must be shown as downright incapacity
or inability, not a refusal, neglect or difficulty, much less ill will.
In other words, there is a natal or 11upcrvening diaubling factor
in the person, an adverse integral element in the pen10nality
structure that effectively incapacitates the person from ren~ly
accepting and thereby complying with the obligations esse ntial
to marriage.

(6)
The CRSCnliKl marital obligations must be those
embraced by Articles 68 up to 71 of the Family Code as regards
the husb11nd ond wife as well as Articles 220, 221, and 225
the same Code in regard to parents and their children. Such

non-complied marital obligation(s) must also be stated in the
petition, proven by evidence and included in the text of the
decision.
(7) Interpretations given by the National Appellate
Matrimonial Tribunal of the Catholic Church in the Philippines,
while not controlling or decisive, should be given great respect
by our courts. x xx
(8)
The trial court must order the prosecuting attorney
or fiscal and the Solicitor General to appear as counsel for the
state. No decision shall be handed down unless the Solicitor
General issues a certiticatioo, which will be quoted in the
decision, briefly stating therein his reasons for his agreement
or opposition, as the case may be, to the petition. The Solicitor
General, along with the prosecuting attorney, shall submit to
the court such certification within fifteen (15) days from the date
the case is deemed submitted for resolution of the court. The
Solicitor General shall discharge the equivalent function of the
defensor vinculi contemplated under Canon 1095."

More flexible application of guidelines
In Ngo Te u. Yu-Te,u the Supreme Court, referring to the above
guidelines in Molina, made the following observation:
pre dictably, however, in resolving subsequent cases, the
Court has applied the aforesaid standards, without too much
regard for the law's clear intention that each case is to be treated
differently, as "courts should interpret the provision on a case

of their families, our basic social institutions. Far from wh
was. intend~ by the Co_urt. Molina has beco me. a st~ait-j11.cke~
forcing all sizes to fit into and be bound by it. Wittingly a
unwittingly, the Court, in conveniently applying Molina, ha
allowed diagnosed sociopaths, schizophrenics, nymphomanias
narcissists and the like, to continuously debase and pervert he
sanctity of marriage. Ironically, the Roman Rota has annulled
marriages on account of the personality disorders of the said
individuals. xx x

Marcos, it further clarified that there is no requirement that the
qfendant/respondent spouse should be personally examined
by a physician or psychologist as a condition sine qua non for
the declaration of nullity of marriage based on psychological
incapacity. Accordingly, it is no longer necessary to introduce
pert opinion in a petition under Artcle 36 of the Family Code
if the totality of evidence shows that psychological incapacity
exists and its gravity, Juridical antecedence, and incurability
can be duly established.

620

In dissolving marital bonds on account of either party'
psychological incapacity, the Court is not demolishing the
foundation of families, but it is actually protecting the sanctity
of marriage, because it refuses to allow a person afflicted with
a psychological disorder, who cannot comply with or aa,ume
the essential marital obligations, from remaining in that
sacred bond. It may be stressed that the intliction of physical
violence, constitutional indolence or laziness, drug dependence
or addiction, and psychosexual anomaly are manifestations of a
sociopathic personality anomaly. Let it be noted that in Article
36, there is no marriage to speak of in the first place, as the
same is void from the very beginning. To indulge in imagery,
the declaration of nullity under Article 36 will simply provide a
decent burial to a stillborn marriage."

However, it was stressed that by no means has Molina been
abandoned: "Lest it be misunderstood, we are not suggesting the
abandonment of Molina in this case. We simply declare that rrI
there is need to emphasize other perspectives as well which should
govern the disposition of petitions for declaration of nullity under
Article 36. At the risk of being redundant, we reiterate once more
the principle that each case must be judged, not on the basis o_f •
priori assumptions, predilections or generalizations but accordint
to its own facts. And, to repeat for emphasis, courts should interpret
the provision on a case-to-case basis; guided by experience, the
findings of experts and researchers in psychological disciplines, and
by decisions of church tribunals."
Notably, the Supreme Court summarized the significant
rulings on Article 36 in Agrauiador u. Agrauiador:1'
"These guidelines (in Molina) incorporate the basic
requirements we established in Santos. A later case, Marcos

Supra, note.

621

A later case, Ngo Te u. Yu-Te, 11 declared that it may have
been inappropriate for the Court to impose a rigid set of rules,
as the one in Molina. in resolving all cases of psychological
incapacity. We stated that instead of serving as a guideline,
Molina unintentionally became a straightjucket, forcing all
cases involving psychological incapacity to fit into and be bound
by it, which is not only contrary to the intention of the law
but unrealistic as well because, with respect to psychological
incapacity, no case can be considered as on "all fours" with
another. Ngo Te, therefore, put into question the applicability of
time-tested guidelines set forth in Molina.

Ting u. Velez-Ting" and the fairly recent case of Suazo
u. Suazo" squarely met the issue and laid to rest any question
regarding the applicability of Molina. In these cases, we clarified
that Ngo Te did not abandon Molino; far from abandoning
Molina, it simply suggested the relaxation of its stringent
requirements. We also explained in Suazo that Ngo Te merely
stands for a more Aexible approach in considering petitions
for declaration of nullity of marriages based on psychological
incapacity."
Afterwards, the Court in Agraviador reached the conclusion
that Article 36of the Family Code contemplates downright incapacity
or inability to assume and fulfill the basic marital obligations, not a
~ere refusal, neglect or difficulty, much less, ill will, on the part of
th e errant spouse. "It is not to be confused with a divorce law that

reveals a situation where the parties or one of them, by reason;
a grave and incurable psychological illness existing at the time the
marriage was celebrated, was incapacitated to fulfill the obligations
of marital life (and thus could not then have validly entered into a
marriage), then we are compelled to uphold the indissolubility of the
marital tie."

irresponsibility, and. the like, do not by themselves warrant a
finding of psychological incapacity, as the same may only be
due to a person's difficulty, refusal or neglect to undertake the
obligations of marriage that is not rooted in some psychological
illness that Article 36 of the Fanuly Code addresi:;es.

Similarly, in Vias w. Vrias," the Supreme Court affirmed the
Court of Appeals decision which set aside the trial court decision
declaring the marriage between Glenn Vinas (Glenn) and Mary
Grace Parel-Vifias (Mary Grace) for being null and void, to wit:
"In the instant petition, the cumulative testimonies of
Glenn, Dr. Tayag and Rodelito, and the documentary evidence
offered do not sufficiently prove the root cause, gravity and
incurability of Mary Grace's condition. The evidence merely
shows that Mary Grace is outgoing, strung-willed and not
inclined to perform household chores. Further, she is employed
in Dubai and is romantically•involved with another man. She
has not been maintaining lines of communication with Glenn
at the time the latter filed the petition before the RTC. Glenn,
on the other hand. is conservative. family•oriented and is the
exact opposite of Mary Grace. While Glenn and Mary Grace
possess incompatible personalities, the latter's acts and traits
do not necessarily indicate psychological incapacity. Rumbaua
v. Rumbaua is emphatic that:

Of similar import is the holding in the later case of Yambao
u. Republic·"" on the meaning of incapacity: Article 36 contemplates
incapacity or inability to take cognizance of and to assume basic
marital obligations and not merely difficulty, refusal, or neglect in
the performance of marital obligations or ill will. This incapacity
consists of the following: (a} a true inability to commit oneself to
the essentials of marriage; (b) this inability to commit oneself mu.st
refer to the essential obligations of marriage: the conjugal act,
the community of life and love, the rendering of mutual help, the
procreation and education of offspring; and (c) the inability must be
tantamount to a psychological abnormality. It is not enough to prove
that a spouse failed to meet his responsibility and duty as a marred
person; it is essential that he must be shown to be incapable of doine:
so due to some psychological illness.

In Bier v. Bier, we ruled that it was not enough

marital obligations, or was unwilling to perform

FACTS : Liberato and Liezl were married in Bcolod City.
In the course of their relationship, Liezl left for Japan to work
as an entertainer for six (6) months. The couple got married
after Liezl returned home. They later moved to Japan where
Liezl again secured a contract as an entertainer and Liberato
found work as a construction worker. When they returned to the
Philippines, Lied confessed her romantic affair with a Japanese
man. Despite the confession, Liezl did not end the illicit
relationship. Liberato expressed her willingness lo forgive Liezl
but she chose to walk away from their marriage. Eventually,
Liberato decided to file a petition for declaration of nullity of
marriage under Art icle 36 of the Family Code. The RTC grunted
respondent's petition, and declared respondent and Liezl's
marriage void ab initio and their property regime dissolved.
The RTC relied on the psychological report and testimony of
expert witness, Dr. Tudla a clinical psychologist. Based on the
evaluation and assessment procedure she followed, Dr. Tudla
found that Liezl was afflicted by histrionic personality disorder,
• pervasive pattern of behavior characterized by excessive
emotionality and attention see king. The RTC found that Liezl
was largely responsible for the failure of her marriage. The
CA affirmed the RTC's decision on the ground that the totality
of evidence presented is adequate to sustain a finding of
psychological incapacity.

xxx To use the words of Navoles u. NalXlie•:
Art icle 36 contemplates downright incapacity or inability
to take cognizance of and to assume basic mntal obligations.
Mere "difficulty," "refusal" or "nelect" in the performance
of marital obligations or "ill will" on the part of the spouse
is different from 'incapacity" roo ted on some debilitating
psychological condition or illness. Indeed, irreconcilable
differences, sexual infidelity or perversion, emo tional
imma turity and irresponsibility. and the like, do not
by thems elves warrant a finding of psychological
incapacity under Art icle 36, as the same may only be
due to a person's refusal or unwillingness to assure
the essential obligations of ma rriage and not due to
some psychological illness that is contemplated by said

A.M. KO. 02-11·10-SC

. Th e KTC and CA did not err in ruling that the totality or
evidence sufficiently established the link between Liezl's action
showing her psychological incapacity to understand and perform
her marital obligations and her histrionic personality disorder.
The Court respec ts the RTC's appreciation of respondent's
testimony during trial on what transpired before and during
the marnage, considering that "[t]he totality of the behavior of
one spouse during the cohabitation and marriage is generally
and genuinely witnessed mainly by the other." In addition
Dr. Tudla was able to collect and verify largely the same facu
in the course of her psychological evaluation of both spouses
and her interview of Liezl's sister. Dr. Tudla's report gave a
description of histrionic personality disorder, and correlated
the characteristics of this disorder with Liezl's behavior from
her formative years through the course of her marriage to
petitioner. Indubitably, Dr. Tudl's report and testimony enjoy
such probative force emanating from the assistance her opinion
gave to the courts to show the facls upon which her psychological
conclusion was based .

Indeed, the conditions for the malady of being grave, antecedent
nd incurable demand the in-depth diagnosis by experts.

627

The findings of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) on the
existence or non-existence of a party's psychological incapacity
should be final and binding for as long as such findings and
evaluation of the testimonies of witnesses and other evidence
are not shown to be clearly and manifestly erro neous. In every
situation where the findings of the trial court are sufficiently
supported by the facts and evidence presented during trial,
the appellate court should restrain itself from substituting its
own judgment. It is not enough reason to ignore the findings
and evaluation by the trial court and substitute our own as
an appellate tribunal only because the Constitution and the
Family Code regard marriage as an inviolable social institution.
We have to stress that the fulfillment of the constitutional
mandate for the State to protect marriage as an inviolable soc ial
institution only relates to a valid marriage. No protection can be
accorded to a marriage that is null and void ab initio, because
such a marriage has no legal existence.

Respect for trial court findings

In declaring a marriage null and void ab initio, therefore,
the Courts really assiduously defend and promote the sanctity
of marriage as an inviolable soc ial institution. The foundation of
our soc iety is thereby made all the more strong and solid."

In Kalaw v. Fernandez," the Supreme Court urged due respect
for the trial court's findings on the existence or non-existence of
psychological incapacity if the same are not shown to be clearly and
manifestly erro neous, thus:

It has bee n held that if a spouse, although physically capable but
simply refuses to perform his or her essential marriage obligations,
and the refusal is senseless and constant, Catholic marriage
tribunals attribute the causes to psychological incapacity than to
stubborn refusal. Senseless and protracted refusal is equivalent to
psychological incapacity. Thus, the prolonged refusal of a spouse to
have sexual intercourse with h..is or her spouse is considered a sign of
psychological incapacity. In this case, the wife sought the declaration
of nullity of her marriage to defendant, alleging that from the time
~hat they were married until a span of ten (10) months when they
. ad separated after their quarrel, the husband had not had sexual
"ercourse with her, each one blaming the other. In affirming the
@csion of the trial court and the Co urt of Appeals declaring their
marriage void, the Supreme Court ruled:

"Art icle 36 or the Family Code must not be so strictly
and too literally read and applied given the clear intendment
of the drafters to adopt its enncted version or "less specificity"
obviously to enable "some resiliency in its application." Instend,
every court should approach the issue of nullity "not on the basis
of a priori assumptions, predilections or generalizations, but
according to its own facts" in recogn ition of the verity that no
case would be on ll fours" with the next one in the field of
psychological incapacity as a ground for the nullity of marriage;
hence, every "trial judge must take pains in examining the
factual milieu and the appellate court must, as much at
possible, avoid substituting its own judgment for that or the trial
court." In the task of ascertaining the presence of psychological
incapacity aa II ground for the nullity of marriage, the courts,
which re concededly not endowed with expertise in the field
of psychology, must of necessity rely on the opinion11 of expcrU
in order to inform themselves on the matter, and thus enable
themselves to arrive at an intelligent and judicious judgment.

refusal of one of the parties to ~ulfill the above marital oblie:atioa
is equivalent to psychological incapacity. "

In another case, Republic v. Olaybar,H the Supreme Court
decreed that a petition for correction or cancellation of an ent
in the civil registry cannot substitute for an action to invalida:
a marriage. A direct action is necessary to prevent circumvention
of the substantive and procedural safeguards of marriage under
the Family Code, A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC and other related lawa.
Among these safeguards arc the requirement of proving the limited
grounds for the dissolution of marriage, support pendente lite of the
spouses and children, the liquidation, partition and distributio
of the properties of the spouses and the investigation of the public
prosecutor to determine collusion. A direct action for declaration
of nullity or annulment of marriage is also necessary to prevent
circumvention of the jurisdiction of the Family Courts under the
Family Courts Act of 1997 (Republic Act :--Io. 8369). as a petition for
cancellation or correction of entries in the civil registry may be filed
in the Regional Trial Court where the corresponding civil registry
is located. In other words, a Filipino citizen cannot dissolve his
marriage by the mere expedient of changing his entry of marriage
in the civil registry.

who married respondent Maria Paz Galela Mnrinay (Marinay)
in the Philippines on January 23, 2004. The marriage did not sit
well with FPujiki's prents. Thus, Fujiki could not bring his wife
to Japan where he resides. Eventually, they lost contact with
each other.
In 200B, Mari nay met another Japanese, Shinichi Mne~ara
(Maekar). Without the first marriage being dissolved, Marna'
and Maekara were married on May 15, 2008 in Quezon City,
Philippines. Maekara brought Marinasy to Japan. However
Mrinay allegedly suffered physical nbuse from Maekara. She
left Maekara and started to contact Fujiki.

(3) for the RTC to direct the Local Civil Registrar of Quezon

The RTC dismissed the petition citing Sections 2(a) and 4

of the Rule on Declaration of Absolute Nullity of Void Marriages

RTC was of the opinion that only Marinay and Maekara could
file the petition.
Fujiki sought the reconsideration of the dismissal,
contending that A.M. No. 02-11-10.SC was inapplicable to a
petition for recognition of a foreign judgment. Fujiki also argued
that AM. No. 02-11-10-SC only applies to void marriages under
Article 36 of the Family Code. He claims that to apply Section

o

To hold that A.M. No. 02-11-IO-SC applies to a petition
for recognition of foreign judgment would mean that the trial
court and the parties should follow its provisions, including the
form and contents of the petition, the service of summons, the
investigation of the public prosecutor, the setting of pre-trial.
the trial and the judgment of the trinl wurt. This is absurd
because it will litigate the case unew. It will defeat the purpose
of recognizing foreign judgments, which is "to limit repetitive
litigation on claims and issues." The interpretation of the RTC
is tantamount to relitigating the case on the merits.
A petition to recognize a foreign judgment declaring a
marriage void does not require relitigation under a Philippine
court of the case as if it were a new petition for declaration
of nullity of marriage. Philippine courts cannot presume to
know the foreign laws under which the foreign judgment was
rendered. They cannot substitute their judgment on the status,
condition and legal capacity of the foreign citizen who is under
the jurisdiction of another state. Thus. Philippine courts can
only recognize the foreign judgment as a fact according to the
rules of evidence.
Divorce involves the dissolution of a marriage, but the
recognition of a foreign divorce decree does not involve the
extended procedure under AM. No. 02-11-10.SC or the rules of
ordinary trial.
2.
Yes. Fujiki has the personality to file II petition
to recognize the Japanese Family Court judgment nullifying:
the marriage between Marinay nd Maekaru on the ground
of bigamy because the judgment concerns his civil status %
married to Marinay. For the same reason he has the personal!
to file petition under Rule 108 to cancel the entry of marr1a~
between Mariny and Maekara in the civil registry on the bas!
of the decree of the Japanese Family Court.
There is no doubt that the prior spouse hos a personal and
material interest in maintaining the integrity of the marr
he contracted and the property relations rising from it. There 1
also no doubt that he is interested in the cancellation of an entr'
of a bigamous marrinJ.:e in the civil registry, which compromise'
the
the public record of his marriage. The interest derives from

substantive right of the spouse not only to preserve (or dissolve,
limited instances) his most intimate human relation, but also
to protect his property interests that arise by operation of law
the moment he contractfi marriage. These property mterests in
marriage include the right to be supported "in keeping with the
financial capacity of the family" and preserving the property
regime of the muriage.
Property rights arc already substantive rights protected
by the Constitution, but a spouse's right in a marriage extends
further to relational righL<; recognized under Title Ill ("Rights
and Obligations between Husband and Wife'') of the Family
Code. A.M. No. 02-11-10.SC cannot "diminish, increase, or
modify" the substantive right of the spouse to maintain the
integrity of his marriage. In any case, Section 2(a) of A.M.
No, 02-11-10.SC preserves this substantive right by limiting
the personality to sue to the husband or the wife of the union
recognized by law.
Section 2a) of A.M. No. 02.11.-10.SC does not preclude
a spouse of subsisting marriage to question the validity of a
subsequent marriage on the ground of bigamy. On the contrary,
when Section 2(a) states that "[a] petition for declaration of
absolute nullity of void marriage may be fled solely by the
husband or the wife"-it refers to the husband or the wife
of the subsisting marriage. Under Article 35(4) of the Family
Code, bigamous marriages are void from the beginning. Thus,
the parties in a bigamous marriage are neither the husband nor
the wife under the law. The husband or the wife of the prior
subsisting marriage is the one who has the personality to file
a petition for declaration of absolute nullity of void marriage
under Section 2(a) of A.M No. 02-11-10.SC.
When the right of the spouse to protect his marriage is
violated, the spouse is clearly an injured party and is therefore
~tereste<l. in the judgment of the suit .•Iuliano.Llave ruled that
the prior spouse "is clearly the aggrieved party as the bigamous
mnrriage not only threatens the financial and the property

3.
Yes. Since the recognition of a foreign judgment on!
req uires proof of fact of the judgment, it may be made in a spe,
proceeding for canccllntton or correct ton of entries in the civil
registry under Rule 108 of the Rules of Court. Rule l, Section 3
of the Rules of Court provides that "[a] special proc eed ing is
remedy by which a party seeks to establish a statue, a right, or
a part icular fact." Rule 108 creates a remedy to rectify fact of
a person's life which are recorded by the State pursuant to the
Civil Register Law or Act No. 3753. As noted by the Solicitor
General, in Corpuz u. Sto. Tomas this Court dedared that "[t)h,
recognition of the foreign divorce decree may be made in a Rule
108 proceeding itself. as the object of special proceedings (such
as that in Rule 108of the Rules of Court) is precisely to establish
the status or right of a party or a particular fact."

the nullity of marriage, is fully consistent with Philippine public
policy as expressed 1~ Article 35(4) of the Family C'...:ide and
Article 349 of the Revised Penni Cude. The Filipino spouse has
the option to undergo fuU trial by filing a petition for declaration
of nullity of marriae under A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC, but this i4
not the only remedy available to him or her. Philippine courts
have jurisdiction to recognize a foreign judgment nullifying a
bigamous marriage, without prejudice to a criminal prosecution
for bigamy.

A petition for correction or cancellation of an entry in
the civil registry cannot substitute for an action to invalidate a
marriage. A direct action is necessary to prevent circumvention
of the substantive and procedural safeguards of marriage
under the Family Code, A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC for correction or
cancellation of an entry and other related laws.
However, this does not apply in a petition for correc tion or
cancellation of a civil registry entry based on the recognition of
foreign judgment annulling marriage where one of the parties
is a citizen of the foreign country. There is neither circumvention
of the substantive and procedural safegu ards of marriage
under Philippine law. nor of the jurisdiction of Family Courts
under R.A. No. 8369. A recognition of a foreign judgment is not
an action to nullify n marriage. It is an action for Philippine
courts to recognize the effectivity of a foreign judgment. which
presupposes a case which was already tried and decided under
foreign law. The procedure in AM. No. 02-11-10.SC docs not
apply in a petition to recognize a foreign judgment annulling a
bigamous marriage where one of the parties is a citizen o( the
foreign country. Neither can R.A. No. 8369 define the jurisdiction
or the foreign court.
Under the second paragraph of Article 26 of the Family
Cod e, Philippine courts are empowered to correct a situuti~n
where the Filipino spouse is still tied to the marringe wh"
the foreign spouse is free to mnrry. Moreover, notwithsuinding
Art icle 26 of the Family Code, Philippine courts already ha
th
jurisdiction to extend the effect of a foreign judgme in e
Philippines to the extent that the foreign judgment docs not
contravene domestic public policy. A critical difference be""
the case of a foreign divorce decree and a foreign JUdgill ( r
nullifying a bigamous marriage is that bigamy, as a grou nd "

633

Cited in the above case is the ruling in Julian.o-L/ave v.
Republic," that A.M. No. 02-11-10-SC, which limits to only the
husband or the wife the filing of a petition for nullity, does not shut
out the Prior spouse from filing suit if the ground is a bigamous
subsequent marriage. "The subsequent spouse may only be expected
to take action if he or she had only discovered during the connubial
period that the marriage was bigamous, and especially if the conjugal
bliss had already vanished. Should parties in a subsequent marriage
benefit from the bigamous marriage, it would not be expected that
they would fle an action to declare the marriage void and thus,
in such circumstance, the "injured spouse" who should be given
a legal remedy is the one_ in a subsisting previous marriage. The
latter LS clearly the aggrieved party as the bigamous marriage not
only threatens the financial and the property ownership aspect of the
pror marriage but most of all, it causes an emotional burden to the
pror spouse . Th e subsequent marriage will always be a reminder of

by Manalo in Japan should not be recognized, based on Artiele
16 of the Civil Code. On appeal. the CA overturned the RTC

longer married to the former, capacitating him to remarry.

2.
Jurisprudence has set guidelines before Philippine
courts recognize a foreign judr,ment relating to the status of a
marriage where one of the parties is a citizen of a foreign country.
Presentation solely of the divorce decree will not suffice. The
fact of divorce must still first be proven. Before a foreign divorce
decree can be recognized by our courts, the party pleading it
must prove the divorce as a fact and demonstrate its conformity
to the foreign law allowing it.

634

1.
Can a Flipino national cause the recognition of a
foreign divorce decree before Philippine courts?
2.
Whal is the procedure for Philippine courts to
recognize a foreign judgment relating to the status of a marriage?
HELD,
1.
Yes. Both Dacasin vu. Dacasin nnd Van Dorn already
recognized a foreign divorce decree that was initiated ond
obtained by the 1-'i)ipino spouse and extended its legal effects on
the issues of child custody and property relation, respectively.
In addition, the fact that a validly obtained foreign divorce
initiated by the Filipino spouse can be recognized and given
legal effects in the Philippines is implied from the rulings in
Fujiki v. Marinay, et al. and Medina v. Koke.
There is no compelling reason to deviate from the above·
mentioned rulings. Wh en this Court recognized a foreign divorce
decree that was initiated and obtained by the Filipino spouse
and extended its legal effects on the issues of child custody
and property relation, it should not stop short in likewise
acknowledging th atone of the usual and neclissary consequences
of absolute divorce is the right to remarry. Indeed, there is no
longer a mutual obligation to live together and observe fidelityWh en the marriage tie is severed and ceased to exist, the ch
status and the domestic relation of the former spouses change
as both of them are freed from the marital bond.
Paragraph 2 of Article 26 speaks of "a divorce rrr valid
obtained abroad by the alien spouse capacitating him or her
remarry." Based on a clear and plain rending of the provi%"""
it only requires that there be a divorce validly obtained abroah
The letter of the law does not demand that the lien spouse
should be the one who initiated the proceeding where ""
divorce decree was granted. It does not distinguish whether ""
Filipino spouse is the petitioner or the respondent in the foreign
divorce proc eeding.

635

Indeed the bes t evidence of a judgment is the judgment
it.self. The decree purports to be a written act or reco rd of an act
of an official body or tribunal of a foreign country.
Under Sections 24 and 25 of Rule 132, on the other hand, a
writing or document may be proven as a public or official record
of a foreign country by either (1) an official publication or (2) a
copy thereof attested by the officer having legal custody of the
document. If the record is not kept in the Philippines. such copy
must be (a) acco mpanied by a certificate issued by the proper
diplomatic or consular officer in the Philippine foreign service
stationed in the foreign country in which the record is kept and
(b) authenticated by the seal of his office.
If the opposing party fails to properly object, as in this
case, the divorce decree is rendered admissible as a written act
of the foreign court. As it appears, the existence of the divorce
decree was not denied by the OSG; neither was the jurisdiction
of the divorce court impeached nor the validity of its proceedings
challenged on the gro und of collusion, fraud, or clear mistake of
fact or law, albeit an opportunity to do so.
Nonetheless, the Japanese law on divorce must still be
proved. It is well-settled in our jurisdiction that our courts
cannot take judicial notice of foreign laws. Like any other
facts, they must be alleged and proved. Since the divorce was
raised by Manalo, the burden of proving the pertinent ,Japanese
law vahdnting it, as well as her former husband's capacity to
remarry , fall squarely upon her. ,Japanese laws on persons
and family relations arc not among those matters that Filipino
JudgeR are suppoSt.>d to know by reason of their judicial function.

Judgm;ary measures avai1ed of during the pendcncy of the action,

indent upon the result of the main action. The subject orders on
he matter of support pendente lite are but an incident to the main

"ertoutory order not subject of en appeal is an appropriate
[
eivl action under Rule 65 provided that the interlocutory
order is rendered without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave
abuse of discretion. Having chosen the wrong remedy in questioning
the subject interlocutory orders of the RTC, petitioner's appeal was
correctly dismissed by the Court of Appeals.JO

The receiver or administrator may not dispose
of or encumber any common property or specific
separate property of either spouse without prior

Upon receipt of a verified petition for declaration of absolute
nullity of void marriage or for annulment of voidable marriage, or
for legal separation, and at any time during the proceeding, the
court, motu proprio or upon verified application of any of the parties,
guardian or designated custodian, may temporarily grant support
pendente lite prior to the rendition of judgment or final order.
Because of its provisional nature, a court does not need to delve
fully into the merits of the case before it can settle an application
for this relief. All that a court is tasked to do is determine the kind
and amount of evidence which may suffice to enable it to justly
resolve. the application. It is enough that the facts be established by
affidavits or other documentary evidence appearing in the record."

The Rules of Court provide for the provisional remedy of
support pendente lite which may be availed of at the commencement
of the proper action or proceeding, or at any time prior to the
Judgment or final order. On March 4, 2003, this Court promulgated
the Rule on Provisional Orders which shall govern the issuance of

restraint and defer to the competence or jurisdiction of the arbitral
tribunal by allowing the arbitral tribunal the first opportunity to
rule upon such issues.
Where the court is asked to make a determination of whether
the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable
of being performed, under this policy of judicial restraint, the court
must make no more than a prima facie determination of that issue.
Unless the court, pursuant to such prima facie determination,
concludes that the arbitration agreement

aggrieved party;
b.

the denial thereof was received; (c) set forth concisely a statement
of the matters involved, and the reasons or arguments relied on for

portions of the record as would support the petition; and (e) contain
a sworn certification against forum shopping.

Appeals' determination of questions of fact, of law or both questions
offact and law, shall not warrant the exercise of the Supreme Court's
discretionary power. The error imputed to the Court of Appeals must
be grounded upon any of the above prescribed grounds for review or

fled within fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final
order or resolution appealed from, or of the denial of the petitioner's
motion for new trial or reconsideration fled in due time after notice
of the Judgment.

The Supreme Court may on its own initiative deny the petition
on the ground that the appeal is without merit, or is prosecuted
manifestly for delay, or that the questions raised therein are too
insubstantial to require consideration.

On motion duly filed and served, with full payment of the
docket and other lawful fees and the deposit for costs before the
expiration of the reglementary period, the Supreme Court may for
justifiable reasons grant an extension of thirty (30) days only within
which to file the petition.

against the collateral, pending the constitution of the arbitral
tribunal. Any determination made by the court in that special
proceeding pertaining to the merits of the controversy, including the
right of the lender to proceed against the collateral, shall be only
provisional in nature.
After the arbitral tribunal is constituted. the court shall stay
its proceedings and defer to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal
over the entire controversy including any question regarding the
right of the lender to proceed ugainst the collateral.
Rule A.4. Remedy of borrower against action taken by the
lender against the collateral after the arbitral tribunal has been
constituted. - After the arbitral tribunal is constituted, the borrower
providing security for the payment of his loan who is aggrieved by
the action taken by the lender against the collateral securing the
loan may apply to the arbitral tribunal for relief, including a claim
for damages, against such action of the lender. An application to the
court may also be made by the borrower against any action taken
by the lender against the collateral securing the loan but only if
the arbitral tribunal cannot act effectively to prevent an irreparable
injury to the rights of such borrower during the pendency of the
arbitral proceeding.
An arbitration agreement in a contract of Joan precludes the
borrower therein providing security for the loan from filing and/
or proceeding with any action in court to prevent the lender from
foreclosing the pledge or extra.judicially foreclosing the mortgage.
If any such action is filed in court, the lender shall have the right
provided in the Special AD R Rules to have such action stayed on
account of the arbitration agreement.

Rule A.5. Relief that may be granted by the arbitral tribunal. The rbitral tribunal, in aid of the arbitral proceeding before it, may
upon submission of adequate security, suspend or enjoin the lender
from proceeding against the collateral securing the loan pending
final determination by the arbitral tribunal of the dispute brought
to 1t for decision under such contract of loan.
The arbitral tribunal shell have the authority to resolve the
issue of the validity of the foreclosure of the thing pledged or of
the extrajudicial foreclosure of the collateral under the real estate
mortgage if the same has not yet been foreclosed or confirm the
validity of such foreclosure if made before the rendition of the
arbitral award and had not been enjoined.

Rule A.8. Arbitration involving a third.party provider of
security. - An arbitration agreement contained in a contract of
loan between the lender and the borrower extends to and covers an
access<>ry contract securing the loan, such as a pledge, mortgage,
guaranty or suretyship, executed by a person other than the
borrower only if such third-party securing the loan has agreed in
the accessory contract, either directly or by reference, to be bound by
such arbitration agreement.
Unless otherwise expressly agreed upon by the third-party
securing the loan, his agreement to be bound by the arbitration
agreement in the contract of loan shall pertain to disputes arising
from or in connection with the relationship between the lender and
the borrower as well as the relationship between the lender and such
third-party including the right of the lender to proceed against the
collateral securing the loan, but shall exclude disputes pertaining to
the relationship exclusively between the borrower and the provider
of security such as that involving a claim by the provider of security
for indemnification against the borrower.
In this multi-party arbitration among the lender, the borrower
and the third party securing the loan, the parties may agree to submit
to arbitration before a sole arbitrator or a panel of three arbitrators
to be appointed either by an Appointing Authority designated by
the parties in the arbitration agreement or by a default Appointing
Authority under the law.
In default of an agreement on the manner of appointing
arbitrators or of constituting the arbitral tribunal in such multiparty arbitration, the dispute shall be resolved by a panel of three
arbitrators to be designated by the Appointing Authority under the
law. But even in default of an agreement on the manner of appointing
an arbitrator or constituting an arbitral tribunal in a multi-party
arbitration, if the borrower and the third party securing the loan
agree to designate a common arbitrator, arbitration shall be decided
by a panel of three arbitrators: one to be designated by the lender;
!~e othe.r to be designated jointly by the borrower and t_he provider
security who have agreed to designate the same arbitrator; and
a third arbitrator who shall serve as the chairperson of the arbitral
panel to be designated by the two party-designated arbitrators.

Aboitiz Transport System Corporation v.
Carlos A. Gothong Lines, Inc.
G.R No. 198226, July 18, 2014

Lanuza, Jr. v. BF Corporation
G.R. No. 174938, October 1, 2014
This jurisdiction adopts a policy in (Mvor or arbitration.
Arbitration allows the parties to void litigation and settle
disputes amicably and more expeditiously by themselves and
thro ugh their choice of arbitrators.
The policy in favor of arbitration has been affirmed in our
Civil Code, which was approved as early as 1949. It was later
institutionalized by the approval of Republic Act No. 876, which
expressly authorized , made valid, enforceable. and irrevoca ble
parties' decision to submit their controversies, including
incidental issues. to arbitration.
In view of our policy to adopt arbitration as a manner of
settling disputes , arbitration clauses are liberally construed. to
favor arbitration. Thus, in LM Power Engineering Corporation
v. Cap itol Industrial Construction Groups, Inc., this court said:
Being an inexpensive, speed y and amicable
method of settling disputes , arbitration- along with
mediation, conciliation and negotiation
is encouraged by the Supreme Court. Aside from unclogging
judicial dockets, arbitration also hastens the resolution of disputes, especially of the commercial kind.
It is thus regarded as the "wave of the future" in international civil and commercial disputes. Brushing
aside a contractual agreement calling for arbitration
between the parties would be a step backward.
Consistent with the above-mentioned
policy of encouraging alternative dispute
resolution methods, courts should liberally
construe arbitration clauses. Provided such
clause is susceptible of an interpretation that
covers the asserted dispute, an order to arbitrate should be granted. An y doubt should be
resolved in favor of arbitration.
A more clear-cut statement of the state policy to encourage
arbitration and to favor interpretations that would render
effective an arbitration clause was later expressed in Section 2
of Republic Act No. 9285.

At the outset, the Court notes that the nature of the
complaint fled by CAGLI before the RTC is for the enforcement
of an arbitration agreement, governed by Section 6 of RA 876,
viz.:
"Section 6. Hearing by court. - A party
aggrieved by the failure, neglect or refusal of
another to perform under an agree ment in writing
providing for arbitration may petition the court for
an order directing that such arbitration proceed
in the manner provided for in such agreement.
Five days notice in writing of the hearing of such
application shall be served either personally or by
registered mail upon the party in default. The court
shall hear the parties, and upon being satisfied
that the makin g of the agreement or such failure
to comply therewith is not in issue, shall make an
order directing the part ies to proceed to arbitration
in accordance with the terms of the agreement. If
the making of the agreement or default be in issue
the court shell proceed to summarily hear such
issue. If the finding be that no Agreement in writing
providing for arbitration was made, or that there
is no default in the proceeding thereunder, the
proceeding shall be dismissed. If the finding be that
a written provision for arbitration was made and
there is a default in proceeding thereunder, an order
shall be made summarily directing the parties tel
proceed with the arbitration in accordance with the
terms thereof."
In the case of Gonzal es u. Climax Mining, Ltd. (Gonzales),
the Court had instructed that the special proc eeding under
the above·quoted provision is the proced ural mechanism for
the enforcement of the contract to arbitrate. RA 876 explicitly
confines the court's authority only to pass upon the issue of
whether there is or there is no agreement in writing providing
for arbitration. If there is such agreement, the court shall issue
an order summarily directing the parties to proceed with the
arbitration in accordance with the terms thereof; otherwise,
the proceeding shall be dismissed. To stress, such proc eeding
merely a summary remedy to enforce the agreement to arbitrate
and the duty of the court is not to resolve the merits of the
parties' claims but only to determine if they should proc eed to
arbitration or not.

Gonzales u. Climax Mining Ltd.
G.R. No. 161967, January 22, 2007
Arbitration. as an alternative mode of settling disputes,
has long been recognized and acce pted in our jurisdiction. The
Civil Code is explicit on the matter. R.A. No. 876 also expressly
authorizes arbitration of domestic disputes. Foreign arbitrlllion,
as a system of settling commercial disputes of an international
character, was likewise recognized when the Philippines
adhered to the United Nations "Convention on the Recognition
and the Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958,"
under the 10 May 1965 Reso lution No. 71 of the Philippine
Senate. giving reciprocal recognition and allowing enforcement
of international arbitration agreements between parties of
different nationalities within a contracting state. The enactment
of R.A. No. 9285 on 2 April 2004 further institutionalized the use
of alternative dispute resolution systems, including arbitration,
in the settlement of disputes .
Disputes do not go to arbitration unless and until the
parties have agreed to abide by the arbitrator's decision.
Nece ssa rily, a contract is required for arbitration to take place
and to be binding. RA. No. 876 reco gnizes the contractual
nature or the arbitration agree ment.
Thus, we held in Manila Electric Co. v. Pasay Tra nsportahon Co. that a submission to arbitration is a contract. A clause
in a contract providing that all matters in dispute between the
parties shall be referred to arbitration is a contract, and in Del
Monte Corporation-USA u. Court of Appeals that "[t]he provision to submit to arbitration any dispute arising therefrom and
the relationship of the parties is part of that contract and is
itse lf a contract. As a rule, contracts are respected as the law
between the contracting parties and produce effect as between
them, their assigns and heirs."
The special proc eed ing under Sec . 6 of R.A. No. 876
recogn izes the contractual nature of arbitration clauses or
agreements.
Thie special proceed ing is the proced ural mechanism for
the enforcement of the contract to arbitrate. The jurisdiction of
the courts in relation to Sec. 6 of RA. No. 876 as well s the
nature of the proceedings therein was expounded upon in La
Nacal Drug Corporation u. Court of Appeals. There it was held
th at R.A. No. 876 explicitly confines the court's authority only
to the determination of whether or not there is an agreement in
wnting providing for arbitration. In the affirm ative, the statute

SPECIAL RULES OF COURT ON ALTERNATIVE
DISPUTE RESOLUTION
A.M. NO 07-11.08-SC
ordains that the court shall issue an order "summarily directing
the parties to proce ed with the arbitration in accordance with
the terms thereof." If the court, upon the other hand, finds that
no such agreement exis ts, "the proceeding shall be dismissed."
Arbitration before the Panel of Arbitrators is proper
only when there is a disagreement between the parties as to
some provisions of the contract between them, which needs the
interpretation and the application of that particular knowledge
and expertise posse ssed by members of that Panel. It is not
proper when one of the part ies repudiates the existence or
validity of such contract or agreement on the ground of fraud
or oppression as in this case. The validity of the contract
cannot be subject of arbitration proceedings. Allegations
of fraud and duress in the execution of a contract are matters
within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of law. These
questions are legal in nature and require the application
and interpretation of laws and jurisprudence which is
necessarily a judicial function.

Koppel, Inc. v. Makati Rotary Club Foundation, Inc.
G.R. No. 198076, September 4, 2013
Th e fact that the petitioner and res pondent already
underwent thorough JDR proc eedings before the RTC, will not
make the subsequent conduct of arbitration between the part ies
unnecessa ry or circuitous. The JDR system is substan tially
different from arbitration proceed ings.
Th e JDR framework is based on the proce sses of mediation,
conciliation or early neutral evaluation which entails the
submission of a dispute before a "JDRju.dge" who !!hall merely
"facilitate settlement" between the parties in conflict or make
a "non-binding evaluation or asse ssment of the chances of each
party's case ." Thus in JDR, the JDR judge lacks the authority
lo render a resolution of the dispute that is binding upon the
parties in conflict. In arbitration, on the other hand, the dispute
ia 8Ubmitted to an arbitrator /s
a neutral third perso n or a
gro up of thereof
who shall have the authority to render a
reso lution binding upon the parties.
Clearly, the mere submission of a dispute to JDR
proc eedings would not necessarily render the subsequent conduct
of arbitration a mere surplusage. Th e failure of the parties m
conflict to reach an amicable settlement before the JDR may,
in fact, be supplemented by their resort to arbitration where a
binding resolution to the dispute could finally be achieved. Th is
situation precise ly finds application to the case at bench.

Korea Technologies Co, Ltd. v. Lerma
G.R. No. 143681, January 7, 200 8
Republic Act No. 9286 incorporated the UNCITRAL
Model law to which we arc a signatory
For domestic arbitration proc eedings, we have particular
agencies to arbitrate disputes arising from contractunl relations.
In case a foreign arbitral body is chosen by the parties, the
arbitration rules of our domestic arbitration bodies would not be
applied. As signatory to the Arbitration Hules of the UNCITRAL
Model Law on International Commerciul Arbitration of the
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
UNCITRAL ) in the New York Convention on June 21, 1985, the
Philippines committed itself to be bound by the Model Law. We
have even incorporated the Model Law in Republic Act No. (RA)
9285, otherwise known as the Alternative Dispute Resolution
Act of 2004 entitled An Act to Institutionalize the Use of an.
Alternative Dispute Resolution System in the Philippines and to
Establish the Office for Alternative Dispute Resolution, and for
Other Purposes, promulgated on April 2, 2004. Sec tions 19 and
20 of Chapter 4 of the Model Law are the pertinent provisions:
CHAPT ER 4 - IKTERNATIONAL COMM ERCIAL
AR BITRA TION
SEC. 19. Adoption of the Model Law on International
Commercial Arbitration.
International
commercial
arbitration shall be governed by the Model Law on International
Commercial Arbitration (the ''Model Law") adopted by the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law on dune 21
1985 (United Nations Document A/40/17) nd recommended
for enactment by the General Assembly in Resolution No. 40/72
approved on December 11, 1985, copy of which is hereto attached
as Appendix "A".
SEC. 20. Interpretation of Model Law. - In interpreting
the Model Law, regard shall be had to its international origin
and to the need for uniformity in its interpretation and resort
may be made to the trauaux preparatories and the report of
the Secretary General of the United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law dated March 25, 1985 entitled,
lnternat101111l Commercial Arbitration: Analytical Commentary
on Draft Trade identified by reference number A/CN. 9 /264 ."
While Republic Act No. 9285 was passe d only in 2004, it
none th eless applies in the instant case since it is proc edural
law which has a retroactive effect. Likewise, KOGIES fled its
application for arbitration before the KCABon July 1, 1998and it

is still pending bec ause no arbitral award has yet been rendered.
Th us, Republic Act No. 9285 is applicable to the instant case.
Well.settled is the rule that procedural laws are construed to
be applicable to actions pending and undetermined at the time
of their passage, and are deemed retroactive in that sense and
to that extent. As a general rule, the retroactive application of
procedural laws docs not violate any personal rights because no
vested right has yet attached nor arisen from them.
Am ong the pertinent features of Republic Act No. 9285
applyin g and incorpo ratin g the UNCITRAL Model Law are the
following:
(1)

The RTC must refer to arbitration in proper cases

Under Sec tion 24, the RTC docs not have jurisdiction over
disputes that are properly the subject of arbitration pursuant to
an arbitration clause, and mandates the referral to arbitration
in such cases , thus:
SEC. 24. Referral to Arbitration.
A court before which
an action is brought in a matter which is the subject matter of an
arbitration agreement shall, if at least one party so req uests not
later than the pre-trial conference, or upon the request of both
parties thereafter, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds
that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or
incapable of being performed.

(2)

Foreign arbitral awards must be confirmed by the
RTC

Foreign arbitral awards while mutually stipulated by
the parties in the arbitration clause to be final and binding
are not immediately enforceable or cannot be implemented
immediately. Section 35of the UNCITRAL Model Law stipulates
the requirement for the arbitral award to be recogni zed by
a competent court for enforcement, which court under Sec .
36 of the UNCITRA L Model Law may refuse recognition or
enforcement on the gro unds provided for. RA 9285 incorporated
these provisos to Sec tions 42, 43, and 44 relative to Sec tions 47
and 48, thus:
SEC. 42. Applicalicn of the New York Convention. Th e New York Convention shall govern the recognition and
enforcement of arbitral awards covered by said Convention.
The recogn ition and enforcement of such arbitral awards
shall be filed with the Regional Trial Court in accordance

and enforce a non-convention award as a convention award.

SEC. 44. Foreign Arbitral Award Not Foreign Judgment.
A foreign arbitral award when confirmed by a court of a
foreign country, shall be recogni zed and enforced as a foreign
arbitral award and not as a judgment of a foreign court .
A foreign arbitral award, when confirmed by the Regi onal
Tri al Court. shall be enforced in the same manner as final and

SEC. 48. Notice of Proceeding to Parties.- In a speci al
proceed ing for recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award,
the Court shall send notice to the parties at their address of
record in the arbitration, or if any part cannot be served notice
at such address , st such party's last known address The notice
shall be sent a t least fifteen (15) days before the date set for the
initial hearing of the application.

It is now clear that foreign arbitral awards when confirm ed
by the RTC are deemed not as a judgment of a foreign court but
as a foreign arbitral award, and when confirmed, are enforced as
final and executory decisions of our courts of law.
Th us, it can be gleaned that the concept of a final and
binding arbitral award is similar to judgments or awards given
by some of our quasi-judicial bodies, like the National Labor
Relations Commission and Mines Adjudication Boa rd, whose
final judgments are stipulated to be final and bindin g, but
not immediately executory in the sense that they may still be
judicially reviewed, upon the ins tance of any party. Therefore,
the final foreign arbitral awards are similarly situated in that
they need first to be confirmed by the RTC.

(I)

The RTC bas jurisdiction to review foreign arbitral
award s

Sec tion 42 in relation to Sec tion 45 of Republic Act No.
9285 designated and vested the RTC with specific authority and
juri sdiction to set aside, reject, or vacate a foreign arbitral award
on gro unds provided under Ar icle 34(2) of the UNCITRAL
Model Law. Sec tions 42 and 46 provide:
SEC. 42. Application of the New York Convention.
-Th e New York Convention shall govern the reco gnition
and enforce ment of arbitral awards covered by said
Convention.
The recogn ition and enforce ment of such arbitral awards
shall be filed with the Regional Trial Court in accordance
with the rules of procedure to be promulgated by the Supreme
Court . Said procedural rules shall provide that the party relying
on the award or applying for its enforcement shall file with the
court the original or authenticated copy of the award and the
arb itration agreement. If the award or agree ment is not made
in any of the official languages, the party shall supply a duly
certified translation thereof into any of such languages.
Th e applicant shall establish that the country in which
foreign arbitration award was made is party to the New York
Convention.

If the application for rejection or suspension of enforcement
or an Award has been made, the Regional Trial Court may, if
it considers it proper, vacate its decision and may also, on the
application of the party claiming reco gnition or enforce ment of
the award , order the part y to provide appropriate security.

acco rdance with the proc edures and rules to be promulgated by
the Supreme Court only on those gro unds enumerated under
Art icle V of the New York Convention. Any other gro und raised
shall be disregarded by the Regional Trial Court .
Thus, while the RTC does not have jurisdiction over
disputes governed by arbitra tion mutually agreed upon by the
part ies, still the foreign arbitral award is subject to judicial
review by the RTC which can set aside. reject. or vacate it. In
this sense, what this Court held in Chung Fu Industries (Phils.),
Inc. relied upon by KOGIES is applicable insofar as the foreign
arbitral awards, while final and binding, do not oust courts
of jurisdiction since these arbitral awards are not absolute
and without exceptions as they are still judicially reviewable.

G.R. No. 120319, October 6, 1995
Under Sec tion 22 of Republic Act No. 876, also known as
the Arbitration Law. arb itration is deemed a special proceeding
of which the court spec ified in the contract or submission, or if
none be spec ified, the Regional Tri al Court for the province or
city in which one of the part ies resides or is doing business, or
in which the arbitration is held, shall have jurisdiction. A part y
to the controversy may, at any time within one (I) month after
an award is made, apply to the court having jurisdiction for an
order confirming the award and the court must grant such order
unless the award is vacated, modifi ed or corrected.
In effect, this equates the award or decision of the voluntary
arbitrator with that of the regional trial court . Conseq uently, in
a petition for certiorari from that award or decision, the Court
or Appeals must be deemed to have concurrent jurisdiction
with the Supreme Court. As a matter of policy, this Court shall
henceforth remand to the Court of Appeals petitions of this
nature for proper disposition.
